In these I have extended and developed the theory of social change upon which this book is based, added a theory of democratic politics based on recent cross-cultural literature, and surveyed the principal challenges presently confronting the region. Chapters 4 and 6 have been considerably re¬ vised to take into account recent scholarship and new data, as well as some revelations by the Russian government and by former President Wojciech Jaruzelski. I have also made modest revisions to the book's other chapters. As in the first edition, I have given minimal attention to Albania — this time largely for reasons of space. Work on this second edition was accomplished while at the Slavic Re¬ search Center, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan. I am grateful to the Center and to Hokkaido University for the support that has made this work possible. I am also grateful to Reynolds Smith of Duke University Press for encouraging me to carry out these revisions. I also wish to thank John Lowenhardt for his helpful comments on an earlier draft of chapter 1. And special thanks to Chris Hassenstab for generous assistance in assembling a new index for this edition. Sabrina Petra Ramet Sapporo, 12 October 1993 Preface to the First Edition This book is concerned with social change in seven communist coun¬ tries of Eastern Europe — East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hun¬ gary, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria — and with their transformation into pluralist or pseudopluralist systems. I decided largely to exclude Albania from examination because until the latter half of 1990 it did not share for the most part in the patterns of change sweeping the rest of the area and because it has been largely cut off from any interaction with the other countries of the region. Some brief comments on Albania appear in chapter 15. My idea in writing this book was that diverse social currents (mainly ethnic, religious, trade unionist, civic, feminist, musical-cultural, and youth) do not exist in isolation; on the contrary, they overlap, interact, and often follow parallel lines of development. I wanted to bring out this interrelationship and to show how changing social currents present political authorities with policy challenges, indeed with challenges that may bear on the fundamental questions of governance: system legiti¬ macy and system stability. The phenomena described herein are of dif¬ ferent levels of significance. To take the extremes, Solidarity has been a force for major system change in Poland, while Yugoslav feminists are relatively marginal. Both, however, are symptomatic of changing attitudes and changing behaviors. Interviews have been important for the research for several chapters, in particular, chapters 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10. Interviews were conducted over an eight-year period, from 1982 through 1989: in Belgrade (1982, 1987, 1988, 1989), Ljubljana (1982, 1987, 1989), Zagreb (1982, 1987, 1989), Sara¬ jevo (1982, 1989), Munich (1987), Rome (1987), Vienna (1987), East Berlin xii Preface to the First Edition (1988), Leipzig (1988), Dresden (1988), Halle (1988), Erfurt (1988), Eise¬ nach (1988), and Skopje (1989). I am indebted to the American Council of Learned Societies and to the International Research Exchanges Board (irex) for providing funding for the 1982 and 1988 research trips, and to irex and the Graduate School Research Fund of the University of Washington for providing funding for the 1989 research trip. I am deeply indebted to Laszlo Kiirti, who read the entire manuscript and provided helpful suggestions for its improvement. I am also indebted to Chris Bettinger, my research assistant, who assisted with the research for chapter 4, and to Robin Alison Remington, Darko Glavan, and Law¬ rence W. Lerner for their comments on earlier drafts of chapters 7, 10, and 14, respectively. I am also very grateful to Dan Beck and Clark Sorensen, who translated some material from Czech and Korean sources, cited in chapter 6. I also wish to thank Helena Ott, Piotr Jankowski, Carolyn Kadas, and Michelle Arneaux for checking the diacritical marks for Czech, Polish, Hungarian, and Romanian names, and to the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies of the University of Washing¬ ton for providing a small grant for that purpose. Finally, I would like to thank Whit Mason, who helped to proofread the final page proofs. Earlier versions of chapters 3, 8, and 10 were previously published in World Politics, the Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism, and Survey, respectively. A portion of chapter 9 was previously published as part of a study appearing in Osteuropa. I am grateful to the editors of these journals for their permission to reuse this material. This has been a difficult book to write insofar as events in Eastern Europe have been moving at a breakneck pace recently. The initial drafts of chapters 2— 11 and 14 were completed in October 1988 and pointed to the building pressures for regionwide political change, but of neces¬ sity they had to be updated and revised. Chapters 12 and 13 were added in November 1989. When the book was finally cleared for publication in June 1990, I decided to update much of the text but to make only the slightest changes in chapter 2. Chapter 14 had to be substantially rewritten at that time, while chapter 15 is new. Finally, a personal note: While working on this book, I have been wres¬ tling with issues of my own. In December 1989, after years of recurrent depression and crisis, which reached a particular intensity at that time, I decided to begin the slow process of changing my physical sex in order to bring it into harmony with my psychic gender. While this has opened up feelings of euphoria and self-contentment surpassing anything I had ever experienced before, it has also presented me with continued chal- Preface to the First Edition xiii lenges.

Aspects of the Transition from Authoritarianism to Pluralism Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state is not far off; but if the law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state. — plato, The Laws, ji$d This book is about change and the forces of change. At the most basic level it takes one side in a long-standing but rarely conceded covert debate between, on the one hand, those who take a mechanistic ap¬ proach, lodging the causes of change primarily (or in some cases, even exclusively) in statistically measurable increases in popular political par¬ ticipation, declines in industrial production, changes in the number of people existing below the poverty line, and so forth, and, on the other hand, those who take a more phenomenological approach — in the sense in which Jean-Paul Sartre and Maurice Merleau-Ponty use the term — and who trace social changes ultimately, and in the first place, to changes in people's thinking, recognizing that such changes may be produced either by substantive changes in real terms or by elite manipulation of media images or by religious conversion or by other factors or by a com¬ bination of these. For the phenomenological school, thus, if a population is completely unaware of any change in its material well-being, then sta¬ tistical indicators of \"real\" economic decline will not point to any drift toward social chaos or protest, all other things being equal. This book is firmly phenomenological in thrust (in the sense indicated), despite the citation of extensive statistical indices of economic decline in chapter 2. The book's central arguments may be stated as such: (1) The pressures for change in Eastern Europe built up over years because of the com- 4 Social Currents in Eastern Europe munist regimes' inability to solve the central problem of legitimation, and these pressures found multivarious outlets — in culture, in religious organizations, even in rock music, while simultaneously exciting ten¬ sions along latent axes such as those of an ethnic nature (as in Kosovo) or of a class nature (the Polish trade union Solidarity being a case in point). (2) The regimes' inability to quash incipient reflections of these pressures led to a proliferation of such pressures, as one success (even if only temporary) in dissident activity encouraged other efforts. (3) Be¬ cause of this relationship among social forces, serious political com¬ plaints and demands could be read first in more \"sanguine\" contexts, allowing political observers to predict the ultimate upheaval without being able to determine its exact timing. (Among those who predicted the ultimate collapse of communism in the region were Ernst Kux in 1980, 1 George Schopflin repeatedly in the early 1980s,2 Dimitry Pospie- lovsky in 1987, 3 Ivan Volgyes in 1987, 4 and William C. Fletcher,5 while this book was itself undertaken in early 1988 with the original purpose of demonstrating that dramatic political change had become unavoid¬ able.) And (4) although often described as a revolution for democracy, the political shift that became explicit in 1989 and that resulted in the removal of the old communist elites everywhere but in Serbia, was a revolution — and I shall insist on that word — against communism, but not necessarily with the same understanding throughout the region and among different actors as to what programs and institutions should be established;6 it also has opened a Pandora's Box of troubles, ranging from the challenges of institution-building, to the perils of privatization, to a new strength for chauvinism — whether of an ethnic, religious, or sexist stripe — to the disintegration of the preexisting state community, as in the cases of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. These \"troubles\" directly threaten aspirations to create and legitimate a stable democratic order anywhere in the region. Although I have been emphasizing the impact that social and eco¬ nomic pressures may have on political outcomes, and the procreative energy of changes in social values and beliefs, I would nonetheless agree with Rustow's caution that \"not all causal links run from social and economic to political factors,\" and \"not all causal links run from beliefs and attitudes to actions.\"7 The point is rather that there is a reciprocal and organic relationship among political, social, and economic factors, so that perturbations in one sphere are apt to have repercussions and reflections and effects in other spheres. The book's theoretical presuppositions involve five components, to From Authoritarianism to Pluralism 5 be reviewed in this chapter: (1) a theory as to which factors make for political decay and system collapse (based largely on the writings of Crane Brinton, Ted Robert Gurr, Adam Przeworski, James C. Davies, and Herbert Blumer); (2) a theoretical mapping of the dynamics, pace, and phases of transition from authoritarian/totalitarian rule to plural¬ ism (drawn from work by Guillermo O'Donnell and Philippe Schmitter); (3) formulation of a working definition of democracy, followed by a theo¬ retical construct of the necessary preconditions of democracy (which will be set forth against a discussion of the writings of Robert A. Dahl, Barry Holden, Dankwart Rustow, Terry Lynn Karl, Giuseppe Di Palma, Valerie Bunce, and others); (4) an elaboration of the differences between a \"strong\" society and a \"weak\" society and an assessment of their im¬ portance for considerations of system vulnerability to change (derived directly from the ideas explored under point 1 ); and ( 5 ) a theory about the weakness of new systems and about the relationship between political decay and civil strife (inspired by Crane Brinton and Samuel P. Hunting- ton and based, in part, on previous work of mine). 1. When Do Systems Collapse? (That Is, Why?) In his classic study of revolutionary processes Crane Brinton outlined seven factors that rendered a system vulnerable to collapse or overthrow.8 These are (1) economic deterioration; (2) the mobilization of new groups; (3) the defection of the intellectuals; (4) inefficiency and corruption in the system; (5) the loss of credibility by the regime,- (6) the loss of self- confidence by the ruling elite and the appearance of fissures and factions within that elite; and (7) the inept use of force. This book was originally launched in early 1988 in the belief that these seven measures could serve as a guide to assessing the prospects for the collapse or overthrow of the communist regimes in the region. Of the seven factors, three are explicitly subjective in character (num¬ bers 5, 6, 7), depending entirely on what either the society or the elite (or both) may think about the given issue. A fourth factor — economic deterioration (number 1) — is also latently subjective, because, as Gurr reminds us, its capacity to frame and shape political choices depends entirely on its perception and construal — what Gurr calls relative depri¬ vation.9 Adam Przeworski has similarly laid stress on collective percep¬ tion as the mediating variable between objective conditions and system vulnerabilities.10 The remaining factors on Brinton 's list (2, 3, and 4) have a more \"objective\" character, although the importance that corruption 6 Social Currents in Eastern Europe (factor 4) has is also ultimately a matter of collective subjectivity; to put it another way, if nobody cares about corruption, it is not politically important. The transition from an authoritarian system to a pluralist system does not come about as the result of a sudden snap. Even revolution is an evo¬ lutionary process, which unfolds over years through definable phases. In the first phase, there is the organization of underground resistance, the creation of the political alternative, which, as Przeworski notes, is the ultimate sine qua non of revolution.\" This phase necessarily involves years, because the resistance needs time first to build itself, and sec¬ ond, to prove itself. The process involves the establishment of a network of committees at central, district, and town levels, and the establish¬ ment of secure underground channels of communication. The process in contemporary authoritarian systems is the same whether one speaks of post-1980 Poland or Iran in the 1970s or certain Latin American coun¬ tries in the 1970s and early 1980s or the organization of the Resistance in Vichy France.12 As long as the regime can break up opposition cells and arrest their members, severely restricting the circulation of opposition publications, the regime remains in this first phase, and it is not in danger of collapse. It is when the regime loses the ability to control its political environ¬ ment that the system may be said to have entered into its second phase: regime deterioration. As Baloyra points out: Deterioration is the loss by an incumbent government of its ability to cope with the policy agenda, particularly the two key concerns of political economy — security and prosperity — and other salient issues of high symbolic appeal to the public. Deterioration is the situation in which governments find themselves when they are un¬ able to conjugate minimally acceptable levels of efficacy, effective¬ ness, and legitimacy.13 This phase is likely to stretch over years, although its most telling mo¬ ments are often compressed in a few months. Finally, the society reaches a threshold, at which real change suddenly seems irreversible. James Davies has underlined the importance of this factor — the expectancy of change — and I have therefore added it as factor 8 among the measures applied in the next chapter.14 However this expectancy is triggered — whether by internal developments (e.g., the dramatic roundtable talks in Poland in late 1988) or by external events (e.g., the deep impression that changes in the GDR, Poland, and Czechoslovakia had on the Bui- From Authoritarianism to Pluralism 7 garian elite and public in late 1989) — it signals the society's arrival at a moment of climax. Now someone might object that this sketch assumes something that cannot be proved, namely, that all peoples want democracy and that it is only a question of building up societal strength in order for everyone to eventually live under democratic systems. In short, it might seem that I am making some assumptions close to those made by Francis Fukuyama in his essay on the \"end of history.\"15 And to these supposed assump¬ tions it may be objected that no automatic connection can be shown between the strength of a society and its proclivity to democracy. To this, I reply that democracy in its Western form maximizes certain values, but there are other values that, in given contexts, may be better served by other systems. Hence, while no society would freely say \"Let us be oppressed,\" a society may, all the same, freely choose an authoritarian system, and, in any case, it cannot be assumed that democratic systems are always best suited to accomplishing whatever tasks may confront given societies. That said, it is a historical fact that the development of democracy came, in part, as a response to the rise of strong urban centers in which, by comparison with the countryside, information circulated more rapidly and people more commonly came into contact with other cultures and points of view, thus creating pressures for tolerance and for a \"liberal\" solution. 2. Phases of Transition As Josep Colomer points out, about one out of every three contemporary democracies is the product of a transition from an authoritarian system undertaken since 1973. The chief regions affected by these processes have been Southern Europe (in the mid-1970s), Latin America (in the mid-1980s), and Eastern Europe (since the late 1980s).16 This large num¬ ber of cases, from diverse social settings, permits us to inquire whether any parallels or uniformities can be found in the processes of transition. Between 1979 and 1981 the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, in Washington, D.C., was host to a series of meetings and conferences entitled \"Transitions from Authoritarian Rule: Prospects for Democracy in Latin America and Southern Europe.\" Organized by Guillermo O'Donnell, Philippe C. Schmitter, and Laurence Whitehead, the project took up the question we are examining here and eventually resulted in the publication of a four-volume collection.17 In the conclud¬ ing volume O'Donnell and Schmitter outline what they take to be the 8 Social Currents in Eastern Europe typical features of transitions from authoritarianism. Based on South European and Latin American cases, these features seem strikingly apt in describing the disintegration of communist rule in Eastern Europe. As these authors note, authoritarian regimes create an illusion of \"social peace\" and \"tacit consensus\" by destroying the possibility for un¬ official political activity. That the illusion is successful can be illustrated by recalling the fuss made in the West about the so-called Kadar formula in the mid-1970s and by perennial suggestions that people had become reconciled to their supposed \"fate,\" and perhaps even that they had been socialized to \"prefer\" communism. But, in fact, this ostensible \"social contract\" rests largely on force— or on the absence of alternatives — and hence, \"once the government signals that it is lowering the costs for engaging in [alternative) collective action and is permitting some con¬ testation on issues previously declared off limits, these regimes quickly discover that the so-called peace and consensus were, at best, part of an imposed armistice.\"18 Artists, performers, intellectuals, and other \"exemplary individuals\" are the first to express open opposition to authoritarian rule, as O'Donnell and Schmitter note.19 One need only think of Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia, or of many other examples documented in this book, to see the parallel in Eastern Europe. And inevitably, in a system that as¬ pires to dictate what is proper (or \"correct\") and what is not, \"even such apparently trivial things as dress or gesture may become generalized acts of defiance\"20 — a point stressed by Volgyes in a 1978 work.21 The skepticism of some social scientists notwithstanding, the brave souls who first remove the leader's picture from the store window22 or who first sign a manifesto that no one is allowed to read but everyone is expected to condemn23 are viewed not as mentally unbalanced (as the regimes often pretend), but as courageous, highly moral persons. It is for this reason that \"when the transition is launched, human rights organizations and activists emerge with enormous moral authority. This provides them with a large audience for their eloquent critique of the au¬ thoritarian regime, a critique that inevitably spills over to include politi¬ cal and social rights which only democracy can reliably guarantee.\"24 The rapidity with which political chaos opened up demands for demo¬ cratic reforms — whether in Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, or Poland in 1980 — and the proliferation of groups in Eastern Europe in the mid-1980s that seemed to demand \"the impossible,\" confirmed the continued inability of the communist systems to convert the illusion of consensus into the reality of consensus. They also underscored the growing vulnerability of these regimes to social pressure,- that their vul- From Authoritarianism to Pluralism 9 nerability was growing was obvious to at least some observers. Whether it would reach the point of \"all or nothing\" was another matter. The recurrence of demands for democracy betrayed the failure of socialization, the failure of the communist regimes to implant their values in the population. According to O'Donnell and Schmitter: it is therefore hardly surprising that an enormous backlog of anger and conflict accumulates during (the period of rule by] these au¬ thoritarian regimes and that, as soon as it becomes possible to do so, this results in an explosion of worker demands. Many such demands focus on matters of immediate satisfaction — higher wages, better working conditions, less arbitrary policies of hiring and firing — - but others aim at creating (or recreating) institutions for class rep¬ resentation: freedom of association, the right to strike, collective bargaining. . . .25 But as long as the regime can lock up the troublemakers and reimpose discipline, the most it has to fear is occasional temporary breakdown. The critical threshold that transforms the entire political landscape, as Przeworski wrote in 1986, is the creation of a coherent political alter¬ native. Until such an alternative is created, the regime may well seem indestructible. \"A regime does not collapse unless and until some alter¬ native is organized in such a way as to present a real choice for isolated individuals,\" according to Przeworski.26 What O'Donnell, Schmitter, Whitehead, and their collaborators under¬ stood in 1986 is that opposition politics in an authoritarian system functions as if in a pressure cooker. Once an organized and articulate opposition exists, the most natural path is toward the eventual col¬ lapse of the existing political order. Whether the society then moves along one of a number of alternative trajectories toward something we might call democracy,27 or whether, amid frustrated efforts to introduce democracy, the society lunges into chaos and eventually slides back into authoritarianism,28 the \"moment of truth\" itself is unavoidable. Almost without exception, this moment of truth takes the form of a popular upsurge. The only exception is the hasty organization of free elections at a time of duress (for example, at the end of a disastrous war), leading to an overwhelming victory by the opposition. A good example of this alternative path is Bulgaria in 1919, when, after the setbacks of World War I, the king abdicated in favor of his son, and the radical Peasant Party swept the elections, bringing to power peasant leader Alexander Stamboliiski 29 The popular upsurge tends to bring together diverse sectors of society 10 Social Currents in Eastern Europe and to weld them into a single, self-perceived group: \"Trade unions, grass-roots movements, religious groups, intellectuals, artists, clergy¬ men, defenders of human rights, and professional associations all sup¬ port each other's efforts toward democratization and coalesce into a greater whole which identifies itself as \"the people\" — o povo, el pueblo, 11 popolo, le peuple, ho laos.\"i0 This would be most graphically played out in East Germany where, in late 1989, literally hundreds of thou¬ sands of people swarmed onto the streets of Berlin, Leipzig, and Dresden, chanting, “Wir sind das Volk!\" — \"We are the people!\" The upsurge typically causes the old order to snap. But in spite of this superficial suddenness of the result, the disintegration of an au¬ thoritarian order tends to be a drawn-out process, which unfolds simul¬ taneously with the gradual emergence of a democratic alternative, the reconstruction of civil society from below.51 The foregoing outline, drawn from materials written in 1979-81 and published in 1986, provides a kind of road map outlining the path of political decay, and the extent to which events in Eastern Europe from 1986 until 1989 actually followed the routes charted suggests (1) that political processes follow some universal laws that are knowable; (2) that predictions of the ultimate collapse of the communist order were truer to the theoretical literature than were predictions of the indefinite con¬ tinuation of the status quo (an impossibility founded largely on a mis¬ reading of the American experience); and (3) that those scholars (named above) who did predict ultimate political collapse of the communist order had good theoretical-scientific reasons for doing so. In fact, many observers were aware of the direction in which the East European com¬ munist systems were moving; what could not be predicted precisely was the exact moment that this would occur, because this depended on the appropriate trigger, and \"triggers\" are always accidents of history. In the actual event, the trigger that brought Eastern Europe's communist house of cards crashing down was the Hungarian authorities' decision, in the late spring of 1989, to open their borders. And yet, the direction in which things were moving was clear enough. In September 1976, Adam Bromke forecast that \"sooner or later, for eco¬ nomic reasons, food prices [in Poland] will have to be increased. This, however, is likely to lead to new strikes and conceivably even to a large- scale workers' rebellion.\"32 In March 1980, Ernst Kux anticipated the events of 1989, writing that if Poland and other East European coun¬ tries failed to quickly come to grips with the need for serious economic reform, the resulting crises could spark social unrest and \"upheavals could develop in a number or all of the East European countries more From Authoritarianism to Pluralism n or less simultaneously.\"33 George Schopflin, for his part, was writing in the early 1980s about the political decay of communist systems — a de¬ cay that could have only one conceivable ultimate stage 34 Or again, J. F. Brown, in a 1984 essay, predicted accurately that \"the Polish experience may have begun a gradual shift in power relationships within the com¬ munist system.\"35 Or again, Ivan Volgyes, in a 1987 essay, accurately assessed that Fiungary was on the brink of a political \"storm.\"36 Or again, Annali Gabanyi, a researcher at Munich's Siidost Institut, announced as early as September 1988 that Ceau§escu's days were numbered.37 Or again, Brigitte Schulz predicted in early 1989 the imminent end of com¬ munism in the GDR. Or again, Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote prophetically in early 1989: \"It is almost a certainty that at some point in the relatively near future, given some major economic or political upheaval, politics as the expression of authentic social aspiration for multiparty democracy will return to the life of Eastern Europe.\"38 And for that matter, there was my own early warning in 1984 of Yugoslavia's gradual drift toward civil war,39 and my subsequent prediction in February 1991 that civil war in that country was only a matter of weeks away.40 Or, for that matter, Jacek Kuron, the Solidarity adviser, declared rather significantly in Feb¬ ruary 1988 (two months before major strikes rocked the country): \"The specter of a social explosion is haunting the country.\"41 I could continue to add examples, but the point is clear enough; in Niko Tos's words: \"with respect to the changes so far, their peaceful course [aside from Yugoslavia] and the moment of their occurrence have been unexpected, but not the changes themselves.\"42 Given this impressive record of rather prophetic analyses, it is sur¬ prising to find the usually more sagacious Timothy Garton Ash writing in 1990: \"The events of 1989 in Eastern Europe . . . [are] a powerful argument for never again writing about the future. No one predicted them.\"43 Against this unwarranted (and even solipsistic) pessimism, I would counter that just because some scholars failed to see the tea leaves at the bottom of their cups — or worse yet, to take them seriously — does not mean that we should not offer prognoses about the likely success or failure of individual East European countries in their efforts to de¬ mocratize (as I did in 1992 in an article for Orbis ),44 or that we should not develop arguments for pessimism about the prospects of the Soviet successor states, and Russia in particular, of avoiding growing chaos and civil strife and ultimate relapse into authoritarian rule (as I did elsewhere in 1992), 45 or that we should not offer prognoses about the most promis¬ ing strategies of democratization for postcommunist states (as Juan Linz and Alfred Stepan did so well in yet another 1992 publication) 46 The fact 12 Social Currents in Eastern Europe that many persons have taken to citing Ash's comment approvingly only shows to what extent many scholars fail to keep up with the writings of other scholars. 3. Democracy — Definitions and Preconditions As Barry Holden notes, there are two related and persistent tendencies (i) either to dismiss as unnecessary any proposal to set forth a defini¬ tion of democracy, on the grounds that we all know what democracy is, or (2) to take as constitutive those elements that resemble features found in systems that we take for granted as being democracies. Holden argues that these tendencies are pernicious — and I agree with him — not only because people inevitably differ as to which states belong in the \"democratic\" set, but more importantly, because in the absence of a clear expostulation of what is meant by the term, articulate observers may have in mind entirely different values when talking about \"democ¬ racies,\" and thus they may emphasize entirely different institutions as necessary safeguards for their cherished values.47 Of course, almost as many definitions of democracy exist as there are democratic theorists. Many of these theorists favor a strongly structural definition, that is, they believe that a democracy means that certain structures or institutions exist. An example of what I have in mind is offered by Philippe Schmitter and Terry Lynn Karl: \"Modern political democracy is a system of governance in which rulers are held account¬ able for their actions in the public realm, by citizens, acting indirectly through the competition and cooperation of their elected representa¬ tives.\"48 Here, accountability is the value to be safeguarded, and the structural mechanisms specified are elections and competitive politics. Larry Diamond offers a similar approach: Democracy is, by its nature, a system of institutionalized competi¬ tion for power. Without competition and conflict, there is no democ¬ racy. But any society that sanctions political conflict runs the risk of its becoming too intense, producing a society so conflict-ridden that civil peace and political stability are jeopardized. Hence the para¬ dox: Democracy requires conflict— but not too much; competition there must be, but only within carefully defined and universally accepted boundaries. Cleavage must be tempered by consensus.49 No explicit statement is made here as to the value or values to be safe¬ guarded, but the structural dimension is clear enough. There are also structural definitions with a highly detailed charac- From Authoritarianism to Pluralism 13 ter, such as the following overly elaborate definition by H. V. Wiseman (published in 1966): Political democracy is the regime of civilian rule through represen¬ tative institutions and public liberties. Its components are first, a legislative body periodically elected by universal (adult or male) suf¬ frage, empowered to initiate legislation . . . and to exact or repeal legislation initiated by the executive. The latter is subject to review and control. . . . The executive carries out its policies through a hierarchically organized nonpolitical bureaucracy. . . . Candidates for the legislature are normally members of contend¬ ing political parties. . . . Executive and legislative action is subject to periodic review through free elections, as well as being continually scrutinized by free organs of public opinion. Within the legislature, opposition and minority rights are guaranteed, and governments can be changed by regularized procedures of election. . . .50 For Wiseman, thus, universal male suffrage is sufficient to warrant call¬ ing a system a democracy, but universal female suffrage would not be; incorporating sexism into the very definition or understanding of democ¬ racy in this way can only suggest that Wiseman is unable to distinguish between a posteriori and a priori. Aside from the rather obvious re¬ sultant idiocy in suggesting that females are definitionally inessential to democracy, Wiseman's definition is flawed by its conflation of sup¬ posed necessary conditions with defining characteristics — a conflation to which all overly elaborate definitions are vulnerable. Interestingly enough, none of the foregoing definitions make any refer¬ ence to majority rule, whether because the writers consider the principle entailed in the concepts of accountability or competition or elections, or because they consciously choose to place their emphasis elsewhere. On the other hand, Norberto Bobbio, the prominent Italian political theorist, places his stress squarely on majority rule. For him, \"it is im¬ possible to ever understand anything about democracy until it is realized that a democratic system nowadays signifies first and foremost a set of procedural rules, among which majority rule is the main, but not the only one.\"51 Although all of these definitions point to facets of democracy that are rather salient, I prefer a more cultural definition of democracy, treat¬ ing its institutionalization and structure as practical (i.e., derivative) rather than definitional questions. I propose the following definition: A democracy is a system based on the principles of political choice and social tolerance. Flere one has an explicit declaration of values, with 14 Social Currents in Eastern Europe their realization being deferred to discussions of preconditions. That this definition is Madisonian in spirit — recall Madison's concerns to protect minorities from \"the tyranny of the majority\" — should be obvious. This definition has the advantage of avoiding the all-or-nothing fallacy that may be associated with some structuralist approaches. Thus, it per¬ mits one to say, the more political choice and the more social tolerance one finds in a given society, the more democratic it is; and conversely, the less political choice or the less social tolerance one finds, the less democratic a society is. I replaced \"and\" with \"or\" in the negative cor¬ relation to emphasize that both values are necessary conditions for the successful functioning of a democracy. What this means, in practice, is that even the existence of signifi¬ cantly different political alternatives, together with the accountability of elected officials through regular free elections, counts for nothing if the political mainstream is dominated by intolerant attitudes, and by the same virtue, that democracies are literally placed under siege when¬ ever socially intolerant groups (such as antiabortion activists) succeed in imposing their agendas on the entire society — regardless of whether elections and competition continue. Or, to put it in a few words, there is no such thing as a democracy without social tolerance. Now no intrinsic moral judgment attaches itself to this definition of democracy. Whether one considers democracy — defined as I have done, or defined some other way— a good system depends on which values one thinks the given system strives to protect, how well the system does so, and what one thinks of the given protected values in the first place. Hence, if one believes — as I do — that social tolerance is the most important value to safeguard, and that political choice is positive only insofar as it safeguards social tolerance, then one may well find some authoritarian systems, governed by benevolent despots, that are more effective in protecting the value of tolerance than some structurally plu¬ ralist systems — at least for the life span of the given despot. As Aristotle noted two millennia ago, the best system is rule by a benevolent des¬ pot; but the worst system is rule by a malevolent despot. On the face of it, authoritarianism could offer more than democracy, but the risks of malfunctioning and of subversion are far greater in authoritarian than in democratic systems. On this point, Plato and Aristotle agree. Now to say that tolerance is the most important value is not to say it is the only important value. As Budziszewski aptly expressed it, \"Tolerance is a virtue indeed; but if it is the only virtue, it can hardly be anything more than good conscience in our continuing lack of convictions.\"52 lust what, then, is tolerance? When I use the word, I mean three things: first, From Authoritarianism to Pluralism 15 a respect for difference and an allowance that different people may have legitimate differences of need, custom, belief, and behavior; second, the acceptance that the basis for assessing to what extent needs, customs, beliefs, and behaviors may be worthy of toleration or not is the criterion of harm to human or animal life; and third, acceptance of the principle that there is an important operational difference between universal rea¬ son and restricted associational assent in defining what is and is not morality. What I mean by this last point is that we may take it as a given that almost all people can arrive at the conclusion that murder is wrong by pure reason; the exceptions that may be cited are not, I would argue, significant. On the other hand, in practice, one cannot say the same thing about abortion; on the contrary, the belief that abortion is morally repre¬ hensible in all instances is largely restricted to persons associated with specific religious bodies (and often to people living in specific regions, for example, the rural American South). Hence, when a moral minority (such as antiabortion activists) attempts to impose its moral norms on a society as a whole, a tolerant person will oppose that minority. Toler¬ ance, in short, does not mean anything goes; and it certainly does not mean a tolerance of intolerance. Insofar as I tie toleration to the criterion of harm to human or animal life, I am connecting it with the notion of Natural Law (which itself entails the aforementioned concept of Universal Reason).53 \"True toler¬ ance\" — to borrow Budziszewski's elegant term — accords respect to such customs, beliefs, and behaviors as do not harm human or animal life; whatever does harm to life, to any living being — whether physical harm, psychological harm, or harm of any other kind — without just cause, is unworthy of toleration. But why tolerance in the first place? Why not allow powerful ma¬ jorities far-reaching capacity to dictate social norms and practices? His¬ torically, two competing democratic traditions arose between the seven¬ teenth and eighteenth centuries: the French tradition (exemplified by Sieyes and Rousseau) and the Anglo-American tradition (exemplified by Hobbes, Locke, and J. S. Mill). The French tradition defined democracy in terms of the successful assertion of the general will and held that individual wills at variance with the general will had no validity, and were therefore unworthy of toleration. Talmon calls this tradition totali¬ tarian democracy ,54 The Anglo-American tradition, by contrast, defined democracy in terms of the acceptance of opposition and debate.55 But if opposition is to have any meaning, it must be premised on the guaran¬ tee of the autonomy of individual actors. This is why in seeking to lay the ideological groundwork for democracy, eighteenth-century English 1 6 Social Currents in Eastern Europe liberals were so concerned to protect the autonomy of individuals.56 But as Joseph Raz has noted, \"a commitment to autonomy entails a commit¬ ment to moral pluralism,\" and respect for others' autonomy entails the duty of toleration.57 It is sometimes argued that toleration further entails \"ethical neu¬ trality\" or the abdication of any presumption to know the difference between right and wrong, as if tolerant people should model their behav¬ ior on that of sociopaths. Both Budziszewski and Raz deny the validity of this inference, with Raz arguing further that nothing about the principle of toleration binds a government to an \"anti-perfectionist\" stance.58 Democracies may be improved in various ways. Two ways that occur to me are: by incorporating women into the political system on a fully equal basis with men; and by making substantive, rather than procedu¬ ral, justice a central concern, and in association with this, by resisting the temptation to subordinate the interests of society (e.g., society's need for safety) to the supposed \"rights\" of individuals (e.g., the \"right\" of recidivists to parole). On the first of these points, however, no society in recorded history has treated women fully equally, and the history of humankind may quite fairly be understood, in part, as the history of variations in the subordination of women.59 It is tempting to argue that given this appalling record, there have never been any \"democracies\" worthy of the name. But if we were to succumb to this temptation, we should just have to devise a term to cover the cases presently called \"democratic.\" It seems wiser to keep the traditional term and merely note the shortcomings of such (and all other) systems. As for the second point, there is more variation here. It is the United States, as Frank Coleman has argued, that has most completely en¬ shrined the Hobbesian philosophy and, in the process, gone further than other systems in subordinating the interests of society to the interests of individuals.60 Yet, since the early 1980s, a number of West European and South European states have restructured their systems, in ways that bring them closer to the American model. A definition of democracy helps us understand what we think a democ¬ racy should look like. It does not tell us how we get there. To have a notion about how one gets to a democracy is to have a notion about the ingredients, or as I prefer to call them, the preconditions of democracy. Inevitably, opinions on this subject have varied dramatically. The most cynical view is probably that taken by Terry Lynn Karl, who wrote off the quest for democratic preconditions as \"futile.\" In his view, \"what the lit¬ erature has considered in the past to be the preconditions of democracy may be better conceived in the future as the outcomes of democracy.\"61 Karl concludes that the only recurrent patterns are to be found in these From Authoritarianism to Pluralism 17 outcomes, and that there are no patterns in preconditions, indeed, no preconditions at all. And if there are no preconditions for democracy, then it would follow that democracy can be established anywhere, at any time, by any set of leaders, and have equal chances of success — including, for example, in the middle of a genocidal civil war, as the economy plummets, and chauvinistic hate propaganda colors the atmo¬ sphere. (I am thinking here of Serbia since 1991 . ) Few scholars are willing to tread this path. For most, it is taken as a given that there are some preconditions, or prerequisites, for democratization. Leaving aside Karl's ostentatiously deviant opinion, the recent writ¬ ings of most American sociologists and political scientists dealing with democratic preconditions fall into one of four broad categories. First, there are those who emphasize economic and social precondi¬ tions, such as widespread literacy, significant urban population, and gen¬ eral prosperity. Seymour Martin Lipset and Philip Cutright are among analysts in this group.62 Usually, it is assumed that if economic pros¬ perity is a precondition, then it must precede the establishment of a democratic system. Giuseppe Di Palma reverses the order, however, and argues that having chosen democracy — the sense in which that is true being the subject of chapter 16 — East European societies will necessarily create free markets, which, presumably, will lay the basis for an economy capable of sustaining democracy.63 The second group comprises those who favor an emphasis on the cultural preconditions of democracy. The classic work here is Almond and Verba's 1963 study, The Civic Culture, which outlined a syndrome of ideal attitudes and dispositions to which the authors assigned the label given in the title.64 Larry Diamond, another analyst in this tradi¬ tion, includes these elements among the constituent parts of democratic political culture: \"tolerance of opposition and dissent; trust in fellow political actors; a willingness to cooperate, accommodate, and compro¬ mise,- and hence, a certain flexibility, moderation, civility, and restraint in one's partisanship.\"65 Certainly, if these ingredients are essential to democracy, then several postcommunist states in Eastern Europe (most obviously Slovakia and Romania, let alone Croatia and Serbia) are off to a bad start. Back in 1942, at the end of Eastern Europe's first troubled efforts to in¬ stitute democracy, Hugh Seton-Watson argued that \"the most essential condition . . . for the establishment of democratic Government in East¬ ern Europe is an improvement and intensification of general Education. This means not only the education of youth, but the raising of the tone of the press, literature, and all forms of expression of public opinion.\"66 In practice, governing authorities have often taken the emphasis on 18 Social Currents in Eastern Europe education and democratic political culture very much to heart. After World War II, for example, Allied occupation authorities in Germany, Austria, and Japan undertook systematic efforts to purge persons with a Nazi or fascist past from the media and the schools, to establish detailed guidelines for public radio and to monitor understanding and compli¬ ance, to restrict newspaper licenses to \"reliable democratic publishers,\" to reorient the press (in Germany) to give more attention to worldwide and nationwide news and less to local news, to introduce a reportorial style in journalism, and to revise the textbooks and teaching methods in the schools.67 The third group comprises those who demand the satisfaction of cer¬ tain situational preconditions. Lipset, already listed under group i, also fits here, through his argument that widespread political apathy is sup¬ portive of democracy and that extensive political interest is in fact harm¬ ful.68 The argument offered by Rabushka and Shepsle in 1972, 69 that ethnic fragmentation is not conducive to democratic politics, is also in this group. A somewhat different emphasis, but still of a \"situational\" nature, is the widespread understanding that a basic agreement on the rules of the game is essential to the stability of a democratic system — or, I would argue, in fact to the long-term stability of any system.70 Finally, some theorists prefer to stress institutional and structural preconditions. Robert Dahl, for example, has produced a list of \"mini¬ mal\" procedural conditions for modern political democracy to function. His list enumerates seven elements — among them, regular elections, near-universal adult suffrage, the right of citizens to run for office, the existence of alternative sources of information, freedom of political as¬ sociation, and freedom of speech.71 Valerie Bunce places her emphasis elsewhere, stressing four central ingredients: a representative govern¬ ment chosen in free elections, a depoliticized bureaucracy functioning according to written rules, the rule of law, and legal guarantees of basic rights.72 And Robert Moss, looking more broadly to the preconditions for the rule of law, has suggested the following minimal preconditions (quoted in full): 1. An independent judiciary to which appeal is allowed from admin¬ istrative decisions, and of universal laws transcending the aims of governments. 2. Freedom from arbitrary arrest, which should mean that even under martial law or a state of emergency (where the authorities would be empowered to exercise special powers of arrest and detention) there should be a legal requirement to present prompt and explicit charges, and a right to appeal, within a specified time, to a superior court. From Authoritarianism to Pluralism 19 3. The right to proper legal representation before a court or tribunal. 4. Appearance before a magistrate or tribunal within a specified length of time. 5. The right to a medical examination before any formal hearing.73 Holden has wisely cautioned that there is no reason — as some theo¬ rists suppose — to believe that the necessary preconditions for democracy must be drawn entirely from one of these sets. On the contrary, there may be a variety of economic, social, cultural, situational, and structural preconditions for the stable functioning of democracy.74 For the purposes of this book, democracy, as I have defined it above, will be seen to require the satisfaction of six situational preconditions and six institutional preconditions. The situational preconditions are (1) a modicum of economic prosperity, sufficient to keep people from rioting; (2) general system stability and the absence or nonpoliticiza¬ tion of profound social polarization; (3) some degree of ethnic harmony; (4) the education of the public in the values of toleration and agreement on the rules of the game; (5) the presence of valued and effective institu¬ tions capable of maintaining civil order,- and (6) the prevalence of a spirit of tolerance. The institutional preconditions are (7) free elections for a popular mandate, with elected officials held responsible to the citizenry; (8) the existence of an effective, independent judiciary; (9) a depoliticized bureaucracy and police functioning according to written rules; (10) legal guarantees (usually of a constitutional nature) of individual autonomy and basic rights; (11) the effective separation of Church and state; and [12) the reliable availability of alternative information, potentially through a free press.75 As before, these preconditions should not be seen as all-or-nothing affairs, either individually or collectively. Rather, they permit us to say, for example, that the fewer legal guarantees of basic rights there are, the less democratic the system is apt to be — though how formal such guarantees need to be is another matter. I would argue that a failure or deficiency in even one of these preconditions, whether situational or institutional, already diminishes the prospects for a stable democracy. And the greater the number of preconditions which are not met, the poorer the chances that a democracy can be established, or if already established, maintained. Now it is sometimes thought that in itemizing preconditions, one is listing elements that must already be present before one even starts to construct a democratic order. On this understanding of the intention of compilations of preconditions for democracy, Myron Weiner urged (in 1987), \"Perhaps it is time to recognize that democratic theory, with its 20 Social Currents in Eastern Europe list of conditions and prerequisites, is a poor guide to action as well.\"76 And in the same spirit, Giuseppe Di Palma has insightfully noted: \"just as the circumstances surrounding the birth of modern democracy were unique, another unique cluster of circumstances could account for the adoption of that same democracy elsewhere — perhaps precisely by dif¬ fusion. . . . Unique circumstances are not the same as requisite cir¬ cumstances, and fortuitous outcomes are not the same as nonrepeatable outcomes.\"7’ And Di Palma went on to argue that the only real precon¬ dition for democracy is the willingness of the major political actors to agree to create such a system. As long as one views the notion of \"preconditions\" in the sense of preexisting factors, then these cautions are necessary corrections. But there is another sense in which one may speak of \"preconditions for democracy,\" namely, in the sense of necessary ingredients if one wishes to reach the desired result. And this is the sense in which I write of such preconditions. To draw an analogy from cooking, it is not necessary that cheese be in the pot before you start to make a French onion soup. But if you intend to produce something recognizable as French onion soup, you will have to add the proper cheese at the right time. And if you intend to produce something recognizable as democracy, you will need to hold free elections, with a choice among candidates. For that matter, Di Palma himself concedes that \"no transition from dictatorship has successfully done away with the market without doing away with the prospects for democracy.\"78 (No cook has successfully done away with onions without doing away with the prospects for producing French onion soup. And similarly, to the objection that one may not need to hold elections in order to have a \"good\" political system, I reply, One does not need onions to have a good soup either, but no onions, no onion soup.) How the postcommunist states of Eastern Europe rank on the scale of these preconditions will be taken up at the end of chapter 16. 4. Strong Society, Weak Society By \"strong society\" I mean a society capable of defending itself against tyranny in whatever form it might take. By a \"weak society\" I mean a society that is not capable of such self-defense. The stronger a society, the less likely it is that tyranny can sustain itself. It follows that where a government is strong and the society weak, the system remains stable regardless of the level of popular contentment or discontent. This combination is the most conducive to tyranny. The combination of weak government with weak society is typical of tradi- From Authoritarianism to Pluralism 21 tional societies, where the government lacks infrastructure, extensive financial and coercive resources, sophisticated information networks, and instruments of propaganda and socialization, and where society itself lacks a highly developed structure or alternative information sources. The combination of strong government with strong society is the standard pattern in contemporary Western democracies, and points to the dual bases for the endurance of liberal systems in England and America. Any of the foregoing are apt to remain stable, as long as exter¬ nal pressures are not brought to bear. But the combination of weak government and strong society is poten¬ tially explosive. Given popular contentment and consensus, a system with this combination of features can survive for a while. But in the absence of popular contentment, a weak government is vulnerable to overthrow and can scarcely be expected to withstand the pressures of mass defection (which is essentially the process that overthrew the gov¬ ernments of the GDR and Czechoslovakia in late 1989). The collapse of a weak government under pressure is no guarantee, however, that a strong government can be constructed to take its place; indeed, the historical record is replete with examples of societies which replace weak gov¬ ernments of one type with weak governments of another type, without assuring stability. I shall take governmental strength to mean: (1) the capacity of the gov¬ ernment to reach a consensus about appropriate action, and its capacity to carry out such actions and to assure that its decrees and laws are executed and enforced; (2) the ability of the government to obtain accu¬ rate information about events and developments in the country; (3) the possession by the government of a developed infrastructure (including advisory bodies), extensive financial and coercive resources, and instru¬ ments of propaganda and socialization; (4) the conviction, on the part of the governing elite, that they are entitled to govern, i.e., that their governance is legitimate; and (5) either clear legitimacy of the system in the population's eyes, or the ability of the government to terrorize, intimidate, and crush any hint of criticism or opposition. On the basis of this understanding, it would seem to follow that by the mid-1980s, the communist systems in Eastern Europe were having problems with factors 1, 4, and 5. I shall take societal strength to entail: (1) access to accurate and indica¬ tive information about social and political processes; (2) the ability to organize autonomous organizations free from government surveillance; (3) an educated public and an independent stance among intellectuals,- (4) access of the public to channels of mass communication not con- 22 Social Currents in Eastern Europe trolled by the government; and (5) the mobilization of the public, by which I mean the public's awareness of issues and engagement in pub¬ lic debate about them. Since these points are developed in extenso in chapter 12, I shall defer further discussion until then. 5. The Weakness of Mew Systems Authoritarian systems tend to collapse according to a predictable pat¬ tern, in which economic deterioration, the decay of political institu¬ tions, challenges posed by religious organizations, a heightened role for the army at certain points in time, and the fragmentation of power all play a role.79 The very factors which provoke the failure of the au¬ thoritarian system, however, set challenges for the incoming elites. In contemporary Eastern Europe, thus, the new elites have had to deal with economic problems, the legacy of partial political decay (and the incre¬ mental nature of system rebuilding), a new feeling of confidence and exultation among churches (with political overtones), worries about the possibility of a coup by the army (in Poland80 and Bulgaria), and the need to legitimate the new order. Legitimation, in turn, requires the acceptance of new values; and the difficulties inherent in this task are most clearly evinced in Germany, where after decades of looking to West Germany with a feeling of kinship, even identity, \"easterners\" (\"Ossis\") now find that their values have become quite different from those of the \"Wessis.\"81 As a result, by mid-1993, only 22 percent of West Germans and only 11 percent of East Germans felt that they shared a common identity; a majority of “Ossis\" (as the easterners have come to be called) \"now tell pollsters they consider themselves 'former citizens of East Germany' rather than part of a unified Germany.\"82 After four decades of communist political monopoly, the initial cry was for \"freedom.\" But as old political and cultural barriers collapse, and with new ones not yet in place, diverse social groups press their cases, and others feel threatened. Throughout Eastern Europe there is rekindled national feeling, prompted not so much by \"liberation\" from communism as by inchoate fears fueled by political uncertainties, eco¬ nomic uncertainties, and (as a result of massive migratory movements) even demographic uncertainties. In the present context the new state-builders of Eastern Europe have conceptualized their present choice as one between a presidential sys¬ tem (the French model) and a parliamentary system (the German model). But as Ken Jowitt reminds us, there is, in fact, a third liberal alterna¬ tive, which he calls liberal authoritarianism. Such a system, he argues, From Authoritarianism to Pluralism 23 might be better equipped to withstand and contain the sundry pressures of religious intolerance, militant nationalism, and neofascist racism that have already created some complications in the region.83 Concluding Remarks I have called the transition associated with 1989 a revolution — in contra¬ distinction to the large number of scholars who have hastened to en¬ dorse Timothy Garton Ash's neologism, refolution. By the latter term, Ash meant to signify that the process of transition combined reformist forms with revolutionary effects. 1 believe that this construal reflects a misunderstanding of what occurred. The events of 1989 were not, in themselves, a revolution, but they were a phase in a longer revolutionary process. As long as one insists that a revolution must be encompassed within a few months, one will not find any revolutions anywhere, at any point in history. Revolutions are complex, multiphased processes, which unfold over time. The actual \"passing of the torch\" from the old elite to the new is only the sym¬ bolic tip of a much larger political iceberg, only the most climactic and symbolically resonant moment in a process which begins years before and which continues for years after. What is distinctive about this latest revolution, as Claus Offe has pointed out, is the relative paucity of co¬ herent thought given before 1989 itself to the positive content of the postcommunist political order;84 the dissidents of pre-1989 spent a lot of time elaborating their thoughts about human rights, and about the need for political pluralism, free markets, and national self-determination, and comparatively little time analyzing how such values might be real¬ ized and protected. It was clear in 1980-81 from events in Poland and from their reper¬ cussions elsewhere in the region85 that revolutionary processes were underway. The ultimate goals and aspirations of the opposition were well-known, as was the deep and widely felt discontent of the popu¬ lations, especially in urban areas. The question was not whether the communist systems would be dismantled, but when. 2. Social Currents and Social Change The pressure for change in Eastern Europe was building for years. It was unrelenting — as reflected in the perennial crises with which local communist elites had to wrestle in the postwar era. By the late 1980s the combination of economic deterioration, political decay, the growing strength of society, the long-term effects of urbanization, the accession of Mikhail Gorbachev to power in the USSR, and other factors made great change inevitable. An early symptom of the coming Great Trans¬ formation was the greater confidence shown by dissidents and religious activists throughout much of the 1980s. Finally, it was the flight of more than 225,000 East Germans to the Federal Republic of Germany in a matter of months in 1989 that spelled the final collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, with immediate effects in the German Democratic Republic, reinforcing pluralizing tendencies in Poland and Flungary, and with ripple effects in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and, in con¬ junction with everything else, Albania. Some could see change coming. For example, in late 1987 Mieczyslaw Rakowski, a member of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party (puwp), wrote a sixty-page report arguing that the entire region was in political crisis and that the communist party would face serious threats unless it \"finds the creative energy, courage, and imagination to free itself of useless ideas and outdated concepts. ... [If it does not do so,] one can assume that in the future our formation will see up¬ heavals and revolutionary outbursts initiated by an increasingly better educated populace.\"1 Impending social and political change became in¬ evitable, but when it arrived, it seemed sudden. After seeming, in the age of Brezhnev, to have succeeded in freezing time, the region now seems to be changing all the more quickly. This book is concerned with the current dynamics of change in East- Social Currents and Social Change 25 ern Europe and with the sources and consequences of change. I shall argue that social and political change is the product of social pressure and can best be understood through an examination of social currents — issue-oriented or group-centered patterns of thought and behavior — such as religious currents, ethno-nationalist currents, political currents among independent activists, feminist currents, and cultural currents among young people. I shall also argue that in several cases, the roots of change go back farther than is apparent at first sight and that the pres¬ sures for change have been multifaceted, interrelated, and more or less comparable throughout the region. The changes that have occurred are no less than revolutionary. In Yugoslavia, for a variety of reasons having more to do with interethnic antagonisms and societal fragmentation, civil war erupted in June 1991. In the following pages I shall outline the vulnerabilities of the area to destabilization and revolutionary change, as they emerged in the late 1980s. These vulnerabilities to destabilization and revolution were symptoms of social and political change and of ensuing structural dis¬ tortions that put pressure on the system to find a new equilibrium. Cultural Drifts and Social Movements There has been a growing awareness in the past two decades that politi¬ cal change cannot be isolated from social change, and that changes in the group consciousness and behavior of people may be symptoms of pervasive changes in institutions, customs, and attitudes. A key element in such changes is change in people's values — what Herbert Blumer calls \"cultural drifts.\"2 Examples of cultural drift in recent decades in¬ clude the increased value placed on health and exercise, the drive for the equality of women, and a heightened concern for the environment and for animal life. In Eastern Europe, examples of recent cultural drift would include a new openness to nontraditional religion (discussed in chapter 6), a new consciousness among urban women (discussed in chap¬ ter 9), a heightened value placed on \"alternative culture\" (discussed, in different aspects, in chapters 3, 4, 5, and 10), and a new drive for genu¬ ine pluralism, epitomized in the drive for independent trade unions and political parties in Poland, Romania, and elsewhere (discussed in chap¬ ters 4, 5, 13, 14, and 15). As cultural drifts occur, they give rise to popular self-conceptions which are at variance with social reality or in tension with political reality. This variance and tension provide the context in which new social movements arise. Blumer defines social movements as \"collective enterprises to estab- 26 Social Currents in Eastern Europe lish a new order of life.\"3 Social movements may be amorphous or highly organized, though they tend to lack organization initially and to acquire more organizational features as they evolve, including hierarchical struc¬ tures and formalized routines. Social movements may be successful or unsuccessful: if successful, their program becomes accepted in society at large and may result in the restructuring of society; if unsuccessful, the movement may adopt a different program, evolve into a \"sect,\" or fall apart. Social movements may be political, religious, or cultural in nature. They may also combine all three aspects like the Hussite move¬ ment in fifteenth-century Czechoslovakia and the Solidarity movement in contemporary Poland. Solidarity has spawned a rich art in which the themes and symbols of labor, pacifism, and religion recur.4 Angela Aidala notes that the exotic new religions which appeared on the American scene in the later 1960s responded to \"the fragmentation of cultural symbol systems\" and to a sense of drift among young people who felt they lacked clear standards for sexual, social, and political be¬ havior.5 They were thus symptoms of social stress associated with a particular phase of development. Cultural drifts occur in specific social and cultural contexts, and may develop in diverse ways. They may reflect the influence of certain activ¬ ist groups (such as feminists or human rights activists), or result from the dissemination of new information or understanding. They may re¬ flect generational shifts due to different formative experiences. They may also be triggered by traumatic or energizing events experienced by the society as historical in a grand sense. An example of the latter is pro¬ vided by the Albanian riots in Kosovo in April 1981, which triggered a Serbian national awakening and drove Serbs to look inward, bemoaning what came to seem like \"hundreds of years of Serbian solitude,\"6 and to draw parallels between the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 (fought between Serbs and Turks) and the new battle for Kosovo in the 1980s and 1990s (pitting Serbs against Albanians).7 Again, cultural drifts may reflect an increase in society's confidence in its ability to determine its own fate (as occurred in Poland between July 1980 and August 1988). Social currents, which may be defined as processes of social and cultural replication and development, often serve as the vehicles of cultural drift. A social current may thus be understood as a milieu in which social and cultural ferment is energized and focused. Social stress may be re¬ flected in diverse social contexts of varying importance. To the extent that a cultural drift affects the perceptions or instrumentalities of basic social values, it may engender a politically relevant social movement that aspires to \"revitalize\" the system by changing aspects of its cultural Social Currents and Social Change 27 and social order.8 Sometimes in a society in stress, social questioning and the search for new solutions become so widespread that one may speak of the appearance of an \"apocalypse culture.\"9 The appearance of revitalizing social movements is organically linked with the potential for revolutionary turmoil, but they are not reducible to each other. Social movements figure as one mode in which society mo¬ bilizes itself; social mobilization has revolutionary potential only when existing institutions are unable to channel disposable social energies into politically acceptable arenas. When the development of political institutions is able to keep pace with the demands placed on the system, and when institutions are adapt¬ able, the result is civic order. But when political institutions are un¬ able to keep pace with social and economic change, political decay is the result. Political decay signifies that existing institutions have lost their capacity to process demands and to maintain order without resort¬ ing to force; as a result, in a system in which institutions lag behind rising participation — what Huntington and others have called praeto¬ rian society — \"social forces confront each other nakedly,\" without the benefit of generally accepted, routinized intermediary bodies.10 \"In all stages of praetorianism social forces interact directly with each other and make little or no effort to relate their private interest to a public good.\"11 A praetorian situation is potentially but not necessarily revolu¬ tionary: a praetorian society may continue to muddle along in political chaos with the apparatus in a state of partial decay, or it may succumb to a revolutionary upheaval leading to a restructuring of the system. The Illusion of Stability In the early 1970s some astute researchers thought that Eastern Europe had achieved a substantial degree of political stability. In a brilliant if wrong-headed article, Zygmunt Bauman argued that the communist systems of Eastern Europe had become \"immune\" to revolution due to the \"ability and readiness of the government to deal with the basic social and economic issues\" 12 — a claim that looks very odd today, given the record of the Gierek and Jaruzelski governments in Poland, the Ceau§escu government in Romania, and the eventual overthrow of com¬ munism throughout the region. In fact, in the early 1970s there was a tendency for Western observers to forecast continued stability for the foreseeable future, sometimes expecting change to emanate from the top down rather than from the bottom up. This book argues that change has emanated — and will continue to emanate — primarily from the grass 28 Social Currents in Eastern Europe roots. Elite changes in course have very often been responses to pressure from below. Bauman developed an elaborate argument designed to demonstrate that none of the forms of social dissent — or disaffection, in the sense I define it in the next chapter — can be profoundly destabilizing or trans¬ lated into revolutionary upheavals. Bauman's analysis thus specifically excluded the possibility that anything like Solidarity could appear.13 His argument takes the form of an enumeration of seven categories of social dissent. Since his enumeration aspires to comprehensiveness, it will be useful both in furnishing insight into why Eastern Europe was once thought to be \"stabilized” and in suggesting zones of social destabiliza¬ tion. The first type of social disaffection identified by Bauman is simply maladjustment. Newly urbanized peasants experience difficulty in ad¬ justing to their new environment but, Bauman confidently predicted, with the passage of time they acclimatize to city life and develop vested interests in their new status. Bauman's argument was misleading insofar as it suggested that urban life in communist states was largely serene and anxiety free (is it anywhere 1 ). It is also incomplete in that it ignored the role of urban centers as the primary generators of \"alternative culture.\" Hence, although in the short run \"the susceptibility of a country to revo¬ lution may vary inversely with its rate of urbanization,\" 14 in the long run social dissent is articulated and developed in urban settings. The recent history of Berlin, Warsaw, Gdansk, Prague, Budapest, Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana, and other cities amply demonstrates this maxim. The second type of disaffection noted by Bauman is linked with a spe¬ cific generation and is therefore by definition ephemeral. The \"partisan\" generation, whose members fought their way to power and consequently developed skills appropriate to the early utopian phase of the new order, becomes disgruntled when political developments leave them behind. A third type of disaffection is associated with the generation held back by these partisans. Bauman conceded the seriousness of this latter form of disaffection, and noted that the mterfactional tension it generates has long-lasting negative consequences for the exercise of power at the cen¬ ter. Both types are resolved by time. Bauman's fourth category15 is also associated with generational cleavage and involves social expectations stirred by the socialist revolution itself. In Bauman's view, \"the critical period [comes] approximately twenty years after the social upheaval.\"16 At this stage people become impatient to reap the expected benefits of socialism, and frustration sets in. His only comment as to how elites will deal with this challenge was to observe that they have moved away Social Currents and Social Change 29 from ideals of social equity in the direction of a market economy.17 On the whole, however, \"Bauman seems to believe that after carrying out the demographic revolution socialist systems are more and more able to domesticate their working population, while the recent development reveals that the opposite is true.\"18 But this account omits the crucial role played by the late Stalinist ter¬ ror and the post-Stalinist relaxation in defining generational attitudes and hopes. As Hungarian dissident Janos Kis has perceptively noted: [I]n the early 1950s, mobilized people could not reap the fruits of the reorganization because of the terror and the general misery. . . . The generations that participated in the events following the crushing of the revolution and the concomitant terror were very deeply affected by it. The very deep (difference] between then and now was decisive for these generations. It was really an unexpected gift for them that the same power that had crushed them, later allowed them to re¬ establish a normal social life. As a result they didn't bother about putting pressure on the government. They simply didn't think in those terms. But the last parts of these generations are passing away in this decade and new generations have since grown up for whom the Kadarian regime is already a precondition, not something they re¬ ceived as a present.19 The result is that generations respond to economic conditions not in absolute terms, as Bauman suggests, but, as Davies, Gurr, and others have noted, in terms relative to their experiences and expectations.20 Kis's portrayal of generational differences is insightful in another re¬ spect: its presumption of generational exhaustion, which may have a cyclical quality.21 One final point about generational change should be made here: the generational gap, which sometimes gapes wide, sometimes relatively more narrow, is in part a function of generationally linked \"cultural drift.\" Hence, when members of Eastern Europe's younger generation de¬ mand new ways of doing things, the older generation — and particularly members of the partisan generation — feel that their central values have been betrayed and react with fear and hostility.22 This phenomenon is, of course, not unknown in the West. Bauman's fifth category of social disaffection is labeled \"trade inter¬ ests.\" By this he meant that people with specific job-related and career- related interests may at times find those interests to be at variance with the interests of the system as a whole, as defined by the political elite. 30 Social Currents in Eastern Europe This variance is so fragmentary and at such a low level of politics as to be marginal to the calculus of stability, as Bauman was, of course, aware. His sixth category of disaffection is the yearning for national sover¬ eignty among bloc states, and a consequent anti-Soviet orientation. But Bauman was quick to qualify this factor: But to conclude from this that a major social revolution becomes more likely in any of the socialist states, judged in its own right, is to push one's imagination too far. ... As a matter of fact we know [of] no single fact which would support such a conclusion. Whether the relationship of a given socialist country to the Soviets has been warm, lukewarm, or cool, whether the grip of Russian power re¬ mained firm, weakened, or disappeared entirely, there were no signs at all of the State retreating from its socialist path.23 Not at any rate in 1971 when Bauman wrote his essay. The difficulty is that communism in all the East European states except Yugoslavia and Albania was clearly an import imposed and maintained by Soviet power, and until the advent of Gorbachev resentment of Soviet colo¬ nialism was readily compatible with hostility to the system. Beginning in 1985, however, malcontents in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Romania applauded Gorbachev's program, hoping it might provide an antidote to the multifarious ills afflicting their respective societies. Bauman's last type of social disaffection is \"the intellectuals' demand for more freedom of expression.\" But Bauman wrote off the intellectu¬ als as an isolated caste, commenting on \"the (at best) apathetic response which the intellectuals' manifestos win in the other strata of the nation\" and on the impossibility of an effective alliance between intellectuals and workers.24 Since Bauman intended his essay as a prediction, it is fair to point out that the record since 1971 has proven him wrong on both counts — for instance, the alliance between the intellectuals of the Polish Committee for the Defense of the Workers (kor) and the workers of Soli¬ darity in Poland. It is also necessary to keep in mind that ordinary citi¬ zens' responses to demands for freedom in conditions of dictatorship are apt to be conditioned by caution, fear, and circumspection rather than by apathy; the difference becomes politically important when power decays, because the hitherto circumspect can be mobilized for radical politics, while the truly apathetic cannot. Conformity is safe, while even so rudimentary a \"protest\" as removing the mandatory portrait of the leader from the shop window becomes a perilous, perhaps even reck¬ less, act that can result in social ostracism by cautious conformists and reprisals from authorities.25 Social Currents and Social Change 31 What is striking about Bauman's list is that the first four categories of disaffection are specifically transient (or seen as transient), the fifth is economic but narrowly conceived, the sixth is anticolonial but seen by Bauman as nugatory, and the seventh is limited to the desire for more \"freedom of expression.\" The list excludes both traditional foci of discon¬ tent — religious, ethnic, and economic deprivation broadly conceived — which Bauman could have been expected to take into account, and newer foci — pacifism, environmentalism, feminism, and the campaign for free labor unions — which emerged only in the late 1970s. Potential for Destabilization When systems are able to handle the demands placed on them, they remain at equilibrium; when they cannot, the result is destabilization. Revolution is a possible outcome of destabilization; hence, in tracing certain ideas about the patterns conducive to revolution, I shall be indi¬ cating in the same breath the patterns conducive to destabilization more broadly. Among the foremost theorists of revolution and destabilization is Crane Brinton. In Anatomy of Revolution he identifies certain unifor¬ mities in the Puritan, American, French, and Bolshevik revolutions.26 First, these revolutions took place not in stagnant societies, but in soci¬ eties with developing economies. Based on a study of Dorr's Rebellion of 1842, the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the American Revolution, and the Bolshevik Revolution, James C. Davies concludes that revolutions are most likely when a prolonged period of economic growth with asso¬ ciated rising expectations is followed by a sudden economic downturn with associated frustration. In the Russian case, a period of growth in the late nineteenth century was followed by an economic slump (1904- 1 7 ).27 Ted Robert Gurr's theory of \"relative deprivation\" explains how the widening of a gap between expectations and actual benefits mobilizes the discontented and fuels destabilization.28 The second uniformity identified by Brinton is a change in the rela¬ tionships of social classes and groups stimulated, as Charles Tilly ar¬ gues,29 by the mobilization of important new strata in the political arena (who may, in the process, acquire a new group identity) and characterized by a widening rift between the rulers and the ruled. The result is in¬ creased demands on the system and an intensified pressure for political participation. Third, the desertion of the regime by the intellectuals is important because their defection signifies a more articulate and more focused 32 Social Currents in Eastern Europe political opposition. Fourth, the inability of the government to develop efficient means for channeling public participation and for processing public demands on the system leads directly to political decay and the disintegration of the system. As Huntington has also noted, when this occurs destabilization follows, and its translation into revolution may be the only route out of prolonged political chaos. Symptoms of govern¬ mental inefficiency include widespread corruption and the mobilization of nongovernmental groups on the streets. Fifth, the financial failure of the government undermines its credi¬ bility in the eyes of the public and its ability to conduct effective policy. Factors 4 and 5 lead directly to the sixth uniformity, the loss of self- confidence on the part of the ruling class. This is expressed in intraelite polemics and infighting, recurrent purges, and repeated public breast¬ beating by officeholders. And seventh, the government's capacity to maintain order is seriously crippled if it displays ineptness in the use of force against rebellious elements. The record of Eastern Europe's governments in these seven areas pro¬ vides a useful barometer of the region's susceptibility to destabilization and, consequently, of the urgency of change. In the following pages I will discuss the situation in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria as it relates to these seven factors. East Germany is discussed in detail in the next chapter, and that discussion will not be anticipated here. The entire scale of the problems has been much smaller in Albania and Albanian society has been generally weaker and more atomized; for that reason, Albania will also be excluded from the following discussion. Economic Downturn. The chief economic indicators reveal that the East European countries registered uniformly high rates of growth in the 1950s and, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, continued to register modest to high rates of growth into the 1960s and early 1970s. But the Polish and Hungarian economies lost their dynamism in the late 1970s, and the Czechoslovak, Romanian, and Yugoslav economies were clearly in trouble by 1981. In 1985 even the adaptable Bulgarian economy ex¬ perienced a downturn. These trends are reflected in the data for national income growth (table 1) and in the data for growth of gross industrial output (table 2). Similarly, in the agricultural sector there were difficulties. The region as a whole registered steady growth into the 1970s, but difficulties sub¬ sequently emerged, first in Poland, then in the agricultural sectors of the other countries (table 3).

West to finance extensive industrial investment. During the same period Polish agricultural output actually shrank an average of 1.6 percent an¬ nually. By 1980 the Polish economy was clearly in crisis. Of the six countries, Bulgaria experienced the fewest economic shocks prior to 1989. The adoption of the so-called \"New Economic Mechanism\" in 1979—80 was designed to head off problems through a combination of selective decentralization of decision making, greater emphasis on cost- effectiveness, and enhancement of the autonomy of enterprises.30 And Bulgaria's specialization in computers, electronics, transport industry, and nuclear energy since the 1960s earned it a reputation as the \"Japan of the Balkans.\"31 Yet there are some problems. To begin with, growth rates in the major economic sectors sagged in the 1980s and, although overall growth rates in industrial production were impressive, growth rates for \"marketable industrial production\" were more modest (4.3 percent in 1986, 4.1 percent in 1987).32 In addition, repeated shortages of consumer goods like tomatoes, clothing, and kitchen utensils eroded confidence in the system 33 The weakest sector in the 1980s was agriculture, where production plunged a disastrous 9.0 percent in 1985, made a partial re- Social Currents and Social Change 35 Table 3.
