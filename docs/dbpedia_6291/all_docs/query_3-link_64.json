        "text": "Team pursuit is raced on a banked velodrome by two teams of four riders who begin from a standing start on opposite sides of the track. They chase each other, and if a catch is made, the race is over. If not, the full 4,000 meters are raced and the team ahead is declared the winner.\n\nIn Olympic pursuiting, the first qualifying round is done as a normal pursuit race, but the teams are racing for time, the teams with the best times progressing to the next round. From then on, the competitions are run as standard pursuits, the winner advancing.\n\nThe times are decided by the third rider across the line.\n\nUnlike individual pursuiting, which is no longer an Olympic event, team pursuiting survived the 2009 reorganization of Olympic cycling events."
