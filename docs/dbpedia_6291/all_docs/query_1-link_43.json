A popular guitarist and R&B bandleader, Jimmy Liggins scored a string of rocking hits. A self-taught musician, he was previously a driver for his brother's band, Joe Liggins & The Honeydrippers. Launching his own band in 1946, Jimmy Liggins joined Specialty Records where he scored a trio of R&B smashes with 'Teardrop Blues', 'Don't Put Me Down', and 'Drunk'. But while touring with his band, The Drops of Joy, he was shot in the face in 1949 at a stop in Jackson, Mississippi. With Joe Liggins signed with Specialty Records in 1950, Jimmy Liggins frequently teamed with his brother. Switching to Aladdin Records, Jimmy Liggins recorded the often-covered 'I Ain't Drunk'.

He died in Durham, North Carolina. - Born October 14, 1922.\n\nin 1988 - Nico (Christa Päffgen) died. A model, actress and briefly the singer with the pioneering art-rockers The Velvet Underground, Nico was raised in the turmoil of post-World War II West Germany. Embracing the arts, Nico landed a bit part in the 1961 Fellini film La Dolce Vita, and at 14 worked as a fashion model in London and Paris before settling in New York. When avant-garde artist Andy Warhol became the manager/producer of The Velvet Underground, he placed Nico at the front of the group as the co-lead vocalist. Though not fully accepted by the other members of the band, the mysterious Nico was visually stunning with her Marlene Dietrich-like features and German-accent, and she quickly earned a reputation as a femme fatale.\n\nAfter playing at various Greenwich Village clubs and galleries and appearing in a series of Warhol-staged performance art events, VU signed with Verve Records in 1966. The group sold few copies of their début effort The Velvet Underground And Nico (1967), a controversial record that was ignored by radio, not least because of its drug related tracks 'Heroin' and 'Waiting For The Man', both sung by Lou Reed, and suggestive social comment like 'Femme Fatale' and 'All Tomorrow's Parties', both sung by Nico. With Warhol sidelined by self-appointed VU leader Reed, Nico was dismissed from the group in 1968.\n\nPlaying an Indian harmonium, and embracing dark, metaphysical poetry, Nico subsequently released a series of commercially unsuccessful solo records, beginning with an album of cover songs Chelsea ....., which included compositions by Reed, Bob Dylan, Tim Hardin and a young Jackson Browne. A subsequent album, Marble Index (1969), was produced by her longtime collaborator, former VU member John Cale. Remaining in the rock media limelight during this period, Nico was romantically linked with Iggy Pop, Jim Morrison, Leonard Cohen and Jackson Browne. Returning to France in 1972, Nico made her first appearance in a Philippe Garrel-directed film The Inner Scar.\n\nAfter briefly reuniting with VU for a 1974 Paris concert, she teamed with Cale on the album The End, the project featuring guest players Phil Manzanera and Brian Eno, then of Roxy Music. Relocating to Manchester, England, in 1979, Nico became addicted to heroin and for many years lived in reduced circumstances in the Prestwich area of the city where she was often seen riding around on a bicycle. Her regular companion during this time was the poet John Cooper Clarke. Again teaming with Cale, Nico fronted a group called The Faction for the 1985 album, Camera Obscura. She toured in support of the project, and subsequently released two live albums. Nico had finally beaten her longtime chemical addiction shortly before her death. Thrown from her bicycle, she suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She was bicycling on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza. - Born October 16, 1938.\n\nin 1988 - Ike Turner was sentenced in Santa Monica, California to one year in jail for possessing and transporting cocaine.

German singer, composer, model, actress, and a Warhol star. She is known for both her vocal collaboration, the spooky vocalist, on The Velvet Underground's debut album; The Velvet Underground and Nico, and her work as a solo artist from the late '60s through the early '80s. On her debut album, 1967's Chelsea ...., she recorded songs by Bob Dylan, and Tim Hardin among others. She also had roles in a handful of films, including Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita in 1960 and Andy Warhol's Chelsea ..... in 1966. (died of a brain haemorrhage after falling off her bicycle while in Ibiza)\n\nin 1990 - Gerry Boulet dies at age 44. French-Canadian singer, born in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. He started his music career with the band Les Gants Blancs, which by 1969 had evolved into the blues rock band Offenbach. They released their debut album, the first of 17 albums, Offenbach Soap Opéra, in 1971, touring France to promote it. In 1976 the band recorded its first of two English albums, Never Too Tender. In 1984, friction within the group led Gerry to record his first solo album, Presque 40 ans de blues and the following year, the band performed a farewell concert at the Montreal Forum. Gerry was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1987, but carried on working, he released his second solo album, Rendez-vous doux, in 1989, the album won him three Félix Awards. Some songs in this album clearly talk about his fight for life. Three more albums, including a live album and a rock opera, were released after his death.

Farrell's vision for Lollapalooza is for an event that showcases not only non-mainstream music acts, but also art and politics - kind of a one-stop shop for a generation sick of prefab pop and hair metal, and ready to reject their parents' politics and aesthetics.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The first show of the original Lollapalooza tour is held at Compton Terrace in Tempe, Arizona.

Over the years, the side stage features such acts as Tool, Rage Against the Machine, Primus, Cypress Hill, Ben Folds Five, Beck, and Kings of Leon, providing a nice stepping stone on their way toward greater popularity.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Lollapalooza is an annual event through 1997, and is resurrected in 2003. In 2004, ticket sales are poor and the tour was cancelled. In 2005, organizers give it one last shot, making Lollapalooza a three-day event at a single location, rather than a traveling tour. The plan works, and the festival continues through the next decade, with the 2016 event stretching across four days in celebration of Lollapalooza's 25th anniversary.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1991 - Karina Pasian (US singer, pianist) is born.\n\nin 1992 - Bobby Brown married Whitney Houston at her New Jersey estate.

[/FONT][FONT=&quot]A folk-rock singer and social activist, Mimi Farina is best known for her collaborations with husband, Richard Farina, who died in a 1966 motorcycle accident. The daughter of a scientist/professor and the younger sister of Joan Baez, Farina studied dance, piano and violin during her childhood and was drawn to folk music after watching a performance by The Charles River Valley Boys. In 1963, aged 17, she married singer Richard Farina in secret. The couple moved to a small cabin in Carmel, California, and began performing as Richard & Mimi Farina, featuring Mimi on guitar and Richard on dulcimer.\n\nThe duo occasionally performed on stage with Joan Baez and, signing with Vanguard Records in 1965, the duo issued the classic folk album, Richard & Mimi Farina, which was highlighted by the Richard Farina-co-composition, 'Pack Up Your Troubles', later a hit for Mimi's sister.

[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His most recent album, I'm in Need, was released in 1996. He had also performed alongside such artists as The Boogie Blues Band and Charlie Wood. Govan had become one of the favorite musicians on Beale Street, known for his cavernous baritone voice. He routinely performed for over two decades at the Rum Boogie Café.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Govan was born in McComb, Mississippi, and by the age of 13 was playing the guitar.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Jackson played for a group named The Vans, when he was discovered by Fame Studio's George Jackson. He recorded with Fame's Mickey Buckins in 1969. He recorded several singles with Fame through 1972, but they failed to sell. These recordings, including several that were never released, were released by Ace Records in 2013.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Govan performed at Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee, from 1989 to 2014, performing vocals and percussion. Starting in 1994, he performed regularly with the Boogies Blues Band at the Rum Boogie Café, Beale Street. In that time, they were named the Best House Band on Beale Street three times by the Beale Street Merchants Association, and they headlined the BSMA awards for the 2002–2004 Awards Ceremonies.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Govan and fellow musician Don Chandler both received a key to the City of Memphis for their contribution to the music scene in Beale Street over the previous 15 years.

He is most commonly associated with Roy Orbison, the Classics IV and the Atlanta Rhythm Section.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Buie was born in Marianna, Florida, and raised in Dothan, Alabama. He later moved to New York City, and eventually Atlanta, Georgia, where he spent most of his career. However, nearly all the songs written by Buie and his co-writers were conceived in Eufaula, Alabama on Thomas Mill Creek where Buie had a small fishing trailer (Eufaula is only a 3-hour drive from Atlanta and a 1-hour drive from Dothan, making it a convenient location).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was best known as a prolific songwriter, with 340 songs registered in the BMI catalog. His first success came in 1964, when Tommy Roe took \"Party ....\", which Buie co-wrote with Billy Gilmore, into the Billboard Hot 100. In 1967 he started working with the group Classics IV, writing with the group's guitarist James Cobb to add lyrics to Mike Sharpe's instrumental \"Spooky\". Subsequent songs co-written with Cobb included Sandy Posey's \"I Take It Back\", and the Classics IV hits \"Stormy\", \"Traces\", \"Everyday with You ....\", and \"What am I Crying For?\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]While his initial success with the Classics IV established his career, the Atlanta Rhythm Section in the 1970s perhaps best defines his success and artistry as a songwriter and producer. Buie helped gather a talented ensemble of rock musicians that were a seminal part of the Southern Rock genre with bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd. The Atlanta Rhythm Section assumed the mantle of fellow Georgians, the Allman Brothers Band, as one of the best live acts in the genre, with intense and lengthy solos and artistry that transformed their concerts into stellar jam sessions. They played a command performance at the White House for President Jimmy Carter on his son's birthday. Under Buie's leadership, the Rhythm Section had huge regional appeal in the late 1970s and made regular appearances in the Nationwide Top 40. Some of the key elements that distinguished ARS from their counterparts include Buie's production, influence, and songwriting: a rare instance where the lyrics and production matched the talents of accomplished, talented musicians in their prime.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1978, Buie and marketing executive Arnie Geller founded the Buie/Gellar Organization, a recording management company, and BGO Records in Doraville, Georgia.[5] Buie's later work includes \"Rock Bottom\" for Wynonna Judd and \"Mr. Midnight\" for Garth Brooks. Notable artists who have covered his songs include Gloria Estefan (\"Traces\"), Travis Tritt (\"Back Up Against the Wall\" and \"Homesick\"), David Sanborn (\"Spooky\"), and Santana (\"Stormy\"). In 2006, John Legend used \"Stormy\" as the backing track on the single \"Save Room\", earning Buie a writer's credit. Buie's music has also been used in films, most notably Lost in Translation (\"So into You\") and Just like Heaven (\"Spooky\"). \"So Into You\" was also featured in a commercial for Texas Pete hot sauce.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2003, Buie left Atlanta and retired to Eufaula, Alabama, just miles from the birthplace of the songs that built his career. In 2010, the Oscar-winning film The Fighter featured \"So Into You\" by the Atlanta Rhythm Section on its soundtrack. Buie was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1984, and the Alabama Music Hall of Fame in 1997.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Buie died at a hospital in Dothan, Alabama, after suffering a heart attack.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2016 – Mubarak Begum was an Indian vocalist who sang in the Hindi and Urdu languages, dies at age 80. She was a popular playback singer in Bollywood films during the 1950s and 1960s. She had also recorded and given public performances in a number of other genres, including Ghazal and Na`at. A list of the Hindi film songs recorded by her can be found here.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mubarak Begum started her career with light music recitals performed for All India Radio, the Indian Government radio. Her career as a playback singer began in 1949 with the Indian, Hindi-language film Aiye (1949). It was the Indo-Pakistani composer Nashad (not to be confused with the more famous Indian composer Naushad) who gave Mubarak Begum her first break. The first song she recorded for films was \"Mohe Aane Lagi Angrayi, Aja Aja Balam\" (film Aiye, 1949). She also sang a duet with the then upcoming Lata Mangeshkar in the same film. A major hit in her career was the song \"Kabhi Tanhaiyon Mein Yun\" for composer Snehal Bhatkar in Kidar Sharma's film Hamari Yaad Aayegi which is, till this day, regarded as a classic rendition.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mubarak Begum has sung a total of 178 songs for Hindi films during her career, and the total number of films where her songs have appeared is 115. For a complete list of her songs, see List of songs recorded by Mubarak Begum. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mubarak Begum was born into a Muslim family at Sujangarh in Churu district of Rajasthan. She was married to Mr. Shaikh, a man of her own community, and was the mother of two children, a son and a daughter. Her husband and daughter are both dead and she lives with her son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Although she was a well-known singer, Mubarak Begum was not able to capitalize on her talents. She did not have the savvy 'networking' skills which are so important in careers connected to the entertainment industry, and her career remained stilted as a result. A competent singer, she was not a savvy businessperson. She was more interested in the music and less in the money, and her day-to-day expenses and generosity did not allow her to save much money. In a 2016 interview before she died, when asked, she said that the Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali was her favorite singer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mubarak Begum's daughter, who had been suffering from Parkinson's disease, died in October 2015, after which Begum's own health took a serious downturn. In May 2016, the press reported that Mubarak Begum was in hospital and that her family were unable to pay her medical bills. She lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Behram Bagh, in the Mumbai suburb of Jogeshwari, with her family consisting of a son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Her only income, it was reported, was a pension which she received from her late husband's employer. This pension was reported by NDTV news channel to be Rs.800 ($12) per month and by DNA (an Indian newspaper) to be Rs.3000/- ($45) per month, both of which figures are extremely paltry by Indian standards and utterly inadequate for a person's sustenance. Mubarak Begum is dependent on her son, Hussain Shaikh, who earns an uncertain income by freelancing as a chauffeur, and is cared for by her daughter-in-law.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Begum's daughter-in-law, Zarina Hussain Shaikh, has told the press that the actor Salman Khan is virtually the only person from the Hindi film industry who is helping the family financially on a sustained, long-term basis. He has been paying the full costs of all medicines required by the elderly ..... The singer Lata Mangeshkar visited Mubarak Begum in hospital after the death of her daughter and consoled with her. She also extended financial support to the family, which still requires money for Mubarak Begum's treatment and special needs. In June 2016, Vinod Tawde, a BJP minister in the government of Maharashtra, stepped in to help the family. He found that there were no government schemes under which he could release money to the Begum, therefore he asked a charitable trust run by people close to him to help her, and they have provided her with some money.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mubarak Begum died at her residence in Jogeshwari after a prolonged illness.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\n18 July\n\npage 3 of 3[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]19 [/FONT][FONT=&quot]July ……………………………………………………………….. total views 664,278\n\nPage 1 of 4\n\nin 1592 - Erhard Buttner, composer is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1625 - Samuel Besler, German-Polish composer, dies at 50.

In 1705, after his studies in Ghent and Paris, he moved to London and became known as John. In London, his last name was sometimes rendered as 'Lully' or 'Lullie': he was unrelated to Jean-Baptiste Lully, the French composer. His works were published by John Walsh in London under the name of John Loeillet.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was successful as a player and teacher of the harpsichord. He played woodwind in the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket and held musical gatherings every week at his home. His performances were well received in London; and he was responsible for introducing Arcangelo Corelli's 12 concerti grossi to Londoners. According to the New Penguin Dictionary of Music, he helped to popularise the transverse flute (a new instrument compared to the recorder) in England. He died in London.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Leopold Godowsky's piano suite Renaissance features an arrangement of one of the Loeillet's Gigues.

He studied music with his parents, then settled in Paris, where he made a name for himself as a violinist and composer. Although he continued to be active as a composer in subsequent years, he found employment in the Ministry of War; upon retiring, he was made a member of the Legion d'honneur (1814). Davaux was highly regarded as a composer of orchestra and chamber music. In his Trois simphonies agrand orchestre, op.ll (1784), he included his chronometre, thus anticipating Maelzel's invention. - Died at Paris, Feb. 2, 1822.\n\nin 1750 - Alessio Prati, composer is born at Ferrara. He studied with Pietro Marzola in Ferrara, and after further training in Naples, he completed his studies with Abate Speranza in Rome in 1774-75. He then went to France, and eventually entered the service of the Duke of Penthievre in Paris. Following a sojourn in Russia in 1782-83, he returned to Italy and later settled once again in Ferrara as co-adjutor to Petrucci. Prati wrote the operas L'ecole de la jeuness, ou Le Earnevelt franyais (Paris, Oct. 11, 1779), L'Ifigenia in Aulide (Florence, 1784), Armida Abbandonata (Munich, 1785), La vendetta di Nona (Florence, Carnival, 1786), Olimpia (Naples, June 6,1786), Demofoonte (Venice, Dec. 26, 1786), and L'Aminta (Ferrara, 1787?). Among his other works were a Flute Concerto, an Oboe Concerto, 2 harpsichord concertos, the oratorio Giuseppe riconosciuto, and chamber music. - Died at Ferrara, Jan. 17, 1788.\n\nin 1765 - Johann Aloys Miksch, esteemed Bohemian baritone and teacher; born at Georgental; died at Dresden, Sept. 24,1845. He was a choirboy in Dresden, then a singer at the Court Church (from 1786) and a baritone in the Italian Opera of Dresden (from 1797). He was chorus master of the German Opera (from 1820), being pensioned in 1831. He was greatly renowned as a teacher, numbering among his pupils Schroder- Devrient.\n\nin 1782 - Jonathan Blewitt, English composer is born at London. He studied with his father, and with Battishill, and was an organist at several churches; served as conductor at the Theatre Royal in Dublin. Returning to London (1825), he was appointed music director at Sadler's Wells Theatre. He composed many popular ballads, and also authored a treatise on singing, The Vocal Assistant. - Died at London, Sept. 4,1853.\n\nin 1797 - Johann Gottlieb Schneider, composer is born.\n\nin 1811 - Vincenz Lachner, composer is born.\n\nin 1811 - Christian Gotthilf Tag, composer, dies at 76.\n\nin 1811 - (Joseph) Lambert Massart, eminent Belgian violinist and pedagogue, is born at Liege. He studied music with his father and brother, then violin with Ambroise Delaveux. Following his debut at the Liege Theater (March 26, 1822), he received financial assistance from the King for further studies at the Paris Conservatory. When Cherubini refused him admission because he was a foreigner, he found a mentor in R. Kreutzer. In 1829 he was allowed to enter the Conservatory, where he studied theory with P. Zimmerman and counterpoint and fugue with F.-J. Fetis. He gave many successful concerts in Paris. He was professor of violin at the Conservatory. (1843-90), and was also active as a chamber music artist of great distinction. He married the pianist and teacher Louise Anglae Masson (b. Paris, June 10, 1827; d. there, July 26, 1887), with whom he performed regularly in chamber music settings. She succeeded Farrenc as a teacher at the Conservatory in 1875. Among Massart's foremost pupils were Wieniawski, Marsick, Sarasate, and Kreisler. - Died at Paris, Feb. 13, 1892.\n\nin 1837 - W(illiam) S(hakespeare) Hays, American composer, is born at Louisville, Ky. [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Will Hays was the most popular songwriter of the late nineteenth century. Although he wrote some 350 songs, and at least as many poems, some of which were set to music, he never made music his full-time profession. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was a riverboat pilot on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers at various periods of his life (at least two steamboats were named for him), and was the river editor for the [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Louisville Courier-Journal from [/FONT][FONT=&quot]1868 to 1898. His songs were immensely popular in his own day, but Hays could not have anticipated the longevity of some of them. Several of his songs—often mistakenly identified and collected as folksongs by scholars in the early twentieth century—moved into the hinterlands to become the possession of plain people. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Thus they became part of country music's repertoire when the first recordings and radio broadcasts were made in the 1920s. His \"Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane\" was on one side of FIDDLIN' JOHN CARSON'S seminal recording in 1923, and other songs, such as \"We Parted by the River Side,\" \"You've Been a Friend to Me,\" \"I'll Remember You, Love, in My Prayers,\" and \"Nobody's Darling on Earth,\" found their way to country recordings. His \"Jimmie Brown the Paper Boy,\" adapted by the CARTER FAMILY as \"Jimmie Brown the Newsboy\" and prominently recorded by FLATT & SCRUGGS, has become a bluegrass standard and Hays's most recorded song. His biggest hit song, \"Molly Darling,\" was a Top Ten country record for EDDY ARNOLD in 1948.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1838 - Frederic Nicolas Duvernoy, French composer and hornist, dies at 72.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1788, Duvernoy went in Paris and became a hornist at Orchestre de la Comédie italienne. In 1790, he was a member at Orchestre de la Garde nationale and later, in 1797, a member of Orchestre de l'Opéra de Paris and then, in 1799, a solo hornist.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He will be member of La Chapelle de l'empereur Napoléon Ier where , with is brother Charles-Frédéric (clarinet), he will very closed with brothers Rodolphe and Jean Nicolas Auguste Kreutzer (violin), Delcambre (bassoon) and Dalvimare (harp).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1844 - Heinrich Domnich, composer, dies at 77.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Born in Würzburg, he was the son of hornist Friedrich Domnich (1728-1790), and he went on to study and build a distinguished career in Paris. His Méthode de Premier et de Second Cor (1808) gave a very thorough examination of the natural horn and its technique. Of particular interest are the comments of Domnich on the use of crooks, the hand in the bell, and transposition, which generally expound what could be considered a very traditional and standard approach to the natural horn.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Two very different editions of the Méthode appeared in Domnich's lifetime. The original Le Roy edition in French, which appeared in 1808, contains extensive introductory materials on the history and technique of the horn which do not appear in Schott's French and German edition of 1832. This later edition does, however, contain materials which were either revised by Domnich or altered editorially; this is most clear with regard to the subject of crooks and transposition, and in itself sheds some light on the rapid changes occurring in performing techniques employed on the horn.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]One passage from the introductory materials of the 1808 edition sums up much of his commentary about transposition and crooks. Domnich was particularly directing his comments to those players who were cultivating only the middle range of the horn and the medium crooks.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Equally deprived of the high and low tones, the Cors mixtes, which custom and disastrous development of the new species has introduced in almost all our orchestras, are able to play neither on the C crook, nor on those of A and B-flat. How do they manage? When they are given a piece in B-flat, instead of being provided with the proper instruments in this key, the horn in E-flat is employed. They make use of the horn in D if the piece is in A, and if it is in C it is necessary to use the horn in F. Now if a composer has to render a brilliant design in one of these three keys, to express, for example the noise of war, the glory of victory, the pomp of triumph, he arranges the horns in such a manner that they are able to do all without the aid of the hand in the bell. But the Cors mixtes being obligated to transpose as in this operation, the sonorous notes are transformed often to stopped notes and the brilliant to dark and lugubrious accents, the prestige of the illusion vanishes, and with the illusion is destroyed all effect. Furthermore, in the factitious scale which results from the transposition, the artist must, at times, change the second part by playing notes absolutely destitute of tone, and which are only rendered as a dull quivering.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]From this we learn that some performers were transposing on the natural horn in order to avoid using either the high or low crooks, but true artists on the horn did not adopt this practice. We also learn that players were to avoid the low stopped tones as they \"are only rendered as a dull quivering.\" Domnich taught both the use of the full range of crooks on the natural horn and to avoid stopped tones which were outside the intentions of the composer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In contrast, in the 1832 edition, some of the sections on the crooks in article ten, \"How to employ the different tonalities of the horn\" have been modified to explain how to transpose the more difficult crooks of C basso, A, and B-flat alto on the natural horn. These three keys are transposed onto the F, D, and E-flat crooks, respectively, as explained in the following section, which also serves well to review the conventional wisdom of the period on all the crooks of the natural horn.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in C.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Of all the different keys, it is the horn in C which demands the most effort to play because of the multiplicity of its contours. Because of this, playing with the C crook is both trying and fatiguing and should only be employed for simple orchestral effects. A light or graceful melody will never be suitably rendered in this key. There is however a means to render playable solos which are in the key of C, and that is by simply rewriting the notes so that they may be played on the F crook.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in D.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The horn in D is more manageable than the horn in C. However, its contours are still too numerous for it to be suitable for light melodies or difficult passages, although a simple tune played on this crook can produce a good effect.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in E-flat, E, and F.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Everything that is possible to be played on the horn, from simple accompanying figures through to the most difficult concertos, can be played on the E-flat, E- and F-horns. In each of these three keys, the composer is free to follow his bent and bring into play all the resources of the instrument.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in G.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The horn in G is naturally sonorous and requires some delicacy. It should be used with restraint. A simple melody played on this crook can nonetheless produce a pleasing result.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in A and B-flat.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horns in A and B-flat should only be used for simple orchestral effects. Their tonal quality is so shrill and penetrating that even the most competent of performers would not be able to make use of them in the accompaniment of a soft and graceful piece. There is however a means to render playable, solos which are written for these two keys. This means, which is analogous to the one employed for the C crook, consists of rewriting the notes so that pieces for the horn in A can be played on the horn in D, and those in B-flat on the horn in E-flat.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in B-flat basso.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The horn in B-flat basso can be used with much success, if a somber, melancholic, or solemn colour is sought by the composer when writing in the key of B-flat; however its use should be limited to simple orchestral effects for the same reasons which have already been cited concerning the horn in C. Whenever the composer makes use of this key, he should take care to write at the beginning: Horn in B-flat basso. The horn in B-flat basso has the same range as the horn in C, and for the two types of horn it is divided in the same manner relative to its range.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in C alto.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The horn in C alto can be used with much success, if vivacity, movement and brilliance are sought after by the composer in his piece when writing in the key of C; however as the natural timbre of this crook is very penetrating, its use should be limited for loud effects only. At the beginning of the piece should also be written: Horn in C alto. The horn in C alto has the same range as the horn in B-flat alto, and for the two types of horn it is divided in the same manner relative to its range.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]So we see that by 1832 transposition was an accepted practice, if not by Domnich, at least by the editors responsible for the later German edition. Domnich concluded this section on crooks with the following section relating to the choice of crooks for the beginner (identical in both editions). Domnich made special note of the most characteristic crook for the horn and of how the other crooks should be approached.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] We have seen that the low keys, such as those of C and D demand strength and that to be equal to it, one must have acquired firmness of lip, the late fruit of time and study. The high keys, such as G, A, and B-flat, demand on the contrary, delicacy and although shrill, they can be softened, but only by dint of skill. For giving to one and to the other the character which suits them, one has to be initiated up to a certain point in the practical knowledge of the instrument, of its means and resources.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Very near the middle of the two classes of keys are found those of E-flat, E and F among which it remains to choose. But one will not hesitate long if one considers that the tones of E and F already brilliant have a sort of tendency to the disadvantage of the high keys which they border upon whilst by its nature, that of E-flat is soft and harmonious.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The first trials in the last key will contribute then to training the ear of the beginner and to giving him at the outset the feel of the true quality of horn tone. He will be able next to pass to the other keys without danger. The difference in effect which he will find in them ceases to be a stumbling block for him and finally will not produce anything different in his playing. Guided by a period of steady comparison, he will endeavor to adjust those new nuances of key to that which is familiar to him and to preserve in his mind the right type.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]About right-hand technique Domnich made many interesting observations. The most significant are stated in article five, titled \"Evenness of tone.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] All the notes of the horn can be divided into two principal classes: one whereby the notes are produced with the bell open, and the other whereby the notes are produced with the bell more or less stopped by hand.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] There is clearly a difference in timbre between the stopped notes and the open notes which is impossible to make disappear because it is inherent in the nature of the instrument, but one can disguise it enough in order that the ear will not to be offended.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] In order to obtain this result, no other means as yet has been found other than by making the attacks on the open notes softer in order that the stopped notes which are naturally weaker will not make too great a contrast with the open notes.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] This method is good in principle but the result is not always satisfactory. It could be applied to a slowly moving succession of unimportant notes, but in a sustained melody or in a rapid passage it would be impracticable. Thus it is clear that such a hard and fast rule would be detrimental to the music. Since it is impossible to render the stopped notes with any brilliance of sound, and that to the contrary it is possible to suppress this brilliance on those notes which are not stopped, one is obliged to make use of the latter, but at the same time employing another method. The breath must play no role in this; it is the hand in the bell alone which must control this by opening as little as possible for notes which are not stopped, i.e. the hand should be open enough in order that each note be in tune and closed enough in order that the sound does not become too bright.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Domnich also presented a hand position chart for the natural horn covering a complete four octave range from written range from G (notated by Domnich in \"new\" notation) to g'''. [NOTE: Old notation, used by Classical composers and most composers of the period, notated horn pitches in bass clef an octave too low. New notation, utilized by Domnich, is commonly associated with twentieth century composers].[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A number of the low stopped tones were highlighted as notes to avoid. The section of observations which followed in article eleven, \"Sharps and flats,\" showed how to effectively employ the stopped tones in passage work.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Placing the hand in the bell enables execution of all the notes of the horn with their sharps and flats, i.e., playing natural and chromatic scales in all keys.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] However this does not imply that every note of the horn can be used in any place and in any manner to the same advantage. If the stopped notes are played with a strong attack, the resulting sound is lugubrious and their timbre acquires an unpleasant quality. These notes are best placed in a flowing melody or in a soft accompaniment. There are even some notes in the first and second octaves [written G (new notation) to g'] which are absolutely dead, and no matter how they are employed, never produce a satisfactory result. Composers should, as much as is in their power, avoid using these notes.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Finally, the title of this work should be again noted; Méthode de Premier et de Second Cor. The high and low horn were treated as separate instruments in terms of range and equipment by Domnich; no one player could be expected to master the full range of the horn. Domnich did, however, feel that any individual player could master either range. The following passage from the article entitled \"The two types of horn\" is quite revealing.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] It has already been said that it is impossible for the same player to play all the notes of the horn from the low register to the high register using only one mouthpiece. It is equally impossible for him to use in turn two mouthpieces of different diameters.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] These limits being as they are have made it necessary to decide whether or not to sacrifice a part of the horn's range, or to divide into two, (sharing between two players), the complete range of the instrument. It is the latter which has been accepted resulting in two types of horn being established. One of these, known as the first horn [premier Cor], has been allocated to the high register, and the other, the second horn [second Cor], has been allocated to the low register. The intermediary notes, which one refers to as the middle or medium register belong equally to both types of horn.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] It is generally accepted opinion that thin flat lips are best suited for first horn, and thick protruding lips are best suited for second horn. This idea is devoid of reason. The two types differ only in the mouthpiece which is used. For first horn, a narrow mouthpiece helps to obtain the high notes while for second horn, a larger more open mouthpiece favors the low notes. When considering the limits of their respective ranges, both of these demand the same effort for the lips, or more precisely, the same degree of mouthpiece pressure on the lips.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] It is therefore true to say that there exists no particular natural tendency to either of these two types of horn. The pupil will be found to be equally well gifted for one or the other. From this it follows that from the first lesson, the pupil must adopt one of the two mouthpieces and thus choose between first or second horn.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Illustrations of the two types of mouthpiece followed. Undoubtedly, these comments of Domnich reflected opinions which were shared by many horn players of the period.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1847 - Johann Wilhelm Wilms, composer, dies at 75.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1873 - Louis Zimmermann, violinist/1st concert master of Concert building is born.\n\nin 1877 - Dinh Gilly, French baritone, is born at Algiers.

In 1940 he majored in piano at Oberlin College. He started playing with Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker in 1945, and performed and recorded under Gillespie from 1945 to 1946, as a member of Eddie Davis and His Beboppers in 1946 (also featuring Fats Navarro), and the Eddie Davis Quintet in 1947, under Parker from 1948 to 1950, and under Stan Getz from 1949 to 1951. The Gillespie quintet, which included Haig, recorded four 78 r.p.m. sides for Guild Records in May 1945 which are regarded as the first recordings to demonstrate all elements of the mature bebop style. He was part of the celebrated nonet on the first session of Miles Davis' Birth of the Cool.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]For much of the 1950s and 1960s, \"Haig was all but a forgotten giant\", in Brian Case's words; \"Jazz pianism, ever more percussive in a crass simplification of [Bud] Powell's methods, had no room for the crystalline touch and swift, logical turnover of ideas. Haig got by with semi-cocktail piano in New York bars.\" Although Haig became known for his distinctive and pioneering bebop style, he in fact spent much of his career playing in non-jazz contexts. His work was the subject of a revival in the 1970s.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1969 Haig was acquitted of a murder charge. He had been accused of strangling his third wife, Bonnie, at their home in Clifton, New Jersey, on October 9, 1968. He had said in evidence that his wife had been drunk, and had died in a fall down a flight of stairs. Grange Rutan, Haig's second wife, challenged Haig's account in her 2007 book, Death of a Bebop Wife. Rutan's book is partly autobiographical, partly based on interviews with friends and family members. She describes Bonnie's story in detail, describing an underside to Haig that included a history of serial domestic abuse. Rutan notes that several family members sounded alarm bells regarding Haig's violent personality that went unheeded. She quotes bassist Hal Gaylor, who was talking with Haig before a performance at the Edison Hotel lounge in the early seventies, when Haig admitted to him he had caused Bonnie's death.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1974, Haig was invited to tour Europe by Tony Williams, owner of Spotlite Records in the United Kingdom. At the end of a very successful tour he recorded the Invitation album for Spotlite with Bibi Rovère on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums. This kick-started his re-emergence and, over the next eight years, he built a strong following in Europe and toured several times, recording in the UK and France, and appearing elsewhere. He also recorded for several Japanese labels.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In an interview several years ago, Mr. Haig said that he and Tiny Grimes, the guitarist, had been playing at the Spotlight on 52d Street, noted for its numerous jazz clubs, when he first heard Charlie (Bird) Parker's alto saxophone:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]''One night, Dizzy and Bird came in with their instruments, unpacked them and swooped up on the stand and started playing 'Shaw Nuff' or some damned thing. I'd been following Dizzy on records, but it was the first time I'd ever heard Bird. I knew they were auditioning me because they were so businesslike. They unpacked their horns like they were machine guns.'' [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mr. Haig's piano style, lean and delicate, was influenced by Nat (King) Cole, Teddy Wilson and then Bud Powell, one of the creators of bop. The be-bop style originated in the early 40's. Its specific creation, however, has not been authenticated.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]''The big mystery is that nobody knows who did what,'' Mr. Haig once said. ''I often thought that it might have been Bud Powell out in the woods with the trumpet player Cootie Williams. Powell was really the creator of the whole thing because his playing was so completely perfect and so highly stylized in that idiom. He outbirded Bird and he outdizzied Dizzy. And here he was playing on a percussive instrument, not a front-line instrument, and at times outdoing any of them.''

By this time Kirby had recorded for BLUEBIRD (1936-37), DECCA (1938), Sonora (1946-47), MGM (1949), and COLUMBIA (1950), in addition to writing songs such as \"Atomic Power,\" a 1946 chartmaker for the Buchanan Brothers. For more than two decades, running into the 1980s, Kirby was also a featured western entertainer at the Tweetsie Railroad in Blowing Rock, North Carolina, where he sang and helped reenact life in the Old West.

[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was cantor at St. Bernhardinus, Breslau, in 1602, then rector of the Gymnasium from 1605. As with Jakob Meiland in the generation before him, and Melchior Vulpius in his own generation, his St. Matthew Passion follows the model of Johann Walter's Lutheran historia, but with more elaborate choral numbers.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1700 - Hieronymus Gradenthaler, composer, dies at 62.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1730 - Jean-Baptiste Loeillet of London, Flemish baroque composer as well as a performer on the recorder, flute, oboe, and harpsichord, dies at 49.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He is called the London Loeillet to distinguish him from another famous composer, his first cousin Jean Baptiste Loeillet of Ghent, and he was the elder brother of Jacques Loeillet, also a composer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Loeillet was born at Ghent, then in the Spanish Netherlands. In 1705, after his studies in Ghent and Paris, he moved to London and became known as John. In London, his last name was sometimes rendered as 'Lully' or 'Lullie': he was unrelated to Jean-Baptiste Lully, the French composer. His works were published by John Walsh in London under the name of John Loeillet.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was successful as a player and teacher of the harpsichord. He played woodwind in the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket and held musical gatherings every week at his home. His performances were well received in London; and he was responsible for introducing Arcangelo Corelli's 12 concerti grossi to Londoners. According to the New Penguin Dictionary of Music, he helped to popularise the transverse flute (a new instrument compared to the recorder) in England. He died in London.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Leopold Godowsky's piano suite Renaissance features an arrangement of one of the Loeillet's Gigues. He also made the song gavotte and aria.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1735 - Garret Wesley Mornington, composer is born.\n\nin 1742 - Jean-Baptiste Davaux, composer is born at La Cote-St. Andre. He studied music with his parents, then settled in Paris, where he made a name for himself as a violinist and composer. Although he continued to be active as a composer in subsequent years, he found employment in the Ministry of War; upon retiring, he was made a member of the Legion d'honneur (1814). Davaux was highly regarded as a composer of orchestra and chamber music. In his Trois simphonies agrand orchestre, op.ll (1784), he included his chronometre, thus anticipating Maelzel's invention. - Died at Paris, Feb. 2, 1822.\n\nin 1750 - Alessio Prati, composer is born at Ferrara. He studied with Pietro Marzola in Ferrara, and after further training in Naples, he completed his studies with Abate Speranza in Rome in 1774-75. He then went to France, and eventually entered the service of the Duke of Penthievre in Paris. Following a sojourn in Russia in 1782-83, he returned to Italy and later settled once again in Ferrara as co-adjutor to Petrucci. Prati wrote the operas L'ecole de la jeuness, ou Le Earnevelt franyais (Paris, Oct. 11, 1779), L'Ifigenia in Aulide (Florence, 1784), Armida Abbandonata (Munich, 1785), La vendetta di Nona (Florence, Carnival, 1786), Olimpia (Naples, June 6,1786), Demofoonte (Venice, Dec. 26, 1786), and L'Aminta (Ferrara, 1787?). Among his other works were a Flute Concerto, an Oboe Concerto, 2 harpsichord concertos, the oratorio Giuseppe riconosciuto, and chamber music. - Died at Ferrara, Jan. 17, 1788.\n\nin 1765 - Johann Aloys Miksch, esteemed Bohemian baritone and teacher; born at Georgental; died at Dresden, Sept. 24,1845. He was a choirboy in Dresden, then a singer at the Court Church (from 1786) and a baritone in the Italian Opera of Dresden (from 1797). He was chorus master of the German Opera (from 1820), being pensioned in 1831. He was greatly renowned as a teacher, numbering among his pupils Schroder- Devrient.\n\nin 1782 - Jonathan Blewitt, English composer is born at London. He studied with his father, and with Battishill, and was an organist at several churches; served as conductor at the Theatre Royal in Dublin. Returning to London (1825), he was appointed music director at Sadler's Wells Theatre. He composed many popular ballads, and also authored a treatise on singing, The Vocal Assistant. - Died at London, Sept. 4,1853.\n\nin 1797 - Johann Gottlieb Schneider, composer is born.\n\nin 1811 - Vincenz Lachner, composer is born.\n\nin 1811 - Christian Gotthilf Tag, composer, dies at 76.\n\nin 1811 - (Joseph) Lambert Massart, eminent Belgian violinist and pedagogue, is born at Liege. He studied music with his father and brother, then violin with Ambroise Delaveux. Following his debut at the Liege Theater (March 26, 1822), he received financial assistance from the King for further studies at the Paris Conservatory. When Cherubini refused him admission because he was a foreigner, he found a mentor in R. Kreutzer. In 1829 he was allowed to enter the Conservatory, where he studied theory with P. Zimmerman and counterpoint and fugue with F.-J. Fetis. He gave many successful concerts in Paris. He was professor of violin at the Conservatory. (1843-90), and was also active as a chamber music artist of great distinction. He married the pianist and teacher Louise Anglae Masson (b. Paris, June 10, 1827; d. there, July 26, 1887), with whom he performed regularly in chamber music settings. She succeeded Farrenc as a teacher at the Conservatory in 1875. Among Massart's foremost pupils were Wieniawski, Marsick, Sarasate, and Kreisler. - Died at Paris, Feb. 13, 1892.\n\nin 1837 - W(illiam) S(hakespeare) Hays, American composer, is born at Louisville, Ky. [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Will Hays was the most popular songwriter of the late nineteenth century. Although he wrote some 350 songs, and at least as many poems, some of which were set to music, he never made music his full-time profession. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was a riverboat pilot on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers at various periods of his life (at least two steamboats were named for him), and was the river editor for the [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Louisville Courier-Journal from [/FONT][FONT=&quot]1868 to 1898. His songs were immensely popular in his own day, but Hays could not have anticipated the longevity of some of them. Several of his songs—often mistakenly identified and collected as folksongs by scholars in the early twentieth century—moved into the hinterlands to become the possession of plain people. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Thus they became part of country music's repertoire when the first recordings and radio broadcasts were made in the 1920s. His \"Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane\" was on one side of FIDDLIN' JOHN CARSON'S seminal recording in 1923, and other songs, such as \"We Parted by the River Side,\" \"You've Been a Friend to Me,\" \"I'll Remember You, Love, in My Prayers,\" and \"Nobody's Darling on Earth,\" found their way to country recordings. His \"Jimmie Brown the Paper Boy,\" adapted by the CARTER FAMILY as \"Jimmie Brown the Newsboy\" and prominently recorded by FLATT & SCRUGGS, has become a bluegrass standard and Hays's most recorded song. His biggest hit song, \"Molly Darling,\" was a Top Ten country record for EDDY ARNOLD in 1948.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1838 - Frederic Nicolas Duvernoy, French composer and hornist, dies at 72.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1788, Duvernoy went in Paris and became a hornist at Orchestre de la Comédie italienne. In 1790, he was a member at Orchestre de la Garde nationale and later, in 1797, a member of Orchestre de l'Opéra de Paris and then, in 1799, a solo hornist.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He will be member of La Chapelle de l'empereur Napoléon Ier where , with is brother Charles-Frédéric (clarinet), he will very closed with brothers Rodolphe and Jean Nicolas Auguste Kreutzer (violin), Delcambre (bassoon) and Dalvimare (harp).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1844 - Heinrich Domnich, composer, dies at 77.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Born in Würzburg, he was the son of hornist Friedrich Domnich (1728-1790), and he went on to study and build a distinguished career in Paris. His Méthode de Premier et de Second Cor (1808) gave a very thorough examination of the natural horn and its technique. Of particular interest are the comments of Domnich on the use of crooks, the hand in the bell, and transposition, which generally expound what could be considered a very traditional and standard approach to the natural horn.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Two very different editions of the Méthode appeared in Domnich's lifetime. The original Le Roy edition in French, which appeared in 1808, contains extensive introductory materials on the history and technique of the horn which do not appear in Schott's French and German edition of 1832. This later edition does, however, contain materials which were either revised by Domnich or altered editorially; this is most clear with regard to the subject of crooks and transposition, and in itself sheds some light on the rapid changes occurring in performing techniques employed on the horn.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]One passage from the introductory materials of the 1808 edition sums up much of his commentary about transposition and crooks. Domnich was particularly directing his comments to those players who were cultivating only the middle range of the horn and the medium crooks.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Equally deprived of the high and low tones, the Cors mixtes, which custom and disastrous development of the new species has introduced in almost all our orchestras, are able to play neither on the C crook, nor on those of A and B-flat. How do they manage? When they are given a piece in B-flat, instead of being provided with the proper instruments in this key, the horn in E-flat is employed. They make use of the horn in D if the piece is in A, and if it is in C it is necessary to use the horn in F. Now if a composer has to render a brilliant design in one of these three keys, to express, for example the noise of war, the glory of victory, the pomp of triumph, he arranges the horns in such a manner that they are able to do all without the aid of the hand in the bell. But the Cors mixtes being obligated to transpose as in this operation, the sonorous notes are transformed often to stopped notes and the brilliant to dark and lugubrious accents, the prestige of the illusion vanishes, and with the illusion is destroyed all effect. Furthermore, in the factitious scale which results from the transposition, the artist must, at times, change the second part by playing notes absolutely destitute of tone, and which are only rendered as a dull quivering.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]From this we learn that some performers were transposing on the natural horn in order to avoid using either the high or low crooks, but true artists on the horn did not adopt this practice. We also learn that players were to avoid the low stopped tones as they \"are only rendered as a dull quivering.\" Domnich taught both the use of the full range of crooks on the natural horn and to avoid stopped tones which were outside the intentions of the composer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In contrast, in the 1832 edition, some of the sections on the crooks in article ten, \"How to employ the different tonalities of the horn\" have been modified to explain how to transpose the more difficult crooks of C basso, A, and B-flat alto on the natural horn. These three keys are transposed onto the F, D, and E-flat crooks, respectively, as explained in the following section, which also serves well to review the conventional wisdom of the period on all the crooks of the natural horn.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in C.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Of all the different keys, it is the horn in C which demands the most effort to play because of the multiplicity of its contours. Because of this, playing with the C crook is both trying and fatiguing and should only be employed for simple orchestral effects. A light or graceful melody will never be suitably rendered in this key. There is however a means to render playable solos which are in the key of C, and that is by simply rewriting the notes so that they may be played on the F crook.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in D.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The horn in D is more manageable than the horn in C. However, its contours are still too numerous for it to be suitable for light melodies or difficult passages, although a simple tune played on this crook can produce a good effect.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in E-flat, E, and F.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Everything that is possible to be played on the horn, from simple accompanying figures through to the most difficult concertos, can be played on the E-flat, E- and F-horns. In each of these three keys, the composer is free to follow his bent and bring into play all the resources of the instrument.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in G.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The horn in G is naturally sonorous and requires some delicacy. It should be used with restraint. A simple melody played on this crook can nonetheless produce a pleasing result.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in A and B-flat.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horns in A and B-flat should only be used for simple orchestral effects. Their tonal quality is so shrill and penetrating that even the most competent of performers would not be able to make use of them in the accompaniment of a soft and graceful piece. There is however a means to render playable, solos which are written for these two keys. This means, which is analogous to the one employed for the C crook, consists of rewriting the notes so that pieces for the horn in A can be played on the horn in D, and those in B-flat on the horn in E-flat.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in B-flat basso.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The horn in B-flat basso can be used with much success, if a somber, melancholic, or solemn colour is sought by the composer when writing in the key of B-flat; however its use should be limited to simple orchestral effects for the same reasons which have already been cited concerning the horn in C. Whenever the composer makes use of this key, he should take care to write at the beginning: Horn in B-flat basso. The horn in B-flat basso has the same range as the horn in C, and for the two types of horn it is divided in the same manner relative to its range.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Horn in C alto.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The horn in C alto can be used with much success, if vivacity, movement and brilliance are sought after by the composer in his piece when writing in the key of C; however as the natural timbre of this crook is very penetrating, its use should be limited for loud effects only. At the beginning of the piece should also be written: Horn in C alto. The horn in C alto has the same range as the horn in B-flat alto, and for the two types of horn it is divided in the same manner relative to its range.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]So we see that by 1832 transposition was an accepted practice, if not by Domnich, at least by the editors responsible for the later German edition. Domnich concluded this section on crooks with the following section relating to the choice of crooks for the beginner (identical in both editions). Domnich made special note of the most characteristic crook for the horn and of how the other crooks should be approached.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] We have seen that the low keys, such as those of C and D demand strength and that to be equal to it, one must have acquired firmness of lip, the late fruit of time and study. The high keys, such as G, A, and B-flat, demand on the contrary, delicacy and although shrill, they can be softened, but only by dint of skill. For giving to one and to the other the character which suits them, one has to be initiated up to a certain point in the practical knowledge of the instrument, of its means and resources.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Very near the middle of the two classes of keys are found those of E-flat, E and F among which it remains to choose. But one will not hesitate long if one considers that the tones of E and F already brilliant have a sort of tendency to the disadvantage of the high keys which they border upon whilst by its nature, that of E-flat is soft and harmonious.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The first trials in the last key will contribute then to training the ear of the beginner and to giving him at the outset the feel of the true quality of horn tone. He will be able next to pass to the other keys without danger. The difference in effect which he will find in them ceases to be a stumbling block for him and finally will not produce anything different in his playing. Guided by a period of steady comparison, he will endeavor to adjust those new nuances of key to that which is familiar to him and to preserve in his mind the right type.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]About right-hand technique Domnich made many interesting observations. The most significant are stated in article five, titled \"Evenness of tone.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] All the notes of the horn can be divided into two principal classes: one whereby the notes are produced with the bell open, and the other whereby the notes are produced with the bell more or less stopped by hand.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] There is clearly a difference in timbre between the stopped notes and the open notes which is impossible to make disappear because it is inherent in the nature of the instrument, but one can disguise it enough in order that the ear will not to be offended.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] In order to obtain this result, no other means as yet has been found other than by making the attacks on the open notes softer in order that the stopped notes which are naturally weaker will not make too great a contrast with the open notes.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] This method is good in principle but the result is not always satisfactory. It could be applied to a slowly moving succession of unimportant notes, but in a sustained melody or in a rapid passage it would be impracticable. Thus it is clear that such a hard and fast rule would be detrimental to the music. Since it is impossible to render the stopped notes with any brilliance of sound, and that to the contrary it is possible to suppress this brilliance on those notes which are not stopped, one is obliged to make use of the latter, but at the same time employing another method. The breath must play no role in this; it is the hand in the bell alone which must control this by opening as little as possible for notes which are not stopped, i.e. the hand should be open enough in order that each note be in tune and closed enough in order that the sound does not become too bright.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Domnich also presented a hand position chart for the natural horn covering a complete four octave range from written range from G (notated by Domnich in \"new\" notation) to g'''. [NOTE: Old notation, used by Classical composers and most composers of the period, notated horn pitches in bass clef an octave too low. New notation, utilized by Domnich, is commonly associated with twentieth century composers].[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A number of the low stopped tones were highlighted as notes to avoid. The section of observations which followed in article eleven, \"Sharps and flats,\" showed how to effectively employ the stopped tones in passage work.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Placing the hand in the bell enables execution of all the notes of the horn with their sharps and flats, i.e., playing natural and chromatic scales in all keys.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] However this does not imply that every note of the horn can be used in any place and in any manner to the same advantage. If the stopped notes are played with a strong attack, the resulting sound is lugubrious and their timbre acquires an unpleasant quality. Th"
