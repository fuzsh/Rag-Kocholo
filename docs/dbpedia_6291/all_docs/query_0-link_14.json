        "text": "Intermedial interaction among various media or sign systems has always existed in most cultures, but since performance art is a relatively new phenomenon, this chapter focuses on the relationship between intermediality and performance art. With the increasingly frequent use of sophisticated digital technologies in multimedia performance, the relationship between intermediality and performance art has moved into sharp focus. What happens when several media interact in performance art? What is the relationship between intermediality, performance and performativity in multimedia art forms? How does the sense of openness and of unraveling of the source or pre-text translate into the intermedial adaptation that a performance involves? This chapter discusses issues of semiotics, performativity and self-reference in relationship to intermediality. For its application of these theoretical concerns, it will use Laurie Anderson, the American performance artist, whose large and complex multimedia productions have not only revolutionized the art form but which also offer interesting insights into the adaptation of the intersection of narrative, visual, musical and gestural source texts mediated by new technologies and the performing arts.

Keywords: intermediality, performance art, performativity, self-reference, self-reflexivity, multimedia, Laurie Anderson\n\nIn this article I attempt to trace the path of my artistic research, which began from the application of schizoanalysis in performance and which now explores the possible limits of thought in order to regard how performance thinks in specifically different ways from discursive forms of thought, such as philosophy. The main argument starts from the notion – borrowed from French thinker, François Laruelle - that philosophical thought does not tell us more about the Real than any other gestures of thought. I begin from a speculative relationship between the apparatus of cognitive capitalism. I conclude by superpositioning the post-humanist thought of Laruelle and Karen Barad with the concept of ‘non-standard’ performance as fictioning. As a whole, the article aims to propose a performative approach to artistic research in these terms.\n\nThis text is a first version and suffers from various weaknesses. We welcome any comments that could help us transform it into a more robust and performative text. Performative arts can be seen as an organization of performativity. However, how can we study the performativity of the aesthetic experiences brought about by performative arts in a way that could help us make sense of organizational and political aspects involved? And how then to compose an approach that tries to capture and describe the whole of experience in its aesthetic dimensions, but also think it and communicate it? We propose here to use some resources of the \"turn-to-affects\" to study organizational and political aspects of performativity in performing arts thanks to the study of a theatre play. An affect-led approach has the advantage of placing the researcher in a quasi unmediated contact with the aesthetic experience, of opening her or him up to a wide range of performative dimensions, and of forcing her to reflect on the organizational, political and ethical dimension of the experience.
