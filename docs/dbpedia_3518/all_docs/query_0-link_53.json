        "text": "We appreciate folks with good taste... and so did Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street. You may have heard of him: the barbarous barber who cut more than hair. Todd had the odd custom of slitting the throats of his customers; he'd send the bodies to his neighbor, Mrs. Lovett, who would then use them as ingredients in her famous meat pies. Though the practice guaranteed no repeat customers for Todd, the denizens of London couldn't get enough of Mrs. Lovett's people food. Gruesome, isn't it? We certainly think so! But we can take solace in knowing that Todd was the product of fiction... right? Nothing that ghastly could happen outside the pages of a penny dreadful... eXXXcept there are those who disagree; to some, the Demon Barber is far too real. Now, hear us out: Todd is most likely ghoulish fantasy, but there is a kernel of doubt. Norman Bates is a character sewn with the same black thread as Todd, yet no one ever claims that he truly lived: made from scraps of the truth (Ed Gein was an inspiration), but accepted as the creation of author Robert Bloch. Todd, ho-wever, refuses to be confined to imagination. Flesh or fiend, history or humbug... we invite you to attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.\n\nIf you take Todd as a fictitious scoundrel, he first appeared in \"The String of Pearls: A Domestic Romance,\" a serial first published from 1846-1847. The author is unknown, but many believe it was written by James Malcolm Rymer or Thomas Peckett Prest, though other candidates have been offered. Regardless of its author, it was undeniably an influential story in Victorian crime fiction. As with subsequent versions, Todd is a barber/homicidal maniac who kills customers and presents the corpses to Mrs. Lovett for delicious meat pie filling. What does differ from future versions is the method: Todd pulls a lever on his fancy barber chair, which forces the victim to fall backward down a trap door, generally leading to a broken neck or cracked skull. If that doesn't work, then the victim gets that infamous razor to the throat. Of course, most tellings tend to reverse the process, with the razor slit being a perennial crowd-pleaser. Whatever the order, the result was the same: a clean face and a fresh pie.\n\nNow, for those who believe Todd to be a historical figure, the Demon Barber was born on October 26th, 1756. He had an unhappy childhood: a life of poverty and an abusive father. By age 12, the future throat-slasher was an orphan; at 14, he was a felon. (But it was for nothing more than theft... he was still so innocent!) The prison barber taught Todd his notorious trade, and when our tonsorial artist left prison, he opened that legendary shop on Fleet Street. On April 14th, 1785, Sweeney killed a man after an argument; that began a new career for our hair-raising hair-stylist. He then installed the aforementioned chair, worked on other throats, and went into business with the dear Mrs. Lovett. Though we're not the kind to marvel at murderers, Sweeney's carnivorous campaign lasted for an incredible 17 years! (Andre the Giant was reportedly undefeated for 15 years. Am I saying that Sweeney Todd was the Andre the Giant of murder? Absolutely.) Alas, Sweeney and Lovett were arrested after rumors of missing sailors began to arise. Lovett committed suicide in prison after confessing; Todd was tried and convicted. After successfully murdering about 160 people, Todd was hanged for only one of those killings. And so ends the tale of the real-life Sweeney Todd.\n\nFascinating stuff. Truly ho-rrific... but it probably didn't happen. Author Peter Haining (referenced by Lucio Fulci in \"Don't Torture a Duckling\") wrote two books on the \"historical\" Todd, and his work provides most of information we have on the subject. Other researchers have tried to verify Haining's citations but have found nothing to back up his claims. One gets the impression that Haining desperately WANTED Todd to be real, but the evidence is against him. The 1847 stage adaptation of \"The String of Pearls\" was said to be founded on fact; then again, nearly every Blumhouse ho-rror film claims the same. And while an 1850 edition of \"...Pearls\" proposed the idea that Todd really lived, it's hard to trust an introduction to a penny dreadful. No public records provide evidence of a London barber named Sweeney in the 18th-century, nor was there a barber shop on Fleet Street during that time. Rumors and word-of-mouth ho-rror stories were prevalent: gossip of a barber named Todd was passed around, though the details were distorted from telling to telling. Sweeney was likely just another bogeyman, no more real than Freddy Krueger or Michael Myers. Ho-wever, it was a role that Sweeney filled perfectly. As Anna Pavord said in The Observer in 1979, \"Sweeney Todd will never die. We all need bogeymen and he was bogier than most.\"\n\nSweeney may not have been real, but his lurid legend continues to petrify the public. Since 1847, the melodrama has been a macabre favorite. The aptly-named Tod Slaughter, \"Europe's Horror Man,\" made his reputation by playing the character on stage, screen, and radio. Tod's take on Todd in the 1936 film version was one of the first great slasher performances. Low budget auteur Andy Milligan helmed a version of the legend in 1970 called \"Bloodthirsty Butchers.\" While not a great film, it is delightfully daffy and recommended to lovers of shameless gore. Christopher Bond's 1973 play gave the maniac a tragic backstory, and Stephen Sondheim's 1979 adaptation transformed Bond's story into one of the greatest musicals of all time. In 2007, Tim Burton brought the Sondheim musical to the screen, introducing the razor-happy madman to a new generation.\n\nSince the blade-swinging brute is fiction, we happily present this tasty morsel for your guilt-free consumption: the 1936 version of \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street!\" Witness Tod Slaughter in his greatest role! See the maniacal barber at his nuttiest! Gasp at the inappropriate score! It's almost as tasty as a fresh meat pie!"
