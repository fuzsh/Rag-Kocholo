        "text": "Last month, Paramount announced that they would be releasing a 4K box set titled Paramount Scares Vol. 1 on October 24th that will include five films, a perfect treat for any horror fan, especially during this Halloween season. The movies are Rosemary’s Baby (1968), directed by Roman Polanski; Pet Sematary (1989), directed by Mary Lambert; Crawl (2019), directed by Alexandre Aja; and Parker Finn’s Smile (2022). It’s a great mix of old scares and new ones for fans to have a range of films to watch this October. Interestingly enough, Paramount decided to keep the fifth movie a secret until the release date, which has finally arrived. The final movie was revealed to be Tim Burton’s 2007 film, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street!\n\nThe Surprise!\n\nIt is still yet to be decided if viewers are happy with the fifth mystery movie reveal, but for those who have no idea what to expect, here’s a brief description of the movie. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was released in 2007 and was directed by Tim Burton. Unlike the other films included in the box set, this one is a musical slasher. It may not be for everyone, but it’s a fun change from the otherwise terrifying movies on the set. The movie itself is based on the stage musical with the same title that was made by Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler, but the play is further based on another play from the 1970s written by Christopher Bond. It has come a long way from the 1970s up until the early 2000s, but each form of the piece is an interesting watch.\n\nThe movie follows Sweeney Todd, played by Johnny Depp, who is an English barber who was wrongfully convicted of a crime and was exiled to Australia. During his banishment, Judge Turpin (who sent him away) stole his wife and drove her to madness. When he returns, Sweeney Todd is on a mission to seek revenge and take justice into his own hands (and a razorblade). The means he uses to do this are questionable, but the story that unfolds is one that is hard to forget. If that doesn’t convince you, consider the star cast of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett, Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin, Jamie Campbell Bower as Anthony, and many more! It is definitely a slasher horror classic worth watching.\n\nWhat Else Do Viewers Get?\n\nAlongside the box set of movies, there are many more aspects to the box set that movie lovers will enjoy. There are a few Halloween treats separate from the movies themselves, such as a Paramount Scares enamel pin, a collector’s edition Fangoria Magazine, and stickers. Additionally, all the movies included in this box set will be remastered in 4K (obviously), and they’ll also come with bonus content and exclusive footage. Sweeney Todd, specifically, comes with a behind-the-scenes look at the movie with Burton and Depp, the Sweeney Todd Press Conference, The Real History of the Demon Barber, Musical Mayhem: Stephen Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd, Sweeney’s London (a look into how London was during the time period), Grand Guignol: A Theatrical Tradition, and finally, Moviefone Unscripted with Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. It’s a lot, but considering the five movies, plus all the additional content with each one, and the fun non-movie memorabilia, it seems to be worth the investment for movie buffs!\n\nThe Paramount Scares Volume 1 box set is out now, right in time for Halloween!"
