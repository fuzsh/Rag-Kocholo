        "text": "With that title I feel I should explain myself pretty quickly. In 2007, the iconically dark film maker Tim Burton took the 1979 play about Benjamin Barker alias Sweeney Todd , the Victorian legend who sets out to take revenge on the judge who banished him (in the most brutal killings involving a barbers knife and specially designed chair may I add), and turned it into a musical motion film Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. And a bloody musical it was at that.\n\nTodd’s deteriorating sanity is a key motif to the film, in particular his obsession with death. My colleague Declan Lee and I decided to re-enact the particular scene where Todd expresses his feelings ‘We all deserve to die’, in of course a delightful as ever tune. The reason we chose this particular scene was because of the twisted juxtaposition with what he is saying, that everyone including himself deserves to die, with the upbeat orchestra in the background.\n\nFascination of death isn’t anything only appropriate to modern culture, for over 2,500 years the day of the dead has been celebrated in mexico. A day solely to celebrate the deaths of ancestors through rituals and shrines. But why are we drawn towards fictitious deaths in the media? Does the media shape our attitude towards death? or does our attitude towards death shape how the subject is approached in the media?\n\nJohnny Depp’s rendition of Todd was voted best choice movie villain in the Teen choice awards (IMDB, 2008), which suggests that there is something about this unstable character that young people do find endearing. But with suicide in the top ten causes of death in teenagers in the USA, unless it is the feasible fact that the votes were due to it being heart throb Depp playing the character, should we be concerned that a character who doesn’t see anything bizarre about singing whilst slitting throats, appeals to children of our generation? (BI, 2014)\n\nAccording to child psychologist George Comstock ‘the contexts in which violent acts occur may help to reveal the potential impact of depicted violence on the child viewer’. In his research he indicates that scenes of murder would be more damaging to young people when they were realistic, if there were no consequences and if the audience felt that they could relate to the character. (Wass, H 2007)\n\nAssuming this to be the case then those ‘one in ten children and young people in the UK affected by depression, anxiety and conduct disorder’ (Mental Health foundation, 2014) who can relate to Todd’s unhappiness with the world, will be more vulnerable to the violence that they see depicted by his character.\n\nA search on picture sharing site Tumblr, ‘of which 61% of teens who use social media use’, reveals that depression is a topic of discussion that many of the young users post about, with 67,600,000 posts categorised by #Depression, and a worrying 3,800,000 categorised by #Suicide (Bennet,S). This has become so much of an issue that the website has added new safeguarding measures so that when you try to search depression it sign posts you to ways of seeking help.\n\nAs you can see from the screen shots and statistics above, depression is a topic which, seems to effect and fascinate young people in equal measure. So does associating light-hearted humour with mental health, as in this Sweeney Todd’s scene, fuel a new market of depressed teens or does it simply supply a pre-existing want?\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe term gothic culture, ‘Suggestive of a dark, morbid outlook on life, but not without a sense of humour’, developed out of the post punk subculture in 1978 (Nocturnum, C 2005). Whereas Tim Burton’s Sweeney Todd; The Demon Barber of Fleet Street came to our screens in 2007. That itself would suggest that the prevalence of this fascination with morbidity in society says more about the intrinsic desire than the impact of this particular film. You’re safe for now Tim Burton! But the character of Sweeney Todd, has been something of fascination way beyond when the term ‘goth’ was ever coined, with the villain first appearing in early penny dreadful’s as ‘someone whom you could scare your kids with’ (Flashpoint, 2001) in early 1847.\n\nThere has been many retellings of Benjamin Barker’s story of varying levels of gruesome, from print to stage and film but all including one vital detail; The protagonists obsession with death. One of the earliest films depicting Todd was by Frederick Hayward in 1936, in this version in order to not completely freak out an audience who were not so accustomed to graphic scenes of blood shooting out of someones neck, Todd almost seems a little less cruel to his victims. Apart from his bizarre laugh.\n\nRather than reenacting a scene from one of the early media texts about Sweeney Todd, we chose the newer Tim Burton text because it is an example of how long the fascination of his character has been around for. For this film to be funded and recreated with a pretty significant budget of $50,000,000, to bring the story alive again for a modern audience (IMDB,2008), there must be a reason why this old story is being dragged on as an important part of our culture. In recreating this scene we noticed the smaller details of the scene which may easily go amiss but still have an impact of a unknowing, possibly young audience.\n\nThe first obvious points to make are that Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter who play the murdering duo are A listers, and therefore ‘With all the media coverage, financial earnings, and glamorous, high-profile lifestyles that these celebrities have, kids perceive this as the epitome of success’ and will therefore look up them (Fitter,J et al 2010). Secondly, Miss Lovett played by Bonham Carter for the most part of the scene has her breasts poking out the top of her thin dress. Although it is worth adding that she is married to the director so this may be partly for his enjoyment, it is something horny teens may be drawn into too, even if this was an area which wouldn’t normally interest them. (Werchmesiter,2012)\n\nAlthough we decided against singing in our remake of the scene (luckily for you), the use of music in the original text goes a large way to shaping the impression of the scene. Whereas the use of music in film is normally associated with happy everyday subjects such as ‘I’m a believer’ in Shrek and ‘I’m singing in the rain’ in..singing in the rain, the parallel between the big orchestral backing and singing about chopping people up definitely challenges the norm. Singing is normally used as a tool to further engage an audience, but if it gets stuck in your head then, singing ‘we all deserve to die’ at the bus stop might raise a few more eyebrows than ‘I wouldn’t leave her if I tried’. And that is saying some thing. According to a study published by the American Psychological Association, ‘songs with violent lyrics increase aggression related thoughts and emotions and this effect is directly related to the violence in the lyrics…Even the humorous violent songs increased aggressive thoughts’ (Anderson,2003)\n\nEven when the eccentric couple are not singing , negative body language on screen has shown to be influential on those watching. Studies done on the “mirroring effect” have clearly shown that people will often subconsciously duplicate the body language of others in a one-to-one interaction. (RBL)\n\nIn post production, in order to make our scene similar to the style of Burton’s we dimmed the exposure and changed the colouring to black and white. The connotations of a dark room being deviancy. Rather than teenage rebellion being a negative thing psychologist Pickhardt,’C (2009) states that ‘Teenage rebellion plays an important part in adolescent growth.’ So it was interesting to note whether this was a negative or positive part of the mise-en-scene to reproduce in our own version.\n\nBut is making A scene about death glamorous and interesting really safe for adolescents?\n\nAccording to Dr Jordan Grafman, of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders “Continued exposure to violent videos will make an adolescent less sensitive to violence, more accepting of violence, and more likely to commit aggressive acts since the emotional component associated with aggression is reduced and normally acts as a brake on aggressive behaviour.” (Telegraph, 2010) So then surely singing counts as a way of reducing the emotional components based around murder and suicide?\n\nNow onto why we chose to create a ‘Toddception’, In depicting a scene which allows for you to watch Todd watching us watching him I wanted to propose this question to the audience:\n\nIf Sweeney Todd were real/had internet access, would that have fuelled his murdering instinct? Or is it just from what we see in real life that can affect someones mental health?\n\nMedia experts have argued for years over how much power an audience has over what they see. Whilst psychology studies above suggest that exposing young people to graphic content as seen in Sweeney Todd could be damaging, Stuart Hall states that we are ‘constantly filtering or resisting content’, so the young audience is not completely passive in what they are seeing. In ‘Media/Cultural studies: Critical Approaches, Hammer,R (2009) adds that other factors such as ‘exposure to similar themes in real life’ can make a person more sensitive and likely to reenact what they see on-screen. But then again, the thing that makes Sweeney Todd watching violence is that it is such an old story. The original writer of the string of pearls penny dreadful episode could not have been exposed to the media and graphic content in the media that we do now but still wrote a horrific tale of murder.\n\nAssuming this to be the case then those adolescents with pre-existing mental health conditions would be most likely to be effected by portrayals of persons with depressive tendencies who act upon them negatively, and may in turn choose to act similarly themselves. But how can we protect them?\n\nAccording to mental health awareness charity WOM (2012) ‘Children tend to hide things from parents that they think will upset them.’ but talking is key to helping a young person with mental health problems and coming to terms with death in a healthy way.\n\nAs the media grows, and as such is harder to monitor, young people will be able to access more and more scenes of a graphic nature about death and murder that slip through the net. And the things that slip through the net are getting worse as producers are having to push the boundaries to appeal to a desensitised audience. It seems that we have always had a fascination with murder, the story of Sweeney Todd for one is old but the discussion of it is still considered deviant and therefore entertaining to a rebellious and hormonal teen audience. I’m not qualified myself to say whether singing about it and taking away that deviance is worse or maybe even better but I do think it is something that should be talked about openly with young people just as I have tried to do in this blog. If it is some thing that we naturally enjoy, talking about it may just be the control that is needed.\n\nWhen myself and Declan reenacted the scene, it wasn’t real (rest assured we have no intention of ever making it that) but it was fun, isn’t that a little ironic?\n\nBibliography; With thanks to\n\nAdams,S.
