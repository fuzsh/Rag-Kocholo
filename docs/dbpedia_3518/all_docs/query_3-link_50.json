        "text": "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1982)\n\nStephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's smash hit operetta about a London barber who seeks revenge on the judge who destroyed his life. The original Broadway production filmed live in Los Angeles starring Angela Lansbury and George Hearn.\n\nStage Production Notes ​\n\n​With music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and a book by Hugh Wheeler, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a “dark operetta” that tells the story of a London barber who seeks revenge on the judge who destroyed his life. Partnering up with Mrs Lovett, owner of the pie shop downstairs, Sweeney slaughters his customers and turns them into pies.\n\nUnlike other shows of the period, Sweeney Todd did not have an out-of-town try-out before its Broadway opening. Following 19 previews, the show opened at the Uris Theatre on March 1, 1979. The production was directed by Harold Prince, and starred Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury.\n\nSweeney Todd received mixed reviews. Writing for the New York Times, Walter Kerr stated that the “performances can scarcely be faulted” though claimed the music got in the way of the story. While lamenting there was “no serious social message” in the show, critic Richard Eder described the score as “fascinating… wicked, witty, [and] muscular” and claimed that Sweeney “is the kind of work… that makes second‐thinking obligatory.”\n\nDespite the critics opinions, Sweeney Todd was nominated for multiple awards. Amongst its many accolades, the production won 8 Tony Awards, including the awards for Best Musical, Best Book of a Musical, Best Original Score, Best Actor in a Musical (Len Cariou), Best Actress in a Musical (Angela Lansbury), Best Scenic Design (Eugene Lee), Best Costume Design (Franne Lee), and Best Director (Harold Prince).\n\nAfter 557 regular performances, the original Broadway production of Sweeney Todd closed on June 29, 1980.\n\nSweeney Todd embarked on national tour, with George Hearn and Angela Lansbury at the helm. The tour played its final stop at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. It was the first production in a joint venture by the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera and American Corporation for the Arts (part of Nederlander) to bring new musical theatre to Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough deemed a commercial flop, Sweeney Todd has become a staple in the musical theatre canon, widely performed at professional and amateur levels. The show has been twice revived on Broadway, received five productions in the West End, and played in countless full-scale and concert versions around the world.\n\nA movie version directed by Tim Burton, and starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter was released 2007 and is available on Amazon Prime (as an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases from this link).\n\nSeven productions of Sweeney Todd have been filmed live for distribution.\n\nNorth American National Tour (1982)\n\nRoyal National Theatre, BBC (1994)\n\nBarcelona Cast, Spanish television (1995)\n\nOpera North, BBC (1998)\n\nSan Francisco Symphony Orchestra and Chorus (2001)\n\nOpera House, BBC (2003)\n\nNew York Philharmonic Concert version, PBS (2014)\n\nFilmed Production Notes\n\nIn the final month of its first national tour, Sweeney Todd was taped over a grueling four days the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles.\n\nSweeney Todd was the first major American musical to be taped while on tour.\n\nSeveral different unions, including the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), and Actors Equity, were all involved in negotiating contracts for the taping.\n\nTwo nights were taped with an audience, although according to the New York Times only “one percent of the footage with an audience was used, primarily shots of the proscenium, the curtain going up, and the audience applauding.” The New York Times also noted that the lighting, make-up, and even some of the performances, were adjusted for the camera.\n\nThe musical was taped for distribution of pay tv. The Entertainment Channel (TEC) reportedly invested $1.5 million in the project. In an unprecedented deal, two Manhattan-based cable companies, Manhattan Cable and Group W, agreed to offer Sweeney Todd to their subscribers (on Channel 6 and Channel 10 respectively), even though they did not normally offer TEC content.\n\nSweeney Todd aired on cable TV on September 12, 1982.\n\nThe program was nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards, winning three, including Outstanding Director in a Variety or Music Program (Terry Hughes), Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program (George Hearn), and Outstanding Videotape Editing for a Limited Series or a Special (Jimmy B. Frazier).\n\nThe taped version received high praise from reviewers. New York Times television critic John J. O’Connor stated that Sweeney Todd “works very well on a small television screen… [and] generates absorbing television.” Billboard magazine noted “This production is poetry for all the senses, and goes a long way toward promoting the recently maligned “promise of cable TV.””\n\nSweeney Todd was released on VHS in 1984. The TLA Film and Video Guide described the video as “magnificently re-created” and “not to be missed.”\n\nHome Warner Video released the musical on DVD in 2004. The release was a digital restoration of the VHS, though DVDTalk reviewer John Sinnott notes the transfer was “not clean.”\n\nTurner Classic Movies aired Sweeney Todd on March 21, 2017. ​It was also briefly available on BroadwayHD (until March 31, 2020).\n\nSweeney Todd is currently available to view on Apple TV, Amazon, and on DVD (as an affiliate, I may earn income from qualifying purchases made through these links).\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street ​PRODUCTION CREDITS\n\nTheatre: Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Los Angeles\n\nProducer: RKO-Nederlander, Entertainment Channel, Ellen M.
