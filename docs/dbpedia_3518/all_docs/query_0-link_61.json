        "text": "Part One of our Cult Cinema Weekend, curated and presented by David Tibet, of British hallucinatory supergroup Current 93, and his partner, visual artist Ania Goszczyńska.\n\nThe film features the terrifying talents of Newcastle’s Norman Carter—otherwise known as ‘Tod’—Slaughter – the first true icon of British horror cinema. Unlike his contemporaries, such as Boris Karloff and Charles Laughton, Tod Slaughter never left his native shores. Instead, he chose to make his mark in Britain by transferring his most sensational theatrical performances to the screen.\n\nPortraying every kind of cruel and cunning criminal – from petty thief to mass murderer – Slaughter became the first great villain of British horror, at a time before the Grand Guignol of Hammer Films began to take hold, without once donning monster make-up.\n\nCriminally overlooked by film historians, and only previously seen in compromised versions, these cult cinema classics have been newly restored using original film materials preserved at the BFI National Archive.\n\nAs part of this special presentation, we are also screening “London After Dark”, a short silent film featuring Tod Slaughter’s first ever cinematic appearance, with an original Current 93 soundtrack, alongside a collective listen to the original radio broadcast of Tod Slaughter and Company performing Sweeney Todd.\n\nWe are delighted that David Tibet will introduce the film in person, before his sold-out performance with Current 93 in Hastings later the same evening, and following their also sold-out London appearance the night before.\n\nWe will also be displaying some of David’s and Ania’s original artworks as part of the Cult Cinema Weekend.\n\nHow you can support the Electric Palace:\n\nBook a ticket to a screening.\n\nBecome an official Friend of the Electric Palace\n\nHire the cinema for a private party\n\nBuy a gift voucher\n\nDonate to the cinema\n\nSign up to receive our enewsletter\n\nPlay our piano before a screening and see the film for free!\n\nSupport us on social media by sharing our posts and events"
