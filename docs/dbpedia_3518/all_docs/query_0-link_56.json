        "text": "Last month, Stephen Sondheim, one of the greatest composers in Broadway history, died at the age of 91. This may not have been something to commemorate here if not for one thing: Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. It’s my favourite musical of all time, and, by an extraordinary coincidence, it’s set in Britain, and even has a film adaptation. So, I think I should probably dive into it.\n\nThe History of Sweeney Todd in a Nutshell\n\nIn 1384, in the 4th Arrondissement of Paris, Barnabé Cabard and Pierre Miquelon set up a partnership that would change the world forever. Or at least a small part of it. Cabard and Miquelon were a barber and patissiere. And if you’re familiar with the story of Sweeney Todd, you know exactly where this is going. Well, maybe not the part where their pâte even had the King of France singing their praises, or the fact that they were caught because one of their victims had a dog with some serious Greyfriars Bobby instincts. They were burned alive, along with their shops, and a statue of the dog was erected on the site, where it stood until the 1850s. The site of the murders is now a motorcycle garage for the Paris Police Department.\n\nAround the time the dog’s statue was being demolished, the story spread to England. While it’s hard to find the first reference in English, it was generally spread in the country to represent their fears of life in the larger cities, and by 1843, Charles Dickens had a character in Martin Chuzzlewit think himself grateful that his “evil genius did not lead him into the dens of any of those preparers of cannibalic pastry, who are represented in many country legends as doing a lively retail business in the metropolis.” And, eventually, in 1846, these legends coalesced into a single character named Sweeney Todd in the anonymous Penny Dreadful The String of Pearls.\n\nWhile it didn’t have anywhere near the level of polish or psychological depth that would be associated with the musical, Sweeney still had his same MO: slitting the throats of his victims, sending the corpses down a chute into a meat grinder, where they’ll be served to Mrs. Lovett’s customers, and it was famous enough that George Didpin Pitt gave it an adaptation before serialization of the original was even completed. Pitt even created a catchphrase that would persist for over a century: “I’ll polish him off.” And for decades, people kept remaking the legend, and there was even a film adaptation, with Sweeney played by the very aptly-named Tod Slaughter. The film’s in the public domain and can be found with trivial ease, but here’s a little short made during the filming:\n\nAnd in 1973, Christopher Bond wrote a play called Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, that changed everything. Sweeney Todd was no longer a pure sadist, but a wrongfully convicted barber who spent 15 years in a penal colony for a crime he didn’t commit, because Judge Turpin wanted to screw his wife. And when he loses his chance to kill the Judge, he becomes a serial killer, and joins forces with his former landlady, Mrs. Lovett to turn the bodies into… frankly, if you know the musical, you know the rest by heart. Six years later, Stephen Sondheim turned Bond’s play into a musical, and, frankly, the musical doesn’t really change much from Bond’s play. But for most people who know the name Sweeney Todd these days, odds are, they’ll know the musical long before anything else.\n\nMy History of Sweeney Todd\n\nI was introduced to Sweeney Todd in one of the weirdest ways possible: it was a major plot point in Kevin Smith’s Jersey Girl, when, after missing out on the chance to see Cats, she picks one of the worst possible substitutes for a seven-year-old girl to watch:\n\nAlso, the fact that Ben Affleck uses the “there’s a lot of singing” excuse to dissuade Gertie from watching Sweeney Todd is especially odd, since her first choice, Cats, was almost entirely sung-through, and Sweeney Todd is only about 80% sung through.\n\nAnd she loves it enough that she actually does a number for her talent show:\n\nThe movie’s nothing special, and even George Carlin (peace be unto him) couldn’t make it too special, and I probably wouldn’t have remembered it if not for the musical parts. I saw the scenes about the musical, and I was gobsmacked: How the Hell is this a Broadway musical? What musical has this bloodspray? Hell, what musical sounds this experimental? I looked it up on Wikipedia, and I was really intrigued by what I read there. And, while I didn’t have YouTube back then, the movie had enough of the music to get me intrigued, and, by an extraordinary stroke of luck, my local library had a copy of the 2001 concert production. After a listen or two, it had become my favorite musical: the tragedy was engrossing, I was old enough that I was really getting intrigued by all the violence, and the music, there was really nothing like it.\n\nI was getting into classical music at the time, and not just normal classical music, but 20th Century Classical, where tonality was getting thrown out the window, and everything started to go truly insane. And this show sounded a lot like the music I was starting to listen to, albeit in a more accessible form. It sounded closer to Schoenberg’s Vienna than Broadway, and throughout much of high school, I could probably do most of the musical by heart. And as my singing voice deepened into a bass-baritone, and as my misanthropy grew further entrenched, I actually grew to identify with Sweeney. When I had a theater class in my senior year of high school, and she talked about us potentially doing a musical, I immediately volunteered Sweeney Todd. She refused because there was currently a national tour, and she didn’t expect the rights holders to allow a high school in Niles to do so. But, for the record, I saw that national tour, the production that John Doyle originated in London in 2004, and had the entire cast double as the orchestra. My family managed to get front-row tickets to it at the Cadillac Palace Theatre, and the only real quibble I can remember having with the show was that David Hess’ Sweeney didn’t play guitar like Michael Cerveris did in the New York version. I still have fond enough memories of the production that my father and I are currently in the process of bringing the shirt I bought at the concession booth back to life.\n\nBut, around that same time, Tim Burton bought the rights to the musical, and he actually managed to turn it into a movie. How well did it go?\n\nThe Great Bits, Style and Substance\n\nWhatever flaws Tim Burton may have, and he has many, (and they’d be on full display when he did his next movie, Alice in Wonderland), Tim Burton is a director who always finds a way to create a spooky and breathtaking Gothic atmosphere, and this, one of the few films he made to take place in Britain, and Victorian Britain at that, is probably the film where it really has a chance to shine. Rather ironic, since the London of Sweeney Todd is a gloomy place:\n\nIt’s the sort of place where the pea-soupers and the factories’ smoke have given everything a blue-greyish mist that covers everything and it’s only the wind that keeps it from being obviously dangerous, but enough about the Great Smog of 1952. It’s the sort of place where so many crimes were punishable by death (due to the Bloody Code) that judges think nothing of condemning innocent boys to death because they probably did something to deserve death, even if they’re innocent this time. It’s the sort of place where a pre-pubescent boy can be saddled with manual labour, develop a drinking problem, and still have this be a step up from life in the work house. It’s a world where an emaciated baker can think nothing of smashing cockroaches on the same surfaces where she prepares her meat pies. And it’s one where the only way she can get by is by killing. Maybe she doesn’t have to kill herself, but she does have to grind up the bodies of the dead and turn them into pies.\n\nAnd, for better or for worse, when I think of these characters in my head, I don’t see George Hearn, Angela Lansbury, Patti LuPone, Neil Patrick Harris, or, for that matter, any of the cast of the version I saw in theaters, (even if, I have to admit, I prefer the original filmed production and the concert production to the film, for reasons I’ll go into later); I see the versions Tim Burton put on screen, in their larger-than-life grotesqueries. I see Sweeney with hair like Beethoven and a skunk stripe for reasons I can only assume are Australia-related. I see Mrs. Lovett as an emaciated, sleep-deprived woman. I see the Beadle as Peter Pettigrew having become flesh and made his dwelling among us. And I see Tobias as a young boy, one who’s lived a hard enough life that he’s already drinking bottles of gin and who will only get worse as things go on. On that note, there’s a lot of fans who debate whether or not Tobias works better as a child or as an adult (with some mental issues), but, given his childlike devotion to Mrs. Lovett and what I know about Victorian England, the child version makes more sense, although, to be perfectly honest, it only makes sense to have an adult play him. It’s a difficult role for a child to do, and I suspect that not that many kids can get down to Bb2. And I suspect that many of the ones that can would rather be doing Sweeney.\n\nAnd what better image to end on than the warped version of the Pieta that Sweeney (and Tobias) ended up inadvertently creating?\n\nBut there are some problems. The original show, uncut, is about 2 and a half hours long. The movie, with credits, is a few minutes shy of two hours. So, naturally, there’s cuts. But where to cut? There are a few obvious places to cut. Listening to the full-length version of the barbering battle between Sweeney and Pirelli, let’s face it, you get the point after the first round. You could potentially justify going on and belaboring the point by having it be Pirelli desperately attempting to win with additional rounds, long after it’s become clear how the tide has turned, but if you’re looking for places to cut, this is easily the most obvious place.\n\nAnd, as great as the Ballad of Sweeney Todd is, it’s one of those devices that works better on stage than on film, especially since the Greek Chorus is not a convention that’s carried over into film. To quote the man himself: “Why have a chorus singing about ‘attending the tale of Sweeney Todd’ when you could just go ahead and attend it?” Burton apparently planned on having them in the movie, with a chorus including Christopher Lee and Anthony Head, but he cut it during filming, so he didn’t have to spend more time filming after Johnny Depp’s daughter Lily-Rose had a serious illness and Johnny had to attend to her (she’s fine now). And, let’s face it, obvious CGI aside, this opening credits sequence that includes the song in instrumental is a good substitute:\n\nBut the one place where the film starts to suffer from its cuts is the subplot with Anthony and Johanna. It’s, honestly, a change from the unremitting violence and bleakness of the main plot, so, I can understand why it didn’t appeal to Burton. But, watching it over last Friday, I kept finding myself asking “Did I miss something?” by the time the segments with Anthony and Johanna came and went. “Kiss Me,” which helps develop their relationship, is removed entirely, and, apart from the wig-making sequence and the scene where Johanna witnesses Todd kill the Judge from the steamer trunk, they may as well not have even been in the second half. When you become obsessed with a show like this, you start to notice cuts like this. But, then again, these changes at least had the blessing of Stephen Sondheim. He wasn’t a big fan of movie musicals, and was okay with cutting parts of it to keep the pace going, and the film’s musical producer Mike Higham would even send Sondheim MP3s of the shortened versions of the songs for Sondheim’s approval. And Sondheim himself said of the cuts that “if you just go along with it, I think you’ll have a spectacular time.” So, if Sondheim himself loved it, who am I to complain? And he loved it well enough that he had Jonathan Tunick, the orchestrator of the original musical, expand the orchestra from 27 players to 78. But, this is related to what is probably the biggest problem with the film. But before I get into it, I have to get something out of the way.\n\nOffering a Bale of Hay to the Elephant in the Room.\n\nWhen I reviewed Murder on the Orient Express in November 2017, I did something that I’ve come to really regret. Johnny Depp was in the film, and this wouldn’t be much to talk about if not for the fact that, for Depp, this was a perfect storm of a hellish situation. The #Metoo movement was becoming prominent, and every time a celebrity was being outed as a predator, there’d be a LOT of discourse about how their entire oeuvre was tainted by their association with him (and it was usually a him). And around this time, Depp was being divorced from his second wife, Amber Heard, and she was claiming that he was a domestic abuser. Around the same time, there was a teaser image from Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them: The Crimes of Grindlewald, and people were fuming that Depp was still involved. In an effort to appease these social media hive minds (the same kind I had railed against when I took on “Hated in the Nation” less than a month prior, mind you), I decided to say (and I suspect that this may have been colored by my annoyance at his selling out) that if you were worried about seeing the movie if Depp is involved, you could take solace that he gets butchered after 10 minutes of screentime.\n\nThis was something known in some circles as a “bad idea.” In an attempt at appeasing these types, I became the target of hatred from his defenders. I made it worse when I tried to defend myself, and Jonathan even told me to stop. For years, I avoided talking about him. When Crimes of Grindlewald came out, I seriously considered doing a review of it where I would side-step the controversy by never referring to Depp by name, at least until I watched it and decided the movie wasn’t interesting enough for a review. But then, when I took on another Ken Branagh film, Hamlet, for my 1000th column, I decided to apologize to Depp, especially since some potentially exculpatory evidence had come out. And then, a few months later, Depp lost a libel case, and he’s lost his job as Grindlewald anyway. Frankly, looking at the facts of the case, I’m not even going to pretend that I know what happened, and, when it comes to assessing an actor’s performance, I don’t even believe the bad things they do offscreen should matter in how good a job they do. Why, yes, that does make the snide remark I made against him then even worse.\n\nI personally believe an artist’s work should not be judged by the artist’s life outside of said work. Even if Johnny Depp’s committed crimes in real life that made him worse than Sweeney Todd (which absolutely nobody involved in his life seems to have alleged), if he still made performances as touching as Edward Scissorhands, as endearing as Ed Wood, or as enjoyably depraved as Raoul Duke, his hypothetical real-life actions wouldn’t make them any worse in my eyes. If I didn’t learn this lesson when I fell in love with J.D. Salinger’s work and find out he was an abusive father and boyfriend who drank his own pee, I certainly would have learned it when I got into German Expressionist cinema and found out that the majority of the people involved (the lucky few who didn’t flee to America, die before 1945, or both) would likely have been complicit in crimes against humanity. And, if there was a chance that the person in question is innocent, but has still lost this game, that just makes it even worse. Some may not like this stance, but whatever keeps me from spiraling head-first into nihilism like Sweeney did. So, I guess that, before I go into his performance, all I have to say to Johnny Depp is, sorry about everything. Good thing Minamata‘s finally coming out soon. I’m hearing some good things about it, and hopefully, if you can get more work after this outside of animated series about puffins, it might be a good opportunity for you to go back to your roots.\n\nAnd on to Depp’s Sweeney Todd, I have to say, I love his intensity, I love his rage, I can really see the vulnerability he shows when he’s confronted with the truth about his wife (either the actual truth or Mrs. Lovett’s version of events). There’s one real problem with his performance, and it’s by no means confined to him: his singing is weak. A lot of the time, it struggles to compete with the audience. Take this scene:\n\nGeorge Hearn, Len Cariou, Michael Cerveris didn’t have any real trouble competing with the orchestra, but Depp struggles to compete. His voice isn’t bad, and, indeed, he actually took the time to do some extra vocal training. He’s just not loud enough, and Tim Burton didn’t think to tinker with the volume levels so it doesn’t seem so obvious. He’s not even a bass-baritone. And, frankly, Helena Bonham Carter is even worse in this regard. Watching one of the behind the scenes features on the DVD, she even said that, if you were starting out in movie musicals, don’t play Mrs. Lovett as your first role. For the record, many of the other characters, particularly Sacha Baron-Cohen and Alan Rickman do well with what they have, although I suspect that if they included the Judge’s version of “Johanna,” it might not have done so well.\n\nHowever, I think this is a problem bigger than this movie; since musical films fell out of vogue in the 1960s (one that lasts to this day; seriously, look at the trailer again and notice how long it took before you figured out it was even a musical), you lost an entire class of movie stars that Hollywood never really bothered to repopulate: actors and actresses who could sing, and not just sing, but could hold their own against such a devilishly complicated score. The most recent film adaptation of a musical that could truly compete against the stage version that I can remember is Cabaret, and that was almost half a century ago. And, no, the Hamilton movie doesn’t count, since it was just a filmed version of the play.\n\nI mean, think about it: it’s hard enough to cast Sweeney in theatre. For one thing, he has to go down to F2 (that’s just a half-step higher than the lowest string on the guitar). And with a musical, especially one with a $50 million budget, let’s be realistic: who do you know who can go that low, compete with the score, AND can get enough butts in the seats to recoup the budget? Go ahead, I’ll wait. I suppose you could just say “To Hell with it,” and just cast singers who could truly pull it off, but I could easily imagine that flying with the big producers in Hollywood. “Who the fuck are Patti LuPone and George Heard?” I imagine him asking, “I know who Neil Patrick Harris is, but do you think Doogie Howser is enough to get people into the theater? What’s that? He’s Barney Stinson now? Whatever, he’s not going to be enough to get people to go in.” That said, I think we can probably guess that Depp and Carter were cast less out of a need to sell tickets and more because they were, by this point, part of the Tim Burton Repertory Company. And, for all its many, MANY, flaws, at least the Cats movie managed to get Taylor Swift, who is at least both a good singer AND popular enough that people would see her in a movie. Then again, Andrew Lloyd-Weber ain’t Sondheim.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOverall, despite all the time I spent talking about how the leads’ singing is inadequate, I can still recommend it. It’s still the same great story with some great visuals, and they’re at least trying to do justice to the music, even if they don’t always succeed.\n\nIf you like it, I recommend you also watch either the film of the original Broadway version or the recordings of the concert version from 2001, since they’re even better.\n\nFrankly, even 42 years after it premiered, there’s still nothing that really comes close to Sweeney Todd. Maybe in terms of sheer violence, Repo: The Genetic Opera:\n\nBut that’s more a film than a theatrical musical. Maybe if Trent Reznor tries for a Tony (he’s got an Emmy, Grammy, and an Oscar, so he might as well try for the Grand Slam) he can attempt it. Or maybe if someone decides to make a musical based on Titus Andronicus or one of Sarah Kane’s earlier plays. And even then, I doubt they could make it as intricate as Sondheim’s work.\n\nAnd, hopefully, now that Get Back and Sweeney Todd are out of the way, I can get back to covering musical news."
