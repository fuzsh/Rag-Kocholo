        "text": "Welcome to this, the eleventh instalment in The Third Annual October Scare Fest!\n\nHorror film Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street based on the story The String of Pearls and the urban legend of the titular serial killer barber. In the 1830s, Sweeney Todd (Tod Slaughter – an apt name) runs a barber shop in London where he kills wealthy customers with no family and takes their wealth, which he splits with pie shop owner/next door neighbour Mrs. Lovatt (Stella Rho) as she hides the bodies. Lovatt, however, grows tired of the fact that Todd keeps giving her less than her share, so she begins plotting to bring him down with the help of sailor Mark (Bruce Seton).\n\nPROS\n\nDirector George King and the screenwriters create tension early on by showing Todd to be a sinister and mysterious figure and then ratchet it up well by making his sadism, homicidal desires, greed and remorselessness increasingly clear.\n\nTod Slaughter gives one of those deliciously camp and theatrical turns that is quintessentially 1930s’ horror, and in doing so unnervingly conveys Todd’s sadistic and ultimately unhinged nature.\n\nThe production design department do a good job in creating the device that sends customers to their deaths and give the cellar below a real claustrophobic quality. Meanwhile the costume department do a good job with period clothing.\n\nCONS\n\nAt times George King and the screenwriters’ depiction of Todd’s horrific deeds feels very restrained, not least because of half-hearted use of implication.\n\nOverall the narrative is quite rushed and the events underdeveloped as the film has a runtime of 66 minutes, yet not all of it is used well – notably there is a sloppily-executed scene set in Africa that was not needed and infuriatingly depicts the natives as primitive and savage.\n\nA number of weak supporting cast members – some are subdued, whereas others are unnecessarily theatrical and visibly struggle to transition from stage to screen.\n\nVERDICT: 5/10\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
