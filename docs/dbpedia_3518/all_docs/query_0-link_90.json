        "text": "POLSON - The Port Polson Players provide the tricks, and audiences get their treats on the last weekend of October and the first one of November.\n\nThe summer theater group is keeping the fires going well into fall to produce \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" over the Halloween season.\n\nThe murderous musical thriller stars John Mercer as Todd, the London barber who takes more than a little off the top, and Wendi Arnold as Mrs. Lovett, who helps him dispose of the resulting bodies.\n\nHow? Let's just say Mrs. Lovett's meat pie shop doesn't have to order in a lot of meat.\n\nThe fictional Sweeney Todd made his first appearance in what were known as \"penny dreadfuls\" - cheap 1800s-era British publications filled with lurid stories that sold for a penny.\n\nTodd was a character in a series called \"The String of Pearls: A Romance.\" In the stories, the barber pulled a lever that sent his barbershop clients tumbling backward through a trapdoor.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nHe'd then go into the basement and finish them off with his straight razor.\n\nTodd's place in the plot changed dramatically over the years - his homicidal ways are now sparked by a corrupt judge who stole Todd's wife - and Mrs. Lovett and the meat pies were also added.\n\n\"Sweeney Todd\" first appeared on film in 1936. It was made into a ballet in 1959.\n\nIn 1979, Stephen Sondheim turned the tale into a Tony Award-winning Broadway musical thriller.\n\nOne of \"Todd's\" most recent reincarnations was as a film again, this one in 2007 starring Johnny Depp.\n\nThirty Mission Valley actors and musicians are part of the Port Polson Players' Halloween production of \"Sweeney Todd.\"\n\nReporter Vince Devlin can be reached at 1-800-366-7186 or at vdevlin@missoulian.com.\n\nYou must be logged in to react.\n\nClick any reaction to login.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
