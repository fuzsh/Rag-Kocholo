        "text": "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2023 Broadway Cast Recording) will be released as a 2-CD set on Friday, December 15, 2023 and a 3-LP set in March. Both versions will feature a 40-page booklet with full libretto, production photos, and an essay by Washington Post theater writer Peter Marks. The album was released on streaming and digital platforms earlier this season. The album is currently nominated for the 2024 Grammy Award for “Best Musical Theater Album.” The acclaimed Broadway revival stars Tony and Grammy-nominated multi-platinum recording artist Josh Groban and Tony Award winner Annaleigh Ashford, and is directed by Thomas Kail. Featuring music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and a book by Hugh Wheeler, from an adaptation by Christopher Bond, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street began performances on February 26, and opened on March 26, at Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theatre (205 West 46th St, New York, NY 10036). Producer Jeffrey Seller is leading the revival. Produced by Alex Lacamoire and co-produced by Thomas Kail, the cast recording will feature Jonathan Tunick's expansive original 26-player orchestration from the original production. Listen to the album, and pre-order the CD and vinyl sets, at artsmusic.lnk.to/SweeneyTodd2023\n\nFor the cast album, joining Groban as Sweeney Todd and Ashford as Mrs. Lovett are Jordan Fisher (Hamilton, Dear Evan Hansen) as Anthony, Gaten Matarazzo (“Stranger Things”) as Tobias, Tony Award winner and Laurence Olivier Award nominee Ruthie Ann Miles (The King and I) as Beggar Woman, Maria Bilbao (On Your Feet!) as Johanna, Jamie Jackson (The Last Ship) as Judge Turpin, John Rapson (Les Misérables) as Beadle Bamford, and Nicholas Christopher (Hamilton) as Pirelli / Standby for Sweeney Todd\n\nThe cast also includes Galyana Castillo (Waitress), Jonathan Christopher (Hamilton), Dwayne Cooper (Motown), Kyrie Courter (Ragtime), Taeler Cyrus (Wicked), Timothy Hughes (Hadestown), Paul-Jordan Jansen (Beauty and the Beast), Alicia Kaori (The King and I), Michael Kuhn (Le nozze di Figaro), Raymond J. Lee (Groundhog Day), Megan Ort (Cats), Patricia Phillips (The Phantom of the Opera), Mia Pinero (West Side Story), Samantha Pollino (Hamilton), Lexi Rabadi (Beauty and the Beast), Nathan Salstone (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child), Kristie Dale Sanders (Oklahoma!), Stephen Tewksbury (The Phantom of the Opera), Daniel Torres (The Music Man), Felix Torrez-Ponce (Newsies), Jeanna de Waal (Diana, The Musical), DeLaney Westfall (Kinky Boots) and Hennessy Winkler (Oklahoma!).\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is the winner of two 2023 Tony Awards for “Best Lighting Design of a Musical” (Natasha Katz) and “Best Sound Design of a Musical” (Nevin Steinberg). The production was nominated for six additional 2023 Tony Awards, including “Best Revival of a Musical,” “Best Leading Actor in a Musical” for Josh Groban, “Best Leading Actress in a Musical” for Annaleigh Ashford, and “Best Featured Actress in a Musical” for Ruthie Ann Miles. Sweeney Todd is also the winner of three 2023 Drama Desk Awards: “Outstanding Lead Performance in a Musical” (Annaleigh Ashford), “Outstanding Direction of a Musical” (Thomas Kail), and “Outstanding Lighting Design of a Musical” (Natasha Katz). Annaleigh Ashford also received the 2023 Drama League “Distinguished Performance Award” for her role as Mrs. Lovett.\n\nFor the first time since 1980, Broadway audiences will experience Stephen Sondheim's Tony Award-winning score as it was performed in the original production—with Jonathan Tunick's original 26-player orchestration on an epic scale. Tony Award–winning director Thomas Kail (Hamilton) helms the return of this musical thriller starring Tony and Grammy nominee Josh Groban (Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812) as Sweeney Todd, and Tony winner Annaleigh Ashford (Sunday in the Park with George, Kinky Boots) as Mrs. Lovett.\n\nThe original Broadway production of Sweeney Todd was the winner of eight 1980 Tony Awards including Best Musical, Best Book, Best Score, and Best Direction for Hal Prince. Its London premiere won the 1980 Olivier Award for Best Musical.\n\nStephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's landmark musical, from an adaptation by Christopher Bond, tells the tale of a resourceful pie shop owner and a vengeful barber out for blood. After he's sent away by a corrupt judge, Sweeney returns to London years later seeking his long-lost family, and forms an unlikely partnership with Mrs. Lovett, who serves up pies underneath his former shop. Together, they wreak havoc on Fleet Street and serve up the hottest – and most unsettling – pies in London.\n\nTony winner Alex Lacamoire also serves as Music Supervisor, and Olivier Award winner Steven Hoggett choreographs with set design by Tony Award winner Mimi Lien, costume design by Tony Award nominee Emilio Sosa, lighting design by seven-time Tony Award winner Natasha Katz, and sound design by Tony Award winner Nevin Steinberg. J. Jared Janas serves as Wig, Hair, & Makeup Designer and special effects design is by Jeremy Chernick. Casting is by The Telsey Office. Baseline Theatrical serves as General Manager. Cody Renard Richard serves as Production Stage Manager.\n\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2023 Broadway Cast Recording) – Track List\n\n1) Prelude\n\n2) The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\n\n3) No Place Like London\n\n4) The Barber and His Wife\n\n5) The Worst Pies in London\n\n6) Poor Thing\n\n7) My Friends\n\n8) Green Finch and Linnet Bird\n\n9) Ah, Miss\n\n10) Johanna\n\n11) Pirelli's Miracle Elixir\n\n12) The Contest\n\n13) Wait\n\n14) Kiss Me (Pt. 1)\n\n15) Ladies in Their Sensitivities\n\n16) Kiss Me (Pt. 2)\n\n17) Pretty Women (Pt. 1)\n\n18) Pretty Women (Pt. 2)\n\n19) Epiphany\n\n20) A Little Priest\n\n21) God, That's Good!\n\n22) Johanna (Act 2 Sequence)\n\n23) By the Sea\n\n24) The Letter\n\n25) Not While I'm Around\n\n26) Parlor Song\n\n27) City on Fire!\n\n28) Searching\n\n29) The Judge's Return\n\n30) Final Scene\n\n31) The Barber and His Wife (Reprise)\n\n32) The Ballad of Sweeney Todd (Finale)"
