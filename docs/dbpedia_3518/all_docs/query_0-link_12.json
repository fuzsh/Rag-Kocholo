        "text": "“It keeps getting bloodier by the scene, yet remains curiously engaging.” – Outlook\n\nEvil Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) lusts for the beautiful wife of a London barber (Johnny Depp) and transports him to Australia for a crime he did not commit. Returning after 15 years and calling himself Sweeney Todd, the now-mad man vows revenge, applying his razor to unlucky customers and shuttling the bodies down to Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who uses them in her meat-pie shop. Though many fall to his blade, he will not be satisfied until he slits Turpin’s throat.\n\nEDIBLE CINEMA ADD-ON\n\nDelight in this Edible Cinema experience with the best pies in Royersford: True Blue Bakery offers your choice of a beef or chicken meat pie, included with your ticket. We’ll understand when you exclaim ‘God, that’s good!’\n\n*Edible Cinema choice of a beef or chicken meat pie cut off is Oct 20!"
