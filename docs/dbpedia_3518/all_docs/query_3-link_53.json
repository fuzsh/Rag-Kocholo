        "text": "Next comes a November 2007 Sweeney Todd Press Conference that fills 19 minutes, 42 seconds. The panel includes Burton, Depp, Carter, Rickman, Zanuck, and actor Timothy Spall.\n\nLike most press conferences, this one stays pretty light and focuses on general questions. Its still entertaining, though, especially since its nice to see all the films principals together.\n\nWith that we head to eight featurettes. A look at the facts behind the fiction comes from the 20-minute, eight-second Sweeney Is Alive! The Real History of The Demon Barber.\n\nIt includes remarks from Burton, The Real Story of the Demon Barber of Fleet Street author Peter Haining, Open University (UK) Research Fellow in Literature Dr. Rosalind Crone, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography editor Dr. Lawrence Goldman, LSU Professor of English Sharon Aronofsky Weltman, Penny Dreadful expert Helen Smith, and crime historian Donald Rumbelow.\n\nAlive seeks to investigate how much potential truth exists behind the Todd tale. It traces potential inspirations as well as the development of macabre literature in 19th century England and the iterations of the Todd story over the years. Alive gives us a good little take on the background behind the musical.\n\nWe get a look at the origins of the production via Musical Mayhem: Sondheims Sweeney Todd. This 12-minute, five-second show features Sondheim, Higham, Parkes, MacDonald, and screenwriter/producer John Logan.\n\nMayhem tells us about the development of the stage show as well as its adaptation for the screen. The best parts of Mayhem deal with the original Todd, and I wish we got more about it, especially in terms of how it differs from the movie. The rest of the piece is okay but it tends to become a bit fluffy after we shift to the film areas.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the storys locations, go to Sweeneys London. It fills 16 minutes, 17 seconds with notes from Rumbelow, Haining, Goldman, and Crone.\n\nThe program discusses the realities of London in the 18th and 19th centuries. It offers good background for more of the reality behind the Todd tale and entertains as it informs.\n\nA better glimpse of the film production comes from the 24-minute, three-second The Making of Sweeney Todd. It gives us remarks from Burton, Sondheim, Depp, Spall, Carter, Zanuck, Bower, Rickman, MacDonald, Parkes, Logan, Witkin, Higham, makeup and hair designer Peter Owen, associate producer Derek Frey, costume designer Colleen Atwood, production designer Dante Ferretti, director of photography Dariusz Wolski, food stylist Katherine Tidy, special effects supervisor Joss Williams, property master David Balfour, and actors Jayne Wisener and Edward Sanders.\n\nThe show covers story and characters, cast and performances, translating the stage piece to the screen and Burtons take on the material, various visual elements, aspects of the music, and general thoughts. A few good notes emerge, especially when we look at costume, production and prop design.\n\nHowever, the main emphasis here is on promotion, so expect a lot of remarks about how wonderful everything is. This is a puffy program.\n\nGrand Guignol: A Theatrical Tradition lasts 19 minutes, 16 seconds. In it we hear from Cardiff School of Creative and Cultural Industries Professors Richard J. Hand and Michael Wilson, The Grand Guignol: Theatre of Fear and Terror author Mel Gordon, Le Theatre du Grand-Guignol director Charles Nonons great-grandson Eric Horton, Thrillpeddlers Hypnodrome producer Russell Blackwood, and Thrillpeddlers co-founder/playwright Daniel Zilber.\n\nWe get an examination of the history of Grand Guignol theater and aspects of the genre. Tradition digs into the subject well and proves quite informative.\n\nSome visual elements come up during the eight-minute, 56-second Designs for a Demon Barber. It provides notes from Atwood, Ferretti, Burton, and set decorator Francesca Lo Schiavo.\n\nThis one checks out set design, costumes, and some other visual elements. It throws out good details about that side of the production, especially when Atwood gives us a tour of the costumes.\n\nNext comes the eight-minute, 53-second A Bloody Business with its statements from prosthetics creator Neal Scanlan. He goes the processes used to execute the throat-slitting scenes as well as a few other violent bits. Scanlan offers a nice tour and lets us learn the ins and outs of these gory sequences.\n\nFor more from the films two principals, we get Moviefone Unscripted With Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. During this 11-minute, 34-second piece, they take questions sent in by viewers.\n\nNot a lot of meat emerges, but some interesting bits do crop up, such as when Depp tells us which of his characters hed most want to meet in real-life. Its entertaining.\n\nOur final featurette lasts eight minutes, 40 seconds. The Razors Refrain actually offers a collection of stills accompanied by music from the film. Most of the images depict scenes from the flick, though a few behind the scenes shots appear as well.\n\nIts essentially a Cliffs Notes version of the story, as it follows events through images and songs. Im not sure what point it serves, though if you only have a few minutes to watch Todd, thisll do the trick.\n\nIn addition to the films trailer, we discover a Photo Gallery with 51 shots. Most of these cover the same territory viewed in Refrain, though we also get some promotional images and a few design sketches. It offers a nice little collection.\n\nAn unusually bloody and gloomy musical, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street does not offer a cheerful night at the movies. The film adaptation of the production creates a dark and involving piece. As for the 4K, it boasts excellent picture and solid audio as well as a mostly useful and interesting compilation of supplements. Both the 4K and the movie satisfy and deserve my recommendation.\n\nNote that as of October 2023, this Sweeney Todd 4K can be purchased solely as part of a five-movie \"Paramount Scares box. That package also includes 4K UHD releases for Rosemarys Baby, Pet Sematary (1989), Crawl (2019) and Smile (2022).\n\nThe package provides a special edition of Fangoria magazine along with some movie-related stickers. Although the Sweeney Todd 4K remains exclusive to Paramount Scares circa fall 2023, the other four movies can be purchased on 4K individually."
