Anfinsen, Stanford Moore, and William H. Stein share a Nobel Prize in Chemistry, with Anfinsen cited for his work on ribonuclease, especially concerning the connection between the amino acid sequence and the biologically active conformation, and Moore and Stein cited for their contribution to the understanding of the connection between chemical structure and catalytic activity of the active centre of the ribonuclease molecule.\n\nBob Bakker publishes \"Anatomical and Ecological Evidence of Endothermy in Dinosaurs\" in Nature, arguing that dinosaurs were warm-blooded animals.\n\nHarry Whittington shows a preliminary reconstruction of the Burgess Shale species Opabinia at a Palaeontological Association meeting, and the crowd roars with laughter.\n\nIn the late summer of 1973, Republican Vice President Spiro Agnew was under investigation by the United States Attorney's office in Baltimore, Maryland, on charges of extortion, tax fraud, bribery and conspiracy.

If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\"\n\nHeinz Tobien collects a primate tooth fragment from limestone rocks in southern Germany.
