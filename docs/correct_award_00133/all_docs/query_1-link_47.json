        "text": "“One of the most important poets of the contemporary West”\n\nPublishers Weekly\n\nThis first book of Montale’s poems is one of the greatest of modern poetry. Although it has been translated into English at various occasions, Antonio Mazza’s translation should be praised and recognised as one of the best. Mazza has been translating Montale for some years. This choice would seem to be a matter of faithfulness to the voice whose language, also Mazza’s mother tongue, is Italian, with all its musical, rhythmical, incantatory and lexical implications.\n\nEugenio Montale is widely considered the greatest Italian lyric poet since Giacomo Leopardi, and his work has won an admiring readership throughout the world. Among his many awards and honors, he received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1975.\n\nAntonino Mazza is a poet, author, and translator widely recognized for his acclaimed translations of Eugenio Montale’s works. His reissue of The City Without Women: A Chronicle of Internment Life in Canada During World War II(published by Mosaic Press, 1994), won the Brutium “Calabria” Gold Medal in Rome and inspired the NFB documentary Barbed Wire and Mandolins (1997). He lives in Ottawa and teaches at Carleton University."
