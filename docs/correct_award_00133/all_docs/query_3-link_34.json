        "text": "The Italian Modernities Lecture Series will host a discussion panel - Impazzito di luce: A Discussion of Poems by Eugenio Montale.\n\nThe panel will feature Robert Harrison (Rosina Pierotti Professor of Italian Literature at Stanford University), Thomas Harrison (Professor of Italian at UCLA), Dr. Elena Monzani (Lead Scientist at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory), and Laura Wittman (Professor of French and Italian at Stanford University).\n\nEugenio Montale (1896-1981), author of collections including Ossi di sepia (Cuttlefish Bones), and Le occasioni (The Occasions), remains one of Italy's most widely recognised and highly esteemed modern poets. He was named Italian Senator-for-Life in 1967, and in 1975 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature."
