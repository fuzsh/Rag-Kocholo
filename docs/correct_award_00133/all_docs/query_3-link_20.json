        "text": "Competition in Quattrocento Renaissance Donato (called Donatello) was a sculptor of Florence during the Quattrocento. He is known today especially for the bronze David and for the wooden Penitent Magdalene, both revered and timeless works of art, not to say works of genius. He made the Crucifix of wood you see on the left. Happy with the result, he called upon his friend, Filippo Brunelleschi, wishing for his opinion. Brunelleschi, you may recall, is especially known today for the dome he engineered atop Santa Maria del Fiore, a work of architecture whose secrets are still being studied. Brunelleschi examined Donatello's Crucifix and concluded that, it appeared to him, that Donato had placed a ploughman on the cross, and not a body perfect as expected to be that of Jesus Christ. Donatello, taken somewhat aback, replied that if it were as easy to make the figure as to judge it, his Christ would appear to Brunelleschi to be indeed Christ and not a ploughman. And, visibly shaken, he added as a final retort: \"Take wood and try to make one yourself!\" Which was exactly what Brunelleschi did. When, some time later, Brunelleschi had finished the Crucifix, he invited Donatello for supper, to which the latter heartily agreed. As they walked to Brunelleschi's house, they stopped at the Mercato Vecchio to buy some groceries. Brunelleschi made an excuse that he had something to do, so he gave the provisions to Donatello, and told him to continue to the house as he would be coming forthwith. Donatello carried the greens and the fish and the eggs in his folded apron, which he held up to his waist, as was customary, with his hands. Upon arriving at the house, then, and entering the hall, Donatello came upon Brunelleschi's Crucifix, which you see on the right. Studying it, he found it so perfectly finished that he became distraught and spread out his hands - to predictable consequences! He was still standing, dumbstruck, in front of the Crucifix when Brunelleschi arrived who, upon seeing the mess of broken eggs and groceries on the floor, asked what were they now to have to eat. Donatello, still awestruck by the Crucifix, answered that, for himself, he had had his share and that Brunelleschi could have the rest. He then turned, despondent, to leave, adding that it was Brunelleschi's work to make Christ, and his own to make ploughmen. #competition #renaissance #art #history #arthistory #florence"
