        "text": "Eugenio Montale produced only five volumes of poetry in his first 50 years as a writer. But when the Swedish Academy awarded the Italian poet and critic the 1975 Nobel Prize for Literature, they called him “one of the most important poets of the contemporary West,” Publishers Weekly reported. Born in Genoa, Italy, in 1896, Montale had a long and distinguished career as a translator and critic in addition to his poetic achievements.\n\nAlong with Giuseppe Ungaretti and Salvatore Quasimodo, Montale is often named as one of the founders of the poetic school known as hermeticism, an Italian variant of the French symbolist movement. Montale himself, however, did not consider himself part of the hermetic school, and even questioned its existence. In his essay “Let’s Talk about Hermeticism” (included in Galassi’s anthology), he wrote: “I have never purposely tried to be obscure and therefore do not feel very well qualified to talk about a supposed Italian hermeticism, assuming (as I very much doubt) that there is a group of writers in Italy who have a systematic non-communication as their objective.”\n\nRather, Montale explained in his widely-quoted essay, “Intentions (Imaginary Interview),” “I wanted my words to come closer than those of the other poets I'd read. Closer to what? I seemed to be living under a bell jar, and yet I felt I was close to something essential. A subtle veil, a thread, barely separated me from the definitive quid. Absolute expression would have meant breaking that veil, that thread: an explosion, the end of the illusion of the world as representation. But this remained an unreachable goal. And my wish to come close remained musical, instinctive, unprogrammatic. I wanted to wring the neck of the eloquence of our old aulic language, even at the risk of a counter-eloquence.”"
