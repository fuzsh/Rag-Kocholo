        "text": "November 30, 2017\n\nAlthough I have read Montale poems in the past, this collection, the largest I have read, still left me stunned at the concentrated power of his language, which was quite simply breathtaking. It's poetry to take over mind, body and soul. He conquers with enigmatic images, the sort of which could invade ones dreams, and if one of the main functions of a poem is to offer an alternative to dominant ways of thinking and feeling, and even on occasion to offer an alternative to its own alternatives, then Montale's 1920-1954 collection of poetry is of the not to be ignored kind. It may not fit in with one's world overview, but somehow is still very much accommodated.\n\nLike many creative people, Montale started on a different path in life, first training as a baritone before being drafted into the Italian army in 1917. 'Cuttlefish Bones' his first collection of poems, published in 1925 (just over two years after Mussolini came to power) was the turning point, making him one of the greatest Italian poets. He was a fan of the lush, lyrical incantations of Gabriele D'Annunzio (another Italian poet, 1863-1938) and Montale wanted to offer his own lyrics of negation, in the style of a stony, whispered countereloquence, a rhetoric freed of Italian poetry's orotundity. Flashes of salvation, often in the form of a beautiful but remote woman, appear and vanish, but the primary sensation is of stimulating frustration, an awareness of something always near yet endlessly out of reach. In some ways there is an other-worldliness similar to that of Pablo Neruda.\n\nIt doesn't surprise me Montale was also a keen traveller, as this is one of many themes explored, the poetry's genius comes out equally strongly in his intensely realized portraits of the itinerant inhabitants of modernity, this collection is most emphatic in his portraits of refugees and exiles, especially Jewish wanderers traversing the landscape, of course Montale was a poet under Fascism.\n\nOne of his most famous poems is about another migrant, this time an eel, as if for Montale, the earth itself were one vast and often tragic network in which all creatures are in circulation, endlessly migrating and returning, disappearing and reappearing. In a single, slithering sentence he describes the whiplike creature's desperate voyage from the cold Baltic to the ''Edens of generation'' in Italy. And as the poem contemplates the final stages of the eel's pilgrimage through half-expired streams, it explodes with fellow feeling, with the sense of survival as a form of poetry and of poetry as a form of survival.\n\nJust to pigeonhole Montale as a love poet doesn't paint the complete canvas, these were deeply bewildering and beautifully crafted poems, yes, so eerily cosmopolitan, so multilayered, so distilled rhetorically, that don't seem to belong to any specific moment, as individual works they whisk and whirl confronting the dilemmas of modern history, philosophy, faith and courage, told with a deft subtlety that truly captures the imagination. This really is transcendental reading, detaching oneself from the oblivious outside world.\n\nThis collection happened to be bilingual, which for me was a shame as my Italian is pretty basic. However, I still managed to read some of the shorter poems in Italian just for that authentic feeling. I wanted to include a poem, but how do you choose from such a vast array of them?, picking one at random seemed the best option. All poems range from being very good to extraordinary.\n\nEncounter -\n\nMy sadness, don't desert me\n\non this street\n\nlashed by the offshore wind's\n\nhot eddies till it dies; beloved\n\nsadness in the gust that fades: and wafted\n\ntoward it over the moorings\n\nwhere day exhales its last voices\n\na mist sails, a connorant's\n\nwing beats above.\n\nBeside us is the rivennouth,\n\nwaterless, but alive with rocks and lime;\n\nbut more a mouth of withered human acts,\n\nof wan lives setting over the horizon\n\nthat locks us in a circle:\n\nravaged faces, raw hands, files\n\nof horses, screaming wheels:\n\nnot lives: vegetation\n\nof the other sea that rides the waves.\n\nWe travel on a roadway of dried\n\nmud, no deviation,\n\nlike hooded figures in a cortege,\n\nunder the shattered vault that fell\n\nto mirror the windows,\n\nin a dense fog that shrouds our steps\n\nand makes the swaying human\n\nseaweed seem\n\nlike curtains of murmuring bamboo.\n\nIf you too leave me, sadness,\n\nmy one live omen in this haze,\n\na whirring spreads around me,\n\nlike clockworks when the hour's\n\nabout to strike;\n\nand I go lifeless, waiting listlessly,\n\nfor the one incapable of fear\n\non this shore surprised\n\nby the slow tide, who won't appear.\n\nMaybe I'll find a face again:\n\nin the glancing light a movement leads me\n\nto a sad bough craning from a jar\n\nby a tavern door.\n\nI reach for it, and feel\n\nanother life becoming mine, encumbered\n\nwith a form that was taken from me;\n\nand it's hair, not leaves, that winds\n\nround my fingers like rings.\n\nThen nothing more. Drowned one, you disappear\n\nthe way you came and I know nothing of you.\n\nYour life is still your own: already scattered\n\namid the days few glimmers. Pray for me now\n\nthat I may come down by another route\n\nthan a city street\n\nin the brown air, ahead of the press\n\nof the living; and may I feel you with me, may I\n\ncome without cowardice.\n\nMarch 23, 2016\n\nAbsent one, how I miss you on this shore\n\nthat conjures you and fades if you're away\n\nSeptember 27, 2009\n\nAfter devouring this collection (as an undergrad), I discovered a whole new appreciation for lemons.\n\nApril 5, 2022\n\nThe gust that lifted the bitter scent\n\nof the sea to the valley's twists and turns\n\nand struck you, ruffled your hair,\n\nbrief tangle on the pale sky;\n\nthe squall that glued your dress to you\n\nand shaped you swiftly in its image,\n\nnow you're gone it's returned to the rocks\n\nthe mountain shoulders over the abyss;\n\nand, now the drunken rage is spent,\n\nit's come back to the garden, the gentle breeze\n\nthat lulled you in your hammock in the trees,\n\non your flights without wings.\n\nAlas, time never spills its sand\n\nthe same way twice. And there's hope in this\n\nfor, if it happens, not nature alone\n\nbut our story, too, will burn in a flash.\n\nOutflow that doesn't quicken\n\nand now brings to life a group of dwellings\n\nexposed to the eye on the flank of a hill\n\nand festooned with pennants and flowers.\n\nThe world exists ... Amazement halts\n\nthe heart that surrenders to straying ghosts,\n\nherald of evening: and won't believe\n\nstarved men are celebrating.\n\nSo many amazing poems in this compilation of Eugenio Montale's work.\n\nNovember 5, 2016\n\nMontale has stated, “I always begin with the real, I’m capable of inventing anything.” His Collected Poems demonstrate his obsession to sacrifice himself in his language, resulting in his constant search for meaning in the elusiveness of life. His work follows in the line of the revered Italian tradition of Dante and Petrarch. He attempts to free himself from the world’s existential drama, which he confesses guilt for helping to create. His work can be seen as an exorcism to aid him in escape from this world, as he calls upon the sea, the sun, the garden, and of course his angelic phantom, a beloved woman who becomes his own personal religion. He looks to her as a revelation that shall rescue him and lead his soul to paradise, a place he is unable to see and which he knows may ultimately fail him. Montale’s voice sounds like a solitary, melancholic figure clinging desperately and devotedly to an illusion of this beloved woman. He places his faith and guidance in the verses he addresses to her in hopes that she shall save him. The ruined world has solace in her mission. He seeks to unburden his soul from something seemingly impossible to convey. His oeuvre can be read as a narrative leading one on a path where finding faith can also lead to doom. The musicality of Montale’s verse regularly evokes memories and remarkable images of the natural world. He is certainly a poet of unparalleled abilities.\n\nSeptember 9, 2008\n\nMontale is a marvelously lyrical writer, but somewhat too enigmatic for my taste. I gave up long ago trying to understand these poems, and instead just gave myself over to the mood and atmosphere of his work, which can be celebratory and melancholic, concrete in imagery yet evanescent in feeling. Among 20th c. Italian poets, I prefer Umberto Saba, but in certain moods, I find Montale complexly richer. I pull him off the shelf once or twice a year, and feel transported. Any more than that, I feel lost.\n\nSeptember 16, 2008\n\nJust lovely. Good poems; beautiful translation. A good go-back-to collection.\n\nSeptember 10, 2017\n\nEugenio Montale's poems are too obscure to be even enjoyable by more than a handful of people in the world, save those who haven't the faintest clue what the poems actually mean but think they sound pretty. The rhyme scheme is irregular, the meter is inconsistent, and the text is incoherent. If there is some complex, underlying message in the text, I couldn't grasp it. To be sure, Montale manages to convey a sense of tone and perhaps charges his writing with emotion, but the exact significance of the text is near to impossible to accurately fathom.\n\nI love reading poetry, but what I enjoy most is fluidity and force. A poem should vocalize its meaning strongly and fluently. It should be easy to follow, melodic and pleasant to read, and be capable of being understood within a single reading. With Montale's poetry you need to constantly stop, analyze the text, read it again, consider every potential meaning behind each word, view the line from a political perspective, maybe close the book and do some research, and then continue for another two or three lines before stopping again. After finishing the whole poem, you need to reread and reread it, and even then you probably wouldn't understand it.\n\nPerhaps Montale intended for his poems to be unfathomable, in order to avoid criticism from the Fascist Party. Maybe he just wrote down whatever came into his head and called it avant-garde (i.e. \"obtuse\").\n\nHere's an example of his poetry:\n\n\"The wind picks up, the dark is torn to shreds,\n\nthe shadow that you send out on the fragile\n\nbalustrade is curling. Too late, if\n\nyou want to be yourself! The mouse\n\ndrops from the palm, the lightening's on the fuse,\n\non the long, long lashes of your look\"\n\nWhat does the wind represent? How is darkness torn and why does it curl? What is the balustrade supposed to be? What is the mouse supposed to be? What is the lightening? Who is \"you\"? Why does he have long lashes? Why is all this random information in only two sentences? Don't expect an answer to these questions. You'll just need to guess. All of his poems are this way. Several of them don't even have titles.\n\nAugust 15, 2021\n\n有好用且篇幅适中的注解。sempre più addentro, sempre più nel cuore / del macigno [...] finché un giorno / una luce scoccata dai castagni / ne accende il guizzo in pozze d’acquamorta [“鳗鱼”] 《乌贼骨》是如此易懂，如此跃跃欲试地汲取着前人的汁液，而读到《风暴》最后的部分，内心（指我的）已变得像意大利老电影里的海滨虽然植物乱长鸟乱飞仍然一片荒芜。我在泥滩上挖一个水坑即使没有闪亮的鳗鱼从里面钻出来。\n\nJune 18, 2022\n\nOf all the “collected” poems I have read—Eugenio Montale’s collection is novelistic: sustained, peremptory, one and oneiric. It is really a one piece beaming of life, love, and melancholy. A true great Italian lyric, not an opera of fragments and entropy.\n\nFebruary 14, 2017\n\nThis is a great anthology of his work, and while his poems are quite good, what i liked best was reading the evolution of his images and thinking over time. This book samples from his collections from Cuttlefish Bones to The Storm and Other Things. Those who can read him in the native Italian will probably get a great deal more out of his use of language, timing, and meter - but the images and thinking is evocative even translated into English.\n\nOnly this is what we can tell you today,\n\nthat which we are not, that which we do not want.\n\n-Cuttlefish Bones\n\nJuly 5, 2013\n\n\"Ossi di seppia\", \"Le occasioni\", \"La bufera e altro\" these are great pieces, and I like the translation, but I am still of the idea that poetry should always be read in the original language first, and resort to the translation only if necessary.\n\n\"Non recidere forbice quel volto\" e' la mia preferita! Che poesia piena di simbolismo. La poesia di quel periodio e' per me' la piu' significativa e Monatle sa' come esprimere i sentimenti dell' anima con simbolismo che non solo da' una descrizione appurata emotiva, ma anche in una maniera che il lettore puo' vedersi come protagonista.\n\nLe sue poesie sono cariche di simbolismo cosi' ordinario che ognuno puo' immedesimarsi nelle descrizioni e sentirsi come se queste descrizioni appartenessero a se stesso. Per esempio, mentre leggevo \" non recidere forbice quel volto\" sono riuscita ad immaginare le forbici che tagliavano il volto di una persona amata e sentivo il suono delle forbici mentre le lame venivano aperte e poi chiuse velocemente per tagliare un'immagine immortalata all'interno di me.\n\nNovember 13, 2015\n\nA massive undertaking, the notes account for as much of the heft of this volume as the actual poetry. This is something you immerse yourself in. There is an anti-poetic component to Montale that places him, at times, in the company of other European poets like Pessoa and Machado. I'm convinced the Neruda must have been familiar with him as well. It seems to me his presence is in the mix out of which the Elemental Odes were composed. I've read this several times since picking it up and it's always a deep, rich experience. I also pull my hair out, the originals are included and it's clear there is a phonetic and rhythmic component that is completely absent from the translations. This is not a criticism of the translator, just an always present problem with the task of translating poetry.\n\nJanuary 18, 2016\n\nEugene Montale won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1975. His poems are not the easiest for me to understand (perhaps better read aloud in his native Italian tongue?). My favorite lines from \"Cuttlefish Bones:\" \"Don't ask us for the phrase that can open worlds, just a few gnarled syllables, dry like a branch. This, today, is all that we can tell you: what we are not, what we do not want.\"\n\nJanuary 5, 2011\n\nAstonishing translation by Jonathan Galassi of poetry by my favorite 20th cent Italian poet. I've re-read this volume so many times, but each traversal is equally pleasurable as the last, if not more.\n\nMay 21, 2014\n\nBeyond a faithful translation of this modern Poet's first and most important three books, this collection also includes very extensive in-depth notes and a very illuminating essay on reading Montale's early work. This is a book I will be returning to time and time again."
