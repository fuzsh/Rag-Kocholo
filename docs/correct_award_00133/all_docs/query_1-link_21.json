        "text": "*Montale, Eugenio\n\nhome\n\ntable of content\n\nunited architects – essays\n\ntable of content all sites\n\nMontale, Eugenio\n\nItalian, 1896–1981\n\nWhen he received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1975, Eugenio Montale saw his work as a poet rewarded. In the speech he gave in Stockholm—“È ancora possibile la poesia?” (“Is Poetry Still Possible?”)—he made a point of reminding his audience that he was also a librarian, translator, literary and musical critic, and even unempioyed after his publicly stated lack of belief in the fascist regime. Montale was first and foremost a free and independent man, even before being the most important Italian poet of the 20th century. The man and his work were both to be honored by the Republic of Italy when Montale was made a senator for life in 1967.\n\nOssi di sepia (1925; Cuttlefish Bones), Montale’s first poetry collection, already revealed his metaphysical despair. Against the descriptive background of his native Liguria, between seascapes and arid landscapes, Montale explored both the seriousness and the absurdity of the world. He expressed himself entirely in negativity, denial, passivity, and ultraconservatism, using a new poetic language that came close to prose but deliberately stopped short by playing with sounds derived largely from his musical youth. We immediately see the clean break he made when faced with the rhetoric of D’Annunzio or Carducci on the one hand, and the futurists’ experimentations of the period on the other. His contemporaries bracketed him with the negative poetry of Leopardi, or the esoteric tendencies of Ungaretti or Quasimodo. But as one collection followed another, the critics were to discover that Montale’s poetry went beyond conventions. He, in turn, influenced a number of Italian poets after him.\n\nAt the same time as writing poetry, Montale early on embarked on a career as a journalist. In 1920 he began working for L’Azione (The action). Two years later he founded the short-lived magazine Primo Tempo (First time). In 1925, in the columns of L’Esame (The examination), he published “Omaggio a Italo Svevo” (Homage to Italo Svevo), after making a passionate discovery of that author, whom he was to meet the following year. Over more than 40 years, through essays, articles, or lectures, Montale was to wage an unceasing battle as a critic to give the novelist from Trieste a place in Italian literature. These various writings were brought together in Lettere con gli scritti di Montale su Svevo (1966; Letters and writings by Montale on Svevo).\n\nIn 1929, after a spell with the publisher Bemporad, Montale was appointed director of the scientific and literary body Vieusseux, the famous Florentine cultural institute. He was dismissed from his post nine years later for refusing to join the fascist party. There then began a period of intense work for various magazines such as Solaria and Letteratura (Literature) that made clear their cultural opposition to the regime in power and advocated openness to international literature at a time when national self-sufficiency was recommended. In these and other magazines, Montale published short critical essays on poetry and prose (reprinted in Sulla poesia [1976; On poetry]).\n\nAt the end of the war, Montale began contributing to Il Corriere della Sera (The evening courier), writing for it for nearly 30 years. It was his column in the daily paper which made the poet known to the public. He was, of course, writing journalism in prose, but even so, the same autobiographical and stylistic background was visible here as in his poetry, though more clearly articulated, and occasionally softening tragedy and metaphysical agonizing with a degree of humor. Most of these pieces, critical or factual, were collected in La Farfalla di Dinard (1956, 1960; The Butterfly of Dinard) and Auto da fé (1966). Subtitled Cronache in due tempi (Chronicles in two times), this latter collection of pieces clearly demarcates the two stages of Montale’s cultural and militant activity. In the immediate postwar years, he was questioning the relationship between fascism and literature, the moral value of art and its need to be independent, and the loneliness of the artist. In a later period, he placed art within a technological and industrial society, denouncing the boredom of mass art, artistic utilitarianism, and fashionable, commercialized art. Without undue bitterness, and denouncing sterile nostalgia, Montale grew uneasy about the role of art and the artist in a constantly changing world. Even in an earlier short essay (“Stile e tradizione” [1925; Style and tradition]) reprinted in the collection, Montale, while defining his idea of a poetic art, is already questioning the links between literature and society.\n\nOther articles were collected in Nel nostro tempo (1972,; Poet in Our Time) and Trentadue variazioni (1973; 32, variations). Prime alla Scala (1981) brings together Montale’s writings about music. Fuori di casa (1969; Away from home), on the other hand, is a collection of various pieces written between 1946 and 1964, when he was abroad, mostly for Il Corriere della Sera. From these journeys in Europe, New York, and the Middle East, Montale brought back slices of life and ideas; the accounts of the real world sometimes provided material for poetry.\n\nNot only in his poetic writings, but in his articles and essays as well, “Montale’s poetic heart continued to beat beneath the lucid and ironic mask of ideological and cultural polemic, behind occasional dips into literary criticism” (Marco Forti, 1974).\n\nCHRISTINE MASUY\n\nBiography\n\nBorn 12 October 1896 in Genoa.
