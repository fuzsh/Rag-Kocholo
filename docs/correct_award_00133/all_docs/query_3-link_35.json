        "text": "SUMMER\n\nThe falcon's cross-shaped shadow's scarcely known\n\nto the young shrubs it grazes.\n\nAnd what does the cloud see? Multiple faces\n\nthat form in the brimming wellspring.\n\nMaybe you come back to me, dead girl,\n\nArethusa, at my feet,\n\nin the silver wriggle of the trout\n\nswimming against the current.\n\nHere's the sunburned shoulder, here's the gold\n\nnugget, upturned in the sun,\n\nthe crazy cabbage moth, the thin\n\nspider's thread across the boiling foam--\n\nsome things manage to make it through\n\nthe needle's eye, but most do not . . .\n\nToo many lives go into the making of just one.\n\n--Eugenio Montale\n\ntranslated by David Young\n\nTranslation copyright c 2004 by David Young.
