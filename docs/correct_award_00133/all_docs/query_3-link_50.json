        "text": "arida, rivolgendomi vedrò compirsi il miracolo:\n\nil nulla alle mie spalle, il vuoto dietro\n\ndi me, con un terrore di ubriaco.\n\nPoi come suno schermo, saccamperanno di gitto\n\nberi case colli per linganno consueto.\n\nMa sarà troppo tardi; ed io me nandrò zitto\n\ntra gli uomini che non si voltano, col moi segreto.\n\nMaybe one morning, walking in dry, glassy air,\n\nIll turn and see the miracle occur:\n\nnothing at my back, the void\n\nbehind me, with a drunkards terror.\n\nThen, as if on a screen, trees houses hills\n\nwill suddenly collect for the usual illusion.\n\nBut it will be too late, and Ill walk on silent\n\namong the men who dont look back, with my secret.\n\nIt is seldom that one stands in utter astonishment before a poem. At least at first reading.\n\n(Perhaps not so for Emily Dickinson, who in a now-famous meeting at her home in Amherst, Massachusetts with the literary critic Thomas Wentworth Higginson told him, in an a remarkable comment, \"If I read a book and it makes my whole body so cold no fire can ever warm me, I know that is poetry. If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry. These are the only ways I know it. Is there any other way?\")\n\nBut I want to share with you one of those  for me  rare, signal moments when I have read with total astonishment a poem I had not read previously.\n\nI should acknowledge a modest tendency to fix on certain poets whom I think I should understand, who I think should be speaking to me, but who despite repeated rereading remain relatively opaque. Something in each one of this small group of great poets whose opacity beleaguers me nonetheless calls out to me: I stick with them, reading them year after year, until one day I suddenly find an entrance, a suddenly opened doorway, and can walk into their poems and finally feel at home. This happened over ten or fifteen years with Charles Baudelaire and Rainer Maria Rilke. Despite lots of work, it has never quite happened with the Italian poet Eugenio Montale.\n\nI was first attracted to Montale by the fact that he had written a poem about a small town in Tuscany, Bagni di Lucca, where my wife, son and I lived for most of a year when I was on a sabbatical from the University of Vermont. The poem, eight lines if I recall rightly, was engraved in marble on the town hall. Since Montale and I had both visited that particular town, I thought I would give him a try, especially since he was reputed to be Italys greatest modern poet, the winner of a Nobel Prize for Literature. The translation of his book The Storm and Other Things by William Arrowsmith was wondrous to me: not because I could easily enter the poems, but because reading Arrowsmiths copious notes  more like commentary  felt to me like taking a seminar with a remarkably observant, extremely accomplished, wonderfully sharing, reader of poetry. I enjoyed reading about the poems so much that in the process I got fairly close to some of them.\n\nSo when Jonathan Galassi, president of the publishing firm Farrar, Straus and Giroux published a translation of the collected poems of Montale  a labor of love, since he did the translations simultaneously with his work as an editor and CEO  I bought the volume. Not as good as Arrowsmith, I thought, because I missed those notes I had appreciated so much, but a whole lot longer.\n\nBrowsing along over several evenings I encountered a short poem of eight lines, called Maybe one morning. I got the poem, almost immediately, and was blown away. Totally. By what it says, and most powerfully by the image at the heart of it.\n\nI have since learned that the poem I discovered  an early poem, it seemed to me that I singlehandedly had unearthed it from among the hundreds he had written, that I alone had valued it above some of his more celebrated later poems  was discovered by others too. Notably the Italian novelist Italo Calvino, who wrote a brilliant essay about it, ten pages on the phenomenology of perception as it emerges from this small poem.\n\nI have been rambling, not without purpose, in advance of addressing the poem.\n\nMaybe one morning, walking in dry, glassy air,\n\nIll turn and see the miracle occur:\n\nnothing at my back, the void\n\nbehind me, with a drunkards terror.\n\nThen, as if on a screen, trees houses hills\n\nwill suddenly collect for the usual illusion.\n\nBut it will be too late, and Ill walk on silent\n\namong the men who dont look back, with my secret.\n\nThats all there is, two short stanzas.\n\nYou will see yourself, I think, what an amazing event the poem recounts. Perhaps one morning the speaker of the poem will go out, walking. He will turn around quickly, so quickly that he sees something behind him that he has never been quick enough to see before. He will see what is actually there behind his back. The experience will be miraculous: he will see the void, which has always been there but never seen. He will see that just behind what seems to exist is  nothing.\n\nWe can, of course, only see in front of us. We joke about having eyes at the back of our heads, but it is physiologically impossible. (We can use a mirror, but mirrors do not allow us to see reality, only a reflection of something real.) We see in front of us, and if we turn our heads, even if we turn our necks 130 degrees, or pivot rapidly, what we see is still what is in front of our eyes.\n\nSo what occurs in lines two and three is both miraculous in its happening, and miraculous in what appears.Nothing.The void. He turns and sees: nothing at my back, the void/ behind me.\n\nThe speakers response is irrational terror. I rather suppose that the terror is a drunkards terror because it is, like delirium tremens, all-encompassing and inescapable.\n\nItalo Calvino makes a good deal of the (dry) air of glass in the first line. He suggests that it may be this is a moment of remarkable transparency, which is why the miracle can occur. It may be that the air of glass is like a bell jar, momentarily allowing the poet to be cut off from everyday experience, which will rush back soon enough when he leaps the chasm into stanza two.\n\nCalvino, who had memorized the poem when he was young, admits to carrying it around in his head with little mistakes in what he remembered so his reading was, even though he did not intend this, an active reading. So is mine, in a different way. I am so blown away by the poet turning around and seeing the nothing that lies behind him, and behind every man and woman, that I forget this is not a recounting  actual or symbolic  of his experience. The poem begins: Maybe. What follows that word is, therefore, something that could happen, it is a possible future sequence, not  as I keep reading it in my willful misreading  the recounting of an experience of the poet. If the poem began, Maybe one morning I will wake up a hippopotamus, I would know it is not an experience, but something which might be possible, or might not be. (Though, after using that outlandish example I remembered that Franz Kafka wrote a story, The Metamorphosis which begins exactly like my maybe hippopotamus example  though without the maybe:\n\nAs Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from a troubled dream he found himself transformed in his bed into a monstrous insect. He was lying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his dome-like brown belly divided into corrugated segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, flimmered helplessly before his eyes. [trans. Vladimir Nabokov])\n\nBack to Montale. In the poems second stanza, the world as we know it reasserts itself, although as if on a screen. No one, of course, takes the movies as the real world: powerful and engaging as they appear to us, we accept as well that they are only a fiction made up of colored lights reflected on a screen. So what returns is now seen as the usual illusion. The world collects itself, and he recollects the reality he has always known, that there is something there in front of us, and that it is composed of objects: trees houses hills. The object-world, the actuality of the world of things, is there once again for the poet. The nothing has disappeared because now what he sees is full, and not void.\n\nYet the solidity of trees and hills is too late: in the moment of terror when he saw nothing behind him, quite literally nothing, he has recognized that the void is what is real. This is his secret knowledge, a knowledge not shared by men who dont look back, and it marks him out as different, terror-filled, without illusions.\n\nBetween his recognition of belatedness  he can no longer feel rooted in the world, since he recognizes that behind all is nothing-ness, and that what he sees is seen as if on a screen,  and his awareness that this recognition is his secret knowledge, he has another recognition. (How much knowledge flows from that quick pivot, when he turns only to find nothing at my back!) The speaker realizes that other men  all?some?  dont look back. Men are unaware of what he has seen in this moment of reverse epiphany. He has seen the void: they have not. His knowledge is secret not only because it is his own, but because he cannot impart it. I believe he is silent in good measure because he cant tell anyone what he has seen. They would just not understand. Ill walk on silent/among men who dont look back, with my secret. Read differently, the final two lines reveal the tissue of convention, the usual illusion that ties men to one another and weaves for them the social world we inhabit.\n\nAs my friend Senator Bernie Sanders, would say, though he uses the phrase in a different context, Huck, this is deep stuff.\n\n(Before moving away from the poem, let me state a truth that every poet knows: poems are made out of words, and specifically the sounds of words. From this perspective, to me the loveliest thing about this poem is the wonderful rush of nouns, without commas, as the object world comes rushing back to the speaker: alberi case colli or in English, trees houses hills.)\n\nAs I wandered into this poem, I will ramble out of it, by acknowledging that its central recognition is not new to thought. It is not unlike a founding principle of Buddhism, that all is emptiness and void. Nor is it new to poetry.\n\nThe epiphany in Maybe one morning appears in one of the high points of Shakespeares plays, when Macbeth in learns that Lady Macbeth is dead (in critical hifalutin language he confronts the reality of death):\n\nSEYTON\n\nThe queen, my lord, is dead.\n\nMACBETH\n\nShe should have died hereafter;\n\nThere would have been a time for such a word.\n\nTo-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,\n\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day\n\nTo the last syllable of recorded time,\n\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\n\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\n\nLife's but a walking shadow, a poor player\n\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage\n\nAnd then is heard no more: it is a tale\n\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\n\nSignifying nothing.\n\nIn Shakespeares passage too we encounter the notion at meaning and reality are illusion  a shadow world, a play on the stage. Here too is a failure of language, here too nothing comes to the fore.\n\nMontales poem was written sometime between 1921 and 1925.\n\nWallace Stevens, also embarking on would be a great poetic career, wrote a poem in 1921 that bears surprisingly close comparison with Montales. If one reads The Snow Man as a poem about a literal snowman (several spheres of snow, inanimate and as ephemeral as the whimsy of climate allows it to be) it is a different poem than Montales, a splendid meditation on a cold wintry scene. But if one reads the poem more symbolically (and the final lines always push me and most other readers in that direction) it can be seen as the double of Maybe one morning, a poem which recognizes not only the nothing that is not there but also the unyielding nothing that is.\n\nTHE SNOW MAN\n\nOne must have a mind of winter\n\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\n\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow;\n\nAnd have been cold a long time\n\nTo behold the junipers shagged with ice,\n\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\n\nOf the January sun; and not to think\n\nOf any misery in the sound of the wind,\n\nIn the sound of a few leaves,\n\nWhich is the sound of the land\n\nFull of the same wind\n\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\n\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\n\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\n\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\n\n[A hint: read Stevens poem out loud. In the almost two hundred years since Keats, no one wrote a richer and more resonant English than Stevens.]\n\nEnough meandering.Time to wrap up.\n\nWhat Montales poem has going for it, beyond Shakespeare, beyond Stevens, is just how near the nothingness is. It is just behind our backs, only we do not turn around to see it, and that makes us one with the countless other men who dont look back. But maybe one morning walking . we too will turn around and see the void in which our existences take place."
