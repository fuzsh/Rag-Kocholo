        "text": "Eugenio Montale\n\nPoetry\n\nThe Wall\n\nTo lie in shadow on the lawn\n\nBy a crumbling wall, pale and withdrawn\n\nAnd spy in the weeds the gliding snake\n\nAnd hear the rustle blackbirds make –\n\nTo watch in the cracked earth and the grass\n\nBattalions of red ants at drill,\n\nThat break and form ranks, pass and repass\n\nIn busy marches on some tiny hill –\n\nTo catch, each time the leaves blow free,\n\nThe faint and pulsing motion of the sea,\n\nWhile ceaseless, tremulous and shrill,\n\nThe cicadas chatter on the bald hill –\n\nRising, to wander in bewilderment\n\nWith the sun’s dazzle, and the sorry thought\n\nHow all our life, and all its labors spent,\n\nAre like a man upon a journey sent\n\nAlong a wall that’s sheer and steep and\n\nendless, dressed\n\nWith bits of broken bottles on its crest.\n\n“The Wall” By Eugenio Montale, translated by Maurice English, from SELECTED POEMS, copyright ©1965 by New Directions Publishing Corp.\n\nReprinted by permission of New Directions Publishing Corp.\n\nExcerpt selected by the Nobel Library of the Swedish Academy."
