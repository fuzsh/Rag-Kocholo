Life and Career

Eugenio Montale was born on 12 October 1896, in Genoa, Italy. He grew up in a middle-class family and developed an early interest in literature and poetry. His early life was marked by a sense of isolation and melancholy, which would later become recurring themes in his poetry.

Montale studied at the University of Genoa, where he initially pursued a degree in opera singing. However, he later shifted his focus to classical literature and philosophy, which had a profound influence on his poetry.

Montale’s career as a poet began to take shape in the 1920s when he published his first collection of poems, “Cuttlefish Bones” (1925). This collection marked the start of his distinctive poetic style, characterized by its intellectual depth and lyrical expression.

Montale’s poetry delved into a wide range of themes, including existentialism, the passage of time, the search for meaning in a chaotic world, and the relationship between language and reality. His work often featured a sense of melancholy and a profound exploration of the human condition.

During World War II, Montale worked as an editor for the literary magazine “L’Italia Letteraria.” His poetry during this period reflected the tumultuous political and social climate in Italy, and he expressed his anti-fascist sentiments through his writing.

Montale continued to publish poetry throughout his life, producing several notable collections, including “Le occasioni” (1939) and “La bufera e altro” (1956). His later work continued to receive critical acclaim for its complexity and artistic sensitivity.

Eugenio Montale passed away on 12 September 1981, in Milan, Italy.
