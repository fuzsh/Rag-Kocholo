        "text": "As some of my friends (not necessarily readers) will know, I’m currently travelling Japan for a month or so with a friend. As part of this, I thought it’d be a good idea to read some Japanese literature, as a side course to my visit; and who better to start with than Yasunari Kawabata, Nobel Laureate of 1968 and big name in 20th century Japanese lit. I’ve just finished his 1937 novel Snow Country, the love story of a Tokyo academic and a rural geisha, and next I’ll be reading his (quite different) novel The Master of Go. Consider this to be the first half of a mini-series on Kawabata, then.\n\nWhen Kawabata won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1968, the Nobel Committee named Snow Country as one of the main texts that contributed to his win. He was a complicated figure: obsessed with the traditional culture of Japan and the lifestyles of its aristocracy, Kawabata’s great skill was for the elegiac – trading in nostalgia and memory and lavishing praise on the past with a doomed reverie. Snow Country has all this, if on a relatively small scale, focusing not on the zeitgeist and the changing moods of a nation, but zeroing in on the strained relationship between two individuals.\n\nIvan Morris, a translator and scholar of Japanese culture and classical civilizations, called Snow Country Kawabata’s masterpiece. Like the haiku, Morris said, Snow Country works through suggestion and implication alone – never saying or showing things outright, but leaving it to the reader to decide how they feel about the characters or the story.\n\nLike most members of the idle rich, Shimamura feels listless and alienated with city life. Shimamura has taken himself off to a hot-spring resort in the Snow Country, where the mountain air and rugged landscape herald a more meaningful existence – at least in theory. Lonely in his isolated ryokan – which is a traditional Japanese inn with an attached hot spring bath house – Shimamura calls for the company of a geisha, Komoko. Komoko is a geisha in all but name, having trained as one but never receiving a formal license to become a courtesan. Young and energetic while Shimamura is tired and (presumably) older, Komako’s gauche innocence and her passion to become a geisha seem to represent something missing from Shimamura’s own life. The pair become deeply infatuated with each other, drawn together another even though they are both committed to their separate lifestyles.\n\nThe book depicts four meetings between Shimamura and Komoko, each corresponding to a different season: spring, winter, summer, autumn. There is some pretty unsubtle symbolism going on here, and when Kawabata uses a simile he doesn’t hide it. His allegories range from being cliched – Shimamura loves the Western ballet but has never been to see a performance; I wonder if he’s detached? – to smacking you in the face:\n\nHe wondered whether the flow of the mountains was not perhaps symbolic of the passage of time.\n\nI imagine that it works better in Japanese, or that it makes more sense to use metaphorical language in this way. Even so it’s quite noticeable in an English translation.\n\nWhat is most striking about Snow Country are its descriptive passages, the moments where Shimamura is looking (usually through a window) at the sky or the mountains, thinking about the effect of the weather on the landscape or the rhythm of life in the resort town. These snapshots of nature, the weather and the village are sprinkled throughout Snow Country, and it’s a joy to hold them in your head and try to picture them for yourself. I think this is what Morris was getting at, talking about haiku’s power to imply and illustrate rather than be direct. Here are a few of my favourite examples from Snow Country:\n\nSlender autumn grasses grew along the top of an earthen wall. The pale-yellow plumes were at their most graceful, and below each plume narrow leaves spread out in a delicate flower.\n\nTotally unnecessary to advance the plot, but they give Snow Country a distinctive character. Sometimes they are longer:\n\nThe windows were still screened from the summer. A moth so still that it might have been glued there clung to one of the screens. Its feelers stood out like delicate wool, the colour of cedar bark, and its wings, the length of a woman’s finger, were a pale, almost diaphanous green. The ranges of the mountains beyond were already autumn-red in the evening sun. That one spot of pale green struck him oddly as the colour of death. The fore and after wings overlapped to make a deeper green, and the wings fluttered like thin pieces of paper in the wind.\n\nOr very short:\n\nSuddenly the rain was louder.\n\nGiven that it’s only 120 pages long these passages take up a fair part of the book. Even though they seem like self-contained units within the narrative, you can’t help but try to read between the lines and pin meaning on them. I’m obviously no expert in Japanese literature or language, so take my perspective with a pinch of salt, but Kawabata’s practice of using landscape imagery to punctuate more narrative-driven scenes recalls shasei, the trope of haiku to always include a reference to the changing season or the surrounding weather. The effect is oddly arresting: you stop and think.\n\nDespite this, I had some reservations about the book. Namely, I don’t think that Kawabata can write women very well at all. Some of the details of Shimamura and Komoko’s relationship haven’t aged well into the present day, and at times I struggled to understand why Komoko was attracted to him, much less how she could be so forgiving when he treated her poorly. I don’t mean that I didn’t approve of their relationship – I mean that I didn’t understand it, and I don’t think Kawabata does a good enough job of illustrating the mentalities and the desires of his characters. One thing that Snow Country is not is psychological. Komoko’s behaviour sometimes doesn’t make any sense, recalling the old stereotype that women change their minds, cannot think straight and are irrational compared to men. A heavy sigh.\n\nBeyond his scholarly interest in Western ballet we know almost nothing about Shimamura’s life in Tokyo; although he sometimes mentions his wife and children back home this apparently doesn’t stop him from pursuing a rural geisha. Still, this is a fairly old book, and although Kawabata comes short in many ways pre-war Japan was a world apart from the 21st century Western world. Shimamura is a character obsessed with the unreal: he loves ballet but has never seen a performance, and he is attracted to the ideal of Komoko and the snow country more than the realities of the things he desires – he’s in love with the idea of love. I suppose that I’ll be in a stronger position to make a full assessment of Kawabata’s skill as a writer when I’ve finished his next book, The Master of Go. For its flaws, Snow Country is impressive in that it leaves you with a strong impression of visiting a country inn in the depth of winter. Kawabata paints a beautiful picture here, one that is quintessentially Japanese. Read Snow Country for the set pieces, for its enigmatic geisha and mystical landscapes. It’s worth the day or two it’ll take you.\n\nPhoto Credits: Wikipedia, Goodreads, Amazon. Please contact me if you would like any of these removed."
