We feel that this is the joy of the nation, the joy of our literary circles as a whole, and the joy of Mr. Kawabata. Mishima and I would like to talk to you while reminiscing about various things and expressing our feelings… Are you tired from last night?\n\nKawabata: Well, I didn’t sleep much at home, so… but, well, I’m fine."
