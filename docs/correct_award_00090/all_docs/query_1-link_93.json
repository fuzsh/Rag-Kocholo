        "text": "Shimamura, a dilettante, an aesthetician, a bit of an absence at the heart of a story, in which he himself is the protagonist, who doesn’t act much, and from whose point of view we get everything, arrives by train in the ‘Snow Country’ of central Japan in the early twentieth century, and resumes a relationship, of sorts, with a young geisha called Komako, who, naïve and transparent, loves him, but then there’s also the silent presence of another beautiful young woman, Yoko, who has a mesmerising effect on our narrator, and emanates a kind of meaning that has no meaning at all. So, Shimamura wonders, as ‘he felt a current pass through him’ – what’s all this about?\n\nThe story is set up, kind of, thus: ‘Somewhere in his heart Shimamura saw a question, as clearly as if it were standing there before him: was there something, what would happen, between the woman his hand remembered, and the woman in whose eye that mountain light had glowed?’ But really, there isn’t much of a story, as much as a beautiful series of half incidents strung together by the author. Yes, it’s otherworldly, somehow of no time and no place. Yes, a kind of profound sadness lingers. And though the snowy mountain setting really captures the reader’s imagination, we are expected to fall into step with the lugubrious, the plodding, the hollow, the shambling, the wondering, the morose, the anesthetised protagonist, as he half does nothing, half walks down the road, and half mulls over, half thinks nothing of, what happens around him, up here in the mountains, where he tries to eke out a meaningful episode in his otherwise far away existence, and doesn’t quite manage it. And the two women? A geisha and a woman he doesn’t know, both of whom have more substance than him, but not much more, are left to flicker in the peripheries. And the finale, the dénouement, but more an attempt to tie together, and give what has gone before some semblance or ‘feeling’ of meaning: it all feels a bit random. A kind of a non-story that Japanese lit keeps on wanting to tell.\n\nKawabata is an interesting chap, from Wikipedia:\n\n“Kawabata was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature on 16 October 1968, the first Japanese person to receive such a distinction. In awarding the prize “for his narrative mastery, which with great sensibility expresses the essence of the Japanese mind”, the Nobel Committee cited three of his novels, Snow Country, Thousand Cranes, and The Old Capital.\n\nKawabata’s Nobel Lecture was titled “Japan, The Beautiful and Myself”. Zen Buddhism was a key focal point of the speech; much was devoted to practitioners and the general practices of Zen Buddhism and how it differed from other types of Buddhism. He presented a severe picture of Zen Buddhism, where disciples can enter salvation only through their efforts, where they are isolated for several hours at a time, and how from this isolation there can come beauty. He noted that Zen practices focus on simplicity and it is this simplicity that proves to be the beauty. “The heart of the ink painting is in space, abbreviation, what is left undrawn.” From painting he moved on to talk about ikebana and bonsai as art forms that emphasize the elegance and beauty that arises from the simplicity. “The Japanese garden, too, of course symbolizes the vastness of nature.”\n\nIn addition to the numerous mentions of Zen and nature, one topic that was briefly mentioned in Kawabata’s lecture was that of suicide. Kawabata reminisced of other famous Japanese authors who committed suicide, in particular Ryūnosuke Akutagawa. He contradicted the custom of suicide as being a form of enlightenment, mentioning the priest Ikkyū, who also thought of suicide twice. He quoted Ikkyū, “Among those who give thoughts to things, is there one who does not think of suicide?” There was much speculation about this quote being a clue to Kawabata’s suicide in 1972, a year and a half after Mishima had committed suicide.\n\nKawabata apparently committed suicide in 1972 by gassing himself, but a number of close associates and friends, including his widow, consider his death to have been accidental. One thesis, as advanced by Donald Richie, was that he mistakenly unplugged the gas tap while preparing a bath. Many theories have been advanced as to his potential reasons for killing himself, among them poor health (the discovery that he had Parkinson’s disease), a possible illicit love affair, or the shock caused by the suicide of his friend Yukio Mishima in 1970. Unlike Mishima, Kawabata left no note, and since (again unlike Mishima) he had not discussed significantly in his writings the topic of taking his own life, his motives remain unclear. However, his Japanese biographer, Takeo Okuno, has related how he had nightmares about Mishima for two or three hundred nights in a row, and was incessantly haunted by the specter of Mishima. In a persistently depressed state of mind, he would tell friends during his last years that sometimes, when on a journey, he hoped his plane would crash.”"
