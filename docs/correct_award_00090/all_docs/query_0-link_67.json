This journal was a reaction to the entrenched old school of Japanese literature, specifically the Japanese movement descended from Naturalism, while it also stood in opposition to the \"workers'\" or proletarian literature movement of the Socialist/Communist schools. It was an \"art for art's sake\" movement, influenced by European Cubism, Expressionism, Dada, and other modernist styles.\n\nKawabata made his debut as a writer with the short story, \"Izu dancer,\" published in 1927. After several distinguished works, the novel Snow Country in 1937 secured Kawabata’s position as one of the leading authors in Japan. In 1949, the publication of the serials A Thousand Cranes and The Sound of the Mountain began. Kawabata considered The Master of Go (1951) to be his finest work. His later novels include The Lake (1955), The Sleeping Beauty (1960) and The Old Capital (1962), among others. A posthumous collection of unique microfictions, Palm-of-the-Hand Stories, was published in English in 1988.\n\nYasunari Kawabata died in 1972 of an apparent suicide (by gassing), two years after the suicide (by seppuku) of his friend Yukio Mishima.\n\n• 100% combed and ring-spun cotton (Heather colors contain polyester)\n\n• Fabric weight: 4.2 oz/yd² (142 g/m²)\n\n• Pre-shrunk fabric\n\n• Side-seamed construction\n\n• Shoulder-to-shoulder taping\n\n• Blank product sourced from Guatemala, Nicaragua, Mexico, Honduras, or the US\n\nSize guide"
