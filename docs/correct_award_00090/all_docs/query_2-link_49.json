        "text": "The motive force behind our endeavor at Clioâ€™s is fostering conversation about books and ideas. Our community programming continues with the monthly \"Award Winners\" book club. This month the club will read Snow Country by Nobel Laureate Yasunari Kawabata.\n\nSnow Country is the taut, affecting story of story of a man's trip to a far-away onsen and the woman he meets there. Intensely intimate yet sensitive to Japan's place in the wider world, the Nobel Committee specifically named this book as a major reason for awarding him the prize."
