        "text": "It was already nighttime in Zushi when sirens disrupted this quiet town, south of Tokyo, on April 16, 1972. Police and TV cameras crowded around a small seaside residence. On the red carpeting of apartment 417 was an empty whisky bottle and a gas hose. The lifeless body of 73-year-old Yasunari Kawabata had just been discovered there. The 1968 Nobel Prize winner for Literature liked to isolate himself to write in this small office facing the sea. The neighbors saw nothing. The police did not comment. But Japan lost a treasure and the public wondered why. During the night, a crowd gathered in the hills of the nearby city of Kamakura. This is where Mr. Kawabata lived and where several of his novels were set, including The Sound of the Mountain, the story of an aging businessman full of regrets, haunted by death.\n\n\"Kawabata departed alone, as he had lived,\" his friend Jean Pérol told Le Monde. Mr. Pérol, a poet who was working as a teacher in Tokyo, had visited him four months before his death. \"At the time, he was the 'master' of Japanese literature, an intellectual authority to whom the Nobel Prize had conferred an incredible aura, and a large audience,\" said Mr. Pérol. In 1972, Mr. Kawabata was considered a national author, studied in textbooks and popularized through cinema. He was still rarely translated into French, but French poet Louis Aragon and French writer André Malraux valued him. Mr. Pérol said that during this last encounter, \"he was sad, affected by old age. But he refused to take stock. He wanted to write again. He also told me that he had no admiration for suicide, with a soft, gloomy, merciless look that I have never forgotten.\"\n\nMore on this topic Subscribers only Why Japan continues to inspire French chefs\n\nSomething fishy about the crime scene\n\nIt was ruled a suicide by gas inhalation, while intoxicated. The police report provoked both shock and a sense of déjà vu in a country where suicide was common in the world of literature, including writers Ryūnosuke Akutagawa in 1927 and Osamu Dawai in 1948. Japan had also just barely recovered from author Yukio Mishima's suicide in 1970; he disemboweled himself after a failed coup d'état. But the news caused division among Mr. Kawabata's entourage. Some were fatalistic: The author was old and depressed. In March, appendicitis had left him in a fragile state. It was enough to believe that he simply identified with his characters, those mature, melancholic men crippled by life, such as the Go (a strategic board game) enthusiast who was playing against the clock (The Master of Go, 1954), or the old calligrapher, a recluse in a hospital (Dandelions, 1972)."
