Meyer never used his first given name, and was known throughout his life simply as Lothar Meyer.\n\nTimeline | Story | Article\n\nAlfred Nobel\n\nMonday Oct 21, 1833 to Thursday Dec 10, 1896\n\nAlfred Bernhard Nobel (21 October 1833 – 10 December 1896) was a Swedish businessman, chemist, engineer, inventor, and philanthropist. Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. The synthetic element nobelium was named after him. Known for inventing dynamite, Nobel also owned Bofors, which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments.\n\nTimeline | Story | Article\n\nMax Planck\n\nFriday Apr 23, 1858 to Saturday Oct 4, 1947\n\nKarl Ernst Ludwig Marx Planck was a German theoretical physicist whose discovery of energy quanta won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918.\n\nTimeline | Story | Article\n\nWillem Einthoven\n\nMonday May 21, 1860 to Thursday Sep 29, 1927\n\nWillem Einthoven (21 May 1860 – 29 September 1927) was a Dutch physician and physiologist. He invented the first practical electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) in 1895 and received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1924 for it (\"for the discovery of the mechanism of the electrocardiogram\").\n\nTimeline | Story | Article\n\nMarie Curie\n\nThursday Nov 7, 1867 to Wednesday Jul 4, 1934\n\nMarie Skłodowska Curie was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win the Nobel prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields. She was part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris, and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon in Paris.\n\nTimeline | Story | Article\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nFriday Mar 14, 1879 to Monday Apr 18, 1955\n\nAlbert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.\n\nTimeline | Story | Article\n\nGustav Stresemann\n\nTuesday May 10, 1887 to Thursday Oct 3, 1929\n\nGustav Ernst Stresemann (10 May 1878 – 3 October 1929) was a German statesman who served as Chancellor in 1923 (for a brief period of 102 days) and Foreign Minister 1923–1929, during the Weimar Republic.

These loans are given to entrepreneurs too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans. In 2006, Yunus and the Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \"for their efforts through microcredit to create economic and social development from below\". The Norwegian Nobel Committee said that \"lasting peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty\" and that \"across cultures and civilizations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the poorest of the poor can work to bring about their own development\". Yunus has received several other national and international honours. He received the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.\n\nTimeline | Story | Article"
