        "text": "After decades have gone by, I have finally read The Master of Go by Yasunari Kawabata (1899 – 1972). It was first published in 1951 and then in English in 1972. I think I have owned my copy since 1997 or so. In fact I think I have been wanting to read it forever. However, this is one of a few select books in the galaxy that I think a reader really has to wait with infinite, inexhaustible patience to read “at the right time.” When is the “right time”? Only the specific reader knows, but if its not the right time, the novel will be frustrating and will go undigested. Hey, this was decades in my case….\n\nNow that I have read the novel – and at the right time – I am very glad that I read it and waited to read it this very month, this very year. It is very much unlike all of Kawabata’s other novels that I have read. The difference is in the subject matter, for sure, but also Kawabata’s style here seems less dramatic or on show. In a sense, I feel this is the closest we readers get to a look at Kawabata’s natural, instinctual style of writing. In contrast, in Snow Country (1956) or Thousand Cranes (1958), Kawabata is nearly flamboyant with his wordsmithing as compared to this novel. In those novels Kawabata seems to write effortlessly and with flourishes and a subtle, but well-earned smugness. Not so here. In The Master of Go the writing is spare and unadorned. Of course the structure of the novel is entirely different as well.\n\nThe structure is somewhat a fictionalized account of a 1938 game of Go that Kawabata himself reported on. Kawabata reported on the game for two newspapers and it is remarkable to say such a thing in 2022, wherein I doubt any newspapers really matter any more and certainly would not be running segments on Go games. The novel is written in first person, as they say, from the perspective of the newspaper reporter named Uragami. How close is Uragami to Kawabata? The novel is not one that contains the gross-level of character “personality/development” so common in fiction today. So, it really does not matter how similar Uragami is to the real Kawabata – as remembered by Kawabata years later. After all, and this where it gets a bit sticky, it is difficult to locate this novel because it definitely does not read like Kawabata’s memoir, but it does read like Uragami’s. However, it hardly reads like some introspective rehashing. It feels “real time” as if we are in 1938 and awaiting the next move in the game.\n\nMaybe this structure prevented Kawabata from being as artistic, let us say, with the work as he was in his other novels. To say this gives a different impression, though. It seems to imply that those other works are artistic and beautiful and this work is some piece of newspaper article. No, the distinction between the works is not as sharp as that.\n\nChapters 12 and 28 are the most important, in my mind, chapters in the book. They are the ones wherein Kawabata does not simply report on the game, but actually touches upon the relevance of Go to Japanese culture, of the supposed clash between two shifting eras of culture, of people’s varying responses to Go and similar activities. These are not lengthy chapters full of discourse and meandering, though. Just brief interludes that open the door for Kawabata to consider all of these things while we wait for the next Go session.\n\nHon’inbō Shūsai (1874 – 1940) is the master in this novel. He was, of course, a real historical Go master as well. In some sense, however his character is described in this novel versus the more historical reports, it is something that Kawabata renders almost meaningless. The Shusai of the novel is the one Kawabata has remolded for humanity. His opponent was Minoru Kitani (1909 – 1975). It seems that the character of the novel, Otake is similar in some respects to Minoru Kitani, but seems a bit more agitated and unsettled. Otake’s unsettledness is contrasted with the relative busy-calmness of the Master. Otake’s agitation also disturbs the reader. It can be a little difficult to remain neutral in this matchup because Otake seems to be such a difficult opponent – just in his bearing and nervous energy.\n\nI think that many readers come to this novel with expectations and are annoyed when those expectations are not met. It is not entirely their fault, the publisher and media lead readers to believe this is a novel about a game and we are going to get into the nitty-gritty details of things. I do not think any knowledge of Go is necessary to truly enjoy this novel and I do not think I had any difficulty at all with the technical Go aspects. Kawabata did not write an instruction manual or even a game commentary. The profundity and wisdom in this novel is not heavy-handed and there is not any moralizing about the context of the game. Kawabata ends the novel as it begins, dry and matter-of-fact.\n\nThe entire novel is Kawabata saying that one time, this significant game happened. It played out over months and months and he reported on it like a combat reporter. Some of it was dull, some he did not comprehend. At some points, though, it was too tense and he would leave the scene in order to get his thoughts together. It was significant to whom it was significant. It happened. It mattered. It might still matter, but that is not Kawabata’s role or argument. I do think it was a key moment in Kawabata’s life – perhaps influencing him in a myriad of ways.\n\nMinoru Kitani had a cerebral hemorrhage in 1954 and he died in 1975. The Master of Go was published in 1951 and I have no idea if he read Kawabata’s work or not. I would assume so and I would be curious as to his authentic – not second-hand – thoughts on the matter.\n\nReaders need to read this at the right time, whenever that is for them. I do not think it is true that because it is a novel about a game that it therefore would interest those interested in board games. This is not that sort of book. This book also demands a patient and steady reader. This book is just over 180 pages and could be read in an afternoon, but I do not think that one should. I think that literally goes against the months-long timeline of the novel. Gobbling this one would ruin it. Similarly, if a reader has any sort of shortened attention span, they probably, really, will struggle with this. Not just reading it, but understanding it, I suppose. I think it is probably among Kawabata’s best, but that does not mean we readers like it the best.\n\n3 stars\n\nThe Sound of the Mountain by Yasunari Kawabata (1899 – 1972) was first published in Japan as a book in 1954. I am not an expert in anything, but I try my best to keep on learning and thinking! So, when I say that I think that this novel is one of Kawabata’s middle years works, take it with a grain of salt. I have read two of Kawabata’s previous novels and I enjoyed them. This one felt, to me, like it was a turning point or a change for Kawabata. I have no idea if that is true or not.\n\nThe novel takes place mostly in Kamakura, which is a city southwest of Tokyo. Kamakura is a very old city with tons of significant history, but in this novel it sounds mainly like a seaside rural town. Everyday a couple characters take the train to Tokyo. I looked at Google Maps and in theory you could drive or take a train to Tokyo (city center) in about an hour. This works with the novel, it just seems farther away when I look at the map. The author himself moved from Tokyo to Kamakura in 1934.\n\nI once read this passage by Professor Van C. Gessel that stuck with me as a sort of rudimentary aid in understanding Japanese modern literature and I think it applies to The Sound of the Mountain. Gessel wrote:\n\nSuch a luxury is not afforded the reader of Japanese literature. I realize this flies in the face of contemporary Western literary critical thinking, which insists that a text be surgically removed like a tumor from the author’s being for discrete dissection. Works which cannot survive the operation are declared D.O.A. Any mention of the author’s life brings cries that Oedipus’ mother is being blamed for his sins. Nonetheless, I stand by my contention that Japanese fiction is written with the presumption that it will not be entirely severed from the life of the writer, and that readers will know something of the relationship between creator and creation. This is all part and parcel of the fundamentally autobiographical approach to literature that has been an integral part of the Japanese tradition since its inception. – pg. 8, Preface, Three Modern Novelists, Kodansha International (1993)\n\nDefinitely, I think I have seen this approach in what little Japanese modern fiction I have already read and I think it is probably true, to an extent, in this novel. The location in Kamakura is an obvious example, but at this point the author was fifty-five years old and probably some of the main character’s thoughts and feelings are autobiographical. The main character is Shingo Ogata who is sixty-two years old in the novel.\n\nThe story is mainly told from Shingo’s perspective, in a sense. It focuses on his daily routines and his dreams and his thoughts about his family and the goings on in the neighborhood. Kawabata’s spare haiku-like prose is always praised for its style and beauty. In this novel, however, I am not sure if it is Kawabata’s prose or just the mannerism of Shingo. Shingo is feeling old and his having difficulty with his memory. He seems to have frequent waves of nostalgia and sentimentality. He, in his age, is remembering and longing for times past – and he even questions the accuracy of those memories. He purposely allows his mind to conflate those past times and people and events with current events. His thoughts are somber, confused, frustrated, and sometimes morose. Shingo’s very thoughts are unsettled and peppered with mundane facts or tautologies. Very much like the spare matter-of-fact prose with which Kawabata writes, generally.\n\nWe all live, now, in a furious time. Everything, literally everything, is a manic, wild flurry of information and action. If, in 1954, Kawabata’s prose was subtle and haiku-like, reading it now has made those times seem even more distant and even rather impossible. Shingo often just looks at things or has time to just….. think vague thoughts. He thinks about a fallen chestnut, a plum blossom, a locust, etc. These singular items blend into the more pertinent life relationships he has with his family and co-workers. And throughout my reading of this novel, I was frequently envious of how characters would “go and look at things.” Nowadays nobody goes and sees the trees for the express purpose of seeing trees blossom. Literally, going to a place to see some natural and mundane thing is unheard of today. I cannot even imagine anyone saying, “oh, after supper, let’s all walk out to the wherever to watch the sun set from there” or “let’s walk past the empty field down the block because the weeds are flowering.” Do not get me wrong, please – I truly, deeply, enjoy this. I am the one who wants to go look at “a tree” or “a nothing much at all.” I just wish I had more time to do this. Frankly, in this novel, I think the days of the characters must be 30-40 hours long. How do they have time for newspapers, train travel, meals, tea time all the time, arguments, and then nature-gazing?!\n\nI have written this review, thus far, as if I really “got into” and enjoyed and understood this novel. Unfortunately, that is not quite true. This is probably a very good book for some readers. But this is absolutely not a book “for me.” It did not work for me, it was nearly incomprehensible to me, and I cannot call it a good book from my perspective. I mention all of this to let everyone know that I know that my opinions are not dogma. I fully expect that there are readers who very much enjoyed this book and can easily explain/defend their admiration.\n\nBut for me this was a struggle. It even came with a very chilling electric-shock at the end (pg. 270), which was very relevant (again) *to me.*\n\nThings I am horrible at (and “horrible” is a kind and light way of phrasing it): family. People. People in my family. Peopleing. Familying. This book, however, is 100% about family and people and relationships. Frankly, I disliked almost all of the characters in this novel. The only character that I might have liked a bit is the old woman, Shingo’s wife, Yasuko. The thing is, I cannot even explain why I liked her best, perhaps it is because she is the most wry and grounded of all of the characters. She often struck me as smarter and sharper than any of the characters think. She deserves her own novel.\n\nI really… I really just feel like I needed the floor plan to the house – to Shingo’s house, okay? Because, to me, the story feels claustrophobic and tedious and cramped. It feels like everyone is constantly in each other’s faces and places. And I need space, I want to breathe; back the heck up, characters!\n\nI guess Kawabata is a really good storyteller. Because even in this translated edition, in this storyline that I utterly cannot comprehend or engage with, I was still immersed enough to actually now be complaining about the closeness of the family home and the struggles of time and the tedious human weather.\n\nThere is only one segment that I would give high rating to. It is this art appreciation moment in the chapter “The Scar” in which Kawabata has Shingo thinking about an ink wash by artist Watanabe Kazan (1793 – 1841). Shingo sees this artwork at a friend’s house and is still thinking about the ink painting and the corresponding verse. The five or six paragraphs in this segment are utterly beautiful, insightful, and skillfully composed. They contain layers of meaning and show a brilliance that is absent, I think, in the rest of the novel.\n\nShingo knew of Kazan only that he had been impoverished and that he had committed suicide, but he could see that this “Crow in the Stormy Dawn” gave expression to Kazan’s feelings at a certain point in his life.\n\nNo doubt the friend had put the painting up to match the season.\n\nShingo ventured an opinion: “A very strong-minded bird. Not at all likeable.”\n\n“Oh? I used to look at it during the war. Damned crow, I used to think. Damned crow it is. But it has a quietness about it. If Kazan had to kill himself for no better reasons than he had, then you and I probably ought to kill ourselves time after time. It’s a question of the age you live in.”\n\n“We waited for the dawn, too.” – pg. 209\n\nThis, and associated paragraphs, thrill me. I love how the Japanese of old had a connection between the décor of their house, let us say, and the natural seasons. I love how, in this example, the friend has a painting of a crow – and does not seem to actually like it – the painting is displayed maybe because it is poignant, not because it is preferred. How unlike Western aesthetic, then and now! I also like how Kawabata was able to utilize this painting in his narrative of Shingo’s ruminations on death and age.\n\nHowever, other than these brief moments, the novel is a loss for me. I think I am supposed to have opinions and feelings and ideas about the characters and their situations, but I do not. I do not even know what Kawabata is getting it – though I would guess maybe its about how Shingo is unable to manage the roles of the people in his family. Or something. I mostly got the impression that the characters are pitiful and helpless. The novel is nearly incomprehensible to me. A book about nothing and its annoying humans. It made me sad and frustrated.\n\n2 stars\n\nThousand Cranes by Yasunari Kawabata (1899 – 1972) was published in 1952 and in English in 1958. It is the second Yasunari Kawabata novel that I have read. I disliked his main characters, however, in this novel they do seem to possess a measure of realism. I felt that the characters in Snow Country were not realistic. While this is a speedy read, one can finish it in a day, it is not really an easy story to penetrate. There is a great deal of native culture within that can keep non-Japanese readers at bay. Further, this entire novel is very much focused on human interrelationships and their responses to each other. For some readers, this could be challenging.\n\nWikipedia’s entry, in very forthright style, explains precisely what this book is about. This means this, that means that. And while some of that is probably true, I think there are deeper and more complex interpretations possible.\n\nThe storyline, the characters, and the other general dimensions of the novel were not anything I was particularly drawn to. It is quite a dramatic work and does not immediately appeal to any of my major interests. As I mentioned above, this work is very heavily focused on human relationships. The defect is in me, clearly, because I am usually disinterested and bored and even confused by novels like this. Autistic. Russian. I have a hard time with some aspects of stuff in this genre. All of this being said, though, I will admit wholeheartedly and very profusely that in this novel, Kawabata’s skills are on showcase. In a sense, I feel this is almost a brag novel – Kawabata knows he is that good of a writer and he is showing off. He is an excellent novelist and even if this particular storyline does not appeal to everyone – the skill with which it is written is undeniable.\n\nDo not suppose, however, that this novel is arrogant or that it is over-the-top with writerly flourishes. Perhaps in its minimalist oh-so-Tanizaki/Japanese manner, it is precisely what it needs to be: no more and no less; and Kawabata deserves all the praise he gets for it. He proves himself an acutely aware, highly sensitive, perfectly edited, writer. He is a master-writer.\n\nLayered upon the story are tea ceremony items and elements of Japanese aesthetics, specifically pottery. This would be best understood by someone with familiarization with such topics. To some readers, the frivolous and fastidious obsession with which tea bowl to use, which vase, what tokonoma flower, may seem massively tedious. I was able to assimilate my personal cultural experiences fairly easily and completely empathize with the discussions of the tea items etc. To some people, such concerns seem “petty” or “decorative” as opposed to practical. The tea ceremony is such a THING, though, that I hardly know what to say about it. From its origins, to all of its iterations throughout history, and from the praises of it, to those who scorn it… whatever one thinks of it, it is not something to merely hand wave at. Yet, I struggle to discuss it. Regardless, if someone were to ask me about the tea ceremony, I do think I would recommend that they read this book. It sort of provides a situation for the whole process without directly confronting it.\n\nLike the back of book says: “a luminous story of desire, regret, and the almost sensual nostalgia that binds the living to the dead.” Again, this is going to be felt more by a reader who can assimilate certain cultural/religious aspects. This blurb accurately describes the novel. But I liked all the smaller points, symbolism of water, of mould, of the thousand cranes. And more than anything, the very subtle presentation of old Japan crashing with modern Japan.\n\nThe symbolism in this work is significant and excellently written. And while I dislike the main character, Kikuji Mitani, even I could not help but be caught up in some of the sensitivities Mitani faces and is caught up in. The dispositions and inheritances (both in objects and relationships) that befall him from his deceased father are mighty and certainly not pristine “black and white” dichotomies.\n\nThis is a very good novel. I think I took it for granted as I was reading it and only afterwards was I able to process how good a work it is. I think it is a written by a master writer, but the storyline itself does not interest me at all. Three stars is a very good rating for a plot that I was uninterested in……. Recommended for all fans of Japanese literature, students of the tea ceremony, ikebana scholars, and readers of quality literature.\n\n3 stars\n\nSnow Country by Yasunari Kawabata (1899 – 1972) was published in its finalized form in 1948. I read the Vintage International edition translated by Edward G. Seidensticker. This is the first Kawabata novel that I have read, though I own several. Kawabata won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1968, which made mention of Snow Country and two other of his works. His Nobel Lecture was entitled Japan, The Beautiful and Myself and I do want to take a look at that. There is an annual prize in Japan awarded to the year’s most accomplished work of short fiction. The Kawabata Yasunari Prize for literature was established in 1973 by the Kawabata Yasunari Memorial Association to honor Japan’s first Nobel Prize–winning novelist. The winner receives a certificate, a commemorative gift, and a cash award of one million yen.\n\nSo much has been said/written about this novel that I doubt I can add much value to the overall volume of commentary. I did not love the novel, but please, do not assume I am a lazy or stupid reader. I really wanted the novel, with it’s poetic and spare writing, to grab my heart by it’s beating valves and drag me around the mountains of snow country.\n\nDisappointingly, that did not occur. Broadly, because I deeply disliked both main characters. The writing is quite good and scenic; it envelopes the reader. But the sloth and decadence of Shimamura and the annoying voice of Komako killed the wonderment of the writing. I don’t forgive them for that.\n\nHowever, I cannot say that I disliked this novel.\n\nKawabata’s Nobel Prize was awarded “for his narrative mastery, which with great sensibility expresses the essence of the Japanese mind.” This sort of statement sometimes makes me grumpy. The thing is the definite description there in the phrase; the “the” that causes issue. At once we are to recognize The Other and embrace diversity – therefore keeping the independence of The Other, but yet we are also expected to support and enjoy the fullness of the universal human experience. So, what is this “Japanese mind”? Even if we assume that in 1968 they did not choose their words so nicely, is there a “Japanese mind”? A mind so in tune and vital that it is quite simply separate and distinct from all other human minds? Or is “Japanese mind” merely a euphemism for “experience produced within Japanese culture”?\n\nThis little messy babbling of mine is important because I think this specific novel by this specific author is affected by these questions/answers. Snow Country is allegedly his most famous and well-enjoyed novels – by Japanese readers and non-Japanese readers alike. Is it because the non-Japanese readers love the insight gained through glimpses into the “exotic” Japanese world via this prose? Or is it because there is something universal in the writing that appeals and is readily accessible by all readers?\n\nI felt that the writing was very good for most of the novel. I mean, there are places where I was less impressed. But throughout, the actual writing – and it has been likened to haiku and poetry many times – was very good. Its a spare prose with a pseudo-poetic feel. Again, some of the greatness may be reduced because of translation.\n\nAbove all of that, I could synthesize with the feelings in the story. It is hard to choose the correct words here, so let me keep trying. I do not mean simply that I sympathized/empathized with the characters, but rather that I feel that I have also experienced those feelings. Feelings, though, is also the incorrect word. I mean, something deeper – something like the relationship to the milieu. Or, more like the ennui of the whole scenario. Or, perhaps better, the Russian term тоска́/toska. Observe what happened here – I was unable to find the English word and had to dip into different languages.\n\nIs this a love story? No, I do not think so. Allegedly, Komako falls foolishly in love with Shimamura. I must have missed that part. Please do not tell me it is “between the lines” or that the reader has to supply this. I missed that part because it was not there and it could not happen. Shimamura is thoroughly unlikeable and I doubt the young geisha could see anything of value in him. His heavy ennui drips down every page of the novel and he is truly a shameful character. Not because of his morality, per se, but because he is so wretchedly slothlike. Much has been commented about Shimamura’s dilettanism, yet I don’t think this is his defining characteristic. I see him as sluggish and oozing his upper-class ennui.\n\nWhen Shimamura goes for a massage, the woman says: (pg. 59)\n\n“. . . you must not have to work. Feel how nice and soft you are.”\n\n“No stiff muscles on me.” Shimamura replies.\n\nI find Shimamura repugnant. His conversation is also lazy and slothful. He repeats phrases and seems constantly hazy on the conversation. Komako is just as frustrating. Her conversation is immature and ridiculous. Much of this is because most of the time she is drunk (she is a geisha and must attend “parties”) or because she is acting as her age dictates. Still, I find her to be annoying, at best.\n\nThis novel, for me, was about distance. The remote hot-spring inn is far from Shimamura’s home in Tokyo. The mountains and snow make the setting isolated and Kawabata writes them so that you feel the silence of heavy, hard-packing snow. Snow deadens sound like nothing else; I have experienced this at length. There is distance, too, between Shimamura and his family. There is distance between Komako and Yukio. There is distance between Komako’s hopes and dreams and her reality. Of course there is the distance between Shimamura and Komako. Finally, as if this were not enough distance, there is the distance between the characters and their selves. The Self. Themselves. This seems repetitive when it is written out, but in Kawabata’s novel it is omnipresent and sturdy, not nearly as redundant as my listing it makes it feel.\n\nFor example, often Shimamura is depicted looking out at the mountains and trees. He vaguely ponders the autumn leaves or the skiers. He has lazy daydreams about the grasses and snows. In fact, several times he wanders listlessly, but yet cannot seem to really ever become “one with nature.” There is always the distance as he stands in the inn, by the screens looking out at the scenery. Basically, this is a metaphor for all of Shimamura’s distances.\n\nOverall, if you can stand a novel filled with ennui and distance, this is a perfect representation of that. I mentioned above that this is not a bad novel, I did not dislike it. But I was not convinced all of the time. What I was drawn in by was that heavy-headed fuzziness that sloth and bad schedules and long winters come with. And that is not a feeling I have ever relished.\n\n3 stars"
