        "text": "Y\n\nasunari Kawabata (see below), who became the first Japanese winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, was first nominated as a final candidate for the prize in 1966, according to documents about the selection, which were disclosed by the Swedish Academy on Monday.\n\nThe Japanese novelist was among the final candidates in that year. After that, evaluations of Kawabata’s works gradually rose.\n\nIn 1968, two years after his first nomination, Kawabata won the literature prize.\n\n(Read also: Duchess of Cambridge honoured by Royal Photographic Society)\n\nAccording to the documents, which The Yomiuri Shimbun requested the academy disclose, 72 people were initially selected as candidates in 1966.\n\nAmong them, Kawabata and Junzaburo Nishiwaki, a poet, were picked as Japanese candidates.\n\nLater, the candidates were narrowed down to six, which included Kawabata. Then the selectors of the prize held detailed discussions on five of the candidates.\n\nAt that time, the selectors admitted there was a limit in evaluating Kawabata’s works because only his works translated into other languages could be read by the selectors.\n\nBut they highly evaluated Kawabata, saying his works describe Japanese lifestyles and express an ethical and aesthetic cultural awareness through the characters that appear in them.\n\n(Read also: Hakone to add features for tourism revival)\n\nAlso, Sei Ito, a Japanese novelist, sent the academy a letter of opinion giving detailed information about Kawabata’s career and works of literature.\n\nConcerning the Nobel Prize in Literature, Junichiro Tanizaki was among the final candidates in 1960 and 1964, and Yukio Mishima was among the final candidates in 1963.\n\nBut Tanizaki died in 1965. In the selection for that year, the academy judged that after Tanizaki’s death, Kawabata was the writer likeliest to become a Japanese candidate. Thus, the academy judged it necessary to further examine Kawabata.\n\nSelection documents for the Nobel Prize in Literature are disclosed after 50 years.\n\nYasunari Kawabata\n\nBorn in 1899, Kawabata graduated from the then Tokyo Imperial University. When he was young, he attracted attention as a novelist in the Shinkankakuha (new impressions) literary group, and gradually deepened his knowledge about the beauty particular to Japan. His outstanding works include “Izu no Odoriko” (Izu dancer), “Yukiguni” (Snow Country) and “Koto” (The Old Capital). He killed himself by inhaling gas in 1972."
