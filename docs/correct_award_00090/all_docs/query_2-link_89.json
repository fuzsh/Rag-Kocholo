        "text": "When Yasunari Kawabata (川端 康成) was honoured with the Nobel Prize of literature, he said: literature will defeat religion. This statement made a good debate among Japanese readers and philosophers back in the day that they wondered what Kawabata was considering about.\n\nIt is not the first time where through books or novels religion is criticised. Poets or writers, when they wrote their plays, sometimes suffered the consequences or even were banned by church.\n\nThis is why somehow literature is also seen as a good knowledge tool against sacred texts and so.\n\nWhy do you think Kawabata said literature can defeat religion? Is it related to promote a better educational system or the pursue of a free state of knowledge through books?\n\nNote: The Nobel Prize in Literature 1968 was awarded to Yasunari Kawabata \"for his narrative mastery, which with great sensibility expresses the essence of the Japanese mind.\" The Nobel Prize in Literature 1968 — javi2541997\n\nThere are of course masters of Zen, and the disciple is brought toward enlightenment by exchanging questions and answers with his master, and he studies the scriptures.\n\nThe disciple must, however, always be lord of his own thoughts, and must attain enlightenment through his own efforts. And the emphasis is less upon reason and argument than upon intuition, immediate feeling. Enlightenment comes not from teaching but through the eye awakened inwardly. Truth is in “the discarding of words”, it lies “outside words”. And so we have the extreme of “silence like thunder”, in the Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra.\n\n[...]\n\nSaigyo frequently came and talked of poetry. His own attitude towards poetry, he said, was far from the ordinary. Cherry blossoms, the cuckoo, the moon, snow: confronted with all the manifold forms of nature, his eyes and his ears were filled with emptiness.\n\nAnd were not all the words that came forth true words?\n\nWhen he sang of the blossoms the blossoms were not on his mind, when he sang of the moon he did not think of the moon.\n\nAs the occasion presented itself, as the urge arose, he wrote poetry. The red rainbow across the sky was as the sky taking on color. The white sunlight was as the sky growing bright. Yet the empty sky, by its nature, was not something to become bright. It was not something to take on color. With a spirit like the empty sky he gives color to all the manifold scenes but not a trace remained.\n\nIn such poetry was the Buddha, the manifestation of the ultimate truth.”\n\nHere we have the emptiness, the nothingness, of the Orient.\n\nMy own works have been described as works of emptiness, but it is not to be taken for the nihilism of the West. The spiritual foundation would seem to be quite different. Dogen entitled his poem about the seasons, “Innate Reality”, and even as he sang of the beauty of the seasons he was deeply immersed in Zen.\n\n— Kawabata Nobel Lecture"
