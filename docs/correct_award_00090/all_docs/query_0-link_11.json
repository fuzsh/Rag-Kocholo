        "text": "TOKYO -- In the autumn of 1968, the Nobel Prize in literature was awarded to Japanese writer Yasunari Kawabata. This came as a total surprise to Donald Keene, who had close ties with Kawabata. Keene reveals what took place behind the scenes in one of his autobiographies, as shown below.\n\n----------\n\nThe award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Kawabata came as a great surprise, not because I thought he was unworthy, but because I was convinced Mishima would receive it. I had heard that after reading the translation of The Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Dag Hammarskjold had expressed his admiration to the Swedish Academy, and a recommendation from this source was not to be taken lightly. I also was told by a leading Swedish publisher after Mishima failed to obtain the Formentor Prize that he would receive an even superior prize. It had not occurred to me that another Japanese might be honored.\n\nIt did not take long, however, for me to rejoice that the Nobel Prize had gone to Kawabata. He certainly deserved this recognition. But I still wondered what had induced the Swedish Academy to award the prize to Kawabata rather than Mishima.\n\nIn the following year, 1969, I was invited to dinner in Copenhagen at a friend's house. One of the other guests was a man I had met in Tokyo at the time of the PEN Club Congress in 1957. On the basis of the few weeks he spent in Japan he had apparently established a reputation as an expert in Japanese literature and his views were sought by the Nobel Prize Committee. Recalling this, he announced to the gathering, \"I won the prize for Kawabata!\" This man, of extremely conservative political views, had decided that because Mishima was relatively young, he must be a radical. He therefore spoke strongly against Mishima and in favor of Kawabata, in the end convincing the committee.\n\nDid this really happen? It seemed so absurd that Mishima should have been deprived of the prize because he was taken for a left-wing radical that I couldn't resist telling Mishima. He did not laugh.\n\n[Chronicles of My Life: An American in the Heart of Japan]\n\n----------\n\nHammarskjold was a Swedish statesman who served as the secretary-general of the United Nations from 1953 to 1961. A few years prior to the good news, Keene had been asked by Sweden's Nobel Committee to recommend candidates for the literature prize, and thus was partly involved in the selection process. While he never disclosed who he recommended, Yukio Mishima must have surely been on his list. Around this time, Keene had a special friendship with Mishima, and must have had great expectations of Mishima winning the prize, as well as disappointment after the announcement. Nevertheless, it seems that he was thrilled that Kawabata -- the leading literary figure of the generation older than Mishima, following the death of Junichiro Tanizaki -- earned global recognition. In an essay contribution to the New York Times dated Dec. 8, 1968, Keene reports the reaction in Japan as if he were a correspondent in Tokyo.\n\n----------\n\nIn Japan, of course, the news was greeted with something approaching national delirium. Ever since the Japanese emerged from national seclusion in the 1860's they have sought recognition for their achievements in catching up with the West. They have had the satisfaction of Nobel Prizes in the sciences, gold medals in the Olympics, and places high on the lists of nations with the most washing machines, color television sets and automobiles, but Japanese literature had never won an international award. Indeed, their modern writings were virtually unknown abroad even 15 years ago, and it seems to have come as a shock to people who expected Beckett or Grass to win this year for a Japanese to have been honored with the prize.\n\nThe Japanese naturally feel great pride over this tribute, but even amidst their many expressions of joy a note of uncertainty has been sounded: Can Western readers possibly understand Kawabata? Of all contemporary Japanese writers Kawabata is most closely concerned with the objects and landscapes of traditional Japan, and he employs an allusive, indirect style stemming from the old literature, rather than the straightforward expression other Japanese novelists have borrowed from the West. Certainly Kawabata's best novels are not considered easy reading even by the Japanese, and it puzzles them that the Committee in Stockholm should have chosen so intensely Japanese a writer.\n\n[Speaking of Books: Yasunari Kawabata]\n\n----------\n\nIt seems that Kawabata was quite fond of Keene. As was the case with Tanizaki, Kawabata treated Keene as if they were father and son. Keene shared the following episode in his autobiography.\n\n----------\n\nI felt close to him from the first time we met. I never experienced any trouble conversing with him, though I had heard the story that his protracted silences had reduced one woman reporter to tears. He was generous with his time even when he had more pressing things to do.\n\nI remember particularly an occasion when I visited Kawabata in Karuizawa. I had been told that as the result of the sleeping pills he took in order to overcome his chronic insomnia, he did not rise until very late. So I went at two in the afternoon, judging this was late enough. Kawabata was about to have breakfast. He invited me to join him, but I had already eaten lunch. As we talked, I noticed a man pacing back and forth in the garden. I wondered whether he was a bodyguard. Finally, unable to suppress my curiosity, I asked Kawabata who the man was, and he answered with a smile that the man had been sent by a newspaper to pick up that day's installment of the serial Kawabata was writing. Even the presence of the impatient man in the garden did not induce Kawabata to cut short our conversation.\n\n[Chronicles of My Life: An American in the Heart of Japan]\n\n----------\n\nThe literary giant Kawabata was a troublemaker from the point of view of newspaper companies, but was terribly kind toward Keene. The kindness may have stemmed from his gratitude toward Keene's cooperation on the 1957 PEN International Congress of writers, which Kawabata chaired, as well as his hopes for other various future endeavors. Keene concluded his contribution to the New York Times with his personal views.\n\n----------\n\nBut it is fitting that Kawabata has been the first Japanese honored, not only because his works are of great intrinsic merit, but because giving him the prize signifies that the Japanese tradition of the novel, the oldest in the world, has now entered the world stream of writing. Two novelists of my acquaintance, an American and an Englishman, have told me that Kawabata has already influenced them. At a time when some critics believe the novel to have reached an impasse, the possibilities of the tradition represented by Kawabata may be worth exploring.\n\nJapanese writers in the 19th century, confronted by the powerful assaults of Western influence, borrowed in every field. At first they experienced great difficulty in understanding the methods of Western literature, but eventually they were able to create a new and distinctive art that has received its recognition in the prize this year.\n\nPerhaps it is not inappropriate even to consider the novels of Kawabata as the return gift Japan has offered for its long indebtedness to the West.\n\n[Speaking of Books: Yasunari Kawabata]\n\n----------\n\nKawabata's Nobel Prize win was soon to have a large impact on Mishima. Keene was also a close witness to the events that unfolded.\n\n* * *\n\nThis series navigates the past century by following the life of the late scholar Donald Keene, who contributed to the elevation of Japanese culture and literature in the world. News from The Mainichi that made headlines in Keene's time is introduced alongside Keene's personal history. The series began in 2022, the 100th anniversary of Keene's birth -- also the centennial of The Mainichi.\n\n(This is Part 43 of a series. The next \"Donald Keene's Japan\" story will be published on Nov. 7.)\n\n(Japanese original by Tadahiko Mori, The Mainichi Staff Writer and Donald Keene Memorial Foundation director)\n\nThe original text of Donald Keene's autobiographies is used with permission from the Donald Keene Memorial Foundation.
