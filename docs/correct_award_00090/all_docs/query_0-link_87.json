        "text": "The Old Capital is of one of the three works for which Yasunari Kawabata won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Set in Kyoto — the old capital of Japan for a thousand years — this lyric novel traces the life of Chieko, the beloved adopted daughter of a kimono designer and his wife. Believing that she had been kidnapped by the couple as a baby, Chieko learns one day that she was instead a foundling, left abandoned on a doorstep. Happy with her adopted parents, however, her security and contentment remain undisturbed until an answered prayer at the famous Yasaka Shrine dramatically alters the course of her life.\n\n'Kawabata’s novels are among the most affecting and original works of our time.' — Ivan Morris"
