        "text": "So far 12 Japanese people have won Nobel Prizes. The first was Hideki Yukawa, who won the prize for physics in 1949. At the time he was a professor at Columbia University in New York City. In 1965, Shin'ichiro Tomonaga, a professor at the Science University of Tokyo, also won the prize for physics, as did Reona Ezaki in 1973 (he was then doing research at the Watson Laboratories of IBM) and Masatoshi Koshiba, professor emeritus at University of Tokyo, in 2002. Professor Susumu Tonegawa of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) won the prize for physiology and medicine in 1987. The chemistry prize, meanwhile, was won in 1981 by Professor Ken'ichi Fukui of Kyoto University and in three successive years by Japanese researchers from 2000 - first by Hideki Shirakawa, professor emeritus at Tukuba University, in 2000; then by Professor Ryoji Noyori of Nagoya University in 2001; and by Koichi Tanaka, a researcher with Shimadzu Corp., in 2002. In fact, 2002 marked the first time that Nobel Prizes have been awarded to two Japanese - Koshiba and Tanaka - in the same year, a feat that was celebrated widely across the country.\n\nEisaku Sato, who was prime minister of Japan for almost eight years from 1964 to 1972, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974 for his contribution to Japan's diplomacy of peace and rejection of nuclear weapons.\n\nIn the field of literature, Japan has produced two Nobel laureates. The first was Yasunari Kawabata, author of Snow Country and The Izu Dancer, who won the prize in 1968. The second was Kenzaburo Oe, whose novels include The Silent Cry and A Personal Matter; he received the award in 1994."
