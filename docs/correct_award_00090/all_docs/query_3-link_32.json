He was born in a wealthy family on June 11, 1899 in Osaka, a big industrial town (Yasunari). Since his parents died from illness at his age of three, he was raised up by his grandfather and lived an enclosed childhood life. The loneliness of childhood caused his depressive personality after he became an adult. After he went to school, his grandfather, grandmother and sister died successively in the same year. The death of his relatives had a great influence on his whole life (Nobelprize).

However, while Kikuji enjoys the excitement of love, he also bears the guilty that does things he should not do. Through the going of the novel, more and more women involve in this relationship, which makes the love more complex. Kawabata indicates the collision between love and moral in this novel: People need love, but at the same time they cannot live without moral and rules to limit their behaviors. He introduces the love of guilty in this novel. On the other hand, Yasunari Kawabata also introduces the idea of Japanese: they viewed honor as the most important thing in their life. They may finish their lives just because they lose honor. (thousand)."
