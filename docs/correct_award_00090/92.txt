Yasunari Kawabata (1899 – 1972) was a Japanese novelist and short story writer whose spare, lyrical, subtly shaded prose works won him the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1968, the first Japanese author to receive the award.

In 1924, Kawabata and other young writers started a new literary journal Bungei Jidai (The Artistic Age). This journal was a reaction to the entrenched old school of Japanese literature, specifically the Japanese movement descended from Naturalism, while it also stood in opposition to the "workers'" or proletarian literature movement of the Socialist/Communist schools. It was an "art for art's sake" movement, influenced by European Cubism, Expressionism, Dada, and other modernist styles.

Kawabata made his debut as a writer with the short story, "Izu dancer," published in 1927. After several distinguished works, the novel Snow Country in 1937 secured Kawabata’s position as one of the leading authors in Japan. In 1949, the publication of the serials A Thousand Cranes and The Sound of the Mountain began. Kawabata considered The Master of Go (1951) to be his finest work. His later novels include The Lake (1955), The Sleeping Beauty (1960) and The Old Capital (1962), among others. A posthumous collection of unique microfictions, Palm-of-the-Hand Stories, was published in English in 1988.

Yasunari Kawabata died in 1972 of an apparent suicide (by gassing), two years after the suicide (by seppuku) of his friend Yukio Mishima.
