American Football are now the proud co-owners of the house at 704 West High Street in Urbana, Illinois, according to a statement from Polyvinyl Records. The home, known as “The American Football House” due its appearance on the band’s debut album cover, is also co-owned by Polyvinyl, photographer Atiba Jefferson, Chicago’s Open House Contemporary, and photographer and videographer Chris Strong, who designed the first American Football album cover.

According to Polyvinyl, the house was built in 1893 and put up for sale last year. “[W]e made a pact with our friends to protect the house from developers and likely demolition,” the label wrote. “A few days ago, we held true to this promise and formally signed the closing papers, preserving both the space and its unique legacy within the community that shaped its existence.”
