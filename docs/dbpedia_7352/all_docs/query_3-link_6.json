But where exactly do terms like \"Hail Mary\" and \"Shotgun\" actually come from?\n\nMost football terms actually have a unique and spellbinding history. They can come from former players, coaches or even from other sports like rugby.\n\nSpecifically, there are 25 terms that seem the wackiest.\n\nLet's break them down and find out where all the madness began.\n\n25. Onside Kick\n\n1 of 25\n\nThe onside kick is a desperation move by the kickoff team to retain possession of the football.\n\nThe term onside kick originated in rugby where players have to be onside in order to be allowed to gain possession of the kickoff.\n\nThe play is used in both Canadian and American football along with rugby.\n\n24. Mike, Sam, Will Linebackers\n\n2 of 25\n\nThink about this one for a second and you can probably figure out it's origins.\n\nThe moniker of \"Mike, Sam and Will\" grew out of a need to identify linebackers in a 4-3 defensive scheme.\n\nIf this were the military it would be Mike, Sierra and Whiskey, but that is neither here nor there.\n\nIn the 3-4 defense the extra linebacker is called the \"Mo\".\n\n23. Run and Shoot\n\n3 of 25\n\nIf you have seen a June Jones coached football game then you have seen the \"run and shoot\" offense.\n\nHe has perfected the formation during his time at Hawaii and Southern Methodist University.\n\nHowever, the run and shoot is not his brainchild.\n\nThat honor goes to former Middletown, Ohio High School football coach Glenn \"Tiger\" Ellison.\n\nIn it's earliest incarnations Ellison called his new set the \"Lonesome Polecat\".\n\nAfter making some adjustments the run and shoot was born.\n\n22. Red Zone\n\n4 of 25\n\nThe 20 yard line to the end zone is the mythical area known as the \"red zone.\"\n\nWhy not the blue or green zone you ask?\n\nBecause red is seen as a warning color for the defense.\n\nOnce the offense reaches the \"red zone,\" they are in prime scoring position.\n\n21. Safety\n\n5 of 25\n\nSafety actually has two meanings in football.\n\nOne implies the two points that can be scored for pinning the opposing team in their own end zone and the other is a defensive position.\n\nThe score is the reason for the interesting naming.\n\nIt comes from the beginnings of football when a team which possessed the ball near its own goal line could down it in the end zone and have the ball placed at the 25 yard line.\n\n20. Shotgun\n\n6 of 25\n\nOnce the quarterback takes a few steps behind the line of scrimmage in anticipation of the snap, it is called the shotgun formation.\n\nThe shotgun sprays the receivers all over the field.\n\nThe origins date back to former 49ers coach Red Hickey and his need to beat the Baltimore Colts vaunted pass rush.\n\nHis answer?\n\nThe shotgun formation.\n\n19. Bull Rush\n\n7 of 25\n\nThe term bull rush literally brings to mind images of the running of the bulls in Spain.\n\nThe term describes a defensive lineman attempting to run right through an offensive player rather than trying to make some fancy move to get around him.\n\nThink Haloti Ngata of the Ravens all the time.\n\n18. Nickel and Dime Packages\n\n8 of 25\n\nThe nickel and dime formations were both unsurprisingly coined with money in mind.\n\nThe nickel defense was created by Philadelphia Eagles defensive coach Jerry Williams in 1960 as a way to stop Chicago Bears tight end Mike Ditka.\n\nAs you may have guessed, it contains five defensive backs.\n\nThe dime adds a sixth defensive back to the equation. Two nickels make a dime.\n\nMath and football can work together.\n\n17. Gridiron\n\n9 of 25\n\nSee that image?\n\nThat is a gridiron used in cooking, and it looks eerily similar to the playing field of a football game.\n\nNo fancy nineteenth century origin story here, folks. The field is called a gridiron because it looks like—well—a gridiron.\n\n16. Halfback\n\n10 of 25\n\nThe halfback is a running back, but the running back is not half a player, so why call him a halfback?\n\nThe origin of this moniker dates back to the 1940's when there were usually four men in a backfield and each was a threat to run or throw the ball.\n\nThe halfbacks were named as such because of their location in the backfield. The fullback was farthest from the line of scrimmage, the quarterback was the closest and the halfbacks were in the middle.\n\n15. Pigskin\n\n11 of 25\n\nThe most basic and simple origin story on this list.\n\nA football is often affectionately referred to as the \"pigskin.\"\n\nThis is because the earliest footballs were made from natural materials like inflated pig bladders.\n\nNowadays, the balls are made with rubber or plastic.\n\n14. Horse Collar Tackle\n\n12 of 25\n\nFootball players bear no resemblance to horses.\n\nYet, when they are tackled by their necks from behind, it is referred to as a \"horse collar tackle.\"\n\nThis is because an actual horse collar is the part of a horse harness device used to distribute load around the horse's neck and shoulders when pulling a wagon or plow—similar to the way a player's neck and shoulders are grabbed on the tackle.\n\nThe play is known to cause injuries, and was it banned in 2005.\n\n13. Pooch Punt\n\n13 of 25\n\nNo, a pooch punt is not a reference to kicking a dog.\n\nIt is actually a short punt designed to avoid lethal kick returners like Devin Hester and DeSean Jackson,\n\nEven Bear Bryant would have his quarterbacks attempt the kick to throw off opposing defenses on third downs.\n\nAn interesting strategy, to say the least.\n\n12. Audible\n\n14 of 25\n\nThe audible is Peyton Manning's bread and butter—changing the play or disguising the call to confuse or take advantage of the defense.\n\nThe standard definition of the word audible is \"heard or perceptible by the ear\".\n\nTurns out that is why it is used in football too.\n\nCrazy.\n\n11. Gunner\n\n15 of 25\n\nA gunner is one of the most versatile weapons on a football team, and yet, also one of the most overlooked.\n\nThe gunner is the special teams weapon that blazes down the field on a kickoff in an attempt tackle the return man.\n\nThe origin of this term is not too hard to figure out. The gunner runs in a straight line down the field as fast as he can as if shot out of a gun.\n\nStill, it's an interesting nickname if nothing else.\n\n10. Squib Kick\n\n16 of 25\n\nThe squib kick, like the \"pooch kick\" and the \"onside kick,\" is another kicking variation that spices things up when the ball has to be kicked.\n\nBill Walsh credits Mike Squib (now a kicking consultant for the San Diego Chargers) for creating the squib kick. He saw Squib kick the ball short at a local high school football game in California.\n\nIt's first use in the NFL was actually an accident.\n\nIn 1981, San Francisco 49ers kicker Ray Wersching miskicked a kickoff against the Detroit Lions at the Pontiac Silverdome.\n\nThe ball took a series of odd bounces off the AstroTurf carpeting and worked in the 49ers favor.\n\nThe rest is history.\n\n9. Wildcat\n\n17 of 25\n\nEver popular in college football and sometimes trendy in the NFL is the Wildcat formation.\n\nIt calls for the quarterback to line up as a wide receiver and for the running back or wideout to take the snap from center.\n\nAside from the wacky nature of the play itself, it's origins began with the Delaware Blue Hens and the \"wing-T\".\n\nThe formation became known as the wildcat when it was popularized by Gus Malzahn and David Lee at the University of Arkansas.\n\n8. Flea Flicker\n\n18 of 25\n\nThe origins of the flea flicker are truly unique.\n\nThe creation of the play has been credited to former University of Illinois coach Bob Zuppke.\n\nIn a 1951 letter, he wrote that he had introduced the play while coaching at Oak Park High in 1910.\n\nZuppke stated that the phrase was meant to evoke \"the quick flicking action of a dog getting rid of fleas.\"\n\nA quarterback handing the ball off to a running back only to have it tossed back to him.\n\nDoesn't quite make me think of a dog, but I'll go with it.\n\n7. Blitz\n\n19 of 25\n\nAh, the blitz.\n\nA term so popular it has spawned it's own video game series.\n\nSurely you can guess the origins of this defensive term...\n\nIt comes from the war moniker \"blitzkrieg,\" which means \"lightning war\" in English.\n\n6. Super Bowl\n\n20 of 25\n\nWhile basketball's title series goes with the rather bland \"NBA Championship\" moniker the other three major sports have more inventive names for their apex contests.\n\nBaseball has the World Series, hockey has the Stanley Cup and football has the Super Bowl.\n\nAs the AFL and NFL leagues merged in the 1960's, they looked for a catchy name for the championship game.\n\nThe \"AFL-NFL World Championship Game\" clearly wasn't catchy enough, so AFL founder Lamar Hunt came up with the term Super Bowl after remembering the Super Ball his kids played with.\n\n5. Sack\n\n21 of 25\n\nIn actuality, tackling the quarterback while he has the ball behind the line of scrimmage was named a sack because of Deacon Jones.\n\nThe vaunted pass rusher came up with the phrase because it relates to the sacking of a city when it is devastated.\n\nNice work, Deacon.\n\n4. Line of Scrimmage\n\n22 of 25\n\nScrimmage is a funny word.\n\nWhy not just call it the line of play or the line of action?\n\nScrimmage, like many football terms, comes from rugby and what is affectionately known as the \"scrum\".\n\nScrum is short for scrummage which sounds an awful lot like scrimmage.\n\nSo scrummage equals scrimmage, scrimmage equals scrummage, Finkel is Einhorn and Einhorn is Finkel.\n\nGot it?\n\n3. Icing the Kicker\n\n23 of 25\n\nPerhaps icing the kicker dates back far beyond 2006, but that is when Mike Shanahan popularized it's current incarnation.\n\nThat is when rule changes allowed coaches to call timeouts from the sidelines.\n\nShanahan used this to the Denver Broncos advantage when he successfully \"iced\" Oakland Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski.\n\nIcing has gotten a little out of hand since, and there are virtually no stats that prove it's worth, but icing the kicker is here to stay.\n\n2. Coffin Corner\n\n24 of 25\n\nA punter aims to place the ball near the corner of the field and pin the opposing team inside their own five yard line.\n\nThe name \"coffin corner\" actually comes from the coffin corner found in Victorian houses.\n\nIf you were expecting a more exciting history of the name, then you will be let down.\n\nIt comes from Victorian houses.\n\n1. Hail Mary\n\n25 of 25\n\nThe last second pass to try and escape the clutches of defeat or close out the first half of football.\n\nThe Hail Mary.\n\nWhy such a religious name for a football play?\n\nUnsurprisingly, the term started at Notre Dame when players Elmer Layden and Jim Crowley used it to describe a long, low percentage pass.\n\nNow, it is one of the most thrilling plays in football.\n\nX"
