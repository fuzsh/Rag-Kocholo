        "text": "In the past year, Marvin Harrison Jr. has earned a collection of distinctive labels.\n\nMost deem him a “generational talent.” Many believe he’s the best prospect in the 2024 NFL draft. And Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James has called the star wide receiver from Ohio State University simply “H.I.M.”\n\nNow, Harrison will be regarded as the face of football for a footwear company after signing a multiyear endorsement deal with New Balance, the Boston brand officially announced Tuesday.\n\nHarrison, 21, the son of former Indianapolis Colts wideout and 2016 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Marvin Harrison, joins defensive ends Chase Young of the Washington Commanders and Will Anderson Jr. of the Houston Texans as the only three players to represent New Balance in the NFL.\n\nNew Balance handpicked Harrison to headline the first cleats in the brand’s 118-year history designed specifically for American football. The debut New Balance Fortress and Prodigy models will be unveiled Thursday in Detroit ahead of the first round of the NFL draft, in which Harrison is projected to be a top-5 pick.\n\nAnd during his rookie season, Harrison will wear the low-cut skill and speed silhouette, named the Prodigy.\n\n“From the first conversation with Marvin it was clear that he was a perfect fit for us at New Balance,” Naveen Lokesh, New Balance’s head of global sports marketing for American football and basketball, said in a statement. “Marvin’s drive, passion and incredible work ethic speak to the person that he is on and off the field. His dedication to everything he does will help us launch New Balance into the American Football category and push the boundaries of what athletes can do to inspire the next generation. We are excited to start this journey together and co-author our legacy in sport culture.”\n\nAndscape caught up with Harrison a few days before the draft via the Zoom platform. He rocked a black “NB” beanie and beamed with pride while speaking on his landmark endorsement deal with New Balance.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHow did this partnership unfold? And what factored into your decision to start your NFL career with New Balance?\n\nI just think the values that New Balance and I share have aligned. Most importantly, the brand will allow me to have an impact on the community and the younger generation. I want to inspire young athletes to be great in their own way.\n\nWhen did the conversations start with New Balance? When exactly did the conversations start with NB?\n\nMy dad handled all of my NIL deals while I was in college. He wanted me to focus on just football. So, the process didn’t begin for me until after last season. Once I started joining meetings, New Balance and I connected on a different level. Folks at the brand shared similar family values that are really important to me. New Balance felt like a family business with a tight circle, which made it an easy decision for me. And now, I already have my own little tight circle at New Balance.\n\nWhat does joining a brand that wants you to be the face of its foray into football mean?\n\nThere’s value, for sure, in being the face of a brand, especially one entering the football world. But, it really just gives me an opportunity to be out there and inspire the younger generation. That’s what I’m most excited about, and it seemed like New Balance felt the same way.\n\nFrom a footwear standpoint, how involved was the process of New Balance pitching you?\n\nI got my feet measured. That was the first part of the process. Then they began asking what I liked in a cleat. I could tell they wanted to make sure they could deliver what was best for me, which felt very supportive. The moment was special because it made me feel like I needed to get out of their way and hear what was best for me. I just told them I wanted to be comfortable and supported while still able to perform at a high level. The Prodigy cleat checks all those boxes for me. I honestly couldn’t be happier with the cleat.\n\nWas it your first time getting your feet officially measured?\n\nWhen you first get to Ohio State, they measure your feet there. But it was my first time since then. I don’t think I found out anything weird this time around. My size is my size.\n\nHow would you describe your first time training or playing in New Balance footwear?\n\nThe cleats felt great, largely because New Balance has already built a reputation for comfort based on lifestyle and other athletic shoes for different sports. In terms of comfort, the football cleat functions the exact same as everything New Balance puts out. It’s just now the brand is adding the performance aspect of football to the mix. As a receiver, I have to do a lot of movements and position my feet to run fast and change directions. And the New Balance cleat allows me to do everything at an extremely high level. The combination of comfort and performance was noteworthy, for sure.\n\nWhen you reflect on your childhood, when did you realize your pops had a footwear endorsement deal?\n\nHe always had all these pairs of Air Jordans that seemed to appear out of nowhere. [Laughs.] That made me realize he had a Jordan deal.\n\nHave you ever played in any of his Jordan PE [player-exclusive] cleats?\n\nNahhh. My dad had a totally different designed cleat for AstroTurf. As a kid, I was just playing on regular grass, so I never used his cleats. I also think he’s maybe a 12, and I wear a size 13.\n\nAny cleat superstitions?\n\nI don’t have any, actually. I’m ready to rock and roll as long as my cleats feel good.\n\nThere are only four wide receivers in NFL history who have had an off-field signature shoe. Can you name them?\n\nI’ve never really kept track. But I know Calvin Johnson had one.\n\nIs a signature shoe a goal of yours?\n\nMaybe somewhere down the line. Whatever happens, happens as I continue to build this relationship. If a signature shoe is the direction New Balance and I decide to take, that would be great. It would definitely be an honor to have my own signature shoe. But we’ll see what happens in the future.\n\nYou’ve frequently been labeled a “generational talent,” and you’re about to start your NFL career wearing a cleat called the Prodigy. Is there any pressure to take on those monikers?\n\nI think my standards for myself are equally high. I already put a lot of pressure on myself to reach certain goals, to the point that I don’t think any added pressure will affect me. I don’t want to do too much, but I want to go out there, work as hard as I can and perform to the best of my abilities.\n\nWhere do you want to see New Balance go over the next few years as the face of the brand in football?\n\nThis opportunity means a lot. I hope my platform and this partnership help me give back to the communities in Philadelphia, where I’m from, Columbus, Ohio, where I went to Ohio State and whatever new city I go to when I’m drafted. I’m just ready to inspire younger athletes to make it to the NFL one day.\n\nHave you thought about how cool it’s gonna be to see kids eventually wearing New Balance cleats because of you?\n\nDefinitely. Because I already know that’s going to be awesome. After me, my little brother [Jett Harrison], who’s 14 will probably be the first to wear New Balance cleats. He’ll be rocking the same cleats as me, which is gonna be really cool. It’s also gonna be fun to see how much the brand grows — and, hopefully, take over football fields.\n\nAaron Dodson is a sports and culture writer at Andscape.
