        "text": "Who are the NFL's highest-paid players at every position? Plenty of record-setting deals have been made in the past year -- the quarterback position has been reset with a new highest-paid player four times. First Jalen Hurts, then Lamar Jackson and Justin Herbert and Joe Burrow became the highest-paid player in NFL history as the 2023 season kicked off.\n\nLast August, San Francisco 49ers DE Nick Bosa became the highest-paid defensive player. In June, Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson shattered the record for most guaranteed money given to a non-quarterback on offense, getting $110 million guaranteed.\n\nWe tracked the best-paid players at 16 different positions -- including long-snapper -- and will keep the numbers updated as more records get broken. To get the full picture on the top earners in this league, we sorted positions by two categories, which in a few cases have the same player at No. 1:\n\nThree-year average (APY)\n\nTotal guaranteed money\n\nSalary information courtesy of Roster Management System.\n\nLet's start with Burrow and the highest-paid quarterbacks:\n\nJump to:\n\nQB | RB | WR | TE\n\nOT | OG | OC | EDGE\n\nDT | LB | CB | S\n\nK | LS | P\n\nQuarterback\n\nHighest three-year APY:\n\n1.
