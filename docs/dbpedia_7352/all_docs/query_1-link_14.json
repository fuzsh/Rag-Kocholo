        "text": "Football is one of the most exciting sports in the world, although for some people it is not so easy to understand how the game is played, the number of players on the field or each of the positions.\n\nIt is important to know what the positions of the players are, both in offense and defense, as well as the role of each of the players we enjoy, mainly in the NFL, as well as their abbreviations.\n\nPositions in Football\n\nOffensive players (11 players)\n\nQuarterback (QB): He is the leader of the offense, who calls the plays, whether he passes the ball to a receiver or hands it off to the running back, even running with the ball himself.\n\nRunning Back (RB): The team's running backs in an offensive formation must be fast, explosive, usually not very tall and have great lower body strength.\n\nFullback (FB): Another running back, he is located behind the middle of the line. In addition to running, he can block to open holes on running plays and occasionally catches short passes.\n\nOffensive Line: Has five offensive linemen, the left tackle (LT), left guard (LG), center (C), right guard (RG) and right tackle (RT) from left to right. Their job is to block to allow the quarterback to choose the play to run.\n\nWide Receivers (WR): They are two players who serve as pass receivers, they are usually fast, light and are in charge of catching the quarterback's passes despite being covered by the defenders.\n\nTight End (TE): A combination of a receiver and an offensive lineman, as they can block or separate from the line to catch passes.\n\nDefensive players (11 players)\n\nDefensive Line: It is made up of three or four players who line up in front of the offensive line, they are the first line of defense. They are usually two Defensive Ends (DE) on either side and one or two Defensive Tackles (DT), and they try to get rid of the offensive linemen's blocks and tackle whoever is carrying the ball.\n\nLinebacker (LB): They are responsible for backing up the defensive line. Depending on the defensive alignment, there may be three or four players of this position on the field.\n\nCornerback (CB): They are usually two players, the fastest of the defensive line, they usually cover the wide receivers, but they also blitz the quarterback."
