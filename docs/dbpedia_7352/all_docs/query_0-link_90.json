        "text": "Side Lines\n\nThe side lines on a football field run the length of the field (120 yards/360ft/109.8m) and define the playing area. Any player that takes the ball outside the side-line, will be ruled out of play. The ball will then be placed on the closest yard-line to where the ball was taken out of bounds for the next down to begin. Team areas also are located beyond the side-line.\n\nEnd Zone\n\nThese are the scoring zones at either end of the field. The end-zones are located in between the goal line and end-line and they run the whole width of the field. End zones are 10 yards (30ft/9.1m) in length from the goal line to the end-line, and 53.3 yards (160ft/48.8m) wide. The size of end-zones is the same for high school, college and NFL football. As mentioned previously, in NFL FLAG, there is a 10-yard (30ft/9.1m) end-zone at either end.\n\nYard Lines\n\nThe hash marks are separated every 5 yards (15ft/4.6m) by full-field lines called yard lines. Unlike the hash marks these lines will cover the full width of the field. Every tenth yard (30ft/9.1m) from the goal line is marked by a field number on both sides near the side lines. These numbers start at 10 at either end of the field and work up in multiples of ten to the 50-yard line at the centre of the field.\n\nHash Marks\n\nThese are small white markings that designate each individual yard (3ft/0.9m) on the field from goal line to goal line. They are marked by 2ft/61cm lines. If a play ends outside of the hash marks or the side line, then the next play will start at the nearest hash mark to the end of that last play. There is a set of hash marks next to each sideline and two sets marked further towards the centre of the field.\n\nThe distance between these two sets of central hash marks varies dependant on the level being played.\n\nFor high school football, the two sets of central hash marks are 17.6 yards (53ft/16.2m) apart, with each individual set being 26.5ft/8.1m) from the middle of the field. In college football, the distance between the two is reduced, with each set of central hash marks being 13.3 yards (40ft/12.2m) apart, with each set being 6.6 yards (20ft/6.1m) from the middle. This distance decreases further in the NFL to 6 yards (18ft/5.5m) apart, with each set of hash marks being 3 yards (9ft/2.7m) from the middle of the field."
