        "text": "Football is the ultimate team sport. Every play is designed like a machine, with each individual doing their part to keep things running. If one person fails, the entire team could fail.\n\nIt’s the same story whether you’re on offense or defense. Every football position serves a purpose, especially in flag football where you’ll find fewer players on the field. While tackle football consists of 11 players, NFL FLAG football teams compete 5 on 5. So, the positions in football differ depending on how many players there are.\n\nIf you’re new to 5 on 5 flag football, this football positions 5 on 5 chart will help you get a better understanding of where each player starts on the line of scrimmage and what their role is on the field.\n\nWhat are the positions in flag football? In simple terms, flag football positions are essentially the same as tackle, but without the linemen. There are five players on the field in NFL FLAG football—for both offense and defense—with assigned roles. Here’s a basic overview of the football positions 5 on 5.\n\nFootball offense positions:\n\nQuarterback: The quarterback receives the snap and passes the ball or hands it off (they aren’t allowed to run with the ball after the snap).\n\nCenter: The center snaps the ball to the quarterback and then can run for a pass as a receiver.\n\nWide receiver: Depending on the play, some 5 on 5 teams field three receivers, or a couple receivers and a running back. The receiver runs designated routes to catch a pass (usually right and left receivers).\n\nRunning back: The running back takes a hand off and runs with the ball or throws it. They’re also eligible to receive a pass.\n\nFootball defense positions:\n\nDefensive back: The defensive back covers wide receivers, either man-to-man or zone.\n\nSafety: The safety stands further back from the line of scrimmage and is responsible for stopping opponents who get loose.\n\nRusher: The rusher attempts to prevent the quarterback from passing the ball (must be at least seven feet off the line of scrimmage at the snap to rush the passer).\n\nFlag football positions 7 on 7:\n\nKeep in mind that there are many versions of flag football, including 6 on 6, 7 on 7, 8 on 8, and 9 on 9. So as the team size increases, so do the football positions. For example, flag football positions 7 on 7 use a combination of wide receivers, running backs and tight ends on offense, in addition to the quarterback and center. The number of each position depends on the coach’s strategy and whether limited contact is allowed on the field.\n\nOn defense, players can also be assigned as linebackers, who line up behind the rusher, in 7 on 7.\n\nPlayers who have a well-rounded skill set make the most impact in an offensive football position. They can throw, catch, and quickly run complicated pass routes. They have the ability to read the field and know how to adapt their football position during a play to successfully advance downfield. Here are the offense football positions explained:\n\nQuarterback - Think of the quarterback as the team’s offensive leader. This football position is responsible for calling the play or receiving direction from the coach and then communicating it to the rest of the team. In NFL FLAG football, every play begins with a snap to the quarterback, who then decides to hand it off or pass it. They’re a central part of the team as they touch the ball on every drive and are highly visible players.\n\nSkills\n\nGood vision of the field\n\nAbility to read the defense\n\nPassing fundamentals, such as wind up, release, accuracy, and strength\n\nQuickness to avoid a defensive pass rush\n\nLeadership skills and mental toughness under pressure\n\nCenter - A center is responsible for snapping the ball to the quarterback and reading the opposing team’s defense. This football position differs the most compared to its tackle counterpart. The center actually becomes a wide receiver after snapping the ball, so you’ll often find them running a pass route immediately after the snap.\n\nSkills\n\nProper coordination to accurately snap the ball to the quarterback to begin the play\n\nQuick reflexes\n\nAbility to read the defensive team while clearly communicating with the quarterback\n\nSimilar skills as a receiver: Ability to sharply increase speed and take off downfield for a pass, correct technique to grip the ball and successfully catch a pass\n\nWide receiver - The wide receiver’s main job is to catch a pass from the quarterback or another player and advance down the field or score. They’re constantly running precise and often complex pass routes to try and get themselves in a position away from their defender to receive a pass. In flag football, teams typically have two to three wide receivers on the field at once.\n\nSkills\n\nSpeed and stamina go a long way for wide receivers as they’re always trying to outrun the other team\n\nAbility to run specific and complex pass routes\n\nGood hands and athleticism to catch difficult passes (acceleration, strength, jumping)\n\nClearly communicates with quarterback\n\nRunning back - This position in football is responsible for carrying the ball during a running play. The center lines up in the backfield and after the ball is snapped, they move forward to receive a hand-off from the quarterback and run with the ball to advance down the field. If they don’t receive the ball from the quarterback, they can become a receiver as well. Running plays are not permitted within five yards of the midfield or end zone in NFL FLAG football, so this football position typically adapts their role to the play more often than others.\n\nSkills\n\nQuick feet and acceleration are key traits of a good running back\n\nMultifaceted player who understands fundamentals and can fill in where they’re needed most\n\nSimilar skills as a wide receiver: Good hands and athleticism to catch difficult passes (acceleration, strength, jumping)\n\nFOOTBALL DEFENSE POSITIONS\n\nSince there’s no contact in flag football, such as tackling or blocking, defense looks a little different. Instead of linemen, there are five defensive football players who typically take on one of two positions: a defensive back or rusher. But all flag football defensive positions have the same objective: to prevent the offensive team from scoring. Here are the defensive football positions explained.\n\nDefensive backs - A defensive back’s primary goal is to defend wide receivers and intercept the incoming pass or pull the flags off the ball-carrier’s belt. These positions in football can play either man-to-man or zone, depending on the coach’s strategy and league rules.\n\nSkills\n\nQuick and agile to defend opposing players\n\nMental sharpness to read the field and react to a passing play vs. a running play\n\nAbility to react to the ball and intercept the pass\n\nTechnique to properly pull the ball-carrier’s flags off: correct alignment, stance, and movement\n\nRusher - Rushing the passer is an important role on defense as it prevents the quarterback from completing the pass. The rusher starts seven yards behind the line of scrimmage at the snap and the quarterback has a seven-second pass clock to throw the ball. Bottom line: The quicker the rusher gets to the quarterback, the more opportunities the defensive team has to force mistakes and intercept the pass.\n\nSkills\n\nSpeed and acceleration, with the ability to come under control once they are within distance of the quarterback to remove the flag(s)\n\nTechnique to properly pull the ball-carrier’s flags off: correct alignment, stance, and movement\n\nSafety - Some flag football teams will play with a safety on their defense, although this is more commonly found in 7 on 7 leagues. This player sits further back behind the line of scrimmage and acts as a catch-all, stopping anyone who gets loose. If an offensive player makes it out of a running play, or a wide receiver goes deep, the safety covers and prevents the ball-carrier from scoring.\n\nSkills\n\nAbility to read the field and play, while making game-time decisions on where coverage is needed\n\nSpeed and acceleration\n\nTechnique to properly pull the ball-carrier’s flags off: correct alignment, stance, and movement\n\nDefensive positions in football have three main responsibilities: to read the play, see the ball and “tackle” the ball-carrier by removing their flag(s). Even though players aren’t physically tackling their opponents, many of these defensive skills directly transfer over to tackle football. For example, the way that flag football players are required to square up their body and align their head and knees with their opponent before pulling off their flags is the exact same positioning needed to physically tackle a player. That’s why coaches are adamant about teaching proper technique, as these fundamentals are necessary among every position in football.\n\nWHAT POSITION SHOULD I PLAY IN FLAG FOOTBALL?\n\nNow that you understand the different positions in football, it’s time to figure out which one is the best fit. Luckily, flag football players develop a variety of skills—no matter the football position they pick—because of the overlapping responsibilities in a given play.\n\nFor example, a center often transitions into a receiver after snapping the ball; a quarterback can run for a pass after handing off the ball; and any player is allowed to throw a forward pass. On defense, there’s no tackling, so these positions in football use similar skill sets when preventing the offense from advancing.\n\nKeep in mind, too, that there are only five players on the field at once, so each player participates on offense and defense. In other words, specialization isn’t as common in flag football as it is in tackle. But if you’re looking to specialize, such as a quarterback or wide receiver, then you can definitely gain valuable technical skills here.\n\nAll positions in football come with benefits—and the best part is that players don’t need a specific build to succeed. Flag football is incredibly inclusive and many players of different developments find a football position where they can be competitive.\n\nWhen families ask us specifically about girls flag football positions we always answer—the same as boys! Flag football is designed without contact, so that both female and male players can compete in every position. In fact, there are several flag football co-ed leagues across the country.\n\nThe bottom line is that flag football players are constantly moving and adapting their role to the play. That’s why versatile, well-rounded players tend to be most successful. So no matter the football position you pick, you’ll learn a variety of transferable skills."
