        "text": "One of the most important factors in the NFL's success outside the US is the organisation of regular season games at international locations. Since 2007, the NFL has played some of its regular season games in London, and in recent years has also played in Mexico and Canada. The NFL's European debut took place in 2022, when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks played the first-ever regular-season game in Germany on November 13, 2022. The NFL took Munich by storm - a total of 69,811 fans from the United States and Europe attended the sold-out game at the Allianz Arena. So it's no surprise that Frankfurt hosted two National Football League games in 2023, breaking records once again. More than 100,000 fans watched the games live at Deutsche Bank Park and the NFL celebrated the highest merchandising sales on a match day outside the US. The logical consequence: NFL teams will come to Germany again in 2024.\n\nAnother reason for the NFL's success outside the US is the increased access to the league's games and content through global media. The rise of streaming services and the internet have made it easier for fans around the world to watch games live. In Germany, American football has become the second most popular sport on German free TV. Together with broadcaster ProSieben, the NFL has established a firm place in the German public's interest in the sport. Cologne-based RTL has been broadcasting the NFL since April 2023, bringing the sport further into the mainstream. A strong social media presence with up to six figure followers keeps fans around the world up to date with the latest news and analysis, while the NFL's multilingual website provides in-depth coverage of games and events.\n\nThe NFL has also been actively working to expand its presence in China in recent years. This includes a multi-year partnership agreement with a leading internet and technology company in China to livestream games and deliver NFL content to Chinese audiences, as well as events and initiatives such as the NFL China Flag tournament and NFL China Academy to promote the sport and engage Chinese fans. In 2020, the NFL China office announced that it will work with local partners to build stadiums and establish youth and grass-root American football programs across the country."
