        "text": "It isnât the uniform that separates one football player from the others; itâs his talent and heart. But the uniform and its protective pads are a necessary part of playing football, something any player would be foolhardy to take the field without.\n\nWhy the need for all this protection? Well, the NFL is made up of players ranging in weight from 150 to 360 pounds and in height from 5'5\" to 6'9\". Some of these assorted sizes are able to bench press 550 pounds and run the 40-yard dash in as fast as 4.2 seconds. Because of the varied weights, sizes, strengths, and speeds of NFL players, the best protection possible is necessary. Smaller players want to be able to play without worrying about being crushed by all those large bodies.\n\nThe jersey\n\nThe jersey is the uniformâs shirt. The jersey is basically each playerâs identity and marks his allegiance to a specific team. The jersey must be large enough to cover the shoulder pads.\n\nEvery NFL team jersey comes with a different numeral to distinguish one player from another. The numerals, which appear on the front and back of the jersey, are 8 inches high and 4 inches wide. Most high school and college teams have the same specifications, and some also place the number on the jerseyâs sleeve.\n\nIn the NFL, specific positions wear certain numerals. For example:\n\nQuarterbacks and kickers wear from 1 to 19.\n\nRunning backs and defensive backs wear from 20 to 49.\n\nLinebackers wear from 50 to 59 or 90 to 99.\n\nOffensive linemen wear from 50 to 79.\n\nDefensive linemen wear from 60 to 79 or 90 to 99.\n\nReceivers wear from 10 to 19 or 80 to 89.\n\nOn the back of each NFL jersey is the playerâs surname in letters that are 2 1/2 inches high. His name appears across the upper-back just above the numerals.\n\nHelmets and face masks\n\nThe helmet and face mask are designed to protect a playerâs face and head from serious injury. Many players also wear a mouth guard to protect their teeth and prevent themselves from biting their tongues. A few players even wear another protective cap on the outside of the helmet for added protection.\n\nHelmets can come equipped with these features:\n\nChin straps: To keep the helmets snugly in place.\n\nAir-filled interior pockets: To prevent serious concussions, many helmets have air-filled pockets inside them. A player tests his helmet by sticking his head inside it and then shaking it for comfort, also making sure that itâs snug. If itâs too tight, he simply releases air from the air pockets.\n\nFace masks: The rounded metal material that comprises all face masks canât be more than 5/8 inch in diameter. Most linemen wear a face mask called a cage, which has a bar extending down from the middle and top of the helmet to below the nose area. There, this bar joins two or three bars that extend from both sides that completely prevent an opponentâs hands from reaching inside the face area and under the chin. However, few quarterbacks and receivers have a face mask with a bar coming between their eyes, because they want to ensure they can see clearly; many also leave the chin exposed.\n\nSunshade: Some helmets have a sunshade across the eyes to prevent sun glare from interfering with the playerâs vision. This sunshade also keeps opponents from seeing the playerâs eyes, which may give the player an advantage because opponents canât see where the player is looking.\n\nPads\n\nPads are necessary to absorb the many physical blows a player takes during a game and protect every part of his body.\n\nNext to the helmet, the shoulder pads are probably the number-one protective gear players wear. These pads protect a playerâs shoulders, plus his sternum region, from injury. Some of these pads also cover the top of the arm and the rotator cuff. Other pads include thigh pads, elbow pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads, although not all players wear them. Some quarterbacks even wear flak jackets to protect their rib cages, which are vulnerable when they lift their arms to throw the ball.\n\nShoes and cleats\n\nFootball cleats come in 1/2-inch, 5/8-inch, 3/4-inch, and 1-inch lengths. Wearing the right cleat is definitely important for traction. If a player doesnât have the proper traction indoors or outside on a muddy surface, he simply canât do his job and perform at the highest level. What type of cleat you use depends on a number of factors:\n\nConditions on the field: The shorter cleat, which makes a player less prone to injury, is worn on dry, firm fields because it provides the ideal traction for these fast fields. On a slippery grass field, a player â especially a big lineman across the line of scrimmage â needs to dig deep to gain traction. In that situation, the player switches to a 3/4- or 1-inch cleat, depending on how heâs maneuvering (stopping and going) during warm-ups.\n\nPosition: Receivers and running backs often wear shoes with fewer cleats than the larger, more physical players do.\n\nField material: For artificial surfaces, most players wear a shoe that has a sole of dozens of rubber-nubbed, 1/2-inch cleats. Some linemen prefer a basketball-type shoe, especially on indoor turf where thereâs no chance of rain and the surface isnât as slick.\n\nBecause artificial surfaces tend to be sticky, players want to be able to glide over the surface. They donât want to stop on a dime and change directions. Many players believe that instant stop and restart can be hazardous to their knees and ankles."
