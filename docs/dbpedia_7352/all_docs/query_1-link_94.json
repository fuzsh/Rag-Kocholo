        "text": "Motion is one of the many ways an offense can attempt to deceive the defense by moving players around the formation before the ball is snapped. The different motions used in football and how they are performed legally can be confusing to those not familiar with the idea.\n\nMotion in football is identified as the pre-snap movement by a player aligned off the ball in the backfield while the ball is snapped. Only one player is allowed to be moving at the snap of the ball, and they can only move laterally, not toward the line of scrimmage.\n\nThis article will explain what a legal motion is and demonstrate various motions commonly used in the game.\n\nMotions In Football\n\nBoth the NCAA and the National Football League allow offensive players to move in motion prior to the snap. However, there are a few rules, and not anyone can go in motion.\n\nFirst, only one player can go in motion at a time. Once one player motions, he must get completely set before another person can go in motion.\n\nSecond, only players who are lined up off of the line of scrimmage can go in motion. Players who are on the line of scrimmage must first get off the line of scrimmage, then they can motion. We talk more about eligible receivers in the video below.\n\nOffensive linemen can not motion, however, they can shift.\n\nShifts\n\nIt is important to understand the difference between a motion and a shift when examining legal motions.\n\nThe offense is free to shift and move as many players as they want as long as they are all set for a full second before the ball is snapped.\n\nIf the offense wants to get set, and then move all of their players at the same time, they are allowed to do so, as long as the players aren’t moving at full speed. Any sudden football moves can be called a false start or illegal shift.\n\nMotioning is different than shifting because all players are allowed to be moving before the ball is snapped in shifting. Only one player is allowed to be moving in motion, and that movement must be lateral to the line of scrimmage.\n\nNo forward movement at the time of the snap is permitted\n\nTypes of Motion In Football\n\nEvery weekend during football season, it seems that a team will find a new way to move a skilled player before the snap. While there are countless forms of motion, the ones displayed below are ones found in most playbooks.\n\nJet\n\nJet is a motion across the formation with the ball being snapped just before the player reaches the quarterback. This allows for players to perform outside run plays while already at full speed at the snap of the ball. This is also known as “Fly” motion in some terminology, especially out of the Wing-T.\n\nFly\n\nAcross motion is very similar to “Jet.” The main difference is that the ball is snapped after the player crosses to the other side of the formation.\n\nGlide\n\nGlide is a motion by a player in an original outside alignment towards the ball. The ball is snapped once the player is in the area of about halfway to the last attached player (or the end man on the line). This allows for momentum and speed into a crossing route, a quick change of direction into an out-breaking route, or the ability to seal the outside on a run block.\n\nIn\n\nThis is a move into the backfield by a player from an outside alignment. There is usually a destination tag or word associated with this motion to tell the player where they are supposed to end up at the snap of the ball. For example, a gun, wing, or pistol could all be destinations for players using “In” motion.\n\nOver\n\nOver is usually performed by a tight end from one side of the backfield to the other. In general, it is a motion by a player in the backfield from one side of the formation to the corresponding spot on the opposite side.\n\nReturn\n\nReturn is built off of “Over” and “Across” motion. In Return, the player will cross over to the other side of the formation and then return to their original alignment at the snap of the ball.\n\nExit\n\nThis is a motion used by a running back as he leaves the backfield to a wide alignment. Exit is usually paired with a destination, for example, “Exit to Wide,” telling the back where they need to be in the formation.\n\nOrbit\n\nOrbit is another motion for the running back. This time the back will be in the shotgun, motion behind the quarterback, and move laterally down the line of scrimmage until the ball is snapped.\n\nRocket and Laser\n\nRocket and Laser are the same as “Orbit” minus passing behind the quarterback. The R and L in Rocket and Laser identify the right and left directional movement for the back. They start in the shotgun and move laterally down the line of scrimmage in the designated direction until the ball is snapped.\n\nSlide\n\nThe slide is similar to the previous two motions but adds a forward movement before the lateral movement. The back will start in the shotgun at the hip of the quarterback, move up to the backside of the offensive line, and then laterally down the line to the side of the formation they are aligned. This does not violate motion rules as they are not moving toward the line at the snap of the ball.\n\nBenefits of Motion\n\nThe reasons a team uses motion can fall under three different categories: momentum, deception, and leverage.\n\nMomentum, or speed when the ball is snapped, allows for the player to already build up to full speed at the snap rather than starting from a set stance from a standstill.\n\nThis allows for sweep plays to hit faster off of jet motion, wheel routes to take off quicker off of orbit motion, and crack blocks to gain more force off of glide motion.\n\nDeception is another advantage gained from motion. Flashing players across the formation can take the linebacker’s eyes off the ball and their read keys and away from the play.\n\nRunning a play that utilizes a certain motion can have the defense anticipating that play until you run a different concept off of that same motion leaving the defense confused and opened up for a big gain.\n\nFinally, leverage gained with motion creates an edge for the offense. Motioning to a wider alignment for an easier outside release and moving into the backfield to better secure a block are advantages that motion brings to the table.\n\nIllegal Motion & Illegal Shift\n\nThe player motioning or shifting can cause a penalty if not done properly.\n\nAnytime a player in motion moves forward toward the line of scrimmage, in a football act, they will be flagged for illegal motion.\n\nFor instance, if a player is motioning from left to right, but starts to turn up the field too soon, they will be called for an illegal motion.\n\nIf a player is in a stance, and accidentally starts to lean forward and moves abruptly, this can also be called for an illegal shift.\n\nThese calls for illegal motion and illegal shift are called pre-snap and result in a five-yard penalty.\n\nOther Notes on Motion\n\nCoaches have gotten creative in how they call their motions and shifts. You’ll often see back position changes or backfield players moving to wide receivers as a shift.\n\nThere are endless ways to run different variations of motions, the number one thing to consider is the legality of the motion when incorporating it into the offense.\n\nShifts are a great way to utilize multiple player movement pre-snap, just remember to be set for one full second before the ball is snapped.\n\nMany teams will pair the position with a shortened form of the motion for communication purposes. For example, teams that label the tight end as “Y” can use “YAC” for the Y-Across motion and “YIN” for the Y-In motion. If a team labels the running back as “T” those same principles can be applied to “TAC” (T-Across) and “TIN” (T-In) motion.\n\nDifferent teams will use different terminology for the same motions. That means you could see these same motions called different names depending on the system.\n\nKnowing about motions is one thing, but there’s so much more to learn about football! Don’t worry, we’re here to help!\n\nThese motions can be found pretty much in every football game. There is a lot to learn about offense and it can be pretty overwhelming. That’s why we created the Ultimate Football Guide to make things easy for you.\n\nNow that you’ve learned about motions in an offense, kick it up a notch and learn more about your position.\n\nRelated Questions\n\nWho Created The Jet Sweep?\n\nMotion has been around forever, but the modern jet sweep play is credited to being invented by Bob Stitts from the Colorado School of Mines in 2003. He incorporated the idea out of a shotgun formation, and it spread throughout the college ranks immediately after."
