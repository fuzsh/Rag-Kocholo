        "text": "Boston, MA – April 23, 2024 – Today, two-time unanimous All-American, 2023 Fred Biletnikoff Award winner and the top wide receiver in the 2024 NFL Draft, Marvin Harrison Jr. officially signs with the New Balance brand family. New Balance and Marvin plan to reveal the brands first American Football cleats exclusively at the draft.\n\nMarvin, a Philadelphia native, was one of the most talked-about athletes last year before being eligible for the draft and has proven himself as one of the most talented and hard-working wide receivers in the 2024 draft class. The standout wide receiver from The Ohio State University ended the 2023 season with 14 touchdowns, 67 receptions and 1,211 yards, an impressive resume to stand on as he steps into his professional career. Marvin will work closely with the New Balance design team to evolve the brand’s performance cleats as well as appear in brand campaigns across performance and lifestyle.\n\n“Family is very important to me and joining a family brand like New Balance felt like I was building a relationship that centers on trust and shared values,” says Marvin. “Being able to work closely with the design and product creation team so quickly and helping them launch the new cleats is just icing on the cake. I am excited to do the work and build something that will inspire the next generation and help me excel as I enter my professional football career.”\n\nAs the newest member of the New Balance family, Marvin will play an integral role in the evolution of the brand’s inaugural American Football cleat collection. As New Balance launches its first products in American Football, Marvin will help the brand reach young players and change the perception that players must sacrifice fit and feel when it comes to cleats; comfort and performance can live together in high-performance cleats.\n\n“From the first conversation with Marvin it was clear that he was a perfect fit for us at New Balance, his drive, passion and incredible work ethic speak to the person that he is on and off the field,” says Naveen Lokesh New Balance Head of Global Sports Marketing for American Football and Basketball. “His dedication to everything he does will help us launch New Balance into the American Football category and push the boundaries of what athletes can do to inspire the next generation. We are excited to start this journey together and co-author our legacy in sport culture.”\n\nAmerican football is known for power and force, however New Balance is approaching it differently and leaning into the intelligence needed to be successful long term in the league. Over the last few years the New Balance design team has focused on Football IQ, the player that knows the playbook by heart and stays up late watching tape and learning how to make a difference the next game. From the New Balance Sports Research Lab to the extensive high school, college and professional athlete testing, New Balance is looking to change the game, allowing players to wear comfortable cleats so they can focus on dominating on the field.\n\nFans attending the 2024 NFL draft in Detroit will be the first to see the New Balance Prodigy and New Balance Fortress cleats during an exclusive pop-up with Klutch Athletics by New Balance.
