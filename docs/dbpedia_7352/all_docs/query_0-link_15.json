I&#39;ll See You When We&#39;re Both Not So Emotional [4-Track Album Prep, 1999]\n19. The 7&#39;s [Live at the Blind Pig, Champaign, IL, 1997]\n\nIn the 15 years since its release, American Football&#39;s self-titled debut full-length has quietly become one of the most fiercely beloved titles in the Polyvinyl catalog. Though the trio -- Mike Kinsella (Cap&#39;n Jazz, Owen, Owls), Steve Lamos, and Steve Holmes -- only played a few shows and released just one other record (a three-song EP that preceded this full-length), their influence and legacy has steadily continued to grow in the time after they disbanded.\r\n\r\nFrom its now iconic artwork to the band&#39;s unique songwriting approach (highlighted by an emphasis on shifting time signatures and sincere lyrics), American Football proves a record doesn&#39;t become a true classic through flashiness or catering to trends, but rather the deep emotional connection it forges between the music and the listener.\r\n\r\nAfter guitarist Steve Holmes discovered a set of cassette tapes containing a variety of unreleased recordings, the band curated an album&#39;s worth of these rare live recordings, demos, and practice sessions (in which the group rehearsed material they never recorded elsewhere) to complement the original record.\r\n\r\nNow available on 2xLP and 2xCD, American Football is being re-issued with beautifully expanded packaging that incorporates new photographs from Chris Strong along with lyrics, detailed liner notes written by the band, and never-before-seen band pictures.",

        "text": "1.\n\nNever Meant 04:28 video\n\nLet's just forget Everything said. Everything we did. Best friends. Better-half's. Goodbye's. The autumn night when we realized we were falling out of love. (There were some things that were said that weren't meant, like you, \"never did.\") Not to be overly dramatic. i just think it's best, because you can't miss what you forget. So let's just pretend everything and anything between you me was never meant.\n\n2.\n\nThe Summer Ends 04:46\n\nI'm thinking about leaving and how I should say goodbye. with a handshake? or an embrace? or a kiss on the cheek? or possibly all three? Maybe I've been wrong. Maybe my intentions are irrelevant. Honestly, it's not just for. We've both been so unhappy, so let's just see what happens when the summer ends.\n\n3.\n\nHonestly? 06:10\n\nHonestly I can't remember all my teenage feelings and their meanings. They seem too see-thru to be true. All the \"who's\" are there, but the \"why's\" are unclear. Picture this -- a long awaited sickening kiss. How does it feel to know you've rewritten history despite the complicated beginning to all of this? Honestly?\n\n4.\n\nFor Sure 03:16\n\nJune seems too late. Delayed. (Maybe for the better -- imagine us together...) We're relatively stable. Tentatively able to say for certain whether this uncertainty is for sure.\n\n5.\n\n(instrumental)\n\n6.\n\nFools leave too soon. Built to fill roles and fall. Standing alone, distant and dissatisfied. These four years... a long goodbye with mixed emotions. Just fragments of another life. I'm not dead yet (but the regrets are killing me).\n\n7.\n\nIf you're so prone to accidents and misunderstandings, then you may accidentally misinterpret honesty for selfishness. We're two human beings. Individually. With inherent interest in each other and how we relate. If you're still prone to accidents and misunderstandings, you won't understand me and my motivation for being alone. We're just two human beings. individually. with inherent interest in each other and how we relate. Considering everything, me leaving with regrets only makes sense. I'll see you when we're both not so emotional.\n\n8.\n\nStay Home 08:10\n\nDon't leave home again if empathy takes energy. cause everyone feels just like you. That's life -- So social. So physical. So \"so-so\". So emotional. So stay home\n\n9.\n\n(instrumental)\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\n12.\n\n13.\n\n14.\n\n15.\n\n16.\n\n17.\n\n18."
