You can update your choices at any time in your settings.\n\nThe shape of an American football is officially termed a “prolate spheroid,” which means its polar axis (the measurement end-to-end) is longer than its equatorial diameter (the measurement around its middle). When thrown correctly, the ball spins and its shape generates a gyroscopic effect that reduces drag and stabilizes its flight.\n\nAmerican football traces its roots to rugby and soccer games in the 1850s. Back then, the evolving sport was played with a round-ish ball that featured an air-filled pig bladder and straw shoved into a leather cover. Keeping the ball inflated was a constant challenge, and no two balls had the same shape.\n\nIn its first decades, American football resembled a more violent version of rugby. Forward passes were illegal, so the game relied on short lateral tosses and large piles of players fighting for the ball (in which punches and kicks were common). Colleges were not above bringing in local thugs for Saturday afternoon contests.\n\nThis attitude shifted after the 1905 season, which resulted in 18 deaths and more than 150 serious injuries. Deciding enough was enough, President Teddy Roosevelt convened a White House meeting in December 1905 with leaders and coaches from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton to improve the game’s safety.\n\nAnd since it’s hard to throw a watermelon with one hand, the ball’s shape evolved. Rules changes in 1912 led to narrowing of the ends, and a shift toward a prolate spheroid shape that became standardized in 1935 by the decade-old National Football League.\n\nBalls must be 11 to 11 1/4 inches long\n\n28 to 28 1/2 inches around lengthwise\n\n21 to 21 1/4 around the equatorial axis\n\nBalls must weigh 14 to 15 ounces\n\nBalls must be inflated to 12 1/2 to 13 1/2 psi.\n\nThe league allows variation in the balls’ dimensions because each NFL football is made by hand at Wilson Sporting Goods’ factory in Ada, Ohio. Wilson won the contract to produce NFL footballs in 1941 and purchased the rights to the “The Duke” nickname from Spalding, the league’s original supplier.\n\nWilson’s 120 employees in Ada hand-cut steer hide into four panels that are stamped to create a pebble grain that improves each ball’s grip. The stamped panels are sewn together with the ball inside-out to keep seams on the inside of the ball. After the ball is inverted, a polyurethane bladder is inserted, and the ball is sewn closed.\n\nThe factory produces about 4,000 footballs a day. Each NFL team is supplied with 780 balls a season, which amounts to just under 25,000 balls for the league’s 32 teams. Wilson also supplies most college teams, with many of the Power 5 conference schools negotiating separate deals with Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour. Collectively, these schools account for hundreds of thousands of footballs."
