A historical, political and social contextualization of the formation of Brazilian cultural identity since colonial times is provided here in an attempt to establish a broad basis for understanding this phenomenon. In addition to presenting key events, authors and works from this period, the text addresses issues related to the literary production of the time, such as the role of the press in disseminating literature among the population, the influence of discussions regarding the definition of Brazilian identity, as well as the process of standardizing Brazilian Portuguese.",

        "text": "Interrogating Brazilian life and the nature of America, prose writers and poets will find a rich source of inspiration and will put their own face on national thought. This next independence will not be dated on the seventh of September, nor will its port be situated on the banks of the Ipiranga; it will not be done in one day, but slowly, to make it more durable; it will not be the work of one or two generations; many will work for it until it is fully accomplished.1\n\nMachado de Assis, 24/3/1873\n\nBrazil’s cultural autonomy and the deperipheralization of its literature have resulted from a long and complex process conditioned by several internal and external factors. The declaration of political independence from Portugal in September 1822 was only the commencement of a deeper transformation of the country. It was not a happy beginning. Built on monarchist foundations represented by King Pedro I, himself the son of the Portuguese sovereign, the putatively independent state fundamentally consolidated and strengthened the conservative forces in Brazilian society which remained elitist and pro-European. Liberal and progressive movements seeking to express and address the concerns of localities and to integrate them into wider social, cultural and linguistic spheres came under intense political pressure from the national government. This inhibition of regional movements slowed down in fundamental ways the process of emancipation based on European models. Brazilian institutions created during the 19th century came to reflect the tension between pro-European tendencies and forces emphasizing local, centrifugal anchoring. These antagonisms became evident in debates seeking to define the new state’s national principles and, relatedly, to influence the normative form of the national language. The literary context of this period was opened up for various authors who were increasingly diverging from the conservative trends of the political scene. Following these trends of decentralization, many writers sought to reflect and express local realities in their texts. Nevertheless, it remained quite difficult for many authors to fully escape axiological positions through which Europe dominated. From today’s perspective, the 19th century thus proves to be a period of ebb and flow in which advocates of the metropolis and European universalism were able to create and allocate various resources to maintain their influence over various segments of Brazilian society, while forces favorable to autochthonous cultures (often seeking ideological support from Europe itself) came to oppose such strong influences from the continent. On the other hand, the growing awareness of difference and the positive value of otherness began to occupy more and more space in Brazilian cultural life. The occasional victories that were won in the 1800s helped prepare the ground for the more profound transformation of Brazilian culture that would take place in the 20th century.\n\nThe origins of the complicated and ambivalent transition from colonial Brazil to an autonomous country stricto sensu, can be found in the history of colonization of Portuguese America, a trajectory very different from that of the Spanish in their American colonies. At the beginning of the Modern Age, the kingdoms of Portugal and Castile experienced a series of affinities as a result of the newly emerging international conjuncture. The conquest of Constantinople by the Turks as well as the ongoing bloody conflicts between Turkish and Christian militaries across Europe necessitated the search for new trade routes to East Asian markets. The new circumstances created a situation in which the geographical location of the Iberian Peninsula became extremely propitious for maritime expeditions. Suddenly the two rivals Spain and Portugal, for many centuries considered the “end of the world,” were suddenly at its center.\n\nSince the Portuguese Reconquista (1249) of territory occupied by Muslims was completed almost two hundred and fifty years earlier than that of Spain (1492), Portugal had the advantage of a more centralized government in planning and executing its overseas expeditions, which in consequence meant better internal conditions for strategic investment in maritime expansion. Portuguese colonial expansion began in 1415 with the capture of Ceuta on the north coast of Africa, an important strategic point in the control of the Strait of Gibraltar, while in comparison the first overseas expeditions financed by Castile were those of Columbus almost 80 years later beginning in 1492. The major material and propagative success of the Columbian journeys, however, finally helped balance the forces of the two naval powers. On 7 June 1494, the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed, sealing the fate of the southern part of the American continent even before it was officially acknowledged to have been found.2 The treaty divided the oceanic world—as seen from a European perspective—into two dominions: one belonging to the Portuguese Crown, the other to the Kingdom of Castile. When the Portuguese expedition reached the shores of Brazil in 1500, its commanders already knew that they could advance into the depths of the territory as far as 370 nautical miles from the eastern headland of the Cape Verde archipelago. The rest of the newly “discovered” continent was claimed by the Castilian Crown, with ideological discourses related to the spread of Christianity associated with the efforts of both countries.\n\nEven with regard to the very beginnings of the colonization of the South American continent, two fundamental and interrelated factors are useful in explaining the developmental differences between Portuguese and Spanish America. The first is related to the degree of complexity of the social, economic and military structure of the native populations and the societies encountered by the two colonial powers; the second is linked to the strategies of the colonial administration of the territory. While in all areas of their eventual dominion the Castilians faced civilized societies with a developed structure, the Portuguese encountered natives who in comparison had not manifested a high degree of social complexity. The Castilians were thus forced to set up a strategy that would guarantee the permanent victory of their culture over established indigenous structures and institutions. The solution chosen was the division of the colony into a series of viceroyalties which operated on a federal principle. Each of these regions enjoyed a relatively large degree of autonomy, and each was endowed with fundamental state institutions, including universities. The first conventual institution of higher education was established in Spanish America in 1538 in Santo Domingo (today, the Dominican Republic), with the first two European-style universities founded in 1551 in Peru and Mexico. During Spanish colonization, a total of 32 universities were established on the South American continent. The spread of the Spanish tertiary education was bolstered by the fact that Castile had already established twelve universities in Spain at the time of their discovery of what became the Americas, while only one had been founded in Portugal. Spain was thus able to take advantage of the opportunity to bring more highly-trained university educators and administrators to the colonies without causing serious harm to the educational institutions of the metropolis (Pereira, 2008: 55–56).\n\nThe situation in Portuguese America was quite different. Higher education institutions were scattered among the most important cities of the colony through isolated colleges. Courses were given in philosophy and theology only, with both disciplines subject to the control of the Catholic Church, still heavily influenced by Scholasticism and with curriculum based on authors such as Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas. The situation changed during what was called the Pombal period (1750–1777),3 when the spirit of the Enlightenment belatedly emerged in Portugal and the Jesuit order was banned not only in the metropolis but also in the colonies in 1759. In Brazil, the Jesuit colleges were replaced by new so-called royal institutions, the Aulas Régias, but these were as isolated and dispersed as had been the previous Jesuit schools. Only with the transfer of the Portuguese royal court to Brazil in 1808 did the new situation favor the establishment of other higher education institutions such as the Military and Naval Academies along with the Faculties of Medicine at Rio de Janeiro and Salvador. During this period, higher education followed the French model, which was focused on training in professional activities. In the case of Brazil this was mainly comprised of the education of military officers and engineers (Pereira, 2008: 60–64). Law schools followed in 1827 (Olinda and São Paulo), five years after the declaration of independence. The first university founded as a state institution dedicated to scientific research was established only in 1934 (Universidade de São Paulo).\n\nDuring the colonial period, the Portuguese Crown ensured that the Brazilian elites would study in Europe, primarily at the University of Coimbra, in order to strengthen the colony’s links to European cultural values. Yet, paradoxically, despite this extended contact with the continent during the politically and culturally tumultuous 19th century, the broad goals of the political leaders of the already independent country were not greatly affected, with pro-European tendencies prevailing in Brazilian society remaining conservative.\n\n2 Books, Libraries, Printing Houses\n\nThe cultural autonomy of any country is unthinkable without the creation of adequate cultural market infrastructure. The book market in Brazil was stimulated by the opening of its ports to international trade in 1808. Various works of many types began to flow into the country, albeit often illegally.\n\nIn colonial Brazil, books were viewed with great suspicion, often as tools of heretics and political rebels. Libraries were housed only in monasteries and religious schools. In the late 18th century, private libraries began to appear, although the importation of books unapproved by government / religious censors was clandestine and dangerous. Forbidden books found in the homes of the Minas Gerais conspirators were an aggravating factor in their criminal convictions and sentencing. Nevertheless, the very presence of heterodox books in the country and their proliferation demonstrates that they were already being traded at that time. Works by authors such as Condillac, Montesquieu, Mably, Voltaire, as well as the French Encyclopédie, were seized in the houses of the Minas Gerais conspirators. Tiradentes, the most famous promoter of the conspiracy and the subsequent independence movement, possessed a collection of the Constitutional Laws of the United States in French translation. The influence of French ideas was strong at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, with Enlightenment universalism influencing opinion especially among the Brazilian elites. Many books came from Portugal, as exemplified by the numerous copies of the French Constitution, some of the 12,000 copies of which destined for Portugal arrived in Brazil. The governmental police inspected printed material with the same zeal in the colony as in the metropolis. With the opening of the Brazilian ports, French books began to enter the country to such an extent that after only a few months, on 14 October 1808, the King issued a decree forbidding high custom officials to dispatch or allow the unloading of books or printed papers without royal permission—Desembargo do Paço. From 1809 onwards, all pamphlets and advertisements for books, whether foreign or domestic, could only be published with police permission (Sodré, 1999: 11–14).\n\nBetween 1807 and 1817, there were only four bookstores in Rio de Janeiro, establishments which according to contemporary witnesses appeared more like antiquarian sellers, offering only old translations of French and English books and a number of titles by the store’s main customers. In Recife, the situation was even worse: in 1815, there was only one bookstore in the largest city in Pernambuco, with this shop offering only religious literature. Gradually the situation improved, however, and by 1821 there were eight sellers of books to the public in Rio, although these stores did not specialize only in literature and marketed other merchandise as well. Besides the bookstores, the owners of private residences sometimes offered books both for sale and to borrow. Their customers were recruited among travelers, merchants as well as sailors. News about this kind of activity has been preserved not only in Rio de Janeiro but also, among other locations, in Minas Gerais and Pernambuco (Candido I, 2000: 219).\n\nIn 1814 the Royal Library of Rio was opened to the public. The books and other printed materials transferred there from Lisbon to Rio by Prince Regent Don João were enriched by other collections, and by 1820 it had 60,000 titles. Contemporary testimonies report that, although the library was not very up-to-date or organized, it featured a comfortable reading room and was used extensively, especially by clergymen (Candido I, 2000: 220).\n\nBased on the information available, we know that reading was not a common leisure activity at that time, although some international authors were widely known. Private libraries were full of works by d’Alembert, Buffon, Adam Smith, and Thomas Paine. Among the works of domestic authors, the poems of Tomás Antônio Gonzaga, one of the Mineiro conspirators as well as the 18th-century epic poem Caramuru by José de Santa Rita Durão were appreciated. Another widely-read work was Rousseau’s essay Du Contrat Social. The popular public loved stories set in the time of the Emperor Charlemagne (Candido I, 2000: 220).\n\nThe introduction of the printing press in colonial Brazil faced the same suspicion as had books and was perceived as a grave danger to the Empire. Before the Royal Printing House was established in Rio de Janeiro in 1808, we have references to two attempts at installing printing equipment in the country. In 1706, a small workshop was set up in Recife for the “printing of bills of exchange and pious prayers.” Despite the permission of the province governor, it was abolished by royal decree the same year; a second, more significant attempt was doomed to the same failure. The Lisbon printer Antônio Isidoro da Fonseca—again with the governor’s authorization—established a small printing shop in Rio de Janeiro with equipment he had brought from his home base in Portugal. By the time he had managed to print only a few titles the reaction of the Crown was swift: an official letter ordered the destruction by burning of the typography devices to prevent the spread of ideas that were contrary to the interests of the state (Sodré, 1999: 17).\n\nIn keeping with the orthodoxy, the first royally authorized typography workplace was established in the back of the house of one of the kingdom’s administrators who had come along with the court of the Prince Regent Dom João. The equipment was intended to serve the needs of the imperial government exclusively. On September 10, 1808, the first newspaper in Brazilian territory, the Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro, was printed. This four-page weekly contained official and officially sanctioned information and proved unattractive to the public.\n\nAt this time, other newspapers focused on the colony were appearing, but due to censorship in Brazil the most popular publication emerged from beyond Brazil’s borders, Correio Brasiliense, the first issue of which was published in London three months before the Gazeta, on June 1, 1808. Its founder, Hipólito da Costa, born in Brazil, studied at Coimbra University, but had to take refuge from Portugal to England in 1805, as he was trying to evade the Portuguese inquisition because of his Masonic ideas. When the Joanine Court settled in Rio de Janeiro, Costa decided to create a newspaper more doctrinaire than informative in his determination to help his fellow Brazilians prepare the ground for liberal institutions and otherwise raise political awareness, although the newspaper had a moralizing rather than a revolutionary focus. Typically issued in an monthly edition over a hundred pages long and relatively expensive, the format of Correio was entirely different from that of official state periodicals.\n\nThe first issues of Correio Brasiliense reached the country without the slightest problem, but by March 1809, the periodical had been banned. Despite these difficulties, copies continued to circulate, mainly in the hands of the younger generation of Brazilians. After the Liberal Revolution in Porto in 1820, the monthly was allowed to be distributed again both in the colony and in the metropolis, finally ending publication in the year independence was declared in 1822 (Sodré, 1999: 19–28). Although Costa’s initiative was openly anticolonial and in favor of Brazilian emancipation from the metropolis, the fact that the journal was printed in England was essential to its content. Costa was able to criticize Portuguese colonialism from an English perspective, thus the first Brazilian opposition newspaper was not the result of an American experience, but a reflection, a vision offered by the Old Continent. Costa’s opposition promoted the principles of the modern European state against the imperial colonial model in Brazil at the time.\n\n4 The Role of Newspapers and Magazines in the Dissemination of Literary Texts during the Brazilian Imperial Period\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, a broader reading audience emerged whose tastes and preferences began to take shape. Nevertheless, Brazilian publishers continued to print their books abroad, primarily in Portugal, France, and Germany, with book publishing in Brazil still rare in the early 20th century. As was the case on both sides of the Atlantic, the publication of literary texts was a feature of most newspapers of the time, and the Brazilian reading public was won over mainly through feuilletons inspired by the European fashion of French Romanticism (Sodré, 1999: 242–243). Thanks to their popularity with readers, short entertaining texts printed in supplements came to take up more space in newspapers and magazines, with the best works of fiction of the time serialized chapter by chapter. The Rio de Janeiro newspaper Correio Mercantil (1848–1868) published texts by Manuel Antônio de Almeida (Memórias de um sargento de milícias, 1852–1853) and Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, as well as for the feuilletons of José de Alencar, who collaborated with the magazine for a year (1854–1855). Alencar then received an offer from the Diário do Rio de Janeiro to become its editor-in-chief. In 1857 Alencar published his novel O Guarani, one of the essential Indianist works, with A Viuvinha (The Little Widow) issued three years later. In the Northeast, the weekly Semanário Maranhense was published with the collaboration of Joaquim Serra, one of the most important 19th century writers of the province of Maranhão. In São Paulo, the Revista Popular played the same role for local literature writers. Sixteen-year-old Machado de Assis, then a printer’s apprentice who enjoyed the personal protection of the renowned novelist Antônio de Almeida, made his debut in the Rio de Janeiro periodical Marmora. In 1860, de Assis, then a language proof-reader and editor of the revived Diário do Rio de Janeiro, was sent as a young reporter to cover the Senate. There he met colleagues from other editorial offices, including the renowned novelist and poet Bernardo Guimarães (Sodré, 1999: 190–192). The periodicals of the time show how closely the autonomization of literature is intertwined with public action and the steady growth of a readership.\n\nThe development of the country by the expansion of urban centers as well as the emergence of a middle class stirred up cultural life in various parts of Brazil, opening up an ever greater space for literature and journalism. In January 1870, the first republican newspaper A República was founded in Rio de Janeiro, with more than twenty periodicals of this type appearing over the next two years. A República brought together the most widely-known names in literature and the press such as Joaquim Nabuco and the aforementioned luminaries José de Alencar and Machado de Assis (Sodré, 1999: 206–214). Another periodical, Revista Brasileira, re-established and raised to a higher level of content by editor Nicolau Midosi, launched between March and December of 1880 one of the greatest novels by Machado and of Brazilian literature itself: Memórias póstumas de Brás Cubas (the first of several translations into English coming in 1952 as Epitaph of a Small Winner; in 1997 as The Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas; two major translations were issued in 2020). The reader could also find in the monthly issues of Revista Brasileira poems by Fagundes Varela later published in the collection O diário de Lázaro (1880) as well as Sílvio Romero’s Introdução à história da literatura brasileira (1881), later used as the basis for his masterpiece História da literatura brasileira (1888).\n\nDespite this undeniable cultural progress, only a tiny proportion of the population was able to read these formative works, as illiteracy persisted in Brazil in the second half of the 19th century. In 1872, for example, 84 % of the population could not read and write, and only 17 % of school-age children were enrolled in educational institutions; among women, a mere 11 % were literate (Lajolo, Zilberman, 1996, in: Coelho, Monguilhott, Severo, 2014: 41).\n\nThe conservative forces that dominated the Brazilian political scene in the 19th century had a significant impact on shaping the national literature and creating the linguistic norm of Brazilian Portuguese. This period was vital, following Pascale Casanova’s explication of how politics, language and literature are closely intertwined in newly established states undergoing the process of formation and consolidation. The connection between nation and literature is established through language, which simultaneously legitimizes both of these constitutive phenomena (Casanova, 2004: 34, 35).\n\n6 National Language: Neither Portuguese nor Brazilian\n\nIn the first documents written after the conquest of independence from Portugal, the Brazilian variety of Portuguese already appears as the National Language, the concept of which likely refers as much to the spirit of decolonization as to the image of cultivated aristocratic use. In October 1827, a law determined the principles of teaching the national language in the spirit of the “linguistic colonization” of the country (Dias, 2019: 75–94).\n\nThe first grammar published in independent Brazil was Compendio da Grammatica da Lingua Nacional by Antônio Alvarez Pedro Coruja in 1835. His Compendio is a normative grammar textbook entirely in line with the imperial decree of 1827. Loyalty to the imperial ideology is in fact confirmed in the first pages of the work by an inscription of a favorable assessment by the royal censor.\n\nOnly with Júlio Ribeiro’s 1881 work Grammatica Portuguesa does the scientific phase of Brazilian philology begin, signalling a period in which innovative tendencies prevail, sealing an adherence to historical-comparative methods. The conception is thus no longer of normative grammar, but an effort to methodically represent putative linguistic facts. Furthermore, Ribeiro applied the principle of biological evolutionism (based on the American linguist W.D. Whitney), through which he sought to achieve the scientific precision of the natural sciences in the linguistic area. Despite the attempted scientific rigor, Ribeiro’s Grammatica attracted strong criticism from traditionalists, since it was the first Brazilian publication that managed to eliminate the influence of Grammatica Geral, composed by the esteemed Portuguese linguist Jerónimo Soares Barbosa (1737–1816) (Dias, 2019: 75–94).\n\nIt is worth remembering that the Brazilian Academy of Philology was not founded until 1944 in Rio, and Nomenclatura Gramatical Brasileira (NGB) was published only in 1958."
