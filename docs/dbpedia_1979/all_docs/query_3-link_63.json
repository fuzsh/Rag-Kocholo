The FD has the lowest phlebotomine species richness of the MR (n = 29), which corresponds to 11% of the 273 registered species in Brazil. Some of these species such as Lutzomyia longipalpis, Nyssomyia whitmani and Bichromomyia flaviscutellata have been incriminated as important vectors of Leishmania species. This study updated the list of phlebotomine species in the FD by sampling sand flies in gallery forests in the area. Sand flies were captured in four areas, Água Limpa Farm (FAL), Biological Reserve of Contagem (REBIO), Brasilia’s National Park (PNB) and Botanic Garden of Brasília (JBB), in May and September, 2014. The entire capture effort entailed 1,280 HP-light trap nights and 16 Shannon trap sessions. A total of 1,209 sand flies were captured and 18 species were identified. The overall capture success was 18%, being higher in FAL (27%) and in September (20%). Most sand flies were captured in REBIO (n = 664) and in FAL (n = 472). In PNB, 64 sand flies were captured and nine were captured in JBB. The most captured species was Bi. flaviscutellata (n = 668), followed by Psathyromyia pradobarrientosi (n = 285). Nyssomyia whitmani (Leishmania brasiliensis vector) and Bi. flaviscutellata (L. amazonensis vector) were found in three gallery forests sampled. Even with the great capture effort, Lu. longipalpis was not captured, indicating that this species might be restricted to domiciliary areas in FD. Brumptomyia guimaraesi, Br. brumpti, Micropygomyia ferreirana, Pa. pradobarrientosi, Pa. campograndensis and Evandromyia bourrouli were reported for the first time in FD, expanding the known geographical distributions of these sand flies in Brazil. Pa. pradobarrientosi is reported for the first time in Brazil. Now, 35 species are registered in FD. phlebotomine species richness in FD is relevant when it is compared to Goiás (47 species), a state 59 times bigger than FD (area ~ 5.780 Km2) or even when compared to France, where there are six species registered and whose territory is about 111 times larger than FD.\n\nIdentification of host preferences from sand flies captured in endemic leishmaniasis regions of Ecuador\n\nEstefanía Palacios1, Estefanía Espinosa1, Gabriela Vela1, Denis Augot2, Jérôme Depaquit2, Sonia Zapata1\n\n1Instituto de Microbiología, Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Ecuador\n\n2Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, ANSES, EA4688 – USC « Transmission Vectorielle et Épidémiosurveillance de Maladies Parasitaires (VECPAR) », Reims, France\n\nszapata@usfq.edu.ec\n\nLeishmaniasis is endemic in 22 of 24 Ecuadorian provinces. The disease is only recorded under its tegumentary form (cutaneous and mucocutaneous). Some wild animals play a crucial role in parasite transmission. However, a few reservoirs only have been identified in the past. Entomological collections were performed between 2012 and 2015 in five provinces of the northern part of the country where leishmaniasis is endemic (Bolívar, Esmeraldas, Orellana, Manabí and Pichincha). A total of 3,103 specimens were collected, of which 7.7% were engorged females. Ten species were collected in total including known Leishmania vectors. Amplification of the PNOC nuclear gene was performed to identify the source of blood meals from 50 specimens. The host preferences of sandflies are: Choloepus hoffmanii, Choloepus hoffmani, Potos flavus, Bos taurus, Pecari tajacu, Capra hircus, Equus caballus, Cebus capucinus, Tapirus terrestris and Homo sapiens. Of these, the first two had already been reported as reservoirs, while Cebus capucinus is suspected to be a reservoir of Leishmania. Moreover, we found anthropophylic behavior of two sand flies species in the Amazonia basin which are not related with Leishmania transmission. This study contributes to the understanding of the transmission cycle of Leishmania and identifying potential new sites of transmission due to the presence of vectors, reservoirs and humans.\n\nDiversity of phlebotomine sand fly assemblage in a tropical forest of southern Mexico\n\nJorge J.

The main aim of this study was to estimate the diversity of phlebotomine sand flies in an endemic focus of cutaneous leishmaniasis in southern Mexico. Field work was carried out in a tropical forest (18°59′46″ N, 088°09′27″ W; 19 m above sea level) from August 2013 to July 2014. Sampling was conducted during three consecutive nights per month. In each trapping night, 48 traps were operated from 1800 to 2400 h. The traps were CDC light traps (incandescent and LEDs colors white, blue, red and green), as well as Disney traps, Shannon traps, Sticky traps and Delta traps. Collection of sand flies were carried out in four transects, using each transect as a randomized block design. Specimens were prepared for permanent slide mounting using Euparal® and subsequent identification was accomplished using different morphological structures described in taxonomic papers. Measures of alpha community diversity were based on the quantification of the number of species (species richness) and the community structure as well as the dominance and evenness. To evaluate the number of species present in the area, we used the estimators Chao 2, Jacknife 2 and the equation of Clench. Heterogeneity was calculated with Shannon’s entropy index and true diversity. Dominance was evaluated by Simpson and Berger-Parker, and also evenness index and Margalef index were evaluated as well. With a total capture effort of 1,728 night-traps, 16,101 phlebotomine sand flies were collected, representing two genera and 13 species. The most abundant species were Lu. cruciata (Coquillett) (42.33%), Lu. shannoni (Dyar) (32.68%), Brumptomyia mesai (Sherlock) (9.75%) and Lu. ovallesi (Ortíz) (9.03%). Less abundant species were Lu. carpenteri (Fairchild and Hertig), Lu. cayennensis maciasi (Fairchild and Hertig), Lu. cratifer (Fairchild and Hertig), Lu. deleoni (Fairchild and Hertig), Lu. olmeca olmeca (Vargas and Díaz-Nájera), Lu. permira (Fairchild and Hertig), Lu. steatopyga (Fairchild and Hertig), Lu. trinidadensis (Newstead) and Lu. sp., which altogether accounted for only 5.66% of the total. Two species were observed (Lu. permira and Lu. sp) as “doubletons”. According to diversity estimates, 100% (Chao 2) and 85% (Jacknife2) of potential species in the study area were calculated. Species accumulation curves using Clench’s equation, presented a good fit to the predictive model (a = 4.47, b = 0.34, r 2 = 0.966, slope = 0.001) with 13 species, representing 100% of the species observed. Alpha diversity shows that Shannon entropy and true diversity were: H′ = 1.42 and 1D = 4.14 respectively, whereas the Simpson dominance index was λ = 0.31 and Berger-Parker d = 0.42, while equitativity index was J = 0.56 and Margalef index was D Mg = 1.24. Four species of medical importance, namely Lu. cruciata, Lu. shannoni, Lu. ovallesi and Lu. olmeca olmeca were collected and represented 85.81% of the total. This inventory of phlebotomine sand flies is an important activity to enhance our knowledge of sand fly assemblages and guilds. The understanding of the population dynamics of sand flies could be an important factor for the implementation of strategies for epidemic control of these insect-borne diseases.\n\nPhlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) of Texas, United States\n\nStavana E.

The diversity of sand flies and the presence of leishmaniasis suggest that Texas is an especially important region to survey. Four of the species found in the United States may be potential vectors of leishmaniasis and three of these species have been documented within Texas. The recent spread of cutaneous leishmaniasis into northern portions of Texas and Oklahoma has increased the importance of documenting sand fly distributions. While it is important to document species’ ranges for biodiversity purposes, it is even more pressing now that human health risks have increased. Most surveys have been conducted in southern and central portions of Texas near historic cutaneous leishmaniasis foci. We surveyed 86 sites across the state and found at least four different genera (Dampfomyia, Lutzomyia, Micropygomyia, and Psathyromyia). Of these genera, seven species were tentatively identified with some species identification remaining ambiguous.\n\nEU-ECDC/EFSA VectorNet Project: Distribution of sand fly species (Diptera: Psychodidae), community analysis and pathogen detection in Balkans\n\nVit Dvorak1, Ozge Erisoz Kasap2, Gizem Oguz2, Nazli Ayhan3, S.

This study shows some of the results and achievements of the sand fly-team efforts in eight Balkan countries in 2015 in the framework of the VectorNet Project. Eight countries (Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Serbia, Kosovo, Slovenia), including 267 locations and 36 cities were studied by the sand fly team with the aim of determining the altitudinal and trans-sectional distribution of species, identifying species and detecting possible pathogens in the Balkans. Sand flies were collected with light traps for a total of 951 trap nights during the field missions. From this study, 12 species were identified and a total of 9,096 specimens collected from fieldwork. The results show that Phlebotomus neglectus (74%) is the dominant species in Balkan countries and this species was collected from all eight countries together with Ph. tobbi (10%). These two species comprise 84% of total sand fly abundance. Other species include: Ph. perfiliewi s.l (6.13%), Sergentomyia minuta (3.56%), Ph. perniciosus (1.57%), Ph. papatasi (1.35%), Ph. simici (0.9%), Ph. mascitti (0.45%), Ph. sergenti (0.1%), Ph. alexandri (0.07%), and Ph. balcanicus (0.03%) (found only in Montenegro). We also calculated some of the important community parameters such as similarity, richness, species diversity, species evenness and dominance for each country. The most similar countries in terms of species composition are B&H-Kosovo (0.77), Bulgaria-Kosovo (0.85), Serbia-Kosovo (0.86), Croatia-Macedonia (0.80) and Bulgaria-Macedonia (0.80). From these results, it appears that Macedonia and Serbia are ecotones (transition areas) in the Balkans. The highest species diversities were observed in Macedonia (1.366), Bulgaria (1.247) and Serbia (1.169), respectively. The lowest was B&H with 0.386 values. In contrast, B&H, like other less diverse countries, has the highest dominance value (81.4%). In pathogen detection studies, two novel viruses in B&H and Macedonia and Leishmania infantum parasites in B&H, Macedonia and Kosovo were detected. To the best of our knowledge, most of the information derived from this study was new to the Balkan countries.\n\nFirst data on sand fly presence in Slovenia\n\nAlexandra Popovič, Eva Praprotnik, Vladimir Ivović\n\nFaculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Information Technologies, University of Primorska, Slovenia\n\nvladimir.ivovic@famnit.upr.si\n\nDistribution of phlebotomine sand flies around Mediterranean basin is mostly well investigated and documented. Nevertheless, there are some regions where fauna of these, medically very important insects was studied many years ago or never. Slovenia is one of the smallest member countries of EU sited on the south of Austria and on the east of Italy but despite its small size it has very heterogeneous relief. The northern part of the country is composed of alpine and the southern part of Mediterranean and Karst landscape. Being the bridge between eastern and western part of the Northern Mediterranean, this region hosts unknown sand fly species and these are the first faunistic data. In order to evaluate Slovenia as a potential leishmaniasis endemic region we investigated presence of the disease vectors, particularly in the coastal part of the country. During the high season 2015, 565 specimens were collected and five species identified. Ph. neglectus and Ph. perniciosus, well known and proven vectors of L. infantum in the Mediterranean, were the most abundant (76% and 16% respectively). Ph. papatasi and Ph. mascitti, known and potential vectors of several phleboviruses and Leishmania parasites, were also present but in smaller numbers (3% and 4.8%). Medically not important species Sergentomyia minuta was also recorded (0.2%). During the study period the peak of sand fly abundance was in the beginning of July, gradually decreasing towards the end of August. It was expected to find all of recorded sand fly species and the biggest surprise was relatively high abundance of Ph. mascitti evenly present in all collection sites and always close to animal shelters.\n\nDistribution and travel distance of Phlebotomus papatasi (Diptera: Psychodidae) in a zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis focus, the Northern Negev, Israel\n\nLaor Orshan1, Shirly Elbaz1, Yossi Ben-Ari2\n\n1Laboratory of Entomology, Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel\n\n2Israel Nature and Parks Authority, Jerusalem, Israel\n\nLaor.Orshan@MOH.health.gov.iI\n\nIn recent years, endemic transmission of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) has spread to new regions in Israel. In the southern part of the country, the new foci of ZCL caused by Leishmania major are located in the cultivated plains of the northwestern Negev. The agricultural pest Meriones tristrami, the main reservoir animal in this area, is very common as well as Phlebotomus papatasi, the only known vector species of L. major in Israel. A sand fly study was conducted in the summer of 2013 in and around a small cooperative community. The aim was to understand from where and how far away sand flies reach the residential area. Sand flies were collected from 55 sites in four categories of land use using CO2-baited modified CDC light traps. To study the flight distances sand flies were marked in the field by spraying the vegetation in five sites with sugar solutions containing different food dyes. The catch was counted, identified, Leishmania DNA was detected in pooled female samples and the presence of marked specimens was noted. Sand flies were abundant throughout the long summer, showing one seasonal peak in the warmest months August and September. L. major DNA was detected throughout the season except in June in 30/55 sites sampled. Infection rates increased towards the end of the season and the estimated risk of exposure was highest in September. Sand fly densities were low in the residential area and very high in the surrounding agricultural fields. The maximum dispersal distances were 1.91 km for females and 1.53 km for males. The maximum range recorded for females was limited by the distances between the marking sites and the most distant trap. The calculated mean distance traveled indicating the typical dispersal distances of the population was 0.75 km. The overall results indicated the existence of dense and mobile sand fly populations. In the agricultural fields there seemed to be numerous development sources and suitable resting sites for sand flies scattered over large areas. Sand flies apparently moved in all directions. Typically, Leishmania-infected Ph. papatasi females probably could reach the residential area from distances greater than 0.75 km.\n\nPhlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in Morocco: Results of entomological surveys in five regions of Morocco, Marrakech, Al Haouz-Immintanoute, Tlat Hanchan, and Had Dra\n\nMohamed Echchakery1, Fouad Ouanaimi1, Samia Boussaa1,2, Ali Boumezzough1\n\n1Équipe Écologie Animale et Environnement-Lab L2E (URAC 32), Université Cadi Ayyad, Faculté des Sciences Semlalia, Marrakech, Morocco\n\n2I SPITS-Institut Supérieur des Professions Infirmières et des Techniques de Santé, Marrakech, Morocco\n\nmohamedechchakery@gmail.com\n\nIn Morocco, 23 species have been described, which belong into two genera (14 of the genus Phlebotomus and nine of genus Sergentomyia). Only five species are involved in the transmission of leishmaniasis in Morocco: Phlebotomus papatasi vector of Leishmania major, Ph. sergenti vector of L. tropica; Ph. ariasi vector of L. infantum and Ph. longicuspis, Ph. perniciosus, potential vectors of L. infantum. Cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) due to L. tropica have gradually increased in the towns of Al Haouz, Chichaoua (Imintanoute), Essaouira (Tlat Hanchan-Had Dra) tropica. The objectives of this research were to inventory the phlebotomine sand flies species, and to identify the environmental factors that influence the abundance of species in different locations. Sand flies were captured with CDC light traps and sticky traps (castor-oil paper traps) placed at intradomicilary and peridomicilary sites for one night (18:00 h until 06:00 h) every 15 days, from May 2014 to June 2015. A total of 1,678 individuals were captured: 260 in Marrakech, 320 in Al Haouz, 380 in Imintanoute, 435 Tlat Hanchan and 283 in Had Dra. Relative abundance of species was as follows: In Marrakech, Ph. papatasi (40.3%), Ph. sergenti (17.7%), Se. fallax (12.9%), Se. minuta (22.6%) and Ph. longicuspis (6.5%). In Al Haouz, Ph. papatasi (26.90%), Ph. sergenti (46.36%), Ph. perniciosus (2.43%), Ph. longicuspis (4.3%), Ph. alexandri (1.3%), Se. fallax (9.3%), Se. minuta (6.2%), Sergentomyia dreyfussi (3.12%). In Imintanoute, Ph. sergenti (56.40%), Ph. longicuspis (9.71%), Ph. ariasi (6.48%), Ph. papatasi (15.42%), Ph. perniciosus (0.85%), Ph. alexandri (2.36%), Se. fallax (2.12%), Se. minuta (6.30%), Se. dreyfussi (0.36%). In Tlat Hanchan, Ph. sergenti (62.40%), Ph. longicuspis (12.60%), Ph. alexandri (4.54%), Ph. perniciosus (6.72%), Ph. kazeruni (0.26%), Ph. langeroni (0.36%), Ph. bergeroti (0.16%), Se. minuta (6.6%), Se. antennata (6.36%). In Had Dra, Ph. sergenti (70.6%), Ph. longicuspis (11.6%), Ph. alexandri (5.6%), Ph. perniciosus (6.16%), Ph. langeroni (0.12%), Ph. bergeroti (0.13%), Se. minuta (7.6%), Se. antennata (5.22%). The abundance of species varied significantly. Sand fly population densities were highest in summer followed by fall, spring and winter. The eco-epidemiological scenarios in our endemic foci are associated with the presence of domestic mammals and poultry, sources of blood for sand flies which sustains the vector population and the risk of infection by Leishmania, The proximity of livestock manure, and cattle and sheep sheds to houses and Climatic conditions including rainfall, light, temperature, relative humidity, and air movement, are very important factors influencing the abundance of sand flies in endemic foci.\n\nFirst Phlebotominae in Botswana\n\nAndreas Krüger\n\nMilitary Hospital Hamburg, Dept. Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany, and Okavango Research Institute, Maun, Botswana\n\nkrueger@bnitm.de\n\nRegarding the distribution of phlebotomine sandflies in the Afrotropical region Botswana (southern Africa) appeared as a blank spot on the map, although there are several reports from the surrounding countries, namely South Africa, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The lack of data was probably due to the non-endemicity of leishmaniasis in this country. In a pilot vector survey with a CDC light trap, carried out during the wet season 2014–15 in Maun, northern Botswana, 41 sand fly specimens, belonging to four species, were detected: Sergentomyia (Grassomyia) inermis and Se. (Sergentomyia) “bedfordi group”. The latter comprised of specimens of Se. (Ser.) congolensis, Se. (Ser.) caliginosa, and Se. (Ser.) salisburiensis. None of these species are known vectors of human leishmaniasis parasites. Regarding the habitat, trap catches were all done beside a termite hill at a fan height of 50 cm, about 10–200 m off Thamalakane river. Sergentomyia inermis is a new record for the entire southern African fauna, and it remains to be confirmed whether older record of the closely related Se. squamipleuris from South Africa are correct. Molecular taxonomic analyses are underway to further characterize the taxa.\n\nUncharted phlebotomine sand flies in Gabon\n\nNil Rahola1,2, Judicael Obame2, Boris Makanga2, Diego Ayala1,2, Jérôme Depaquit3, Christophe Paupy1\n\n1Unité MIVEGEC, UMR 224-5290 IRD-CNRS-UM, Centre IRD de Montpellier, BP 64501, 34394 Montpellier, France\n\n2Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville (CIRMF), BP 769, Franceville, Gabon\n\n3Université de Reims Champagne Ardenne, ANSES, SFR Cap santé, EA 4688-USC « Transmission Vectorielle et Épidémiosurveillance de Maladies Parasitaires (VECPAR) », Reims, France\n\nnil.rahola@ird.fr\n\nDespite the former mention of an autochthonous case of visceral leishmaniasis, Gabon does not currently constitute an endemic country for this disease. As a result, the sand fly fauna in this country remains poorly documented and prospected. An exhaustive review of literature reports only four species in Gabon. Since 2012 we have managed to collect more than 10,000 sand flies through a large mosquito survey that consisted in 1850 CDC-miniature light traps installed in two different forest sites and 700 CDC-miniature light traps installed in two different caves. Over 2,000 specimens were collected in forest sites and 8,000 in caves. In addition, some collections were performed using other CDC-miniature light traps in anthropic environments such as small savannahs villages, forest villages and towns. These collections allowed us to expand the current checklist of phlebotomine sand flies of Gabon from four to 25 species, with already at least one species new to science (and two others being described). The forest had the highest species diversity and allowed us to discover and describe a new species of Phlebotomus with a quite singular morphology (Phlebotomus (Legeromyia) multihamatus) and also the unknown male of Spelaeomyia moucheti. This discovery led us to perform a molecular analysis of the whole genus Spelaeomyia. On the other hand, in caves, sand flies were very abundant but of low diversity. With these new collections we will be able to bring new morphological data, make some re-descriptions of some specimens such as the female of Sa. moucheti or Sergentomyia lumsdeni, but also to consider the possibility of the creation of a new subgenus of the genus Sergentomyia. This update of the phlebotomine sand flies of Gabon encourages further surveillance in this country. Even if only one case of leishmaniasis has been reported in Gabon, the role of sand flies in the transmission of such parasites or other infectious agents, as well as their trophic preferences, should be evaluated.\n\nInventories, ecology and ethology (posters)\n\nEcological niche modelling of Phlebotominae sand flies and the relation to the distribution of cutaneous leishmaniasis in an endemic region of South-Eastern Brazil\n\nBlima Fux1, Viviane Coutinho Meneguzzi1, Claudiney Biral dos Santos2, Carina Margonari3, Gustavo Rocha Leite1, Aloísio Falqueto1\n\n1Unidade de Medicina Tropical da Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo.

The State of Espírito Santo (ES), an endemic area in the Southeast of Brazil, has shown considerably high sand fly prevalence in recent decades, allowing the spread of the disease to unaffected areas. Computer tools, such as ecologic niche modelling (ENM), are useful for predicting potential disease risk. In this study, ENM was applied to species of sand flies and CL cases in ES to identify the principal vector and risk areas of the disease, aiming to understand the early origin and spread of this disease. Sand flies were collected in 466 rural localities between 1997 and 2013 during the three hours after evening twilight using a combination of active and passive capture. Insects were identified to the species level, and the localities were georeferenced. All autochthonous cases of CL treated at the University Hospital Cassiano Antonio Moraes (HUCAM) between 1978 and 2013 were evaluated. Twenty-one climate databases were selected from WorldClim. Maxent was used to construct potential distribution models for Lu. intermedia, Lu. whitmani, Lu. migonei, Lu. lenti, Lu. choti and CL cases. ENMTools was used to overlap the species and the CL case models. The Kruskal-Wallis and qui-quadrado tests were performed, adopting a 5% significance level. The 249,783 specimens captured represented 43 species. Of the 1,423 autochthonous cases recorded, 10.8% presented mucosal lesions. The area under the curve (AUC) was considered acceptable for Lu. intermedia, Lu. whitmani, Lu. migonei, Lu. lenti, Lu. choti and the CL cases. Topography was considered relevant to the construction of the models for all the species identified. Lutzomyia intermedia and Lu. migonei showed relevance with some variables, such as topography, BIO13, BIO12, and altitude. In order, variables such as topography, BIO13, and BIO15 were important to L. lenti and L. whitmani. For L. choti, topography, BIO4, BIO18, BIO17, and altitude presented as relevant variables. The overlay test identified Lu. intermedia as the main vector of CL in the study area. There is evidence of the existence of a primitive wild cycle of LTA in Atlantic forest areas in southeastern Brazil. It is possible that L. braziliensis has been transferred from the Amazon region to the Atlantic forest areas, for thousands of years through forest corridors linking the two biomes. There were differences between the contagion regions of patients, indicating that there was CL expansion to the east of ES, possibly caused by the intensification of migration to the urban center. Spatial modelling tools enable an analysis of the association among environmental variables, vector distributions, and CL cases in ES. Further, they allow better understanding of the factors related to the CL geographical spread in colonized areas of the Southeast of Brazil.\n\nFirst recording of Sciopemyia vattierae (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) in the State of Acre, Southeast of the Brazilian Amazon\n\nMárcia Moreira de Ávila1, Andreia Fernandes Brilhante2, Eunice Aparecida Bianchi Galati2, Reginaldo Peçanha Brazil3\n\n1Instituto Federal do Acre (IFAC), Brasil\n\n2Faculdade de Saúde Pública da Universidade de São Paulo, Brasil\n\n3Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Brasil\n\nmarcia.avila@ifac.edu.br\n\nSand flies (Diptera, Psychodidae, Phlebotominae) of various species are implicated in the transmission of Leishmania protozoans to humans and other vertebrates. Currently, 85 sand fly species representing several genera are known to occur in the Brazilian state of Acre. In this study, the occurrence of Sciopemyia vattierae (Le Pont & Desjeux, 1992), heretofore restricted to Peru (PE), Colombia and Bolivia, is reported in Brazil. During collections undertaken with CDC-light traps from December 2014 to January 2016 in forest and peridomilary areas of a rural settlement and in forested areas of an urban park located in the city of Rio Branco, Acre, three males and five females of Sc. vattierae were collected. The presence of papillae on flagellomere III distinguishes Sc. vattierae and Sciopemyia sordellii from the other species of the genus, in which the papillae are absent. The distinction of males of these two species was based on morphometric characters (lengths of FI and aedeagal ducts) and morphological characteristics were used to distinguish the females (In Sc. vattierae, the terminal knob clearly separated from the spermatheca and whereas it is sessil in Sc. sordellii). Thus, with this finding the geographical distribution of Sc. vattiearae in South America and the number of species of sand flies in Acre state are enlarged.\n\nSand fly fauna (Diptera: Psychodidae) in an endemic area of American cutaneous leishmaniasis of Brazilian Amazon\n\nMárcia Moreira de Ávila1, Andreia Fernandes Brilhante2, Eunice Aparecida Bianchi Galati2, Reginaldo Peçanha Brazil3\n\n1Instituto Federal do Acre (IFAC), Brasil\n\n2Faculdade de Saúde Pública da Universidade de São Paulo, Brasil\n\n3Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Brasil\n\nmarcia.avila@ifac.edu.br\n\nCutaneous leishmaniasis is a zoonosis with wide geographic distribution and with different Leishmania species as etiological agents. As in most states of the Brazilian Amazon regions, the emergence of the disease in Acre seems to be related to anthropic actions and human occupation. This study aimed to identify the sand fly fauna in Rio Branco, capital of the state of Acre, Brazil. The sand flies were captured in a rural area and in an urban park of the municipality using light traps (CDC-type) once a month, from December 2014 to January 2016. We collected a total 2,210 sand flies belonging to 13 genera and 37 species. The most frequent was Trichophoromyia auraensis (43.2%) followed in descending or by Trichophoromyia sp. (27.4%), Pressatia calcarata (7.3%), Pressatia sp. (4.1%), Evandromyia saulensis (6.1%), Ev. walkeri (3.9%), Psychodopygus carrerai carrerai (3.6%), Bichromomyia flaviscutellata (2.7%), Nyssomyia whitmani (1.6%) and Migonemyia migonei (0.1%). Of the species found in Rio Branco, three are known vectors of Leishmania in the Amazon region: Ny. whitmani, Bi. flaviscutellata and Mg. migonei. The results show that the sand fly fauna is diverse and includes incriminated and proven vectors of Leishmania. This information will be of use to the epidemiological surveillance team of the Rio Branco municipality in establishing control actions in the urban and rural areas where there are reported leishmaniasis cases.\n\nEnvironmental factors and the occurrence of Nyssomyia whitmani and Lutzomyia cruzi in the Brazilian Central West\n\nWagner de Souza Fernandes1, Anny Keli Aparecida Alves Cândido2, Leandro Machado Borges1, Aline Etelvina Casaril1,3, Jucelei de Oliveira Moura Infran3, Elisa Teruya Oshiro3, Suellem Petilim Gomes1, Antônio Conceição Paranhos Filho2, Eliane de Mattos Piranda3, Alessandra Gutierrez de Oliveira1,3\n\n1Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Postgraduate Program in Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil\n\n2Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Geoprocessing Laboratory for Environmental Applications, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil\n\n3Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Laboratory of Parasitology/CCBS, MS, Brazil\n\nalessandra.oliveira@ufms.br\n\nBiological and ecological relationships between vectors and their pathogens are important for understanding the epidemiology of vector transmission disease. Some sand flies species are vectors of Leishmania, among of them, Lutzomyia cruzi and Nyssomyia whitmani incriminated as vectors of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum and Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, respectively. The municipality of Camapuã (Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil) is considered an endemic area for visceral and tegumentary leishmaniasis. We related, descriptively, the phytophysiognomy of ecotopes and the presence of Lu. cruzi and Ny. whitmani in Camapuã. A total of 24 captures were carried out, bimonthly, using Falcão automatic light traps intra and peridomicile, from May 2014 to April 2015. We calculated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from images obtained by LANDSAT 8. These images were classified according to the NDVI as follows, water (−1.00/+0.00), exposed soil (+0.00/+0.30), pothole vegetation (+0.30/+0.50), savannah (+0.50/+0.60) and forest (+0.60/+1.00). In total, 2,005 sand flies from nine species were collected. Nyssomyia whitmani (55.3%) and Lu. cruzi (41.3%) were the most representative among all collected species. Nyssomyia whitmani predominated in periurban neighborhoods. In these areas, the NDVI average values were higher than 0.50, demonstrating the presence of dense vegetation surrounding dwellings, consequently, the capture sites were shaded and there was considerable amount of organic matter in the soil. Lutzomyia cruzi was more frequent in urban neighborhoods, with NDVI average values below 0.50. We observed the preference of Ny. whitmani for preserved areas while Lu. cruzi was more commonly found in urban areas.\n\nFinancial support: FUNDECT and CAPES.\n\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the characterization of sand flies environments\n\nHelen Rezende de Figueiredo1, Anny Keli Aparecida Alves Cândido2, César Claudio Cáceres Encina2, Everton Falcão de Oliveira2, Jaíza Santos Motta2, Jucelei de Oliveira Infran3, Aline Etelvina Casaril1,3, Elisa Teruya Oshiro3, Antonio Conceição Paranhos Filho2, Alessandra Gutierrez de Oliveira1,3\n\n1Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Postgraduate Program in Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil\n\n2Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Geoprocessing Laboratory for Environmental Applications, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil\n\n3Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Laboratory of Parasitology/CCBS, MS, Brazil\n\nalessandra.oliveira@ufms.br\n\nThe biology and ecology of sand flies can suffer environmental influences as well as its interaction with vertebrate hosts in a particular breeding site. In Brazil, the State of Mato Grosso do Sul has lost native vegetation due to intense urbanization and this change has modified the habitat of sand flies and consequently the epidemiology of leishmaniasis. We characterized the environments of the urbanized area of Aquidauana (MS) associating land cover changes to the frequency of sand flies. Every fifteen days, 48 captures were carried out in intra and peridomicile areas with automatic light traps, from April 2012 to March 2014. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained from Landsat 5 and 8 to define types of vegetation in the collection sites and their surroundings. It was collected a total of 3,179 specimens in 10 species. Lutzomyia longipalpis presented 93.02% of the total, followed by Evandromyia walkeri (4.25%) and other species 2.74%. Lutzomyia longipalpis was observed in all months and collection sites including areas with higher degrees of anthropization. The NDVI was efficient to characterize the environments. It was possible to observe the relationship between the amount of phytomass by NDVI and frequency, abundance, distribution and diversity of sand flies.\n\nFinancial support: FUNDECT and CAPES.\n\nPreliminary information on insular sand flies, in Paraná River, Brazil\n\nBarbara Andreo dos Santos1, Kárin Rosi Reinhold-Castro1, Herintha Coeto Neitzke-Abreu2, Edilson Colhera Cristóvão3, Thaís Gomes Versignassi Silveira1, Ueslei Teodoro1\n\n1Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciências da Saúde, Universidade Estadual de Maringá, Brasil\n\n2Faculdade de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade Federal da Grande Dourados, Brazil\n\n3Secretaria Municipal de Saúde de Porto Rico, Núcleo de Entomologia, Brasil\n\nkarindecastro@yahoo.com.br\n\nLeishmaniasis is a neglected disease with worldwide distribution, caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania; which is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected female phlebotomine sand flies. Nowadays, 988 species of sand flies have been described. American species comprise 529 of these (512 contemporary and 17 fossils). In Brazil, 19 species are suspected or implicated in the transmission of Leishmania to humans. Among these, the most common are Nyssomyia neivai (Pinto), Migonemyia migonei (França), Ny. whitmani (Antunes & Coutinho), Pintomyia pessoai (Coutinho & Barreto) and Pi. fischeri (Pinto). The aim of this study was to gain preliminary knowledge of these insects on some islands in the Paraná River that belong to municipalities of Porto Rico, Querência do Norte, and São Pedro do Paraná, Paraná State, Brazil. Sand fly collections were made with Falcão light traps in the edges of and within forests, domestic animal shelters, and domiciles. The collections on Bandeira, Carioca and Fina Islands were conducted in June, August and October 2012; on Mutum Island, from October 2013 to October 2014; on Japonesa and São José Catarino Islands, from November 2013 and January, June, and September 2014; on Floresta Island, in December 2013, January, June, and September 2014; on Chapéu Velho Island, in December 2013, January, April, and June 2014. In Cruzeiro Island, in January, June, September, and October 2014; on Santa Rosa Island, in December 2013, January, April, and August 2014. On Mutum Island, which has a large number of permanent residents, the collections were conducted during one night each month, from 18:00 to 6:00 h, during 13 months. On the other islands, with smaller numbers of residents, one night’s collection during each season (fall, winter, spring, and summer), from 19:00 to 7:00 h, during one year. The sand flies collected were sacrificed with chloroform and placed in tubes containing 80% alcohol for their preservation and subsequent identification. A total of 55,761 sand flies were collected. In 2012, collections included 19,818 specimens of Ny. neivai were collected, (16,746 females and 3,072 males), and two females of Ny. whitmani and a female Psathyromyia shannoni (Dyar). In 2013 and 2014, 35,943 specimens of Ny. neivai were collected (31,414 females and 4,529 males) and one Brumptomyia brumpti (Larrousse). Ny. neivai was the predominant species, accounting for 99.9% of the collected specimens. A previous study also reported the capture of Br. cunhai (Mangabeira). In the inhabited islands, a large number of insects were collected in domestic animal shelters, which are close to domiciles. The presence of these animals insures blood sources, which sustain sand fly growth and density in these ecotypes, increasing the risk for locals and tourists who frequent the islands. The small number of species collected in relation to the 49 described in the Paraná state may be due to the isolation of the islands and the inability of other species to adapt to the insular environment. Ny. neivai is a proven vector of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and also the dominant species in the studied islands and the most common in all ecotypes, especially in domestic animal shelters and human domiciles. The capacity of a vector to transmit pathogens is related to its density. Thus, our results indicate the necessity of strategies to reduce human-vector contact.\n\nFinancial support: Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES).\n\nEntomological surveillance in Leishmania transmission areas on the border between Brazil and Bolivia\n\nElizabeth F.

In Brazil, American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) is registered in all states and American Visceral Leishmaniasis (AVL) in most of them, both with significant impact on human health. Bolivia records leishmaniasis in six of its nine departments. In the valley of “Yungas”, cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis are public health issues, with 20% prevalence. The AVL, rare in the Andean countries, has been recorded in Bolivia with ten sporadic cases to date. Few studies have been conducted in relation to the Leishmania vectors in Bolivia, including border areas with Brazil. The study aimed to identify the species of sand fly vectors on the Brazil-Bolivia border; to know the spatial distribution associated with the environment and risk factors for transmission. Monitoring stations were established (MS) on both sides. In Brazil, in Corumbá (AVL – intense transmission area), for each MS, traps were set in peridomicilary sites (animal shelters) and in sites next to the forest. Captures (October and November/2015) were done with CDC light traps installed in areas surrounding houses and close to forest, and operated for 12 h from the start of the evening, for four consecutive nights. Six MS were set in a military field, in the main access to Bolivia (City of Arroyo Concepción), next to the main bridge that has a large flow of people, animals and vehicles. Four MS were located on small farms, one just a kilometer from the border. In Bolivia, in the city Arroyo Concepción, Department of Santa Cruz, the only MS studied was the one close to MS6 (in Brazil), using the same methodology, with two nights of captures. At this site, CDC light traps were installed in October close to a small river and in a henhouse; and in November only near the river. The methods for taxonomic identification follow the proposal by Galati (2003). Preliminary results from 120 h of captures in Brazil and 36 h in Bolivia include twelve identified sand fly species: Brumptomyia brumpti, Evandromyia aldafalcaoae, Ev. corumbaensis, Ev. sallesi, Lutzomyia cruzi, Micropygomyia peresi, Psathyromyia aragaoi, Pa. bigeniculata, Pa. dendrophyla, Pa. punctigeniculata and Sciopemyia sordellii, totaling 1,394 specimens from Brazil; and Br. brumpti, Ev. corumbaensis, Lu. cruzi, Mi. peresi and Mi. quinquefer, totaling 22 specimens from Bolivia. Noteworthy is the predominance of Lu. cruzi in all MS, including the home environment. Lutzomyia cruzi is the vector of AVL in endemic areas in the Central Region of Brazil. Possibly there is no geographical barrier to sand fly dispersion across the border between the two countries, may explain the record of Lu. cruzi on the Bolivian side. It is of particular interest that to date, the Lu. longipalpis appears to be absent at the monitoring stations in both Brazil and Bolivia, suggesting that Lu. cruzi is participating in the AVL transmission in Bolivia, as it is in Brazil.\n\nFinancial support: Small Grant Programme Tropical Diseases Research/Pan American Health Organization 2015.

Parasites of this genus are transmitted to humans by the bites of phlebotomine sand flies. In Panama, vector species that exhibit the highest degree of anthropophily and relevance in the transmission of Leishmania in Panama include Lutzomyia panamensis, Lu. trapidoi and Lu. ylephiletor. Knowledge of preferences in their hematophagy can provide indirect information on potential reservoir hosts and facilitate better understanding of leishmaniasis ecology under natural conditions. For this, molecular techniques involving the amplification of a region of cytochrome b to were use to identify mammalian and avian sources of blood meals in midguts of relevant Lutzomyia species to determine blood-feeding preferences. An analysis was applied by simple correspondence resulting in a χ2: 57.24, df: 18, p < 0.05. It was observed that Lu. trapidoi and Lu. panamensis prefer to feed on humans and swine, while Lu. ylephiletor shows a preference for dogs or other mammals in general. This preliminary information helps clarify ecological aspects Leishmania transmission in perdomicilary hábitats, providing valuable knowledge for prevention of leishmaniasis.\n\nWhy sand fly samplings of a single night are insufficient? An analysis in an urban area of northeast Argentina based on light traps\n\nMaria Soledad Santini1, Maria Soledad Fernández2, Maria Gabriela Quintana3,4, Regino Cavia2, Oscar Daniel Salomón4\n\n1Centro Nacional de Diagnóstico e Investigación en Endemo-epidemias (CeNDIE), ANLIS, Ministerio de Salud de la Nación, Buenos Aires, and Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Argentina\n\n2Dto. de Ecología, Genética y Evolución, FCEN, UBA and Instituto de Ecología, Genética y Evolución de Buenos Aires (UBA-CONICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n3Instituto Superior de Entomología (INSUE-UNT), Tucumán, and CONICET, Argentina\n\n4Instituto Nacional de Medicina Tropical (INMeT), Ministerio de Salud de la Nación, Puerto Iguazú, Misiones, and CONICET, Argentina\n\nmariasoledadsantini@gmail.com; msantini@anlis.gov.ar\n\nIn recent years, in Argentina, entomological surveys to study the occurrence and abundance of sand flies of epidemiological interest have become more frequent. Indicators of infestation levels, as the proportion of sampled sites where a particular sand fly species occurs, or its abundance, were usually estimated, as well as other community characteristics, such as the number of species present (richness). Some of these surveys cover large areas, so the number of nights that lights traps remains active, as well as the total number of light traps, has a cost in relation to human and material resources. The aim of this work was to study how the estimation of the proportion of sampled sites where a particular species occurred, the species abundances – trap success – and the richness changed when the light traps remained active for more than one night. We analyzed data from four entomological surveys conducted in the city of Puerto Iguazú, northeastern Argentina (summer 2011, fall and winter 2012 and spring 2014) at 49–55 sampling sites selected with worst-scenario criteria. In each site, a light trap for capturing Phlebotominae was active during two consecutive nights in summer 2011, fall and winter 2012 and three consecutive nights in spring 2014. Lutzomyia longipalpis and Nyssomyia whitmani (Leishmania infantum and L. braziliensis main vectors in the study area, respectively), were the species more frequently captured. For these vectors, the estimation in the percentage of sites with presence increased between 23% and 75% (depending on the species and the season) with two nights compared to the estimation of a single night. The pattern for the average number of captures showed that the estimation did not change substantially but the coefficients of variation slightly decreased. The richness increased with the number of trap nights in all samples. Our results show the importance of avoiding single-night sampling due to the increase in the estimated percentage of sites with occurrence of vectors with a two-night protocol and in the richness also with a three night protocol. As more nights are sampled, the probability of detection of sand flies of different species increases (even medically important species), and the variability between nights is compensated. However, due to cost restrictions, complementary studies are in progress to determine the optimal minimum number of nights to estimate these and other variables in different environments and seasons. Also, other characteristics of the survey, such as the type of trap (or traps) used and the main objective of the survey should be considered. Currently in Argentina, where operationally possible, the general recommendation is a three-night capture protocol.\n\nIdentification of natural breeding sites of sand flies in an endemic zone of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Argentina\n\nMariana Manteca Acosta1, Maria Soledad Santini2,3, Maria Eugenia Utgés2, Oscar Daniel Salomón1,3\n\n1Instituto Nacional de Medicina Tropical (INMeT), Ministerio de Salud de la Nación, Puerto Iguazú, Misiones, Argentina\n\n2Centro Nacional de Diagnóstico e Investigación en Endemo-epidemias (CeNDIE), ANLIS, Ministerio de Salud de la Nación, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n3Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Argentina\n\nmariasoledadsantini@gmail.com\n\nThe location of the microhabitats where immature stages of phlebotomine sand flies develop is one of the least-known aspects of sand fly biology because these stages are difficult to detect in their terrestrial breeding sites. This project was developed in a rural area (Misiones, northeastern Argentina) where epidemic outbreaks of cutaneous leishmaniasis due to Leishmania braziliensis took place during 2004–2005, with Nyssomyia whitmani as the main vector. The houses in this zone are built typically on stilts, with floors elevated above the ground, providing a microhabitat with suitable and stable temperatures, high humidity and a resting place for domestic and even synanthropic animals. The objective of this work was to detect the presence of natural sand fly breeding sites both in chicken sheds and under the stilt houses, presumably the more suitable places for phlebotomine larvae. From October 2015 to April 2016, a total of 439 emergence traps were set to sample these two microhabitats (designated as “chicken shed” and “below house”) at each of eight farms. The area of each microhabitat was divided into squares of 40 × 40 cm, and an emergence trap was set inside each square. The traps were checked fortnightly and relocated every 40 days within the same square, considering the average lab-based time spent for development of the immature stages. Emergent adults were collected in 40 (9%) of the total traps placed, 21 from “chicken shed” sites and 19 from “below house” sites. We collected 79 sand flies: 77 Ny. whitmani, one Pyntomyia monticola and one Expapillata firmantoi. The proportion of Ny. whitmani positive emergence traps in chicken sheds was not significantly higher than the proportion from “below house” sites (χ2 = 0.82, df = 1, p > 0.05). For the chicken shed microhabitat, the total density was 2.7 individuals per square, and for the below house microhabitat only 1.1 individuals per square. However, we did not find significant differences between the average number of individuals per square in “chicken shed” sites (0.03, DS 0.04) and “below house” sites (0.02, DS 0.02) (F = 1.26, df = 1, p = 0.28). Nyssomyia whitmani was collected during each month of the study, with a peak in November–December 2015, consistent with previous adults captures. Along the northeastern border of Argentina, the chicken shed- and below house-microhabitats are suspected as potential natural breeding sites for phlebotomine sand flies, mainly Ny. whitmani, vector of Leishmania braziliensis, the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in this area.\n\nUpdate on Phlebotominae fauna from the Chaco region, Argentina\n\nEnrique Alejandro Szelag1,3,4, Jose Dilermando Andrade Filho, Juan Ramón Rosa3, María Gabriela Quintana1,4,5, Oscar Daniel Salomón1,5\n\n1Instituto Nacional de Medicina Tropical, Misiones, Argentina\n\n2Centro de Referência Nacional e Internacional para Flebotomíneos, Grupo de Estudos em Leishmaniose, Centro de Pesquisas René Rachou, Belo Horizonte, Brazil\n\n3Instituto de Medina Regional, Chaco, Argentina\n\n4Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Tecnológicas (CONICET).

This work aims to provide an update on the Phlebotoinae fauna and species distribution in the Chacoan region. Biogeographically, the Chaco region is divided by its annual rainfall gradient into two clearly differentiated subregions: the Eastern region (Wet Chaco) and the Western region (Dry Chaco). The first presents a damp Atlantic rainfall pattern where biomes form parks and savanna with abundant rainfall in summer and fall. On the other hand, the Western region has a dry continental and semi-arid rainfall pattern. Captures were conducted monthly in the two biogeographic regions using CDC miniature light placed 1.5 m above the ground, and operating for 12 h (from 7 pm to 7 am). In Western Chaco region, captures were made during the period 2006–2008 for two consecutive nights each month in Nueva Población (S24°58′18″–W61°21′25″). In the Eastern Chaco region, captures were made monthly for overnight from 2009 to 2013 in the towns of Margarita Belen (S27°26′34″–W58°54′13″), Colonia Benitez (S27°19′16″–W58°59′53″), Resistencia (S27°16′48″–W59°1′11″), Tres Isletas (S26°20′24″–W60°25′52″). In the Transitional Area (Wet Chaco/Dry Chaco) of Pampa del Indio (S25°52′29.9″; W59°49′25.5″), monthly collections for two consecutive nights were made from 2013 to 2015.

The presence of three species was confirmed: Lutzomyia longipalpis, vector of the causative agent of VL, Nyssomia neivai and the species complex Evandromyia cortelezzi-sallesi, vectors of the causative agents of Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (TL). Based on this information, this study was designed to study the spatio-temporal distribution of the Phlebotominae of Corrientes, in order to establish seasonal (temporal) and environmental (spatial) profiles sand fly relative abundance as indicators of risk of exposure to sand fly bites. Relying on this information, it is hoped that distribution models can be developed and validated in other endemic areas. Sociodemographic and environmental data (taken from satellite images) were used to define three strata: rural immersed in a peri-urban matrix, peri-urban and urban. The sampling period was from September 2014 to August 2015, two samplings per season, and consisted of placing REDILA-BL minilight traps in six peridomiciliary sites of each identified stratum for three consecutive, rainless nights. The sites were selected under “worst case scenario” criteria. Captured sand fly specimens were kept dry until diaphanized with lactophenol and identified using an optical microscope, following Galatti (2005). Spring: 662 Phlebotominae, 66% from rural stratum, 28% from peri-urban and 6% from urban stratum. Species: Rural stratum – Lu. longipalpis (91%), Nyssomyia. neivai (7.5%), Migonemyia migonei (1.4%) and a single female Ev. cortelezzi-sallesi. Peri-urban stratum – Lu. longipalpis (83.7%), Ny. neivai (15.7%) and a single female Mg. migonei. Urban stratum – Lu. longipalpis (100%). Summer: 2208 Phlebotominae, 77% from rural, 21% from peri-urban and 2% from urban stratum. Species: Rural stratum – Lu. longipalpis (30%), Ny. neivai (57%), Mg. migonei (10.5%) and Ev. cortelezzi-sallesi (2%) and 3 female Micropigomyia quinquefer. Peri-urban stratum – Lu. longipalpis (50%), Ny. neivai (40%), Mg. migonei (9%) and a single female Ev. cortelezzi-sallessi. Urban stratum – Lu. longipalpis (100%). Autumn: 723 Phlebotominae, 91% from rural stratum, 6% from peri-urban and 3% from urban stratum. Species: Rural stratum – Lu. longipalpis (11%), Ny. neivai (80%), Mg. migonei (8.5%) and three female Ev. cortelezzi-sallesi. Peri-urban stratum – Lu. longipalpis (68%), Ny. neivai (25%), Mg. migonei (7%). Urban stratum – Lu. longipalpis (100%). Winter: 80 Phlebotominae, 56% from rural stratum, 15% from peirurban and 19% from urban stratum. Species: Rural stratum – Lu. longipalpis (27%) and Ny. neivai (73%). Peri-urban stratum – Lu. longipalpis (80%), Ny. neivai (20%). Urban stratum – Lu. longipalpis (100%). The spatial distribution reveals that Lu. longipalpis is the only species present in all three environments. The remaining species were restricted to peri-urban and mostly to the rural stratum. The temporal distribution shows a bimodal abundance curve with a peak in late spring and the other in late summer. This study identifies risk strata and moments of higher probability of contact between humans and vectors for the study area. Differences in abundances between environmental strata could indicate that populations of phlebotomine species behave as metapopulations with recolonizations, in times of greater abundance, from the rural stratum to the other strata, and that Lu. longipalpis is the species with best colonization success.\n\nDistribution, abundance, and genetic variability of Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae) in Tartagal city, Salta, Argentina\n\nMaría Gabriela Quintana1,2,3,4, María Soledad Santini2,4,5, Andrea Gómez Bravo2,6, Ana Denise Fuenzalida1,2,3, Mariana Manteca Acosta1,2, Angélica Pech-May1,2,4,7, Oscar Daniel Salomón1,2,4\n\n1Instituto Nacional de Medicina Tropical-MSN, Argentina\n\n2REDILA, Argentina\n\n3Instituto Superior de Entomología-UNT, Argentina\n\n4CONICET, Argentina\n\n5Centro Nacional de Diagnóstico e Investigaciones en Endemoepidemias-ANLIS-MSN, Argentina\n\n6Fundación Mundo Sano, Argentina\n\n7Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública/Centro Regional de Investigación en Salud Pública, Tapachula, Chiapas, México\n\ngabrieladealquintana@gmail.com\n\nLutzomyia longipalpis was first reported in northeastern Argentina in 2004, and from there began its spread southwards. Three human cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) were reported without the confirmed presence of Lu. longipalpis between 2008 and 2011 in the province of Salta, located in the northwest of the country. In the northeast, the first human cases were reported in 2006 and to date there have been 153 cases reported. In 2013, phlebotomine sand fly collections were made in the city of Tartagal, Salta, when the presence of Lutzomia longipalpis was first reported in northwestern Argentina. Subsequently, intensive sampling was done in this city in order to study the distribution pattern and stratify the potential transmission risk of Lesihmania infantum. The city was divided into 400 × 400-meter quadrants and 66 sites/households were selected according to “worst case scenario” criteria. Collections were made for three consecutive nights with CDC-type miniature light traps. In order to correlate and characterize those sites with high sand fly abundance, the following variables were explored: micro variables/macro-habitats taken in situ (10 m2), and environmental variables taken from high-resolution image. At the same time, samples of Lu. longipalpis males from two different sites approximately 1500 m apart were analyzed to study the genetic variability of the populations (ND4 gene). A total of 709 sand flies were collected comprising the following species: Evandromyia cortelezzii-sallesi complex (486), Migonemyia migonei (139), Lutzomyia longipalpis (82) and Nyssomyia neivai (2). Of the sampled sites, 54 yielded sand flies, and 16 sites were positive for Lu. longipalpis (24%). Of the Lu. longipalpis, the ratio of males to females was 1:1; 25% of the females were gravid, and 27% with blood in abdomen. Regarding the variables explored in relation to the abundance of Lu. longipalpis, correlation was found with the following: soil coverage and the number of dogs (micro-habitats); square meters of waterlogged areas (macro-habitats); and the environmental variables were: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) average of a 50 m2 buffer around the trap, and the normalized difference water index (NDWI) within 5 m2. Genetic variability between sand fly populations at the two analyzed sites was high, with 14 different haplotypes, with only one shared by both populations. These preliminary results reveal an incipient colonization and interesting population variability that demand intensified, especially in the border area with Bolivia to and elucidate the route of entry and/or dispersion of the main vector of Lesihmania infantum in northwestern Argentina.\n\nFinancial support: Bunge & Born Foundation, Ministry of Health of Argentina and Mundo Sano Foundation.\n\nUpdated distribution records of phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) of Spain\n\nJavier Lucientes1, Rosa Estrada1, Vladimir Oropeza-Velasquez1, Sarah Delacour-Estrella1, Pedro María Alarcón-Elbal1,2, José Ignacio Ruiz-Arrondo1, Ricardo Molina3\n\n1Departamento der Patología Animal, Facultad de Veterinaria, Instituto Agroalimentario de Aragón (IA2) (Universidad de Zaragoza-CITA), Spain\n\n2Universidad Agroforestal Fernando Arturo de Meriño, Jarabacoa, Dominican Republic\n\n3Laboratorio de Entomología Médica, Servicio de Parasitología, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III.

This viral disease is mainly transmitted among vertebrate hosts (principally domestic and wild ruminants) by several species of biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). The traps used were CDC miniature blacklight traps (Model 1212; John W. Hock Company, Gainesville, FL) were placed outside selected sheep or cattle farms and was run for one night each week from dusk until dawn. All collected arthropods were transported to the laboratory and preserved in 70% ethanol. Upon examination, species of medical and veterinary interest were separated from other insects. The captured phlebotomine sand flies were stored into separate tubes with 70% ethanol and taxonomic identification was made according to Lewis (1982) and Gállego et al (1992). Seven species were identified: Sergentomyia minuta, Phlebotomus papatasi, Ph. perniciosus, Ph. ariasi, Ph. langeroni, Ph. sergenti and Ph. mascitti. Of these, Ph. perniciosus is the most widespread vector of Leishmania infantum in the country. In the present work we present the updated distribution maps of sand flies species for the period 2004–2015 in peninsular Spain and Balearic Islands. No catches have been recorded in Canary Islands.\n\nFinancial support: Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment of Spain.\n\nPresence of Phlebotomus (Transphlebotomus) mascittii Grassi, 1908, in northern Spain: first record for the Cantabrian Region and second for the Iberian Peninsula\n\nJavier Lucientes1, Rosa Estrada1, Vladimir Oropeza-Velasquez1, Sarah Delacour-Estrella1, Pedro María Alarcón-Elbal1,2, José Ignacio Ruiz-Arrondo1, Ricardo Molina3\n\n1Departamento de Patología Animal, Facultad de Veterinaria, Instituto Agroalimentario de Aragón (IA2) (Universidad de Zaragoza-CITA), Spain\n\n2Universidad Agroforestal Fernando Arturo de Meriño, Jarabacoa, Dominican Republic\n\n3Laboratorio de Entomología Médica, Servicio de Parasitología, Centro Nacional de Microbiología, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain\n\njlucien@unizar.es\n\nFramed within the Spanish Bluetongue Entomological Surveillance Programme, CDC miniature black-light (UV) traps (Model 1212) were used in selected sheep and cattle farms nationwide. All collected arthropods were transported to the laboratory and preserved in 70% ethanol. Upon taxonomic identification, species of medical and veterinary interest were separated from other insects. The captured phlebotomine sand flies were identified according to Lewis (1982) and Gállego et al. (1992). During an entomological survey carried out in 2009, one male and five females of Phlebotomus (Transphlebotomus) mascittii were caught in the province of Cantabria, north-central Atlantic coast of Spain, specifically in the municipalities of Coo, Cobreces and San Juan de Soba. These are the first documented records of the occurrence of this species in the Cantabrian Region. Phebotomus mascittii was originally described from Italy and subsequently found in several Mediterranean regions from Spain in the west to Turkey in the east, and also in central European countries such as Switzerland, France, Belgium, Germany, and Austria. In the case of Spain, seven specimens of this species were collected in 1983 in the provinces of Barcelona and Gerona in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia, northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Consequently, the presence of this phlebotomine sand fly is confirmed in Spain after been found for the second time in the Iberian Peninsula. Although the species has never been proven to be a vector of Leishmania, the scarcity of catches in the country makes this a relevant finding.\n\nFinancial support: Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment of Spain.\n\nBlood feeding behavior of Phlebotomus perniciosus collected in the human leishmaniasis focus of southwest Madrid, Spain, during the period 2012–2015\n\nEstela González1, Ricardo Molina1, Ana Tello2, Andrés Iriso3, Ángeles Vázquez2, Maribel Jiménez1\n\n1Medical Entomology Unit, Parasitology Service, National Centre of Microbiology, Institute of Health Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain\n\n2Zoology and Physical Anthropology Department, Faculty of Biological Science, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain.\n\n3Zoonosis and Biological Risk Section, General Directorate of Public Health, Madrid Regional Health Authority, Community of Madrid, Madrid, Spain\n\nmjimenez@isciii.es\n\nSeasonal entomological surveys performed monthly for three consecutive years from May to October at four stations neighboring an urban focus of human leishmaniasis in Madrid (Spain) have shown that Phlebotomus perniciosus, collected with both sticky and CDC light traps, is the only vector of Leishmania infantum in the area, with mean densities reaching 193.60 specimens/m2, as determined by sticky trap collections. In the same study the analysis of blood preferences of Ph. perniciosus revealed that they feed mainly on rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) followed by hares (Lepus granatensis). Direct xenodiagnoses of leishmaniasis carried out on hares and wild rabbits from the focus proved that these lagomorphs are infective to colonized Ph. perniciosus, although in different proportions. The host preferences of sand flies collected in an entomological survey performed during the years 2012 and 2015 along the area of the aforementioned focus were studied. Phlebotomus perniciosus females collected by both sticky and CDC light traps in 29 sampling stations located in five municipalities (Fuenlabrada, Legan"
