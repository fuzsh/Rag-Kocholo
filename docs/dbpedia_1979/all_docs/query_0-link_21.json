        "text": "The book Brazilian\n\nWomen Writers of the Nineteenth Century\n\nruns to almost one thousand pages, and represents a true labor\n\nof literary archeology. No fewer than 52 unknown women\n\nauthors were uncovered. They wrote from letters and diaries,\n\nalbums and notebooks to novels, poems, essays and criticism.\n\nby: Cecília\n\nPrada\n\nIn 1928, the English writer Virginia Woolf received a prestigious invitation:\n\nshe was to lecture on women in English literature, at one of the most prestigious\n\nand traditional British universities, Cambridge.\n\nAn average writer would\n\nopen a history of English literature, and from it would extract some of her\n\npredecessors, such as Jane Austen and George Eliot, and would make her lecture\n\nbrilliant with only a little effort, striving to demonstrate that, \"after\n\nall, we were always here (it was just that no one noticed)\".\n\nHers would have been one\n\nmore of those pathetic presentations that the representatives of various minorities\n\nare accustomed to making to assure their \"presence\" in the picturewhich\n\nnever required this sort of demonstrationof the traditional masculine,\n\nwhite, well-born, Christian, heterosexual society.\n\nThe audience would have\n\nlistened politely, would have applauded the \"brilliant lecturer\",\n\nwho would receive a bouquet of flowers and everyone would move into the salon\n\nof the famous temple of wisdom to take five o’clock tea. As we know, in Brazil\n\neverything ends with pizza, while in England everything ends with tea.\n\nBut Mrs. Woolf decided\n\nthat, in her 46 years of life, she had already had a sufficient quantity of\n\ntea and crumpets. She produced a deep and original reflection on what had\n\nbeen (or not been) the \"presence\" of women in the literature of\n\nher country; on the circumstances that surrounded and impeded, through time,\n\nthe expression of feminine writing; on the contradiction, the hypocrisy of\n\nthe essentially macho world of culturebeginning with the universities\n\nthemselves, access to which had always been forbidden to women.\n\nAccording to Virginia,\n\nthis system prevailed up until her epoch. Speaking ironically, she uses the\n\nterm Oxbridge, which refers to Oxford and Cambridge, to designate a \"very\n\nfamous university\" in whose domain she herself, as a woman, could only\n\nenter if accompanied by a member of the faculty; and in whose library she\n\nwould not have been able to do research, since it also was \"for gentlemen\n\nonly\".\n\nTransformed into a book\n\n(Todo Seu published by Nova Fronteira), the famous lecture by Virginia\n\nand other writings of hers on the topic, collected in Three Guineas (1938),\n\nare considered classics of the genre, fundamental to study of literature and\n\nthe feminine condition. We do not have information on the repercussions of\n\nthe lecture at Cambridge by the brilliant Englishwoman, but it is not difficult\n\nto imagine the reaction of the guardians of the establishment, in defense\n\nof its privileges.\n\nA contemporary detail\n\ncan give us an idea: even today the most serious and reputable of encyclopedias,\n\nthe famous Encyclopedia Britannica, in consecrating Virginia Woolf for \"her\n\noriginal contribution to the form of the novel\" and \"as one of the\n\nmost prominent critics of her time\", not only ignores her feminist position\n\nbut also simply omits from her bibliography precisely the two works cited.\n\nVirginia thus becomes\n\nat least a partial victim of the suppression that she had denounced.\n\nHere in Brazil\n\nMeanwhile, on the other\n\nside of the world… and in quite a distant epoch, a group of women doing\n\nresearch in the area of Brazilian literature from various points in the country,\n\nled by Dr. Rita Terezinha Schmidt, Dr. Eliane Vasconcellos and Dr. Zahidé\n\nLupinacci Muzart, were, over the last 15 years, working to recover the work\n\nof all the women writers of the nineteenth century who had been completely\n\neliminated from literary histories and from many dictionaries.\n\nThe book which records\n\nthe results of this research, Escritoras Brasileiras do Século XIX\n\n(Brazilian Women Writers of the Nineteenth Century), organized by Zahidé\n\nMuzart and launched in 2000 by Editora Mulheres, of Florianópolis,\n\nin partnership with Edunisc, runs to almost one thousand pages, and represents\n\na true labor of literary archeologyin which they uncovered up until\n\nnow no fewer than 52 women authors who, according to the organizer, \"wrote\n\nmuch and addressed all genres: from letters and diaries, albums and notebooks\n\nto novels, poems, crônicas and stories, dramas and comedies,\n\nrevues, operettas, essays and literary criticism.\n\nMany of these women did\n\nnot even dare to admit publicly their authorship of these texts. They lived\n\nconfined in their domestic environment and produced in secret. It is significant\n\nthat the anthology begins with an \"anonymous\" woman from Bahia who\n\nwrote and published in 1887 a feminist booklet, As Mulheres (Women)her\n\nidentity has still not been discovered, but through the text we can see that\n\nshe was from high society, had married well, had been very well educated,\n\nand knew various languages, including Latin.\n\nWe also know that the\n\nfiction writer Júlia Lopes de Almeida was obliged, when she was a girl,\n\nin the second half of the 19th century, to hide her literary activity\n\nfrom her father (the same had happened to the Brontë sisters, in the\n\nfirst half of the century). A note: an adaptation, with the actress Marília\n\nPêra, of the magnificent story by Júlia Lopes de Almeida\"A\n\nCaolha\" (The Cross-Eyed Woman) was broadcast recently on television\n\nin São Paulo. The strength of her literary talent, very little known\n\nuntil today, was shown to be incontestable.\n\nNevertheless, in spite\n\nof the fact that all over the world, especially in the university setting,\n\nthe archeological rediscovery of the cultural contribution of women in various\n\nfields of knowledge and the arts is going onwards, in Brazil, as is the case\n\nelsewhere, prejudicial attitudes continue to prevail.\n\nSome critics have doubted\n\nthat so much effort on the part of the organizers of Escritoras Brasileiras\n\ndo Século XIX was worth itafter all, \"the majority of\n\nthe recovered texts are mediocre, and those women who were suppressed did\n\nnot produce any famous works \"\n\nThis observation in itself\n\nmerits close criticism: it was precisely in the name of a predefinition of\n\nintellectual \"mediocrity\" and of the continuous and violent restriction\n\nto the domestic sphere and to the functions defined as \"the only ones\n\nworthy\" of the feminine sex (marriage and maternity), that women were\n\npushed away from the world of knowledge and kept ignorant, illiterate or only\n\ngiven a social polish of education, learning a little French, embroider, etiquette.\n\nAnd much religion, of course.\n\nAs Pedro Nava says in\n\nhis memoirs, \"the course [in a school run by nuns] was entirely light-weight,\n\neach student attending whichever class she wished\"; when asked what year\n\nthey were in school, the girls could answer \"I really don’t know now\n\nI am learning pyrography, the mountains of Africa, and about Easter lilies\".\n\nThus, in the first place,\n\nwomen are obliged to be exceptional, as are the representatives of various\n\nminorities, always. The passport to recognition, even if it is simply in a\n\nhistorical listing, is, for these, by necessity, extraordinary talent, genius,\n\nheroism or an \"iron force of character\", a \"resistance\"\n\nmaintained in spite of all unfavorable circumstances. A woman, or any member\n\nof a minority, bears the onus of proof never demanded of the mere normality\n\nof the privileged being.\n\nAnd even the very few\n\nwomen who managed, in spite of history, to demonstrate a talent which could\n\nstand up to the worst circumstances, had continually imposed upon them a powerful\n\nmasculine pact of silence, which included (and includes until today) systematic\n\nignorance, a crushing critical effort, and even the physical destruction of\n\nbooks and documentation.\n\nThe organizer of the anthology\n\ncited describes the details of the work necessary to disinter even fragments\n\nof texts by some writers whose bibliography was recorded in writings of the\n\nperiod, but whose works were not found.\n\nFor example: those by\n\nthe almost mythical Rita Joana de Sousa (1696-1718), who is supposed to have\n\nwritten 21 works, but of whom not a line is extant. Another case is that of\n\nthe gaúcha Maria Josefa Barreto, born around 1786/88 and died\n\nin 1837, poet cited in 14 articles or entries of her period, from whom, however,\n\nonly one poem was found.\n\nThus, the \"official\"\n\nhistory of Brazilian literature has transmitted until now an erroneous idea\n\nof the feminine presence (or rather, \"absence\") in the culture of\n\nthe countryas we can note with a pleasant surprise in the census done\n\nby Zahidé Muzart’s team.\n\nIt is interesting to note\n\nthat even a critic such as Viveiros de Castro (cited by Zahidé Muzart),\n\nwho in 1895 set himself to prove that the \"influence of women in the\n\nintellectual panorama of the country was zero\", recognized the reason\n\nfor the feminine absence in the literary field: \"those women, who breaking\n\nwith such a hostile medium, are bold enough to cultivate letters, becoming\n\nwriters, must soon resign themselves to the most pungent sarcasm and the crudest\n\ntaunts\".\n\nAnd he further said: \"They\n\ndispute their talent and spew the most vile calumnies about their honor as\n\nwomen. They rarely receive an encouraging word, and if someone greets them,\n\nhe is immediately suspected of being their lover.\"\n\nIt is not difficult to\n\nimagine, then, how these writers had to struggle for their (minuscule) cultural\n\nspace, and how the intolerance sanctioned by society must have done everything,\n\nin fact, to destroy their legacy physically and spiritually.\n\nVery few of these women\n\nmanaged to breach the barrier of the macho establishmentthose who were\n\nremembered by critics and historians of literature can be counted on the fingers\n\nof one hand. : in the\n\nHistória Concisa\n\nda Literatura Brasileira, by Alfredo Bosithe most widely used in\n\nschools at presentthere are only four names cited, all poets, Francisca\n\nJúlia, Gilka Machado, Auta de Sousa e Narcisa Amália, for which\n\nonly the first merited a biography and special note, the mere mention of their\n\nname being sufficient for the others, in the midst of various poets of their\n\nepochs.\n\nFor the historians of\n\nthe nineteenth century women really did not existnone appears in the\n\nhistories of literature by Sílvio Romero and by José Veríssimo,\n\nalthough the former had written encomiastic prefaces for books of some of\n\nthem\n\nThe Enciclopédia\n\nda Literatura Brasileira, by Raimundo de Menezes, which in its last edition\n\nlists a reasonable number of women writers, relates them in general to a man,\n\nfor whom they were spouses or lovers. In biographies of women, the public\n\nand the private are always perforce intertwinedspouses, number and names\n\nof children are mentioned, a family relationship well established, or \"spurious\"\n\nloves and lovers. These elements are of little importance in biographies of\n\nmen.\n\nFor a writer like Carmen\n\nDolores (pseudonym of Emília Moncorvo Bandeira de Mello), one of the\n\nmost important women writers of the nineteenth century, a journalist and writer\n\nof fiction, Raimundo does not forget to say that \"she entered the press\n\nthrough the hand of the very famous politician Alcindo Guanabara\".\n\nAnd about Cecília\n\nBandeira de Mello de Vasconcellos, Emília’s daughter, and also a writer\n\nand journalist (she used the pseudonym of Madame Chrysanthème), Raimundo\n\ndoes not forget to say that she \"was a late and ardent passion\"\n\nof the same Alcindo Guanabara, and that she also entered the press through\n\nhis hand…just that, if there was a hand in question, this time it must have\n\nbeen that of her own mother, who had become the assiduous and famous writer\n\nof crônicas for O País.\n\nDemi-rebels\n\nThe interdiction on feminine\n\nliterature always took two forms: the generic\"women should not\n\nwrite\", or study, or have a profession, etc.; and the specific\"women\n\nshould not write on particular topics, or in such and such a way\".\n\nThe idealized definition\n\nof \"woman\" as an ethereal being, \"superior\" (a little\n\nfoolish…), virtuous, delicate, naïvea romantic being, outside\n\nthe vile reality of the world, protected in the shelter of the home, endowed\n\nwith the sublime (exclusive) mission of maternity, etc.was imposed by\n\nthe masculine ideology over the course of centuries, and principally in the\n\n19th century, the apogee of the bourgeois patriarchal society.\n\nAnd thus, even the women\n\nwho managed to break with the first interdiction (\"women should not write\")\n\nand struggled arduously for a position in the literary world were not capable,\n\nin the majority of cases, of eliminating the barriers of their own unconscious\n\nand transgressing the limits of a certain well-behaved literature, formal,\n\nstrictly faithful to the literary canons of genre and form imposed by the\n\n(masculine) conventions of \"writing well\". Even in their rebellion,\n\nthey bend before the macho restrictions or sought to be \"as good as\"\n\nmen.\n\nThe eighteenth and nineteenth\n\ncenturies saw the explosion both here and there, in Europe as in Brazil, and\n\neven in the United States, of semi-rebels and halfway feminists who only raised\n\n(and that is already a lot) the problems of the feminine condition, or expressed\n\nfearfully, under a pseudonym, and as if they were asking to be forgiven, their\n\nsexuality and their true feelings.\n\nIt is sufficient to recall\n\nthat one of the greatest English writers, Mary Ann Evans (1819-80) only managed\n\nto penetrate the literary circuit and have success through maintaining the\n\nmasculine pseudonym that made her famous, George Eliot. The same thing happened\n\nwith the French writer Amandine Aurore Dupin, baronesa Dudevant, who entered\n\nhistory as George Sand (1804-76).\n\nIn an article on the education\n\nof women in Brazil in the nineteenth century (the journal \"Tempo &\n\nMemória\" nº 1, Aug/Dec 2003, from Unimarco Editora), Alzira\n\nLobo de Arruda Campos examines how in addition to the repression of the macho\n\nsystem itself, which confined women to the domestic sphere, were added prejudices\n\ncoming from the European educational system, which considered a temperate\n\nclimate the only proper one for the moral training of its female charges.\n\nAnd if the mademoiselles\n\nfrom good families were sent to schools that inexorably reflected \"various\n\ncolonizations of the body and of the spirit\", making them dependent on\n\nat least three factors, i.e., on man, Europe, and science (which defined them\n\ndecidedly as \"less intelligent\"), evidently for slave and proletarian\n\nwomen this picture was added to with racial and class discrimination, and\n\nthey were kept in the most complete ignorance.\n\nTaking all this into consideration,\n\nit is worthy of admiration that in all of Brazil, from north to south, there\n\narose even at the beginning of the nineteenth century as many as 19 women\n\njournalists and writers aware of these injustices, and who struggled for the\n\nrights of women to education and the vote.\n\nIn the middle of that\n\ncentury there already existed a \"women’s press\"magazines and\n\nother publications with staffs consisting, often, exclusively of women, and\n\nintended for women. The first of these was O Jornal das Senhoras (The\n\nWomen’s Journal), founded in 1852 in Rio de Janeiro and published initially\n\nby the Argentinean Joana Paula Manso de Noronha and then by the Bahian\n\nViolante de Bivar.\n\nBut all these organs of\n\nthe press did not go past certain boundaries and propagandized in favor of\n\nbourgeois values, that is, fighting for the education of women, they supported\n\nthis necessity so that she might \"better educate her children, future\n\ncitizens\" and \"reign in her own home\", \"as loyal and worthy\n\ncompanion of her husband\".\n\nSome Highlights\n\nOne of the most important\n\nwomen writers of the nineteenth century was Dionísia Gonçalves\n\nPinto, born in Rio Grande do Norte in 1810, died in Rouen (France) in 1885known\n\nunder the pseudonym of Nísia Floresta. She was one of the first women\n\nto publish stories, poetry, novels and essays in the so-called grand press\n\nof the period, in Rio de Janeiro, beginning already in 1830note that\n\nthe Brazilian press only existed from 1817 onwards.\n\nShe was the precursor\n\nof feminism in Brazil, and even in Latin America, and had a significant political,\n\nsocial and literary presence in that periodnot only in Brazil, but in\n\nEurope as well, where she moved for good in 1849, sick of the profound mediocrity\n\nof Brazil, having spent the last 28 years of her life writing and traveling.\n\nNísia founded in\n\n1838 a school for girls, in Rio de Janeiro, the Colégio Augusto,\n\nthe curriculum of which was bitterly criticized, since it emphasized instruction\n\nin languages and sciences, to the detriment of the manual arts. Over her lifetime,\n\nshe published twenty works, in Portuguese, French and Italianbut although\n\nher books were well-received in Europe (where she had ties with the most important\n\nwriters, such as Victor Hugo, Alessandro Manzoni, Augusto Comte, George Sand,\n\nAlphonse de Lamartine e Alexandre Herculano), she received not even a mention\n\nfrom any of the critics and historians in Brazil.\n\nGilberto Freyre is one\n\nof the rare Brazilian writers who was aware of the existence and importance\n\nof Nísia Floresta. In Sobrados e Mocambos (The Mansions and\n\nthe Shanties), he presents her as \"a scandalous exception\":\n\n\"Among men who dominated solely all extradomestic activities, with even\n\nbaronesses and viscountesses barely being able to read, the finest ladies\n\nlettering out only devotional books and novels which were almost fairy stories,\n\nit astounds us to see a figure such as Nísia\".\n\nThe master of Apipucos\n\ndoes not avoid, however, a certain machismo, in using a loaded adjective to\n\nclassify Nísia as a \"truly masculine woman among the swooning\n\nmademoiselles of the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nEven without her other\n\nworks, which are little by little being rediscovered by contemporary feminist\n\ncriticism, Nísia would have deserved to be the object of study by our\n\nliterary history for at least one thing: a contemporary of the romantic and\n\nIndianist poets, she was also the precursor of a more \"modern\" vision\n\nof the problem of the indigenous population.\n\nAs Constância Lima\n\nDuarte says, in the work we are examining, \"the\n\npoem brings us not a vision of the heroic Indian and his struggle, which is\n\npresent in most of the known Indianist texts, but rather the point of view\n\nof the defeated, of the vanquished Indian, aware and unaccepting of the oppression\n\nof his race by the white invader.\"\n\nAnother important name:\n\nJosefina Álvares de Azevedo (1851-?), who some biographers believe\n\nwas an illegitimate sister of the Paulista poet Manuel Antônio\n\nÁlvares de Azevedo, and others believe was his cousin. Even her place\n\nof birth is uncertainsome list it as Itaboraí, state of Rio de\n\nJaneiro, others as Recife, in Pernambuco state.\n\nWhat is certain is that\n\nshe was a great battler for the feminine cause, and founded the newspaper\n\nA Família (The Family) in São Paulo in 1888 (it moved\n\nto Rio de Janeiro six months later), which welcomed exclusively contributions\n\nfrom women, which continued to publish for about a decade.\n\nHer principal cause was\n\nthe struggle for the right to vote for women. She left at least five books,\n\nand a play that was staged, titled O Voto Feminino (The Feminine Vote).\n\nMore information about her life and work can be found in Valéria Andrade\n\nSouto-Maior’s master’s thesis, O Florete e a Máscara (The Foil\n\nand the Mask), published in 2001 by Editora Mulheres.\n\nThe journalistic activities\n\nof women during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were not restricted\n\nto the domestic or feminine sphere. For example, in the output of a woman\n\nborn in 1855 in Jaboatão, Pernambuco state, Francisca Izidora Gonçalves\n\nda Rochawho was also a teacher, lecturer, poet, writer of crônicas,\n\nnovelist and translatorit is surprising to see the range of topics that\n\nshe addressed in the various organs of the press in Pernambuco.\n\nShe dealt with politics\n\nand current event, both in Brazil and abroad, such as the assassination of\n\nthe Empress of Austria, or the discovery of originals of Bento Teixeira by\n\nOliveira Lima. She wrote reviews of important books, such as Páginas\n\nde Estética (Pages on Esthetics), by João Ribeiro.\n\nEven without leaving the\n\nstate of her birth, she wove commentaries that took in all of the Brazilian\n\nreality, denouncing the \"feudalism\" which the capital of the Republic\n\nexercised over the other states, or foreseeing, in 1910, future problems,\n\nsuch as the \"excess of material activity in the struggle for industrialization,\n\nto the detriment of our artistic and literary culture\".\n\nAmong the Paulistas,\n\nwe cannot forget Maria Paes de Barros (1851-1952), who at 81 years old wrote\n\na História do Brasil (History of Brazil) and at 94 a treasureNo\n\nTempo de Dantesher memoirs, published in 1946 by Monteiro Lobato,\n\nwith a preface by Caio Prado Júnior, and republished by Paz e Terra\n\nin 1998.\n\nIt is an extremely well\n\nwritten work, considered to be of great historical and sociological value,\n\nsince it depicts the ambiguity of the Brazilian society in the second half\n\nof the nineteenth century, divided between tradition and political liberalism.\n\nAngels or Demons\n\nWoman in Brazilian\n\nliterature: absent or mischaracterized\n\nA look at Brazilian literary\n\nhistory makes evident the absence not only of women writers, but also of strong,\n\nauthentic, well delineated female characters, until the beginnings of the\n\ntwentieth century. During the colonial period, Brazil saw descriptive reports\n\nof the land, an incipient historiography of a primarily Jesuitical character,\n\nlyric or satiric poets, the Arcadian poetical movementfrom all these\n\nthe lasting impression is one of a \"land without women\", where some\n\nenlightened men (with a classical education coming primarily from the University\n\nof Coimbra) entertained each other by composing verses, sacred works, or panegyrics\n\nto governors.\n\nWhen she appeared, a woman\n\nwaslike Marília de Dirceu [the object of an extensive poem by\n\nTomás Antônio Gonzaga (TM)] not created as a person and reduced\n\nto the condition of an object of desire. An object, never a subject.\n\nThis characteristic persisted\n\nthroughout the entire romantic periodin the extensive gallery of female\n\ncharacters of our first novelist, Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, the most famous\n\nof which being Moreninha, the protagonist of the work by this name,\n\nwhat is notable is the superficiality, the necessity of romantic idealization\n\nin a literature made for the entertainment of the ladies of society.\n\nWe detect the same \"irreality\"\n\nin the close to 20 novels of one of our greatest writers, José de Alencarwho\n\nentered history as the \"writer of feminine profiles\", a label he\n\ngave himself. He describes the mechanism of money as the moving force in life\n\nin the high social stratum in which he lived, gave a detailed portrait of\n\nthe Brazil of his time, with social and historical references, taking pleasure\n\nin details of clothing, furniture, architecture.\n\nNevertheless, his \"feminine\n\nprofiles\" are always colored by a romantic idealization which verges\n\non stereotypehe is a specialist in blond and pallid damsels, virtuous\n\nand very elegant, or when he goes to the other extreme to describe \"sinners\"\n\n(principally in Lucíola), he allows the force of prejudice to\n\ndecharacterize them entirely as persons, and they end up as the old cliché\n\nof the \"whore with a heart of gold\", beautiful, generous, victims\n\nof destiny, etc.\n\nAnd yet, in the end, punishedLucíola,\n\na \"fallen\" woman, 19 years old, and who sacrificed her virginity\n\nfor her family, cannot have a happy ending. When she loves and is loved by\n\na youth from \"good society\", she is unable to attain the privileged\n\nstatus of married woman, and must die of tuberculosisa Brazilian dame\n\naux camelias.\n\nWe know that Alencar wrote\n\nto please his readersprincipally women, that is women from his social\n\nmilieu who, like the television audience for the novelas of TV Globo\n\nin 2004, managed to interfere in the unfolding of the plot, and in the denouement,\n\nwith their prejudices.\n\nHe was basically, then,\n\na writer of \"entertainment reading\", but who in the field of expression\n\nand of language created a true literary fiction, something which had been\n\npractically non-existent in Brazil up to that point.\n\nSenhora, his last\n\nnovel (1875), seems at first to situate itself as a \"realist\" work,\n\nsince it presents the character of Aurélia as a \"different\"\n\nwoman, intelligent, revolting against the money-grubbing mentality of her\n\nmilieu. Upon discovering that her suitor Seixas wants to marry her for financial\n\nreasons, she plots revenge, reducing her husband to a bought object and emptying\n\nher marriage of any sexual and affective relationship. Just that, unhappily,\n\nthe novelist undoes his own work by making her repent. The happy ending guaranteed\n\nthat the publication would sell.\n\nThe discharacterization\n\nof the real woman reaches the verge of the ridiculous in an author like Bernardo\n\nGuimarães. In his famous novel A Escrava Isaura, in which he\n\nintends to denounces the stains of slavery, he whitens the character, in order\n\nto beautify her:\n\n\"Her complexion is\n\nlike the ivory of the keyboard, a white that does not shine, misted with a\n\ndelicate nuance, so that you would not be able to say if it was a light pallor\n\nor a faded pink\".\n\nIn order to conclude such\n\na brief look into such a rich subject, we recall the naughty American proverb\n\n\"Good girls go to Heaven; bad girls go everywhere\"because,\n\nof all the heroines in the Brazilian literature of the nineteenth century,\n\nwe are only able to remember as \"real\" certain \"bad girls\"\n\nof flesh and bloodsome figures from O Cortiço, by Aluísio\n\nde Azevedo; the masculinized Luzia-Homem (Luzia-Man) (1903), of Domingos\n\nOlímpio; and the homicidal Dona Guidinha do Poço, still\n\nvery little-known, since the novel, written by Manuel de Oliveira Paiva in\n\n1891, was only published after having been discovered by Lúcia Miguel\n\nPereira, in 1951.\n\nVery much of flesh and\n\nblood, and enduring, is the mysterious bad girl of Machado de Assis, Capitu,\n\nwith hung-over eyesbut who was born already on the brink of the twentieth\n\ncentury, in 1899. A century in which, beginning in the twenties and thirties,\n\nwomen writers finally were able, and by fits and starts, to begin to present\n\nthemselves in literature and other fields."
