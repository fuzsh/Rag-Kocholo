There was then a phase of Braziliam romanticism from approximately 1846-80, with standout texts including JosÃ© de Alencarâs O Guarani (1857, The Guarany). In the next stage, works of Brazilian realism and naturalism handled the subject of slavery, such as AluÃ­sio Azevedoâs O CortiÃ§o (1890, The Slum). These debates about race, but also the status of immigration in Brazil, were explored at the beginning of the twentieth century in novels asuch as JosÃ© Pereira da GraÃ§a Aranhaâs CanaÃ£ (1902, Canaan) and Afonso Henriques de Lima Barretoâs O Triste Fim de Policarpo Quaresma (1915, The Sad End of Polycarp Lent).\n\nThese texts fed into the development of Brazilian modernism from around 1922-30, exemplified in works such as Mario de Andradeâs MacunaÃ­ma (1928). After a revolution in 1930 came a period of so-called âsocial novelsâ such as Jorge Amadoâs Terras do sem fim (1942, The Violent Land). After this phase, there was a turn to lifewriting and experimental self-portraits, known as The New Narrative according to Passos (p. 99). A good example here is Clarice Lispectorâs A paixÃ£o segundo G.H. (1964, The Passion According to G.H.). Following a military coup in 1964, an emergent strain of political novel emerged, such as AntÃ´nio Calladoâs Quarup (1967).\n\nSince 1985, the Brazilian novel has continued to proliferate across a range of forms with ânew social movements gradually [making] their way into the national literary marketâ (Passos, p. 99). This includes feminist texts, LGBT authors and issues, and eco-fiction, which although featuring throughout the history of the Brazilian novel were rarely seen as independent thematic strands. Some contemporary works within this culture include Marilene Felintoâs As mulheres de Tijucopapo (1981, The Women of Tijucopapo), Rubem Fonsecaâs Bufo & Spallanzani (1985), Joao Alminoâs Samba-Enredo (1994, The Samba), and Ana Maria GonÃ§alvesâs Um defeito de cor (2006, A Color Blemish)\n\nFurther reading:"
