        "text": "An in-depth look at how Machado de Assis affirms his uniqueness through the role of a reflective reader who eventually becomes a self-reflective author, whose text is primarily the written memory of his private library. On a recent trip to Brazil, Salman Rushie confessed his appreciation of the workd of Machado de Assis. Similarly, on the occasion of the release of his film, \"Matchpoint,\" Woody Allen expressed his admiration for the author of \"Dom Casmurro.\" Cultural supplements in newspapers and magazines have enthusiastically reprinted these encomiums for the author of \"The Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas.\" Is it possible that a “master on the periphery of capitalism”--to use Roberto Schwarz’s expression--can achieve full recognition in the “world republic of letters”--as Pascale Casanova calls the structure of the international literary marketplace? Casanova provides the answer: “Notwithstanding ecumenical ideology that presides over literary celebrations, writers insmall languages are apt to find themselves marginalized.” New readings of Machado’s work come to the fore when we discuss his legacy in a broader context. Therefore, we should emphasize the circumstances of an author who boldly experimented with literary genres, freely appropriated the literary tradition, developed an irreverent rapport with the reader through a series of experiments with the narrative voice, attributed to the act of reading a central role in the act of writing, and played with the process of rewriting the text as the text is being written through the act of ironically commenting on the process of composition. Machado de Assis is a very provocative writer, regardless of his geographical coordinates. Indeed, Machado seems to write (also) in order to think about literature. He narrates in order to propose narrative problems; his oeuvre thus embodies a form whose content is the problematization of literature itself, its conditions of readability and the status of interpretation in the age of the printing press. As soon as we bring questions such as these to the fore we see a new Machado de Assis appear, one who is a precursor of Jorge Luis Borges; a precursor to that family of authors who always knew that writing is a byproduct of reading.\n\nIn one of his most intriguing poems, Carlos Drummond de Andrade provides inspiration for this current volume of Portuguese Literary & Cultural Studies - \"Brazil 2001: A Revisionary History of Brazilian Literature and Culture\". The poem, called “Hino Nacional,” is a paradoxical reconstruction of variegated efforts aimed at the building of the nation. In the final lines of the poem, however, it is “Brazil” - as an impossible Kantian thing-in-itself - that emerges and refuses all attempts to grasp its essence: Brazil does not want us! It is sick and tired of us! Our Brazil is in the afterworld. This is not Brazil. There is no Brazil. By any chance, are there Brazilians?\n\nDebates surrounding race in Brazil have become increasingly fraught in recent years as the once hegemonic concept of democracia racial continues to be subject to an ever more agnostic scrutiny. Parallel to these debates, and yet ultimately inseparable from them, is the question of what it is to be ‘white’. In this interdisciplinary paper, we argue that ‘whiteness’ has become increasingly sedimented in Brazilian public discourse as a naturalised category. And seeking a fresh perspective on what we perceive to have become a sterile debate, we examine Machado de Assis and his work to illustrate how assumptions surrounding his short story Pai contra Mãe and indeed comments on the author’s very body, reveal the extent to which ‘whiteness’ has come to be seen as non-negotiable and fixed. Placing a close reading of Machado’s text at the heart of the article, we explain our reading’s consequences for the scholarly debates now unfolding in Brazil as to the construction of ‘whiteness’. The article then develops ideas on ‘whiteness’ by pointing to the differences inherent between perspectives of ‘race’ as a process and perspectives of ‘race’ as a fixed and naturalized given.\n\nCritics historically interpreted Machado de Assis as a mulatto who broke through the wall of second-class citizenship and studiously avoided any reference to his racial origins. His life and writings refl ect a disinterest in slavery and race relations as well as other contemporary social issues. Critics argued that Machado’s literary works, far from concerning themselves with questions of race, much less slavery, focus on the upper echelon—the urban bourgeoisie—which was a small and overwhelmingly white segment of Brazilian society By the mid-twentieth century, critics discovered that Machado did in fact display an interest in slavery, race relations, and other social concerns. The plantation on which Brazil’s political economy depended appears in its most developed form in his later novels, yet even in those works it is not central. Indeed, later scholarship asserted that Machado’s public pronouncements, as well as the treatment of slavery and race relations in his writings, seem both meek and sparse compared to several prominent late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Afro-Brazilian writers such as Luís Gama (1830–82), José do Patrocínio (1853–1905), and Lima Barreto (1881–1922). Drawing from Machado’s own statements, as well as his prose fiction, I provide an alternative interpretation as to how Machado’s writings were inflected by the experience of his racial identity. I argue that Machado endeavored to transcend , rather than deny , his racial background by embracing his greater humanity. In his writings, Machado sought to reflect this by universalizing the experience of racial ambiguity and duality regarding the “mulatto” condition in Brazil into a fundamental mode of human existence. For Machado, the struggle with duality and ambiguity is both personal and universal.\n\nIn the field of narratology, this paper promotes some reflections on the interface between history and literature. Based on theoretical premises from philosophy of history and literary theory, two basic and divergent views are approached: one that comprehends historical narratives in a positivist-scientist way: as authentic reproduction of historical events and therefore distinct from literary narratives for being fictional (COHN, LAMARQUE, OLSEN, GINZBURG, among others). The other view identifies similarities (narrator, plot, space, time, figures of speech and rhetoric, etc.) between the two narrative realms, defending a relativist (postmodernist) position regarding the (im)possibility to emulate reality through language (CERTEAU, VEYNE, WHITE, HUTCHEON, among others). This essay concludes that there are both certain subjectivity into historical narratives and some historical extraction into literary narratives, thus, it turns literary works with historical content into an important historical knowledge source."
