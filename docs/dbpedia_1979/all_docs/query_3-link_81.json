The PBMCs of patients with septic shock, trauma-related systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and healthy subjects were incubated with 1 μg/mL LPS at 43 °C (HS). Glutamine 10 mM was added 1 hour before or after induction or not at all. We measured mRNA HSP90α, monocyte (m) and lymphocyte (l) HSP90α proteins, interleukin (IL)-1b, -6, -8, -10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) supernatant levels. Heat shock increased the HSP90α mRNA and mHSP90α in all groups (10-fold in sepsis, p < 0.001 and p = 0.047, respectively). LPS induced the mHSP90α and lHSP90α in healthy (p < 0.001) and mHSP90α in SIRS (p = 0.004) but not in sepsis. LPS induced the cytokines at 24 and 48 h in all groups, especially in trauma (p < 0.001); HS only induced the IL-8 in healthy (p = 0.003) and septic subjects (p = 0.05). Glutamine at 10 mM before or after stimulation did not alter any induction effect of LPS or HS on HSP90α mRNA and mHSP90α protein in sepsis. In SIRS, glutamine before LPS decreased the mHSP90α but increased it when given after HS (p = 0.018). Before or after LPS (p = 0.049) and before HS (p = 0.018), glutamine decreased the lHSP90α expression in sepsis but increased it in SIRS when given after HS (p = 0.003). Regarding cytokines, glutamine enhanced the LPS-induced MCP-1 at 48 h in healthy (p = 0.011), SIRS (p < 0.001), and sepsis (p = 0.006). In conclusion, glutamine at 10 mM, before or after LPS and HS, modulates mHSP90α and lHSP90α in sepsis and SIRS differently and unpredictably. Although it does not alter the stimulation effect on interleukins, glutamine enhances the LPS induction effect on supernatant MCP-1 in all groups. Future research should seek to elucidate better the impact of glutamine and temperature modulation on HSP90α and MCP-1 pathways in sepsis and trauma.

Growing evidence demonstrates the efficacy of the ketogenic diet (KD) for weight loss, but there may be some adverse side effects such as dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis. Aerobic exercise is a widely recognized approach for improving these metabolic markers. Here we explored the combined impacts of KD and moderate aerobic exercise for an 8-week intervention on body weight and fat loss, serum biomarkers, and hepatic lipid metabolism in a mouse model of high-fat diet-induced obesity. Both KD and KD combined with exercise significantly reduced body weight and fat mass. No significant adverse effects of KD were observed in serum biomarkers or hepatic lipid storage, except for an increase in circulating triglyceride level. However, aerobic exercise lowered serum triglyceride levels, and further ameliorated serum parameters, and hepatic steatosis in KD-fed mice. Moreover, gene and protein expression analysis indicated that KD combined with exercise was associated with increased expression of lipolysis-related genes and protein levels, and reduced expression of lipogenic genes relative to KD without exercise. Overall, our findings for mice indicate that further work on humans might reveal that KD combined with moderate aerobic exercise could be a promising therapeutic strategy for obesity.

It is critical to investigate the effects of long-term HFD consumption on cognitive function and to inspect the potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, 9-month-old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to either a normal diet (ND, 10 kcal% fat) or an HFD diet (60 kcal% fat) for 10 months. Then a series of behavioral tests, and histological and biochemistry examinations of the hippocampus and cortex proceeded. We found that long-term HFD-fed aged mice exhibited cognitive function decline in the object place recognition test (OPR). Compared with the ND group, the HFD-fed mice showed Tau hyperphosphorylation at ps214 in the hippocampus and at ps422 and ps396 in the cortex, which was accompanied by GSK-3β activation. The higher activated phenotype of microglia in the brain of the HFD group was typically evidenced by an increased average area of the cell body and reduced complexity of microglial processes. Immunoblotting showed that long-term HFD intake augmented the levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 in the hippocampus. These findings indicate that long-term HFD intake deteriorates cognitive dysfunctions, accompanied by Tau hyperphosphorylation, microglial activation, and inflammatory cytokine expression, and that the modifiable lifestyle factor contributes to the cognitive decline of senior citizens.

Resveratrol causes anti-inflammatory effects in muscles, accelerates muscle repair, and promotes exercise performance after contusion recovery. However, whether resveratrol provides the same benefits for sports injuries caused by eccentric contraction is unknown. Thus, we explored the effects of resveratrol on inflammation and energy metabolism. In this study, mice were divided into four groups: a control group, an exercise group (EX), an exercise with low-dose resveratrol group (EX + RES25), and an exercise with high-dose resveratrol group (EX + RES150). The results of an exhaustion test showed that the time before exhaustion of the EX + RES150 group was greater than that of the EX group. Tumour necrosis factor-α (Tnfα) mRNA expression was lower in the EX + RES150 group than in the EX group. The energy utilisation of the EX + RES150 group was greater than that of the EX + RES25 group in different muscles. High-dose resveratrol intervention decreased Tnfα mRNA expression and enhanced the mRNA expressions of sirtuin 1, glucose transporter 4, AMP-activated protein kinase α1, and AMP-activated protein kinase α2 in muscles. These results revealed that high-dose resveratrol supplementation can reduce inflammation and oxidation and improve energy utilisation during short-duration high-intensity exercise.

Among antidiabetic medications, incretin-based therapy such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors might affect gut microbiomes, which are related to glucose metabolism. This was a randomized, controlled, active-competitor study that aimed to compare the effects of combinations of gemigliptin–metformin vs. glimepiride–metformin as initial therapies on gut microbiota and glucose homeostasis in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes. Seventy drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age, 52.2 years) with a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level ≥7.5% were assigned to either gemigliptin–metformin or glimepiride–metformin combination therapies for 24 weeks. Changes in gut microbiota, biomarkers linked to glucose regulation, body composition, and amino acid blood levels were investigated. Although both treatments decreased the HbA1c levels significantly, the gemigliptin–metformin group achieved HbA1c ≤ 7.0% without hypoglycemia or weight gain more effectively than did the glimepiride–metformin group (59% vs. 24%; p < 0.05). At the phylum level, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio tended to decrease after gemigliptin–metformin therapy (p = 0.065), with a notable depletion of taxa belonging to Firmicutes, including Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus torques, and Streptococcus (all p < 0.05). However, regardless of the treatment modality, a distinct difference in the overall gut microbiome composition was noted between patients who reached the HbA1c target goal and those who did not (p < 0.001). Treatment with gemigliptin–metformin resulted in a higher achievement of the glycemic target without hypoglycemia or weight gain, better than with glimepiride–metformin; these improvements might be related to beneficial changes in gut microbiota.

The aim of this paper was to provide a comparison of the range of sweetened or flavoured beverages between two high-income countries in the Asia-Pacific region: Australia and Singapore. Following the FoodTrackTM methodology, nutrition, labelling, and price data were collected from major Australian and Singaporean supermarket chains and convenience stores. The nutrient profiles of products were tested for differences using Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests. The greatest number of products collected in Australia were from the ‘carbonated beverages’ category (n = 215, 40%), and in Singapore the greatest number of products were from the ‘tea and coffee ready-to-drink’ category (n = 182, 35%). There were more calorically sweetened beverages in Singapore compared with Australia (n = 462/517 vs. n = 374/531, p < 0.001). For calorically sweetened products, the median energy of Singaporean products was significantly higher than Australian products (134 kJ vs. 120 kJ per 100 mL, p = 0.009). In Australia, 52% of sweetened or flavoured beverages displayed a front-of-pack nutrient signposting logo, compared with 34% of sweetened or flavoured beverages in Singapore. These findings also indicate that the consumption of just one serving of calorically sweetened carbonated beverages or energy drinks would exceed the WHO maximum daily free sugar recommendations.

However, its anti-hepatic steatosis and anti-dyslipidemic properties have not been thoroughly investigated. This study examined the aforementioned properties of RRBE, the underlying mechanism by which it alleviated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, and its major bioactive constituents. The mice were divided into four groups based on their diet: (1) low-fat diet (LFD), (2) LFD with high-dose RRBE (1 g/kg/day), (3) HFD, and (4) HFD with three different doses of RRBE (0.25, 0.5, and 1 g/kg/day). The administration of RRBE, especially at medium and high doses, significantly mitigated HFD-induced hepatosteatosis and concomitantly improved the serum lipid profile. Further, RRBE modified the level of expression of lipid metabolism-related genes (adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), liver X receptor alpha (LXRα), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), SREBP-2, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A)) in hepatic or adipose tissues and improved the expression of hepatic high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) cmetabolism-related genes (hepatic lipase (HL) and apolipoprotein A-ǀ (ApoA-ǀ)). RRBE also attenuated markers of liver injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress, accompanied by a modulated expression of inflammatory (nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)), pro-oxidant (p47phox), and apoptotic (B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X and Bcl-2) genes in the liver. High-performance liquid chromatography analyses indicated the presence of protocatechuic acid, γ-oryzanol, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10 in RRBE.

It is unknown whether and how perinatal maternal high-fat diets (MHF)-mediated vascular dysfunction occurs via the angiotensin-PKC-L-type-calcium-channels (LTCC) axis. This study determined angiotensin II (AII) roles in the PKC-LTCC axis in controlling calcium influx in the arteries of offspring after perinatal MHF. Mesenteric arteries (MA) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from 5-month-old offspring rats were studied using physiological, ion channel, molecular, and epigenetic analysis. Pressor responses to AII were significantly increased in the free-moving MHF offspring rats. In cell experiments, MA-SMC proliferation was enhanced, and associated with thicker vascular wall in the obese offspring. Imaging analysis showed increase of fluorescence Ca2+ intensity in the SMCs of the MHF group. Angiotensin II receptor (AT1R)-mediated PKC-LTCC axis in vasoconstrictions was altered by perinatal MHF via reduced DNA methylation at specific CpG sites of Agtr1a and Prkcb gene promoters at the transcription level. Accordingly, mRNA and protein expression of AT1R and PKCβ in the offspring MA were increased, contributing to enhanced Ca2+ currents and vascular tone. The results showed that DNA methylation resulted in perinatal MHF-induced vascular disorders via altered AT1-PKC-LTCC pathway in resistance arteries of the offspring, providing new insights into the pathogenesis and early prevention/treatments for hypertension in developmental origins.

These cravings may be underpinned by a neural facilitation of approach behavior toward chocolate. This preregistered study investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of such a bias using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and reaction times (RTs). Methods: A total of n = 30 frequent chocolate eaters performed a relevant-feature approach–avoidance task (AAT) in the MRI scanner using buttons to enlarge (approach) or to shrink (avoid) pictures of chocolate and inedible control objects. We tested (a) whether implicit RT-based approach biases could be measured in a supine position in the scanner, (b) whether those biases were associated with activity in reward-related brain regions such as the insula, amygdala, striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and (c) whether individual RT-based bias-scores correlated with measures of chocolate craving. Results: Behaviorally, we found a highly reliable approach bias toward chocolate, defined by faster RTs in the compatible conditions (approach chocolate, avoid objects) compared to the incompatible conditions (avoid chocolate, approach objects). Neurally, this compatibility effect involved activity in the left medial OFC, a neural response that was positively correlated with individual approach bias scores. Conclusions: This study shows that the relevant feature AAT can be implemented in an fMRI setting in a supine position using buttons. An approach bias toward chocolate seems related to medial OFC activation that might serve to devalue chocolate when it has to be avoided. Our demonstration of neural and behavioral approach biases for chocolate underscores the need for stimulus-specific cognitive trainings to support healthy consumption and successful self-regulation.

Sufficient nutrition is fundamental to early development. However, little is known about early life dietary impact on later mental health. The aim of this study was to investigate associations of exposure to a healthy and sustainable antenatal and early childhood diet with personality traits and symptoms of depression and anxiety measured at 8 years of age. This study is based on the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and uses data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN) including 40,566 participants. Mental health measures and personality traits were assessed at 8 years. Dietary data from pregnancy, child age 6 and 18 months and 3 and 7 years were used. With few exceptions, inverse associations were observed between healthier diet at all time points and depression and anxiety symptom scores at age 8. We found positive associations between diet scores at almost all time points and extraversion, benevolence, conscientiousness and imagination. Inverse associations were observed between diet scores and neuroticism. Combined, these findings underpin a probable impact of both maternal pregnancy diet and early childhood diet on several aspects of child mental health.

Picky eaters (PEs) consume limited foods, demonstrate food aversion, and have a limited food repertoire, which hinders their growth and health. These behaviours are common in children with special health care needs despite the rise in typically developing children. This leads to less attention being given to intervention programmes for typically developing children. Therefore, this scoping review aims to investigate the key concept of an existing intervention programme for PE among typically developing children, primarily on the types and approaches selected. A thorough literature search was conducted on three primary databases (PubMed, Emerald In-sight, and Web of Science) using predefined keywords. The literature was then appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute’s guidelines and protocols, and the PRISMScR checklist. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were also specified in the screening procedure. Results showed that the majority of the interventions in these studies were single-component interventions, with the sensory approach being the type that was most frequently utilised, followed by the nutrition approach and parenting approach. Single and multiple intervention components improved the assessed outcome, with a note that other components may or may not show a similar outcome, as they were not assessed in the single-component intervention. Given the evidence that picky eating is influenced by various factors, a multi-component intervention can provide a substantial impact on future programmes. In addition, defining picky eaters using standardised tools is also essential for a more inclusive subject selection.

Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial study included 60 women aged 19–68 with BMIs greater than 30 kg/m2. Patients were randomly assigned to the study group (n = 30), which received additional intervention in supplementing the breathing mixture with oxygen at the flow of 6 L/min during training sessions, and the control group (n = 30). At the beginning and at the end of the study, anthropometric assessments (height and weight and BMI) and blood tests (CRP, FRAP, TBARS, TP, BAC, and La) were performed. For each patient, an individual endurance training plan was established on a cycloergometer, including 12 training units, based on a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Results: A decrease in blood TBARS concentration was observed in each study group. For the control group, the change was more remarkable, and the difference between the groups was significant at (p < 0.05; ES: 0.583). Training with the oxygen breathing mixture increased blood concentrations of TP, while a decrease in TP in blood was observed in the group without oxygen supplementation during physical training. The difference in the responses between the groups was significant at (p < 0.05; ES: 0.657) Conclusions: Increasing the concentration of oxygen in the respiratory mixture under conditions of increased exercise was shown to be safe because it did not exacerbate oxidative stress in the obese group.

Recently, Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT), and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) have been suggested as a new prognostic factor of UC activity. Here, we aimed at confirmation of hypotezis that NRI, CONUT and MUST may be used as inexpensive and efficient predictive biomarkers of response in UC patients treated with vedolizumab. Methods: This study was conducted in retrospective manner in 32 adult patients with UC of Caucasian origin (21 men and 11 women), who were qualified for 52-week therapy with vedolizumab and finished the 14-weeks from January 2020 to March 2022. Our study analyzed the 45 courses of vedolizumab therapy. Nutritional status indicators, i.e., the NRI, CONUT and MUST of each UC patient, were marked at the time of qualifying for biological treatment. Results: In our study, the MUST score was significantly lower in UC patients who positively achieved clinical remission at week 14 during vedolizumab induction therapy (0.33 ± 0.49 vs. 1.37 ± 0.83; p = 0.002). The analysis showed the lower baseline NRI and CONUT scores in patients with positive clinical remission at week 14 (NRI: 96.42 ± 4.29 vs. 101.41 ± 7.09; p = 0.024; CONUT: 1.00 ± 1.08 vs. 2.16 ± 1.46; p = 0.031). Conclusions: Nutritional status indicators (NRI, MUST and CONUT) may become valuable predictor of achieving remission at week 14 during vedolizumab therapy in UC patients.

The data were selected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011–2014. A total of 2009 participants were included in this analysis. Dietary α-carotene and β-carotene intake were averaged by two 24-h dietary recalls. The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease Word Learning subset (CERAD W-L), Animal Fluency Test (AFT), and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) were used to evaluate cognitive function. Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models were applied to explore the associations of dietary α-carotene and β-carotene intake with cognitive performance. After adjusting for all confounding factors, compared with individuals in the lowest quartile of β-carotene dietary intake, those in the highest quartile had lower risks of both CERAD W-L decline [odds ratio (OR) = 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44–0.90] and AFT decline (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47–0.94). In addition, the third quartile of β-carotene dietary intake had a significantly decreased risk of lower DSST (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.48–0.83). Compared with the lowest quartile of α-carotene intake, the OR of AFT decline in the highest intake quartile was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.94). For males, both dietary α-carotene and β-carotene intake were associated with a decreased risk of AFT decline (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.25–0.71; OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.30–0.85, respectively). For females, dietary α-carotene intake was associated with a decreased risk of CERAD W-L decline (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33–0.91) and dietary β-carotene intake was associated with decreased risks of both CERAD W-L and AFT decline (OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.21–0.64; OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37–0.91, respectively). Our results suggested that higher dietary α-carotene and β-carotene intake had inverse effects on cognitive function decline among older adults.

TRF’s effect on metabolism is complex and likely acts on various pathways within multiple tissues. Adipose tissue plays a key role in systemic homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. Adipose tissue dysregulation has been causally associated with metabolic disorders in obesity. However, it is largely unknown how TRF impacts metabolic pathways such as lipolysis, lipogenesis, and thermogenesis within different in adipose tissue depots in obesity. To determine this, we conducted a 10-week TRF regimen in male mice, previously on a long-term high fat diet (HFD) and subjected the mice to TRF of a HFD for 10 h per day or ad libitum. The TRF regimen showed reduction in weight gain. TRF restored HFD-induced impairment of adipogenesis and increased lipid storage in white adipose tissues. TRF also showed a depot-dependent effect in lipid metabolism and restored ATP-consuming futile cycle of lipogenesis and lipolysis that is impaired by HFD within epididymal adipose tissue, but not inguinal fat depot. We demonstrate that TRF may be a beneficial option as a dietary and lifestyle intervention in lowering bodyweight and improving adipose tissue metabolism.

Catalpol (CAT), an iridoid glucoside from the root of Rehmannia glutinosa, is reported to manifest anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic and antifibrotic properties. Hence, we studied the possible nephroprotective effects of CAT and its mechanisms in an adenine-induced (0.2% w/w in feed for 4 weeks) murine model of CKD by administering 5 mg/kg CAT to BALB/c mice for the duration of 4 weeks except during weekends. Upon sacrifice, the kidney, plasma and urine were collected and various physiological, biochemical and histological endpoints were assessed. CAT significantly ameliorated the adenine-induced altered body and kidney weight, water intake, urine volume, and concentrations of urea and creatinine in plasma, as well as the creatinine clearance and the albumin and creatinine ratio. Moreover, CAT significantly ameliorated the effect of adenine-induced kidney injury by reducing the kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, cystatin C and adiponectin. Similarly, the augmented concentrations of markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in the adenine-treated group were markedly reduced with CAT pretreatment. Furthermore, CAT prevented adenine-induced deoxyribonucleic acid damage and apoptotic activity in the kidneys. Histologically, CAT significantly reduced the formation of tubular necrosis and dilation, as well as interstitial fibrosis in the kidney. In addition to that, CAT significantly decreased the adenine-induced increase in the phosphorylated NF-κB and reversed the reduced expression of sirtuin-1 in the kidney. In conclusion, CAT exhibits salutary effects against adenine-induced CKD in mice by mitigating inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis via mechanisms involving sirtuin-1 activation and NF-κB inhibition. Confirmatory studies are warranted in order to consider CAT as a potent nephroprotective agent against CKD.

Point of care measurement of ionized magnesium (iMg) allows a rapid identification of patients with impaired magnesium status, however, unlike ionized calcium, the interpretation of iMg is not entirely understood. Thus, we evaluated iMg reference values, correlation between iMg and plasmatic magnesium (pMg), and the impact of pH and albumin variations on iMg levels. Secondary objectives were to assess the incidence of hypomagnesemia in de novo AF. Methods: A total of 236 emergency department and intensive care unit patients with de novo AF, and 198 control patients were included. Reference values were determined in the control population. Correlation and concordance between iMg and pMg were studied using calcium (ionized and plasmatic) as a control in the whole study population. The impact of albumin and pH was assessed in the discordant iMg and pMg values. Lastly, we assessed the incidence of ionized hypomagnesemia (hypoMg) among de novo AF. Results: The reference range values established in our study for iMg were: 0.48–0.65 mmol/L (the manufacturers were: 0.45–0.60 mmol/L). A strong correlation was observed between pMg and iMg (r = 0.85), but, unlike for calcium values, there was no significant impact of pH and albumin in iMg/pMg interpretation. The incidence of hypoMg among de novo AF patients was 8.5% (12.7% using our ranges). When using our ranges, we found a significant link (p = 0.01) between hyopMg and hypokalemia. Conclusion: We highlight the need for more accurate reference range values of iMg. Furthermore, our results suggest that blood Mg content is not identical to that of calcium. The incidence of ionized hypomagnesemia among de novo AF patients in our study is 8.5%.

It is a population-based cross-sectional survey of 690 children (4–12.9 years), from 3 major Emirates. Socio-demographic and anthropometric characteristics were collected. Dietary intakes were assessed using the 24-hour recall approach. Of the total sample, 4% were stunted, 8% were wasted and 28% were overweight/obese. A third of participating children consumed above the Estimated Energy Requirement, while the majority’s intakes carbohydrate, total fat, and protein were within the recommendations; whereas over 70% and 90% of participants consumed above the WHO daily limits of free sugars and saturated fats, respectively. Inadequate intakes of linoleic acid (36% of children), alpha-linolenic acid (91%) and dietary fiber (100%) were observed. All children failed to meet the recommendation for vitamin D and considerable proportions had inadequate intakes of vitamin A, calcium, zinc, folate, and magnesium. Compared with the American Heart Association/American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations, low dietary adherence was noted for fruits (9%), vegetables (4%), and milk/dairy (14%). These findings may be used in the development of nutritional policies aimed at improving the diets of children in the UAE.

Family plays an important role in providing nutrients for children; however, no review specifies this aspect for identifying family characteristics related to stunting. This study aimed to identify family household characteristics related to stunting among children aged less than 5 years. A scoping review was undertaken with sources from PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus, using the keywords “family characteristics” AND “growth”. Inclusion criteria were (1) correlational study; (2) published between 2018 and 31 July 2022; (3) families with children under the age of 5 years; and (4) independent variable any measure of stunting factors from family and household factors. Of 376 articles, only 20 met the inclusion criteria of the study. The family household characteristics included individual factors (sex age, history of diarrhea, and birthplace), family factors (family headship, primary caregiver/mother, social-cultural orientation, and family system factors), and environmental factors. Various child variables, family factors, and environmental factors (the type of home, floor type, water access, source of drinking water, and household electricity) were identified as being associated with stunting.

However, there is considerable global variation in EN practices. This study aimed to characterize the practices and perceptions of gastroenterologists regarding the use of EN in patients with IBD in one of the largest countries in the Gulf region. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on pediatric and adult gastroenterologists working in Saudi Arabia who are involved in IBD management. A self-administered web-based survey was distributed via social media platforms and mailing lists of national gastroenterology societies. Results: A total of 80 gastroenterologists completed the survey. However, only 55 reported that they were currently practicing EN in any form. EN was mostly indicated by gastroenterologists who “sometimes” recommend EN for: the prevention and correction of undernutrition (50.9%), preoperative optimization (50.9%), and the induction of remission in patients with active and long-standing CD (36.4%), at initial diagnosis (34.5%), during the management of complications (61.8%), and after failing to respond to pharmacological therapy (58.2%). Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is regularly recommended by 14.5% of gastroenterologists. The prescription of EEN was significantly associated with the pediatric profession (p < 0.01), IBD specialty (p < 0.05), level of nutrition education during training (p < 0.01), and previous training in a unit with regular EN use (p < 0.01). The most reported barriers to using EN were patients’ lack of acceptance (73.8%) and poor adherence (65%). A lack of dietitian support and a lack of standardized protocols were also reported as barriers by many physicians. Pediatric gastroenterologists were more likely to use at least one assessment method to evaluate EN success. Conclusion: EN practices differ between gastroenterologists working in Saudi Arabia. Future EN protocols should be optimized to support both children and adults with IBD. Gastroenterology training programs should offer nutrition support-focused training to help physicians better utilize EN.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of different food products consumption and ‘omega’ dietary supplements usage in groups of pregnant women. We also measured n-3 and n-6 FA content in serum samples of pregnant women and their children with the GC-FID technique, estimated the efficacy of applied supplementation, and compared the usefulness of different dietary supplements dedicated for pregnant women. ‘Omega’ dietary supplements effectively increased LC PUFA in the maternal blood (EPA, p = 0.0379; DHA p < 0.0001; n-3 PUFA, p < 0.0001), which penetrated the umbilical cord (EPA, p = 0.0131; DHA, p = 0.0288). If fish and seafood consumption is not enough, dietary supplements of the highest quality may provide sufficient LC PUFA without apprehension of MetHg contamination. ‘Omega’ dietary supplementation seems the most efficient way of providing an optimal supply of LC PUFA for the developing child from the earliest stages of development, which will bring advantages in the child’s future life and its health.

However, not all plant-based foods are beneficial, and limited data exist for the Chinese population. We investigated the association between different plant-based dietary indices and the risk of dyslipidemia in a Chinese middle-aged and elderly population. The study participants (n = 4096) consisted of adults between 35 and 74 years of age from Xinjiang, China. Dietary consumption of the study participants was evaluated using a semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Three different plant-based dietary indices were calculated using data from dietary surveys, including overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthy plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthy plant-based diet index (uPDI). Based on these indices, we created an adjusted plant-based diet index (aPDI) based on the Xinjiang population actual dietary behavior and health effects of food. We measured the levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C, and HDL-C in the blood of the study participants. We used multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic spline to analyze the relationship between plant-based diets and dyslipidemia. The findings showed that 36.6% of the participants had dyslipidemia. Higher PDI adherence was related to lower odds of dyslipidemia (Q3 vs. Q1, OR: 0.780, 95% CI: 0.641–0.949; Q4 vs. Q1, OR: 0.799, 95% CI: 0.659–0.970). High aPDI was related to lower odds of dyslipidemia (Q4 vs. Q1, OR: 0.770, 95% CI: 0.628–0.945; Q5 vs. Q1, OR: 0.748, 95% CI: 0.607–0.921). High scores for PDI, hPDI, and aPDI were all related to a reduced risk of low HDL-C (OR: 0.638, 95% CI: 0.491–0.823; OR: 0.661, 95% CI: 0.502–0.870; OR: 0.580, 95% CI: 0.443–0.758). Conversely, a high uPDI score was associated with an increased risk of low HDL-C (OR: 1.349, 95% CI: 1.046–1.740). There was no non-linear relationship between PDI, hPDI, uPDI, and aPDI and the risk of different types of dyslipidemia. Plant-based dietary indices are related to specific types of dyslipidemia risk. Appropriately increasing the consumption of plant-based foods while improving the quality of plant-based dietary patterns is critical for the prevention of dyslipidemia, especially low HDL-C, in the population.

AIRD treatment is based on a comprehensive approach, with the primary aim being achieving and attaining disease remission, through the control of inflammation. AIRD therapies have a low target specificity, and this usually propels metabolic disturbances, dyslipidemias and increased cardiovascular risk. Ceramides are implicated in inflammation through several different pathways, many of which sometimes intersect. They serve as signaling molecules for apoptosis, altering immune response and driving endothelial dysfunction and as regulators in the production of other molecules, including sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P). With lipid metabolism being severely altered in AIRD pathology, several studies show that the concentration and variety of ceramides in human tissues is altered in patients with rheumatic diseases compared to controls. As a result, many in vitro and some in vivo (animal) studies research the potential use of ceramides as therapeutic targets in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, fibromyalgia syndrome, primary Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, myositis, systemic vasculitis and psoriatic arthritis. Furthermore, the majority of ceramide synthesis is diet-centric and, as a result, dietary interventions may alter ceramide concentrations in the blood and affect health. Subsequently, more recently several clinical trials evaluated the possibility of distinct dietary patterns and nutrients to act as anti-ceramide regimes in humans. With nutrition being an important component of AIRD-related complications, the present review details the evidence regarding ceramide levels in patients with AIRDs, the results of anti-ceramide treatments and discusses the possibility of using medical nutritional therapy as a complementary anti-ceramide treatment in rheumatic disease.

Further, this condition represents an important risk factor for its related sequalae including cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke. Emerging evidence has shown that gut microbiota and their metabolites can worsen or protect against the development of dyslipidemia. Although there are currently numerous treatment modalities available including lifestyle modification and pharmacologic interventions, there has been promising research on dyslipidemia that involves the benefits of modulating gut microbiota in treating alterations in lipid metabolism. In this review, we examine the relationship between gut microbiota and dyslipidemia, the impact of gut microbiota metabolites on the development of dyslipidemia, and the current research on dietary interventions, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and microbiota transplant as therapeutic modalities in prevention of cardiovascular disease. Overall, understanding the mechanisms by which gut microbiota and their metabolites affect dyslipidemia progression will help develop more precise therapeutic targets to optimize lipid metabolism.

This research builds on our pilot study (conducted prior COVID-19 pandemic) that revealed high OSA prevalence and poor nutritional status in NHR. The current study included newly recruited n = 365 NHR; 296 women, 69 men, aged 84.3 ± 5.6 and 83.1 ± 7.3 years, respectively. Body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance BIA-ACC®, yielding total bone mass along with all components of lean and adipose tissues. The Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) was used to assess nutritional status. Participants reported about their present/past diseases, including COVID-19. Mean duration of stay in nursing homes was 46.3 ± 47.0 months. Approximately 30% of participants had COVID-19 prior (median 6.7 months) to entering the study. OSA was diagnosed in 70.8% women and 47.8% men (p < 0.001). Malnourishment was detected in 5.8% women and 6.2% men while the risk of malnourishment was found in 30.8% women and 30.0% men. No significant differences in age, body composition parameters, prevalence of OSA, malnutrition/risk for malnutrition were found in participants who had COVID-19 compared to those who did not. Regression analysis showed that intramuscular adipose tissue (%) was significantly positively, while bone mass was significantly negatively associated with OSA. In this population, the high prevalence of OSA coincided with the high prevalence of malnutrition/risk of malnutrition. Such unfavorable body composition status is more likely a consequence of potentially poor diet quality in nursing homes, rather than of health hazards caused by COVID-19.

Chemotherapy (CT) is essential for the treatment of BC, but is often accompanied by several side effects, including taste alterations, due to different mechanisms. Although dysgeusia is usually underestimated by clinicians, it is considered very worrying and disturbing by cancer patients undergoing CT, because it induces changes in dietary choices and social habits, affecting their physical and psychological health, with a profound impact on their quality of life. Several strategies and therapies have been proposed to prevent or alleviate CT-induced dysgeusia. This review aimed to evaluate the available evidence on prevalence, pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical consequences, and strategies for managing dysgeusia in BC patients receiving CT. We queried the National Library of Medicine, the Cochrane Library, Excerpta Medica dataBASE, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature database, performing a search strategy using database-specific keywords. We found that the literature on this topic is scarce, methodologically limited, and highly heterogeneous in terms of study design and criteria for patient inclusion, making it difficult to obtain definitive results and make recommendations for clinical practice.

We applied conditional mixed-process models to estimate the parameters simultaneously, and used them to predict current eating consciousness, current eating behaviors in a balanced diet, dietary behavior, and attitudes toward preventing or improving lifestyle-related diseases as dependent variables. As a result, compared to those who did not have good dietary practices and experiences in mid-adolescence, participants who had good dietary practices and experiences in the same period displayed greater interest in practicing a healthier diet. These participants frequently consumed a combination of staple foods, main dishes, and side dishes, and were more concerned about preventing or improving lifestyle-related diseases. In conclusion, mid-adolescent dietary practices and experiences had a lasting influence on adult eating behaviors and attitudes in Japanese participants.

Olive oil is the most characteristic food of this diet due to its high nutraceutical value. The positive effects of olive oil have often been attributed to its minor components; however, its oleic acid (OA) content (70–80%) is responsible for its many health properties. OA is an effective biomolecule, although the mechanism by which OA mediates beneficial physiological effects is not fully understood. OA influences cell membrane fluidity, receptors, intracellular signaling pathways, and gene expression. OA may directly regulate both the synthesis and activities of antioxidant enzymes. The anti-inflammatory effect may be related to the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of anti-inflammatory ones. The best-characterized mechanism highlights OA as a natural activator of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), derived from OA, is an endogenous ligand of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) nuclear receptor. OEA regulates dietary fat intake and energy homeostasis and has therefore been suggested to be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of obesity. OEA has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. The beneficial effects of olive oil may be related to the actions of OEA. New evidence suggests that oleic acid may influence epigenetic mechanisms, opening a new avenue in the exploration of therapies based on these mechanisms. OA can exert beneficial anti-inflammatory effects by regulating microRNA expression. In this review, we examine the cellular reactions and intracellular processes triggered by OA in T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils in order to better understand the immune modulation exerted by OA.
