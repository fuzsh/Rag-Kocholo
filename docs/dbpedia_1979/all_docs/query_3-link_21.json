        "text": "With Machado de Assis and Female Characterization, Earl Fitz makes an important contribution to the bibliography on Machado de Assis currently available in English, especially when it comes to studies of his fiction that privilege the analysis of gender roles. Consistent studies of this kind are not abundant in Portuguese, and in English are virtually non-existent. Fitz mentions only one book-length study on this topic published in English, Maria Manuel Lisboa's Machado de Assis and Feminism: Rereading the Heart of the Companion (1996), to which he pays tribute, as well as to Ingrid Stein's Figuras Femininas em Machado de Assis (1984) and Therezinha Mucci Xavier's A Personagem Feminina no Romance de Machado de Assis (2005), considering them some of the most useful pieces of Machadoan criticism produced in the last decades, not coincidentally having female characters at the center of their investigations. The recapture of the feminine question in Machado's work within the English-speaking academy was not only necessary, but overdue, since perhaps the main upheaval in Machadoan criticism during the twentieth century came from an American woman, scholar Helen Caldwell.\n\nThroughout the book, Fitz makes a strong effort to always look at female characterization as related to two other aspects: Machado's social awareness and his cutting-edge understanding of the nature of language. When it comes to the former, Fitz resorts to the writer's biographers and to the critics who privilege more socially-oriented readings of his writings, in order to advocate a non-programmatic, yet consistently progressive Machado. Many times, Fitz refers to Machado as a \"Republican sympathizer,\" committed to the symbolic construction of a \"new Brazil,\" made of \"new men\" and \"new women.\" When it comes to the latter, Fitz draws mostly on the tradition of linguistics and semiotics to propose that it was Machado's understanding of language as a self-referential reality that allowed him to stray from Realism and to devise a \"new narrative.\"\n\nIn the first chapter, \"Women as Characters in the Nineteenth-Century Brazilian Novel: The Tradition Out of Which an Internationalized Machado de Assis Would Emerge,\" Fitz focuses on Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, José de Alencar and Aluísio Azevedo, looking for early manifestations of feminine agency in Brazilian literature. He finds it, for instance, when Carolina, the protagonist of A moreninha (1844), by Macedo, reads Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Women (1792); and in the growing aggressiveness—thus, masculinity, or masculine-like empowerment—of Iracema, the title-character of José de Alencar's novel (1865). Fitz also finds female empowerment in the lesbian relationship between Léonie and Pombinha, in Aluísio Azevedos's O cortiço (1890), which is the object of the narrator's pathological description and moralist judgment, but in which Fitz reads the suggestion of \"the legitimacy of an 'exclusively female communitas,' which separates female sexual pleasure from conception and [End Page E17] motherhood, presents 'lesbianism with positive and desirable attributes,' and that serves as a 'critique of heterosexuality as a political institution'\" (Fitz 64).\n\nThe examination of Machado's novels takes place in two separate chapters: \"The Early novels of Machado de Assis: 1872–1878,\" and \"The Later Novels.\" The first one collects traces of \"gynocentric potency\" (83) in the drawing of the female leading characters of Ressurreição (1870), A mão e a luva (1874), Helena (1876) and Iaiá Garcia (1878). It begins with Ressurreição, a novel still built around a man, Félix, but a man with \"a fatal weakness, one that one of the women, Lívia could correct, if only he would allow her to do so\" (Fitz 81). In Fitz's reading, Lívia's originality and grandeur is a kind of antidote to Félix's obsessive, insecure and arrogant behavior—even if it is a medicine he refuses to take. A mão e a luva, on the other hand, has a woman at its..."
