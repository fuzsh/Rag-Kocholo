        "text": "1SassyLassy\n\nEdited: Sep 11, 2013, 3:44 pm\n\nWelcome to the fourth quarter of 2013 and South America, with co-leaders StevenTX and SassyLassy. This quarter will look at the countries of the Reading Globally divisions South America I and South America II.\n\nSouth America is an incredibly diverse continent, politically, linguistically, culturally and physically, with something for everyone. Its political divisions range from Brazil, with about half the continent's population, to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, a disputed overseas territory of the UK, also claimed by Argentina, with no permanent residents.\n\nA continent with over four hundred million people produces lots of writers, mostly published in the official languages of the various countries: Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch and English. Work is being done to publish in some of the indigenous languages. If you read Portuguese or Spanish, you're in for a treat, but as the language of Reading Globally is English, we have concentrated on books available in English translation. There's still lots to read and all suggestions are welcome.\n\nThere are some thematic similarities across the continent. Early South American authors were strongly influenced by writers of the colonial powers, so for example there was a nineteenth century Romantic movement in South America corresponding to the European one . This was followed by a move to deeper concerns about social and political realities, as in Europe. However, the abolition of slavery and independence movements were South American themes that crept in during the nineteenth century as nationalist movements developed. The twentieth century was an era of guerilla war in many South American countries, and these struggles, along with the corresponding struggles between landlord and peasant, are pervasive themes, often disguised as magic realism to evade censure or worse. Today, lawlessness and narcoterrorism are emerging themes.\n\nSome Background Reading\n\nSimon Bolivar\n\n- El Libertador: Writings of Simon Bolivar first person accounts of Bolivia, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela\n\nEduardo Galeano (see post 15 below)\n\nhis three volume Memory of Fire look at South America includes\n\n- Genesis\n\n- Faces and Masks\n\n- Century of the Wind\n\nErnesto Che Guevara\n\n- The Motorcycle Diaries: A Journey around South America\n\nAlfredo Toro Hardy\n\n- The World Turned Upside Down: The Complex Partnership between China and Latin America 2013\n\nEfrain Kristal ed\n\n- The Cambridge Companion to the Latin American Novel\n\nSuzanne Jill Levine\n\n- The Subversive Scribe: Translating Latin American Fiction\n\nRaymond Leslie Williams\n\n- The Postmodern Novel in Latin America: Politics of Culture and the Crisis of Truth\n\nMaps, maps, maps\n\nA very old map of South America\n\nAn 1826 map of South America showing historical political divisions\n\nLeft: South America today, Right: a physical map of South America\n\nLastly, a note on Spanish naming conventions\n\nSpanish often uses two family names, the paternal and the maternal. Looking at Hector Abad Faciolince, Abad is his first or paternal family name; Faciolince is his second or maternal family name. Sometimes when searching for these authors, the second family name is dropped and the search would be for Hector Abad.\n\n2SassyLassy\n\nEdited: Sep 10, 2013, 2:02 pm\n\nBRAZIL, population 201 million, official language Portuguese\n\nYou could think of Brazil as the keystone of South America. It is so large it borders on all the other countries except Chile and Ecuador. Half the population of South America lives here.\n\nBrazil will be in the international spotlight for the next while for a variety of reasons: it hosts next year's FIFA World Cup, it hosts the Summer Olympics in 2016, and from a literary standpoint, it is the guest of honour at this years's Frankfurt Book Fair. With any luck, that event should help to correct the 2007 complaint in The Guardian decrying the lack of English translations of current Brazilian literature.\n\nDespite the lack of current literature in translation, Brazil does have a wealth of older literature. The Brazilian Academy of Letters was founded in 1896. This was a turbulent time, just after two enormous events; the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the establishment of a military republic. The big three of nineteenth century Brazilian literature are Macedo, Machado and Alencar. All three wrote on the themes of independence from Portugal, won in 1822, and the abolition of slavery.\n\nBy the 1930s, hard times inspired writers to look at political and social concerns more critically, with one of the themes being the struggle between landlords and peasants. One of the most famous novels from this era is Graciliano Ramos's Barren Lives. Ramos will be the featured author at this year's Parati International Festival of Literature.\n\nThe Brazilian modernist movement of the 1940s sought to move to less formal, more representative language, as seen in the work of Adonias Filho.\n\nIncreasing political repression by the military starting in the 1950s and 1960s, led to a return to the themes of the '30s, but now criticism had to be disguised. Torture of the military regime's political opponents was sanctioned and in force from 1964-1985.

Balance trade in oil, emeralds, cut flowers, coffee and plastic against cocaine productions and an exceptionally high number of forced disappearances, and you have a picture of constant turmoil.\n\nEven the geography is a problem. One of the recurring intergovernmental disputes in South America is over national borders. Until 1830, Colombia, along with Ecuador and Venezuela formed the nation of Gran Colombia. Then Ecuador and Colombia seceded. In the twentieth century another chunk was hewn off to create Panama and advance American interests. Today, many Colombians leave on their own due to national turmoil, with Ecuador and Venezuela as their most likely destinations.\n\nDespite all this, or perhaps because of it, Colombia has a rich literary tradition. You could probably spend this entire South American quarter just reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Colombia's best known writer. While that would certainly be worthwhile, there are many other Colombian writers to discover.\n\nThe 19802 Nobel Prize citation for Garcia Marquez read ...\"for all his novels and short stories, in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination, reflecting a continent's life and conflict\". Magical realism has become almost synonymous with Garcia Marquez, while other writers have other concerns.\n\nThe 1940s and 1950s saw the rise of the Nadaismo or nothingist movement in response to the violence in society. Its surrealist component is exemplified by the work of Gonzalo Arango. Political violence in contemporary society became a major them for writers such as Evelio Rosero, Hector Abad Faciolince and Mario Mendoza.\n\nContemporary Colombian writers are sometimes lavelled as members of the McCondo movement, a short form for McDonald's, Mac products and condos. These writers deal with themes of war, emigration and narcoterrorism; a long way from magic realism, even further from the nineteenth century romantics.\n\nSan Pedro Claver Church, Cartagena, from the Guardian World Literature Tour: Colombia\n\nBackground Colombia, books\n\n- Gabriel Garcia Marquez: A Life by Gerald Martin\n\n- The Cambridge Introduction to Gabriel Garcia Marquez by Gerald Martin\n\n- Bandits, Peasants, and Politics: The Case of \"La Violencia\" in Colombia by Gonzalo Sanchez and Donny Meertens, 2001\n\n- Of Beasts and Beauty: Gender, Race and Identity in Colombia by Michael Stanfield, 2013\n\nJorge Isaacs\n\n- Maria, his only novel but regarded as one of the best nineteenth century South American novels\n\nMarta Traba, 1923-1983, art critic and novelist\n\n- Mothers and Shadows, a novel of the disappeared\n\nAlvaro Mutis, b. 1923\n\n- The Adventures and Misadventures of Maqroll\n\nFernando Vallejo, b.1942, now living in Mexico\n\n- Our Lady of the Assassins\n\nGustavo Alvarez Gardeazabal b.1945\n\n- Bazaar of the Idiots inverts the lives of saints and sinners\n\nHector Abad Faciolince, b.1958\n\n- Oblivion: A Memoir, a tribute to his father, murdered by Colombian paramilitaries\n\n- The Joy of Being Awake\n\n- Recipes for Sad Women\n\nEvelio Rosero, b. 1958, poet, playwright, novelist, writer of children's books, winner of the 2006 Primio Nacional de Literatura for \"a life in letters\"\n\n- The Armies, a novel about what happens to a village victimized by successive warring factions\n\n- Good Offices, satirizes the Catholic Church\n\n- The Burning Man\n\nJorge Franco\n\n- Paradise Travel\n\nJuan Gabriel Vasquez, b. 1973\n\n- The Informers, 2004\n\n- The Secret History of Costaguana, 2007, the NYT calls it \"a post modern revenge story\", with the object being Joseph Conrad\n\n- The Sound of Things Falling, 2013\n\nEduardo Garcia Aguilar\n\n- Boulevard of Heroes, \"a voyage into the soul of Latin America's radical old time activists\"\n\n- Luminous Cities\n\n- The Triumphant Voyage\n\nJames Canon\n\n- Tales from the Town of Widows and Chronicles from the Land of Men, what happens when all the men are kidnapped and what happens when they return four years later\n\nColombia: Nobel Prize for Literature, 1982\n\nGabriel Garcia Marquez, b. 1928, brought up by his grandparents, so his upbringing hearkened back to an earlier era\n\nfiction sampler:\n\n- No One Writes to the Colonel, 1961\n\n- One Hundred Years of Solitude, 1967\n\n- The Autumn of the Patriarch, 1975\n\n- Chronicle of a Death Foretold, 1981\n\n- Love in the Time of Cholera, 1983\n\n- Memories of My Melancholy Whores, 2004\n\nnonfiction:\n\n- The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor, 1970, a journalistic expose\n\n4SassyLassy\n\nEdited: Sep 11, 2013, 2:47 pm\n\nECUADOR, population 15.44 million, official language Spanish\n\nEcuador seems to be a land of untranslated poets. There's certainly a wealth of inspiration to be found there. The land mass was part of the northern Inca empire until 1533, when the Incas were defeated by the Spanish. It's split among Amazon rainforest in the Oriente region, Andean highland Sierra, and the Pacific coastal region. The Galapagos Archipelago also belongs to modern day Ecuador. This biodiversity led to Ecuador becoming the first country to recognize ecosystem rights in the constitution of 2008.\n\nTravellers can experience some of this diversity on this rebuilt railway featuring steam trains, the most difficult in the world, reopened this summer, running from Quito in the Highlands, travelling through the Valley of Volcanoes, to Quayaquil on the coast in four days.\n\nThe capital, Quito, was named a UNESCO world heritage site for having the best preserved city centre in Latin America. This is a gargoyle depicting one of the native animals on the Quito Basilica, a nineteenth century building:\n\nEcuador is by no means idyllic though. It is politically unstable with an average government life span of twenty months. The armed forces are an important political force. Peru has invaded Ecuador and there have been several border wars, the last one resolved as recently as 1999. The resource and agriculture based economy leads to boom and bust cycles. While many Ecuadorians emigrate seeking better economic opportunities, Ecuador receives the most refugees of any South American country, the vast majority of whom are from Colombia.\n\nBackground Ecuador, books\n\nThe Ecuador Reader: History, Culture, Politics, eds.

Unlike European France, however, it has a substantial Creole population at 30%. The Creole of French Guiana is related to and mutually intelligible with that of Haiti.\n\nHistorically, the French were largely unsuccessful in establishing permanent settlements in this region, so they made it a penal colony, sending prisoners to both mainland and island prisons. Starting in 1854, convicts were made to stay on in French Guiana after their release for a period equalling the length of their prison sentence. Alfred Dreyfus was imprisoned on the notorious Devil's Island, while Henri Charrière was a prisoner on the mainland, not on the island as his novel Papillon suggests.\n\nGiven the history and low population, there are few published writers.\n\nBackground French Guiana, books\n\nWomen and Slavery in the French Antilles 1635 - 1848 by Bernard Moitt\n\nBeyond Papillon: The French Overseas Penal Colonies 1854-1952 by Stephen Toth, 2008\n\nFrench Guiana, writers\n\nRené Jadfard 1899-1947\n\nLéon-Gontran Damas 1912-1978 a leading poet of the Negritude movement\n\n- Black Label and Other Poems (in French)\n\nGeorges Othily b.1944\n\nLotus Vingadassamy-Engel, author and expert on the Indian diaspora in South America\n\nLeft: A prison hulk in Toulon harbour\n\nRight: The hut on Devil's Island where the wrongfully convicted Dreyfus spent part of his imprisonment\n\n6SassyLassy\n\nEdited: Sep 11, 2013, 12:56 pm\n\nGUYANA population 740,000, official language English\n\nAlthough it is on the mainland of South America, culturally, Guyana is considered part of the Caribbean. Originally a Dutch possession, it passed to Britain, being renamed British Guiana in the process. The country achieved independence in 1966 and is now known as Guyana. As a holdover from colonial times, Guyana is engated in border disputes with neighbouring Venezuela and Suriname, and in marine boundary disputes with Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nGuyana is one of South America's poorest countries, with approximately one third of its population below the poverty line. Many middle class and educated Guyanese emigrate, leading to problems with the delivery of education and healthcare.\n\nThings are not all doom and gloom though.

Successive governments were unable or unwilling to do anything to relieve the endemic poverty, malnutrition and poor health of the peasant classes. Today, these problems are compounded by urban air pollution in Lima and other cities, and by water pollution from sewage and mining. Natural forces such as earthquakes and changing weather patterns cause more problems, particularly in agriculture. Peru still disputes its borders with Chile, Ecuador and Bolivia. In the nineteenth century, Japanese and Chinese workers were brought in for the coastal plantations. Their influence is still felt. Alberto Fujimori was elected president in 1990, defeating the author Mario Vargas Llosa. Today China is the largest recipient of Peruvian exports..\n\nIn the 1960s, a Maoist branch of the Communist Party of Peru, the Sondero Luminoso or Shining Path was established. It chose to boycott the 1980 elections rather than participate, and burned ballot boxes as a statement of its stance.

Venezuela gained independence from Spain in 1811. The full name of the country is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, giving credit to the liberator. A succession of military dictatorships interspersed with elected presidents governed the country until 1958. Since then, its leaders have been democratically elected.\n\nVenezuela has the world's largest oil reserves. This has been both a blessing and a curse, making the economy dependent upon the rise and fall of international oil supplies and prices.\n\nPoverty is an enormous problem in Venezuela.

In return, he brought the poverty rate down from about 50% in 1999 to 27% in 2011, but at a huge cost to infrastructure, neglected for years. Many of the current domestic problems such as blackouts and industrial disasters are related to this neglected infrastructure, although the authorities often blame them on mystery saboteurs. Inflation is currently running at about 45% a year, so the future doesn't look particularly smooth.\n\nFew Venezuelan authors have had their work translated, not even Arturo Uslar Pietri, the two time winner of the National Prize for Literature.

Though its name derives from the Latin word for silver, Argentina has no significant deposits of precious metals, so there was nothing to attract the conquistadores. A settlement was established at the location of modern Buenos Aires in 1536, but it was abandoned in 1542. A permanent settlement wasn’t established until 1580. Immigration was slow, mostly coming overland from Peru, Paraguay and Chile rather than directly from Spain.\n\nThe movement for independence from Spain in southern South America originated in Argentina with José de San Martin as its leader and national hero. Argentina declared its independence in 1816, and San Martin went on to help liberate all of the neighboring colonies. After a period of dictatorships, war, civil wars, and secessionist movements, Argentina settled down to a stable democratic government in the second half of the 19th century. Its combination of political freedom, economic opportunity and temperate climate triggered a wave of European immigration that lasted well into the 20th century. By the 1920s Argentina had become one of the world’s wealthiest and most cosmopolitan nations.\n\nTriggered by the worldwide Great Depression, a period of military coups, corrupt government and fraudulent elections lasted from 1930 until the 1940s. At times Argentina teetered on the brink of fascism, and became economically and socially isolated from the rest of the world. After World War II, a new leader emerged, Juan Perón. His policies of support for the poor and working classes, economic independence, and political isolationism gained Perón immense popular support in spite of his autocratic and sometimes brutal tactics. But runaway inflation cost Perón his popular support, and in 1955 he was deposed.\n\nArgentina’s history from 1955 to 1983 was chiefly a period of military dictatorship, though there were periods of leftist rule and the brief return to power of Juan Perón. The last phase of dictatorship, from 1976 to 1983, was particularly brutal and is known as the “Dirty War.” An estimated 30,000 people were “disappeared” by the military regime. It came to an end after Argentina’s attempt to enforce its claims of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands led to its military defeat by the United Kingdom. Constitutional rule returned in 1983 and has continued to this day, though not without periods of unrest due to economic difficulties.\n\nArgentina is now the richest per capita country in South America by some measures, second to Chile in others. Prosperity and a strong sense of cultural independence have led to an especially rich literary scene. The names listed below are just a representative sampling of the dozens of Argentine writers whose work has earned worldwide attention.\n\nArgentine Writers\n\nDomingo Faustino Sarmiento (1811-1888) was President of Argentina as well as one of the country’s leading intellectuals and educators. Under the dictatorship of Juan Manuel de Rosas, Sarmiento spent several years in exile in Chile. While in exile he wrote the book Facundo: Civilization and Barbarism (1845 as Facundo: Civilización y Barbarie), ostensibly a biography of Juan Facundo Quiroga, a violent gaucho leader known as the “Tiger of the Plains,” but actually an attack on Facundo’s political ally, Juan Manuel de Rosas. Presented as fact, the book draws so heavily on the author’s imagination that it is usually classed as historical fiction.\n\nJosé Hernandez (1834-1886) was a man of modest, rural origins who spent his life campaigning for the independence and preservation of Argentina’s gauchos, whose lifestyle resembled that of the American cowboy. His long poem Martín Fierro (first published in two parts, 1872 and 1879) is considered Argentina’s national epic. It is unusual as such in that the protagonist is an anti-hero, a deserter and later a robber, with no special qualities except a relentless desire to be his own man.\n\nW. H. Hudson (1841-1922), though of British ancestry and writing in English, is considered by Argentines to belong to their national literature where he is known as Guillermo Enrique Hudson. He spent the first 30 years of his life on the Argentine frontier studying the natural world and native customs. Most of his works are travel narratives and zoological studies, but he is best known for his exotic 1904 novel Green Mansions, a romance set in the jungles of Venezuela.\n\nEmilio Lascano Tegui (1887-1966) grew up in Buenos Aires and became a political radical with a passion for poetry. He would startle and amuse his audiences by breaking into verse in the middle of a speech. In his 20s he traveled and studied in Europe, where he made the acquaintance of such figures as Pablo Picasso and the surrealist Guillaume Apollinaire. He was something of an eccentric Bohemian, styling himself a viscount, but eventually settled down to a diplomatic career that included a posting as Argentine consul in Los Angeles. His novel On Elegance While Sleeping (1925 as De la elegancia mientras se duerme) is the surreal and macabre tale of a syphilitic French soldier who falls in love with a goat.\n\nJuan Filloy (1894-2000, yes, he lived to 105!) was a prolific writer but largely unknown during his lifetime because he never sought a readership. Born to illiterate parents, he became a lawyer and served as a judge. He had a playful passion for words, composing over 6000 palindromes. He was fluent in seven languages and wrote dozens of novels, most or all of which have titles seven letters long. His only work in English translation is Op Oloop (1934), a novel about a Finnish statistician whose clockwork life becomes unraveled when he misses and appointment due to a traffic delay.\n\nJorge-Luis Borges (1899-1986) is the most influential of all Argentine writers. He was born to a highly literate middle-class family and grew up reading Spanish and English with equal fluency. He spent several years of his youth in various European cities and was influenced by such literary schools as Futurism and Surrealism. Back in Argentina, he pursued a career in journalism while writing fiction. In 1939, after recovering from a severe illness, he developed his own unique voice, writing short stories that are fanciful constructs, often whimsical but sometimes terrifying, which draw the reader into a labyrinth of ideas that challenge their perception of reality. Of his several collections of stories, Ficciones (1944) is the best known.\n\nRoberto Arlt (1900-1942) was the son of immigrants and grew up speaking German at home. Arlt had a difficult childhood under an oppressive father and was expelled from school at age eight, working various odd jobs while becoming self-taught. He started writing fiction while working as an investigative journalist, and his novels reflect his harsh upbringing as well as the dark side life he saw in his investigations. His novel The Seven Madmen follows the escapades of a down-and-out inventor through the seamy side of 1920s Buenos Aires.\n\nErnesto Sabato (1911-2011) was, in his early years, both an MIT-trained physicist and a politically active communist. He abandoned both in disillusionment and, in the 1940s, began a full-time career as a writer. His novel The Tunnel (1948 as El túnel) draws subtly on the concepts of quantum physics to produce a haunting portrait of a man obsessed with destroying that which he loves.\n\nAdolfo Bioy-Casares (1914-1999) was the only son of a wealthy family and was able to devote his entire life to literature. He was a lifelong resident of Buenos Aires and a close friend and collaborator of Jorge Luis Borges. His short novel The Invention of Morel (1940 as La invención de Morel) is a fanciful examination of the nature of illusion and reality that draws on H. G. Wells’s novel The Island of Dr. Moreau.\n\nJulio Cortázar (1914-1984) was a key figure in Latin American literature. He was French on his mother’s side and was actually born in Belgium, not moving to Argentina until age 5. Raised in a suburb of Buenos Aires, he became school teacher at age 18 and eventually a professor of French literature, despite never having obtained a university degree himself. In 1951 he moved to France in opposition to the regime of Juan Perón and remained there the rest of his life. Cortázar’s most celebrated novel is Hopscotch (1966 as Rayuela), an autobiographical stream-of-consciousness novel which the reader can read in different versions by following alternative sequences of numbered chapters. But Cortázar is best known for his short fiction such as the title story of Blow-up and Other Stories (1968 as Ceremonias).\n\nManuel Puig (1932-1990), a native of Buenos Aires, turned to writing novels only after a failed career as a screenwriter for movies and television. A political leftist, Puig went into self-exile in Mexico in 1973 and remained there until his death. Yet his writings are often less political and more light-hearted than those of his contemporaries, and are filled with references to popular culture. His most serious and most widely read novel, Kiss of the Spider Woman (1976 as El beso de la mujer araña), is told almost entirely in the form of a dialogue between two prisoners: a gay man and a political activist.\n\nTomás Eloy Martínez (1934-2010) earned a degree in literature and worked most of his life as a journalist, at times in exile Venezuela and Mexico. In 1969, while working as a reporter in Paris, Martínez interviewed former president Juan Perón, then living in exile in Madrid. These interviews formed the basis for Martínez’s 1995 novel Santa Evita, a reflection on the life of Eva Perón described as “hallucinatory.”\n\nAbel Posse (b. 1934) was born to an aristocratic family. He began writing as a teenager, and after taking a law degree pursued parallel careers in letters and diplomacy. He served in a variety of posts under successive Argentine regimes, culminating in his appointment as ambassador to Spain from 2002 to 2004. During this time he also published fourteen novels, including Dogs of Paradise (1983 as Los Perros del Paraiso), a farcical retelling of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus.\n\nJuan-José Saer (1937-2005) was the child of Syrian immigrants. He grew up and was educated in Santa Fe Province, an agricultural region that would be central to most of his writing even though Saer spent most of his adult life living and teaching in France. His works often deal with the theme of self-exile. The Witness is an historical novel set in the 16th century about a 15-year-old cabin boy who voyages to the New World and is the sole survivor of an attack by cannibals.\n\nLuisa Valenzuela (b. 1938) grew up in Buenos Aires in a cultured household where writers such as Jorge Luis Borges and Ernesto Sabato were regular visitors. She started a career in journalism and traveled extensively before receiving, in 1969, a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the University of Iowa. Valenzuela lived in New York during the years of Argentina’s military dictatorship, returning to Buenos Aires in 1989. In her novels she explores the political world of the junta either directly, as in The Lizard’s Tail, or metaphorically, as in He Who Searches. Her novels and stories also develop themes of sexuality and gender relationships.\n\nRicardo Piglia (b. 1941) is one of Latin America’s most accomplished writers of crime fiction as well as being a scholar of South American literature. He is currently Emeritus Professor of Spanish American Literature at Princeton University. His detective novels such as The Absent City are also reflections upon Argentine history and the effects of dictatorship.\n\nOsvaldo Soriano (1943-1997) turned to parodic fiction when his articles were rejected as too left-wing by the newspaper which had employed him. During the rule of the military junta, Soriano lived in Europe, returning to Buenos Aires in 1984 where he worked as a screenwriter as well as a novelist. His most important work is Funny Dirty Little War, a look at the farcical basis for the regime behind Argentina’s “Dirty War.” There is a sequel titled Winter Quarters.\n\nCesar Aira (b. 1949) is a lifelong resident of Buenos Aires and an extremely prolific novelist, translator and critic, publishing at a sustained rate of two books per year. He describes his method of writing as a “flight forward,” in which he never reviews or revises what he has written but resorts instead to flights of fancy and linguistic gymnastics to keep the narrative going. In The Hare a 19th century English naturalist goes in search of a legendary flying hare, but is instead drafted by the Mapuche Indians into the search for their missing chief.\n\nLiliana Bodoc (b. 1958) is a writer and teacher from central Argentina. She is the author of The Days of the Deer, a best-selling historical fantasy that portrays the Spanish conquest of Argentina. It is the first book in a series called “Saga of the Borderlands.”\n\nAlicia Borinsky is a native of Buenos Aires but was educated in the U.S. and is currently the head of the Spanish Section at Boston University. She writes in Spanish, however, and has set most of her works in Buenos Aires. In novels such as Dreams of the Abandoned Seducer she takes a playful, postmodernist look at modern urban life and culture. Mean Women is a fictional portrait of powerful Hispanic women such as Eva Perón and Imelda Marcos.\n\nAnthologies\n\nContemporary Argentinean Women Writers: A Critical Anthology (1998) edited by Gustavo Fares and Eliana C.

A century before the arrival of the Spanish, the Aymara were the dominant group, though not the most numerous, ruling an empire from their capital Tiwanaku near Lake Titicaca. Then late in the 15th century the Incas came, extending their Andean empire south from Peru. In 1524 the Spanish arrived by way of Panama and the Pacific. The overextended Inca Empire fell quickly, as the invaders took advantage of the latent hostility between the Incas and the Aymara and other subject nations.\n\nBolivia (known at the time as Upper Peru) was a rich source of silver for the conquistadores, and for a time the city of Potosí was largest city in the western hemisphere. But Spain’s brutal exploitation of the Indian population led to a series of native revolts in the late 18th century. A Spanish army of 1200 men was defeated, and the capital of La Paz was put under siege for more than three months. Finally, in 1783 the Spanish Crown succeeded in suppressing the revolt and executed thousands of Indians and people of mixed race in reprisal.\n\nAt the time of the wars for independence, Bolivia was a land of mixed loyalties. It became a battleground between royalist forces from Peru and revolutionaries from Argentina. It remained mostly under royalist control, however, until 1825 when the forces of Simón Bolívar obtained a final victory over the Spanish. Upper Peru was renamed Bolivia in Bolívar’s honor. Bolivia had a promising start as a progressive, well-governed state, but its success went to the head of its president, Andrés de Santa Cruz, who declared Bolivia to be the successor state to the Inca Empire. Bolivia’s neighbors banded together for a pre-emptive war. By 1904 Bolivia had been stripped of much of its valuable territory and had become a landlocked nation.\n\nFor the first half of the 20th century, Bolivia was governed by an elite class of landowners while the large Indian population lived in severe poverty. In 1952, however, a revolutionary party seized power. Suffrage was made universal, the great estates were divided amongst the peasantry, and key industries were nationalized. Despite overwhelming public support, the liberal government was overthrown in 1964 by a CIA-backed military junta. Che Guevara joined Bolivians attempting to restore the revolutionary government, but was killed there in 1967. Civilian rule was finally restored in 1982, but for years Bolivia was plagued by a succession of weak and corrupt governments.\n\nBolivia is now South America’s poorest country. A majority of the population is classed as Native American and only 60% of the people are native speakers of Spanish, the official language. With its educational and economic disadvantages and turbulent political history, it is not surprising that Bolivia has produced very few writers of international repute.\n\nBolivian Writers\n\nJavier del Granado (1913-1996) was born to wealth and privilege but wrote poems about the pleasures of rural life and the traditions of Bolivia's native cultures. Eighteen of his poems were published in English in 1991 as Ballads and Sonnets of Javier del Granado, though this collection is no longer in print.\n\nJaime Saénz (1921-1986) spent almost his entire life in La Paz, and his surreal poetry reflects the darkness and decay of modern urban life. His collections in English translation include The Night (1984) and Immanent Visitor: Selected Poems of Jaime Saénz (2002).\n\nJuan de Recacoechea (b. 1935) lived for a decade in Europe working in the television industry before returning to Bolivia to become a novelist specializing in hard-boiled crime fiction. His novel American Visa, about a Bolivian man so desperate to get to the U.S. that resorts to crime, won international recognition. Andean Express is a murder mystery set on an epic railroad journey similar to Agatha Christie's Orient Express.\n\nJesús Urzagasti (1941-2013), a journalist, poet and novelist, came from a rural background in the Gran Chaco area of southern Bolivia. His novel In the Land of Silence has been translated into English. Its protagonist is a journalist and poet who is trapped in Bolivia’s recurring political violence. The story is narrated in three voices representing the journalist’s three alter egos.\n\nEdmundo Paz Soldán (b. 1967) is a Bolivian educated in the United States at Alabama and Berkeley. He is currently Professor of Spanish Literature at Cornell. He writes academically in both Spanish and English and has published a dozen novels in Spanish, two of which are available in English translation. In A Matter of Desire (2001) a professor in upstate New York has a forbidden romance with one of his students, then returns to Bolivia to uncover the secrets of his family's past. Turing's Delirium (2003), set in a near-future Bolivia, is described as a hybrid of cyberpunk and political thriller.\n\nAnthologies\n\nAndean Journeys: A Bilingual Anthology of Contemporary Bolivian Poetry edited by Ronald Haladyna.\n\nThe Fat Man from La Paz: Contemporary Fiction from Bolivia edited by Rosario Santos.

To the south, in the central valleys, the Mapuche had successfully repelled the Incas. Despite being decimated by European diseases, the Mapuche would put up a stiff resistance against the Spanish and were never completely conquered by them. Attracted to central Chile by its rich agricultural lands, the Spanish founded the capital of Santiago in 1541. For two centuries Chile remained a fairly poor colony, wracked by ongoing conflict with the Mapuche, and used chiefly to produce food for the Viceroyalty of Peru to the north.\n\nHaving begun to prosper only in the last decades of the 18th century, Chile was sharply divided on the question of independence from Spain. Even among those in favor of independence there were intense rivalries and ideological divisions. Chile first shook off Spanish rule in 1810, but a civil war between rival factions opened the country to re-conquest by Madrid in 1814. The pro-Independence forces prevailed again in 1818 and established a republic, but the last royalist forces weren’t defeated for another ten years.\n\nThough there were periods of autocratic rule, Chile enjoyed a century of relative peace, stability and progress, at least by South American standards. Chile abolished slavery in 1823, decades ahead of most American nations. Political power remained in the hands of wealthy landowners, however, until the early 1920s when the growing urban classes managed to elect a reformist president. No sooner was a package of reforms passed by Congress than a military coup overthrew the elected government in 1924. Civilian rule returned in 1932 with liberals and conservatives alternating in power and both pushing economic and social reforms.\n\nUnder the conservative government elected in 1964 change wasn’t coming as fast as promised, so in 1970 the Chileans elected Marxist Salvador Allende as the head of a coalition of left-wing parties. Part of Allende’s platform included the nationalizing of U.S. interests in Chile’s copper mines. The CIA became actively involved, opposing Allende’s election and attempting to sabotage his regime by funding opposition groups. The initial results of Allende’s reforms were highly favorable, with strong economic growth and shrinking unemployment. Runaway inflation set in, however, and a black market economy developed. Allende’s growing ties to the KGB fueled opposition internally and abroad, and Western governments and institutions worked openly to destabilize Chile’s economy. In 1973 a military coup overthrew the government and Allende committed suicide.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1990 Chile was ruled by a military junta headed by General Augusto Pinochet. The regime privatized and deregulated Chile’s economy and succeeded in bringing inflation under control. But it did so by brutally suppressing opposition and curtailing civil freedoms. Tens of thousands were killed, imprisoned or tortured, and as many went into self-exile, including many of Chile’s artists and intellectuals. In 1980 a new constitution was established that allowed for a gradual return to democracy, and in 1989 Pinochet was finally voted out of power. Since 1990 Chile has enjoyed a stable democratic government.\n\nChile is on a par with Argentina economically. In measures of public health and education it leads South America and surpasses a number of European nations. Chileans call their country the “Land of Poets,” and a Chilean poet was the first Latin American to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nChilean Writers\n\nGabriela Mistral (1889-1957) was the first Latin American, and so far the only Latin American woman, to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Her real name was Lucila Godoy Alcayaga. She was raised in poverty by her mother in a small Andean village and supported her family in her teenage years by working as a seamstress and a teacher’s assistant. Mistral published her first poems at age fifteen, and ten years later received national recognition in a literary contest. She rose rapidly in prominence as both a writer and educator despite her own lack of formal education. Her poems, which are published in a variety of collections, deal with themes of nature, love, and national identity. Loss and grief are also common themes, as Mistral several times suffered the loss of a loved one due to accidental death or suicide.\n\nPablo Neruda (1904-1973) was the pen name of Neftali Ricardo Reyes Basoalto. He chose “Neruda” in honor of the Czech poet Jan Neruda. He was a politically active member of Chile’s communist party, spent years in exile when the party was outlawed, and was later nominated for president, but gave his support instead to fellow Marxist Salvador Allende. Neruda is especially known for his love poetry, which can be found in collections such as Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1971.\n\nMaría Luisa Bombal (1910-1980) came from a privileged background and was educated in Paris where she moved among Europe's literary elite. Upon her return to Chile, however, she entered an unhappy marriage that resulted in a failed suicide attempt. Upon her recovery she fled to Argentina where Pablo Neruda, then consul in Buenos Aires, took her under his wing. She later lived in the United States, returning to Chile in 1971. She was an early pioneer of Magical Realism. Her novel House of Mist is the story of a young bride unhappily married to a cold-hearted Chilean landowner. The five stories in New Islands: And Other Stories each portray a woman struggling to fit the role society expects of her.\n\nJosé Donoso (1925-1996) spent his life in Chile except for a period of voluntary exile during the Pinochet regime. His dark, surreal novels explore themes of identity and sexuality in a disintegrating society. The Obscene Bird of Night is about a hideously deformed aristocrat who is made to believe he is normal by being surrounded by persons with the same deformity.\n\nÓscar Hahn (b. 1938) started writing poetry as a child. He received his university education in the United States and was a member of the International Writers' Program at the University of Iowa. Shortly after returning to Chile in 1973 he was arrested by the military government and imprisoned. The following year he returned to the U.S. as a permanent resident. His volumes of poetry include The Art of Dying (1977), Stolen Verses and Other Poems (1995), and Ashes in Love (2009).\n\nAntonio Skármeta (b. 1940) is of Croatian ancestry. During the Pinochet regime he left Chile, eventually settling in Berlin. Later he served for several years as Chile’s ambassador to Germany. He is active in film and television as well as literature. His most celebrated novel, The Postman (1985 as Ardiente paciencia) tells the touching story of a shy young postman who attempts to woo his beloved with the poetry of Pablo Neruda.\n\nIsabel Allende (b. 1942) is perhaps the most widely read Spanish-language author today. She is a cousin of former president Salvador Allende and spent much of her life in exile but was never directly involved in politics. She now resides in California and has become an American citizen. Her initial career was in journalism and television, but she became a novelist on the advice of Pablo Neruda whom she interviewed. Her first novel, The House of the Spirits (1982 as La casa de los espíritus) remains her most important to date. It is a family saga set in post-colonial Chile and incorporates elements of magical realism.\n\nAriel Dorfman (b. 1942) was born in Argentina of Ukrainian ancestry but became a Chilean citizen in 1967 and has since divided his time between Chile and the United States. He is currently a professor at Duke University. Much of Dorfman’s writing deals with dictatorship and its aftermath, including his award-winning play Death and the Maiden. His novels include The Nanny and the Iceberg, (1999 as La Nana y el Iceberg), a bizarre story in which sexual prowess is a metaphor for political power.\n\nDiamela Eltit (b. 1949) was one of the few writers to remain in Chile during the Pinochet dictatorship. She framed her protest against that regime in more ambiguous and abstract forms, representing dance, for example, as a metaphor for freedom and repressed desire as a symbol of political repression. Eltit currently teaches creative writing at New York University. Her novels include The Fourth World (1988 as El cuarto mundo) in which a pair of twins converses and competes while still in the womb.\n\nLuis Sepúlveda (b. 1949) was a member of Salvador Allende’s administration, then was jailed for more than two years by the Pinochet regime. After being released to house arrest, Sepúlveda went underground, then into exile, fleeing through much of South America. He later volunteered in the Nicaraguan revolution and served as a crewmember on a Greenpeace ship. His novels are strongly influenced by German romanticism and include The Old Man Who Read Love Stories (1989 as Un Viejo que leía novelas de amor), the poignant tale of a villager in the Ecuadoran jungle watching the world change around him.\n\nRoberto Bolaño (1953-2003) was Chilean by birth, though he spent virtually all of his adult life in Mexico and Spain. He is the author of a number of novels, several of them published posthumously. The Savage Detectives is a complex, partly autobiographical novel told in multiple voices but never that of the principal characters, two poets on a sort of global road trip in search of themselves.\n\nAlberto Fuguet (b. 1964) is a Chilean-born novelist, journalist and filmmaker who now lives in California. He writes in Spanish. His works in translation include Bad Vibes (1992) and The Movies of My Life (2002), both portraying a young protagonist caught between the hollow appeal of American consumerism and the realities of Chile's military dictatorship.\n\nAnthologies\n\nThe Alteration of Silence: Recent Chilean Poetry (2013) edited by Galo Ghigliatto and William Allegrezza\n\nChilean Poets: A New Anthology (2011) edited by Jorge Etcheverry.\n\nSecret Weavers: Stories of the Fantastic by Women Writers of Argentina and Chile (1991) edited by Marjorie Agosín\n\nWhat Is Secret: Short Stories by Chilean Women (1995) edited by Marjorie Agosín\n\n13StevenTX\n\nEdited: Sep 11, 2013, 9:32 am\n\nFALKLAND ISLANDS, population 2,932, official language English\n\nKnown in Latin America as the Malvinas, the Falkland Islands were uninhabited when they were first discovered by Europeans. Though there is some evidence that the Portuguese knew of the islands, the earliest documented sighting was by the English explorer John Davis in 1592. The name “Falkland” wasn’t acquired until almost a century later when another English captain visited the islands and named them in honor of the English nobleman who had financed his expedition.\n\nThe first colony was established by the French in 1764 who called the archipelago the Îles Malouines, naming them after the French port of Saint-Malo. It is from this name that the Spanish designation Malvinas is derived. Two years later the British established a settlement elsewhere in the islands. Soon afterwards the Spanish claimed the Falklands, and a period of claims, counter-claims, settlements and withdrawals resulted in there being no permanent inhabitants on the islands, but with Spain and Britain both claiming ownership. After winning its independence from Spain, Argentina laid claim to the islands as well.\n\nThe British re-colonized the islands in the 1830s and 40s, and those colonists are the basis of the island’s current population. In the 1960s and 70s, however, the islands became increasingly linked to Argentina economically, which led to renewed Argentine interest in asserting its claims there. From 1975 relations between Argentina and the United Kingdom began to sour. In 1982 Argentine special forces invaded and occupied the Falklands. The U.K. responded with force, and in a short war recovered the islands two months later. Argentina’s humiliating defeat was one factor in the fall of its ruling military junta and the return of democracy there in 1983.\n\nThe Falkland Islands remains a British Overseas Territory with a population of fewer than 3,000. The chief industry is sheep farming. Argentina has not relinquished its claim to the islands, however, so the U.K. maintains a military presence as well.\n\nErnest H. Spencer, a Falklander retired and now living in England, is the only writer whose name is associated with the Falklands. His work has not been published, but here is an extract found online of his poem titled “Motherland”:\n\n“Hail Falklands Motherland!\n\nSo wild and yet so free\n\nHail nature’s shining strand\n\nOf pearls set in the sea.”\n\n14StevenTX\n\nEdited: Sep 11, 2013, 9:33 am\n\nPARAGUAY, population 6.6 million, official languages Spanish and Guarani\n\nThe Guarani, a semi-nomadic people, were the original inhabitants of Paraguay, and the Guarani language is today an official language of the country along with Spanish. Paraguay was one of the first regions of South America to be permanently settled by the Spanish. The first explorers entered the region in 1516 and founded a settlement there in 1526. That settlement was abandoned, but in 1537 a new community named Asunción was established. Asunción is today the capital of Paraguay and one of the oldest cities in the Americas.\n\nIn 1588 the Spanish church and crown granted the Jesuits an unusual degree of autonomy over Paraguay. The Society organized the Guarani population into a number of communal settlements known as reducciones. Over the next 200 years these communities grew in wealth, power and cultural accomplishments until they were seen as a threat by the Spanish colonists. After a series of raids and armed conflicts between royalist forces on one side and Jesuit-led Guaranis on the other, the Spanish king expelled the Jesuits from Paraguay and disbanded the reducciones.\n\nParaguay achieved its independence from Spain in 1811. At that time its boundaries were much more extensive than they are today. A disastrous war against the combined forces of Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina in the mid-19th century stripped Paraguay of much of its territory. The landlocked nation has remained relatively impoverished and underdeveloped since that time. Paraguay has also suffered from a succession of brutal dictatorships and civil wars, culminating in the regime of Alfredo Stroessner who ruled the country from 1954 to 1989. Since 1989 Paraguay’s political history has been contentious but largely democratic with much greater freedoms and respect for human rights.\n\nParaguayan Writers\n\nAugusto Roa Bastos (1917-2005) left Paraguay for exile in Argentina in 1947, then France in 1976. He did most of his writing in exile, returning to Paraguay in 1989. He developed his own version of magical realism by incorporating Guarani words and myths into his writing. His most notable work is the novel I, the Supreme (1974, Yo el supremo), a fictionalized account of Paraguay’s first dictator, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, who ruled the newly-formed country from 1814 to 1840. The novel is considered a direct condemnation of Alfredo Stroessner, who was ruling Paraguay at the time, but also a study of the phenomenon of Latin-American dictatorship in general. It is a complex, symbolic work with multiple lines of narration.\n\nNestor Amarilla (b. 1980) was born in humble circumstances in rural Paraguay but received a university education in the United States. Since returning to Paraguay he has worked in theater and television as actor, producer, director and playwright. His plays include Saved by a Poem: Fecha Feliz, a depiction of the harsh realities of rural life under dictatorship in the 1970s.\n\nAnthologies\n\nBeyond the Rivers: An Anthology of Twentieth Century Paraguayan Poetry, edited by Charles R.

The Charrúas successfully repelled the first attempts at colonization, and Uruguay remained largely unsettled by Europeans for the rest of the century. The first permanent settlement wasn’t founded until 1624. The capital of Montevideo was first established as a Portuguese settlement in the 1680s. In 1724 the Spanish drove out the Portuguese as part of a general effort to limit the encroachment from neighboring Brazil.\n\nIn 1811 Uruguayans in league with the northern provinces of Argentina successfully revolted against Spanish rule. But the Portuguese, alarmed by the presence of anti-colonial forces so close to Brazil, invaded the league and annexed Uruguay to Brazil. The war with Argentine forces continued, however, and resulted in a treaty in 1828 which created the modern state of Uruguay. In 1831 the last resisting Charrúa people were massacred, leaving Uruguay with a population almost entirely of pure European extraction.\n\nUruguay was almost immediately plunged into a civil war between liberal and conservative factions. The 13-year conflict drew considerable world-wide attention and resulted in the intervention of European adventurers including Giuseppe Garibaldi. The liberals finally prevailed in 1852. Progressive government and economic opportunity brought a wave of immigration from Europe in the second half of the 19th century, principally from Italy and Spain. Montevideo became, like nearby Buenos Aires, a cosmopolitan city with strong cultural ties to Europe.\n\nThe country became briefly the focus of world attention in 1939 during the first months of World War II when the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee took refuge in the neutral harbor of Montevideo. Cornered there by the Royal Navy, the ship's captain evacuated and scuttled his ship in the harbor.\n\nUruguay’s prosperity began to fade in the mid-20th century as world demand for its agricultural products steadily declined. With poverty on the rise, urban guerilla groups began active resistance to the government. This led, in 1972, to the declaration of a state of emergency and the establishment of a dictatorship. Uruguay’s military rulers imprisoned and tortured their opponents, and many of the country’s intellectuals went into exile abroad. Uruguay’s dictatorship was not as brutal or bloody, however, as contemporary regimes in Argentina, Chile, and Paraguay. After massive public demonstrations, the military agreed to a return to civilian rule in 1985.\n\nUruguay’s democratic government has weathered a number of economic crises since 1985. Living standards are well above Latin American averages. In recent years Uruguay has become a global pioneer in such social issues as gay rights and the legalization of marijuana.\n\nUruguayan Writers\n\nHoracio Quiroga (1878-1937) was born in Uruguay, but his favorite habitat was the jungles of Misiones Province, Argentina. A man of wide interests, his literary endeavors were inspired by the poems and short stories of Edgar Allan Poe. His darkest stories have been collected in The Decapitated Chicken and Other Stories (1925) and The Exiles and Other Stories (1926).\n\nDelmira Agustini (1886-1914) was the daughter of affluent Italian immigrants. She began writing poetry at age 10. Her love poetry used exotic imagery and a degree of eroticism rare for that time and place. Her life was cut tragically short when her estranged husband shot Agustini in the head, then killed himself. There is speculation that it was a suicide pact rather than a murder/suicide. Her poetry has been published in a bilingual edition: Selected Poetry of Delmira Agustini: Poetics of Eros\n\nJuan-Carlos Onetti (1909-1994) held a variety of jobs before publishing his first novel at the age of 30. He worked as a journalist, living from 1943 to 1955 in Argentina, and served at one time as director of Montevideo’s municipal libraries. In 1974 he was arrested by the military dictatorship and imprisoned for six months in a mental institution. Upon his release, Onetti went into exile in Spain where he remained until his death. His novels and short stories typically focus on urban decay and despair. Many are set in the fictional city of Santa Maria, including his most famous work, The Shipyard. It is the Kafkaesque story of an aging man who returns from exile to manage a dilapidated shipyard but is constantly faced with the absurdity of the enterprise.\n\nCarlos Martínez Moreno (1917-1986) had worked as a reporter in Montevideo for several years before winning a short story contest in 1944. He continued to work as a journalist while writing fiction until 1978 when his home was bombed by a right-wing terror squad. He fled Uruguay, first to Spain, and then to Mexico where he remained until his death. His novel El Infierno (1988 and published in English translation under a shortened form of its Spanish title El color que el infierno me escondiera) depicts the uprising of urban guerillas in Montevideo which led up to the 1972 military coup.\n\nEduardo Galeano (b. 1940) began his career as a journalist in the 1960s, regularly expressing his leftist politics and a passion for football (soccer). In 1973 Galeano was arrested by the military junta, then sent into exile, first to Argentina, and then (when that country fell to a rightist regime) to Spain. He returned to Uruguay in 1985. His writings are a mixture of fiction, non-fiction, and unclassifiable works. Among the last is his grand trilogy Memory of Fire, a history of the Americas—focusing on Latin America—told in the form of miniature vignettes shifting constantly from scene to scene across the hemisphere. An earlier work of his, Open Veins of Latin America, examines the same history with a more analytical approach. The book received worldwide attention three years ago when the late President Hugo Chavez gave a copy of it to President Barack Obama during a summit meeting.\n\nCristina Peri-Rossi (b. 1941) was born in Montevideo, the daughter of Italian immigrants. She studied literature in Uruguay and had begun her writing career when the dictatorship came to power in 1972. Peri-Rossi went into exile in Spain and began writing against the Uruguayan government. The Spanish government under Franco expelled her for this, so she lived in Paris until Franco’s death when she moved to Barcelona and took Spanish citizenship. She writes both verse and prose from a feminist and leftist perspective. The Ship of Fools (1984) is considered her most significant prose work. It is a broad satire of modern society through the eyes of a traveler who is always the outsider.\n\nCarolina De Robertis was born to an Uruguayan family in England and makes her permanent home in California, but has spent time in Uruguay and has made South America the setting for her novels. She writes in English and Spanish and is an activist for LGBT causes and women's rights. She has published two works of historical fiction focusing on women: The Invisible Mountain (2009), set in Uruguay, and Perla (2012), set in Argentina.\n\nAnthologies\n\nHotel Lautreamont: Contemporary Poetry from Uruguay (2011) edited by Kent Johnson and Roberto Echevarren.\n\n16rebeccanyc\n\nSep 11, 2013, 5:28 pm\n\nWow!

My plan is to concentrate on Colombia. I want to read more Garcia Marquez. Also, I just read The Sound of things Falling as an early reviewer, and really recommend it. I am going to try to find some of Vaquez's earlier work as well. And maybe also Laura Restrepo\n\n21rebeccanyc\n\nSep 12, 2013, 7:37 am\n\nAnopiophora, what a great list of works by women writers -- I'll have to peruse that too.\n\nSassyLassy, I sometimes worry about the size of my TBR. Some of those books have been on it since the 70s or 80s. Obviously, I won't read all of these now, and may try to concentrate on the more obscure (after all, I know I'll always read MVL). It is thanks to LT and my system of tagging by country of the author that I could even know I have some of these books -- now, of course, I have to find them on my shelves!\n\n22chrisharpe\n\nEdited: Sep 12, 2013, 10:51 am\n\nThose are preparing to read some of these titles may like to have a look at (or join) the South American Fiction group: http://www.librarything.com/groups/southamericanfictio.

Quito must be the only place that has such a gargoyle. As I remember, the Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús (Church of the Society of Jesus) is the name of the amazing baroque church that was constructed by a workforce largely made up of indigenous people whose treetrunk and liana lookalike columns give the feeling of entering a forest. There are many details of local fauna and flora. It is a UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site.\n\n24SassyLassy\n\nEdited: Sep 12, 2013, 11:45 am\n\nThanks so much for this link, it looks like a great group.

Looking forward to your contributions.\n\nETA >23 chrisharpe: we crossposted, so I missed you comment. I had a great time looking at pictures of Quito and its architecture. The railway really inspired me too. There is a travel article in The Guardian on Ecuador and the thought of the trip from Quito to Quayaquil has been added to my dreams of the Trans Siberian Railway and the Orient Express, as well as the train across Norway to the coast.\n\n25StevenTX\n\nSep 12, 2013, 11:51 am\n\n#23 - I've seen The Devil to Pay in the Backlands on many \"greatest book\" lists and have long had it on my wishlist, but the English translation is long out of print, and used copies sell for $300 or more.

The amount of work both of you did is amazing. I have done so little reading in this area that your research will be of great help. I have read two books by Daniel Alarcon, Lost City Radio and War by Candlelight, both of which I thoroughly enjoyed. I also read Love in the Time of Cholera a very long time ago, but I remember it as a wonderful read. I'll begin getting ready for this read by researching the some of the books you've listed above.\n\n29ELiz_M\n\nEdited: Sep 12, 2013, 10:37 pm\n\nThank you for the research and the lovely pictures!\n\nA couple more titles by South American women authors on my tbr list that I did not see mentioned above:\n\nBreakthrough by Mercedes Valdivieso\n\nThe Impenetrable Madam X by Griselda Gambaro\n\nTechnically not written by a South American, but might be an interesting resource:\n\nMagic Eyes: Scenes from an Andean Childhood by Wendy Ewald\n\n30chrisharpe\n\nSep 13, 2013, 1:16 am\n\nLet me add my congratulations on your exemplary introduction, SassyLassy and StevenTX. This has clearly taken a lot of work to compile and I can see that you have gone out of your way to provide something much more refreshing than the typical view of the dominant media. Fascinating! Somehow I was not aware that this South America read was going on, but now I'm enthused by your introduction to pick something! Thank you!\n\n31msjohns615\n\nEdited: Sep 17, 2013, 2:11 pm\n\nI recommend both Rolena Adorno's Colonial Latin American Literature: A Very Short Introduction and Roberto González Echevarría's Modern Latin American Literature: A Very Short Introduction. Together, they give a broad and thoughtful overview of the region's literature from Columbus to the present.\n\nGonzález Echevarría's been one of the most influential critics of the past few decades, and he also wrote the introduction for the 2003 University of California Press translation of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's Facundo: Civilization and Barbarism. It's hard to overstate the importance of the \"Civilización y barbarie\" paradigm, and Sarmiento's book is also seen as establishing the genre of the dictator novel, even though it's not a novel per se, but a sprawling exposition of the Argentine reality during the reign of Juan Manuel de Rosas. Many, myself included, find Facundo to be a bit of a slog, and a lot of people read the first four chapters, including the one where he basically creates the paradigm for the character of the gaucho, and call it a day. I think if you can access this translation at your local library, it's really worth checking out, perhaps for the introduction alone.\n\nAlso, the so-called \"Telluric Narratives,\" or Novelas de la tierra, are worth returning to. I think it's fair to say that they were somewhat forgotten, or looked down upon, after Carlos Fuentes shat on them at the beginning of La nueva novela hispanoamericana (1969). His beef was that, in their obsession with describing the Latin American land (\"they were swallowed up by the jungle!\"), they represented a necessary but obsolete, almost \"pre-modern\" phase in the region's literary history. While that may have been true at the time, I think that they've aged rather well. I recently re-read José Eustaquio Riviera's La vorágine (Fuentes refers directly to this book in his comment about jungles devouring novels), and enjoyed it rather more than some of the \"Boom\" novels I'd read in recent years. Anyway, my point is that books like Rómulo Gallegos' Doña Bárbara and Ricardo Güiraldes' Don Segundo Sombra are well worth your time. Doña Bárbara is working rather clearly with Sarmiento's dichotomy, so it would be a good read alongside Facundo.\n\nMoving backwards in time, some of the 19th century classics would be fun to read in comparison with 19th century European and North American literature. The categories--Romanticism, Realism, Naturalism--aren't easily mappable onto the continent's literature, and it is problematic to speak of European influence in many cases for a number of reasons ... anyway, I'd suggest reading these books alongside Doris Sommer's Foundational Fictions, which provides an explanation of how nation-building and fiction-writing went hand-in-hand in Latin America. Here are some suggestions:\n\nSab could be thought of, roughly, as a Hispano-Cuban Uncle Tom's Cabin. Its joint consideration of race and gender issues is quite compelling, and the author, Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda, occupies an interesting sort of joint position in Cuban and Spanish literary history.\n\nMaría honestly bores the crap out of me, but if you don't drown in Efraín's tears before you get a hundred pages in, you should find plenty of interesting stuff, especially if you like Romantic literature. It's also, that I can think of, the first continental bestseller in terms of Latin American novels.\n\nAves sin nido (Torn from the Nest), by the Peruvian author Clorinda Matto de Turner, represents an important turning point in Latin American indigenista literature, in that it passes from the romanticization of the indigenous peoples in books like José de Alençar's Iracema, to a concern with social justice. From there, if you're interested in literature from the Andean nations that focuses on these issues, you could continue on to Jorge Icaza's Huasipungo, and then move on to the Peruvian José María Argüedas, without question one of the most important authors of 20th century Latin America.\n\nAnyway, I just think that going back to the \"pre-Boom\" classics of Latin American literature is worth the effort, because there's a lot of great books that were, in a way, condemned by the Boom authors as representing an \"immature\" stage in the region's literature. Now, in 2013, that judgment carries far less weight, although their reasons for making it are understandable.\n\nAll the books I've mentioned should be available in translation, although it might be hard to find Rivera's The Vortex, as I believe it's been out of print for some time.\n\nOne final note: if you're into poetry and literary criticism, Josefina Ludmer's The Gaucho Genre is awesome!\n\n32kidzdoc\n\nEdited: Sep 23, 2013, 5:49 am\n\nThanks to Steven and Sassy for providing superb background information and author recommendations, and to everyone else for their additional information.\n\nI have over two dozen works of South American literature in my TBR pile.

Shocking. You are in for a treat, IMO. I think that you will also like House of the Spirits. I re-read it recently, and it held up well, even though I have been disappointed with Allende's more recent works.\n\n34rebeccanyc\n\nSep 23, 2013, 7:37 am\n\nNice list, Darryl. I reread One Hundred Years of Solitude a few years ago, having read it back in the 70s, after reading the first (and so far only?) volume of Garcia Marquez's autobiography, Living To Tell the Tale. I also reread Love in the Time of Cholera, which I liked better.\n\n36Settings\n\nEdited: Sep 28, 2013, 5:45 pm\n\nI finished Mean Women by Alicia Borinsky, which was more a stream of images and scenes strung together than a story with a beginning and an end. The repeated symbols tie the book together. A published review describe it as \"horrifying yet humorous,\" but as always happens for me, I only get the horror and none of the humor. The Spanish title is \"Mina Cruel\" but I don't understand enough Spanish to know how that sounds, or if represents the book better than \"Mean Women\".\n\nFive stars, fantastic book.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"Can we come out of our lethargy and do the same? Forget about our bunions, the gas bill, this itching and then come up with an expression of eternity so that the whole neighborhood can know, join in, and make the tragedy greater?\"\n\n\"Something of this atmosphere oozes out and pools between the toes.\"\n\n\"She floated for eight hours on the river of tears and later was absorbed by the earth and then turned into a sharp blade of yellow grass that even the caterpillars refused to creep over.\"\n\n37lriley\n\nEdited: Sep 28, 2013, 6:58 pm\n\nGreat great work by SassyLassy and StevenTX--whatever happened though to the great Chilean poet Nicanor Parra who gave to this world anti-poetry. By the way he will be 100 years old next September and last I knew he was still going strong. Maybe the most irreverent Latin American writer of all time and a big hero to Roberto Bolano--well and to me too. I'll also mention a pretty good Argentine Mempo Giardinelli.\n\n38SassyLassy\n\nOct 2, 2013, 4:30 pm\n\nBack after over two weeks without a computer. I found some books from South America on my travels and managed to read two from that area; reviews to follow once I get back to normal life.\n\nThanks to everyone for the additional suggestions. I suspect some are more difficult to find than others.\n\n>31 msjohns615: Comparing some of the nineteenth century classics to European classics from the same era is something I'm looking forward to, as that is a favourite era of mine.\n\ndoc, that's quite a TBR you have there. If you have that many on this area, I can only imagine that total! I just started The Green House today. Looking forward to your thoughts on it and some of those other books. Thanks for the sad update about Mutis and thanks for the link. Ninety is pretty impressive, as is the one hundred mentioned by lriley.\n\n>36 Settings: Certainly sounds like an interesting book. I'll look for that one.\n\n>37 lriley: I think we could do a whole year on South American poets. I knew there were a lot of them, but had no idea just how many until I started working on this quarter. Unfortunately, not many of them seem to have been translated into English, although I did see quite a few translations into French and Italian.\n\n39Settings\n\nOct 2, 2013, 7:31 pm\n\n>38 SassyLassy:\n\nI started The Green House a couple months ago, but I gave up on it because I had no idea what was going on. Too many people to remember, too many plots. I'll be really interested on your opinion, I might have to give it another try.\n\n40lriley\n\nOct 2, 2013, 7:46 pm\n\n#39--one thing I often do when reading a book with multiple plot lines and tons of characters is take a sheet of paper and start writing names down whether characters--places-interrelationships--enmities. Break them down into lists. It helps me anyway to keep track of even obscure people, events and places in the book. That sheet of paper can also serve as a book marker.\n\n#38--Parra has had several works translated into english. A lot of his work is topical to current event but also Chilean history--he has a wonderfully ribald streak. He loves to play the nasty self-centered old coot or the demented religious crank when discoursing on these things. Not only was he Bolano's favorite poet--he's mine as well--Zbigniew Herbert comes in second.\n\n41msjohns615\n\nOct 3, 2013, 3:50 pm\n\nlriley: yeah, Parra is irresistible, and he got a very major \"consecration\" last year when he won the Cervantes Prize.\n\nThe Cervantes Prize Wikipedia page is actually another really good resource for those interested in Hispanic literatures. It was invented the year after Franco's death (again, according to Wikipedia), and is something akin to a Nobel Prize in Literature for writers who write in Spanish.\n\nI also neglected to mention one extremely important category in Latin American literature: Modernismo. Many scholars will remind you in that the use of the word modernism as an aesthetic category, in the way we often used it now, originated with Rubén Darío and company. Sometimes it seems like they do that just to recognize that they're \"hip\" to the literatures of Latin America. Anyway, when people talk about aesthetic modernism, they are using a term that's more or less of Latin American origin (correct me if I'm wrong, these disputes over words and their origins are always tricky).\n\nI'm not really up to date on any particularly recommendable English language translations of modernista poetry. Darío is obviously central. His Azul is often thought of as the beginning of the movement. Anyone with an interest in Latin America's cultures and literatures should also read José Martí's famous crónicas posthaste. A classic modernista novel that's been translated into English is José Asunción Silva's De sobremesa (In English as After-Dinner Conversation: The Diary of a Decadent. Delmira Agustini, the Uruguayan poet, is also well worth our time.\n\n42lilisin\n\nOct 3, 2013, 4:57 pm\n\n32 -\n\nCaptain Pantoja and the Special Service is such a wonderful book. I don't think a book has made me laugh so hard since then.\n\n43StevenTX\n\nOct 4, 2013, 12:21 am\n\nMemory of Fire by Eduardo Galeano (Uruguayan)\n\nA trilogy consisting of:\n\n- Genesis (1982)\n\n- Faces and Masks (1984)\n\n- Century of the Wind (1986)\n\nEnglish translation by Cedric Belfrage 1988\n\nEduardo Galeano best describes the nature and scope of this work in his own words:\n\n\"It is not an anthology, but a literary creation, based on solid documentation but moving with complete freedom. The author does not know to what literary form the book belongs: narrative, essay, epic poem, chronicle, testimony . . . Perhaps it belongs to all or none. The author relates what has happened, the history of America, and above all, the history of Latin America; and he has sought to do it in such a way that the reader should feel that what has happened happens again when the author tells it.\"\n\nThough published in three installments, Memory of Fire is a single continuous work and should be read as such. It consists of over 1000 vignettes, most about a half page in length. The earliest ones relate the various creation myths of the Native American peoples, from Tierra del Fuego to the Bering Strait. From that we jump to 1492 and the voyage of Christopher Columbus to the New World. Each vignette is given a year and a location, and it is footnoted to show the source. They are in chronological order from 1492 to 1984, but the locations jump from place to place. The perspective is sometimes that of a conquistador, a churchman or a political leader, but more often we see history through the eyes of the Indians, the peasants, the guerrilla fighters, and the slum dwellers. Occasionally the narrative jumps across oceans for a bit of context: the Gutenberg Bible, the invention of the electric light, or the stardom of Marilyn Monroe.\n\nGaleano's sympathies are clearly with the downtrodden and the disenfranchised: the Indians, the slaves, the poor, and women. With only a few breaks, the book is a chronicle of conquest, oppression, racial prejudice, exploitation and heroic resistance. The villains are Spain, the Catholic Church, Britain, the United States, and corporate capitalism. What would otherwise be a story of unrelenting horror and despair is elevated to the sublime by Galeano's language and humanity. Each vignette is a poem in prose, uplifting in its beauty and nobility even while describing scenes of murder and torture.\n\nThere is no attempt on Galeano's part to give a balanced account or to analyze what he describes. Dictators have no virtues; socialist revolutionaries have no vices and are forgiven their failings. When a liberal government fails to live up to its promises, the blame is always placed on foreign or corporate interference. Some may object to this black and white presentation of history, but one might argue that the privileged have had their say for centuries, so it's only fair to give the disenfranchised a turn at the podium. Given the author's emphasis on the cultural heritage of the American Natives, it's surprising that he omits any pre-Columbian history except for the creation myths--perhaps he felt that stories of Inca, Maya and Aztec conquests would weaken the reader's sympathy for them. But I found the biggest weakness in the work was the lack of an index. The stories of some persons and places are often told in vignettes dozens of pages apart, and it would be nice to be able to locate an earlier piece for review.\n\nMemory of Fire is a magnificent and incredibly moving account of Latin American history and culture. It is rich in detail and human interest, but ties together themes from all over the hemisphere to give the reader a sense of context and perspective. This would be an excellent place to begin a study of the history of the Americas.\n\n44rebeccanyc\n\nOct 4, 2013, 11:57 am\n\n38. The Green House was definitely hard to follow, but I loved it.\n\n42 I completely agree about Captain Pantoja and the Special Service! I had a smile on my face the whole time I was reading it and I couldn't help thinking about the fun Vargas Llosa must have had writing it.\n\n43. As I remarked on your thread, I've had Memory of Fire on the TBR for years, and really need to get to it.\n\n45SassyLassy\n\nOct 4, 2013, 4:36 pm\n\nWhat a great book to start off this thread and great review too. Something to refer to again and again as you read, but I agree with you about works like this that don't have an index. It's so useful.\n\n46banjo123\n\nOct 4, 2013, 10:39 pm\n\nThis thread is off to a great start!\n\nI have finished my first book --Leaf Storm by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. I really enjoyed it. It's an early work, and short, but definitely feels like GGM.\n\n47lriley\n\nOct 5, 2013, 8:18 am\n\nAs regards Galeano's Memory of Fire trilogy it's pretty much a historical synopsis of South and Central American history. I imagine people with strong conservative leanings would find Galeano's views on a lot of things distasteful. The truth is though that brutality by whatever authorities are in power has been a very common occurrence since the Spanish and Portugese started colonizing these areas of the world--as it has been in Africa and Asia and assorted other colonies with the British, French, Belgians and Germans. New creations of aristocracies aping European colonial values giving birth to countless dictatorships--a small number of privileged gaining control of the wealth--the law--the army--the apparatus of government when their colonial masters fade away.
