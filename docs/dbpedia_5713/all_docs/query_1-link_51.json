        "text": "Future freshman and transfer students can find their dedicated admissions counselor on the Undergraduate Admissions website. Your counselor can guide you through the application process from starting your application to confirming your acceptance.\n\nContact Admissions Counselors\n\nGraduate students can contact the OneStop office for assistance with the admissions process.\n\nContact Graduate Admissions\n\nAs an international student or exchange visitor to our university, we want to assure that you have a positive and productive experience. Staff at International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) can assist you with a wide range of important and practical information to help make your transition into our university and community as smooth and comfortable as possible.\n\nISSS has offices at both the Modesto Maidique and Biscayne Bay campuses. The staff advises international students and scholars on a variety of issues and is responsible for complying with procedures mandated by the Department of Homeland Security and updating student and scholar records in the Student & Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS).\n\nContact ISSS\n\nFlorida International University is one of twelve state universities that comprise the Florida State University System governed by a statewide Board of Governors (BOG). The BOG’s internal policy is to respect the processes each university has established to address student complaints and to require that students exhaust all appropriate internal university processes before seeking an external review. However, after a student has exhausted all internal university processes, provided there is no avenue for external appellate review by a court, the BOG’s complaint form may be completed and submitted by those students asserting noncompliance with state law or Board regulations.\n\nSubmit a Complaint\n\nFlorida International University supports the rights of students to express concerns, lodge complaints, file grievances, and make appeals in a safe environment. FIU has established reasonable complaint policies and procedures that are well-publicized and administered fairly. Unless otherwise redirected, these apply to all FIU students regardless of the physical location where a course is offered and includes those enrolled in online experiences."
