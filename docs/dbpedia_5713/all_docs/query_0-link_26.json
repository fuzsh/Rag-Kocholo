        "text": "IDFPR Introduces Virtual Licensing Appointments\n\nEffective July 24, 2024, the Division of Professional Regulation requests that individuals seeking updates on licensure applications make virtual appointments on Wednesdays instead of visiting the Departmentâ€™s Springfield office. This request is so staff are adequately prepared to address your concerns, while also ensuring the public has equitable access to appointments without needing to visit the Springfield office."
