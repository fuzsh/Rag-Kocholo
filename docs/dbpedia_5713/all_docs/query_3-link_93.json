        "text": "What is mpox?\n\nMpox (previously known as monkeypox) is a rare disease caused by a virus. It leads to rashes and flu-like symptoms. Like the better-known virus that causes smallpox, it’s a member of the genus Orthopoxvirus.\n\nMpox spreads through close contact with someone who’s infected. You can also get it from an infected animal.\n\nThere are two known types (clades) of mpox virus — one that originated in Central Africa (Clade I) and one that originated in West Africa (Clade II). The current world outbreak (2022 to 2023) is caused by Clade IIb, a subtype of the less severe West African clade.\n\nHow common is mpox?\n\nMpox is rare. But the number of cases is increasing in Africa, as well as in regions that haven’t seen these infections before.\n\nWhere else is mpox found?\n\nFor decades, mpox was mostly seen in Africa. But it’s occasionally found in other countries, including the United States.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, a case of mpox was found in a U.S. resident who had traveled from Nigeria to the United States. Then, 2022 brought outbreaks to regions outside of Africa, including Europe, the Americas and Australia.\n\nWho does mpox affect?\n\nAnyone can get mpox. In Africa, most cases are among children under 15 years old. Outside of Africa, the disease appears to be more common in men who have sex with men (MSM), but there are numerous cases in people who don’t fall into that category.\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of mpox?\n\nAfter exposure, it may be several days to a few weeks before you develop symptoms. Signs of mpox include:\n\nFever.\n\nRash.\n\nSwollen lymph nodes.\n\nChills.\n\nHeadache.\n\nMuscle aches.\n\nFatigue.\n\nThe rash starts as flat, red bumps, which can be painful. Those bumps turn into blisters, which fill with pus. Eventually, the blisters crust over and fall off. The whole process can last two to four weeks. You can get sores on your mouth, face, hands, feet, penis, vagina or anus.\n\nNot everyone with mpox develops all the symptoms. Different ways you might experience symptoms include:\n\nOnly a rash (no other symptoms), or other symptoms developing later.\n\nFlu-like symptoms, then a rash. Some people don’t get a rash at all.\n\nA rash can be widespread, but some people only a have few bumps or blisters.\n\nYou can have mpox and not know it. Even if you don’t show many signs of infection, it’s possible that you can spread still spread it to others through prolonged close contact.\n\nHow do you catch mpox?\n\nMpox spreads when you come into contact with an animal or a person infected with the virus.\n\nPerson-to-person spread (transmission) occurs when you come in contact with the sores, scabs, respiratory droplets or oral fluids of a person who’s infected, usually through close, intimate situations like cuddling, kissing or sex. Research is ongoing, but experts aren’t sure if the virus is transmitted through semen or vaginal fluids.\n\nAnimal-to-person transmission occurs through broken skin, like from bites or scratches, or through direct contact with an infected animal’s blood, bodily fluids or pox lesions (sores).\n\nYou can also get mpox by coming into contact with recently contaminated materials like clothing, bedding and other linens used by a person or animal who’s infected.\n\nHow do you prevent mpox?\n\nIf you’re at risk for mpox, getting vaccinated helps stop the spread. Other forms of prevention include decreasing human contact with infected animals and limiting person-to-person spread.\n\nMpox vaccines\n\nVaccines developed for smallpox also provide protection against mpox. Mpox vaccines are currently only recommended for people who’ve been exposed to, or are likely to be exposed to, mpox. You might be at higher risk of exposure if:\n\nYou’ve been in close contact with someone with mpox.\n\nSomeone you’ve had sex with in the past two weeks has been diagnosed with mpox.\n\nYou’ve had sex at a sex club, bathhouse or other commercial sex venue in the past six months.\n\nYou’ve had sex at an event or location where mpox was spreading.\n\nYou have a sex partner who’s been in any of the above situations.\n\nYou expect to be in one of the above situations.\n\nIf you’re a man who has sex with men, a transgender person or a nonbinary person, you may also be at risk if you’ve:\n\nBeen diagnosed with one or more sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the past six months. This includes acute HIV, gonorrhea, syphilis, chancroid or chlamydia.\n\nHad sex with more than one person in the past six months.\n\nIt’s important to get vaccinated before or as soon as possible after exposure. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re unsure if you should get vaccinated. If you’d like to get your shot in a more concealed location on your body, your provider can give it to you in your shoulder blade instead of your forearm.\n\nOther ways to prevent mpox\n\nIn addition to vaccines, other ways to help prevent the spread of mpox include:\n\nAvoiding contact with infected animals (especially sick or dead animals).\n\nAvoiding contact with bedding and other materials contaminated with the virus.\n\nThoroughly cooking all foods that contain animal meat or parts.\n\nWashing your hands frequently with soap and water.\n\nAvoiding contact with people who may be infected with the virus.\n\nPracticing safe sex, including the use of condoms and dental dams.\n\nWearing a mask that covers your mouth and nose when around others.\n\nCleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.\n\nUsing personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for people infected with the virus.\n\nWhy don’t we call it monkeypox anymore? Who changed the name?\n\nThe name monkeypox carries stigmas with it, including those about race. The World Health Organization (WHO) changed the name to mpox in November of 2022.\n\nWhat is the difference?\n\nMpox vs. chickenpox\n\nAlthough they both cause skin rashes, different viruses cause mpox and chickenpox. Mpox is an orthopoxvirus, while chickenpox is a herpes virus. Both viruses can spread through skin-to-skin or prolonged face-to-face contact, but chickenpox is very contagious and spreads more easily than mpox. People with mpox are more likely to have swollen lymph nodes than people with chickenpox.\n\nThe rashes act differently, too. While the chickenpox rash can appear in waves, mpox sores develop at the same time. Chickenpox symptoms — including the rash — tend to get better within two weeks, while it takes two to four weeks for mpox to resolve.\n\nMpox vs. smallpox\n\nSmallpox and mpox are both part of the Orthopoxvirus genus, so they’re caused by similar but distinct viruses. Thanks to effective vaccines, smallpox was eradicated (is no longer a circulating disease) by 1980. Smallpox was very contagious and spread more easily than mpox. Mpox symptoms are similar to smallpox, but milder.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nThe last few years have been incredibly challenging — the COVID-19 pandemic changed so much about the way we lived and worked. Now, just as we’re starting to ease back into regular life, we’re hearing media stories about mpox as an emerging threat. But mpox is a rare disease. It’s spread through close contact, like kissing and sex, but we’re still learning about how mpox spreads in humans.\n\nThe best way to protect yourself is to get vaccinated if you’re at high risk, avoid contact with people who are infected, wash your hands frequently and wear a face mask in crowded, indoor spaces. Early symptoms of mpox are flu-like and include fever, chills and body aches. After a few days, a rash will begin to develop. See a healthcare provider if you develop symptoms."
