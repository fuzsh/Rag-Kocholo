        "text": "Alert: Before sending your package to USCIS, make sure that all the forms you have completed are the current acceptable edition. USCIS published new editions for most forms on April 1, 2024. If you downloaded or printed your forms before April 1, you should verify the current edition date, because we will no longer accept a prior edition. The current acceptable edition can be found under the Edition Date section listed on each form’s webpage.\n\nYou can also find the edition date at the bottom of the page on the form and instructions. For each form that you are submitting, make sure that all pages are from the same form edition. If any of the form’s pages are from a different form edition, we may reject your form. Watch USCIS Forms: Download the most recent version! to see how to ensure your form is acceptable."
