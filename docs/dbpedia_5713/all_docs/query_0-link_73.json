Test results may be delayed between 1 to 2 months.\n\nPlan accordingly to avoid arriving in Hawai`i without a passing test result.\n\nConfirm that the Animal Quarantine Station has your pet’s passing test result before arriving in Hawai`i. To see if your pet’s OIE-FAVN test result was received by AQS, click HERE\n\nNeighbor Island Inspection Permits will not be issued without a confirmed passing FAVN test result.\n\nFAVN reports that are submitted upon arrival, whether original or photocopy, must be verified with the lab first. Pet will not qualify for DAR in this case and will enter quarantine until testing laboratory confirms test results.\n\nIt is strongly advised that the FAVN test be done well in advance so that a passing FAVN is obtained before requesting a Neighbor Island Inspection Permit. Failing to do so has resulted in pet owners not obtaining a Neighbor Island Inspection Permit in time for their flight.\n\n***********************\n\nDirect Release Requirements Minimum waiting period after a successful FAVN rabies antibody test before arriving in HI. 30 Days Minimum waiting period after most recent rabies vaccination before arriving in HI. 30 Days Current Fees Direct Airport Release $185* * Flight arrival times and COVID-19 mitigation procedures have increased the time for pet releases. Additional, extended delays are also created when pet owners do not submit their paperwork 10 days or more before arrival and have their documents reviewed at the AAQHF. It may not be possible to process these cases on arrival. The higher fee of $244 for each dog or cat released at the airport shall apply (instead of $185) when documents are not received by the Animal Quarantine Station 10 days or more before arrival. This includes situations where documents are submitted on arrival for review and qualification purposes. 5 Day or Less $244 Neighbor Island Inspection Permit $165 Arriving early before eligible for 5 Day or Less $14.30/each day early + $244 Re-Entry Fee (if qualified) $98** ** The higher fee of $130 for each dog or cat released at the airport shall apply (instead of $98) when documents are not received by the Animal Quarantine Station 10 days or more before arrival (re-entry).

Please make arrangements well in advance of the flight. Neighbor Island permits WILL NOT be issued without confirmation with those facilities.\n\nBefore booking your flight, refer to the appropriate checklist based on where your pet is located, either:\n\n“Checklist 2 – for Requesting Direct Airport Release at Kona, Kahului and Lihue Airports” (updated 1/24)\n\nor\n\n“Checklist 4 – Only for Dogs and Cats Located in Hawaii that are Departing and Requesting Direct Airport Release at Kona, Kahului and Lihue Airports on Return” (updated 1/24)\n\nAll procedures must be followed or the dog or cat will be denied entry at Kona, Kahului or Lihue Airport. Pets that are denied entry will be transported to Honolulu for inspection or transported out of the state at the owner’s expense.\n\nAs of July 1, 2021, the Neighbor Island Inspection Permit (NIIP) will be emailed only to the e-mail address of the primary owner listed on the AQS-279 form once documents are received and the pet qualifies.\n\nOwners are required to print the copy of the NIIP emailed to them to present to the airlines.\n\nNo permits are issued or required to fly a dog or cat into the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu.\n\nDue to the large volume of requests for Neighbor Island Inspection Permits, owners must ensure the following documentation is received by the Animal Quarantine Station 30 days or more ahead of the planned arrival:\n\nCompleted Dog & Cat Import Form (AQS-279).\n\nOriginal rabies vaccine certificates for the 2 most recent vaccinations.\n\nPayment of $165 in cashier’s check or money order made out to the Hawaii Dept. of Agriculture (no personal checks).\n\nFlight information (i.e. Airlines, flight number, date and time of arrival).\n\nA letter from the owner requesting Direct Airport Release at either “Kona” or “Kahului” or “Lihue”.\n\nContact a listed veterinary hospital to see if they are able to perform the inspection at the desired airport.\n\nOwners must contract with and make reservations for inspection with the following approved clinics:\n\nKona, Hawaii Island\n\nAli’i Veterinary Hospital, (808) 329-8999 or\n\nKeauhou Veterinary Hospital (808) 322-2988\n\nDirect Airport Release Kona, http://konapets.travel\n\nKahului, Maui –\n\nAt Home Animal Hospital & Mobile Veterinary Services (808) 873-0102,\n\nCentral Maui Animal Clinic (808) 893-2380, Kahului Animal Hospital (808) 871-7387,\n\nKihei Veterinary Clinic (808) 879-5777,\n\nMakawao Veterinary Clinic (808) 572-9003,\n\nMaui Humane Society (808) 877- 3680,\n\nSouth Shore Veterinary Care (808) 874-3422, or\n\nWest Maui Animal Clinic (808) 662-0099\n\nMaui Direct Release (808) 855-0125\n\nLihue, Kauai\n\nKauai Humane Society (808) 632-0610 or\n\nKauai North Shore Animal Clinic (808) 755-8728\n\nThese contractors will send a confirmation to the Animal Quarantine Station that they have agreed to perform the inspection and release procedure. Owners are responsible for the additional fees to the contractor for this service.\n\nCheck with your airline well in advance because some airlines may not be participating.\n\n►ADVISORY B\n\nInspection hours for dog and cats at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (Honolulu) are between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily, including weekends and holidays. This information is particularly important for those who are qualifying their pets for direct release in Honolulu.\n\nPet owners should be sure to arrange for their flights to arrive by 3:30 p.m. because it may take up to one hour for the airlines to transport a pet to the Airport Animal Quarantine Holding Facility and animals not arriving at the facility by 4:30 p.m. will not be released at the airport that day.\n\nPets arriving in the late afternoon and evening will be held overnight until inspections are completed the following morning. Pets qualified for direct airport release that are held overnight for release in the morning at the Airport Animal Quarantine Holding Facility must be picked up by 10:00 a.m. or an additional $59 will be charged. Pet owners who are arriving in Honolulu and connecting to neighboring islands should pay particular attention to the inspection hours.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nCONTACT INFO:\n\nEmail us: [email protected]\n\nAnimal Quarantine Station phone: (808) 483-7151\n\n(Due to the large volume of calls and the time zone difference, the best way to contact the Animal Quarantine Station is via the email address above.)\n\nMailing address to submit forms:\n\nAnimal Quarantine Station\n\n99-951 Halawa Valley Street\n\nAiea, Hawaii 96701\n\nCashier’s checks and money orders should be made payable to: Hawaii Department of Agriculture\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\n► HAWAII’S ANIMAL QUARANTINE LAW\n\nHawaii is rabies-free. Hawaii’s quarantine law is designed to protect residents and pets from potentially serious health problems associated with the introduction and spread of rabies. All dogs and cats, regardless of age (puppies and kittens included) or purpose, must comply with Hawaii’s dog and cat import requirements.\n\nChapter 4-29 Hawaii Administrative Rules, governs the importation of dogs, cats and other carnivores into Hawaii. This law states that dogs and cats meeting specific pre- and post-arrival requirements may qualify for 5 Day Or Less quarantine program, which has a provision for direct release at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (Honolulu) after inspection.\n\nFurthermore, the law requires dogs and cats that do not meet all of the specific 5 Day Or Less program requirements to be quarantined for up to 120 days upon arrival in Hawaii. Please read thoroughly the following documents containing details on the rabies quarantine programs for importing dogs and cats.\n\n“Hawaii Rabies Quarantine Information Brochure” (Updated 8/2019)\n\nWhy it is important that rabies be kept out of Hawaii:\n\nSee CDC report: Rabies: A Forgotten Killer (June 2019)\n\nProhibited Animals:\n\nThe regulation of animal breeds and species that are permitted to enter Hawaii is under Plant Quarantine Branch jurisdiction and administrative rules. Non-domestic dogs and cats and hybrids such as wolf, wolf cross, Dingo, Bengal, Savannah, etc. are prohibited under Plant Quarantine (PQ) law. Refer to Plant Quarantine’s animal guidelines for importation.\n\nPuppies and Kittens:\n\nDue to the minimum amount of time needed to prepare a puppy or kitten to meet the requirements of the 5 Day Or Less program, a newborn puppy or kitten will be about 6 months of age by the time the preparations are completed. Puppies and kittens not able to meet all of the requirements for the 5 Day Or Less program will be quarantined for 120 days.\n\nPets Located in Hawaii:\n\nOwners wishing to leave Hawaii with their pets and return without extended quarantine must meet all requirements listed on the “Checklist Only For Resident Dogs And Cats Originating From Hawaii And Returning For The 5 Day Or Less Program.” The length of the waiting period after a successful rabies blood test is modified and must be completed before leaving Hawaii. “Checklist 3 – Only for Dogs and Cats Located in Hawaii that are Departing and Returning for Direct Airport Release and the 5 Day Or Less Program” (Updated 6/2023)\n\nRe-Entry Fee Requirements:\n\nFor pets re-entering Hawaii after completing a Hawaii rabies quarantine program, click here for requirements when a reduced “Re-entry” fee for Direct Airport Release or 5 Day Or Less quarantine applies.\n\nDirect Release on Neighbor Islands:\n\nOwners wishing to fly their pet directly to Kona International Airport at Keahole (KOA), Kahului Airport (OGG) or Lihue Airport (LIH) must obtain a Neighbor Island Inspection Permit (NIIP).\n\nNIIPs require prior reservations with an approved private veterinary facility (see the appropriate checklist). Please make arrangements well in advance of the flight. Neighbor Island permits WILL NOT be issued without confirmation with those facilities.\n\nRefer to either “Checklist 2 – for Requesting Direct Release at Kona, Kahului and Lihue Airports” (updated 1/24)\n\nOr, for pets located in Hawaii, use: “Checklist 4 – Only for Dogs and Cats Located in Hawaii that are Departing and Requesting Direct Airport Release at Kona, Kahului and Lihue Airports on Return” (updated 1/24)\n\nNote that one of the requirements to obtain a NIIP is that owners must contract with and make reservations for inspection at these airports with one of the veterinary hospitals listed on the checklist. These contractors will send a confirmation to the Animal Quarantine Station that they have agreed to perform the inspection and release procedure. Owners are responsible for the additional fees to the contractor for this service.\n\nContact a listed veterinary hospital before booking your flight to see if they are able to perform the inspection.

Airport security regulations do not permit animals to be let out of the transport crate on airport property. Pets must be picked up and loaded into a vehicle or onto a baggage cart in their transport crate. Therefore, vehicles must be large enough to accommodate the intact crate with the pet inside. There are no baggage carts or porters in the immediate vicinity of the AAQHF. Due to limitations in inter-island service on the weekend, pets arriving on Thursday or Friday may not be transferred to satellite quarantine stations and approved hospitals on the neighbor islands until the following Monday.\n\n► FORMS\n\nDog and Cat Import Form [AQS-279], Rev. 1/24 – One completed form per pet is required to be submitted along with all pre-arrival documents (Two rabies vaccination certificates, health certificate, pre-payments made payable to: Hawaii Department of Agriculture) NO LESS THAN 10 DAYS BEFORE PET ARRIVES IN HAWAII TO QUALIFY FOR 5 DAY OR LESS or AIRPORT RELEASE.
