All H-1B and H-1B1 (HSC) petitions are filed at a USCIS lockbox facility.\n\nThe “I-129 Nonimmigrant Classification Filing Locations” dropdown tabs below contain information regarding your requested nonimmigrant classification and requested action. If you file your petition at the incorrect location, your petition may be rejected.\n\nListing Your Organization’s Primary Address\n\nYour company or organization’s primary office should be listed in Part 1, Question 3.\n\nFor certain H-1B petitions, the U.S. state or territory where your company or organization’s primary office is located will determine where you should send your Form I-129 package. Other H-1B and H-1B1 (HSC) petitions are filed at only one lockbox location, regardless of where the company or organization’s primary office is located.\n\nProviding Additional Information\n\nIn addition to Part 5, Question 3, you may also use Part 9 of Form I-129 to list additional worksite locations if you need extra space.\n\nPremium Processing\n\nIf you are requesting premium processing services for a Form I-129, you must also file Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service. The filing locations are listed in the “I-129 Nonimmigrant Classification Filing Locations” dropdown tabs below. Before you file the Form I-129/I-907 package, check uscis.gov to ensure that the requested classification is eligible for premium processing.\n\nIf we transferred your Form I-129 petition to a service center and you received a transfer notice, you must still submit your Form I-907 to the respective location listed on the “I-129 Nonimmigrant Classification Filing Locations” dropdown tabs below. You should also include a copy of the transfer notice with your premium processing request to avoid delays. We will reject any standalone Form I-907 that is not filed at the correct location listed on the “I-129 Nonimmigrant Classification Filing Locations” dropdown tabs.\n\nI-129 Nonimmigrant Classification Filing Locations"
