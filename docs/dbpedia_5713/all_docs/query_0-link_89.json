        "text": "Due to unprecedented delays with the launch of the 2024-25 FAFSA, we are currently experiencing higher than average wait times. We greatly appreciate your patience.\n\nDuring this time, we will do our best to prioritize those inquiries which are time sensitive for students enrolling in the Fall 2024 semester. We encourage you to review the FAQs on our Know Before You Go page before reaching out.\n\nFor newly admitted students for the Fall 2025 semester, the best time to reach out to our office is the month of October. Responses may be extremely delayed as we work to assist our current students.\n\nOur Service Commitment to You\n\nOur AskAid team members are committed and eager to answer your financial aid-related questions. Whether you are a prospective student, working on completing your Bachelor’s or Master's degree, or somewhere in between, our team is here for you.\n\nAnd with 9 out of 10 Wildcats using some type of financial aid, we know that understanding your aid is a top priority. We are proud to offer a high level of customer service to our Wildcats and their supporters whether they are here in Tucson, calling us from out of state, or even emailing us from abroad.\n\nCertain times of the year are very busy for our office and may delay our response time, but trust that we’re working to respond to your inquiry. When you send us an email, we will respond to first confirm we have received your email and/or documents. Email response times do vary during the year but our goal is to respond to your inquiry within three business days during non-peak times. Documentation submitted will require additional processing time which typically is between two to three weeks.\n\nWhile sending a duplicate email or reaching out again may seem like it would help get a quick response, repeated contact tends to confuse our system and can delay response times further. Please review our Average Wait Times chart to help you determine the best contact modality for you.\n\nIt is always our goal to make financial aid as easy and seamless as possible. That being said, every student circumstance is unique and often warrants a one-on-one approach, which can take some time. More complex matters such as appeals require additional time for review and processing. We appreciate your patience and understanding while you wait to hear back from us. We look forward to working with you and your supporters!"
