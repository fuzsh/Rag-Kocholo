        "text": "In 1979, the Coast Guard established a Military Pay Center in Riverdale, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., by moving the JUMPS (Joint Uniform Military Pay System) conversion team and other pay-related functions out of CG Headquarters in Washington. This was a temporary move until a more geographically centralized location could be found.\n\nIn 1977, a newly erected Federal Building known as the Frank Carlson Federal Building (named after the late Kansas Senator) was opened in Topeka, Kansas. Five years later in 1982 this became the center’s new permanent location.\n\nAs pay automation streamlined, many additional personnel processing functions became the center’s responsibility, resulting in the name change to PPC (Pay & Personnel Center) in mid-1983.\n\nOver the next fourteen years many more duties were added to PPC’s list of responsibilities, driving yet another name change to reflect the services provided.\n\nIn March 1997, PPC became known as HRSIC (Human Resources service & Information Center).\n\nIn 2003 the name changed to Personnel Service Center (PSC).\n\nOn February 13, 2009, the Personnel Service Center was renamed the Coast Guard Pay & Personnel Center for the second time.\n\nIn August 2022, PPC celebrated its 40th year of tenancy in the Frank Carlson Federal Building and the Topeka community.\n\nToday, with a host of responsibilities, PPC continues to deliver excellence in service to its more than 145,000 worldwide customers. ​​​​​​​\n\nAs our valued customers, your input is always welcomed and appreciated.\n\nPeople\n\nWe have the privilege to serve the Men and Women of the Coast Guard on a daily basis. Our mission is to provide caring and responsive personnel and compensation services for all Coast Guard military members, retirees, annuitants and other customers in support of the Department of Homeland Security missions.\n\nProfessionalism\n\nWe are a World Class Pay Center serving the World’s Greatest Coast Guard. We own critical fiduciary service and support functions for the Coast Guard and taxpayers. We are ever mindful of that responsibility and sensitive to the cost and quality of services we provide. Ensuring we are responsible and ethical stewards of taxpayer dollars, along with being active in giving back to our local community, positively reflects our character as we accomplish our mission. We must reduce payment inaccuracies to an absolute minimum, always provide honest and accurate financial reporting and strive to achieve unqualified audit opinions from external auditors. We do all of this while continuing to be recognized as a pillar of volunteerism and support within our community.\n\nCulture"
