You can get help with the website or with your benefits by calling 2-1-1 or 877-541-7905 (select your language and then Option 2).\n\nDialing 2-1-1 is a free, easy way to find out about services you can get in your area or through state programs.\n\nIf you can't connect to 2-1-1, call us toll-free at 877-541-7905. You can also visit the 2-1-1 Texas website to find the phone number to your local 2-1-1 area information center.\n\nYou may not be able to connect to 2-1-1 if:\n\nYou are calling from outside of Texas.\n\nYour cell phone won't dial 2-1-1.\n\nYou use voice-over-IP (use the Internet to make calls).\n\nThe 2-1-1 Texas language line allows Texans with a limited understanding of English to apply for benefits with the support of an interpreter in over 150 languages.\n\nIf the caller presses 0, they can choose from languages such as Vietnamese, Farsi, Somali, Arabic, Mandarin or French. They can also ask a live agent for an interpreter for other languages.\n\nThe interpreter will be conferenced in to convert information from English to the callerâ€™s chosen language throughout the application process.\n\nHHS agencies across the state are ready and willing to assist people who need services, contractors who provide them and anyone with questions about the services we provide.
