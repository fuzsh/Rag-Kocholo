DSS promotes self-reliance and self-sufficiency and works to prevent abuse, neglect, dependency and exploitation of vulnerable individuals, children and their families. DSS works to accomplish this through the following Family Centered Principles of Partnership:\n\nEveryone desires respect.\n\nEveryone needs to be heard.\n\nEveryone has strengths.\n\nJudgments can wait.\n\nPartners share power.\n\nPartnership is a process.\n\nIn North Carolina, the single administrative agency is the NC Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). This umbrella agency includes separate divisions. Some of the other DHHS divisions with the greatest impact on local offices include:\n\nDivision of Health Benefits (NC Medicaid)\n\nDivision of Child Development and Early Education\n\nDivision of Health Services Regulation\n\nDivision of Aging\n\nChild Protective Services: If you suspect a child is being abused or neglected, please contact your local county Department of Social Services.\n\nLeadership: Assistant Secretary for County Operations: Susan Osborne\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has released the Specialized Foster Care Plan Policy Paper which describes key design features related to foster care eligibility and enrollment, benefits, care management and quality, among other areas."
