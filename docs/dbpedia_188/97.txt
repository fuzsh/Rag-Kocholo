Field Marshal (Hindi: फ़ील्ड मार्शल), abbreviated as FM is the senior-most and highest attainable rank of the Royal Vishwamitran Army, the sole military warfare force in Vishwamitra. A five-star rank with NATO code OF-10, it ranks above a General and formally ranked equivalent to the highest ranks of the other two branches, namely Admiral of the Fleet of the Royal Vishwamitran Navy and the Marshal of the Royal Air Force. A Field Marshal's insignia consists of crossed baton and sabre in a lotus blossom wreath below a chakra and the Sovereign's crown. Like Marshals of the Royal Air Force and Admirals of the Fleet, Field Marshals traditionally remain officers for life and hold a largely ceremonial role in the army.

The highest rank of Field Marshal was created on 13 May 2018 by President Anoushkaa Patranabish on the eve of the constitutional coup of 14 May 2018 and bestowed the rank upon her Prime Minister Varuna Sriraya in recognition of his extraordinary contributions and services to the nation and its military warfare. He is also said to have pioneered the nation's basic military force and established the Ministry of National Defence. Ever since his appointment as the Field Marshal, he automatically took over as the Commander-in-Chief of the Vishwamitran Armed Forces and has continued to hold the position to date. The position is by law reserved for the nation's head of state, however, he was allowed to continue under Tanishkaa Patranabish's rule in 2020.

The second ever and the most recent appointment of an individual as the field marshal was that of Tanishkaa Patranabish, the former Rashtradhyaksh and the Rajpramukh of Beltola who was promoted to the rank on her 17th birthday on 17 April 2021 by Rashtradhyaksh Varuna Sriraya for her contributions to the nation since its foundation and for being a constant associate and guide for the nation.

Since the abolition of the royal navy and the royal air force in July 2022, the rank of field marshal is the highest service rank in the royal army, which is the sole warfare branch.
