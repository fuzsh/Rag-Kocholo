        "text": "Why Amin was promoted\n\nWhen Amin was being promoted to Field Marshal, the Defence Council cited eight reasons for his elevation. These were:\n\n1. He has brought unity in Uganda where people stayed as one family regardless of tribe, religion or status.\n\n2. Because of his brave action of expelling economic exploiters out of Uganda. Those people were milking our economy for almost 100 years. He saved the country from almost running bankrupt. The whole economy was in chaos and near total collapse.\n\n3. He handed over the national economy to indigenous Ugandans. For this Ugandans were now masters of their own economy and there are no longer bwana mkubwa exploiters here. They went forever and it is now history in Uganda. Well done to revise the land tenure by the recent Land Reform Decree.\n\n4. Because at present all Ugandans, rich or poor are free to develop land without limitation.\n\n5. He has put Uganda on the world map and now Uganda is known all over the world because of his active participation in Africa and world affairs, and his stand against racist South Africa and Zionism, and imperialism in the Middle East.\n\n6. Has made many friends for Uganda not only in Africa but all over the world.\n\n7. The Uganda security forces of army, police and prisons have been united, well equipped and well trained though Uganda Army is small by international standards.\n\n8. Because of fulfilling the 18-points they gave him at take-over in 1971.\n\nIn a similar occurrence, on February 6, 1988, the National Resistance Army (NRA), now the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF), received military ranks at the function held at Lubiri Barracks in Kampala, the Chairman of the NRA High Command and President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, was given the rank of Lieutenant General, which was the highest military rank of a serving army officer in Uganda then. President Museveni was later promoted to a full General."
