        "text": "Requirements\n\nThe title of Grand Marshal is an autocratic one, and so the only requirements is that it is a rule by power. Fundamentally, only those will be chosen and appointed if they have one of the following: Large foreign influence, mass popular support, support of the armed forces, natural strength and magical abilities, support of the clergy and nobility, support of a previous Grand Marshal, a distinct lack of opposition through various methods or any other stance where it is clear that the person has greater power than that of the opposition.\n\nAppointment\n\nA Grand Marshal is usually appointed when either the previous Grand Marshal has died or resigned and has chosen a selected individual as their successor, when the Grand Marshal has become incapacitated and the most suitable person is chosen to temporarily hold power and title, through self-appointment via coup, revolution or creation of a nation and through voting and popular opinion or dual rule when no clear individual is ready to assume control due to a lack of unclarified chosen successors by the previous Grand Marshal.\n\nDuties\n\nThe duties of this rank involve ruling or governing a country to the best of their ability. They are there to lead and inspire both the military, civilians and politicians and must act on behalf of Nicknaklandia to improve its position throughout the globe, whether it be diplomatically, militarily, economically or culturally.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nA Grand Marshals responsibilites lie with ruling the nation at their command, by engaging in foreign diplomatic affairs, appointing people to positions of power, having an in-depth look at the direction of the economy, managing the economical-social divides amongst the commoners and nobles, ensuring that the military forces are capable, maintaining the defence of the realm, ensuring the smooth operation of the government, instilling public order and loyalty throughout the public and representing their respective nation in every aspect of their life.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe benefits of being a Grand Marshal involve having an entire nation at your bidding, ready to do whatever you require, and so everything in a country effectively becomes owned by the Grand Marshal. Due to this, all comforts made available by the nation are controlled and used to the Grand Marshal's satisfaction and requirements.\n\nAccoutrements & Equipment\n\nThe clothes a Grand Marshal wears depends upon which style the Marshal wishes to choose, but more often than not, it is typically either militaristic or that of royalty and nobility. Usually, a sash is worn from the right shoulder, with medals and awards emblazoned on it. The materials that they wear tend to be of very fine quality. For a headdress, a crown, hat or circlet is also normally placed on. They are allowed to wear and wield weapons on their dress as they please, as well as armour and artifacts that boost their capabilities. Their uniform tends to exerte a certain image through their fashion, depicting whether they are a kind and noble rule, or a warmongerer.\n\nGrounds for Removal/Dismissal\n\nA Grand Marshal tends to either lead until their death, reignation or popular removal. It is an autocratic occupation that lasts for life, and so, as of such, unless a Grand Marshal become incapacitated temporarily, or is overthrown via a coup or revolution, or simply wants to enjoy a better life elsewhere, they will remain in the throne of power until the end.\n\nHistory\n\nThis title was used as a justification of Nick Nak for him to assume rulership over the isle of Nicknaklandia as a legitimate country in the eyes of the rest of the world in 31 PR, which was also when the title was created.\n\nNotable Holders\n\nCurrently, the three most notable holders of this title are Morros Sapientem, Elnura Beldrum and Nick Nak, the founder of the title. These three individuals are all Kobolds who belong to Nicknaklandia. Elnura and Morros took a dual power control from Nick Nak when he was incapacitated, and so whilst Nick Nak still hold the title, he cannot wield it due to his situation of being in a coma.\n\nType\n\nNobility, Military\n\nStatus\n\nIn effect\n\nCreation\n\nThis was chartered by Nick Nak on his ascension to the ruling of Kobolds in late 31 PR\n\nForm of Address\n\nHis Greatness, His Majesty, His Most Excellency, The Almighty One, Oh Serene Ruler, Master of All, Grand Ruler, Supreme Watcher of the Lands, Big Man on Throne, Oh One who is Underserving of My Presence, Crown Master, Maker of Laws, Creator of the World.\n\nEquates to\n\nIts position is the same of that of any other supreme ruling title of another country. It exists as the greatest military rank available, as the Grand Marshal is also the supreme commander of the armed forces, and so surpasses all other military ranks that operate under a country, but not any ranks of leaders who currently rule a country.\n\nSource of Authority\n\nPopular approval\n\nLength of Term\n\nLifelong\n\nFirst Holder\n\nRelated Locations\n\nRelated Organizations"
