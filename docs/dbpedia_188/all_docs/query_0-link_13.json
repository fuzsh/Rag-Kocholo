        "text": "Bu makale II. Meşrutiyet dönemi taşra ulemasının yeni/modern siyasî-fikrî kavramlara ve olaylara nasıl baktığını bir örnek üzerinden incelemeyi amaçlamaktadır. İttihat ve Terakki Cemiyeti 31 Mart vakasından sonra Kanun-ı Esasî’yi tadil süreçlerini hızlandırmış ve sarayın/padişahın gücünü oldukça sınırlandıran ve yeni düzenlemeler getiren bir şekilde sonuçlandırmıştı. Şeyhülislam Pirîzâde Mehmed Beyefendi ise yayınladığı bir beyannâme ile yeni siyasî sistemin şeriata uygun olduğunu delilleriyle ispat etmeye çalışmış ve oluşabilecek tenkit ve muhalefet hareketlerinin önüne geçmek istemiştir (Ağustos 1909). Tam bu sırada Kavala müderrislerinden Hoca Behçet Efendi şeyhülislamın beyannâmesini destekleyen ve şerh eden, “İslamiyet Mâni-i Terakki ve Meşrutiyet Değildir”, “Uhuvvet-i İslamiye”, “Maarif-i İslamiye” ve “Din ve İntibah-ı İslam” başlıklı yazılarını Tanin gazetesinde yayınlamıştır (Eylül-Aralık 1909). Böylece merkez ve taşradaki bütün ulema ve şeyhlere hitaben yayınlanan şeyhülislamın beyannâmesi taşrada mütevazı bir karşılık ve destek bulmuş oluyor. Bu çalışma Hoca Behçet’in bu yazılarını neşrederek onun fikirlerini ve yeniliklere yaklaşım tarzını biyografik malumat ve dönemsel bağlam çerçevesinde, düşünce tarihi metoduyla tasvir, tahlil ve tenkit etmektedir. Yazılar değerlendirildiğinde görülecektir ki döneminin birçok âlimi ve aydını gibi Hoca Behçet de meşrutiyet, medeniyet, terakki, maarif gibi modern ve Avrupa kaynaklı kavramları Osmanlı-İslam dünyasındaki sosyal-kültürel-ilmî-fikrî karşılıklarını derinlemesine incelemeden, dolayısıyla bu kavramların taşıdıkları problemleri üst düzeyde göremeden benimsemiş ve meşrulaştırmaya çalışmıştır. Bu arada onun İslamiyet’i modernleşme teşebbüslerinin merkezine yerleştirme çabasının da altını çizmek gerekiyor. Öte yandan Hoca Behçet örneği taşra ulemasının ya da alt kesim ilmiye mensuplarının modernleşme muhalifi, statüko yanlısı olduğu, merkezle irtibatlarının zayıf olduğu şeklindeki ön kabulleri gözden geçirmemize imkân tanıyor. --- This article aims to examine through a case how the provincial scholars of the Second Constitutional Era viewed new and modern political and intellectual concepts and events.The Committee of Union and Progress accelerated the amendment processes of the Kanun-ı Esasi [Ottoman Constitution of 1876] after the 31 March Incident and concluded in a way that limited the power of the palace and sultan as well as brought new regulations. Meanwhile, Sheikh al-Islam Pirîzâde Mehmed Sahib Efendi tried to use proofs to show that the new political system was in compliance with the Sharia with a declaration he published in his desire to prevent any possible criticisms or opposition movements (August 1909). At the same time, Hoca Behçet Efendi, a mudarris [lesson teacher] in Kavala, published his articles in the newspaper Tanin under the titles “İslamiyet Mâni-i Terakki ve Meşrutiyet Değildir” [Islam is not an obstacle to progress or constitutionalism “Uhuvvet-i İslamiye” [Solidarity in Islam], “Maarif-i İslamiye” [Modern Education in Islam], and “Din ve İntibah-ı İslam” [The religion and rebirth of Islam], which supported and annotated the declaration of Sheikh al-Islam (September-December 1909). Thus, the declaration that had been published to address all the ulema and sheikhs in the center and in the province found responses and support in the provinces. This study publishes these writings from Hoca Behçet as well as describes, analyzes, and critiques his ideas and approach to innovations within the framework of biographical information and a periodical context using the method of thought history. Upon evaluating the writings, Hoca Behçet will be seen like many scholars and intellectuals of his period to have adopted and attempted to justify modern and European concepts such as constitutionalism (meşrutiyet), civilization (medeniyet), progress (terakki), and modern education/science (maarif ) without examining the social, cultural, scientific, or intellectual equivalents of these concepts in the Ottoman Islamic world and thus without seeing the problems these concepts involve at higher levels. In the meantime, underlining his efforts was also necessary in order to place Islam at the center of modernization attempts. However, the example of Hoca Behçet also allows for a review of the preconceptions that the provincial ulema and members of the ilmiya [cultured] from the lowborn people had been opposed to modernization and were pro-status quo with weak connections to the center.\n\nDemocratic organisations and elected councils are vital to embody the democratic regimes shaped by the \" rule of law principle \" of the modern times. The initial traces of democratic change can be found in the moments when the elected organs and elected representatives started to become effective. Such organisations and councils have started to emerge during the modernization periods such as the Tanzimat Era in the last century of the Ottoman Empire and played a significant role in political and administrative structuring. When considered from this point of view, modernization of Ottoman administration was not only a movement initiated and handled by the central authority, but a time period where the organisations and councils were the determinants shaped by the genuine conditions of the periphery. These reformist and representative structures were the most important milestones of the modernization process until the establishment of Turkish Republic.\n\nIf we want to foster and develop what are the resources within Islamic thought and historical practices which may be understood to foster the establishment of democratic political development within the modern state. We must to research and examine the characteristics of Islamic data in the process that began with the declaration of Islamic Ottoman Constitutional government. This is an important issue because because of most of Muslim Countries passed by inheritance from the Ottoman State of poli-cultural and poli-etnical historical roots. And also this paper will be give Muslim Thinkers a cross-section of our modernization history in the context of states continuity of the Ottoman and other Modern Muslim Countries. So If It will be focused central theme of conflict, negotiation and mediation across East (i.e Islam) and West cultures, we must discussed democratic and Ottoman State’s experience as a symbol of harmony and adjustment different civilizations and cultures. If we want to foster and develop dialectical integrity between the human relations and religion relations and the spirit of democracy and pluralism in the Islamic countries. In the paper, by critical and rational reading of the philosophical accumulation of Islamic Anatolia as a presentational and kynote paper, I try to investigate the historical roots of our Islamic political identity and position without falling into error of searching any successor to a predecessor. if we can do this, can solve socio-political and ethnicity problems in the Muslim World\n\nThis thesis study examines the effects of the theory of the 'protectors' class mentioned in Plato's State. It assesses the scope of the 'natural guardian' role of the Turkish military. Since the army considers itself as a natural element of the state's administration, it assumes that it has a say in politics. Within the framework of this theory, the influence of the \"natural guardian\" role of the military on Turkish politics will be examined. This thesis is made of five main parts. The first is the introduction, which also includes the theoretical background. In the second part, historical perspectives on the military are analyzed by paying particular attention to the role of the \"guardians.\" In the third part, the military interventions in the Late Ottoman period will be examined within the framework of the same role. In the fourth part, the interventions in the Republican period will be evaluated. Furthermore, lastly, but not least, the commitment to the primary mission of realizing military coups will be examined in the same chapter. Finally, in the conclusion part, the four parts of our thesis will be evaluated and finalized. Accordingly, the purpose of the thesis is to analyze the Turkish military's interventions in politics within the framework of the guardian role attributed to the soldiers by Plato.\n\nThis paper attempts to examine the prevailing scholarly view on the Young Ottoman and the Young Turk movements, which postulates that the concept of constitutionalism was solely and directly based on the Western model, imported by the constitutionalist movements to the Ottoman Empire. As a child of the ‘modernization theory’, this approach mostly concentrates on European impact in an isolated manner, thus overlooking not only the manifold sources of the Ottoman constitutionalism, but also the means of legitimation that the Young Ottomans and the Young Turks cultivated. In view of this, I seek to shed light on the historical context of the Ottoman constitutionalism, by pointing out how the Young Ottomans and the Young Turks perceived the power struggles in the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and built continuity between themselves and the political position that aimed to restrict the royal prerogative before the nineteenth century.\n\nThis thesis analyzes the life and power politics of Pazvandoğlu Osman, Ayan of Vidin, in the 18th century with references to the changes in the Ottoman provincial administration experienced between the 17th and 18th centuries. Osman̕s relations with the Ottoman central government and the policy that the latter followed towards him will also be given to show the Ottoman methods of coping with the oppositional groups in the provinces in the case of Pazvandoğlu Osman in the 18th and 19th centuries. Moreover his relations with the people of Vidin as well as with the neighboring ayans will be displayed to examine how an ayan ruled and represented people and also how important an ayan was in the development of a city. In addition a description of the Ottoman Balkans in general and Vidin in particular will also be analyzed from the point of view of their contributions to the rise of Pazvandoğlu Osman within the context of cause and effect relations.M.S. - Master of Scienc\n\nIn presenting the findings and hypotheses of my ongoing PhD research on 'the General Inspectorate of Rumelia' (Vilayet-i Selase Umum Müfettişliği), this paper aims to open a discussion on an extraordinary imperial administration in Ottoman Macedonia of the late Hamidian period (1902-1909), under the inspectorship of Hüseyin Hilmi Pasha. The current literature on the Macedonian Question has so far dealt only partially with both the inspectorate and the inspector himself, leaving various questions unanswered. This paper briefly examines the subject within the historical context of the first decade of the 20th century, which witnessed the peak of ethno-political conflicts in the Ottoman Balkans. The Inspectorate was established with an imperial order of Abdulhamid II, as an outcome of 'the Regulations on Rumelian Provinces' issued on 30 November 1902. Although the apparent purpose was to satisfy the concurrent European demands for 'reforms in Macedonia' on the basis of the Berlin Treaty of 1878, the Inspector General also had to deal with a wide range of issues; from the implementation of public order to the dismissal of corrupt officials. As the Rumelian provinces became the cradle of the Committee of the Union and Progress, the Inspectorate found itself increasingly facing a new sort challenge. Along the line of an investigation into the role of Hüseyin Hilmi Pasha, the administrative structure, and the functioning of the institution, this paper seeks an answer to the question: \"to what extent the inspectorate can be considered as a ‘typical’ reflection of Hamidian approach to a complex issue with an international nature in Macedonia?” The research is based on a set of primary sources such as the personal papers of Hüseyin Hilmi Pasha housed by ISAM, official documentation from the Prime-ministerial Archive in Istanbul, as well as reports from the British Foreign Office and the published memoires of the contemporaries."
