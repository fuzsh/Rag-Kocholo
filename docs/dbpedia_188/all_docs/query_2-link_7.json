They have specific specialties within an Army unit, perform specific job functions and have the knowledge that ensures the success of their unit's current mission within the Army.\n\nWarrant Officer Ranks\n\nThe adaptive technical expert, combat leader, trainer, and advisor. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant officer administers, manages, maintains, operates and integrates systems and equipment across the full spectrum of operations.\n\nCorps and Division Operations\n\nThe U.S. Army is the largest branch of service with a greater variety of units than the other services, each with a different organization and purpose. Therefore, the Army provides the combatant commander with an interlocking array of higher headquarters trained and equipped to apply landpower from the theater level, through the operational level, and down to the tactical employment of various brigades, groups, and battalions. Together the theater Army, corps, and division give the combatant commander several options necessary for the employment of landpower in an interdependent joint force."
