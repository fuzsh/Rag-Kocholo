        "text": "On 8 February 2024, the RAF Chapel hosted the annual memorial for Marshal of the Royal Air Force Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard, the ‘Father of the RAF’.\n\nThe service, led by The Right Reverend Anthony Ball at the RAF Chapel in Westminster Abbey, was attended by The 3rd Viscount Trenchard, Lord Trenchard’s grandson, The Viscountess Trenchard, Captain George Hopkins, and Air Vice-Marshal Giles Legood.\n\nFund attendees included Chairman Mr Richard Daniel, Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, Controller, and Air Commodore Simon Harper, Director of Grants, Services and Programmes.\n\nWreaths were laid by Captain George Hopkins on behalf of His Royal Highness The Duke of Kent, and Air Vice-Marshal Giles Legood on behalf of the RAF and the Chief of Air Staff.\n\nMarshal of the Royal Air Force Hugh Montague Trenchard had an instrumental role in the establishment of the Royal Air Force.\n\nAs the nickname, ‘Father of the Royal Air Force’ suggests, Trenchard worked his way through the ranks to become the first Airman to hold the highest rank, Marshal of the RAF, in 1927. He founded training colleges for air cadets and officers and was founder of the RAF Benevolent Fund.\n\nAir Commodore Simon Harper, Director of Grants, Services and Programs at the RAF Benevolent Fund said: “In paying tribute to the life and legacy of Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Hugh Trenchard, we express profound gratitude for his dedicated service and visionary leadership that lay the foundations of the modern Royal Air Force. In heartfelt thanks, the RAF Benevolent Fund honours his legacy, that to this day stands as a beacon of strength and inspiration for those who serve.”"
