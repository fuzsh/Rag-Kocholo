The so-called “Young Turk Revolution” of 1908, in fact, may well be regarded as the prototype of Near Eastern military coups of this century. A decade later, Mustafa Kemal [Atatürk] and other army officers took the lead in creating a nationalist Turkish Republic out of the ruins of the multinational Ottoman Empire. Since the proclamation of the Republic in 1923, however, the Turkish army has abstained from any such obvious role on the political stage.\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nWorld Politics , Volume 11 , Issue 4 , July 1959 , pp. 513 - 552\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.2307/2009591 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Trustees of Princeton University 1959\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

Emin, Ahmed [Yalman], Turkey in the World War, New Haven, Conn., 1930Google Scholar, may serve as an introduction for the English-speaking reader. Bayur, Yusuf Hikmet, Türk İnkilâbt Tarihi, İstanbul and Ankara, 1940—Google Scholar, emphasizes international politics and also treats the period largely in terms of what it contributed to later developments under the Republic. Türkgeldi's, Ali Fuad modest, conscientious, and detached memoirs, Görüp İşittiklerim, 2nd ed., Ankara, 1951Google Scholar, are limited mainly to the small, if crucial, segment of public affairs of which he had official knowledge as secretary to the Sultan. The Turkish war effort is thoroughly and competently treated by Larcher, M., La Guerre Turque dans la Guerre Mondiale, Paris, 1926Google Scholar; see also the memoirs of the Austrian military plenipotentiary, Pomiankowski, Joseph, Der Zusammenbruch des ottomanischen Reiches, Leipzig, 1928.Google Scholar Finally, Heyd, Uriel, Foundations of Turkish Nationalism, London, 1950Google Scholar, systematically examines the philosophical ideas of the leading Union and Progress theorist, Ziya Gökalp.\n\n10\n\n10 Depositions had been frequent in Ottoman history. The earlier ones, however, had been due to intrigues in the palace and the capital; Abdülhamid's was the first prompted by popular and partisan action. Cf.

In October 1919 Kemal, when asked, “Is it possible that the Unionists will influence the National Forces?” replied: “Our National Forces are under the influence only of the nation and of the supremenational aims. Aside from this no individual or society can exercise any influence upon them.” (Atatürk], [Kemal, Nutuk, İstanbul, 1934, III, pp. 169f.Google Scholar, document 144.) Four years later he was to state more candidly: “We were all members [of the Society of Union and Progress]… Most of the members of that society and of the Renewal Party … joined, or participated in, the Society for the Defense of Rights of Anatolia and Rumelia…” (Atatürk, Kemal, Söylev ve Demeçler, İstanbul-Ankara, 1945–1954, III, p. 62.)Google Scholar And earlier he had declared, “If there must needs be some Unionism in this business, then the entire nation stands accused of Unionism.” (Ibid., III, p. 2.)\n\n20\n\n20 German translation of oath in Fischer, A., “Der türkische Nationalismus und der Sturz des dritten Kabinetts Damad Ferid Pascha,” Der neue Orient, VII, No. 3 (1920), p. 98.Google Scholar\n\n21\n\n21 Türkgeldi, , op.cit., p. 176.Google Scholar\n\n22\n\n22 Edib, Halide, The Turkish Ordeal, New York, 1928, p. 39.Google Scholar Similarly İzzet Paşa was to recall of the time of his premiership: “The Committee of Union and Progress, despite its many faults and failures, still was a force not to be neglected in the country as a whole and in İstanbul in particular.

The memorandum was first made public in the İstanbul paper Tasviri EfKâr during the 1919 election campaign. It is reprinted in Hüseyin Hüsnü Emir [Erkilet], Yildirim (supplement to Mecmua-yt Askeriyye, İstanbul, 1337 [i.e., 1921]), pp. 78ff.

The latter included, in addition to the three generals mentioned above, Hüseyin Rauf [Orbay], who had been the nationalist floor leader in the İstanbul parliament of 1920, and Vasif, Colonel Kara, chief Anatolian representative in İstanbul in 1919–1920.Google Scholar\n\n41\n\n41 See Apak, Rahmi, İstiklâl Savaşinda Garp Cephesi Nasil Kuruldu?, İstanbul, 1942, p. 45Google Scholar (commanders to Anatolia); İnal, , op.cit., p. 2113Google Scholar (Allies force Çobanli and Mersinli to resign after large nationalist raid on French-guarded ammunitions depot); and Atatürk, , Nutuk, II, pp. 150–55Google Scholar (Mersinli and Representative Committee).\n\n42\n\n42 İskora, , op.cit., p. 228Google Scholar; communication from the War History Division of the General Staff.\n\n43\n\n43 There were exceptions with regard to age, as well as to ethnic origin (see above).

That there was continued collusion between Kemal and the War Office is clearly indicated by the opening passage of the first cable which the new War Minister, Ali Ferid Paşa, sent Kemal on June 30: “… Since I, like you, rely on my powers of judgment, I can assert that there is no one who understands the deepest recesses of your mind as well as I do…” Ibid., (doc. 28.)\n\n61\n\n61 Biyiklioğlu, , “Mondros …,” p. 579.Google Scholar\n\n62\n\n62 Military authorities and civilian groups alike co-operated in the systematic evasion of the demobilization regulations; for specific examples, see Cebesoy, , Millî Mücadele, p. 31Google Scholar, and the colorful account of Rawlinson, Colonel A., one of the British control officers (Adventures in the Near East, London, 1923, p. 221).Google Scholar\n\n63\n\n63 The Karakol Society's leaders included Colonel Kara Vasif (cf. note 40, above), and Colonel Kemaleddin Sami, who had distinguished himself in the Caucasus campaign of 1918 and later became a brigadier general in the Kemalist forces.

As early as 1923 the Kemalists included in their Lausanne delegation two ex-ministers of Talât's wartime cabinet—Cavid and Mustafa şeref [özkan]. The exact relationship between Kemalists and Unionists, however, as well as the exile activities of the Unionist leaders and their attempts at a comeback, need much fuller study. Generally it is true mat those who held first rank in the CUP at best held second rank in the Kemalist movement, and vice versa. Following the 1926 assassination attempt on Kemal, a number of the surviving CUP leaders, including Cavid, Ahmed Sükrü, and İsmail Canbulat, were executed—but their trial was presided over by Ali [çetinkaya], himself one of the original Macedonian conspirators of 1908. By the 1930's many prominent surviving Unionists were allowed to return to political activity and to parliament.\n\n75\n\n75 For a pointed expression of that suspicion, see, e.g., the remark which Reçid Paşa attributes to the Sivas leader of the Freedom and Accord Party: “Mustafa Kemal Paşa keeps exerting himself to encourage the Union and Progress movement. … Enver, Talât, and the others, before their flight, selected him as their replacement and put several hundred thousand pounds at his disposal.

He confirms that the conversation took place (probably in early August 1923) as reported by Kemal, and explains that a divergence of views on die selection of cabinet ministers and parliamentary officers formed die immediate background.\n\n85\n\n85 Of the other World War I army commanders who fought with Kemal in Anatolia, Cemal [Mersinli] had joined an even earlier, informal opposition in the Assembly known as the Second Group, and later withdrew from politics until after Atatürk's death. Ali İhsan [Sabis] had fallen out with Inönü while the latter was his superior as commander of the western front; he was elected to the Assembly in 1950 on a Democratic ticket. Nihad [Anilmiş] became a Republican People's Party deputy after his retirement from the army in 1942.
