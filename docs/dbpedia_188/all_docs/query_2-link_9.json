The Grand Marshal is the commanding officer of the Grand Alliance Army.\n\nSince the creation of the office of High King, the rank of Grand Marshal of the Army has always been held by the incumbent of said office.\n\nKnown Grand Marshals of the Army[]\n\nCurrently[]\n\nHigh King Anduin Wrynn\n\nFormerly[]\n\nHigh King Varian Wrynn\n\nHigh General Turalyon\n\nSupreme Allied Commander Anduin Lothar\n\nGrand Marshal[]\n\nGrand Marshal (GM) is a typically ceremonial military office of very high rank. Usually, the Grand Marshal is the commanding officer of a single Alliance nation's army, holds near absolute power within their respective army and is often one of the main directors of it's movements during war time. Alternatively, a Grand Marshal may be appointed to command the combined Alliance forces of a specific Front, such as in the case of Wrynn's Vanguard.\n\nAlthough the most common title of the rank is Grand Marshal, each various Alliance state has its own name for the rank, as listed below\n\nKingdom of Stormwind - Lord High Marshal\n\nKingdom of Lordaeron - Grand Marshal\n\nKingdom of Gilneas - High General\n\nKingdom of Stromgarde - High Designator\n\nKingdom of Kul Tiras - Lord Admiral (de facto)\n\nKingdom of Ironforge - High General\n\nIt must be noted that Grand Marshal may also be bestowed upon others ceremonially as a sign of respect to service or other contributing factors which has aided the Grand Alliance.\n\nKnown Grand Marshals[]\n\nCurrently[]\n\nGrand Marshal Acele Walkinson (Grand Marshal of the Alliance Army)\n\nGrand Marshal Ashamal Shalah'aman (Grand Marshal of the Alliance Navy)\n\nGrand Marshal Julianne Tremblade (Grand Marshal of Wrynn's Vanguard)\n\nFormerly[]\n\nGrand Marshal John Padmore (Grand Marshal of the Alliance Army, deceased)\n\nGrand Marshal Othmar Garithos (Grand Marshal of remnants of the Kingdom of Lordaeron, deceased)\n\nHigh Marshal[]\n\nA High Marshal (HM) is a rank of Marshal below Grand Marshal and above Field Marshal. They generally take command of military strategic outposts Much like Grand Marshals, it may be on rare occasions that High Marshal actually fight in the field, rather they may usually stay stationed at the nearest base to command the army from there.\n\nCurrently known there has only been one known person to have held the rank, the late High Marshal Twinbraid.\n\nRecently there has discussions on the use of High Marshal, which has led many to believe that the rank should be abolished or molded into the other Marshal ranks due to it's rare awarding.\n\nKnown High Marshals[]\n\nCurrent[]\n\nN/A\n\nFormerly[]\n\nHigh Marshal Twinbraid (High Marshal of the Alliance, deceased)\n\nField Marshal[]\n\nField Marshal (FM) is a very senior military rank, usually in command of thousands of soldiers.\n\nPromotion to the rank of Field Marshal may include various reasons including extraordinary military achievement, outstanding command or a notable dedication to duty and service. The rank is typically used as a divisional or brigade command rank.\n\nUnlike some of the other Marshal ranks, Field Marshals are often far more involved in actual combat than others.\n\nKnown Field Marshals[]\n\nCurrent[]\n\nField Marshal Brock (Field Marshal of the Alliance Army)\n\nField Marshal Jackson Amadatha (Field Marshal of the Seventh Legion)\n\nField Marshal Kerwin (Field Marshal of the Alliance Army, currently a Prisoner of War in Ashran)\n\nField Marshal Oslight (Field Marshal of the Alliance Army)\n\nField Marshal Vincent Ravenwing (Field Marshal of the Shadowtalon Company)\n\nField Marshal Elmar Kraine (Field Marshal of the Royal Avorraine Legion)\n\nFormer[]\n\nField Marshal Henry Sutton IV (Field Marshal of the Stormwind Army, retired)\n\nLord Marshal[]\n\nLord Marshal (LM) is a high ranking officer within an army or major regiment. Lord Marshals leads major army units or regiments and are often some of the larger heads in the military planning.\n\nDespite the ironic name, Lord Marshal does not require the recipient of the promotion to be of Stormwind Nobility, though many Lord Marshals are of peerage anyways.\n\nKnown Lord Marshals[]\n\nCurrent[]\n\nLord Marshal Adroby Relindor (Lord Marshal of the First Regiment of the Stormwind Guard)\n\nLord Marshal Maxen Montclair (Lord Marshal of the First Regiment of the Elwynn Brigade)\n\nLord Marshal Raynor (Lord Marshal of the Alliance Vanguard)\n\nFormer[]\n\nLord Marshal Larsarius Tagarn (Lord Marshal of the Stormwind Army, formerly)\n\nMarshal[]\n\nMarshal (MS) is a senior Officer rank within the Grand Alliance Army, generally in charge of medium-large regiments, or even small Army posts.
