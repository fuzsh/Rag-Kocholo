        "text": "Studio portrait of 2nd Lieutenant (2nd Lt) Harry Leslie Douglas Malcolm, (known as Douglas) MM. Formerly a commercial traveller of Darlinghurst, NSW, in this image he is newly promoted to 2nd Lt and not yet issued with his shoulder pip and is wearing the ribbon for his Military Medal which was awarded on 19 May 1917. Malcolm enlisted on 17 August 1914, and embarked from Sydney aboard HMAT Euripides with D Company, 4th Battalion, on 20 October 1914. On 11 December 1915 he was promoted to lance corporal whilst on the Gallipoli peninsula, and, in January 1916 he was transferred to the Imperial Camel Corps. On 30 October 1916 he was promoted to temporary Sergeant and then temporary Company Sergeant Major (CSM) which latter rank he was subsequently appointed to permanently. In January 1917 he was taken on strength with 1st Anzac Battalion of the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade. He was awarded the MM for his attention to duty as a member of No 2 Company of the 1st Camel Corps Battalion on their advance on Tank Redoubt during the Second Gaza engagement against the Turks. As a CSM he should have been at the rear of the company but he had joined in the charge \"for the fun of it‚Äù. He had been helping the wounded, giving his men direction and assisting the Lewis gunners to hold their position. On 5 September 1917 he was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant and attended officer training and became an instructor with 35th Lewis Gun course. On 15 December 1917 he was promoted to lieutenant. In April 1918 he received gun shot wounds to chest and arms whilst a member of the 14th Light Horse Regiment. In June 1918 he returned to duty and eventually returned to Australia on 22 January 1919. He was mentioned in despatches on two occasions in late 1918 and these MIDs were gazetted on May 1919.\n\nOpening Hours\n\n10 am to 5 pm daily (except Christmas Day)\n\nIn preparation for the daily Last Post Ceremony,\n\ngalleries are progressively closed from 3:40 pm.\n\nPublic entrance via Fairbairn Avenue, Campbell ACT 2612\n\nBook your ticket to visit: awm.gov.au/visit"
