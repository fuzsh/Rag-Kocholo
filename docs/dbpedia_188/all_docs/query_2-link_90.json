        "text": "Who was KM Cariappa?\n\nOn 28 January 1899, Cariappa was born into a family of farmers from the Kodava clan at Shanivarsanthe in Coorg province (now Kodagu district). His father, Madappa, was employed in the revenue department. In a family of two daughters and four sons, Cariappa was the second child. His family called him 'Chimma'. After graduating from Central High School in Madikeri in 1917, he completed his studies at Presidency College in Chennai. It was at the college that he learnt that Indians were being recruited and trained for the army. He applied for training because he wanted to be a soldier. Out of 70 applicants, Cariappa was one of 42 to be admitted to the Daly Cadet College in Indore. He did well in all aspects of his training and graduated seventh in his class.\n\nMilitary career\n\nCariappa had a distinguished military career spanning nearly three decades. Joining the British Indian Army after World War I, he was commissioned as a temporary first lieutenant into the 2/88 Carnatic Infantry. Cariappa became the first Indian officer to attend the Staff College, Quetta, and later commanded the 1/7 Rajputs, making him the first Indian to lead a battalion. He served in various staff roles and commands, eventually becoming the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army. During World War II, Cariappa served in the Middle East and Burma, earning accolades for his leadership. His historic achievements include being the first Indian to command a battalion in the Indian Army.\n\nPost-Independence, Cariappa assumed the role of deputy chief of the general staff. He orchestrated three successive attack operations—Kipper, Easy, and Bison—with the aim of reclaiming strategic areas like Naushera, Jhangar, Poonch, Zoji La, Dras, and Kargil. However, plans to expel Pakistani forces from Kashmir were thwarted by the United States' intervention. On July 6, 1948, the Army HQ imposed strict restrictions on conducting major operations without its authorization. Cariappa opposed this policy, warning that it endangered Leh, Kargil, and ultimately the Kashmir Valley, jeopardizing the nation's security.\n\nHow did Field Marshal Cariappa died?\n\nCariappa's distinguished career with the Indian Army spanned three decades, encompassing roles in staff and command. Following his retirement in 1953, he served as the Indian high commissioner to Australia and New Zealand until 1956. Notable for his dedication to ex-servicemen's welfare, Cariappa founded the Indian Ex-Servicemen's League (IESL) in 1964 and played a key role in establishing the Directorate of Resettlement. On April 28, 1986, Cariappa received the rank of field marshal from the Government of India in appreciation of the outstanding service he provided to the country. He passed away on May 15, 1993, and was cremated in Madikeri, attended by dignitaries including the three service chiefs and Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw."
