        "text": "Sam Manekshaw\n\nIndian field marshal\n\nIn full:\n\nSam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw\n\nAlso called:\n\nSam Bahadur (Sam the Brave)\n\nBorn:\n\nApril 3, 1914, Amritsar, Punjab state, India\n\nDied:\n\nJune 27, 2008, Wellington, Tamil Nadu state (aged 94)\n\nSam Manekshaw (born April 3, 1914, Amritsar, Punjab state, India—died June 27, 2008, Wellington, Tamil Nadu state) was the first Indian military officer to be promoted to the rank of field marshal, the highest rank that can be attained in the Indian Army. Manekshaw joined the British Indian Army in 1934 and served in several notable conflicts including World War II, the 1947 India-Pakistan War, and the 1965 India-Pakistan War. He served as chief of the Army Staff from 1969 to 1973. Manekshaw was key to India’s victory in the 1971 India-Pakistan War, which lasted 13 days and ended with the surrender of Pakistan’s forces, resulting in the creation of an independent Bangladesh. Manekshaw was awarded two of India’s highest civilian honors, the Padma Bhushan in 1968 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1972. In addition to his distinguished career and achievements, Manekshaw is remembered for his efficiency as a leader, compassion for his troops as well as the enemy, and quick wit.\n\nEarly life and the British Army\n\nManekshaw was born to Parsi parents and was raised in Amritsar, Punjab state, India. He studied at Sherwood College in Nainital, Uttarakhand state, and Hindu Sabha College in Amritsar. In 1932 he was among the first 40 cadets selected for the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, in Uttarkhand state. The academy had been set up to enable Indians to become commissioned officers in the British Indian Army. Upon graduation, Manekshaw joined the 12th Frontier Force Rifles as a second lieutenant on February 4, 1934.\n\nManekshaw suffered grave injuries in World War II during the Burma Campaign fought by the Allies against Japan. Manekshaw, then a captain, led a company to victory in the Battle of Sittang Bridge on February 22, 1942, and was wounded in his midsection and lungs. Despite his injuries, he kept fighting until he collapsed. He was awarded the Military Cross for his gallantry and leadership; Maj. Gen. David Cowan, the commander in chief of his infantry division, personally pinned his own Military Cross ribbon on Manekshaw. When the surgeon who attended to his wounds asked what happened, Manekshaw is said to have responded, “A bloody mule kicked me.” The surgeon laughed and said, “By Jove, you have a sense of humor. I think you are worth saving.” Manekshaw recovered and returned to action before being wounded again.\n\nCareer in the Indian Army\n\nManekshaw was transferred to the 8th Gurkha Rifles Regiment following India’s independence in 1947, as his former regiment, the 12th Frontier Force Rifles, was assigned to Pakistan. The soldiers of this division gave him the nickname Bahadur. The word means “brave,” and the Gurkhas are famed for their courage. He played a key role in Indian military operations during the 1947 war with Pakistan over Kashmir. He was appointed colonel of the 8th Gurkha Rifles on May 24, 1953. He continued as the honorary colonel of this regiment until his death.\n\nManekshaw earned a reputation for standing up to politicians and bureaucratic interference and brought to the army a sense of duty and professionalism. In 1961 he fell out with Indian Defense Minister V.K. Krishna Menon by refusing to support Menon’s attempts to subvert the chief of the Army Staff, K.S. Thimayya. However, Menon resigned in 1962 after the Chinese army overran Indian forces in the war between the countries. Manekshaw, then a lieutenant general, was quickly sent to the front, where he rallied Indian troops to hold their ground until a ceasefire was declared.\n\nHe became the first Indian commissioned officer to become an army commander on December 4, 1963, when he was appointed commander in chief of the Western Command. In November of the following year he led the Eastern Command and oversaw the Eastern theater of the 1965 India-Pakistan War, which resulted in the defeat of Pakistan.\n\nThe 1971 war and elevation to field marshal\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nManekshaw was appointed chief of the Army Staff on June 8, 1969. He led the Indian Army to victory during the 1971 India-Pakistan War, which led to the independence of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh. Before the war, in the spring of 1971, he notably resisted demands from Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to invade East Pakistan in support of the Bengali leaders who demanded autonomy for East Pakistan. Knowing that East Pakistan’s weather conditions were formidable during the monsoon season, he insisted on delaying the campaign until after the monsoon had ended. Victory in the 1971 war made Manekshaw a household name in India. He also closely monitored the detainment of more than 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war and was known for his compassionate treatment of them.\n\nFor his services over four decades, as well as the key role he played in India’s victory in the 1971 war, Manekshaw was promoted to the rank of field marshal on January 1, 1973, becoming the first Indian military officer to hold that rank.\n\nDid you know?\n\nField marshal, the highest rank in the Indian Army, is a ceremonial rank that is held for life. So far, India has had just two field marshals: Sam Manekshaw (1973) and Kodandera Madappa Cariappa (1986).\n\nLegacy\n\nIn 1995 Manekshaw delivered the inaugural Field Marshal KM Cariappa Memorial Lecture in honor of the first Indian commander in chief of the Indian Army. Cariappa had also played a key role in the development of the Indian Army and had been elevated to the honorary rank of field marshal in 1986, 33 years after his retirement.\n\nManekshaw died of pneumonia on June 27, 2008. He remains one of India’s best-known soldiers and military leaders. In 1968 the Indian government awarded him the Padma Bhushan, India’s third highest civilian honor. In 1972 he received the Padma Vibhushan, the counry’s second highest civilian award. Tributes to him are seen every year on his birth anniversary, on official channels as well as social media. A 2023 Hindi film titled Sam Bahadur, based on his life, was a critical and commercial hit."
