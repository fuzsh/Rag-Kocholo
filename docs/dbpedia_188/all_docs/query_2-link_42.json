        "text": "Updated 24 July 2024\n\nJoining the army can be a great decision if you'd like to serve the country and enter an intensive training programme that develops your skills. As a member of the Royal Air Force (RAF), you can explore various advancement opportunities or even work towards becoming an air marshal, the highest RAF rank. Learning about this path can help you decide if the military is where you want to work. In this article, we discuss the role of Royal Air Force Marshal and explain how to become an air marshal.Key takeaways:\n\nAn air marshal is one of the highest ranks in the RAF, typically held by officers who already have the rank of Chief of the Defence Staff or Chiefs of the Air Staff.\n\nJoining the RAF can involve completing a university course with air military training, direct application to the RAF for air officer training, or aspiring RAF pilots completing an intensive 30-week Initial Officer Training course at the RAF's Cranwell facility.\n\nProgressing to the rank of an air marshal involves moving through a variety of roles and ranks in the RAF, continually improving skills and qualifications, and demonstrating strong leadership and communication skills.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat is an air marshal?\n\nAn air marshal (Air Mshl) is one of the highest ranks in the Royal Air Force (RAF). Depending on an officer's experience it's either a three- or four-star rank. This is because air marshal is both a standalone rank and a common name for air chief marshals. An officer can become an air marshal in two instances. Firstly, it's when they already have the rank of Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). Secondly, Chiefs of the Air Staff (CAS) get this rank on their last day of service before retirement. After receiving the rank of an air marshal, they retain it for life.Related: Joining the British army after university (Plus salaries)\n\nHow to become an air marshal\n\nKnowing how to become an air marshal can help you gather the resources necessary for pursuing this challenging and long career path. Here are some key steps to think about when preparing for joining and advancing within the Royal Air Force:\n\n1. Make sure you meet the basic RAF requirements\n\nBefore you enrol in the military, it's important to make sure you meet all the requirements for aspiring RAF officers. Regardless of the path you choose to pursue to join the military, the Royal Air Force expects candidates to do the following:\n\nbe over 17.5 years old\n\nhave UK citizenship\n\nbe in good physical shape\n\npass a series of medical, security and enhanced background checks\n\nIn addition to the age and background requirements, it's beneficial to have specific soft skills. This includes strong leadership and communication skills, which you'd use when managing teams of airmen and airwomen. Due to the nature of the field, completing tasks and receiving higher ranks may be easier for you if you're persistent, can work well under pressure and know how to easily accept criticism.Related: How to become an RAF pilot (With definition and steps)\n\n2. Join the military\n\nOnce you know that the air force is the branch of the army you want to join, there are several paths you can take to become a member of the RAF. These include:\n\nComplete a university course with air military training\n\nMany RAF officers choose to join the profession through university. To do that, you may consider the University Air Squadron (UAS) programme that allows you to sample what it's like to work for the RAF while completing your undergraduate degree. As a part of UAS, you'd learn how to fly for free while experienced air officers supervise your practical learning. UAS also provides you with opportunities to complete adventure training and engage in charity work, which is an important element of the squadron.Related: The complete guide to how to become an astronaut\n\nApply directly\n\nYou can also apply directly for air officer training with the RAF. To do that, visit the RAF's recruitment website to browse open roles. Depending on your situation and background, you can join as an engineer, apprentice, graduate or rejoiner. With aspirations to become an air marshal, it's usually best to explore roles for graduates, as they're the ones who receive training that concentrates on building their military leadership skills.To qualify for RAF training through a direct application, it's important to have at least five GCSEs at grades 9 to 4 (A* to C). This includes GCSEs in English, maths and at least one science subject. Once your application gets the RAF's acceptance, you're likely to take an aptitude test and attend an interview at the Officers and Aircrew Selection Centre at RAF College in Cranwell, during which officers and RAF representatives can assess your potential for the profession.Related: How to become an army officer (With roles and requirements)\n\n3. Complete pilot training\n\nIf you joined the RAF as a member of the ground branch, it's critical that you undertake pilot training. Aspiring RAF pilots usually go through an extensive 30-week Initial Officer Training course at the Royal Air Force's Cranwell facility. This programme prepares you for working as a junior officer, for instance, by offering you advanced survival training. After completing the course, you have the option to move to one of the RAF Elementary Flying Training Schools (EFTS), which takes four months to complete. Shortly before completion, instructors would qualify you for flying the fast jets, rotary wings or multi-engine pathways.Related: How to become a royal air force pilot: a step-by-step guide\n\n4. Become a commissioned air officer\n\nAir marshals are commissioned air officers. Commissioned officers are subordinate directly to the monarch and hold commission from their power. In the Royal Air Force, commissioned officers have ranks from pilot officers through to the Marshal of the Royal Air Force. To become a pilot officer, who is a commissioned officer of the lowest rank, it's only necessary to have enough experience in the air force, as promotion to this rank happens automatically after some time in the service.Related: Traffic marshall CV example (With tips)\n\n5. Advance to senior roles\n\nAs you gain experience in the air force, it's important that you're dedicated to continuously improving your skills and qualifications. For example, you can try to pass the Qualified Weapons Instructor Course, which is one of the most prestigious RAF courses. Air officers are in management roles, which means they oversee the work of those with lower ranks to themselves. Once you reach the rank of a light lieutenant, making sure you know how to lead directly contributes to your promotion potential. This is because advancing to squadron leader and above, including air marshal, happens on merit.Related: 13 types of jobs in the British armed forces (And salaries)\n\nOfficer ranks in the Royal Air Force\n\nTo better understand the role of an air marshal, it's helpful to review the ranks that air officers in the military receive. Here they are from lowest to highest:\n\nOfficer cadet (Off Cdt): Officer cadet is the lowest air military rank that cadets receive during training. They don't hold the Queen's commissions yet, which means others don't salute them.\n\nPilot officer (Plt Off): Pilot officer is the lowest commissioned RAF rank. It's applicable to ground branches, as pilots skip this rank and become flying officers after advancing from officer cadets.\n\nFlying officer (Fg Off): Flying officer is a junior RAF rank, which can apply to both air and ground officers. In some instances, this is the first rank that officers receive after completing their military training.\n\nFlight lieutenant (Flt Lt): A flight lieutenant is the equivalent of a lieutenant in the Royal Navy. The promotion process in the RAF is automatic until this rank.\n\nSquadron leader (Sqn Ldr): Squadron leader is a rank that officers receive on merit after obtaining the necessary skills, experience and knowledge. After becoming squadron leaders, air officers remain in the RAF until they retire or resign voluntarily.\n\nWing commander (Wg Cdr): Wing commander is a rank that officers who command a subdivision of an RAF station receive.\n\nGroup captain (Gp Capt): Group captain is a senior commissioned air officer rank that the RAF adopted from the British Army. It's equivalent to a colonel in the British Army.\n\nAir commodore (Air Cdre): Air commodore is a one-star air rank, equivalent to a brigadier in the British Army. Officers with this rank are in direct support of the air officer commanding.\n\nAir vice-marshal (AVM): Air vice-marshal is a two-star rank in the RAF immediately below air marshal. It's equivalent to a major-general in the British Army.\n\nAir marshal (Air Mshl): Air marshal is a three-star rank immediately above air vice-marshal and below air chief marshal.\n\nAir chief marshal (Air Chf Mshl): Air chief marshal is a four-star officer rank and the highest peacetime rank in the RAF, which makes it an equivalent of a general in the British Army. When talking about air chief marshals, people often refer to them as air marshals.\n\nMarshal of the Royal Air Force (MRAF): Marshal of the Royal Air Force is the highest possible rank in the RAF, to which promotions in the standard promotion process are no longer available during peacetime. The MRAF rank is only available to officers during wartime, members of the Royal Family or senior air officers with special accomplishments for the Queen.\n\nPlease note that none of the companies, institutions or organisations mentioned in this article are affiliated with Indeed.\n\n&nbsp;"
