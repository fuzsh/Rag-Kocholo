        "text": "South Africa\n\nFollowing the Zulu victory at Isandlwana in 1879, Wolseley was appointed Governor and High Commissioner of Natal. However, by the time he arrived, King Cetshwayo had been defeated and Wolseley's role was limited to the capture of the Zulu leader.\n\nAfter granting the Transvaal the constitution of a crown colony, Wolseley returned home to the more congenial appointment of Quartermaster-General at the War Office. For his services in South Africa he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.\n\nHis struggles to continue the Cardwell reforms of the army brought him into conflict with the Commander-in-Chief, the Duke of Cambridge, whom he privately called 'that great German bumble-bee'. He was subsequently parodied for these views by Gilbert and Sullivan in their comic opera, 'The Pirates of Penzance' (1879)."
