        "text": "Field marshal is the most senior military rank that can be awarded to an individual. Although this varies across countries, it is generally the highest rank that can be achieved and is considered to be a five-star rank. In order to receive this prestigious position, usually a general must have accomplished a fantastic feat during wartime—although, this isn’t always the case.\n\nIn some countries, such as Spain and Mexico, it was once used to denote divisional command, while in Portugal and Brazil it was used to denote brigade command. This rank, certainly, is highly prestigious and therefore it is only logical that it would have been held by some extremely well-known individuals throughout history. These are seven of the most famous, including a few that one could say aren’t famous for the right reasons.\n\nBernard Montgomery\n\nField Marshal Bernard Montgomery is perhaps the most famous of the more modern senior-ranking British officers. “Monty,” as he was nicknamed, served in the First World War, and the Irish War of Independence, but unequivocally earned his fame during his service in the Second World War. He led the Allies in North Africa against Erwin Rommel, as well as led both British and Canadian forces during the landings in Italy and Normandy.\n\nIt wasn’t until September 1, 1944 that Montgomery was given the position of field marshal. Although he accomplished many impressive feats in battle, this wasn’t why he was promoted. Rather, the growing number of American forces prompted General Eisenhower to be made Ground Forces Commander, a purely political move. As was Montgomery’s promotion, given by Winston Churchill in an effort to compensate him for no longer holding the position.\n\nIn North Africa, he helped win the first major land victory for the Allies with the Second Battle of El Alamein in 1942 and was instrumental in the Allied landings in Sicily and Italy. During D-Day, after being made a field marshal, Montgomery was put in charge of all the ground forces defeating many Germans in the process. After some setbacks, he oversaw the crossing of the Rhine, eventually accepting German surrender in Denmark, northern Germany, and the Netherlands.\n\nJohannes Erwin Eugen Rommel\n\nPerhaps one of the most notorious and well-known field marshals, Erwin Rommel served in the North African theater of the Second World War leading the Axis troops. As with many of the high-ranking officers of the Second World War, Rommel had previously served in the First World War where he was already a highly decorated officer. When war broke out again, he first commanded the 7th Panzer Division during the invasion of France.\n\nHe was soon transferred to North Africa where he earned a fierce reputation as a tank commander, and then earned himself a promotion to the position of field marshal fairly soon after. It was during this campaign that he earned the nickname “the Desert Fox.” Although he was considered the enemy, the British knew him to be particularly chivalrous, and he would often praise them for their actions if they out-maneuvered his forces.\n\nRosemary Giles\n\nRosemary Giles is a history content writer with Hive Media.
