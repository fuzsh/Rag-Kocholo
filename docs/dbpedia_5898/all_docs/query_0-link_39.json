The poems below answer these questions. From least greatest (10) to greatest greatest (1), the poems in this list are limited to ones originally written in the English language and which are 50 lines or less, excluding poems like Homer’s Iliad, Edgar Allan Poe’s “Raven,” Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy, and Lord Byron’s mock epic Don Juan. Each poem is followed by some brief analysis. Many good poems and poets had to be left off of this list. In the comments section below, feel free to make additions or construct your own lists. You can also submit analyses of classic poetry to submissions@classicalpoets.org. They will be considered for publication on this website.\n\nRelated Content\n\n10 Greatest Love Poems Ever Written\n\n10 Greatest Sonnets Concerning Other Poets\n\nThe Earliest English Poems Ever Written\n\n10 Greatest Novels Ever Written10 Greatest Poems about Death: A Grim Reader\n\n.\n\n10. “The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost (1874-1963)\n\nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood,\n\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\n\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\n\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\n\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\n\nThen took the other, as just as fair,\n\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,\n\nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;\n\nThough as for that the passing there\n\nHad worn them really about the same,\n\nAnd both that morning equally lay\n\nIn leaves no step had trodden black.\n\nOh, I kept the first for another day!\n\nYet knowing how way leads on to way,\n\nI doubted if I should ever come back.\n\nI shall be telling this with a sigh\n\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:\n\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I—\n\nI took the one less traveled by,\n\nAnd that has made all the difference.\n\n.\n\nAnalysis of the Poem\n\nThis poem deals with that big noble question of “How to make a difference in the world?” On first reading, it tells us that the choice one makes really does matter, ending: “I took the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the difference.”\n\nA closer reading reveals that the lonely choice that was made earlier by our traveling narrator maybe wasn’t all that significant since both roads were pretty much the same anyway (“Had warn them really about the same”) and it is only in the remembering and retelling that it made a difference. We are left to ponder if the narrator had instead traveled down “The Road Not Taken” might it have also made a difference as well. In a sense, “The Road Not Taken” tears apart the traditional view of individualism, which hinges on the importance of choice, as in the case of democracy in general (choosing a candidate), as well as various constitutional freedoms: choice of religion, choice of words (freedom of speech), choice of group (freedom of assembly), and choice of source of information (freedom of press). For example, we might imagine a young man choosing between being a carpenter or a banker later seeing great significance in his choice to be a banker, but in fact there was not much in his original decision at all other than a passing fancy. In this, we see the universality of human beings: the roads leading to carpenter and banker being basically the same and the carpenters and bankers at the end of them—seeming like individuals who made significant choices—really being just part of the collective of the human race.\n\nThen is this poem not about the question “How to make a difference in the world?” after all? No. It is still about this question. The ending is the most clear and striking part. If nothing else, readers are left with the impression that our narrator, who commands beautiful verse, profound imagery, and time itself (“ages and ages hence”) puts value on striving to make a difference. The striving is reconstituted and complicated here in reflection, but our hero wants to make a difference and so should we. That is why this is a great poem, from a basic or close reading perspective.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n9. “The New Colossus” by Emma Lazarus (1849-1887)\n\nNot like the brazen giant of Greek fame,\n\nWith conquering limbs astride from land to land;\n\nHere at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand\n\nA mighty woman with a torch, whose flame\n\nIs the imprisoned lightning, and her name\n\nMother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand\n\nGlows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command\n\nThe air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.\n\n“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she\n\nWith silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,\n\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n\nThe wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n\nSend these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,\n\nI lift my lamp beside the golden door!”\n\n.\n\nAnalysis of the Poem\n\nInscribed on the Statue of Liberty in New York harbor, this sonnet may have the greatest placement of any English poem. It also has one of the greatest placements in history. Lazarus compares the Statue of Liberty to the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Like the Statue of Liberty, the Colossus of Rhodes was an enormous god-like statue positioned in a harbor. Although the Colossus of Rhodes no longer stands, it symbolizes the ancient Greek world and the greatness of the ancient Greek and Roman civilization, which was lost for a thousand years to the West, and only fully recovered again during the Renaissance. “The New Colossus” succinctly crystallizes the connection between the ancient world and America, a modern nation. It’s a connection that can be seen in the White House and other state and judicial buildings across America that architecturally mirror ancient Greek and Roman buildings; and in the American political system that mirrors Athenian Democracy and Roman Republicanism.\n\nIn the midst of this vast comparison of the ancient and the American, Lazarus still manages to clearly render America’s distinct character. It is the can-do spirit of taking those persecuted and poor from around the world and giving them a new opportunity and hope for the future, what she calls “the golden door.” It is a uniquely scrappy and compassionate quality that sets Americans apart from the ancients. The relevance of this poem stretches all the way back to the pilgrims fleeing religious persecution in Europe to the controversies surrounding modern immigrants from Mexico and the Middle East. While circumstances today have changed drastically, there is no denying that this open door was part of what made America great once upon a time. It’s the perfect depiction of this quintessential Americanness that makes “The New Colossus” also outstanding.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n8. “Ozymandias” by Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822)\n\nI met a traveler from an antique land\n\nWho said: “Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\n\nStand in the desert . . . Near them, on the sand,\n\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\n\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\n\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\n\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\n\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:\n\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\n\n‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\n\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’\n\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\n\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\n\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.”\n\n.\n\nAnalysis of the Poem\n\nIn this winding story within a story within a poem, Shelley paints for us the image of the ruins of a statue of ancient Egyptian king Ozymandias, who is today commonly known as Ramesses II. This king is still regarded as the greatest and most powerful Egyptian pharaoh. Yet, all that’s left of the statue are his legs, which tell us it was huge and impressive; the shattered head and snarling face, which tell us how tyrannical he was; and his inscribed quote hailing the magnificent structures that he built and that have been reduced to dust, which tells us they might not have been quite as magnificent as Ozymandias imagined. The image of a dictator-like king whose kingdom is no more creates a palpable irony. But, beyond that there is a perennial lesson about the inescapable and destructive forces of time, history, and nature. Success, fame, power, money, health, and prosperity can only last so long before fading into “lone and level sands.”\n\nThere are yet more layers of meaning here that elevate this into one of the greatest poems. In terms of lost civilizations that show the ephemeralness of human pursuits, there is no better example than the Egyptians—who we associate with such dazzling monuments as the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid at Giza (that stands far taller than the Statue of Liberty)—yet who completely lost their spectacular language, culture, and civilization. If the forces of time, history, and nature can take down the Egyptian civilization, it begs the question, “Who’s next?” Additionally, Ozymandias is believed to have been the villainous pharaoh who enslaved the ancient Hebrews and who Moses led the exodus from. If all ordinary pursuits, such as power and fame, are but dust, what remains, the poem suggests, are spirituality and morality—embodied by the ancient Hebrew faith. If you don’t have those then in the long run you are a “colossal wreck.” Thus, the perfectly composed scene itself, the Egyptian imagery, and the Biblical backstory convey a perennial message and make this a great poem.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n7. “Ode on a Grecian Urn” by John Keats (1795-1821)\n\nThou still unravish’d bride of quietness,\n\nThou foster-child of silence and slow time,\n\nSylvan historian, who canst thus express\n\nA flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:\n\nWhat leaf-fring’d legend haunts about thy shape\n\nOf deities or mortals, or of both,\n\nIn Tempe or the dales of Arcady?\n\nWhat men or gods are these? What maidens loth?\n\nWhat mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?\n\nWhat pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?\n\nHeard melodies are sweet, but those unheard\n\nAre sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;\n\nNot to the sensual ear, but, more endear’d,\n\nPipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:\n\nFair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave\n\nThy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;\n\nBold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,\n\nThough winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;\n\nShe cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,\n\nFor ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!\n\nAh, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed\n\nYour leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;\n\nAnd, happy melodist, unwearied,\n\nFor ever piping songs for ever new;\n\nMore happy love! more happy, happy love!\n\nFor ever warm and still to be enjoy’d,\n\nFor ever panting, and for ever young;\n\nAll breathing human passion far above,\n\nThat leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy’d,\n\nA burning forehead, and a parching tongue.\n\nWho are these coming to the sacrifice?\n\nTo what green altar, O mysterious priest,\n\nLead’st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,\n\nAnd all her silken flanks with garlands drest?\n\nWhat little town by river or sea shore,\n\nOr mountain-built with peaceful citadel,\n\nIs emptied of this folk, this pious morn?\n\nAnd, little town, thy streets for evermore\n\nWill silent be; and not a soul to tell\n\nWhy thou art desolate, can e’er return.\n\nO Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede\n\nOf marble men and maidens overwrought,\n\nWith forest branches and the trodden weed;\n\nThou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought\n\nAs doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!\n\nWhen old age shall this generation waste,\n\nThou shalt remain, in midst of other woe\n\nThan ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say’st,\n\n“Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all\n\nYe know on earth, and all ye need to know.”\n\n.\n\nAnalysis of the Poem\n\nAs if in response to Shelley’s “Ozymandias,” Keats’s “Ode on a Grecian Urn” offers a sort of antidote to the inescapable and destructive force of time. Indeed, “Ode on a Grecian Urn” was published in 1819 just a year or so after “Ozymandias.” The antidote is simple: art. The art on the Grecian urn—which is basically a decorative pot from ancient Greece—has survived for thousands of years. While empires rose and fell, the Grecian urn survived. Musicians, trees, lovers, heifers, and priests all continue dying decade after decade and century after century, but their artistic depictions on the Grecian urn live on for what seems eternity.\n\nThis realization about the timeless nature of art is not new now nor was it in the 1800s, but Keats has chosen a perfect example since ancient Greek civilization so famously disappeared into the ages, being subsumed by the Romans, and mostly lost until the Renaissance a thousand years later. Now, the ancient Greeks are all certainly dead (like the king Ozymandias in Shelley’s poem) but the Greek art and culture live on through Renaissance painters, the Olympic Games, endemic Neoclassical architecture, and, of course, the Grecian urn.\n\nFurther, what is depicted on the Grecian urn is a variety of life that makes the otherwise cold urn feel alive and vibrant. This aliveness is accentuated by Keats’s barrage of questions and blaring exclamations: “More happy love! more happy, happy love!” Art, he seems to suggest, is more alive and real than we might imagine. Indeed, the last two lines can be read as the urn itself talking: “Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” In these profound lines, Keats places us within ignorance, suggesting that what we know on earth is limited, but that artistic beauty, which he has now established is alive, is connected with truth. Thus, we can escape ignorance, humanness, and certain death and approach another form of life and truth through the beauty of art. This effectively completes the thought that began in Ozymandias and makes this a great poem one notch up from its predecessor.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n6. “The Tiger” by William Blake (1757-1827)\n\nTiger Tiger, burning bright,\n\nIn the forests of the night;\n\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\n\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\n\nIn what distant deeps or skies.\n\nBurnt the fire of thine eyes?\n\nOn what wings dare he aspire?\n\nWhat the hand, dare seize the fire?\n\nAnd what shoulder, and what art,\n\nCould twist the sinews of thy heart?\n\nAnd when thy heart began to beat,\n\nWhat dread hand? and what dread feet?\n\nWhat the hammer? what the chain,\n\nIn what furnace was thy brain?\n\nWhat the anvil? what dread grasp,\n\nDare its deadly terrors clasp!\n\nWhen the stars threw down their spears\n\nAnd water’d heaven with their tears:\n\nDid he smile his work to see?\n\nDid he who made the Lamb make thee?\n\nTiger Tiger burning bright,\n\nIn the forests of the night:\n\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\n\nDare frame thy fearful symmetry?\n\n.\n\nAnalysis of the Poem\n\nThis poem contemplates a question arising from the idea of creation by an intelligent creator. The question is this: If there is a loving, compassionate God or gods who created human beings and whose great powers exceed the comprehension of human beings, as many major religions hold, then why would such a powerful being allow evil into the world. Evil here is represented by a tiger that might, should you be strolling in the Indian or Chinese wild in the 1700s, have leapt out and killed you. What would have created such a dangerous and evil creature? How could it possibly be the same divine blacksmith who created a cute harmless fluffy lamb or who created Jesus, also known as the “Lamb of God” (which the devoutly Christian Blake was probably also referring to here). To put it another way, why would such a divine blacksmith create beautiful innocent children and then also allow such children to be slaughtered. The battery of questions brings this mystery to life with lavish intensity.\n\nDoes Blake offer an answer to this question of evil from a good God? It would seem not on the surface. But, this wouldn’t be a great poem if it were really that open ended. The answer comes in the way that Blake explains the question. Blake’s language peels away the mundane world and offers a look at the super-reality to which poets are privy. We fly about in “forests of the night” through “distant deeps or skies” looking for where the fire in the tiger’s eye was taken from by the Creator. This is the reality of expanded time, space, and perception that Blake so clearly elucidates elsewhere with the lines “To see a world in a grain of sand / And a heaven in a wild flower, / Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, / And eternity in an hour” (“Auguries of Innocence”). This indirectly tells us that the reality that we ordinarily know and perceive is really insufficient, shallow, and deceptive. Where we perceive the injustice of the wild tiger something else entirely may be transpiring. What we ordinarily take for truth may really be far from it: a thought that is scary, yet also sublime or beautiful—like the beautiful and fearsome tiger. Thus, this poem is great because it concisely and compellingly presents a question that still plagues humanity today, as well as a key clue to the answer.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n5. “On His Blindness” by John Milton (1608-1674)\n\nWhen I consider how my light is spent\n\nEre half my days in this dark world and wide,\n\nAnd that one talent which is death to hide\n\nLodg’d with me useless, though my soul more bent\n\nTo serve therewith my Maker, and present\n\nMy true account, lest he returning chide,\n\n“Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?”\n\nI fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent\n\nThat murmur, soon replies: “God doth not need\n\nEither man’s work or his own gifts: who best\n\nBear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state\n\nIs kingly; thousands at his bidding speed\n\nAnd post o’er land and ocean without rest:\n\nThey also serve who only stand and wait.”\n\n.\n\nAnalysis of the Poem\n\nThis poem deals with one’s limitations and shortcomings in life. Everyone has them and Milton’s blindness is a perfect example of this. His eyesight gradually worsened and he became totally blind at the age of 42. This happened after he served in an eminent position under Oliver Cromwell’s revolutionary Puritan government in England. To put it simply, Milton rose to the highest position an English writer might at the time and then sank all the way down to a state of being unable read or write on his own. How pathetic!\n\nThe genius of this poem comes in the way that Milton transcends the misery he feels. First, he frames himself, not as an individual suffering or lonely, but as a failed servant to the Creator: God. While Milton is disabled, God here is enabled through imagery of a king commanding thousands. This celestial monarch, his ministers and troops, and his kingdom itself are invisible to human eyes anyway, so already Milton has subtly undone much of his failing by subverting the necessity for human vision. More straightforwardly, through the voice of Patience, Milton explains that serving the celestial monarch only requires bearing those hardships, which really aren’t that bad (he calls them “mild”) that life has burdened you with (like a “yoke” put on an ox). This grand mission from heaven may be as simple as standing and waiting, having patience, and understanding the order of the universe. Thus, this is a great poem because Milton has not only dispelled sadness over a major shortcoming in life but also shown how the shortcoming is itself imbued with an extraordinary and uplifting purpose.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n4. “A Psalm of Life” by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882)\n\nWhat the heart of the young man said to the Psalmist\n\nTell me not, in mournful numbers,\n\nLife is but an empty dream!\n\nFor the soul is dead that slumbers,\n\nAnd things are not what they seem.\n\nLife is real! Life is earnest!\n\nAnd the grave is not its goal;\n\nDust thou art, to dust returnest,\n\nWas not spoken of the soul.\n\nNot enjoyment, and not sorrow,\n\nIs our destined end or way;\n\nBut to act, that each tomorrow\n\nFind us farther than today.\n\nArt is long, and Time is fleeting,\n\nAnd our hearts, though stout and brave,\n\nStill, like muffled drums, are beating\n\nFuneral marches to the grave.\n\nIn the world’s broad field of battle,\n\nIn the bivouac of Life,\n\nBe not like dumb, driven cattle!\n\nBe a hero in the strife!\n\nTrust no Future, howe’er pleasant!\n\nLet the dead Past bury its dead!\n\nAct,—act in the living Present!\n\nHeart within, and God o’erhead!\n\nLives of great men all remind us\n\nWe can make our lives sublime,\n\nAnd, departing, leave behind us\n\nFootprints on the sands of time;—\n\nFootprints, that perhaps another,\n\nSailing o’er life’s solemn main,\n\nA forlorn and shipwrecked brother,\n\nSeeing, shall take heart again.\n\nLet us, then, be up and doing,\n\nWith a heart for any fate;\n\nStill achieving, still pursuing,\n\nLearn to labor and to wait.\n\nAnalysis of the Poem\n\nIn this nine-stanza poem, the first six stanzas are rather vague since each stanza seems to begin a new thought. Instead, the emphasis here is on a feeling rather than a rational train of thought. What feeling? It seems to be a reaction against science, which is focused on calculations (“mournful numbers”) and empirical evidence, of which there is no, or very little, to prove the existence of the soul. Longfellow lived when the Industrial Revolution was in high gear and the ideals of science, rationality, and reason flourished. From this perspective, the fact that the first six stanzas do not follow a rational train of thought makes perfect sense.\n\nAccording to the poem, the force of science seems to restrain one’s spirit or soul (“for the soul is dead that slumbers”), lead to inaction and complacency from which we must break free (“Act,—act in the living Present! / Heart within, and God o’erhead!”) for lofty purposes such as Art, Heart, and God before time runs out (“Art is long, and Time is fleeting”). The last three stanzas—which, having broken free from science by this point in the poem, read more smoothly—suggest that this acting for lofty purposes can lead to greatness and can help our fellow man.\n\nWe might think of the entire poem as a clarion call to do great things, however insignificant they may seem in the present and on the empirically observable surface. That may mean writing a poem and entering it into a poetry contest, when you know the chances of your poem winning are very small; risking your life for something you believe in when you know it is not popular or it is misunderstood; or volunteering for a cause that, although it may seem hopeless, you feel is truly important. Thus, the greatness of this poem lies in its ability to so clearly prescribe a method for greatness in our modern world.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n3. “Daffodils” by William Wordsworth (1770-1850)\n\nI wandered lonely as a cloud\n\nThat floats on high o’er vales and hills,\n\nWhen all at once I saw a crowd,\n\nA host, of golden daffodils;\n\nBeside the lake, beneath the trees,\n\nFluttering and dancing in the breeze.\n\nContinuous as the stars that shine\n\nAnd twinkle on the milky way,\n\nThey stretched in never-ending line\n\nAlong the margin of a bay:\n\nTen thousand saw I at a glance,\n\nTossing their heads in sprightly dance.\n\nThe waves beside them danced; but they\n\nOut-did the sparkling waves in glee:\n\nA poet could not but be gay,\n\nIn such a jocund company:\n\nI gazed—and gazed—but little thought\n\nWhat wealth the show to me had brought:\n\nFor oft, when on my couch I lie\n\nIn vacant or in pensive mood,\n\nThey flash upon that inward eye\n\nWhich is the bliss of solitude;\n\nAnd then my heart with pleasure fills,\n\nAnd dances with the daffodils.\n\n.\n\nAnalysis of the Poem\n\nThrough the narrator’s chance encounter with a field of daffodils by the water, we are presented with the power and beauty of the natural world. It sounds simple enough, but there are several factors that contribute to this poem’s greatness. First, the poem comes at a time when the Western world is industrializing and man feels spiritually lonely in the face of an increasingly godless worldview. This feeling is perfectly harnessed by the depiction of wandering through the wilderness “lonely as a cloud” and by the ending scene of the narrator sadly lying on his couch “in vacant or in pensive mood” and finding happiness in solitude. The daffodils then become more than nature; they become a companion and a source of personal joy. Second, the very simplicity itself of enjoying nature—flowers, trees, the sea, the sky, the mountains etc.—is perfectly manifested by the simplicity of the poem: the four stanzas simply begin with daffodils, describe daffodils, compare daffodils to something else, and end on daffodils, respectively. Any common reader can easily get this poem, as easily as her or she might enjoy a walk around a lake.\n\nThird, Wordsworth has subtly put forward more than just an ode to nature here. Every stanza mentions dancing and the third stanza even calls the daffodils “a show.” At this time in England, one might have paid money to see an opera or other performance of high artistic quality. Here, Wordsworth is putting forward the idea that nature can offer similar joys and even give you “wealth” instead of taking it from you, undoing the idea that beauty is attached to earthly money and social status. This, coupled with the language and topic of the poem, which are both relatively accessible to the common man, make for a great poem that demonstrates the all-encompassing and accessible nature of beauty and its associates, truth and bliss.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n2. “Holy Sonnet 10: Death, Be Not Proud” by John Donne (1572-1631)\n\nDeath, be not proud, though some have called thee\n\nMighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;\n\nFor those whom thou think’st thou dost overthrow\n\nDie not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.\n\nFrom rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,\n\nMuch pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,\n\nAnd soonest our best men with thee do go,\n\nRest of their bones, and soul’s delivery.\n\nThou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,\n\nAnd dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,\n\nAnd poppy or charms can make us sleep as well\n\nAnd better than thy stroke; why swell’st thou then?\n\nOne short sleep past, we wake eternally\n\nAnd death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.\n\n.\n\nAnalysis of the Poem\n\nDeath is a perennial subject of fear and despair. But, this sonnet seems to say that it need not be this way. The highly focused attack on Death’s sense of pride uses a grocery list of rhetorical attacks: First, sleep, which is the closest human experience to death, is actually quite nice. Second, all great people die sooner or later and the process of death could be viewed as joining them. Third, Death is under the command of higher authorities such as fate, which controls accidents, and kings, who wage wars; from this perspective, Death seems no more than a pawn in a larger chess game within the universe. Fourth, Death must associate with some unsavory characters: “poison, wars, and sickness.” Yikes! They must make unpleasant coworkers! (You can almost see Donne laughing as he wrote this.) Fifth, “poppy and charms” (drugs) can do the sleep job as well as Death or better. Death, you’re fired!\n\nThe sixth, most compelling, and most serious reason is that if one truly believes in a soul then Death is really nothing to worry about. The soul lives eternally and this explains line 4, when Donne says that Death can’t kill him. If you recognize the subordinate position of the body in the universe and identify more fully with your soul, then you can’t be killed in an ordinary sense. Further, this poem is so great because of its universal application. Fear of death is so natural an instinct and Death itself so all-encompassing and inescapable for people, that the spirit of this poem and applicability of it extends to almost any fear or weakness of character that one might have. Confronting, head on, such a fear or weakness, as Donne has done here, allows human beings to transcend their condition and their perception of Death, more fully perhaps than one might through art by itself—as many poets from this top ten list seem to say—since the art may or may not survive may or may not be any good, but the intrinsic quality of one’s soul lives eternally. Thus, Donne leaves a powerful lesson to learn from: confront what you fear head on and remember that there is nothing to fear on earth if you believe in a soul.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n1. “Sonnet 18” by William Shakespeare (1564-1616)\n\nShall I compare thee to a summer’s day?\n\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\n\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\n\nAnd summer’s lease hath all too short a date:\n\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\n\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimm’d;\n\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\n\nBy chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimm’d;\n\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade\n\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;\n\nNor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,\n\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow’st;\n\nSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\n\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\n\n.\n\nAnalysis of the Poem\n\nBasically, the narrator tells someone he esteems highly that this person is better than a summer’s day because a summer’s day is often too hot and too windy, and especially because a summer’s day doesn’t last; it must fade away just as people, plants, and animals die. But, this esteemed person does not lose beauty or fade away like a summer’s day because he or she is eternally preserved in the narrator’s own poetry. “So long lives this, and this gives life to thee” means “This poetry lives long, and this poetry gives life to you.”\n\nFrom a modern perspective this poem might come off as pompous (assuming the greatness of one’s own poetry), arbitrary (criticizing a summer’s day upon what seems a whim), and sycophantic (praising someone without substantial evidence). How then could this possibly be number one? After the bad taste of an old flavor to a modern tongue wears off, we realize that this is the very best of poetry. This is not pompous because Shakespeare actually achieves greatness and creates an eternal poem. It is okay to recognize poetry as great if it is great and it is okay to recognize an artistic hierarchy. In fact, it is absolutely necessary in educating, guiding, and leading others. The attack on a summer’s day is not arbitrary. Woven throughout the language is an implicit connection between human beings, the natural world (“a summer’s day”), and heaven (the sun is “the eye of heaven”). A comparison of a human being to a summer’s day immediately opens the mind to unconventional possibilities; to spiritual perspectives; to the ethereal realm of poetry and beauty. The unabashed praise for someone without a hint as to even the gender or accomplishments of the person is not irrational or sycophantic. It is a pure and simple way of approaching our relationships with other people, assuming the best. It is a happier way to live—immediately free from the depression, stress, and cynicism that creeps into our hearts. Thus, this poem is strikingly and refreshingly bold, profound, and uplifting.\n\nFinally, as to the question of overcoming death, fear, and the decay of time, an overarching question in these great poems, Shakespeare adroitly answers them all by skipping the question, suggesting it is of no consequence. He wields such sublime power that he is unmoved and can instead offer remedy, his verse, at will to those he sees befitting. How marvelous!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nCODEC Stories:"
