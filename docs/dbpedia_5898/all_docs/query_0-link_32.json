        "text": "★★★★☆\n\n4.5 stars. Thomas Hardy’s novels are known for their melancholic beauty, and The Woodlanders (1887) is no exception. A somewhat farcical tragedy of love and betrayal, this 440-page novel follows the hearts and heartaches of childhood sweethearts, Giles Winterborne and Grace Melbury.\n\nReturning to her native Little Hintock with all the airs and bookish learning of her expensive education, Grace is no longer the rustic timber merchant’s daughter who grew up among the cider-makers and forest labourers of the woods around her father’s home. Giles is a good man, certainly, but the ambitious Mr Melbury, impressed by Grace’s newfound refinement and the opportunity it poses, soon sets his heart on securing his daughter a husband of higher social standing, no matter that he promised his dead friend, Giles’ father, that their children would one day marry.\n\nToo obediant a daughter to exert much influence over her destiny, and quickly mesmerised by the schmoozing self-confidence of the new local doctor, Fitzpiers, Grace acquieses to her father’s wishes. Too honourable to pursue her beyond the bounds of propriety, Giles accepts that their longstanding engagement is over. As Grace rises higher in the world and Giles’ fortunes take several turns for the worse, it seems that Grace may have had a lucky escape, but the comforts of wealth are not always an indicator of happiness. Continually tormented by mistaken choices and lost chances, Giles and Grace’s unhappy paths keep crossing, reminding them of what might have been.\n\nHe knew that a woman once given to a man for life took, as a rule, her lot as it came and made the best of it, without external interference; but for the first time he asked himself why this so generally should be done.\n\nThe plot is not Hardy’s strongest, relying heavily on chance encounters, some of which strike as a little too convenient. Also, neither Giles nor Grace are as psychologically complex as some of the author’s other characters. The Woodlanders distinguishes itself by being a somewhat gentler, funnier novel than Hardy is usually known for – I rather liked this, and there are some incidents in the first third that made me laugh aloud – but overall this book is a shade lighter than might be expected.\n\nI did really enjoy the read, however. Though it may be fairly described as a more forgiving tale than Far From the Madding Crowd and Tess of the D’Urbervilles, The Woodlanders is in its own way a complex narrative, weighing honourable conduct by its pains and sacrifice, and by its priceless reward. This might not be this author’s most famous novel, but perhaps that is our loss – Hardy rated it as his own favourite work. Characteristically perceptive in its analysis of human behaviour, this tale of wrongful societal pressures and belated realisation embodies quiet poignancy.\n\nOf all the Victorians, Hardy is certainly one of the most readable authors. Here, as in his other works, his profound understanding of the human condition and taste for the bittersweet lend his writing incredible depth and a wealth of human sympathy. Clever, moving and evocative in its green, earthy settings, The Woodlanders is a classic worth reading."
