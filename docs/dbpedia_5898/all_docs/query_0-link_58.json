        "text": "IT is still one of the great and most frightening openings in literature. I remember it from radio as a child, on the BBC's Sunday night serials, and I can still feel the horror in what happened (and the threat to my own family), as well as the control with which Thomas Hardy let nothing get in the way of the shock.\n\nI know that ''The Mayor of Casterbridge'' was done on television once, decades ago, with Alan Bates in the central role. But I never thought to see a movie from the book -- for how could a movie (that sentimental form) ever make such a man acceptable? You do not know his crime?\n\nIt is 1830 or so in Hardy's story (the events occurring more than 50 years before the novel was written). A man and his woman have been walking all day, sporting a ''thick hoar of dust,'' to get to Weydon-Priors, in Upper Wessex. The woman carries a child but she enjoys ''no society whatever'' from the man's presence, for there is a silence between them like the dust. Then Hardy gives you one of his softening-up hooks to the ribs -- ''they were clearly married: for only the married know such grim, silent company.''\n\nThe man has in profile ''a facial angle so slightly inclined as to be almost perpendicular'' -- try picturing that, try avoiding the sense of an unscalable rock face. (Read Thomas Hardy, movie men, and weep.) Once in the town, he starts to eat a gruel called firmament, mixed with rum. You feel him getting drunker and more reckless. He asks if there's any trade in town, but he means gambling. Then his bullish anger inhales deeper: ''I don't see why men who have got wives and don't want 'em shouldn't get rid of 'em as these gypsy fellows do their old horses.'' The onlookers are aghast, but the man refuses to be only playful, and in a few pages Hardy has him sell his wife and child for five guineas, notes and coins put ''in a high remote pocket.''\n\nThis is not a hundred miles from London, in a time of starvation and hunger, a few years before slavery was outlawed in the colonies. And it is the opening of ''The Mayor of Casterbridge,'' in which Michael Henchard blackens his soul for eternity.\n\nAnd in Michael Winterbottom's entirely surprising yet wondrous new film, ''The Claim,'' it may occur to the viewer that the snow is not just more abundant, more white and more morally intimidating than any snow put on film before. This snow is a natural cloak, a merciful decor, that Mr. Winterbottom's Henchard has so arranged for himself as to exclude and expunge, as far as possible, the gravel of sin.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
