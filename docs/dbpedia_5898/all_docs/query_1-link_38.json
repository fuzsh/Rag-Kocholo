        "text": "At the end of this absorbing textual anatomy of Thomas Hardy, J. Hillis Miller likens his author to an anthro pologist structure‐hunting among the Dorset tribes and presents him self as the critic in his turn structure hunting — “a watcher watching the watcher watch his characters.” And now the wheel comes full circle: an other Dorset novelist joins the chain of spies.\n\nI mention this because if I were an academic I should give high marks to Mr. Miller for his singlemindedness and scholarship. I agree largely with many of the conclusions he draws from his study — not always very new conclusions, but richly supported (from both chapter and the still un derrated verse) and often interesting ly elaborated. The elaboration may seem a shade far‐fetched at times, but of course Hardy lends himself to such over‐interpretation. He was the most secretive of Victorian writ ers, a kind of giant mouse, both reti icent and fierce, and with a mania for covering his creative and auto biographical tracks. Mr. Miller, in deed, has very little time for the latter element. The Tryphena affaire is given short shrift, along with all the other somewhat circumstantial speculation of Lois Deacon and Terry Coleman in “Providence and Mr. Hardy.”\n\nOn occasion one feels Mr. Miller is altogether too much the structural anthropologist on loan to literature. There is no literary criticism proper. Even that ludicrously bad book “The Well‐beloved” is let off lightly (the “oddest” novel); but then of course it is rich stuff for Hardyologists—especially those in love with “the endless spirals of the hermeneutical circle.” In a bizarre passage this particular hermeneut virtually dismisses auto biographical data as irrelevant to the understanding of a writer; and here, I am afraid, is where the practising novelist in his reviewer begins to take exception. Hardy's writing has been very thoroughly dismantled by the end of this book. Cogs, weights, levers, all labeled with functions, lie neatly ranged on the professor's desk. We learn a lot about how Hardy “worked” as a creative “machthe.” But I found increasingly that all this horological expertise only raised the hare that has been earlier denounced as a red herring.\n\nWhy was Hardy like this? What did happen in his real life in that dark and fertile decade between 1865 and 1875? Why did he break with Tryphena? Why did his first mar riage sour so disastrously fast? What real‐life factors structured his literary pessimism? To say that “the facts of Hardy's life . . . are not physical objects,” which I should have thought in any case highly debatable, is too easy a way out.\n\nMr. Miller, quoting the famous straw‐hat passage in the “Life,” argues from his hatred of in volvement that Hardy was, so to speak, socially impotent. Distance was love, closeness the inevitable death of love — thence the unhappy end ings, the attachment to the past, the mask of the omniscient narrator. Now I don't dispute for a moment that this complex sense of exile is the thing we most remember Hardy by, whether we see it as a central cold ness or a quasi‐Aeschylian tragic ob jectivity. But precisely because this is the great terra incognita, and one whose exploration must involve the man as well as the writer, I find Mr. Miller's approach one‐sided. In too much academic analysis nowa days one methodology — in this case, an anatomical or structuralist inter pretation — occludes others that are just as vital.\n\nMr. Miller suggests that Hardy took to literature in order to explore in volvements he knew himself banned from by his private nature. He pre sents it almost as an either‐or choice, as if Hardy said to himself: “Well, let's write a novel and see whether happy and lasting love between man and woman is possible.” This is surely absurd. Hardy set out to demonstrate what countless nonliterary factors (aphysical objects?) had conditioned him to be — and to see. There was something to be proven to the world, but not to the author.\n\nI think myself that Hardy was a profoundly frightened man; his guid ing horror was of nonexistence, whether in the guise of death or life. His obsession was really to ar rest, or discount, or evade time, since time is the greatest proof of in dividual futility. In a way he is fic tion's greatest memorialist, a com poser of epitaphs celebrating the dead event . . . the dead person, the dead way of life, the dead love, the dead dialect: the dead, always the dead resurrected in his art and enduring in his amber. All his determinism, his lack of faith in free will (both in his misleadingly named “Immanent Will” and man in general), spring from this horror. His, the art ist's, is the only viable healing touch. Here Mr. Miller does (as in all his discussions of Hardy's use of time) have many illuminating things to say. “As artist‐preserver he is the closest thing to a deity his universe has.”\n\nExactly; and I am not sure that this is not the true explanation of the decision to drop the novel‐writing and concentrate on the poetry. Mr. Miller proposes that Hardy as a novel ist was “written out” because narra tor and hero had converged too close in the last fictions; he had lost his “distance” as creator and observer. That may be a partial explanation; but it may equally have been the simple realization, in an aging pessi mist (and surreptitious miser), that the memorializing, or placation of the basic obsession, could be done more effectively and deeply in a more con centrated literary form.\n\nThis is not yet the book we need on the enigma of Wessex; but let me conclude by saying that I wish Mr. Miller might apply his perceptive in genuity, his admirable familiarity with both the poetry and the fiction (and new French critical theory, in cidentally) to a more comprehensive explanation of the whole phenom enon of Hardy. This present book might be an excellent first panel to such a diptych. Let me also praise his digressions and incidental lights on the general nature and problems of fiction, which deserve the interest of more than Hardy‐lovers in partic ular. The latter must certainly read it; for if it has some of the defects of the narrow angle, it has also high proportion of its virtues. ■"
