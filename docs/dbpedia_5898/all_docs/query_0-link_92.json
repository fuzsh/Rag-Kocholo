        "text": "25 Tess by Thomas Hardy\n\nDr. Neeru Tandon\n\n24.0 Learning outcome:\n\nThe students will learn about the plot outline, characters, themes and other aspects of Thomas Hardy’s fiction with special reference to Tess of the D’Urbervilles. Hardy created an immortal character of Tess as a pure woman. The students will grasp the basic essentials about Hardy and his famous novel Tess. Multiple-choice exercises will help them in assessing their knowledge and understanding of the work. Bibliography, list of websites and YouTube videos will help them in their in-depth study and further reading. Critical quotes and quotes from the book will also help them in understanding various literary aspects of the book.\n\n24.1: Introduction of the Novelist: Bio-Bibliographical details\n\nThomas Hardy: British Writer\n\nBorn: June 2, 1840 Upper Bockhampton, England\n\nDied: January 11, 1928 Dorchester, England\n\nUpon this discovery, the financially strapped Durbeyfield family learns of a nearby “relative,” and John and his wife Joan send Tess to “claim kin” in order to relieve their insolvent condition. While visiting the d’Urbervilles at The Slopes, Tess meets Alec d’Urberville, who gets enticed to Tess. Alec arranges for Tess to become the caretaker for his blind mother’s poultry, and Tess moves to The Slopes to take up the position. Tess spends several months at this job, resisting Alec’s attempts to seduce her. Finally, Alec takes advantage of her in the woods one night after a fair.\n\nPhase the Second: Maiden no More :The next phase of the book (“Maiden No More”) opens with Tess back at her parents’ house in the village of Marlott. Tess gives birth to a son, Sorrow, and works as a field worker on nearby farms. Sorrow becomes ill and dies in infancy, leaving Tess shattered. Tess moves to nearby Talbothays Dairy to become a milkmaid to a good-natured dairyman, Mr. Crick. At Talbothays, Tess enjoys a period of contentment and happiness. She befriends three of her fellow milkmaids—Izz, Retty, and Marian—and meets a man named Angel Clare, who turns out to be the man from the May Day dance at the beginning of the novel. She falls in love with him, and finally marries him. Tess has tried on several times to tell him about her past, but in vain. After the wedding, Tess and Angel confess their pasts to each other. Angel tells Tess about an affair he had with an older woman in London, and Tess tells Angel about her history with Alec. Tess forgives Angel for his past misdeeds, but Angel cannot forgive Tess for having a child with another man. He gives her some money and boards a ship bound for Brazil, where he thinks he might establish a farm. He tells Tess he will try to accept her past but warns her not to try to join him until he comes for her.\n\nAngel leaves her and goes to Brazil for a year. Tess returns to her parent’s house but soon leaves home again for work in another town at Flintcomb-Ash farm, where the working conditions are very severe. Tess is determined to see Angel’s family in nearby Emminster but loses her nerve at the last minute. On her return to Flintcomb, Tess sees Alec again, now an enthusiastic minister, discoursing to the people in the countryside. When Alec sees Tess, he is struck dumb and follows her to Flintcomb, asking her to marry him. Tess declines in the toughest expressions, but Alec is determined.\n\nTess learns from her sister Liza-Lu that her mother is near death, and Tess is forced to return home. Her mother recovers, but her father unexpectedly dies. When the family is evicted from their home, the burden of her family’s welfare falls on Tess’ shoulders. They have nowhere to go. Alex offers help and Tess knows that she cannot resist Alec’s money and the comforts her family can use. Furthermore, Alec insists that Angel will never return and has abandoned her — an idea that Tess has already come to believe herself.\n\nThe RALLY: In the meantime, Angel returns from Brazil to look for Tess and to begin his own farm in England. When Angel finds Tess’ family, Joan informs him that Tess has gone to Sandbourne, a fashionable seaside resort in the south of England. Angel finds Tess there, living as an upper-class lady with Alec d’Urberville. In the meeting with Angel, Tess asks him to leave and not return for her. Angel does leave, resigned that he had judged Tess too harshly and returned too late.\n\nThorough his life, Angel was successfully trying to suppress his impulsive responses and so he overruled all kinds of passions, which the life provides. When he realizes his mistakes and recognizes and truly accepts his sexual passions and desires, it is too late, not only for him, but, more importantly, for Tess.\n\nAngel sees Tess on the village green (May Day) but doesn’t dance with her.\n\nTo become a farmer and not a minister like his father. Angel goes from farm to farm to get practical experience before buying his own farm.\n\nHe was at Talbothays Dairy to learn about dairy farming when he meets Tess.\n\nThey fall in love, and he persuades her to marry him. On their wedding night, Tess tells him about her past.\n\nHe’s perturbed that the real Tess is so unlike from his romanticized, spiritualized version of her.\n\nHe leaves her at her parents’ house and goes to Brazil.\n\nThere, he gets very sick and almost dies, and realizes just how wrong he was about Tess.\n\nHe finally gets back to England, where he receives Tess’s letters begging him to come to her.\n\nHe catches up with her in Sandbourne, where she has already become Alec’s mistress.\n\nShe comes to him and tells him that she’s murdered Alec. They run away together to escape the authorities.\n\nHe manages to hide her for several days, but they’re finally caught at Stonehenge, and Tess is arrested.\n\nHe loiters outside the prison in the Wintoncester with Tess’s younger sister, ‘Liza-Lu, as Tess is killed.\n\nTess takes a promise from him that he will marry her sister Liza Lu after her death.\n\nAlec d’Urberville\n\nAlec is the handsome, amoral son of a wealthy merchant named Simon Stokes. Alec is not really a d’Urberville—his father simply took on the name of the ancient noble family after he built his mansion and retired. He did it so that no one would know that this wealth came from industry. Alec is a manipulative, sinister young man who does everything he can to seduce the innocent Tess when she comes to work for his family. When he gets a chance out in the woods, he subsequently tries to help her but is unable to make her love him.\n\nAlec is a philanderer who takes advantage of Tess and then reappears later in her life trying to marry her although she never loved him. He again deceives him by saying that Angle will never come back to her.\n\nAfter her father’s death Alec ultimately persuades Tess to marry him by giving her family a shelter. But after some time when Tess comes to know that Alec has lied to her and deceived him once again, she stabs him with a carving knife. Alec d’Urbervilles is the typical anti-hero of the novel; his character does not achieve such fine qualities, his facial complexion and behaviour is harmonious with the manners of the typical villain. His appearance of full lips and black moustache, accompanied by the characteristic frizzed points, and his manner of appearing on the scene without the prior warning and always smoking the cigar or riding his dog-cart at a very high speed establishes him as a perfect villain.\n\nSorrow – Tess’s son with Alec d’Urberville. Sorrow dies in his early infancy, after Tess names him herself. Tess cared for the child although it was shameful to her as well.She later buries him herself as well, and decorates his grave\n\nMercy Chant – The daughter of a clergyman.Mr. Clare hopes Angel will marry Mercy, but after Angel marries Tess, Mercy becomes engaged to his brother Cuthbert instead.\n\nMan from Tantridge: A farmer who recognizes Tess as the woman who had a fling with Alec d’Urberville. He says it in front of Angel Clare, and Angel hits him for it.\n\n24.9: Who does really cause Tess’s enormous suffering?\n\nTess is the live indicator of this horrific irony. Why she, who is a victim of rape, has to be hanged? Why such an extraordinary beauty is actually embarrassed of her body? Why she, in spite of being an infinite source of the life, considers her birth as the nightmare, which she will have to sustain. She is both, the dedicated lover and the brutal assassin. What could be counted as the reason of Tess’s turning from a victim to a killer, and from a killer into the victim again?\n\nThroughout the novel, the reader realizes that it is actually the Nature, who abandons Tess. Some kind of the hostility is perceived in both, the social and the natural laws in the novel. The example can be seen in the fact that Alec and Angel do not only ruin Tess, but she is also ruined by the contemporary society. Hardy declares that Tess was condemned from the very beginning by the irrational manmade laws. Tess remains the innocent and immature girl, who is destroyed by the society, but healed and justified by the Nature. The death of Tess is the result of these harsh social laws; the Nature does not allow such measured misuse of the simple girl.\n\nThe relentless oppression of Tess by two social forces( the threshing machine and the hostility of Angel) and Nature(represented by the cruelty of the Sun) is evident. The society is just the one of the constituents of this ‘bullying procedure.’ The policemen have trapped Tess at the sunrise, so she is sacrificed to both, to the Nature and to the Society.\n\n24.11 CONCLUSION : Tess is generally regarded as Hardy’s ‘tragic masterpiece’. It is not just a story of simple seduction of a girl by a man. Hardy presents Tess as a pure woman but not a perfect woman. She is an innocent dairymaid working amidst Nature because in these simple things she finds a substantial pattern of life. Though Tess is the most richly “poetic” of Hardy‟s novels, it offers the genuinely compassionate representation of the working-class figure, Tess Durbeyfield, the milkmaid. Tess can be pigeonholed by three words: virgin, sufferer and victim. Tess could be described as a passive woman; she substitutes the lost of own ‘purity’ by her massive will power.\n\nHardy’s philosophy, imitating Aeschylus or the 19th century science, does not guarantee him to strengthen the inherent development of his plot. There is always a gap between Hardy‟s general statement and its action. Hardy annoyed many contemporary readers of Tess with his overt criticism of religious bigotry and hypocrisy.\n\nThe novel questions society’s sexual customs supported by its compassionate illustration of a female character, who is seduced and raped by the son of her employer. At the end of the novel, Angel is left hand in hand with Tess’s younger sister, ‘a spiritualized image of Tess’. He is distinctly not heroic to be defeated by fate. Tess is hanged, the black flag is raised and Hardy is commenting: “Justice was done, and the President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean phrase, had ended his sport with Tess.”\n\nTess was also Hardy‟s first novel to be filmed, in 1913, by an American production. In fact this novel puts Hardy in the category of feminist writers who raise their voice in contradiction of the violence against women in the society.\n\nyou can view video on Tess by Thomas Hardy\n\nReference"
