        "text": "Press Release\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\n\nWestern Division -- Cincinnati\n\nCase No.: 1:14-cv-38\n\nJudge Susan J. Dlott\n\nCONSENT DECREE\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§12131-12134, and its implementing regulation (\"Title II regulation\"), 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, prohibit public entities, including Miami University (\"Miami\"), from discriminating on the basis of disability, and from excluding qualified individuals with disabilities from participating in, and denying such individuals the benefits of, their services, programs, and activities.\n\nOn January 10, 2014, Aleeha Dudley, who is blind, brought this action against Miami and its former President, Dr. David C. Hodge, alleging, inter alia, that Miami and Dr. Hodge excluded her from participation in and the benefit of Miami's services, programs, and activities, discriminated against her on the basis of disability, and failed to take appropriate steps to ensure equally effective communication with her in violation of Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and both statutes' implementing regulations. (Dkt. No. 1.) Former President Hodge is dismissed from this suit.\n\nOn April 22, 2014, Dudley and the National Federation of the Blind (\"NFB\") filed a motion for leave to file an Amended and Supplemental Complaint. (Dkt. No. 21.)\n\nOn May 12, 2015, the United States moved to intervene in this action. (Dkt. No. 26.) On September 10, 2015, the Court granted the United States' motion to intervene. (Dkt. No. 46.)\n\nThe United States' Complaint alleges, inter alia, that Miami: (1) uses technologies that are inaccessible to qualified individuals with disabilities; and (2) has failed to ensure that qualified individuals with disabilities can access Miami's curricular and co-curricular materials on an equal basis with individuals who do not have disabilities. (Dkt. No. 47.)\n\nMiami denies the foregoing allegations and denies that it violated the ADA, Section 504, or any other law as otherwise asserted by the United States or Dudley. Miami avers that it has been and remains committed to providing equal opportunity for the education of qualified individuals with disabilities, and that it has already undertaken many of the requirements of this Consent Decree (hereinafter \"Consent Decree\" or \"Decree\").\n\nThis Consent Decree resolves all claims alleged in the United States' and Dudley's complaints; it requires Miami to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with an equal opportunity to participate in and benefit from Miami's services, programs, and activities, as Miami increasingly relies on web-based, digital, and emerging technologies. This Consent Decree does not constitute and shall not be deemed to be a finding or determination by the Court, nor an admission by any party, regarding the merits, validity or accuracy of any of the allegations, claims or defenses asserted by the United States, Miami, or Dudley. This Decree represents the compromise of disputed claims in lieu of litigation.\n\nII. DEFINITIONS\n\nTerms in this Decree have the same meaning as defined in the Title II regulation at 28 C.F.R. § 35.104.\n\n\"Equally effective alternate access,\" with respect to electronic and information technology, means an alternative format, medium, or other aid that timely and accurately communicates the same content as does the original format or medium, and which is appropriate to an individual's disability. To provide equally effective alternate access, Miami need not ensure that qualified individuals with disabilities achieve the identical result or level of achievement as individuals without disabilities, but Miami must provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services as necessary to afford individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to obtain the same result, gain the same benefit, or reach the same level of achievement, in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. In providing equally effective alternate access, Miami may rely on any commonly accepted standard or combination of standards, including standards not specifically identified in this Consent Decree, provided the remainder of this definition is met. Miami is not required to take any action that results in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burden, but must nevertheless ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that qualified students with disabilities receive the benefits or services provided by Miami.\n\n\"Fundamental alteration\" means a change to Miami's service, program, or activity that fundamentally alters the nature of the service, program, or activity, which includes academic courses or technology. Where a fundamental alteration can be documented as set forth in this Consent Decree, Miami will take any other action that would not result in such an alteration but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, qualified individuals with disabilities receive the benefits or services provided by Miami.\n\n\"Instructional support application\" means a software application, whether used in a single course, by a department, by a college or by a school, or across Miami (i.e., University-wide), which Miami makes available to students, and which is designed and dedicated to the purpose of collecting or delivering course content or assignments, or assessing student performance. An instructional support application is peripheral to a learning management system and is not necessarily used alongside a learning management system. Instructional support applications are either \"non-standalone,\" because they contain supplementary digital content provided (either directly or through third parties) by the publishers of texts and book-length course materials, or \"standalone,\" because they do not contain such content. Examples of instructional support applications include: Turnitin, LearnSmart, MyStatLab, Vista Higher Learning, Sapling, and WebAssign.\n\nA \"learning management system\" (\"LMS\") means a software application, whether used in a single course, by a department, by a college or by a school, or across Miami (i.e., University-wide), which Miami makes available to students and uses to plan, create, administer, document, track, report, deliver, and maintain electronic educational courses and course content and assess student performance—including by enabling collaboration and communication among members of the class and between the class and instructor; by supporting the assessment of learning outcomes; and by supporting formative and summative feedback to students.\n\n\"Timely\" and \"timeliness\" mean access in sufficient time for the person with the disability to have an equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as persons without disabilities.\n\n\"Undue financial and administrative burdens,\" or \"undue burdens,\" are created when a proposed course of action would result in significant difficulty or expense. Where Miami can demonstrate undue burdens as set forth in this Consent Decree, Miami will take any other action that would not result in such an undue burden but would nevertheless afford, to the maximum extent possible, qualified individuals with disabilities the benefits or services provided by Miami.\n\nIII. AGREED RESOLUTION\n\nThe United States and Miami, and Dudley only as to those provisions of this Decree that apply to former students and to Paragraph 69, infra, agree that it is in their interest, and the United States believes that it is in the public interest, to resolve this lawsuit without further litigation. Accordingly, the United States, Dudley, and Miami agree to the entry of this Consent Decree. Only the United States shall have the power to seek enforcement of this Decree. In exchange for Miami's agreement to enter into this Consent Decree, the United States agrees to terminate its investigation of DJ No. 204-58-229 and agrees that, except as provided in Paragraph 67, infra, it will not institute any other civil action alleging discrimination based on the allegations contained in the complaints filed by the United States and Dudley in the case styled Dudley et al. v. Miami University, et al., Case No. 1:14-cv-38, or based on any other allegation, made by any other person or entity, related to or arising out of the allegations contained in the United States' Complaint and occurring on or before the date of this Consent Decree.\n\nIn resolution of this action, the Parties hereby AGREE and the Court expressly APPROVES, ENTERS, AND ORDERS the following:\n\nIV. TERMS OF AGREEMENT\n\nA. General Non-Discrimination Obligations\n\nMiami will comply with the requirements of Title II, the Title II regulation, and the requirements of this Decree. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134; 28 C.F.R. pt. 35.\n\nMiami must take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with individuals with disabilities are as effective as communications with others. In doing so, Miami is not required to take any action that it can demonstrate (pursuant to the procedures set forth in Paragraph 63, infra) would result in undue financial and administrative burdens or in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity.\n\nMiami must make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless Miami can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\n\nThis Decree addresses Miami's obligations to qualified individuals with disabilities who, during the term of this Decree, are: (a) Miami students, including students enrolled in Miami, students who have been accepted into Miami, and former students of Miami where applicable; and (b) applicants for admission to Miami, including individuals who have applied for admission to Miami and, where specifically indicated in this Decree, prospective applicants (i.e., individuals who seek to apply for admission to Miami).\n\nB. Web Content Accessibility\n\nWithin six (6) months of the entry of this Consent Decree Miami will:\n\nSubject to Paragraph 22, infra, provide in conformance with the World Wide Web Consortium's (\"W3C\") Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (\"WCAG\") 2.0 AA all new (i.e., non-existent until on or after entry of this Consent Decree) and redeveloped (i.e., existing before entry of this Consent Decree but substantially changed in terms of functionality or structure) web pages, web applications, and web content, created by Miami, on websites and subdomains used for Miami's academic divisions, academic departments, and administrative offices (listed at Exhibit A).\n\nFor websites and subdomains used for Miami's academic divisions, academic departments, and administrative offices (see Exhibit A), provide the United States with Miami's plan to make pre-existing (i.e., existing before the entry of this Consent Decree) web pages, web applications, and web content, created by Miami, and published by Miami on or after January 2012 but not subject to Subsection (a) above, comply with WCAG 2.0 AA. Within eighteen (18) months of the entry of this Decree, Miami shall make all such web pages, web applications, and web content comply with WCAG 2.0 AA, subject to the requirements of Paragraph 22, infra.\n\nIf specifically requested by a qualified student with a disability, modify legacy pages (i.e., pages published prior to January 2012) and archive content (i.e., content no longer in use but subject to records retention schedules) to conform to WCAG 2.0 AA, provided that Miami may provide equally effective alternate access of legacy and archive content until conformance is accomplished.\n\nWith respect to third-party content, websites, or applications that Miami uses for completion of critical or important transactions (e.g., websites used for campus housing, campus dining, registering for classes, paying bills, obtaining transcripts) or to complete required training (e.g., AlcoholEDU), either:\n\nCause such third-party content, websites, or applications to conform with WCAG 2.0 AA and this Decree; or\n\nProvide equally effective alternate access to qualified individuals with disabilities until such time that conformance can be achieved pursuant to Miami's Accessibility Audit Corrective Action Plan (see infra Section N, \"Accessible Technology Specialist, Audit, Evaluation, and Corrective Action Plan\").\n\nFor the benefit of prospective applicants to Miami, make any web content relating to applications for admission or financial aid (e.g., application instructions, the applications themselves) that Miami posts to its web pages or web applications conform to WCAG 2.0 AA. To the extent Miami uses third-party websites or web applications for such web content, Miami will either: (1) cause such third-party content, websites, or applications to conform with WCAG 2.0 AA and this Decree; or (2) provide equally effective alternate access to qualified individuals with disabilities until such time that conformance can be achieved pursuant to Miami's Accessibility Audit Corrective Action Plan (see infra Section N, \"Accessible Technology Specialist, Audit, Evaluation, and Corrective Action Plan\").\n\nOn the Accessible Educational Resources Portal described in Section K, infra, provide a method by which visitors to Miami's websites can submit feedback (e.g., an accessible form, e-mail address, phone number) on how accessibility can be improved. The feedback will be regularly monitored by Miami.\n\nThe following requirements apply to those Miami websites and subdomains, and web applications, subject to Paragraph 21(a) or (b), supra:\n\nVideos. All videos embedded within the home page of each academic division and Vice-Presidential office, and all videos relating to the completion of critical or important transactions (e.g., registering for classes, paying bills, obtaining transcripts) must comply with WCAG 2.0 AA. All other videos shall be remediated in accordance with Section F, \"Inaccessible Digital File Conversion Submission Page,\" infra.\n\nElectronic Documents. Individual Miami offices, divisions, and departments may submit requests to Miami's Accessible Technology Coordinator (see infra Section H) to seek exceptions to the requirement that electronic documents posted to their websites and subdomains, or within their web applications, conform with WCAG 2.0 AA. Miami shall grant exceptions only for electronic documents meeting all of the following requirements: (1) the documents are of interest to a specific and limited audience (e.g., researchers in a particular academic discipline); (2) the set of documents requiring remediation to conform with WCAG 2.0 AA is voluminous (i.e., the total page count of the electronic documents that reside on a single web page exceeds 100 pages), or is—from a technical perspective—exceptionally difficult to remediate; and (3) the documents are presented in such a way that individuals with disabilities are able to identify documents of particular interest and request remediation of those documents in accordance with Section F, \"Inaccessible Digital File Conversion Submission Page,\" infra. The Accessible Technology Coordinator will include in his or her quarterly reports (see Paragraph 39(d), infra) a detailed description (e.g., a description of the nature of the excepted documents and the precise number of documents at issue), together with supporting documentation (e.g., screen captures from relevant web pages), of the reasons why Miami granted each requested exception during the relevant reporting period.\n\nTo the extent web content or web applications exist that are not covered under Paragraph 21(a) and (b), supra, an individual may request access to such web content or web applications in accordance with Section F, \"Inaccessible Digital File Conversion Submission Page,\" infra.\n\nWithin two (2) months of the entry of this Decree, Miami will designate a Web Accessibility Coordinator (in Information Technology Services (\"IT Services\") for Miami's web content) who will report to the Vice President for Information Technology. The Web Accessibility Coordinator will be knowledgeable concerning:\n\n1) Accessibility and usability of web content;\n\n2) Accessible document development and remediation;\n\n3) Accessibility and usability of digital equipment, including assistive technologies;\n\n4) Testing and evaluation of the accessibility of web and other technologies;\n\n5) This Decree;\n\n6) Standards published by the W3C, such as WCAG 2.0; and\n\n7) Publishing standards for accessible electronic books and documents, such as the DAISY Consortium's Digital Accessible Information System (\"DAISY\") Standard and the International Digital Publishing Forum's (\"IDPF\") EPUB3 specification.\n\nC. Learning Management System and Instructional Support Application Accessibility\n\nPrior to the conclusion of the 2016-2017 academic year, Miami will make its University-wide LMSs, which Miami presently expects to migrate to the Canvas LMS, conform with WCAG 2.0 AA. Beginning three (3) months from the entry of this Decree, and until such time as Miami's University-wide LMS(s) conform with WCAG 2.0 AA, Miami will, upon request by a student with a disability: (a) modify specific pages on its existing University-wide LMS, Niikha, to conform with WCAG 2.0 AA; or (b) provide the requesting student with equally effective alternate access to the information contained in the Niikha pages at issue. Course materials provided on Miami's University-wide LMSs are subject to Section D, \"Textbook and Course Material Accessibility,\" infra.\n\nAll other LMSs and all instructional support applications in use by Miami during the term of this Decree will be subject to the Accessible Technology Audit and Evaluation procedures described in Section N, \"Accessible Technology Specialist, Audit, Evaluation, and Corrective Action Plan,\" infra.\n\nFor the term of this Decree, in purchasing or acquiring any new LMS, or any standalone instructional support application, Miami will:\n\nEvaluate any available product accessibility information, such as a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (\"VPAT\"), third-party product accessibility evaluations, publicly-available accessibility evaluations, and automated testing reports. Miami's IT Services staff will obtain log-in credentials from the vendor to independently test the LMS or instructional support application through automated, expert, and user testing—using in-house staff or third-party consultants—and will assess the claims of the VPAT and any available accessibility evaluation to determine the product's conformance with WCAG 2.0 AA and its ability to be used by students with disabilities; and\n\nMeet the requirements set forth in Section L, \"Technology Procurement,\" infra.\n\nD. Textbook and Course Material Accessibility\n\nMiami will provide students with disabilities equally effective communication of curricular materials (e.g., textbooks, workbooks, articles, compilations, presentations, collaborative assignments, videos, and images or graphical materials) converted to alternate formats, provided that such student registers with Student Disability Services, requests accommodations, and participates in dialogue with Student Disability Services in identifying what will be equally effective communication.\n\nIn selecting texts and book-length course materials, including any supplementary digital applications or content provided by the publishers of such texts and book-length course materials, Miami will consider the availability of materials in accessible electronic formats, such as EPUB3, DAISY, WCAG 2.0 AA, the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (\"WAI-ARIA\") 1.0, the W3C's Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (\"ATAG\") 2.0, the W3C's Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (\"WCAG2ICT\"), the W3C's Mathematical Markup Language (\"MathML\") 3.0, the Braille Authority of North America's (\"BANA\") Guidelines and Standards for Tactile Graphics (2010), the BANA Guidelines for the Production of Braille Materials through the Use of Braille Production Software (2007), and any successors to these standards that become effective during the term of this Decree. Any supplementary digital applications or content, such as non-standalone instructional support applications, provided by the publishers of texts and book-length course materials, shall not be subject to Section C, \"Learning Management System and Instructional Support Application Accessibility,\" supra, or Section L, \"Technology Procurement,\" infra.\n\nIf any student registers with Miami's Student Disability Services and identifies as having a vision or hearing disability for which modifications, auxiliary aids or services, or assistive technologies are appropriate and necessary to access his or her curricular programming, Miami will consult with that student before the beginning of each semester to determine whether the student will require curricular materials in alternate formats, what assistive technologies the student uses or needs, and what formats will work with the student's assistive technologies.\n\nIf any student who is not subject to Subsection (b) above has registered with Miami's Student Disability Services and identifies as having a disability for which assistive technologies or the provision of curricular materials in alternate formats is necessary, Miami will consult with the student before the beginning of each semester to determine what alternate formats the student will require for his or her curricular materials, what assistive technologies the student uses or needs, and what formats will work with the student's assistive technologies. When the student registers with Miami's Student Disability Services, Student Disability Services will notify the student that he or she may request the consultations set forth in Paragraph 28(d), infra.\n\nTogether with each instructor in each course in which the student is registered, Miami's Student Disability Services will, no later than two (2) weeks before the beginning of each course, consult with each student identified pursuant to Paragraph 28(b), supra, and each student who, pursuant to Paragraph 28(c), supra, requests the consultations set forth herein, to:\n\nReview and discuss the course syllabus and other available information concerning the formats in which course content will be presented;\n\nIdentify all materials, including multimedia, that will be provided to or used by students, as well as which materials will need to be converted each week of the semester, to the extent the information is set forth in the course syllabus or is otherwise available;\n\nTo the extent the information is set forth in the course syllabus or is otherwise available, identify if any equipment will be used in the classroom (e.g., laboratory equipment) that may present an accessibility barrier to a student, and: (a) identify the accessible equipment that the student will need and how Miami will provide it; or (b) if appropriate, how Miami will provide the student with equally effective alternate access;\n\nDetermine in what format the student prefers textual and graphical material for effective communication, including electronic format, hard copy Braille, described images, tactile images, etc.;\n\nConfirm from the student that the format will be usable by the student's assistive technology, if applicable, or if appropriate, how equally effective alternate access will be provided; and\n\nDevelop and memorialize in writing, an individualized plan—a copy of which will be provided to the student and instructor (e.g., in an accommodation letter)—that will set forth what accessible course materials, equipment, and other accommodations Miami will provide to the student.\n\nAt the time a student identified pursuant to Paragraph 28(b) or (c), supra, registers with Miami's Student Disability Services, Miami shall advise the student in writing that he or she should notify Miami's Student Disability Services promptly if the student registers late for a course or transfers into a course after the course has begun. No later than two (2) weeks after receiving such notification, Miami's Student Disability Services will consult with the student and each instructor in the courses for which the student registered or transferred late. The requirements of Paragraph 28(d)(1) through (d)(6), supra, will apply to each such consultation.\n\nMiami will provide timely access to converted curricular material. If circumstances such as late registration, mid-semester transfers, the medium chosen, or the volume and complexity of the material will delay conversion, Miami will work with the impacted students to ensure equally effective alternate access to course materials in the interim.\n\nOnce a month during each semester, Student Disability Services will communicate with each student subject to Paragraph 28(b) or (c), supra, to determine whether the student is receiving the necessary and requested accommodation. If the student responds that he or she has not received the necessary and requested accommodation, then Student Disability Services shall schedule an in-person meeting with the student—which will take place within three (3) business days of the student's response—to determine what further steps are necessary to provide the necessary and requested accommodation.\n\nTwice a semester—first, a quarter of the way through the semester, and then three quarters of the way through the semester—Student Disability Services will communicate with each instructor for each course in which a student subject to Paragraph 28(b) or (c), supra, is enrolled to remind the instructor about: (1) each student's individualized disability accommodation plan, and (2) the instructor's responsibility to provide each student with timely access to converted curricular materials—including for materials that the instructor did not list on the course syllabus but which he or she later chooses to circulate or add to the curriculum after the course has begun.\n\nIf Miami procures web technology or software pursuant to Paragraph 50(e), infra, Miami shall not use the web technology or software in any course section in which a student with a disability enrolls, if the student's disability impairs his or her ability to use the inaccessible web technology or software and Miami cannot implement equally effective alternate access in a timely manner.\n\nWithin three (3) months of the entry of this Decree, Miami will submit for the United States' approval procedures for providing students with disabilities with timely access to accessible textbooks and course materials (e.g., digital, hard copy Braille, tactile graphics, captioned multimedia, etc.) in a manner consistent with this Decree.\n\nWithin three (3) months of the beginning of the fall 2016 semester, Miami will train its personnel who are responsible for converting, or coordinating the third-party conversion of, textbooks, workbooks, and course materials for students with disabilities about:\n\nMethods of making accessible PDFs, word processing documents, and presentations, and methods of remediating inaccessible PDFs, word processing documents, and presentations, including the addition or remediation of headings, alternative text, and accessibility of material provided in links and multimedia;\n\nProofreading and remediating scanned text submitted to optical character recognition;\n\nCaptioning and audio describing multimedia;\n\nProviding images in tactile formats; and\n\nProcedures for converting materials into Braille that would be appropriate and effective for individual students, including the standards set forth in the BANA Guidelines and Standards for Tactile Graphics (2010) and Guidelines for the Production of Braille Materials through the Use of Braille Production Software (2007).\n\nE. Student Organization Website Accessibility\n\nWithin six (6) months of the entry of this Decree, Miami will:\n\nCause any websites, web pages, and web applications (e.g., \"The Hub,\" https://muhub.collegiatelink.net/) that it provides for use by student organizations that have registered with Miami to: (1) conform with WCAG 2.0 AA, and (2) not block or interfere with any accessibility features in content uploaded by students and other individuals who may upload content to such websites, web pages, and web applications (\"Content Providers\").\n\nCause the content management systems that Miami uses for such websites, web pages, and web applications to employ templates with fields designed to assist Content Providers with producing and uploading WCAG 2.0 AA-conforming content (e.g., fields prompting Content Providers to insert text alternatives (\"alt text\") for images).\n\nDevelop a guide for Content Providers entitled \"How to Make Web Content Accessible.\" This guide will: (1) describe steps for making content that is uploaded to the content management systems referenced in Paragraph 31(b), supra, conform with WCAG 2.0 AA, and (2) list resources for producing accessible content.\n\nPost a copy of the guide to each of the content management systems referenced in Paragraph 31(b), supra.\n\nDistribute to each Content Provider a copy of the guide, upon the Content Provider's registration with any of the websites, web pages, or web applications that Miami makes available for use by student organizations that have registered with Miami.\n\nF. Inaccessible Digital File Conversion Submission Page\n\nWithin three (3) months of the entry of this Decree, Miami will create a WCAG 2.0 AA-conforming web page that contains instructions to permit:\n\nQualified individuals with disabilities who are students, staff, or applicants for admission to Miami to submit or upload for Miami's remediation inaccessible documents, images, and multimedia that have been: (1) created by Miami and published on its websites; or (2) sent to or received at a Miami email address, or that have been posted to a Miami website (such as the Hub), by Miami students or staff in connection with curricular activities, student government, major student publications (Miami Student, Miami Quarterly, and UP Magazine), student organizations that have registered with Miami, residential life activities (e.g., dorm movie nights) sponsored or organized by Miami's Residence Hall Association, student participation in or attendance at campus theatrical and musical performances, student participation in or attendance at campus art shows, or student participation in or attendance at recreational events and activities (e.g., intramural sports).\n\nQualified individuals with disabilities who are former students of Miami to submit or upload for Miami's remediation inaccessible files (e.g., documents, images, and multimedia) on websites that Miami directs former students to use for completion of critical or important functions (e.g., websites used for obtaining transcripts).\n\nTrained, knowledgeable Miami staff will regularly monitor the submissions and uploads, and, exercising due diligence, will promptly remediate and convert into accessible format any such submitted files.\n\nWithin three (3) business days of an individual's submission or upload, Miami will transmit to the submitting individual a remediated version of the inaccessible file, unless such factors as the complexity or length of the file, the volume of requests, or the need to prioritize academically-related remediation requests necessitates additional time or the individual indicates that the need for conversion into accessible format is not urgent—in which case, Miami will advise the individual of the steps it will take to remediate the file, as well as the time frame it anticipates it will need to complete the remediation.\n\nThe requirement that Miami remediate inaccessible videos does not extend to: (1) videos posted by students in connection with the Miami Student or with student organizations that have registered with Miami; or (2) links that Miami students circulate—in connection with non-curricular activities—of videos posted to non-Miami websites.\n\nWith respect to the requirement that Miami remediate, upon request, inaccessible files circulated in connection with student government, major student publications, and registered student organizations (see Paragraph 32(a), supra), Miami may contact the United States two academic semesters after the entry of this Decree to request modification or removal of this requirement. The United States will modify or remove this requirement upon a showing by Miami that the volume of requests for remediation of such files is unreasonably difficult or costly for Miami.\n\nG. Accessible Technology Policy\n\nWithin three (3) months of the entry of this Decree, Miami will submit for the United States' approval an Accessible Technology Policy consistent with this Decree. The Accessible Technology Policy will provide for equal opportunity for qualified individuals with disabilities to participate in and benefit from Miami's services, programs, and activities.

Technology Procurement\n\nWithin three (3) months of the entry of this Decree and for its term, Miami will take the following steps in its procurement process for any software or web technology, including LMSs and standalone instructional support applications, that Miami procures for use by students:\n\nWeb technology or software that Miami procures for use by its students will conform to the relevant standards of Paragraph 50(d)(1), infra, if the technology is commercially available and its purchase does not result in undue financial and administrative burdens or a fundamental alteration.\n\nIf a product is available and meets some, but not all, of the relevant standards of Paragraph 50(d)(1), infra, Miami must procure the product that best meets the standard, unless its purchase would result in undue financial and administrative burdens or a fundamental alteration, or unless an exception applies pursuant to Miami's technology procurement policy (see Paragraph 50(e), infra). In determining which product best meets the relevant accessibility standards, Miami may take into account a contractual commitment from the vendor to make any non-conforming web technology or software conform or best conform to such standards before Miami makes the product available for use by students. After the vendor represents that it has updated the product to conform or best conform to the relevant accessibility standards, Miami shall independently test the product through automated, expert, and user testing, and verify that the product meets the vendor's representations. Miami shall not use the product until the vendor satisfies its commitment to make the product conform or best conform to the relevant accessibility standards.\n\nMiami will request, obtain, review, and evaluate each vendor's most recent accessibility testing results, if available, for such products purchased through Miami's Office of Purchasing.\n\nAny Request for Proposal (\"RFP\") by Miami will include the following requirements:\n\nThe vendor must specify whether web content and software conform to the following standards (or, if applicable, the successors to those standards, should any become effective during the term of this Decree):\n\nThe W3C's WCAG 2.0 AA and WAI-ARIA 1.0 for RFPs seeking web content;\n\nThe W3C's ATAG 2.0 for RFPs seeking web authoring tools;\n\nThe W3C's UAAG 1.0 for RFPs seeking web browsers, media players, and assistive technologies;\n\nThe W3C's WCAG2ICT or Section 508-1194.21, 36 C.F.R. § 1194.21, for RFPs seeking non-web software and content;\n\nThe W3C's MathML 3.0 specification for RFPs seeking products incorporating digital mathematical and scientific notation;\n\nThe DAISY Standard or the IDPF's EPUB 3 specification for RFPs seeking digital publications and documents; and\n\nThe BANA Guidelines and Standards for Tactile Graphics (2010) and Guidelines for the Production of Braille Materials through the Use of Braille Production Software (2007) for hard copy Braille.\n\nThe vendor must either:\n\nAgree to make non-conforming web content and software conform to relevant standards identified in Paragraph 50(d)(1), supra; or\n\nDetail how the vendor will support Miami in providing equally effective alternate access for non-conforming web content and software.\n\nWithin one (1) month of the entry of this Decree, Miami will develop for approval by the United States a technology procurement policy to address technology procurement situations that may warrant expedited consideration for an exception to the requirements of Paragraphs 50(a) or (b), supra.

If, in the process of implementing the requirements of Paragraph 62, Miami concludes that it cannot complete one or more of these requirements within the time frame set forth herein, Miami will contact the United States to proceed pursuant to Paragraph 71, infra.\n\nQ. Undue Burden and Fundamental Alteration Determinations\n\nFor any technology-related requirement in this Decree for which the University asserts undue burden or fundamental alteration, such assertion may only be made by: (a) the President of Miami or (b) an individual designated by the President and who has budgetary authority after considering all resources available for use in the funding and operation of the service, program, or activity. Any such assertion of undue burden or fundamental alteration must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion, including Miami's available funding and other resources, and the cost of meeting the requirement, where relevant. The written statement will be certified by the determining official (President or designated official with budgetary authority). If such a determination is made, Miami will take, and will specify in the written statement, any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that qualified individuals with disabilities receive the benefits or services provided by Miami.\n\nR. Personal Devices and Services\n\nPursuant to Title II and its implementing regulation, Miami is not required to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with personal devices, such as wheelchairs; individually prescribed devices, such as prescription eyeglasses or hearing aids; or services of a personal nature, such as assistance in eating, toileting, or dressing.\n\nV.

Each report will identify and provide, if applicable, the written statements supporting any determination of undue burden or fundamental alteration, and how Miami provided equally effective alternate access.\n\nIf the United States believes that this Consent Decree or any portion of it has been violated, the United States will give notice (including reasonable particulars) of the violations to Miami. Miami must respond to this notice as soon as practicable but no later than thirty (30) days thereafter. The United States and Miami will negotiate in good faith in an attempt to resolve any dispute. If the United States and Miami are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution within sixty (60) days of Miami's response, the United States may seek court enforcement of this Decree.\n\nThis Consent Decree is effective as of its entry and will remain in effect for four (4) years.\n\nDudley and Miami agree that Dudley's efforts in the pursuit of her education have brought to the forefront issues relating to accessibility of technology and other programs for individuals with disabilities, and have served integral roles in the development of this Decree and to Miami's efforts to pursue the implementation of software and programs to provide better accessibility for individuals with disabilities, as well as the hiring of additional qualified individuals to oversee the implementation of policies and procedures regarding the accessibility of technology and other aspects of the services Miami provides to its students. Miami and Dudley have entered into an additional agreement, subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the Court until fulfilled, and to which the United States is not a party, that governs the payment of money to Ms. Dudley, other relief applicable to Dudley, and the release of Dudley's claims against Miami and Dr. Hodge.\n\nExcept as addressed in additional terms of the agreement between Miami and Dudley pursuant to Paragraph 69, supra, this Consent Decree contains the entire agreement of the Parties concerning the subject matter described in the Complaints filed in this action and in Part I, \"Introduction,\" supra, and no other statement, promise, or agreement, either written or oral, made by any party or agent of any party, that is not contained in this Consent Decree will be enforceable.\n\nAny modification of this Consent Decree requires the written consent of the United States and the approval of the Court; provided that, the United States and Miami may agree in writing to extend the applicable deadlines specified in this Consent Decree, other than its termination. The United States will not unreasonably deny requested extensions, if made by Miami in advance of any deadline, and following Miami's due diligence to meet such a requirement.\n\nThis Consent Decree will be binding on Miami and its respective subsidiaries, agents, employees, officers, contractors, and successors.\n\nFailure by the United States to enforce this Decree, or any part of it, pursuant to its terms with respect to any instance or provision, will not be construed as a waiver to enforce the Decree with regard to any instances or provisions.\n\nThe Parties agree that, as of the entry of this Consent Decree, litigation is not \"reasonably foreseeable\" concerning the matters described in the Complaints filed in this action.
