        "text": "The Henry Ford's Greenfield Village is set to reopen to the public on April 13, with an exclusive members-only preview on April 12.\n\nBut the village of innovation is not without transformations of its own. This 2024 season, visitors can expect a few changes, additions and reintroductions to Dearborn's beloved outdoor museum of industry.\n\nHere's what to know about what's new and different at Greenfield Village this year:\n\nThings to do\n\nFor the first time since 2019, visitors will be able to enter the Detroit, Toledo & Milwaukee Roundhouse in the Railroad Junction District, where workers performed maintenance on steam locomotives for the Detroit, Toledo and Milwaukee Railroad; Dr. Howard's Office in the Main Street District, where Alonson Howard practiced medicine around the time of the Civil War; and Grimm Jewelry Store in the Main Street District, where Englebert Grimm sold and repaired watches, clocks and jewelry on Michigan Avenue in Detroit from 1886 until 1931.\n\nDown in the Porches and Parlors District, some areas will be closed off to prepare for the arrival of the Jackson House, where Martin Luther King Jr. planned the Selma-to-Montgomery marches in 1965, expected to settle in on Maple Lane between the George Washington Carver Memorial and the William Holmes McGuffey Birthplace in 2026.\n\nMore: Jackson House, historic civil rights home, travels to Michigan (freep.com)\n\nThe McGuffey Birthplace, however, will be moved closer to the McGuffey School to make room for the Jackson House, causing the McGuffey Birthplace to remain closed and inaccessible throughout the summer 2024 season.\n\nThe village will also be unveiling a new restaurant on May 1: Stand 44, located next to the Detroit Central Market in the Main Street District and named after a stall where Mary Judge sold her items from 1863 to 1894. According to a release, Stand 44 will have a new focus on sustainability, from acquiring fresh ingredients from local sources to being the first facility in Greenfield Village to compost all its own waste.\n\nLastly, the village will welcome back the refreshed and renovated Greenfield Village Store, where guests can shop the extensive quilting collection, Detroit Central Market apparel and products featuring artwork by nationally recognized illustrator and graphic designer Humberto Cruz.\n\nExhibitions\n\nIn late spring, the \"Dick Gutman: DINERMAN\" exhibit will open in the new Collections Gallery. In the gallery next to General Motors, the \"Dinosaurs in Motion\" exhibit will open June 9.\n\nA third exhibit will be announced later in the season to open in October.\n\nMore: I learned how to drive a Model T at Greenfield Village (freep.com)\n\nPrices\n\nA little less exciting, some membership levels will undergo a price increase with the reopening of the village on April 13. Student, individual and visionary membership plans will remain the same, but other levels will be increasing as follows:\n\nCompanion membership plans will have a $10 increase.\n\nCompanion Flex membership plans will have a $20 increase.\n\nFamily membership plans will have a $15 increase.\n\nFamily Flex membership plans will have a $20 increase.\n\nInnovator membership plans will have a $25 increase.\n\nCurrent members can renew their memberships before April 13 to renew at their current rate.\n\nHours\n\nBetween April 13 and May 20, Greenfield Village will be open to the public Tuesday through Sunday, but starting May 21, the village will expand operations to seven days a week.\n\nOn operating days, the village will be open from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m."
