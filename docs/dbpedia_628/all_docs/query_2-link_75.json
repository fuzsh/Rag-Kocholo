        "text": "Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Email\n\nFor a show about nothing, it sure was something. The NBC sitcom Seinfeld charmed viewers for 180 episodes throughout nine seasons from 1989 to 1998 by leaning into the banal realities of the everyday. During its run, Seinfeld averaged a staggering 30 million viewers each week, with more than 76 million people tuning into the finale.\n\nThe brainchild of comedian Jerry Seinfeld and writer-producer Larry David, the original idea was to create a 90-minute special meant to air in Saturday Night Live’s time slot. But as the two got to work, they realized that was a long time to sustain their idea about a show about a comedian, so it turned into a half-hour sitcom.\n\n“​​The pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was we want to show how a comedian gets his material,” Seinfeld said in a Reddit AMA in 2014. “The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it’s the opposite of that.”\n\nHowever it’s described, much of the lovability of the show rests in its strong characters — Seinfeld playing a fictionalized version of himself, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as his sarcastic ex Elaine Benes, Jason Alexander as his insecure best friend George Castanza, and Michael Richards as his oddball neighbor Cosmo Kramer.\n\nHere, we look back at 10 facts about the groundbreaking sitcom.\n\nElaine Wasn’t in the Pilot Episode\n\nThe first episode was missing a significant part of the famous foursome: Elaine. However, there was another female character: a waitress named Claire who worked at the diner where Jerry and George would hang out.\n\nEven with Claire in the pilot, it’s widely reported that Elaine came to be because the first episode was “too male-centric.” While Rosie O’Donnell, Patricia Heaton, and Megan Mullaley were all considered for the part, it was Louis-Dreyfus’ close ties to David during their joint time at Saturday Night Live that led to the gig. When David came to her with the Seinfeld character, Louis-Dreyfus was “immediately intrigued” by the writing. “It was unlike anything on television at the time,” she said.\n\nKramer’s Name Was Originally “Kessler”\n\nIn season four, during the whole show-within-a-show plot, there’s a storyline in which Kramer will only let himself be depicted if he can play himself. As it turns out, that was based on a real situation that Seinfeld dealt with at the start of the show.\n\nThe comedian had based the wacky character of his real neighbor Kenny Kramer, who would only let him use his name if he could play himself. So in the pilot episode, Richards’ character is referred to as “Kessler.” After it was worked out — and the real Kramer was paid $1,000 — the name was switched.\n\nThe Theme Song for Each Episode Is Different\n\nFor the first seven seasons, every episode started with Seinfield doing a stand-up routine. But what only eagle-eared listeners will notice is that the theme song was made to match those monologues, which means every single episode had a slightly different one. Composer Jonathan Wolff used instruments like the bass — plus his fingers and mouth to improvise the sounds — and synced them to Seinfeld’s stand-up timing to build a simple melody that could easily start and stop for jokes.\n\n“I have no idea how many themes we did for Seinfeld…” he told Great Big Story. “The timing, the length, had to be adjustable in a way it would still hold water and still sound like the Seinfeld theme.”\n\nJerry Stiller Wasn’t Always George’s Dad\n\nSo much of George’s character is enveloped by his parents, played by Estelle Harris and Jerry Stiller, but Stiller wasn’t the elder Constanza from the start. In the first appearance of the character in season four, he was played by veteran TV, film and theater actor John Randolph. While Alexander says he adored Randolph, he thought that “John actually looked more like my grandfather than my father.”\n\nAfter one episode, they moved on to a second actor who “wasn’t noteworthy” before Stiller officially came along in season five. “He’s my favorite character on the show,” Alexander said. “He doesn’t even know how good he is.” He added that Stiller often had trouble remembering his lines, but that worked out for the best. “The lines would come back to him in little stutter steps, so they would come out in little stutter steps — what you were seeing was his own growing anxiety and frustration with his own memory that got translated into the disdain for the world that Frank Constanza had.”\n\nThe Soup Nazi May Not Have Been a “Seinfeld” Fan\n\nWith everyday life so often inspiring the storylines, one of the most famous was the Soup Nazi who insisted his customers order in a very particular way or else “no soup for you!” Spike Feresten, who wrote the episode, had often visited Al Yeganeh’s soup shop, now called The Original Soupman, on 55th Street in New York City and experienced the stern service himself.\n\n“He was kind of a mean guy, but on that day he said, ‘No soup for you!’” Feresten said. “I was so bewildered, like, ‘What? I don’t understand, I’ve got money, you’re selling stuff.’” It made for perfect comedy fodder.\n\nBut Yeganeh was not a fan of the depiction, telling CNN the use of the word was a “disgrace to the human race.” That said, he eventually used the sitcom’s success to draw visitors to his restaurant, even including its hashtag in the store’s Instagram bio.\n\nThe Four Stars Made the Decision to End the Show\n\nThe show’s mark on pop culture remained strong throughout its run, but it was the cast who knew it was time to wrap things up. Seinfeld called his three costars into his dressing room during season nine and they just looked at one another and knew.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of good fortune here. Maybe we shouldn’t push our luck too far,” he said. “And we all agreed that this was the right moment. And I remember it’s the only time we all got together in a dressing room, the four of us, to make that decision. That was powerful.”\n\nIt’s a decision Seinfeld doesn’t regret, recalling when a cab driver once asked him why they ended on top. “I said to him, well, I was at a point we had done it for nine years and I realized I could go off the air right now and the show could be a legend,” he said. “I could be a legend of the sitcom world or I could make some more money.” And that’s why the show remains a legend."
