It includes key educational events, people, and forces that shaped and continue to shape American education.\n\nKey factors shaping education:\n\nResources available in different combinations provided by educators, families, communities, states, and national government.\n\nCheck the financial support of education in your state!\n\nEducation as compulsory\n\nEducation as a standardized curriculum\n\nTeachers as professionals\n\nLaws, courts and their rulings related to education\n\nEducational Law basics:\n\nPublic schools has served as the single most significant site of the constitutional interpretation within the nation's history. Justin Driver\n\nTo better understand public education in the United states today, one must consider the judicial systems in shaping schooling across the country by initiating, stalling, and rejecting change.\n\nThe judiciary does not operate on laws within a vacuum. It is embedded in American culture, which influences and shapes its legal decisions. Therefore, both law and culture must be considered when reviewing judicial decisions.\n\nCitizens who seek legal recourse often use the constitution to support their arguements. Arguements for and against: mandatory education, freedom of speech in and out of school (speech restriction, censorship), segregation, integration, â¦\n\nCommon strategies used related to the constitution include:\n\nThe constitution doesnât mention education, therefore, the supreme court should reject or not rule. Counter arguments include rationale such as: the constitutions also does not mention the Air Force, but it does allow it to be authorized.)\n\nPublic schools are local government responsibilities. Therefore, federal government should not interfer. Counter arguments often refer to 14th amendment violation.\n\nLocal boards have greater pedagogical knowledge than the judiciary to monitor and make decisions. Counter arguments often refer to 14th amendment violation.\n\nDe facto (something that has become a standard practice over time (fact) by a dominant group of people. Not necessarily based on law, logic, fact, or ethics). Counter arguments attempt to present errors caused by standard practice or past reasoning.\n\nDe jure (something that exists in practice in law written law on paper) as applied to integration and segregation since Brown v. Board. Counter arguments attempt to present errors caused by standard practice or past reasoning.\n\nTimeline - today\n\n2023 - Campaigns to undermine public schools continue\n\nState of community and public school relationships\n\nAbout one thousand suburban superintendents are surveyed about their communities and schools relationship.\n\nTheir concerns include:\n\nContentious school board elections.\n\nThe platform or agenda of at least one school board candidate.\n\nIncreasing contentious school board meetings.\n\nAttendance at school board meetings has increased noticeably.\n\nA substantial increase in the number of Freedom of Information Act requests for their district to process.\n\nThey have felt or been threatened and are aware of at least one school board member who has felt or been threatened.\n\nThe spread of inaccurate information related to their schools and/or decision-making processes.\n\nPotential lack of support for their decisions from parts of the community.\n\nBeing misunderstood and misrepresented.\n\nThe negative affect of current school community relationships on the mental health and physical well-being of their administrators, faculty, and staff.\n\nSource Kappan February 2023\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, implores Congress to\n\ndismantle the higher education accreditation cartel by creating alternative - and potentially unaccountable - avenues for financial aid eligibility.\n\nAttacks on accreditation agencies, are designed to destroy academic freedom, college and university autonomy, to serious damage American higher education which provide innovation, excellence, social mobility, and break down barriers to help millions of people achieve their dreams.\n\nCensorship attacks on higher education escalate\n\nLegislative attacks on college and university free speech increase as legislators in state governments introduce hundreds of bills with educational gag orders focused on higher education and dozens of other bills with higher education censorious restrictions, aimed to destroy the integrity and autonomy of educational institutions in favor of state dictates on what content and curricula are appropriate in schools.\n\n2022\n\nGuns become the number one killer of kids and teens in the United States, more than drugs or cancer.\n\nIn Carson v. Makin the U.S. Supreme court rules:\n\nif a state offers tuition assistance for students to attend private school, then requiring them to be nonsectarian violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Thus allowing tuition payments to religious schools.\n\nThis ruling probably makes any state law or policy that bars religious schools from participating on an equal footing with nonreligious schools in state assistance (vouchers, tuition, charters â¦) illegal.\n\nThis court seems to rule that any state policy that bars religious schools from participating on an equal footing with nonreligious schools for state tuition, vouchers, or any other program, will be sruck down. This raises questions:\n\nIf the state denies participation, then\n\nIs the state protecting against government establishment of religion? Or\n\nIs the state engaging in anti-religious discrimination?\n\nJustic Stephen Breyer writes: How will the court reconcile their currrent belief that states who subsidize private nonsectarian schools must also subsidize private religious schools?\n\nIf the first amendment protects religious entities from having to comply with antidiscimination laws, that conflict with their religion, then how do states, who don't want to support discrimination or religous indoctrination do so?\n\nThe answer may be to eliminate all state funding to all private school programs.\n\nThe second issue. If a person or entity is allowed to discriminate based on religious beliefs, then much discrimination is permissible? Refusing to bake a cake is one thing, but what about life saving medical procedures?\n\nEducation at the start of 2022\n\nParents report:\n\n68% worry about politicians making decisions about curriculum\n\n65% worry about childâs happiness and emotional well being\n\n63% worry about Child experiencing stress or anxiety\n\n60% worry about a family member getting COVID-19\n\n57% worry about another school shutdown\n\n56% worry about being able to finance childâs college education\n\nGood news multiple sources show a decline in incidents of bullying\n\nGrief:\n\n1 in 14 students lose a parent before theyâre 18\n\nThis year 175,000 additional children lost a parent or grandparent to COVID-19\n\nTeachers report:\n\n55% will leave or retire early, 1% will work longer, 44% plan no change\n\nTeachers and the public agree there is a shortage of teachers, support staff, counseling & mental health for staff and students, should be more planning and collaboration time, and better scheduled student holidays to reduce long slogs between breaks.\n\nIn Kennedy v. Bremerton School District\n\nthe U.S. Supreme court rules that the decision not to rehire a public school's athletic coach, because of his insistence on praying, often with students, at the 50 yard line after games violated the coach's free exercise of free speech rights.\n\nWhen does state sponsered religious exercise become coercive?\n\nWhen is a school employees personal free exercise, in the presence of students, coercive?\n\nDoes the relationship between the student and school employee or the student's age and experience make a difference?\n\nThe majority opinion, led by Neil Gorsuch said: an innocent coach was fired because he briefly and unobtrusively knelt at midfield after a football game to give thanks when students were otherwise unoccupied or left the field. There was no evidence of coercion even though some might have been offended, it was not coercion.\n\nDissent, led by Sonia Sotomyor said: while he began his prayers alone, overtime most players on the team came to pray, the coach would hold up student helments and speak religious references while players knelt around him, showing coercive pressure. The coach also prayed in the locker room, before being ordered to stop. The case was not about private prayer at work. Is is about: is a school district required to allow an employee to perform a public communicative display of their personl religious beliefs at a school event.\n\n2021\n\nSegregation continues\n\nMask mandates & schools\n\nLower courts rule for and against mask mandates with a possible push to restore local discretion to make the decision at the local level. Ruling with statements such as ... there is little harm to defendants in leaving a universal mask mandate to local districts discretion. However, studies found schools without mask mandates had 3.5 times more Covid 19 outbreaks.\n\nSome notable rulings:\n\nIn Zinman v. Nova Southeastern U. the United States District Court rules against a Florida studentâs argument that a mask requirement violates his First Amendment free speech rights by requiring him to express subservience to authority â¦ and â¦ not allowing him to express a message of disapproval for mask mandates by not wearing one. The court ruled against him reasoning â¦ defiance of a law or regulation to communicate disagreement of the law or regulation is insufficient for free speech protection. Otherwise, people could refuse to wear a seatbelt or motorcycle helmetâ¦ And he could wear a mask with I hate masks written on it, to express a message of disapproval.\n\nIn Resurrection School v. Hertel the 6th. Circuit rules against Catholic school parents and students who challenged Michiganâs law that required all persons 5 years and older to wear a mask indoors, including public and private K-12 schools. The court rejected the claim that wearing a mask violated their right to free exercise of religion by fully taking part in a Catholic education, as masks are uncomfortable and distract from their religious education. The court cited the Supreme Court 1990 decision in Emp. Div. v. Smith to uphold the law as having neutral and general applicability with incidental effect on religion.\n\nIn ARC of Iowa v. Reynolds the United States District Court rules that Iowaâs mask mandate ban likely violates federal disability law because it did not make school program services and activities readily accessible to disabled students in the most integrated setting possible, because unmasked conditions are dangerous to children with disabilities or moving them to inferior remote learning, which unnecessarily segregates them from non disabled students.\n\nCampaigns to undermine public schools continue\n\nPublic schools depend on their communities to work well. The better the community and tax base the higher the quality of education.\n\nIt is the public outcries, about issues such as: critical race theory, ethnic studies, inclusive curriculums, bilingual education, transgender, sex education, which are promoted to stroke fears and win elections for candidates who are, anti-public school.\n\nThey want to undermine public schools by reducing their resources for tax cuts and moving resources with vouchers and other subsidies from public schools to private schools and corporate schools.\n\nCurrent attacks used to spread fear about public education.\n\n1.Critical race theory includes explanations for how race is tied to a legal and social system. Such as redlining. Critical race theory is not a curriculum.\n\nIn 2020 Christopher Rufo deliberately initiates attacks on government and education by making absurd distorted claims about CRT. His attacks steadily drive up negative perceptions and turn CRT toxic.\n\n2. History curriculums should include truthful age appropriate stories from diverse backgrounds and cultures.When truthful and age appropriate stories are not told, it is censorship. And when a collective group of ideas is censored, a dishonest form of propoganda is communicated for a political purpose, such as to stoke fear and create injustice, which when acted on results in not learning a full history and does not provide the background and reasoning to confront injustices.\n\n3. Claims of losing freedom, choice, fairness, and liberty to choose what is best for every child. States continue to pass laws for vouchers, freedom of choice, open enrollement, charter schools, home schooling, and on the fly home school pods. All with mixed results for better academic achievement, increased segregation, deminished special education sevices, transfers public tax money to for profit schools, allows citizens with upper incomes to hoard educational opportunities and resources, decreases per pupil spending, reallocates tax expenditures. Reinforced by\n\n4. Deemphasizing the necessity of government to provide education that unifies its country's citizens. And instead emphasizing education as a parental right or responsibility to chose to provide a singular focused education for a profitable career. As if we are consumers shopping for our children's futures. A process which creates mistrust and fear of personal failure to do so successfully. Instead of understanding the public necessity of education as a shared consequence required for a healthy nation.\n\nThe dilema\n\nParents want their children to be prepared to survive and thrive.\n\nA state wants citizens that are economically productive and content or complacent as the capital necessary to support and sustain the state.\n\nPublic education was created to achieve these goals.\n\nPeople will support public schools and the education they provide if they believe: â¦\n\nWhat it provides is a legitimate and fair. And the system is equitable in how it determines and educates each person for a social role that each person deserves.\n\nHistorically this was achieved by the belief that people were gifted or limited by their birth right and could alter their fortune for better or worse depending on their ability and effort. Thus making what they do or do not achieve deserved.\n\nToday, an equity belief that everyone is capable and deserving focuses cause of success and failure on individual effort, grit, ... and resources available.\n\nTo provide success for all, requires a caring inclusive society that is well managed and thriving. One that recognizes the power a diverse population has when they collaborate to solve problems rather than withdrawing into smaller factions who achieve far less.\n\nWe achieve this by taking charge through collaboration of our learning and teaching, by recognizing everything humans have achieved. All the good, the bad, and the ugly in ways that expand our circle of empathy â¦. from tribes to the whole World and cooperate to achieve Jeffersonâs democracy.\n\nIntentionally or not, support of private schools can increase discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizen status, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or special education status and divides, rather than unites, us as a country.\n\n2020\n\nCovid 19 creates an uncertain school environment. Some challenges include:\n\nLack of knowledge on how serious the viral infection is for different ages of people and the consequences of being infected.\n\nThe risks on students and teacher for teaching and learning safely in a different kinds of school environments.\n\nLack of initial understanding of the virus, how it is spread, lack of health protocols, and shortages of protective equipment.\n\nNot knowing if it is possible to have safe face to face instruction.\n\nHow to provide equipment and expertise for everyone or some groups to learn virutally.\n\nHow to help teachers stay healthy and provide support for all changes.\n\nHow to balance public pressure to close schools with the desire to return to school and normalacy.\n\nUncertainty with public health recommendations and infection rates.\n\nLack of effective and timely testing and tracing.\n\nSchool attendance increases world wide in the late 1900âs and early 2000âs\n\nWhile attendance rises achievement remains stubbornly unchanged. Schooling which is successful can be characterized as focusing on personalized adaptive learning to develop every learnerâs maximum potential. Including SPED.\n\nSchools remove police from campuses\n\nConcerns for better use of resources, than paying to have police officers and SROs in schools, causes actions to replace them and reallocate funding.\n\nSchool Boards who cancel contracts with the police depatments and remove SROs from their public schools include: Minneapolis Board of Education, St. Paul, MN, Phoenix, AZ, Oakland, CA, with other schools initiating similar actions.\n\nFirst rulings on transgender\n\nIn Bostock v. Clayton County the United States Supreme Court rules discrimination against employees, because they are gay or transgender, violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal employment discrimination law.\n\nNeal Gorsuch writes:\n\nan employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\n\nIn Adams v. St. Johns County School Board 11th circuit says:\n\nBostock has great import for [the transgender student's] Title IX claim ... [it] confirmed that workplace discrimination against transgender people is contrary to law. Neither should this discrimination be tolerted in schools. The school board's bathroom policy,as applied to [the student], singled him out for different treatment because of his transgender status.\n\nUnited States Supreme Court rules vouchers with public funds can be given to private schools as tuition.\n\nIn 2018 the Montana Supreme Court rules a recently passed school voucher program has the intent to send money to private religious schools. Which, violates a clause in the Montana Constitution written to prevent public money being given to private religious schools; and struck down the entire program.\n\nThe decison is appealed to the United States Supreme Court as Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue. The court rules 5-4 that the Montana Supreme Court decision to prohibit voucher funds going to a school controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination violated the free exercise clause by prohibiting families from sending children to the religious schools of their choice.\n\nSAT adds an Adversity Score to test reports\n\nCollege admission decisions are questioned by the public in the media and in court cases. SAT uses 15 factors, related to cultural, social, and economic background, to calculate an additional score (adversity) for test takers.\n\nSource\n\n2019\n\nSchools resources are still affected by a race based history:\n\nThree out of four neighborhoods redlined on government maps 80 years ago continue to struggle economically.\n\nNon-White school districts, serving the same number of students, get $23 billion less than White districts.\n\nFor every student enrolled, the average non-White school district gets $2,226 less than a White school district.\n\nPoor White school districts get about $150 less per student than the national average, but $1,500 more than poor non White school districts.\n\nIn 61 metropolitan areas redlining still persists.\n\nSource: NEA Today October 2019\n\nMore historical information: The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America. by Richard Rothstein.\n\nThe Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century - (Perkins V) Act is passed and signed into law, replacing the Perkins IV Act of 2006.\n\nThe act includes:\n\nFunds for career exploration and development activities in the middle grades\n\nFunds for comprehensive guidance and academic counseling in the upper grades.\n\nEmpower states and their stakeholders to determine performance goals.\n\nUpdates and expands the definition of special populations to include homeless individuals, foster youth, and those who have aged out of the foster care system, and youth with a parent who is on active duty in the armed forces.\n\nRequires yearly reporting on graduation rates, proficiency, placements, with disaggregated performance by gender, race/ethnicity, ability, ELL, income, and more.\n\nIncreases the amount states may spend on students in state correctional systems.\n\nIncreases the amount states may set aside in a special reserve fund to focus on rural areas, areas with high numbers or concentrations of CTE programs, or areas with gaps or disparities in performance. Source\n\nBethel Ministries v. Salmon\n\nThe religious school sues the state of Maryland for with holding state funds for it's anti-LGBTQ policies. It loses, and appeals to the Supreme Court. The school claims it's policies are based on the religious belief: that there are two immutable and complementary genders ... assigned at birth. Therefore, can not be considered a violation of the state's anti discrimination policy, because they don't relate to admissions.\n\nMaryland officials revoked the church school's eligibility to participate in a voucher program to benefit low-income students and demanded the school pay back thousands of dollars for previous participation in the program.\n\nWaiting an appeal decision ...\n\nFUTURE Act passes\n\nIt authorizes funds for minority-serving institutions of higher education.\n\n2018\n\nParkland shooting\n\nOn Valentines day, 14 students and 3 staff members are murdered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Students speak out and spark a national response of outrage and organize to respond to school violence with increased activism across the country.\n\nCourt rules Gardendale is not permitted to withdraw from the Jefferson County school district to create a separate school district.\n\nHistory:\n\n1965, eleven years after Brown v. Board of Education. Oscar Adams, sued the Jefferson County Board of Education on behalf of Black school children to end the districtâs separate and unequal educational system.\n\n1971 the court approves a desegregation order in Stout v.

Other families oppose the petition and sue to remain.\n\n2017 The court rejects the initial plan. Claims it would move students to more racially isolated schools, schools with less funds, and communicate inferiority to Black students. However, it did accept a more limited plan.\n\n2018 The decision is appealed by both parties. In Stout v. Jefferson County Board of Education the court rules Gardendale is not permitted to withdraw from the Jefferson County school district as the actions were motivated by a discriminatory purpose and hence have no legitimacy at all under our Constitution.\n\nJanus v.

Douglas County\n\nThe Supreme Court rules a student [child with disabilities] offered an educational program providing merely more than de minims progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.\n\nhis moves the achievement level higher than what is set in the 1982 ruling in Board of Education v.

The ruling contends:\n\nThe constitution requires the legislature to provide a general and uniform public school system.\n\nThe entire revenue from the common school fund and state taxes shall be exclusively used for the common school.\n\nCommon schools defined as schools that are common to all children of proper age and capacity, free, and subject to and under the control of the qualified voters of the school district.\n\nCharter schools do not qualify as common schools and can not receive public tax dollars.\n\nWashington's charter schools are not governed by locally elected boards, lack democratic transparency and accountability since they are managed by private organizations that appoint their own boards.\n\nKindergarten & school attendance requirements - 2015\n\n34 states require school districts to provide Â½ day kindergarten\n\n11 states plus D.C. require full day kindergarten: 11\n\n5 states (Alaska, Idaho, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey [only Abbott districts must] do not require districts to offer kindergarten.\n\n15 states plus D.C. require children to attend kindergarten (35 do not)\n\nThe most common birth date by which children must turn 5 to be eligible to enroll in kindergarten is September 1 (19 states).

Easton Area School District case, upholding the lower courts ruling that wearing rubber bracelets with the phrase \"I ♥ Boobies! (Keep A Breast)\" may be protected by the First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nOn Breast Awareness Day two middle school students are asked to remove their bracelets, they refuse and are punished by being denied to attend extra-curricular activities. The court is informed by the fact: âthere were no incidents presented to the Court of any disruption prior to the Schoolâs bracelet ban.â\n\nSummary of professional educator role changes entering twenty-first century\n\nFrom each teacher finding their own teaching style to teaching being defined by a professional community or board,\n\nFrom teaching as dispensing information to teaching as facilitating student's construction of knowledge and learning how to learn,\n\nFrom teaching as technical work to inquiry with authentic instruction,\n\nFrom controlling student behavior to being accountable for student performance,\n\nFrom teachers being managed to teachers as leaders,\n\nFrom learning taking place in the classroom to learning in the world community,\n\nFrom an undefined knowledge base to a rigorous and broadly defined common core knowledge base for students connected to a teacher's knowledge base on creating curriculum, instruction, and assessment.\n\nAlong with new additional ideas like:\n\nTeacher's beliefs and experiences affect what they teach.\n\nKnowledge of children and adolescents is crucial for teaching and student understanding.\n\nTeachers need opportunities to plan, reflect, and analyze to improve their teaching and student learning.\n\n2009\n\nCommon Core State Standards adopted by 43 states\n\nThe National Governors Association and Council of Chief State School Officers, funded in part by the gates foundation support the writing of the Common Core State Standards.

Frederick\n\nAt a school sponsored event, Joseph Frederick displayed a 14 foot banner with \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus.\" during the Olympic torch run through their community. The principal Deborah Morse took away the banner and suspended Frederick for ten days. She used the school policy against the display of material that promotes the use of illegal drugs as justification. Frederick challenged the action on the basis of his right to free speech that was not disruptive. See Tinker v. Des Moines Ind. School District 1969. The US. Supreme Court rules (5-4) that students do have some right to political speech, however, schools may restrict student speech at school sponsored events if the speech promotes illegal drug use.\n\nSupreme Court rules integration plan violates equal protection in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No 1.\n\nThe Seattle School District has an open enrollment policy to resolve segregation and maintain racial diversity. Parents sue on the basis of race being contrary to the Equal Protection clause.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court stops their voluntary integration plan by claiming school officials could only consider race to assign students to schools if there is a compelling interest to remedy past intentional discrimination. Further, the court claims the district did not present a compelling state interest for the use of race in their diversity plan to achieve specific educational benefits sufficient to achieve a compelling state interest.\n\nIt seems the court failed or was unwilling to consider: segregation today is a result of private choices, which have historically been limited by long imposed discriminatory decisions based on social status and racial heritage.\n\nSelman et al. v. Cobb County School District et al.\n\nCourt rules that requiring an evolution warning label on textbooks violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. See 2000\n\nKitzmiller et al. v.

Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2004.\n\n2003\n\nAffirmative action, quotas, and race\n\nOn June 23, 2003, the Supreme Court abrogated Hopwood in Grutter v. Bollinger the U.S. Supreme court rules the United States Constitution does not prohibit the law school's narrow use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining a diverse student body. The ruling means that universities in the Fifth Circuit's jurisdiction can again use race as a factor in admissions (as long as quotas are not used as in Gratz v. Bollinger (2003). Source\n\nSupreme court rules entrance based narrowly on race unconstitutional in Gratz v. Bollinger\n\nTwo White students are denied entry into the University of Michiganâs undergraduate College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and file suit against their advisor. They claim that the admission policy violates the 14th Amendmentâs Equal Protection clause. The U.S. Supreme court rules the policy is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment since it gives automatic preference to minority students on the basis of race.\n\n2003, 2001, 1999, & 1997\n\nStandardized tests, SAT, as biased admission criteria\n\nPryor and Spivey (2003) appeal to the Third Circuit Court It rules there is a sufficient claim for purposeful discrimination under Title VI. However, it also rules the claim did not hold, because Alexander v. Sandoval ruling prevents Title VI from being used by private action.\n\nAlexander v. Sandoval (2001) United States Supreme Court decision held a regulation enacted under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not include a private right of action to allow private lawsuits based on evidence of disparate impact (meaning it may be considered discriminatory if it has a disproportionate adverse impact against any group based on race, national origin, color, religion, sex, familial status, or disability). Thus, making it difficult for private citizens to sue public entities, by requiring they prove intentional discrimination.\n\nPryor v. NCAA (1999), Kelly Pryor and Warren Spivey were offered athletic scholarships in 1999. However, neither student was able to meet Proposition 16 guidelines. The Third District Court ruled in favor of the NCAA, but said it could be possible to bring successful purposeful discrimination suits against the NCAA. Pryor and Spivey argued the NCAA knew Black athletes would receive fewer scholarship. The NCAA stated their intentions were to increase Black athletes graduation rates and not to discriminate against any athlete. District court ruled in favor of NCAA and no intentional discrimination.\n\nCureton v. NCAA (1997), Black student-athletes who met the NCAA grade point average requirement but not minimum SAT score. The district court rules Proposition 16 had a disparate impact on African-American students and violated Title VI. However, the Third Circuit Court reversed the decision. Stating, Title VI only applied to programs or activities using federal funds and since the NCAA does not directly admit students, Title VI does not apply. Furthermore, the Alexander v. Sandoval decision states Title VI only covers intentional discrimination and NCAA argued it wasn't intentional, but trying to insure greater success of athletes.\n\nSummary:\n\nThese cases demonstrate legal actions can create social pressure for change if court decisions do not demand it.\n\nInstitutions should be wary if they use entrance exams. They should carefully evaluate their admission requirements and be prepared to justify possible effects on graduation rates of their applicant pools. Source\n\n2002\n\nNo Child Left Behind (NCLB), increases the federal role in public education. It does not provide national standards, but requires states to develop or adopt their own standards. It focuses on accountability through state-mandated standardized testing and punishment to improve schools and ultimately the education of our youth. Based on the belief data driven decision making (DDDM) should diagnose student needs, implement target support based on data that informs curriculum will improve schools and student achievement.\n\nStates are required to use their designated standards and create a system that uses standardized annual testing to collect multiple measures to determine if adequate yearly progress (AYP) is met and report this information to the public and government officials for the evaluative purpose of rewarding and punishing schools through Title 1 funding and corrective measures. States are also required to determine what makes a highly qualified teacher.\n\nCorrective measures:\n\nSchools that miss AYP two consecutive years are publicly labeled as in need of improvement and must develop a two-year improvement plan. Their students were permitted to transfer to a better school in the district, if one exists.\n\nIf AYP is not met the third year, they must provide free tutoring and additional support services for students.\n\nIf AYP is not met a fourth consecutive year, they are required to take corrective action, which can be replacement of all staff, introduction of a new curriculum, increase class time for students.\n\nAfter a fifth consecutive year, they must develop a plan to restructure the entire school. The plan must be implemented if AYP is not achieved in the sixth year. restructure plans can be to close the school, turn it into a charter school, hire a private company to run the school, or have the state take it over.\n\nSupreme Court rules state vouchers can be paid to religious schools.\n\nZelman v. Simmons- Harris Ohio enacts a tuition voucher in Cleveland City Schools for students to use in religious and secular private schools. Ohio taxpayers challenged it as a violation of the Establishment Clause. The court rules vouchers are neutral in terms of religion, because children and families, rather than schools, benefit, therefore, did not violate the Establishment Clause.\n\nSupreme Court rules drug testing of students in extracurricular activities legal.\n\nBoard of Indian school District #92 of Pottawatomie County v. Earls the district required urinalysis to participate in extra curricular activities. Earls challenged the policy as a violation of students' Fourth Amendment rights to privacy. Court ruled in favor of the District noting the testing was done in a minimally intrusive manner and consistent with the interest of deterring drug use. This builds on Vernonia School District v. Acton 1995 allowing testing of student athletes.\n\n2001\n\nU.S. Supreme Court rules that a school board's mandatory school uniform policy did not violate the First Amendment rights of its students\n\nCanady v. Bossier Parish School Board. In the 1998-1999 school year, the school board implements a mandatory school uniform policy. Parents challenged the new dress code on First Amendment grounds. The Fifth district court ruled dress could be a form of expression protected by the first amendment. However, a uniform policy could be upheld if it supports an important or substantial government interest, an interest unrelated to the suppression of student expression, restrictions to speech were no more than necessary to further the state interest, and it was not meant to curtail any particular viewpoint or message. The court ruled the policy did not.\n\n2000\n\nThe Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection act (COPPA) goes into effect\n\nIt is not enforced enough to make a difference.\n\nRodney LeVake v Independent School District 656, et al.\n\nMinnesota State District Court dismiss the case brought by the school district against a high school biology teacher who argued he had the right to teach evidence both for and against the theory of evolution. The court rules the school district considered the content of what he was teaching did not match the curriculum, which requires the teaching of evolution. Therefore, he does not have a free speech right to override the curriculum. See also 1997 & 2005\n\nSanta Fe Independent School District v.

Secondary school goals and objectives were oriented toward college prep for the able, vocational studies for the less able, and preparation for everyone to become productive obedient citizens. Taught by certified teachers, using direct instruction methodologies in group settings and a subject centered curriculum. Quality education was subsidized by women who were limited by lack of professional job opportunities in other areas of employment. This increased the number and quality of professional educators while it depressed wages and reduced taxes. This began to change as employment opportunities opened to women after the mid 1900's.\n\nEducational ideas in the 1920's that influenced education:\n\nInformation was packaged in subjects, measured with Carnegie Units, in a seven and eight period day, over an average 180 day school year. Information was delivered through lecture and textbooks and assessed with standardized tests which were largely multiple choice.\n\nInformation At the beginning of the century the Committee of Ten standardized information by subjects and somewhat delineated relevant content they important. At the other end of the century professional organizations for different subjects gathered and wrote standards for content, teaching, and administration based on their particular subjects. P21 Partnership for 21st Century Learning wrote standards that included life learning skills. Information selected and described by all these committees some consider ideological or dogmatic. A large segment of the general public believe it is sufficient that content be limited to a collection of common facts necessary to be job ready at graduation. They chide a liberal education that is open to investigation that encourages problem solving and critical thinking about big ideas through alternate paths of study that often culminates in uncertainty and skepticism with the discovery of multiple possibilities. This liberal or progressive education is often coupled with student interest met with student empowerment and choice, which many people believe will result in students making poor choices and not working hard enough to achieve a high quality elite education. Openness allows for many entry points of learning, makes room for different voices, is the best guarantee to discover and fixes errors so children and adolescents learn better and educators learn how to make education better. Learning, education and schooling are always works in progress.\n\nMandatory education for all children and adolescents of a certain age increased the number of students. This created a need for an increase in the total number of schools or for each school to be larger to meet the demand of the increasing enrollment.\n\nEducation for all. In the twentieth century the idea of a public education for all, equal access, school choice, and the idea all students can learn became stronger as the century unfolded. Toward the beginning of the century, 1918, compulsory education laws existed in all states. However, few people believed all really meant all children. Women, non-White, handicapped, ability, poor, and LBGTQ ( lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questionable people) were mostly thought to be less able or worthy of a high quality education. These changes were influenced by greater acceptance of a more broad definition of all. Events such as in 1920 women were granted the right to vote, 1954 with Brown vs. Board of Education affect on segregation amid separate and equal, 1928 restructure of Native American education, 1969 and later laws for children with learning disabilities, and 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act and Title 1 to address socio-economic limitations. ...\n\nLimited resources created a desire to find economical and efficient solutions. A simple solution was to put greater numbers of students in schools and increase class sizes. As crowding increased larger building were built and benefited by having greater resources in a common location. This lead to thinking of consolidation of school districts as more efficient and economical. Specialization of teachers in the upper grades. Instead of increasing school districts more and more states choose to consolidate school boards into bigger districts decreasing the number of independent school districts in the U.S.\n\n1920 - 200 000+; 1952 - 67 000; 1982 - 14 851; 2012 - 12 880; Source\n\nThis decrease in school boards and districts had a significant detrimental effect of reducing the number of school board members. Community leaders who had a vested personal involvement dedicated to know what was happening in their schools to make decisions that would best benefit their students in a democratic manner. For example: if there were 200 000+ school boards in 1920 with an average of 8 members per board, that would be 1.6 million board members. In 2012 if there were12 880, then that would be about 100 000. That is a significant difference that would seem to have a large effect on people's positive involvement in education. Further, if the increase in population from 1920 to today was considered, then the increase of the number of people that each board member represents is even more detrimental to school community relations.\n\nGovernance. As schools and districts grew so did concerns of governance, quality of instruction, standardization, evaluation, and accountability of teaching and learning. Hierarchal bureaucracies were created, similar to military and factory organizations to address these concerns, too often, with the belief they could be managed with rewards (merit pay, grading, scholarships, ...) and punishment (school closure, expulsion, firing teachers...). Thinking of learning as production on an assembly line factory managed with efficient spending of resources and effective instructional methods to achieve a quality standardized education. Creation of instructional methodologies (mastery learning, directed instruction, cooperative learning, learning cycle ...), effective instructional strategies, teacher proof curriculum, scripted teaching, standardized uniform curriculum, ...\n\nControl of schools moves from teacher and boards of education to state and national government. With more rules and regulations being imposed top down in the name of accountability and standardization with high stakes standardized tests used to rate students and schools. Eliminating local control and personal choice and empowerment of students and teachers, parents and communities.\n\nValidation of organizational patterns and instructional methodologies being substantiated with information analyzed through scientific and statistical means. Standardized testing to sort students and validate achievement, teacher assessment, teacher training with the teacher in a scripted role of technocrat. Required entry level testing, certification testing, teacher observation, peer evaluation... All based on the assumption that if one can define it, then it can be measured.\n\nGood teachers - Review 100 years of what mades good teachers and how they were assessed. Good teachers, Plural, by Donald R Cruickshand & Donald Haefele in Ed Leadership, 2001.\n\nProfessionalization Teachers as professionals is advocated. As teachers see value in meeting and sharing ideas, to increase the quality of their teaching and the quality of education for their students, they create The National Education Association (NEA) and American Federation of Teachers (AFT). WIthin these organizations various ideas to achieve these goals are explored. Ideas such as: all employees should have the guaranteed right to join a union and have a voice on their job. Collective bargaining and strikes to negotiate with state and local school boards over better working conditions and an equitable wage. Due process and job protection from irrational dismissal. These organizations become most important, as many studies suggest, for self-governance and teacher autonomy, than getting higher wages. Important for not only empowering teachers as professionals, but to create environments were students see self-governance in action so they may learn that democracies can be messy, but they can also work. Research will strongly suggest collective bargaining rights strengthen the organization they represent along with their entire community, and protect our democracy.\n\nMore resources:\n\nThe Benefits of Collective Bargaining in Public Schools\n\nThe Labor Union Movement in America at the social studies help center.\n\nif link doesn't work try - The Labor Union Movement in America\n\nSee professional changes in early twenty-first century.\n\nTwentieth century\n\n1999\n\nColumbine High School shooting\n\nIn Columbine, Colorado two high school students murder 12 students and one teacher on April 20.

Were teachers would collaborate and experiment with fresh innovative pedagogical approaches and curriculum. Where what they learned would be shared with traditional schools to improve them.\n\nIn his vision these schools were administratively included within current education schools districts or systems. He believed in democracy and the importance of students seeing it modeled first hand in their classes and by seeing teachers as active participants in the decision making of the charter school. He also believed unions played a critical role in democratic societies and wanted charter schools unionized.\n\nHis ideas were sparked with a visit to a school in Cologne, Germany, which was very unlike the traditional tightly tracked German schools. This school had teams of teachers who had considerable input in how the school was run and were empowered to make pedagogical decisions and curriculum choices. Teachers stayed with a class of students for six years. Students were of mixed abilities, family incomes and ethnic origins. Immigrants were educated alongside native students in mixed-ability groups. Resulting in 60% doing well enough to be admitted to a four-year college. This can be compared to 27% of students nationally.\n\nSee New York Times: The Original Charter School Vision for additional information.\n\nNational Certification\n\nThe National Board for Professional Teaching Standards offers national certification for accomplished teachers.\n\nEdwards v.

Advocated, mastery learning, instruction that used assessment initially and periodically to identify what students know so feedback with corrective procedures could be determined that match students needs to enhance their learning so they might attain master of content at an accuracy level of 90% or higher. If students didn't achieve mastery, after initial instruction, they would cycle through more instruction. While those who were successful were given enrichment activities to elaborate and deepen their understanding.\n\nMastery Teaching\n\nMadeline Hunter's approach to master was described in a seven step instructional, which she referred as elements of a lesson design. Briefly the first four steps; were to focus on, define, provide input, and model the intended learnings; followed by three assessment steps: to check for understanding, and assess during guided and independent practice. The planning guide was part of what she called an Instructional Theory into Practice Teaching Model (ITIP).\n\nMadeline Hunter Teach MoreâFaster!.

Three stages: exploration, invention, and discover were included that are characterized by:\n\nStudent-centered. Accepts students have preconceived ideas they must explore and discover their value based on reasoning and data.\n\nObservation of concrete materials to use as evidence combined with primary sources must be used for students to explore, invent, and discover new ideas.\n\nPeople learn by equilibration.\n\nPeople learn with their exploration, categorization, communication, construction, negotiation, translation, extension, reflection, and self-assessment to construct explanations and understanding.\n\nTeachers understand learning is interactive and they must encourage students with questions, wait-time and encourages them to be open-minded as they negotiate construction of explanation and understanding.\n\nEmbedded in the a learning cycle theory is initial recognition of the importance of self, beliefs, motivation, metacognition, cognitive theory, and knowledge expression (how what is deemed important to learn is defined and expressed, as subjects, literacy, integration, curriculum ...).\n\nCooperative learning 1974+\n\nEarly contributions 1900-1950\n\nSocial theory began to recognize cooperative learning was more effective and efficient in quantity, quality, and overall productivity than working alone.\n\nM. May and L. Doob found that people who cooperate to achieve common goals, were more successful, than independent people who completed the same goals. The independent achievers also demonstrated more competitive behavior.\n\nJohn Dewey's contributions to today's cooperative learning theory are: importance of school and democracy, students as active recipients of knowledge, students being engaged in the learning process, students communication with peers, and less teacher lecture.\n\nKurt Lewinâs contributions to cooperative learning are: ideas of the importance of relationships between group members to achieve learning goals.\n\nMorton Deutshâs contribution to cooperative learning was positive social interdependence, and student responsible to contribute to group learning.\n\nThese ideas were combined by David and Roger Johnson into a systematized planning and instructional procedure and cooperative learning theory from the mid 1970's into the 1980's and 1990's.\n\nIn 1975, they identified that cooperative learning promoted positive relationships between students, positive feelings about the subject matter, better communication, higher achievement, and greater use of higher-order social, personal and cognitive skills. Johnson and Johnson published the 5 elements positive interdependence, face-to-face interaction, individual and group accountability, interpersonal or small group skills, and group processing. Cooperative learning theory, benefits, elements, steps, strategies, and planning information.\n\nReciprocal teaching 1982+\n\nBrown & Paliscar developed reciprocal teaching, a type of cooperative learning developed for reading. It has been expanded for other subject areas with a more general procedure that can be used with pairs or small groups.\n\n1970\n\nAbout 70% adolescents completed hight school and earned a diploma.

Duke Power Company Black employees sued their employer, Duke Power Company, contending that it violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by requiring a high school diploma and a satisfactory intelligence test score for certain jobs previously limited to White employees.

In the following days small fires were set, window destroyed, and an ROTC building was set on fire. Four protesters were killed, and nine were injured.\n\nAfter the Brown v. Board of Ed. ruling in 1954, additional cases were brought that questioned the decisionâs application. Judges narrowed the application to the ruling by claiming it only applied to segregation created by laws or state action (de jure segregation). Another limitation is the population of students.\n\nIn Cisneros v. Corpus Christi ISD the school segregated Mexican American student by claiming, since there was no law or state action for segregation of Mexican American students, any segregation of these students was de facto segregation, and Brown shouldnât apply. The court rules, both de jure and de facto segregation existed in the Corpus Christi school board decisions about attendance zones, where to build, and student transfers perpetuate segregation.\n\n1969\n\nCongress passes the Children with Specific Learning Disabilities Act. 1969\n\nThe first time federal law mandated support services for students with learning disabilities.

Justice Abe Fortas writes in the majority opinion:\n\nStudents have freedom of speech or expression:\n\nIt can hardly be argued ... students ... shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\n\nThe state can not prevent students from expressing ideas simply because their message may run contrary to the state's preferred message.\n\nEmphasizes it is the school's responsibility to educate citizens capable of civic discourse and to do so requires free and open debate of all ideas.\n\nThe court considers three issues to consider when regulating student speech.\n\nIf the school expects the speech to substantially disrupt or interfere with school activities. (Tinker did not.)\n\nIf the speech materially and substantially interferes with the discipline in the operation of the school and collides with the rights of others. (Tinker did not.)\n\nSchool officials can not prohibit expression based on classmate's disruptive reaction to the speech. It must be the speaker themselves that disrupt school activities. (Tinker did not.) This is known as the heckler's veto.\n\nIf the [state] can silence the speaker, the law in effect acknowledges a veto power in the hecklers who can , by being hostile enough, get the law to silence any speaker of whom they do not approve. Harry Kalven 1965\n\nJustice Abe Fortas summarizes the contentiousness of free speech.\n\nAny variation from the majority's opinion may inspire fear. Any word spoken, in class, in the lunchroom, or on the campus, that deviated from the view of another person may start an argument or cause a disturbance. But our Constitution says we must take this risk, and our history says that it is this sort of hazardous freedom-that this kind of openness-that is the basis of our national strength and of the independence and vigor of Americans who grow up and live in this relatively permissive, often disputatious, society.
