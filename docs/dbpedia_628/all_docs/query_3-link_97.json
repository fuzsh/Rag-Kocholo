        "text": "For most Virginians the legacy of their Commonwealth, or, as it is nicknamed, the Old Dominion, is not simply local, but of paramount national significance. As an editorial cartoon from a 1939 number of the Richmond News Leader graphically asserted, the United States, as we traditionally conceive of it, began in Virginia when the English founded Jamestown in 1607. Sir Walter Raleigh named the colony for Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen, and the name implies the promise the early settlers saw. At the very beginning, Captain John Smith proclaimed Virginia a “country that may have the prerogative over the most pleasant places of Europe, Asia, Africa, or America.… Here are mountains, hills, plains, valleys, rivers and brooks all running most pleasantly into a fair bay compassed, but for the mouth, with fruitful and delightsome land.” 1\n\nThe home of many of the founding fathers and early political leaders of the nation, Virginia was also the center of the Confederacy, and on its soil were fought some of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War. It has been the home of national heroes and heroines, from Pocahontas and George Washington to Bill “Bojangles” Robinson and Arthur Ashe. Until 1820 Virginia, as both colony and state, led the country in population. Richmond, the state capital from 1779 onward, conceived of itself as the first city of the South, and until the 1890s, when other regional cities surpassed it in population and manufacturing, it was the leading southern metropolis in finance, production of goods, and, many would claim, sophistication. Norfolk and the Tidewater cities were early commercial and shipping centers for the new country. Agriculturally, Virginia was and remains a major producer of livestock, corn, peanuts, and “green gold,” as Captain Smith called tobacco. From the 1930s onward a new aspect of Virginia's legacy opened as the northern part of the state closest to Washington, D.C., became the locus for military bases, the Pentagon, massive suburbanization, and “Edge City.”\n\nArtistically and culturally, Virginia's greatest legacy is its architecture. Far more than through painting, literature, or any other traditional art form, it is through built form that Virginia has been known and has influenced the nation. George Washington's Mount Vernon and Thomas Jefferson's Monticello easily rank as two of the most famous historic houses in the United States and among the most visited. Colonial Williamsburg is the touchstone for understanding eighteenth-century life in this country as well as the paramount example of restoration on a large scale. Most Americans know of it even if they have not visited it. Virginia's prototypical houses—the large red brick, white-trimmed manorial house and the small, one-and-one-half-story clapboard cottage—and architectural details such as the spindly posts of Mount Vernon's portico can be found all across the United States. Scarcely an American city lacks evidence of the Virginia heritage. Over the last century the study and preservation of Virginia's early architecture has been the state's most important contribution to the nation.\n\nBut the built environment of Virginia is far more than grand houses or restored colonial villages. It is, beginning with Jamestown in 1607, the nearly four-centuries-old accumulation of the traditional perspective of most American history. Eastern Virginia has been molded almost constantly by the hand of man for thousands of years—and much more intensely in the past four hundred. Scarcely a place, from cleared fields, now so overgrown that they appear natural, to the coastal area, has not been altered in some artificial manner. Before the English settled here, Native Americans tended and shaped the land and constructed buildings and villages, although very little remains of their culture. Moreover, many European-built buildings have also disappeared, leaving faint trace.\n\nNevertheless, the remaining built legacy of Virginia is vast, and, from a broad architectural point of view, every constructed element and every alteration or artificial mark on the landscape contains some level of significance and can be interpreted. Of course not everything can be included here. The purpose of a guide such as this, and of architectural history, is to select: to choose those buildings, cities, towns, and landscapes that tell both representative and unique stories.\n\nVirginia contains an embarrassment of riches, from its well-known and high-profile buildings to its hidden treasures. Traditionally, most attention has focused on the colonial and the antebellum periods. There is an old saying: “In Virginia, history stops in 1826” (or 1840, or 1860). The date depends on who is talking, but the fact remains that the past is very present in Virginia, and especially in its historic architecture and the mania for reproducing it. However, in recent years interest in later architecture—for instance, Victorian and even early modern—has risen.\n\nThe amount of published material on Virginia architecture would make even the most compulsive bibliophile quake. More has probably been written about its buildings than those of any other state. Earlier than any other state, Virginia had a statewide historic preservation organization, the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (APVA, founded 1889); its efforts, along with others, have staved off the destruction of some important elements of the past. Still, too much has been lost. The program in architectural history at the University of Virginia, established in 1958, was the first in the nation.\n\nIn 1965 the commonwealth's General Assembly began to consider what role the state should have in the preservation of the past. Its examination led in 1966—well before such measures in most other states—to the establishment of the Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission, now the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. By 2001 the Historic Resources staff had placed on either the Virginia Register or the National Register of Historic Places more than 2,100 buildings and places and more than 230 historic districts. It is estimated that more than 50,000 resources (buildings, landscapes, sites) are included. The staff maintains files on approximately 100,000 properties. A compilation of this listing, The Virginia Landmarks Register, is in its fourth edition (1999). Several cities, such as Richmond, Leesburg, and Alexandria, have architectural historians on their planning staffs. Virginia is probably the only state that has had two exhibitions devoted to architectural drawings of its buildings, the first in 1969 and another in 1992, and a guidebook to its architecture published as early as 1968. 2All of these activities and publications and the many more noted later in this introduction and in the bibliography indicate the tremendous richness—and the problem of selection (see Guide for Users of This Volume, preceding this introduction).\n\nNative American Habitation\n\nWhen the English stepped ashore in 1607, they found a native culture with its own settlement patterns and buildings that had shaped the landscape in distinctive ways. Virginia was populated by tribes that included the Pamunkey, Mattaponi, Chickahominy, Powhatan, Iroquois, and Susquehannock; but almost all of this native culture has disappeared. The ancestors of the seventeenth-century Native Americans had been here for at least 10,000 years, and one of the earliest Paleo-Indian sites in the Western Hemisphere is located in Warren County in western Virginia. The buildings of the Native Americans recorded in European prints and other documents show light, wood-frame structures, earth fast (with the poles or framing secured directly in the ground), covered with mud, bark, woven mats, or hides, and shaped something like a beehive. Settlements were organized in a hierarchy, and apparently some were defended by timber palisades. The Native Americans farmed fields, hunted, and maintained the landscape. The trails became the foundations for later roads and turnpikes. Although the earliest colonists, such as Captain John Smith, had some interest in the natives and attempted to describe and depict them, and the story of the earliest American heroine, Pocahontas, results from this interaction, most of the colonists saw them only as impediments to exploitation of the land and decimated them. Apart from the odd visitor's chronicle, the Native Americans did not become objects of interest until nearly 180 years later, when Thomas Jefferson began a small archaeological excavation on the Rivanna River in Albemarle County. The state designated two Indian reservations, for the Pamunkey and Mattaponi in King William County, on the Middle Peninsula.\n\nNineteenth-Century Prosperity (c. 1780–c. 1840)\n\nAfter the Revolution Virginia experienced tremendous prosperity, and, although business declined periodically, until around 1840 the state stood at the peak of its economic and political power. Its status was apparent in the decision to locate the national capital, Washington, D.C., on the Potomac and in the fact that seven of the first twelve presidents were Virginians. Settlement spread west, up through the Piedmont and beyond, and modest commercial cities developed. But about 1840, Virginia's position as the first among equals began to recede. Its soil was increasingly worn out, and although alternatives were sought by some enterprising businessmen, such as those involved in the establishment of the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, an increasingly defensive mentality ruled.\n\nRichmond became the capital of Virginia in 1779 at the instigation of Thomas Jefferson, and the focus of power shifted. Williamsburg, which was Virginia's only real urban center, began to fade away, not to regain importance until the 1930s, as a museum. Other cities—Alexandria, Fredericksburg, Norfolk, and Portsmouth—emerged as major trading centers, and the smaller Piedmont towns gained slowly in size. Virginia's ethos remained in the countryside, in the Jeffersonian ideal of the farmer and the landed gentry as the bedrock of the new nation, but a new and very different environment developed.\n\nThe so-called Federal era in Virginia, c. 1780–1810, was typified by a “great rebuilding,” common along much of the East Coast, as members of the newly risen middle class either extensively remodeled their houses or built completely new ones. Not just an architectural stylistic change, this rebuilding was accompanied by changes in manners, activities, and possessions. In Virginia—and elsewhere—a number of forms developed, but the most popular type was in many places the so-called I-house, a fusion of earlier vernacular and high styles into a dwelling with a single-pile plan for the front part—a central hall and a room to each side—two stories in height, and a wing, or ell, to the rear. Constructed of wood or brick, the I-house could have, depending on the wealth and hubris of the owner, various degrees of ornamentation as well as size. The ornament and trim of these houses increasingly came from American pattern books, such as Asher Benjamin's and Minard Lafever's various publications, which were the most popular among Virginians. The I-house was a staple of the Virginia building economy well into the twentieth century. Houses built during the Federal period vastly outnumber everything built before the late eighteenth century, indicating the new prosperity. At a lesser scale was a one-story variant of the I-house with a main-floor plan of central hall and a room to either side, bedrooms or chambers under the sloping roof, and an ell to the rear. Along with new building, a change took place in modest older houses, in single-room shacks and hall-parlor houses, which received new furnishings and frequently subdivision of interior spaces. In Virginia some of this interior subdivision, as with the shift in room usage during the earlier part of the eighteenth century, was related to new concepts of privacy and etiquette and an attempt to create visual barriers and keep slaves from view.\n\nIn cities and towns a variety of house types developed. Although freestanding I-houses were common, the row house type, three bays wide, with an entrance-side passage and room across the front, was becoming the norm in Virginia and can still be found from Norfolk to Charlottesville. Size and materials depended on the owner's wealth. Frequently, the owner's workshop or store would occupy the ground floor. Surviving commercial structures are rare: a few late eighteenth-century warehouses along King Street in Alexandria; Hugh Mercer's apothecary shop (1780), Fredericksburg; and the restored and reconstructed buildings along Duke of Gloucester Street in Williamsburg.\n\nAnother major change in the Virginia landscape was the appearance, often in isolated locations, of a new church type, along with new denominations. The Anglican church, which became the Episcopal church after the Revolution, was disestablished in 1786, and glebe lands—which had helped support the Anglican clergy—were sold off. Competing for souls were new, or dissenter, sects—Baptists, Presbyterians, Lutherans, Quakers, Methodists—and in time Roman Catholics. All had been present before the Revolution but in small numbers. With religious freedom, they flourished at the expense of the Episcopal church. Many Episcopal churches completely disappeared, and others included in this guidebook fell out of use between the 1780s and the 1830s. In reaction to the popularity of the dissenter groups, the Episcopal church, under the leadership of bishops Richard Channing Moore and William Meade, became resolutely “low church” and de-emphasized liturgy. This anti–“high church” policy remained in effect well into the latter nineteenth century, and consequently, with few exceptions, such as Benjamin Henry Latrobe's St. Paul's, Alexandria—a nationally significant building—the Episcopal church in Virginia never took the stylistic lead in the Gothic Revival as it did in other parts of the country. Instead, it was the Presbyterians, with Minard Lafever's Second Church, Richmond (1848), and the Baptists, with Thomas U. Walter's Freemason Street Baptist Church, Norfolk (1849–1850), who established the Gothic Revival of the mid-nineteenth century in Virginia. Not until after the Civil War did Episcopalians begin to build in the Gothic Revival style.\n\nHowever, the dominant Virginia church form of the period 1780–1840 and beyond was not Gothic; it was typically a rectangular box with twin entrance doors on a narrow end, and its interior was a single large preaching space with possibly a gallery, as at Emmaus Baptist Church, near Providence Forge, New Kent County, on the Lower Peninsula. Built of wood or brick, these twin-entrance-door churches could have Federal, Roman Revival, or Greek Revival details. The twin doors reflected an interior arrangement that responded to the shift in worship, the emphasis on the spoken word; hence, the pulpit, usually placed at the center of the back wall, became the focal point. Instead of the traditional central aisle, the middle of the nave was furnished with a block of seats with an aisle to either side and corresponding twin entrance doors or twin doors in the narthex. Additionally, some churches separated men in the congregation from women and children, and the doors were assigned by gender. Although this practice largely died out, a few Primitive Baptist congregations today continue to separate the sexes. The twin-entrance church became the archetype in Virginia after 1800, so popular that it was used for the few new Episcopal churches built, such as Christ Church, Glendower, Albemarle County (1831–1832), which could be mistaken for Baptist, were it not for its rich Jeffersonian details.\n\nThe development of Virginia's industrial landscape had begun early with a glassworks in Jamestown. Iron furnaces and ironworks were set up in rural areas, in the Chancellorsville vicinity in Spotsylvania County c. 1717, the Falmouth vicinity in Stafford County c. 1750, and other places; but only modest stone ruins remain. The Tredegar Iron Works was established in Richmond in 1837, and its rapid growth after 1841 helped bring Virginia industry into the big time. It was the source for iron fronts for commercial buildings and other goods, including weapons for the Civil War. Portsmouth and Norfolk prospered from shipbuilding, long established in the Tidewater area. Accompanying this activity was a dramatic increase in scale of government installations, such as Fort Monroe, guarding Hampton Roads, and the Portsmouth Naval Hospital, which stretches along the Elizabeth River.\n\nRural areas always had a mini-industrial landscape of grain mills and lumber mills. The most prominent survivors from this period are Colvin Run Mill, Fairfax County, and Aldie Mill, Loudoun County. Although increasingly the land was worn out, tobacco was a major crop until the 1840s. Tobacco barns, used for curing, were usually insubstantial wooden structures and have left few remains. Tobacco was shipped north to be processed for plug and chewing; not until the 1880s did cigarette production begin.\n\nIn 1831, the Chesterfield Railroad Company opened the first railroad, which hauled coal on tracks some twelve miles, the motive power supplied by mules and horses. Steam-powered rail transportation appeared by 1837, and the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac line had tracks between Richmond and Fredericksburg. Farther north, transportation was still by steamboat, and through rail connections to Washington waited until 1872. Instead of focusing on railroads, Virginians continued to build the great folly, the James River–Kanawha Canal, which would link the Potomac and the Ohio rivers. Millions of dollars and too much time were wasted on this unsuccessful venture, whereas by 1850 the Erie Canal had been open for twenty-five years, and by 1852 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had completed its line to Wheeling, funneling rail traffic to Baltimore, not to Richmond.\n\nThese events and resultant building contributed to the vernacular landscape of Virginia. Another transformation occurred as professional architects made an appearance and substantially changed the look of high-profile buildings. Certainly designers existed earlier, so-called gentleman architects such as Governor Francis Nicholson in Williamsburg and William Byrd III at Westover. Others were skilled craftsmen: John Ariss, a mason who contributed to several churches and possibly other buildings; James Wren, who designed several northern Virginia churches; and William Buckland, a talented joiner who was responsible for the interior at Gunston Hall and a few houses. With some exceptions, the designs of most of this latter group were a byproduct of their involvement in the process of construction. They were not hired specifically to design a structure that would be built by somebody else. Nor were they professionally trained, either through the apprentice system or schooling, to practice as architects. All of this changed in 1796 when Benjamin Henry Latrobe, an architect born and trained in England (though his mother had been born in America), landed in Norfolk, and during the next three years (sometimes under the patronage of Jefferson), mainly in Richmond, designed houses, a prison, and a projected theater and traveled around the state making a series of drawings that remain one of the best records of Virginia buildings. Most of Latrobe's Virginia buildings are gone, but his architectural drawings survive. They illuminate the difference between the professional and the amateur or the builder. Latrobe ultimately traveled north to Philadelphia and trained some of the next generation of American architects, Robert Mills and William Strickland, both of whom made notable contributions to the state's building stock.\n\nAlthough professional architects functioned primarily as designers, the split between architectural design and construction was not complete until much later in the century. Builders, or housewrights, or joiners, or masons frequently styled themselves as architects. In 1810 Alexander Parris came south to Richmond from Boston, where building activity was at a standstill because of British embargo, and in the next two years designed a house for John Wickham and a mansion for the governor in the most up-to-date neoclassical style. Similarly, the workmen Thomas Jefferson employed at the University of Virginia—John Neilson, James Dinsmore, William B. Phillips, Malcolm Crawford, and others—began in the building trade; learned about designing through books, observation, and construction; and went on to significant careers.\n\nThomas Jefferson's place in this changing role of the designer is ambiguous. In many ways he was a gentleman amateur, strictly self-trained from books, observation, and travel. Jefferson had more knowledge and experience of travel abroad than any architect in this country with the exception of the European émigrés, such as Latrobe and Maximilian Godefroy (who worked in Richmond during 1816); indeed, until the advent of the mid-nineteenth-century Beaux-Arts-trained generation represented first by Richard Morris Hunt, Jefferson, among native-born American architects, stands with Charles Bulfinch in firsthand knowledge of European architecture. Jefferson designed his own houses, Monticello and Poplar Forest, Bedford County (the latter in western Virginia), and he was involved in the construction process, which puts him in the categories of both gentleman architect and builder. However, the scale of his later projects, including directing the building of the University of Virginia, is mammoth; the university was one of the largest construction projects in the country at the time. Jefferson did depend on books, as Latrobe complained, but Jefferson also thought very much like a professional architect; his drawings reveal his consideration of alternatives and departure from “rules” when it suited him. When Jefferson's various designs are assembled and compared, it is obvious that he was among the major architects, not just of Virginia, but of the United States; he was both a form giver and a symbol maker.\n\nMonticello remains the primarily personal touchstone for understanding both Jefferson's genius as an architect and limitations as a human being (for instance, the design of the wings to submerge services and keep slavery out of sight); but it was in the public realm, at the Virginia State Capitol, where his importance emerged. From a practical standpoint the design is folly, compressing all the functions of government into a rectangle, but from a symbolic standpoint it is sheer genius: American government symbolized by a religious temple in a classical form which became the official national architectural language. The centerpiece of the interior, Jean-Antoine Houdon's standing figure of George Washington (1788), the commission for which Houdon received through Jefferson's instigation, was not just the first of a long line of monuments to Washington, but the beginning of the national—and Virginia—mania for monuments and memorials. Jefferson also designed, or at least contributed to, three Virginia courthouses (Botetourt, Buckingham, and Charlotte counties, all in western Virginia), which helped create the American predilection for temple porticoes. His design for the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, is certainly his masterpiece and is a model not just for an “academical village” but for how American settlements and the landscape might be ordered.\n\nSome historians have concluded that Jefferson exercised little influence outside the immediate Piedmont area, the location of structures designed and built by the brickmasons, carpenters, and undertakers who worked for him at Monticello and the university. But a larger heritage exists that includes college campuses, houses, and public buildings throughout Virginia and the South that show his influence. His involvement in developing the plan for Washington, D.C., and then the designs for the President's House and the U.S. Capitol was critical: without his participation the public image of the nation's capital would be very different. Moreover, although Jefferson tended to rely on Palladian and antique Roman forms, the Greek Revival, which began in earnest in the 1820s, was indebted to his popularization of the temple form. Indeed, the Greek Revival was not particularly Greek in many of its manifestations, and buildings such as Ammi B. Young's U.S. Customhouse in Norfolk are more Roman than Greek. The debate over Jefferson's architectural proclivities—whether he was a neo–English Palladianist or more committed to French architecture—misses the point that his eclecticism set the stage for the succession of rapidly changing styles that dominated the nineteenth century. Around 1900 Jefferson rose again as a source for the Colonial Revival.\n\nEclecticism and deferent stylistic solutions that involved the personal taste and symbolism of the architect and client dominated Virginia architecture after the 1820s. Important Virginia buildings by such noted figures as Alexander Jackson Davis, Thomas U. Walter, Thomas Stewart, Minard Lafever, James Renwick, Thomas Tefft, Calvin Pollard, Robert Mills, and William Strickland date from this period."
