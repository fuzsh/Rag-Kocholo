        "text": "Early Life and Education\n\nJohn Henry Westerhoff III was born June 28, 1933, in Paterson, New Jersey. Neither John's parents nor his living grandparents were religious, though they were nominally Protestant and occasionally attended church. When John was four months old, his parents had him privately baptized at the First Presbyterian Church in Paterson where they had married. John says of his baptism, that although it was \"at best an act of magic on the part of my parents and [that] church … I count that day among the most significant in my life. That event was kept alive in my unconscious mind through many years … [it was] the day God chose me for ministry, gave me a new identity and vocation as a redeemed person, adopted me into my true family-the church, called me by my new name \"John Henry Christian,\" and branded me for life with the sign of the cross so that I might someday know who I really am and to whom I really belong.\" (Westerhoff, 1983, 120)\n\nWhen he was three John's mother brought him to Sunday school at the Presbyterian church for about a year. It was an intimidating social experience and he found he preferred the silence and space of the liturgical services his parents attended at Christmas and Easter. When John was eight he responded to a neighbor's invitation and began to attend a nondenominational, fundamentalist congregation. The minister took an interest in John. He visited John's home and told his mother that God had called him to be a minister of the Gospel. He also told her that she should encourage him to hold revival meetings in the garage for children in the neighborhood which so upset his mother that she prohibited him from attending that church again.\n\nAs he entered his teens, John was allowed to decide for himself what to do on Sunday mornings and he began attending a Dutch Reformed Community church in Glen Rock, New Jersey, where they had moved. Again the pastor took an interest in John and predicted that he would become a minister. His \"father in God,\" Dr. Vernon Oggell, enlisted him to assist in weekly worship, gave him a Sunday school to teach, and taught him the basics of a Reformed, Calvinist, evangelical, and intellectual approach to the faith.\n\nAt Ursinus College, the evangelical Reformed (now United Church of Christ) school he attended in Collegeville, Pennsylvania after high school, his religious commitment and zeal earned him the nickname \"Preach.\" This was ironic because during this time John went into a period of major doubt and searching, his previous notions of a single and absolute truth being replaced with philosophical relativism, religious pluralism, and scientific rationalism, and boycotting church and chapel. Nevertheless, he prayed regularly, read books on Scripture and theology voraciously, and organized an independent congregation of about twenty other searching or skeptical students for worship and study. His convictions concerning the need for community, the essential nature of the liturgy, the normalcy of instruction and education, and the need for church reform are manifest even in this period. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology in 1955 (Gibbs, 1992, 231).\n\nThe call to be a minister did not subside with the rejection of his childhood/adolescent conservative faith outlook. He immediately entered studies for his Bachelor of Divinity degree (now a Master of Divinity) at Harvard Divinity School and he judged those three years as \"the most significant and transforming years\" of his life (Westerhoff, 2000, 123). There he was exposed to influential professors from a broad spectrum of the Christian faith and theological disciplines. From Paul Tillich in particular he learned a dialectical approach to thinking and he reconciled his internal civil wars between faith and doubt, commitment and openness, reasoning and intuiting, practice and theory, by affirming the paradoxical and complex nature of much of truth and life. John also became convinced that subjective experience, intuition, and affect preceded objective reflection and reason and therefore were more foundational to religious life and that furthermore, these \"right brain\" functions were best nurtured and expressed through the arts and liturgy. Both convictions are articulated early in his writings on Christian education.\n\nDuring his time at Harvard, Westerhoff was hired to direct the youth ministry of the First Congregational Church (United Church of Christ) in Needham, Massachusetts. There he found a father in the faith and a denominational home. The pastor, Herbert Smith, became, in Westerhoff's words, \"my dearest friend and mentor, the single most influential person in my life\" (Westerhoff, 2000,). From Smith he learned to value liturgical worship and education. He was twenty-two when, on All Saints Day, November 1, he was confirmed, affirmed his call to the ordained ministry, and was taken under care by the UCC. In 1958, he was ordained. Westerhoff has commented that his life and his work are \"synonymous\" (Westerhoff, 1983, 117) and that it was reflection on his own and others' faith pilgrimages that led him to his theory of faith development. By this time he had moved from experienced faith as a child through affiliative faith as an adolescent to searching faith in college and owned faith while at Harvard and First Congregational in Needham.\n\nWesterhoff received his first parish in Presque Isle, Main. Two years later he returned to Needham to co-pastor the church that had now grown to more than two thousand people, about half children and youth. He and Smith worked together in developing and overseeing the educational staff and program, an experience that influenced his antipathy to education as a specialized, non-integrated ministry. He helped design and develop one of the early seminary programs in field education. During this time he observed that the hidden curriculum was more influential than the formal program, that intergenerational worship and activities were more engaging and vital than age groups, and that educational resources and programs always needed to be tailored to the specific congregation. Four years later he went to First Congregational Church (UCC) on the campus of Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts where for three years he continued to experiment with ways to accomplish Christian formation. During this time he taught some classes at Harvard Divinity School.\n\nWesterhoff's next eight years were spent on the staff of the United Church Board for Homeland Ministries where he founded and edited \"Colloquy,\" a magazine on education in church and society that published from 1967 to 1974. During this time he traveled around the world, interviewing almost every significant person in the field of church and secular education; the list includes Ivan Illich (who reinforced his skepticism about traditional schooling), Paulo Freire (who persuaded him of the need for liberation theology and pedagogy), Harvey Cox, Brother Christopher of Taizé, Gabriel Moran, Noam Chomsky and others. He wrote, co-wrote, and edited numerous articles and books, including Values for tomorrow's children: An alternative future for education in the church, A colloquy on Christian education (which includes articles by current religious educators such as Sarah Little, C. Ellis Nelson, James E. Loder, Robert W. Lynn, Randolph Crump Miller, and D. Campbell Wyckoff), and Generation to generation: Conversations on religious education and culture. He was a Lecturer in Education and Communication at Harvard, Princeton, and Union Theological Seminaries, produced two children's television shows for NBC, was a reporter for Religious News Service and the World Council of Churches, and was a partner in a consulting firm working with such organizations as the American Association of University Women and the civil rights division of the National Education Association (Wayne E. Oats Institute, 2002,).\n\nDuring those years he had married Bernie, whom he had met in college, and had three children, Jill, Jack, and Beth. He had developed a reputation as a controversial and radical new thinker in Christian education. But by 1974 subscriptions for Colloquy plunged and there was a sense of cultural shift and personal re-orientation. Westerhoff had been revising his North American Liberal Protestant perspective, taking in Latin American liberation theology, digging into the early and medieval periods of the church, and exploring the Roman Catholic catechetical tradition. He did not feel as at home in his denomination as he once had. He was digging for a theoretical foundation for his work and C. Ellis Nelson's theology and ideas about religious socialization provided him with that. John realized that for Christian education to change, the clergy needed to think differently, and that would be aided by his teaching in a seminary. For that he would need a doctorate; he completed an Ed.D. in foundations of education at Columbia University Teachers College in 1974 in just fifteen months. His dissertation, William Holmes McGuffey and value system in the first editions of the Eclectic first, second, third, and fourth readers was the basis for his later book McGuffey and his readers: Piety, morality, and education in nineteenth-century America.\n\nWesterhoff left the United Church Board for Homeland Ministries, and taught at Harvard the next year. A broken neck in a near-fatal car accident provided the final punctuation mark. An invitation to join faculty of the Duke University Divinity School as assistant professor of religious education opened a new twenty-year chapter in his life. During his time at Duke he was tenured and promoted, eventually retiring as Professor of Theology and Christian Nurture. He wrote, co-wrote, and edited about twelve books during this period as well as writing hundreds of articles and book chapters and editing the Religious Education Journal from 1977 to 1987. Robert Lynn characterized Westerhoff's first book as in the tradition of the Tractarians-passionate, contentious, and looking for dialog; most of his subsequent writings continue in the same spirit. He did not systematize his thought; he did not even keep track of his writings. Westerhoff said he wrote books like painters paint paintings. They were explorations of specific issues or questions, and when he had committed his thoughts to print, he moved on quickly to the next problem. Probably his most significant work was the 1976 Will our children have faith?. \"All my other books either prepared me for writing it or have been in some sense commentaries on or expansions of thoughts in this seminal book\" (Westerhoff, 2000, xiii). It was translated into at least six languages and reprinted by a number of publishers. Thousands of seminarians had this book as assigned reading and lay educational ministers looked to it for guidance. Twenty-five years later, a revised and expanded edition was published.\n\nIn 1978 he became a priest in the Episcopal Church, which has remained his denominational home. In this tradition he was able to embrace both the \"Catholic substance and the Protestant principle\" (Westerhoff, 1983, 134); he also thought that his developing ideas on catechesis would be more welcomed. He took up part-time duties in Chapel of the Cross. Westerhoff never saw himself as a professional Christian educator or an academic scholar. His core identity has been priest, pastor, and teacher. But he his professional activities were largely in the realm of religious education, and he associated with the Association of Researchers and Professors of Religious Education (APRRE) and the Religious Education Association (REA). Urban T. Holmes III became a strong influence and the two developed ideas together and coauthored a book.\n\nAfter his marriage ended, John spent the last few years while teaching at Duke in an Anglican monastic community, St. John's House. He then married Caroline A. Hughes with whom he had co-authored a number of books and with whom he continues to collaborate. After a year as interim rector at St. Bartholomew's Church in Atlanta, Georgia, John became theologian-in-residence and staff member at St. Luke's Church. He founded and directs the Institute for Pastoral Studies, a vehicle for his wider teaching and writing ministry. He has received an honorary Doctor of Divinity from his old alma mater, Ursinus College. In 2002, John was anticipating retirement in a few years.\n\nThe material for this essay has been drawn primarily from two autobiographical essays by Westerhoff and a tape-recorded interview with the author.\n\nJohn H. Westerhoff III may be one of the more familiar names in Christian education in North America during the last quarter of the twentieth century. Although he has worked primarily in the mainstream Protestant church (Episcopal, Presbyterian, Lutheran, United Methodist, United Church of Christ, Reformed Church in America, and American Baptist Convention), he has been listened to by evangelical and Catholic as well.\n\n\"Christians are fashioned, not born\" was a favorite quote (from Tertullian) of Westerhoff. His dominant concern has been to help the church move from a schooling model of Christian education to a catechetical model of Christian formation. Critique of the schooling model as monologic, didactic, cognitive, argumentative was in harmony with the concerns of Ivan Illich, Paulo Freire, and others. Catechesis was understood by Westerhoff to be every activity used by the church to initiate and form persons into the Christian community and the Christian faith, ideas in harmony with C. Ellis Nelson.\n\nThere are few comprehensive books on religious since 1976 that do not reference Westerhoff or view him as a strong representative of certain approaches. Jack Seymour states that Westerhoff \"stands in a grand tradition of Christian educators who look to the faith community as the context, content, and method for Christian education theory and practice\" (Seymour, 1982, 20) and calls him a herald of the socialization/enculturation model (Seymour, 1996, 4). Charles R. Foster agrees, naming Westerhoff \"the best known proponent of the community of faith approach.\" (Foster, 1982). Harold Burgess places him in the Mid-Century Mainline model (formerly called the Neo-Orthodox model) and observes that \"passages in John Westerhoff's writings may well be the purest examples of the mainline model in operation\" (Burgess, 1996, 117). Perry Downs refers to him one of the \"two most responsible critics of formalized Christian nurture,\" the other being Larry Richards) (Downs, 1994, 156). Mary C. Boys puts Westerhoff in the \"Christian education with contemporary modification\" camp (over against evangelism, religious education, and catholic education/catechetics) (Boys, 1989, 129) while Thomas Groome typifies him as in the Bushnell-Coe-Nelson tradition. (Groome, 1980, 121).\n\nWesterhoff's influence has been extensive. His book Will Our Children Have Faith? was used extensively in college and seminary religious education classes, is translated into six languages, and has been revised and republished twenty-five years after its original publication. His \"tree rings\" analogy of faith styles or development is often cited (e.g., Habermas & Issler, 1992; Little, 1986; Pazmiño, 1994; Steele, 1990). He has been one of the main engineers shaping the Episcopal understanding of Christian education and formation; he authored the book that continues to give guidance to that denomination (Westerhoff, 1994). Eugene Gibbs includes Westerhoff in his Reader in Christian Education (Westerhoff, 1992) as one of the major contributors to twentieth century Christian education. There have been at least two doctoral dissertations on his work (Lim, 1982; Nicholson, 1981). Kenneth Gangel and Warren Benson in their 1983 history of Christian education recognize that Westerhoff was part of the leadership core in Religious Education Association (Gangel & Benson, 1983, 320), while James Reed and Ronnie Prevost's history includes a section on Westerhoff as one of the noteworthy Christian educators of the twentieth century (Reed & Prevost, 1993, 357-358). Charles Foster notes that \"Thanks in particular to the work of C. Ellis Nelson and John Westerhoff, the insights and categories of sociology and anthropology have come to be increasingly explored and appropriated by Christian educators.\" (Foster, 1982, 58).\n\nWesterhoff is recognized as being among the first North American authors to take notice of liberation theology in 1970 (Schipani, 1988, 6). He was sympathetic to that perspective and became a proponent of liberation theology, contending, that \"liberation theology provides the most helpful theological system for Christian education today\" believing it to allow a synthesis between liberal and neo-orthodox positions (Westerhoff, 1976, 31). Craig Dykstra credits Westerhoff with bringing about the virtual consensus that \"Faith is formed, developed and owned in the context of communities of faith.\" (Dykstra, 1996, 252). Westerhoff has been instrumental in raising consciousness about the elements and scope of Christian education, struggling with nomenclature and definitions and publishing essays and books such as Who are we? (Westerhoff, 1978) on the subject. Ironically, his own preferred term, catechetics, has not gained wide acceptance outside of the Episcopal Church (Groome, 1980, 17) although he finally became content with the term \"Christian formation\" (J. H. Westerhoff, III & Bramer, 2002). Westerhoff has been aligned for a time with each of a variety of perspectives: evangelical, liberal, neo-orthodox, liberationist, Catholic, contemplative, etc. When standing in any one of those traditions, he has been critical of the others, but his life and teaching has enfolded these traditions into his approach. \"Westerhoff has a way of probing at the intersection of theory and practice,\" stated Burgess (Burgess, 1996, 131). Westerhoff changed in many respects over his career, yet he did not change most of his basic assumptions as his afterthoughts in his republished seminal work, Will our children have faith? illustrates (Westerhoff, 2000). Westerhoff has continued to search, question, and provoke while at the same time striving to be faithful to his calling as a pastor-educator.\n\nWesterhoff, of course, has been criticized. Some of the criticism is not so much what he proposes but how thoroughly he criticizes and rejects some other things. For example, Groome states, \"he is so sweeping in his rejection of the \"schooling-instructional\" paradigm that it is difficult to envision the form intentional educational activity might take within his \"community of faith-enculturation\" paradigm.\" (Groome, 1980, 131). James Michael Lee points out the contradiction that Westerhoff questions reliance on philosophy, social science, and general education rather than upon theology, but his approach is quite thoroughly sociological (Lee, 1996, 60). Some see him as elevating experience over revelation. Timothy Lines in Systemic Religious Education (Lines, 1987; quoted in J. H. Westerhoff, III, 1987, 578) commented that Westerhoff had not yet constructed a careful, reasoned, systemic framework for religious education. Lines thought Westerhoff was temperamentally indisposed to doing such; Westerhoff at the time believed it was because he was too young. However, in a recent interview, he admits that it is unlikely that he will attempt such a magnum opus because he finds himself suspicious of systems (J. H. Westerhoff, III & Bramer, 2002).\n\nWesterhoff's practical theology starts with the nature and role of the church. The church is at once visible, historical, and human and yet hidden, transcendent, divine. While presently full of contradictions (e.g., holy yet with sinners, a unity yet divided), it is the church that has the faith and is the witness; our choice is whether or not to participate in it. It is our full participation that brings about our formation. That participation will create in us an historical consciousness, an ethical conscience, a compassionate heart, and a theological mind.\n\nWesterhoff wanted to broaden the field in every way. As to the person, he wanted to engage intuition and emotion and body, not just mind. As to method, he wanted to include liturgy, the arts, and service, not just instruction. (Thomas Groome states that among his most valuable insights are the role of liturgy, ritual, and symbol in Christian formation (Groome, 1980, 120).) As to faith, he wanted to see it developmentally and in a pilgrim motif, not just in any single sense or experience. He wanted church to be community-oriented and inter-generational, not individualistic or age-segmented. He wanted to include all dimensions of life, the political, social, and economic in Christian education, not just the religious. As such he was a post-modern voice at the end of the modern era, trying to link the future with the past, so that our churches would be places where our children would come to have faith and Christians would be formed."
