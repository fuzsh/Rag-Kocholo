        "text": "William Holmes McGuffey (born September 23, 1800, Washington county, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died May 4, 1873, Charlottesville, Virginia) was a U.S. educator who is remembered chiefly for his series of elementary school reading books popularly known as the McGuffey Readers.\n\nWith little formal education, McGuffey mastered the school arts and began teaching in the Ohio frontier schools at the age of 14. While teaching, he continued his own education intermittently—under private tutors, at Greersburg Academy, and as a student of philosophy and language at Washington (Pennsylvania) College. During his 10 years (from 1826) on the faculty of Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, McGuffey took great interest in public education and assisted the teachers of the local elementary schools. In his own home he established a model school for neighbourhood children.\n\nIn 1835 he contracted with the Cincinnati publishers Truman and Smith to compile a primer (a schoolbook offering basic lessons in many subjects), a spelling book, and four school readers—the first and second of which were published in 1836 and the third and fourth in 1837. A fifth appeared in 1844, and a sixth reader was added in 1879. The spelling book was published in 1846 by McGuffey’s brother Alexander Hamilton McGuffey. The readers were graded collections of didactic tales and excerpts from great books, reflecting McGuffey’s view that the proper education of young people required their introduction to a wide variety of topics and practical matters. They became standard texts in nearly all states, eclipsing all rival textbooks for half a century and reaching by 1925 a reputed total sale of more than 122 million copies."
