        "text": "Admission to Historic Roscoe Village is free. However, living history tours are approx. $13/person.\n\nOpen: Hours of operation and tours vary by season, type, and days of the week.\n\nLocation: (Map It) 600 North Whitewoman Street, Coshocton, Ohio\n\nPhone: 740-622-9310\n\nWeb: www.roscoevillage.com\n\nHistoric Roscoe Village is a restored 1800s canal town. Guests experience life during the Canal Era on the Canal Town Journey tour, during which they are guided through historical buildings staffed with costumed interpreters and enjoy hands-on activities at the Visitor Center. Afterward, they may stroll the lush gardens, take a horse-drawn canal boat ride, browse the numerous quaint shops, and enjoy casual family dining.\n\nExcerpt from a past edition of OhioTraveler\n\nRoscoe Village was a vibrant center of commerce along the legendary Ohio & Erie Canal. Forty years ago, it was brought back to life. Today, visitors can ride the canal just like their traveling counterparts back in the 1830s on their way to the streets of a vibrant canal town and all its dressings.\n\nThe famous port town is now known as Historic Roscoe Village. As its guests step onto the red brick ways, they are pulled in different directions. Some come just to relax in the beautiful gardens, some enjoy the living history journey back in time, others thrive on the original shops, and everyone marvels at the dining atmosphere and specialty dishes. Roscoe Village is a fully functional town that basks in its history yet entertains today’s interests. Special events fill the calendar, hands-on activities abound, and for those that want to get lost in relaxation and Yesteryear, there’s a variety of lodging accommodations.\n\nThroughout the town, you see trendy shoppers and costumed canal-era interpreters mingling along the streets and in the shops. Bicyclists frequent the streetscapes, stopping for ice cream or a shade tree—tour groups snake in and out of historic buildings for hands-on experiences. Roscoe Village has always had a charm that attracts children, seniors, and young women on a girls’ day out. There’s that much to see, do, and enjoy.\n\nThe journey begins for most at the visitors’ center. It is there that sleeves are rolled up, and work begins. All ages are welcome to try their hand at candle dipping, making rope, punching tin, and crafting other bygone creations. A guide in period dress provides insight into the forgotten lifestyles of the town during the era long past. They demonstrate their skill at the workstations and provide punchy presentations filled with information, wit, and personality.\n\nThrough the gardens and down the road past a few historical homes is a blacksmith’s shop. The rather large, rickety, old, red barn is dark inside, but the blacksmith’s tools and workstation are strangely illuminated perfectly by the window light. Let the pounding begin. The blacksmith on duty will hammer and bend iron into just about anything the mind can imagine.\n\nA few shops down, there’s a building where brooms are made. A demonstration shows the strange old machines and techniques for making one of the most used tools of the 1800s. The tour guide may have a little-known tale, such as coaxing a spectator to jump over the broomstick on the floor followed by a bellowing – “Now we’re married.” Details are explained on-site.\n\nAll aspects of life are explored, including the doctor’s office where an exam is given, another stop is made to make a bucket, and a little house with huge looms goes into action weaving. One of the more fun, interactive moments comes in the old schoolhouse where kids of all ages experience something they know – school. Don’t misbehave, or you’ll experience something unknown in today’s classrooms – a ruler on the knuckles!\n\nAround lunchtime and dinner, too, the streets lure the hungry into the historic brick-and-stone eateries and fine dining houses. One of which is The Warehouse Steak n Stein. This architectural gem is smack in the middle of the village and, in the 1830s, was the Mill Store and main docking point for the village along the canal. Its lower level is P.R. Nyes Lock Twenty-Seven, accented by the canal’s original stone walls.\n\nAn after-dinner glass of wine or cup of coffee can be had at Uncorked Wine & Coffee Bar. With over 200 different types of wine, it’s a full-service bar with hot and cold gourmet coffees. Many find a great place to relax: on the patio, in the shade, listening to jazz or blues music.\n\nWalking off a bite to eat is an easy thing to do in Roscoe Village. The charming shops are diverse and unique. Visitors often hit them all because it’s so convenient to walk from one to the next, marveling at the façade and gazing at the merchandise.\n\nThe wares made by the village blacksmith, broom squire, weaver, and woodworker are available at the Village Crafter’s Shop, located in the Visitor Center.\n\nThe Roscoe General Store is a throwback to historic community general stores. It offers everything from antiques to collectible bears and pottery to unusual toys for kids. Its candy bouquet temps with Lindt’s truffles, jelly beans, lollipops and gourmet chocolates.\n\nThe shopping list goes on. River Ridge Leather tans leather the old-fashioned way and hand stitches leather handbags, belts, harnesses, and more. Visitors are invited to see a live demonstration of the old art and the trade’s original tools dating back to the 1800s.\n\nOver at Garden Gate, visitors find novel gardening gifts, herbs, flowers, fountains, and other accessories. The House of G.A. Fisher is known for one-of-a-kind jewels and keepsakes, Lenox, clocks, and watches. Liberty House has a fashionable collection of purses, scarves, wraps, and whimsical styles of women’s clothing. Wildwood Music is happy to hook you up with a handmade stringed instrument like a dulcimer, mandolin, banjo, or guitar. And the Village Soap & Candle Shop has lotions, soaps and powders that are primitive and homespun.\n\nAlthough walking around town may be like a living history museum outdoors and in, there is an actual museum to boot – The Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum. This nationally accredited museum has incredible collections in several galleries, including the American Indian Gallery, Historical Ohio Gallery, Decorative Arts Gallery, Oriental Gallery, and a Special Exhibits Gallery that features a variety of collections throughout the year.\n\nRoscoe Village is never more alive than during its special events. Annual favorites include the October Apple Butter Stirrin’ Festival and the December annual Christmas Candlelighting.\n\nWhen the day winds down, Historic Roscoe Village offers beautifully landscaped gardens to take a load off and melt into the scene on a park bench. Perhaps the favorite leisure-time activity is a 45-minute canal boat ride tugged by horses walking along the towpath along the canal banks. An overnight stay may be better instead of packing the plentiful activities into one day. Various lodging options are nearby and include bed and breakfasts, inns, cabins, guest houses, motels, campgrounds, and a lodge."
