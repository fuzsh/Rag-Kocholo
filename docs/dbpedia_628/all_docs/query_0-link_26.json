        "text": "Selling a million copies a year for over 100 years, McGuffey’s Readers were the mainstay of public education in America.\n\nGenerations of school children read them, making them some of the most influential books of all time.\n\nThey were written by William McGuffey, who died MAY 4, 1873.\n\nIn the foreword of McGuffey’s Reader, 1836, he wrote:\n\n“The Christian religion is the religion of our country.\n\nFrom it are derived our prevalent notions of the character of God, the great moral governor of the universe.\n\nOn its doctrines are founded the peculiarities of our free institutions.”\n\nMcGuffey’s Eclectic Sixth Reader, 1907, included a quote from Lyman Beecher:\n\n“While most nations trace their origin to barbarians, the foundations of our nation were laid by civilized men, by Christians …\n\nThe memory of our fathers should be the watchword of liberty throughout the land;\n\nfor, imperfect as they were, the world before had not seen their like, nor will it soon, we fear, behold their like again.\n\nSuch models of moral excellence, such apostles of civil and religious liberty … To ridicule them is national suicide.”\n\nMcGuffey’s Eclectic First Reader included a lesson “Evening Prayer”:\n\n“At the close of the day, before you go to sleep, you should not fail to pray to God to keep you from sin and from harm …\n\nYou should thank him for all his good gifts; and learn, while young, to put your trust in Him; and the kind care of God will be with you.”\n\nMcHenry William Holmes McGuffey, in McGuffey’s Fifth Eclectic Reader (revised edition, 1879, Lesson XXIII), had the article “King Charles II and William Penn” by Mason L. Weems:\n\n“King Charles: How then will you get their lands?\n\nWilliam Penn: I mean to buy their lands of them.\n\nKing Charles: Buy their lands of them? Why, man, you have already bought them of me! …\n\nWilliam Penn: … How can I, who call myself a Christian, do what I should abhor even in the heathen? No … I will buy the right of the proper owners, even of the Indians themselves.\n\nBy doing this, I shall imitate God himself in his justice and mercy, and therby insure His blessing on my colony, if I should ever live to plant one in North America.”\n\nWilliam Holmes McGuffey’s Fifth Eclectic Reader (revised edition, 1879, Lesson LXV, pp. 200-204) memorialized John Peter Gabriel Muhlenburg in a poem titled “The Rising” written by Thomas Buchanan Read:\n\n“The pastor rose: the prayer was strong;\n\nThe psalm was warrior David’s song;\n\nThe text, a few short words of might,-\n\n“The Lord of Hosts shall arm the right!”\n\nHe spoke of wrongs too long endured,\n\nOf sacred rights to be secured;\n\nThen from his patriot tongue of flame\n\nThe startling words for Freedom came.\n\nThe stirring sentences he spake\n\nCompelled the heart to glow or quake,\n\nAnd, rising on his theme’s broad wing,\n\nAnd grasping in his nervous hand\n\nThe imaginary battle-brand,\n\nIn face of death he dared to fling\n\nDefiance to a tyrant king.”\n\nIn McGuffey’s 5th Eclectic Reader, 1879, is a lesson by William Ellery Channing, titled “Religion-The Only Basis of Society”:\n\n“How powerless conscience would become without the belief of a God …\n\nErase all thought and fear of God from a community, and selfishness and sensuality would absorb the whole man.\n\nAppetite, knowing no restraint … would trample in scorn on the restraints of human laws …\n\nMan would become … what the theory of atheism declares him to be — a companion for brutes.”\n\nWilliam Holmes McGuffey’s Fifth Eclectic Reader, 1879, included Lesson CXIII, “A Picture of Human Life” by Samuel Johnson:\n\n“Temptation succeeds temptation, and one compliance prepares us for another; we, in time, lose the happiness of innocence, and solace our disquiet with sensual gratifications.\n\nBy degrees we let fall the remembrance of our original intention, and quit the only adequate object of rational desire.\n\nWe entangle ourselves in business, immerse ourselves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinths of inconstancy till darkness of old age begins to invade us, and disease and anxiety obstruct our way.\n\nWe then look back upon our lives with horror, with sorrow, and with repentance; and wish, but too often vainly wish, that we had not forsaken the paths of virtue.”"
