        "text": "The Jackson House: A Symbol of Courage and Strategy\n\nThe Jackson House, now more than 100 years old, is a unique time capsule documenting one of the most momentous movements in U.S. history: the Selma to Montgomery marches, a sustained effort to ensure that all Americans would have the civil rights and voting rights promised to them.\n\nThe Jackson House is one of several important landmarks of Selma's role in the Long Civil Rights Movement. Dr. Sullivan Jackson and Mrs. Richie Jean Sherrod opened their home to close friend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his allies in Dallas County and nationally as a place to rest and strategize the path forward to secure voting rights for African Americans. Voting rights had already been a major focus for local movement leaders like Amelia Boynton, Rev. Dr. Frederick D. Reese, and the Dallas County Voters League, who had been organizing around the issue for decades. National groups like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and later King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference helped to bring international attention to Selma and the effort to register Black voters. From this home multiple aspects of the Selma Voting Rights Movement were planned, including the Selma to Montgomery March after the murder of Jimmie Lee Jackson in February 1965. Hundreds of people came through the home, including several Nobel Peace Prize winners, international dignitaries, media representatives, and activists and supporters of Civil Rights for all. This activism led to the passing of the Voting Rights Act in June 1965.\n\nMajor Points in The Long Civil Rights Movement up to 1965\n\n1954: Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, KS\n\n1955: Montgomery, AL Bus Boycott\n\n1957: Integration of Little Rock Central High School\n\n1960: Greensboro Four and the Woolworth Sit-ins\n\n1961: Freedom Rides throughout the South begin\n\n1963: Birmingham Campaign and the Children's Crusade\n\n1963: March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom\n\n1964: Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\nIn This House\n\nThe Jackson House and its contents are a remarkable fusion of the ordinary and the epic: A maple dining table — around which civil rights leaders, U.S. congressmen, and two Nobel Peace Prize winners broke bread and shared dreams. An upholstered armchair facing a black-and-white television — the chair where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. sat as he watched President Lyndon Johnson pledge to pass voting rights legislation. A bed with a pair of pajamas atop the covers — the bed and pajamas in which King spent many nights during the Selma to Montgomery marches.\n\nIn this house, people will learn how a committed group of idealists — some famous, some obscure — worked together to advance American principles and bring liberty, justice, and rights within the reach of all Americans. Their struggles, and their successes, are a powerful part of America's story.\n\nHere, behind a humble façade, world-changing ideas, plans, and actions charged the air with hope:\n\nIn this house Dr. Sullivan Jackson and his wife Richie Jean provided a safe haven for the nation's leading civil rights activists to strategize and plan.\n\nThis house is one of several places where the Selma movement was planned. This home was central to the Southern Christian Leadership Council/MLK planning.\n\nIn this house Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., worked and slept and strategized, along with key allies, for months before the Montgomery march.\n\nIn this house King frequently spoke by phone with President Lyndon Johnson about the need to expand and protect Black voting rights through national legislation.\n\nIn this house King and others watched, electrified, as President Johnson made a nationally televised address to Congress introducing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, proclaiming “We shall overcome.”\n\nIn this house, the only known meeting between the first and second Black men to receive the Nobel Peace Prize took place. Ralph Bunche and Dr. King.\n\nThis house was home to several generations of Black dentists, teachers, and professionals, who used their connections and success to build up the Black community of Selma.\n\nBringing the Jackson House to Greenfield Village\n\nIn 2023, The Henry Ford acquired the Jackson House from the home's owner, Jawana Jackson, who asked The Henry Ford to acquire, relocate, and elevate this historic house, giving it an enduring home in Greenfield Village. Jawana Jackson and The Henry Ford share a vision of preserving and sharing the legacy of this house — seeking to raise its profile and bring it to the attention of new audiences across the nation and around the world — and to share its inspiring stories, bringing the past forward and helping shape a brighter future for generations to come. Moving the Jackson House from Selma, Alabama, to Greenfield Village will be a multi-year effort for Henry Ford.\n\nIn Fall of 2023, the contents of the home were carefully removed for conservation, and the structure was taken apart and loaded onto trailers to make the monumental 1,060-mile move to Michigan.\n\nIn 2024, The Henry Ford team will begin placing the house in Greenfield Village which requires preparing a site, laying a new foundation, positioning and reassembling the house, replacing the roof, repairing floors and walls, connecting electrical and plumbing systems, installing central heating and air-conditioning, and adding fire protection and security systems.\n\nThe house will join the village's Porches & Parlors district. It will be located on Maple Lane between the George Washington Carver Memorial and the William Holmes McGuffey Birthplace.\n\nAs the home is relocated to its new permanent residence, The Henry Ford vows to create innovative programming, bringing this structure to life for in-person visitors and online learners around the world.
