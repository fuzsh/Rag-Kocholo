        "text": "Dear Alumni and Friends,\n\nAs a single parent pursuing a degree in secondary education, I am deeply honored to be a recipient of the 2024-2025 Anika Marie Hoybjerg Scholarship, the Paula Rankin Memorial Scholarship, and the Richard L & Donna J Sagness Scholarship for Excellence in Teaching.\n\nYour scholarships have not only provided me with financial relief but have also encouraged and motivated me to strive for excellence in my academic pursuits. I am immensely grateful for your belief in me and your investment in my education. Your support empowers me to make a profound difference in the lives of my future students, equipping them with the knowledge and skills they need to make informed financial choices and build a secure future.\n\nCurrently, I am pursuing a bachelor’s degree in secondary education with a concentration in social studies, aiming to teach American Government and Economics. I am on track to graduate early in May 2025 with honors. Post-graduation, I plan to teach in the Pocatello area while simultaneously pursuing a master’s degree at Idaho State University.\n\nMy passion for teaching American Government and Economics stems from a deep belief that these subjects are foundational to students' futures. Understanding the workings of our government and the principles of economics equips students with the knowledge to become informed and engaged citizens. In an ever-changing world, it is crucial for young people to grasp the significance of civic responsibility and economic literacy. By teaching these subjects, I aim to empower my students to make informed decisions, participate actively in our democracy, and navigate the complexities of the modern economy. Preparing students in these areas is not just about imparting knowledge, it's about shaping future leaders who will contribute positively to society and their communities.\n\nWords cannot adequately express the gratitude I feel for your generous support. Your investment in my education is an investment in my future, as well as the futures of countless others whose lives I hope to touch through my work as an educator. Your generosity has empowered me to dream bigger and reach higher, and for that, I will be forever grateful.\n\nWith sincere appreciation,\n\nShelly Nugent\n\nSecondary Education Student, May 2025"
