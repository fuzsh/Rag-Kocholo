        "text": "Category: Museums\n\nCabin Activities History at the Little House Wayside in Pepin WI\n\nTwo years ago, in 2022, a new event started at Pepin, Wisconsin, birthplace of Laura Ingalls Wilder and Mary Ingalls. It’s called “Home at Laura’s Place.” The Laura Ingalls Wilder Memorial Society, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Days Committee, and the Austin Tea Party Players have worked together to create a unique experience for visitors. One weekend a month re-enactors move into the cabin, lock, stock, and furniture to recreate the experience of a family with the cabin fully furnished and re-enactors demonstrating the arts of daily living in the 1870s. That has made me circle back around to the history of activities at the cabin.\n\nBackground\n\nFor many years the site of the Ingalls Home in Pepin wasn’t definite. The consensus by the late 1960s was that there was a depression that would have probably been the remains of the cabin right by what is now the Wayside driveway that is closer to town (the Wayside has two driveways). The road was altered during construction of the Wayside (a particular type of roadside park in Wisconsin) and the construction people who came in to create the Wayside (cutting down trees, creating driveways, parking lot, etc.) didn’t really care where the cabin was so they didn’t mark it when they were digging. The current cabin’s location is in the immediate area and there is a strong consensus that is where the Ingalls farmyard stood (house with barn/shed and other structures usually forming a square). To the best of my knowledge there hasn’t been any archeology work done on the site.\n\nReplica Cabin…Or Cabins\n\nThe original replica cabin was opened in 1977 to much fanfare. The cabin was fully furnished and was only open limited hours. (I couldn’t find anywhere that said if the furniture was only added when they knew they’d have hosts or if it was previously there at all except during the grand opening. There is a description including the furniture in the newsletter.) Workers from Green Thumb served as hosts for 1981-1986 years. (See note 1) But they didn’t feel safe way out in the country with no phone (only landlines then) if anyone came with bad intentions there wouldn’t be any backup. So they decided to move the furniture to the museum in downtown Pepin. It spent a year in the Depot Museum until they decided they wanted all their space for a transportation museum. (It is now part of the Pepin Museum in a different building on the town square.) Then they bought an antique shop that was closing down that had previously served as a sort of in town giftshop and that became the Laura museum. They decided to leave the unfurnished cabin unlocked and open all the time.\n\nThe original replica cabin had a door on the front and the back with ramps up to them. This was a mistake because it was also on the Great River Road and apparently someone decided it would be cool to drive motorcycles through the cabin as an unofficial part of their route. This caused a lot of damage that eventually led them into having to replace the replica cabin in 1992. In the new design of the cabin there was only one door even though that doesn’t match the description in the books.\n\nIt’s All in Quilts\n\nActivities started again at the cabin with a quilt show in 2005. The event corresponded to the town’s big Laura event – Laura Days – and was called “Quilt Show and Sew.” Jean Elefson (see Note 2) was a member of the Plum Creek Quilt Club and got them to volunteer to staff the house for the day. They also displayed quilts of club members. The event became a unique event at Laura Days with other and more people involved and quilt club members dropped out.\n\nThe two major projects of “Quilt Show and Sew” were Jean telling the story of Little House in the Big Woods through quilt squares she specifically made to tell the story. Her reading required audience interaction. (I took a turn telling the story a few times once.) The second project was helping each child sew a quilt square with the club supplying the cut fabric pieces and threads and needles. They had trouble getting enough help as the years went by. If you haven’t helped a bunch of kids who’ve never held a needle sew quilt squares – it’s quite labor intensive. In 2009 or 2010 Linda Starbuck, her mother Betty Sorenson, and Susan Goettel all started to drive up from Cedar Rapids, Iowa to volunteer in costume the whole weekend. They volunteered to do the sew quilt squares project for around 9 years. A few years after they started Julie Miller later came along. Miller drives up from Des Moines, Iowa. She chose not to help with the quilt squares and instead filled the cabin with a whole bunch of quilt related games and activities and her son who would demonstrate spinning tops. Eventually Julie took over the event organization from Jean as Jean needed more and more help. Today it’s called Wayside Cabin Activities and is a major event as part of Laura Days.\n\nNOTE 1: Green Thumb was a senior organization. It now calls itself Experience Works. It hires low-income seniors to give them employment. This isn’t exactly how it works, but picture them giving “grants” to good organizations that need help to hire older people. Again not exactly how it works, but that’s basically it. Also, take the years as approximate. I’m basing them off when the Green Thumb program was mentioned in the newsletters, but they were vague and I could easily be off a year or two at either end especially when it comes to the furniture part.\n\nNOTE 2: Jean Elefson was also the person who designed the Sunbonnet Sue like Laura specific quilt square design that was incredibly popular for a few years, even gracing one year’s Laura Days t-shirt.\n\nNOTE 3: Thank you to Kitty Latane, Linda Starbuck, and Julie Miller with help for exact dates I couldn’t find in the newsletters or my own records. They also added or confirmed a couple of facts and names.\n\nSarah S.

It’s just as well though. I just got another event added to the main list today. I was holding out because I thought I’d get something added for De Smet and I didn’t. There is a lot of Laura stuff going on this month.\n\nhttps://www.blogtalkradio.com/trundlebedtales/2024/07/12/july-2024-laura-ingalls-wilder-update\n\nPepin WI\n\nHome at Laura’s Place – 9:00 am to 5:00pm (2nd weekend, Saturday and Sunday)\n\nJuly 13-14, 2024\n\nVisit the Little House Wayside in Pepin, WI on these special weekends to see the cabin fully furnished and re-enactors demonstrating the arts of daily living in the 1870s. This is a cooperative activity of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Memorial Society, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Days Committee, and the Austin Tea Party Players.\n\nWalnut Grove MN\n\nWalnut Grove Pageant – This year continues a brand-new trilogy of plays in place of the Fragments of a Dream pageant. The first in the trilogy will be closest to traditional Fragments of a Dream so they did the 2nd one last year. This year it’s the third one, Dream Fulfilled.\n\nJuly 12-13, 2024\n\nJuly 19-20, 2024 (Reunion Weekend)\n\nJuly 26-27, 2024\n\nFamily Festival held in Walnut Grove City Park on pageant Saturdays, July 12, 19, and 26, 2024. The festival goes from 11:00 am to 6:00 pm Check the Walnut Grove website for full schedule and more details as it gets closer.\n\n2024 will be the 50th Anniversary of the Little House on the Prairie TV show (NBC). Walnut Grove is the homesite that has had the most to do with the TV show and has announced they will definitely be following up their 40th and 45th reunions with one this year. They are still rolling out information. If you plan on going look for where you want to stay now because they aren’t many spaces yet.\n\n50th Anniversary Cast Reunion Event – Walnut Grove, MN – July 19-21, 2024 (Scroll up to Walnut Grove section for more information)\n\nThis is not one of the repeating productions and so will be done differently. This is Paul Valenti’s report on Facebook in January: “You DO NOT need an advance ticket to attend the reunion events being held within Walnut Grove. Autograph/Meet & Greet tickets will be available when you arrive in Walnut Grove. It is also not expected that tickets for the evening pageants will sell out, there is always more room ‘on the hill’ for that particular event. I DO expect that there will be a brunch and a dinner event held that weekend for which you WILL need an advance ticket. So all that the fans should concern themselves with right now, in regards to the Walnut Grove Reunion, is finding lodging and transportation, everything else will be announced in plenty of time for those of you who are looking to participate in the various events taking place that weekend.”\n\nThat is good advice, except I would pre-buy the pageant tickets as soon as possible to get good seats. Some people prefer to sit on a blanket on the hill though so it’s up to you. The pageant will be the play put on by the townspeople every year and a pre- pageant Q and A session with the TV show cast. You do not have to pre-buy a ticket to the Autograph/Meet & Greet sessions. They will also have a photo with the cast on Sunday. This is my playlist of videos from when I attended their event in 2014. I’ve got it cued up to video 3 which is when I made it to Walnut Grove.\n\nFriday, July 19: Bruncheon ($70)\n\nSaturday, July 20: Luncheon ($70)\n\n-Your ticket includes a meal, a photo of you & others at your table with the Star, and a Gift Bag with exclusive items.\n\n-You are only allowed to attend one of these events. You cannot attend both the bruncheon and luncheon.\n\n-Additional information will be released by April 1st. Pre-sale date and times will be announced at that time.\n\nSunday, July 21 Photo Opportunity ($25)\n\n10:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. Community Center\n\nYou will have an opportunity to get a photograph with all of the Stars attending our reunion.

If you’ve subscribed or watched my videos I appreciate it. 🙂 I include videos I’ve done for other groups like Hoover. If you don’t spend a lot of time hanging out on YouTube channel pages, each channel page lists your most popular videos. I was looking for a particular video I was going to share and I noticed that 2 of the top 6 videos are my programs.\n\nOther Hoover Channels\n\nFor reasons I don’t understand, some of the programs that the Foundation supports that used to appear on the Hoover library channel now only appear on a separate YouTube channel which people don’t seem to find it. Here’s my video on there but check out the whole channel.\n\nPopular Video Links in Order\n\nSarah S.

No, not my period dresses, but my Laura Ingalls Wilder t-shirts that I wear for travel and Laura trips. I thought everyone might enjoy a closer look at them. So enjoy our monthly series where we look at a Laura shirt.\n\nShirt of the Month\n\nHere’s this month’s shirt:\n\nThis is a close-up of the design. I really love it. I think the flower are gorgeous and it’s super cool to have a representation of Laura’s actual signature on it. It’s not my favorite way to get an image on a t-shirt because it kind of makes it look slightly like you’re viewing it through an opaque scrim – as you can see in the photo.\n\nCan You Get It?\n\nGood news! This shirt is from my Walnut Grove trip in 2023. It’s still available through their online store.\n\nSarah S.

These were in colors then and they still look great! It also remends me of a prairie sunset which is a big part of a lot of Laura trips. I always love a brown Laura t-shirt anyway (even though apparently in general brown shirts don’t sell as well).

I finally decided that current information is probably best posted on a month-by-month basis so for current information search this site for the name of the month you are looking for and the word “event” (for example March 2024 Laura Ingalls Wilder Events).\n\nLet me know if I’m missing any. Most of these events are annual but check with the group hosting the event for exact dates for following years. There are a few events that no longer exist.\n\nI have enough information that I want to post what I have for 2024. The events I haven’t gotten dates for yet still have 2023 dates and are italicized. I’ll update them as I get more information.\n\nCHECK BACK! for changes throughout the year.

This time focused on the actresses who played Nellie Oleson in the pageant over the years. The interviews will be live, recorded, or read. Due to time constraints, they are interviewing the Nellie actresses who had been in the Walnut Grove Laura Ingalls Wilder Pageant for 5 years or more. They would still like to hear from any Nellie actress in the form of a short bio of what you are up to now and any thoughts on acting as Nellie Oleson in our production.\n\nFind-a-Grave Presentation – April 18, 2024\n\nBonnie Caldwell will present about grave hunting.

Walnut Grove is the homesite that has had the most to do with the TV show and has announced they will definitely be following up their 40th and 45th reunions with one this year. They are still rolling out information. If you plan on going look for where you want to stay now because they aren’t many spaces yet.\n\n50th Anniversary Cast Reunion Event – Walnut Grove, MN – July 19-21, 2024 (Scroll up to Walnut Grove section for more information)\n\nThis is not one of the repeating productions and so will be done differently. This is Paul Valenti’s report on Facebook in January: “You DO NOT need an advance ticket to attend the reunion events being held within Walnut Grove. Autograph/Meet & Greet tickets will be available when you arrive in Walnut Grove. It is also not expected that tickets for the evening pageants will sell out, there is always more room ‘on the hill’ for that particular event. I DO expect that there will be a brunch and a dinner event held that weekend for which you WILL need an advance ticket. So all that the fans should concern themselves with right now, in regards to the Walnut Grove Reunion, is finding lodging and transportation, everything else will be announced in plenty of time for those of you who are looking to participate in the various events taking place that weekend.”\n\nThat is good advice, except I would pre-buy the pageant tickets as soon as possible to get good seats. Some people prefer to sit on a blanket on the hill though so it’s up to you. The pageant will be the play put on by the townspeople every year and a pre- pageant Q and A session with the TV show cast. You do not have to pre-buy a ticket to the Autograph/Meet & Greet sessions. They will also have a photo with the cast on Sunday. This is my playlist of videos from when I attended their event in 2014. I’ve got it cued up to video 3 which is when I made it to Walnut Grove.\n\nFriday, July 19: Bruncheon ($70)\n\nSaturday, July 20: Luncheon ($70)\n\n-Your ticket includes a meal, a photo of you & others at your table with the Star, and a Gift Bag with exclusive items.\n\n-You are only allowed to attend one of these events. You cannot attend both the bruncheon and luncheon.\n\n-Additional information will be released by April 1st. Pre-sale date and times will be announced at that time.\n\nSunday, July 21 Photo Opportunity ($25)\n\n10:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. Community Center\n\nYou will have an opportunity to get a photograph with all of the Stars attending our reunion. The Stars will be seated and staged for you to join their photo. The photos will be taken on your personal device.\n\nHere is their current page about the reunion event it’s got all the information you’ll need.

This is Paul Valenti’s report on Facebook in January: “You DO NOT need an advance ticket to attend the reunion events being held within Walnut Grove. Autograph/Meet & Greet tickets will be available when you arrive in Walnut Grove. It is also not expected that tickets for the evening pageants will sell out, there is always more room “on the hill” for that particular event. I DO expect that there will be at least a brunch and a dinner event held that weekend for which you WILL need an advance ticket. So all that the fans should concern themselves with right now, in regards to the Walnut Grove Reunion, is finding lodging and transportation, everything else will be announced in plenty of time for those of you who are looking to participate in the various events taking place that weekend.”\n\nThat is good advice, except I would pre-buy the pageant tickets as soon as possible to get good seats. Some people prefer to sit on a blanket on the hill though so it’s up to you. The pageant will be the play put on by the townspeople every year and a pre- pageant Q and A session with the TV show cast. You do not have to pre-buy a ticket to the Autograph/Meet & Greet sessions. I expect that they will also have a photo with the cast on Sunday, but that’s based on their previous events, not anything I know from this year. This is my playlist of videos from when I attended their event in 2014. I’ve got it cued up to video 3 which is when I made it to Walnut Grove.\n\nAlison Arngrim (Nellie Oleson)\n\nDean Butler (Almanzo Wilder)\n\nCharlotte Stewart (Miss Beadle)\n\nPatrick Labyorteaux (Andy Garvey)\n\nWendi Lou Lee (Grace Ingalls)\n\nPamela Roylance (Sarah Carter)\n\nDavid Friedman (Jason Carter)\n\nJennifer Donati (Baby Rose Wilder)\n\n50th Anniversary Event – Carrie Days: A Celebration of the Life of Carrie Ingalls – Keystone, SD – July 26-28, 2024\n\nHave you ever wanted to “Picture Yourself on the Prairie?” You’ll get the chance to get your picture taken in front of 12 painted canvases of the Oleson Mercantile, the Little House and so much more.

I just love it and even though I’ve only made it once, I hope to go back again. I’ve always been sorry it doesn’t get as much press as Colonial Williamsburg, but as time goes on from when I was a kid you don’t hear nearly as much about Colonial Williamsburg either. (2026 will be the 250th anniversary of 1776 come on people, we were much readier than this for the 200th.)\n\nHenry Ford put together a collection of famous homes and businesses connected with famous people. Mostly people associated with the Midwest and the 19th century, but some other pieces of history from farther afield. I was thinking about it the other day and I thought, “hey, I’d like to see a trip video like people do for Disney for the Henry Ford. I wonder if anyone has done that?” Turns out they have. In fact I’ve watched Randomland for Disney related content before so I was glad when a search brought up a video from a trip he took there. It’s 37 minutes and still only the highlights, but it will give you the basic idea.\n\nEither he didn’t do as much prep for this trip or I don’t know enough about the other places he visits to catch things he misses because he definitely missed stuff here.\n\nThat Bubble Top car? That was the car Kennedy was shot it though he mentioned it was Kennedy’s car briefly in passing this is THE car from the assassination.\n\nDid Ford ask for the Presidential Limos back? Yes, that was one of Henry Ford’s plans. The Ford Motor Company provided the White House with cars for free on the condition that they come back to the company to be displayed in Ford’s museum. Ford’s ideas were either brilliant or kind of evil. This was definitely one of the brilliant ones. They only have them up as far as Reagan’s car. After that the secret service didn’t want them on display so the public could see the security features. I saw the thickness of the windows in Reagan’s car and some of the secret hand hold stuff, pretty impressive.\n\nThat Wright Model Flyer diorama? That’s a real life size recreation of the famous first flight photograph of the Wright brothers. It was not only famous it was on display right there by it.\n\nThe Thomas Edison complex? It wasn’t just built from some remnants. They moved not only buildings, but train car loads of dirt from where they originally stood to make sure they were also standing on the same ground as Edison used them. During Edison’s first tour of the completed recreation he got tired and needed to sit down. They brought him a chair and afterwards Ford had it nailed to the floor what a great story is that?\n\nI also think he missed some major themes that reflected what Ford’s plan was for the village. He was telling a sweeping story starting with his own family and the Firestones and go on from there. (The Firestone company was owned by his in-laws and exclusively provided the tires for Ford cars until a series of blow-outs caused extreme liabilities on Firestone so Ford cut them loose in 2001 ending an almost century long partnership.) It includes where Ford first worked on technology, the lunch wagon he ate at, the original Ford Motor Company (recreation), and the chance to ride a real Model T around the grounds.\n\nAnother thread was the story of technology with a heavy emphasis on Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and the agricultural leader Luther Burbank. He also had a thread on the arts including Robert Frost and Noah Webster. Then there are things that are majorly historic like the Abraham Lincoln things including one of the courthouses were Lincoln practiced law. Then the focus on everyday things like McGuffey’s one-room school.\n\nHe did mention the Disney connection, but he didn’t explain how similar the layout of both sites are including the steamboat that used to (and sadly doesn’t anymore) drive around a loop river. They really drove theirs though. We got a double ride because our captain was just being trained and she missed the stop.\n\nThere are a couple of more connections to add. Be sure to check out the touring plan podcast episode for the Henry Ford museum. Check out this post from when I talked about the Henry Ford museum and its Laura Ingalls Wilder connection. In this post scroll down to the part about the Mold-a-Rama.\n\nSarah S.

It’s a specific question, but since I’m interested in both historic foodways and one-room schools it’s a pretty good fit. I haven’t done the program in a while, BUT I have not one, but TWO possible bookings for it this fall. So I’m going to do another push if you know ANYONE who went to a one-room school please have them think about it and then fill out my form. If you know of a place where you can do handouts, please run them off and set out some forms. If you have social media accounts, PLEASE share out the link. – Very much appreciated.\n\nFill out the survey and share the link: http://tinyurl.com/1RmSurvey\n\nStart With Research\n\nI’ve collected information from parent and teacher magazines. (I’m also very distraught that there is a thesis from the 1910s I can’t lay my hands on.) I’ve also collected government publications talking about what you should have for school lunch.\n\nWhat People Really Took\n\nOne of my on-going projects has been a survey on what people actually ate. I’ve been collecting surveys for what people remember taking. So far I’ve got 468 responses with answers coming from everywhere between Canada to Louisiana. Answers on what they took ranged from hoe cakes to ketchup sandwiches to a hot dog kept warm in a Thermos with string tied around the natural casing knot to pull it out.\n\nPolitics\n\nI was surprised about how school lunch, or at least providing a hot school lunch, turned out to be a pretty political topic as it was an excuse given as one of the reasons to close one-room schools. Many creative efforts were made to fill the gap (until the Thermos made it unnecessary).\n\nI also found out that where you ate lunch turned out to be a problem, if you ate on your desk how did you get it or keep it clean? Plus, were students made to wash their hands? It’s lead me down a lot of interesting questions besides food.\n\nHandouts\n\nI’ve put together a presentation what I’ve got so far, but I’m still going to be collecting surveys. So if you went or taught in a one-room school or know someone who did, please fill out the survey and spread the word.\n\nHere is my latest update of my Handout 2018 about what I’ve learned so far. I’ll put out an updated handout including what I’ve learned since out this fall.\n\nSarah S.

Each year they do over the magic decorations and this year the theme is famous South Dakotans. Guess who made the list?\n\nWhat is a Corn Palace?\n\n“Crop Palaces” were a thing started in the 1880s. They were designed to celebrate a particular crop that was substantial in the area, as a tourist attraction, and to help convince more people to move to the area. They were built like a fairy tale palace or something an Imagineer would design for something short term.\n\nThe palaces were inspired by the St. Paul, Minnesota and Toronto, Canada ice palaces. The first built in 1887 in Sioux City, Iowa was a corn palace, but the craze took off like wild fire. According to The Forgotten Midwest: “By 1890, there was a bluegrass palace, a hay palace, Forest City’s flax palace, and a sugar beet palace in Grand Island, Nebraska, followed in the next years by a grain palace, broom palace, and more and more corn palaces.” My personal non-corn favorite is the coal palace in Ottumwa, Iowa.\n\nThese buildings were mostly constructed out of whatever they were celebrating on wooden scaffolding. They weren’t constructed to hold up well to the elements, they were fire hazards, rotted, and attracted all kinds of birds and animals to eat them. Even though they accomplished their goals about attracting more people and getting the names of the different cities out there they didn’t necessarily make back all the funds it took to construct them.\n\nWhen Sioux City gave up its palace, Mitchell, South Dakota stood up to create their own in 1892. The craze faded, but Mitchell didn’t give up. In 1919 they decided they were going to permanently keep their Corn Palace going. Their palace was different because it was designed to be a regular real building just with swoops, spires, and decorations using real corn on the inside and an an ever changing outside design. The inside space is used for tourists over the summer and the rest of the year it’s a gymnasium space used for sports and concerts. The current building was completed in 1921 with a remodel in the 1930s adding more of the original corn palace fantastical look to the building. Their website explains about the decorations that “The Palace is redecorated each year with naturally colored corn and other grains and native grasses to make it ‘the agricultural show-place of the world’. We currently use 12 different colors or shades of corn to decorate the Corn Palace: red, brown, black, blue, white, orange, calico, yellow and now we have green corn!”\n\nThere is even a book: Corn Palaces and Butter Queens: A History of Crop Art and Dairy Sculpture by Pamela H. Simpson.\n\nHas Laura Appeared on the Corn Palace Before?\n\nSoooo has Laura Ingalls Wilder appeared on this Midwestern icon before? Not quite. I had remembered reading about Laura being on there somewhere… so I reached out to the corn palace a few years back. They didn’t have any record of it.\n\nHowever, I kept looking and I discovered the Spring-Summer 1984 issue of Laura Ingalls Wilder Lore (Ed. William T. Anderson) had reported that a scene of the Surveyor’s House would appear during the 1983-1984 season complete with photo. The image showed the Surveyor’s House, but not any people so not Laura herself.\n\n2024 Designs\n\nThe World’s Only Corn Palace shared out the designs behind the coming year’s art on their Facebook page and gave me permission to post them here. There are 9 “scenes” spread around the building. The famous South Dakotans included in the designs are – the 1964 Olympic runner Billy Mills, Basketball coach Mike Miller, Basketball coach Becky Hammon, Wild Bill Hickcok, Medal of Honor winner and former South Dakota governor Joe Foss, Native American artist Oscar Howe, astronaut Charles Gemar, Bob Barker, and Laura Ingalls Wilder. You can see the Laura image design below is heavily borrowing from the Pioneer Girl cover.\n\nI hope you can get a trip arranged out to South Dakota next summer to see it.Work has started already getting the designs changed over for the 2024 year designs. “Jeff Hanson, the supervisor of decorating and maintenance for the palace, said a crew of 15 started in May by taking down the old corn and grain. They just finished putting up the new sour dock grain that borders the mural in July. Hanson said they will start to take down the actual corn in mid-September and the whole building should be done by Thanksgiving….He said over 400,000 people come through the Corn Palace every year.” (via Keloland)\n\nThe corn is specially grown by “Local farmer Brett Lowrie, from Mount Vernon [South Dakota], contracts to grow the colored corn for the Corn Palace. ‘It all started with Indian corn where kernels were hand-separated into like colors from the multicolored ears. Those kernels were then used to keep color purity,’ he explains. ‘Today, I plant 3 to 3.5 acres each of 10 colors. We also buy a green corn and use my yellow field corn. I plant 160-foot-wide strips of soybeans or grain sorghum in between to keep from cross-pollinating.’ Though Lowrie employs the same fertility and crop-protection program across all his corn acres, the colored corn is planted at a lower population of 12,000 plants per acre. It’s also harvested sooner — at about 40% moisture — to keep the ears from breaking when they are cut and nailed to a mural. Ears that are 8 or more inches long work best for the artwork. “I’m more concerned about ear size than I am about yield,” Lowrie says, “but in the end, I get anywhere from 60 to 100 bushels per acre.” (via Progressive Farmer)\n\nLearn More at These Websites\n\nWorld’s Only Corn Palace\n\nhttps://cornpalace.com\n\nCorn Cam of the Palace\n\nhttps://cornpalace.com/157/Corn-Cam\n\nTravel Information\n\nhttps://www.travelsouthdakota.com/trip-ideas/story/visit-worlds-only-corn-palace-mitchell-south-dakota\n\nhttps://www.keloland.com/keloland-com-original/mitchell-corn-palace-festival-celebrates-130-years\n\nhttps://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/news/article/2023/09/01/palace-prairie\n\nSarah S.
