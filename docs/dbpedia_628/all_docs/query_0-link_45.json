The village includes the birthplaces, homes, or workplaces of Ford, William Holmes McGuffey, Noah Webster, Luther Burbank, and Wilbur and Orville Wright. Also featured are Thomas A. Edison’s laboratory from Menlo Park, New Jersey, a Stephen Foster memorial, a courthouse where Abraham Lincoln practiced law, a steam-powered paddleboat and several locomotives, and representative English and early American homes, public buildings, and craft shops. The adjoining Henry Ford Museum houses a collection of Americana.\n\nGreenfield Village, which opened in 1933, consists of more than 80 historic structures on a site laid out like a small New England community-farmhouses, workshops, shops, mills, a railroad depot, and a bandstand. It is also divided into themed areas which include: crafts and trade, historic homes, transportation, pre-industrial farm life, and town buildings. The village also includes the restoration of moved homes and workplaces of famous innovators, like the Wright Brothers' Home and Cycle Shop and Ford's first automobile assembly plant. The centerpiece is the reconstruction of Edison's Menlo Park Laboratory Complex, originally in New Jersey, where he created some of his most famous inventions, such as the phonograph and the light bulb. The result is a unique history park."
