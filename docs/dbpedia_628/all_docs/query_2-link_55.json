The Latin text is Prima Latina. In American history, a reader and a study of states and capitals are included.\n\nThe Grammar Stage: Ages 8-11\n\nIn the Grammar Stage the foundation of Latin provides an academic vocabulary, a formal system of grammar, and critical thinking. The study of the cultures of Athens and Rome, as well as Biblical and Church history, provides a basis for the understanding of European and American history. Beginning in Grade 3, students study English grammar and classical composition. Ancient writers used a way of teaching composition known as progymnasmata, which taught a disciplined approach to communication, appealing to logic as well as the heart. The core education of a classical person was designed to produce “the good man speaking well”. Thus was the teaching of John Milton, William Shakespeare, and the founding fathers of our country.\n\nGrade 3:\n\nGrammar: Texts are LP Handwriting Level 3+, English Grammar Recitation Workbook (tied to Latina Christiana I), and Wordly Wise Book 3, EPS. Composition: Introduction to Composition teaches concepts of narration, outlining, summarizing, dictation, and copywork. Reading: Lippincott Basic Readers G and H are used, with workbooks. Original source literature with guides, includes these titles: Farmer Boy and Charlotte’s Web. In languages they study Latina Christiana I , First Start French I, and Viva el Espanol. The math text is Singapore Mathematics 3. My Pals are Here Science 3 coordinates as does Singapore Fact Fluency. The history subject for Grade 3 is Texas History with a number of texts and original source materials and some reference to American History.\n\nGrade 4:\n\nGrammar:\n\nTexts are LP Handwriting Level 3+, and English Grammar Recitation Workbook (tied to Latina Christians I).

Original Source Literature with guides includes The Cricket in Times Square, Homer Price, Dangerous Journey, and Blue Fairy Book. These are selected according to the needs of the class. The math text is Singapore Mathematics 4. My Pals are Here Science 4 coordinates as does Singapore Fact Fluency.\n\nIn American History they read The Story of the Thirteen Colonies, The Great Republic, and other topics.\n\nGrade 5 in the Saint Nicholas sequence is considered middle school. Curriculum information is available for Grades 5-8.\n\nParent Guide for Singapore Mathematics\n\nSingapore mathematics curriculum is organized in three categories: number sense, model drawing with word problems, and using mental math without paper and pencil. Like the Montessori method, Singapore Mathematics works from the concrete (objects) to pictoral (using pictures), and finally to the abstract (numbers represent symbolic values).\n\nThe Singapore mathematics program requires a secure foundation in number sense, measurement, and geometry for each level before beginning another. Therefore, students who are moving into this math program after grade three from another program take a placement test for correct placement. Descriptions of the levels are provided:\n\nGrade 3: Topics for Singapore Math 3 include more advanced work in the four arithmetic operations including long division, equivalent fractions plus adding and subtracting, measurement, graphs, time, and geometry. Two step word problems and mental calculation is included.\n\nGrade 4: Topics for Singapore Math 4 include all four functions with both fractions and decimals. Geometry includes computing degrees in angles and complex area and perimeter questions. Students work with advanced whole number concepts such as factors, multiples, and rounding off. Other topics are money, other geometric concepts, graphs, and averages. Two digit multipliers are introduced."
