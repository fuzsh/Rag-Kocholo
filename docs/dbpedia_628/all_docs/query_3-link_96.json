        "text": "History is not only the story of our past, but a key part of our present and future. We must learn from it, study it, and cherish the value of the admirable parts of it. Here are some underrated historical locations that are true gems in telling the story of our past.\n\nWilliam Howard Taft National Historic Site\n\nWith its charming yellow exterior and Greek Revival architecture, the birthplace and house of William Howard Taft, the 27th president of the United States and chief justice, overlooks Cincinnati atop Mount Auburn. Born in 1857, Taft enjoyed a vibrant childhood of athletics and academics at the house and remained there until after he graduated from Woodward High School and left for Yale University to pursue a career as a lawyer.\n\nThe William Howard Taft National Historic Site is located on 2038 Auburn Ave., Cincinnati, OH 45219. For information, call 513-684-3262 or visit www.nps.gov/wiho/index.htm.\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison Tomb\n\nThe grand tomb of William Henry Harrison, the ninth president of the United States, stands nestled in the hills of North Bend, Ohio. Ohio’s first president, known as Old Tippecanoe, neglected to wear his hat and overcoat at his inauguration in 1841, and he died 31 days into his term (officially of pneumonia, but some historians have suggested it was from tainted Washington, D.C. water, which causes typhoid fever). The North Bend resident was buried on Mount Nebo near his home. He is interred there along with his wife, Anna; his son, John Scott; and other members of his family.\n\nThe tomb and the surrounding wildlife can be visited at 41 Cliff Road, North Bend, OH 45052.

Having moved to Cincinnati in 1832, Harriet Beecher Stowe lived in the house while her father, Lyman Beecher, was president of Lane Seminary. While she lived in Cincinnati, she attended debates at Lane Seminary denouncing slavery and founded the prominent literary club, the Semi-Colon Club, which would greatly influence her groundbreaking novel, “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” an anti-slavery tale that is said to have “helped lay the groundwork for the Civil War.”\n\nThis historic location can be visited at 2950 Gilbert Ave., Cincinnati, OH 45206. For more information, call 513-751-0651 or visit www.stowehousecincy.org.\n\nBetts House\n\nBuilt in what would become Cincinnati’s West End in 1804, the Betts House is the oldest brick house in Ohio. A survivor of Cincinnati’s period of settlement, the house offers a unique opportunity to travel back in time and learn about the city’s past. Tours provide insight into the historical preservation, building technologies and architecture of the house.\n\nThis historic domicile can be found on 416 Clark St., Cincinnati, OH 45203.

His love of nature inspired him to create the Sons of Daniel Boone, a group for boys dedicated to preserving wildlife and treasuring nature’s beauty. His model was a crucial influence in the development of the Boy Scouts of America, which he headed for many years, designing the curriculum and uniforms for the group.\n\nRight outside of Cincinnati, the Daniel Carter Beard Boyhood Home can be found at 322 E.
