        "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio — Here’s a travel itinerary that comes with a reading list: more than 70 sites in Ohio with ties to the state’s most prominent writers and authors.\n\nThe Ohioana Library Association this month launched its new Ohio Literary Trail, with public locations throughout the state that celebrate Ohio’s rich history with words.\n\nAmong them:\n\n*The McGuffey Museum in Oxford, the former home of William Holmes McGuffey, whose McGuffey Readers revolutionized public education.\n\n* The House of Four Pillars, in Maumee, where Theodore Dreiser wrote his famous novel, “Sister Carrie,” in 1900.\n\n* The Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum in Columbus, which houses the world’s largest collection of materials related to cartoons and comics.\n\n“If a state can be proud of its football, baseball and basketball players, why not be proud of its poets and essayists?” asked David Weaver, executive director of the Ohioana Library Association, which was founded in 1929 to protect, preserve and promote the work of Ohio writers, artists and musicians.\n\nThe group has organized a map of Ohio literary sites before, but this is the first time the locations have been marketed as a trail and promoted as travel destinations.\n\nWeaver said the group is trying to capitalize on the recent popularity of both literary tourism and tourism trails. The Southern Literary Trail, for example, formed more than a decade ago, regularly draws thousands of visitors to its sites, which celebrate the lives and works of Tennessee Williams, William Faulkner, Flannery O’Connor and others.\n\n“People are sometimes are not aware of the fantastic authors that have come from Ohio,” said Weaver.\n\nWeaver acknowledged that the organization’s timing isn’t perfect – some of the sites on the trail have not yet reopened due to coronavirus concerns. The association started work on the trail early this year, before the pandemic, and targeted a summer launch.\n\n“We decided to stay with it,” he said. “We’ve gotten a great response. People are staying closer to home – this is a way to get out and find the treasures that are in your backyard.”\n\nWeaver said the trail will be updated regularly. Already, the organization is working with the Lorain Historical Society to add a site honoring Lorain native and celebrated author Toni Morrison, who passed away a year ago.\n\nThe trail also includes several book fairs and festivals, including the upcoming Ohioana Book Festival (being held virtually this year, Aug. 28-30).\n\nSaid Weaver, “Perhaps an author at a book festival today will one day be considered one of the great writers of their time – perhaps even have a site dedicated to them on the Ohio Literary Trail.”\n\nTop 5 literary sites in Ohio\n\nDavid Weaver, executive director of the Ohioana Library Association, put together this list of top 5 sites from the new Ohio Literary Trail, one from each region of the state:\n\nNorthwest Ohio: The Toledo Lucas County Public Library’s Nancy Drew exhibit. This is the 90th anniversary of the introduction of Nancy Drew, created by Toledo writer Mildred Wirt Benson, the first “Carolyn Keene.” She wrote 23 of the first 30 Drew mysteries. The exhibit is a treasure trove of Drew books and memorabilia.\n\nNortheast Ohio: Malabar Farm State Park in Lucas, the home of Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, screenwriter and conservationist Louis Bromfield. His 900-plus acre estate is a place to spend an entire day. His 32-room country mansion, called the Big House, is where Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall were married in 1945.\n\nCentral Ohio: The Wagnalls Memorial Library in Lithopolis. “Look that up in your Funk and Wagnalls!” was one of the classic lines from the old “Laugh-In” TV series, referring to the publishing company’s reference books. This library was founded by Adam Wagnalls’ daughter, Mabel, as a memorial to her parents. The library houses a collection of letters between Mabel and a number of early 20th century writers, most notably O. Henry.\n\nSouthwest Ohio: Paul Laurence Dunbar House in Dayton. The most influential Black poet of the early 20th century. “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” the title of Maya Angelou’s famous memoir, is actually a line from a Dunbar poem. And near Dunbar’s house is the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, dedicated to Dunbar’s two childhood friends, Orville and Wilbur Wright.\n\nSoutheast Ohio: National Road and Zane Grey Museum, Norwich. A dentist by training, Grey was the most popular writer of Western novels in American history — more than 100 films were made of his works. Visitors to the museum can also visit the nearby John and Annie Glenn Museum.\n\nRead more:\n\nDestination Cleveland launches Rediscover CLE campaign, aimed at getting residents to support local attractions"
