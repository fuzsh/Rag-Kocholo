The exhibition features approximately 110 works by such American artists as Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, George Catlin, Eastman Johnson, and Lilly Martin Spencer.\n\nOver the course of the 19th century, the United States grew from an infant republic to a powerful nation with a prominent place in world affairs. American ABC demonstrates how portrayals of the nation's youngest citizens took on an important symbolic role in the United States' long journey towards maturity, and it provides a window into the everyday life of the period-the world of families, children's pastimes, and the routines of the schoolhouse. By linking the forces of transformation-urbanization, war, technology, territorial expansion-to portrayals of childhood, American ABC will provide special insight into the development of the United States.\n\nAmerican ABC encompasses six themes that address the most important issues in 19th-century America. The Country Boy discusses the agrarian ideals of American democracy and the definition of manhood, and Daughters of Liberty examines the roles assigned to the nation's future wives and mothers. Children of Bondage and The Ragamuffin deal with the issues of slavery and immigration, while the situation of Native Americans is the subject of The Papoose. Concluding the themes, The New Scholar considers contemporary attitudes toward education and the idea that a system of public schools could unite the many peoples of America.\n\nUsing paintings, prints, photographs, and books selected from major museums, libraries, archives, and private collections throughout the United States, American ABC explores the connection between images of the American child and the democratic ideals of the young United States. The exhibition includes a wide variety of illustrated children's books from the 19th century, such as Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Noah Webster's Elementary Spelling Book, McGuffey's readers, and colorful ABC primers, as well as other materials such as needlework, children's crockery, and illustrated magazines.\n\nThe exhibition's companion book, written by Claire Perry, Curator of American Art at the Cantor Arts Center, and published by Yale University Press, expands on the themes of the exhibition and presents new research on the social and economic significance of childhood in 19th-century America. The companion book will be available in the Museum Store.\n\nThe exhibition was organized by the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University. The exhibition, accompanying catalogue, and related programs are made possible by the generosity of Carmen Christensen with additional support from Peter and Helen Bing, the Hohbach Family Fund, and Cantor Arts Center members. This exhibition has been generously sponsored by UnumProvident.\n\nText panels for the exhibition\n\nAmericans of the 19th century were keenly aware of their role as the heirs of the Founding Fathers and the guardians of a new nation \"of the people, by the people, and for the people.\" Guided by the advice of the Revolutionary generation, they believed that the health of the republic depended on the creation of a virtuous citizenry ready to assume the responsibilities of self-government. As political leaders, editors, novelists, ministers, and educators debated ways to enlighten and uplift the body politic, the nurture and education of children became a dominant theme in public life. Children came to be seen as the key to the nation's longevity and the guarantee that the United States' democratic institutions would endure. In an environment charged with both optimism and anxiety about the future, images of children in paintings, prints, advertisements, schoolbook illustrations, and photographs helped to provide citizens with a sense of the underlying stability of their society. Many of these pictures showed idealized children in rural settings, confirming that the agrarian class Thomas Jefferson had called the bedrock of the nation was renewing itself in the nation's abundant open spaces. Other portrayals openly confronted the most contentious issues of the day-urban poverty, racial inequality, immigration, industrialization-and reduced them to reassuringly Lilliputian proportions.\n\nThough most portrayals of children emanated from the northeastern United States, these images had broad appeal across the nation. Audiences with varying class and regional alignments enjoyed Currier and Ives prints of roly poly toddlers and playful farm boys. As advances in printing technology increased the availability of publications for and about children, Americans also eagerly bought ABC books and primers published by Noah Webster and William McGuffey, and child care manuals by recognized authorities. This community of shared interests centering on the child transcended the partisan, geographic, and economic barriers that impeded the growth of a sense of national identity. During the course of the century, the culture of childhood became an important part of the processes through which the fragmented assembly of states that existed before the Civil War became the singular United States- a nation with an increasingly centralized government that defined itself by the motto: \"E Pluribus Unum.\"\n\nThe Country Boy\n\nThe United States of the 19th century was a young nation and its citizens were also youthful. In 1830, one third of the population was less than ten years old and the median age was 16. Eager to define who they were as a people and to show that their nation was different-and better-than the nations of the Old World, Young America asserted its identity through patriotic ballads, novels about frontier adventures, political satires, and pictures that described typical citizens of the republic.\n\nThe Country Boy was one of the new national types to emerge in the imagery of this period and a figure that became a commonplace subject for fine paintings exhibited in New York galleries as well as prints that decorated middle-class parlors. Forthright and full of energy, the Country Boy embodied the simple virtues that citizens associated with their fledgling democracy. American audiences applauded the Country Boy's independent spirit, which often manifested itself as a healthy disregard for the authority of teachers, parents, and clergymen. Over the course of the century, the Country Boy came to represent not only the nation's political and social freedoms, but also the unpretentiousness and flair for invention that Americans believed was the essence of the national character.\n\nThat the safety of the republic depends on the virtue of the people is a truth that cannot be too assiduously taught; and that it is the business of the young, as well as the old, to help on the cause of goodness, cannot be too strongly impressed.\n\n- Catherine M. Sedgewick, The Boy of Mount Rhigi, 1849\n\nBegin with the infant in his cradle. Let the first word he lisps be WASHINGTON.\n\n- Noah Webster, An American Selection of Lessons in Reading and Speaking, 1789\n\nJoey was a country boy, Father's help and mother's joy: In the morning he rose early,足足 That's what made his hair so curly; Early went to bed at night, 足足 That's what made his eyes so bright; Ruddy as a red-cheeked apple; Playful as his pony Dapple; Even the nature of the rose Wasn't quite as sweet as Joe's.\n\n- The Nursery: A Monthly Magazine for Youngest Readers, 1878\n\nDaughters of Liberty\n\nDuring the 19th century, the belief in \"separate spheres\" of the genders in behavior, work, and creative expression shaped the boundaries of American society. Males were identified with exploration, inventiveness, and enterprise, while females were thought to be naturally inclined toward patience, kindness, thrift, and other virtues that revolved around the home. Praised by political leaders and ministers as creatures of superior moral influence, females were appointed the guardians of the nation's democracy. They were encouraged to act as moral guides for their brothers and husbands and, though they did not have the right to vote themselves, were charged with the nurture and education of future voters.\n\nWhile citizens mapped out the separate territories of males and females, pictures of American girls became a pervasive presence on magazine covers, billboards, soap labels, calling cards, and in newspapers and art galleries. Depictions of girlhood generally adhered to a narrow range of subjects: gathering flowers and fruits, sewing, cooking, playing with pets, minding siblings, and other tasks that represented the routines of domestic life-as well as the parameters of the female sphere. For male citizens who were busy directing their energies to the work of state-building, images of little embroiderers, flower girls, and pie-makers promised that westward expansion and free enterprise would go hand-in-hand with well managed households and delicious dinners served on time.\n\nIn this land of precarious fortunes, every girl should know how to be useful.\n\n- Lydia Maria Child, The Girl's Own Book, 1834\n\nChildren of Bondage\n\nPictures of African-American children were widely popular during the 19th century, and they were viewed and purchased by audiences representing a broad range of regional and political backgrounds. Drawing on an extensive repertory of stereotypes built up since colonial times, portrayals of African-American children were also inspired by depictions in contemporary literature and minstrel theater. By the 1850s, when debates over slavery reached a fever pitch across the land, the image of the black child had become a charged subject that aroused deep emotions in Americans from both the North and the South. Abolitionist tracts included images and stories about infants on the auction block, while pro-slavery authors published books with illustrations of contented slave youngsters playing on plantations. Even artists hoping to steer clear of racial controversies created paintings of African-American children and exhibited them in the elite galleries of New York and Philadelphia -- as if the innocence of those portrayed might somehow transcend the ugliness of the struggle that culminated with the Civil War.\n\nI was seldom whipped by my old master, and suffered little from anything else than hunger and cold. I suffered much from hunger, but much more from cold. In hottest summer and coldest winter, I was kept almost naked-no shoes, no stockings, no jacket, no trousers, nothing on but a coarse tow linen shirt, reaching only to my knees . . . . Our food was coarse corn meal called mush. It was put into a large wooden tray or trough, and set down on the ground . . . He that ate fastest got most; he that was strongest secured the best place; and few left the trough satisfied.\n\n- Frederick Douglass, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave, 1845\n\nI is the Infant, from the arms Of its fond mother torn And, at public auction, sold With horses, cows, and corn.. . . .\n\nQ is the Quarter, where the slave On coarsest food is fed, And where, with toil and sorrow worn, He seeks his wretched bed.\n\n- The Anti-Slavery Alphabet, 1847\n\nRagamuffin\n\nIn the second quarter of the 19th century, a new theme emerged in American art, one that had appeared only rarely in paintings, books, and journals before that time: the ragamuffin. Where images of country boys, little ladies, and slave children dealt with beliefs about democracy, males and females, and race that had been prevalent since the days of the Revolution, the street child was a novel subject. For most Americans, the realization that a mass of impoverished \"street arabs\" roved the nation's cities was shocking and incomprehensible. Citizens at mid-century were astonished by published statistics that revealed the exponential growth of American cities-and troubled by the fact that much of it was driven by skyrocketing rates of immigration. More than 1.5 million European immigrants arrived in the United States between 1840 and 1850. During the 1850s an additional 2.5 million immigrants came to the United States, and most settled in the large cities of the northeast.\n\nWhen depictions of street children first began to creep into visual and literary media in the 1830s and 1840s, civic authorities in Boston and New York had already been busy for decades trying to deal with large-scale homelessness in their cities. Americans grew accustomed to seeing little ragamuffins, both on city streets and in pictures displayed in homes and art galleries. For audiences disturbed by newspaper accounts documenting the growing problem of poverty in America's cities, pictures of vagrant children represented a way to fathom the troublesome issue of scarcity in a land of abundance.\n\nThe Little Chimney Sweep\n\nSome time ago there was a little chimney sweep, who had to sweep a chimney in the house of a very rich lady. The little sweep went up at the kitchen fireplace, and came down in the chamber. When he got into the chamber he found himself all alone. He stopped a moment to look around at the rich furniture. As he looked on the top of the table, he saw an elegant gold watch, with gold seals to it. He had never seen anything so beautiful before, and he took it into his hands. As he listened to hear it tick, it began to play sweet music. He then thought, if it only belonged to him, how rich he would be. He thought he might hide it in his blanket.\n\nMore About the Little Chimney Sweep\n\nWhile the little sweep boy was thinking about taking the lady's gold watch, he felt cold all over, and trembled with fear. \"No,\" said he, \"I cannot take this watch. I would rather be a sweep and always be poor, than steal.\" He laid the watch down, and crept up the chimney.\n\n- William H. McGuffey, McGuffey's Eclectic First Reader, 1836\n\nThe Papoose\n\nUntil the final decades of the 19th century, Native American children were an uncommon subject in the artworks and popular images that were disseminated around the country. Even artists who specialized in Indian themes gave native children only the most cursory treatment in their works. The prevalent notion that America's original inhabitants were a people doomed to extinction by progress may have discouraged portrayals of a thriving new generation of Native Americans. At the same time, the remoteness of many native settlements made it difficult for artists to observe tribal family life.\n\nThe publicity surrounding the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which mandated that all Native Americans living east of the Mississippi move west of the Mississippi, heightened artists' interest in documenting all aspects of Indian society. During the 1830s and 1840s, a group of artist-explorers, including George Catlin and John Mix Stanley, traveled extensively to make visual accounts of tribes pushed westward by development. Still, artists' representations of domestic scenes that included children were usually outnumbered by pictures of buffalo hunts and tribal warfare, reflecting the taste of eastern audiences for such subjects.\n\nAfter the completion of the transcontinental railroad line in 1869, Indian children began to appear more frequently in paintings, magazine illustrations, advertisements, and documentary photographs. The papoose in particular emerged as an icon of peaceful tribal life -- and a preview of the exotic sights that travelers could expect to see on tourist excursions to the west. At the same time, artists' new awareness of Indian youth was linked to the American public's call for changes in the federal government's Indian policies during the 1880s and 1890s. Much of the newly enacted reform legislation of this period centered on the welfare of Native American children.\n\nDo you know that the very place where Boston now stands, was once covered with woods, and that in those woods lived many Indians? Did you ever see an Indian?. . . The Indians go nearly naked, except in winter. Their skin is not white like ours, but reddish, or the color of copper. When I was a boy, there were a great many that lived at no great distance from Boston. They lived in little huts or houses called Wigwams. . . The Indians had no chairs to sit in, nor tables to eat from. They had no books to read, and had no churches or meeting houses. In winter, they sometimes wore skins of bears and deer, which they shot with bows and arrows, or with guns.\n\n- Samuel Griswold Goodrich. The Tales of Peter Parley, About America, 1827.\n\nThe New Scholar\n\nPictures of children in school, and the lessons in textbooks read by schoolchildren across the United States, embodied American ideas about the privileges and responsibilities of a democratic government. Paintings and lithographs of school subjects tended to celebrate childhood freedoms, reveling in anarchic classrooms, happy truants, and the joys of recess frolics. Schoolbooks, on the other hand, were dominated by themes of regularity, industry, and obedience. The divide between artworks' rowdy egalitarianism and the reverence for tradition expressed in educational publications was a symptom of the nation's longstanding ambivalence about schooling. Americans often associated education with the high-falutin' habits of the upper crust. Many \"self-made\" citizens wore their lack of cultivation as a patriotic emblem -- proof of their contempt for Old Word pomp and circumstance.\n\nNevertheless, during the first half of the century, Americans across the country came to embrace the idea of public education and to believe that \"common\" schooling was the birthright of the youngest generation. They praised education as a great common denominator, one that had the power to bring into harmony the disparate voices of America's far-flung populace. At the same time, many citizens remained unconvinced that schools could fulfill their lofty mission of uniting the nation. They were also wary of new school-related taxes and the new powers the government had assumed to organize a nationwide school system. As debates about how and when children should be educated flared up, Americans were forced to ponder deeply the meaning of democracy -- and to back up their convictions with their votes and their pocketbooks.\n\nArtists responded to the American public as it grappled with the subject of public education, offering audiences a peek inside the classrooms and schoolyards where country boys and girls, immigrant children, former slaves, and young tribespeople were busy learning arithmetic and reciting their ABCs. Their works helped to show that little scholars across the country were earning their right to claim the privileges of citizenship, and gave substance to the Founding Fathers' cherished vision of a secure future for the nation.\n\nIt cannot be doubted that in the United States the instruction of the people powerfully contributes to the support of the democratic republic.\n\n- Alexis De Tocqueville, Democracy in America, 1838\n\nChecklist"
