I finally decided that current information is probably best posted on a month-by-month basis so for current information search this site for the name of the month you are looking for and the word “event” (for example March 2024 Laura Ingalls Wilder Events).\n\nLet me know if I’m missing any. Most of these events are annual but check with the group hosting the event for exact dates for following years. There are a few events that no longer exist.\n\nI have enough information that I want to post what I have for 2024. The events I haven’t gotten dates for yet still have 2023 dates and are italicized. I’ll update them as I get more information.\n\nCHECK BACK! for changes throughout the year. I make changes and updates on the page (click here) and NOT on THIS POST as I find out more.\n\nListen to our Looking Ahead Episode\n\nhttps://www.blogtalkradio.com/trundlebedtales/2024/05/05/ep-151-looking-ahead-at-laura-ingalls-wilder-fandom-2024\n\nOr find it wherever you get your podcasts under Trundlebed Tales.\n\nPepin WI\n\nLaura Ingalls Wilder’s 157th birthday is February 7, 2024.

This time focused on the actresses who played Nellie Oleson in the pageant over the years. The interviews will be live, recorded, or read. Due to time constraints, they are interviewing the Nellie actresses who had been in the Walnut Grove Laura Ingalls Wilder Pageant for 5 years or more. They would still like to hear from any Nellie actress in the form of a short bio of what you are up to now and any thoughts on acting as Nellie Oleson in our production.\n\nFind-a-Grave Presentation – April 18, 2024\n\nBonnie Caldwell will present about grave hunting.

The festival goes from 11:00 am to 6:00 pm Check the Walnut Grove website for full schedule and more details as it gets closer.\n\n2024 will be the 50th Anniversary of the Little House on the Prairie TV show (NBC). Walnut Grove is the homesite that has had the most to do with the TV show and has announced they will definitely be following up their 40th and 45th reunions with one this year. They are still rolling out information. If you plan on going look for where you want to stay now because they aren’t many spaces yet.\n\n50th Anniversary Cast Reunion Event – Walnut Grove, MN – July 19-21, 2024 (Scroll up to Walnut Grove section for more information)\n\nThis is not one of the repeating productions and so will be done differently. This is Paul Valenti’s report on Facebook in January: “You DO NOT need an advance ticket to attend the reunion events being held within Walnut Grove. Autograph/Meet & Greet tickets will be available when you arrive in Walnut Grove. It is also not expected that tickets for the evening pageants will sell out, there is always more room ‘on the hill’ for that particular event. I DO expect that there will be a brunch and a dinner event held that weekend for which you WILL need an advance ticket. So all that the fans should concern themselves with right now, in regards to the Walnut Grove Reunion, is finding lodging and transportation, everything else will be announced in plenty of time for those of you who are looking to participate in the various events taking place that weekend.”\n\nThat is good advice, except I would pre-buy the pageant tickets as soon as possible to get good seats.

Find out more about their appearence.\n\nMelissa Sue Anderson (Mary Ingalls)\n\nMatthew Labyorteaux (Albert Ingalls)\n\nAlison Arngrim (Nasty Nellie)\n\nMelissa Gilbert (Laura Ingalls)\n\nKaren Grassle (Caroline Ingalls)\n\nLeslie Landon Matthews (Miss Eva Plum aka Michael Landon’s daughter)\n\nWendi Lou Lee (Grace Ingalls)\n\n50th Anniversary Event – Walnut Grove, MN – July 19-21, 2024 (Scroll up to Walnut Grove section for more information)\n\nThis is not one of the repeating productions and so will be done differently. This is Paul Valenti’s report on Facebook in January: “You DO NOT need an advance ticket to attend the reunion events being held within Walnut Grove. Autograph/Meet & Greet tickets will be available when you arrive in Walnut Grove. It is also not expected that tickets for the evening pageants will sell out, there is always more room “on the hill” for that particular event. I DO expect that there will be at least a brunch and a dinner event held that weekend for which you WILL need an advance ticket. So all that the fans should concern themselves with right now, in regards to the Walnut Grove Reunion, is finding lodging and transportation, everything else will be announced in plenty of time for those of you who are looking to participate in the various events taking place that weekend.”\n\nThat is good advice, except I would pre-buy the pageant tickets as soon as possible to get good seats. Some people prefer to sit on a blanket on the hill though so it’s up to you. The pageant will be the play put on by the townspeople every year and a pre- pageant Q and A session with the TV show cast. You do not have to pre-buy a ticket to the Autograph/Meet & Greet sessions. I expect that they will also have a photo with the cast on Sunday, but that’s based on their previous events, not anything I know from this year. This is my playlist of videos from when I attended their event in 2014. I’ve got it cued up to video 3 which is when I made it to Walnut Grove.\n\nAlison Arngrim (Nellie Oleson)\n\nDean Butler (Almanzo Wilder)\n\nCharlotte Stewart (Miss Beadle)\n\nPatrick Labyorteaux (Andy Garvey)\n\nWendi Lou Lee (Grace Ingalls)\n\nPamela Roylance (Sarah Carter)\n\nDavid Friedman (Jason Carter)\n\nJennifer Donati (Baby Rose Wilder)\n\n50th Anniversary Event – Carrie Days: A Celebration of the Life of Carrie Ingalls – Keystone, SD – July 26-28, 2024\n\nHave you ever wanted to “Picture Yourself on the Prairie?” You’ll get the chance to get your picture taken in front of 12 painted canvases of the Oleson Mercantile, the Little House and so much more.

There were so many that got added as the year went along I wanted to go ahead and save them as a snapshot now instead of just at the beginning of the year and watch for me to post what I have for 2024 sometime early next year. For now I’m adding them on to the end of 2023.\n\n2023 Laura Ingalls Wilder Events Around the Country\n\nIt’s not always easy to find out about what’s going on for Laura Ingalls Wilder events around the country. I finally decided that current information is probably best posted on a month by month basis so for current information search this site for the name of the month you are looking for and the word event (for example April May 2023 Laura Ingalls Wilder Events).\n\nLet me know if I’m missing any. Most of these events are annual, but check with the group hosting the event for exact dates for following years.\n\nThis year is bound to be an odd year for homesite events. There will still be some recovery issues and there is still likely to be rearranging of activities and some still might not be available.\n\nCHECK BACK! for changes throughout the year. I make changes and updates on this page and not on the post as I find out more.\n\nListen to our Looking Ahead Episode\n\nhttps://www.blogtalkradio.com/trundlebedtales/2023/06/01/ep-139-looking-ahead-at-laura-ingalls-wilder-fandom-this-year-2023\n\nOr find it wherever you get your podcasts under Trundlebed Tales.\n\nPepin WI\n\nLaura Ingalls Wilder’s 156th birthday is Feb. 7, 2023.

The story began in Pioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography (2014), edited by Pamela Smith Hill, which made the original text of Wilder’s 1930 autobiography available to readers for the first time. But that was only the start of Wilder’s journey as an American novelist. Wilder next handed her text over to her daughter, novelist and journalist Rose Wilder Lane, for editing. The second volume in the series, Pioneer Girl: The Revised Texts (2021), edited by Nancy Tystad Koupal and other Pioneer Girl Project editors, presented Lane’s three revisions of the Pioneer Girl manuscript, allowing readers to explore the working relationship between Lane and Wilder.\n\nhttps://www.sdhsf.org/events/event-form/june-15-2023-history-talks-presentation-registration/84694/tickets\n\nJune 22, 2023 1:00pm MDT – Spearfish SD\n\nAuthor Signing and Book Release Event for Pioneer Girl: From Fact to Fiction\n\nHigh Plains Western Heritage Center – Spearfish SD\n\nMissouri Cherry Blossom Festival – Marshfield, Missouri\n\nLittle House events\n\nApril 27, 2023\n\n9 AM – 5 PM – Laura Ingalls Wilder Home and Museum in Mansfield, MO presents a traveling exhibit on the life of Laura Ingalls Wilder- Webster County Library (Free Admission)\n\n9 AM- Judy Wampler will speak about “Laura Ingalls Wilder from Wisconsin to Missouri” using her quilt collection and her book- Marshfield Assembly of God\n\n11 AM- Cindy Wilson (author) will speak about her book, “The Beautiful Snow: The Ingalls Family, the Railroads, and the Hard Winter of 1880-81”- Book signing will follow the presentation in the church foyer- Marshfield Assembly of God\n\n4:35 PM- “Legends of Television and Screen” Panel featuring actors and actresses from several classic television shows and cinema classics- Lauren Chapin (Kitten, Father Knows Best), Gayla Peevey (Singer, I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas), Wendi Lou Lee (Baby Grace, Little House on the Prairie), Kim Lankford (Knots Landing), Alison Arngrim (Nellie Oleson, Little House on the Prairie), Karolyn Grimes (Zuzu, It’s a Wonderful Life) and others- Marshfield Assembly of God\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\n8 AM- Laura Ingalls Wilder Home and Museum hosts, “Nellie’s Breakfast”-Alison Arngrim (Nellie Oleson, Little House on the Prairie) will interview Hersha Parady (Alice Garvey, Little House on the Prairie)- Benefiting the Laura Ingalls Wilder Children’s Literature Festival- Sponsored by Federal Protection – Marshfield Assembly of God Fellowship Hall- Tickets are $25 per person, 2023 Cherry Blossom Festival Events | Eventbrite or call 808-345-4975.\n\n9 AM – 5 PM- Laura Ingalls Wilder Home and Museum in Mansfield, MO presents a traveling exhibit on the life of Laura Ingalls Wilder- Webster County Library (Free Admission)\n\n2 PM- Annual Missouri Walk of Fame Ceremony- Honoring six famous Missourians with stars on the historic Walk of Fame.
