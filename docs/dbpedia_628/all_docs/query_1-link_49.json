        "text": "Pre-Civil War\n\nAbout 1790\n\n1 James Monroe, the United States’ fifth president, builds his law office and home at what would become the Monroe Hill Complex, atop Monroe Hill. In 1814, John Perry, a builder working on UVA and Monticello, buys the property and enlarges the house. Perry sells the property to be held in trust as the future site of UVA in 1817. In 1848, UVA adds two one-story dormitory wings.\n\nCirca 1800\n\n2 Farmer John Alphin builds Sunnyside. The now-Gothic Revival structure is updated and expanded in 1858, modeled after Washington Irving’s home of the same name in Tarrytown, New York. In 1963, UVA purchases the property, which is now part of North Grounds and is usually used for faculty and staff housing.\n\nOct. 6, 1817\n\n3 With James Monroe, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson in attendance, the first cornerstone for what was called Central College is laid for a building that will eventually become Pavilion VII on West Lawn.\n\n1818–1824\n\n4 Workers—some who are enslaved and some who are not—build the Academical Village. In June 1818, workers start construction of Pavilion III and some Lawn rooms. By October 1819, construction is underway on seven pavilions and about 36 Lawn rooms. As work continues on the Lawn and Ranges, the Board of Visitors approves the construction of the Rotunda in April 1821.\n\nIn October 1822, construction on all buildings except the Rotunda is finished. The Rotunda’s dome is covered in summer 1824. By November 1824, while construction is underway on the Rotunda, Jefferson and Madison hold an event there for the Marquis de Lafayette.\n\n1819–20\n\n5 Off Montebello Circle, Montebello is originally built as a private home by Perry, who also built UVA and Monticello and enlarged Monroe Hill. UVA purchases the building in 1963; it’s used as faculty housing.\n\n1825\n\nUVA opens on March 7.\n\n1825\n\n6 Construction starts on the Anatomical Theatre, which Jefferson designed, deeming it essential for medical classes. The building across the street from the West Range is in use by early 1827. In 1886 it sustains damage in a fire and is later renovated; in 1924 it is condemned.\n\n1826\n\nThomas Jefferson dies on July 4.\n\n7 Around this time, the Crackerbox is built behind the East Range and used as a kitchen and quarters for enslaved workers. It later serves as a garage and, in 1960, was turned into its current use: a dorm for two students.\n\n1828\n\n8 The Rotunda is complete. Construction totals $60,000. Steps leading to the Rotunda’s south portico are constructed four years later.\n\n1828\n\n9 The first person is buried in the University Cemetery at Alderman and McCormick roads: Dr. Henry William Tucker, a professor’s brother, who was among the first to die in a typhoid epidemic that year. The cemetery’s plots sell out by 1966, and a columbarium is approved in 1987.\n\n1829\n\n10 The Mews opens as kitchen quarters for enslaved people who worked in Pavilion III. The building is expanded in 1881 and the 1930s. It’s now used as apartments.\n\n1831–1856\n\n11 McGuffey Cottage, just off the Lawn, is built at some point during this time span. It is originally used by enslaved laborers for professors living in Pavilion IX.\n\n1835\n\n12 The Morea House is built by John Patten Emmet, appointed by Jefferson as UVA’s first natural history professor. UVA purchases the property in 1960, and it is now part of the International Residential College.\n\n1840\n\n13 What’s left of the dormitories built on Carr’s Hill, the two-story Carr’s Hill Cottage, provides space for an office and guest cottage.\n\n1851 to 1854\n\nA four-story wing and a basement with room for classrooms, labs and an auditorium are attached to the Rotunda’s north side.\n\n1855\n\n14 Dawson’s Row begins to take shape with the opening of a parsonage, Dawson’s Row #4. It’s now home to UVA’s Office of African-American Affairs. Dawson’s Row #3, now home to the Luther Porter Jackson Black Cultural Center, was likely used by enslaved laborers, though its construction date isn’t known. In 1859, UVA builds six dormitories, called Dawson’s Row, opening a seventh a few years later. At some point between 1891 and 1907—records are unclear—Dawson’s Row #2, now the W.E.B. Du Bois Tutorial Center, opens. The Dawson’s Row dorms are torn down between 1931 and 1953.\n\n1856\n\n15 The house that will later be named Faulkner House, after author William Faulkner, is built. UVA purchases the house in 1963 and uses it as a guest house. Starting in 1975 it serves as the Miller Center’s headquarters.\n\n1856\n\n16 Buckingham Palace, a two-room cottage, is built on Carr’s Hill as a private home for two students. UVA purchases the Carr’s Hill property in 1867 and has used it as a student residence, for Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and, most recently, as a guesthouse for Carr’s Hill visitors.\n\n1857–1858\n\nUVA’s first indoor gym, 17 Squibb Gymnasium (now called Levering Hall), and an 18 infirmary (now named Varsity Hall), are under construction near East Lawn. The infirmary, built at a cost of $7,500, is the first built for this specific purpose on a U.S. campus.\n\nPost-Civil War–1900\n\n1858 to 1867\n\nFor nine years during and after the Civil War, no large-scale construction takes place.\n\n1868\n\n19 Miller Hall is built as a chemistry lab. It later serves UVA’s admissions department.\n\n1877\n\n20 When it opens, the Lewis Brooks Museum of Natural Science is one of the first natural history museums in the United States. By the late 1940s the building, while still called Brooks Museum, is used as classroom and faculty office space. In 1973 the Board of Visitors renames the building Brooks Hall. It is home to UVA’s anthropology department.\n\n1883\n\n21 The Alden House is built atop Observatory Hill. By the 1930s, it hosts official UVA receptions and dinners. In the 1960s, it’s turned into housing for faculty. From the late 1970s to 2002, it’s a home for astronomy graduate students. It’s now been vacant for more than two decades.\n\n1884\n\n22 The Leander McCormick Observatory, then the second-largest telescope in the world and built for $64,000, is dedicated in 1885 on Thomas Jefferson’s birthday, April 13, a few months after it was completed.\n\n1888\n\n23 A student-run dining hall is built on Carr’s Hill; students work as cooks and waiters. Part of the building, now called Leake Cottage, remains. UVA uses the space to prepare for events at Carr’s Hill.\n\n1890\n\n24 With funding from the local YMCA and Ladies Chapel Aid Society, the University Chapel opens. In 1897 the Drama Club donates a 1,200-pound bronze bell. Various renovation projects are launched in 2006, 2021 and 2023.\n\n1892\n\n25 The Dispensary, which includes examination rooms and a lecture hall for the medical school, opens on University Avenue. It is torn down in 1916.\n\n1893\n\n26 UVA builds another gymnasium: Fayerweather Hall. It’s located next to Madison Bowl, which opened not long before it and was operated by a local YMCA chapter, the United States’ first university chapter. When Memorial Gymnasium opens in 1924, Fayerweather becomes home to the School of Architecture. The building, now home to UVA’s art department, gets a full renovation that’s completed in 2006.\n\nOct. 27, 1895\n\nBad wiring sparks a fire that destroys the Rotunda and its annex.\n\n1896\n\nUVA hires the architectural firm McKim, Mead and White to design the new Rotunda and three buildings at the southern end of the Lawn, which will eventually be named Rouss, Cocke and Old Cabell halls.\n\n1898\n\nThe rebuilt and redesigned Rotunda is dedicated. Architect Stanford White’s design includes two floors, instead of Jefferson’s three, a larger Dome Room, and east and west wings on the building’s north side.\n\n1898\n\n27 The South Lawn takes shape. Rouss, Cabell (now Old Cabell) and Cocke halls open. The project, historians have speculated, may have been, in part, to shield the Lawn from a nearby African American community called Canada.\n\n1899\n\n28 The “first modern residential hall” at UVA, Randall Hall, designed by Library of Congress architect Paul Pelz, opens with 43 rooms. It’s now home primarily to UVA’s sociology department.\n\n1900–WWII\n\n1901\n\n29 University Hospital opens on Jefferson’s birthday, April 13, with capacity for 150 beds. Architect Paul Pelz designed the building with growth in mind, and the complex has grown rapidly ever since, with wings opening in 1905, 1907, 1916, 1924, 1928 and 1941.\n\n1902\n\n30 The first games are played at Lambeth Field, once a dairy farm.\n\n1902\n\n31 Saint Anthony Hall’s chapter house opens on Chancellor Street. It’s the first house built as a fraternity at UVA. More houses are to follow in the Rugby Road area, primarily in the 1910s and 1920s.\n\n1905\n\n32 The local YMCA chapter builds Madison Hall as its home.\n\n1908\n\n33 After a years-long lobbying effort by UVA’s first president, Edwin Alderman, to build a dining hall to boost fellowship opportunities on Grounds, Garrett Hall opens to serve both students and faculty. First called the Refectory and then The Commons, the building replaces a mess hall on Carr’s Hill and would undergo updates in 1959, 1983 and 2011. It’s now home to UVA’s Batten School.\n\n1909\n\n34 After two years of construction, Carr’s Hill, home to UVA’s presidents, is complete. A carriage house, now used for storage, had been finished the year before.\n\n1911\n\n35 UVA’s law school moves from the Rotunda to Minor Hall with the building’s opening.\n\n1913\n\n36 The Lambeth Colonnades, an 8,000-seat stadium, opens for its first season, replacing the field’s wooden grandstand.\n\n1914\n\n37 Peabody Hall opens as a home for the new education school. A fire shuts it down in 1973; it reopens in 1982. In 2001, a 13-month full renovation wraps up. The building is now home to UVA’s admissions department.\n\n1917\n\n38 Cobb Hall is built and used by UVA’s chemistry department. The building is currently under construction as part of a project to expand space for the commerce school.\n\n1921\n\n39 McIntire Amphitheatre, which costs $85,000 to build, opens and marks the University’s 1919 centennial a couple of years late, postponed by World War I. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson (Law 1880) attends. In 1967 the amphitheater’s grassy lawn is paved for a parking lot but is returned to grass less than a decade later. A gravel walkway that provides a border between the seats and the amphitheater’s lawn, part of the original design, returns in 2010.\n\n1924\n\n40 Memorial Gymnasium opens, replacing Fayerweather Hall, which was just one-third its size. It becomes the home to boxing, the University’s biggest sport at one time, as well as home court for UVA basketball until University Hall opens in 1965. The building served as a memorial for the 80 students and alumni who died during World War I. The gym’s original floor is replaced in 1992; in 2005 its gym and locker rooms are updated. The building is undergoing massive exterior and interior renovations currently, which started around 2017.\n\n1929\n\n41 Faced with crowding as more students enroll after World War I, UVA opens 12 dormitories for first-years just west of Monroe Hill. The buildings, or “portals,” are named after 19th century professors. In 1986, the dorms are renovated and turned into Monroe Hill Residential College, now Brown College, UVA’s first residential college.\n\n1930\n\n42 Monroe Hall opens, originally for UVA’s economics and commerce programs. It houses UVA’s graduate business school from 1955 to 1975, and its undergraduate business school from 1975 to 2008. In 1987 the building gets more space and a new façade.\n\n1931\n\n43 Scott Stadium, among the oldest college football stadiums in the United States, opens and is dedicated during the Oct. 15, 1931, game against Virginia Military Institute. It replaces Lambeth Field. The stadium has undergone numerous updates since then. Once designed for 22,000, it can now hold more than 60,000.\n\n1931\n\n44 McKim Hall, a nursing school dorm, opens, serving 53 students—UVA’s largest nursing class at the time—and the program’s first full-time faculty member.\n\n1932\n\n45 Clark Hall opens as a new home for UVA’s law school, which had moved from Pavilion III to the Rotunda Annex in 1853 and then to Minor Hall in 1911. Space is added a handful of times, including in 1950, 1952, 1961 and 2003.\n\n1935\n\n46 Thornton Hall opens, becoming home to UVA’s engineering school 100 years after the school launched in 1836. It’s the first academic building west of Emmet Street. Additions are built twice in the 1950s and some changes are made in the 2010s.\n\n47 The Bayly Building opens as a home for UVA’s art collection. Originally named the University of Virginia Art Museum, it becomes the Fralin Museum of Art in 2012. Between 1939 and 1946 it closes because of World War II; an annex is added a short while after it reopens. Starting in 1962 it is used for academic purposes because of space shortages, and then is extensively renovated and reopens as an art museum in 1974. In 2021 the museum reopens after a 17-month closure for renovations, including a new roof, and because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n1936\n\n48 The Alumni Association purchases the former Kappa Phi House on Emmet Street and moves there from Pavilion VII. The building, Alumni Hall, is expanded in 1983 and 1991.\n\n1938\n\n49 UVA’s library gets a much bigger home, moving from the Rotunda to the new Alderman Library. The “new stacks” are added in 1967. In 2020 the library closes for a massive $160 million renovation and expansion that includes replacing 130,000 square feet of space and renovating 100,000 square feet of the existing building. It is scheduled to reopen in 2024.\n\n1939\n\n50 Mary Stuart Cocke Goodwin, whose late husband was a UVA professor of surgery, builds a home on the south side of Sprigg Lane. UVA buys the home in 1964, and it becomes Bemiss House, headquarters for the University of Virginia Press in 1968. In 1991 it is expanded.\n\nThe Anatomical Theatre is demolished. It is the only Jefferson-designed building to be torn down.\n\nWWII–1970\n\n1942\n\n51 Maury Hall, renamed Warner Hall in 2022, opens as a home base for UVA’s Naval ROTC program. In 1953 Naval ROTC expands into Halsey Hall, now home to UVA’s statistics department, next door.\n\nWorld War II forces a slowdown on construction projects as funding sources dry up.\n\n1948\n\n52 University Gardens, graduate student housing off Emmet Street, opens. The complex includes 60 apartments across eight buildings. In September 2022, the BOV’s Buildings and Grounds Committee votes to demolish them.\n\n1951\n\n53 Built between 1946 and 1951, UVA’s “Old Dorms” along McCormick Road open. Between 2018 and 2020, each Old Dorm gets a reboot to include new laundry rooms, kitchens and air-conditioning.\n\n1952\n\n54 Mary Munford Hall opens. It’s the first residence hall for women.\n\n55 New Cabell Hall, with a construction cost of $1.6 million, opens to add classroom space and academic offices for a growing student body. A four-year project is finished to update the space in 2014.\n\n1954\n\n56 The Physics Building opens; in 1980 and 1993 it is expanded. In September 2022, the BOV’s Buildings and Grounds Committee approves the design for a future classroom renovation.\n\n1958\n\n57 Newcomb Hall opens as UVA’s student activities center. In 1997 a $16.4 million renovation project that forced some student groups to move out of Newcomb is complete. In 2013, a three-year, $33 million renovation wraps up and includes upgrades to the dining hall, theater and ballroom.\n\n1960\n\n58 UVA opens a nuclear reactor atop Observatory Hill for research as part of its nuclear engineering program. It closes in 1998.\n\n59 Olsson Hall opens. In 2018, the building’s top floor is transformed into the engineering school’s Link Lab.\n\n1963\n\n60 Gilmer Hall opens as the home for biology and psychology at UVA. In 1987 an expansion makes room for more neuroscience research labs. In 2022 a full renovation completely remakes the building, allowing in more light and better space for research.\n\n1964 to 1966\n\n61 Suite-style dorms, quickly nicknamed “New Dorms,” emerge off Alderman Road. First come Courtenay, Dunglison, Fitzhugh, Dunnington, Tuttle, Lile and Maupin houses in 1964. Balz, Dobie, Watson and Webb follow in 1966. [61a]Starting in 2006, the New Dorms are torn down and replaced with seven residence halls. Courtenay, Dunglison and Fitzhugh are the only original New Dorms to remain.\n\n1965\n\n62 The Chemistry Building opens next to Gilmer Hall, then just 2 years old. In 2020 a massive renovation modernizes research labs and updates the building.\n\n63 University Hall opens as the new home for UVA basketball, moving from Mem Gym. The final basketball games are played in the building in 2006 when the teams move to John Paul Jones Arena.\n\n1970–2000\n\n1970\n\n64 Campbell Hall opens as the home for UVA’s architecture program, moving from Fayerweather Hall. The building is renovated and expanded in 2008, including the addition of a new south wing and east tower.\n\n65 As UVA begins to admit more women, Gwathmey House opens.\n\n1971\n\n66 Lannigan Field opens as the home of UVA’s track and field teams. In 2012, a $14 million renovation replaces the track and makes other improvements.\n\n1972\n\n67 Bice House, a nine-story dormitory, opens. A project to update and modernize the space finishes in 2004.\n\n68 McLeod Hall, a nursing education building, and Jordan Hall, a medical education building, open. In 2016, Jordan Hall, named after onetime medical school dean Harvey Jordan, who was involved in the eugenics movement, is renamed Pinn Hall after Dr. Vivian Pinn (Med ’67), the only woman and minority member of her medical school class. The building was undergoing a renovation at the time to add 25 percent more usable space.\n\n1973\n\n69 Ruffner Hall opens for the education school. The building gets a major renovation in 2013 and 2014 and is renamed Ridley Hall in 2020, after Walter N. Ridley (Educ ’53), UVA’s first Black student to earn a doctoral degree.\n\n1974–1975\n\n70 North Grounds takes shape. UVA’s law school moves from Clark Hall to its new building, eventually named Henry Malcolm Withers Hall, now Brown Hall, in 1974. Darden, which had been in Monroe Hall, and the Judge Advocate General School follow to North Grounds in 1975. In the 1990s North Grounds undergoes another series of moves. The Darden campus is built in 1992. The David A. Harrison III Law Grounds opens in 1997.\n\n1974\n\n71 The Drama Department Building, with an attached theater, opens off Culbreth Road.\n\n72 Lambeth Field Apartments open, offering a new housing option for students.\n\n1976\n\nA years-long effort to return the Rotunda to its original design is completed in time for the country’s bicentennial.
