F. 1 Made in U. S. A. DEDICATED TO HENRY FORD lifelong devotee and patron of his boyhood Alma Mater, the McGuffey Readers AND TO JOHN HORST founder of the Columbus McGuffey Society and ardent believer in the McGuffey cult Foreivord So GREAT have been the services of the McGufFey Readers that it seems most fitting that full authentic information concerning their author and the books should be made available to the millions of American citizens who had through these readers their first intro- duction to the world's best literature and to a dependable moral and ethical code. That the impact of these books was wide and deep in the lives of the people who read them as children and youths and in those who lived in the milieu of the social processes which these books set into operation, is fully attested by the organization of many societies and clubs, by the appearance of numerous magazine articles, historical references, and by the establishment of McGuffey museums. Henry Ford commemorated his introduction to the great world of morals and literature in the McGuffey Readers by reprinting the six readers of 1857. He generously distributed sets of these reprints to the McGuffey lovers throughout the United States. Collec- tions of the McGuffey Readers are sought for by libraries and museums. Very complete sets of these books from the earliest editions may be found in the McGuffey Museum at Miami University, in the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society at Ohio State University, Colum- bus, Ohio, in the Ford Museum, Dearborn, Michigan, and in a few private collections. The author has attempted in this book to exhibit the so- cial status of the times and the character of the population viii FOREWORD of the Ohio country which created a demand for books of McGufTey tone and timbre; he has tried to illustrate the growing commercial and publishing interests which carried along the success of this enterprise with other enterprises of the period in the Middle West. Further- more, it is the purpose of this book to reveal as far as possible the character of William Holmes McGuffey as a distinguished humanitarian, heedless of monetary or mercenary possibilities, centered only in services which he could render his day and generation through the appeal of his pen and his voice and his extraordinary literary sense. We have wished to pay tribute to the influence of the McGuffey Readers in the far-flung frontiers in the march of western development, even beyond the Rockies. Contents PAGE 1.

I thought McGuffey was a book.\" After a famous meeting of the Ohio Society in New York City in which roll call responses were made by so many quotations from the McGuffey Readers, someone of the later generation, evidently an Ohioan by adoption rather than by birth, asked, in the parlance of \"English as she's spoke,\" who was this \"guy McGuffey.\" Neither book nor guy, sprung this scion of a worthy Scotch line, but as one sent to deliver the childhood of America from the stygian night of fear and horror cre- ated by stories of the public cremation of Christian mar- tyrs, by Rhymes from Wigglesworth, the Day of Doom, Indian massacres of their forefathers, and to create for it a ren- aissance in childhood's world, a world of familiar ani- mals, familiar playthings, companions. The desirable cheap lands of the Ohio Company and the John Cleves Symmes Company had long been dis- posed of by 1800 and the Congress became anxious to increase settlement upon the unsold homesteads. May 10, 1800, Congress passed the Harrison Law reducing the minimum number of acres a pioneer might purchase in the Ohio Country from 640 to 320, at five dollars an acre with a down payment of fifty cents an acre. Lumber and land for a home and farm could be had for $160 and 2 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS five years to pay the entire obligation. The story ran through Pennsylvania and the East as swiftly as news of victory, and every farmer's son said to his young wife or to his betrothed, \"Will you go with me?\" In every home of limited circumstances and in the embryo homes young men and women were filled with dreams of the \"Promised Land.\" The treaty of Green- ville, signed by Anthony Wayne and representatives of twelve tribes of Indians, established peace in the Ohio country. No sooner had the western part of Pennsylvania been cleared of organized Indian massacres and depredations than the pioneering urge and the pressure from competi- tion of newly arrived German farmers in York County led to a trans-Pennsylvania migration to the unoccupied lands of the Westmoreland section of the state, and to the banks of the picturesque Shenango. To the fertile lands between the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers came be- tween 1770 and 1790 hundreds of Scotch and Scotch- Irish families. Among the historic families that settled in the southwest portion of Washington County near Good Intent and West Alexander occur the names of McCuloch, Mcintosh, Burns, Davidson, David, Bu- chanan, Frazier, Wetzel, Zane, Roney, Holmes, and the \"Scotch-Billy\" McGuffey. The Westmoreland folk were almost \"kith and kin\" to the McGuffeys as almost all were Scotch, Scotch-Irish, and English, and most were of the genuine Presbyterian faith to which William Holmes McGuffey later gave long and distinguished service. Young Alexander McGuffey, father of William Holmes McGuffey, born in Scotland, was in the height of young manhood when the family arrived in Washington County, Pennsylvania. He soon established himself as the \"crack THE McGUFFEYS ARRIVE IN OHIO 3 shot\" among his fellow hunters. Thrilled by the adven- tures of the Wetzels, Kenton, and Boone, he enlisted in service against the Indians across the Ohio River. He and his friend, Duncan McArthur, later governor of Ohio, engaged with Samuel Brady as spies. To make sure of his men, Brady selected five men, among whom were McGuffey and McArthur, for special services as spies in the frontier Indian wars and gave them the severe tests necessary of woodsmen and spies, running foot races, hunting game, shooting mark. The older spies were dressed as Indians and sent into the woods to give full test of the cunning and fighting qualities of the young neophytes. After due frontier try-outs only McGuffey and McArthur were chosen. The complete story of his service is told in a letter of Daniel Drake to his grandson, Charles, a son of Alexander H. McGuffey, brother of Wil- liam Holmes McGuffey, from which a few excerpts follow: \"During the first summer, they watched for Indians, and one time, they and two others, with Brady as their leader, made an expedition, nearly to the Muskingum River in this state [Ohio]. It was their business, if they met with a small body of Indians to fight them; if with a larger number, to return to the station on Grave Creek or to Wheeling, and notify the people, that Indians were coming, that the men generally might turn out and op- pose them. Through the next winter, there was no ne- cessity for looking out for Indians, as they were not ac- customed to invade the white settlements in that season, so your grandfather spent it in hunting deer and bear, in the country around Wheeling. The flesh of the animals was used as food and their skins were sold for money. This was repeated the next two winters.\" Once in a skirmish with a superior force of Indians, McGuffey retreated and was pursued in his flight in full 4 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS speed up a hill. When he reached the top, the Indians were close upon his heels. He turned and drew up his empty gun as to fire; whereupon the three Indians dropped into the grass, giving McGufFey chance to es- cape. After the war was over, one of these Indians met McGufFey in Wheeling and as he shook hands with him said, \"I was one of the three who chased you up the hill.\" Then McGuffey challenged the Indian to a foot race and won the race. Shortly before St. Clair's disastrous defeat, McGufFey, Brady, and McArthur were sent as spies to Cold Spring near Sandusky City. As they lay concealed in a swamp they saw Indians passing in great numbers to attack St. Clair's army. They decided St. Clair must have this information. They lay in concealment during the day and traveled in silence by night. One night they traveled forty-one miles — everywhere were Indian camps and In- dian warriors. Unable to shoot game they used the two small accompanying dogs as food. To avoid breaking the silence of their movements the dogs were choked. The men reached St. Clair with their information, but the egotistical governor profited as little by this informa- tion as he had done from Washington's last words to him, \"Beware of a surprise.\" \"In the summer McGufFey, McArthur, and George Sutherland were sent over the Ohio River opposite Wheeling, to the distance of seven or eight miles, as spies upon the Indians. They were walking on a little path, which led to a deer-lick which the Indians often fre- quented. Between sundown and dark, they came upon an Indian's cap, which had been thrown there to cause any white man who might pass that way to stop and pick it up, when the Indians, lying in ambush, would shoot him. The spies understood the stratagem, and House in which William Holmes McGuffey was born, as restored by Henry Ford and moved to Greenfield Village. Greersburg Academy Facing page 4 THE McGUFFEYS ARRIVE IN OHIO 5 when your grandfather, who happened to be foremost saw it, he gave it a kick without halting, and cried out, 'Indians!' As he uttered the word seven or eight Indians fired at once, and one of the balls smashed his powder horn and tore his clothes, but did not wound him. The spies then retreated to Wheeling, and the Indians did not follow them.\" After six or eight years of a trio of activities, farming, hunting, and spying upon and fighting Indians, our young pioneer sought a settled life, and at Christmas in 1797 married the winsome Anna Holmes, who was to become an inspiration to all American mothers burning with the ambition to see their talented sons born in \"chill penury\" given an opportunity of college training. The ceremonies of the wedding according to family tradition were not wanting in festivities. \"No end of wild turkey\" and other game meats furnished by the hunting prowess of the groom served in multiple choices from rare unwritten recipes, together with corresponding abundance and variety of cereals, fruits, and native sweets, and drinks were served on the groaning tables both at the wedding dinner of the bride and at the \"in- fare\" feast of the groom. Anna Holmes was the daughter of Henry Holmes, whose wife was Jane Roney, sister to Hercules Roney, noted defender of the Scotch-Irish pioneers from Indian atrocities. The Holmes' farm was one of the largest farms in the settlement, containing over four hundred acres, and the Holmes' house, a log cabin, was one of the largest houses in the community, a two-apartment cabin with the real Scotch but and ben. Though following American architecture, these famous rooms were on two floors. It was here doubtless that Alexander McGuffey's first three children were born — Jane, William Holmes, and 6 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS Henry. The first was named in honor of the grand- mother. The names look quite Holmesy, William alone coming from the McGufFey side. ^ The whole of the Connecticut Western Reserve in Ohio, three million acres, was purchased by the Con- necticut Land Company at forty cents per acre. It was organized under one county, Trumbull, and was popu- larly called New Connecticut. The company advertised cheap lands in all the East. Her agents were traveling everywhere displaying specimens of the rich soil and other advantages of the Mahoning Valley and \"New Connecticut.\" Daniel Coit had bought of the company a whole township in northern tier of the former Trumbull County, which later became Coitsville Township, Ma- honing County. Specimens of this soil were shown all over Washington County, Pennsylvania, and to this township of solid forest Alexander McGuffey was lured in 1802. He purchased about one hundred and sixty- five acres from Card and Elizabeth Green for five hun- dred dollars, less than the government price under the Harrison Act. His purchase was doubtless on the long time land contract plan. He received his deed in 18 14. The untold hardships of the frontier fell in full measure upon these earlier settlers of Trumbull County — no churches, no schools, winters of winds moaning through the branches of giant trees, trackless forests, spring with roaring, threatening streams swollen into floods by rains and melting snow, summers and autumns with their unremitting toil without aid of any of the dextrous ma- chines of modern labor to give relief from the heavy duties of clearing the land. In such an environment Alexander and Anna Holmes McGuffey reared their pioneer family. Two sons be- came noted Americans: William Holmes and Alexander. THE McGUFFEYS ARRIVE IN OHIO 7 These worthy pioneer parents are buried side by side in the New Bedford, Pennsylvania cemetery with monu- ments that place them among the well-to-do members of that Presbyterian church. William Holmes McGuffey, the subject of this volume, was born September 23, 1800, in the old homestead of the grandfather near Washington, Pennsylvania. The exact location of this homestead is still disputed. Each of two farms, the Blaney and the Lockhart farms in West Finley Township, Washington County, claims to be the birthplace of this distinguished son. Henry Ford has lent evidence to the Blaney farm by his purchase of it and has restored the old cabin most reasonably sup- posed to be the log-cabin in which William Holmes McGuffey was born. The old logs found on the birth site were moved to Greenfield Village, Dearborn, Michigan, and used as part of the restored building. William Holmes McGuffey was second in a family of eleven children: two brothers, five sisters, and three half- sisters. Alexander, his youngest brother born August 13, 1 81 6, came with William Holmes to Miami University and was a student in the academy and college during the time of McGuffey's professorship in Miami. He as- sisted McGuffey in the completion of the McGuffey series. Alexander compiled the McGuffey Speller of 1838 and was the author of the popular McGuffey Fifth Reader^ issued in 1844. He married Elizabeth Drake, daughter of Dr. Drake of Cincinnati, to which union was born a large family. His career as teacher, attorney, church- man, and citizen was a notable one in the growing metropolis of the great West. The monotonous seasons dragged slowly through the long days of William Holmes McGuffey's boyhood, al- ways serious but not gloomy; always occupied but not 8 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS burdened with toil necessary for food, clothing, and shelter. McGuffey gained the rudiments of an elementary edu- cation from his parents and such adventurous subscrip- tion schools as occurred in Ohio for western pioneer land. He committed to memory all literature which came into his possession. At the age of twenty-one he could repeat many of the books of the Bible complete. He could repeat verbatim sermons which he heard but a single time. Conversations and names of persons and places were always accurately remembered. Young William Holmes and his sister Jane attended school in Youngstown conducted by the Reverend Wick, living with the Wick family during the week and return- ing home weekends. There is no record available about his education between the time of his private instruction with the Reverend Wick and the time of his college courses. It may have been one of self-improvement. His daughter writes of McGuffey's education as follows: \"Father had the usual education that boys of that country get, but of course it was not much. He was fond of studying and reading. He used to walk miles to borrow books from the schoolmaster or the minister and would read at night by the firelight, stretched out on the floor. He was eighteen years old before he ever saw a slate.\" That he taught in the country schools is quite evident, though records of this are entirely wanting. The \"com- mon schools\" of Ohio had scarcely dawned and prior to 1825 were wholly subscription schools. Many of the schoolmasters tramp-traveled during vacations and upon discovery of a school building canvassed the neighbor- hood or district for \"scholars\" for the ensuing winter. THE McGUFFEYS ARRIVE IN OHIO 9 These men were often well-educated men. Such a wan- dering teacher prepared Horace Mann in the Latin re- quirements for entrance to Brown University. No system of certification of teachers had been adopted by the state, and often the township trustees of the district school committee tested the \"larnin\" of the candidate. Gen- erally letters of recommendation from well-known men and credentials from colleges and academies were suf- ficient guarantee of a qualified applicant. Citizens and teachers of more than one community believe that McGuffey once taught in their school dis- tricts. In one of the recommendations of the McGuffey series the writer commented upon the author of the series: \"Respecting Professor McGuflfey, the author of the Reading Books, I would say, that I do not suppose him qualified to prepare a good book simply because he has acquired an honorable reputation as a professor in a University; yet that fact, taken in connection with the fact that he was, for many years, a distinguished Teacher of Common Schools, does certainly give him important advantages over others who are less familiar with the operations of the mind they attempt to direct; ...\" The good Reverend Hughes, traveling through the country on horseback in search of superior lads for his Greersburg Academy, chanced one day to pass the Mc- Guffey homestead. It was evening and the \"peaceful noises of the farm\" had subsided; the vespers of the native birds were faintly heard from the nearby trees and hedges; the giant forests were already black with the shades of night — friendly environment for prayer. As he drew near the garden by the road, he heard the earnest voice of Mother McGuffey pleading with Him, with whom all things are possible, to provide for further edu- lo WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS cation for her son William. The reverend principal moved silently on to his night's lodging and returned the next morning delicately to inquire if any \"likely lads\" abode among the McGuffey family. One may more fully appreciate the religious spirit of these early Scotch and Scotch-Irish Presbyterians from the following guiding principles adopted by the 114 signers of the religious code of a Presbyterian community in Washington County in which Father and Mother Mc- Guffey had lived. \"We, and each of us, whose names are underwritten, being chiefly the inhabitants of the Western frontier of Washington County, considering the many abounding evils in our own hearts and lives, as also the open and secret violation of the holy law of God, which dishonors His name and defiles and ruins our country; such as ig- norance, unbelief, hardness of heart, contempt of God and His ordinances, law, and gospel (in particular in setting our hearts upon the creature in one line or an- other more than upon God), breach of His Sabbath, disobedience to parents, back-bitings, entertaining bad thoughts, and receiving groundless evil reports of others, lascivious songs, filthy discourse, promiscuous dancing, drunkenness, defraud, deceit, over-reaching in bargains, gaming, horse racing, cock fighting, shooting for prizes, lying, covetousness, discontent, fretting against the dis- pensations of God's providence, unfaithfulness for God (in suffering sin to remain on our neighbor unreproved), denying God in the neglect of family and secret worship, catechizing and instruction of our children and servants or slaves, vexatious wranglings, and lawsuits, together with innumerable evils, provoking God to send down heavy judgments on our land, and to withhold or draw His gracious presence, and unfit our soul for enjoying any solid happiness, which we desire to acknowledge THE McGUFFEYS ARRIVE IN OHIO il with shame and sorrow of heart before God, and so in the strength of God and depending on His Grace for support, solemnly promise (to our power, according to our various places and stations) to engage against both in ourselves and others, as providence shall give op- portunity, and prudence direct.\" Reared with such a code of severe social limitations may have given bent to the philosophy of social control which always characterized McGuffey: severe in disci- plinary control, abstemious in his personal habits, lofty minded in his intellectual attitudes. Greersburg Academy was founded in a log cabin by Reverend Thomas Hughes, pastor of Mt. Pleasant Pres- byterian Church in Greersburg (later called Darlington), who built a log cabin on his lot, to be used for school purposes in 1799. In 1802 the \"Erie Presbytery\" held its annual meeting in Mt. Pleasant Church, Greersburg, Pennsylvania, and resolved to give their aid to erect an academy at Greersburg and so solicit aid in the respective charges of the Erie Presbytery for that purpose. The Reverend Thomas Hughes raised the money with which the old stone academy was erected. In 1806 the academy was chartered and served the church for about three quarters of a century, in its early history as a semi- nary for young men entering the ministry and later as a general classical academy. In 1883 it was sold to the railway now known as the Pittsburgh, Lisbon, and Western. It lists among its alumni many men prominent in public service, especially in the ministry of the Presby- terian Church. Most distinguished of them all was the Reverend William Holmes McGuffey, discovered by the worthy principal Thomas E. Hughes in what must have been to a man of his devotion a transfiguration ecstasy 12 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS in the humble home of the McGufFeys in Trumbull County, Ohio. On the morning after the ardent prayer of Anna Holmes McGuffey, the Reverend Hughes ar- ranged with the McGuffey family that William should come to the academy and live in the home of the Rev- erend Hughes and \"chore\" his expenses. McGuffey did not dig coal in the nearby hills and cart it to the \"old stone pile,\" as the boys often designated the old stone academy, to warm the classrooms, but earned his expenses by working about the benevolent pastor's house, garden, and church. While he lived at the Hughes' house, he doubtless ate the 75 cents per week academy menu, adopted by the Reverend Hughes: breakfast — coffee and bread with butter; dinner — bread, and meat or potatoes; supper — bread and milk. He probably paid no tuition even in trade, as was done by students who lacked money. This trade had a wide range of articles — butter, wool, etc. — and it is alleged that the economically versatile Principal Dilworth (1821- 1823) took, upon at least one occasion, two gallons of whisky. (The government revenue on it was no doubt paid.) In 1820, Warren, Ohio, needed a headmaster for the new school built by the town. Mr. McGuffey applied. Two of the Board of Examiners for the town were grad- uates of Yale, and succeeded in setting an examination which contained questions that had never come within the range of Mr. McGuffey's educational experience. His failure to pass this teachers' examination fixed his determination to go beyond the requirements for head- mastership of a village school. He attended college at Washington College, Washing- ton, Pennsylvania, and became a lifelong friend of the president. The Reverend Mr. Wylie was a great college THE McGUFFEYS ARRIVE IN OHIO 13 president, who taught classes most of the day and held office hours at sundry times. His personal influence dur- ing the college years of young McGuffey's life, years of intellectual maturing and career determining, was life- long. To this inspiring teacher, for he was a great teacher as well as a college executive, was due much of McGuf- fey's success in his early career. The Reverend Mr. Wylie was a native of Washington County, Pennsylvania. He was an honor graduate of Jefferson College, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1810, and soon became principal of the college. He was an advocate of the union of Jefferson and Washington Col- leges. After four years' service as principal, at the age of twenty-seven, he took the presidency of Washington Col- lege. After a successful service of twelve years at Wash- ington College through its bitterest competition with Jefferson College, he resigned to succeed the Reverend Matthew Brown, first president of Indiana College (after 1838 Indiana University) and served as president of this institution until his death in 1851. He was of Irish descent and inherited in an unusual degree the gift of teaching of which his race has always possessed so con- spicuous an endowment. McGuffey entered Washington College in 181 9, and the minutes of the Board of Trustees, September 26, 1826 carry the following: \"Resolved that the degree of A.B. be conferd [sic] on William McGuffie [sic] now Professor in Oxford University, Ohio.\" His studies had been largely Latin, Greek, philosophy, and Hebrew. The Reverend Robert Hamilton Bishop, the most dis- tinguished college president in the West at that time, learned of the qualification of Mr. McGuffey and nomi- nated him to the position of Professor of Ancient Lan- guages in Miami University. McGuffey was still in at- 14 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS tendance at Washington College, but left college to begin his teaching at Miami late in 1825, ^^ j^^t after the Christmas holidays. President Wylie's letter to McGuffey under date of February 11, 1826, justifies McGuffey's withdrawing from college before the completion of his senior year. \"Upon the whole, I am inclined to think that you acted wisely in going to Oxford. You had raked up all the information to be found here, and the prospect, afforded you there, of being useful, and at the same time prepar- ing yourself for more extended usefulness in the future, while your funds may be accumulating instead of di- minishing, I consider singularly felicitous. I did wish you very much to remain and graduate regularly with us, and afterwards to settle in some situation within striking distance of me, and in a more civilized land of the world. But I know it must not be according to my mind, and I wish you to be where you will be most useful and happy.\" President Wylie commended Mr. McGuffey to the board of trustees, Miami University: \"Understanding that the Board of the Miami Univer- sity have in contemplation to elect a professor largely for languages at their next meeting, I would beg leave to recommend to their attention William McGuffey, as a young gentleman whose attainments, habits, and taste, as well as natural qualifications, render him in my opin- ion, eminently fitted to promote the interest of literature in that department of the University.\" The board of trustees of Miami University at their next meeting March 29, 1826, passed the following reso- lution: \"Resolved that the Board do now proceed to the elec- tion of a professor of Languages, who shall receive in THE McGUFFEYS ARRIVE IN OHIO 15 compensation from the institution an annual salary of six hundred dollars and that a majority of all the votes be necessary to a choice. Mr. Porter and Mr. Gard were appointed tellers, and on the ballots being taken and counted it was found that William H. McGuffey had all the votes given and was declared duly elected.\" The conditions of roads and the methods of travel in the early times support the claim that McGuffey rode into the remote village on horseback with his personal copies of Livy, Horace, Memorabilia, and the Greek and Hebrew texts of the Bible in his saddle bags. Of his personal appearance we have three accounts. Dr. Vail in his History of the McGuffey Readers says: \"Dr. McGuffey was a man of medium stature and com- pact figure. His forehead was broad and full; his eyes clear and expressive. His features were of the strongly marked rugged Scotch type. He was a ready speaker, a popular lecturer on educational topics, and an able preacher. He was admirable in conversation. His ob- servation of men was accurate and his study of character close.\" Mr. Charles Anderson, a favorite student of McGuffey at Miami, says of him in Miami Alumni Reminiscences of Dr. W. H. McGuffey: \"I can, even now, very clearly recall the dress, appear- ance, and gait of Professor McGuffey as he entered or left the chapel or his classroom (southwest corner of the second floor), or walked to and from his newly founded family-nest, at the southeast corner of the Hamilton road, diagonally from the southern campus gate. The fashions of clothes, as of other institutions, have often and greatly changed since those 'primitive' days. If 1 6 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS any one now cares to know the Professor's then apparel, it was somewhat thus: A silk stove-pipe hat (these silken shams were just beginning to supplant the honest furs of high priced Beaver) ; a complete suit of a certain stuff, called Bombazine, black in color, of the dress pattern; and usually a cane (as I remember), composed his every- day costume. A black broadcloth frock coat was his Sunday, or pulpit, apparel. I may possibly err in this recollection, for I was never a very close observer of the dress fashions, but I think he always wore the clerical white cambric cravat, instead of the large black 'stock' of patent leather, or of some stifif board covered with velvet or Bombazine — an invention of that 'fribble- king,' George IV, then so generally in vogue. When it is added that he was most habitually and characteristi- cally neat in his person and apparel, this class of remi- niscences ought to suffice.\" Dr. Thornton in his memorial address at the dedica- tion of the McGuffey Public School building at Char- lottesville says: \"Among my earliest recollections of the University of Virginia is the figure of Dr. William Holmes McGuffey. He was a man so ugly as not to be readily forgotten; a huge mouth, a portentous nose, sandy reddish grey hair, worn so long that it curled up a little above his ears, a vast forehead heightened by baldness, keen eyes that snapped and twinkled at you. His dress was wonder- fully neat, but the most old fashioned I ever saw outside a museum. For his Sunday morning lectures to his class in Bible Studies he would array himself in a dark blue coat with brass buttons cut somewhat like the evening dress coat of the present day and known from its shape as a 'shadbellied coat.' Around his neck was a high linen collar surrounded by a voluminous black silk stock. When Professor Francis H. Smith first saw him he wore THE McGUFFEYS ARRIVE IN OHIO 17 knee breeches with black silk stockings and low shoes fastened with shining buckles. In my time he had rec- onciled himself to trousers, but it seemed to me that this was his only concession to modernity. When that mouth of his broadened into a smile he looked to me like some genial monster. When he scowled even the young devils in his classroom believed and trembled.\" Miss Katherine Stewart, living granddaughter of McGufFey, who was eight years old when her grand- father died, declares that from memory and from con- versation with the two daughters of McGuffey, she is sure McGuffey had black hair. Soon after he began his professorship at Miami Uni- versity, McGuffey met Harriet Spining, who was visit- ing her brother Charles Spining. The brother, at that time was a merchant in Oxford, and, as runs the legend, lived in the old Scott homestead, the name given to the house on the corner south of High Street and west of Campus. Miss Spining, a little later, went to live with her brother Charles, who moved to the home farm at Woodlawn, Dayton. At this farm Harriet Spining and McGuffey were married April 3, 1827. ^^^^ Spining was the daughter of Judge Isaac Spining, who held court in the log court house on Jefferson Street, Dayton, Ohio. It was not customary in those days for a young man to address letters to his fiancee in her own name. All such communications must pass to the aristocratic young sweetheart through the hands of her parent or guardian. As Miss Harriet Spining lived with her brother, such letters must be addressed to him. Young lovers always invented methods for direct communication, and the young pair agreed that all letters from Oxford should have the initial of the middle name of the brother under- scored. It is an indisputable hypothesis that when mail 1 8 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS was due at Woodlawn from the Oxford Lochinvar the dainty fingers of the young fiancee were first to touch the sacred pages. To this union were born five children: Mary Haines, January 20, 1830; Henrietta, July 10, 1832; William Holmes, October i, 1834; Charles Spining, November 8, 1835; Edward Mansfield, May 18, 1838; WilHam Holmes lived but fourteen days; Edward Mansfield died shortly after their arrival in Athens in 1839; Charles Spining died in Burlington, Vermont, in 1851, and was buried beside his mother in Woodlawn Cemetery, Day- ton, Ohio. In July, 1850, Harriet McGuffey died in Dayton, Ohio, in the house in which she was married. In the summer of 1851 McGuffey was married to Laura Howard, whose father was Dean of the School of Medicine in the University of Virginia. To them was born one daughter, Anna, who died at the age of four. Mary Haines McGuffey married Dr. Stewart, eminent physician of Dayton, Ohio; Henrietta married Dr. A. D. Hepburn, president of Miami University in 1872- 1873 and for many years head of the department of English in that institution. Social Atmospltere of tlie Ohio Country in 1836 Between the time of the birth of William Holmes Mc- Guffey, i8oOj and the year 1826, in which he graduated from Washington College and became professor at Miami University, there had been built an ^'Imperium in Imperio^^ many times. Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and the other states had come one by one into the Union from the vast plains and uplands of the Mississippi Basin. To \"Ohio the Beautiful\" was the westward march of pioneers in 1800 to 1836. And into the rich valleys of Ohio they came from the land east of the Appalachians and from across the Atlantic. Boone's Road through Cumberland Gap had attracted people from all parts of the East and Southeast, and Kentucky's population as early as 1800 was 220,000. In 1800 Ohio had 45,365; by 1836 more than a million dwelt upon her valley and upland farms and in her hundred infant cities. In 1836 the population of Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois, the first kingdom of the McGuffey Readers, had reached a little over nine million people, representing approxi- mately one million, eight hundred thousand children of school age who needed reading books and spellers. The composition of the early population was notably varied in nationality, religion, and social levels, but all of one 19 20 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS mind to make the new country a real democracy after the Jeffersonian pattern. By 1836 the foreign population of Ohio had risen to 460,970. These immigrants came chiefly from Germany, Ireland, and England. Most of them came for wholly economic reasons — they came to buy cheap land, fertile land, regardless of who were to be their neighbors. For forty years Cumberland Gap thronged with native and foreign migrants into the great spaces of the Ohio and its tributaries. Even in 1850, when the population of Ohio had reached nearly two million people, not more than one-fourth of the population was born in the state. A cross section of the population of Cincinnati at that time represents fairly accurately the distribution in the west- ern half of the state and reasonably well the distribution of peoples westward. About fifty-six per cent were native- born, and over half of the foreign-born were German. It was in this social milieu that McGuffey's readers first found favor. It was to this new audience that Mc- Guffey appealed. Here the Puritan ideas were greatly modified or entirely substituted. This new mind — prac- tical German, thrifty Scotch, witty Irish — became cos- mopolitan. The Day of Doom, Shorter Catechism, and church creed were not adequate in their literary latitudes to satisfy the high potential ambitions of their inter- mingling social currents. One may get an insight into the enthusiasm for the Ohio country from the following estimate of Ohio by a writer in 1836: \"Without boasting, we aver, and challenge the world to contradict the assertion, that this great and growing state possesses more of the essential ingredients of future greatness, and more self-sustaining and self-creating prin- ciples than any other territory of equal size on the face McGuffey's first wife, Harriet Spining The McGufTeys' home (1838) Facing page 20 SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE OHIO COUNTRY 2i of the globe. With a chmate, moderate and invigorating, with a soil of every productive variety, and capable of sus- taining a population equal to the present number in the United States, with a surface offering every possible facil- ity for railroads and canals; with its valleys already teem- ing with flocks and herds, and its hills yielding various ores and other fossils in abundance — and with internal improvements leading to every hamlet; its march must be, as it has been heretofore, onward and upward.\" What was said of the character of the Puritan Fathers of New England by Greenwood — \"Whenever a few of them settled a town they immediately gathered them- selves into a church; and their elders were magistrates and their code of laws was the Pentateuch,\" was true also of these early settlers in Ohio, except that their magis- trates were chosen from many church denominations and the Pentateuch was interpreted in terms of western life needs. Simultaneously in all the Middle West country with the establishment of communities were built temples for worship by Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Luther- ans, and other church denominations. In Cincinnati by 1 84 1 there were fifty churches holding regular services, comprising twenty- three denominations. A still greater increase of founding and building churches occurred be- tween 1850 and i860. Colleges sprang up in the Ohio country with great rapidity, and entrants to these higher schools must be prepared in pre-college studies, neces- sitating the academy and the elementary schools. By 1837, eight colleges had opened their doors in Ohio. Ohio University, founded in 1804 upon the support of two townships, set aside by the Ohio Company as a part of its contract with Congress in the purchase of a million and a half acres of land in eastern Ohio; Miami Uni- 22 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS versity founded in 1809, upon the support of one town- ship, under like contract of the John Cleves Symmes Company for three-fourths of a million acres between the Great and Little Miami; Kenyon College in 1824; Oxford College for Women in 1830; Denison in 1831; Oberlin in 1833; Ohio Wesley an in 1833; Marietta in 1835; ^^^ Muskingum in 1837. In Indiana five colleges were established by the year 1837: Indiana University, 1820; Hanover, 1827; Wabash, 1832; Franklin, 1834; DePauw, 1837. Illinois had founded St. Mary's in 1821, McKendree in 1826, Shurtleff in 1827, Jacksonville ^^ 1^29, and Knox in 1837. In Kentucky, Center was founded in 181 9 and Georgetown in 1829. ^^ Michigan, Kalamazoo was founded in 1833, the University of Michigan in 1837, ^^^ Albion in 1839. ^^ i^ Massachusetts, where the founding of Harvard in 1636 influenced education even to the dame schools, the founding of all these early colleges in the Ohio country necessitated schools and schoolbooks for all grades of education below the college. One of the greatest educational influences of the day, 1834 to 1845, was the group of intellectuals in and about Cincinnati. Cincinnati was at that time the great urban center of the Middle West. Into this broiling center of pioneer life, this haupt ban hauf of the Land of Promise, came some great spirits. One of these was Daniel Drake of New Jersey, whose creative genius touched with the hand of a true pioneer every phase of this new urban life. His ambition to found educational institutions was ex- ceeded only by that of the realtors of the day to expand Cincinnati: others were E. D. Mansfield, lawyer, philan- thropist, educator; Samuel Lewis, first state educational officer in Ohio, Superintendent of Common Schools, March 31, 1837 to December 24, 1839; Albert Pickett, SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE OHIO COUNTRY 23 author of a series of school readers, principal of Pickett's Female Seminary; John Ray, author of Ray's series of arithmetics, companion text to McGuffey Readers in the great Eclectic Series, which began in 1834 with Ray's Little Arithmetic; A. H. McGuffey, author of McGuffey's Rhetorical Guide and Fifth Reader; and William Holmes McGuffey, author of the great series of readers. Membership in this society included the leading ex- ponents of education from Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, and Tennessee. These men were the original foment for state and na- tional public education. They organized the first im- portant teachers' association in America, called it a \"Col- lege of Teachers,\" with its meeting place in Cincinnati, Ohio. In the meetings of this organization, known later as the Western Literary Institute, its members discussed the problems of education. The common schools constituted the chief phase of education found on the annual pro- grams. This topic in one form or another appeared on the several annual programs from 1834 to 1840 one hundred and nineteen times. McGuffey was a promi- nent member of this society throughout its existence and frequently gave addresses before this body. His lecture before this society in 1845 ^^^ an eloquent appealfor the education of the whole community; leisure for the laboring class that they might become pious and intel- ligent; the need of trained teachers; continued growth of teachers in service; adequate school buildings. This body agitated the need of western culture and western schools, which gave great impetus to western authorship and western publications. Bookmaking had established itself quite independently east of the Appalachians. Boston, New York, and Phila- 24 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS delphia had freed themselves of all domination of foreign printers. Stereotype plates were introduced into New York in 1812 by David Bruce. The early printers and bookmakers of the Ohio country used movable type. Publishing houses spread rapidly in all western cities and the slogan \"western books for western people\" was adopted by the western publishing establishments. The rise of books published in the Ohio country greatly stimu- lated western authorship. Lexington and Louisville, Kentucky, and Cincinnati, Ohio, became the three cen- ters to which booksellers, publishers, and printers of the East migrated. While the earliest cultural centers of the great West were found in Kentucky — Transylvania, Lex- ington, and Louisville — Cincinnati soon became the greatest intellectual influence west of the Alleghenies. In 1840^ there were 385 printing presses in the West, of which 159 were in Ohio. Of the 57 binderies in the West, 40 were in Ohio. \"As early as 1826 there were printed in the city of Cin- cinnati sixty-one thousand almanacs, fifty-five thousand spelling books, thirty thousand primers, three thousand copies of the Bible News, fifty thousand table arithmetics, three thousand American Preceptors, three thousand American Readers, three thousand Introductions to the English Reader, three thousand Kirkham's grammar, fourteen thousand testaments, hymn, and music books, one thousand Vine Dresser's Guide, five hundred Ham- mond's Ohio reports, five hundred Symmes Theory,^ and other miscellaneous books.\" U. P. James, a Cincinnati publisher, stimulated great interest in books by his widely advertised Book Trade iRusk, Literature of the Middle Western Frontier. 2A theory that on antipodal sides of the earth the surface was indented by two great cones and upon the inner surface of these cones lived the human race. SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE OHIO COUNTRY 25 Sales; Truman and Smith's lists were always longest at these sales. They were leaders in advertising. By 1839 Cincinnati was dominant in western bookmaking. The increasing millions of the Ohio country look to Cincin- nati for books. Truman and Smith is the dominating publishing house in Cincinnati; Truman and Smith pub- lishes the McGuffey Readers; Truman and Smith gets the business. With the coming of the great edition of 1857 came the additional publishing house of Clark, Austin, and Smith (Clark, Austin, and Maynard; Clark and Maynard) of New York; J. B. Lippincott and Company of Philadel- phia. During the Civil War the Methodist Book Concern of Nashville published the McGuffey Readers for the Southern States. Clark, Austin, and Smith with duplicate plates published the readers in New York for some years. This firm was succeeded by Clark, Austin, Maynard and Company, which failed in 1862. W. B. Smith \"bought up\" the assets and resumed the business in New York under management of W. B. Thalheimer. From the time of the birth of William Holmes McGuf- fey, September 23, 1800, to the day he graduated from college in 1826, the rural people of the Ohio country had no books. Here was a generation of bookless millions. The dominant personalities were spreading their several hybrid vocabularies in private conversations and in the various sound contacts, often using mongrel words whose sounds seemed incapable of any orderly arrangement for spelling. The predominant nationality in southwestern and western Ohio was German. Many came through and from Pennsylvania, others direct from the Fatherland. The early Moravians, Zoroites, Mennonites, Dunkers, River Brethren, Amish, and Schwenkfelders possessed 26 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS only the one book, the German Bible. America was an English nation and only in small colonies of strict secta- rian population was the native language of another na- tion encouraged as the practical language. All court records, deeds, and public documents were in English. The churches alone were conducted in the native tongue other than English. Cincinnati, Dayton, St. Louis, and a few other cities carried bilingual courses of study in the elementary schools, the second language being chiefly German. < The struggle to learn a new language without books and little social contact was difficult for the young and almost impossible among the adults. There was only oral speech. Few could write in English, and the spoken word was so distorted by the mingling of German and English sounds that one could make his meaning known only to those who had learned the same dialect. The following is from Eggleston's Hoosier Schoolmaster. It is the threatening letter from the gang in Flat Creek District to Squire Hawkins to intimidate his court.

Without books English forms were learned from the father and mother who, struggling to repeat the new tongue, wove the sounds into a grotesque dialect. Adults rarely learn to speak a foreign language with accuracy. In Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion the slow progress of the tal- ented little flower girl under personal instruction in learn- ing to speak good English illustrates McGuffey's task in changing muddling dialects to English. The following list of words is taken from the lessons of the original Third and Fourth Readers. At the end of each lesson is given a list of words often mispronounced.

They were, in 1834, publishing The Child's Bible, Mason's Sacred Harp, Ra^s Little Arithmetic, Smithes Practical and Mental Arith- metic, Smithes Productive Grammar, The Picture Primer, The Picture Reader, and a few miscellaneous books of an ele- mentary character. The business was not prosperous, and Smith, arriving early one morning at the humble place of business, made two piles of the meager assets of the firm. In the first he piled the school textbooks including Raj^s Arith- metic and four little readers of McGuffey, and in the second the rest of their publications. On the top of the second pile he placed all the cash on hand. When Mr. Truman arrived. Smith offered his partner his choice of the two piles to dissolve the partnership. Unable to en- visage the golden fortune of the readers Truman pounced upon the pile with the cash. Mr. Smith was especially interested in school texts and gave emphasis in his extensive advertisements to the peculiar adaptability of the firm's texts to \"western schools.\" Smith, who was a pioneer in the big American advertising game, had learned through the success of the few textbooks of the firm, especially that of Ray^s Little Arithmetic, that the future in schoolbooks was gold- 30 HOW THE McGUFFEY READERS BEGAN 31 rimmed. Early in the short history of the firm, Truman and Smith, he began to cast about for an eminent edu- cator who would compile a series of readers.^ Lyman Beecher, with his children destined for such great careers, arrived in Cincinnati in 1832. As presi- dent-elect of the newly established Lane Seminary he settled in Walnut Hills. His son, Henry Ward, was al- ready attracting public attention, and Catherine, oldest daughter, to assuage her grief at the tragic loss of her betrothed in a hurricane at sea, turned her mind to teaching and established the Female Institute for Girls in Hartford, Connecticut. She wrote the arithmetic and other texts to be used by the young ladies of the institute. Ill-health led her to discontinue her work at Hartford, and she came west with her father. Her estab- lished name as educator and author had preceded her, and soon after her arrival, upon urgent requests of citi- zens, she opened in Cincinnati the Western Female In- stitute and became identified with the educational move- ments of the West. It was to Miss Catherine Beecher that Smith first turned with his proposition that she assume authorship of his Eclectic Readers. Though Miss Beecher had shown great interest in elementary education, her main interests lay in higher education for women, and she declined Mr. Smith's proposition. ' Calvin E. Stowe, popular professor in Lane Seminary, was one of the most active members of the Western Literary Institute and College of Professional Teachers. In January 1836, he married Harriet Beecher and was the same year sent by the Ohio General Assembly to Germany to study the school system of that country. McGuffey's contact with the Beechers and his intimate ^Vail, History of McGuffey Readers. 32 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS association with William Holmes McGuffey in the West- ern College Teachers Institute, in which McGuffey was also an active member, doubtless led to the suggestion that Mr. Smith make his proposition to write school readers for Truman and Smith to Professor McGuffey. McGuffey had already planned a series of readers and had published in London a treatise on Methods of Reading; his First Reader was already compiled, copied, and ready for the printer in 1833. The principles and rules for good reading aloud were formulated and used in his adult classes in the college. His painstaking in training the \"yo^^§ gentlemen\" of the college in class hours and out of class hours to read and speak fluently was pro- verbial in Miami University. ] Smith's proposition to McGuffey was doubtless made in 1834 or early in 1835. McGuffey had taught in ele- mentary schools; he was co-worker with the leading men interested in a system of common schools for Ohio; his plans for a series of readers were made especially to meet the needs of the great civilization developing in the Ohio country. McGuffey had collected a large number of school readers; many were compiled for private schools, often by the \"head masters\"; others were written for the open market, conceived to meet the demand of private and common schools. McGuffey's series were compiled for the common schools only, the common schools which he and his co-workers in the Western Teachers College Institute had been zealously laboring to establish in the pioneer land. The series comprised a primer, a speller to replace Webstefs Elementary Speller, and four readers. The Primer, containing thirty-one pages, issued a year after the appearance of the First and Second Readers seems almost unnecessary in the series. Only one copy HOW THE McGUFFEY READERS BEGAN 33 of this primer is extant (so far as the author knows). The cover design was continued for the Primer of the McGuffey series for many years. In 1849 the Primer was wholly remade into two vol- umes; one, McGuffey s Smaller Eclectic Primer; the other, McGuffefs Pictorial Eclectic Primer. It was the Pictorial Primer that introduced the children to the earliest phases of visual education. It contained 172 engravings; of boys 52, girls 32, dogs 26, cats 23; birds, toys, fruits, animals familiar and striking, games, childhood's dramatic scenes, thrilling adventure, and pious mothers and children praying to an all-seeing God. It was a veritable modernized Orhis Pictus. It gave the children its first ever- to-be-remembered poem: \"The lark is up to meet the sun, The bee is on the wing; The ant its la-bor has be-gun. The woods with mu-sic ring. \"Shall birds, and bees, and ants, be wise, While I my mo-ments waste? O let me with the morn-ing rise. And to my du-ty haste.\" This book contained nearly 1,000 words of one syllable, nearly 200 words of two syllables, and became the First Reader of the edition of 1857. The First Reader of 1841, as the edition of 1836, pre- supposed that the child could read, and opens with *'The New Book.\" This book introduces the child to McGuffey's ethical code contained in the advanced readers. The child met in this book in story form the principles of fundamental moral behavior necessary in a good community: prompt- ness, goodness, kindness, honesty, and truthfulness. 34 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS Reverence and piety characterize the fifty-five lessons. The last lesson, \"We All Must Die,\" sets forth the im- mortality of the soul in childhood language and analogy, with the blessed inheritance of the good — a place \"where there is no night , nor winter, nor storms'''', three great fears of the pioneer child. The last paragraph of the \"Good-Bye\" at the close of the book gives the ever ecstatic hope of promotion: \"If you have been a good child and learnt your lessons well, you may now have the Second Reader.\" Some of these lessons were classic in child literature and were continued in later editions: \"The Lame Dog,\" \"The Story Teller,\" \"The Cruel Boy,\" \"The Broken Window,\" \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,\" \"Mr. Post,\" \"The Cool Shade,\" \"The Litde Dog,\" \"Mary's Lamb\" (edition of 1848). The classic Second Reader appeared simultaneously with the first and followed the same pattern — reading with spelling, eighty-five lessons with sixteen pictures, and one hundred and sixty-six pages. It opened with the \"Little Readers.\" This book was a compendium of stories about the heavens above and the earth beneath; the air, the sea and the land, pets and ferocious beasts; history, biog- raphy, astronomy, zoology, botany, sociology; games and sports in poetry and prose; table manners, behavior toward parents, toward brothers and sisters, toward the aged, the poor, animals; attitudes toward God and toward teachers, the great and the good. It gave fixed codes for every pioneer man and woman. It is a book of the youth's world in a pioneer land. The obligations and duties of youth are stressed, the first great step in America through public education to establish social be- havior through well-chosen lessons and anecdotes of HOW THE McGUFFEY READERS BEGAN 35 right living, serious but not gloomy, exemplary but not didactic. This book with its changes and additions to the edition of '535 was high school and college curriculum in log cabin days to the boys and girls of fourteen to sixteen years of age. For the girls were \"Puss and her Kittens,\" ''The Greedy Girl,\" \"Story About Little Mary,\" (\"Mary's Lamb\" came into the Second Reader in 1853), \"The Kind Litde Girl,\" \"The Litde Letter Writer\"; for the boys were \"The Idle Boy,\" \"Edward and the Cat,\" \"Story about Frank,\" \"The Boy and the Bear,\" \"The Quarrelsome Cocks,\" \"True Courage,\" \"Washington's Little Hatchet,\" \"Obedient Casablanca,\" \"About Using Profane Language,\" \"Father William,\" \"The Diligent Scholar,\" \"The Lark and the Farmer,\" \"Young Sol- diers,\" \"Harry and the Guidepost,\" \"The Seven Sticks,\" \"Waste Not, Want Not.\" Other lessons made equal appeal to both sexes. One of the closing lessons in an early edition was \"The Mother and Child' I\". \"Mother, who made the stars, Which light the beautiful sky? Who made the moon so clear and bright, That rises up on high?\" \"'Twas God the glorious One He formed them by his power; He made alike the brilhant sun, And every leaf and flower.\" Millions and millions of boys and girls graduated from this book into the tests and trials of the practical world. These were the only topics which engaged the literary conversations and criticisms of those faraway wearers of flannel and \"linsey-woolsey.\" Romeos, Hamlets, Elaines, Lancelots, Clarissa Harlowes, Evangelines would have 36 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS been incomprehensible heroes and heroines to them. Millions of pioneer men and women were alumni of this Second Reader College. They could read and write in English. The Second and Third were recopyrighted in 1 838 under suit of \"over-imitation\" by the publishers of the Worces- ter Readers. The identical lessons were removed from the Second and the Third. In the Third the rules for read- ing which preceded each lesson were practically all re- worded. Slight additions were also made and the new editionissued under \"Revised and Improved.\" Thus under \"Revised and Improved\" and homonymous titles of lessons were hidden the ugly threats of the big bad wolf of eastern publishers against the rising competitors of the West. It may be of interest to note the astute manner in which Mr. Smith and the author of the series avoided notable appearances of change in the Revised and Im- proved edition of 1 838, succeeding the suit of Worcester Readers vs. McGuffey Readers. In comparing the table of contents one would scarcely notice the changes. The \"Cat and Ball\" of the old edition is called \"Puss and Kittens\" in the Revised and Improved, \"About the Sun\" to \"About the Moon,\" \"Time to Get Up\" to \"The Early Riser.\" By July, 1837, the Third and Fourth Readers were published. Few schools, except in towns and villages, needed more than the first two books, but for the more populous centers, the entire series was used: primer, four readers with spelling covering all the words of the 295 lessons, and spelling book containing many thousands of words, abbreviations, rules of orthography and orthoepy. The Third Reader was much more formal, more like other books of the period. ROM,VN CAVIT.VL l.KTTKKS. ROMAN SM Al.l. I.hlTKHH A D abed JIM. €j m. f^ Mm P m n 1 M.

The rules for oral reading precede every lesson through- out the text of fifty-seven lessons. Three pictures only are used in this text. It was not a book for eight- year-old children, nor for the third grade of an eight-grade ele- mentary school, but was a text much of which was designed for maturer minds, such as the junior high school of today. In succeeding editions the best lessons found their way into the higher numbers of the series. \"Freaks of the Frost\" and \"The Russian Peasant\" were transferred to the Fifth of the great 1857 edition. The great lessons in this book were soon transferred to the more advanced books in subsequent editions. Few pioneer children reached the Third Reader. Lazy George Jones in \"Consequence of Idleness\" startled many a boy into studious ways: \"How the Fly Walks on the Ceiling,\" \"The Generous Russian Peasant,\" \"Touch Not, Taste Not, Handle Not.\" The first Fourth Reader was an introduction to good literature. The poetry was taken largely from British writers. It maintained and elaborated the basic objec- tives of the series, \"Reading aloud with sense, clearness, and appreciation.\" \"The volume completes the series of the Eclectic Readers. It follows in the steps of its pred- ecessors so far as principle is concerned.\" In the preface the author again emphasizes his copious use of the Bible among the selections. As in the preface to the Third the author apologizes for not using the sacred scriptures more; in the preface to the Fourth he justifies his wide use 38 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS of biblical literature in prose and poetry. \"In a Christian country that man is to be pitied who at this day can honestly object to imbuing the minds of the youth with the language and spirit of the word God.\" This text was addressed to the highest class in the schools, and much of its literature was of a level of diffi- cultness with that of the American secondary schools: sixty-nine lessons in prose and twenty-eight lessons in poetry, all serious, ethical, and religious. Nothing can show the great shift in education more clearly than a comparison of the literature of this con- cluding book of a series of school readers, with the course of reading for a modern high school. In its contents were sketches of the character of Wilberforce, of Napol- eon Bonaparte, of Mr. Brougham, of the Puritan Fathers, of women, of God; temperance education, religion, philosophy, the common schools, oratory — all were chosen from the hortatory, the patriotic, the grand, the exemplary. Twenty-nine lessons were biblical and reli- gious. Little of this book survived in succeeding editions. In his prose he drew upon American authors, many of them local: Lyman Beecher, Robert Hall, Dr. Drake, Catherine Beecher, Grimke, Webster, E. D. Mansfield, Sigourney, Nott, Channing, with a preface in which the author discusses the mind of the child, how the child learns, the value of the teacher's becoming a learner with the child, extols the \"simplicity of wisdom,\" extends his instructions of the methods of teaching reading, justifies his lists of questions, probable errors in pronunciation following each lesson, answers the critics on his methods used in his earlier books. He respectfully submitted the volume to the judgment of the public at Cincinnati, July 1837. The press in the western country was in general favor- HOW THE McGUFFEY READERS BEGAN 39 able to the McGuffey series and in many cases enthusias- tic. Though favorable to the readers, a \"Mr. Alphabet\" of the Richmond Palladium gives some adverse criticism which seems quite afield from most criticisms on school readers, and its psychology is enough different to give it a flavor of humor: \"... Let us now draw examples from the author whom we have brought before us. We will begin with the Primer. 'The horse is fond of grass:' here is a set of words with which the little reader has become fa- miliar; the idea is equally intelligible. It is perhaps the very language which he has often heard while the horse has been grazing before him. But when the author tells him: 'God made the cow' ; the child is led into the regions of abstruse philosophy, where, if he see at all, he sees imperfectly. How can it be expected, that a mind unused to profundity of thought, unskilled in ratio- cination, and unfamiliar with the principles of ontology, should trace the succession of agencies from omnipotence through a train of secondary causes to the appearance of the cow! The little reader is told that God made the tall oak; here again is a great ellipsis. How natural would it be for the child to say: it was not made, it grew. He has practical knowledge of the word made, and all its inflections; he has witnessed the making of bread, the making of fires, the making of pictures; and in accord- ance with the definition, he correctly says, the oak was not made.\" The First Reader was revised in 1841, 1844, and 1848; the Second in 1838, 1841, and 1844; the Third in 1838, 1843, and 1848; the Fourth in 1844 and 1848. The Speller was revised, improved and enlarged in 1846. In the early history of the books every reprinting was called an edi- tion. These editions ran into figures as high as forty-one. 40 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS The editions in which radical changes were made in the entire series were the editions of 1853, 1857, and 1879. 1836-38 The original edition including Primer and Speller with changes in Second and Third in 1 838 under caption \"Revised and Improved.\" 1841-49 During which time changes and additions were made in each volume without regard to the others. In 1844 the Second Reader was issued under the caption of \"Newly Revised\" and great changes were made in the Primer in 1849. The Fifth Reader was added in 1844 and the much improved Speller in 1 846. 1853 Entire series of readers \"Newly Revised.\" 1857 Radical changes in gradation and redistribu- tion of material with much new material under the caption \"New\"; Sixth Reader and 1863 High School Reader added; minor changes in this edition were made in 1865, 1866, and 1885. Mrs. Obed Wilson completely revised the First in 1863 using Billy, Katy, Carey, and other nephews and nieces of hers for illustra- tions. 1879 Completely remade; uniform binding in brown. 1 90 1 Recopyrighted, slight changes. 1920 Recopyrighted, slight changes. The seven parent publishing houses of the McGufTey readers are as follows: Truman and Smith 1834- 1843 W. B. Smith 1843-1852 W. B. Smith & Co 1852-1863 Sargent, Wilson & Hinkle 1 863-1 868 Wilson, Hinkle & Co 1 868-1 877 Van Antwerp, Bragg & Co. . . .1877-1890 American Book Co 1 890- Sources, Peers, and Competitors The first books that came to this bookless generation were textbooks for the schools — textbooks about facts, history, social life, poetry, stories. The whole range of literature for home and public occasion had to come through the textbooks of the public schools. The public schools began in earnest in 1828 in the Ohio country. They began in Ohio in that year by the bargaining of members of the Ohio Assembly who were interested in the schools with the members who were interested in promoting canals. We use the word \"bar- gaining\" without odium. The members of the Assembly directly interested in schools agreed to allow the state to use the irreducible debt school funds, that is, money which the townships had deposited with the state from the sale of School Section Sixteen and other school lands, to dig the canal from Toledo to Cincinnati, and the members of the Assembly interested in public improvement agreed to a state- wide tax levied by counties of one-half mill; 1829, to three-fourths of a mill; and in 1838 to two mills for schools. Who can write books to meet the need of these schools, such books this new country will use, a human interest series of readers? The lessons of the new readers must lead from the level of the experience, the intellectual status, the religious beliefs, the unwritten economic 41 42 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS codes, the new world of these unpuritanic pioneers possessed of tolerance, neighborliness, toil, strict honesty and truthfulness, unfeigned faith and piety. The old school stressed death and the grave; the new must stress life and the wondrous world about. If \"infant damna- tion\" was still a belief among the Calvinists of the western empire it must not be thrust into the literature of the schools, childhood must not be made conscious of it through the new school readers. The Puritan children argued with God against their fate: Children: \"O great Creator, why was our Nature depraved and forlorn? Why so defil'd, and made so vil'd whilst we were yet unborn?\" God: \"You sinners are, and such a share as sinners may expect, Such you shall have; for I do save none but my own Elect. \"A Crime it is, therefore in bliss you may not hope to dwell; But unto you I shall allow the easiest place in Hell.\" The material cannot be copied from the New England courses of English stories and poetry. Their children are not the children of New England who had been com- mitting to memory selections from the popular poem The Day of Doom for a hundred years. Dirgy, grave, and theological was their one reading book, the New England Primer. \"There is a dreadful fiery Hell Where wicked ones must always dwell.\" SOURCES, PEERS, AND COMPETITORS 43 \"When wicked children mocking said To an old man, Go up Bald Head, God was displeased with them and sent Two bears which them in pieces rent.\" The dramatic situations in this text were too terrible to be dramatized even by children in their improvised play-school. The greatest dramatic incident of this school text was the burning of John Rogers, a heretic of Queen Mary's reign. Every line of the martyr's farewell poem froze the dramatic instinct: \"Give ear my children to my words build not your house too high But always have before your eyes that you were born to die. Though here my body be adjudg'd in flaming fire to fry My soul I trust will strait ascend and live with God on high.\" A new literature must be compiled for the generation that \"knew not Joseph,\" that knew not the anti-bear- baiters of Plymouth Rock. Another English background must be found. The American sources of material for school readers was limited beyond imagination. Not until the advent of the New York group of writers, Willis, Drake, Halleck, Irving, Bryant; and the Massachusetts group, Whittier, Longfellow, Lowell, and Alcott could American prose and poetry form any part of an American school reader. In the first Fourth Reader, published in 1837, slightly above forty per cent of the 235 lessons were from American sources; in the first Fifth in 1844, less than twenty per cent of the 235 lessons were from American sources; while in the Fifth of 1879 nearly fifty per cent were from American sources. Many of the American 44 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS authors of the earlier editions had only local reputation and are now unknown except in local history. The new texts must be an introduction to the joys of life, the beauty of the garden, field, and wood. \"Come, come, come. The Summer now is here Come out among the flowers And make some pretty bowers.\" \"We had a pleasant walk today, Over the meadows and far away; Across the bridge by the water-mill, By the green wood-side, and up the hill. \"We saw the yellow wall-flower wave Upon a moldering castle wall; And then we watched the busy rooks Among the ancient elm-trees tall. \"And leaning from the old stone bridge. Below, we saw our shadows lie; And through the gloomy arches watched The swift and fearless swallows fly.\" * * * \"Oh for boyhood's time of June, Crowding years in one brief moon When all things I heard or saw Me, their master, waited for. I was rich in flowers and trees, Humming-birds and honey-bees; For my sport the squirrel played, Plied the snouted mole his spade; For my taste the blackberry cone Purpled over hedge and stone. Laughed the brook for my delight Through the day and through the night, Whispering at the garden wall, Talked with me from fall to fall.\" SOURCES, PEERS, AND COMPETITORS 45 \"In summer at the close of day When sunset shades had come George with his Rover went to find the cows and drive them home.\" * * * \"The lark is up to meet the sun The bee is on the wing.\" * * * \"Mary had a little lamb, Its fleece was white as snow.\" \"God plants each flower that blows with loveliness and bloom, He gives the violet and the rose their beauty and perfume.\" \"TEN COMMANDMENTS IN VERSE 1 . Thou no gods shalt have but me. 2. Before no idol bend the knee. 3. Take not the name of God in vain. 4. Dare not the sabbath day profane. 5. Give to thy parents honor due. 6. Take heed that thou no murder do. 7. Abstain from words and deeds unclean. 8. Steal not, for thou by God art seen. 9. Tell not a willful lie, nor love it. 10. What is thy neighbor's do not covet.\" \"With all thy soul love God above; And as thyself thy neighbor love.\" \"THE LORD'S PRAYER Our father in heaven, We hallow thy name; May thy kingdom holy On earth be the same; O, give to us daily, 46 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS Our portion of bread, It is from thy bounty, That all must be fed. Forgive our transgressions. And teach us to know That humble compassion, That pardons each foe; Keep us from temptation, From weakness and sin, And thine be the glory Forever: Amen!\" The organization rendered the lower schools prepara- tory. All early primary schools led but to the grammar school or the academy, and none of the texts and les- sons in the pre-grammar school were child-centered or made use of interesting child environment. They taught, not what the child delighted to know, but what adults, often provincial or prejudiced, determined he should know. Those were the days in which the only reasons for being a child was that of sometime becoming an adult. Every boy was a \"little man\" as his hat, trousers, coat, and boots bespoke. Every girl was a \"little lady\" with bon- nets and frocks like mamma's except in size; childhood life was under utmost restraint, and all behaviors were SOURCES, PEERS, AND COMPETITORS 47 imitations woman-ward. At table and tea, in parlor and hall decorum was adult. The three sources that contributed largely to the theme and bias of the early readers may assist in under- standing the transition period of school readers. The first of these authors, Maria Edgeworth, came from Longford County, Ireland, about sixty miles from Dublin. She was born into the landholders' class and of a literary father, Richard Lovell Edgeworth, whose interest in better management of estates led him and his famous daughter to make plans for the improvement in education of the tenantry. Parents Assistant, by Maria Edgeworth and her father closed its seven volumes in 1800 with Little Plays for Children, the same year William H. McGuffey was born. Between this and 181 2 appeared Popular Tales, and Moral Tales, a wealth of practical children's literature. These books became popular in America immediately. Little Plays for Children, Moral Tales, all furnished source material for many of the readers appearing in America between 1820 and 1840. Simple Susan; Waste Not, Want Not; The Orange Man; The Prussian Vase; Rosana; Lazy Lawrence; The Purple Jar were abridged, adapted and imitated in most of the early American readers. Many of the stories were peasant stories most easily adapted to the children of the Ohio country and adjacent states. Many were thrift tales such as Waste Not, Want Not; Rosana; Consequences of Idleness; Lazy Lawrence; Tit for Tat. Some of the tales were de- signed for boys who had already decided upon the occu- pation they meant to follow as men. The Prussian Vase was among the most popular for boys who meant to be- come lawyers. The story illustrates to Frederick the Great the judicial value of the English trial by jury. It likewise exemplifies the magnanimity of the great Prus- 48 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS sian king. It gives a clear instance of the dangers of circumstantial evidence and illustrates thrillingly the detective genius of the shrewd barrister in sleuthing evidence. Mr. and Mrs. Bolingbrooke was most widely used by the early American reader makers. Though a limited number of Maria Edgeworth's tales, stories, and plays were used boldly in American readers, the influ- ence of their style, moral teaching, and human interest, established standards in all compilations of readers in America. From the Quakers of Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, came Lindley Murray, the oldest of five children, dull- looking as a child, who at fourteen ran away from home to go to boarding school in New Jersey. His father wanted to make a merchant of his son, and used every persuasion and tempting opportunity to interest him in a business career, but the son's uncontrollable interest in scholarly pursuits overcame all temporary interests. Easy money and fat jobs found on every hand in New York during the Revolutionary War could not warm Lindley's heart to commercial pursuits. After the Revo- lution, Lindley Murray went to Holgate, a Quaker community in England. English grammars in 1784 had made little progress among English schools. Latin and Greek grammars were plentiful, but little endeavor was made to systema- tize English forms. The girls in Friends School in York petitioned Mr. Murray of Holgate to write a grammar for them, which was published in 1795. It passed through many editions, abridgments, and reconstruc- tions, and became the model for grammars in America for a half a century, and gave the title. Father of English Grammar, to its author. He followed this with his English readers, written SOURCES, PEERS, AND COMPETITORS 49 more particularly for the American grammar schools and the pre-grammar schools — The English Reader^ The Introduction to the English Reader^ and The Sequel to the English Reader. These reached the Cincinnati printers early and entered the race for patronage in the Ohio country as early as 1833. Murray's readers were pub- lished in every city in America. These readers were never used in New England, but came into the Ohio country chiefly by way of Pennsylvania. They placed the emphasis less on puritanic churchiness and more on history and modes of human conduct. To those who may not be familiar with the ideas of what children should read at the opening of the nine- teenth century, excerpts from the table of contents of Murray's Introduction, the first of his series of readers, may be illuminating. This book, America's first first Reader, was not a book of \"samp and milk\" but followed in the form of rhetoric. Rhetoric and rhetorical exercises were high lights of readers of the period. McGuffey followed this lead in the voluminous rhetorical exercises of his Readers and in his rhetorical guide, the great Fifth Reader. All readers were ridden with rhetorical exercises. Murray's Introduction classified all its selections formally under: Selected sentences and paragraphs, Narrative pieces. Didactic pieces. Descriptive pieces, Pathetic pieces, Promiscuous pieces. All printed literary units were denominated \"pieces.\" These children read pieces, spoke pieces, sang pieces, played pieces. Pieces covered all forms of composition — literary, musical, psychological. One of the interesting facts about the early reader-makers is that all of them must include a section of what was known as selected sentences or selected sentences and paragraphs, proverbs, quoted and original. Many of the books scattered these 50 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS throughout the texts in groups. McGuffey gave twenty such in his first Third Reader: \"Modesty is one of the chief ornaments of youth.\" \"Our best friends are those who tell us of our faults and teach us how to correct them.\" Proverbs on gratitude, vice, pride, revenge, deceit, etc., were included. Selections from the table of contents in this American First Reader may be of interest.

From the Hampstead hilltop could be seen the heath \"with its fresh, inspiring breezes, its lovely dis- tances of far-off waters, and gray hollows.\" The daughter of a schoolmaster, she dreamed of great things she might do as is recounted in her Skylark of later years. \"Mount, child of morning, mount and sing, And gaily beat thy fluttering wing And sound thy shrill alarms. Bathed in the fountains of the dew. Thy sense is keen, thy joys are new, The wide world opens to thy view And spreads its earliest charms. 'Twas thus my earliest hopes aspired, 'Twas thus my youthful ardour fired I vainly thought to soar. Sing on! Sing on! What heart so cold When such a tale of joy is told But needs must sympathize As from some cherub of the sky? I hail thy morning melody, Oh! could I mount with thee on high And share thy ecstasies.\" At thirty she married a schoolmaster and to their prosperous school for boys at Palgrave, Suffolk, came boys who later filled important civic and literary places. William Taylor, Lord Chief Justice Denman, and Sir William Gell were among those who had remembered with gratitude the special care which Mrs. Barbauld gave them while they were boys at Palgrave. Among the most important \"scholars\" of Palgrave, however, was little Charles Aiken Barbauld, adopted son of the famous mother. It was especially for Charles that Mrs. Barbauld wrote her Early Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose for children. It was these Early Lessons and Hymns in Prose that became an inspiration to early text- 52 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS book writers in America. Little Charles became the audience of the world for his appeals in behalf of the simpler truths more simply told for children. These new attitudes, methods, and curriculum material interested educators in France, Spain, Germany, and Italy as well as America. Translations were made into the languages of the leading nations of Europe. In the early readers many excerpts from her essays on education were inserted. \"A Boy Without Genius\" is a typical illustration of methods of dealing with backward pupils. Samuel Acres, whose father sends a most dis- couraging letter about his son, a boy who could not learn, to Schoolmaster Solon Wiseman, was received by the master and so directed by him as to fit Samuel for one of the professions. Hymns in Prose for children abound in moral and ethical tales, in theme somewhere between Cinderella and the Spectator. Her poems also found considerable space in the early readers. \"Life we've been long together, 'Tis hard to part when friends are dear; Perhaps 'twill cost a sigh or tear; Then steal away, give little warning Choose thine own time; Say not good night, but in some brighter clime Bid me good morning.\" The exaltation of Mrs. Barbauld's sacred poetry classed much of it among the hymns of Protestant churches. Ezekiel Cheever and the Boston schoolmasters were still imitating the grammar school forms of England, but from these three sources arose the new readers for the empire beyond the Appalachians. With the wide success of the Edgeworth discussion of education in the Parents Assistant^ principles of which William Holmes McGuffey I Facinn page 52 Alexander H. McGuffey, brother of William, and author of the McGuffey Sixth Reader SOURCES, PEERS, AND COMPETITORS 53 were widely adopted by the neophyte textbook writers in America. These textbook-makers multiplied at a rapid rate in New England. Every schoolmaster of experience wrote texts for his own school and expanded the issue as demand warranted. The materials of these books were adaptations of English works to American schools, most of which were transplantations of English schools. It remained for McGuffey to make the exact choice of material for the West. No one who had not grown up amidst the conditions in the new land could understand the social and religious mind of the people of this new civilization. The textbook writers of New England were still steeped in the spirit of Puritanism. McGuffey knew such of the current of English thought as would appeal to his great audience of youth, the first native-born generation of the Ohio country. This differentiation in the selection of literature and in the original stories of the McGuffey Readers was great enough to make this series the chosen texts of the rising millions. The New England textbooks were still written for the gifted of the better families. McGuffey's Readers made a universal appeal, especially to and for the poor, for which the constitutions of the new states so specifically provided in all public supported schools. All the authors of the greatest early competitors of the McGuffey Read- ers were eastern born. Samuel Griswold Goodrich, author of the Goodrich School Readers and America's first prolific storyteller, \"author of 170 volumes,\" was born in Connecticut in 1 793. He was the great Peter Parley from whom all the competitors of school readers copied, legally and plagi- aristically. He knew nothing of the emerging civilization of the great West, and his stories were largely English, set 54 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS in the social environment east of the Alleghenies. An examination of Goodrich's Fourth Reader will reveal how much it was modeled on the first of all American readers, Lindley Murray's English Readers. While McGuffey's Fourth was the most English of the original group, more than fifty per cent of its lessons in 1844 were chosen from American writers. Goodrich's Readers were published in Louisville, Kentucky to give western atmosphere to them and also to give a good talk- ing point to salesmen. Louisville was second in impor- tance to Cincinnati in the publishing business on that side of the mountain barrier between East and West. Lyman Cobb, Massachusetts born, and the same age as McGuffey, never went west of the Alleghenies. Teach- ing and authorship of textbooks were quite secondary issues of his genius. Like Goodrich and McGuffey, he floated his books under his own name: Cobb's New Juve- nile Readers. His readers were the first complete set, and by 1844 comprised a series of eight readers. These readers showed also much of Lindley Murray's plan.\" The illustrations were mostly English. John Pierpont, born in Connecticut, never came West, and his texts had the New England breath and the moral tone of old England. His series of readers was one of the most serious early competitors of the McGuffey Readers. He says in the preface to his American First Classbook, \"This book has been compiled with special reference to the public reading and grammar schools of the city (New York).\" Albert Pickett, the most successful schoolmaster of Cincinnati, was also eastern born and bred. His readers were written for his own famous girls school in Cincin- nati and bore the marks of a true evaluation of the life of the western city. These readers carried as a part of their SOURCES, PEERS, AND COMPETITORS 55 advertising a testimonial of their excellence from Mr. McGuffey, but they never caught the western country as a whole. Pickett's major interest was in the advanced classes, and his texts were still typical of the readers written for the New England grammar schools. Worcester's Readers came nearest to paralleling the Mc- Guffey series, but they were published in the East and failed in shades of difference to meet the social standards of the West. These readers followed the Worcester pro- nunciation, and the West was Websterian. Noah Webster's reader made but little headway in the public schools, and he acknowledges in a long letter of apprecia- tion his debt to McGuffey for his adherence to the Web- ster pronunciation and orthoepy. While the Bible selections were quite similar in all the competing series of readers and the moral tone of Eng- land prevailed in them, it remained for McGuffey, born in the midst of the struggling poor of the new country, baptized in the spirit of a new culture, simple yet of consistent and persistent strain, to compile with under- standing a series of readers. He became unconsciously conscious of the intellectual equipment, of the emotional controls, of the inner hopes and ambitions of the develop- ing civilization of his times and his fellow men. He had for some years taught the children for whom he was compiling his texts. Only a Mark Sullivan or a Hamlin Garland, sympathetic students of the span in American history during which the McGuffey mode so completely fitted the real needs of social, religious, and economic variants fusing into a workable civic unity, could evalu- ate the social contribution which the McGuffey Readers made to western civilization. It comprised a course of instruction which successfully conducted its way between the rugged and sometimes violent abolitionist of the 56 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS North and the cavalier slaveholder of the South, between Protestant and Catholic, between the ever-increasing immigrant and the native born, between the radical sec- tarian and the liberal Jeffersonian. In the analysis of the content of thirty-three early readers the topics occurring most frequently were: first, our ethics and morals; second, God; and third, death. Immortality, history, animals, Niagara Falls, educa- tion, slavery, and riches also played leading roles in every text. A brief genealogy of the leading common school readers contemporaneous and competitive with the McGuffey series would include the New England Primer, first advertised in Benjamin Harris's first American newspaper. Public Occurrence, in 1691. This text was used as the first step from the Hornbook, which was almost universally used in the Northeast from 1691 to 1783. In 1 783 appeared the Webster Speller, which supplied all the intellectual activities of the youth during the poverty- stricken period following the Revolutionary War. Its numerous selected sentences and paragraphs interspersed among or appended to reading lessons, made it a complete text in English. The famous stories of the apple thief who sat in the apple tree and wigwagged his fingers mock- ingly at the farmer as he threw grass and stones, \"The Partial Judge,\" whose bull gored the farmer's ox, the visionary milkmaid who spilled the milk were illustra- tions for lawyers and ministers for a half century. The Franklin Reader, following in 1802, contained new and useful selections of moral lessons adorned with a variety of elegant cuts calculated to make a lasting im- pression on the tender minds of children. In appearance it resembled the New England Primer and contained a biblical history of the world, from the creation to the SOURCES, PEERS, AND COMPETITORS 57 resurrection of Jesus. The Franklin book included hymns and catechisms. Other readers for children were published and used more or less locally for the next twenty-five years. Child's Instructer, 1808, Child's Instructer and Moral Primer ^ 1822, Leavetfs Easy Lessons on Reading, 1823, ^^^ Clinton's Primers in 1 830. Lindley Murray, author of the almost universally used English Grammar, published his English Reader in Boston in 1823, ^^^ issued an Introduction to the English Reader through a Cincinnati publisher, E. H. Flint, in 1833. The Western Reader was edited by James Hall and pub- lished in Cincinnati by Corey and Fairbanks in 1833. S. S. Goodrich's series of readers were published in Louis- ville, Kentucky. The three most widely used textbooks for elementary schools were The New England Primer, Webster's Elemen- tary Spelling Book, and the McGuffey series. The competition for business in the sales of school- books in the new country was keen among eastern pub- lishers, and when Cincinnati became the center of schoolbook publications the East used every known business method to forestall the introduction of western- made books into the schools. The publishers of the Worcester Readers entered suit against the publishers of the McGuffey Readers for damages in the United States District Court under Judge McLean for thirty thousand dollars claiming that the McGuffey Readers violated the Worcester copyright in the use of some of the same selections as those used in the Worcester texts. When the court demanded twenty thousand dollars bail of the complainants and^there seemed little hope of a favorable decision, a compromise was made. The \"pirated parts\" were removed and the 58 WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY AND HIS READERS sum of two thousand dollars paid to the Worcester publishers. Dr. McGufFey was president of Cincinnati College at the time of the suit and was not in any way financially involved, but Catherine Beecher, in published articles about the controversy, fully cleared his literary escutcheon of any dishonor. That McGuffey took advantage of all publications similar to the plan he had already con- ceived for a series of readers as foreshadowed in his \"Methods of Teaching Reading,\" published in London in 1829, ^s ^^^ questioned. Dr. Alcott attacked McGuffey in an article entitled \"Literary Plagiarisms,\" published in the Annals of Educa- tion, a Boston journal. Catherine Beecher, in her defense of Mr. McGuffey, stated that the publishers of the Eclectic Series of schoolbooks, Truman and Smith of Cincinnati, sent to Mr. McGuffey seventy volumes of contemporary school readers, to which McGuffey added thirty. This is possibly an overstatement of the number of publications in school readers and doubtless included a number of spellers, as the transition from the speller- reader of Webster^s Elementary Speller to the reader-speller involved the making of many spellers. Supremacy of Ute HIcGaff ey Readers As SHOWN in the previous pages, other good schoolbooks appeared in rapid succession after 1800. Money was more plentiful, common schools were increasing in num- bers, Webster^ s Elementary Speller was no longer adequate in reading matter for the most primitive settlements and the most backward communities. A new method of teaching reading was demanded. Pestalozzianism was spreading itself to all school centers. Lancastrian's form of school organization made it possible for education to reach large masses of children. Cosmopolitan Ohio Valley was fast becoming an independent empire.
