        "text": "<i>Editor\\'s note: This is the third in a five-part series on Detroit, host of Super Bowl XL on Feb. 5.</i>DEARBORN, Mich. - A glass vial with the dying breath of famed inventor Thomas Edison. The maroon chair, still blood stained, where President Lincoln was assassinated at the Ford Theater. A folding camp bed that Gen. George Washington actually slept in during the Revolutionary War.Henry Ford was a collector.As one of the world\\'s first billionaires, Ford had the money to collect whatever struck his fancy. Instead of expensive works of art or precious gems, however, Ford liked to save pieces of everyday life from the past.\"The reason why a lot of these things still exist is Henry Ford,\" said John Neilson, spokesman for The Henry Ford.\"Here, we present 300 years of history with a wide range of things.\"A quote from Ford explains why he was so interested in his unusual collection: \"When I went to our American history books to learn how our forefathers harrowed the land, I discovered that the historians knew nothing about harrows,\" Ford said. \"Yet our country has depended more on harrows than on guns or speeches. I thought that a history which excluded harrows and all the rest of daily life is bunk and I think so yet.\"Born July 30, 1863, in Dearborn, Mich., Henry Ford was the oldest of six children of first-generation Irish farmers William and Mary Ford.Not rich, but far from poor, the Fords had a secure home life. By all rights, Henry probably should have been a farmer.But at 16 and against the wishes of his father, Ford left the farm for Detroit, where he found work as a mechanic\\'s apprentice. He advanced steadily and became chief engineer at the Edison Illuminating Co.At 24, Ford married Clara Bryant, a friend of his sister\\'s. He called his wife \"the Believer\" because she encouraged his plans to build a horseless carriage from their earliest days together.In his spare time, Ford tinkered with creating a motorized vehicle. And in 1896, he introduced the Quadricycle, a four-wheeled cart with a gasoline engine.Part of his true legacy is that Ford created a mass-produced automobile that was affordable for many common folks. He may have contributed more than any other individual - besides his friend and mentor Thomas Edison - to the reality of the modern world.<h3>Ford innovations</h3>Ford set the industrial world on edge with his production lines for the Model T and $5 for an eight-hour workday, plus profit sharing, unheard of at the time.He also built nearby housing complexes, where workers lived to keep his factories bustling. He built schools, experimental farms, small-town factories and hospitals.He also developed an obsessive collection of historical memorabilia and commonplace items such as toasters, farm machinery, kerosene lamps and steam engines.In 1919, the city of Dearborn decided to widen a number of streets. Ford\\'s beloved boyhood home stood directly in the path of development. It seemed ironic that the house was about to be destroyed due to the rush of traffic that Ford helped create. But Ford found an ideal solution. He moved the entire house and it became the beginning of a village that today contains more than 80 buildings.By 1920, Ford had decided to start a museum that would emphasize industrial history and thereby \"give people a true picture of the development of the country.\"The best way to create this picture, Ford decided, was to have two parts. An exhibit hall would display inventions and artifacts that recorded man\\'s technological and cultural progress. An adjacent outdoor village of residential, commercial and industrial architecture would show how those objects were made and used.He named the entire complex The Edison Institute, in honor of the man who encouraged Ford when he was developing his automobile and who embodied, the carmaker believed, practical genius. Ford greatly admired Edison, who routinely came pretty close to his goal of creating one major invention every six months and a minor one every 10 days. Edison patented 1,097 inventions.<h3>Historic groundbreaking</h3>On Sept. 27, 1928, Edison pushed a small garden spade once owned by botanist Luther Burbank into a block of hardening concrete that would become the cornerstone for Ford\\'s new museum.One year later, on Oct. 21, 1929 scores of dignitaries, including President Herbert Hoover and Edison, attended formal dedication ceremonies inside the partially completed building. The dedication date also commemorated the 50th anniversary of Edison\\'s invention of the first practical incandescent lamp and electric lighting system.In 1943, Ford\\'s only child, Edsel, died of stomach cancer at age 49.Three years later, Henry Ford also died at the Fair Lane family estate in Dearborn.On the last day of his life, Ford visited his son\\'s grave. When he got home, a terrible storm came up and knocked out the lights. That night, without heat, light or phone service, Ford suffered a cerebral hemorrhage.It is ironic that one of the most modern men of his day - and a good friend to the electric light inventor Edison - left the world by the flicker of a candle. Ford died by candlelight and firelight, the same way he was born.After Ford\\'s death in 1947, the institute was renamed The Henry Ford Museum. The Edison Institute name, however, remains the registered name of the entire complex. The centerpiece is a recreation of Edison\\'s Menlo Park Complex, originally in New Jersey, where he created some of his most famous inventions.\"Over 400 patents came out of here,\" said guide Wayne James. \"Thomas Edison\\'s head was literally bursting with ideas. He had a great passion for inventing and was called the Wizard of Menlo Park.\"<h3>Take time to tour</h3>In the best of all possible worlds, it would be nice to spend one day in The Ford Museum and another at Greenfield Village. There is plenty to see at both. The complex also has an IMAX Theatre, the Ford Rouge Factory Tour and Benson Ford Research Center. The museum is divided into areas such as Horse-Drawn Vehicles, Race Cars, Trucks, Heroes of the Sky, Agriculture, Home Arts, Made in America and much more.The Automobile in American Life not only has vehicles but also full-sized billboards and a working drive-in theater. It includes neon restaurant signs from McDonald\\'s and Howard Johnson\\'s, an early Holiday Inn hotel room and a Texaco Gas station.A whole roadside diner is complete with a live server on duty to share museum information. The diner looks so real that visitors sometimes try to order lunch.An exhibit on Presidential Vehicles features the Theodore Roosevelt horse-drawn Brougham, Franklin D. Roosevelt Sunshine Special, Dwight D. Eisenhower Bubbletop and 1961 Lincoln, where JFK was riding when he was assassinated in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.The Reagan presidential limousine is where Reagan took refuge on March 1, 1981, to escape would-be assassin John Hinckley\\'s gunfire. Going into service under President Nixon, the limo is also the car in which President Ford was riding when an attempt was made on his life. This is the last presidential limo that will be preserved.All presidential cars are now destroyed by the Secret Service for security reasons.One of the museum\\'s most recent vehicle acquisitions is the bus Rosa Parks rode on the day she refused to give up her seat.Even years after the 1955 incident shook the country, Montgomery, Ala., had no clue about the significance of that little bus. City transit officials took it out of service in 1971 and sold it to a man who threw the seats down a ravine to make more room for his tools.When the vehicle quit running, wild animals eventually moved in and the bus was used for target practice.Finally, someone realized its historic value and put it on the auction block. The 36-passenger bus was sold in 2001 for $492,000 to the Ford Museum.The Smithsonian had already decided where it would put it but was outbid by Ford. The museum spent another $318,00 restoring the bus to the way it looked on the day Parks boarded it. Visitors are invited to sit in the seat where Parks sparked the modern Civil Rights movement.Parks died in Detroit on Oct. 24, 2005. She and her husband, Raymond, had moved to Detroit in 1957.As part of a recent $200 million renovation, buildings within Greenfield Village were moved to create theme areas. For example, buildings that house artisans are centered on an old mill so you can meander down one street and watch demonstrations by weavers, jewelers, blacksmiths and potters.Main Street includes all the elements of a town: houses, school, church, working restaurants, the Eagle Tavern (with great fried oysters), shops, post office, doctor\\'s office and a carousel.Buildings moved from original locations include the Springfield, Ill., courthouse where Abraham Lincoln practiced law; the Ohio home and bicycle shop considered the \"birthplace of aviation\" where the Wright brothers tinkered with the idea of human flight; and the Ohio boyhood home of William H. McGuffey, author of McGuffey\\'s readers.Other interesting buildings include the Luther Burbank Garden Office, Noah Webster Home, Robert Frost Home, Edison Homestead, George Washington Carver Cabin and Hermitage Slave Quarters.The more than 80 acres at Greenfield Village can mean plenty of walking but the attraction also has a comfortable way to relax and see the site. Visitors can ride in a horse-drawn carriage, a steam-engine train, a paddle wheel boat and, of course, a Model T Ford.<h3>If you go</h3><b>WHERE:</b> The Henry Ford and Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Mich., about 10 miles outside Detroit.<b>MORE INFORMATION:</b> Call the Henry Ford at (800) 835-5237 or Travel Michigan at (888) 784-7328 or Detroit Metro CVB at (800) DETROIT."
