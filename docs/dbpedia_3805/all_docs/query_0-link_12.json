Encountering Darkness\n\nRoger Ingram's peroration broke over the silent dining hall: 'He and such as he are one with the great conquerors, the great scientists, the great poets; they have all of them cried of the unknown:\n\nI will encounter darkness as a bride\n\nAnd hug it in mine arms.'\n\nHe sat down amid applause, directed not to him but to the subject of his speech. It was at a dinner given by the Geographical Faculty of the University of London to a distinguished explorer just back from South America. The explorer's health had been proposed by the Dean of the Faculty, and the Professor of Tropical Geography had been intended to second it. Unfortunately the Professor had gone down with influenza that very day, and Roger had been hastily made to take his place. The other geographical professors, though vocationally more suitable, were both learned and low-voiced, as also were their public addresses. The Dean had refused to subject his distinguished guests, including the explorer, to their instructive whispers. Roger might not be a geographer, but he could make a better speech, and he belonged to the University if to a different faculty, being Professor of Applied Literature. This was a new Chair, endowed beneficently by a rich Canadian who desired at once to benefit the Mother Country and to recall her from the by-ways of pure art to the highroad of art as related to action. Roger had been invited from a post in a Northern University to fill the Chair, largely on the strength of his last book, which was called Persuasive Serpents: studies in English Criticism, and had been read with admiration by twenty-seven persons and with complete misunderstanding by four hundred and eighty-two. Its theme, briefly, was that most English critics had at all times been wholly and entirely wrong in their methods and aims, and that criticism was an almost undiscovered art, being a final austere harmony produced by the purification of literature from everything alien, which must still exist in the subjects of most prose and poetry. However, the salary of the Chair of Applied Literature had decided him to give an example of it in his own person, and he had accepted.\n\nHe lent an ear, when the toast had been drunk, to his wife's 'Beautiful, Roger: he loved it', and to Sir Bernard Travers' murmured 'Hug?'\n\n'I know,' he said; 'you wouldn't hug it. You'd ask it to a light but good dinner and send it away all pale and comfortable. I was good, wasn't I, Isabel? A little purple, but pleasing purple. Pleasing purple for pleased people--that's me after dinner.' He composed himself to listen.\n\nThe explorer, returning thanks, was not indisposed to accept literally the compliments which had been offered him. He touched on ordinary lives, on the conditions of ordinary lives, on the ordinary office clerk, and on the difference between such a man and himself. He painted a picture of South America in black and scarlet; Roger remarked to his wife in a whisper that crude scarlet was the worst colour to put beside rich purple. He enlarged on the heroism of his companions with an underlying suggestion that it was largely maintained by his own. He made a joke at the expense of Roger's quotation, saying that he would never apply 'for a divorce or even a judicial separation from the bride Mr. Ingram has found me.' Roger gnashed his teeth and smiled back politely, muttering 'He isn't worth Macaulay and I gave him Shakespeare.' He would, in short, have been a bore, had he not been himself.\n\nAt last he sat down. Sir Bernard, politely applauding, said: 'Roger, why are the English no good at oratory?'\n\n'Because--to do the fool justice--they prefer to explore,' Roger said. 'You can't be a poet and an orator too: it needs a different kind of consciousness.'\n\nSir Bernard left off applauding; he said: 'Roger, why are the English so good at oratory?'\n\n'No,' Roger said, 'anything in reason, but not that. They aren't, you know.'\n\n'Need that prevent you finding a reason why they are?' Sir Bernard asked.\n\n'Certainly not,' Roger answered, 'but it'd prevent you believing it. I wish I were making all the speeches to-night; I'm going to be bored. Isabel, shall we go?'\n\n'Rather not,' Isabel said. 'They're going to propose the health of the guests. I'm a guest. Mr. Nigel Considine will reply. Who's Mr. Nigel Considine?'\n\n'A rich man, that's all I know,' said her husband. 'He gave a collection of African images to the anthropological school, and endowed a lectureship on--what was it?--on Ritual Transmutations of Energy. As a matter of fact, I fancy there was some trouble about it, because he wanted one man in it and the University wanted another. They didn't know anything about his man.'\n\n'And what did they know of their own?' Sir Bernard put in.\n\n'They knew he'd been at Birmingham or Leeds or somewhere--all quite proper,' Roger answered, 'and had written a book on the marriage rites of the indigenous Caribs or some such people. He wasn't married himself, and he'd never been a Carib--at least not so far as was known. Considine's man was a native of Africa, so the Dean was afraid he might start ritually transmuting energy in the lecture-room.'\n\n'Was Mr. Considine annoyed?' Isabel asked.\n\n'Apparently not, as he's here to-night,' Roger answered. 'Unless he's going to get his own back now. But I never met him, and never got nearer to him than his collection of images.' His voice became more serious, 'They were frightfully impressive.'\n\n'The adjective being emphatic or colloquial?' Sir Bernard asked, and was interrupted by the health of the guests. He was a little startled to find that he himself was still considered important enough to be mentioned by name in the speech that proposed it. He had, in fact, been a distinguished figure in the medical world of his day: he had written a book on the digestive organs which had become a classic, in spite of the ironic humour with which he always spoke of it. He had attended the stomachs of High Personages, and had retired from active life only the year before, after accepting a knighthood with an equally serious irony.\n\nMr. Nigel Considine, on behalf of the guests, thanked their hosts. The chief of those guests, the guest of honour, of honour in actual truth, had already spoken. The intellectual value of the journey which they had celebrated was certainly very high, and very valuable to the scientific knowledge of the world which was so rapidly growing. 'Yet,' the full voice went on, 'yet, if I hesitated at all at the view which the most prominent guest to-night took of his own fine achievement'--Roger's eyes flashed up and down again--'it would have been over one implication which he seemed to make. He set before us the wonder and terror of those remote parts of the world which he has been instrumental in helping to map out. Birds and beasts, trees and flowers, all kinds of non-human life, he admirably described. But the human life he appeared to regard as negligible. There is, it seems, nothing for us of Europe to learn from them, except perhaps how to starve on a few roots or to weave boughs into a shelter. It may be so. But I think we should not be too certain of it. He spoke of some of these peoples as being like children; he will pardon me if I dreamed of an old man wandering among children. For the children are growing, and the old man is dying. We who are here to-night are here as the servants and the guests of a great University, a University of knowledge, scholarship, and intellect. You do well to be proud of it. But I have wondered whether there may not be colleges and faculties of other experiences than yours, and whether even now in the far corners of other continents powers not yours are being brought to fruition. I have myself been something of a traveller, and every time I return to England I wonder whether the games of those children do not hold a more intense life than the talk of your learned men--a more intense passion for discovery, a greater power of exploration, new raptures, unknown paths of glorious knowledge; whether you may not yet sit at the feet of the natives of the Amazon or the Zambesi: whether the fakirs, the herdsmen, the witch-doctors may not enter the kingdom of man before you. But, however this may be, it is not----' He turned gracefully to renewed thanks and compliments, and sat down.\n\n'Dotty,' said Roger, 'but unusual. The transmutation of energy must have been biting him pretty badly. I suppose all that was a get-back.'\n\n'It sounded awfully thrilling,' Isabel said. 'What did he mean?'\n\n'My good child, how should I know?' her husband asked plaintively. 'The witch-doctors may. Fancy a witch-doctor entering the kingdom of man before Sir Bernard! Rude of him. Sir Bernard, what did you think of it?'\n\nSir Bernard turned thoughtful eyes on Roger. 'I can't remember,' he said, 'where I've seen your Mr. Considine before.'\n\n'Perhaps you haven't,' Roger answered, 'in which case you naturally wouldn't remember.'\n\n'O but I have,' Sir Bernard said positively. 'I have; just lately. I remember the way he curved his fingers. I can't think where.'\n\n'An unknown path of glorious knowledge,' Isabel murmured. 'The Dean of Geography looks quite annoyed.'\n\n'He's thinking of the other things that are being brought to fruition,' Roger said, 'all about South America. And of the old man who is dying. D'you think Considine meant any one special? or just as a whole?'\n\n'I don't think it was very nice of him,' Isabel said. 'People might take it the wrong way.'\n\n'Well, if you know how to take it the right way...' her husband protested. 'I suppose he meant something? O heavens, they're beginning again.'\n\nThey were, but also they were approaching the end. The dinner hovered over the point at which empty chairs begin to appear, and people misjudge their moment and tiptoe out at the beginning of a speech, and others reckon the chances of catching their distant friends before they are gone. At this point every dinner contends with destiny, and if it is fortunate concludes in a rapid and ecstatic climax; if it is unfortunate it drags out a lingering death, and enters afterwards a shuddering oblivion. This dinner was fortunate. The National Anthem implored Deity on behalf of royalty, and dismissed many incredulous of both. Sir Bernard accompanied Isabel from the room. Ingram, buttonholed by a colleague or two, was delayed till most of those present had gone, and when he reached the cloakroom counter, he found it, but for himself, deserted. He was waiting a little impatiently for his things when a voice behind him spoke. 'And with what passion, Mr. Ingram,' it said, 'do you yourself encounter darkness?'\n\nRoger turned and saw Nigel Considine. They had been some distance apart at the dinner, and on the same side of the same table, so that Considine's personality had not been in play except through his rather obscure words. Now, as they stood so near, Roger was surprised to find himself taken aback by the other's face and bearing. He was not as a rule easily impressed by those he met; he had far too good an opinion of himself. But here... He saw a man of apparently about fifty, tall, well-proportioned, clean-shaven, with a good forehead and a good chin. But it was neither forehead nor chin that held Ingram; it was the eyes. He thought of the word 'smouldering,' and almost as quickly cursed himself for thinking of it; it was such a hateful word, only it was the most accurate. Something, repressed and controlled but vivid, was living in them; they corresponded, in their flickering intensity, to a voice that vibrated with some similar controlled ardour. The word 'darkness' as it was uttered called to him as it did in the lines he had quoted; he felt as if he were looking at the thing itself. He began to speak, stammered on a syllable, and at last said helplessly: 'I? darkness?'\n\n'You spoke of it familiarly,' the other said. 'You used her language.'\n\nRoger pulled himself together; he answered with a slight hostility. 'If you mean my one Shakespearean quotation----'\n\n'Isn't that just darkness making itself known?' Considine asked. 'Or do you use apposite quotation merely as a social convenience?'\n\nRoger felt ridiculously helpless, as if a believer accustomed to infidels were suddenly confronted by a fanatic of his own creed. But the implied sneer stung him, and he said sharply, 'I don't quote.'\n\n'I believe that--because of your voice,' the other answered. 'You must forgive me if I was offensive; could I help wondering if you really made that rapturous cry your own?'\n\nHe allowed the attendant to help him on with his coat as he spoke. Roger's own things lay neglected on the counter, and the other attendant waited by them. Roger himself was absurdly conscious of the presence of those two auditors. He had often talked highly in similar circumstances before, not theatrically certainly but with a sardonic consciousness that the subservient listeners probably thought him a little mad, with the slight enjoyment of being too much for them, with an equally slight but equally definite and continuous despair that words which meant so much to him meant so little to others. But Considine was speaking perfectly naturally, only always with that sounding depth of significance in his voice.\n\n'I'm glad you liked it,' Roger said foolishly.\n\nConsidine said nothing at all to this, and Roger became instantly conscious of the fatuity of the words. 'Rapturous cry'... 'glad you liked it.' Ass! 'No, really,' he said very hastily, 'I mean... I did really mean it. I mean I do like poetry. Good God!' he thought to himself, 'if my classes could hear me now.'\n\nHatted and gloved, Considine turned to him. 'You are a little afraid of it, I think,' he said. 'Or else you have spoken your beliefs very little.'\n\n'Nobody cares about it,' Roger said, 'and I mock at myself, God forgive me, because there's nothing else to do.'\n\nThey were moving together out of the cloakroom.\n\n'There's much else to do,' Considine answered, 'and I think you believe that; I think you dare encounter darkness.'\n\nHe raised his hand in salutation. Isabel was ready waiting with Sir Bernard, but before he joined them Roger stood still watching Considine going towards the door, and when at last he came to them he was still troubled.\n\n'Darling, what's the matter?' Isabel said. 'You're looking very gloomy.'\n\n'Mr. Considine's been talking of the fakirs,' Sir Bernard said, 'and Roger's wondering if he's one.'\n\nRoger regarded them for a moment and then made an effort to recover himself. 'I don't mind telling you', he answered, 'that Mr. Considine has played me entirely off my own stage in my own play, and I didn't think there was a man living who could do that.'\n\n'Elucidate,' Sir Bernard said.\n\n'I shan't elucidate,' Ingram answered. 'I don't see why I should be the only fellow to encounter darkness. D'you want a taxi, Sir Bernard?'\n\nSir Bernard did, and after having parted from the Ingrams and entered it, he lay back and tried once more to remember where he had seen Considine. It was quite recently, and yet he had a vague feeling that it wasn't recently. An idea of yesterday and an idea of many years ago conflicted in his mind--a man with his hand a little lifted, almost as if it contained and controlled power, a hand of energy in rest. Perhaps, he thought, it was the theme of the speeches which had misled him; they had been listening to talk about distant places, and perhaps his mind had transferred that distance to time. It must have been yesterday or he wouldn't remember so clearly. It couldn't have been long ago or Considine, who was obviously younger than his own sixty odd years, would have changed. His gesture mightn't have changed, all the same--well, it didn't matter. As he got out at his Kensington house he reflected that it would come back, of course; sooner or later the pattern of his knowledge would bring that little detail to his mind. The intellect hardly ever failed one eventually, if one fulfilled the conditions it imposed. But it did perhaps rather ignore the immediate necessities of ordinary life; in its own pure life it overlooked the 'now and here' of one's daily wishes. Still, his own was very good to him; with a happy gratitude to it he came into the library, where he found his son reading letters.\n\n'Hullo, Philip!' he said. 'Had a good evening? How's Rosamond?'\n\n'Very fit, thanks,' Philip answered. 'Did you have a good time?'\n\nSir Bernard nodded, and sat down leisurely. 'Roger told us how he liked poetry,' he said, 'and the explorer told us how he liked himself, and Mr. Nigel Considine told us how he disliked the University.'\n\n'Not in so many words?' Philip asked.\n\n'Contrapuntal,' Sir Bernard said. 'When you've heard as many speeches as I have, you'll find that's the only interest in them: the intermingling of the theme proposed and the theme actual.'\n\n'I can never make out whether Roger's serious,' Philip said. 'He seems to be getting at one the whole time. Rosamond feels it too.'\n\nSir Bernard thought it very likely. Rosamond Murchison was Isabel's sister and Roger's sister-in-law, but only in law. Rosamond privately felt that Roger was conceited and not quite nice; Roger, less privately, felt that Rosamond was stuck-up and not quite intelligent. When, as at present, she was staying with the Ingrams in Hampstead, it was only by Isabel's embracing sympathy that tolerable relations were maintained. Sir Bernard almost wished that Philip could have got engaged to someone else. He was very fond of his son, and he was afraid that the approaching marriage would make, at the times when he visited them, an atmosphere in which, but for brief intervals, he would find it impossible to breathe. Philip's mind by itself was at present earnest and persevering, if a trifle slow. But Philip's mind surrounded and closed in by Rosamond's promised, so far as he could see, to become merely static. He looked over at his son.\n\n'Roger's serious enough,' he said. 'But he still expects to get direct results instead of indirect. He never realizes that the real result of anything is always round the corner.'\n\n'What corner?' Philip asked.\n\n'The universal corner', Sir Bernard said, 'around which we are always on the point of turning--into a street where there are all the numbers except that of the house we're looking for. Good heavens, I'm becoming philosophical. That's the result of University dinners.'\n\n'I don't think I quite follow you,' Philip said.\n\n'It doesn't at all matter,' Sir Bernard answered. 'I only meant that I should like you to believe that Roger's quite serious, and a little unhappy.'\n\n'Unhappy!' Philip exclaimed. 'Roger!'\n\n'Certainly unhappy,' Sir Bernard said. 'He's fanatic enough to believe passionately and not sufficiently fanatical to believe that other people ought to believe. Naturally also, being young, he thinks his own belief is the only real way of salvation, though he'd deny that if you asked him. So he's in a continual unsuccessful emotional conflict, and therefore he's unhappy.'\n\n'But I don't understand,' Philip said. 'Roger never goes to church. What does he believe in?'\n\n'Poetry,' Sir Bernard answered, and 'O--poetry!' Philip exclaimed; 'I thought you meant something religious. I don't see why poetry should make him unhappy.'\n\n'Try living in a world where everyone says to you, quite insincerely, \"O isn't Miss Murchison charming!\"' his father said drily. 'Or alternatively, \"I can't think what you see in her.\" And then----'\n\nHe was interrupted by the entrance of a third person.\n\n'Hullo, Ian,' he broke off; 'how's the Archbishop?'\n\nIan Caithness was the vicar of a Yorkshire parish and Philip's godfather. He was a tall man of about Sir Bernard's age and looked like an ascetic priest, which was more by good luck than by merit, for he practised no extreme austerities. But he took life seriously, and (as often happens) attributed his temperament to his religion. He was therefore not entirely comfortable with other people of different temperaments who did the same thing, and a lifelong friendship with Sir Bernard had probably survived because the other remained delicately poised in a philosophy outside the Church. As a Christian Sir Bernard would have probably irritated his friend intolerably; he soothed him as a--it was difficult to say what; Sir Bernard occasionally alluded to himself as a neo-Christian, 'meaning,' he said, 'like most neos, one who takes the advantages without the disadvantages. As Neo-Platonist, neo-Thomist, and neolithic too, for all I know.' On the rare occasions when Caithness came to London he always stopped in Kensington; on the still rarer when Sir Bernard went to Yorkshire he always went to church.\n\n'Rather bothered,' Caithness said in answer to his friend's greeting. 'The Government papers are making capital out of the massacres of the missions, and demanding expeditions.'\n\n'What massacres?' Philip asked in surprise. 'Being down in Dorset for a couple of weeks has cut away the papers.'\n\n'There've been a number of simultaneous native risings in the interior of Africa,' Caithness answered absently, 'and so far as we can hear the Christian missionaries have been killed. The Archbishop's very anxious that the Government shan't use that as a reason for military operations.'\n\n'Why ever not?' Philip said staring.\n\nCaithness made an abrupt gesture with his hand. 'Because it is their duty, their honour, to die, if necessary,' he said; 'it is a condition of their calling. Because the martyrs of the Church must not be avenged by secular arms.'\n\n'A very unusual view for the Church to take,' Sir Bernard murmured. 'Normally.... It's a curious business altogether. I was told this afternoon that the Khedive has left Cairo for a British warship. Roger's anthropological idols getting active, I suppose.'\n\n'The pressure on Egypt must be pretty bad, then,' Caithness said. 'Well, that isn't our business. We can't, of course, object to any steps the Government think it wise to take in their own interests, so long as they don't use the missions as a reason. The Archbishop has intimated to the Societies who sent them out that no material ought to be given to the papers--photographs or what not.'\n\n'Photographs!' Sir Bernard exclaimed suddenly. 'It was--of course, it was. My mind would have done it, Ian, but thank you for helping it.' He got up and went across the room to a drawer in the lower part of one of the bookcases, whence he returned carrying a number of old yellowish photographic prints. Out of these as he turned them over he selected one, and sat down again.\n\n'Of course,' he said. 'I was looking through these a day or two ago: that was what fidgeted me all the time Considine was telling us about old men and children. And if that isn't Considine... he's got his fingers curved in exactly the same way that he had to-night.'\n\nPhilip moved round and looked over his father's shoulder. The photograph showed two men, one of about seventy, the other some twenty years or so younger, sitting in basket chairs on a lawn with the corner of a verandah showing behind them. The clothes were late Victorian; the whole picture was Victorianly idyllic. Philip saw nothing surprising about it.\n\n'Which is your Mr. Considine?' he asked.\n\n'The one on the right,' Sir Bernard answered. 'It's an exact likeness. When he was speaking tonight he had his head up and his fingers out and coiled just like that. And he wasn't a day older.'\n\n'Who's the other man?' Philip asked.\n\n'The other man', Sir Bernard answered, leaning back in his chair and looking thoughtfully at the photograph, 'is my grandfather. My grandfather died in 1886.'\n\n'Um!' said Philip. 'Then of course it can't be your Mr. Considine. He looks about fifty there, which would make him over a hundred now. His father, I suppose.'\n\n'It's the most unusual likeness I ever saw, if it's his father, or his grandfather, or his great-uncle, or his first, second, third or fourth cousin,' Sir Bernard protested.\n\n'But it must be,' Philip said. 'You don't suggest that this is Considine, do you?'\n\n'The probabilities against it are heavy,' his father allowed. 'But aren't the probabilities against two men looking so much alike also heavy?'\n\nPhilip smiled. 'But where one thing's impossible the other must be true,' he said.\n\n'And which is impossible?' Sir Bernard asked perversely.\n\n'O come,' Philip protested. 'If the other figure here is your grandfather this photograph must have been taken before 1886. So it's impossible--or very, very unlikely that the other man is still alive, and he certainly wouldn't be speaking at a dinner. Is it likely? Do you know who took the photograph, by the way?'\n\n'I took it myself,' the other said. 'With my own little camera. Given me on my twelfth birthday. By my grandfather. I was staying with him for the summer.'\n\n'You don't remember who this other man was?'\n\nSir Bernard shook his head. 'I remember being very pleased with the camera. And I remember that various people stayed at the house. And I photographed every one I could. But what he called himself then I couldn't say.'\n\n'But if it was Considine then he'd be a hundred or more by now! Did he look it?'\n\n'If he looked it,' said Sir Bernard, 'I shouldn't be staring at this photograph. No, Philip, you're right of course. But it's unusual.'\n\n'It must have been,' Philip agreed.\n\n'Though if a man's nerves and stomach were sound,' his father went on, 'and if he kept himself fit, and had no accidents--on my word, mightn't he look fifty when he was really a hundred? Perhaps he's found the elixir of life in the swamps of the Zambesi.'\n\nPhilip felt the conversation was becoming absurd. 'If you take it that it's his father and that there's a strong family likeness, I don't see that there's any difficulty,' he said.\n\n'I know,' Sir Bernard answered. 'But I want there to be a difficulty. So I want that photograph to be a photograph of him and not of his wife's maiden aunt or whatever you suggested. You needn't look superior. It's exactly the way most people come to believe in religion. And if most people think like that, there must be something in it, Cogitatio populi, cogitatio Dei----, and so forth. O well, I shall go to bed. Perhaps I shall meet Mr. Considine again one day and be able to ask him. Good-night, Philip, good-night, Ian. Wake me if the Africans come.'\n\nChapter II. Suicide while of Unsound Mind\n\nPhilip was down the next morning before his father or his godfather, urged by a very strong anxiety to see the papers. Trouble in Africa, as it happened, was possibly going to affect not merely high national and political affairs but his own personal arrangements. Africa, of course, was a large place, and the Christian missions had been established, he had gathered, somewhere in the centre; he wasn't much disturbed over them. But what his father had called 'the pressure on Egypt' was another matter. Philip's own job was engineering, and he had not long before come to an arrangement with a business company known as 'The North African Rivers Development Syndicate,' by which he was to go out to whatever North African Rivers were to be developed as assistant constructing engineer. His chief, a man named Munro, was already out there, somewhere in Nigeria, and in a couple of months Philip was to join him. Meanwhile he was putting in some time at the London offices of the Syndicate, which was run by two brothers named Stuyvesant. But though these were the official heads it was generally understood in the City that the real force behind the company was a much richer man, a certain Simon Rosenberg, who, among his interests in railways and periodicals and fisheries and dye-works, in South African diamonds and Persian oils and Chinese silks, in textiles and cereals and patent-medicines, rubber and coffee and wool, among all these had cast a careless eye on African rivers. In that side of the business Philip wasn't very interested. Sir Bernard had satisfied himself that the company was as sound as could reasonably be expected, and a year's work--or perhaps even two years--would give Philip a start in his profession. Then he would, all being well, come home and marry Rosamond, and see what jobs were going at home. Munro was a fairly big man and if Munro gave him a good word....\n\nIt was consequently something of a shock to him, when he opened the paper, to find two huge headlines competing. On the left a three-column space announced 'Multi-millionaire Found Dead; Rosenberg Shot'; 'Terrible Discovery in Rich Man's Library.' On the right a similar space was filled with: 'Africans Still Advancing'; 'Hordes in Nile Valley'; 'Rumours of Trouble in South Africa'; 'French Defeat in Tangier.' Philip goggled at the thick type, and instinctively tried to read both accounts at once. He was still immersed when Caithness came in, just preceding Sir Bernard.\n\n'I say,' Philip cried to them, 'Rosenberg's shot himself.'\n\n'Rosenberg!' Sir Bernard exclaimed. 'Whatever for?'\n\n'It doesn't say,' Philip answered. 'He was found in the study of his house late last night by the butler, who thought he heard a noise and went to see.'\n\n'And found he had,' Sir Bernard said. 'Nasty for the butler.' He picked up his own paper, and opened it so that he and Caithness could look at it together. But the priest's eyes went first to the columns of African news, and after his first glance Sir Bernard's followed them. They read the brief obscure telegrams, the explanatory comments, the geographical addenda. It seemed that something very unusual was happening in Africa. To begin with, all communication with the interior had completely ceased. Telegraphs had ceased to function, railways had been cut, roads had been blocked. By such roads as had not been blocked there were emerging against all the outer districts hostile bodies of natives, some so small as to be less than a raid, some so large as to mean an invasion, and at that, wherever they appeared, a victorious invasion. The Egyptian army, which had for some weeks been moving leisurely south in order to suppress trouble in the south-east, was now retiring in considerable disorder and even more considerable haste. The French had 'suffered a set-back'; the Spaniards had fallen back towards the coast. Communications with Kenya, with Nigeria, with Abyssinia, with Zanzibar, had ceased. Raids had taken place on the English territories in the South. Air-investigation was being undertaken. The Powers were in touch and were taking necessary steps.\n\n'But what', Caithness said, 'has happened to the air-investigation of the last month?'\n\n'It hasn't come back,' Sir Bernard answered. 'I was talking to a man in the War Office the other night, and he told me that they've sent out aeroplanes by the score, and hardly any have returned. Some have, I suppose, but what they reported is being kept dark. Philip, I think the African Rivers look like being in too much spate for your engineering.'\n\n'But what about Rosenberg?' Philip asked. 'Do you suppose that's what made him kill himself?'\n\n'Did he kill himself?' Sir Bernard said, turning to the other columns. '\"Butler hears shot... letter for the Coroner... police satisfied. Financial comment on page 10\"; yes, well, we can wait till after breakfast for that. Curious, I wonder what decided him. Let's just see whether the Archbishop said anything.'\n\nIt appeared that the previous day had been agitated in both Houses. In the Commons the Prime Minister had announced that forces were being dispatched immediately to punish the various tribes guilty of the abominable massacres at the mission stations. Asked by half a dozen members of the Opposition at once whether he could promise that these expeditions should not develop into costly Imperialistic wars, and whether the action taken was by request of the ecclesiastical authorities, the Prime Minister said that the Archbishop had naturally deprecated further bloodshed but that he and other ecclesiastical authorities had recognized the right of the State to protect its citizens. Asked whether he would undertake that no further territory would be seized, he said that no annexations would be made except by mandate from the League of Nations. Asked whether other Governments were taking action, he said that the House should have all information as soon as he received it.\n\nThis had been in the afternoon. In the evening the Archbishop had asked the Lord Chancellor for permission to make a statement, and had then said that--in consultation with such other Bishops as happened to be in London--he had written at once that morning to the Prime Minister, definitely stating that the ecclesiastical authorities were entirely opposed to the dispatch of punitive expeditions, and begging that none should be sent. The Bishops were of opinion that no secular action should be taken to avenge the martyrdom of the slaughtered missionaries and converts, and wished to dissociate themselves from any such action. A noble and indignant peer--a lately returned Governor-General--asked the Archbishop whether he realized that natives understood nothing but force, and whether he meant that war and the use of force was a sin; whether in short the Archbishop were disloyal or merely stupid. The Archbishop had referred the noble peer to the theologians for discussions and determinations of the use of force. The use of force was an act which was neither good nor evil in itself; the use of force in circumstances like the present appeared to himself and his colleagues a breach of Christian principles. Another peer demanded whether, if the Government were to dispatch punitive expeditions, the Archbishop would seriously accuse them of acting in an unchristian manner? The Archbishop said that the noble peer would remember that Christianity assumed a readiness for martyrdom as a mere preliminary to any serious work, and that he was sure no noble lord who happened to hear him and was a Christian would be unwilling to suffer tortures and death without wishing a moment's pain to his enemies. He apologised to the House for reminding them of what might be called the first steps in a religion of which many of his hearers were distinguished professors. The House rose at nine minutes past seven.\n\n'Dear me,' said Sir Bernard, putting down his paper.\n\nPhilip looked up from his own with a faint but perplexed smile. 'Is this you, sir?' he said to Caithness.\n\n'No', Caithness answered, 'I don't think so. It seems pretty obvious, after all.'\n\n'I had no idea the Archbishop was so venomous,' Sir Bernard said: 'I think he certainly must believe in God. Mythology always heightens the style.'\n\nCaithness said, rather sombrely, 'Of course the Prime Minister will win in the end.'\n\n'I should think it most likely,' Sir Bernard said. 'What was it Gibbon said--\"all religions are equally useful to the statesman\"!--Still, you've done your best. What do you want to do to-day?'\n\n'I may as well go back to Yorkshire,' Caithness answered doubtfully. 'I've been all the use I can be.'\n\n'O nonsense,' Sir Bernard said. 'Stay a little, Ian; we see precious little of you anyhow. Stay till the African army lands at Dover, and then we'll all go to Yorkshire together--you and I, and Philip and Rosamond, and Roger and Isabel.'\n\nPhilip winced. His father's remark struck him as merely being in bad taste. It was too remote even to be a joke. He said coldly 'I suppose I'd better go to the office?'\n\n'I think you should,' Sir Bernard assented. 'You'll be perfectly useless, of course. If it's a case of Africa for the Africans, they'll want to develop their own rivers, and as the Syndicate depended on Rosenberg it may not be able to develop itself. But you can find out the immediate prospects. The inquest will be to-morrow. What about coming to the inquest?'\n\n'Why, are you going?' Philip asked.\n\n'Certainly I am going,' Sir Bernard answered. 'I met Rosenberg quite a number of times, and I've always wondered about him. His wife died a couple of years ago, and I fancy he's been going to pieces ever since. No, Ian, not because of monogamy; no, Philip, not because of love. I'm sorry; I apologize to both of you, but it wasn't. It was because he'd developed a mania for making, for her, the most wonderful collection of jewels in the world. He had them too--marvellous! Tiaras and bracelets and necklaces and pendants and earrings and so on. I met her occasionally--not so often as him, but sometimes, and she looked not merely like the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars, but like the other eleven million that Joseph didn't know about. She was a magnificent creature, tall and rather large and dark, and she carried them off magnificently. In fact, she was a creation in terms of jewellery, the New Jerusalem turned upside down so that the foundations showed. And then she died.'\n\n'Couldn't he have still gone on collecting jewels?' Caithness asked scornfully.\n\n'Apparently not,' Sir Bernard said mildly. 'He saw them on her, you see; they existed in relation to her. And when she died they fell apart--he couldn't find a centre for them. They were useless, and so he was useless. At least I suspect that's what happened. You didn't see her, so you won't understand.'\n\nCaithness gave a short laugh. 'A noble aim,' he said.\n\n'Well, it was his,' Sir Bernard remonstrated, still mildly. 'And really, Ian, if it comes to comparisons, I don't know that it was worse than collecting poems, like Roger, or events, like me. I might say, or souls like you, because you do collect souls for the Church just as Rosenberg collected jewels for his wife, don't you?'\n\n'The Church doesn't die,' Caithness said.\n\n'I know, I know,' Sir Bernard answered. 'But that only means you're more fortunate than Rosenberg in preferring a hypothesis to a person. At least, perhaps you are: it's difficult to say. I've a good mind to ask Roger to come to the inquest too.'\n\n'It seems rather gruesome,' Philip said, hesitating.\n\n'O my dear boy,' Sir Bernard protested, 'don't let's be adjectival. Here's a rich man shot himself because of a difficulty with life. Is it really gruesome to want to know what that difficulty is and how much like the rest of our difficulties it was? But at your age you daren't trust your own motives, and you're probably right. At mine one has to trust them or one couldn't enjoy them, and there's not much opportunity to do anything else.'\n\nPersuaded either by such maxims or from motives of equal potency both Philip and Roger did actually accompany Sir Bernard the next day, though Caithness refused. The court was certainly crowded but they managed, through some diplomatic work by Sir Bernard, to get in. The coroner, a short hairy official, dealt with everyone in the same sympathetic manner.\n\nThe evidence was brief and explicit. The butler who had found the body and summoned the police was called. His master (he said) had had one visitor that evening, a Mr. Considine (Sir Bernard looked at Roger, who sat up sharply). After Mr. Considine's departure, about twelve, his master had called him in to witness his signature to a document, and had then dismissed him. It had been about a quarter of an hour later when he had thought he heard the sound of a shot in the study. He had gone there... and so on through the difficult time that followed. The police described their arrival, their examination. Doctors described the nature of the wound. Mr. Considine was called.\n\nSir Bernard lay back in his seat and studied the witness, mentally comparing him to the photograph. It was absurd that they should be so much alike, he thought, when they must, of course, be different. He gazed at him with an inexplicable curiosity that seemed strangely to become even more vivid when by chance Considine's eyes, passing over the court, as he moved to the witness-box, met his. Roger was leaning eagerly forward, and a glance of recognition went between him and Considine. Philip felt and showed no particular interest.\n\nConsidine explained the reason for his visit. He had been on his way home after a dinner and had passed the deceased's house; on an impulse he had determined to call, chiefly because he had been for some time... disturbed... about his state of mind. Deceased had, as people said, 'lost hold'; he had no hope and no desire. He had lost interest alike in his business and in his amusements.\n\n'Can you suggest what caused this breakdown?' the coroner interrupted. 'His health--the doctor has told us--was quite good?'\n\n'His health was good,' Considine answered, 'but his health had no purpose, or rather that purpose had been destroyed. He had made for himself an image, and that image had been removed. His wife while she lived had been the centre of that image; the jewels in which he clothed her completed it. She died; he had no children, and he had not enough energy to discover some other woman whom he could display in a like manner. He had externalized in that adorned figure all his power and possession; it was his visible power, his acknowledged possession. The jewels themselves, magnificent as they were, were not sufficient. Also I think there returned on him something of a childish fear; he was terrified of the destruction that haunts life.'\n\n'You tried to cheer him up?' the coroner said.\n\nConsidine paused for a moment. 'I tried,' he said slowly, 'to persuade him to live by his own power rather than by what could be at best only properties of it. I tried to persuade him to live from the depth of his wound rather than to pine away in the pain of it; to make the extent of his desolation the extent of his kingdom. But I failed.'\n\n'I see--yes,' said the coroner vaguely. 'You thought he needed bringing out of himself?'\n\nConsidine considered again, a longer pause. 'I thought he needed to find himself,' he said at last, 'and all of which himself was capable. But I could not work on him.'\n\n'Quite, quite,' said the coroner. 'I'm sure the sympathy of the Court is with you, Mr. Considine, in your regrets that your efforts were unavailing. I've no doubt that you did all that you could, but there it is--if a man won't or can't bestir himself, mere talk won't help him. Thank you, Mr. Considine.'\n\n'Good heavens!' Sir Bernard said to Roger in a smothered voice, '\"mere talk\"! Mere----'\n\nThe letter for the coroner was now produced, but carried things little further. It stated simply that Simon Rosenberg took all responsibility for the act of suicide, to which he had been driven by the full realization of the entire worthlessness of human existence. 'We may, I think,' the coroner interrupted himself to say, 'mark that sentence as evidence of a very abnormal state of mind.' Unconscious of the lowering glare which Roger turned on him, he went on: 'There is enclosed with this brief letter another document which purports to be the deceased's last will and testament. I have had the opportunity of submitting it to the deceased's solicitors, Messrs. Patton & Fotheringay, and in order that you may have all the evidence possible on deceased's state of mind before you I shall now read it.'\n\nHe proceeded to do so. It began normally enough, followed up this opening with a few legacies to servants, clerks, and acquaintances, and then in one magnificent clause left the whole of the rest of the estate, real and personal, shares, jewels, houses, lands, and everything else from the smallest saltcellar in the farthest shooting-lodge to the largest folio in the London library, to two second cousins, Ezekiel and Nehemiah Rosenberg, defined with all necessary exactitude as the grandchildren of the deceased's grandfather's younger brother Jacob Rosenberg.\n\n'And I do this,' the strange document ran on, 'because they have followed in the way of our fathers, and kept the Law of the Lord God of Israel, and because though I do not know whether there is any such God to be invoked or any such way to be trodden, yet I know that everything else is despair. If this wealth belongs to their God let him take it, and if not let them do what they choose and let it die.' Nigel Considine and the Grand Rabbi were named as executors, with a hope that though they had not been consulted they would not refuse to act.\n\nThere was a prolonged silence in court. Roger Ingram thought of several verses in Deuteronomy, a line or two of Milton, and a poem of Mangan's. Sir Bernard wished he knew Nehemiah and Ezekiel Rosenberg. Philip thought it was a very peculiar way of making a will. The coroner proceeded to explain to the jury the difference between felo-de-se and suicide while of unsound mind, with a definite leaning towards the second, of which (he suggested) 'despair--to use the word chosen by the deceased--was, anyhow when carried to such an abnormal extent as the letter and will together seem to indicate, perhaps in no small measure a proof.' The jury, after a merely formal consultation, in the rather uncertain voice of their foreman agreed. The court rose.\n\nOn the steps outside, Sir Bernard and Roger instinctively delayed a little and were rewarded by seeing Considine come out. He was listening to a round-faced man who was probably either Mr. Patton or Mr. Fotheringay, but in a moment he noticed Roger, waved to him, and presently, parting from his companion, came across.\n\n'So, Mr. Ingram,' he said, as he shook hands, 'I didn't expect to see you here.'\n\n'No,' Roger answered; 'as a matter of fact I came with----' he completed an explanation with an introduction.\n\n'But, of course I know Sir Bernard's name,' Considine said. 'Isn't it he who explained the stomach?'\n\n'Temporarily only,' Sir Bernard answered.\n\nConsidine shrugged. 'While man needs stomachs,' he said, 'which may not be for so very much longer. A very ramshackle affair at present, don't you think?'\n\n'In default of a better', Sir Bernard protested, 'what would you have us do?'\n\n'But are we in default of a better?' Considine asked. 'Surely we're not like that poor wretch Rosenberg who couldn't live by his imagination, but died starved, for all his stomach and his mind.'\n\n'So far', Sir Bernard said, 'both the stomach and the mind seem normally necessary to man.'\n\n'O so far!' Considine answered, 'and normally! But it's the farther and the abnormal to which we must look. When men are in love, when they are in the midst of creating, when they are in a religious flame, what do they need then either with the stomach or the mind?'\n\n'Those', Sir Bernard said, 'are abnormal states from which they return.'\n\n'More's the pity,' Roger said suddenly. 'It's true, you know. In the real states of exaltation one doesn't seem to need food.'\n\n'So,' said Considine, smiling at him. 'The poets have taught you something, Mr. Ingram.'\n\n'But one returns,' Sir Bernard protested plaintively, 'and then one does need food. And reason,' he added, almost as an afterthought.\n\nConsidine was looking at Roger. 'Will you say that one must?' he asked in a lower voice; and 'O how the devil do I know?' Roger said impatiently. 'I say that one does, but I daren't say that one must. And it's folly either way.'\n\n'Don't believe it,' Considine answered, his voice low and vibrating. 'There's more to it than that.'\n\nThe words left a silence behind them for a moment, as if they were a summons. Roger kicked the pavement. Philip waited patiently. Presently Sir Bernard said, 'Do you know the legatees by any chance, Mr. Considine?'\n\nConsidine's eyes glowed. 'Now there,' he said, 'if you like irony you have it. Yes, I know them--at least I know of them. I knew the family very well once. They are strict Jews, living in London because they are too poor to return to Jerusalem. They live in London and they abominate the Gentiles of London. They are fanatically--insanely, you would say--devoted to the tradition of Israel. They live, almost without food, Sir Bernard, studying the Law and nourished by the Law. They are the children of a second birth indeed, and they exist in the other life to which they were born. What do you think they will do with Simon Rosenberg's fortune and Simon Rosenberg's jewels?'\n\n'They could, I suppose, refuse it,' Sir Bernard said.\n\n'Couldn't they use it to improve conditions in Palestine?' Philip asked, willing to appear interested.\n\nConsidine looked at Roger, who said, 'I don't know the tradition of Israel. Are jewels and fortunes any use to it?'\n\n'Or will they think so?' Considine answered. 'I do not know. But it was a Jew who saw the foundations of the Holy City splendid with a beauty for which the names of jewels were the only comparison. We think of jewels chiefly as wealth, but I doubt if the John of the Apocalypse did, and I doubt if the Rosenbergs will. Perhaps he saw them as mirrors and shells of original colour. However, I suppose, as one of the executors, it will be my business to find out soon.'\n\n'It's extraordinarily interesting,' Sir Bernard said. 'Do, my dear Mr. Considine, let us know. Come and dine with me one day. I've something else I want to ask you.'\n\nOn the point of making his farewells Considine paused.\n\n'Something you want to ask me?' he said.\n\n'A mere nothing,' Sir Bernard answered. 'I should like to know what relation you are to a photograph of you that I took fifty years ago.'\n\nRoger stared. Philip moved uneasily; his father did put things in the most ridiculous way.\n\n'A photograph of me,' Considine repeated softly, 'that you took fifty years ago...?'\n\n'I do beg your pardon,' Sir Bernard said. 'But that's what it looks like, though (unless you've improved the stomach out of all knowledge) it probably isn't. I wouldn't have bothered you if other subjects for discussion--jewels, digestion, and the tradition of Israel--hadn't cropped up. But unless you take that unfortunate coroner's view of \"mere talk\", do be kind and come.'\n\nConsidine smiled brilliantly. 'I do a little,' he said, 'but I allow it is a purification, a ritual and actual purification of the energies. I'm rather uncertain how much longer I shall be in England for the present, but if it's at all possible... Will you write or telephone or something in a day or two? My address is 29, Rutherford Gardens, Hampstead.'\n\n'Hallo,' Roger said, 'we're up that way. My embalming workshop's there,' he added sardonically.\n\nSir Bernard turned his head, a little surprised. Roger caught his eyes and nodded towards Considine.\n\n'He knows,' he said. 'I embalm poetry there--with the most popular and best-smelling unguents and so on, but I embalm it all right. I then exhibit the embalmed body to visitors at so much a head. They like it much better than the live thing, and I live by it, so I suppose it's all right. No doubt the embalmers of Pharaoh were pleasant enough creatures. They weren't called to any nonsense of following a pillar of fire between the piled waters of the Nile.'\n\n'It's burning in you now,' Considine said, 'and you are on the threshold of a doorway that the Angel of Death went in--not yours.'\n\n'If I could believe it----' Roger said. 'Ask me to dine too, Sir Bernard. I want to ask Mr. Considine questions about Paradise Regained.'\n\nChapter III. The Proclamation of the High Executive\n\nBy the time that Philip arrived home that evening the wildest rumours about Africa were being spread. At the office things had been during the last few days as bad as he had feared they might be, and he had been as useless as Sir Bernard had expected. Nothing had been heard from or of Munro for some weeks. Rosenberg's suicide and, even more distressingly, his will, had startled and bothered the Stuyvesants to an indescribable degree. The motive power behind them, the object of motion in front, had both disappeared in blood; and no-one had the least idea what would happen. The Rosenberg legatees had been traced by mid-day; they were living in small upper rooms in Houndsditch, served by an old woman of their race. Extraordinary efforts had been made to procure interviews with them; unsuccessfully, since they merely refused to speak. There were, certainly, in the afternoon papers, sketches of them, but that was hardly the same thing. Even Governments were by way of being interested; high personages gazed at the reproductions dubiously. The two brothers looked as if they might be incapable of realizing the responsibilities of their present position. Two old, bearded, and violent faces stared out at England from journalistic pages. England stared back at them, and for the most part, quite reasonably, abandoned its interest. The Chief Rabbi also refused to be interviewed. Mr. Considine was interviewed, very unsatisfactorily, since he in effect refused to foreshadow, forestall, or foretell anybody's intention. Philip read certainly that Mr. Considine had said that he was sure that there was no need for any public anxiety, that good sense (a quality which the Jews, he was reported to have declared, possessed to a marked degree) would distinguish the actions of the Rosenberg brothers, and that in the present critical times all minor racial prejudices must be set aside. By which Philip understood him to mean that racial prejudice in regard to Africa must swallow up the rest, as the serpent of Moses swallowed the others. He didn't feel quite convinced that Considine who on the steps of the coroner's court had exclaimed to Roger that a pillar of fire was burning in him had said all that. In the other columns of the papers racial prejudice was getting a firm hold.\n\nThere were articles by anthropologists, with diagrams of negro heads; articles by explorers, with photographs of kraals; articles by statisticians, with columns of figures; articles by historians, with reproductions of paintings of Vasco da Gama, Thotmes III, Chaka, and others; articles by bishops and famous preachers on missions, with photographs of Christian negroes, converted and clothed; articles by politicians on the balance of power in Africa with maps curiously tinted; articles by military experts on possible strategy, with maps lined and blobbed. There were letters from peace champions and war invalids. There were, in short, all the signs of the interest which the public was believed to feel. Philip at last abandoned them and fell back on consideration.\n\nExcept for that one remark on the pillar of fire, and the mysterious allusion to the foundations of the New Jerusalem, he hadn't noticed anything special in Considine's conversation, but those two did rather stand out. If Considine had not obviously been a... well, a gentleman, Philip would have suspected him of belonging to the Salvation Army. Of course, he had been talking to Roger, and Roger's own language was apt to be unbalanced. There were moments when Philip, what with his father and Roger, and even his godfather, with his refusal to allow martyrs to be avenged, felt that he was surrounded by eccentrics. He thought with relief and delight of Rosamond; Rosamond wasn't eccentric. She was so right, so peaceful, so beautifully the thing. She was a kind of centre, and all the others vibrated in peculiar poses on the circumference. She herself had no circumference, Philip thought, ignorant of how closely he was striving after St. Augustine's definition: 'God is a circle, whose centre is everywhere and His circumference nowhere.' She was small and dainty and she moved, as it were, in little pounces. And yet she was so strong; it was as if strength pretended to be weak. No, it wasn't that, for after all, she did need protection--his protection; she was strong enough to need no other and weak enough to need his. Philip took that decision quite seriously; in the economy of the universe he was not perhaps finally wrong. For he was very innocent in love, and the awful paradoxes which exist in that high passion and are an outrage to rational argument were natural to him rather because of his innocence than because of his egotism. That innocence might turn to egotism; that candid belief of his heart be hardened by his pride and turned from a simplicity to a stupidity. But at the moment he was very much in love, and in love he had not yet reached an age capable of sin. He was still a child of the new birth; maturity of intellect as of morals was far distant.\n\nSuch a childhood he owed partly, surprised as he would have been to hear it, to his father. The placid irony of Sir Bernard's contemplation of life distilled itself over the wisdom of this world equally with that of every other. Dante was to him no more ridiculous than Voltaire; disillusion was as much an illusion as illusion itself. A thing that seemed had at least the truth of its seeming. Sir Bernard's mind refused to allow it more but it also refused to allow it less. It was for each man to determine how urgent the truth of each seeming was. Philip had not been discouraged from accepting the seemings of his own world, of school, University, and business; but he had been subtly encouraged to give free play to his own individual phenomena. A thing might not be true because it appeared so to him, but it was no less likely to be true because everyone else denied it. The eyes of Rosamond might or might not hold the secret origin of day and night, but if they apparently did then they apparently did, and it would be silly to deny it and equally silly not to relish it. Sir Bernard had never said this in so many words. But the atmosphere which he created was one in which such spiritual truths could thrive unhindered, and their growth depended upon their own instinctive strength.\n\nSerenely unconscious of what he owed, Philip felt his own serious growth wiser than that cool air of gracious scepticism. He thought his passion was hidden from it as from the sun, when in fact it throve in it as in the soft rains. He said nothing of Rosamond's eyes--which certainly were not, to Sir Bernard, anything remarkable--to his father, and supposed that the unformulated gospel they taught him was also a secret. He said nothing of them to anyone indeed, not having, nor caring to have, that tendency towards talk which marked his future brother-in-law. Roger, out of sheer interest, had given him every opportunity, and was rather disappointed that not one was taken. 'I'm sure I talked enough about you,' he complained to Isabel.\n\n'You're more interested in metaphysics,' she said. 'Philip's just a believer; you're a theologian.'\n\n'I've a more complex matter to study,' he said. 'If I were a poet I would make the Matter of Isabel equal to the Matter of France and the Matter of Britain.'\n\n'My honour wars with my credulity,' she answered. 'I'm not really more interesting than Rosamond but I like to think I am.'\n\n'I don't think Sir Bernard approves of Rosamond,' Roger said meditatively. 'Why not, do you suppose? Can he really not think her good enough? Does he secretly adore Philip? My son, my son, and all that?'\n\nIsabel was silent for a minute; then she said: 'I'm awfully tempted to tell you, Roger, but perhaps I won't. I do think I know what he feels, but it'd be rather hard on Rosamond to talk of it, wouldn't it?'\n\n'Devil!' said Roger. 'You'd see your husband die of an insatiable curiosity rather than sully your integrity by giving him a crust of fact. You're as bad as the other Isabella--the one in Measure for Measure; you're avaricious of chastity. I don't want to be nice; I want to be malign and malevolent--and omniscient. Very well; have it your own way. I shall now go and lecture on Pure Women in Literature, with sub-sardonic allusions to you, Shakespeare's Isabella, and Mr. Richardson's Pamela. And I shall be back, in a bad temper, to tea.'\n\nIt was to tea on the same day that, when he did return, he found Philip had invited himself, having abandoned the distracted office for an hour with Rosamond. Isabel had come in from an afternoon's walk, and when they all met in the drawing-room it was she who said: 'Roger, you're looking very serious. What's the matter, darling? Didn't they remember who Pamela was, or did they think she was nice, or what?'\n\nIngram stretched himself in an armchair. 'Have any of you', he asked, 'seen an evening paper?'\n\n'Not since two o'clock,' Philip said. 'Is there something important?'\n\n'That', Roger answered, 'depends on what you think important. There's an African proclamation.'\n\n'What!' Philip was so surprised that his eyes left Rosamond's hair to rest on the newspaper that Roger was holding. 'Is there really? What does it say?'\n\n'It says that the Socratic method is done for,' Roger said seriously. A small frown appeared on Rosamond's face and went away again. Philip, without frowning, conveyed the impression of a frown and said: 'Do be serious. It's important to me to know. What does it say?'\n\n'It says exactly what I've told you,' Roger said, more sardonically. 'It says you think too much, Philip, and it says your father is just the last kind of mistake. It's no use blaming me. I didn't write it. I'm not even sure that I know what it means.'\n\nIsabel, taking a sandwich, said: 'Read it, Roger. The Socratic method doesn't really help one to choose a frock. I know because I tried it once. I said, \"Must not a colour which suits me, and a cut that I admire, be desirable? It would seem so, Socrates.\" And yet it wasn't. Do read it.'\n\nPhilip, having thus been defrauded of his protest, waited in the silence of injured decency to hear more. Rosamond looked at him sympathetically. Roger dropped two of his papers, opened the third, and read.\n\n'Alleged Statement by African Leaders. Document received by Foreign Office and Press. Where is the High Executive? African Aims Reported to be Disclosed. By the mid-day post a document was received at the offices of all the London newspapers which is, with all reserves in regard to its authenticity, given below. The editors of the London papers have been in communication with the Foreign Office, and learn that a precisely similar document has been received there. Not only so, but the Foreign Offices and the Press of other European countries have also been communicated with in the same way. In Paris and Madrid this alleged manifesto has already been published, and the British Government, after consultation with the editors, has raised no objection to its publication here. If it is genuine--a question which is being investigated--it pretends to offer some kind of explanation of the late remarkable events in Africa. The manifesto, or proclamation, as it might be called, is as follows:\n\n'\"In the name of the things that have been and are to be, willed and fated, in the name of the gods many and one, the Allied Supremacies of Africa, acting by the will and speaking by the voice of the High Executive, desire to communicate to the rest of the world the doctrine and purpose of the cause in which they are engaged. They announce their immediate purpose to be the freeing of the African continent from the government and occupation of the white race; their farther purpose to be the restoration to mankind of powers which have been forgotten or neglected, and their direction to ends which have hitherto been unproclaimed. They announce their profound belief that, as to the European peoples in the past, so to themselves in the future the conscious leadership of mankind belongs. It is not an imposed but an emerging leadership, superior to its disciples as to its enemies because of the conscious potentialities which exist in it. The potentialities of that superiority do not attempt to deny the capacities of Europe in their own proper achievements. The High Executive of the African Allies desires, in its first public summons to the creative powers of the world, to honour the immortal finalities of the past. It salutes the intellect, the philosophies, the science, the innumerable patterns of Europe. But it asserts that the great age of intellect is done, nor was the intellect ever that power which its disciples have been encouraged to believe. The prophets of Africa, who are not found only among its own peoples but include many of other races both in the past and in the present--the prophets of Africa have seen that mankind must advance in the future by paths which the white peoples have neglected and to ends which they have not understood. Assured that at this time the whole process of change in mankind, generally known as evolution, is at a higher crisis than any since mankind first emerged from among the great beasts and knew himself; assured that by an equal emergence from intellectual preoccupations, the adepts of the new way have it in their power to lead, and all mankind has it in its power to follow, not certainly by the old habits of reason but by profounder experiments of passion, to the conquest of death in the renewed ecstasy of vivid experience; assured of these things the Allied Supremacies appeal to the whole world for belief and discipleship and devotion.\"'\n\nRoger paused and looked up. Rosamond, again frowning a little, was eating cake. Philip was listening with his mouth open and his eyes staring. Isabel was attending with a serious and serene care. Roger grinned at her and resumed.\n\n'\"The peoples of Africa appear before the world in arms, in order to claim from the sovereign authorities of Europe that freedom which is their due and their necessity on the one hand; on the other their privilege and opportunity. They will and they are fated to achieve that freedom. But their arms are of defence and not of aggression. They are willing to concede all possible time and convenience to the Powers of Europe. They no more desire to waste their energies and those of their opponents on war than on any other lower exterior imitation of heroic interior conquest. They are not anxious that the discipleship of the European imagination should be made more difficult by the mundane stupidities of dispute and battle. But the administration of Africa by the white race is now a thing of the past--to be remembered only as intellectual sovereignty will be remembered, a necessary moment that was willed and was fated and has ceased.\n\n'\"To those among the peoples of Europe who know that their lives have origin and nourishment in the great moments of the exalted imagination, the High Executive offers salute and recognition\"'--Roger's voice began to linger over the words--'\"to all who owe their devotion to music, to poetry, to painting and sculpture, to the servants of every more than rational energy; greater than those and more numerous, to all who at this present moment exist in the exchanged or unexchanged adoration of love, it calls more especially. There, perhaps more surely and swiftly than in any other state of being outside the transmuting Way, can the labour of exploration be begun; there is the knowledge, the capacity, the herald apprehension of victory. These visionaries are already initiate; they know in themselves the prophecy of the conquest of death. To all such the High Executive appeals, with ardour and conviction. Believe, imagine, live. Know exaltation and feed on it; in the strength of such food man shall enter into his kingdom.\n\n'\"The High Executive permits itself to offer to the Christian Churches its congratulations on the courage and devotion of those their servants who have sustained death by martyrdom. Convinced as it is that the Churches have, almost from the beginning, been misled by an erring principle, it nevertheless honours those martyrs as sublime if misguided instances of that imagination which it is its purpose to make known to mankind and which the rites and dogmas of the Christian religion dimly proclaim. It is assured by its belief in man and by the exalted courage of those martyrs that they would have desired no other end, and it takes full responsibility for having advised its august sovereigns that they could bestow on Christian missionaries no more perfect gift.\n\n'\"The High Executive will be prepared to send representatives at any time to any place fixed by the Powers of Europe or by any of them; or to enter into negotiations in any other way that the Powers may desire. It will assume the fixing of such time and place or the opening of such negotiations to be a guarantee of safe-conduct for its representatives, and it will be prepared to suspend as soon as possible the military, naval, and aerial operations upon which it is engaged.\n\n'\"Given in London, by direction of the High Executive, in the First Year of the Second Evolution of Man.\"'\n\nRoger stopped. Almost before his voice had ceased, Rosamond said: 'Philip, darling, you haven't eaten anything. Have a cake?' Philip for once took no notice. Roger said: 'About a thousand words--a little more. Allowing for recapitulations in its extremely rhetorical style--the High Executive hasn't studied the best models--say, seven-fifty. Either pure waste or the most important seven-fifty words I've ever read.'\n\n'I haven't got the hang of it,' Philip said in bewilderment. 'What does it mean?'\n\n'It--what did it say?--it calls to you more especially, Philip,' Roger went on. 'It salutes you, because you have the vision of the conquest of death in the exchanged adoration of love. It expects you to do something about it all at once.' His eyes lingered on Isabel, and then became abstracted. He sighed once and got to his feet. 'I'll have some more tea,' he said. 'The cup that cheers but not inebriates after words that inebriate but do not cheer.'\n\nIsabel, pouring out the tea, said: 'Don't they cheer you, dearest?'\n\n'Not one bit,' Roger answered. He leaned gloomily against the mantelpiece, and after a pause said suddenly, 'Well, Rosamond, and what do you make of it?'\n\nRosamond answered coldly, 'I wasn't listening. I don't think it's very nice, and really, Roger, I don't see why you need have read it.'\n\n'The High Executive of the African peoples asked me to,' Roger said perversely. 'What don't you like about it--giving up intellect or having the vision of the conquest of death?'\n\n'I think you're simply silly, Roger,' Rosamond exclaimed and stood up. 'And if it was written by a lot of... a lot of Africans, that makes it more disgusting than ever. I don't think it ought to have been printed.'\n\nIsabel spoke before Roger, sadistically watching Rosamond, could reply. 'Do you think it's authentic, Roger?' she asked.\n\n'My dear, how can I guess?' her husband answered, more placably; then he shifted his position, and added: 'It's authentic enough in one way; there is something more.'\n\nIsabel smiled at him. 'But need we think we didn't know it already?' she asked softly. 'It isn't very new, is it?'\n\nHe was looking across the room at the high bookcase.\n\n'If they came alive,' he murmured, 'if they are alive--all shut up in their cases, all nicely shelved--shelved--shelved. We put them in their places in our minds, don't we? If they got out of their book-cases--not the pretty little frontispieces but the things beyond the frontispieces, not the charming lines of type but the things the type means. Dare you look for them, Isabel?' As he still stared at the bookcase his voice altered into the deeper sound of a subdued chant.\n\n'He scarce had ceased when the superior fiend\n\nWas moving towards the shore\n\n'Hid in its vacant interlunar cave\n\n'And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake.'\n\nRosamond said sharply. 'Do be quiet, Roger. You know I hate your quoting.'\n\n'Quoting!' Roger said, 'quoting!' and stopped in despair. He looked at Philip as if asking him whether he couldn't do something.\n\nPhilip didn't see the look; he was meditating. But the silence affected him at last; he raised his eyes, and was on the point of speaking when Rosamond interrupted, slipping her hand through his arm. 'Don't talk about it any more, darling,' she said; 'it's too horrid. Look, shall I come as far as the Tube with you?'\n\nHe stirred--rather heavily, Roger thought--but as their eyes met he smiled back at her, and only Isabel's hand prevented her husband from again quoting the High Executive on the exchanged adoration of love. It was therefore with a slight but unusual formality that farewells were spoken, and Philip departed for the station.\n\nRoger remained propped against the mantelpiece, but he said, viciously, 'She \"wasn't listening\"!'\n\nIsabel looked at him a little anxiously. 'Don't listen too carefully, darling,' she said. 'It's not just cowardice--to refuse to hear some sounds.'\n\nHe pulled himself upright. 'I must go and work,' he said. 'I must exquisitely water the wine so that it may be tolerable for weak heads.' By the door he paused. 'Do you remember your Yeats?' he asked.\n\n'What rough beast, its hour come round at last,\n\nSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?\n\nI wonder. Also I wonder where exactly Bethlehem is, and what are the prodigies of the birth.'\n\nChapter IV. The Majesty of the King\n\nIn the Tube Philip read the proclamation of the High Executive over again, and, to the best of his ability, considered it. He was uneasily conscious that Rosamond would have disapproved of this, and he couldn't help feeling that it was only by an oversight that she hadn't asked him to please her by leaving it alone. However, she hadn't, so he was morally free. There stirred vaguely in his mind the subtler question of whether he were free by a strict or by an easy interpretation of morals: did exact justice, did a proper honour, demand that he should follow her choice or insist on his own? But the question never got as far as definition; he was aware of a difficulty turning over in its sleep,--slouching towards Bethlehem but not reaching it--and almost deliberately refrained from realizing it. Because he did want to know, more accurately, what this alleged declaration had said about love. Unlike Roger and, fortunately for him, like Rosamond, he had no particular use for the masters of verse. He was therefore ignorant of the cloud of testimony that had been borne to the importance and significance of the passion that was growing in him. He had certainly heard of Dante and Beatrice, of Tristram and Iseult, of Lancelot and Guinevere, but there he stopped. He had hardly heard, he had certainly never brooded over, that strange identification of Beatrice with Theology and of Theology with Beatrice by which one great poet has justified centuries of else doubtful minds. But by that secular dispensation of mercy which has moved in the blood of myriads of lovers, he had felt what he did not know and experienced what he could not formularize. And the words which he now read did not so much startle his innocent devotion by their eccentricity as dimly disturb him with a sense of their justice. He had had no use at all for the African peoples except in so far as they gave him an opportunity to follow his European habits in providing Rosamond with a home and a car and anything else she wanted. The prospect of the great age of intellect being done, also left him unmoved; he hadn't realized that any special great age of intellect had existed--except for a vague idea that a period of past history known as the Middle Ages was considerably less intelligent than the present, and that there had been a brief time when Athens, and a rather longer time when Rome, was very intellectual. But when all that seemed to him meaningless had been removed, there still remained the fact that never before, never anywhere, had any words, printed or spoken, come nearer to telling him what he really felt about Rosamond than this paragraph which purported to come from the centre of Africa, and from dark-skinned chiefs pouring up against the guns and rifles of England. He knew it was silly, but he knew it said 'adoration,' 'vision,' 'apprehension of victory,' 'conquest of death.' He knew it was silly, but he knew also that he had felt through Rosamond, brief and little understood, something which was indeed apprehension of victory and conquest of death.\n\nWhen he got home he found his godfather alone, and, rather against his own intention, found himself approaching the subject. Caithness had seen the proclamation and was inclined to be a little scornful of it: which may partly have been due to the unrecognized fact that, while Roger and Philip had both found their interior passions divined and applauded, Caithness had had his referred to merely as 'a misguided principle.' He doubted the authenticity, and went on to add: 'Rather bombastic, don't you think? I don't pretend to know what it means.'\n\nPhilip said, 'Roger seemed quite impressed by it.'\n\n'O Roger!' the priest said good-humouredly. 'I called it bombast but I expect he'd call it poetry. I don't mean that it hasn't a kind of thrill in it, but thrills aren't the only thing--certainly they're not safe things to live by.'\n\nPhilip thought this over, and decided that he agreed with it. Only his sensations about Rosamond were not--no, they were not thrills: and he wasn't at all clear that they weren't things to live by. He said, shamelessly involving Roger: 'He made fun of me about it--he seemed to think that part of it was meant for me. The paragraph about--O well, some paragraph or other.'\n\nCaithness looked down at the paper. 'This about the exaltation of love, I expect,' he said, with a rather charming smile. 'Roger would be all in favour of that; the poets are. But perhaps they're more used to living on the hilltops than the rest of us.'\n\n'You don't think it's true then?' Philip asked, with a slight and irrational feeling of disappointment. Irrational, because he hadn't actually expected Caithness to agree with a gospel, if it was a gospel, out of Africa. Sir Bernard had once remarked that Caithness limited himself to the Near East in the matter of gospels, 'the near East modified by the much nearer West.'\n\nBut over the direct question Caithness hesitated. 'I wouldn't care to say it wasn't true,' he said, 'but all truth is not expedient. It's no use making people expect too much.'\n\n'No,' Philip said, 'suppose it isn't.' Was he expecting too much? was he, in fact, expecting anything at all? Or could whatever he expected or whatever happened alter the terribly important fact of the shape of Rosamond's ear? He also looked again at the paper, and words leapt to his eyes. 'Believe, imagine, live. Know exaltation and feed on it----'\n\n'You don't then', he said, unwontedly stirred, 'really think one ought to believe in it too much?'\n\n'Why yes, my dear boy,' the priest answered. 'Only these things are so often deceptive; they change or they become familiar. One can't trust one's own vision too far; that's where religion comes in.'\n\nSir Bernard would no doubt have pointed out, what did not occur to either of the others, that this merely meant that Caithness was substituting his own hobby for Philip's. But he wasn't there, and so, vaguely depressed, especially as he couldn't feel that Rosamond's ear would ever change, the young man turned the conversation, and shut away the appeal of the High Executive for the time being in whatever corresponded in his mind to Roger Ingram's bookshelves.\n\nThe African trouble, however, displayed, during the next few days, no possibility of being shut away. The steps which the Powers, on the unanimous testimony of their spokesmen, were harmoniously taking produced no effect against the rebels (as the enemy was habitually called). It became clear that the 'hordes' consisted, in fact, of highly disciplined and well-supplied armies. In the north of Africa the territory held by the European forces grew daily smaller; all Egypt, except Cairo, was lost; the French were pressed back to the coast of Tangier; the Spaniards were hustled out of Morocco. The Dominion of South Africa was sending out expeditions, of which no news returned--certainly there had not been much time, but there was no news at all, or none that was published. In England an official censorship was attempted, but failed owing to the speedy growth of a party which demanded 'Africa for the Africans.' Normally the massacre of the Christian missionaries would have been fatal to such a demand, but the recalcitrant attitude of the Archbishop hampered the more violent patriots. Rumours got about of the appearance of hostile aeroplanes over the Mediterranean and the coastline of Southern Europe. Negroes in London and other large towns were mobbed in the streets. Roger reported to Isabel that not only negroes but comparatively harmless Indians had disappeared from his classes. It was evident that the Government would be driven to some measure of internment.\n\nIt was so driven, more quickly than had been expected, when the news came of the sinking of a transport crowded with Indian troops which were being rushed to South Africa. That the African armies should be able to operate destructively by sea as well as by land was a shock even to instructed opinion, and, among the uninstructed, crowds began to parade the streets, booing and cheering and chasing any dark-skinned stranger who showed himself. Even one or two Southern Italians had, for a few minutes, an uneasy time. The crowds were of course dissolved by the police, but they came together again like drops of water till the evening's amusement was done and they reluctantly went home.\n\nThe reaction of all these events on the money market was considerable, and it was not eased by the uncertainty which still existed on the situation of the late Mr. Rosenberg's affairs. Nothing definite was known, since the Chief Rabbi and Mr. Considine persisted in their silence, as did the two legatees. But an uneasy feeling manifested itself, both in the streets around the brothers' house and in the wider circles of finance. It could not be said that anything unusual was going on, for nothing at all seemed to be going on. But the stillness was alarming. No-one could believe that the two aged and devoted students of Kabbalistic doctrine were fit persons to control the vast interests of the Rosenberg estate. But no-one could prevent their doing whatever they liked with it. Nehemiah and Ezekiel came out to the synagogue and went home again, and went nowhere else, though well-dressed strangers in cars descended on Houndsditch, and were engaged with them over long periods. In Houndsditch itself strange tales of the jewels began to spread, following vivid accounts of them in the papers. The thrill of the jewels and the thrill of the Africans contended; hungry eyes followed the Jews as hostile eyes followed such rare negroes as could still be seen in the East End. A sullen excitement began to work around them, a breathless and vulgar imitation of the exalted imagination which the High Executive had declared to be the true path to desirable knowledge.\n\nA more natural excitement, though perhaps equally crude from the point of view of the High Executive and that other High Executive represented among others by the Archbishops, affected innumerable suburban homes when the selling began. Gradually but steadily the prices of shares in the Rosenberg concerns began to fall. It was said that someone knew something and was standing from under. A shiver of panic touched finance, allied to that other panic which had already touched the extreme villages of Southern Europe. Nervous voices made inquiries over telephones in England as nervous eyes watched aeroplanes over the Mediterranean. From each background of silence a thin mist of fear crept out and was blown over many minds. Something shook civilization, as it had been shaken a hundred times before, but that something loomed now in half-fancied forms of alien powers, of negroes flying through the air and Jews withdrawing their gold. Day by day the tremors quickened. Neglected expositors of the Apocalypse in Tonbridge or Cheltenham, old ladies, retired military men, and an eccentric clergyman or two, began to say boldly that it was the end of the world. At Birmingham a man ran naked through the streets crying that he saw fire from heaven, and leaping on to the railway lines was killed by an express train before the police could catch him. 'Second Adventist goes mad at Birmingham,' said the evening papers. The Churches found that growing crowds attended them. The Government unofficially suggested to the Archbishops that they should discourage people coming to church. The Archbishops issued a Pastoral Letter from which they naturally could not exclude some of their irritation with the Government; and of which therefore the first part, which was addressed to the new converts, tended towards a scornful and minatory tone. This, if anything, made matters worse, the converts naturally arguing that if the Church could afford to use that voice the Church must feel itself very safe indeed; and this feeling was strengthened by the second part which was addressed to the faithful in language that in normal times would have been ordinary enough. 'And you, little children, love one another,' it began and continued on the same theme, ending with another quotation, 'My peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth give I unto you.' The idea that these incantations contained a magical safety found more and more believers; and Sir Bernard congratulated Caithness on a greater spread of the Faith in ten days than in ten years previously. On a world already thus agitated fell the second communication of the High Executive. This, after the earlier formal invocation of' things willed and fated,' 'gods many and one,' went on in something of a high style of distress to lament that the Powers of Europe had not thought well even to answer the earlier message, much less apparently to prepare themselves for any negotiations. They had instead, by all means at their command, increased their armies and strengthened the war. 'Some check', the message went on, 'the African armies have administered to this gathering defiance, but the High Executive has felt compelled to advise its august Sovereigns that mere measures of defence will no longer be sufficient. If the Powers of Europe are determined to force war upon Africa, then Africa will be compelled to open war upon Europe. The gospel which is the birthright of the African peoples and which they offer as a message of hope even to the degraded and outworn nations of the white race carries no maxim which they are unwilling to practise. With a profound but unrecognised truth the Christians of Europe have declared that the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church. This maxim Africa knows, understands, obeys. In the high mysteries of birth and death, not only physical generation or physical destruction, but those spiritual experiences of which these are but types, Africa has learnt the secret duties of man. Her peoples offer themselves in exaltation to the bed of death as to the bed of love. With an ecstasy born of their ecstasy, with a communication to its children of that which they first communicated to it, the High Executive summons them to what is at present the final devotion of conscious being. They and it are alike indifferent to the result; if the armies of Europe destroy them they will but find in death a greater thing than their conquerors know. But the armies of Europe will not destroy them, for the Second Evolution of man has begun. Their leaders and prophets, and the High Executive which is their voice and act, address themselves no longer to the children of intellect and science and learning. They turn to their own peoples. Daughters and Sons of Africa, you are called to the everlasting sacrifice. Victim or priest at that altar, it matters not whether you inflict or endure the pang. Come, for the cycles are accomplished and the knowledge that was of old returns. Come, for this is the hour of death that alternates for ever with the hour of love. Come, for without the knowledge of both the knowledge of one shall fail. Come, ye blessed, inherit the things laid up for you from the foundations of the world.'\n\nOn the evening of the day when this invocation appeared, the crowds in the streets were thicker than ever. The first death was reported in a special edition of the papers; a negro had been literally hunted over Hampstead Heath and afterwards (not quite intentionally, it was thought), killed. Sir Bernard rang up Isabel.\n\n'Nothing,' he said, when she answered, 'except that you once said that Hampstead was the negro quarter of London, and I thought I'd like to know whether there was any trouble up there.'\n\n'Not to say trouble,' Isabel said. 'There was a little friction at the gate, and we've got a coloured gentleman in the house at present.'\n\n'Have you indeed?' Sir Bernard exclaimed. 'Was it you or Roger who brought him in?'\n\n'Both of us,' Isabel explained. 'We heard a noise in the street and we looked out, and there was a negro--at least, he was a black man; a negro's something technical, isn't it?--against our gate, and the most unpleasant lot of whites you ever saw all round him, cursing. Roger went out and talked to them, but that was no good. He said something about behaving like Englishmen, and I suppose they did; at least they began to throw stones and hit out with their sticks. So Roger got him through the gate, and I got them through the front door, and here he is.'\n\n'You're not hurt, Isabel?' Sir Bernard said sharply. 'What about the crowd?'\n\n'O they threw things at the house and smashed a window, and presently the police came and they went away,' Isabel answered. 'No, thank you, I'm perfectly all right. I'm just going to make coffee. Come and have some.'\n\n'Where's your visitor?' Sir Bernard asked.\n\n'Talking African love songs and tribal poetry with Roger in his room,' Isabel said. 'They agree wonderfully on everything but the effect of the adverb. Roger's evolving a theory that adverbs have no place in great poetry--I don't understand why.'\n\n'I should like to hear him,' Sir Bernard said. 'Thanks, Isabel; I'll come up if I may.'\n\n'Do,' said Isabel, 'and I'll postpone the coffee for half-an-hour. Till then.'\n\nFor once Sir Bernard took a taxi; as a general rule he avoided them, preferring the more actively contemplative life of buses and tubes, and preferring also never to be in anything like a hurry. When he arrived he found Philip and Rosamond, who had been dining out, sitting side by side on the kitchen table, watching Isabel make the coffee.\n\n'Come in here, Sir Bernard, won't you?' she said when she had let him in, 'and you shall see the refugee soon. He's in the only room with a fire, and as Rosamond is terrified to death of him we have to linger in the kitchen to keep comfortably warm. \"October nights are chill,\" as someone said. No, don't tell me.'\n\n'Isabel,' her sister protested, 'I'm not terrified of him, but I don't think it's quite nice of him to stop here. Why doesn't he go home?'\n\n'With mobs prowling round the garden gate?' Isabel asked. 'And Roger still making noises to show the union of accent and quantity? My dear Rosamond, when you're married you won't want Philip's friends to go home until he's thoroughly tired out. Otherwise he'll barge into your room at midnight and go on with the conversation with you. And as you're asleep to begin with, and as you don't know what the conversation was about, and as you don't know whether he wants you to agree or disagree though you'd do either for peace, you'll find it very difficult to be nice to him. I have never', Isabel went on, pouring milk into a saucepan, 'really quarrelled with Roger....'\n\n'Isabel!' Sir Bernard murmured.\n\n'Not really,' Isabel persisted, 'except once, and that was when he woke me up by calling out to me very late one night, \"Isabel, what is there in verse which is the equivalent of the principle of the arch?\" I really was angry then, but he only kept murmuring lines of poetry and trying to see if they were like an arch. All that because a friend of his who had been to dinner had gone away at half-past eleven instead of half-past one. Always remember, Rosamond my child, that a man needs you to get away from.'\n\n'You mean needs to get away from me, don't you?' Rosamond asked, looking possessively at Philip.\n\n'No,' Isabel said, 'Sir Bernard, the milk's boiling... thank you so much. No, Rosamond, I don't. I mean exactly what I said. A man must have you----'\n\n'I wish you wouldn't keep saying \"a man,\" Isabel,' Philip remonstrated.\n\n'Very well--give me a spoon, Philip--Philip then must have you there in order to be able to get away. If you weren't there he wouldn't be able to get away.'\n\nRosamond looked uninterested. Philip reflected what a curious thing it was that so many people he knew should want to chatter like this. His father did it, Ingram did it, Isabel did it. Sometimes he understood it, sometimes he didn't. But he never understood it as now, suddenly, he understood Rosamond's arm when she leant forward to pass a plate to her sister: somehow that arm always made him think of the Downs against the sky. There was a line, a curved beauty, a thing that spoke to both mind and heart; a thing that was there for ever. And Rosamond? Rosamond was like them, she was there for ever. It occurred to him that, if she was, then her occasional slowness when he was trying to explain something was there for ever. Well, after all, Rosamond was only human; she couldn't be absolutely perfect. And then as she stretched out her arm again he cried out that she was perfect, she was more than perfect; the movement of her arm was something frightfully important, and now it was gone. He had seen the verge of a great conclusion of mortal things and then it had vanished. Over that white curve he had looked into incredible space; abysses of intelligence lay beyond it. And in a moment all that lay beyond it was the bright kitchen, and Sir Bernard standing up to go into the other room. He jumped to his feet and with a movement almost of terror took the loaded coffee tray from Isabel.\n\n'Quietly,' Isabel said as they came to the door of the nondescript room where the Ingrams habitually, alone or with their intimates, passed their time. 'Quietly; let's hear what the rescued captive and his saviour are talking about.'\n\nShe opened the door gently, and Ingram's voice came out to them. 'O rhythm!' he was saying, 'rhythm is the cheap pseudo-metaphysical slang of our day. At least it was; it's dying now. Everyone explained everything by talking about rhythm. It's a curious thing that people who will sneer at a man for doing nothing all his life but making words sound lovely and full of meaning will be quite happy over life so long as they can explain it in words that are almost meaningless. I sometimes think the nearest we can get to meaning is to feel as if there was meaning.'\n\n'Yet at least rhythm's distinctly felt,' said another voice, a rich strange voice; 'so far they attempt to discover a knowledge of the whole.'\n\n'O so far!' Ingram said, and jumped off the table on which he was sitting as Isabel pushed the door right open and came into the room. After a table had been found for the tray, introductions took place; at least Ingram began to say, 'O Rosamond'--he stopped suddenly; 'By God,' he said, 'I don't know your name.'\n\nThe stranger, a tall magnificent young creature, darkly bronze, bowed to Rosamond: 'My name is Inkamasi,' he said. 'At least,' he added, a trifle scornfully, Sir Bernard thought, 'that is the simplest form of it.'\n\n'Quite,' Roger said brightly. 'Miss Murchison, Mr. Travers--hallo, Sir Bernard, I didn't know you were here--Sir Bernard Travers, the Belly-King.'\n\nIt was a name with which his intimates had teased Sir Bernard in the days of his practice. Philip frowned, forgetting that though the black--if you could strictly call him black--was to him an entirely new and not very desirable acquaintance, the occurrences of the last two hours had put him on terms of intimacy with the Ingrams. Rosamond, rather nervously, kept close to his side. Roger sat down again on top of his large knee-hole writing-table, and took the coffee Philip handed him.\n\n'We were talking----' he began.\n\n'Yes, darling, we heard you,' Isabel said. 'Don't trouble to repeat it just at once. And I hope that doesn't sound too rude,' she added to the stranger, 'only when Roger's got more than two people to listen to him he always begins to lecture.'\n\n'I ought to have gone long ago,' the other said. 'But your husband kept me, talking of poetry and song and the principles of being.'\n\n'But', Isabel said, 'must you go yet? I mean, will it be wise?' She looked at Roger.\n\n'O quite,' the African said. 'The police will have cleared the streets, and I don't live far away.'\n\nRoger looked at the clock. 'Twenty to ten,' he said, 'better wait a little. I didn't quite get the hang of what you were saying about Homer. I'll walk round with you presently. Sir Bernard'll be interested in Homer; he had a line from him on the title-page of his book, opposite the peculiarly loathsome diagram that formed the frontispiece.'\n\n'I didn't even know you'd looked so far into it,' Sir Bernard said.\n\n'I generally give the title-page a fair chance,' Roger said. 'One can't always judge books merely by the cover. It's a book on the stomach,' he explained to Inkamasi, 'with nine full-page photographs and about fifty more illustrations, each more abominable than the others. When it was published Sir Bernard gave copies to all his friends, because he knew they wouldn't read it and wanted to hear them explaining why. Brave men cut him afterwards.'\n\n'I should like to see it,' the African voice said. 'I did a little medical work before I took up law.'\n\n'Well, it's buried under Rabelais, Swift, and Ulysses at the moment,' Ingram grinned at Sir Bernard, 'but I'll get it out for you before you come again. \"Lend it you I will for half a hundred years.\" But not give it. I retain it to keep me humble.'\n\n'I think I'll go now,' Inkamasi said, putting down his cup. 'Thank you, Mrs. Ingram, for being so kind.'\n\n'O well, if you will,' said Roger. 'Coming, Philip?'\n\n'Yes, rather,' Philip answered, with a momentary private hope that he wouldn't have to help defend this black man against even an unpleasant white.\n\n'Philip,' Rosamond whispered to him, with a soft pounce, 'don't go. I don't like him.'\n\n'Must,' he whispered back. 'Shan't be long, dearest.'\n\n'We'll all go,' Sir Bernard said. 'The streets aren't too quiet. I'm not at all sure, Mr. Inkamasi, that you wouldn't be wise to take advantage of the Government's offer to remove friendly aliens. If you're living alone----'\n\nThe African dilated where he stood. 'I will go alone,' he said. 'They will not attack me twice.'\n\n'No, of course not,' Roger said. 'Never attack the same man twice is a well-known rule of mobs. Nonsense, man, no one knows who's about. I think you ought to stop here; you can, you know. We told you that before.'\n\n'Do,' Isabel put in.\n\nInkamasi seemed to hesitate, then he said rather vaguely, 'No, I'm sorry, I must go. There are reasons....'\n\n'Are they really vicious, Roger?' Sir Bernard asked.\n\n'Nasty little things,' Roger answered. 'The usual kind. I believe they'd have bolted before if Inkamasi and I had rushed them. He nearly scattered them by himself but there were just enough to feel safe.'\n\n'I know them,' the African said disdainfully. 'There are others like them in my country--they would run from a lion.'\n\n'As bad as that, are they?' Roger asked gravely. 'Good heavens, many's the time I've chased a lion or two down Haverstock Hill by just shouting at them. Like you were doing when we came out. By the way, what were you shouting?'\n\nThe African drew himself up and his magnificent form seemed to expand before the young man's eyes. H"
