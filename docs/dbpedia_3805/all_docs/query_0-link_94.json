        "text": "Prince William of Wales\n\nWilliam Arthur Philip Louis Windsor was born on June 21, 1982, in Paddington, London, the elder son of Charles, prince of Wales, and Diana, princess of Wales, and second in line (after Charles) to the British throne. William received his early education at Wetherby School in London and later attended Ludgrove School in Berkshire (1990–95) and Eton College in Windsor (1995–2000). The following year he spent traveling before enrolling at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, where he would study art history, social anthropology, and geography. Having been exposed to charitable activities early in his life, he devoted the year to volunteering in Chile, working at a British dairy farm, and visiting Belize and various African countries. In 2005 William graduated from St. Andrews with a degree in geography, and the following year he entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst; he received his commission in the Household Cavalry in 2006.\n\nDespite his willingness to join British forces in Iraq, military officials suggested that neither William nor his younger brother, Harry, should serve, because they could become specific targets of attack, thereby putting their fellow soldiers at risk. (Harry briefly served in Afghanistan, however). In 2008 William went on attachment to the Royal Air Force and then to the Royal Navy, so that he could gain experience in all three major branches of the armed services. In 2010 he completed his training as a helicopter pilot in the RAF Search and Rescue Force and began a tour of duty in Wales.\n\nWilliam ranks among the most popular figures of the royal family. Much like his father, William is an avid sportsman. He was admired for his public poise and grace following his mother’s death in a car crash in Paris in 1997, and 10 years later William and Harry organized a London memorial service to mark the anniversary of her death.\n\nCatherine Elizabeth Middleton\n\nCatherine Elizabeth Middleton was born on January 9, 1982, in Reading, Berkshire, England, the eldest of three children of Michael and Carole Middleton. Her siblings include a sister, Philippa (Pippa), and a brother, James. Her parents met while working as flight attendants at British Airways, and in 1987 they founded a mail-order business selling supplies for children’s parties. The success of that venture, along with a family inheritance, allowed them to send Catherine to a prep school and then to the prestigious Marlborough College in Wiltshire, England. At Marlborough, Catherine (by then called Kate) was known as a serious, levelheaded student, excelling in both athletics—she captained the school’s field hockey team—and academics. In 2001 Kate went on to the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, where she studied art history. After graduating from St. Andrews in 2005, she briefly worked as an accessories buyer for a clothing retailer, and she later assumed various roles at her parents’ company while also performing a host of charity work."
