Pic doesn’t unravel until its poorly executed climax and the hammy extended death scene of the villain. It’s based on the play by Geoffrey Kerr and is written by J.O.C. Orton and Anatole de Grunwald.\n\nA Glasgow-based spy ring infiltrates the rural western Scottish estate of John Barrington (Leslie Banks), the eccentric genius inventor of a bombsight for the military, who refuses to work in a secure military lab. The ring, when unable to steal the revolutionary bombsight blueprint even though they are able to steal some other inventions, in desperation send in wounded Brit Spitfire pilot Flt-Lieut. George Perry (John Mills). He parachuted out of his malfunctioning plane to land in a ditch and broke an arm, in order to stay Barrington’s village and scheme to kidnap the inventor and take him to Berlin.\n\nThe Barrington household includes John’s daffy wife (Jeanne De Casalis), his klutzy nerdy but brilliant assistant Alan Trently (Michael Wilding), and his lovely daughter (Carla Lehmann)–the love interest of both Perry and Trently. Residing in the cottage to let, of the title, are the scene stealing cockney youth evacuee and Sherlock Holmes buff Ronnie (George Cole), the nosy undercover Scotland Yard detective Charles Dimble (Alastair Sim) posing as a guest and the copper bodyguard posing as a butler (Wally Patch). The cottage is also turned into a military hospital, and is where Perry recuperates.\n\nSlight but enjoyable spy spoof, that makes good use of its brilliant cast and gets over in an appealing way despite being stagy.\n\nREVIEWED ON 4/3/2010 GRADE: B\n\nDennis Schwartz: “Ozus’ World Movie Reviews”"
