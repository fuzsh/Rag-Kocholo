Read our privacy policy\n\nKing Charles and David Beckham bonded over the mutual love of bees as the ex-England football captain was unveiled as a King’s Foundation ambassador.\n\nBeckham met privately with the King at Highgrove, Charles’s Gloucestershire retreat to learn more about its work.\n\nBeckham said: “It was inspiring to hear from the King about the work of His Majesty’s foundation during my recent visit to Highgrove Gardens – and compare beekeeping tips!”\n\nIt came as Prince Andrew was reportedly refusing to leave the £30milion Royal Lodge and was becoming an increasingly isolated figure, who “spends his days watching television in a darkened room” in the crumbling residence.\n\nA friend of King Charles has now claimed that life at the Royal Lodge will become “increasingly cold and uncomfortable” for Andrew if he refuses to hand back the keys.\n\nThe friend told The Times: “The only question now is when he will realise that he has become a prisoner of his own pride — and that handing back the keys will afford him far greater comfort, and the continued support of his family.”\n\nHarry and Meghan appoint Meghan’s mum in important new role\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have again chosen to reject royal tradition and appoint Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland as their children’s nanny.\n\nAs reported by the Express, the decision was made after a series of unsuccessful partnerships with professional childminders.\n\nThe insider claimed that this will allow the children to grow up in a more traditional, close-knit family environment.\n\n“Harry and Meghan have used a number of nannies in the past, but now that Doria has moved in with the family, she has stepped up to help look after the children,” the source said.\n\n“There is sometimes additional help, but Doria is working closely with Meghan to ensure that the children are brought up in a close-knit and loving family environment.”\n\nEmma Guinness31 May 2024 13:38\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla visit Epsom racecourse\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla are enjoying a day at Epsom racecourse today.\n\nThe Ladies Day event is of special significance for the Monarch, 75, as it features a horse bred by his late mother, Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThe horse in question is called Treasure and it will compete for a prize fund of £541,035 in the Betfred Oaks race.\n\nTrainer Ralph Beckett said the King and Queen “decided to have a go at the Oaks as the ground should be in her favour” revealing that the King has been “very pleased with her progress.”\n\nEmma Guinness31 May 2024 16:19\n\nKing and Queen praised as horse owners\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla have been praised for their enthusiasm as horse owners.\n\nThe couple are visiting Epsom racecourse today to see the late Queen Elizabeth’s horse Treasure compete in the Betfred Oaks race.\n\nThe odds on the horse, which the Queen bred before her death in 2022, are 18/1.\n\nThe King could add to his vast personal fortune if the animal emerges victorious, with a prize fund of over £500,000.\n\nTrainer Ralph Beckett said the couple were “such enthusiastic owners and it is great to be training such a nice filly for them who is running in a Classic.”\n\nEmma Guinness31 May 2024 17:00\n\nNetflix ‘losing interest’ in Harry and Meghan\n\nStreaming giant Netflix is reportedly losing interest in Prince Harry and Meghan Markle after the couple signed a $100 million deal.\n\nThe five-year partnership with Archewell production company, signed in 2020, is set to end next year, and one insider has claimed it’s unlikely to be renewed.\n\n“[The Sussex deal] runs out next year and Netflix are no longer producing the series of The Crown, as they previously were. They might therefore have less interest in the Sussexes,” Richard Fitzwilliams told the Daily Mail.\n\nThe couple are currently producing two new programmes but Fitzwilliams does not believe this will be enough for Netflix.\n\n“Meghan’s programme for Netflix on cookery and entertaining and her lifestyle brand American Riviera Orchard and Harry’s series for Netflix on polo, show some much-needed activity [but] they clearly need more A-list endorsements,” he added.\n\nEmma Guinness31 May 2024 20:00\n\nPrince William upset by ‘tasteless and offensive’ comparisons of Meghan to Diana\n\nPrince William is upset by comparisons made between Meghan Markle and Princess Diana in the wake of the Sussex’s unofficial Nigeria tour, it has been claimed.\n\nA royal insider has said he finds the comparisons “beyond tasteless and offensive” to both himself and Kate Middleton.\n\nThe insider told Closer magazine: “William doesn’t want to deprive Harry of the right to celebrate their mother’s legacy. What bothers him is how Meghan’s paraded around as the modern-day version of Diana, he finds that beyond tasteless and offensive, not only to him but also to Kate.”\n\nEmma Guinness31 May 2024 22:00\n\nCharles and Camilla’s horse well beaten in racing classic at Epsom\n\nThe King and Queen’s sporting hopes were dashed when their thoroughbred was well beaten in one of racing’s most prestigious events.\n\nCharles and Camilla spent the day at Epsom race course where, despite the blustery and cold conditions, thousands of racegoers turned out for Ladies’ Day.\n\nAll eyes were on the runners in the Oaks - a classic twice won by Queen Elizabeth II - with the monarch and his wife’s horse Treasure a longshot with odds of 16-1.\n\nJockey Chris Hayes rode the Aga Khan’s horse Ezeliya to a well-judged victory, with Treasure finishing at the back of the pack.\n\nThe royal couple had walked into the parade ring in the final moments before the classic was run, to see their horse and chat to its jockey James Doyle and their racing manager John Warren.\n\nReport:\n\nCharles and Camilla’s horse well beaten in racing classic at Epsom\n\nDunfermline in 1977 was the last horse to carry the royal colours to victory in a British classic.\n\nNamita Singh1 June 2024 03:55\n\n‘He was taking notes’: Rumors of Prince Harry writing Spare sequel\n\nThe prospect of a reconciliation between Prince Harry, King Charles and Prince William is said to be only becoming more distant amid rumours that the Duke of Sussex is writing a second memoir.\n\nPrince Harry’s claims in Spare have created deep “trust” issues and fears of another book are preventing any meaningful conversation between them to move past it, revealed King Charles’s biographer Robert Hardman.\n\n“The problem that exists is, at the moment, there is still a trust issue,” he told Tatler on Thursday.\n\n“He gave away so many secrets,” Hardman explained, as he accused the Prince of taking notes when Queen Elizabeth died.\n\n“At the time of the Queen’s death … he was taking notes,” he said, raising suspicions that the prince might be preparing to write a sequel to his memoir.\n\n“As an author, that says to me one thing and one thing only: part two might be on its way,” he said.\n\nNamita Singh1 June 2024 05:00\n\nInside the Duke of Westminster and Olivia Henson’s wedding\n\nThe society wedding of the year between the Duke of Westminster and Olivia Henson is taking place at Chester Cathedral next weekend.\n\nHugh Grosvenor, 33, is one of the richest men in the UK with a net worth of £10.127bn, according to the 2024 Sunday Times Rich List and was once considered the country’s most eligible bachelor.\n\nBut he will officially be off the market on 7 June when he ties the knot with Henson, 31, in a lavish ceremony where Prince William and Prince George are set to play key roles.\n\nMy colleague Emma Guinness reports:\n\nInside the Duke of Westminster and Olivia Henson’s wedding with royals in key roles\n\nThe Duke was once considered Britain’s most eligible bachelor\n\nNamita Singh1 June 2024 06:00\n\nNigeria’s First Lady slams US celebs after Meghan Markle’s visit\n\nThe First Lady of Nigeria has seemingly taken aim at Meghan Markle’s choice of clothing following her and Prince Harry’s recent trip to the country.\n\nThe couple, who visited in their capacity as private citizens, spent three days in Nigeria celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.\n\nSenator Oluremi Tinubu, 63, made the comments during a speech celebrating her husband’s first year in office and discussed her hopes for the modesty of Nigerian women and girls.\n\nReport:\n\nNigeria’s First Lady slams US celebs after Meghan Markle visit\n\nShe urged Nigerian women and girls not to ‘emulate film stars from America’\n\nNamita Singh1 June 2024 07:00\n\nPrince Andrew ‘ain’t going anywhere’ in deepening battle with King Charles over royal residence\n\nPrince Andrew “ain’t going anywhere” in his battle with the King over his royal residence, a source has claimed, as the royal row between the siblings deepens.\n\nAmid the controversy over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the Duke of York, 64, stepped down from public duties in May 2020 and was subsequently stripped of his royal titles. However, the prince has continued to live at the royal residence Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion he has called home for two decades.\n\nCharles has been urging his younger brother to vacate the property and move into the smaller Frogmore Cottage instead – but Andrew has refused to move, much to his older brother’s frustration. The duke has the lease on Royal Lodge, whereas the King controls the purse strings – and consequently, the siblings have become embroiled in what insiders have called the “siege of Royal Lodge”, according to The Sun.\n\nMore here:\n\nNamita Singh1 June 2024 08:00"
