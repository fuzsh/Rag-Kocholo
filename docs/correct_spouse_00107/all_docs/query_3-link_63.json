Welcome to the more than 2000 new subscribers to the Data Driven HR Monthly newsletter, who joined in the last month. This edition of the Data Driven HR Monthly is sponsored by our friends at Mercer Strategic Shift: Skills-Powered Organizations in the Age of AI Forty-four percent of workers’ skills will be disrupted by technology in the next five years.* To thrive through this disruption, businesses must adapt their operating models to perpetually reinvent themselves as demand for skills ebbs and flows with greater velocity and volatility. The next-generation organization will be at the forefront of this strategic shift toward making skills the currency of work, cultivating a culture of talent sharing, automating work to take mundane tasks off employees’ hands, augmenting human creativity with AI, and reshaping the entire talent life cycle. Find out how to make the shift to a skills-powered organization The new Skills Strategy Guide from Mercer and MIT SMR Connections explores: Why skills should be a top priority in rethinking work in the age of AI The obstacles that stand in the way Practical steps to overcome challenges and reap the rewards Learnings from Standard Chartered Bank’s skills journey How to build a skills-powered approach to work Read the Strategy Guide *Source: The World Economic Forum’s 2023 Future of Jobs report To sponsor an edition of the Data Driven HR Monthly, and share your brand with close to 130,000 Data Driven HR Monthly subscribers, send an email to dgreen@zandel.org.

HYBRID, GENERATIVE AI AND THE FUTURE OF WORK MCKINSEY - The state of AI in early 2024: Gen AI adoption spikes and starts to generate value If 2023 was the year the world discovered generative AI, 2024 is the year organizations truly began using—and deriving business value from—this new technology. New research from McKinsey highlights that adoption of AI – and GenAI – has surged in the last 12 months, that organisations are reporting measurable benefits, that there is increased mitigation of the risk of inaccuracy, and that there are a small group of high-performers leading the way. From a HR perspective, the study finds: (1) 12% of respondents are regularly using GenAI in HR. (2) Organisations most often see meaningful cost reductions from GenAI use in HR (see FIG 1). (3) HR functions are most often able to put their GenAI capabilities to use within one to four months. (4) Talent is one of six areas of best practice where high-performers are leading with GenAI (see FIG 2). (Authors: Alex Singla Alexander Sukharevsky Lareina Yee and Michael Chui with Bryce Hall) FIG 1: Organizations most often see meaningful cost reductions from generative AI use in HR and revenue increases in supply chain management (Source: McKinsey) FIG 2: Organizations seeing the largest returns from generative AI are more likely than others to follow a range of best practices (Source: McKinsey) MARK MORTENSEN AND AMY EDMONDSON - Leaders Need to Reframe the Return-to-Office Conversation Framing refers to how an issue is presented; it’s the meaning layered onto an issue or situation that shapes how people think about its objective facts. More precisely, it’s about re-framing: deliberately replacing taken-for-granted cognitive frames with more helpful ones. Mark Mortensen and Amy Edmondson discuss the concept of ‘framing’ and its role for leaders in engaging in dialogue with employees about the balance between in-person and flexible working. They offer a three-step process to communicate flexible work policies: (1) Acknowledge the bind and be patient. (2) Focus on mutual value, not just organisational benefits. (3) Approach the process as data-driven, co-created, iterative learning. For more on this topic, listen to Mark in conversation with me on the Digital HR Leaders podcast: How to Foster Collaboration Within Hybrid Working Teams. RASHLEEN ARORA - Design a Return-to-Office Strategy That Balances Organizational and Employee Needs It’s becoming increasingly evident that rigid return-to-office (RTO) mandates can backfire by antagonising employees and impacting retention. Rashleen Kaur Arora presents Gartner research that outlines how HR leaders can craft a RTO strategy that balances organisational objectives with employee buy-in. The article includes a powerful case study on how Scotiabank implemented an evidence-based hybrid RTO model (see FIG 3).

June saw a plethora of insightful reads about the impact of AI on HR and people analytics, so I’ve gathered five together here along with a prescient piece from 2018 on the professions most susceptible to automation. (1) Pietro Mazzoleni examines the importance of data maturity when it comes to the successful adoption of GenAI solutions in HR. (2) Greg Newman outlines why using the language of the employee journey will help your organisation maximise the value you gain from digital workers. (3) Martijn Wiertz presents a compelling vision where GenAI helps redefine our work design, creating time we can utilise for doing the work, care and training we need as a community – from great places to work to great places to be (see FIG 4). (4) Max Blumberg (JA) ?? explores how people analytics roles may evolve in the age of AI, the skills needed to remain relevant, and the importance of transparency in these issues within the people analytics community. (5) Finally, and thanks to Hung Lee for featuring it in a recent edition of Recruiting Brainfood, let’s revisit an article by Scott Latham and Beth Humberd that outlines four ways in which jobs will respond to automation based on two factors: the type of value provided and how it’s delivered (see FIG 5).

In recent editions of the Data Driven HR Monthly, I’ve featured a collection of articles by people analytics leaders. These act as a spur and inspiration to the field. Seven are highlighted here. (1) David Hodges takes inspiration from Rob Briner’s research to make the case for evidence-based HR. As Dave asks: “If you’re not practising evidence-based HR, what type of HR are you practising?” (see FIG 7). (2) Henrik Håkansson applies the popular concept of “fear of missing out” to people analytics in his astute article. (3) Amit Mohindra provides a handy explanation of the ‘Rule of 72”, which can be used to extract a key parameter from a growth rate. (4) Louise Baird breaks down the two different types of machine learning – supervised and unsupervised – and how it can be applied to people analytics. (5) Martha Curioni provides examples of building explainable AI into a range of HR processes including: hiring, predicting attrition, and assessing promotion readiness. (6) Based on their survey of people analytics practitioners, Nick Jesteadt and Erin Fleming highlight three common yet seemingly elusive themes in the field: productivity, skills and productisation. (7) Christopher Rosett breaks down the People Analytics Cube (see FIG 8) in his LinkedIn post with a nod to Alexis Fink. FIG 7: What is being used in HR instead of evidence? (Source: Evidence Based HR: A New Paradigm by Rob Briner, Corporate Research Forum) FIG 8: People Analytics Cube (Source: Christopher Rosett) WILLIS JENSEN - Finding a People Analytics Job One of the features of the people analytics field is that it is pretty fluid with many that work within it moving roles in the last 12-18 months – as evidenced by the invaluable People Analytics Job Board that Richard Rosenow oversees. In his article, Willis Jensen shares insights from his recent transition to a new role including: (1) Being very clear about what you want in your next job. (2) Don’t write an AI-generated cover letter. (3) Use a resume tool to help you tailor your resume for each job. (4) Do not use a shotgun approach of applying for hundreds of jobs. (5) Use LinkedIn as a job-hunting tool. For more on people analytics careers, listen to Serena H. Huang, Ph.D. in discussion with me on the Digital HR Leaders podcast: How to Enhance Your Career in People Analytics.

Josh Bersin lays out a compelling case for the CHRO being the most important role of all in the c-suite now. He highlights factors such as the abundance of people challenges, labour shortages, organisation redesign, and globalisation. Josh also introduces his initial findings from a study of 47,000 CHROs: (1) There is a major increase in the C-level importance of the CHRO. (2) The CHRO job is multi-disciplinary, and more difficult than it looks. (3) The CHRO role is expanding. (4) Strong CHROs are now transforming the HR function. (5) The HR function is not developing itself - 80% of high-performing CHROs are external hires. FIG 12: The two roles of the CHRO (Source: Josh Bersin) JEANNE MEISTER – 13 HR jobs of the future In HR, this is our Promethean moment as we navigate a complex future, one with limitless possibilities in how we work, where we work, who we work with and what we expect in our workplace. Based on her conversations with HR leaders, Jeanne C M. presents 13 HR jobs of the future, which will emerge between now and 2030 (see FIG 13). Jeanne then explains how each of these roles “embody five core workplace themes enabling leaders to embrace reinvention as a strategy where humans and machines collaborate to deliver in which to the organization.” The five themes are: (1) Building GenAI literacy, (2) Working from anywhere, (3) Building human-machine partnerships, (4) Driving innovation and wellbeing in the workplace, (5) Creating a personalised employee experience. FIG 13: 13 HR Jobs of the Future (Source: Jeanne Meister) NAOMI VERGHESE - Investing in the Right Approach to Upskilling HR When the CHRO and HRLT role-model the use of people data and analytics in their day-to-day job, then other HR professionals also use people data and analytics in their work. Naomi Verghese shares the key findings from research she led at Insight222 to identify the key skills HR professionals need to consult and communicate effectively with data. The study, Upskilling the HR Profession: Building Data Literacy at Scale, identified five essential skills for HR professionals: (1) Consulting, (2) Influencing Stakeholders, (3) Data Interpretation, (4) Building Recommendations from Insights, (5) Storytelling. The study also identified the importance of role-modelling by the CHRO and HR leadership team with regards to data literacy (see FIG 14, and above quote).

BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE - Skills-Based Internal Mobility Playbook Summary | White Paper Skills are five times more predictive of a person’s future performance than their education An excellent playbook compiled by the Business Roundtable on skills-based internal mobility, which is organised into five chapters covering critical areas such as stakeholder engagement, skills assessment and validation (see FIG 16), how to connect people with opportunities, how to measure success, and enabling technologies. Features examples from a myriad of companies including: Walmart, Chevron, Workday and Vistra. Thanks to Brian Heger for highlighting this resource in his excellent weekly Talent Edge newsletter. FIG 16: Skill validation characteristics (Source: Business Roundtable) EMPLOYEE LISTENING, EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE, AND EMPLOYEE WELLBEING DAWN KLINGHOFFER, KAREN KOCHER, AND NATALIE LUNA - Onboarding New Employees in a Hybrid Workplace New hires who are provided with clarity about their role responsibilities, feedback on how they are doing, and resources to help them answer questions are three to four times more likely to contribute to their team’s success during the first 90 days. Now we are in the era of hybrid work, what’s the ideal way to onboard new employees today? That was one question that the people analytics team at Microsoft sought to answer in a recent study, along with: How can we ensure that new hires thrive while also supporting flexibility? The findings confirmed that onboarding to a new role, team, or company is a key moment for building connections with the new manager and team and doing so a few days in person provides unique benefits. But just requiring newcomers to be onsite full time doesn’t guarantee success. In their article, Dawn Klinghoffer Karen Kocher and Natalie Luna explain and provide examples of how onboarding that truly helps new employees thrive in the modern workplace is less about face time and more about intention, structure, and resources. For example, the study found that the top factors that make the most difference in onboarding new employees are clarity about role responsibilities, feedback on how they are doing, and resources to help them answer questions. New hires who are successfully set up with these three elements are three to four times more likely to contribute to their team’s success during the first 90 days. For more on Microsoft’s approach to employee thriving, which they define as: being energized and empowered to do meaningful work, listen to Dawn in conversation with me on the Digital HR Leaders podcast: How Microsoft Created A Thriving Workforce By Going Beyond Employee Engagement. LEADERSHIP, CULTURE, AND LEARNING DAVE ULRICH - Reflections on Performance Management: How to Make Meaningful Progress In May’s Data Driven HR Monthly, I featured a McKinsey article on a performance management system that puts people first. In his recent article, Dave Ulrich cites a number of sources highlighting that pretty much all stakeholders (including employees, executives and HR leaders) are unhappy with their performance management systems. Ulrich lays out a four-step process for performance management (see FIG 17) comprising: (1) Clarifying expectations with meaningful goals. (2) Measuring and tracking performance. (3) Allocating financial and non-financial rewards. (4) Having positive coaching conversations. Dave then highlights the recently launched Manifesto for Flourishing at Work, a collaboration of practitioners, consultants, and academics to reinvent performance management. He highlights three critical topics from the manifesto: First, align performance and purpose by making sure that performance encourages progress towards a company’s purpose that includes all stakeholders. Second, manage the complex system of performance by focusing both on individuals within the system and also the system itself. Third, ensure that leaders are secure enough in themselves to use their power to empower others and to allow employees to contribute to their own improvement. FIG 17: Performance management process – four steps (Source: Dave Ulrich) ERIN MEYER - Build a Corporate Culture That Works If you hire people whose personalities don’t align with your culture, no matter what else you get right, you are unlikely to get the desired behaviors. Ever since Peter Drucker’s infamous assertion that “culture eats strategy for breakfast,” it has been widely acknowledged that managing corporate culture is the key to business success. Yet the link between ‘values’ and ‘behaviours’ is often stark. As INSEAD professor Erin Meyer asks in her latest Harvard Business Review article: “If culture eats strategy for breakfast, how should you be cooking it?” Erin blends in examples from the likes of Amazon, Netflix, Airbnb, Pixar and others and presents six guidelines to help managers who are confronting the challenges of culture building: (1) Build Your Culture Based on Real-World Dilemmas. (2) Move Your Culture from Abstraction to Action. (3) Paint Your Culture in Full Colour. (4) Hire the Right People, and They Will Build the Right Culture. (5) Make Sure that Culture Drives Strategy. (6) Don’t Be a Purist. An absolute must-read. At Insight222, we’re delighted that Erin Meyer will be speaking at our Global Executive Retreat in Amsterdam in September.

ROB CROSS AND KATHERYN BREKKEN | I4CP - The Team Network Effect™: How Precision Collaboration Unleashes Productivity A new study of 1,400 organisations on team effectiveness, led by Rob Cross and Katheryn Brekken, Ph.D. for The Institute for Corporate Productivity (i4cp), finds that 80% of teams fall short of reaching their full productivity potential due to corporate dysfunction. The study identifies six snares that stifle team performance (see FIG 18), and provides powerful examples including from Roche, which found that efforts to increase geographic and cross-functional collaboration across teams in 89 countries reaped a direct revenue impact of $500 million in less than two years. FIG 18: How companies rank against the six dysfunctions that stifle team performance (Source: i4CP) DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION, AND BELONGING SHUJAAT AHMAD - From Productivity to Prosperity: The AI Shift Leaders Must Embrace The jobs most at risk from AI automation are jobs occupied by women and minority racial groups. In his compelling essay, Shujaat Ahmad argues that this calls for a shift from the current focus on a productivity-only AI model (with an emphasises on cutting costs at the expense of worker well-being and creativity) to a prosperity-first AI model, championing AI's potential to improve human life, promote fairness, and ensure sustainable progress alongside economic growth. Shujaat then breaks down the differences between the two models in four scenarios: software development, product management, go-to market, and recruitment (see FIG 19), as well as outlining three steps for leaders seeking to build a prosperity-first AI strategy: (1) Adopt a Prosperity-First True North and Accountability Measures for AI Adoption. (2) Put Employees in the Pilot Seat. (3) Commit to Responsible AI Development; Integrate AI Ethically and Inclusively. FIG 19: Productivity Only vs. Prosperity First AI – Recruitment (Source: Shujaat Ahmad) BCG - Women Leaders in Tech Are Paving the Way in GenAI A recent BCG study finds that that senior women in technical functions are ahead of their male peers in adopting GenAI—but junior women are lagging behind (see FIG 20). The study identifies three key attributes that correlate with gender disparities in GenAI adoption: (1) Awareness of GenAI’s criticality to job success. (2) Confidence in GenAI skills. (3) Risk tolerance for using GenAI prior to having a company policy. The authors (Maria Barisano Neveen Awad Adriana Dahik Julie Bedard Uche M. Gunjan Mundhra and Katherine Lou) conclude that if the number of senior and junior women with GenAI skills increases, then it’s likely that women’s representation in tech leadership will grow, and call for highly targeted upskilling programs, leadership advocacy and change management. FIG 20: Women leaders in tech are ahead in GenAI adoption (Source: BCG) HR TECH VOICES Much of the innovation in the field continues to be driven by the vendor community, and I’ve picked out a few resources from June that I recommend readers delve into: RICHARD ROSENOW - 6 Emerging People Analytics Trends for a People-Focused Future – Richard Rosenow of One Model shares his observations on shifts in the people analytics field including related to regulation, team structure and focus, and the people data supply chain (see FIG 21).

BOOK OF THE MONTH SHARNA WIBLEN - Rethinking Talent Decisions: A Tale of Complexity, Technology and Subjectivity In ReThinking Talent Decisions, Sharna Wiblen, presents an uncomfortable truth: Talent decisions are always subjective. Drawing on examples from business, sports, movies and everyday interactions, Sharna emphasises the importance of understanding complexity and encourages deliberate, intentional, and informed decisions and conversations around talent. For a teaser from the book, read my expert interview with Sharna: Rethinking Talent Decisions and Navigating Subjectivity in HR. RESEARCH REPORT OF THE MONTH NICHOLAS BLOOM, RUOBING HAN, AND JAMES LIANG - Hybrid working from home improves retention without damaging performance There are a lot of opinions about the impact of hybrid work and some executives argue that it damages productivity, innovation and career development. But what does the data say? In their study, Nick Bloom Ruobing Han and James Liang find that hybrid working improved job satisfaction and reduced quit rates by one-third. The reduction in quit rates was significant for non-managers, female employees and those with long commutes (see FIG 24). For more from on this topic, listen to Nick Bloom in conversation with me on the Digital HR Leaders podcast: Unmasking Common Myths Around Remote Work.

I first chaired the event in 2014, and over the last decade People Analytics World has established itself as the go-to event in Europe for the field. The 2024 edition was sold out with close to 400 people attending across the two days (4x compared to 2014!). I had the privilege of co-chairing, along with Cole Napper and Michael M. Moon, PhD and also delivering the opening keynote on how leading companies deliver value with people analytics, based on our research at Insight222. You can find the slides I shared in the keynote below. These include the results of three polls I ran with attendees at People Analytics World on (1) the current state of people analytics in their organisation, (2) the financial impact of people analytics in the last 12 months, and (3) the data literacy of HR professionals. Additionally, you can also access the Insight222 research I shared here. The conference only ended a few days ago, but already many of the attendees have shared some of their key takeaways and learnings. Do check out the ones from Patrick Coolen (here), Giovanna Constant (here), Sebastian Knepper (here), Mariana Rossi Campos (here), Fatma Hedeya (here), Pietro Mazzoleni (here), Maria Manso Garcia (here), Ekkehard Ernst (here), Marcela Mury (here) and Jaejin Lee (here). Finally on People Analytics World, congratulations to Barry Swales and the Tucana team for organising such a successful event, thank you to all those who attended the Insight222 dinner, visited the Insight222 stand and who took the time to interact with me over the two days. Lastly, thank you to all of the brilliant speakers and panellists in the Plenary sessions and Strategy track that I moderated: Richard Rosenow Ian Cook Sue Lam Rob Briner Peter Cheese Aizhan Tursunbayeva, PhD, GRP Abigail Gilbert Alexis Saussinan Michael Cox Gemma McNair David Shontz Amit Mohindra Clare Moncrieff Jo Thackray Lucie Vottova Andrew Elston Rob Etheridge Isabel Naidoo James Fenlon and Ekkehard Ernst.

HYBRID, GENERATIVE AI AND THE FUTURE OF WORK DIANE GHERSON AND LYNDA GRATTON - Highly Skilled Professionals Want Your Work But Not Your Job Without question, there has been a huge shift. Many of the individuals we’re looking to attract—in technology, data sciences, machine learning, blockchain, and the internet of things—have a different mindset now. They want more-flexible working arrangements. This quote from Peter Fasolo, Ph.D. chief human resources officer at Johnson & Johnson, perfectly captures the challenge that Diane Gherson and Lynda Grattonhighlight in their article for Harvard Business Review: more and more workers want to work as freelancers. As the article highlights, Gartner predict that independent workers will make up 35% to 40% of the global workforce by 2025. Moreover, one-third earn more than $150,000 per year, and just over half were providing knowledge services—such as computer programming, marketing, IT, and business consulting. Integrating and managing what this ‘blended workforce’ will be one of the main managerial challenges in the years ahead. Based on their interviews with executives at leading companies that are experimenting with how best to bring freelancers into their organisations, Diane and Lynda set out some guidance and highlight emerging management practices that forward-looking companies are embracing. These include: (1) Helping freelancers understand and embrace company culture. (2) Following rigorous practices to retain institutional knowledge. (3) Adopting a ‘sponsor’ mindset to guide freelancers’ performance. (4) Leveraging digital workflows and building trust to manage changes in project needs. FIG 1: The Emerging Blended Workforce (Source: Diane Gherson and Lynda Gratton) LEILA HOTEIT, ANTON STEPANENKO, PAVEL LUKSHA, SAGAR GOEL, AND LEONID GORENBURG - The Next 50 Years of Work Contrary to popular fears that the future will offer fewer work opportunities for people, most experts anticipate that rewarding work options will be plentiful. The key finding of a recent BCG study is that workforce experts anticipate that jobs will flourish over the next fifty years, with four boundaries framing the future growth of the economy (see FIG 2). The study, authored by Leila Hoteit Anton Stepanenko Pavel Luksha Sagar Goel and Leonid Gorenburgalso highlights bionic skills (e.g. tech literacy, data-driven decision making, AI-enhanced creativity, and ease with human-machine collaboration) and creativity as the skills that will be in highest demand. But to complement these skills, workers should also cultivate adaptability and the ability to take initiative. FIG 2: The four boundaries within which the future economy will grow (Source: BCG) ETHAN MOLLICK - Reinventing the Organization for GenAI and LLMs Consider this an early eulogy for the traditional organizational structure, which began in 1855 with the first modern organizational chart and thrived, more or less successfully, until the 2020s, when it succumbed to a new technology, the large language model (LLM). That’s the bold claim by Ethan Mollick in his compulsive article in MIT Sloan Management Review. While he concedes that previous waves of technology have ushered in innovations that have strengthened traditional organisational structures, Mollick makes the case that GenAI and LLMs are different. He then outlines three principles for reorganising work around AI: (1) Identify and enlist your current AI users. (2) Let teams develop their own methods. (3) Build for the not-so-distant future. If you enjoy this article, I recommend subscribing to Mollick’s One Useful Thing blog. BCG - What GenAI’s Top Performers Do Differently The top GenAI performers have the biggest lead across five main capabilities: a clear link to business performance, modern technology infrastructure, strong data capabilities, leadership support, and a grounding in responsible AI. While GenAI is becoming an integral part of business ecosystems, only 10% of companies have mastered scaling GenAI to create value and secure other benefits from this transformative technology (see FIG 3). That’s according to recent research by BCG, which finds that 10% of companies lead in five key areas: (1) a clear link to business performance, (2) modern technology infrastructure, (3) strong data capabilities, (4) leadership support, and (5) a grounding in responsible AI. A helpful read for HR leaders as they think how HR can lead organisational transformation in the age of AI as well as incorporate the technology into HR programs too. (Authors: Amanda Luther Romain de Laubier Nicolas de Bellefonds Tauseef Charanya Suraj Shah Kevin Nnaemeka Ifiora and Patrick Forth) FIG 3: Three categories of companies in relation to GenAI adoption (Source: BCG) PEOPLE ANALYTICS PATRICK COOLEN - The 10 golden rules for establishing a people analytics practice A successful people analytics practice starts with the right people analytics leader Patrick Coolen’s first iteration of his ’10 golden rules for people analytics’ (one prescient ‘rule’ was to combine strategic workforce planning and analytics) was published in 2014 when he was in the early stages of building the function at ABN Amro. A decade on, Patrick updates his seminal article, with insights from his own career journey, Ph.D research, and the evolution of the field itself. As ever, Patrick is right on the mark with his ten selections including these three: (1) The people analytics leader can make the difference, (2) Create a clear people analytics operating model, and (3) Upskill HR in data-driven decision making. PIETRO MAZZOLENI - Mastering data governance for effective people data platforms: lessons from what we did at IBM Data Governance is the process that ensures the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data in enterprise systems Pietro Mazzoleni shares the three key elements related to ‘governance-by-design’ that together provided the fundamental principles underlying the design and implementation of Workforce360, IBM’s people data platform. In the article, Pietro presents the three elements – trust, transparency and compliance (see FIG 4) – and provides a detailed description of each. FIG 4: Key governance questions to consider when designing a people data platform (Source: Pietro Mazzoleni) JASDEEP KAREER - The Importance of Data and Upskilling in Driving Growth Jasdeep Kareer, PhD (née Bhambra) shares key learnings from the recent Peer Meeting for North American member companies of the Insight222 People Analytics Program, which was hosted by Colgate-Palmolive in their global headquarters in New York. The Peer Meeting, which was attended by more than 60 people analytics leaders and practitioners from more than 40 companies was framed on the key findings from the Insight222 People Analytics Trends study for 2023. In her article, Jas highlights five themes from the Peer Meeting: (1) The importance of data and upskilling in driving growth (with insights from Sally Massey). (2) How strategic partnerships and data governance pave the way for successful People Analytics initiatives (with insights from Courtney McMahon Pavel Nouel and Nayana Pai). (3) How insights-driven decision-making and storytelling can drive impactful outcomes in People Analytics (with insights from Durrell Blake Robinson and Mona Routray). (4) Factors influencing the adoption of people analytics (with insights from Patrick Coolen and Brydie Lear).

In recent editions of the Data Driven HR Monthly, I’ve been featuring a collection of articles by current and recent people analytics leaders. These act as a spur and inspiration to the field. Five are highlighted here. (1) Burak Bakkaloglu dedicates an edition of his If Interested blog to the topic of GenAI including breaking down three layers of GenAI for HR (see FIG 6). (2) Keith McNulty provides a tutorial (including code) on how he built a 'Keith-bot' to answer questions on statistics based on the content of his regression textbook, using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. (3) Katie Guarino also provides a practical framework on how to use ChatGPT as your personal consultant and coach on any topic, regardless of your expertise in it. (4) Natalia Gormann discusses challenges for people teams to build partnerships with finance before guidance on how to build an effective data strategy to support employee experience strategies. (5) Patrick Gallagher looks at the case for and against measuring employee engagement, concluding that organisations with mature employee listening and PA functions just don’t need it anymore.

Drawing on McKinsey research that finds companies that put talent at the centre of their business strategy realise higher total shareholder returns than their competitors, Vincent Bérubé Ben Fogarty Neel Gandhi Rahul Mathew Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi and Charlotte Seiler outline five actions organisations can take to maximise their return on talent. The five actions are: (1) Build a skills-based strategic workforce planning capability. (2) Create a hiring engine that brings in the right talent to fill critical roles. (3) Invest in learning and development. ((4) Establish a stellar performance-oriented culture. (5) Elevate HR’s operating model to become a true talent steward. FIG 7: Factors that drag down employee and organisational productivity (Source: McKinsey) PETER CAPPELLI AND RANYA NEHMEH – HR’s New Role If leaders realized that the true cost of turnover is often a multiple of an employee’s annual salary, they would immediately demand changes. In their thoughtful article for Harvard Business Review, Peter Cappelli and Ranya Nehmeh set out the case for the HR function to return to its roots as employee advocates. They argue that in a period of low unemployment and labour supply shortages, focusing on cost-cutting and restructuring is counterproductive and the onus should instead be on retention and preventing burnout. To realise this, HR needs to change outdated policies on compensation, training and development, layoffs, vacancies, outsourcing, and restructuring. Cappelli and Nehmeh recommend the first step should be for HR to create dashboards with metrics on the true costs of turnover, absenteeism, reasons for quitting, illness rates, and employee engagement. They contend that: “If leaders realized that the true cost of turnover is often a multiple of an employee’s annual salary, they would immediately demand changes.\" They also outline guidance on why and how to measure employee stress – particularly with regards to AI and restructuring. The article also provides examples of companies with HR functions that are moving to an employee advocacy approach. These include the likes of Walmart and Neiman Marcus (both on compensation and reward), as well as IBM and Unilever (both internal talent mobility). DAVE ULRICH - Upgrading HR Professionals: How to Develop HR Professionals so They Rise to Their Opportunity HR matters. Now more than ever. In a recent article from his Human Capability Impact LinkedIn newsletter, Dave Ulrich explains why HR functions and professionals are rising in importance, and then lays out a playbook, process and assessment designed to develop HR professionals so they can fulfil expectations and rise to the opportunity (see FIG 8).

LEIDNER – Resolving Workforce Skills Gaps with AI-Powered Insights As Christina Norris-Watts and Doug Shagam shared with me in an episode of the Digital HR Leaders podcast, Johnson & Johnson has used AI-driven skills inference as part of their skills transformation (see: How Johnson & Johnson are Scaling Their Skills-Based Approach to Talent). In their paper for MIT, Nick van der Meulen Olgerta Tona and Dorothy Leidner provide an in-depth case study on Johnson & Johnson to demonstrate how skills inference can provide detailed insight into workforce skills gaps and thereby guide employees’ career development and leaders’ strategic workforce planning. The paper includes a detailed description of the three steps of the skills inference process (see FIG 9). The sections in the paper on employee trust, privacy and use cases are particularly instructional for companies looking to emulate this work in their organisations. FIG 9: The three steps of the skills inference process (Source: MIT Center for Information Systems Research) JORDAN PETTMAN - Workforce Planning: A Beginner's Guide to Strategic Success Jordan Pettman, one of my many talented colleagues at Insight222, shares some tips and guidance for practitioners looking to start or accelerate their workforce planning efforts. He highlights the Nine Dimensions for Excellence in Strategic Workforce Planning model we use with clients at Insight222 (see FIG 10), explaining that you need to consider each of the decision points that the model presents in terms of getting the foundations right, ensuring your resources are fit for purpose and that you deliver value out of the cycle for the business and employees. Jordan also shares insights from the likes of Jonas Ottiger and Gergo Safar as part of his guidance on two key elements: workforce planning essentials and building skills-based workforce planning.

Emily Killham highlights the key findings from Perceptyx’s third annual State of Employee Listening report, which is informed by survey of more than 750 senior HR leaders from global firms with at least 1,000 employees. These include: (1) 78% of firms surveyed conduct some kind of listening event at least once a quarter, compared to 70% in 2023 and 60% in 2022. (2) Nearly 40% of organisations can share listening data with managers within two weeks. (3) When compared with their peers, the most mature listening organisations are 6x more likely to exceed financial targets, 9x more likely to achieve high levels of customer satisfaction, 4x more likely to retain talent, even during times of high attrition, 7x more likely to adapt well to change, and 7x more likely to innovate effectively. FIG 11: Employee Listening Maturity (Source: Perceptyx) NICK LYNN - Trust and Distrust: Why and how you may need to tackle both Building trust is not always sufficient, you may also need to tackle the causes of distrust. The problems are not always the same. They may sometimes require different solutions. Nick Lynn constructs a wonderful treatise on ‘trust’ and ‘distrust’ in organisations and offers potential solutions to build the former and tackle the latter. Through analysing four models to build trust, Nick identifies some common ingredients including: communication, consistency, integrity, fairness, empathy, and psychological safety. When it comes to tackling distrust, he assembles four elements of organisational health: work, total rewards, people, and purpose into a framework of employee experience leadership (see FIG 12). FIG 12: Driving employee experience through connection and contribution (Source: Nick Lynn) STEPHANIE DENINO, TIMO TISCHER, AND DAVID GREEN - Moving Towards Excellence in EX Management In the January edition of Data-Driven HR Monthly, I highlighted the fascinating report State of EX 2023-24 study, published by The EXchange, Inc, TI PEOPLE and FOUNT Global, Inc. In this article, for myHRfuture, I interview Stephanie Denino and Timo Tischer, two of the contributors to the study. We dig into what constitutes ‘excellence’ in EX management, the barriers and how to overcome them, and the priorities for EX teams in 2024 (see FIG 13). Stephanie and Timo also provide tips for organisations looking to manage EX more deliberately, which includes: (1) Identifying the moments that matter, (2) Measuring and listening continuously to people’s experiences across these moments, and (3) Clarifying responsibilities (who ‘owns’ which journeys, moments and/or touchpoints) to ensure accountability, and improving high importance / low satisfaction moments.

The big differentiator is the ability to craft smart prompts. The ability to ask great questions is a powerful skill for unlocking value – especially in the age of AI. As such, the cover article of the current edition of the Harvard Business Review by Arnaud Chevallier Frédéric Dalsace and Jean-Louis Barsoux of IMD Business School is well worth digging into. The authors provide a typology of five topics of questions to ask during strategic decision making: (1) investigative, (2) speculative, (3) productive, (4) interpretive, and (5) subjective (see FIG 15). The article also includes a self-assessment that enables readers to evaluate the types of questions that are their strong and weak points, and then provides guidance to help you improve. From completing the assessment myself, it seems I need to work on my subjective questioning technique. FIG 15: What’s your question mix?

These leaders play a key role in transforming organizations that are leveraging data and AI to increase business value. An excellent example from Lufthansa on how they created a program to educate leaders on data leadership, and how it provided insights on the roles that people play in data-driven change. In their article, Christian Haude Ivo Blohm and Xavier Lagardere outline the challenge the program was designed to solve, the six different roles for data leaders that were defined (see FIG 16), details of the three training modules: Spark, Inspire and Activate, and four key strategies for success. FIG 16: Data Leadership: Six key roles (Source: Haude et al) SHARNA WIBLEN AND DAVID GREEN - Rethinking Talent Decisions and Navigating Subjectivity in HR Accumulating deliberate, intentional, and informed decisions can unleash exponential returns. In her book, Rethinking Talent Decisions, Sharna Wiblen highlights an uncomfortable truth: Talent decisions are always subjective. As such, I was delighted to explore this in more depth with Sharna in an article for myHRfuture. In the article, Sharna, an Assistant Professor and Senior Lecturer at Sydney Business School, University of Wollongong, unpacks the nuanced role of subjectivity in talent decisions and the symbiotic relationship between technology and human judgment in the workplace. The uncomfortable truth is that decisions about talent are invariably coloured by personal perceptions, and instead of shying away, Sharna argues that we should lean into this discomfort to emerge with more informed and nuanced strategies. HR TECH VOICES Much of the innovation in the field continues to be driven by the vendor community, and I’ve picked out a few resources from April that I recommend readers delve into: FRANZ GILBERT, MATTHEW SHANNON, AND ERIN SPENCER - 2024 HR tech predictions: Headless platforms place HR tech in the flow of work – The Deloitte Human Capital Forward team of Franz Gilbert Matthew Shannon and Erin Spencer outline the key HR technology trends they believe will drive innovation in the field in 2024 (see FIG 17).

The book features case studies from the likes of Visa, CVS, and Hilton, and is a recommended resource for HR, EX, and L&D professionals looking to understand and/or roll digital coaching within their companies. RESEARCH REPORT OF THE MONTH ROB BRINER – Evidence-Based HR: A New Paradigm Evidence-based HR (EBHR) is a process which delivers more informed and hence more accurate answers to two fundamental questions: first, which are the most important problems (or opportunities) facing the organisation which are relevant to HR? Second, which solutions (or interventions) are most likely to help? These are the opening words to a recently published report from the Corporate Research Forum (CRF), authored by Rob Briner, on Evidence-Based HR (EBHR). The report tackles, the why, what, and how of EBHR, explains why it is not the same as people analytics, provides case studies from Thales, Uber and the Financial Conduct Authority, and provides a practical toolkit for practitioners on the EBHR process (see FIG 19).

Just as organizations were settling into a new normal — with a focus on hybrid working, comprehensive health and well-being, digitalization, and upskilling — Generative AI (Gen AI) burst onto the scene. Those are the opening words from the Mercer Global Talent Trends 2024 report, which has recently been published. As ever, the study, which is based on a survey of more than 12,000 executives, HR leaders, employees, and investors, and is authored by Kate Bravery Joana Silva and Jens Peterson is an absolute must-read. The study highlights a disconnect between what HR is prioritising for the 2024 people agenda and the initiatives that executives believe will have the most impact on business growth (see FIG 1). The study highlights four priorities that firms that outpace their competitors are focusing on: (1) Driving human-centric productivity. (2) Anchoring to trust and equity. (3) Boosting the corporate immune system. (4) Cultivating a digital-first culture. My tip to enjoy the study: find a couple of hours, make yourself a cup of tea and have a pen and paper to hand. FIG 1: HR priorities for the 2024 people agenda (Source: Mercer Global Talent Trends 2024) FIG 2: Drivers and drainers of employee productivity(Source: Mercer Global Talent Trends 2024) HYBRID, GENERATIVE AI AND THE FUTURE OF WORK BRIAN ELLIOTT - Return-to-Office Mandates: How to Lose Your Best Performers There is mounting evidence that mandates don’t improve financial performance. Instead, they damage employee engagement and increase attrition, especially among high-performing employees and particularly those with caregiving responsibilities. That’s according to Brian Elliott in his latest column in MIT Sloan Management Review, which highlights that the workers most likely to be turned off by return-to-office mandates are the company’s highest performers. Elliott highlights the link between factors such as pressure from investors and the CEO echo chamber with RTO pronouncements, as well as how only one in three executives believe that RTO has had even a slight impact on productivity. He recommends instead focusing on productivity rather than physical presence (see FIG 3) and how this can inspire a boom loop in engagement as opposed to a doom loop in trust. Finally, Elliott presents findings from the Future Forum and i4CP, highlighting the negative impact of RTO mandates, before offering guidance on how to build an outcomes-driven organisation: “The bottom line is that when trust is balanced with accountability, people and organizations will thrive.” FIG 3: Focus on Productivity, Not Physical Presence (Sources: Future Forum, Centre for Transformative Work Design, and Slack) AARON DE SMET, SANDRA DURTH, BRYAN HANCOCK, MARINO MUGAYAR-BALDOCCHI, AND ANGELIKA REICH - The human side of generative AI: Creating a path to productivity As teams start using gen AI to help free up their capacity, the middle manager’s job will evolve to managing both people and the use of this technology to enhance their output. A fascinating new study from McKinsey, which provides analysis on workers who are at the forefront of gen AI usage (which as FIG 4 shows is dominated by those in non-technical roles) and dives into the job factors and skills these workers say they need. The authors emphasise how firms can enhance productivity by crafting jobs that put people before tech – rather than the other way around. They conclude that companies that set a people-centric talent strategy will give themselves a competitive edge as more workers and jobs are affected by the changes gen AI brings. The article is rich with data and powerful visualisations – kudos to the authors: Aaron De Smet Sandra Durth Bryan Hancock Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi and Angelika Reich ). FIG 4: Workers who use generative AI as part of their jobs comprise a much larger group than those who hold traditionally technical roles (Source: McKinsey) PETER CAPPELLI, PRASANNA (SONNY) TAMBE, AND VALERY YAKUBOVICH - Will Large Language Models Really Change How Work Is Done? LLMs are much more complicated to use effectively in an organizational context than is typically acknowledged, and they have yet to demonstrate that they can satisfactorily perform all of the tasks that knowledge workers execute in any given job. In their article, Peter Cappelli Prasanna Tambe and Valery Yakubovich look at the use and challenges of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in organisations, and present practical recommendations on how to work with LLMs successfully. The five challenges outlined in the article are: (1) The Knowledge Capture Problem. (2) The Output Verification Problem. (3) The Output Adjudication Problem. (4) The Cost-Benefit Problem. (5) The Job Transformation Problem – How will LLMs work with workers? Guidance includes developing and circulating standards for the use of LLMs in organisations, establishing a central office to produce important LLM output, and providing training to users. NICK BLOOM – Why WFH is a win-win-win | WFH research update (March 2024) Nick Bloom’s recent post on LinkedIn highlighting his research on why remote working is a win for firms (due to increased productivity of $20,000 a year for each remote day a week), employees, and society is extremely compelling. I also recommend reading Nick’s latest monthly data for March, which includes numerous insights such as that workers in their 50s and 60s are fully onsite more often than younger workers. For more from Nick, please tune in to his discussion with me on the Digital HR Leaders podcast: Unmasking Common Myths Around Remote Work.

In this edition, Pietro walks through the three tiers of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) IBM uses to evaluate investments in Workforce 360, its people data platform (see FIG 6). Watch out for an upcoming episode of the Digital HR Leaders podcast, where I discuss with CHRO Nickle LaMoreaux how IBM is augmenting HR programs with AI. The episode will air from April 9.

The Peer Meeting, which was attended by over 60 people analytics leaders and practitioners from more than 40 companies focused on two of the key findings from the Insight222 People Analytics Trends study for 2023: influencing senior stakeholders and measuring value. In her article, Naomi covers four topics: (1) how to implement a people analytics operating model that drives business outcomes (based on insights shared at the Peer Meeting by Rob Etheridge and Bec Aoude). (2) how to use AI to democratise insights from people data, using an example of work Andrew Elston has led at HSBC. (3) how Microsoft’s employee listening ecosystem (see FIG 7) helped the firm identify the moments that matter for in-person collaboration (insights from a session led by Dawn Klinghoffer), and (4) how to influence the board of directors, with insights from Justine Thompson. If you would like to learn more about our People Analytics Program, contact us today. FIG 7: Microsoft’s employee listening ecosystem (Source: Dawn Klinghoffer, Microsoft) BRENT DYKES - The Future Of Data Storytelling Is Augmented, Not Automated Brent Dykes continues his rich vein of writing with an article exploring whether AI tools should be used to automate data storytelling. He provides reasons why data storytelling can’t or shouldn’t be automated including for reasons of oversimplification, transparency and trust, and the fact that storytelling is essentially a human skill. Instead, Brent advocates that the path forward should be augmented data storytelling, and lays out a powerful illustration of how this would work (see FIG 8) The most powerful person in the world is the storyteller. The storyteller sets the vision, values, and agenda of an entire generation that is to come.

Part 1 & Part 2 | WILLIS JENSEN – Can Data Cleaning be Automated? | COLE NAPPER - Universal Models & People Analytics | ALEXANDER LOCHER - How to harness the value of people data and operational HR insights | ANGELA LE MATHON, STACIA GARR, AND DANI JOHNSON - Generating Value from People Data In recent editions of the Data Driven HR Monthly, I’ve been featuring a collection of articles by current and recent people analytics leaders. These act as a spur and inspiration to the field. Five are highlighted here. (1) If you don’t already follow Hallie Bregman, PhD on LinkedIn, you really should. Hallie regularly publishes thoughtful and insightful posts on topics important to the field. The two I’ve included here look at the pros and cons of situating people analytics in or outside HR. (2) Willis Jensen analyses whether AI will reduce the amount of data cleaning undertaken by people analysts given that much of this work involves judgement without hard, fast or consistent rules. (3) Cole Napper, who I’m looking forward to co-chairing People Analytics World with in London in April – also with Michael M. Moon, PhD – explains how many of the models we use in people analytics are borrowed from other disciplines. (4) Alexander S. Locher highlights some of the current trends in people analytics (see FIG 9) and offers guidance on how to harness value from your people data.

That’s the standout finding from a new global survey by Jo Iwasaki Karen Edelman and Dr Yasmine Chahed for Deloitte of 500 board members and C-suite executives in more than 50 countries on corporate governance and talent. The three top insights from the study were: (1) Many boards could be focusing more on talent-related issues. (2) Most organisations are just starting to think about their AI strategies. (3) Amplifying the talent experience will require boards to adopt a broader perspective. FIG 10: Workplace related topics that are top board priorities (Source: Deloitte) DAVE ULRICH - Pre-flections on GenAI and HR: Where to Go and How to Get There GenAI will help shape HR’s future by offering both information symmetry to synthesize and optimize the past and present and information asymmetry to create and guide the future. Dave Ulrich offers some initial reflections on what the journey could look like for applying GenAI to HR work, as well as some possible actions to drive progress (see example in FIG 11 for ‘Talent’). Dave also highlights four important considerations to manage the risk and realise the opportunity of GenAI in HR. (1) Who should champion, sponsor, participate in, and be accountable for this journey? (2) What individual skills and organisation capabilities will be required to make GenAI in HR happen? (3) What will be the regulatory and legal policies and risks associated with the effort? (4) What metrics of value-added GenAI for HR will be most useful and tracked? FIG 11: Examples of GenAI/HR initiatives in the Talent domain (Source: Dave Ulrich) HEIN KNAPPEN - How HR Adds to Enterprise Value Hein J.M. Knaapen, a former chief people officer himself, shares his perspectives on the crucial role HR plays in driving business value, and offers practical advice to CHROs on how to make this a reality. Hein highlights the four people priorities that connect to value: (1) Performance management, (2) Succession management, (3) Leadership development, and (4) Capability building, providing guidance on each. Value creation should be the focus. Nothing else. And only four people priorities connect to value: performance management, succession management, leadership development and capability building. WORKFORCE PLANNING, ORG DESIGN, AND SKILLS-BASED ORGANISATIONS STEFAN HIERL - Identifying the AI Potential in Your Organization: A Strategic Approach Leveraging Generative AI to assess the AI Potential in a workforce helps businesses go beyond just talking about how AI might change jobs. As Stefan Hierl astutely observes in his excellent article, in the rush to jump on the AI bandwagon, many companies fall into the trap of overlooking a critical preliminary step: conducting a systematic evaluation of where AI can deliver transformative value. In his article, Stefan outlines a five-step approach to quantify the potential of AI to support organisations identify opportunities for automating and augmenting work activities. The five steps (see FIG 12), which Stefan outlines in detail are: (1) Decomposing roles by breaking down each role into its main activities and respective time shares. (2) AI potential assessment – estimating the potential of AI at the activity level. (3) Expert validation – cross-verifying the generative AI findings with domain experts. (4) Identify high-value areas – creating an overview where AI can significantly enhance workforce productivity (see example in FIG 13). (5) Use case development – exploring specific AI applications to capitalise on identified potential.

This is one of the standout findings from a new study by Matt Sigelman and Alex Martin of The Burning Glass Institute and Joseph Fuller from Harvard Business School. Their analysis reveals three categories of firms, who have publicly stated they have removed degree requirements in hiring, based on their actual hiring outcomes: (1) Skills-based hiring leaders (e.g. Cigna) – who have increased their share of non-degree hires in the roles analysed by nearly 20%. (2) In name only (e.g. Bank of America) – 45% of firms studied have made the shift in name only with no meaningful difference in actual skills-based hiring. (3) Backsliders e.g. Uber) – 20% of the firms analysed had made short-term gains by dropping degree requirements, but the change doesn’t stick. The report also highlights the roles best positioned for skills-based hiring (see FIG 14).
