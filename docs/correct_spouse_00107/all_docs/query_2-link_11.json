        "text": "The playwright and screenwriter Luther Davis, who has died aged 91, had his biggest success as the co-writer (with Charles Lederer) of the book of the Broadway musical Kismet (1953), the score of which was derived from the music of Alexander Borodin.\n\nDespite the fact that the exotic show was unjustly called \"a borrowed din\" by one smart-alec critic, it was a huge hit for which Davis and Lederer won a Tony, as did the musical, which starred Alfred Drake and Doretta Morrow. Furthermore, Kismet was made into an MGM movie extravaganza, directed by Vincente Minnelli in 1955, starring Howard Keel and Ann Blyth. It was adapted for television in 1967 with Jos√© Ferrer and Anna Maria Alberghetti, and was transmogrified into Timbuktu, a 1978 Broadway musical, shifted from ancient Baghdad to Africa, with an all-black cast headed by Eartha Kitt; Davis produced it and wrote the book.\n\nHe was born in Brooklyn, the son of Charles T Davis, a businessman and inventor whose surgical supply company developed improvements in sutures. In 1921, when Luther was four, his father was in his office when he was visited by two police officers and an insurance adjuster. Apparently believing them to be robbers, he shot them, killing a police officer and wounding the others. He was convicted of manslaughter and went to prison for some years. This incident may have influenced Davis's screenplay for Lady in a Cage (1964), which seems to imply that everybody is capable of violence. \"We built cities and towns and we thought we had beaten the jungle back ... not knowing we had built the jungle in,\" says Olivia de Havilland in the title role of a wealthy woman trapped in a lift and terrorised by the dregs of society.\n\nThere was little in Davis's background to suggest a career in show business. He studied at Culver military academy in Indiana and then at Yale, graduating in 1938. During the second world war he served in intelligence in the US Army air corps in Asia and Europe, rising to the rank of major.\n\nIn 1945, just demobbed, he turned the novel Shore Leave, by Frederic Wakeman, into a Broadway play entitled Kiss Them for Me, about three sailors on leave in San Francisco during the war. It featured Richard Widmark and Judy Holliday, prior to their film careers, and dealt with the stress of combat with wit and sensitivity. Davis sold the play to 20th Century Fox, but by the time it was screened in 1957 (with a script by Julius Epstein), directed by Stanley Donan and starring Cary Grant and Jayne Mansfield, it had lost much of its impact and was played mostly for laughs.\n\nDavis's first screenplay, again adapting a Wakeman novel, was The Hucksters (1947), a smart romantic comedy-drama with Clark Gable and Deborah Kerr (her first Hollywood role) which takes swipes at radio advertising. In a speech, fast-talking sales executive Gable says: \"I want to go on record as saying that I think radio has to turn over a new leaf. We've pushed and badgered the listeners, we've sung to them and screamed at them, we've insulted them, cheated them and angered them, turned their homes into a combination grocery store, crap game and midway [funfair]. Some day, 50 million people are going to just reach out and turn off their radios...\"\n\nBarbara Stanwyck was the eponymous BF's Daughter (1948), from the satirical John P Marquand novel on attitudes to wealth which Davis turned into a glossy \"women's picture\" for MGM, to whom he was under contract. The last of the three movies he wrote for MGM was The Black Hand (1950), a taut melodrama and one of the first American films about the mafia. However, it suffered somewhat from Gene Kelly's unconvincing portrayal of an Italian-American pursuing a vendetta against a man who killed his father. Davis returned to the mafia more successfully and more violently 22 years later in his final screenplay, Across 110th Street (1972), in which Anthony Quinn played an ageing cop.\n\nA Lion Is in the Streets (1953), directed by Raoul Walsh - the best director Davis had for his screenplays - was based on the life of Huey Long, but the filming was delayed to stave off a law suit by Long's estate. It turned out to be an ideal vehicle for James Cagney as the pugnacious populist 1930s Southern demagogue.\n\nHowever, Davis's most notorious film was Lady in a Cage, his only original screenplay, a notch above the many lurid shockers featuring ageing female stars made in the wake of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, two years previously. In it, he made both the victim and her tormentors equally unsympathetic. At one point, De Havilland turns on one of her persecutors (27-year-old James Caan, in his first film role) and declares: \"You're one of the many bits of offal produced by the welfare state. You're what so much of my tax dollars goes to the care and feeding of!\"\n\nDavis ended his career on a high in 1989 with his book for the Broadway musical Grand Hotel (music and lyrics by Robert Wright and George Forrest, the same pair that had helped to create Kismet). Given a lively production by Tommy Tune, it won five Tonys (Davis's book was nominated) and ran for more than 1,000 performances.\n\nDavis is survived by his wife, the actor Jennifer Bassey, whom he married in 2005 after living together for 27 years, and two daughters by his first wife."
