        "text": "American actress (born 1939)\n\nJennifer Bassey (born July 22, 1939) is an American actress who has worked on both stage and screen. She is perhaps best known for her role as Marian Colby in the ABC soap opera All My Children which she played on and off from 1983 until the show's cancellation in 2011.\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\nBassey was born in Chicago, Illinois. After graduating from Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, Bassey moved back to the United States and took roles in several Off-Broadway plays. This led to further work in daytime soap operas.\n\nAfter appearing in Love of Life, The Edge of Night, and Somerset, Bassey changed her professional name from \"Joan Bassie\" to \"Jennifer Bassey.\" She chose the name Jennifer from Dr. Jennifer Stark, the role she had played on Love of Life. In the early 1990s, Bassey was one of several actresses brought in briefly to replace Eileen Fulton as Lisa on As the World Turns while Fulton was ill.\n\nShe began playing Marian Colby on ABC's soap opera All My Children (1983-1987, 1989, 1995-2009, 2011). She has appeared on All My Children for over 20 years and was a favorite among fans.\n\nA libidinous wealthy widow with a penchant for forbidden romantic trysts, Marian was featured in a variety of storylines, allowing Bassey to showcase a variety of talents in both comedy and drama. In 1998, Bassey won the Soap Opera Digest Award for \"Favorite Scene Stealer,\" and in 1999, alongside co-star David Canary, won the same award for \"Favorite Couple\". Also, in 1999, Bassey received her first Daytime Emmy nomination in the \"Outstanding Supporting Actress\" category. Bassey appeared on All My Children in both contract and recurring capacities until the show's 2011 network cancellation, but did not appear on the show's short-lived online incarnation.[1]\n\nBassey did not participate in the February 2, 2017 All My Children reunion on the Hallmark Channel's Home & Family show.[2] However, Home & Family did utilize footage of Bassey with actor Michael E. Knight from an infamous All My Children storyline wherein Knight's youthful Tad Martin had affairs with both Marian Colby and her daughter Liza (played by Marcy Walker).[2]\n\nBassey also has appeared in a number of prime time television shows, include a recurring roles on Falcon Crest and Grey's Anatomy, and well as guest shots on In the Heat of the Night, Who's the Boss?, Murphy Brown, Matlock, L.A. Law, and Law & Order. Her film credits include Waxwork (1988), The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990), Dunston Checks In (1996), and 27 Dresses (2007).\n\nIn 2017, Bassey returned to daytime television in both its traditional and new media incarnations, joining the casts of ABC soap opera General Hospital playing Quinn Danvers, and Daytime Emmy-winning digital soap opera Anacostia as Beverly Newman.[3][4] For her performance as Beverly on Anacostia, Bassey received her second Daytime Emmy nomination in the \"Outstanding Guest Performer in a Digital Drama\" category in 2018.[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nBassey has been married twice, she married attorney Roy F. Emery in 1971 until his death in 1991. In 2004, she married her longtime companion, playwright Luther Davis until his death in 2008 at the age of 91. In November 2016 she became engaged to George Bamford in Waikiki, Hawaii.[5]\n\nIn June 2015, Bassey made headlines when she was forced off a commercial airliner after a dispute with a flight attendant.[6][7][8]\n\nBassey resides in Manhattan and West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1988 Side by Side Jennifer Benson TV film Waxwork Mrs. Loftmore Goddess of Love Mrs. Wilson TV film 1989 Charlie Betty Wald TV film 1990 The Platinum Triangle Mrs. Farber The Bonfire of the Vanities Diplomat's Wife 1992 Twogether Mrs. McKenzie Stepfather III Dr. Brady TV film Revenge of the Nerds III: The Next Generation Ruth TV film Singles Uncredited 1994 Illicit Dreams Real Estate Woman 1996 Dunston Checks In Angela Dellacroce 2000 It Had to Be You Mrs. Allen 2008 27 Dresses Jane's Aunt 2011 The Brothers Sinclair Vivian Sinclair 2017 The Depths Mrs. Peters 2020 Kombucha Cure Hanna Nowacki Until We Meet Again Linda Davis Thompson Magic in Mount Holly Mrs. Halsen\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1969-1971 Love of Life Dr. Jennifer Stark 1975 Somerset Dorothy Conrad 1976-1977 The Edge of Night Abby Wolcott 1983-2011 All My Children Marian Colby Chandler Series regular 1984 Paper Dolls Anna Crane 1 episode 1985 ABC Weekend Special Mrs. Waterford Episode: \"Columbus Circle\" 1987 L.A.
