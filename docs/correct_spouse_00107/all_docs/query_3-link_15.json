        "text": "Leaf Rapids is a four-piece band of very talented musicians who are based in Winnipeg, Canada. Over the years, chief songwriter Keri Latimer has crafted superbly structured music and words that represent the unique sound of the group across three albums. The music they make is insightful, inspiring and lovingly layered with a natural grace and elegance. It is also hugely enjoyable and sprinkled with lots of magic dust. Keri is also involved in many other creative projects and Lonesome Highway spent some time with her recently and put these questions to her regarding her career in the music business and the evolution of the band.\n\nCongratulations on the release of your new album VELVET PAINTINGS. Have you been pleased with the response from the media and the public to the new songs?\n\nThank you! It’s really sweet to hear that something you’ve put much work and love into is resonating with people. The album reviews have been thoughtful and positive, and people have been kind enough to let us know how a certain song maybe comforted them through a tough time, or just to offer encouragement. We even had interest from a couple of labels, so it’s all been super validating and heartwarming.\n\nIt’s been five years since the previous release CITIZEN ALIEN and had you been writing during the Covid crisis towards this new release?\n\nOh boy. I was supposed to be writing during the “Pandy” as my friend likes to call it, but like a lot of folks, my brain and heart were all OVER the place. It got a little dark at times around the ol’ household, with our 2 teenagers ready to spread their wings and taste independence only to be locked down with the very people they are wired to rebel against. I think I used a lot of my creative energy just trying to keep it together, so there wasn’t a lot of poetry. I mean, I tried to write, in fact the song, Starling to a Starling, went through about 14 versions of itself. It just couldn’t land, but it wouldn’t let go either. Thankfully I did finally find my way back to songwriting just in the nick of time.\n\nThis time out you co-produced with John Paul Peters. How was that as a new experience?\n\nI can’t say enough good things about JP. He really threw his heart into this project, and kept the whole process inspiring and stress free. He is a wizard in the studio, and can comp tracks, set up a mic, massage your ego and order banh mi sandwiches all at the same time. We had actually booked 2 weeks for tracking and ended up only using 1, since we used a lot of the bed tracks live off the floor. They had such a good relaxed vibe, and the band just seemed to be ‘on.’ A lot of this is due to JP making us feel so comfortable in the studio, which is not always the case. Co-producing with him felt really natural and surprisingly we were able to accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. I say surprisingly because we’d often get caught up in conversations about all kinds of things and have to reel ourselves in.\n\nWhat is your creative process – a little and often, or more like waiting for the spirit to visit you?\n\nA bit of both. I think we all probably have a little gear secretly spinning in the background of our brains, picking up frequencies from the ether, processing, then randomly tossing out little nuggets here and there. The trick is to capture them before they disappear. I have a lot of embarrassing audio clips of melodies with gibberish-temp-lyrics in my iPhone, and texts and scribbles on scraps, which eventually get sifted through when I make the time to write.\n\nAre your songs rooted in personal or observational experience?\n\nI’m having trouble answering this question! I guess I would say both. Most of it is made up, imagining what observations the characters are making, but definitely drawing on personal experiences to keep it real. So, I guess I don’t write songs specifically about my personal experiences, but they are interwoven into the songs for sure.\n\nThere is a playfulness in the lyrics of songs such as Fast Romantics and Silver Fillings – they are sprinkled with a gentle sense of fun. I wondered if this was something you were striving towards?\n\nStriving to not strive was kind of the theme of the album. As I mentioned earlier, I was really struggling to find lyrics for the past while, and as the recording deadline loomed (our provincial funding for the album was about to expire) I had to make a conscious effort to just get over myself, and let go of any imagined pressure I was placing on the project. They’re just songs and I have an amazing band, so with them in mind, I reconnected with my love of songwriting. Where it feels more like discovery than creation, and you let the songs go where they will, and try not to get in the way.\n\nIn looking back over your career as a songwriter and performer what are the key perspectives that now stay with you?\n\nI think I have always been a slow developer. I didn’t start learning guitar until I was in art college studying graphic design. I didn’t start songwriting in earnest until after college, and I didn’t start understanding how much performing is a give and take experience until recently. I would be so nervous about not screwing up on stage that I wasn’t always aware of the energy coming back. I wish I could go back and point that out to my younger self, but maybe that just comes from experience. It feels much less about me these days, and more about tapping into that beautiful energy with my band and the audience. I have to keep reminding myself of it, though.\n\nIn 1996 you released an album with Christine Fellows as a duo, Special Fancy. What was that like as a first experience of the music industry and the release of KING ME?\n\nThis was a hugely formative time for me musically, and I was really lucky to be playing music with the calibre of musicians that were in Special Fancy at that early stage in my songwriting trajectory. I kept moving around from city to city back then, looking for my people, I guess. I was completely smitten by Christine’s singing and writing, and still am, she is brilliant. When she suggested we start a band together, I moved to Winnipeg for keeps. She kind of took me under her wing, and Special Fancy was my introduction to the interconnected music community here, which is a beautiful thing that I’m grateful to be a part of.\n\nIn 1999 you form the band Nathan and over the next eight years, you release three albums. What are your strongest memories of that time?\n\nThe Nathan days feel a bit like a fairy tale. We recorded our first album, STRANGER, in a studio used for teaching audio courses, with a friend who gave us a great deal. We’d go in after work a couple times a week and fool around until we had an album. It landed in the hands of Nettwerk Records who called us up and said they wanted to come to Winnipeg and hear our nerdy little band live. That’s probably the strongest and most cherished memory. We couldn’t believe it, and the show was jam packed with our music community rallying around us in a tizzy. Those were exciting times, as signing with a label was the dream back then. We were super fortunate to catch the tail end of the record label heydays.\n\nIs this a time when you first met your future husband, bass player Devin Latimer?\n\nI had met Devin in the Special Fancy days, but he wasn’t a bass player then. He was and still is a chemistry prof, and had cool scientific looking thingamabobs for a music video we were making at the time. As we spent more time together, he started learning the bass so we could jam. By the time Nathan was forming, he was getting pretty good and it seemed the most natural thing in the world that he be a part of the band. My parents would often caution me not to lure him away from his teaching position at the university, which is pretty funny, but it’s so romantic, right?\n\nIn 2012 you released a solo album, CROWSFEET & GREYSKULL, and did you see your career at this point going in a new direction, with Nathan starting to slow down activity?\n\nYes, I think we were all realizing that being a full-time touring musician was not all it was cracked up to be in terms of maintaining good mental health and balance, especially with children. Devin and I were fortunate in that we could tour together and even bring our family with us, but for most musicians, this is not the case, and leaving your loved ones to go on tour is stressful for everyone. Our bandmate Shelley went back to school and got her doctorate in nursing, and is doing incredible things for under-served people in Winnipeg. I was looking for ways to be musical without having to go on the road, and was dabbling a bit with composing for film and television. And since the songwriting bug was still biting, I also thought I’d try my hand at engineering and producing a solo album.\n\nWhen Nathan decided to break up in 2015, you had won a Juno Award in Canada (2008), in addition to other industry recognition. Can you recall the key pressures that resulted in the decision to part ways?\n\nDevin and I didn’t even attend the Juno Award ceremonies where we won the award because I had just given birth to our second child a few days before. That’s pretty telling in terms of how our lives were changing. In the music world it seems like you work hard and hustle while you’re young and ambitious, and if you’re lucky enough to have finally built a sustainable music career, you’re most likely touring constantly by the age you might be ready to start a family, and something has to be sacrificed. I know so many musicians at this crossroads and it’s tough.\n\nYour label at the time was Nettwerk and had they been supportive of your career to that point?\n\nNettwerk was really a great label to be on. They gave us creative control, a feeling of legitimacy, and amplified our music in ways we never would have been able to. When we started having babies, it was also the time that labels were struggling and fizzling out, so not a good time for us to be slowing down the machine. It was a mutual parting of ways and I have only good things to say about the experience.\n\nYou form Leaf Rapids with Devin and release a debut album as a duo in 2015, LUCKY STARS. It includes a cover of Bowie’s iconic song The Man Who Sold The World. As a song that questions the price of fame, I wondered why you included this choice - was it a reflection on your personal experiences within the music business at that stage?\n\nOh, I didn’t know that was what that song was about! And even more embarrassingly I initially thought it was a Nirvana song until Devin set me straight. I just have always loved the brilliant lyrics and composition of it, and it feels more relevant than ever during these cut throat times. I love how it’s surreal but you get a sense of the greed and consequential loss without really knowing what it’s about.\n\nCITIZEN ALIEN followed in 2019 and dealt with topics such as the shame of Canada’s Second World War-era Japanese internment camps and the shocking fallout that saw the confiscation of homes and land from innocent people. Where did the ideas for the songs on the album come from?\n\nMost of the songs on this album stem from the stories passed down from Devin’s and my Canadian settler ancestors. Smallpox quarantines, Japanese Internment, sexual harassment by frisky lumberjacks. It’s incredible the challenges they had to endure to survive in this harsh country. I wanted to try to write from their perspectives and document some of the stories in a way that would highlight their love and resilience.\n\nYour maiden name is McTighe which suggests some family roots in Irish/Scottish heritage. Is this the case as I thought that your roots reach back to Japanese immigrant ancestors?\n\nMy mom is Japanese and my dad is an Irish/Scottish/British/German/French blend. I’ve only been to Ireland once a long time ago, and I kept seeing versions of my dad everywhere, it was freaky, so there must be a very strong Irish contingent. Apparently the McTighe name originated in Galway, and means poet which is kind of neat. Though from the family stories, I come from a line of crooks and cheats.\n\nI believe that your great grandmother was a mail-order bride who travelled to Canada?\n\nYes, she was a picture bride who didn’t meet her husband until she emigrated to Canada. She travelled from Kyoto to Victoria, BC as a young woman and began working in a barbershop with her new husband. She was only about 4 feet tall, but incredibly feisty and didn’t take crap from anyone. She really did stab a lumberjack in the leg after being groped while cutting his hair.\n\nI wanted to ask about your current extra-curricular activities. I believe that Devin is a chemist and still works in this field. You are involved in ongoing creative projects, in addition to raising a family, and can I also presume that the other band members have day jobs?\n\nThat is a very accurate assumption, as it is a tough slog to make a career of music these days. Devin still teaches chemistry for the U of W, Chris takes on sub-contracting work, Joanna is in high demand for her drum skills so she supports herself with her craft, and I sing backup vocals and compose music for film in my home studio, take part in music workshops and mentoring, and last year I was asked to coordinate an after-school free music program for at-risk youth, which was quite the experience!\n\nGetting paid is increasingly difficult in the music industry. Download platforms and streaming services continue to reduce the revenue flow to original artists. Spotify does help you reach audiences that were never accessible in the past, but the poor rate they pay artists is a basic source of frustration. Where do you stand on this whole debate?\n\nYeah. Wow. Hmm. That’s kind of a massive question, haha! I can talk myself into seeing how having access to such a huge audience is an incredible opportunity, but you can’t ignore that a few fat cats are reaping the benefits from the blood, sweat and tears of the dreamers, who are not being fairly rewarded. This used to be shocking and now seems par for the course. We’re all chasing an illusion. It seems to me, and please correct me if I’m wrong, but you have to invest in ads leading to your Spotify profile to keep your numbers up, which ends up costing more than what an artist actually makes on the platform. Hopefully the larger profile translates into touring revenue, but that is also an expensive venture. I also wonder what toll it takes on a person to keep feeding the social media monster’s endless hunger for fresh content. It’s really hard to get over yourself and sell yourself at the same time. We actually took our last album off of Spotify in solidarity with Neil Young a few years ago, after hearing about the large sums of money they pay to conspiracy theorist podcasters like Joe Rogan. Then all the festivals we played at who made playlists of the artists weren’t able to include us, and we realized we were just shooting ourselves in the foot. After all this, I still did a happy dance when I saw that Velvet Paintings was almost at 35,000 streams, which is a record for us. I just did the math and that translates to about 140 Canadian loonies.\n\nYou are now a four-piece with the addition of both Joanna Miller and Chris Dunn. Does this change the band dynamic from a benevolent dictatorship to more of a democracy?\n\nI love the phrase benevolent dictatorship. Honestly, I think we are all a bit older and have given up on any aspirations to ‘make it’ in the music industry. So, it feels like 4 good friends that have found a nice groove and are genuinely happy to be making music together. I do most of the business stuff, so I guess I am the benevolent dictator! If we make business cards, I’m going to use that, thanks.\n\nBut aside from business, I am so in love with my band right now. Joanna Miller is not only a brilliant drummer, singer, songwriter and whistler, but a hilarious and stellar human to boot. The song Night Shift on our new album is the first song she has written, recorded and released. We are massively proud of her, and also gloating a bit selfishly that it is on our record, it’s so good.\n\nChris Dunn is the real deal. When he plays guitar, you get that he has been in touring bands forever, has experienced the extreme ups and downs that go along with that lifestyle, and has landed in the arms of his true love. My husband Devin is our in-the-pocket and ever-so-sturdy base on the bass, and we lean on him hard because we know he can handle it and look handsome at the same time. We all have a really good chemistry together.\n\nMany bands state that they gain more revenue from touring these days but I’m sure that travelling as four musicians is not cheap, with all the overheads of accommodation, flights, meals etc. How do you make it all pay?\n\nWe’ve always considered music as a kind of subsidized travel. Being welcomed into incredibly generous music communities across the world is the kind of payment that means the most to us, though it also means we’re in debt, so I am the wrong person to ask about how to make it pay. I fear that touring musicians may become a thing of the past. We are lucky, because Winnipeg has some of the best arts funding in the country, and a relatively low cost of living, so it’s possible for a musician to own a house and to eek out a living here. Without the album, marketing and tour funding, though? I don’t think we could swing it. Of course, we still dream of breaking even and, dare we say it ... maybe even squirrelling away a few dollars someday.\n\nThe songs on the new album concern themselves with many issues of our times but there appears to be an overriding sense of empathy that threads through the songs, especially Starling To A Starling and Paramjit’s Sonnet. Is this the predominant theme - the need for love as our guiding force, even if it can be hard to find in these divided times?\n\nOh, absolutely. Many people have commented throughout my career on how surprisingly dark my songs are, and yes, I definitely explore that, but hello, the world is dark! For the most part I’ve always tried to highlight the bits of beauty and strength within the bleakness, though, and not just wallow in the mud. I think you’re right though, this last album does tend to follow the threads of love and connection more than ever, and I’m more cognizant of how and what I want to sing for people. I have a song from our last album about a love letter being written from a smallpox quarantine, and then found that I have trouble singing it live, because it’s a total Debbie Downer. Maybe when the world evolves into rainbows and lollipops, I’ll bring that out to remind us of the tough times.\n\nYour vocal has such a warm tone and is a signature sound that highlights the unique sound of Leaf Rapids. Did you take voice lessons as a younger artist and have you changed you approach to singing over the years?\n\nThank you, one thing I love about the internet is that I don’t have to call up clubs pitching for gigs anymore. Cold calling already made me nervous, but my voice also sounded like a 12-year-old, “Hi, I have this band …” It didn’t go well. Like most musicians I don’t listen to my own music, but I did hear a song on the local campus radio the other day, from an earlier album of ours, and I really noticed how differently I sing now. I will say I like my aging pipes better. I didn’t take voice lessons, but apparently, I never shut up and was always singing as a child. I still find myself experimenting with where in my throat certain tones can be found and I think I’m still trying to figure it out, maybe because our bodies are always changing.\n\nYou have been based in Winnipeg for many years now. What is the local community support like for your music?\n\nI was just at the Winnipeg Folk Festival this weekend and was appreciating once again how lucky I am to be a part of this community. It’s a really tight knit and collaborative scene from an artist perspective, and there are many music supporters who you will see at every show, and not just your show, but everyone else’s! It is truly special and I can’t imagine being anywhere else, despite the freezing winters and plethora of mosquitos in the summer.\n\nAre there any plans to bring your music to Europe in the near future?\n\nFunny you should mention that, as the next item on my agenda is applying for a couple of showcases in Ireland and the UK that take place in January, and laying some groundwork for a spring tour in the UK, Germany and Netherlands. It would be so lovely to grow a touring route there and be able to keep coming back.\n\nAny final thoughts that you would like to leave our readers with?\n\nJust a hearty thank you for this interview! I love that your magazine exists when many are falling by the wayside, and I can tell that it comes from a genuine love of music and wanting to connect music to listeners. We appreciate the support, and hope to meet you in January!\n\nInterview by Paul McGee\n\nThe Southern Fold is a Kilkenny-based band with its feet firmly placed in the Gothic Country genre. Fronted by founder member Emlyn Holden, their current lineup alongside Emlyn is Madeleine Leclézio (vocals), Stephen Doohan (guitar), Brian McGrath (bass), Peter Flynn (keys) and Gregor Beresford (drums). Taking inspiration from classic country male/female harmonies, the band has included a female vocalist from day one working in tandem with Holden, the latest being the Mauritius-born Leclézio. Holden’s songwriting recalls the lamenting and lonesome treatment of one of his inspirations, Hank Williams, but with an even darker undercurrent. Their debut full album, BIBLE FEAR, was released in 2020 and firmly established them as the standout band in Ireland in the Americana / Alt-Country classification. The overriding impression it made with us at Lonesome Highway was summed up simply as ‘a quality product that compares more than favourably alongside the darker side of roots music being recorded by well-established acts in The States.’ The band is due to release their next album later this year. On the evidence of the material from the album showcased at their sell-out gig at the Kilkenny Roots Festival in May, it promises to equal, if not surpass, its predecessor. What was initially intended to be a stripped-down acoustic album conceived during Covid has blossomed into a fuller recording, as Holden explained when we spoke recently with him.\n\nWas country your 'go-to' music from a young age?\n\nMy taste has always been very eclectic, but I've loved country music since my early teens. I had a friend who was my dad's age and was a huge Hank Williams fan, and he got me into that. In my early teens, I loved Elvis; Sun Records and Elvis were major influences. From that, I got into punk rock, but I always found a connection between Hank Williams and punk, as well as the rawness and honesty of the songs. The spirit is in both: heart-on-the-sleeve writing, writing what you know and staying honest. I can't understand the formula in some modern music writing and how it can often take four or five people in a room to write one line in a song.\n\nWhen did the idea for The Southern Fold emerge?\n\nIt started about ten years ago as a solo project. I had a four-piece acoustic band a few years before called Oleo Strut Collective. We only had one of two gigs, and we didn't get very far. In late 2013, I started to write some songs, and I wanted to put a name on them, so I came up with The Southern Fold. At the time, I put four or five songs up on ReverbNation, but I wanted to go for something with a male/female harmony, like that Gram and Emmylou kind of thing. I was listening to a lot of Louvin Brothers at the time and felt that I had a few songs that would lend themselves to that sort of sound. In 2014, I got asked to do an open mic night at Cleere's in Kilkenny as part of a Kurt Cobain tribute night. I knew a girl in Kilkenny who was a good singer and asked her if she'd like to join me, and we started working on some of my songs. It all started there, and we've been through a few lineup changes since then; I've been the only constant presence in the band ever since.\n\nLaura Hand was your co-singer for a number of years.\n\nLaura was the third singer I worked with, having gone through others who hadn't worked out. I had reached the point that I thought I wouldn't get anyone who would work out, so as one last effort, I put an ad up on Facebook, and Laura answered. It just went on from there. She is a fantastic singer. We worked together for years.\n\nYour current lineup includes Madeleine Leclézio as backing vocalist?\n\nYes, Madeleine studying at BIMM Music Institute in Dublin. Stephen Doohan, who plays guitar with us and is from the band Blackbird and Crow, is in BIMM with her, and that's how I got in touch with her. I was looking for a replacement for Laura, and Stephen recommended her. I sent her a few songs from my phone, and she came down to Kilkenny; we sang a few songs, and I could tell straight away that she was a fantastic vocalist; she's from Mauritius. English is not even her first language; she speaks French.\n\nI understand that you are working on a new album. How advanced is the recording?\n\nThe songs are written and arranged, and some of them are fully recorded. We released the single, Nothing To Fear, a couple of months ago and have another single, Before The Fall, ready for release. A few more of the songs need a little more work but should be ready to go by August, and the album should be ready to be released in late autumn this year.\n\nHow long have you been working on the songs?\n\nI had started working on some of the songs during COVID-19, having bought some home recording equipment. I had been thinking at that time that I'd make an album, even if it's just me and a cello, and put it up on Bandcamp. I thought everybody had forgotten about the band The Southern Fold at that stage. Still, our bass player, Brian Mc Grath, listened to the songs and liked them. He put me in touch with Gregor (Beresford) about a year ago and asked him if he'd been interested in putting some drums down on some of the songs I had already recorded. He went out to a local studio in Kilkenny for a day with Brian, and they put bass and drums on the songs I had already recorded. From there, I put some cello on the songs, Stephen did his guitar pieces remotely, and Madeleine did some of her vocals here with me and some remotely. It would be lovely if we could all go into a room and work together for a few days and get them all mixed, but unfortunately, it doesn't work like that.\n\nHave the recordings been mastered yet?\n\nA guy named Richard Dowling in Limerick is at the top of his game, and I've been sending the songs to him to master. Leo Pearson mixed the songs for me in his studio in Thomastown, Kilkenny.\n\nIs Gothic Americana a lazy description of your music by us?\n\nI love it when people call it that because I would never have come up with that description. I'm happy to go with that because it appeals to my dark side. It's almost embarrassing for me when I'm on stage with terribly dark lyrics; people must think that I'm manic-depressive. I couldn't put a term on our music, but it's definitely country-influenced, and everything I listen to is wrapped up somewhere in our music.\n\nAre you an avid music listener, and if so, what would your daily music diet consist of?\n\nYes, I listen to music every day. When I was younger, I was literally listening to music every minute of the day. I don't have the time to do that now, but I still listen to stuff from all over the shop daily. I was listening to Creedence Clearwater and The Clash earlier. I love The Replacements and William Elliott Whitmore.\n\nDo you have an overall game plan for The Southern Fold going forward?\n\nMy ambition since I was twelve years old was to do something great in music. At this point, I only want to make a few plans, as I learned along the way that they sometimes work out differently than you would like them to. Right now, it's all about getting the album finished, getting it out, and getting a few people to listen to it. Hopefully, it will resonate with some people out there and get some gigs. I want to get to tour Europe, so whatever opportunity arises, I'll grab it. Opportunities in the music industry don't come along every day, so if the opportunity does come along to tour in Europe, I won't let anything get in the way of that; I'll find another job when I come back (laughs).\n\nInterview by Declan Culliton\n\nYESTERDAY & ME, released independently by Waco, Texas-born artist Kayla Ray, was an ‘Album of the Year’ at Lonesome Highway in 2018. Showcasing Kayla’s crystalline vocals alongside profoundly personal songwriting and with nods to previous musical eras, it was a noble effort to keep traditional country music alive and kicking. She follows a similar template on her recently released record, THE WORLD’S WEIGHT, released on the Real AF Record label. With the growing interest in traditional country music and the backing of a record label, this album should raise her profile significantly and introduce her to a much larger audience. She parked her touring van en route to Ohio to chat with us about her move to Nashville, the new album and other significant events in her life since we last spoke six years ago.\n\nYou are a resident in Nashville now when you're not touring. How does living in Nashville compare to your hometown Waco, Texas?\n\nI moved there in early September. I got an opportunity to release my new record and get a publishing deal, so I moved. It's been very different. I left Waco, Texas, about five years ago and have been travelling and moving around since then. Waco has grown a lot in the last five years, but the Waco I did know and the Nashville I'm getting to know are much different. Nashville is far and away the biggest city that I've lived in, but I like it. There's always music happening and no shortage of art, but traffic and lots of people at the grocery store take getting used to. I'm living on the Upper East Side, close to the American Legion, which is supposed to be the hip side of town; it's where I could afford.\n\nCongratulations on the publishing deal and signing with Real AF Records for your new album.\n\nI'm really thrilled about that. My friend Bryan Martin, whom I've known for a long time and long before he came to Nashville, asked me to work on a movie project, which was really a fun way to write because I got to write from somebody else's perspective, which I'd never thought about trying before. We were working on that, and then there was a writer's strike, and the movie business shut down for a while, and that got shelved. But during that time, Bryan mentioned a few times that he was starting a record label. I was working on an album independently, which was crowdfunded two years ago. So, it's been a long in the works. The record was just done when Bryan started pushing, and since the record was really what I wanted to record, so I told him I'd come on board if he would take it as it was, and he did. I didn't hear from him for about nine hours, which was the longest nine hours of my life, but he took it. It was recorded in Oklahoma City, mixed in Austin and mastered in Nashville; I've never had a project to have been in so many different pockets. Real AF Records is under Average Joe's Entertainment, which is interesting because they pioneer an entirely different type of country music to what I do. But it's cool because they have this attitude of being the underdog and doing things a little differently. So, my publishing deal is just with Average Joe's Entertainment, and my record deal is with Bryan at Real AF Records.\n\nSo you had THE WORLD'S WEIGHT recorded before signing to the label?\n\nYes. As far as the recording went, we had gone into the studio thinking that the album would be independent; that was neat. I got to do exactly what I wanted. My good friend Giovanni Carnuccio produced the album; we had the musicians we wanted and a great room to record in. Because it was crowdfunded, we had complete control and the freedom to do what we wanted. As an independent artist, there is only so much one person can do, so I feel lucky to have the label behind me after the record was finished. Turning over song control has been hard, but they have been good; I can't complain. But of course, any help is a gift. It's hard to be everywhere as an independent artist. It's all part of a learning curve for me and them. The label has a few Americana artists, and that's closer to where I find my home with them than some of the pop/country acts they have.\n\nAre you comfortable under the Americana umbrella? For me, the album is pure country.\n\nI feel very much that it's country music. I don't want to be branded with what many people associate with country music today, but it does often make my music hard to market and find my niche, so I'm okay with Americana if that's what people want. For me, Americana is simply American music.\n\nThe album's production is striking. Can Giovanni Carnuccio take complete credit for it, or did you have an overriding input?\n\nIt's a joint thing, but he worked so hard on the record, so the majority is Giovanni. We spent months and months sending tracks back and forth to see what we both liked so that when we went in to record, we would have a unified idea of what the mix should sound like. Had he not had the patience to hear me out, it could have been totally different. His ear is impeccable, and he worked the files down to the most minute layers and built the arrangements from there.\n\nDo the songs follow a similarly personal template to those on YESTERDAY & ME?\n\nYes, they are personal. That movie I mentioned that I worked on was the only time I wrote outside myself. Everything else to this point has been personal, very much so. Because it took such time to release, I got the pick from a big group of songs that spanned quite a few years, but yes, they all are pretty personal. I did include Diesel No.9, a kind of silly crooner swing song I wanted to do, but outside of that, they are all pretty personal.\n\nShould we be worried about your well-being with titles like To Drink Alone, The Least You Could Do and the title track The World's Weight?\n\nIt's country music, and that's how it's supposed to be (laughs). But no, you don't have to worry.\n\nIs the pendulum swinging back to traditional country music in recent years?\n\nYes, I do feel an overwhelming shift in that direction, and I'm happy to be a small part of that. I don't know the roots of that; we all speculate a lot about that. A lot of it is from emerging from the pandemic and listening to music that is real and relatable again. Maybe it is because younger people are getting to an age when they are interested in their grandparent's kind of music. Whatever the reason, I see it happening, which is exciting.\n\nHave you been performing in Nashville since moving there?\n\nI actually enjoy being on the road, and I don't want to be overly accessible in a market that is already so saturated. I enjoy living in Nashville and going to shows there, but so far, I've had no desire to go down to Broadway and play. I'm not above that, but I've worked hard to reach this point and don't necessarily want to go backwards. Right now, I'm focused on touring, particularly the east side of the country, branching out and playing a lot of rooms out there.\n\nYou're busy touring solo at present. Will you get the opportunity to bring a band on the road with you, or is that a logistical challenge?\n\nI'd love to tour with a band; that's my biggest hangup right now. I've been touring solo for six years now. The new album is such a cool 'band record,' and I'm friends with all the musicians, so it's really tempting to play with them. I may before the end of the tour, but for now, it's just me.\n\nWhen you write, deciding how the material would work in a live setting, is that a factor?\n\nNo, that may be really bad business and might not be right, but I don't put much thought into that when I sit down to write. When the songs come to me, I try to latch on to them as they are. Maybe they won't work solo and I'll hold them for a band show later, or maybe I'll pitch some of them to somebody else or work out some funky sparse versions that I can play solo.\n\nYou are studying for a Master's Degree at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nI am; it's nuts, and it feels like forever. I am getting right down to the end of it and should have it finished next year if I stay on track. I'm taking the clinical courses next semester, and it's about time to start my internship now. I've always told myself that I would not neglect music to study, so I've been chipping away at it for six years now while I've been on the road, and it's been fun; it gives me something to keep my brain occupied.\n\nYou also developed a music therapy course for inmates in Waco, Texas?\n\nI did that for about two years, most predominately with Waco-based inmates. I previously had a music management degree and came up to Nashville to visit my friend Erin Enderlin. She and I went to a symposium at Vanderbilt, where Rodney Crowell was playing for free. We went along primarily to see Rodney play, but the symposium was about music therapy, which changed my life. I loved all the studies that have been conducted on music therapy, and the progress that has been made since then is remarkable. I know what a huge healing music is for me, so I wanted to learn as much about music therapy as I could. So, I went back to school to study, and it led to this six-week curriculum where everyone brings in songs to inmates and discusses the songs with them. What I took for granted was my freedom to listen to music. Those inmates in there only get to listen to whatever music might be on the TV when they're allowed to watch the news. So, it ended up being a really emotional working with the inmates. Still, I stopped doing it when I could not be as accountable as I wanted to be and thought it would be more damaging where you might coax someone into a vulnerable spot and then leave. I did enjoy it, and the integration system at home in Waco still uses my curriculum, so somebody is still doing it.\n\nYour social media fan club, Room 402—The Home of Kayla Ray's Family & Friends, is a great place for people to get to know you and your music and see you perform.\n\nThat's the place I get to be the weirdest. Willie Nelson said, ' If I can't get them all at once, I'll get them one at a time.' That's what Room 402 is, but the beauty of it is that many of the people there are also forming friendships, which is a joy that I didn't think about or anticipate. That group is a great place of solace for me, besides being a lot of fun. The Covid live streams led to the forming of this core group of oddballs that we are all in there.\n\nInterview by Declan Culliton\n\nThe latest album from Kaitlin Butts, ROADRUNNER, was inspired by the romantic Rogers and Hammerstein musical Oklahoma and may seem an unusual choice of inspiration for a country album. But, as Oklahoma-born Kaitlin explained to us when we spoke recently, it reflects her love of musicals from a young age. Also, it touches on themes of love lost and sought, murder and humour, all concepts that have been featured in her songwriting to date. A departure from her previous recordings, channelling country music down an altogether different path with this album works spectacularly well and should further broaden Kaitlin’s appeal and rising star.\n\nAre you settled in Nashville now?\n\nYes, I live in Nashville, Tennessee. I lived here in 2019, moved home during COVID-19 to my mom's house in Ardmore, Oklahoma, a small town, and we moved back to Nashville in 2021.\n\nSinging and acting have been in your blood from a very early age.\n\nI started singing when I was four or five years old and did musical theatre growing up. I started singing music I loved at a young age, which wasn't always country music; I also loved pop music. As I grew older, the artists that were powerful to me and were starting to get a lot of momentum were The Chicks, The Wreckers and Miranda Lambert, women who sang their own songs, played instruments and had great stage presence. I used to sing their tracks onto my little cassette tapes and make CD's. My neighbour was a guitar teacher, and he would come over to my house and teach me songs on the guitar that I wanted to learn. After that, I fell in love with country music, its history and origins, and it just continued from there.\n\nYour new record, ROADRUNNER, follows from your 2022 album WHAT ELSE CAN SHE DO. There are a lot of tracks on it, seventeen in total.\n\nA lot more than the last one WHAT ELSE CAN SHE DO, for sure. I wanted to deliver a project I cared passionately about, not leave gaps, and tackle the concept well.\n\nIt's not quite as dark as WHAT ELSE CAN SHE DO, but it has its dark moments alongside humour.\n\nYes, there are a couple of dark ones on it; it wouldn't be a Kaitlin Butts album if there weren't some dark humour and moments on it.\n\nThat last album was highly personal. Does your writing reflect your mood and state of mind at the time of writing?\n\nAbsolutely. My last album was about what I was going through over the course of four or five years. I thought should I put something on that album that might brighten it up but that was not how I felt during that time. That album was about women struggling and trying to find their way.\n\nThe theme in ROADRUNNER is based on the musical Oklahoma, which is an interesting concept. What motivated that?\n\nWhen we moved back to my mom's house in Ardmore, Oklahoma, in 2020, my husband made the mistake of saying that he had never watched musicals growing up. I was flabbergasted because musicals are such a core principle of who I am. So, we started watching Chicago, which is one of my favourites, and my husband loved it. He's a musician, too, so there was no way that he would not respect the quality of the songwriting, dancing and production. We then watched Oklahoma with its cowboy theme going on, and I realised that I had more than one song that matched the theme and visuals of the movie. I just picked it up from there, started writing more songs inspired by the movie, and ended up with ROADRUNNER. If that last album was very dark, this one is a 'daytime' album, much brighter, like the sun coming out in the song Oh What A Beautiful Morning from the musical's overture.\n\nYou open the album with that overture Oh What A Beautiful Morning renaming it My New Life Starts Today. Is that a statement of where you are at presently.\n\nYes, I'm glad you got that, and I hope that people understand that symbolism. When you're going through some of the things when I wrote my last record, the message is, 'Don't worry, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and good times are on the way.' I'm a perfect example of that.\n\nThe track listing is very clever, mixing the darker songs with more humorous songs and some ballads.\n\nThe listing was very important to me. I wanted to have 'up and down' momentum on the album and humour but also to be very country and dramatic. I wanted it to showcase everything encapsulating me and what you get at my live shows. My last album was very much rock and roll, and that's not everything that I am. If you listen to this album and come and see me live, it's a great representation of what you will see.\n\nThe track You Ain't Gonna Die has shades of Loretta Lynn to it.\n\nYes, I love that song so much. Every time we play it live, it is one that everybody can relate to, someone to whom they want to say goodbye.\n\nVince Gill guests on the ballad Come Rest Your Head (On My Pillow). How did that connection come about?\n\nI performed at The Opry, and he was playing the same night. Whenever you play at The Opry, and there are other celebrities on that night, you might walk by them in the hallway or even get to meet them. Vince Gill was sitting in the church pews during my performance, looking up at the stage stream, humming along, and playing at the back. I didn't know this until I came off stage and into my green room, and my team told me this. After he finished his performance, he walked up to me and introduced himself. I could have fallen on the floor; he's such a legend and iconic person. At the end of our conversation, he just said, 'I'm not that hard to get a hold of. If you ever need anything, just holler.' While working on the Oklahoma theme for this album, I thought of artists from Oklahoma who might sing on it. My manager suggested that we ask Vince Gill to sing on it and 'let's call him.' He didn't even need to hear the song; he immediately came on board\n\nHad you written that song with Vince Gill in mind?\n\nNo, I had not. I wrote that song because this woman at a festival had a tank top that read 'Cowboy Pillows' across her chest. I thought that was so funny, and in movies how, it's normally demonstrated that women are resting their heads on men's chests and being the comforting person, whereas in my experience, it's the other way around. It got me thinking about how women are a comforting place to land, and that's where the song came from. Vince is from Oklahoma, and I'm so happy that he sings on that song.\n\nThe album has a couple of interesting covers, one of which is Bang Bang, previously recorded by Nanci Sinatra and Cher.\n\nThat is one of my favourite songs; I used to walk on to that song in my shows. It's one of those songs I wish I had written; it's so dramatic. In Oklahoma, Jud Fry personally victimises himself; he has been rejected, and he's mad and seeks to murder. I feel like he's saying, 'My baby shot me down; she rejected me.' That's how I envisioned the song Bang Bang's connection to that, and I really wanted to figure out how to work the song into the album.\n\nYou also include a more modern country version of Hunt You Down by Kesha.\n\nYes. I wanted to mirror the Ado Annie and Will Parker's song All Er Nothing from the musical. It's such a funny song, a tongue-in-cheek murderer; it's like everything that I think my audience knows me for. I also wish I had written that song. For me personally, I'm not in a place where I'm in an abusive relationship where I want to kill my husband; I'm in a loving relationship. The song's theme, where if a guy does you wrong, he might get killed, works; I thought I like women to have that kind of empowerment.\n\nYou have co-written with three women for the album: Angaleena Presley, Natalie Hemby and Courtney Patton. Have you co-written previously?\n\nThese were not my first co-writs, but every time I do co-write with someone, it feels like the first time because I get so nervous. Writing with Angaleena was incredible; walking away with the song That'll Never Be Me with her was a dream. I'd been listening to The Pistol Annies since I learned to play guitar. I’ve played her and that band's songs so many times. We clicked right away, and it was so easy to write together. It wasn't as if we were trying to write hit songs; we wanted to write something that was real. I'm particular about who I write with because I like to write independently and take my time; I'd hate to be boxed into four or five-hour windows where I had to write a song. I brought the scene from Oklahoma that I wanted to write with Angeleena and brought it to her.\n\nAnd the Natalie Hemby and Courtney Patton co-writes.\n\nI couldn't believe I got the chance to work with Natalie Hemby. Those two songs, Other Girls and You Ain't Gonna Die (To Be Dead To Me), are core moments on the album for me. They were the last two songs we wrote for the album, and they were the two final missing pieces that I knew I had hooks for but had run out of juice. I was stuck and could not think of another creative line; Angeleena had seen the film and got it right off the bat. Courtney Patton is one of my good friends; we wrote that song, Elsa, in 2016. It's a song that I wanted to draw out and tell her story in every way possible. Courtney sat with me while I cried for hours while I was working on the song. Those are the only co-writes, and I feel as proud of them as I am of the ones I wrote alone.\n\nHow does marriage to a fellow singer and musician, Cleto Cordero, work out logistically?\n\nIt's all that he and I have ever known. He lived in Lubbock, Texas, and I lived in Ardmore, Oklahoma, four or five hours apart. It was always a long-distance relationship, which we are used to. Cleto understands what I have to do, and I understand what he has to do. The kind of responsibilities, the things that don't seem important to people not in the music industry, like a show poster or a setlist. Those things take time and can take away from everyday things, but we both understand their importance. We may not get to talk to one another until after our shows at one or two in the morning, sometimes when we're all buzzing and wanting to talk. It totally works; we leave the house and go our separate ways, but when we get together with a few weeks off, it's all the sweeter getting into a normal routine for a while. We then feel the need to get going and start on the road again.\n\nYour touring diary is complete for 2024, with your final two shows before Christmas in your home state, Oklahoma. How fulfilling is it to play shows there as your career progresses?\n\nI love going back to Oklahoma; it always feels like going home. I played there last New Year's Eve, and it was amazing to walk on stage and hear the roar. Everyone knows my music and my references; they have been there for me since the beginning, people who had seen me playing around town in little bars. It feels like I'm going to my high school reunion and that I'm throwing the party.\n\nInterview by Declan Culliton\n\nCanadian singer-songwriter Lund has been on the Lonesome Highway radar for nearly two decades. We first saw him perform with his band, The Hurtin’ Albertans, at the Kilkenny Roots Festival in 2006. His albums regularly feature in our end-of-year favourites. From a ranching background, Lund is a torch carrier for traditional Western music and has received numerous awards in Canada, America, and Europe. We chatted with him recently before his trip to Ireland later this month to play shows in Dublin and Kilkenny.\n\nYou are finishing some European dates before you come to Ireland for shows.\n\nYes. We’re opening for the Canadian band The Dead South, playing in eight countries. They’re much bigger than us, so it’s a great opportunity to get in front of people. I have my band with me on this part of the European tour, but my Irish shows will be solo acoustic story-telling shows.\n\nDo you recall your first shows at Kilkenny Roots Festival back in 2006?\n\nYes, I do. That was super fun. We had plans to come over again before the plague hit, so I’m glad to be on my way back to Ireland. Ireland and the American West are my two favourite places to visit.\n\nYou come from a traditional cowboy family and environment but chose a music career rather than follow that path.\n\nI’ve had a meandering career path. My family have been cowboy ranchers on my mom and dad’s side for many generations. They first settled in Newton, Nevada, in the 1840s and moved to Western Canada to settle there and raise cattle in the Rocky Mountains around the turn of that century. I grew up on horseback, working with cattle and rodeo. I thought that was normal and what everyone did. I understand now that some people find that exotic and interesting, but to me, it just seemed like daily life. So, when I discovered Black Sabbath and Motorhead, that was exotic to me and opened up a whole new world, it was that kind of music that got me to pick up guitar in the first place.\n\nYour first music venture was in a metal band.\n\nYes. I was in a metal band for most of my twenties, but I figured out shortly after picking up a Les Paul guitar that I could also play all those old cowboy songs that I grew up with, so I was also learning Western music when I was into heavy bands. I had already made a couple of Western records when the rock band retired, and I just jumped into it with both feet. I think that explains my writing style to an extent. The metal scene I was involved with was very fringe, indie, and underground, and the ethos of that scene was to find your own voice, be unique, and find your own style. My songwriting was forged in that kind of furnace, and when I started writing Western and acoustic songs, I brought a certain element of quirkiness and contrariness to my writing. That was a result of being introduced to an independent and fringe music scene to begin with. So, all these years later, here I am writing strange cowboy songs.\n\nWas the metal scene typical of teenage rebellion?\n\nMaybe in retrospect. At the time, I was not particularly unhappy with my surroundings; I just found metal fascinating and interesting, something fresh and new. That’s pretty common with kids; you hear rock and roll, and it’s a whole new world. Rebellious might be a little strong, but it was a way of finding my own path in the world. My family is very traditional, but to their credit, they were supportive even if it freaked them out a little bit. My dad, in addition to being a rancher, was also a doctor, a Western artist with watercolours, and a cowboy intellectual. If he didn’t totally understand what I was doing, he could partially relate to it on an artistic level. It all worked out, and they were thrilled when I started writing cowboy songs.\n\nYou’ve continued on that career path rather than ranching.\n\nMy family still have the cattle ranch. I could barely have a dog; maybe I will someday if I finally retire from music, so I rent out my grass. It’s about five miles north of the Montana border, close to Glacier National Park, a wonderful country.\n\nYour three latest albums have covered a lot of ground. AGRICULTURAL TRAGIC from 2020 was a typical Corb Lund album, SONGS MY FRIENDS WROTE from 2022 was a covers album and EL VIEJO, released earlier this year, was a tribute album to a close friend and mentor.\n\nAlthough I wrote all the songs, EL VIEJO is a tribute album that is dedicated to and named after a friend of mine, Ian Tyson, who had passed away. He was a famous folk and cowboy songwriter in Canada. EL VIEJO is Spanish for the old man, which was Ian Tyson’s nickname. The album was something that I had wanted to do for some time; it’s all acoustic, and there is no single electric instrument on the record. We recorded it sitting in a circle in my living room, there’s no computer trickery or layering, just the four of us playing the songs live in a room.\n\nHow was that experience compared to the traditional studio recording environment?\n\nThe more I do this, the less patience I have for perfect, shiny records. I’ve never been into super overproduced records, and mine are becoming less and less produced as time goes on. This whole thing that we are doing as artists and musicians is communicating, so I really like it when I hear Johnny Cash’s bass player hit a wrong note, Bob Dylan screw up a melody, or Ramblin’ Jack Elliott start a song, stop and restart it, I love all that, it’s human. I don’t care for perfection anymore; I care more about rawness. That’s what we did with EL VIEJO. We did our best to play well, of course, but it was very organic, and that’s what I’m gravitating toward.\n\nFrom being a hero of yours and having a huge influence on your career, Ian Tyson became a close friend of yours.\n\nYes. We did some touring and recording together. He was quite a luminary and presence in my area in Alberta. It was under those terms when I first met him, but as the years went by, it became more of a friendship. The folk music scene in the 60s was huge; it was at Elvis or Beatles level, and his act at the time was Ian and Sylvia. He wrote some of the quintessential folk songs of the songs, Four Strong Winds, Someday Soon and Summer Wages. Neil Young and Johnny Cash have recorded his songs. He was also friends with The Clancy Brothers, who would have been contemporaries at that time.\n\nThe New West label has been very supportive of your music.\n\nThey’re great; I have been with them a long time, six records now, I think. I can’t think of a better label to be on for my lifestyle of unusual roots music. They give me a hundred per cent freehand. I think they can tell that I’m incorrigible. I’m fortunate that I’ve never had anyone in the music business try to direct me.\n\nThough you seldom co-write, I’m interested in the people with whom you share writing credits. Hayes Carll and Jaida Dreyer come to mind.\n\nHayes and I met many years ago at a folk festival in Canada, which I think was in 2005. He’s a really good friend. We wrote one memorable song, Bible On The Dash, and toured together. Not so much lately. I’ve co-written a fair amount of stuff with Jaida Dreyer. She’s a transplanted Canadian; she lives in Nashville now, having grown up in Texas in the equestrian world. We’ve known each other forever and just get in a room and laugh a lot; I’ve written with her more than anyone else. Most of my co-writing, which hasn’t been a lot of it, has been with friends. I haven’t had much success doing official songwriting Nashville style, where you sit down in a room at 10 am with someone you don’t know.\n\nI particularly love your co-write with Jaida, Redneck Rehab, on the new record; it’s hilarious and very clever. I presume it’s not autobiographical?\n\nJaida claims that it is actually autobiographical. That song was her idea, and I helped to flesh it out.\n\nAlongside yourself, artists like Colter Wall, Riddy Armen, Sam Munsick, Andy Hedges, Wylie Gustafson, and Chris Guenther are flying the flag for Western/Cowboy music. Are you aware of all those guys, and do you feel part of a movement to keep that genre alive?\n\nYes, I’m friends with all those guys; it’s a very small group. From what I have read, it was sometime in the 1950s that a radio deejay put country and western together. Before that, there were two distinct styles, country being Appalachian music, which shares some roots with what I do; I like it but don’t personally identify with it as it’s not my background. Western music, on the other hand, is very much in line with my heritage, balladeering cowboy songs. They both have Scots and Irish roots, of course. Not everyone makes that distinction, but there are a few of us still writing music that actually has real agricultural content in it, which is quite rare now. There’s also a guy and friend of mine from Wyoming called Chancey Williams that also writing western music. The biggest example right now is another friend of mine, Cody Johnson, a Texan who writes cowboy stuff and is quite big now.\n\nColter Wall is appealing to a younger audience, which is encouraging. When he played Dublin a few years back, all the younger punters knew his songs word for word.\n\nColter has done something magical and amazing. I grew up with a lot of the songs he sings, old traditional cowboy songs that my grandfather sang. I opened for Colter at The Paradiso in Amsterdam before Covid, and all these Dutch hipsters were singing along to these old cowboy songs. Everything old becomes new again. Colter also has his own vocal style, which helps, and he’s a really good writer, too. He also raises cows in Saskatchewan; he’s a good guy.\n\nIn a parallel career, you played the leading role in the movie Guitar Lessons. Does that art form appeal to you, and is it one that you may pursue going forward?\n\nThat was an interesting experience. I’ve dabbled in acting but hadn’t done a lead role before. The producer and director is a friend of mine, and he strong-armed me into it. I was pretty freaked out, but it turned out well. It’s one of those things that if I had five lifetimes, I would love to pursue acting, but I have so many musical goals and don’t have time for acting unless it was something that would help my musical career, like Ryan Bingham. I’m also a visual artist, but I don’t have the time to put into that either. I’m actually the only person from my friend group who didn’t get music on Yellowstone, even though I have a lot of background in that world. Montana is right in my backyard, about ten miles from our ranch. They mustn’t like me (laughs).\n\nWhat are those music goals in particular?\n\nI’m trying to work on my guitar playing because it sucks. I’d like to make another metal record one of these years, and I’m enjoying the acoustic stuff we did on the new record, and I may pursue that for a while. I’d also like to make another old-style honky tonk record. I have a lot of things on my agenda.\n\nInterview by Declan Culliton\n\nFreddy Trujillo may be best known as the bass player with The Delines and previously with Richmond Fontaine. That aside, his three-decade career includes playing bass in the studio and on tour with some heavy hitters in the rock and grunge scene. He has also recorded four solo albums, the latest being I NEVER THREW A SHADOW. Written and recorded during the pandemic, the album’s subject matter is real-life experiences as a Chicano growing up in California. The title track from this album recalls an incident when Freddy, the subject of an attempted robbery, was subsequently treated as the transgressor based on the colour of his skin. Sonically, the album fuses Freddy’s love of Chicano and country-flavoured rock and roll. Freddy spoke about the album, his previous bands and employers, and his work with Richmond Fontaine and The Delines when we recently hooked up via Zoom\n\nWe know you from your work with Richmond Fontaine and The Delines, but you also have a solo career.\n\nAs a bass player, you always put your eggs in someone else’s basket. I have a good career playing bass with other people, but it’s always up to them when they want to play, so I have also stacked up some solo records. I haven’t always gone out and toured them because I had a family to support, and I also worked for CD Baby, a cool company that allowed me to play bass with bands on tour. In my early career, I played bass with Pat Smear, who is now in Foo Fighters; he was also in Nirvana. I played with Alejandro Escovedo a few times, played in a band called I Love You, and was in a short-lived band called Federale with Mark Ford from The Black Crows and Luther Russell, who produced all my earlier records. In more recent years, I’ve realised that I really need to start taking my own music out there. One that I released, SKETCH OF A MAN, was just before the pandemic, so I lost a lot of steam with that, and the one I had paid a publicist for the album before that, but he was new at that, and nothing really happened with that one. I had another one before, which was called HAWKS AND HIGHWAYS.\n\nAre those albums available to us in Ireland in CD format?\n\nI’ve brought those albums over to Ireland and England on The Delines tours and get to sell them on the merch table. I have a good ally in Garry Kehoe in Rollercoaster Records in Kilkenny, who has carried my records in that record store.\n\nHow did the connection with Willy Vlautin come about?\n\nThat was through Luther Russell, who produced LOST SON for Richmond Fontaine in 1999. Richmond Fontaine drummer Sean Oldham, pedal steel player Paul Brainard, and I backed up a Texan called Ian Moore, so I got to know those two guys. When Dave Harding, who played bass with Richmond Fontaine, moved to Denmark, I came on Willy’s radar for The Delines, and I’m glad he asked.\n\nWhy did you relocate to Portland from California?\n\nIt’s funny; my sister accidentally became a pop star. She was singing for this guy called Elliot Wolff and also used to ghost tracks before autotunes for people who weren’t great singers. She would sing along with them, and Elliot would ghost her vocals and fix the pitch. She sang a song with him that became a hit, and I wrote some songs with her, and I probably made the most money I’ve ever made in the music business. But that all eventually went sour. I didn’t care where I went, but I needed to get out of California. I had some friends in Portland and moved here. I didn’t think I would stay, and now it’s thirty-something years later.\n\nPortland appears to have a healthy music scene. Jeffrey Martin, Anna Tivel, Jenny Don’t and The Spurs are artists living there who we have recently featured in Lonesome Highway interviews or on our radio show.\n\nYes, I know them; I love Anna Tivel. Her music and lyrics are amazing, and Jenny is a good pal. Kelly Halliburton Jenny’s bass players used to play in Dead Moon, played in punk bands and had good connections in Europe. Portland has a good scene, and there are a lot of clubs. From my perspective, I feel that when I first met Willy (Vlautin), it seemed like there was more of a singular type of community, but we were all much younger then. The Delines don’t actually play in Portland, and I don’t know who I fit with or what age group. I am starting to meet some younger Latinos who seem to like my music, so I am trying to build a music community with some younger folks.\n\nHow would you describe your solo music?\n\nI would describe it as rock and roll under a big umbrella. I often term it Mexicana, sort of Los Lobos style. A lot of the younger Mexican artists are very straight ahead and doing Cumbia, a style of music from Peru, or Chicha, which is psychedelic guitar-based, and just doing that. I’ll have a little bit of both, and I can’t stay in one bucket; that’s probably where I shoot myself in the foot sometimes. When Spotify do my algorithms, they have me closest to Americana.\n\nI understand that the pandemic gave you the time and space to write and record your recently released album, I NEVER THREW A SHADOW AT IT.\n\nIt’s always been difficult for me to keep a band, and I have two great guitar players, Ag Donnaloa and Kenny Coleman. Sometimes, guitar players can be like roosters and don’t get along too well. These two guys get along great, and the three of us are music addicts. During the pandemic, I didn’t want to bring people to my house and practice in the basement, so we went to a store and masked up and played. I wanted to keep them engaged, so I started writing some songs and talked to Cory Gray about recording some. We just started piecing it together from there.\n\nThe album title and track recall that disturbing incident where you encountered police racism first-hand.\n\nYes. The title song, particularly with the Black Lives Matter thing going on, reminded me of how traumatising that incident was for me as a young man, and I felt like purging it that way was a more beautiful way than maybe smashing windows downtown.\n\nDo you feel that racism in the police force has in any way reduced since that incident?\n\nIt’s hard to tell as I get older; I was probably more of a target when I was younger, as you always are. I had to train my kid to be like Jedi in Star Wars, avoid the police, and not provoke them. That incident I had was just a month before the Rodney King trial when there was a lot of tension there. I was recently listening to a John Doe interview, and his stories were just as bad being a punk rocker back then as being a person of colour.\n\nYour previous album, AMEXICO, also had political overtones but less pronounced than the new album.\n\nA lot of my songs are not entirely political, but music has always been therapy for me, especially when talking about incidents in song. I got a scholarship and went to college, and I took a lot of Chicano lessons and studies, which empowered me, giving me knowledge that I hadn’t known. I didn’t even know what the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was in 1849, where somehow America acquired Texas, California, Nevada, Mexico, and Utah, that whole territory we call Aztlan, which is the opening track on AMEXICO. In the Chicano movement, that is known as the forgotten land. In America, you see a lot of extremes; the African American movement was really outspoken and simultaneously, we had the Brown Berets and AIM, the American Indian movement. Mexicans tend to be overlooked, keep their heads down and keep working. I’m also a big fan of black civil rights music, Stevie Wonder, Sly and The Family Stone and having soundbites and dialogue in songs; we tried to do that with AMEXICO with spoken dialogue in some of the songs.\n\nGetting back to the new album. The opening track, Corpus Christi, was initially written by Willy Vlautin for The Delines.\n\nWilly always has way more songs than he needs, and it didn’t seem like that one was going to make it onto a Delines album. The reason I liked the phrasing of it was that it reminded me of Doug Sahm. Willy’s demo was a lot slower, and I decided to process it more like a Krautrock mix; that beat is straight up from that band Neu; there’s a big German influence in Texas, and Mexicans play accordion because of that. We recorded it, and I loved it, so it made the cut on the album.\n\nI particularly like the track Remember Me. I get a sense of Carlos Santana in it.\n\nI was trying to capture a Mavericks groove with that one. I love Raul Malo, and I wanted to have some countryish guitar on it, too.\n\nHave you plans to tour the album?\n\nYes. I’m actually leaving today to do a California run. I’m opening for The Delines on the U.K. tour and will get to play some of the album then.\n\nHow do you compare playing in The Delines to your previous stint in Richmond Fontaine?\n\nThere’s a big difference. For one, I feel I’ve been a part of The Delines from the beginning. With Richmond Fontaine, I was a fan for so long before getting to play with them. It was fun because Dave (Harding) played bass a lot differently from me; he’s way more on top of the beat, and I’m more of a traditional bass player playing in the pocket. With one, I’m a ‘fanboy’; with the other, I’m part of the family. The two tours I did with Richmond Fontaine were really memorable. When we were playing in London at The Electric Ballroom to a thousand people, there was a moment there when I just got choked up. We were playing the song The Janitor and to see an audience hang on every lyric as they do in your country and the U.K. – that won’t happen in America, people talk over the music. It’s a really sad song that Willy was singing, and watching everyone just hanging on to every lyric felt like justice for a really good friend of mine. I just got caught up in Willy’s performance and choked up and had to look at my amp for a few seconds.\n\nIs there a new Delines album on the horizon?\n\nYes. We have a whole record pretty much done, but because Willy is juggling two careers and promoting his new book, The Horse, he’s always writing new songs, so we might also do an extended version of the record, maybe a deluxe version. The regular version should come out in early 2025.\n\nInterview by Declan Culliton\n\nKristina Murray is a Nashville-based country singer and songwriter. Over her fifteen-year performing and writing career, she has remained steadfastly loyal to traditional country music, avoiding the temptation of crossing over to the commercial crossover county/pop music currently dominating the radio airwaves. Kristina is also the Administrative Director at The Nashville School Of Traditional Music, a project established to promote and preserve ‘real’ country music. She has recorded two albums, UNRAVELIN’ (2013) and SOUTHERN AMBROSIA (2018), and is putting the final touches on her latest record, which is due for release in early 2025. We recently chatted with Kristina as she enjoyed a family holiday at Edisto Island, South Carolina, before packing her bags for a fourteen-date European tour.\n\nYou are about to reach a tenth anniversary since moving to Nashville.\n\nYes, ten years in mid-June. It feels like ten years in some ways, and in other ways, it seems like that amount of time hasn't passed. So much has happened in that time span. Sometimes I feel like, 'What's next?' but I also feel excited, and Nashville is my home right now. I initially moved to meet other like-minded musicians and songwriters who were writing and playing the type of music I was into. I've definitely met that goal, which has made me a better writer and musician. Making my second record here and now with my third record ready to be mixed has been great.\n\nI have only recently become aware of The Nashville School of Traditional Country Music and your involvement in the project. How did that come about?\n\nI started working for The Nashville School in the fall of 2022, almost two years ago. My connection was through a friend of mine and the school founder, Meredith Watson; I knew her as a musician. She was in a band called Locust Honey. I was leaving my job at Belmont University and doing a lot of bartending work. I met up with Meredith, and we spoke about what the school needed in terms of administration. Meredith oversees the grander vision for the school, and in 2022, she had a non-profit charter for the school. In 2023, she applied for official non-profit organisation status, which we were granted just a few weeks ago. Adult programming is mostly the focus, but we do a lot of kid's programmes with the local schools, some private schools and home school groups in Nashville. It is focused on learning music through the ears and community instead of through formal lessons. So, instead of learning through reading notation or one-on-one, it's more like getting together and trading music, bluegrass jams, writing songs, and playing country music.\n\nIt's promising to hear that those traditions are on offer when what we hear on country music radio stations is mainstream pop music.\n\nPopular country or radio country goes way beyond the bounds of what was traditional country or regional folk music. The idea is to preserve the original sounds that have disappeared from commercial country music, like banjo and fiddle, dobro and pedal steel. They, alongside soulful singing, define what country music is to me. It is exciting because there is a desire out there to keep our music alive. The concept of an organisation attempting to preserve types of music is not new; there are folk schools in Louisville, Kentucky, and Denver has Swallow Hill. Meredith was just surprised that there wasn't an organisation encompassing all that in Nashville and decided to start the school back in 2017.\n\nYour role as Administrative Director sounds very posh.\n\nIt's not posh at all, just a necessity that has to get done (laughs). At the beginning of the school semesters, I mostly oversee the school and kids' programmes. Last year, I taught songwriting classes, and J.P. (Harris) taught clawhammer banjo beginner classes; we also had fiddle classes. My role as Administrative Director involves emailing, overseeing our website, registration, contacting parents about the kids' classes, and thinking forward with Meredith about potentially what type of classes students actually want.\n\nYou mentioned album number three. How is it progressing?\n\nIt's finished. I even have the cover; it's sequenced, mixed, and ready to be mastered. It's ready to go.\n\nYour last album, SOUTHERN AMBROSIA, often addressed downbeat subjects, although the overall sound was upbeat. Does the new record follow a similar template?\n\nThere are a lot of sad songs on it, one happy song and also one love song, which is good. Someone close to me who heard it recently said, “There's no bullshit on it,” which I never want to do, so it's a lot of sad songs and some strange aesthetic mind-warping stuff going on. I hope it doesn't come across as too dark, more so just true.\n\nWho did you work with this time around?\n\nI recorded the album in two chunks, and Rachael More and Misa Arriaga both produced it. A lot of buddies of mine play on the record, I didn't have as much of a hand in the production on my last record, SOUTHERN AMBROSIA, which I was fine with at that time, and we used a lot of session guys on that record. It was fun this time to hand-pick the guys that I wanted, and all of these players are friends of mine whom I really trusted. Guys from my band played, James Paul Mitchell and Sean Thompson played the guitars, Jonathan Beam played bass, Eddy Dunlap played some steel, John Mailander played fiddle on a tune, and a guy named Ilya Portnov was on harmonica on a couple of songs: Jamie Dick, Dominic Billet and Tim Kerr on drums. I've also got a couple of guest vocalists that I'm not naming yet.\n\nAre you fixed on a release date yet?\n\nI would like to find a label home for this record and be able to elevate this record in a way that my last record was not, given that it was independently released. I'm still looking at options, and I had hoped to put it out by the end of the year, but realistically, I'm hoping for early next year and would like to do a single unrelated to the album by the end of the year. I'm telling myself to be patient and that even though the songs may be old to me, they'll still be fresh to everybody else when the album comes out.\n\nWe spoke previously about the additional hurdles women face trying to establish themselves in the music industry despite recording some of the best country and American music in recent years. Do you see any change in that regard?\n\nI would agree with you. Over the past four or five years, most of my favourite country and American albums have been by women; some are on labels and elevated, and some are not. But having been in Nashville for ten years and playing music for fifteen years on stage, I'd like to say it's changing, but it is still such a boy’s club, and whereas there might be room for women in the industry, there is certainly not enough room for all of us. It's just something that has been in the industry for sixty or seventy years. If you look at the Instagram account BOOK MORE WOMEN, where they show the lineup at popular music festivals, and, on the next slide, remove the small percentage of all the bands that aren't women-fronted or have a woman in the band. They have shown this over a number of years, and it doesn't seem to be changing at all. It just looks so seismic, and I really don't know what the fix is. We have some women in engineering and production, which is why I feel very proud and excited to have had Rachael More work on my record.\n\nAre you aware if Zephaniah OHora has made any more progress in bringing the Skinny Dennis brand to East Nashville and opening another traditional country music venue?\n\nIt has been a while since I have had an update on that, but as far as I know, they have plans for a space that they have on the east side. I hope so, as the American Legion, which is and always will be close to my heart, is insane now on Tuesdays. I hear there are over a thousand people there now on Tuesday nights. You can hardly two-step with people swing dancing on the floor, so the people that go there to two-step can hardly dance there these days. When I moved to Nashville, I really grew up there and was one of the people that got the Tuesday nights started; it wasn't even called honky tonk Tuesday then. But it's more like Broadway there now, so to have Skinny Dennis would be exciting. We'd then have Skinny Dennis, Dees (Cocktail Lounge), The Underdog and The Legion for country music; I'd love that.\n\nYou are about to come to Europe to play fourteen dates in eight different countries, including a slot at The Black Deer Festival in the U.K.\n\nPat Reedy and Todd Day Wait go to Europe yearly, so I'm lucky to be able to go with them. They have great fans over there, and I'm hoping that this tour will establish me in as far as I can go over every year. I was over in Denmark and Sweden in 2018 and was playing a tiny country festival over there, and someone came up to me with my 2013 album with them to be signed; it blew my mind that someone there would have my CD and probably paid fifty dollars to get it shipped from Nashville.\n\nWhat will the format be?\n\nWe'll probably do three 45-minute sets, with me sandwiched in the middle. Obviously, it's a shame we can't bring a band; that's for future years.\n\nInterview by Declan Culliton\n\nWinner of the Ameripolitan Music Award for Best Female Outlaw and christened The Honky Tonk Queen by Rolling Stone magazine, Sarah Gayle Meech has recently released her third album, EASIN’ ON. The Nashville-based artist has been part of the traditional country music fabric in the Music City for over a decade; her twice-weekly four-hour shows at the legendary Robert’s Western World continue to draw huge crowds, both local and tourists. Her new album, directed towards self-examination and forged from modern and traditional country roots, is arguably her most impressive work. ‘Putting the songs out there healed me; I had to put the songs out for myself, get them off my chest, and get on with my life,’ she explained when we recently spoke with Sarah via Zoom.\n\nHi Sarah, how are things in Nashville today?\n\nIt's raining today, and we're experiencing a cicada invasion. Cicadas are enormous insects that typically emerge in summer, but they've arrived early this year. They've taken over outside, and you can hear them everywhere, buzzing around in swarms. They look like little aliens.\n\nWhereabouts are you living in there?\n\nI live in Old Hickory, about thirty minutes north of Nashville, right next to Old Hickory Lake. I bought a house here in 2020. We have a half-acre of land out here, and it's quiet.\n\nYou arrived there over a decade ago by way of Longview, Washington and Los Angeles; why Nashville?\n\nI was playing country music in Los Angeles but was obsessed with Nashville. I wanted to be immersed in it, learn the history and be around the fantastic players and writers. I figured it was time to step up my game and move on.\n\nHow long did it take to get booked for your twice-weekly residency at Robert's Western World?\n\nGetting into Robert's took me about a year and a half. I first started playing next door at Layla's, and some of the guys who played at Robert's, like David Tanner and Chris Scruggs, started playing in my band. They introduced me to Robert's owner, Jesselee Jones. He came and saw me play, and I started filling in for other people and eventually got my own spot there. I've been there for about thirteen years now.\n\nHave you noticed a change in the audiences over the years at your shows there?\n\nI have, yes. When we're playing the late shows at Robert's, 10 pm to 2 am, it's usually very crowded, and there are a lot of young people there in their early to mid-twenties. I started to notice in recent years that they were requesting all these old songs, and that hadn't happened before so much. If all the young people want to hear old country music, it must be coming back.\n\nDo you have a free hand to play what you like, both covers and original songs, at Robert's?\n\nThe only thing I'm expected to play is old country. I've been playing my original stuff since I started there; the owner encourages me to. We've been playing some of the new album, and it's getting a good reaction. I could play my whole albums if I wanted to, but I don't have four hours of self-written stuff. I get requests, and when you're working for cash and tips, and someone wants to hear Merle Haggard, I'll play it.\n\nDoes the residency compromise your tour options?\n\nNo, If I want to go out and tour, I can. There are other artists there who also tour. Joshua Hedley does a bit of touring, and I've got some dates coming up with my new record. I haven't been on the road for a while because I hadn't anything to promote, and I've been going through some changes in my life. Robert's has always been cool. I can go out and tour, and I'll always have a slot when I come back.\n\nHave you missed touring in the past number of years?\n\nI do like being out on the road, but not all the time. I'd love to come to Ireland; I've never been there. I love going to new places, but it can be difficult if you're not getting a huge bunch of people out, as it's very expensive to tour.\n\nThe new album EASIN' ON is your live journey over the past few years. It's an extremely brave and open project.\n\nWell, the whole album is about moving on and healing. It starts with the track Time For A Change, which is about things that needed to happen. With the songs, I’m moving on, rocking on, finding love again, and experiencing the pain of losing love again. At the very end, I just decide that it's time to party again with the closing song, Come and Gone.\n\nWere the songs written at the time you were experiencing divorce, the death of a friend and other trauma or written retrospectively?\n\nBoth, some of them were written spontaneously and at a time when things were happening to me. Others were written retrospectively because some things were too hard to talk about then. I couldn't even bring myself to play some of those songs live at the time; I'd probably start crying; they were too emotional. Putting the songs out there healed me; I had to put the songs out for myself, get them off my chest, and get on with my life. As a writer, I definitely felt that the songs were therapeutic, and I hope that someone else might gain strength from them.\n\nYour debut album, ONE GOOD THING, has similar titles, such as Unlucky In Love and Drink Myself to Sleep. Were they also autobiographical?\n\nMost of my songs are autobiographical; There are always personal experiences flavoured with a little bit of imagination. With that first record, I was so hellbent on making a badass honky tonk, rough and drinking album, and that's what it was.\n\nEASIN' ON is a departure from your previous albums sound-wise. You've gone for a richer and bigger sound with this one.\n\nThe sound is exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted to have a whole orchestra but couldn't afford that. I was listening to a lot of singer-songwriter stuff from the '70s and '80s and a lot of the countrypolitan stuff like Glen Campbell's music when he had string arrangements and Barbara Mandrell's stuff that also had strings and big arrangements back in the day. Eddie Rabbitt's ANY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE, is also a hugely lush track; I've loved that sound since I was a kid. I wanted the record to have a big, lush sound but wasn't necessarily a honky tonk album per se; I was looking for something that involved the production more than my previous records. We recorded it all at my buddy Shawn Byrne's Great Hill Studio and got some great sounds without hiring an orchestra.\n\nBilly Contreras can take the credit for that.\n\nYes. What a phenomenal player; Billy has played on all my three records: ONE GOOD THING, TENNESSEE LOVE SONG and now,EASIN'ON. He is one of the most amazing musicians I've ever heard; he came in and did all the string tracks on the album, one at a time. There were twenty-five fiddle parts; he did it with three different fiddles and one viola; the guy is just a master at what he does. He created all those big string sounds on the record.\n\nEddie Lange and Tommy Hannum also have some classic pedal steel on the record.\n\nTommy is my regular steel player; he's been with me for thirteen years. Both he and Eddie played on different tracks. Some of what Eddie did is layered and sounds huge; he did double and sometimes triple tracks on Time For A Change and Love Me. Shawn (Byrne) played almost every guitar track; he played percussion and did some background vocals and bass on a few tracks; he's a proficient and very talented person. It took about a year and eight months. It didn't happen quickly because we were working on a tight budget, and we had a setback in 2023 as I had back surgery, which took me out for a few months.\n\nYou staged the album launch at one of our favourite bars, the 5 Spot at Five Points.\n\nLet me tell you what happened on the day of the album release show. A tornado happened. There was a tornado watch, and it touched down in a few places outside of Nashville. There was flooding everywhere and road closures on the day of the show. Sirens were going off, and alerts were on TV. Thanks a lot, Mother Nature, but despite the weather circumstances, quite a few people came out and travelled for the show. I had friends from Florida, Indiana, and the West Coast come over, but a lot of folks couldn't make it because of the downpours and road closures.\n\nIn addition to your twice-weekly shows at Robert's and your recording pressures, you've also been performing on music cruises that have become very popular.\n\nYes, we did the Outlaw and Country Music cruises last year, and we're on a new one next year called Boots On The Water with Big and Rich, Gretchen Wilson, Jo Dee Messina, Pam Tillis, Lone Star, and Suzy Bogguss. It's good to break up the winter, which can be the coldest time in Nashville, so it's nice to get on a ship and go somewhere tropical for a while.\n\nInterview by Declan Culliton\n\nWhen it comes to showcasing the wealth of Roots music and the Acoustic Blues traditions, there is no greater proponent than Chris Smither. Over a career that stretches back to the 1960s, when he first heard the Country Blues of Lightnin’ Hopkins and Mississippi John Hurt, Chris Smither has been a huge influence and at the frontier of change in promoting Folk music and highlighting the timeless heritage from its rural origins. Chris took time to speak with Lonesome Highway about his new album and reflect upon his storied career.\n\nCongratulations on the launch of your new album. ALL ABOUT THE BONES was released in early May and represents your 20th album in a career that spans five decades and counting. How do you keep the fire burning brightly after all this time?\n\nWell, it helps to have a team of people who know how to get me going, my wife Carol, and my producer David Goodrich are the most important actors ... but I really do want to keep it happening ... it's what I do.\n\nYou have been on the Signature Sounds label since the release of LEAVE THE LIGHT ON (2006). What is your relationship like with the label and how much artistic freedom do you have in working with them?\n\nWe're friends ... I have every freedom, if I make a record they'll put it out.\n\nOn the new album, you continue to fine-tune your enduring relationship with producer David (Goody) Goodrich. He also contributes on various instruments and can you tell us about your special synergy together?\n\nThere's a mutual trust that has grown for decades now ... there's a mutual stimulus arrangement in which I trust him to understand what I'm trying to do and he trusts me to come up with something he wants to work on.\n\nThe new album has a very authentic feel to the ten songs. The interplay among the musicians is very organic and spontaneous. Did you record live off the floor?\n\nPretty much ... my guitar, vocals and drums are live on all of them, and there are only a few overdubs ... the harmony vocals, sax on the tunes that it appears on, David's guitar part.\n\nThe songs deal with a number of topics including the passing of time, personal relationships, the legacy we leave behind when we die and the world we are shaping for future generations. How long did these songs take in the writing and did you have others that are sitting on the substitutes bench for future use?\n\nThey took a surprisingly long time to get started, at least the lyrics did ... the musical ideas were in place for a long time before I got any words down, but when they started coming it happened pretty quickly ... about 4 months. There's nothing left, though ... everything I wrote is out there now.\n\nDo you see a theme running through the songs selected?\n\nIf there is one it's probably the perspective that old age brings ... of course I've spent my whole life thinking that I was finally getting the answers, only to find that they keep changing.\n\nI wanted to ask about the song In the Bardo. Were you ruminating on the cycle of life, as I believe that the word ‘bardo’ refers to the liminal state between death and rebirth in Buddhist teachings?\n\nI was scribbling words without a real sense of where they were going and I finally stopped and realized that I didn't know where I was, that I was lost, and I jokingly said to myself, \"we'll call this Smither In The Bardo,\" then I took it seriously.\n\nThe inclusion of songs by Eliza Gilkyson and Tom Petty are interesting choices. Both Calm Before the Storm and Time To Move On could be taken as personal goals in keeping a measured path when moving into an uncertain future. Almost a focus to live every day in the moment?\n\nI'll buy that, but I don't think it occurred to me until you said it ... I just like the songs ... David suggested the Petty song, and as soon as I transposed it from G to A I knew it would work.\n\nThe harmony vocals of BettySoo are really engaging on the new songs, adding greatly to the colour of the album. How did you come to work with her?\n\nBettySoo is a performer in her own right, and has played support for me on many occasions...I heard her sing harmony with a few people, including James McMurtry ... she generates an intimate quality in the vocals, almost like she's crawled into my shirt to sing with me, and it has exactly the effect on the listener that I look for ... a sense that I'm confiding something to the listener.\n\nThe addition of Chris Cheek on saxophone is an interesting choice. He brings great character to the songs and adds a very resonant sound in his playing. His jazz background apart, there is a real sense of the blues of Missouri in his playing. He was born in St Louis and did you want him to bring a fresh element to the song arrangements?\n\nChris is a friend of Goody's (David), and the addition was entirely Goody's idea ... he said \" how would you like some truly world class sax on this record?\" and I said ‘bring it on.” One of my better moves as it turned out. I agree with you. Not really my doing, but I'm glad I said yes.\n\nYour rich baritone is sounding as potent as ever and when you hit that special groove I find the music almost meditative. I get a similar reaction with artists such as the deeply missed JJ Cale and I wanted to ask whether you find yourself in that special zone where you are playing purely from the subconscious?\n\nNow you flatter me in a most agreeable way, JJ Cale occupies a special place in my pantheon. I once had a conversation with a shrink who attended one of my shows, and he said that in his opinion I dis-associated while I was in the song, and he wondered how I got back to reality so quickly in between numbers ... I'm not sure I completely understood him, but I know that when I'm playing well it feels like another world ... I leave it reluctantly.\n\nLooking back over your impressive career, what are the key touchstones that stand out for you?\n\nI'd have to think about that for a year or two.\n\nYou have always found good people to work with and tried to focus on the music. Growing up in New Orleans you must have been influenced by the melting-pot of musical styles there. At what point did you decide to focus on Folk Blues as your real inspiration?\n\nI was seventeen when I heard Lightnin' Hopkins and realized that he was playing rock and roll all by himself ... that's how I heard it ... and I wanted to do that. I've learned to work with other musicians, but in the beginning I was embarrassed that I knew so little about how music worked, I was self-taught, and I didn't want to expose my ignorance by being in a band.\n\nI lose count of the many cover songs that are included on your albums, dating back to the debut, I’M A STRANGER TOO in 1970. What is your process for selecting a song to cover?\n\nOften I'll cover a song that I wish I'd written myself ... when that happens it's sometimes because I think there's something else in the song that I can bring out that wasn't emphasised in the original ... a chance to add something.\n\nCan you remember when you first started to mic your feet in order to provide that tapping rhythm to compliment your fingerstyle guitar technique?\n\nI've always tapped my feet ... I can't NOT tap my feet, and if I can't hear them it messes up my playing ... I realized in about 1985 that if it was important for me to hear it, the audience should probably hear it too.\n\nWas it a challenge to keep everything in time when you are picking those intricate guitar progressions while trying to keep the beat?\n\nNot really, it's just what I do.\n\nYou have always been prepared to bring new elements in the recording process, using musicians that can bring variety to the songs. When you play live the dynamic is so different however. Do you have to work hard at reinterpreting the songs for solo performance?\n\nAgain, not really, if you could isolate my part on the recording you'd find that it's very close to what I do live, the genius is that of the other musicians who find a way to complement my part without stepping on it.\n\nHow did the Covid-pandemic impact upon your creative process?\n\nIt stopped me ... I thought initially that it would be a great chance to get a lot done, but I got almost nothing done ... I had to get back out with people, with the world.\n\nIs touring something that still brings you great satisfaction or do the years bring a sense of wanting to slow down the merry-go-round of airports, hotels, venues and continuing the lifestyle of a road warrior?\n\nI still love performing, the travel is more wearing now than it was, but I travel more comfortably now and stay in nicer places ... I still want to do it.\n\nYou have been honoured by your peers with the release of a tribute album, LINK OF CHAIN, back in 2014. As a songwriters tribute, how did you feel about the songs chosen and did you accept their acknowledgement of your talents with pride?\n\nI was amazed ... the songs are like my children ... they grow up and go out into the world, and it's amazing to see them come back home to brag about what they've been up to ... I love it. I'm happy for them, and I approve of the friends they've made.\n\nIn the past, you have had songs included in both film and television productions. Is this an area that can bring greater reward in the future or do you see these opportunities as more like a one-off?\n\nThey're lucky happenings ... I don't see them coming, it's another world out there, I'll welcome them when they come along.\n\nYou are also a published author. Do you continue to explore this medium?\n\nI scribble some ... I don't like to talk about it because it raises expectations.\n\nAre you working on other new projects that you can share with us?\n\nNothing right now, but stranger things have happened.\n\nHopefully we can see you play in Ireland again in the future. I know that you were a regular visitor in the past and you also played a role in introducing a young Peter Mulvey to Irish audiences when he was starting out?\n\nMulvey's still one of my very best friends and we still work together, and you will see me in Ireland in 2025, that's pretty certain.\n\nIs it important to you to empower new generations of young musicians that are looking for a foothold in what is a very difficult industry these days?\n\nI do my best to give them support slots and advice if they ask for it ... it's what was done for me, and I try to keep it going.\n\nInterview by Paul McGee Photography by Joanna Chattman\n\nCalifornian Jesse Daniel's devotion to the country music of his home state continues with his 'about to be released' fourth album, appropriately titled, COUNTIN' THE MILES. Jesse has been on the Lonesome Highway radar since his self-titled debut album in 2018, and his foot has remained firmly on that Bakersfield-sounding pedal on his subsequent recordings. We caught up with Jesse before he headed back on the road, crisscrossing across the country to support the new album.\n\nYou are enjoying a short break before you get back on the road for another six months.\n\nYes, we've just done the whole Western side of the United States. We're now gearing up for the Midwest, the South, the East Coast, and then back out West. We're zigzagging across the country a bunch of times. The West Coast"
