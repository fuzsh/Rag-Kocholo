        "text": "LinkedIn's algorithm secrets to help your content here this week: How the top 1% get their posts seen and engaged by thousands. 👇 Everything I’m sharing in this post has been my experience and what thousands of my students have used to see results. So read closely 🙂 For these will help you! 🌍A-Serve their audience Well: Once the algorithm notices that its audience is interested in your content (i.e., a lot of its users are liking, commenting, reposting, and clicking “see more\"),it pushes your content out more. 🌎B-Don’t appear too salesy, instead, sound valuable: Most algorithms will rather push out valuable educational or entertaining content to their audience than “salesy content”, especially if you are not paying for ads. 🌎C-Don’t attach your emotions so much on how the algorithm treats you: It is not GOD and should not be trusted. Some of you trust the algorithm so much and that’s why your emotions are so hurt when it doesn’t do what you expect it to do. 🌎D-Love the algorithm, so the algorithm will love you back. (Just like my picture below🤭) 🌍E-Use Rich Media that stops the scroll; LinkedIn images with pictures has 2x higher engagement rates. This will help you achieve point 1 above. Anyway, I will practically share more on this during cohort 22 of My Linkedin Training starting soon. Join here if interested 👉https://lnkd.in/d8essgZW Remember, the general function of the LinkedIn algorithm is simple👇 📍To review and assess billions of posts every day and position those that are most relevant to each LinkedIn user at the top of their feeds. 📍It’s not out to break anyone's heart or frustrate anyone. Just like you, it has a daily to-do list that it must achieve. 📍Whether you spent 100 hours creating your post or not, it doesn’t care. So partner with the algorithm to get its job done.🌝 The next time you want to put out something on Linkedin, ask yourself if it fits the tips I shared above. Your benchmark when your content should be, is this content valuable enough to make someone else REPOST it? 📌Anyway, which of my tips resonated well with you. A, B, C, D or E? ♻️Don’t see this alone.REPOST this to help someone else's content struggles. 📸 P.S I Enjoyed my stay at The Largest Hotel in Africa ie SkyLight Hotel, Ethiopia 👇 #newweek #20daylinkedinchallengewithhaoma #growth #algorithm #content #queen #linkedin\n\nONLY FOR THOSE WHO WILL INFLUENCE NATIONS AND ATTRACT KINGS OF INDUSTRIES 👇 If you do not desire this, kindly scroll past this particular post.

And you can never know what's on the other side of an action you do not take. Last month, I took the bold step of taking 200+ LinkedIn users from different countries of the world on a journey of attaining quality consistency, visibility, growth, thought leadership branding, and monetization on LinkedIn. It was our signature 21st Edition, which we were going to use to solve a particular problem faced by most people and businesses on LinkedIn: Linkedin Thought Leadership Branding, Content Creation, Consistency, and monetization. Before this edition, we had 20 prior batches of impact in which the participants had seen massive visibility results and growth. From getting clients to getting jobs, increased post engagements, followers, more skill endorsements, etc. We have set aside this night to celebrate this bundle of impact stories at this Graduation Party. To God be the glory! Most importantly, every engaging participant of this program can now confidently and unashamedly market themselves on LinkedIn! Join us by 7:30 pm WAT today to celebrate and learn how you too can see similar growth results on LinkedIn. YOU ALSO CAN SEE RESULTS! #20daylinkedinchallengewithhaoma\n\nYour mood when graduating 200+ people from over 17 countries who went through your LinkedIn Growth and Visibility program (Cohort 21) 📌Posting this to remind you that in this game of success, you can't win without \"Courageous Consistency\" For this particular program, it has been 21 Cohorts of CONSISTENTLY touching lives around the world, regardless of how I felt or the days I felt like stopping. 📌JUNE 24th, 2024: We are set on a journey to meet the more visible and attractive version of our brands. 📌JULY 15th, 2024: We are here celebrating the wins, stretches, and experiences we faced along the way and what we have BECOME as a result of this stretch. 📌 20 days ago, I decided to solve a particular problem faced by most people and businesses on LinkedIn: Consistency, Visibility, and Monetization. (This was the 21st time I was solving this problem in this manner ie Cohort 19) 💡20 days later, I'm blown away by the boldness and results I'm seeing in our participants. -Increased post impressions and engagements -Hundreds and even thousands of new followers in less than 20 days -Some became top voices here on LinkedIn. -More inquiries for their services and job interviews! -Better representation and communication of their brands In fact, on Saturday, I got a couple of messages from participants who had secured long-awaited opportunities even before cohort 20 ended. I am happy we finally accomplished the goal of comfortably showing up on LinkedIn to brand and market ourselves as we turned our LinkedIn followers into buyers (recruiters, opportunity givers, referrals, clients, loyal audiences, etc.). 💡But what makes me happiest is knowing that I've helped them gain the confidence to market their brand consistently on LinkedIn now and in the future. Because it can only get better from here. 🎉 Our Graduation is happening tonight. (see my comment to attend.) If the above results are what you want, I would like to invite you specially to be part of those I will be helping next in Cohort 22 of my LinkedIn growth, Visibility, and Monetisation transformational program.

Not being adequately rewarded? Check your positioning. Not being adequately recognised? Check the people who know about the works of your hands. Most people chase rewards and recognitions but forget the consistent positioning and the people who need to be reached if those rewards and recognition are to come to you effortlessly. If you desire better results in this second half of the year, don’t just wish, do what you didn’t do in the first half or you might repeat the results you saw in the first half -Position better (both physically and spiritually) -Market Better -Upskill Better -Network Better To see what you have never seen, do what you have never done. Need help?
