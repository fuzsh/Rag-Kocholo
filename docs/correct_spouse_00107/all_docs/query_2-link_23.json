        "text": "Cabaret Review by Ron Fassler . . . .\n\nWhile living in Los Angeles thirty-five years ago, I came to New York City for a wedding weekend and had the chance to see only one Broadway show. With the two biggest musicals that season being City of Angels and Grand Hotel, I chose City of Angels which, because it was good, I’ve never regretted. And over time, I’ve caught up with Grand Hotel at Encores! in 2018, and a similarly staged reunion concert in 2019 that marked its 30th anniversary. However, having missed out on the glory that was Tommy Tune’s original direction and choreography I’m still looking for a fully staged revival that might scratch that itch. Until then, last night’s Grand Hotel: The 35th Anniversary Original Broadway Cast Reunion Concert at 54 Below made for a hell of a grand substitute.\n\nWalter Willison, an original cast member, has been the conceiver, adapter, and director of both cabaret-style concerts and once again does a bang-up job with a nearly impossible task. While condensing things to their essence, he forgoes the staging of its dances and still manages to convey the show’s soul. Over an hour and forty minutes, almost twice as long as most 54 Below concerts, the audience certainly got their money’s worth in an immersive experience that used every nook and cranny of the long and narrow space. In fact, its biggest number, “Let’s Take a Glass Together,” took place in the audience, leaving its main playing space empty. It made for an exciting evening with “old Berlin” surrounding you wherever you looked.\n\nReturning from its original cast were the “Jimmys,” David Jackson and David White, who were joy personified whenever they were enlisted to perform their songs. When Susan Wood Duncan was in the spotlight, she captivated with her Flaemmchen, a role she did on its national tour. Bob Stillman, who was Erik on the front desk (the young man impatiently awaiting the birth of his child), took on the part of the Baron, hitting some high notes that probably even surprised him. Let’s face it, a good many in this company aren’t kids anymore. It was thrilling to see Timothy Jerome repeat his performance as Preysing, offering his solo “The Crooked Path,” deservedly with full pride and ownership. Another original cast member, Ken Jennings, took on Otto Kringelein with that exquisite combination—the part requires ill health and tremendous gusto (the late Michael Jeter won a Tony for it). And Karen Akers returned as Rafaella, performing her songs as no one else can, what with a cabaret setting the place she calls home.\n\nWillison himself took on the role of the drug-addicted Doctor, who is somewhat a narrator of the play, which lent itself to the extra exposition he expertly delivered. His solo, set against the dance duo of Michael Choi and Vanda Polakova, was a true highlight. As they waltzed all around the tables, Willison lent his sweet voice to the Doctor’s aching ballad. And as Elizaveta Grushinskaya, Jennifer Bassey Davis lent her considerable grace, charm and beauty to the role first played by the late Liliane Montevecchi. Her duet with Bob Stillman of “Love Can’t Happen” was very touching. As the widow of playwright Luther Davis, who co-wrote the book for Grand Hotel, the significance of her casting was not lost on the crowd. There was also the added bonus of the offspring of two original cast members playing roles their mothers first did: Harper Lee Andrews, daughter of Jennifer Lee Andrews and Susie McCollum, daughter of Lynnette Perry. So lovely.\n\nAlex Rybeck did a superb job as almost a one-man band (there was able support, though, from Ray Kilday on bass). Credit as well to Michael Notardonato billed as Associate Director and Choreographer. And a special shout out to Mitchell Bloom for curating a selection of costumes that really added a great deal to the proceedings (see photos).\n\nThe audience was star-studded with Marilyn Maye and Lee Roy Reams, among a host of others that happily included Grand Hotel composer Maury Yeston and its Tony Award-winning director and choreographer, the aforementioned Tommy Tune. At the curtain call, the cast and the audience sang Mr. Tune “Happy Birthday” as he will be turning 85 years young tomorrow.\n\nTwo shows were presented on Monday at 7:00 and 9:30, which will be repeated in those time slots again tonight at 54 Below. If you read this in time, Go!\n\nGrand Hotel: The 35th Anniversary Original Broadway Cast Reunion Concert. Monday, February 26, and Tuesday, February 27 at 54 Below (254 West 54th Street, between Eighth Avenue and Broadway). www.54Below.org\n\nPhotos: Ron Fassler"
