        "text": "Jennifer Bassey and George Bamford have tied the knot!\n\nThe 75-year-old All My Children alum, who was nominated for a 2018 Daytime Emmy Award for her role in Anacostia, wed the 73-year-old actor on April 19 at the City Clerk’s Office in New York City.\n\nFor the intimate ceremony, Bassey wore a white lace dress by Goga by Gordana while Bamford dressed in a custom-made suit.\n\n“We filled out the paperwork and went into a room and we were married,” the soap star tells PEOPLE exclusively.\n\n“After the ceremony, which was very short, I asked the officiant who married us what his name was. He said, ‘Angel.’ George turned to me and said, ‘We just got married by an angel,’ ” she recalls.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

From Aidy and Conner to Amy and Chris: Stars’ Secret Weddings\n\nBassey, who has also appeared on General Hospital, had been married for 30 years to playwright and screenwriter Luther Davis, who died in 2008.\n\nYears later, a friend introduced her to Bamford, who was having a particularly rough time with his own grief at the time: he had lost his wife of 50 years to cancer.\n\nRELATED: All the Celebrity Couples Who’ve Tied the Knot in 2018 — So Far\n\n“I never dreamed when I met George it would turn into this — that we would [develop] feelings for one another. I thought I had 30 great years with someone else, and maybe I won’t meet anybody again, and that’s okay. But it just happened,” Bassey told PEOPLE about falling in love after loss."
