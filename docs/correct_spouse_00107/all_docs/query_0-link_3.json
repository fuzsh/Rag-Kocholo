This Monday & Tuesday, you are going to be one of the special guests at 54 Below's Grand Hotel: The 35th Anniversary Original Broadway Cast Reunion Concert, Honoring Tommy Tune’s 85th Birthday.

What is something you would like people to know about Luther that hasn't been shared before? Luther was the most amazing man and everybody loved him -- what more can I say?\n\n3. Do you have any Behind-The-Curtain stories about Luther's process in writing Grand Hotel? Yes, he first wrote Grand Hotel in the '50s and then decided to rewrite it and get it on in 1989.\n\n4. Did he ask you for any ideas as he was writing, that then made it into the show? No.\n\nLuther Davis and Jennifer Bassey\n\nPhoto Credit: Jennifer Bassey Archive\n\n5. What do you remember about going to see the show with him? I’ve seen the show around the world -- from New York to Berlin and London to Japan! I could go on and on, and every time I see it, I hope the ending is going to be different. Grand Hotel is a timeless haunting show.\n\nFor these next few questions, I am going to play off of some of the song titles fromGrand Hotel\n\n6. \"We'll Take A Glass Together\" - When you & Luther raised a glass together, what was your favorite drink to have? I don’t drink.\n\n7. \"Villa on a Hill\" - If you could have a villa on a hill anywhere in the world, where would you want to live? Corsica, France.\n\n8. \"Maybe My Baby Loves Me\" - What is something Luther would do to show you just how much he loves you? He wrote that character for me and before I could audition for Tommy [Tune], he had already cast two men to sing the part, so I never got to do it.\n\n10. What current projects do you have going on that you are able to talk about? Currently, I’m co-starring in a dark comedy series with Tamara Braun, Denise Boutte, Jasper Cole, Robert Craighead, and many other talented actors called Kombucha Cure streaming on Tubi. We’re shooting the second season this year, so I've delayed retirement of my Hungarian accent. I have Omni Loop, a thriller premiering at the SXSW Film Festival on March 13 in Austin -- working with Mary Louise Parker was an unbelievable joy.\n\nWhile not on-set, I’m also working on a Nickelback with the fabulous Marilyn Maye who is turning 96 next month. She’s got the energy of a 20 year-old and is the mentor actors dream of for a project like ours."
