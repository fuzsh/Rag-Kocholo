        "text": "Jennifer Bassey joined the cast of All My Children in 1983. Originally meant to be a five-month stint, Marian Colby so caught on with viewers that Bassey is still a presence in Pine Valley, and was signed to full contract status in 1998.\n\nBorn in Chicago, her first job in entertainment was that of a singing bunny in the very first Playboy Club. After two years, she headed to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, from which she was graduated with honors. Bassey then moved to New York City, where she appeared in several Broadway shows, including The Jockey Club Stakes, Not Now Darling, directed by George Abbott; The Homecoming, a Royal Shakespeare production; California Suite; and In Praise of Love, with Rex Harrison. Her off-Broadway credits include the role of Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew at the Roundabout Theatre; Lady Macbeth in Macbeth, at the Stratford Theatre; and costarring with Ken Kercheval in Love Letters.\n\nBasseyÂ’s film credits include roles in Singles, Bonfire of the Vanities, Waxworks; and Dunston Checks In. She also has experience in prime time television, with roles on LA Law, Falcon Crest, Matlock, Murphy Brown, Silk Stalkings and Coach.\n\nIn 1999, Bassey received her first Emmy nomination for Best Supporting Actress,\n\nand the Soap Opera Award, along with co-star David Canary, for Favorite Couple."
