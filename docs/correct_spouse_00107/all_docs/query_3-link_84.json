        "text": "BODYTRAFFIC\n\nBodyTraffic brought its nine-dancer company to the Joyce Theater from home-base, Los Angeles (March 1-6), with a concise program of four dances that aim to please. The choreography highlights rhythmic articulation, jazzy syncopation, dynamic surprises, and freely utilizes lip-syncing and bits of mime, inspired by the music, arguably without falling into the trap of illustrating it.\n\nThe director, Tina Finkelman Burkett, and many of the dancers are native New Yorkers, many Juilliard grads, so the work has a New York edge, albeit not exactly edginess.\n\nThe opening dance, a world premiere, “The One to Stay With,” by Amadi ‘Baye’ Washington and Sam ‘Asa’ Pratt, who come by their rhythmic acuity from working with Akram Khan and Kyle Abraham, among others, features a smartly edited, Slavic-sounding score, by sound designer Jack Grabow. The music includes, “The Snowstorm: Waltz” by Tchaikowsky, “On the Hills of Manchuria,” played by Russian Brass Band and a Romanian folk dance by Bela Bartok, played by Andrew Rangell.\n\nThe dance begins with a trio of dancers surrounding a glowing, white half-sphere, inna cone of light downstage left, and a solo woman in white, up right, gesturing urgently but frantically in place. As people come and go through the space in different configurations, you ask, Where are they going and why? The pace remains brisk with momentary couplings and groupings; tenseness builds, until finally, the glowing bowl brightens from within, and a pailful of water spills from above, dousing the light and abruptly ending the dance. Imaginatively understated costumes by Oana Botes and lighting by Michael Jarrett add to the atmosphere, but I guess that wasn’t “the one to stay with” after all.\n\nGuzman Rosado ane Tina Finkelman Berkett in “(d)elusive minds”\n\nAfter an extended pause for a set change, the curtain rises on an expansive, stage-wide writer’s den, choreography and set design by Fernando Hernando Magadan, where tortured writer Guzman Rosado vainly attempts to compose a masterpiece. His writing chair is flanked by drifts of discarded paper, like snowbanks. His (d)elusive muse, Tina Finkelman Burkett, taunts him until he dispatches her and apparently receives the flash of inspiration he’s seeking, and the Peter Lemmens’s lighting flashes brightly before disappearing.\n\nAfter intermission comes SNAP, another New York premier, choreographed by Micaela Taylor, set to the cleverly, heavily edited music of James Brown – “This is a Man’s World,” “Super Bad,” et al – edited by Shockey and lit percussively by Burke Wilmore in a way that enhances the beat of the music.\n\nBODYTRAFFIC in SNAP\n\nThe company’s only Black male dancer portrays Brown in his opening solo, mimicking Brown’s signature, manic moves, which infect the rest of them, as well as the relatively youthful Joyce audience. This New York premiere would make a perfectly satisfying closer, and many of the audience members take it as such and head out during the scene change. But wait, there’s more. The closing dance, “Pacopepepluto” by Alejandro Cerrudo, is a triptych of male solos set to retro oldies by Dean Martin: “Memories are made of his,” “In the Chapel in the Moonlight,” and That’s Amore,”\n\nJoan Rodriguezin PACOPEPEPLUTO\n\nThe three men, Cuban Joan Roderiguez, Portuguese Perdo Garcia, and Spaniard Rosado, alternating performances with upstate New Yorker Joseph Davis, all in dance belts, lit skillfully by Matthew Miller, making their skin look more Black than Latin, feels redundant, like a second dessert after the delicious meal is done.\n\nphotos by Tomasz Rossa\n\nGus Solomons jr, © 2022\n\nWHERE IS MY My B-O-D-Y DIARY\n\nKeep reading\n\nNEDERLANDS DANS THEATER\n\nHolland’s premiere contemporary dance company, Nederlands Dans Theater, is a big favorite with the City Center audience, which it proved on the sold-out opening night of its New York season, March 4-7. The company, directed since 2002 by house choreographers Sol León and Paul Lightfoot after the retirement of its genius choreographer Jiri Kilian. The program comprised three ballets by different choreographers, including one by its current directors, Léon and Lightfoot, yet their similarities outweighed their differences.\n\n“The Missing Door” (2013) by Argentine dance-theater maker, Gabriella Carizzo, “Walk the Demon” (2018) by Marco Goecke from Germany, and “Shut Eye” (2016) by Léon and Lightfoot are all dark, both in theme and in illumination. The entire evening, running two-and a half hours, was virtually monochrome; all the dances were dressed in white, beige or black clothing, and were danced against black backgrounds, lighted – by three different light designers – in harsh white light, which concealed as much as it revealed.\n\nAnother similarity among the works was the fact that they were all staged by the choreographers, had settings designed by the choreographers, and two of the three had costumes designed by them. This kind of monolithic control of all elements led in all three cases to obsession without benefit moderating points of view from collaborators. That increasingly popular do-it-all-yourself creation puts the dances in competition, rather than complementarity, on a mixed program.\n\nArtists of Nederlads Dans Theater in THE MISSING DOOR by Gabriela Carrizo\n\nThe most intriguing ballet to watch is the first, “The Missing Door,” which unfolds like a surreal suspense movie-in-the-making with cinematic slow-motion action, a rolling spotlight, a “possessed” wash rag with a mind of its own, mysteriously locked doors and others that open and close of their own volition, a mirror that doesn’t reflect the image before it, and cinematic movie-music by Raphaelle Latini.\n\nA man slouches motionless at a desk in one corner, and a lifeless woman lies prone near him. A servant drags her from the room by her heels, and the man comes to life. Another woman dons high that send her tottering against her partner, unable to remain stable. Fingers eerily creep over the top of an apparently closed door. A portion of one wall tilts in, as if it’s collapsing. The maid captures a man’s arms in his own jacket and won’t let him free; a gust of wind blows a door open and pelts those in the room with debris; two people get shot, and blood oozes through their shirts. Finally, when the surreal slapstick becomes as dense and incomprehensible as you think it can, everything rewinds and starts again from the beginning, like a nightmare that you can’t awaken from.\n\nArtists of Nederlads Dans Theater in THE MISSING DOOR by Gabriela Carrizo\n\nGoecke’s “Walk the Demon” starts with a promising duet by a man and woman centerstage, moving with such agitated dynamics they seem like electronically animated hip-hop dolls. Gradually, others enter from the upstage blackness to form a square, then another two enter, until they are a unison chorus, dancing at seventy-eight rpm instead of thirty-three-and-a-third. Even their comings and goings on and offstage are cartoonish, and all the encounters among the ten dancers maintain, in dark trousers and bare chests or nude tops, defy the limits of human speed. The movement is peppered with vocal ejaculations and grimacing. It’s fascinating until it’s exhausting.\n\nArtists of Nederlads Dans Theater in WALK THE DEMON by Marco Goecke\n\nThe gifted dancers all have incredibly mobile spines, loose joints, and extended limbs. The choreography sometimes puts them into stuck repetitions, like a broken record; and there’s mad gesturing and grimacing. They dance with – but not to – an assortment of selections by composers, including the saccharine-sweet Anthony and the Johnsons, modern classical chamber composer Pavel Haas, and Pehr Henrik Nordgren. The overlapping episodes create a physical noise that eventually becomes punishing to dancers and watchers both. After a frantic female solo, the lights go to black, and the audience, understandably, starts to applaud. But no, there’s more, including a provocative male duet, face to face, by a man with his bare-chested twin/self/demon? which at last, ends the ballet on a note of ambiguity.\n\nArtists of Nederlads Dans Theater in WALK THE DEMON by Marco Goecke\n\nThe fascinating thing about the final ballet, “Shut Eye” (2016) by León and Lightfoot, is the ghostly shadows on the bare walls that surround a door in the center of the rear wall of the trapezoidal room the ballet takes place in. The program note tells us “the piece expresses a world full of fantasy that carries symbolic meanings behind the dynamic use of black and white, the respective light and shadow.”\n\nArtists of Nederlands Dans Theater in SHUT EYE by Sol Léon and Paul Lightfoot\n\nAt the start, there is a moon, projected high on the rear wall on high the right. During an opening duet for a couple in black who enter through the door into the murky space, the moon fades and looming, abstract shadows on the walls replace it. He’s bare-chested and has on black, long pants; she wears a black, knee-length unitard with a little black tutu and a sparkly collar.\n\nArtists of Nederlands Dans Theater in SHUT EYE by Sol Léon and Paul Lightfoot\n\nThe lyricism of the sensuous, silken, and continuous dancing is delicately detailed with dramatic gestures and peppered with odd grimaces. But the enormousness and visual novelty of the morphing, blurred-edged shadows upstage the dancers. And when the moon reappears – this time to our left – and the first couple vanishes through the door, we realize their nightmare is over and we’re sorry we missed so much of the dancing.\n\nArtists of Nederlands Dans Theater in SHUT EYE by Sol Léon and Paul Lightfoot\n\n(Note: according to company policy, the individual dancers are not identified in photos.)\n\nphotos by Rahi Rezvani\n\nGus Solomons jr, ©2020\n\nANNE TERESA DE KEERSMAEKER/ROSAS & JEAN-GUIHEN QUEYRAS: “MITTEN WIR IM LEBEN SIND”\n\nBelgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker returns to the New York concert stage at NYU’s Skirball Center, February 13-15, with “Mitten Wir Im Leben Sind” (In the Midst of Life), a mediation on aging, created by her with dancers Boštjan Antončič, Marie Goudot, Julian Monty, and Michaël Pomero. She is also dancing, with her cast, which is not youthful or boundlessly resilient but, seasoned, thoughtful, and mature. Those qualities give their movement choices a weighted, relaxed, texture with only occasional bursts of high energy speed. The music is Bach’s Six Solo Cello Suites, performed entirely from memory by renowned cellist Jean-Guihen Queyras. The title of the dance is part of a line from a Martin Luther chorale, “In the midst of life, we are in death.”\n\nMITTEN WIR IM LEBEN SIND by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. (center) Jean-Guihen Queyras. photo by Ian Douglas.\n\nDe Keersmaeker’s choreography is constructed from recurring abstract motifs that accrue through, formal arrangement and repetition, into kinetic canvases that despite being abstract generate an emotional richness. She is inspired by and works closely with her music, and among her favorites are, Johann Bach, Steve Reich, Philip Glass – music that has a rhythmic persistence, which the movement can alternately match and ignore.\n\nMITTEN WIR IM LEBEN SIND by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. (top) Julien Monty; (bottom) Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker; (right) Jean-Guihen Queyras. photo by Ian Douglas.\n\nThe work could not seem simpler, set on a bare stage with only a black stool for the cellist, placed in a different location for each section, and the identity of the music projected faintly on the rear wall: BWV 1007-1012. De Keersmaeker also announces each new section by walking downstage and holding up one finger, then two, etc., making the gesture more elaborate each time. Also, between sections, she and the next dancer to appear tape geometric lines on the floor. Line by line, they form a five-pointed star and a chalk circle. The brief interruptions also afford the cellist short breathers to rest his hands between his energetic stints of playing.\n\nMITTEN WIR IM LEBEN SIND by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. Michaël Pomero. photo by Ian Douglas.\n\nIn the first suite, Queyras sits centerstage, facing the back. The dancer, Pomero’s movement is built on easy spiral moves, done with patience, relaxed energy, and the confidence of a grownup. De Keersmaeker joins him for a time, takes off and discards the midriff brown swear she wears over her backless dress, split up the side to reveal her left leg. She does the phrase that we’ll come to know over the course of the dance, since she repeats it like a leitmotif, changing its location, and orientation each time she reappears. After her part is done each time, she runs or skips into the wings, as if to say, “keep going; I’ll be back – maybe,” and her partner continues, alone.\n\nIn each of the solos, there is, somewhere, a long stillness on the floor, and in each duet, there is a pause, where the partners stand still, close to each other, for a long moment, facing upstage on the diagonal, with their left arms stretched to the side but not touching, while the music continues. These moments are places for us to reflect on what we’ve just seen. Usually, they mostly happen while the music continues, drawing our attention to Quayras’s prodigious performance.\n\nMITTEN WIR IM LEBEN SIND by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. (l-r): Julien Monty with cellist Queyras. photo by Ian Douglas.\n\nThe second soloist, Monty’s easy flow, makes one aware of how little stress his motion puts on his joints without in the least sacrificing dynamics. Limbs elongate gently without being forced to the extreme ends of their range. It’s as though the dancer is stating a convincing case without having any need to resort to the physical equivalent of yelling to make points. Queyras plays, this time facing profile.\n\nMITTEN WIR IM LEBEN SIND by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. (l-r): Marie Goudot with cellist Queyras. photo by Ian Douglas\n\nI had to miss the start of the third suite, due to a personal plumbing emergency, but what I did see of Goudot’s solo showed lighter, quicker, elfin quality in contrast to the men. And in her duet with De Keersmaeker, the two hold hands – the first physical contact between dancers.\n\nMITTEN WIR IM LEBEN SIND by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. Boštjan Antončič. photo by Ian Douglas.\n\nThe fourth suite, danced by bearded Antončič is perhaps the longest and most overtly energetic with long suspensions to falls and recoveries, bursts of jumping and turning, spins on his back on the floor, hip-hop style. He seems to be reprising variations of material from all the other solos, dancing himself to what seems like exhaustion – or symbolic “death” – in a heap at stage left, where he lies for a very long moment, which we might assume is an ending. But then, he slowly drags himself back to life and segues into Suite Five, joined by the other two men, shoulder to shoulder, at the opposite side of the stage; they repeat the back and forth walking motif.\n\nMITTEN WIR IM LEBEN SIND by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker.

(l-r:) De Keersmaeker, Antončič, and Queyras. photo by Anne Van Aerschot\n\nIn this fifth suite, De Keersmaeker and Antončič’s duet contains her phrase again, facing upstage, and he joins her in it; the two of them embrace, as he skims her across the floor. The duet contains several lifts and carries, which can be interpreted in many ways – obedience, control, dependence, co-dependence – since there has been so little contact until now.\n\nMITTEN WIR IM LEBEN SIND by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. (l-r): Queyras, De Keersmaeker, and Antončič. photo by Ian Douglas.\n\nFor the final suite, Queyras sits upstage center, lighting designer Luc Schaltin washes the stage in full light. The men are still in their black T-shirts, shorts, and sneakers. De Keersmaeker has changed into a midnight blue version of her dress, but retains her pink sneakers. All five do extended unison passages, moving like a single organism, on and off the floor, and in simple walking patterns – in rows and clumps that traverse the stage, and they end up with them standing close together in a downstage corner, facing the cellist upstage. The sold-out, opening night audience exploded to its feet in an enthusiastic ovation, perhaps in appreciation of the masterful choreography but most definitely in admiration of cellist Queyras’s marathon performance.\n\nGus Solomons jr, ©2020\n\nCOMPANHIA DE DANÇA DEBORAH COLKER\n\n“Dog Without Feathers” is the translation of the Portuguese title of the incredibly dense ballet at the Joyce Theater, February 4-9. Choreographed and directed by Deborah Colker along with a team of collaborators, “Cão Sem Plumas” packs into 75 intermission-less minutes more imagery than you can begin to absorb – video projections, music, movable set pieces, and dancers.\n\nArtists of Companhia De Dança Deborah Colker in CÃO SEM PLUMAS\n\nInspired by an eponymous poem by João Cabral de Melo Neto, Colker and her team have concocted a series of eight scenes that translate images from the poem into scenes that are visually overwhelming, collaging projected films and photos with dancers. Her fourteen dancers are expert, not only in ballet and modern but also in indigenous styles like cabaclinho, cavalo-marinho, maracatu, and others, which embody African roots in their persistent, percussive rhythms and fluid engagement of torso and hips.\n\nArtists of Companhia De Dança Deborah Colker’s CÃO SEM PLUMAS. “Alluvium.”\n\nColker exploits the dancers’ extreme flexibility, bordering on contortionism, even putting three high-kicking, back-bending women on point in the section “Herons.” The movement throughout flows between simian, crouched postures, earthbound stamping, high-flying leg extensions, giant jumps, and floorwork reminiscent of break-dance. In the background plays film, shot and edited by Colker and dramaturg Cláudio Assis, of the Pernambuco region of northeastern Brazil, where the creative team spent a month, filming “in the mud,” the Capibaribe people and the indigenous nature.\n\nArtists of Companhia De Dança Deborah Colker’s CÃO SEM PLUMAS. “Herons.”\n\nIn the opening, “Alluvium,” a male does an acrobatic solo, largely silhouetted in front of the video of a dry, cracked riverbed. He, like all the dancers, wears a genderless body suit painted to look mud-caked by costumer Claudia Kopke. Whenever he strikes his body a cloud of dust billows. Soon others emerge like jungle animals, in crouched postures, and connect their bodies into the recurring image of the “Big Crab,” packed together with outstretched arms and elbows crooked upward in wide squats. The music by Jorge Du Peixe and Berna Ceppas for keyboards, melodica, electric guitar, bass, vocals, and percussion, is more pop/rock than indigenous sounding.\n\nArtists of Companhia De Dança Deborah Colker’s CÃO SEM PLUMAS. “Big Crab.”\n\nProjections of people, climbing through twining branches and traversing barren landscapes turn the background into a dense, living backdrop, that often competes with the live dancing, despite skillful highlighting by Jorginho De Carvalho of live duets and small groups in the space.\n\nIn “Sugar Cane Fields,” art director/set designer Gringo Cardia introduces curtains of floor-to-ceiling streamers that further fragment the projected jungle images, when disturbed by rushing, swirling dancers, turning the stage into abstract, three-dimensional textures so complex they’re virtually incomprehensible; “Dog River” brings the river back to liquid life with onscreen dancers wallowing in mud. A particularly striking and magical image is of a landscape with a gnarled “Mangrove” tree seemingly suspended in midair with branches reaching both earthward and skyward. It feels like a National Geographic special.\n\nArtists of Companhia De Dança Deborah Colker’s CÃO SEM PLUMAS. “Mangrove”\n\nIn the final section, “City,” dancers arrange the rectangular cages at the sides of the stage into a multilevel structure, on which they climb deftly, treacherously, while moving spotlights follow their action, until at last, one dancer sinks into a deep squat atop a portion of the structure, as the others sink into the ground and silently roll away like a human river, as the lights fade to black.\n\nArtists of Companhia De Dança Deborah Colker’s CÃO SEM PLUMAS. “City.”\n\nphotos by Cafi\n\nGus Solomons jr, © 2020\n\nCOMPLEXIONS: LOVE ROCKS\n\nComplexions, now celebrating 26th years of existence has returned for a two-week season at the Joyce Theater, January 21 – February 2, to the delight of its fans and consternation of its detractors. Choreographers Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson have honed their style over the years, and the speed and physical extremity of the work is intentional. And extraordinary. Seeing the opening night evening of two ballets – “Bach 25” (2018) and “Love Rocks” (world premiere) – leave no doubt that the dancers are as technically capable as any in the world and can dance at a pace than seems faster than humanly possible.\n\nRhoden’s team of collaborators remains intact, giving the dances an esthetic consistency; it’s become a brand you know and love – or don’t. Christine Darch dresses the dancers in body-revealing leotards, individually embossed with designs in contrasting textures, kind of alternative skins that allow them maximum, unrestricted movement range for their five-past-six-o’clock high extensions and arms-behind-the-head stretches from both women and men.\n\nIn “Bach 25” (2018), Rhoden’s vocabulary sticks close to classical ballet steps, twisted to his own virtuosic ends – no balancing poses, reflective moments, lingering glances – just a breathless onrush of action for his full company of seventeen. It is nominally divided into three sections – Reverence, Celebration, Moxie – that run continuously and are marked by changes of music between Johann Sebastian and Carl Phillipp Emanuel Bach, orchestrated to accentuate its rhythmic pulses. Darch dresses the cast in an impressively varied array of appliqued briefs and leotards in nude, tan, and beige tones and textures.\n\nComplexions Contemporary Ballet in BACH25 by Dwight Rhoden. photo by Sharon Bradford\n\nMichael Korsch’s lighting is active and animated, achieving enormous variety with light and shadow, using only white light and stage fog. The drama of the lighting matches the virtuosity of the dancing, helping to direct our focus and shape moods. The ballet announces over the course of its forty-minute, stream-of-consciousness flow that this is a choreographer and company not to be trifled with. Rhoden, Darch, and Korsch have honed their collaboration to a glossy sheen.\n\nLOVE ROCKS by Dwight Rhoden. (l-r): Candy Tong, Tatiana Melendez, and Erico Sugimura\n\n“Love Rocks” opens with the dramatic image of the entire company of 17 dancers clumped in a circle, wearing Darch’s Goth-inspired – black leather pants and feathery epaulets on the bare-chested men and women on pointe in leotards and tutu-like miniskirts – lit from above by Korsch’s blistering white light, a sculpture of tightly bonded humanity. As the dance begins, the circle suddenly explodes outward like a nuclear blast. The ballet can be seen either as a series of duets woven together by group passages or a large group dance, interrupted by love duets and trios. Eight Lenny Kravitz songs, arranged in heavy metal, hard rock, and jazz styles, drive the dance like a torpedo.\n\nLOVE ROCKS by Dwight Rhoden. The company\n\nThe movement here is more eccentric in its lines and gestures that signify relationships, most notably by the shapes and sizes of the partners in them. The women are on pointe, and individual partnerships have time to register for more than an eyeblink. A seminal motif has the “corps” dancers parading across in the background in lines, seductively, defiantly, or matter-of-factly to the pulsing rhythms of the music.\n\nLOVE ROCKS by Dwight Rhoden. (l-r): Daniella O’Neil, Jared Brunson, and Brandon Gray\n\nBoth women and men often sprint onstage with enough momentum to skate for a couple of feet in a wide second position. Groupings change constantly almost before they register – all men, all women, three men, five women, five couples – they whip through their steps at internet speed, then rush away to be replaced by another fast formation or sometimes a more extended duet passage that allows us to take in the dancers’ enormous technical skills.\n\nLOVE ROCKS by Dwight Rhoden. (center): Craig Craig Dionne and Larissa Gerszke\n\nTim Stickney and either Simon Plant or Vincenzo Di Primo (they resemble each other) are featured male soloists along with Craig Dionne – a steady partner – Daniela O’Neil, Eriko Sugimura, and wonderfully spidery, double-jointed Jillian Davis, though everyone has their instant to shine.\n\nLOVE ROCKS by Dwight Rhoden. Khayr Muhammad and Jillian Davis\n\nWomen are lifted both by individual partners and several at a time. Stickney gets lofted by his mates and carried overhead, as does – I think – DiPrimo. At one moment Stickney confronts a lineup of the men and fells them like toy soldiers with the sheer force of his energy. Is he perhaps an embodiment of Cupid or Eros? It’s unclear whether the couples are inspired by real of fictional characters, but their duets are calculated to inspire awe.\n\nLOVE ROCKS by Dwight Rhoden. Tim Stickney and the company men\n\nEventually, they reform the opening circle momentarily before the final “love rocks” affirmation. The audience springs to its feet, exhilarated, entranced by the relentless display of first-rate dancing. My theater companion, a former professional athlete, loved the athleticism. But, when I asked my Asian ride-share companion in the car how she, a ballerina, liked it, I expected a more enthusiastic response. She said she thought the dancing was impressive, but she missed more emotionality from the dancers. Well, you can’t please everyone.\n\nLOVE ROCKS by Dwight Rhoden.

The only program I was able to see included one work from repertory by Lar Lubovitch, a company premiere by Aszure Barton, and a world premiere by Donald Byrd. Under Robert Battle’s direction, the company’s dancing has reached a new level of proficiency, clarity, and assurance, elevating its popular appeal to a level that can satisfy even the most purist connoisseur.\n\nAlvin Ailey American Dance Theater’s Clifton Brown lifting Danica Paulos in Lar Lubovitch’s FANDANGO\n\nLubovitch’s “Fandango” sets a sensuous duet to the steady musical crescendo that is Ravel’s “Bolero.” On December 28, it was danced with maturity and passion by Danica Paulos and Clifton Brown, who returned to the Ailey company after a freelancing stint that included his dancing with Lubovitch’s company. Brown and Nicole Corea rehearsal directed the dance, and his performance of it with Paulos brought a sensuous seamlessness to its difficult lifts and complex physical entwining.\n\nAAADT in Aszure Barton’s BUSK\n\nAszure Barton’s “Busk” (2009), having its Ailey premiere this season was originally a full-evening piece. This one-act reduction preserves the original, slightly ominous mood of thirteen street performers, dressed baggy, black tunics with cowl hoods and floppy trousers by Michelle Jank. They confront us with grimaces like bogeymen and threaten with primordial grunts. Set to an assorted musical selection by 19th and 20th century composers – including Frenchman Camille Saint-Saens, Swede August Soderman, Russian Lev Zhurbin, and American eccentric Moondog.\n\nAAADT in Aszure Barton’s BUSK\n\nThe music is percussive and reminiscent of modal, Medieval chants; Nicole Pearce’s strategically shadowy lighting, punctuated by blazing hot spots, maintains an air of mystery and surprise. Especially effective are passages where all the dancers clump together on the floor or on an upstage step platform and shift just their hooded heads to reveal and conceal their faces. And the orgiastic group unison finale sends the audience into a frenzied ovation.\n\nOne world premiere of note this 2019 season is a ballet by Donald Byrd – director of Seattle’s Spectrum Dance Theater. A horrendous racial conflagration that took place in the Jim Crow Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921 – dubbed the Tulsa Race Riot – inspired “Greenwood.” The incident is little known in history for many reasons, but Byrd’s resurrection of it could hardly be timelier in today’s virulent reawakening of racism in Trump’s America.\n\nByrd’s dances always rest on a solid scaffolding informed by his astute study of classical and modern dance history, which firmly girds their structures. “Greenwood” – named for the street where black-owned Tulsa business prospered – is where white resentment of its success led to the event at the heart of the narrative. Although it is not known what actually happened in the elevator of an office building that day, Byrd organizes his ballet around three speculative scenarios that might have transpired between a white, female elevator operator and an African-American young man who stepped inside it. At the December 28 performance, the young woman in blue dress and blond wig (costumes by Doris Black) is Danica Paulos and the young man, Vernard J. Gilmore.\n\nSolid black drapes surround three sides of the stage, leaving the only way in or out a narrow gap at the center of the rear wall, suggesting the claustrophobic space of an elevator cab. A constant mist seeps through the portal, suggesting that the characters who emerge from it and the onstage action that transpires may or may not be factually definitive. Jack Mehler’s stark, white lighting turns the stage space into a Petri dish, muting the light, pastel colors of the Blacks’ clothing and reinforcing militaristic insinuations of the Whites’ shiny business suits, like a black and white documentary.\n\nAAADT in Donald Byrd’s GREENWOOD (kneeling, l-r): Solomon Dumas, Jacquelin Harris; (standing, l-r): Clifton Brown, Akua Noni Parker, Jacqueline Green.\n\nTall, elegantly slim Courtney Celeste Spears, dressed like a domestic worker in a mid-calf-length skirt and hair wrapped in a bandana, portrays a kind of chorus. She never leaves the stage but witnesses everything. Her opening solo establishes her credibility with a mobile torso, spidery stretching arms, and sweeping leg extensions. Four middle-class citizens, James Gilmer, Akua Noni Parker, Renaldo Maurice, and Belen Indhira Pereyra, intercut the elevator episodes with reactions and responses that represent soul of the Black Community. And a group of seven anonymous people, dressed identically in shiny, light gray business suits with hoods concealing their faces stand in for the White Establishment. They parade in martial formations and periodically attack the Community members.\n\nAAADT in Donald Byrd’s GREENWOOD\n\nWhenever dancers enter and leave the space, they walk, robotically forward or backward, like a rewinding film clip, and they sometimes move in forbidding slow motion. In a repeated motif, the Man (Vernard J. Gilmore, in dress shirt and trousers) desperately runs without getting anywhere, like in a nightmare. At the start of each new encounter in the elevator the elevator operator (Paulos in a baby-blue dress and blond wig) in a pool of white light, reinforcing her whiteness, graciously spreads and closes her arms, indicating the doors, and at the end of each encounter, a disembodied scream pierces the atmosphere.\n\nByrd deftly builds emotional tension between episodes with interactions between the Black Community and the White Establishment, escalating suspense; the Blacks flow between dancing as couples, families, relatives, and neighbors, while being outnumbered, mocked, intimidated, and finally brutalized and massacred by the faceless Whites that surround them.\n\nAAADT in Donald Byrd’s GREENWOOD\n\nByrd’s eclectic, vocabulary of physically extreme, emotionally charged movement is more specific than I’ve not seen before in his work, especially in solos and duets.

The only program I was able to see included one work from repertory by Lar Lubovitch, a company premiere by Aszure Barton, and a world premiere by Donald Byrd. Under Robert Battle’s direction, the company’s dancing has reached a new level of proficiency, clarity, and assurance, elevating its popular appeal to a level that can satisfy even the most purist connoisseur.\n\nAlvin Ailey American Dance Theater’s Clifton Brown lifting Danica Paulos in Lar Lubovitch’s FANDANGO\n\nLubovitch’s “Fandango” sets a sensuous duet to the steady musical crescendo that is Ravel’s “Bolero.” On December 28, it was danced with maturity and passion by Danica Paulos and Clifton Brown, who returned to the Ailey company after a freelancing stint that included his dancing with Lubovitch’s company. Brown and Nicole Corea rehearsal directed the dance, and his performance of it with Paulos brought a sensuous seamlessness to its difficult lifts and complex physical entwining.\n\nAAADT in Aszure Barton’s BUSK\n\nAszure Barton’s “Busk” (2009), having its Ailey premiere this season was originally a full-evening piece. This one-act reduction preserves the original, slightly ominous mood of thirteen street performers, dressed baggy, black tunics with cowl hoods and floppy trousers by Michelle Jank. They confront us with grimaces like bogeymen and threaten with primordial grunts. Set to an assorted musical selection by 19th and 20th century composers – including Frenchman Camille Saint-Saens, Swede August Soderman, Russian Lev Zhurbin, and American eccentric Moondog.\n\nAAADT in Aszure Barton’s BUSK\n\nThe music is percussive and reminiscent of modal, Medieval chants; Nicole Pearce’s strategically shadowy lighting, punctuated by blazing hot spots, maintains an air of mystery and surprise. Especially effective are passages where all the dancers clump together on the floor or on an upstage step platform and shift just their hooded heads to reveal and conceal their faces. And the orgiastic group unison finale sends the audience into a frenzied ovation.\n\nOne world premiere of note this 2019 season is a ballet by Donald Byrd – director of Seattle’s Spectrum Dance Theater. A horrendous racial conflagration that took place in the Jim Crow Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921 – dubbed the Tulsa Race Riot – inspired “Greenwood.” The incident is little known in history for many reasons, but Byrd’s resurrection of it could hardly be timelier in today’s virulent reawakening of racism in Trump’s America.\n\nByrd’s dances always rest on a solid scaffolding informed by his astute study of classical and modern dance history, which firmly girds their structures. “Greenwood” – named for the street where black-owned Tulsa business prospered – is where white resentment of its success led to the event at the heart of the narrative. Although it is not known what actually happened in the elevator of an office building that day, Byrd organizes his ballet around three speculative scenarios that might have transpired between a white, female elevator operator and an African-American young man who stepped inside it. At the December 28 performance, the young woman in blue dress and blond wig (costumes by Doris Black) is Danica Paulos and the young man, Vernard J. Gilmore.\n\nSolid black drapes surround three sides of the stage, leaving the only way in or out a narrow gap at the center of the rear wall, suggesting the claustrophobic space of an elevator cab. A constant mist seeps through the portal, suggesting that the characters who emerge from it and the onstage action that transpires may or may not be factually definitive. Jack Mehler’s stark, white lighting turns the stage space into a Petri dish, muting the light, pastel colors of the Blacks’ clothing and reinforcing militaristic insinuations of the Whites’ shiny business suits, like a black and white documentary.\n\nAAADT in Donald Byrd’s GREENWOOD (kneeling, l-r): Solomon Dumas, Jacquelin Harris; (standing, l-r): Clifton Brown, Akua Noni Parker, Jacqueline Green.\n\nTall, elegantly slim Courtney Celeste Spears, dressed like a domestic worker in a mid-calf-length skirt and hair wrapped in a bandana, portrays a kind of chorus. She never leaves the stage but witnesses everything. Her opening solo establishes her credibility with a mobile torso, spidery stretching arms, and sweeping leg extensions. Four middle-class citizens, James Gilmer, Akua Noni Parker, Renaldo Maurice, and Belen Indhira Pereyra, intercut the elevator episodes with reactions and responses that represent soul of the Black Community. And a group of seven anonymous people, dressed identically in shiny, light gray business suits with hoods concealing their faces stand in for the White Establishment. They parade in martial formations and periodically attack the Community members.\n\nAAADT in Donald Byrd’s GREENWOOD\n\nWhenever dancers enter and leave the space, they walk, robotically forward or backward, like a rewinding film clip, and they sometimes move in forbidding slow motion. In a repeated motif, the Man (Vernard J. Gilmore, in dress shirt and trousers) desperately runs without getting anywhere, like in a nightmare. At the start of each new encounter in the elevator the elevator operator (Paulos in a baby-blue dress and blond wig) in a pool of white light, reinforcing her whiteness, graciously spreads and closes her arms, indicating the doors, and at the end of each encounter, a disembodied scream pierces the atmosphere.\n\nByrd deftly builds emotional tension between episodes with interactions between the Black Community and the White Establishment, escalating suspense; the Blacks flow between dancing as couples, families, relatives, and neighbors, while being outnumbered, mocked, intimidated, and finally brutalized and massacred by the faceless Whites that surround them.\n\nAAADT in Donald Byrd’s GREENWOOD\n\nByrd’s eclectic, vocabulary of physically extreme, emotionally charged movement is more specific than I’ve not seen before in his work, especially in solos and duets. The fury escalates into frenzy and climaxes in the skewering of the Man, midair, on the grasping arms of the Whites, and culminates the massacre of the Black Community members. The Witness, triages the remains and doggedly carries the lone woman survivor on her back, through the portal into the enveloping fog of memory.\n\nRobertson Witmer’s expert sound design heightens the dramatic tension with a rumbling, percussive aural palette underneath songs that include titles like “Pulsation Voices,” “Ominous,” “In the Last Light” of songs by Emmanuel Witzhum and Craig Tattersall and Field Recordings of Negro folk and religious songs from the South.\n\nphotos by Paul Kolnik\n\nGus Solomons jr, © 2020\n\nKYLE MARSHALL CHOREOGRAPHY\n\nThe Fisher Space is a recent addition to the BAM venues. It’s a perfect, small capacity, black box theater, adaptable to many configurations. It’s small capacity allows the inclusion of a wider range of performances in the prestigious, annual Next Wave Festival – now under artistic directorship of David Binder – including works by emerging dance and theater makers.\n\nKyle Marshall, a young African-American dance maker, is a current member of the Trisha Brown Dance Company. His movement dynamic shows traces of Brown’s style, in which the physics of impulse determine the shapes, rather than intellectual decisions – the seminal concept that defines postmodern versus modern dance. However, in tradition of modern dance, Marshall’s concerns are not purely abstract; they embody aspects of his personal spiritual and political convictions – a style I call neo-postmodern. His dances unfold at the pace of a rippling brook – unhurried, leisurely, and with passive emotional affect, despite the passion, from which they arise. Only rarely is there a dynamic eruption. Refreshingly, the stillness and lack of forced urgency in Marshall’s work leaves space for contemplation. His dances are declarative, not declamatory.\n\nA.D. by Kyle Marshall. (l-r): Bria Symone Bacon, Marshall, Miriam Gabriel, and Myssi Robinson.\n\nIn “A.D.,” there is text, excerpted from the New International Version of the Holy Bible – passages about being blessed and cursed – which become repeated vocal mantras for Bria Symone Bacon and Miriam Gabriel. The distribution of all the dancers’ voices, speaking fragmented phrases from the balcony and behind the audience at the start of the dance is intriguing and piques our curiosity for what will follow visually. Then, Marshall’s loping prances around the edge of the stage introduce a strong visual presence. He’s tall and powerful, yet his physicality is gentle; his solo climaxes in a spasm of trembling, as if struck by a revelation – accompanied by an explosive noise from Cal Fish’s sound score and a flickering of Amanda K. Ringger’s effective lighting score.\n\nMyssi Robinson joins Marshall for an intimate duet, while the other two women, Bacon and Gabriel, flank them doing symmetrical unison. Oluwadamilare (Dare) Ayorinde – the other male and also with Trisha Brown’s troupe – trios with Bacon and Gabriel. There’s nothing specifically racial or overtly political about the motion, which flows gesturally with leisurely dynamics and grazing physical contact. A duet for Gabriel and Bacon has the latter carrying an imaginary baby and the former, opposite her, sinking to the ground.\n\nA.D. by Kyle Marshall. (l-r): Bria Symone Bacon, Oluwadamilare (Dare) Ayorinde, and Myssi Robinson.\n\nThe costumes by Arielle Davidoff – raglan-sleeved, crimson tunics over brown trousers – suggest biblical weeds. The dancers might represent religious supplicants or archetypal avatars. Despite their gracious motion, their humanity remains masked behind a neutral gaze. Davidoff’s tunics do, however, enhance the visual impact of the final tableau, in which four dancers spread their arms like moths’ wings to form a shield around the body of Gabriel, who lies supine in the shape of a crucifix.\n\nA.D. by Kyle Marshall. (l-r): Miriam Gabriel, Oluwadamilare (Dare) Ayorinde, Myssi Robinson, Marshall, and Bria Symone Bacon.\n\nMarshall calls “A.D.” the “beginning of a conversation surrounding Christianity and its influence on the body.” Coming as the first of the evening’s two dances, “A.D.” feels slightly abrupt, as it doesn’t sufficiently introduce the dancers to us as people, rather than symbolic icons. Its scenario, sound environment, and dramatic trajectory would benefit from more extended development to drive its racial and spiritual message home.\n\nCOLORED by Kyle Marshall. (l-r): Oluwadamilare (Dare) Ayorinde, Myssi Robinson, and Marshall.\n\n“Colored,” on the other hand, a 2017 trio for Marshall, Ayorinde, and Robinson is rich in personal history and relational connection. It features original music – and a chandelier of 26 hanging work lights, centerstage – both by Matt Clegg. The three dancers in white costumes by Davidoff open the dance in the circle of light cast by the set, facing in, holding hands, and immediately establishing a bond. Ayorinde wears a midriff tunic and shorts, Robinson, a strapless bra top and slit-sided skirt, and Marshall, long pants with both legs slit to the top of his thighs. The dance unfolds with surprisingly simple yet effective motifs like the dancers in a line, waving their right forearms back and forth in a steady rhythm, going in and out of phase.\n\nCOLORED by Kyle Marshall. (l-r): Myssi Robinson and Oluwadamilare (Dare) Ayorinde carrying Marshall.\n\nAs they sit on the floor, Robinson initiates a discussion about her hair, which is in an afro. She recruits a proximate audience member to style her hair into twists, while revealing that her mother is white and chatting about her life, while Marshall and Ayorinde struggle for power; they shove and carry each other. Then Marshall goes and interacts with a viewer in the first row (my view of them was obscured) and Ayorinde against the rear wall waves his limbs above him like a newborn or a helpless bug.\n\nCOLORED by Kyle Marshall. (l-r): Myssi Robinson, Marshall, and Oluwadamilare (Dare) Ayorinde.\n\nThe trio resumes with a passage of body percussion – finger snapping, clapping and slapping – mist surrounds them, as they return to the hand-holding circle, this time side-stepping, counter-clockwise. A tugging trio feels like a moment of urgency, and Marshall pins Ayorinde to the ground, as Robinson dances a solo reflection, which continues until the men exit to opposite sides and the overhead light of the chandelier slowly fades on her. Marshal’s fresh choreographic voice is confident in its austerity and emotional restraint. It invites us to watch, consider, and discover what we will along the way.\n\nphotos by Ian Douglas\n\nGus Solomons jr, © 2019\n\nTHE CHASE BROCK EXPERIENCE: THE FOUR SEASONS\n\nChase Brock is a Brooklyn-based dance maker, whose resume ranges from “Spiderman: Turn Off the Dark” on Broadway to “Romeo et Juliette” at the Met Opera to “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” on HBO. Since his predilection is towards commercial theater, his dances have a showbiz flair and a narrative bent. From November 21 – December 8, his troupe, The Chase Brock Experience, is performing a two-week run of a revival of his “The Four Seasons” at Theater Row. Set to the familiar Vivaldi music, the hour-long piece had its 2008 premiere at the now departed Joyce SoHo; back then, it seemed prescient in its scenario of weather gone crazy.\n\nA decade later, the piece has gained an ominous currency, as the dire effects of global warming become increasingly apparent around us. In a prolog, happening as the audience enters, it’s amusing to watch Sarah Bowden, dressed as a stylish TV anchor, sitting at a Lucite desk, updating her notes and repeatedly slathering lotion on her hands then on her face, as if to presage a transition from innocuous beauty moisturizing into sunscreen protection for survival.\n\nThe “set” consists of the whole array of Dane Laffrey’s costumes, hanging on a pipe that spans the back of the stage; it rises and lowers from scene to scene for dancers to access their clothes and change in the upstage darkness. It’s an attractive and practical solution to the multiple costume changes the dancer make, ala Broadway productions.\n\nChase Brock’s THE FOUR SEASONS. (l-r): Yukiko Kashiki, Kendrick D. Carter, Honza Pelichovsky, Jane Abbott, and Chloe Campbell\n\nAfter the opening by the whole company in pastel clothes, a dozen dancers with serious Broadway dancing chops dance graciously to the Vivaldi music. Monologs by robotic weather girl, Roz G (Bowden) bridge the costume changes with David Zellinski’s funny, fast-paced news updates, describing steadily rising temperatures and other weather anomalies. The dancers strip to bikinis and play beach games in December in Tyler Micoleau’s sizzling, sunny lighting.\n\nChase Brock’s THE FOUR SEASONS. (l-r): Honza Pelichovsky, Yukiko Kashiki, J.P. Viernes, Jane Abbott, Tracy Chen, Kassandra Cruz, and David Hochberg\n\nThe summertime frolicking soon leads to heat prostration, as Roz G grows increasingly hysterical among the collapsing dancers. A blizzard of mylar confetti – blown by fans in the wings – fills the stage with shiny flecks of black “snow” that stick to dancers’ sweating bodies like blotches of some weather-borne plague.\n\nChase Brock’s THE FOUR SEASONS. (l-r): Jane Abbott, Kassandra Cruz, Yukiko Kashiki, Sarah Bowden, Honza Pelichovsky, and Kendrick D. Carter\n\nChase Brock’s THE FOUR SEASONS. (foreground, l-r): Yukiko Kashiki and J.P. Viernes\n\nThe cast, dressed in bright red and plaid, 18th century waistcoat and gowns –Chloe Campbell in a long gown appears to be pregnant – dance the Autumn passage ofthe music; people continue to collapse. Then, all change into black – swimwear and Campbell in a black shift dress.\n\nChase Brock’s THE FOUR SEASONS. (l-r):Chloe Campbell and Jane Abbott\n\nMore people succumb to the increasingly perilous environment; Yukiko Kashiki finds a dead bird. At – I guess – a Christmas party, everyone receives a fancy glass goblet. “Seasons” ends in a full company tableau, and they all die happily ever after, so there are no real stakes.\n\nChase Brock’s THE FOUR SEASONS. (l-r): Michael Bishop, Kendrick D. Carter, Yukiko Kashiki, and Jane Abbott\n\nThe terrific cast also includes Jane Abbott, Michael Bishop, Kendrick D. Carter, Kassandra Cruz, Kory Geller, David Hochberg, Honza Pelichovsky, Tracy Shen, Emmy Spaar, and J.P. Viernes. Brock’s choreography keeps moving and the cast dance it with authority, and the concise performance leaves you plenty of time to consider its issues over a sidecar or two at Josephine’s cozy restaurant and bar next door.\n\nThe Chase Brock Experience in Chase Brock’s THE FOUR SEASONS\n\nphotos by Rosalie O’Connor\n\nGus Solomons jr, © 2019"
