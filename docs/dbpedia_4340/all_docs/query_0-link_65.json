For this, I ﬁrst thank Thomas Bisson, whose graduate seminar opened my eyes to the possibilities of medieval Spain, and whose guidance has been invaluable at every step. To Charles Donahue of Harvard Law School I express my warmest appreciation; his generosity in time and attention went far beyond the bounds of necessity. Two grants from the Department of History at Harvard and the Real Colegio Complutense made possible my ﬁrst summer of research in the hedgerows, meadows, and archives of Spain. Subsequent research was ﬁnanced in part by the Program for Cultural Cooperation between Spain’s Ministry of Culture and United States’ Universities, and I could not have completed the project without the support of Dean Bernard Firestone and the Hofstra College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. I am immensely indebted to Simon Barton, as much for his friendly suggestions and criticisms as for his pioneering scholarship; without him, there would have been many more errors of fact and identiﬁcation. In Madrid, Reyna Pastor, Carlos Estepa Díez, and Isabel Alfonso Antón of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientíﬁcas welcomed me with an enthusiasm I will never forget; their expertise, at a critical juncture in my research, was indispensable.

At Harvard University Press, Elizabeth Suttell expertly guided this book through the early stages of publication, while Maria Ascher’s editorial comments were quite brilliant. Without their support and guidance, it would have been much harder to evoke “the stone plain where the saints live”—the summer paradise of Austin Clarke’s scholar. Yet some things on this plain, like the castle on the ridge at Lara, are still hard to make out, and many aspects of medieval Spain remain elusive. My greatest debt lies with all those friends and family members who have transmitted their passion for losing and ﬁnding oneself in a world which, in the end, can only be imagined.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nI Symbiosis 1\n\nThe Chains of Love\n\n2\n\nThe Revels of War\n\n28\n\n3\n\nA Zenith and a Nadir\n\n44\n\n9\n\nII Confrontation 4\n\nThe Road to Rebellion\n\n61\n\n5\n\nRevolt, Rapprochement, and Rumor\n\n80\n\n6\n\nRicos Hombres\n\n98\n\nConclusion\n\n119\n\nAbbreviations\n\n131\n\nNotes\n\n135\n\nThe Tenancies of the Laras\n\n180\n\nPrincipal Figures of the Lara Family\n\n189\n\nGlossary of Spanish Terms\n\n190\n\nIndex\n\n192\n\nMaps\n\n1.

It is at ﬁrst difﬁcult to identify this shape. By turns, it seems to be a tree, a rock, a spire, or an ancient obelisk. High above the wheat ﬁelds and the stone plain, it overlooks the kind of landscape that Antonio Machado once described: A yellow roughness in the land, like the raw weave of country clothes, meadows dusted with new grass where scrawny sheep are browsing . . . Then rocks and still more rocks, stone barrens, craggy spurs— the haunt of lordly eagles— rock rose and bramble, upcountry herbs and briarbush and buckthorn.1 No longer the haunt of the lordly, Lara today is a place of considerable poverty. As late as 1981, only four out of twenty-seven villages in the so-called Tierra Lara had running water. The local economy, based primarily on cereal cultivation and supplemented by pastoral farming,\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nis precarious; the natural disadvantages of rocky land and harsh climate are aggravated by a severe labor shortage. Like many pueblos in Old Castile, Lara has lost many of its inhabitants to the allure of urban opportunity. A ﬂood of emigration over the past century has reduced the population from 5,666 in 1920 to 1,151 in 1980.2 Yet Lara was not always a provincial backwater. Archaeological evidence suggests its importance as an urban center in the ﬁrst several centuries after Christ, before a decline in the late Roman period.3 Its necropolis indicates a sizable population, and the fact that the town moved down from the high ridge it had occupied reﬂects a conﬁdence brought by peace and stability.4 The population would later be concentrated in smaller nuclei, however;5 and in the long phase of dislocation that followed the Arab-Berber invasion of the early eighth century, it was the windblown ridge above the village which became the focal point of Lara. At the end of the tenth century, as the Christian reconquista advanced toward the Duero river, Lara was captured by troops under the command of Gonzalo Fernández, count of the dynamic Leonese frontier region of Castile; and on the tip of the ridge known as “The Molar,” a castle was constructed.6 Little remains of the castle today, except one crumbling, towering gateway; it is this lonely shape that rises high above the village. The ruined castle of Lara, visible from afar, is also conspicuous in the early medieval history of Castile as a whole. During the tenth century, it provided the focus for an alfoz, a small administrative district, with an unusually vibrant history.7 The ﬁrst sovereign count of Castile, Fernán González, son of the count who had conquered Lara, was probably born in the castle in 910, and after his mother relinquished control of the area he governed it until his death in 970.8 The history of this period has been embellished by mythology, and notably by the story of the Seven Infantes of Lara, one of the most colorful legends of medieval Spain. It is this romance of treachery, love, and revenge, spanning the gulf between Lara and Córdoba, which accounts for the village’s modern name, Lara de los Infantes.9 Sadly, the historical basis for the romance appears weak; the history of the alfoz of Lara between the later tenth and later eleventh centuries is still obscure. We can say little more than that after Fernán González’s death, Lara seems to have remained part of the inheritance of the counts of Castile for several generations. It was annexed by the Navarrese in the early eleventh century\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nunder Sancho the Great (1000–1035), and ﬁnally reverted to Castilian rule after Sancho’s division of his dominions among his sons.10 But toward the end of the eleventh century, the picture becomes much clearer: by the early 1080s, lordship over the area had fallen into the hands of one Gonzalo Núñez, the ﬁrst known lord of the noble family that would one day come to be known as the Laras. Th e L a r a s were among the most powerful noble families in Castile and León for about three hundred years: from the late eleventh century, when they rose to the pinnacle of power as royal favorites, to the middle of the fourteenth, when they faced a dramatic confrontation with the crown. The chapters that follow do not aim to provide an exhaustive history of the family. Little attention is paid here to their role as patrons of religious foundations, for example, or to the complex webs of marriage and clientage relationships which they established. For the sake of narrative coherence, I have also avoided pursuing the branch of the Lara family that established itself in Narbonne in the twelfth century. Instead, this study is primarily concerned with the tumultuous interaction between the crown and a great aristocratic family. Its approach is therefore more thematically speciﬁc than Simon Barton’s excellent study, The Aristocracy in Twelfth-Century León and Castile (Cambridge, 1997); and in an effort to trace a change in the dynamics of power, it covers a longer chronological span. Part I, “Symbiosis,” traces a phase lasting from the eleventh century to the thirteenth, a phase characterized by the Laras’ escalating inﬂuence at court, heavy reliance on the administrative tenencias that were distributed by the crown, and surprisingly modest patrimonial power. Part II, “Confrontation,” looks at the way in which the Laras were affected by a fundamental alteration in the dynamics of power in Castile and León during the reigns of Fernando III and Alfonso X. Coincidentally, it is also about three hundred years since the publication of the only previous full-length work on the family, Luís de Salazar y Castro’s Historia genealógica de la Casa de Lara (Madrid, 1696–1697). Salazar’s four volumes are the tour de force of a brilliant genealogist. He had become the ofﬁcial Chronicler of Castile in 1685, and the next year joined the order of Calatrava, whose archives he used exhaustively. Together with his selection of documents relating to the family, published as the Pruebas (1694), and the autograph manuscripts at the Real\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nAcademia de Historia, Salazar’s Casa de Lara remains an extraordinarily useful source—one which, in the following chapters, will be mined for information more often than factually contradicted.11 Yet it reﬂects a deeply conservative mentalité, inclined rather to idolize aristocracy than to analyze its underpinnings. The work lacks perspective on the changing social and political structures of medieval Castile, and any indication of change is overwhelmed by an impression of monolithic grandeur. The evolving foundations of aristocratic power are as obscure in Salazar’s volumes as genealogical relationships are clear, and it is this evolution which is the primary concern of the present study. He nevertheless offers a welcome antidote to the unabashed hostility toward the nobility that is exhibited almost universally by royal chronicles and, in consequence, a large number of twentieth-century historians. The negative historiographic view of the nobility derives in part from uncritical reliance on the intrinsically subjective materials produced under the aegis of the monarchy. The point was made powerfully by Otto Brunner in writing about the medieval Germanic lands: Medieval chronicles were written with an essentially moralizing intention, one informed by the ideal image of the just ruler as presented in the “mirrors of princes.” And among the most prominent means of imputing unethical or unjust motives was the incessantly repeated accusation of “brigandage,” the wickedness of plunderers and “robber knights.” Almost every age of medieval narrative sources contains stereotyped complaints about “thieves and plunderers,” “arson and looting,” which modern historians then faithfully repeat.12 More recently, in the context of late medieval Castile, Miguel Ángel Ladero Quesada has suggested that the image of a rapacious nobility may be traced to a conscious political agenda on the part of the crown. Jealous of its powers, like local urban oligarchies, the emerging royal state drew upon antiseigneurial rhetoric in order to encourage a collective association of monarchy with freedom.13 Royal chronicles, therefore, need to be treated with a good deal of caution; we should not judge the actions of the medieval aristocracy by the standards of protoabsolutism, or as if these actions took place within the context and behavioral expectations of a modern state. Changing patterns of power\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\noffer a more valuable framework for analysis than implicit belief in the moral inadequacy of the nobility. The faith that the rise of monarchy over aristocracy was an inherently positive process has been pervasive, although the tide has begun to turn. But in reality the aristocracy was no more acquisitive than the crown: both pursued the almost inevitable logic of an intensely hierarchical society, seeking to advance their own interests by the accumulation of political, social, and jurisdictional authority. While the crown might act as a force for order and justice, it was not an inherently progressive institution: the representative assembly known as the Cortes, for instance, originated not in any new democratic vision but from a need to reinforce the base of political support for the king. Royal policies such as Alfonso X’s pursuit of the imperial crown in the thirteenth century reﬂect just as much personal ambition as any aristocratic vendetta. In the ﬁnal analysis, one might claim that the medieval nobility never approached the socially destructive power of the early modern monarchy, which would drive sixteenth-century Spain into economic stagnation, ethnic disaster, and catastrophic famine.\n\n1 The Chains of Love\n\nI\n\nn o n e o f t h e m o s t striking images in Spanish literature, a frightened nine-year-old girl tells a knight on his journey into exile that her family cannot give him shelter, for the king has decreed that anyone doing so shall have his property seized and his eyes gouged out. The citizens live in fear of the monarch; the dictates of the royal anger, ira regia, cannot be contravened. So the much-loved knight, Rodrigo Díaz, “El Cid,” victim of malicious rumor, continues his ride to the borders of the kingdom and beyond, to plunder and vanquish the Moorish enemies of Castile, amass fortunes for his loyal retinue, and win back the favor of the king he has offended. Without royal grace, he must remain an exile, deprived of security and status. In this sense, the Poema de Mio Cid is an accurate reﬂection of the dynamics of power in Castile during the High Middle Ages.1 Throughout the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the king was the polestar of Castilian society, and in large part the fortunes of a nobleman depended upon royal favor. El Cid’s king, Alfonso VI (reigned 1065–1109), had inherited a form of kingship in which his authority was heightened by his role as active commander of campaigns against the Moors and as distributor of the wealth born of war. The most recent general study of the medieval Spanish nobility describes the king as “the source of all riches, all promotion, all downfall.”2 Equally, Georges Duby categorized Castile as a “warrior economy,” in which kings were enriched by tribute payments (parias) imposed on the weak, fragmented Muslim kingdoms that had emerged after the collapse of the Spanish caliphate in the ﬁrst third of\n\n10\n\nSy m biosis\n\nthe eleventh century. One of the hallmarks of this economy, according to Duby, was the redistributive function of the crown: “Every gathering around a ruler appears as the high point of a regular system of free exchange, permeating the whole social fabric and making kingship the real regulator of the economy in general.”3 It is quite true that in the ninth and tenth centuries the nobility had expanded in numbers and inﬂuence. Some powerful noble families had been able to establish control over great frontier territories; hence the secession of the counts of Castile.4 But neither in Castile nor in León had royal authority fragmented in the dramatic fashion of the French monarchy. There had been no sudden collapse of public order into a violent new world of untrammeled local exploitation by knights and castellans, as there had been north of the Pyrenees around the year 1000, nor did the nobility confront the monarchy so directly at this stage.5 The kings of Castile and León, whose realms were reunited in 1072, had successfully retained the exclusive right to coin money, to adjudicate over a range of particularly serious crimes, to own mined products, and to build fortresses. They could eject subjects from the kingdom, call magnates to the royal host, or summon them to the court.6 Royal prestige was magniﬁed further by an aura of the divine, associated partly with the anointing of the king by the church.7 This was perhaps especially true for Alfonso VI, conqueror of Toledo—a city with enormous symbolic value for Spanish Christendom.8 Alfonso’s reign, in fact, seems to have marked a reafﬁrmation of royal authority and an effort to loosen the chains between noble families and the territories where they had become dominant.9 The long-term delegation of public powers to private lords was limited in this period, a fact which generations of Spanish historians used as evidence of the distinctive truncation of feudalism in most of the peninsula until the late Middle Ages. This, of course, brings us to infamous conceptual territory. Feudalism was understood, by historians in the older tradition, to be a juridical relationship between members of the social elite; it was characterized by an inextricable conjunction of homage, links of vassalage, and the grant of hereditary ﬁefs in return for military service, involving the devolution of jurisdictional powers by the crown. Since this was a pattern that appeared to dominate the feudal heartland of northwestern Europe and since these characteristics were less prominent in Castile and León, historians maintained\n\nThe Chains of Love\n\n11\n\nthat these regions were not properly feudalized and that, particularly before the twelfth century, the aristocracy was weak compared with its counterparts in other western European countries. The population was seen as consisting of small peasant proprietors, managing to avoid the oppressive fate of other European peasantries because of the unique circumstances of the reconquista.10 Today, conversely, it is almost universally argued that Castile was thoroughly feudal. One historian even claims that power was “born feudalized”; in this view, a feudal monarchy and nobility emerged concurrently in the later tenth and eleventh centuries, so that by the beginning of the twelfth century the free peasantry had virtually disappeared.11 The change in the scholarly consensus rests partly on a much broader deﬁnition of feudalism. This has its origins in the writings of Marc Bloch, who redeﬁned the term as a global phenomenon embracing the whole of society, and in Marxist thought, where the term is used to designate agrarian systems based on extra-economic coercion and limitation of peasants’ legal and personal freedoms. And indeed, by the eleventh century landholding entailed not only the leasing of land—which became increasingly important as the commercial economy of northern Castile developed—but also jurisdictional powers over the local inhabitants. These powers included the right to maintain law and order, organize military service in royal campaigns and the lord’s private forays, impose labor services to be performed on his demesne, and ﬁnally to collect a wide range of taxes. This income, paid sometimes in cash but more frequently in kind, would be collected at the building known as the palacio; for this task, a wealthy lord might employ an administrator called a merino.12 In the new, broader deﬁnition, there is absolutely no doubt that Castile and León were feudal societies by the dawn of the High Middle Ages—a fact which to some historians is almost aggravatingly self-evident. “The concept of Spanish feudalism in this sense,” Peter Linehan has said, “assumes an air of sublime meaninglessness which renders it innocuous to some of the old juridical die-hards, risible or exasperating to others, according to temperament.”13 It is quite true that the feudalism debate often seems to revolve around frustrating terminological argument more than any fundamental disagreement about social realities.14 Both schools argue, for instance, that the territorial and jurisdictional power of the nobility steadily increased over the course of the Middle Ages. Yet the realign-\n\n12\n\nSy m biosis\n\nment of perspective has fostered an important new understanding of this social group. Recent work has suggested that as Castilian and Leonese society was “feudalized,” the nobility—far from being inhibited by a powerful monarchy—attained a position of social dominance much earlier than was once believed. This may have occurred as early as the tenth century, precisely because the nobility’s relationship with the crown was complementary and mutually reinforcing.15 Throughout the Middle Ages, but particularly before the mid-thirteenth century, the royal court was in fact a fountain of aristocratic power. The dynamic of power at this stage was overwhelmingly one of symbiosis: the traditional duties of military aid and political counsel, and the temporary delegation of royal authority, bound magnates tightly to the king, who in turn provided generous rewards in land, money, ofﬁce, and lordship. For a nobleman aspiring to the heights of wealth and power, frequent presence at court was a prerequisite. This implied a peripatetic existence for noble families such as the Laras, since the court traveled tirelessly through the realm, to establish, expand, or exploit royal authority.16 The leading members of the Lara family, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, would have led a life that was necessarily as migratory as that of the king. At court, the Laras would have mingled with other members of the upper nobility, as well as with the royal family and the ecclesiastical elite. Their presence at court can be traced in the lists of subscribers—which is to say, those nobles and prelates who were present at the royal court and whose names appear (written by a scribe) at the foot of documents issued by the king. These lists, in which lay lords appear after ecclesiastical lords, represent a form of conﬁrmation and consent, if not necessarily actual witnessing of the issuance of the document, and they provide a good reﬂection of both the composition of the court at a given moment and its internal hierarchy. The role of noblemen at court was in large part advisory, although they might also exercise legislative or judicial functions.17 But their presence was also symbolic, a sign of loyalty; and loyalty paid. As the royal court ﬂourished, moving gradually further from its primitive feudal roots toward greater institutional elaboration, access to the king became more and more lucrative. The rewards of loyalty might occasionally include high ecclesiastical ofﬁce—a bishopric or an abbacy. Beginning, however, with the devotion that Alfonso VI showed to the house of Cluny,\n\nThe Chains of Love\n\n13\n\nand his choice of a Frenchman to ﬁll the reestablished see of Toledo, the crown showed a remarkable predilection for foreigners in making ecclesiastical appointments. Even when a bishopric went to a Castilian, the candidate was likely to be drawn from the ranks of mid-echelon royal servants.18 Far more important for the nobility, therefore, were secular positions such as those of alférez (standard-bearer, as well as commander of the king’s bodyguard and the army in the ﬁeld in the absence of the king himself) and mayordomo (the chief steward, responsible for the management of the king’s household and expenses). Both of these positions, but particularly the former, usually occupied by a young man, would be held repeatedly by upcoming members of the Lara family.19 The role of alférez was a coveted prize in the career of a noble, not least because the late eleventh and twelfth centuries saw a reinvigoration of military activity. Many of the Laras would also carry the title of count (comes), which remained prestigious. Since it was not hereditary, it was an important mark of royal grace; the king appears to have had considerable choice in awarding the honor, and some capacity to withdraw it.20 However, it probably no longer designated any precise function in royal administration, and seems instead to have become purely titular by the twelfth century.21 The greatest fruits of royal favor in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and the pivotal administrative positions in Castile and León, were tenencias. In broad terms, tenancies consisted of the temporary delegation of royal lordship in a speciﬁc town or area: the exercise of jurisdictional, military, or ﬁnancial authority, and receipt of some of the corresponding income. The tenant might supervise the collection of taxes, hear cases on appeal, or raise cavalry and infantry from the town or territory under his command. He was often assisted in his role by an alcaide, commander of the castle, and a merino, an administrator who was appointed from among the local citizens. As in the tenancies of Aragón, his authority in the locality was by no means absolute: over the course of the twelfth century, his jurisdiction was often challenged, and sometimes eclipsed, by the alcaldes (mayors and municipal judges) established by new local fueros.22 (Fueros were documents recording municipal or regional laws, customs, or privileges.) Eventually, by the thirteenth century, the tenancies would fall into decay as their functions were gradually superseded by royal agents such as the merinos and adelantados. At the beginning of our period, however, they continued to\n\n14\n\nSy m biosis\n\nbe the basic unit of royal power. The lord of a tenancy might variously be known as princeps terrae, dominus terrae, dominus villae, tenens castelli, or tenens terrae.23 Problematically, the words tenens and tenente do not become common until the 1130s; earlier, the perplexingly vague terms dominante, imperante, or simply in (in Lara, in Asturias, and so forth) are more common. It is notoriously hard to pinpoint the meaning of these terms or the precise nature of individual tenancies at this stage, perhaps because the nature of the authority itself was sometimes very nebulous. The line between public and private jurisdiction must often have been blurred, especially in the case of long-term tenancies. But the terms in question almost certainly do not refer to genuine patrimonial property, because in most cases the places they concern changed hands rapidly and were not transmitted along family lines. Nor, for the same reasons, do they seem to refer merely to a general preponderance in the area. Instead, it is likely that the terms corresponded to some form of tenancy, and the more speciﬁc designation tenens is often used for the same places in the next generation. Many tenancies crystallized around the districts called alfoces, which had been the basis of administration in Castile since the ninth century.24 A good number (including Lara) formed around castles that may previously have been the focal point of alfoces.25 The alfoces were units of ﬁscal dependency and obligation, as well as instruments for the collection of legal ﬁnes or military taxes like fonsadera. Other tenancies were organized around urban centers, including the key frontier towns of Segovia, Ávila, and Toledo; frontier tenancies of this kind were typically entrusted to a man in his prime, before he graduated to a tenancy in a more secure area of the heartland.26 For the king, this system was an essential means of mobilizing an army, although in contrast with the more clearly deﬁned responsibilities of tenants in the crown of Aragón, few high-ranking tenants assumed a regular military role; most must have valued their position largely for ﬁnancial reasons.27 Did the distribution of tenancies by the crown merely correspond, as some have suggested, to preexisting patterns of noble landholding? The question is pivotal in discussing the dynamics of twelfth-century power. Unfortunately, the sparseness of the sources makes it very difﬁcult to assess the full extent of lands held by a given individual, so any answer must remain tentative, especially in a case study such as this. Without doubt, there were instances where this pattern occurred. The\n\nThe Chains of Love\n\n15\n\npatrimonial power of some nobles—Suero Vermúdez, for example, and the Froilaz clan—was very considerable.28 For the crown, therefore, it must often have made practical sense to adapt to local dynamics, and the power of the monarchy was not such that it could invariably ride roughshod over other interests.29 But it will be argued here that the king did not necessarily have to bow to the inevitable; in the case of the Laras at least, the distribution of tenancies was governed by their inﬂuence at court more than by independent territorial strength. There are, in fact, good reasons for believing that this may have been reasonably typical. In the chapters to come, the evidence will be examined in detail, but a few general remarks may be made right away. First, it is surely signiﬁcant that Castilian and Leonese tenancies were never hereditary and were rarely retained for more than a few years; the rapidity with which they were rotated among different members of the nobility appears to reﬂect the strength of the monarchy and its capacity for political ﬂexibility. Second, many of the Laras’ tenancies appear to have been geographically unrelated to their patrimonial base, suggesting that some other dynamic was at work in the distribution of royal patronage. And third, as far as the evidence allows us to say, the unparalleled success that the family enjoyed in acquiring important tenancies cannot be explained by any very marked patrimonial supremacy over other lineages. In fact, they established patrimonial control over only one substantial estate on the peninsula (Molina) in the whole course of the twelfth century. For now, their accumulation of patrimony was slow, piecemeal, and fragmented, and in this respect at least they resembled most other noble families in Castile and León. The territorial and jurisdictional dominance of the nobility over other inhabitants of the two kingdoms was perfectly visible, but it would not reach its full development for another three centuries. Noble landholding was always unstable before the creation of mayorazgos (entailed estates) in the later Middle Ages. Inheritance patterns were still predominantly cognatic, equal importance being attached to male and female lines, and Visigothic law dictated that all heirs, both male and female, should receive an equal share.30 Sources suggest that although there was a long-term tendency toward favoring sons, egalitarian division of the inheritance among many or all offspring was fundamental in the twelfth century and continued to be so into the thirteenth.31 Partition of property among vari-\n\n16\n\nSy m biosis\n\nous heirs meant that lands that had been proﬁtable in the tenth century were no longer so in a later period.32 Of course, the Laras were substantial landowners. A certain level of landed wealth was, in effect, a sine qua non, necessary in order to enter the elite pool of candidates from which tenants were chosen. But within this elite, patrimony would prove to be a surprisingly weak basis for tapping royal power in the twelfth century. Th e c o u rt o f t h e k i n g , not the country estate, was the gateway to the heights of power—and royal favor and disfavor alike could dictate a noble family’s fortunes. It was royal favor that raised up the ﬁrst individual we may conﬁdently identify as a member of the Lara family: a courtier of Alfonso VI named Gonzalo Núñez (d. circa 1106). His ancestry is famously elusive. It now seems fairly clear, however, that Gonzalo was linked closely—perhaps by his marriage—to the Alfonso family, whose territorial base was near the Leonese border in the Tierra de Campos. This family would subsequently give rise to some of the most important lineages of the region (such as Osorio, Villalobos, and Froilaz).33 The most probable scenario is that Gonzalo was married to Goto, daughter of María Gutiérrez, who was in turn the daughter of Gutierre Alfonso.34 His father-in-law would then have been Nuño Álvarez (d. circa 1065), a nobleman who had been a witness of royal charters from 1038 onward and had probably been tenant of Amaya. The Álvarez family, in turn, was based between the Arlanzón and Duero rivers; this may account in part for the Laras’ subsequent strength in the area.35 What remains much less clear is Gonzalo’s own parentage. The simplicity of Spanish naming patterns in the High Middle Ages means that we do know his father was named Nuño;36 it has indeed been suggested that he was son, rather than son-in-law, of Nuño Álvarez, but this claim seems problematic.37 Among other possible fathers are two members of the Salvadores lineage, who by the 1060s had established their inﬂuence over a sweeping area near Burgos, including Lara itself.38 There do appear to be close ties between the Laras and the Salvadores family well into the twelfth century, but we still lack the evidence to make any precise paternal connection.39 We can quite safely dismiss the assertion by Salazar y Castro that Gonzalo had married into the Salvadores family.40 Finally, there is even less evidence that Gonzalo Núñez’s father was, as Salazar contends, a noble-\n\nThe Chains of Love\n\n17\n\nman named Nuño González, directly descended from the sovereign count of Castile, Fernán González.41 In sum, the link with the Alfonso family is at present the connection that may be stated most conﬁdently. Beyond the issue of ancestry lies the related question of patrimony. The evidence allows us to say that Gonzalo Núñez possessed a number of properties in Castilla Vieja, Campos, and Asturias (see Map 1). Notably, he and his wife Goto owned the monastery of Santa María de Piasca, which had been linked with the Alfonso lineage, and divisas (shares of an inheritance) in a number of neighboring villages. In 1095 the couple granted these holdings to the great Leonese monastery of Sahagún, along with divisas in other villages, mostly in the fertile\n\n1.

But even given the dangers of arguing from silence, it is likely that his patrimony was vastly inferior to the well-documented territorial holdings of the Laras in the later thirteenth or fourteenth centuries. Equally, there is nothing to suggest that it outstripped the patrimony of great families like the Trabas of Galicia, or the Ansúrez clan of León, whose political preeminence—whatever their territorial power—would decline rapidly in the coming decades. Instead, Gonzalo Núñez looks very much like a royal protégé: a man raised to great heights by virtue of the king’s good graces. He appeared as a witness of a small number of royal diplomas as early as the mid1070s, and a much larger number in the next two decades, almost certainly indicating that he was present in the royal entourage for long stretches of time.47 We can only imagine the qualities that might have endeared him to the king: unwavering loyalty, perhaps, as well as good humor, sharp political instincts, and a robust appetite for the hunt. One thing, however, is quite clear: Gonzalo was a trusted and talented warrior, at a time when the need for such men was greater than ever. Alfonso VI’s triumphant capture of Toledo had begun to seem more and more like a Pyrrhic victory: it had catalyzed an immense Muslim counterattack in 1086 by the Almoravids, the intolerant rulers of a huge northern African empire. The Christian kingdoms were now thrown back on the defensive, as Alfonso VI desperately tried to stem the tide. Serendipitously or otherwise, a new crusading ethos was also emerging in Spain.48 For an ambitious nobleman like Gonzalo Núñez, the situation presented a golden opportunity: the prestige that might\n\nThe Chains of Love\n\n19\n\nbe acquired through successful service in royal campaigns was enormous. In 1093 Don Gonzalo participated in a royal campaign as far to the west as Portugal.49 Two years later, he played a leading role in the unsuccessful attempt to stop the Almoravids from capturing the prosperous city of Huesca (in Aragón), presumably having been sent at the command of Alfonso VI, who was anxious to aid the Aragonese.50 The rewards of this loyal activity are duly reﬂected in a document of 1098, in which Alfonso makes reference to his “beloved Gonzalo Núñez.”51 Gonzalo, then, was probably a “new man”—a nobleman promoted in status as part of a conscious royal policy designed to renovate the elite. From the ninth-century potentes who, it has been said, were “made” as deliberately by the Asturian kings as a new Anglo-Norman aristocracy was made by William the Conqueror, to the privados favored by the Hapsburgs, Spanish political history is marked by repeated waves of such renovation. There were recurrent attempts to create a new body of potentates, bound more tightly in loyalty to the king than the old ruling class.52 The Laras’ novelty, like their subsequent ascendancy in Castile, makes them inherently distinctive; the sources of their inﬂuence are not, in other words, entirely representative of the nobility as a whole. On the other hand, there are plenty of parallel cases. Alfonso VI had elevated the Traba family of Galicia in a similar way, and new men virtually monopolized major positions in secular administration in the region. The most outstanding example is Count Raymond of Burgundy, to whom Alfonso married his daughter Urraca; Raymond was entrusted with the macro-tenancy of Galicia in 1079, soon after arriving at court, and he would retain it for no less than twenty years.53 In fact, the same process was occurring at almost exactly the same time, for almost exactly the same reasons, in the embryonic kingdom of Portugal. Here, the demands of military activity against the Almoravids at the turn of the twelfth century accelerated the emergence of a new elite at the court of Afonso Henriques at Coimbra, who gave a special role to members of families of the second rank.54 One suspects that this was precisely the principal reason for Gonzalo Núñez’s ascent. His good fortune was later consolidated by the arrival at court of his two sons, Pedro González (d. 1130) and Rodrigo González (d. circa 1143), at least one of whom was granted the ofﬁce of alférez.55 The young Lara brothers then sealed their success by marriage alliances with other aristocratic families.56 Don Gonzalo was rewarded, like many faithful courtiers, with valu-\n\n20\n\nSy m biosis\n\nable tenancies like Carazo, Huerta, and Osma. Much more remarkable, however, was his prolonged tenancy of Lara, which he held for at least fourteen years, 1081–1095.57 This was wholly exceptional; and it has sometimes been suggested that he received Lara not as a tenancy at all, but as a heritable patrimony acquired through kinship with the powerful Salvadores family. However, as we have seen, the evidence that Gonzalo Núñez de Lara was related to this family is still unclear; and it is not certain that Lara had ever been a patrimonial possession of the Salvadores family in any case.58 The fact that Gonzalo Núñez ﬁrst appears in control of Lara in 1081, two years before Gonzalo Salvadores’ death, certainly undermines the possibility. It is most likely that Gonzalo Núñez held Lara as a long-term tenancy, held and exploited as if it were a patrimony; the patrimonialization of tenancies appears to have been widespread in this period.59 If there was any form of kinship between the Laras and the Salvadores family, this association is likely to have been important primarily in the search for royal favor. In any case, the exceptionally prolonged tenure of Lara would eventually have a signiﬁcant impact in molding the family’s identity: the appellative “de Lara” appears in documents as late as the middle of the fourteenth century. It has been argued that the twelfth century marks the ﬁrst use of surnames among medieval Castilian noble families, often on a toponymic basis, indicating a sense of cohesion which had not been present in the eleventh century.60 However, in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, the styling “de Lara” seems to have been used only by those members of the family who actually held the tenancy. The Lara family would not develop a clear sense of lineage until the end of the twelfth century, and would not think of themselves as “Laras” until the thirteenth century at the earliest. For now, Lara is likely to have been most important for the family not in a psychological or cultural sense, but in an economic one. The alfoz of Lara included, in the twelfth century, a number of once-separate villages: Barbadillo (10 kilometers to the southeast), Carazo and perhaps Salas (both about 15 kilometers to the southeast).61 It was admittedly not so extensive as suggested by a document purportedly issued in 931 by the countess Momadona and her son, Count Fernán González, determining the boundaries of the lordship so as to include no fewer than sixty-six villages.62 It is now widely agreed that the document is forged, probably created under the aegis of the concejo of Burgos in the thirteenth century after the absorption of Lara by the city.63 But the tenancy of Lara\n\nThe Chains of Love\n\n21\n\nwas sometimes coupled with tenancy of other nearby districts such as Huerta (close to the eastern frontier), so there may have been some legitimacy to the eastern frontier claimed by the diploma; the same may be said regarding the southern boundary.64 The tenancy of Lara would certainly have been lucrative, and would have dwarfed any of Gonzalo Núñez’s patrimonial holdings. The dramatic rise of the Lara family was, it would appear, due less to autonomous patrimonial power than to inﬂuence at court; and this courtly inﬂuence was to reach new heights in the reign of Alfonso VI’s daughter, Urraca. Q u e e n U r r a c a (reigned 1109–1126) has been maligned ever since her falling out with the ﬁrst archbishop of Compostela, Diego Gelmírez, whose heated resentments were immortalized in the Historia compostellana.65 For many historians, her reign represents a period of anarchy, unrest, and even “feudal revolution.”66 However, others have persuasively argued that the queen was both active and, in some respects at least, effective; certainly, even in her reign, royal favor remained fundamental.67 The importance of her favor is made wonderfully clear in Gelmírez’s chronicle, in reference to Pedro González de Lara: “This Count Pedro, so it was rumored, used to indulge in extremely strong chains of love with Queen Urraca, and from her held Castile and no small part of Campos.”68 It is not clear precisely when his relationship with Urraca began, but it is likely to have been shortly after his nearest rival died in 1111. Count Gómez González had been favored to marry the queen by a majority of the bishops and nobles of the realm after the death of Urraca’s ﬁrst husband, Count Raymond of Burgundy, in 1107. When, in 1109, she married Alfonso I el Batallador of Aragón (reigned 1104–1134), many of the Castilian elite rose in opposition, clustering around Count Gómez. As her marriage began to collapse, the count felt contentedly that he had wedlock within his grasp and “began to conduct the wars of the kingdom,” but died in battle against the Aragonese.69 Beginning around 1112, Pedro González de Lara inherited Urraca’s favor and the dominance this brought. The report of the affair is echoed in the thirteenth-century chronicle De rebus Hispania. “Count Pedro of Lara, while he displayed undue private familiarity with the Queen, which he hoped to strengthen through marriage, was preeminent over all people, and began to exercise the ofﬁce of king, and to rule everyone as a lord.”70 The relationship serves to underline, in a particularly literal fashion,\n\n22\n\nSy m biosis\n\nthe intimacy of power in twelfth-century Spain. Pedro González’s presence at court may be traced in royal diplomas from the ﬁrst moments of the reign, when he appears with the ofﬁce of alférez,71 but his closeness to Urraca visibly promoted his career.72 From 1107, he appears in the diplomas with the title of count.73 He took further advantage of his virtually constant presence at Urraca’s side to acquire a variety of tenancies in Castile and Campos, and to maintain control of the tenancy of Lara, which was evidently coming to be regarded almost as a family possession.74 His power was unrivaled, and if the surviving diplomas are representative, his inﬂuence was even greater in the second half of the reign, partly because of the death of the great Leonese count Pedro Ansúrez around 1117.75 Only determined opposition by other noble families kept his power within bounds, preventing him from gaining a strong foothold in León or Galicia. This opposition emerged as a direct response to Pedro’s liaison with the queen: “The other magnates, not supporting the lady’s infamy, began to resist him, and to impede the plan of marriage.”76 The Primera crónica general suggests that the magnates, believing that their rightful access to the monarch had been denied, felt it essential to establish a new king: Urraca’s son by her ﬁrst marriage, Alfonso Raimúndez.77 Armed resistance reached a climax early in 1119, when Pedro González was seized and brieﬂy imprisoned by Guter Fernández de Castro. Thus began the great rivalry between the Lara and Castro families, which would be one of the main features of Castilian politics in the twelfth century.78 Yet for now, opposition was only a temporary inconvenience. By 1119, the challenge had been defused by a deft political compromise, and Pedro’s position was secure. As in the previous generation, his patrimony seems likely to have been of merely secondary importance (see Map 2). We know that he was lord of the villages of Jaramillo Quemado and Tardajos; like his father, he also had holdings in the fertile land of Campos, quite possibly a reﬂection of the Laras’ descent from the Alfonso family.79 But there is no evidence that his patrimonial supremacy was remotely equivalent to his political power. The same is true of his younger brother, Rodrigo (see Map 3). As we might expect, given the importance of partible inheritance, Rodrigo González had holdings of more or less equivalent size. Some of his property was, again, in Campos.80 Far to the north, in Asturias, he had property in Arce and the little mountain village of San\n\nThe Chains of Love\n\n23\n\n2.

But his rapid rise to prominence, like his acquisition of tenancies, would be largely dependent on his brother’s political success. In fact, one of the most striking elements of the Laras’ experience in this early stage is the importance of horizontal and especially fraternal bonds: in an age before the full development of primogeniture and the linear transmission of entailed estates, brotherly love and loyalty was often the axis of aristocratic behavior. In the next two generations, Lara brothers would also come to dominate Castilian political life. It is striking that Rodrigo had been almost totally absent from court before\n\n24\n\nSy m biosis\n\n3.

Among these was the tenancy of Asturias de Santillana, which probably involved jurisdictional and military authority over a number of places in the north of the peninsula, and may well have been intended as a safeguard against Aragonese pretensions. More brieﬂy, he acquired the tenancy of Toledo, by far the largest city in the kingdom.85 During the ﬁnal years of Urraca’s reign, a semblance of stability was restored to Castile. In 1124, both Pedro and Rodrigo González, who were clearly devoted followers of the queen, conﬁrmed diplomas issued by her young son Alfonso Raimúndez (child of her marriage to Raymond of Burgundy) in which he was already styling himself king.86 Yet any hopes of lasting harmony were immediately dispelled when she died on 8 March 1126. Ironically, the traditional view of her reign as a period of anarchic disruption is usually matched by agreement that her son, now enthroned as Alfonso VII (reigned 1126–1157), was responsible for the reimposition of royal authority: darkness was supposedly followed by light.87 In reality, half a dozen years of peace in the closing stage of the queen’s reign were now followed by a half-dozen of turmoil. On the very day after Urraca’s death, Alfonso arrived at León to ﬁnd that the fortress of the city was refusing to recognize him: the rebels’ hopes lay “in Count Pedro of Lara and his brother Rodrigo González, Castilians who preferred to have war rather than peace with the king.”88 The king’s forces stormed the fortress, but the two Lara brothers held out against royal authority in Asturias de Santillana, the region which formed one of Rodrigo’s key tenancies.89 Salazar y Castro, writing in the late seventeenth century, suggested that Pedro González aimed at nothing less than independent sovereignty. “Among mortals, there is nothing so commendable, or so hungered for, as the status of recognizing the authority of no one, and depending solely on God and one’s own judgment.”90 Claiming that in Spain, only Portugal, Albarracín, and Molina ever managed to establish such sovereignty (one might surely add the renegade county of Castile), Salazar added that the príncipes of the house of Lara were among very few ever to attempt it. Pedro González, in his view, was the ﬁrst who “showed himself desirous of that prerogative.” In support of his claim, he refers to a diploma of 1128 in which Pedro refers to himself as count of Lara “by the grace of God.” This, Salazar states, was something that no other Castilian subject dared to do, with the exception of Pedro’s own de-\n\n26\n\nSy m biosis\n\nscendants and, in 1170, a lord of Vizcaya.91 However, it is not at all clear that the phrase indicates any subversive aspiration to autonomy. When Pedro González’s eldest son Manrique used the formula Malric Dei gratia comes in 1148, for example, he clearly enjoyed the good graces of the king.92 The need to rely on the intensely hostile royal chronicle in fact makes the Laras’ strategy almost completely impenetrable. However, it is not hard to hazard a guess. The queen’s death had left them facing a sudden loss of hegemony at court and the accession of an unsympathetic monarch whose Galician supporters would probably be rewarded at their expense.93 It is possible that Pedro González wished to place his son by Urraca, Fernando Pérez, on the throne, but more likely that he aspired to the accession of Alfonso I el Batallador, with whom Urraca had maintained a cordial relationship for the last decade of her life.94 The Aragonese king still maintained his aspirations to imperial control over Castile. As Bernard Reilly observes, as long as Urraca had been queen, Pedro González and Alfonso I had been natural enemies; now that she was dead, and Alfonso Raimúndez in control of most of Castile, they were natural allies.95 For now, Pedro and his brother returned grudgingly to court, but twice in the next three years Pedro would passively support the Aragonese.96 First, in July 1127, when Alfonso VII summoned an army to intercept Aragonese forces on their way to Castrojeriz, Pedro’s recalcitrance seems to have forced the Castilian king to agree to terms. “Count Pedro of Lara, who was in the ﬁrst regiment of the king of León, did not want to ﬁght against the king of Aragón, because his heart was with him, and he [Pedro] had discussion with him.”97 Again, when el Batallador was menacing the frontier early in 1129, the Laras were humiliatingly unresponsive: “Count Pedro of Lara and his brother Count Rodrigo and their people and allies did not want to go in support of the king of León.”98 The tension between the king and Pedro González reached the boiling point in 1130, when Alfonso VII seized and imprisoned Count Pedro and his son-in-law Count Bertran of Risnel because “they were disturbing the kingdom.”99 Showing the kind of fraternal solidarity that was characteristic of the Laras in the twelfth century, Rodrigo González rebelled immediately, but the two prisoners were kept in chains until their castles and towns were surrendered. Paramount among Pedro González’s lost possessions was the tenancy of Lara, which appeared later the same year in the hands of\n\nThe Chains of Love\n\n27\n\nOrdoño Gustios, probably yet another “new man,” a member of the lesser nobility who had been elevated to undermine the power of the older aristocracy.100 Count Pedro ﬂed immediately to Aragón, seeking the aid of el Batallador, who was busy besieging Bayonne in an attempt to expand his control over the Basque Country.101 But no sooner had he reached the Aragonese camp at Bayonne than he challenged the Count of Toulouse to hand-to-hand combat. “And they went out to war like two strong lions, and Count Pedro was wounded by Count Alfonso and, falling from his horse, broke his arm and died some days later.”102 Once the metaphorical chains of favor binding the Laras to the crown had been broken, the family was left virtually powerless. They found themselves forced to watch the rise of new protégés like Ponce de Cabrera and Ponce de Minerva—Catalans, no less, who had arrived in 1127 in the retinue of Alfonso VII’s bride, Berenguela. The newcomers’ ascent is a perfect illustration of the power of royal patronage. “Landless outsiders when they arrived,” writes Simon Barton, “they were nonetheless able, by dint of service to the crown, to become leading ﬁgures on the stage of Leonese-Castilian politics.”103 The Laras’ fall, conversely, was paralleled by that of the Flaínez clan, which had been among the most powerful Leonese families at the turn of the century but which, deprived of royal favor, was now reduced to purely local importance.104 The leading noble families did not enjoy the depth of patrimony that they would have by the end of the thirteenth century, and their political autonomy was correspondingly limited. Rodrigo González de Lara, for example, was simply incapable of sustained resistance after his brother’s death. Falling upon him and other rebels in Asturias de Santillana, the king seized their castles, set ﬁre to their properties and cut down their vines and orchards. Seeing that he could avoid the king “neither in castles, nor in mountains, nor in caves,” Rodrigo was obliged to negotiate with him.105 We are told that during the course of their talks by the Pisuerga River, Alfonso VII became angry with Rodrigo and seized him by the neck; they fell from their horses, and the count’s soldiers ﬂed in terror. Rodrigo was now placed in iron chains—the chains of disfavor—and held until he yielded his honors and castles. The king then “dismissed him, empty and without honor.”106\n\n2 The Revels of War\n\nD\n\ne s p i t e t h e L a r a s ’ r e b e l l i o n early in the reign of Alfonso VII, their relationship with the monarchy was only occasionally confrontational in the twelfth century, because they relied on their closeness to the crown and lacked the resources necessary for prolonged opposition. Equally, the centralization of government, which would destabilize the world of thirteenth-century politics, was not yet a royal ambition. From the king’s perspective, a good working relationship with the Laras was still valuable, particularly in matters of war. It was probably during Alfonso VII’s reign that the ideal of crusade took root in Spain, advancing under the banner of St. James, whose mythical persona was now transformed from peaceable ﬁsherman into Matamoros, the imperious Moorslayer.1 Alfonso himself led twentynine military expeditions, culminating in the triumphant conquest of Almería in 1147.2 As in other western European kingdoms, war stimulated the royal military structure and mobilized more ﬁscal resources, so that it became even more important for the nobility to obtain a piece of the royal pie.3 Speciﬁcally, the reign catalyzed the emergence of frontier militias in royal barracks towns like Ávila, Segovia, and Salamanca; and the tenants of these places (who were often known as alcaldes) took on a particular importance in organizing their military mobilization and campaigns.4 Members of the Lara family would repeatedly be favored to ﬁll these tenancies; and indeed it was the intensiﬁcation of Castilian military activity in the south that allowed the Laras to recover their earlier prominence in the kingdom.\n\nThe Revels of War\n\n29\n\nThe Almoravids, who ever since their arrival in Spain in 1086 had brought a new degree of aggression to Christian-Muslim relations, had lately stepped up their offensive campaigns in the Tagus valley, destroying the castle of Aceca in 1130. During the following year, they killed the governor of Toledo, who was replaced in 1132 by Rodrigo González de Lara. Rodrigo had returned to the royal court earlier in the year, admitting his fault to the king, and was immediately granted “great honors in Extremadura and Castile,” among them the tenancies of Segovia and Toledo.5 Alfonso’s magnanimity is remarkable, but there was a good deal of pragmatism involved, too. Rodrigo González had previously held the tenancy of Toledo under Urraca; and like his father, who had been sent to ﬁght the Almoravids at Huesca, he was evidently perceived as an outstanding military leader.6 He wasted no time in conﬁrming this reputation. In June 1132, Rodrigo led a devastating campaign down the Guadalquivir valley, as far as the outskirts of Seville itself, setting ﬁres, cutting down orchards, and seizing immense quantities of booty: gold and silver, costly clothing, horses and asses, oxen, cows, and other cattle.7 The long-term rewards were even greater: within three years, he had also been granted the tenancy of Asturias and received a major patrimonial grant from Alfonso VII.8 These were heady days for the Castilian monarchy and a good moment for a nobleman in royal service. In 1135, King Alfonso was formally crowned emperor in León cathedral, solemnizing a Castilian-Leonese pretension to lordship over the other Christian kingdoms that had been forming since the end of the previous century.9 Success in Andalucía brought buoyant conﬁdence, and began to reverse the slow exhaustion of war proﬁts that had occurred after the Almoravid invasion. The “warrior economy” and the redistributive function of the king were therefore revitalized. Markedly more than in Catalonia, the nobility remained dependent on royal service.10 The other side of the coin of royal favor became clear in 1137, when Rodrigo’s fortunes failed to survive an acrimonious dispute with the king. We do not know the cause, although it is possible that the king perceived him as being dangerously well connected: following his earlier wedding to a daughter of Alfonso VI, he had married again, this time to Estefanía, daughter of Count Armengol VI of Urgell.11 After learning that Alfonso’s patience toward him was rapidly deteriorating, Rodrigo surrendered Toledo and other cities and towns he held. He then left for the Holy Land, where he is said to have built a castle and\n\n30\n\nSy m biosis\n\ngiven it over to the Knights Templar. Returning over the Adriatic, he eventually landed again on Spanish shores, staying for a time with Ramón Berenguer IV of Barcelona, before traveling on to the courts of Navarre and Valencia, whereupon he contracted leprosy.12 After a brief return to his Castilian homeland, the dying Rodrigo made a ﬁnal journey to Jerusalem, and remained there until his death in about 1143.13 Rodrigo’s return to royal service had been a false dawn for the Laras. But in the 1140s, as the authority of the Almoravids in Andalucía began to disintegrate under internal pressure, Castilian campaigns in the south accelerated again, bringing yet greater opportunities for military heroism. Recounting the capture of a number of Andalusian towns, including Andújar and Baeza, the Poema de Almería rhapsodizes about one hero in particular: Manrique de Lara (d. 1164), the eldest son of Pedro González: He was pleasing to everyone and at the same time to the emperor, so that he shone among the Saracens and the Christians. Outstanding in repute, he was loved by all; liberal and generous, he was never miserly to anyone.14 Manrique’s ability to be pleasing to the emperor-king, by feats of arms and chivalric largesse, was vital to the unexpectedly swift recovery of the Lara family in the middle of the twelfth century, after the rebellions of the preceding years. His liberality, generosity, and charm brought prominence and prestige; and Manrique inherited, above all, the reputation for military skill that his uncle Rodrigo had earned. This, of course, brought him tenancies. It has been suggested that Alfonso VII’s reign marked the beginning of a process whereby tenancies were held on a long-term basis, but even if this is so, royal favor remained absolutely critical.15 Manrique had already held the pivotal frontier towns of Ávila and Toledo in the mid-1130s, while he was prominent in the royal court, as well as serving as alférez between 1134 and 1137.16 After a lacuna of several years, lasting until 1142, his regular presence at court allowed him to begin accumulating more border tenancies: Medinaceli and the little town of Madrid were added to Ávila and Toledo in the mid-1140s (see Map 4).17 Since he never acquired the ofﬁce of alférez again, it was probably as tenant of Toledo\n\nThe Revels of War\n\n31\n\n4.

Having been designated a count in 1145, he was present at the ﬁrst conquest of Córdoba (1146), and the absorption of Baeza and Calatrava early the next year.18 The culmination of his military career, however, was his role in the conquest of the port city of Almería (1147– 1148), and in this context the poet of the campaign describes how Manrique ﬂourished in arms and “reveled in war.”19 His leadership in these celebrated campaigns, which beneﬁted from an implosion of Almoravid imperial power, can only have strengthened his immense prestige at court and accelerated the cycle of the family’s success. He was granted immediate tenancy of Baeza, and retained control of it for a full ten years before a successful Muslim counterattack. Such was the extent of Manrique’s jurisdiction that he appointed an alcalde to administer the tenancy in his stead; in fact, he developed a private ofﬁcialdom that also included his own mayordomo, an alférez, and, rather unusually, a professional notary.20 One of the more hagiographic modern appraisals of Manrique— written in the 1920s—claims that he was “the greatest politico-military ﬁgure of the entire Middle Ages,” and suggests that he was the most shining example of vassalic or ministerial loyalty in the whole course of Spanish history.21 Such a view, coming as it does from an author who interweaves pseudo-history with the claim that the Primo de Rivera dictatorship is essential for Spain and that Catalonia is an open prison, should remind us of the dangers (and political implications) of glorifying military exploits. Nonetheless, it should also remind us of the importance of individual personality and talent, a factor that is sometimes lost in the contemporary focus on family structures.22 The role of individuality is demonstrated inversely by the relative insigniﬁcance of Álvaro Pérez (d. 1172), the second in the triumvirate of Lara brothers in the mid-twelfth century and by far the least prominent. Álvaro, who is curiously invisible in the reign of Alfonso VII, enjoyed relatively few tenancies, ﬂeetingly and belatedly, mostly after the mid-1160s (see Map 5).23 He would not have enough prestige to be addressed as a count until as late as 1166.24 Their youngest brother, Nuño Pérez (d. 1177), on the other hand, was extremely active under Alfonso VII, holding the ofﬁce of alférez between 1145 and 1155.25 His relationship with Manrique is, in fact, the second of two great brotherly partnerships that would characterize the history of the Laras in the\n\nThe Revels of War\n\n33\n\n5.

In his capacity as alférez, he had joined Manrique at the conquests of Baeza, Calatrava, and Almería, before being taken hostage and imprisoned in Jaén.26 He was evidently ransomed soon after, however, and we may imagine he took special pleasure in the act of besieging Jaén in 1150.27\n\n34\n\nSy m biosis\n\nIt is, once again, unlikely that the Laras’ ascendancy at court was driven by preexistent territorial power. Manrique possessed a few houses in Burgos;28 some property in Toledo;29 some lands to the west of Molina, which were alienated in 1151 and 1153;30 and probably the properties in Arandilla and Madrigal alienated by his wife, Ermesenda, after his death.31 He also held one major estate, Molina, on the Aragonese frontier, but it appears to have been his position as royal alférez that allowed him to acquire it. In the fuero (or law code) which he granted to the town, Manrique states: “I found a greatly deserted place that I wish to be populated.”32 One suspects that he took the virtually abandoned town and territory of Molina with little or no resistance, perhaps as early as 1134, when he had ﬁrst held the ofﬁce of alférez and when Castilian forces had advanced on Zaragoza.33 Alfonso VII may then have formally granted Molina to the alférez who had captured it as a reward for his service in the Zaragoza campaign.34 The fuero’s modern editor rejects what he sees as a fanciful story told by a fourteenth-century chronicler, in which Manrique’s possession of Molina is explained as the result of a dispute between the kings of Castile and Aragón.35 However, King Alfonso’s decision may quite well be attributed to the continual Castilian-Aragonese friction that was focused on the border zone. According to the surviving text of the fuero, which is dated 1154, Manrique instructed the inhabitants of Molina: “You shall always have a lord from among my sons and grandsons, one that is pleasing to you and will do good for you; otherwise you shall have no lord.”36 It might seem at ﬁrst that Molina was perceived as what would become known as a behetría de linaje—by later romantic tradition, a place whose inhabitants were able to choose any lord from a given lineage. But it was treated as if it were a freely alienable patrimonial possession. After Manrique’s death in 1164, his wife, Ermesenda, received half of the lordship, and his son, Pedro Manrique, the other half; then, in 1175, Ermesenda herself partitioned her share, granting half to the Order of Calatrava and the other to her grandson García Pérez Manrique.37 This fragmentation and alienation would have been impossible in a behetría de linaje. There is perhaps good reason for us to be suspicious of the text. If this portion of the fuero had indeed been written in 1154, the two divisions would have contravened it. Instead, it bears the imprint of a later age. Although the twentieth-century editor of the text assumes that it is an accurate copy of the original, he suggests that it\n\nThe Revels of War\n\n35\n\nprobably dates from the end of the thirteenth century or the beginning of the fourteenth.38 If one were, in fact, to date the text to around 1290, there would be a good explanation for its redaction and, indeed, adaptation. By this time, the Lara family would be urgently concerned with reinforcing their position on the Aragonese frontier. The marriage in 1290 of Juan Núñez II de Lara to Isabel, heiress of Molina, created a powerful stimulus for the forgery of evidence purporting to show that Molina had always been a behetría de linaje and was therefore an inalienable possession of the Laras. The late thirteenth-century redaction is replete with references to the de facto independence of the lordship of Molina, an independence that would be crucial for the Laras in these far more confrontational years. It speciﬁes that inhabitants are obliged to perform service in the count’s host but not that of the king, and that no heraldic symbol should be displayed other than those of the count or concejo.39 These concerns would make far more sense in a document of the 1290s, when Juan Núñez II clashed violently with Sancho IV of Castile, than in a document of 1154 ostensibly produced by a noble whose career had been built from the start upon service in Alfonso VII’s military campaigns. Fr o n t i e r t e n a n t s in the kingdom of Castile and León would have grown increasingly nervous in the mid-1150s, as a new Islamic movement originating in Morocco—the Almohads—displaced the crumbling power of their predecessors, the Almoravids, in the south. Devout, militant, and purposeful, the Almohads recaptured Manrique de Lara’s tenancies of Almería and Baeza in 1157, and over the coming decades they would press farther and farther toward the heart of the peninsula. The same year marked the death of Alfonso VII and brought an end to the phase of Christian expansionism that had characterized his reign. Following the emperor’s death, the twin realms of León and Castile were partitioned in accordance with his wishes: León passed to his younger son, Fernando II (reigned 1157–1188), and Castile to his short-lived eldest son, Sancho III (reigned 1157–1158), who was then succeeded by the child-king Alfonso VIII (reigned 1158–1214). However, the partition, which would last until 1230, further undermined the security of the two kingdoms, allowing noble families to set one realm against another.40 This became immediately apparent during the vicious struggle for preeminence between the Laras and the Castro\n\n36\n\nSy m biosis\n\nfamily that occurred in the minority of Alfonso VIII. Early in Alfonso’s reign, according to the thirteenth-century De rebus Hispaniae, the body of Gutierre Fernández de Castro was summarily disinterred by his vengeful rival, Manrique de Lara, who had managed to gain custody of the young king. Manrique, says the chronicler, was determined to hasten the return of tenancies held from the crown, which Sancho III had allegedly agreed to freeze for a ﬁfteen-year period; he threatened to charge Gutierre Fernández posthumously as a traitor if Gutierre’s nephews did not comply.41 The tale is in fact chronologically impossible; yet the ferocious competition for control of the king, which the chronicle describes, was an important feature of this era.42 The Lara family’s proximity to Alfonso VIII was lucrative, and they fought hard to intensify their ascendancy at court, feeding the ﬁres of a long struggle with the Castro family for control of the king. As the story of Manrique’s unsavory exhumation shows, making sense of this period entails careful distillation of the chronicles. Their accounts of how the Laras had managed to acquire custody of the king in the ﬁrst place are again both implausible and revealing. They relate that Alfonso VIII had initially been entrusted to the care of Gutierre Fernández de Castro; the Laras are said to have politely advised him to surrender this privilege to Manrique, whose popular support in Extremadura, they said, would enable him to quell unrest in the kingdom. The lord of Castro, duped by the Laras’ ostensible public-spiritedness, granted them possession of the child-king, and Alfonso VIII was ﬁrst placed in the custody of a relative of the Laras, García Garcés de Aza. But when the Lara brothers saw that García Garcés could not afford this responsibility, they had the king handed over to the avaricious Manrique.43 In its details, the narrative is unpersuasive—Gutierre Fernández, for instance, behaves with improbable naiveté—but the underlying principle is transparent. There could be no better evidence of the clarity with which the Lara family and others recognized the importance of personal access to the king. Deprived of custody, the Castros then turned desperately for assistance to the king of León, as the Laras would do a half-century later when their control of the young King Enrique I was ended by his sudden death. This was a natural tactic, in view of the various marriage alliances between the Castros and the Leonese Alfonso family, and it seemed to work. The Leonese defeated Nuño Pérez in battle in July\n\nThe Revels of War\n\n37\n\n1160 and occupied a large area of the frontier region of Castile then known as Extremadura (including Ávila and Segovia).44 The events as recounted in the chronicle are as follows: Both the kingdom in general and Manrique in particular are then driven to such a ﬁnancial crisis that Manrique is forced to surrender the young king in vassalage to Fernando II of León. They travel to Soria, and Fernando arrives to meet them; but as the transfer is about to occur, young Alfonso is rescued on horseback by a young knight who spirits him away to the castle of San Esteban de Gormaz. The people of Soria go off in hot pursuit, but Nuño Pérez intercepts him and has whisked him off to Atienza by the next morning.45 For once, the swashbuckling narrative may be at least partly true: in September 1162, Manrique concluded a peace treaty with the king of León in which he was indeed obliged to surrender control of Alfonso, and according to one source was immediately granted custody again.46 The dramatic removal of the child-king to the castle of San Esteban (which, like Atienza, was held by Manrique) may in reality have occurred with the full consent of Fernando II. Quite possibly, Fernando had granted physical custody of Alfonso to the Laras in return for a symbolic act of homage whereby his imperial overlordship was recognized. In the wake of the treaty, Manrique and his brothers witnessed a number of Leonese diplomas while Fernando II styled himself king “in Toledo, Extremadura, Castile, León, Galicia, and Asturias.”47 Having regained physical custody of the king, the Laras “inseparably and faithfully adhered to him.”48 Manrique, who had been “in charge of the business of the kingdom” as early as 1158, is described in a diploma of 1161 as “the king’s servant”;49 along with Nuño Pérez, he appears as “administrator of the king’s business” in 1163,50 and was still enjoying this role in early 1164.51 In the course of a military campaign during the summer, designed to capture stubborn Castro tenancies in the Transierra, Manrique was killed during an unsuccessful siege of the town of Huete.52 To rub salt in the wound, Nuño Pérez was also captured. Yet the family’s momentum was not easily halted. During a release to attend to his brother’s funeral, Nuño Pérez escaped, and immediately assumed unrivaled prominence at court.53 To their enemies, the Laras must have seemed like a Hydra: no sooner had one ghastly head of the family been removed than others appeared in its stead. Interestingly, it was a brother, rather than a son, who took Manrique’s place;54\n\n38\n\nSy m biosis\n\nin an age before transmission of land through primogeniture reached its full development, fraternal bonds would be important again and again. Just as Pedro and Rodrigo González had dominated Castile early in the 1120s, so Pedro’s three children dominated in the 1160s. Nuño Pérez’s supremacy in the kingdom after Manrique’s death was widely recognized. On 1 March 1165, Pope Alexander III addressed him directly, informing him that since the excommunicated bishop of Osma had not appeared before him, the bishop should be replaced; Don Nuño was evidently perceived as the de facto ruler, and sole regent, of the kingdom.55 He conﬁrmed royal diplomas frequently from the beginning of the reign until his death, appearing high in the lists of witnesses, and from 1162 onward enjoyed the status of count.56 He retained his elevated position as “administrator of the king’s affairs” into the 1170s; and from the beginning of 1168, the diplomas formulaically describe him as performing this role faithfully.57 Most striking of all is a reference to Nuño Pérez in 1174–1175 as “tenant of the court of King Alfonso,” a term which may be unique in the history of Castile.58 The Crónica Latina de los reyes de Castilla states that through their control of the king, Manrique and Nuño had each attempted to subordinate all other considerations to their own honor and self-interest.59 This view is not entirely without foundation: Nuño enjoyed a substantial proportion of his tenancies in these years, and was also able to ensure an important role for his eldest son, Fernando Núñez (d. 1219), who, rather unusually, appears with the title of count during his father’s own lifetime.60 Did any of Nuño’s tenancies derive from independent, patrimonial strength? In a few cases, this is possible, and the family’s territorial inﬂuence does seem rather more substantial in this period than it had been a generation or two earlier. Characteristically for the twelfth century, Nuño Pérez’s lands were extremely diffuse (see Map 6). He was lord of Gama on the north coast;61 Sarracín, south of Burgos, which he granted to the monastery of Arlanza in exchange for Huérmeces, northwest of Molina;62 Alcabón and Aceca, near Toledo;63 and some houses in Toledo itself.64 But the correlation between patrimony and tenancies occurs in the area near the Leonese border. It was here, for example, that he founded the hospital of Puente Itero.65 In this area, he also possessed land in Zorita and Perales;66 Cisneros and Villela;67 and,\n\nThe Revels of War\n\n39\n\n6.

But causal connections are hard to prove; it is also conceivable that some of the properties had been acquired because of a reverse process, a result of his inﬂuence as a tenant in this region. Patrimony might accrue directly from royal favor, as in the case of Chillón, valuable for its mercury mines, which he received in a grant from Alfonso VIII “for the many great services that you, Count Nuño, have both devotedly and faithfully shown to me.”69 The question about patrimonial power is also worth asking in the context of Pedro Rodríguez (d. 1183), who as son of Count Rodrigo González was usually dubbed ﬁlius comitis.70 Pedro seems to have been the inheritor of his father’s moderate patrimonial interests in northern Castile (see Map 7). He had properties to the east of the bay of Santander;71 further inland, in a number of places close to Villarcayo;72 and, ﬁnally, in Huérmeces.73 It is true that his tenancies—Bureba, Castilla la Vieja, and Nájera—were also located toward the north. However, the geographical correlation is close only in very broad, regional terms. There is even less of a correlation in the case of his nephew, Pedro Manrique (see Map 8). In the old Castilian heartland, Pedro Manrique (d. 1202) had a variety of properties: some houses in Burgos;74 some possessions in nearby Los Ausines;75 and, further to the south, in Cogolludo and Carabanchel, along with two properties near Toledo which he sold to the cathedral in 1177.76 On the basis of this and other sales, at least two historians have made the extrapolation that he was not a good administrator, although it is equally possible that he simply viewed his patrimony as the source of a small, quick proﬁt.77 Meanwhile, he was entrusted with important frontier tenancies along a line stretching from Lara and San Esteban, through Atienza and the Transierra, to Toledo and Cuenca. It is admittedly possible that his possessions in Molina made him a natural choice to serve this leading role on the southeastern frontier. However, apart from Molina itself his patrimonial possessions in this region are less than spectacular.78 We should associate his tenancies largely with the inﬂuence of his father, Manrique, who had paved the way for the son’s own success at court.79 The Laras’ preeminence in the kingdom was certainly not unchal-\n\nThe Revels of War\n\n41\n\n7.

On the second occasion, during an attempt to regain control of castles held by the Castros, he was captured at Zorita and imprisoned before being released as a result of a Castilian counter-offensive. Earlier, in 1165, Fernando II of León had also renewed hostilities. After reaching peace with the Portuguese, he attacked the Castilians, who were led by Nuño Pérez, pursuing them to Medina de Rioseco, where he laid siege. Once again (for at least the fourth time in his life), Nuño was imprisoned, and once more he barely escaped.80 However, after the Castilians recaptured Toledo from a Leonese garrison in 1166, the\n\nMontes de León\n\nTo rm es\n\nTajo\n\nEbro\n\nn agó Ar\n\nGallego\n\nNe rvi ón\n\nBurgos Los Ausines Hontoria Lara Dueñas de la Cantera Cabezón Alcózar Toro Osma ón ero San Esteban u Jal D de Gormaz Atienza Medinaceli EXTREMADURA Salamanca Cogolludo Molina ral Hita Si ent ste C m Valtablado Beteta ema aI Sist bé ric TRANSIERRA Tragacete o Bonilla Huete Añover de Tajo Cañete Carabanchel Cuenca Barciles Toledo Montes de Toledo\n\nLeón\n\nCordillera Cantábrica\n\nasturias de oviedo\n\nPisuerga\n\nBabia Luna\n\nEs la\n\nCiudad Rodrigo\n\nSil\n\nN aló n\n\nBAY OF BISCAY\n\nPir ine os Llobregat\n\nCinc a\n\nTer\n\nNarbonne\n\na loc Gi\n\nAreas of Tenancy\n\n0 10 20 30 miles\n\nASTURIAS DE OVIEDO\n\nEXTREMADURA\n\nBoth Tenancy and Patrimony\n\nTenancy\n\nPatrimony\n\na lan ata N -C o EA r AN oste R C R a TE ller DI SEA rdi ME Co Se gr e\n\n8.

Opposition, for now, was limited for at least two reasons. First, the webs of personal power relations which were spun at the royal court tended to produce a factional pursuit of interests and therefore factional opposition; this contrasted with the broader type of political association which would emerge in the thirteenth century. Noble alliances extending beyond the family or a restricted geographic orbit appear to have been rare in the twelfth century. In practical terms, this meant that Nuño Pérez was facing an easily isolated, and easily defeated, enemy. Second, he does not appear to have pursued his own interests with quite the reckless abandon that would characterize the Laras in the early thirteenth century. The rival Haro family remained prominent at court during the years of Lara domination, and two Lara sons even married Haro daughters.83 The family’s ascendancy would remain stable as long as it avoided exclusivity–and not a moment longer.\n\n3 A Zenith and a Nadir\n\nI\n\nn t h e M u s e u m o f M e d i e va l Fa b r i c s , in the monastery of Las Huelgas near Burgos, a cream-colored bonnet is on display, embroidered with dozens of russet-colored cauldrons. It dates from the early thirteenth century and is almost perfectly preserved, having been sealed for centuries in the raised stone tomb of Enrique I of Castile (reigned 1214–1217). But the bonnet was not Enrique’s. It is thought instead to have belonged to Álvaro Núñez de Lara, and the cauldrons may be the earliest representation of the family’s heraldic arms.1 Fifteen-year-old Enrique had died suddenly, in the custody of Álvaro Núñez, who was head of the family in the ﬁrst two decades of the century. The presence of the bonnet in the young king’s tomb is a graphic illustration of the Laras’ political dominance at this stage; and in a sense, it is also a symbol of the disaster that was to befall them. In the aftermath of Enrique’s death, the family would be ﬂung from power by a wave of domestic opposition, defeated in battle, and forced to seek refuge in the court of León. A generation earlier, the fate of the Laras could not possibly have been foreseen. An illustrious marriage between Pedro Manrique de Lara and the infanta Sancha Garcés of Navarre (1165) had mingled the blood of the family with that of El Cid himself; Sancha was the hero’s great-granddaughter.2 Indeed, it has been suggested that many features of the Poema de Mio Cid, which probably dates from the late twelfth or early thirteenth century, bear the imprint of a pro-Lara agenda. There is, for example, the viliﬁcation of the infantes of Carrión (ances-\n\nA Zenith and a Nadir\n\n45\n\ntors of the rival Castros) and the disproportionate emphasis on a lord of Molina; the poem may even have been written by a member of the Laras’ retinue, with the aim of advancing the family’s position.3 It is also possible that, as Simon Barton has argued, the poem can be read as a monarchical response to defections by Castilian nobles to the crown of León, and as an attempt to reinforce awareness of the rights and obligations of vassalage.4 The Laras would certainly be among those who sought advantage in the dynastic division of Castile and León. After all, in both kingdoms, the power of the nobility was still predicated upon the strength of the crown. There was never a time in the late twelfth century when the Laras were not represented at the two royal courts, and rarely a moment when members of the family did not hold important tenancies. The remarriage of Teresa, Nuño Pérez’s widow, to Fernando II in 1178 meant that the couple’s sons had effectively become adopted children of the Leonese monarch.5 Hand-in-glove with the king, they gained prestige accordingly.6 In this respect, as in so many others, they were excelling at a changing game; many of the Castilian élite gravitated toward León in the later twelfth century, as the radius of noble activity increased.7 The rotation of tenancies was exceptionally pronounced in León, where these positions were becoming more widely used as instruments of royal authority.8 To ﬁnd a tenancy lasting more than a few years is unusual.9 In general, the delegation of power embodied in the Leonese system of tenancies was carefully controlled by the monarchy, and there was markedly less continuity in tenancies than in the nonjurisdictional ofﬁces of alférez and mayordomo. But for the Laras, this was extremely good news. As Gonzalo Núñez (d. 1225) discovered to his advantage, personal access meant political reward;10 he was showered with tenancies out of all proportion to the family’s patrimonies in the kingdom.11 He made far more appearances at the court of León than his brothers, was at his stepfather’s side as early as the spring of 1180, and repeatedly surfaces in Leonese documentation in the following years.12 In the mid-1180s, his uncle Pedro Manrique brieﬂy joined him.13 Gonzalo then returned to Castile in the mid-1190s and was again almost entirely absent between 1200 and 1204, but he was back in León for most of the next decade.14 Accordingly, his tenancies brought a degree of territorial power in Galicia and León that was unprecedented and unrepeated in the family’s history (see Map 9).15 As for Castile, the torch of courtly inﬂuence was carried ﬁrst by\n\n46\n\nSy m biosis\n\n9.

Gonzalo Núñez was more active in the kingdom of León, but was intermittently present at the Castilian court.20 Finally, Álvaro Núñez (d. 1218), the last of the brothers to arrive at court, would establish the ﬁrmest foothold of all. After 1196, he appeared almost continuously as either a witness to royal diplomas or as the royal alférez.21\n\nA Zenith and a Nadir\n\n47\n\nAs in earlier generations, it is hard to ﬁnd evidence that the Laras’ strength as landowners was great enough to have dictated this ascendancy, though like many other noble families of the twelfth century they were gradually expanding their territorial and jurisdictional authority. Their lands remained fragmented, because patterns of partible inheritance were still strong.22 The evidence for patrimony is strongest for the eldest brother, Fernando Núñez (see Map 10). Fernando had properties to the east of Santander, which he granted to the order of Santiago with the castle of Carabanchel.23 He also had interests in Berlanga de Duero.24 Many of his other properties seem to have been concentrated within a ﬁfty-mile radius of Burgos, a fact that may reﬂect a concerted effort to consolidate territorial strength there.25 Even so, much of the relevant evidence is indirect. For instance, his daughters Sancha and Teresa would make a large number of land sales to the bishopric of Burgos in the 1240s;26 and his wife likewise made a substantial grant of property near Burgos (property that may also have belonged to her husband) to the cathedral.27 Fernando’s son Álvaro Fernández also alienated property in this region, granting a church in Boadilla del Camino to the bishop of Palencia.28 There is less evidence of patrimony for the two younger brothers, Álvaro and Gonzalo Núñez. In addition to some shared properties—the result of partible inheritance— in the upper Ebro valley and in Tamariz, Álvaro Núñez (Map 11) held the town of Alhambra; Carcedo de Bureba;29 Ribarredonda (possibly the place of that name just south of Medinaceli);30 and Castroverde de Campos.31 Gonzalo’s properties included Grañón, Santibáñez de Ecla, Osorno, and some land in Cisneros.32 Turning brieﬂy to a different branch of the family, the patrimony of Nuño Sánchez was more impressive. Even before he acquired the viscounties of Fenollet and Perapertusa (in 1226), he had the counties of Roussillon, Cerdaña, Conﬂent, and Vallespir—a major patrimonial base.33 But like Pedro Manrique’s lordship of Narbonne, they had negligible importance for Castilian affairs. Nuño Sánchez had inherited Narbonne by 1192. He spent most of the rest of the year there, but evidently had no great interest in personal control of it: in 1194, he granted it to his eldest son, Aimerico.34 The history of Narbonne was henceforth almost entirely separate from the history of the Lara family. Although it was closer to the Castilian heartland than (for instance) Galicia, one has a sense that it was perceived almost as another world:\n\n48\n\nSy m biosis\n\n10.
