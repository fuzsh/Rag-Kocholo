        "text": "Mexican, c. 1750–1802\n\nSalazar was born in Mérida, Yucatan, Mexico, and studied at the Academy in Mexico City. He married Maria Antonia Magaña (d. 1793). They bore a daughter, Francisca de Salazar y Magaña, and a son, José, before moving to New Orleans in 1782. A third son, José Casiano, was born shortly after the family immigrated. Salazar's children assisted in the studio, and Francisca and José became artists. Salazar's home was destroyed during the fire of 1788, and the family was allowed to stay in a building on church grounds. In 1791, the Salazar family lived on St. Philip Street, a few blocks from St. Louis Cathedral.\n\nSalazar painted many of Colonial Louisiana's prominent citizens, figures associated with the government, the military, and the church. Prominent sitters include Dr. Joseph Montegut and his family, Don Almonaster y Rojas, Ignacio Balderas, and his wife, and Bishop Luis Ignatius Cardenas y Peñalver, He is not known to have painted in other cities in the U.S. before his death in 1802. Well-versed in the late Baroque style popular in Spanish colonies, Salazar was the first significant painter to work in New Orleans.\n\nThe Montegut Family\n\nJosé Francisco Xavier de Salazar y Mendoza, c. 1794–1800\n\nOil on canvas, 59 x 74 ½ inches\n\nLoan of Gustave Pitot, Louisiana State Museum 04944-04945\n\nThe Montegut Family is singular in its ambition and scope among early Louisiana paintings, comparable with the best painting executed at the time in the U.S., in Philadelphia or New York, such as John Smibert's The Bermuda Group (1728–1739; Yale University Art Museum) or Charles Willson Peale's Benjamin and Eleanor Ridgely Laming (1788; National Gallery of Art). Not until the mid-nineteenth century did Louisiana artists such as John Antrobus and Johann Wilhelm Rümpler again conceive such complex, symbolic portrait groups.\n\nDr. Joseph Montegut typified the political adaptability of members of the Colonial elite. Born in Armagnac, France, he came to New Orleans in 1769 and served as Surgeon Major of the Spanish Colonial Army. In 1794, he became Chief Surgeon of Charity Hospital. Although of advanced age, Montegut commanded marines aboard the American sloop Carolina during the Battle of New Orleans. Montegut was prominent in Masonic circles, indicated by the golden triangle that he displays in the proper right hand.\n\nSeated on the right is Dr. Joseph Montegut and his wife, François DeLise Dupart (1774–1836), with their daughter Aimee (b. 1794). Other children of the union are, moving left, Felicié Solidelle (b. 1783), later wife of Louis Philippe de Roffignac, Mayor of New Orleans from 1820–1828; Maria Manon (b. 1778) later married Jean Batiste de Neurisse; François Ramon Joseph (b. 1780), later State Treasurer under Governor William C. C. Claiborne; and Catherine Innocencia (b. 1790/1791). Mrs. Montegut's aunt, François DeLise, was painted posthumously, suggestive of a different hand—possibly Salazar's daughter, Francisca.\n\nThe composition suggests that the musicale grouping of children and portrait of the Dr. and Mrs. Montegut were conceived separately and spliced together. The division runs along the shaded area of the central column, supported by evidence of a seam.\n\nIgnacio de Balderes\n\nAttributed to José Francisco Xavier de Salazar y Mendoza, c. 1790\n\nOil on canvas, 45 1/2 x 33 1/2 inches\n\nGift of Mr. Harvey Truxillo, Louisiana State Museum M141.2\n\nBorn in Salamanca, Spain, in 1757, Balderes entered military service as a private at the age of thirteen. He was sent to West Florida to work as a surveyor and rose through the ranks. As a sergeant in 1779, he earned distinction by capturing a post at Pass Manchac during the Battle of Galvez-Town. Balderes was knighted by the king of Spain and given a large land grant near Pensacola.\n\nIn the early 1790s, Balderes was a Sub-Lieutenant of the Grenadiers, Second Battalion of the Regiment of Louisiana, and commander at Balize, an outpost guarding the mouth of the Mississippi River. The single epaulette—which is in the Museum's collection—indicates his rank as a lieutenant. Balderes was respected for his zeal and leadership. Francisco Bouligny, his commander, wrote \"I believe it is always fitting to provide officers of well-known courage, good conduct, assiduity and who are intelligent\" with promotion when he became adjutant-major of the Third Battalion in 1793. Balderes eventually reached the rank of captain in 1798 and died in 1815 at the age of fifty-eight.\n\nSenora de Balderes and Her Daughter\n\nAttributed to José Francisco Xavier de Salazar y Mendoza, c. 1790\n\nOil on canvas, 45 x 33 inches\n\nGift of Mr. Harvey Truxillo, Louisiana State Museum M141.1\n\nSenora de Balderes holds a single red rose, a Baroque-era symbol of procreation and maternal attentiveness. In both style and format, Salazar's style resembles portraits commissioned throughout the Spanish colonies in the late eighteenth century, especially the work of Puerto Rican artist José Campeche y Jordán (1751–1809) and Mexican artist Joseph Mariano Lara (fl. 1760–1790).\n\nCensus records indicate that the Balderes family lived on Royal Street in 1791. At the time, New Orleans had about 5,000 residents.\n\nBishop Luis Ignatius Cardenas y Peñalver\n\nJosé Francisco Xavier de Salazar y Mendoza, c. 1801\n\nOil on canvas, 85 x 52 inches\n\nGift of Notre Dame University, Louisiana State Museum 1955.008.1\n\nPeñalver was ordained as a priest in 1771, and briefly served as a bishop in his native Havana before being elected the first bishop of the Diocese of Louisiana in 1793. Peñalver administered the church during a period of great expansion but left for what he described as \"another less burdensome\" diocese in Guatemala in 1801.\n\nPhotograph of Bishop Cardenas y Penalver\n\nFrancisca Salazar (c. 1780–1802), 1802\n\nOil on canvas, 82 ½ x 50 ¾ inches\n\nFormer Loan of the Archdiocese of New Orleans, EL03.1970.1\n\nDestroyed in the Cabildo Fire of 1989, this was the only identified painting by Francisca. According to records at the Old Ursuline Convent, the Church paid her 100 pesos for this portrait on April 15, 1803, after the bishop had left Louisiana. These photographs, taken about 1950, document the painting in the Cabildo.\n\nAugustin Guillaume Chevalier de Macarty\n\nAttributed to José Francisco Xavier de Salazar y Mendoza,\n\nc. 1785\n\nOil on canvas, 23 3/4 x 17 1/2 inches\n\nLouisiana State Museum 08268A.01\n\nAssigning authorship to Salazar is complicated by large areas of disfiguring over-paint applied by heavy-handed restorers over many decades.\n\nMadame Chevalier de Macarty (née Jeanne Marie Chavin)\n\nAttributed to José Francisco Xavier de Salazar y Mendoza, c. 1785\n\nOil on canvas, 24 x 17 3/4 inches\n\nLouisiana State Museum 08268A.02\n\nJeanne Marie Chauvin de Lery, daughter of Jacques Chauvin and Jeanne Dauville, was baptized on October 5, 1744. She married Ignace Broutin (1737–1764), but he died in France soon after the marriage. Her union with Augustin Guillaume Macarty (1745–1793), begun on January 11, 1773, bore two sons: Augustin Francois (1774–1844) and Juan (b. 1776). Augustin served as mayor of New Orleans from 1815–1820. She may have died during childbirth.\n\nThe painting appears to have been based on a miniature. Madame Macarty wears a blue dress with white ruffled trim on the collar and sleeves—a color combination often worn by women in Colonial and early National periods. Pearls trim the dress as well. She has white and black feathers in her hair and crystal earrings. The painting has been over-restored.\n\nLieutenant Michel Dragon\n\nAttributed to F. Godefroid (fl. 1807–1820), or School of Jose Francisco Xavier de Salazar y Mendoza, c. 1810\n\nOil on canvas, 39 1/2 x 31 5/16 inches\n\nGift of John T. Block, Louisiana State Museum 05748-05749\n\nMichel Dragon (1739–1821) was a native of Athens, Greece. He immigrated to New Orleans about 1760 as a soldier in the French Colonial Army. In 1764, as Spain assumed control of the Louisiana Territory, Dragon received a commission in the Spanish militia. After having distinguished himself at Pensacola with Bernardo de Galvez, Dragon attained the rank of second lieutenant and received a Royal Appointment in 1792.\n\nMarianne Celeste Dragon (or Dracos)\n\nAttributed to Jose Francisco Xavier de Salazar y Mendoza, c. 1795\n\nOil on canvas, 37 1/4 x 30 1/4 in. (94.6 x 76.8 cm)\n\nGift of John T. Block, Louisiana State Museum 05750\n\nMarianne Dragon (1777–1856) was the daughter of Michael Dragon and Marianne Françoise Chauvin de Beaulieu de Montplaisir (1755–1822), a Creole. She married André Dimitry of New Orleans in 1799 and bore him ten children. Her portrait is more complex and interesting than that of her father.\n\nMarianne is shown seated in a Windsor chair near a Louis XVI desk. Her aqua-colored dress with laced bodice and cuffs, pearl necklace and double strand of pearls in her hair, and gold hoop earrings bespeak wealth, privilege, and eligibility for marriage. The flowers are symbolic of her role as a young woman capable of bearing children. Marianne's vaguely foreign costume suggests her exotic heritage, as well as her growing interest in escapism and pastoral fantasies, reflected in literature and poetry of the era.\n\nCaptain Don Pedro George Rousseau\n\nSchool of Jose Francisco Xavier de Salazar y Mendoza, c. 1785–1798\n\nOil on canvas, 35 x 25 in. (88.9 x 63.5 cm)\n\nLoan of the Louisiana Historical Society, Louisiana State Museum 00435\n\nRousseau was born in France and served in the Continental Navy during the Revolutionary War. He also was with Governor Gálvez against the British during the Siege of Pensacola and \"the conquest of Movila\" (Mobile). Rousseau led the boarding party aboard USS Morris on September 10, 1779, that captured the English sloop West Florida on Lake Pontchartrain. From his flagship Galveston, he later served as \"commandant of the galleys of the Mississippi.\"\n\nIn 1800, now a lieutenant-colonel, he petitioned King Juan Carlos for support as the French assumed control of Louisiana, noting his \"deplorable situation...in his advanced age surrounded by ten children.\""
