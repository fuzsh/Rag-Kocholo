        "text": "\"If there is victory in overcoming the enemy, there is a greater one when man defeats himself.\" General José de San Martín\n\nOur Father of the Nation passed to immortality surrounded by his loved ones in Boulogne-Sur-Mer, France on August 17, 1850.\n\nWithout a doubt, General José Francisco de San Martin and Matorras is one of the most recognized Latin American heroes in the world. His remains were repatriated to Argentina in 1880 and they rest in the Chapel of Our Lady of Peace, located in the Cathedral of the City of Buenos Aires.\n\nIn our country he is recognized as the Father of the Nation. In Peru, he is remembered as its Liberator, with the titles of Founder of the Freedom of Peru, Founder of the Republic and Generalissimo of Arms. In Chile, his army has distinguished him with the rank of Captain General.\n\nBut beyond his liberating feat, San Martín is a fundamental person in the construction of our national identity and the spirit of freedom of our people.\n\nFrom his famous figure and heroic behavior, that great narrative that he explains to us as a country is built. Therefore, to remember his life from a new anniversary of his death is to remember that story that we heard in the school events of our childhood, that great narrative that shaped us as a community and that we must think and reconsider on our way to a just homeland. , free and sovereign.\n\n«I wish my heart was deposited in Buenos Aires«, Was one of the last orders of General San Martín before his death."
