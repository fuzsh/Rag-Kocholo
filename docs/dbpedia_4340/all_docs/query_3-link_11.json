Doña Margarita (Report of the funeral that his excellency Don Juan de Mendoza y Luna, marquis of Montesclaros, viceroy of Peru, held in Honor of the Death of Our Lady Queen Margarita) was published in Lima, Peru, in 1613. The book is an account of the memorial services organized in Lima by the viceroy of Peru to mark the death, the previous year, of Margaret of Austria (1584-1611), the wife of King Phillip III and queen of Spain from 1599 until her death. The first printing press in South America was established in Lima by Antonio Ricardo (circa 1540-1606), an Italian who had worked for a time as a printer with the Jesuits in Mexico City. This book is part of a collection of 39 first editions in the National Library of Peru, produced at the press between 1584 and 1619. The collection was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2013. In Latin, Spanish, and several Amerindian languages, these books are an important part of the record of the encounter between two worlds: the Amerindian civilization of the Incas and the European culture represented by the Spanish conquistadors. They are important sources for the study of the dissemination of ideas in the Spanish Empire, including the evangelization process and the diffusion of Catholicism on the one hand and the debate over the indigenous peoples and their condition as human beings on the other. Several of the books provide insights into the political, cultural, and social organization of the vanquished Inca civilization, as well as a record of the Quechua and Aymara languages spoken by the Incas.",
