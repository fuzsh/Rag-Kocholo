        "text": "Coinage of the Viceroyalty of El Perú—an Overview\n\nFreeman Craig, Jr.\n\nCoinage of the Americas Conference at the American Numismatic Society, New York City\n\n© The American Numismatic Society, 1989\n\nThe Viceroyalty of El Perú struck its first coins in Lima's recently built mint in September 1568, three-quarters of a century after Columbus \"discovered\" the Americas, and a bit more than three decades after Pizarro overthrew the Inca Empire and founded the city of Lima (1535). The capital of the future Viceroyalty of Peru was officially established on January 6, the day of the Star of the Magi that guided the three kings of Catholic tradition to Bethlehem. Hence Lima's title, \"City of the Kings,\" and the use of one or more stars to symbolize the city.\n\nA review of the royal decrees relating to money is essential to understand the coinage of El Perú. A fundamental monetary decree by the Catholic Kings Ferdinand and Isabella in 1479, established weights and finenesses as well as fractional components of the real and escudo systems. El Perú's coinage for nearly two centuries was produced under that decree as amended by Charles I (Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire) in 1537. The value of gold to silver was fixed at 11.5 to 1. Silver was to be of .93 purity, with a weight per 8 reales of 27.47 g.1 The gold coinage was to be of 22 carats (22/24 pure) or .92 fineness; the 8-escudo piece would weigh 27.06 g.\n\nMexico and Santo Domingo began striking their own silver coinage soon after Charles's reform. Both these mints issued coins of high quality, particularly compared to the irregular shape of most \"cob\" coins produced a century or two later. The Mexican pieces had become popular in world trading centers by 1550. Both mints initially used designs incorporating the legendary Pillars of Hercules; the Straits of Gibraltar were, for the ancients, the end of the world. Prominent in the field is the Latin phrase chosen by Charles V as his watchword, PLUS ULTRA (more beyond), to signify Spain 's claim to the New World beyond Gibraltar.\n\nMeanwhile, far to the south of Mexico , towns which would rapidly gain in importance were being founded: after Lima (1535) came Santa Fe de Bogotá (1537), Popayán (1538), Santiago (1541), and Potosí (1546). To help \"civilize\" South America and exploit its human and mineral resources, the Spanish throne established the new Viceroyalty of El Perú in 1544. It included Panama and all of Spanish South America except a small northern area, known as Tierra Firme, in today's Venezuela (fig. 1).\n\nJust one year later, in 1545, an Indian made a discovery that changed the monetary and economic history of the world: an incredible mountain of silver situated at Potosí. This Cerro Rico de Potosí rose about 2,400 feet above the surrounding land and proved to contain ore with an unusually high silver content. Word spread quickly to other colonial towns and to Spain itself. Potosí's remoteness and its elevation of about 2.5 miles above sea level could not deter the soldiers of fortune who flocked to the site of this bonanza.\n\n1. Adapted from C.L. and J.V. Lombardi, Latin American History, A Teaching Atlas (Madison, WI, 1983)\n\nBy 1548 the city, founded two years earlier by Juan de Villarroel and other Spaniards, had an estimated 2,500 houses and 14,000 residents. The discovery of a second nearby mountain of silver—smaller but nonetheless also readily exploited—accelerated the city's growth to a bustling and affluent population of more than 160,000 in 25 years. The torrent of precious metal pouring forth from Potosí catapulted El Perú into prominence and fostered its rapid development.\n\nThe export of silver bullion in the form of ingots soon proved unsatisfactory to the Spanish throne, intent as it was on securing its full quinto, or royal fifth, demanded of all mining and refining concessions. Despite various laws intended to deter tax evasion—including the death penalty for smugglers—a great deal of silver escaped the government's claim. By 1551, the highest local authorities, headquartered in the capital city of Lima, requested permission to establish a mint. Spain 's monarchs were too busy with other problems to act until 1565. The decree of that year specified the exact style of coins to be struck, a style very similar to Mexico 's second issue of pillars-and-waves, then still in production. The king's name (by now Philip II) was to be boldly indicated (not, as in Mexico , those of the deceased Charles I and his mother Johanna), along with a prominent \"P\" for Peru (fig. 2).\n\n2. Lima. 1 real, 1568–70\n\nUpon receiving Philip II's ordinance, the authorities in Lima immediately set about constructing a mint. When the proper working materials and letter punches arrived from Spain , the mint began to produce coins, even though royal permission to strike them had not yet been received. Within months an entire series of silver coinage was issued. These coins—in the denominations of 8, 4, 2, 1, 1/2, and 1/4 reales—were produced in relatively large quantities. However, a royal decree of March 8, 1570, soon mandated a completely different style of coinage. The \"early series\" pieces were probably not actually called in and recoined, for too many of them survive (about 250 examples of the combined six denominations) for that to seem likely.\n\nIn any event, these pieces were the first coins struck in South America and are therefore of special significance. Virtually every one known is of high quality. This can be attributed to the considerable skills of Alonso de Rincón, who also had been the first assayer at the Mexico City mint. These very first issues are at least equal in workmanship to any other standard-issue cobs produced elsewhere in colonial South America .\n\nThis first series of coinage for El Perú includes one item of particular significance for numismatists, historians, and coin collectors. The largest denomination in the set represents the first silver \"crown\" (or silver dollar) of the Americas. If one remembers that the earliest 8-real pieces struck in Mexico could not have been made before 1573, it is clear that this pillar-style cob is the prototype for the milled pillar 8 reales issued in the eighteenth century. Since Spanish milled dollars are usually acknowledged as the ultimate trade dollars in modern world history, this earliest cob 8-real piece stands out as the ancestor of them all. Its extreme rarity makes this one of the most, if not the most, desirable silver coin minted in Spanish America.\n\nAssayers were the individuals who guaranteed that the struck coins and cast bars were of both legal weight and fineness. Assayers were compensated for their work by retaining a small portion of the precious metal whose processing took place under their supervision. Following a tradition of more than a thousand years in parts of Europe , these highly desirable positions were purchased from the throne for significant sums. Due to the enormous quantity of silver located near the Potosí mint, the lucrative post of assayer there sold for 50,000 ducats in an auction near the end of the sixteenth century. This practice continued until the throne reclaimed assaying rights for itself in its decree of July 14, 1732.\n\nAssayers were required to display their initial(s) on each coin in order that the authorities could determine who was responsible if debased or underweight pieces came to light. Therefore the time period of any given assayer, and the relationships of various assayers' symbols to one another, can be determined with considerable accuracy as long as official mint records are available and the assayer's initial(s) are clear on each coin. Unfortunately, neither tool is available for analyzing many cobs. However, with an adequate sample of sufficiently high-quality coins available for study, a careful researcher can deduce their order and relationship. When correlated with the mint and royal records which do survive, the coinage will assume a degree of order.\n\nAlonso de Rincón was cited earlier as the first assayer in both Mexico and Lima. Ironically, despite some explicit documentation from the eras when each mint opened, and despite the bold letter \"R\" on most of these early coins, numismatists have disagreed for a century as to which of two cousins was the first assayer at these mints. Alonso de Rincón is named in classic texts, but Robert Nesmith attempted to prove that Francisco de Rincón actually signed the coins. Ray Byrne claimed that one of the Rincóns was the first assayer in Potosí, but Ernesto Sellschopp rejected that contention. However the question is ultimately resolved,2 the Rincón legacy will remain integral to the mint history of El Perú (fig. 3).\n\n3. Potosí. 4 reales, 1574–77.\n\nIn keeping with the decree of March 8, 1570, cited earlier, all early cobs of El Perú subsequent to the Rincón pillar series bore the Hapsburg arms on the obverse and a cross with castles and lions quartered on the reverse. New dies of this style arrived in Lima in 1572, but the city was too distant from the mines in Potosí to serve as the only mint of the Viceroyalty. Consequently a second mint was opened about December 1573, in the administrative center of La Plata, still a difficult 110-mile trek on primitive roads from Potosí. By the edict of March 3, 1574, La Plata's mint was closed and its tools transferred to Potosí. This third mint in El Perú began operations by 1575 at the latest. Meanwhile, government documents establish that in Lima, Diego de la Torre was responsible for stylistically excellent silver cobs in all denominations between September of 1577 and sometime in 1588 (fig. 4). Nearly all his designs include a star mint mark representing the earlier-mentioned star of the Magi and thus identifying Lima as their city of origin within the Viceroyalty. The problem for numismatists is that very little reliable additional information from the 1570s has been published.\n\nLima's early coinage was inconsequential compared to that of Potosí, except for the early-style Rincón and later-style Diego de la Torre issues. La Plata was open for a few months at the most; moreover, it was beset by difficulties from the start; it could not have produced many coins. However, the Potosí mint was important from its inception and continued to be so long after the end of Spanish colonial rule.\n\n4. Lima. 8 reales, 1577–88.\n\n(ANS, on loan from The Hispanic Society of America )\n\nPotosí was the world's most important source of silver coinage for more than a century. Its enormous production was largely responsible for the change in the ratio of gold to silver from 11.5:1 to 16:1 as established by a royal decree in 1620. The problems involved in ascertaining the \"correct\" ratio were formidable, and will be mentioned again in connection with the decrees of 1728 and 1750.\n\nPotosí's assayer B coinage was interrupted by that of assayer A for a few years near 1591 and ended about 1610, when a new assayer R took office. He was soon displaced by assayer Q, who held the office for only a short period. It was at the time of these last two assayers that a royal inquiry into the proliferation of debased coinage from Potosí was launched. In April 1617, the viceroy acknowledged that debasement had occurred. Probably for this reason the then-active assayer M was required to include the current date in the legends of his coins, beginning sometime that same year. M's earliest issues were of the \"pre-dated\" cob style; and although his dated pieces were as crude as those that preceded them, doubtful pieces can be dated by comparing them with the substantial corpus of similar, dated coins surviving. It is worth noting that M's early production was the last important issue of Spanish colonial coinage to be struck without a date (Mexico dated its coins from 1607 on).\n\nEarly in the period of dated Potosí cobs another mint was authorized in El Perú. In 1620, Captain Alonso Turrillo de Yebra obtained permission to open a mint and a subsidiary \"oficina\" in the towns of Santa Fe de Bogotá and Cartagena in the Captaincy-General of Nuevo Reino de Granada, later to become the Viceroyalty of New Granada. The Bogotá mint operated at least until 1789, producing primarily gold coins and a few silver pieces, with an extremely small output of silver after its first fifty years. Royal edicts, pertinent correspondence, mint records reported by Dr. A.M. Barriga Villalba, and comparative analysis of available specimens all demonstrate that coins were also minted in Cartagena.3\n\n5. Nuevo Reino. 2 escudos, 1630.\n\n(ANS, on loan from The Hispanic Society of America )\n\nDetermining the logical production sequence of Nuevo Reino coinage is more difficult than for the undated Potosí era. Even though the dies for the Nuevo Reino pieces were dated, the typical Bogotá coin planchets are so irregular that low-denomination specimens with full dates and legends are very scarce. In addition, the standard identification data required by royal decree display apparently whimsical variations.\n\nEqual in significance to Lima's issue of the first New World silver dollar in 1568 was Colombia's production of the Americas' first gold coin in 1622. Salvage of the shipwrecked Atocha galleon has made several new specimens available. It is worth noting that the shield on the obverse of the 1630 2-escudo coin (fig. 5) has four fleurs-delis instead of the standard castles-and-lions quartered on silver coinage and the ordinal is that of Philip III, who died years before the coin was issued. This general style of gold cob coinage was minted for another 30 years.\n\nBy the ascension of Philip IV , the dated Potosí coins were beginning to decay in quality of workmanship and would soon be debased on a scale even greater than in the 1610-17 period. By 1620, many were apparently produced with neither date nor assayer symbol visible.\n\nIt was during this era that Potosí produced the first of a remarkable series of well-executed cobs struck on broader flans and with more complete legends and design details than had the standard pieces (fig. 6). The first of these is dated 1630. Numismatists generally regard these as genuine coins of the various eras and assume that they were struck for reasons similar to those that inspired the presentation cinquentines (coins of 50 reales) produced in Spain earlier in the seventeenth century. Called \"royals\" or \"round presentation coins,\" they are of correct weight and were produced by at least three mints (Potosí, Mexico beginning just before 1607, and Lima beginning in 1684). Whatever their official status and function, these often magnificent items are the apex of craftsmanship for each mint in a given era. The survival of several with Guatemalan republican counterstamps on coins still circulating around 1850 demonstrates their acceptance as coin of the realm even that late.\n\n6. Potosí. 8 reales, 1650.\n\n(ANS, on loan from The Hispanic Society of America )\n\nGiven the massive quantities of silver coin produced at Potosí (Burzio estimates that by 1629 a million 8-real pieces had been struck there, and that another 2,600,000 pesos in the smaller denominations were struck by 1650), the potential profit from debasement of the coins was high indeed. Quality deteriorated noticeably between 1631 and 1648, to the point where pieces with clear dates or assayer initials are uncommon. This was probably not accidental, for the assayers were later proven to have defrauded the crown of millions of reales in silver. In 1648, an assay in Spain determined that some Potosí issues were more than half copper, and a royal letter to the relevant official, the president of the Audiencia de Charcas, demanded an explanation. His inquiry exposed the fraud, which had been underway in one degree or another for at least four decades. One assayer, Filipe Ramirez de Arellano, was executed as an example. The numismatic echo of this inquiry was the subsequent counterstamping of Potosí cobs issued in the late 1640s, authorizing them to circulate at less than their face value. This October 1650 decree was augmented by one of February 17, 1651, which mandated the retirement of all Potosí cobs of the Hapsburg shield type and the initiation of a new type incorporating the columns of Hercules, much in the tradition of the original 1568 issues of Lima (fig. 7). The transition to this \"tic-tac-toe\" reverse design occurred in six or seven stages during 1652. Collectors have found it possible to assemble royal presentation pieces representing the several steps in this rapid development, and even the regular-issue examples are generally of much finer quality than cobs produced earlier in the century.\n\n7. Potosí. 8 reales, 1652.\n\nThe designs of Nuevo Reino's coins also changed during these same few months. The new coinage of Potosí was inadequate to satisfy the demand for smaller denominations throughout El Perú, and the Colombian mints were unable to supplement Potosí's output significantly. In fact, Cartagena struck its final coins around 1655 and Bogotá silver after 1669 is known in quantities of no more than three or four specimens per year.\n\nAs a result of the small-change shortfall, Lima had requested permission to reopen its mint, closed since 1589. Convinced of the real need to do so, the local authorities produced a unique style of coinage that featured the star of the Magi. The very small production of these pieces evolved through at least three stages in the period 1659-60 before authorities in Potosí convinced the king to deny Lima's petition. These unofficial issues did circulate (one is known with the Guatemala counterstamp of around 1850; another with a Dutch countermark), and they occupy a unique place in the history of El Perú's coinage.\n\nPotosí continued to produce huge quantities of new cobs, for the old Hapsburg-shield types were creating havoc in trade; as many as fourteen reales in face value were needed to obtain goods worth eight reales in the new pillars-and-waves style coins. For more than two decades after the coronation of Charles II in 1665, the Potosí pieces maintained a level of quality not to be regained in the subsequent production of cobs.\n\nThe Lima mint, authorized to reopen in 1684, proceeded to strike a fine run of all silver denominations, including some royals. Both Lima and Potosí produced high-quality pieces until around 1696. At that time, Lima was authorized to issue gold cobs of a specific, unique design. The 1-escudo coin varied from established patterns even more than the larger denominations (fig. 8). One searches in vain for the familiar lions and castles quartered, pillars, or a Hapsburg shield. However, for unknown reasons the silver coinage of both mints again began to deteriorate in quality. Within a short period it had decayed to levels reminiscent of the 1640-50 debacle.\n\n8. Lima. 1 escudo, 1733.\n\nIn 1698, a mint was opened briefly in Cuzco; it produced a few small gold coins during that year only. Why it was opened and the reasons for its closing so soon have yet to be adequately explained.\n\nIn this era, near the demise of the last Hapsburg king, Charles II, and the coronation of the first Bourbon monarch, Philip V , Potosí issued a few presentation pieces cut in the mint to a shape representing a pomegranate, or perhaps a heart, as is more popularly assumed. The earliest known of these is a 2-real Potosí coin of 1691; the earliest known 8-real coin of the same configuration is dated 1704. This \"heart-shaped crown\" is rumored to have been struck to honor the new Bourbon king once news of his coronation reached Potosí. Two similarly cut examples are known to have been in the Vidal Quadras and Enrique Peña collections.\n\nExcept for Lima's gold pieces, the eighteenth century witnessed production of inferior coinage in all three mints of El Perú. Even Nuevo Reino gold was crude; some 2-escudo coins of the period were issued with neither mint mark nor assayer letters and the royal presentation pieces of Potosí were of significantly lower quality than those of a quarter-century earlier. The occasional \"heart-shaped\" pieces of Potosí and the very scarce royal strikes of Lima were of phenomenally better quality than the rest of the silver issues. In a reprise of the situations of half a century and a century earlier, debased cobs with little legible detail became commonplace.\n\nIn 1724 Philip abdicated in favor of his young son Luis I, who died just months later. However, word of the new king's ascension had already been sent to the colonial mints; at least three of them (Potosí, Lima, and Mexico ) issued coinage in Luis's name (fig. 9). The known Lima issues of 8 escudos and 1/2 real dated 1725 in- clude his name or monogram. The same is true of all Potosí coinage of 1725, 1726, and 1727 on which the king's name is even partially readable. Superior-quality pieces featuring the young king's name are in great demand. Potosí issued both royal presentation pieces and even heart-shaped 8- and 4-real coins during this brief period.\n\n9. Lima. 8 escudos, 1724.\n\nBefore and after Luis's brief reign, the Spanish crown again took note of a decline in quality and bullion fineness of the various colonial cobs. After 160 years of corruption in the colonial mints and the concommitant decay in the quality of their production, it seemed essential to bring modern technology to the minting facilities. Decrees of 1709 and thereafter culminated in important laws of 1728 and 1730 that mandated fundamental modifications in the way coins were produced in Hispanic America . The value of gold was fixed at sixteen times that of silver. For the first time the colonial 8 escudos and 8 reales were to be of equal weight. Cobs already in circulation were recognized as frequently underweight and/or of deficient fineness; in Spain their circulating value would be based on their weight rather than on their nominal denomination.\n\nImportant for numismatists—and for the worldwide economic viability of the colonial monies—is that the latter two decrees initiated production of a machine-made, round coinage with a corded edge. The resulting superb design was that of the now-famous \"milled pillar dollar\" and its fractions, all noticeably indebted to the first coinage of El Perú in 1568. The Madrid mint produced a pattern 8-real piece dated 1729 that was sent to Mexico City. By 1732 the mint there issued some silver coins of this design as well as the first portrait, or bust, milled gold of the Americas.\n\nThe coinage of El Perú no longer included that of Nuevo Reino after 1739, when the Viceroyalty of Nueva Granada was definitely separated from that of El Perú (fig. 10). A mint was authorized for Popayán in 1729, but its first coinage was not struck until 1758.\n\nThree years before the accession of Ferdinand VI in 1746, a mint was authorized for Santiago de Chile under the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalty of El Perú (fig. 11). The new mint machinery was sent there, and the first bust gold was struck in Ferdinand's name in December 1749, bearing the date 1750.\n\n10. Adapted from C.L. and J. V. Lombardi, Latin American History, A Teaching Atlas (Madison, WI, 1983)\n\nSantiago's silver coinage of the corded-edge pillar design began in 1751, but the quantities produced were tiny: the mint was important only for its gold coins. From a current numismatic viewpoint, those earlier Santiago pillar 8 reales are among the most desirable of all coinage ever produced in El Perú. Curiously, the very rare 8 reales of Ferdinand VI was the only colonial silver coin that fully spelled out Ferdinand's name. Lima produced its first corded-edge gold coins in the same year that Santiago struck its first silver of that type (fig. 12). Apparently Ferdinand was satisfied with the new style of Mexican coinage, which had already gained international favor for its careful adherence to high standards of weight and fineness. Lima's coinage during the two decades when only Mexico City was striking the milled pillar design sank to an abysmal level. Potosí's issues were not of good quality, but they were far better than those of Lima. Therefore Lima's new pillar coinage was soon acclaimed and was in great demand throughout El Perú (fig. 13). Although many of the 8-real pieces were exported to Spain , Europe , North America, and the Orient, most of the smaller-denomination coins remained in local circulation. It is for this reason that most pieces between 1/2 real and 4 reales are found in worn or holed condition.\n\n11. Santiago. 8 escudos, 1751.\n\n12. Lima. 4 escudos, 1751.\n\nSpain had inadvertently guaranteed the desirability of these new pillar coins by its decrees of 1728 and 1750 that set the gold to silver ratio at 16:1. Worldwide, the then-prevailing ration was between 15.03 and 15.20:1. Thus merchants were happy to send gold coins to Spain in exchange for the undervalued silver. This error by Spanish authorities plagued them for the next half century and contributed significantly to Spain 's economic decline. This made the pillar 8 reales, and later the bust 8 reales, circulate internationally, contributing to the pieces being saved by collectors at the time of issue. As a result, high-quality examples of many milled pillar 8 reales are fairly common even today, and the quality of these crowns is much higher than that of surviving minor denominations.\n\n13. Lima. 8 reales, 1756.\n\nThe successes in Mexico and Lima prompted the throne to authorize the issue of the new-style pillar coins in Guatemala and to order construction of a new mint in Potosí. It was obvious that the old Potosí mint, with its antiquated equipment, had outlived its usefulness. Still, cobs poured forth from that mint for 24 years after the other mints ceased striking them. The reign of Charles III , whose coins were issued over nearly three decades beginning in 1760, had a baleful influence on monetary policy: decrees during these years further contributed to the decline of Spain 's economy and that of Potosí, both of which had been on the wane since around the turn of the century. Most of the Cerro Rico's easily accessible silver had been depleted and the city's population had declined by 85% from its peak two centuries earlier. In 1766, four new minting machines arrived, but local problems and fraud delayed operations for several years. Milled pillar coins were produced from 1767 through 1770, but cob production was at least as great despite its wretched quality.\n\nMounting economic problems made the Spanish authorities search for easy solutions. By a decree of 1771, and by secret letters to the viceroys in 1772, the fineness of colonial gold was lowered to .90103; that of silver was reduced to .90278. In 1771, dies and pat- tern strikes using a standardized bust portrait of the monarch for both gold and silver emissions were sent to all the colonial mints. In 1772, production of these bust types (in the new fineness) became law (fig. 14). By this law all cobs were to be withdrawn and remelted. Their monetary standing had suffered greatly thanks to the worldwide awareness of their debased composition. In November 1772, the crown forbade South American mints to ship coins of the 1/2-, 1-, and 2-real denominations to Spain : these smaller coins were vital to New World commerce. In 1773, a corollary to that edict ordered the mints to increase production of the small denominations. This explains why pieces of the first decade of the bust type are so much more common than those of the final decade of the pillars-and-shield type silver. These decrees brought cob production and pillars-and-shield coinage to an end. The final cobs were struck in Potosí shortly before the old mint was closed on July 31, 1773. Ironically, the final pillar-and-shield coinage of any mint had ended in Lima more than a year earlier. Thus the cob issues outlasted the superb corded-edge, pillar-and-shield pieces, whose creation had been authorized in order to displace cobs entirely. Numismatists and historians can enjoy the anomaly of a three-piece silver coin set that might include a 1772 bust coin struck in Mexico , which was produced slightly before a 1772 pillar-and-shield coin of Lima, with both of them preceding a Potosí 1773 cob by quite a few months. Not exactly the typical cob-pillar-bust order familiar to most collectors!\n\n14. Lima. 8 reales, 1772.\n\nIn 1776, Potosí and its mint were transferred to the jurisdiction of the newly created Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata. This political restructuring greatly diminished the prominence of El Perú as a producer of silver coinage, but not of gold (Potosí was not authorized to strike gold prior to 1777). However, El Perú was in need of silver coinage for local use, and its shortage now became critical: cob coinage was awkward for commercial transactions because its weight and fineness often varied. The new milled pillar silver was of such high quality that the workings of Gresham's law drove it out of local circulation due to the 1772 debasement and the inappropriate 16:1 silver-to-gold ratio.\n\nCounterfeiting intensified as the need for coinage increased. The royal solution, in early 1786, was to debase the colonial fineness further to .8958, and to reduce the weight of both the 8-escudo and 8-real pieces to 26.928 g. Again Gresham's law operated to decrease the supply of available coins as the 1772-85 silver and gold disappeared via export and the melting pot. By 1793, early in the reign of Charles IV , many low-denomination silver coins were actually only .85 fine. Merchants of the period complained that coins of the smallest denominations were particularly deficient, some of them being as little as .25 fine, a similar story to that of 1610, 1649, 1705, and 1728.\n\n15. Huancavelica 4-real \"proc\", 1790.\n\n(ANS, on loan from The Hispanic Society of America )\n\nUse of the king's bust on colonial coinage presented a problem for the mints when they learned Charles III had died and had been followed to the throne by Charles IV . Without knowing what the official royal portrait looked like, all the New World mints, including Lima and Santiago of El Perú, continued to use the bust of the old king, but with a legend acknowledging the new one. Proclamation coins of proper weight and fineness were issued in recognition of the new monarch's succession. Collecting such pieces is an interesting numismatic specialty and often serves as a source of historical information not otherwise available (fig. 15).\n\nOn April 30, 1789, Spanish authorities gave permission for the colonial mints to strike cuartillos (1/4-real pieces) to help alleviate the need for small change. Other than a recently discovered coin purported to be a Lima cob cuartillo of 1750 or 1751, these were the first cuartillos to be issued in Spanish America in almost a cen- tury. The mint in Santiago was still under the jurisdiction of the viceroy of El Perú despite the establishment of the new captaincy-general of Chile in 1778. Santiago was the first to issue these small pieces. Its 1790 coins of this denomination bore a tiny bust of Charles III , but the legend indicated the new king's name as Charles IIII. Lima produced its first bust cuartillo in 1792. In February 1793, a new design for this denomination was authorized and the resultant lion-and-castle pieces became standard at all the mints from 1796 forward. Unfortunately the coins' small size and limited production rendered them less useful than they should have been.\n\n16. Lima. 4 escudos, 1811.\n\nThe mints of El Perú—Lima and Santiago—produced a reasonably large quantity of both gold and silver coinage from this period until the end of Spanish control. Curiously, despite intensifying political problems, the quality of production remained rather high even during the final year of output.\n\nWhen Charles IV renounced the throne in 1808, his son Ferdinand VII succeeded him. Despite Napoleon's control of most of Spain , the colonial mints continued to acknowledge Ferdinand as king. As a result, both Lima and Santiago issued coins during 1808-11 that featured an imaginary bust of the new ruler (fig. 16).\n\nThe Spanish courts ruled in 1811 that the coins should bear the \"natural bust\" of the king rather than a military or adorned bust, and the mints modified their designs accordingly once the pewter patterns of 1811 arrived. As the wars for independence spread throughout South America , the Santiago and Lima mints produced increased quantities of coinage to underwrite the war effort. However, in 1817, Santiago was abandoned by the Spanish and the colonial dies fell into the hands of the new republican authorities. Minor-denomination coins of the colonial bust style were produced for several years (with the date of 1817, except for some cuartillos dated 1818 made from an amended 1816 die). The final colonial coin of Chile was cast around 1821 on the island of Chiloe (off the coast of southern Chile) using an 1822 Potosí 8 reales as its mold master. That island was abandoned by Antonio Quintanilla in January 1826, thus ending the coinage of El Perú in the southern part of the continent.\n\n17. Lima. 8 reales, 1822, with royalist 1824 counterstamp.\n\nFarther north, the Lima mint maintained relatively full production through 1821. Republicans captured it in 1822 but the royalists retook the city in 1823, at which time the colonial bust-style pieces were again coined. In 1823, some of the republican 8 reales of 1822-23 were overstruck with the colonial bust dies, and in 1824, a royal crown was countermarked on some of these same rebel coins (fig. 17). In 1824, the final colonial issue of Lima was struck; the only denomination is an 8 reales with a slightly different bust than had been used before. Viceroy Laserna, aided by General Canterac, moved some of the mint machinery from Lima to Cuzco once it became obvious that the Lima mint again would fall to the insurgents. A series of silver coins denominated 1, 2, and 8 reales was produced with the Cuzco monogram and with assayer letter T. Other pieces of this colonial design were coined in the 8-real and 8-escudo denominations, dated 1824, except with assayer letter G (fig. 18). The available documentation seems to indicate that they were probably not struck until after the republicans took control of the Cuzco mint.\n\n18. Cuzco. 8 reales, 1824.\n\nThere is a single known example of a 2 reales dated 1826; Medina claimed it was struck in El Perú by a fleeing royalist general, but its rarity and lack of a clear provenance precludes its designation as the final royal coinage in the north of El Perú. For now, that distinction must be accorded some of the Cuzco coins even though we cannot yet be certain which ones. Thus ended more than two and a half centuries of continuous coinage by Spanish colonial mints in El Perú. A year later the final coins struck anywhere in Spanish South America were minted in Potosí.\n\nThe gold and silver of El Perú had overwhelmed traditional assumptions about the wealth and power of nations and decisively changed world monetary and political history as a result. It has been estimated that enough silver was mined in Potosí to build a bridge from there to Madrid . Indeed a symbolic bridge did exist, but its wealth spread north as well as east. The legacy of El Perú lives on in the affluent nations of the modern world, none of which could have prospered as they have had not that mountain of silver and those rivers of gold poured forth to foreign lands.\n\nThe mineral wealth of El Perú made possible its lengthy and fascinating coinage series. These coins are our historical link—another kind of bridge—to that bygone time and society that fostered so much wealth and rapid economic growth for nearly three centuries. Without El Perú, the evolution of silver coinage would have been less dynamic throughout the world. This too is part of our debt to the coinage of the Viceroyalty of El Perú.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nThe weights and finenesses cited herein are rounded to two decimal places.\n\n2\n\nSee the articles by K.A.

Gordus\n\nCoinage of the Americas Conference at the American Numismatic Society, New York City\n\n© The American Numismatic Society, 1989\n\nIntroduction\n\nKnowing the fineness of a silver or gold coin can provide information that is very useful in various historical and numismatic studies. If the proclaimed legal standard is known, knowledge of the actual fineness of the coins can indicate the degree to which the standard was being followed by the various mints. If the legal standard is unknown, as is the case in many historical studies where adequate written records are unavailable, knowledge of the actual fineness of the coins can provide an indication of economic stresses on the society; wars and famines, for example, could be accompanied by coinage debasement. Variations in fineness among mints could indicate the degree of control exercised by the central government on the outlying mints.\n\nBesides the weight of a coin, the fineness is also an important property associated with the coin's intrinsic value. The fineness as well as the weight of silver or gold coins are properties that could be determined by assayers, even in ancient/medieval times. There are however, other properties of coins that were not controlled by the minters and, based on modern methods of analysis, can reveal additional information about the coins and metal sources. These properties are the impurities in the major metal used in the coins: the small amount of gold impurity in all silver or the small amounts of platinum and other metal impurities present in almost all gold. These impurity levels were unknown to the minters and this information provides what historians refer to as unbiased data. The iconography and legends on coins are biased in that their purpose was usually to glorify the reigning monarch. The metal impurity levels, on the other hand, were unknown and uncontrolled and, therefore, provide totally new, unbiased information.\n\nCoins can be analyzed by a variety of means. The fineness of gold coins can be approximated fairly accurately by density measurements since the metal usually alloyed with the gold (silver, or sometimes copper) differs markedly from the density of gold. Even silver coin fineness can be determined by density measurements, although less precisely, since the densities of silver and copper are similar in value. One problem with density measurements for the determination of fineness is that they can be applied with relative precision only to binary alloy mixtures. If a coin is made of a mixture of three metals, each with a different density, it is not possible to calculate the fineness of the coin from the density measurement. Other (usually minor) problems can also exist, such as the possible inclusion of air bubbles in the metal matrix.\n\nDestructive chemical analysis can provide reliable, precise, and complete analysis data for a coin. Published results indicate that about 2,000 ancient/medieval coins have been analyzed by this method during the past 150 years. The obvious problem with destructive chemical analysis is that you no longer have the coin; it is dissolved in acid as part of the analysis.\n\nAbout 20 years ago, various historians and art historians inquired if it would be possible to modify methods already in use for the analysis of archaeological artifacts and apply them to the analysis of coins and metallic works of art. The method, neutron activation analysis, is based on the procedure of bombarding samples with neutrons (usually in a nuclear reactor) to make a tiny fraction of the atoms radioactive. Based on the types of radioactive atoms produced, it is possible to say what chemical elements are present in a sample. Based on the intensities of the radiation emitted by these radioactive elements, it is possible to say how much of a chemical element is present.\n\nNeutron activation analysis is often described as a non-destructive method of analysis since the sample still remains intact; typically much less than one-in-one-billion of the atoms is made radioactive. (A coin will have about 1022 atoms.) After the induced radioactivity has decayed, the sample will appear unchanged. One problem with the method, of course, is how long you must wait for the radioactivity to dissipate; for some elements this could be years, for others only minutes. We have devised two methods of neutron activation analysis applicable to coins. Both can provide useful information. They are described below.\n\nNeutron Activation Analysis Methods\n\nOf the two methods based on neutron activation analysis that were devised for the analysis of coins, the first is strictly non-destructive, results in the production of only short-lived radioactive silver, and shows undetectable radioactivity after about 10-15 minutes. It allows determining the silver fineness of a coin. The second method, while not strictly non-destructive, requires removal of only a tiny sample of metal from the edge of the coin in the form of a metal rubbing (streak) on high-purity, quartz tubing. This metal rubbing is made radioactive in a nuclear reactor and allows determination of the relative amounts of silver, gold, copper, zinc, arsenic, and antimony in the rubbing. Each method has it advantages and disadvantages. Both methods have been described in various articles.1\n\nMethod 1: Whole Coin Irradiation\n\nThe coin, silver or gold, is irradiated with neutrons emitted from a neutron source. We use a plutonium-beryllium source that is housed in our chemistry laboratory. It has a very low neutron intensity compared to that available in a nuclear reactor, about one billionth the intensity of neutrons in a reactor. The only chemical element in a coin that is made radioactive is silver and this short half-life silver radioactivity is dissipated in 10-15 minutes. Usually, the coin is irradiated for one minute; 20 seconds later the amount of induced radioactive silver is determined by taking a one minute radioactive count of the sample.\n\nThe accuracy of this method is dependent on the amount of radioactive \"counts\" determined; the greater the weight of silver in the coin, the larger the number of counts, and the greater the accuracy. The analysis can be repeated on the same coin after waiting the requisite 10-15 minutes. Usually about 10 repeat analyses are made on a single coin and the data averaged. By irradiating coins of known silver content (modern coins are used as these standards) it is possible to determine the counts per gram of silver that are detected. However, for a variety of reasons that relate to the manner in which neutrons interact with various densities and thicknesses of metal, this value is also dependent on the thickness and diameter of the coin. Thus, the ideal standard to be used is always a coin of approximately the same weight, silver fineness, thickness, and diameter as the coin being analyzed. We have been able to derive empirical correction factors to correct partially for some of these effects and, in general, are able to use this method to analyze for the percent silver in almost any coin. The final data can be valid to about ± 1 to ± 2% silver.\n\nIf a coin is highly corroded and thus heavier than the original coin because of the oxide, sulfide, and/or carbonate that form the corrosion products, then the measured % Ag will be less than the actual % Ag that was present in the original uncorroded coin. This effect will generally be of importance only for highly corroded silver coins having a high copper content where the corrosion extends deep into the coin,2 and no method of analysis, including destructive chemical analysis, will provide an accurate assessment of the silver fineness of the original coin.\n\nOver 5,000 coins have been analyzed by this method. Although the silver fineness of a coin can be determined with reasonable accuracy without destroying the coin, an obvious disadvantage is the need to have the coin at our laboratory, as well as the time it takes to perform the many repeat analyses.\n\nNone of the coins discussed in this paper were analyzed using this method. However, it was used for the analysis of 20 silver coins and buttons discussed in the paper by G. Lill published in this volume. Since time did not permit performing more than four or five repeat analyses, this resulted in ± values that are larger than is possible if ten or more repeat analyses had been made.\n\nMethod 2: Analysis of Metal Rubbings\n\nThis method does not require having the coin in Ann Arbor. The metal rubbings can be taken from the edges of coins in a museum coin room or from metallic works of art while they are still on display in a museum case. We have analyzed over 10,000 coins by this method and, in a working day, are generally able to irradiate and analyze about 100 samples plus rubbings from metal alloy standards of known composition.\n\nThere are numerous advantages to this method of analysis. They are: (a) the ability to take samples in a museum; (b) the (almost) non-destructive nature of the sampling; (c) the ability to detect certain impurities in the metal; and (d) the ease of analyzing hundreds of coin samples of the same type and from the composite data drawing statistical conclusions, which would often not be possible if only a few samples of the same type were analyzed.\n\nThere are two possible disadvantages of this method of analysis. The first disadvantage is that the sample is so very tiny (<0.1 mg) that we are unable to weigh it with any accuracy. Therefore, we can only determine the relative amounts, not the absolute amounts, of the metals we detect. However, if we assume that the metals that we detect account for 100% of the metal in the coin, then we can convert these relative values into absolute values. For most coins this assumption is reasonably valid. Published destructive chemical analyses of whole coins3 generally show less than 1-2% of metals we cannot detect by this method: those metals include lead, nickel, and tin, none of which are made sufficiently radioactive to allow detection.\n\nAlthough almost all ancient/medieval silver coins contain at most only 1-2% of these undetected metals, some of the coins being considered at this symposium could have appreciable tin, since tin was one of the metals also available in Bolivia and Peru. Because we are unable to detect it, if it is present to any appreciable extent in any coin, our method of calculating the silver fineness would result in erroneously high values. Consider, for example, the case where a coin contains 60% Ag and 40% Cu but nothing else, which is characteristic of some of the coins considered by G. Lill. We could determine a %Ag/%Cu ratio = 60/40 = 1.50 and calculate the % Ag correctly as = 1.50/(1.50 + 1.00) = 60.0% Ag. If, however, the coin actually contained 60% Ag, 10% Cu, and 30% Sn, but nothing else, we could experimentally determine a correct %Ag/%Cu ratio = 60/10 = 6.00, but not knowing that appreciable tin was also present, we would calculate an erroneous % Ag = 6.00/(6.00 + 1.00) = 85.7% Ag. If the undetected metals comprise only a few percent, as is the case for most coins, the error in the calculated % Ag is only a few percent. Thus, the ratio of detected metals can be correct, but the calculated silver fineness can be on the high side.\n\nThe second and sometimes more important disadvantage of Method 2 is that the metal at the surface of the coin where the metal rubbing is taken is not necessarily representative of the interior of the coin; the more reactive metals such as copper are depleted.4 This is certainly the case for any corroded surface of the coin. Some surface \"depletion\" may also occur during the cooling of the planchet prior to striking5 due to selective metal phase separation at the surface. We get around this problem of surface depletion (at least partially) by first stroking a tiny area (about 3 x 3 mm) on the edge of the coin with fine-grain emery paper to expose the shiny metal and then taking the metal rubbing from this shiny area. Working with an originally shiny coin does not assure that corrosion is absent since some method of coin cleaning could have been used and the coin cleaning could easily have depleted some of the surface copper. Rubbing gently with emery paper does not always eliminate completely the problem of surface corrosion since for some coins, especially those that have been cleaned extensively or show extensive corrosion, such \"corrosion effects\" apparently go slightly deeper into the coin,6 deeper than we would want to rub. What we invariably find in some of the data is that the copper (which is much more easily oxidized than is silver or gold) percentage we detect in these rubbings is less than that present in the whole coin; because of the method required to calculate the silver fineness in Method 2, this is seen in the data as a higher calculated % Ag.\n\nThe combination of these two effects—the undetectibility of some metals and the surface corrosion loss of copper—can result in % Ag values for Method 2 that are about 2-10% higher for the typical coin than the true % Ag found by Method 1. This is shown in fig. 1 where % Ag data are given for about 50 Sasanian coins of the Persian monarch Shapur I (A.D. 241-72) that were analyzed by both methods. As is seen, Method 2 usually shows % Ag values that are greater than the true % Ag found by Method 1.\n\n1. Silver content of Sasanian coins of the Persian monarch Shapur I (A.D. 241-72), as determined by Methods 1 and 2\n\nEven in those cases where we are able to determine accurately the % Ag based on uncorroded samples, the measured silver content is not necessarily the intended silver content of the mint. The reason is that, except for modern coins for which very pure silver and copper were used in preparing the coin alloy, most older coins were made of silver and copper that were impure. Thus, the intended silver percentage is more correctly given by the measured silver content plus the percentages of those impurities that were associated with the original silver used in making the coin alloy. Gold (as is discussed below), and probably also lead, is associated primarily with the silver. Based on published destructive chemical analysis data for high silver content coins, it appears that our Method 2 values of % Ag + % Au could serve as a good indicator of the intended silver content for these coins.7\n\n2. Percent gold in Sasanian coins of Shapur I\n\nThe Gold:Silver Ratio\n\nCopper and bronze coins generally have very low and sometimes undetectable amounts of gold; the gold in silver-copper alloy coins, therefore, is associated almost exclusively with the silver. Conversely, arsenic, antimony, and zinc impurities appear to be associated almost entirely with the copper. We can illustrate this gold:silver relationship using data for the same Sasanian coins of fig. 1. Shown in fig. 2 is the weight % Au versus the weight % Ag for this series of coins. The % Ag ranges from a low of 3.7% to a high of 96.2%, a factor of 26.0; the % Au ranges from a low of 0.00984% to a high of 0.679%, a factor of 69.0. More important, there is a general correlation of the gold content with the silver content. From these and many other data we can conclude that what is important is not the % Au but the amount of gold relative to that of silver. We report this ratio as \"mg Au/100 mg Ag,\" in effect, the weight % gold per 100 weight % silver. And this is one of the ratio values that we obtain directly from Method 2. It is independent of the amount of other metals such as lead, tin, or nickel, that we do not detect. Shown in fig. 3 are these gold:silver ratios for the Sasanian coins. The values range from a low of 0.266 to a high of 0.776, a factor of only 2.9.\n\nThe gold:silver ratio data are plotted in fig. 3 and other graphs in this paper using a logarithmic scale ranging from 0.0001 to 1.0. The lower value is approximately our limit of detection of gold relative to silver. The upper value is approximately the maximum gold impurity level we find in silver coins. The reason for using a logarithmic scale is that the trace-element contents of geological samples tend to display a logarithmic distribution of values. For this reason, we also calculate averages and standard deviations of the impurity ratios based on their logarithms. It is this gold:silver ratio that we use in drawing conclusions in this article. It is also used by B. Stallard, G. Lill, and J. Lasser in their presentations published herein.\n\nThe uncertainty in the gold:silver values depends to some degree on the magnitude of the value. For gold-impurity levels in the range of 0.0100-1.0000, the ± is about 10% of the value. Below 0.0100 mg Au/100 mg Ag, which is characteristic of the Potosí silver, the ± is about 0.0010-0.0030 and, therefore, can represent a ± of much more than 10%. This is because of a very small, but variable, amount of gold impurity (about one part per billion) even in the high-purity quartz we use. These two effects place a lower limit of about 0.0001 Au/100 Ag on the reliable detection of gold in the metal rubbing.\n\nUsually three repeat samples were taken from the same cleaned spot on the edge of a coin. If the gold-impurity values were consistent, as was usually the case, then the values were averaged.\n\n3. Gold:silver impurity levels in Sasanian coins of Shapur I\n\nIf the first sample especially was high or if the repeat samples showed a marked decrease in gold level as we progressed from samples 1 to 2 to 3, then we would select the lowest value or the average of the two lowest. The reasoning is that since gold is the least corroded of the metals being analyzed, any corrosion losses at the surface of the more reactive silver would result in aberrant high gold:silver ratios, unlike the true levels a little further into the coin.\n\nIdentification of Coins with Potosí Silver\n\nApparently each silver source has its own characteristic, but slightly variable, gold:silver impurity ratio. We have been able to show that, in some cases, it is possible to correlate the gold:silver ratios with the mint marks on the coins, to differentiate between coins minted in different locations where each relies on different silver sources,8 and, in other cases, to identify modern fake silver coins or metallic works of art by the fact that they have too little gold impurity.9 The distinction between silver sources is, of course, easier if there are wide differences in the gold-impurity levels of the silver sources. If different silver sources were used but the sources had similar levels of gold-impurity, then differentiation is not possible.\n\nAlthough we ascribe differences in gold:silver ratios directly to differences in these ratios in the silver ores, an alternate explanation is possible. If the type of silver ore being extracted at two sites was chemically different (Ag metal at one, AgCl at another, for example), then different ore purification and, if necessary, smelting procedures would have been used to extract the metal. If the procedures being used altered the gold:silver ratios to different extents, then the final gold-impurity levels in the refined silver would be different at the two sites. The end result of course will be the same; silver from two different ore sites will have different gold levels. Therefore, we will continue to refer to differences in gold:silver ratios as though they were due entirely to differences existing in the original ores.\n\nIt is rare for ancient/medieval and even sixteenth-seventeenth century silver coins to have gold-impurity levels less than about 0.0200 mg Au/100 mg Ag. Some early Athenian coins are one exception. Apparently one silver source used by the ancient Greeks had a very low level of gold impurity. What makes this study possible is that Potosí silver coins also have a very low gold-impurity content and this level of gold impurity is markedly different from that in Mexican and European silver coins.\n\nTable 1 GOLD IMPURITY LEVELS IN SILVER COINS OF POTOSÍ Table I: Gold Impurity Levels in Silver Coins of Potosi Owner* Streak No. Ruler Year, Assayer Mint Denomination mg Au / 100 mg Ag BWS S-45, 131/2 Philip II, 1556-98 B Potosi 0.5 Real 0.0026 BWS S-187/8 Philip II, 1556-98 R Potosi 1 Real 0.0011 BWS S-44, 129/30 Philip II, 1556-98 B Potosi 1 Real 0.0021 JMcP S-47, 87, 8 Philip II, 1556-98 A Potosi 1 Real 0.0003 ANS G-137, L-560-2 Philip II, 1556-98 Potosi 1 Real 0.0013 ANS G-136, L-557-9 Philip II, 1556-98 Potosi 2 Real 0.0021 AAG C-4212 Philip II, 1556-98 Potosi 2 Real 0.0010 BWS S-171/2 Philip II, 1556-98 B Potosi 2 Real 0.0014 JMcP S-46, 85/6 Philip II, 1556-98 A Potosi 2 Real 0.0014 ANS L-555/6 Philip II, 1556-98 B Potosi 4 Real 0.0016 BWS S-185/6, 271-3 Philip II, 1556-98 A Potosi 4 Real 0.0010 BWS S-173/4 Philip II, 1556-98 B Potosi 4 Real 0.0027 BWS S-175/6 Philip II, 1556-98 B Potosi 4 Real 0.0011 BWS S-177/8 Philip II, 1556-98 B Potosi 4 Real 0.0012 ANS L-553/4 Philip II, 1556-98 B Potosi 8 Real 0.0018 BWS S-193/4 Philip II, 1556-98 R Potosi 8 Real 0.0003 ANS L-1091, S-3, 4 Philip II, 1556-98 B Potosi 8 Real 12.1 ANS L-1093, W-7-9, S-5, 9 Philip II, 1556-98 A Potosi 8 Real 0.0018 ANS L-1095, W-10-12 Philip II, 1556-98 A Potosi 8 Real 0.0070 BWS S-179/80, 262-4 Philip II, 1556-98 B Potosi 8 Real 0.0004 BWS S-181/2, 265-7 Philip II, 1556-98 B Potosi 8 Real 0.0011 BWS S-183/4, 268-70 Philip II, 1556-98 B Potosi 8 Real 0.0001 BWS S-191/2 Philip III, 1598-1621 R Potosi 2 Real 0.0043 ANS L-1085, W-13-15 Philip III, 1598-1621 Potosi 8 Real 0.0018 ANS L-1087, 8, S-1, 2 Philip III, 1598-1621 R Potosi 8 Real 0.0008 ANS L-1089 Philip III, 1598-1621 B Potosi 8 Real 0.0027 JMcP S-95/6 Philip IV , 1621-69 1630-40 Potosi 0.5 Real 0.0068 JMcP S-97/8 Philip IV , 1621-69 1630-40 Potosi 0.5 Real 0.0017 JMcP S-99/100 Philip IV , 1621-69 1630-40 Potosi 0.5 Real 0.0021 AAG C3077 Philip IV , 1621-69 1664 Potosi 1 Real 0.0035 AAG C4259 Philip IV , 1621-69 1621-32, P Potosi 2 Real 0.0015 ANS G-138 Philip IV , 1621-69 Potosi 8 Real 0.0068 AAG C-4256 Philip IV , 1621-69 1630 Potosi 8 Real 0.0018 ANS J-85/6 Philip IV , 1621-69 1664 Potosi 8 Real 0.0044 ANS J-83/4 Philip IV , 1621-69 1666 Potosi 8 Real 0.0045 AAG C4213 Charles II, 1665-1700 1673, E Potosi 2 Real 0.0032 AAG C4214 Charles II, 1665-1700 1681, V Potosi 2 Real 0.0020 AAG C4215 Charles II, 1665-1700 1687, VR Potosi 2 Real 0.0019\n\nAnalysis of 38 Potosí coins spanning a time period of ca. 120 years shows an average gold level of 0.0017 mg Au/100 mg Ag. These data are given in Table 1. Omitted from the average is the one coin of Philip II from the ANS collection with a gold level of 12.1. The gold content of this 8-real coin is so high, about 11%, that it roughly doubles the intrinsic precious-metal net value of the coin. The coin has a slightly yellow color and its gold content could be easily determined by even the simple touchstone technique. This coin is either a mint error that escaped detection, was made directly from gold/silver artifacts stolen from the Incas, or was deliberately fabricated to have this high gold content. If the last, it may have been intended to be passed as a coin of about 90% gold. This would be relatively simple to achieve by acid washing the coin to remove most silver and copper near the surface leaving a surface layer of very high gold content.\n\nAs part of this ongoing study we have analyzed 143 Mexican, European, and Islamic coins that predate the discovery of the Potosí hill of silver. The number of pre-Potosí coins of each country that were examined is summarized in Table 2. Of these 143 coins, only three, two talers of 1548 from Bohemia and one 1544 coin from Hungary , contained very low gold-impurity levels. Apparently a silver source in central Europe, probably in the region of Bohemia, possessed low gold levels. All other pre-Potosí-dated coins had gold levels clearly exceeding those of Potosí coins. Thus, if a post-Potosí-discovery European or Islamic coin showed the very low Potosí levels of gold impurity, it can be inferred with relatively high certainty that it was made of Potosí silver, especially if it was a coin issued by a country that would have been expected to have had access to Potosí silver at the time the coin was issued.\n\nTable 2 NUMBER OF COINS ANALYZED Number with Date* Number with Date* < 0.0100 mg Au/100 mg Ag < 0.0100 mg Au/100 mg Ag Region/Country < ca. 1550 ca. 1550-1700 Number % of 1550-1700 Mexico 20 10 0 0% Potosi - 38 37 100% Spain (incl.

The number from each country is listed in Table 2. Of these coins, only 28 (identified in Table 3) have the low levels of gold associated with Potosí silver. The surprising outcome of this study was that the fraction of post-1550 coins having Potosí silver was so small. It is possible that a few additional coins were made of mixtures of new and old silver (Potosí and European silver, for example), since old coins were sometime melted down together with new silver, or mixtures of silver from more than one silver source (e.g. Mexico and Potosí). It does not take much added silver having a high gold-impurity level to increase a low gold level markedly.10 However, the composite data do not suggest that this is an important factor in the coins we have analyzed.\n\nThe gold-impurity data obtained for the 891 coins we analyzed are summarized in this paper in graphical form as figs. 4 and 5. Expanded versions of the data for Spain and Italy are given in figs. 6 and 7 with the identification of the mint cities noted on the graph. In almost all cases, these gold-impurity data are the average of two or three successive streak samples. The actual numerical data and coin identifications, including coin owners, are listed separately in a series of tables, copies of which have been put on file at the American Numismatic Society, the coin rooms of the British and Ashmolean Museums, and the Cabinet des Médailles of the Bibliothèque nationale, whose curators allowed us to obtain rubbings from their coins.\n\nThe Scope of the Problem\n\nThe purpose of the research on which this paper is based is to elucidate the connections between a precious metal and the economy of early modern Europe . Contemporary observers, such as Azpilceuta of the School of Salamanca,11 and distinguished historians, such as Earl Hamilton,12 have concurred that the silver from the New World mine at Potosí had an enormous impact on the European economy. Indeed, Hamilton carefully estimated price changes in commodities of all kinds and demonstrated in detail the inflationary process at work in Spain . Other historians, such as Spooner,13 saw the same processes at work in France. Until recently, this economic process was connected conceptually to an increased supply of silver, an increase which could also be estimated from mine records and shipping manifests. The connection seemed so clear to observers and historians that the mechanisms through which the increased supply of silver entered the economic system of early modern Europe remained unexplored. An obvious intermediate process between the production and refining of silver ore and economic change was coinage. While it is true that silver shaped into sumptuary articles such as drinking vessels or sacred objects such as monstrances could be used as means of exchange, the coins of the period could be expected to be the major conduit through which silver made its way from the mine in the Viceroyalty of Peru into the marketplaces of Europe .\n\nTable 3 28 POST-1550 COINS WITH POTOSÍ LEVEL OF GOLD IMPURITY Country Ruler Mint Date Value Weight, grams mg Au / 100 mg Ag Owner* Streak I.

Gold:silver impurity levels in Italian coins, identified by mint\n\nWhen this research first began more than a decade ago, the research question focused on the amount of the Potosí silver expected to appear in coinage and the dates of these appearances.14 In addition, the presumed absence of Potosí silver in some coinage, primarily English coinage, was to be confirmed. As the research progressed, a major paradigm in economic history began to shift. An approach which sought to confirm the presence of the American silver and to estimate its influence also shifted. The focus moved to an investigation of where the metal actually did appear. The analyses reported here were developed to ascertain where silver from Potosí could be identified in the coinages of the Iberian Peninsula , England , the Spanish Netherlands, the cities of Italy , France, trading cities in Central Europe, and the Islamic world.\n\nA review of the findings presented in the graphs, shown as figs. 4 and 5, reveals that very little Potosí silver could be found in the European coinage. Predictably, Spanish coinage of the period had the highest percentage at 22%. If the coinage of Barcelona, which contains no Potosí silver, is omitted, then 31% of the remaining Spanish coins were made of Potosí silver. Analysis of five coins from the rest of the Iberian peninsula showed one made of Potosí silver, and Italy , the center of the arms industry of the period, has the next highest percentage of Potosí silver at 14%. This is a predictable finding since the Spanish Crown was known to be among the best clients of Italy 's many armorers. The Low Countries' coinage has very little Potosí silver; only one such coin was found. And, contrary to the expectations of many distinguished economic historians of France, extensive analysis of the coinage of the period reveals no trace of Potosí silver. England , as expected, has shown no American silver in the coins analyzed. New analyses were conducted recently on Central European coins and the gold level associated with Potosí silver was found in only one 1639-dated coin from Brunswick. Other new, extensive analyses of Ottoman (Turkey), Sefavid (Iran, Afghanistan), and Moghul (India ) coinage, considered a possible entrepot for American silver, revealed that no Potosí silver could be detected in those coinages.\n\nA major difference between historical research and other types of scientific research is that those who work with coins or other historical materials can use only surviving evidence. There is no way to know whether surviving materials resemble all materials of the period or are different from them. Therefore, we do not know whether the coins which have been studied are representative of the coins produced in the period. Further, the great collections from which our samples came may contain certain types of surviving coins but not others. While this difficulty cannot be overcome, steps were taken to select coins for analysis which could be considered as more likely to contain Potosí silver than other coins. The underlying logic was that coins of higher denomination as well as coins early in a series of fixed-type coins were more likely to have been made from the new silver. Finally, whenever historical documents indicated that American silver was present in an area, coins from that area were chosen for study.\n\nIf the data presented in the graphs do adequately represent the metallic profile of early modern European and Asian coinage, the silver from Potosí, which in the words of the Dominicans at Salamanca \"made all things so expensive,\" had little impact on the coinage except for Spain and Italy . Even there, the impact, and presumably the real economic effect, was small.\n\nA number of related questions arise for consideration. First, it is clear that the simplistic monetary explanation of the inflation of the sixteenth century is seriously flawed. While the evidence adduced here is not the first to raise serious concerns about the Hamilton thesis, it provides compelling evidence that other factors, such as pressure of population upon a relatively rigid agricultural sector, explain increases in food prices much better than any monetary explanation. Indeed, British and Scandinavian food prices were rising as rapidly as continental prices. Further, some price rises have now been shown to predate the mining of the silver.\n\nA second question concerns the other ways in which American silver could have been somewhat influential in European market economies. Clearly, it is possible that coins minted in the New World could have circulated in that way and could have been used in bulk for some transactions.\n\nA third question is related to the ultimate destination of the American silver. Some was used for non-monetary purposes, such as the decorative arts and jewelry and, in that form, could have remained outside the economic system for centuries, or could have been used for collateral for loans. Still, such utilization could not have accounted for most of the silver. There is also a possibility that some of the silver could have found its way even farther east in Asia, and that possibility requires further study.15\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nA.A.

Numerous undergraduates also assisted in this study and their help in irradiating coins and performing the data reduction has been invaluable.\n\nThe Early Lima Mint (1568–1572)\n\nEduardo Dargent Chamot\n\nCoinage of the Americas Conference at The American Numismatic Society, New York City\n\n© The American Numismatic Society, 1989\n\nTrial and Error\n\nThe study of the origin of the Lima mint has been difficult due to misleading information which has been carried forward from one author to another and to the lack of published documents on the subject. Ismael Portal notes that \"one of the first actions of Pizarro after founding the city (Lima) was to establish here a mint.\"1 Later he indicates that Charles V approved the creation of a mint in Lima by a royal decree dated May 11, 1535:2 It is our wish, and we order, that in the cities of Mexico , Santa Fe de el Nuevo Reino de Granada and in the Imperial Villa de Potosí there should be mints with suitable staff and personnel for their operation. In the margin: \"The Emperor D. Carlos and the Queen G (Juana) in Madrid May 11, 1535.\"\n\nIt is obvious that the law could refer only to Mexico , as Santa Fe (Bogotá) was founded only in 1538. The mines of Potosí were discovered in 1545 and the city became the Imperial Villa in 1547. Moreover, Lima, although founded January 18, 1535, is not even mentioned in the law.\n\nIf not Pizarro, then other officials in charge of Lima and the Viceroyalty, had for some time implored the Council of the Indies to establish a mint. In the late 1540s, the king answered that, following the return to Spain of Pedro de la Gasca, who had settled the insurrection of the Pizarros in Peru, he would have a better knowledge of the needs of that realm and would then decide on the mint issue. La Gasca arrived back in Seville in September 1550 but no decision was forthcoming. In 1551 the council wrote to Charles V reminding him of his offer.3\n\nThe demands for a mint continued into the next decade. Viceroy Andres Hurtado de Mendoza wrote in 1556 and viceroy Conde de Nieva in 1561 repeated the need for a mint.4 Finally, by a letter from Nieva to Philip II on December 26, 1562, we know that the king had asked him to indicate the most convenient place to build the \"Casa de Moneda.\"5\n\nLope García de Castro succeeded Nieva after the latter's death. Castro wrote once more to express the need for a mint in the Viceroyalty and mentioned that by the time he left Spain in 1563 the \"ordenanzas\" and all the documents required to establish the mint had been prepared and needed only the royal signature.6\n\nThe Ordenanzas of Segovia\n\nFinally the law creating the mint was signed by Philip II at El Bosque de Segovia on August 21, 1565. In the introduction to the ordenanzas the king clearly states that he knew of the problems afflicting the land due to the lack of coinage, a hardship for all and especially the poor, and therefore he had decided that it was necessary to establish a mint in Lima.7\n\nWhen the governor, Lope García de Castro, received the ordenanzas he hastened to write to the sovereign on June 3, 1566,8 that the mint would be of great benefit for the country; but three months later, on September 22, 1566, Licenciado Juan Bautista Monzón wrote the king to complain that Castro had done nothing about the mint.9\n\nThe 1560s were an especially conflict-laden decade for the Viceroyalty of Peru. The conquest and the civil wars were over and the old men \"who had won the land for themselves and their children\" were continually displaced by groups of bureaucrats arriving from the Peninsula who took the best positions, both social and political, for themselves. García de Castro meanwhile was informed, it seems, of Monzón's accusation and on October 1, 1566, wrote to the king that he had begun to work on the mint, but as there was no one there qualified to superintend production of the coins, he suggested that somebody be sent from Spain .10 Castro repeated his request by letter of April 2, 1567. In that letter he also suggested that in addition to the Lima mint, another should be established in La Plata since it was close to Potosí and there was an ample supply of firewood there.11 Again on December 20, 1567, García de Castro insisted on the need for mint officials, and revealed a very interesting detail concerning the location of the mint. \"In the Government House I believe would be a place to establish the mint in such a manner that we will have together the Presidency, the foundry, the mint, and also the jail.\"12 This letter and other references make it clear that the original Lima mint was established where the Presidential Palace today stands, at the Plaza de Armas and not at the later location \"Campo del Fraile\" or where the present mint stands on Moneda Street.\n\nFinally, on February 7, 1568, Castro informed the king that he had found the persons he required for the mint and hoped to start the coinage within one month.13 We should not be misled by this letter, as some historians have, to think that the mint started operations in March 1568. New documentation in Seville has pointed to September 2 of that same year as the occasion of the first official ceremony at the mint. Alonso Rincón, an assayer, who had been in Peru since at least 1558, made available to the engraver Antonio de Bobadilla his identifying \"R\" so that the coins made with the silver he assayed could be marked. The document detailing this event was signed by the official scribe, Joan de Iturrieta.14 On that same date Baltazar Tercero was named supervisor and the witnesses were Juan de Evia, master of the scales, and the guardian Nuño Carvajo; both of whom were related to the house of Castro, as was a nephew, Lope de Mendaña, who was named treasurer of the mint, all of whom were by then already appointed to their mint positions.15\n\nThe first silver received in the mint was registered on September 6 and the next day four minters were appointed to start production immediately. The list of all the employees of the first mint during Mendaña's administration is as follows:\n\nTreasurer Lope de Mendaña Osorio Assayer Alonso Rincón Die Sinker Antonio de Bobadilla Master of the Scales Juan de Evia Scribe Joan de Iturrieta Guardian Nuño Carvajo Supervisors Baltazar Tercero Pedro Naxerá Pedro Bautista Miguel García (appointed 1569) Minters Diego Amaro Diego Hernandez Ayllon Cristobal de Villafana Alonso Gonzales\n\nBefore November 27, 1568, all the silver delivered to the mint came from the royal treasury (real hacienda) but on that date we find a note about the reception of 118 marks, 7 ounces 4 ochavas brought to the mint by the silver merchant and later Potosí assayer Juan Ballesteros Narvaes.16\n\nThe End of the Plata Corriente\n\nOn November 2, 1568, the audiencia declared January 1, 1569, as the terminal date for the circulation of plata corriente. The councillors and their president made it clear by public notice that the transition period was being allowed so that the earlier silver issues could be spent, marked, or coined, and that as of New Year's Day, plata corriente could no longer circulate, not even that on which the 20% royal tax had been paid.17 The audiencia also explained that contracts established before November 2, stipulating payment in plata corriente, had to be paid at 1 1/4 real each tomin and 10 reales per peso: that is, at 2 reales more than the minted peso.18\n\nTwo days later Juan Sanchez de los Ríos, as delegate of the Lima merchants, claimed they would lose much by that exchange rate and that the problem could be solved by \"providing that those who owed in plata corriente could pay with assayed money reduced 25%, the difference of many years standing between the 'ensayado' and the 'corriente'.\"19 The audiencia adopted the arrangement advanced by the merchants.\n\nAt the end of 1568, and in the first days of 1569, some 8-real coins, not authorized by the ordenanzas of 1565, were produced. Some numismatists have claimed that the extremely rare 8-real pieces minted in the early Lima mint were patterns or even fakes, but it is now known that they were officially coined with the approval of the audiencia, a fact that helped Mendaña against the accusation that he had those struck against the orders of the king. Not only the entries made by the mint specifying the 8-real pieces, but also documents that will be mentioned later, remove all doubts about the nature of these coins.20\n\nFrom late 1568 until October 11, 1569, the mint produced its coins regularly; according to a letter signed by Gregorio Gonzales de Cuenca to the king dated February 6, 1571, 29,597 marks were made into coins.21 The date October 11 is of special importance because it seems that Mendaña's administration ended then or soon after. Dr. Gabriel de Loarte prosecuted Mendaña and the other mint officers on several charges, one of which was the minting of the 8 reales mentioned above. This trial was long and tedious but after influencing the right people and after the loss of important documents, all were absolved of the charges.22 Since one of the accusations was that the mint had produced coins of less silver content than officially decreed, all persons in possession of these coins were called to weigh them, and from July 29 through August 2, 32 individuals presented a total of 105,080 reales of which 10% were found to be underweight.23\n\nAt the end of September 1570, the Viceroy Francisco de Toledo named two new officers to the mint: Xines Martinez, its second assayer, and Cristóbal de Segovia, its first blanqueador.24 But the corruption that had been hinted at since the end of 1569 became fully apparent in February 1571. On the sixth, Cuenca revealed how the Mendaña administration had cheated the royal treasury and how some pages of the trials had been purposefully lost;25 on the twelfth, Licenciado Ramires de Cartagena also addressed the king to say that the ordenanzas he had issued in 1565 had not been adhered to. Nevertheless, Cartagena argued that despite the existing problems, the Lima mint should not be closed since to do so would impose great hardship on the poor.26\n\nA month and a half later, on March 28, the spokesman for the audiencia Licenciado Vizcarra informed Philip II that \"the work of the mint in this city is coming to an end\" and that \"there are very few reales and almost nothing is being coined and although in the mint and tools—much money of the royal treasury has been spent, there would be no problem if the work stops.\"27\n\nOn March 8, 1570, Philip II caused the dies of the American coins to be changed to make them similar in type to those used by the peninsular mints. On July 28, the die sinker Roxini received an initial payment to prepare the punches and other instruments to be sent to Mexico and Lima;28 on April 24, 1571, Ramirez de Cartagena informed the king that he had received the order to change the dies and that it would be done as soon as they arrived. He added, \"although today not even a peso is minted,...when the dies arrive, whatever is coined will be done with them,\" confirming that by this date the Lima mint had ceased operating.29 Nevertheless, viceroy Toledo informed the king on March 1, 1572, that the new punches sent by him to stamp gold and silver and to make coins had arrived and would be used accordingly.30 Some coins of the new dies were made in Lima, since examples are known with the initial \"X\" of Martinez.\n\nDue to the paucity of silver arriving at the mint and the previous complications with the officers, viceroy Toledo urged a change in location of the mint to the vicinity of Potosí which, he argued, was the \"fountain\" from which all the silver of the kingdom flowed.31 The audiencia of Lima opposed Toledo's decision, arguing that the city had a heavy financial investment in the mint. In the end an agreement was reached, as reported by Medina, by which half of the equipment and tools were sent to the mountains and the other half stayed in Lima.\n\nSoon after the transfer of the tools and machinery, the Lima mint quarters were transformed into the jail of the audiencia.32 Toledo at about the same time wrote from Cuzco to the king informing him that Lima \"had kept half of the tools and with them they are doing some work\" but also pointed out that the Lima mint was of no use and that no coins issued there were to be seen at ten leagues from the city.33\n\nYears later, Toledo recognized the mistake of leaving Lima without a mint, and on August 31, 1577, he named Luis Rodriguez de la Serna as treasurer of the new Lima mint; soon after the mint was working again. In this second period of the mint, which ended in 1592 according to the last payment of the royal minting tax,34 the silver was assayed by Diego de la Torre, who used a \"D\" and a star as his mark, taken from the arms of the city.\n\nThis second period of the Lima mint, which is beyond the scope of this paper, has been well studied and much information on it has already been published. Those interested may refer to Medina, Burzio, and Sellschopp.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nIsmael Portal, Cosas Limeñas (Lima, 1919).\n\n2\n\nRecopilación de las Leyes de Indias (Madrid , 1682), Book 4, Section 23, Ley Primera, vol. 2, p. 30.\n\n3\n\nJ.T.

Cunietti-Ferrando\n\nCoinage of the Americas Conference at the American Numismatic Society, New York City\n\n© The American Numismatic Society, 1989\n\nBefore the founding of the mints in Lima, La Plata, and Potosí, financial transactions often depended on \"plata corriente\"—unstamped, privately issued coins made of silver alloyed with various quantities of copper, tin, or lead. This situation was accepted out of custom and pure necessity although it was a source of problems for private individuals and especially for the Indians. At the same time the Spanish royal treasury was deprived of its income from the quinto—applicable to precious metals at the minehead—which was impossible to collect on this silver.\n\nThis illegal traffic, however much tolerated, justified the founding of the Lima Mint in 1565, which began to strike coins two years later. Its output, however, was not sufficient to meet the needs of Peruvian commerce or to replace the plata corriente. The mint alternated its coining with prolonged periods of inactivity. The viceroy, Francisco de Toledo, reluctantly had to authorize the continued circulation of the plata corriente, an authorization renewed on two later occasions.\n\nDetermined to undertake severe measures to end this abuse, the viceroy in a decree of May 20, 1571, ordered the sealing of the Luis de Berrío mine on the hill of Potosí as well as all other copper mines in order to prevent the use of this metal in alloys with silver to produce the low-grade coinage. On November 22, he decreed a period of four months for those who possessed plata corriente to have it melted down, assayed, and marked under penalty of forfeiture.\n\nMuch earlier, it had been recognized that the only way to eliminate totally the bad silver money was to increase the production of coins to replace it, which implied the founding of new mints. After meeting in Lima with several officials to study the matter, the viceroy undertook in mid-1572 a trip through the main cities under his jurisdiction. The officials had agreed that the founding of a new mint was necessary: some advocated founding it in Arequipa, while others preferred the town of Potosí because of its abundant silver supply.\n\nDuring this trip, viceroy Toledo visited La Plata, at that time comprising ca. 700 buildings, of which 60 were of some importance and another 250 were one-storied and of good construction. Among the latter there were a large number of shops employing craftsmen of all kinds. La Plata had been founded by Pedro Arzures under orders of Francisco Pizarro at an unknown date in 1539, following cruel warfare against the area's natives, the Chuquisaca and Charca Indians. Until 1555, La Plata was legally a \"villa\", or town, and afetr that date had the status of a city. Viceroy Toledo met there with the most important residents, judges of the royal audiencia, and members of the city council. After explaining to them the reason for his visit, he was persuaded to install the new mint in that city. The La Plata dignitaries set forth three reasons to persuade him: 1) that the employees of the mint would be dissuaded from thefts through fear of the presence of the audiencia in the same city; 2) that the cost of living was lower than in Potosí; and 3) that the abundance of firewood and coal would facilitate the melting of the metal, whereas in Potosí there was barely enough fuel for their present ovens and extraction industries.1 According to Vigñale, the viceroy considered the rest of the arguments, such as climate, superfluous or \"trivial and exaggerated,\" and he decided to dismiss them.2\n\nViceroy Toledo must have reached his decision toward the end of August 1572, for Dr. Barros communicated it to the monarch from that city on September 8. He called it \"advantageous\" and said that he had been commissioned to acquire the building in which to install the press, using money from a suit won against the heirs of a certain Tomás Vázquez.\n\nViceroy Toledo issued a directive which was to provoke serious conflicts and confrontations: he required that Lima send to him all the tools and machinery of the which had been inactive since 1570. The Limeños saw it as the dismantlement of a mint founded by royal decree of Phillip II on August 21, 1565, and constructed at a cost of more than 30,000 ducats. They maintained that the move to La Plata could not be made without authorization of the monarch. The order was defied, especially by the judges of the audiencia, whose spokesman was Ramírez de Cartagena.\n\nIn a document authored years later in Potosí, Alonso Rincón noted that the order was transmitted to an official, Altamirano, \"ordering him to take apart said mint and convert it into a jail or residence for judges and royal officials, and send all machinery and tools of said mint to this province. Said Altamirano carried out the order. Some persons and officials of said city and said mint sued against the transfer in the audiencia of said city.\"3\n\nAs a result they sent only half the dies and machinery and on January 27, 1573, having officially protested the new authorization as unlawful, they composed and sent a fully documented protest and complaint to the king. They were certainly right when they affirmed that in La Plata, \"with the salaries of the employees they cannot live, nor will anyone manufacture coins there given the expensiveness of land and the fact that things cost twice what they do here....\"4\n\nViceroy Toledo also wrote to the king justifying his conduct and noting, among other things, that the complaint lodged against him in Lima was motivated by his having hurt the private business ac- tivities of the judges. In an official document of September 24, 1573, he announced that the dies and machinery were already in La Plata.\n\nMeanwhile he organized a small staff of employees by ordering to that city, among others, Alonso Rincón, in order to work there in his double capacity of assayer and engraver, just as he had at the Lima Mint.\n\nThereby he was able to send to the king, enclosed in his letter of December 20, 1573, \"as a sample, the first coin struck—and the new stamp—after the founding of the mint in this province.\"5 Years later Rincón was to state in Potosí that before the founding of this mint \"some coinage was struck in La Plata while His Excellency was there. The coins were struck with a part of the machinery that should have been there: it being necessary to round up the rest by borrowing and by making some indispensable items themselves. They were borrowed from silversmiths and other craftsmen-engravers who owned them: without such equipment it would have been impossible to strike coins.\"6\n\nTo carry out the ephemeral production of the mint, the viceroy counted on the personal labor of Miguel García, who was put in charge as minter. In the testimony given years later in Potosí (1575) García recalled: \"about twenty months or two years ago more or less, while this witness was at the Huancavélica Mines, he was ordered by His Excellency to strike two thousand marks of silver, which order he carried out. As soon as they were finished, he ordered me to come to Potosí in order to strike the rest of the coins which were to be made in the mint which he had ordered founded in Potosí....\"7\n\nAnother important witness was Juan de Iturrieta, treasurer of the Potosí mint in 1575, who had been present at the coining. The viceroy's order was that \"in the residences where the president of the audiencia lived the striking of the coins was to commence....\" Nevertheless the witness pointed out that by then there were doubts \"whether in said city it was wise to set up said mint because the businessmen and private persons would have greater costs than the profits they could realize, having to transport their silver from Potosí to be struck in said city. Since from said city it would not be possible to supply said money to this site and the rest of this kingdom, His Excellency later ordered that said mint be founded and made in Potosí....\"8\n\nAt this juncture the viceroy himself must have already become aware that the Limeños' criticisms had a basis and that his decision to install the mint in La Plata had been unfortunate. He therefore decided to establish the mint permanently in Potosí. Before doing so he ordered coins to be struck there in order to justify his policy in this matter and took care to send a sample to the king. The coinage in itself was inconsequential and was so completely unnoticed that even in Lima they did not know of it. Since the Lima officials believed that nothing had been struck there, in January 1574, the audiencia addressed the king regarding the failure of the mint in Alto Peru:9 As to the mint we already wrote to Your Majesty about what had been done and how inconvenient the location would be besides the high cost. Also what had been invested in the Lima mint, which was founded by order of Your Majesty who had sent employees and dies for it. Also how unwise it would be to dismantle this mint or set up any other without express orders from Your Majesty. In spite of all that [Viceroy Toledo] undertook to dismantle this one—which is so necessary—and to set up the other one—which cannot be supported. The result is that neither here nor there is any money coined at all. In the Mint out there, there will be no coining unless it is after a great lapse of time and at great cost.\n\nThe viceroy had his share of the blame for acting in this manner evidently influenced by the pressure of the La Plata officials. On later recognizing that he had erred in his choice, he ordered the striking of the 2,000 marks and enjoined the city council to ensure delivery by the citizens of their silver to be converted into coins. As was to be expected, the response was negative and nobody turned in his silver for coining. This was exactly the justification which Viceroy Toledo was looking for to communicate his irerevocable decision to found the mint in Potosí and move to Potosí all the tools, dies, and machinery to be found in La Plata. Here is his description in his official communication, section 37, to the king on March 20, 1574:10 In reference to the mint about which I wrote to Your Majesty at length in my earlier dispatches, it was of great importance to this dominion to bring it up here for the following reasons: the silver—except that which contained mercury—could not be revalued and raised to its legitimate value because it was undervalued; the fifths tax of Your Majesty could not be collected on all the plata corriente, thus producing so many losses to Your royal treasury; it was not possible to prevent many swindles and much cheating which occurred every day in "
