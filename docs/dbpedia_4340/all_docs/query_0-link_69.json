        "text": "\"My intention is to explore how the public memory and its performance are highly political, and in this sense, how the cultivation of “Tradition,” which was only possible from the perspective of the victors, is focused on the woman’s body. This phenomenon forms a complex empowerment of public space, especially in “art music.” However, the music that is created for private spaces, such as “domestic music” or “educational music,” cannot be studied with the same paradigms as “art music.” In spite of this, scholars are characterizing both (amateurs housewives and professionals artists) as “women composers.” The problem is that both perspectives have in common a “contingent history.”\"\n\nAbstract The Venezuelan violinist Luigi Mazzocchi, concertmaster of the Pennsylvania Ballet Orchestra and associate concertmaster of the Delaware Symphony, studied for fifteen years in Venezuela’s El Sistema, rising to become a member of the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra. Leaving the system twenty years ago, he moved to the United States, where he has had a successful career as a professional violinist and educator. Mazzocchi now speaks out about the flaws of El Sistema, as described in detail by Geoff Baker in his 2014 book El Sistema: Orchestrating Venezuela’s Youth. After considering carefully the testimonies reported by Baker, Mazzocchi recognized and affirmed the accuracy of these accounts, which challenged the idealized view of El Sistema orchestra training in Venezuela as a tool leading to social action and as an embodiment of the high standards of a democratic society. Mazzocchi now feels the need to testify about his experiences in El Sistema. Despite his gratitude for the musical training it provided, the system nonetheless needs to reform its working conditions, leadership model, and culture in order to ensure its positive social impact and better serve as a model for music education in the future. Mazzocchi corroborates the claims of Baker’s book by depicting excellence in musical performance seriously compromised by a culture of fear and authoritarianism, a narrow view of music education, and a lack of accountability and transparency. Mazzocchi understands why Baker’s informants would not speak on record; fear of retribution directed toward themselves or their families in Venezuela is very real. Astonished by the clarity of description and critical analysis that he presumed would never be published due to the secretive and retributive nature of El Sistema’s administration, Mazzocchi was deeply saddened that El Sistema had not righted the flaws of its practices he experienced many years earlier. Twenty years after being labeled a “traitor” for leaving El Sistema and feeling virtually blacklisted in Venezuela, Mazzocchi now hopes that the ideals of El Sistema’s rhetoric of “social action through music” will take root outside of Venezuela without the many flaws of the original model. He steadfastly advocates for El Sistema-inspired programs outside of Venezuela whose leaders are willing to recognize the limitations of the Venezuelan System and move forward with music education programs designed and administered in accordance with a fully accountable culture of positive social impact in and through music.\n\nAmid bipolar extremes (i.e., wealth and poverty, raucousness and propriety) music thrived in a variety of social settings in colonial Mexico City. While European concertos, arias, and small chamber pieces could be heard in churches, the viceroyal palace, and the houses of the nobility, popular dances and songs like fandangos, seguidillas, and zarambeques were also common in the streets. In a highly pageant society such as Mexico City's, people were always trying to improve perceptions of their social status and musicians were not the exception. That is why these individuals had to mind not only the music that they played but also the venues where they performed, given that a person's profession, his affiliations, and his context of operation informed views of his social condition. This chapter explores how music, as an institutionalized activity, enabled musicians to seek social mobility in eighteenth-century Mexico City. Literature—and more specifically, poetry— was an important component of music culture in higher social circles because it buttressed music with intellectual overtones that elevated the status of musicians. It was because literature was so important among the elite that poetry gave music a sort of academic and erudite legitimacy in this cultivated milieu. This chapter shows that the connection between literature and music made the latter a vehicle for the expression of elite values and sensibility, which in turn enabled institutionalized musicians to negotiate their social positions in colonial Mexico City."
