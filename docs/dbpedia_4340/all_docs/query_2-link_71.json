        "text": "Hotel de Mendoza was built on the location where the old Santa Maria de Gracia Convent was founded in 1588. Its décor includes art by notable Mexican painter, Raúl Anguiano, and hand-painted furniture by Alejandro Rangel Hidalgo. The convent grounds were later converted into a boutique hotel in 1950, eventually opening as the Hotel de Mendoza some 20 years later. Hotel de Mendoza is now one of Guadalajara’s most esteemed vacation getaways. Located in the heart of the historic downtown area, this historic treasure is just steps from the Teatro Degollado and the Jalisco Philharmonic. Notable attractions close to the hotel also include Templo de San Agustin, Guadalajara Cathedral, Plaza de Armas, University of Guadalajara Assembly Hall, and the UNESCO-recognized Cabañas Cultural Institute.\n\nHotel de Mendoza has been named to these Historic Hotels Worldwide Top Lists"
