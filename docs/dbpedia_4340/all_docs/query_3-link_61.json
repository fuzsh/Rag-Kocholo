Jahrhunderts (1730-1777), p. 642, at the death of Cardinal Carlo Alberto Guidobono Cavalchini, bishop of Ostia e Velletri, dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, on March 7, 1774, it corresponded to Cardinal Gian Francesco Albani, who as bishop of Porto e Santa Rufina and sub-dean of the college, to become the dean. But Cardinal Albani, unhappy with the constitution of Pope Clement XIV, which gave the temporal jurisdiction of Velletri to the S.C.

DELLE LANZE, Carlo Vittorio Amedeo (1712-1784)\n\nBirth. September 1, 1712, Turin. Of a noble family. Eldest of the two children of Carlo Francesco Agostino delle Lanze, count delle Lanze and Vinovo, and Barbara Luigia di Piosacco di Piobesi. The other child was Gabriella Marianna. His godparents were his paternal uncle King Vittorio Amedeo II of Sardinia and his wife, Queen Anna Maria d'Orléans. His first name is also listed as Carlo Vittorio Amedeo Ignazio; and his last name as delle Lancie; and as De Lances. After his mother died on February 2, 1721, he went to Chambéry, because his father had been named governor of Savoia; the country was very troubled by the aftermath of the war and the nightmare of the plague outbreak in Marseille, and the father was involved in the embezzlement of the mercantile middle class; in 1724, he was sentenced to death in absentia and had his assets confiscated; he fled abroad; and ended up settling in Bologna.\n\nEducation. After traveling to the most important European cities, he had started a military career. He was in the Netherlands, in 1730, when he learned that King Vittorio Amedeo II had abdicated. On September 17, he wrote from The Hague to the new king; and a month later, on October 17, he announced the decision to join the Canons Regular of Sainte-Geneviéve in Paris. In those years, Sainte-Geneviéve had acquired notoriety as a place of penance and the outbreak of Jansenist opposition. While he was in his novitiate, his father ordered him to go to Rome, where he became a secular cleric and continued his ecclesiastical studies at the Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles, founded by Pope Clement XI, where young noblemen were prepared for the highest posts of the ecclesiastical prelature. In 1732, he returned to Piedmont, where he continued his studies (philosophy), avoiding all honors and promotions. On April 17, 1734, he obtained the baccellierato in theology at the University of Turin.\n\nEarly life. Adhering himself to the anti-Jesuit and philo-Jansenist ideas of the time, had a crisi di coscienza which his old friends defined as an apostasy.\n\nSacred orders. Received the subdiaconate in 1731, in Tivoli; and the diaconate in 1736. When he became of age, he regained his father's fiefs except Vinovo, but he renewed the cession to the king on October 15, 1732, obtaining in exchange a good pension. On September 23. 1736, he celebrated his first mass in the Barnabite church of S. Dalmazzo, Turin; in that church, he began his first apprenticeship in the care of souls. United still to the academic world, he used to designate part of his assets in support of young students until graduation. His house was a gathering place for those who were passionate about issues pertaining to the reform of the Church and the Jansenist movement. This is why the young cleric had been keeping an eye on those who, like the vicar of the Holy Office, Giovanni Alberto Magliano Alfieri and the supporters of the Jesuits, were following the royalist, the Gallican and the Augustinian doctrines taught by professors at the university who were very close to Father Delle Lanze, such as Frangois Mellet and Thomas Crust. The rapprochement between Rome and Turin led, as a guarantee of loyalty and orthodoxy, to the dismissal of Mellet in 1736; and of Crust in 1739. Father Delle Lanze then leaned to the more clearly orthodoxy of the Augustinian Thomism and of the Antibenignism, of which the University of Turin had two prominent Barnabite figures such as Fathers Francesco Antonio Luciardi and Hyacinthe Sigismond Gerdil, future cardinal; as well as Theatine Father Michele Casati. Abbot of the abbey nullius of S. Giusto di Susa, 1743 to 1749. Grand-almoner and pro-chaplain of the court of his cousin King Carlo Emanuele III of Sardinia, October 17, 1746 until February 1773, when the king died. Abbot commendatario of Lucedio, May 2, 1747. Promoted to the cardinalate at the request of that king.\n\nCardinalate. Created cardinal deacon in the consistory of April 10, 1747; the pope sent him the red biretta with an apostolic brief of April 17, 1747; received the red hat on July 13, 1747; and the deaconry of Ss. Cosma e Damiano, July 31, 1747.\n\nEpiscopate. Elected titular archbishop of Nicosia, August 11, 1747. Consecrated, September 24, 1747, Pauline chapel of the Quirinale palace, Rome, by Pope Benedict XIV, assisted by Cardinal Antonio Saverio Gentili and by Cardinal Giovanni Antonio Guadagni. Opted for the order of priests and the title of S. Sisto, October 2, 1747. Abbot of the abbey nullius of S. Benigno di Fruttuaria, August 5, 1749, where he fixed his residence; he embellished and enriched that church and built a palace that was also used as a seminary; regularly celebrated synods; and was very generous with the poor. From around 1750, the cardinal spent most of his life in the abbey of S. Benigno. He participated in events in the court of Savoy only when it was necessary to give luster to religious ceremonies. On October 12, 1749, he consecrated the church of Superga; on May 31, 1750, at Oulx, he blessed the marriage of the duke of Savoy, the future King Vittorio Amedeo III, and the Infanta of Spain, Maria Antonieta Ferdinanda; shortly after he presided over the ostensione of the Shroud of Turin; and the following year in Milan, he took part in the solemn translation of the body of S. Carlo Borromeo. Participated in the conclave of 1758, which elected Pope Clement XIII. In the conclave, he identified himself with the anti-Jesuit party. Opted for the title of S. Anastasia, November 22, 1758. In 1759, he intervened to obtain the cardinal's hat for the former nuncio in Turin, Ludovico Merlini; and, at the request of the pope, he supported the credentials of Abbot Domenico Morelli, chargé d'affaires of the Holy See in Turin after the departure of Nuncio Merlini. Opted for the title of S. Prassede, March 21, 1763. Participated in the conclave of 1769, which elected Pope Clement XIV. Resigned titular see of Nicosia, April 12, 1773. On October 15, 1773, he was named president of the ecclesiastical council with the task of providing for the absorption of staff and the redistribution of assets formerly belonging to the Society of Jesus. Participated in the conclave of 1774-1775, which elected Pope Pius VI. At the conclave, he arrived with a reputation as protector of the Jesuits, and for this he was not acceptable to the crown cardinals. Secretary of the S.C.of the Tridentine Council, March 22, 1775 until his death; the pope exempted him from the residence in Rome. Shortly thereafter, on December 30, having died the charge d'affaires at Turin, Abbot Morelli, Cardinal Delle Lanze was asked to replace him until the appointment to that position of Abbot Emidio Ziucci, in November 1778. In 1782, the cardinal went to meet Pope Pius VI, who was returning from Vienna, and accompanied him from Ferrara to Imola. Opted for the title of S. Lorenzo in Lucina, July 18, 1783. Cardinal protoprete. He dedicated the income of that title to the cause of beatification of Giuseppe Benedetto Labre, the beggar of Rome who was often lying in front of the palace of Cardinal François-Joachim de Pierres de Bernis, but this cardinal had found nothing in him spiritually significant. He spent his last years in Fruttaria visiting and doing good to the poor families of the town.\n\nDeath. January 25, 1784, at the abbey of S. Benigno di Fruttuaria. According to his will, he was exposed and buried in that abbey's church. In his will, he named the seminary of the abbey, which he had founded, as his sole heir.\n\nBibliography. Barberis, Giulio.
