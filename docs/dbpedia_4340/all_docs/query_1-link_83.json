        "text": "This article explores the vertical aspects of the Jesuit confraternity system in the thirty community towns under Span-ish rule (1609−1767) designated as \" Missions \" or \" Reductions \" in the Río de la Plata region of South America. The principal documents analyzed are the cartas anuas, the annual reports of the Jesuits. The chronological analysis is carried out with a view to tracing the process of integrating the Guaraní Indians into the Spanish colonial regime by means of the religious congregation founded in each Mission town. As a supplementary issue, we deal with the significance of the Spanish word policía (civility) used as a criterion to ascertain the level of culture attained by the Amer-indians. Normally the Jesuits considered members of indigenous confraternities to be endowed with policía, so they used confrater-nities to transplant Christian civility among the Guaraní Indians in the Spanish overseas colony.\n\nRivalry between Jesuit missionaries and Spanish authorities over control of Native populations constituted a common source of political friction in the province of Sonora. Although this antagonism has been recognized for various periods by scholars of the region (Donohue 1969; Spicer 1980), its effects on Pima Alto communities have been, for the most part, only tangentially addressed (see Garate 1999, for an exception). In this article, I examine the structural tensions present in governance of the Pimería Alta during the mid-eighteenth century, paying particular attention to the political mechanisms underlying the bestowal of indigenous authority. In doing so, I highlight the crucial testimonies given by the leaders of the 1751 Pima Revolt, which can be directly attributed to such tensions.\n\nThe Society of Jesus has been characterized as a global order, as it could adapt to different social and political contexts. The initial purpose of the Jesuit province in New Spain was to convert the Indians to Catholicism. However, when the Jesuits arrived they found that the social diversity of the viceroyalty, particularly the large contingent of Creole inhabitants, made it impossible for them to focus solely on the Indians. Consequently, the Order in New Spain had to forge a path between the orders issued by the King of Spain and the General of the Order based in Rome and the needs of the local inhabitants, which resulted in the Province of Mexico acquiring a missionary and educational character. The main aim of this article is to analyze the foundation and development of the Province of Mexico during the generalates of Everard Mercurian and Claudio Acquaviva by examining the institutions they opened, and the different strategies of education and evangelization that they pursued throughout the viceroyalty. It will pay special attention to the designs of the central powers in Europe, the views points and discussions on education and evangelization by actors in New Spain, and how transatlantic decisions on the Order's role in the viceroyalty affected the evolution of the province. To do this, the article will discuss three main aspects of the Jesuits' mission in New Spain, (1) the type of missions and colleges that the Jesuits opened, (2) how Jesuit institutions were shaped according to the group of people that they aimed to evangelize or educate, and in turn (3) how that influenced the languages that the Jesuits taught to the local inhabitants.\n\nEarly in the 19th century, Doña Ana de Iraeta, a member of one of the most important mercantile families in New Spain, vindicated the “representation of sanctity” constructed by the Capuchin religious order centuries before as she sought to have friars from that Order found a first convent in the region of Los Remedios in New Spain. The justifications that Iraeta presented to defend the establishment of the convent included the idea that the friars’ arrival in New Spain would help restore the Monarchical order after the outbreak of the Independence wars in America. This article analyses the scope of the representations surrounding the Capuchin tradition that worked to generate a kind of mythology of the Capuchins, though it proved impossible for the friars to found a convent on Mexican soil until the first decade of the 20th century."
