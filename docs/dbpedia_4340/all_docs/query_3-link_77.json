A collection of over a 100 books from the personal and family library of José Antionio Páez and his descendants, including books signed by Páez himself, the Chilean statesman and journalist Antonio José de Irisarri, and the Mexican author Juan de Dios Peza. Nicknamed 'The Centaur of the Plains', Páez fought alongside the legendary Simón Bólivar against the Spanish Empire in the wars of independence. He later dominated Venezuelan politics, serving as president three times between 1830 and 1863. 90 titles are from 1808 to 1895, while 9 are from 1904 to 1945. Below, you will find a brief history of Páez and a random selection of titles from the collection. Please email for more information. A brief history of Páez The office of President of Venezuela has existed since 1811, when Venezuela declared independence from the Spanish Crown; the first president was Cristóbal Mendoza. From 1821 to 1830, Venezuela was a member state of Gran Colombia, and the Venezuelan executive was absorbed by the Colombian government in Bogotá. When the State of Venezuela became independent from the union, the office of the president was restored under José Antonio Páez. Every head of state of Venezuela since then has held the title of President. José Antonio Páez was a Venezuelan leader who fought against the Spanish Crown under Simón Bólivar during the Venezuelan Wars of Independence. He later led Venezuela's breakaway from Gran Columbia and became a central figure of Venezuelan politics for over two decades. Páez was of humble origins. His father was a low-level employee and he worked in slave-like conditions as a boy. By the age of twenty, he was earning money by trading cattle. In 1810 he began his ascent to power by joining a cavalry regiment led by a former employee of his. The collection comprises over a 100 books from the library of José Antonio Páez and his family, including those signed by Páez himself. There are books signed by the following people: José Antonio Páez Ramon Páez (son of José Antonio, author and naturalist) Catalina Páez CO Páez JA Páez F.Y. Ada Buruaga Sta C.
