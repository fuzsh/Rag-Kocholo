The experimental data were analyzed in terms of the following equation for high temperature deformation: SR â FS n d -p exp(-Q/RT), where SR is the strain rate, FS is the flow stress, d is the grain size, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and n and p are constants termed the stress exponent and the inverse grain size exponent, respectively. The experimental data over a wide range of stresses revealed a transition in stress exponent. Deformation in the low and high stress regions was associated with n about 3 and p about 1, and n about 2 and p about 3, respectively. The transition stress between the two regions decreased with increasing grain size. The activation energy was similar for both regions with a value of about 550 kJ/mol. Microstructural measurements revealed that grains remained essentially equiaxed after the accumulation of large strains, and very limited concurrent grain growths occurred in most experiments. Assessment of possible rate controlling creep mechanisms and comparison with previous studied indicate that in the n=2 region, deformation occurs by a grain boundary sliding process whose rate is independent of impurity content. Deformation in the n=3 region is controlled by an interface reaction that is highly sensitive to impurity content. It is concluded that an increase in impurity content increases yttrium segregation to grain boundaries, which enhances the rate of the interface reaction, thereby decreasing the apparent transition stress between the n=2 and n=3 regions. This unified approach incorporating two sequential mechanisms can rationalize many of the apparently dissimilar results that have been reported previously for deformation of 3YTZ\n\nMol 7C/6\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAberle, J.; Schleisiek, K.; Schmuck, I.; Schmidt, L.; Romer, O.; Weih, G.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe Mol 7C/6 coolant blockage experiment in the Belgian BR2 reactor yielded results different from Mol 7C experiments with low burnup pins: At 10% burnup local failure is not self-limiting, but requires active systems for detection and scram.

[University of Wisconsin-Madison, National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison, Biochemistry Department (United States); Wedell, Jonathan R.; Wenger, R. Kent; Ulrich, Eldon L. [University of Wisconsin-Madison, BioMagResBank, Biochemistry Department (United States); Markley, John L., E-mail: markley@nmrfam.wisc.edu [University of Wisconsin-Madison, National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison, Biochemistry Department (United States)\n\n2015-09-15\n\nMolProbity is a powerful software program for validating structures of proteins and nucleic acids. Although MolProbity includes scripts for batch analysis of structures, because these scripts analyze structures one at a time, they are not well suited for the validation of a large dataset of structures. We have created a version of MolProbity (MolProbity-HTC) that circumvents these limitations and takes advantage of a high-throughput computing cluster by using the HTCondor software. MolProbity-HTC enables the longitudinal analysis of large sets of structures, such as those deposited in the PDB or generated through theoretical computationâtasks that would have been extremely time-consuming using previous versions of MolProbity. We have used MolProbity-HTC to validate the entire PDB, and have developed a new visual chart for the BioMagResBank website that enables users to easily ascertain the quality of each model in an NMR ensemble and to compare the quality of those models to the rest of the PDB.\n\nStructural evolution of plasma-sprayed nanoscale 3 mol% and 5 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia coatings during sintering\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhao, Yan; Gao, Yang\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe microstructure of plasma-sprayed nanostructured yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coatings may change during high-temperature exposure, which would influence the coating performance and service lifetime. In this study, the phase structure and the microstructural evolution of 3YSZ (zirconia-3 mol% yttria) and 5YSZ (zirconia-5 mol% yttria) nanostructured coatings were investigated by means of sintering at 1400 Â°C for 50-100 h. The microhardness, elastic moduli, and thermal shock cycles of the 3YSZ and 5YSZ nanostructured coatings were also investigated. The results showed that the redistribution of yttrium ions at 1400 Â°C caused the continuous increase of monoclinic-phase zirconia, but no obvious inter-splat cracking formed at the cross-sections, even after 100 h. Large voids appeared around the nanoporous zone because of the sintering of nanoscale granules upon high-temperature exposure. The microhardness and elastic moduli of the nanostructured coatings first increased and then decreased with increasing sintering times. The growth rate of the nanograins in the 3YSZ coating was lower than that in 5YSZ, which slowed the changes in 3YSZ coating porosity during sintering. Although the 3YSZ coating was prone to monoclinic phase transition, the experimental results showed that the thermal shock resistance of the 3YSZ coating was better than that of the 5YSZ coating.\n\nA first interpretation of the Mol 7C/l and Mol 7C/2 experiments\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBerthier, J.; Carluec, B.; Fortunato, M.; Lemmet, L.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe interpretation of the two experiments MOL 7C/1 and MOL 7C/2 that has been performed at the CEA of Cadarache is presented here: one will find first a recall of the experimental conditions of the MOL experiments, then a short description of the codes that enable the interpretation and finally the results of this interpretation compared to the experimental results\n\nOn the temperature dependence of flammability limits of gases.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKondo, Shigeo; Takizawa, Kenji; Takahashi, Akifumi; Tokuhashi, Kazuaki\n\n2011-03-15\n\nFlammability limits of several combustible gases were measured at temperatures from 5 to 100 Â°C in a 12-l spherical flask basically following ASHRAE method. The measurements were done for methane, propane, isobutane, ethylene, propylene, dimethyl ether, methyl formate, 1,1-difluoroethane, ammonia, and carbon monoxide. As the temperature rises, the lower flammability limits are gradually shifted down and the upper limits are shifted up. Both the limits shift almost linearly to temperature within the range examined. The linear temperature dependence of the lower flammability limits is explained well using a limiting flame temperature concept at the lower concentration limit (LFL)--'White's rule'. The geometric mean of the flammability limits has been found to be relatively constant for many compounds over the temperature range studied (5-100 Â°C). Based on this fact, the temperature dependence of the upper flammability limit (UFL) can be predicted reasonably using the temperature coefficient calculated for the LFL. However, some compounds such as ethylene and dimethyl ether, in particular, have a more complex temperature dependence. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

[Nisshin Steel Co. Ltd., Tokyo (Japan)\n\n1996-03-31\n\nSome of more important electrolytic solutions for Al electrodeposition are organic solvents, high-temperature type molten salts and low-temperature type molten salts having a melting point of 30{degree}C or lower, such as ethylmethylimidazolium chloride (EMIC). This study uses a molten salt of AlCl3-EMIC as the low-temperature type solution for high-speed electrodeposition. Discussed herein are the effects of melt temperature on limiting current density in Al electrodeposition and Al electrodeposit morphology. Limiting current density increases as melt temperature increases at any AlCl3 concentration used in this study. The AlCl3 concentration that gives the maximum limiting current density shifts from 64 to 67mol% at a melt temperature of 120{degree}C. A dense, smooth Al electrodeposited film results at a melt temperature of 100{degree}C or lower, but the electrodeposited grains become coarser as melt temperature increases. Melt temperature can be increased to 140{degree}C to secure a smooth electrodeposited film, showing possibility of 2 times faster electrodeposition than the conventional one. 21 refs., 12 figs., 1 tab.\n\nPrimary system temperature limits and transient mitigation\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDrucker, G.S.; Bost, D.S.\n\n1978-10-03\n\nResults of a study to determine the limiting temperature conditions in a large reactor system are presented. The study considers a sodium-cooled breeder reactor system having a loop-type primary system configuration. A temperature range of 930 to 1050/sup 0/F in reactor outlet temperature is covered. Significant findings were that the use of the materials for the 930/sup 0/F reference design, i.e., a core material of 20% cold-worked 316 stainless steel, a primary piping material of 316SS, and a steam generator material of unstabilized 2-1/4 Cr - 1 Mo resulted in limiting conditions in component performance at the higher temperatures. Means to circumvent these limits through the use of alternate materials, mitigation of thermal transients, and/or design changes are presented. The economic incentive to make some materials changes is also presented.\n\nANATOMIA DA MADEIRA E CASCA DO ESPINILHO, Acacia caven (Mol.

The main objective is to investigate the consequences of local cooling disturbances in liquid-metal-cooled reactor (LMR) fuel subassemblies. In the tests Mol-7C/4 and MOL-7C/5, fuel pins from KNK II are used with a burnup of 5 and 1.7%, respectively. An active central porous blockage is used to simulate the cooling disturbance. During irradiation, the blockage causes significant local damage, including melting of cladding and fuel. Extensive postirradiation examinations (PIE) are performed to investigate the extent of damage. In this paper a description and interpretation of results of the destructive PIE performed at the Hot Cells Laboratory at KfK is given, along with some conclusions related to LMR safety\n\nTube temperature rise limits: Boiling considerations\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nVanderwater, R.G.\n\n1952-03-26\n\nA revision of tube power limits based on boiling considerations was presented earlier.

The results of four different reaction mechanisms are compared with existing experimental data at an initial temperature of 723 K with ammonia concentrations of 0-20 mol.% and methane concentrations of 2.5-10 mol.%. It is found that the calculation of the auto-ignition limit pressure at constant temperature leads to larger relative deviations between calculated and experimental results than the calculation of the auto-ignition temperature at constant pressure. In addition to the calculations, a reaction path analysis is performed to explain the observed lowering of the auto-ignition limit of methane/air mixtures by ammonia addition. It is found that this decrease is caused by the formation of NO and NO 2 , which enhance the oxidation of methane at low temperatures.\n\nThermochemical reactivity of 5â15 mol% Fe, Co, Ni, Mn-doped cerium oxides in two-step water-splitting cycle for solar hydrogen production\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGokon, Nobuyuki, E-mail: ngokon@eng.niigata-u.ac.jp [Center for Transdisciplinary Research, Niigata University, 8050 Ikarashi 2-nocho, Nishi-ku, Niigata 950-2181 (Japan); Suda, Toshinori [Graduate School of Science and Technology, Niigata University, 8050 Ikarashi 2-nocho, Niigata 950-2181 (Japan); Kodama, Tatsuya [Department of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Niigata University, 8050 Ikarashi 2-nocho, Niigata 950-2181 (Japan)\n\n2015-10-10\n\nHighlights: â¢ 5â15 mol% M-doped ceria are examined for thermochemical two-step water-splitting. â¢ 5 mol% Fe- and Co-doped ceria have stoichiometric production of oxygen and hydrogen. â¢ 10â15 mol% Fe- and Mn-doped ceria showed near-stoichiometric production. - Abstract: The thermochemical two-step water-splitting cycle using transition element-doped cerium oxide (MâCeO{sub 2âÎ´}; M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mn) powders was studied for hydrogen production from water. The oxygen/hydrogen productivity and repeatability of MâCeO{sub 2âÎ´} materials with M doping contents in the 5â15 mol% range were examined using a thermal reduction (TR) temperature of 1500 Â°C and water decomposition (WD) temperatures in the 800â1150 Â°C range. The temperature, steam partial pressure, and steam flow rate in the WD step had an impact on the hydrogen productivity and production rate. 5 mol% Fe- and Co-doped CeO{sub 2âÎ´} enhances hydrogen productivity by up to 25% on average compared to undoped CeO{sub 2}, and shows stable repeatability of stoichiometric oxygen and hydrogen production for the cyclic thermochemical two-step water-splitting reaction. In addition, 5 mol% Mn-doped CeO{sub 2âÎ´}, 10 and 15 mol% Fe- and Mn-doped CeO{sub 2âÎ´} show near stoichiometric reactivities.\n\nMolTalk â a programming library for protein structures and structure analysis\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDiemand, Alexander V; Scheib, Holger\n\n2004-01-01\n\nBackground Two of the mostly unsolved but increasingly urgent problems for modern biologists are a) to quickly and easily analyse protein structures and b) to comprehensively mine the wealth of information, which is distributed along with the 3D co-ordinates by the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

The decay heat of retained fission products can induce high temperatures or high thermal loads on the retention structures or the reactor vessel with consequent fission product release. To assess the long-term coolability of core debris beds the Commission of the European Communities (CEC) decided to coordinate and fund the European PAHR (Post-Accident Heat Removal) program.

Extrapolation of recent experimental data suggests that neither of these conditions is likely to be met near ignition in TFCX, so a low plasma temperature near the limiter should be considered a likely possibility\n\nTemperature and light intensity interaction on Cercospora coffeicola sporulation and conidia germination\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarÃ­lia Goulart da Silva\n\n2016-04-01\n\nFull Text Available ABSTRACT Difficulty in obtaining abundant sporulation in culture of many species of Cercospora may be the limiting factor for studies of biology, systematics, and inoculation of the genus. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the nutritional and environmental requirements that influence mycelial growth, sporulation and germination. As it is difficult to obtain conidia of Cercospora coffeicola in vitro, different temperatures (17, 22, 27, and 32 Â°C and light intensities (80, 160, 240, and 320 Î¼mol m-2 s-1 were evaluated to optimize pathogen sporulation and assess favorable conditions for spore germination, aiming for a strategy of disease control. The dark treatment (0 Î¼mol m-2 s-1 was added for sporulation. A significant interaction was found between temperature and light intensity for both variables. The highest sporulation rate of C. coffeicola occurred at a light intensity of 240 Î¼mol m-2 s-1 and air temperature of 22 Â°C, reaching 5.9x106 con mL-1. Germination was higher at temperature 17 Â°C and light intensity of 320 Î¼mol m-2 s-1, reaching 52%. Interaction between light intensity and temperature proved to influence the processes of sporulation and germination of C. coffeicola.\n\nUniversality of the high-temperature viscosity limit of silicate liquids\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nZheng, Qiuju; Mauro, John C.; Ellison, Adam J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe investigate the high-temperature limit of liquid viscosity by analyzing measured viscosity curves for 946 silicate liquids and 31 other liquids including metallic, molecular, and ionic systems.

During the project, the type of high-temperature superconducting material used evolved from 1st generation (1G) BSCCO-2212 melt cast bulk high-temperature superconductors to 2nd generation (2G) YBCO-based high-temperature superconducting tape. The SFCL employed SuperPower's âMatrixâ technology, that offers modular features to enable scale up to transmission voltage levels. The SFCL consists of individual modules that contain elements and parallel inductors that assist in carrying the current during the fault. A number of these modules are arranged in an m x n array to form the current-limiting matrix.\n\neMolTox: prediction of molecular toxicity with confidence.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJi, Changge; Svensson, Fredrik; Zoufir, Azedine; Bender, Andreas\n\n2018-03-07\n\nIn this work we present eMolTox, a web server for the prediction of potential toxicity associated with a given molecule. 174 toxicology-related in vitro/vivo experimental datasets were used for model construction and Mondrian conformal prediction was used to estimate the confidence of the resulting predictions.

E.; Yarrington, C. D.; Hobbs, M. L.; Abere, M. J.; Adams, D. P.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nA diffusion-limited reaction model was calibrated for Al/Pt multilayers ignited on oxidized silicon, sapphire, and tungsten substrates, as well as for some Al/Pt multilayers ignited as free-standing foils. The model was implemented in a finite element analysis code and used to match experimental burn front velocity data collected from several years of testing at Sandia National Laboratories. Moreover, both the simulations and experiments reveal well-defined quench limits in the total Al + Pt layer (i.e., bilayer) thickness. At these limits, the heat generated from atomic diffusion is insufficient to support a self-propagating wave front on top of the substrates. Quench limits for reactive multilayers are seldom reported and are found to depend on the thermal properties of the individual layers. Here, the diffusion-limited reaction model is generalized to allow for temperature- and composition-dependent material properties, phase change, and anisotropic thermal conductivity. Utilizing this increase in model fidelity, excellent overall agreement is shown between the simulations and experimental results with a single calibrated parameter set. However, the burn front velocities of Al/Pt multilayers ignited on tungsten substrates are over-predicted. Possible sources of error are discussed and a higher activation energy (from 41.9 kJ/mol.at. to 47.5 kJ/mol.at.) is shown to bring the simulations into agreement with the velocity data observed on tungsten substrates. This higher activation energy suggests an inhibited diffusion mechanism present at lower heating rates.\n\nDevelopment of a standard reference material containing 22 chlorinated hydrocarbon gases at 1Â Î¼mol/mol in nitrogen.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLi, Ning; Du, Jian; Yang, Jing; Fan, Qiang; Tian, Wen\n\n2017-11-01\n\nA gas standard mixture containing 22 chlorinated hydrocarbons in high purity nitrogen was prepared using a two-step weighing method and a gasifying apparatus developed in-house. The concentration of each component was determined using a gas chromatograph with flame ionization detection (GC/FID). Linear regression analysis of every component was performed using the gas standard mixture with concentrations ranging from 1 to 10Â Î¼mol/mol, showing the complete gasification of volatile organic compound (VOCs) species in a selected cylinder. Repeatability was also examined to ensure the reliability of the preparation method. In addition, no significant difference was observed between domestic treated and imported treated cylinders, which were conducive to reduction of the cost of raw materials. Moreover, the results of stability testing at different pressures and long-term stability tests indicated that the gas standard at 1Â Î¼mol/mol level with relative expanded uncertainties of 5% was stable above 2Â MPa for a minimum of 12Â months. Finally, a quantity comparison was conducted between the gas standard and a commercial gas standard from Scott Specialty Gases (now Air Liquide America Specialty Gases). The excellent agreement of every species suggested the favorable accuracy of our gas standard. Therefore, this reference material can be applied to routine observation of VOCs and for other purposes.\n\nSelf-limiting growth of ZnO films on (0 0 0 1) sapphire substrates by atomic layer deposition at low temperatures using diethyl-zinc and nitrous oxide\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLin, Yen-Ting; Chung, Ping-Han; Lai, Hung-Wei; Su, Hsin-Lun; Lyu, Dong-Yuan; Yen, Kuo-Yi; Lin, Tai-Yuan; Kung, Chung-Yuan; Gong, Jyh-Rong\n\n2009-01-01\n\nAtomic layer deposition (ALD) of zinc oxide (ZnO) films on (0 0 0 1) sapphire substrates was conducted at low temperatures by using diethyl-zinc (DEZn) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) as precursors. It was found that a monolayer-by-monolayer growth regime occurred at 300 deg. C in a range of DEZn flow rates from 5.7 to 8.7 Î¼mol/min. Furthermore, the temperature self-limiting process window for the ALD-grown ZnO films was also observed ranging from 290 to 310 deg. C. A deposition mechanism is proposed to explain how saturated growth of ZnO is achieved by using DEZn and N 2 O. Transmission spectroscopic studies of the ZnO films prepared in the self-limiting regime show that the transmittances of ZnO films are as high as 80% in visible and near infrared spectra. Experimental results indicate that ZnO films with high optical quality can be achieved by ALD at low temperatures using DEZn and N 2 O precursors.\n\nMol - Research Division Report 1986 - 2\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDelbarre, J.\n\n1987-03-01\n\nThis report covers the research activities carried out at the SCK-CEN, Mol during the second semester of 1986.

This is particularly relevant in the tropics, where organisms are already living close to their upper temperature limits and hence are highly vulnerable to rising temperature. Here we present data on upper temperature limits of 34 tropical marine ectotherm species from seven phyla living in intertidal and subtidal habitats. Short term thermal tolerances and vertical distributions were correlated, i.e., upper shore animals have higher thermal tolerance than lower shore and subtidal animals; however, animals, despite their respective tidal height, were susceptible to the same temperature in the long term. When temperatures were raised by 1Â°C hour(-1, the upper lethal temperature range of intertidal ectotherms was 41-52Â°C, but this range was narrower and reduced to 37-41Â°C in subtidal animals. The rate of temperature change, however, affected intertidal and subtidal animals differently. In chronic heating experiments when temperature was raised weekly or monthly instead of every hour, upper temperature limits of subtidal species decreased from 40Â°C to 35.4Â°C, while the decrease was more than 10Â°C in high shore organisms. Hence in the long term, activity and survival of tropical marine organisms could be compromised just 2-3Â°C above present seawater temperatures. Differences between animals from environments that experience different levels of temperature variability suggest that the physiological mechanisms underlying thermal sensitivity may vary at different rates of warming.\n\nExoMol molecular line lists - XXVII: spectra of C2H4\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMant, Barry P.; Yachmenev, Andrey; Yurchenko, Jonathan Tennyson Sergei N.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nA new line list for ethylene, 12C21H4 is presented. The line list is based on high level ab initiopotential energy and dipole moment surfaces. The potential energy surface is refined by fitting to experimental energies. The line list covers the range up to 7000 cm-1(1.43 Î¼m) with all ro-vibrational transitions (50 billion) with the lower state below 5000 cm-1included and thus should be applicable for temperatures up to 700 K. A technique for computing molecular opacities from vibrational band intensities is proposed and used to provide temperature dependent cross sections of ethylene for shorter wavelength and higher temperatures. When combined with realistic band profiles (such as the proposed three-band model), the vibrational intensity technique offers a cheap but reasonably accurate alternative to the full ro-vibrational calculations at high temperatures and should be reliable for representing molecular opacities. The C2H4 line list, which is called MaYTY, is rmade available in electronic form from the CDS (http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr) and ExoMol (www.exomol.com) databases.\n\nIonic conductivity ageing behaviour of 10 mol.% Sc2O3â1 mol.% CeO2âZrO2 ceramics\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nOmar, Shobit; Bonanos, Nikolaos\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe long-term ionic conductivity behaviour of samples of zirconia co-doped with 10 mol.% of Sc2O3 and 1 mol.% CeO2 is evaluated in oxidizing and reducing atmospheres at 600 Â°C.

It is shown that all these states become more mixed as the temperature increases, approaching the full random state for Tââ. The formalism is then applied to examine the limit temperature for entanglement in a two-qubit XXZ Heisenberg chain, which exhibits the peculiar feature of being independent of the applied magnetic field in the conventional von Neumann based statistics. In contrast, this temperature is shown to be field dependent in a generalized statistics, even for small deviations from the standard form. Results for the Tsallis-based statistics are examined in detail\n\nComparison of measurement capability with 100 Î¼mol/mol of carbon monoxide in nitrogen\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLee, Jeongsoon; Lee, JinBok; Lim, Jeongsik; Tarhan, TanÄ±l; Liu, Hsin-Wang; Aggarwal, Shankar G.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) in nitrogen was one of the first types of gas mixtures used in an international key comparison. The comparison dates back to 1998 (CCQMK1a) [1]. Since then, many National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) have developed calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) for these mixtures. Recently, NMIs in the APMP region have actively participated in international comparisons to provide domestic services. At the 2013 APMP meeting, several NMIs requested a CO comparison to establish CO/N2 certification for industrial applications, which was to be coordinated by KRISS. Consequently, this comparison provides an opportunity for APMP regional NMIs to develop CO/N2 CMC claims. The goal of this supplementary comparison is to support CMC claim for carbon monoxide in the N2 range of 50â2000 Î¼mol/mol. An extended range may be supported as described in the GAWG strategy for comparisons and CMC claims. Main text To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.

However, the effects of heat generated by continuous use have not been studied yet. Therefore, in this work, the variation of optical limiting effect of multi-walled carbon-nanotube suspensions in several kinds of solvents such as distilled water, chloroform, ethanol and ethylene glycol, were measured in the temperature range from room temperature to the boiling point of each solvent. A pulsed Nd : YAG laser with a wavelength of 1064 nm and a pulse duration of 6 ns was used as the light source. The experimental result shows that the limiting efficiencies of all the suspensions were reduced as the temperature was increased and that a suspension with a solvent of lower boiling point, viscosity, and surface tension showed a higher efficiency.\n\nSY-101 Rapid Transfer Project Low Temperature Operations Review and Recommendations to Support Lower Temperature Limits\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHICKMAN, G.L.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe lower temperature limit for the 241 SY-101 RAPID transfer project is currently set at 20 F Based on the analysis and recommendations in this document this limit can be lowered to 0 F.

Following implementation of these changes it is recommended that the system requirements be amended to specify a temperature range for transfer or back dilute evolutions of 0 F to 100 F\n\nOptical power limiting and transmitting properties of cadmium iodide single crystals: Temperature dependence\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMiah, M.

To prevent saturation by helium, the surface is renewed by continuous injection of the surface material (vanadium in this study) into the scrape-off layer. The presence of the injected vanadium leads to plasma temperatures well below 50 eV in the scrape-off layer, with supplementary rf heating. Operation in this edge temperature regime is essential for the use of medium- and high-Z limiter coatings\n\nAustralia's Unprecedented Future Temperature Extremes Under Paris Limits to Warming\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLewis, Sophie C.; King, Andrew D.; Mitchell, Daniel M.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nRecord-breaking temperatures can detrimentally impact ecosystems, infrastructure, and human health. Previous studies show that climate change has influenced some observed extremes, which are expected to become more frequent under enhanced future warming. Understanding the magnitude, as a well as frequency, of such future extremes is critical for limiting detrimental impacts. We focus on temperature changes in Australian regions, including over a major coral reef-building area, and assess the potential magnitude of future extreme temperatures under Paris Agreement global warming targets (1.5Â°C and 2Â°C). Under these limits to global mean warming, we determine a set of projected high-magnitude unprecedented Australian temperature extremes. These include extremes unexpected based on observational temperatures, including current record-breaking events. For example, while the difference in global-average warming during the hottest Australian summer and the 2Â°C Paris target is 1.1Â°C, extremes of 2.4Â°C above the observed summer record are simulated. This example represents a more than doubling of the magnitude of extremes, compared with global mean change, and such temperatures are unexpected based on the observed record alone. Projected extremes do not necessarily scale linearly with mean global warming, and this effect demonstrates the significant potential benefits of limiting warming to 1.5Â°C, compared to 2Â°C or warmer.\n\nThermodynamic and elastic properties of hexagonal ZnO under high temperature\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWang, Feng; Wu, Jinghe; Xia, Chuanhui; Hu, Chenghua; Hu, Chunlian; Zhou, Ping; Shi, Lingna; Ji, Yanling; Zheng, Zhou; Liu, Xiankun\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ A new method is applied to predict crystal constants of hexagonal crystal under high temperature. â¢ Elastic properties of ZnO under high temperature are obtained exactly. â¢ Thermodynamic properties of ZnO under high temperature are attained too. - Abstract: Studies on thermodynamic and elastic properties of hexagonal ZnO (wurtzite structure) under high temperature have not been reported usually from no matter experimental or theoretic methods. In this work, we study these properties by ab-initio together with quasi-harmonic Debye model. The value of C v tends to the Petit and Dulong limit at high temperature under any pressure, 49.73 J/mol K. And C v is greatly limited by pressure at intermediate temperatures. Nevertheless, the limit effect on C v caused by pressure is not obvious under low as well as very high temperature. The thermal expansions along a or c axis are almost same under temperature, which increase with temperature like a parabola. C 11 , C 33 , C 12 and C 13 decrease with temperature a little, which means that mechanics properties are weakened respectively\n\nThe enthalpy of solid scandium in the temperature range 406 - 1812 K\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLyapunov, K.M.; Baginskij, A.V.; Stankus, S.V.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nEnthalpy of pure scandium was measured on massive calorimeter in the range from 406 to 1812 K by mixing method.

Obtained value within the limits of error is compatible with the results given earlier (4009 J/mol). The dependence of the middle specific heat of scandium C p (T) on the temperature was shown in correlation with the results of other works.

The design allows investigations on solid or liquid samples under inert or reactive atmospheres. The working temperature is adjustable; the upper limit that has yet been reached is about 1900 K. TREMPER will facilitate chemical reactivity studies on a temperature level that is difficult to access by other means. First experiments were conducted to study the decomposition of manganese oxide MnO{sub 2}. Chemical analysis of exposed samples confirmed that the parent MnO{sub 2} was decomposed to mixtures of Mn O and Mn{sub 3}O{sub 4}. The amount of Mn O ranged from 60 mol-% in air to 86 mol-% under inert atmosphere.

Major results are as follows; (1) The deformation characteristics of the gaskets were represented by the compressive permanent strain rate (Dp). The temperature and time dependence was shown by Larson-Miller Parameter (LMP). (2) Generally, the high temperature performance limit is obtained by a value of LMP when the Dp value reaches 80%. However, the gaskets (FKM, VMQ, EPDM) used for real transport casks were not damaged and the containment performance was not deteriorated as a conservative condition. (3) Assuming that the service period of the gaskets for transport casks is 3 months or 1 year, the high temperature performance limit of the gasket made of fluorine rubber (FKM) is 202degC or 182degC, respectively, which includes safety margin.

The measurements were carried out with a capillary flow technique. The total experimental uncertainty of viscosity, pressure, temperature, and composition measurements were estimated to be less than 1.6%, 0.05%, 15 mK, and 0.02%, respectively. All experimental and derived results are compared with experimental and calculated values reported in the literature. Extrapolation of the solution viscosity measurements to zero concentration (pure water values) for the given temperature and pressure are in excellent agreement (average absolute deviation, AAD = 0.13%) with the values of pure water viscosity from IAPWS formulation [J. Kestin, J.V. Sengers, B. Kamgar-Parsi, J.M.H. Levelt Sengers, J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 13 (1984) 175-189]. The viscosity data for the solutions as a function of concentration have been interpreted in terms of the extended Jones-Dole equation for strong electrolytes. The values of viscosity A-, B-, and D-coefficients of the extended Jones-Dole equation for the relative viscosity (Î·/Î· ) of aqueous Ni(NO 3 ) 2 solutions as a function of temperature are studied. The derived values of the viscosity A- and B-coefficients were compared with the results predicted by Falkenhagen-Dole theory (limiting law) of electrolyte solutions and the values calculated with the ionic B-coefficient data. The measured values of viscosity for the solutions were also used to calculate the effective rigid molar volumes in the extended Einstein relation for the relative viscosity (Î·/Î· )\n\nPhenomenon of quantum low temperature limit of chemical reaction rates\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGol'danskij, V.I.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nThe influence of quantum-mechanical effects on one of the fundamental laws of chemical kinetics - the Arrhenius law - is considered.

Studies of the low-temperature tunnelling of electrons and hydrogen atoms are briefly mentioned and the history of research on low-temperature radiation-induced solid-phase polymerisation, the development of which led to the discovery of the phenomenon of the low-temperature quantum-mechanical limit for the rates of chemical reactions in relation to the formaldehyde polymerisation reaction, is briefly considered. The results of experiments using low-inertia calorimeters, whereby it is possible to determine directly the average time (tau 0 ) required to add one new link to the polymer chain of formaldehyde during its polymerisation by radiation and during postpolymerisation and to establish that below 80K the increase of tau 0 slows down and that at T approximately equal to 10-4K the time tau 0 reaches a plateau (tau 0 approximately equals 0.01s), are described. Possible explanations of the observed low-temperature limit for the rate of a chemical reaction are critically examined and a semiquantitative explanation is given for this phenomenon, which may be particularly common in combined electronic-confirmational transitions in complex biological molecules and may play a definite role in chemical and biological evolution (cold prehistory of life)\n\nPhenomenon of quantum low temperature limit of chemical reaction rates\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGol' danskii, V I [AN SSSR, Moscow.

The results of experiments using low-inertia calorimeters, whereby it is possible to determine directly the average time (tau/sub 0/) required to add one new link to the polymer chain of formaldehyde during its polymerization by radiation and during postpolymerization and to establish that below 80K the increase of tau/sub 0/ slows down and that at T approximately equal to 10-4K the time tau/sub 0/ reaches a plateau (tau/sub 0/ approximately equals 0.01s), are described. Possible explanations of the observed low-temperature limit for the rate of a chemical reaction are critically examined and a semiquantitative explanation is given for this phenomenon, which may be particularly common in combined electronic-confirmational transitions in complex biological molecules and may play a definite role in chemical and biological evolution (cold prehistory of life).\n\nRelation between Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature and Thermal Work Limit Indices with Body Core Temperature\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMahdi Jalali\n\n2018-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Occupational exposure to heat stress in casting and smelting industries can cause adverse health effects on employees who working in such industries. The present study was set to assess the correlation and agreement of heat stress indices, including wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT, and thermal work limit (TWL, and the deep body temperature indices in workers of several casting and smelting industries located in the vicinity of Tehran, Iran. In This cross-sectional study 40 workers randomly selected and were examined. WBGT and TWL were the indices used for assessing heat stress, and the tympanic temperature and the oral temperature were measured as the heat strain indices. The correlation and agreement of indices were measured using SPSS vs.16. The results of the assessment of WBGT, TWL, the tympanic temperature, and oral temperature showed that 80, 17.5, 40, and 32.5 percent of workers exposed to heat stress higher than permissible limits proposed by standard bodies. Moreover, the present study showed that the significant correlation coefficient between heat stress and heat strain indices was in the range of 0.844- 0.869. Further, there was observed a good agreement between TWL and heat strain indices. The agreement between TWL and the oral temperature was 0.63 (P-valueâ¤ 0.001 and between TWL and tympanic temperature was 0.612 (P-valueâ¤ 0.001. However, the agreement between WBGT and heat strain indices was not satisfactory. These values were 0.154 (P-value â¥ 0.068 and 0.215 (P-valueâ¥ 0.028 for the oral temperature and the tympanic temperature, respectively. The TWL index had a better agreement than WBGT with heat strain indices so TWL index is the better choice for assessing the heat stress in casting and metal smelting industries.\n\nLaboratory hydro-mechanical characterisation of Boom Clay at Essen and Mol\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDeng, Y. F.; Tang, A. M.; Cui, Y. J.; Nguyen, X. P.; Li, X. L.; Wouters, L.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBoom Clay has been selected as a potential host rock formation for the geological disposal of radioactive waste in Belgium. In the present work, the hydro-mechanical behaviour of Boom Clay samples from the borehole Essen-1 at a depth of 220-260 m and from HADES that is the underground rock laboratory at Mol in Belgium, at 223-m depth was investigated in the laboratory by performing low pressure odometer tests (vertical effective stress ranging from 0.05 to 3.2 MPa), high pressure odometer tests (vertical effective stress ranging from 0.125 to 32 MPa), isotropic consolidation tests (confining effective stress ranging from the in situ stress to 20 MPa) and triaxial shear tests. It has been observed that the mineralogy, geotechnical properties and hydro-mechanical behaviour of Boom Clay from Essen at 227-m, 240-m and 248-m depths are similar to that of Boom Clay from Mol. As in the case of Boom Clay at Mol, the failure envelope of Boom Clay at Essen in the p'- q plane is not linear. The slope of the portion beyond the pre-consolidation stress of Boom Clay from Essen is almost the same as that from Mol, suggesting a similar internal friction angle of about 13 deg. The compression curves (void index I v versus logarithm of vertical stress) beyond the pre-consolidation stress are the same for both samples from Mol and Essen, and situated between the intrinsic compression line (ICL) and the sedimentation compression line (SCL). The yield stress determined from odometer tests seems to be stress-path dependent and lower than the pre-consolidation stress. Thus determining the over-consolidation ratio (OCR) using the yield stress value would lead to an incorrect estimate. From a practical point view, the laboratory test results from Essen and their comparison with those from Mol provide important information regarding the transferability of knowledge on Boom Clay at different sites, taking into account the fact that most investigations have been carried out on Boom Clay at\n\nEffect of Ca and Li additions on densification and electrical conductivity of 10 mol% gadolinia-doped ceria prepared by the coprecipitation technique; Efeito de adicoes de litio e calcio na densificacao e na condutividade eletrica da ceria-10% mol gadolinia preparada pela tecnica de co-precipitacao\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPorfirio, T.C.\n\n2010-07-01\n\nCeria containing rare-earth ceramics are potential candidates for application in intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells. One of the main problems related to these ceramic materials is their relatively low sinterability. In this work, the effects of Ca and Li additions on densification and electrical conductivity of 10 mol% gadolinia-doped ceria was investigated. Ceramic compositions containing 1.5 mol% Ca or Li were prepared by the oxalate coprecipitation technique. Results of sintered density and electrical conductivity were compared to those of ceramic samples obtained by solid state reactions showing the effects of the synthesis method on densification and total electrical conductivity of the sintered materials.

From a temperature of 2 K provided by the primary cryogens, magnetic refrigerators could cool bolometers or pumped photoconductors to 0.1 K or below. Such a reduction in operating temperature would increase the sensitivity for bolometers, while the response at longer wavelengths for pumped photoconductors would be improved. Two types of magnetic refrigeration cycles have been proposed. One type uses a complete demagnetization. The present investigation is concerned with the second type, which uses a feedback-controlled isothermal demagnetization, taking into account the temperature stability limits. Attention is given to control system resolution, thermometer noise, reaction time, and thermal time constants.\n\nPreferred temperature and thermal breadth of birds wintering in peninsular Spain: the limited effect of temperature on species distribution\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLuis M. Carrascal\n\n2016-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Background. The availability of environmental energy, as measured by temperature, is expected to limit the abundance and distribution of endotherms wintering at temperate latitudes. A prediction of this hypothesis is that birds should attain their highest abundances in warmer areas. However, there may be a spatial mismatch between species preferred habitats and species preferred temperatures, so some species might end-up wintering in sub-optimal thermal environments. Methods. We model the influence of minimum winter temperature on the relative abundance of 106 terrestrial bird species wintering in peninsular Spain, at 10 Ã10 km2 resolution, using 95%-quantile regressions. We analyze general trends across species on the shape of the response curves, the environmental preferred temperature (at which the species abundance is maximized, the mean temperature in the area of distribution and the thermal breadth (area under the abundance-temperature curve. Results. Temperature explains a low proportion of variation in abundance. The most significant effect is on limiting the maximum potential abundance of species. Considering this upper-limit response, there is a large interspecific variability on the thermal preferences and specialization of species. Overall, there is a preponderance of positive relationships between species abundance and temperature; on average, species attain their maximum abundances in areas 1.9 Â°C warmer than the average temperature available in peninsular Spain. The mean temperature in the area of distribution is lower than the thermal preferences of the species. Discussion. Many species prefer the warmest areas to overwinter, which suggests that temperature imposes important restrictions to birds wintering in the Iberian Peninsula. However, one third of species overwinter in locations colder than their thermal preferences, probably reflecting the interaction between habitat and thermal requirements. There is a high inter\n\nThe effects of moisture on LiD single crystals studied by temperature-programmed decomposition\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDinh, L.N.; Cecala, C.M.; Leckey, J.H.; Balooch, M.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nTemperature-programmed decomposition (TPD) technique was performed on LiOH powders and LiD single crystals previously exposed to different moisture levels. Our results show that the LiOH decomposition process is rate-limited by an inward moving reaction front mechanism with an activation energy barrier of â¼122-149 kJ/mol. The LiOH structure is stable even if kept at 320 K. However, LiOH structures formed on the surface of LiD single crystals during moisture exposure at low dosages may have multiple activation energy barriers, some of which may be much lower than 122 kJ/mol. The rate-limiting mechanism for the decomposition of LiOH structures with reduced activation energy barriers is consistent with a unimolecular nucleation model. We attribute the lowering of the activation energy barrier for the LiOH decomposition to the existence of sub-stoichiometric Li(OH) x with x 2 O formation is observed. The release of H 2 O molecules from LiOH Â· H 2 O structure has small activation energy barriers in the range of 48-69 kJ/mol and follows a unimolecular nucleation process. The loosely bonded H 2 O molecules in the LiOH Â· H 2 O structure can be easily pumped away at room temperature in a reasonable amount of time. Our experiments also suggest that handling LiD single crystals at an elevated temperature of 340 K or more reduces the growth rate of LiOH and LiOH Â· H 2 O significantly\n\nMolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChen, Vincent B.; Arendall, W. Bryan III; Headd, Jeffrey J.; Keedy, Daniel A.; Immormino, Robert M.; Kapral, Gary J.; Murray, Laura W.; Richardson, Jane S.; Richardson, David C.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nMolProbity structure validation will diagnose most local errors in macromolecular crystal structures and help to guide their correction. MolProbity is a structure-validation web service that provides broad-spectrum solidly based evaluation of model quality at both the global and local levels for both proteins and nucleic acids. It relies heavily on the power and sensitivity provided by optimized hydrogen placement and all-atom contact analysis, complemented by updated versions of covalent-geometry and torsion-angle criteria. Some of the local corrections can be performed automatically in MolProbity and all of the diagnostics are presented in chart and graphical forms that help guide manual rebuilding. X-ray crystallography provides a wealth of biologically important molecular data in the form of atomic three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids and increasingly large complexes in multiple forms and states. Advances in automation, in everything from crystallization to data collection to phasing to model building to refinement, have made solving a structure using crystallography easier than ever. However, despite these improvements, local errors that can affect biological interpretation are widespread at low resolution and even high-resolution structures nearly all contain at least a few local errors such as Ramachandran outliers, flipped branched protein side chains and incorrect sugar puckers. It is critical both for the crystallographer and for the end user that there are easy and reliable methods to diagnose and correct these sorts of errors in structures. MolProbity is the authorsâ contribution to helping solve this problem and this article reviews its general capabilities, reports on recent enhancements and usage, and presents evidence that the resulting improvements are now beneficially affecting the global database\n\nUpper limit on the transition temperature for non-ideal Bose gases\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDai Wusheng; Xie Mi\n\n2007-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we show that for a non-ideal Bose gas there exists an upper limit on the transition temperature above which Bose-Einstein condensation cannot occur regardless of the pressure applied.

These measurements, which were performed at temperatures between 800 and 1000 0 C, and for O:M ratios in the range 1.940 to 2.028, are reasonably self-consistent and show good agreement with the results of previous TGA measurements. However, they do not corroborate the earlier EMF cell measurements of Markin and McIver. (1967). Possible explanations for errors in these earlier EMF cell results are examined. The new results indicate that the ÎGsub(O 2 )(mean) of stoichiometric mixed oxide at typical outer surface fuel temperature is close to -100 kcal/mol 0 2 (-419 kJ/mol O 2 ). Attempts have been made to fit the new ÎGsub(O 2 )(mean) data to two equations derived from recent defect models, and it is shown that neither equation accurately represents the experimental psub(O 2 ) - x data over more than a short range of x.

The library consists of two components: HackaMol, the core that contains classes for storing and manipulating molecular information, and HackaMol::X, the extensions that use the core. The core is well-tested, well-documented, and easy to install across computational platforms. The goal of the extensions is to provide a more flexible space for researchers to develop and share new methods. In this application note, we provide a description of the core classes and two extensions: HackaMol::X::Calculator, an abstract calculator that uses code references to generalize interfaces with external programs, and HackaMol::X::Vina, a structured class that provides an interface with the AutoDock Vina docking program.\n\nLow-temperature operating regime of the tokamak evacuating limiter\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTokar', M.Z.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe conditions for realizing the regime of strong recycling of a cold dense plasma of an evacuating limiter were determined based on a previously proposed model for describing the limiter layer of a tokamak. The scaling for the dependence of the gas pressure in the evacuation system on the average plasma density in the limiter layer was found, and agreed quantitatively with the results of measurements on the Alcator and ISX-B tokamaks. For the tokamak reactor of the INTOR scale the calculations show that the low-temperature operating regime of the evacuating limiter can be realized with a quite low pumping rate. It has the advantages of reduced erosion of the limiter and small fluxes of impurities into the working volume of the reactor. In addition, the relative concentration of the helium ash in the limiter layer does not exceed 2-3%, but the density of the main plasma is comparable to the proposed average density in the reactor. The concept of a stochastic limiter is of interest for lowering the plasma density in the limiter layer and lowering the thermal loads on the limiter\n\nCombined effects of elevated temperature and CO2 enhance threat from low temperature hazard to winter wheat growth in North China.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTan, Kaiyan; Zhou, Guangsheng; Lv, Xiaomin; Guo, Jianping; Ren, Sanxue\n\n2018-03-12\n\nWe examined the growth and yield of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) in response to the predicted elevated CO 2 concentration and temperature to determine the mechanism of the combined impacts in North China Plain. An elevated treatment (CO 2 : 600 Î¼mol mol -1 , temperature: +2.5~3.0âÂ°C, ECTI) and a control treatment (ambient CO 2 and temperature, CK) were conducted in open-top chambers from October 2013 to June 2016. Post-winter growth stages of winter wheat largely advanced and shifted to a cooler period of nature season under combined impact of elevated CO 2 and temperature during the entire growing season. The mean temperature and accumulated photosynthetic active radiations (PAR) over the post-winter growing period in ECTI decreased by 0.8-1.5âÂ°C and 10-13%, respectively compared with that in CK, negatively impacted winter wheat growth. As a result, winter wheat in ECTI suffered from low temperature hazards during critical period of floret development and anthesis and grain number per ear was reduced by 10-31% in the three years. Although 1000-kernel weight in ECTI increased by 8-9% mainly due to elevated CO 2 , increasing CO 2 concentration from 400 to 600 Î¼mol mol -1 throughout the growth stage was not able to offset the adverse effect of warming on winter wheat growth and yield.\n\nThe rate-limiting process of hydrogen transport in Mo\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nOhkoshi, Keishiro; Chikazawa, Yoshitaka; Bandourko, V; Yamaguchi, Kenji; Yamawaki, Michio [Tokyo Univ., Tokai, Ibaraki (Japan).

Fuel performance data and design safety criteria are essential for thermal-hydraulic analysis and safety evaluations. Normal and off-normal operation duty cycles and transient classifications are required for the safety assessment of the fuels. The temperature limits of subassemblies were first determined by a steady-state thermal-structural and fuel damage analysis, in which a trial-and-error approach was used to predict the maximum allowable fuel pin temperature that satisfies the design criteria for steady-state normal operation. The steady-state temperature limits were used as the basis of the off-normal transient analysis to assess the safety performance of the fuel for anticipated, unlikely and extremely unlikely events. If the design criteria for the off-normal events are not satisfied, then the subassembly temperature limit is reduced and an iterative procedure is employed until all design criteria are met\n\nPoly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-15 mol% 3hydroxyhexanoate)/ZnO nanocomposites by solvent casting method: a study of optical, surface, and thermal properties\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVishnu Chandar, J.; Shanmugan, S.; Mutharasu, D.; Azlan, A. A.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBiopolymer nanocomposites are gaining interest due to their biodegradable and biocompatible nature, with exceptional properties which are superior to those of pure polymer and that can be used as a replacement for petroleum-based plastics. Pure poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-15 mol% 3hydroxyhexanoate) [P(3HB-co-15 mol% 3HHx)] and ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) reinforced P(3HB-co-15 mol% 3HHx) composite films were prepared and their morphological, optical, and thermal analyses were carried out to study the effect of ZnO NPs on P(3HB-co-15 mol% 3HHx) copolymer. From optical analysis, a strong absorbance peak at Ë358 nm with high intensity for 5%ZnO NPs reinforced P(3HB-co-15 mol% 3HHx) composite sample was observed. Nano-sized particles and their increased trend with increased ZnO NPs concentration were confirmed by UV-Vis spectral analysis. In addition to that, ZnO NPs reduced the reflectance behaviour of P(3HB-co-15 mol% 3HHx) copolymer in the UV region. Field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis evidenced that the pore numbers and their size in the composite matrix was decreased with increased ZnO NPs concentration. Improved thermal stability and melting temperature of the copolymer matrix was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry analysis, respectively. ZnO NPs acted as a retarding agent and showed a low degree of crystallinity (X c ) and enthalpy of melting (ÎH M ). From these observations, ZnO NPs reinforced P(3HB-co-15 mol% 3HHx) composites can be integrated with suitable resin and can be used as an LED encapsulant to block UV rays. They can also be used as a UV blocking coating material in the glass, plastic, and textile industries, for NIR shielding and food packaging applications.\n\nTemperature biofeedback and sleep: limited findings and methodological challenges\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDe Koninck J\n\n2012-10-01\n\nFull Text Available GeneviÃ¨ve Forest,1,2 Cameron van den Heuvel,3 Kurt Lushington,4 Joseph De Koninck21Sleep Laboratory, DÃ©partement de PsychoÃ©ducation et de Psychologie, UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec en Outaouais, Gatineau, QuÃ©bec, Canada; 2Sleep and Dreams Laboratory, School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; 3Research Branch University of Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; 4School of Psychology, Social Work and Social Policy, University of South Australia, South Australia, AustraliaAbstract: Given the close link between body temperature and sleep, the perspective of manipulating core and peripheral temperature by self-regulation techniques is very appealing. We report here on a series of attempts conducted independently in two laboratories to use self-regulation (biofeedback of oral (central and hand (peripheral temperature, and measured the impact on sleep-onset latency, sleep architecture, and circadian phase. We found that hand temperature was more successful than oral temperature biofeedback. Moreover, an increase in hand temperature was associated with reduced sleep-onset latency. However, most participants found the procedure difficult to implement. The temperature response to biofeedback was reduced in the aged and weakest at the time of sleep onset, and there was not a systematic relationship between the change in temperature and change in sleep latency. Methodological limitations and individual differences may account for these results. Recommendations for future research are presented.Keywords: biofeedback, core body temperature, sleep, circadian rhythm, sleep onset\n\nLa esfera, el mol y la ciudad\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHernÃ¡n Neira\n\n2010-06-01\n\nFull Text Available ApoyÃ¡ndonos en la nociÃ³n de \"esfera\" de Slotedijk, analizamos la protecciÃ³n constituida por los moles.

Final report\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSchubert, M.\n\n1995-12-01\n\nFundamental results of the possibility of using high temperature superconductors (HTSC) in resistive fault current limiters are discussed. Measurement of the homogeneity of BSCCO-powder-in-tube materials were made. In addition, investigations of the transition from superconducting to normalconducting state under AC-current conditions were carried out. Based on these results, simulations of HTSC-materials on ceramic substrate were made and recent results are presented. Important results of the investigations are: 1. Current-limiting without external trigger only possible when the critical current density of HTSC exceeds 10 4 A/cm 2 . 2. Inhomogeneities sometimes cause problems with local destruction. This can be solved by parallel-elements or external trigger. 3. Fast current-limiting causes overvoltages which can be reduced by using parallel-elements. (orig.)

[CSIRO, Manufacturing and Infrastructure Technology, Private Bag 33, Clayton South 3169, Victoria (Australia)\n\n2005-01-14\n\nFine grain zirconia-yttria materials are required for enhanced performance in solid oxide fuel cells and related devices and in applications requiring good thermo-mechanical properties. Materials with about 3 mol% Y{sub 2}O{sub 3}-ZrO{sub 2} composition are good electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cell, ceramic membrane oxygen separation and a number of related devices because of their superior mechanical properties and ease of fabrication into thin self-supporting structures in comparison with a material in the 8-10 mol% Y{sub 2}O{sub 3}-ZrO{sub 2} composition range. In this study, sintering behaviour, impedance studies, four-probe DC conductivity measurements and microstructure analysis has been performed on various easy sintering grade materials from two commercial powder suppliers. These materials achieve near theoretical density at sintering temperatures as low as 1350-1400C. For direct comparison of the conductivity and impedance behaviour in easy sintering grade materials, several other 3 mol% Y{sub 2}O{sub 3}-ZrO{sub 2} powders were also investigated. The total ionic conductivity at 850C in easy sintering grade materials is comparable with normal-grade commercial materials of similar composition despite a slightly higher grain boundary impedance at lower temperatures (below circa 450C). There were no obvious differences in the grain boundary thickness, calculated from the impedance data, of normal and easy sintering grade materials.\n\nMulti criteria decision analysis on a waste repository in Mol\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCarle, B.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nIn Belgium, the management of radioactive waste is taken care of by ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian Agency for Radioactive Waste and Enriched Fissile Materials. Local partnerships with stakeholders from municipalities in existing nuclear zones were setup to facilitate the dialogue between the repository designers and the local community. Since the establishment of the partnership in Mol, MONA in February 2000, all aspects of a possible near-surface or a deep geological repository are discussed in 4 working groups by around 50 volunteer members. The outcome of the discussions in the partnership can be a shared project, supported by both local stakeholders and ONDRAF/NIRAS, in which the specifications and the conditions needed for establishing a repository in Mol are elaborated. MONA asked the Decision Strategy Research Department of SCK-CEN to organise a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) in the context of the deciding between a surface and a deep repository for low level radioactive waste. The objective of the multi criteria analysis is to support a number of representatives of the various working groups within MONA in their selection between two acceptable options for a repository of low level radioactive waste on the territory of Mol. The options are the surface repository developed by the working groups of MONA, and a deep repository in the clay layers underneath the nuclear site of Mol. This study should facilitate the selection between both options, or in case this appears to be difficult, at least to get a well-structured overview of all factors (criteria) of importance to the judgement, and to get insight into the degree in which the various criteria contribute to the selection\n\nPreparation of TiO2 Nanocrystallite Powders Coated with 9 mol% ZnO for Cosmetic Applications in Sunscreens\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMoo-Chin Wang\n\n2012-02-01\n\nFull Text Available The preparation of TiO2 nanocrystallite powders coated with and without 9 mol% ZnO has been studied for cosmetic applications in sunscreens by a co-precipitation process using TiCl4 and Zn(NO32Â·6H2O as starting materials. XRD results show that the phases of anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2 coexist for precursor powders without added ZnO (T-0Z and calcined at 523 to 973 K for 2 h. When the T-0Z precursor powders are calcined at 1273 K for 2 h, only the rutile TiO2 appears. In addition, when the TiO2 precursor powders contain 9 mol% ZnO (T-9Z are calcined at 873 to 973 K for 2 h, the crystallized samples are composed of the major phase of rutile TiO2 and the minor phases of anatase TiO2 and Zn2Ti3O8. The analyses of UV/VIS/NIR spectra reveal that the absorption of the T-9Z precursor powders after being calcined has a red-shift effect in the UV range with increasing calcination temperature. Therefore, the TiO2 nanocrystallite powders coated with 9 mol% ZnO can be used"
