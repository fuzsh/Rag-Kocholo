The image captures the young couple's deep connection and the excitement of their upcoming union. Princess Dagmar, born on November 26, 1847, was the eldest daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and Queen Louise of Hesse-Kassel. She was the sister of Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom and the mother of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. The Danish princess was known for her beauty, intelligence, and strong character, making her an ideal match for the powerful and respected Tsar Alexander III. Tsar Alexander III, born on April 3, 1845, was the heir to the Russian throne and the eldest son of Tsar Nicholas I and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. He was a strong and capable leader who modernized the Russian military and implemented political and social reforms. The Tsar was also known for his love of hunting and the outdoors. The couple's engagement was announced on January 18, 1866, and their wedding took place on November 9, 1866, in Copenhagen, Denmark. The union between the Danish princess and the Russian tsarevich was significant as it strengthened the ties between Denmark and Russia and helped to establish a peaceful relationship between the two countries. In this photograph, Princess Dagmar and Tsar Alexander III are seen standing in a beautiful garden, with the sun casting a warm glow over them. The princess is wearing a flowing white dress and a delicate floral crown, while the tsarevich is dressed in a formal military uniform. They are gazing into each other's eyes, their hands gently touching, and their expressions filled with love and happiness. The photograph is a beautiful testament to their deep connection and the beginning of their life together as husband and wife.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down"
