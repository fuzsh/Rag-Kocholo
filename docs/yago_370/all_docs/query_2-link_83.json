        "text": "Intro\n\nAlexandra Feodorovna, born Princess Charlotte of Prussia (1798-1860), was Empress of Russia as the wife of Emperor Nicholas I. They were a close couple and had seven children, including Tsar Alexander II.\n\nPrincess of Prussia\n\nEmpress Alexandra Feodorovna was born as Princess Frederick Louise Charlotte Wilhelmine of Prussia in the Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin on 13 July 1798. She was the eldest surviving daughter and fourth child of Frederick William III, King of Prussia, and Duchess Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and a sister of Frederick William IV and Wilhelm I, German Emperor. She was known as Charlotte, a popular name in the Prussian royal family, and nicknamed Lottchen by her family.\n\nThe princess’ childhood was marked by the Napoleonic wars and difficult economic conditions. Her father was a kind and religious man but a weak and indecisive ruler who lost half his kingdom following the military defeats of 1806. Charlotte’s mother, admired for her beauty, intellect and charm, was considered more strong-willed than her husband.\n\nWhen the Prussians were defeated at the Battle of Jena, Louise fled to Königsberg, taking her children with her, including Charlotte, who was then eight years old. In East Prussia, they received the protection of Tsar Alexander I.\n\n“My daughter Charlotte is reserved and concentrated, but like her father, her seemingly cold appearance conceals the beating of her hot compassionate heart“, wrote Queen Louise about her daughter, who, by the way, always nurtured a special affection and admiration for her heroic mother.\n\nIn December 1809, Queen Louise finally returned to Berlin with her children, but a few months later she fell ill and died of typhus at the age of 34, shortly after Charlotte‘s 12th birthday. As the eldest daughter, she became the ‘First Lady’ of the Kingdom of Prussia, never forgetting her mother’s strength and her ardent Prussian patriotism.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn February 1814, Grand Duke Nicholas Pavlovich, the future Tsar of Russia, and his brother, Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich, visited Berlin. Arrangements were made between the two dynasties for Nicholas to marry Charlotte, then 15 years old, to strengthen the alliance between Russia and Prussia.\n\nNicholas was only second in line to the throne, as the heir was his brother Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich who, like Tsar Alexander I, was childless. On a second visit the following year, Nicholas fell in love with Princess Charlotte, then aged 17.\n\nNicholas was tall and handsome, with classical features. The feeling was mutual: “I like him and am sure of being happy with him”. She wrote to her brother: “What we have in common is our inner life; let the world do as it pleases, in our hearts we have a world of our own”. Hand in hand, the two roamed the Potsdam countryside and attended the Berlin Court Opera. At the end of the visit, in October 1816, Nicholas and Charlotte became engaged.\n\nOn 9 June 1817, Princess Charlotte arrived in Russia with her brother Wilhelm. After arriving in St. Petersburg, she converted to Russian Orthodoxy and took the name Alexandra Feodorovna. On her 19th birthday, 13 July 1817, she and Nicholas were married in the Great Church of the Winter Palace. “I felt myself very, very happy when our hands joined“, she would later write about her marriage. “With complete confidence and trust, I gave my life into the hands of my Nicholas, and he never once betrayed it“.\n\nGranduchess\n\nAt first, Alexandra Feodorovna had trouble adjusting to the Russian court, the change of religion affected her and she was overwhelmed by her new environment. She gained the favour of her mother-in-law, Maria Feodorovna, but did not get on well with Empress Elizaveta Alekseevna, her brother-in-law’s consort. “I was very weak, very pale and (they claimed) very interesting-looking“, she later recalled.\n\nAlexandra Feodorovna spent her early years in Russia trying to learn the language and customs of her adopted country under the tutelage of the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, whom she described as “too much of a poet to be a good tutor“. The imperial family spoke German and wrote their letters in French, a language widespread at the Russian court, and consequently Alexandra never fully mastered the Russian language. The massive, sprawling and ramshackle Russian Empire was also a rather different environment from the compact and efficient Kingdom of Prussia.\n\nAlexandra Feodorovna wrote in her memoirs of her early years in Russia: “We both were truly happy only when we found ourselves alone in our apartments, with me sitting on his knees while he was loving and tender“. After 20 years of marriage, Nicholas still wrote to his wife, whom he affectionately nicknamed ‘Mouffy’, that “rest, happiness, joy, calm: this is what I seek and find in my old Mouffy. I would have liked, as far as it was in my power, to make you a hundred times happier, if I had known how to achieve this”.\n\nFor eight years, during the reign of Tsar Alexander I, the couple lived quietly. Tsar Alexander I had no surviving children and his heir, Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, renounced his succession rights in 1822, making Nicholas heir to the throne.\n\nIn 1825, the Tsar gave Alexandra the Peterhof Palace, where she and Nicholas lived. It remained her favourite summer residence.\n\nPersonality\n\nAlexandra was tall, thin, with a small head and a pronounced forehead. She had an air of regal majesty. Her quick, light walk was graceful. She was frail, often in poor health. Her voice was hoarse but she spoke quickly and decisively.\n\nAlexandra Feodorovna was an avid reader and loved music. She was gentle and loved discretion and simplicity. She dressed elegantly, with a decided preference for light colours, and collected beautiful jewellery. Alexandra loved to dance and was particularly skilled in the mazurka, enjoying court dances until dawn.\n\nNeither arrogant nor frivolous, Alexandra was not lacking in intelligence and had an excellent memory; her readings were quite extensive; her judgement of men was confident, slightly ironic. However, she took no active interest in politics and played the role of empress consort, rather than being active in the public sphere.\n\nEmpress of Russia\n\nAlexandra Feodorovna became empress consort upon her husband’s accession to Tsar Nicholas I in December 1825, during a turbulent period marked by the bloody suppression of the Decembrist revolt. She and her husband were consecrated and crowned in the Cathedral of the Assumption in the Kremlin on 3 September 1826.\n\nAs Empress, Alexandra Feodorovna had no interest in charity work. She was an obedient and admiring supporter of her husband’s ideas.\n\nIn 1832, Nicholas and Alexandra had seven children whom they carefully raised. In 1837, when a large part of the Winter Palace was destroyed by fire, Nicholas reportedly told an aide-de-camp: “Let everything else burn up, only just save for me the small case of letters in my study which my wife wrote to me when she was my betrothed“.\n\nAfter more than twenty-five years of faithfulness, Nicholas took a mistress, Varvara Nelidova, one of Alexandra’s ladies-in-waiting, after doctors had forbidden the empress sexual activity due to her poor health and recurring heart attacks. The empress was obviously very distressed but eventually came to terms with the situation and consoled herself with the knowledge that she would always be the beloved wife, empress, counsellor and confidante that no mistress could ever be.\n\nActually, it is known that Nicholas had at least three illegitimate children born before 1842. The emperor, however, continued to take refuge from state preoccupations in the company of Alexandra. In 1845, Nicholas wept when the court doctors invited the empress to travel to Palermo for several months because of her poor health. “Leave me my wife“, pleaded with the doctors, and when he heard that there was no choice, he made arrangements to join her briefly. During her stay in Palermo, the empress stayed at Villa Butera of the Olivuzza.\n\nAlexandra Feodorovna was always frail and in poor health. At forty, she looked much older than her years, becoming thinner and thinner. For a long time she suffered from a nervous tic that turned into convulsive shaking of her head.\n\nIn 1837 she chose a location in the Crimea as her new residence. There Nicholas ordered the Palace of Oreanda to be built for her. However, she was only able to visit the palace once; in 1852, the Crimean War began. Towards the end of 1854, Alexandra Feodorovna fell ill and was close to death, although she managed to recover. In 1855, Tsar Nicholas I contracted influenza and died, while his beloved wife and eldest son held his hand.\n\nDowager Empress and last years\n\nAlexandra Feodorovna outlived her husband by five years. She retired to the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo and remained on good terms with her late husband’s mistress, Varvara Nelidova, whom she appointed as her personal reader.\n\nAs the years passed, the dowager empress’ health became increasingly fragile. Unable to spend the harsh winters in Russia, she was forced to take long stays abroad, in Switzerland, Nice and Rome. In September 1859 she wrote: “I am homesick for my country and I reproached myself for costing so much money at a time when Russia has need of every ruble. But I cough and my sick lungs cannot go without a southern climate“.\n\nAfter returning from a trip abroad in July 1860, she remained ill. In the autumn of 1860, doctors told her that she would not survive the winter unless she went south again. Aware of the danger, she preferred to stay in St Petersburg so she could die on Russian soil. The night before her death, she was heard to say: ‘Niki, I am coming to you‘. She died in her sleep, aged sixty-two, on 1 November 1860 at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo.\n\nChildren\n\nAlexander (1818-1881) – future Tsar Alexander II – who married Princess Marie of Hesse\n\nMaria (1819-1876), who married Duke Maximilian of Leuchtenberg and later Grigorij Aleksandrovič Stroganov\n\nOlga (1822-1892), who married King Charles I of Württemberg\n\nAlexandra (1825-1844), who married Landgrave Friedrich Wilhelm of Hesse-Kassel\n\nElizaveta (1826-1829)\n\nKonstantin (1827-1892), who married Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg\n\nNicholas (1831-1891), who married Duchess Alexandra of Oldenburg\n\nMichael (1832-1909), who married Princess Cecilie of Baden\n\nFor further reading\n\nMontefiore, Simon.
