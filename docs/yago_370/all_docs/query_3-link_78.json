        "text": "Born Princess Dagmar of Denmark, the daughter of Christian IX, had been betrothed in 1864 to the Tsarevich Nicholas, eldest son of Alexander II, who died before their marriage. At his request his younger brother Alexander proposed and was accepted. Upon her conversion to the Orthodox faith she took the name of Maria Feodorovna, and was married on 28 October/9 November 1866. Following her husband's early death in 1894, she lived in Russia until the revolution, when she went into exile, first in England, then settling in her native Denmark where she died, ten years after the murder of her son Nicholas II and his family."
