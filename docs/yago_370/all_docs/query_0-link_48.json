        "text": "‘Alix’ and ‘Minnie’\n\nThe very first ‘lady of the house’ at Sandringham was Princess Alexandra, who had a particularly close relationship with her sister Dagmar, known to her family affectionately as ‘Minnie’.\n\nBoth girls were born in Copenhagen: Princess Alexandra or “Alix” on December 1, 1844, and Princess Dagmar “Minnie” on November 26, 1847. Although born into a titled family of solid royal stock, Alix and Minnie’s family origins were humble, the sisters didn’t live a lavish childhood in Denmark.\n\nThe two sisters remained incredibly close throughout their life, they looked similar, dressed the same and would play on their likeness when people could not tell them apart!\n\nIf you do visit Sandringham, look out for several places they are featured together around the House to spot their likeness. A drawing can be found in the corridor near the Dining Room, a photograph in the Dining Room dated c1910, and a further photograph with their sister Thyra in the Saloon.\n\nDagmar would go on to marry the future ‘Tsar Alexander III of Russia’ from the Russian imperial family in 1866. She converted to the Orthodox Church and after her marriage became known by the name ‘Maria Feodorovna’. She became ‘Tsarina’ and was extremely popular with the Russian public. Alexandra during this time had married the British Prince Albert Edward, Prince of Wales also known as “Bertie” and later to King Edward VII.\n\nOver the years and decades, the sisters continued to send each other gifts, including ornaments, many of these can be seen in a cabinet in the White Drawing Room in Sandringham House. Amongst the other presents were many items made by Fabergé, this began a group of objects now found within the Royal Collection of Fabergé objects, eventually numbering more than 500. Pendants, photo frames, silver and gold boxes all came into the collection as well as more than 200 carved farm animals, known as the Sandringham Commission.\n\nWhat, then, became of Dagmar during the Russian Revolution that broke out in 1917?\n\nShe managed to flee the country with several Romanovs to England. Sadly, the same did not apply to her son Nicholas – the last Tsar of Russia, his wife and their five children. It is often noted how first cousins Tsar Nicholas and King George V also looked so alike – as their mothers before had.\n\nThere are other items which can be found around the House showcasing the great bond between these two Danish sisters."
