        "text": "Ancestors Descendants\n\nProfile last modified 28 Apr 2024 | Created 24 Dec 2011\n\nThis page has been accessed 5,287 times.\n\nBiography\n\nDaughter of Christian IX Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and Louise Hessen-Kassel, Maria Feodorovna (26 November 1847 – 13 October 1928), christened Dagmar, was a Danish princess who became Empress of Russia as spouse of Emperor Alexander III. She was the second daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Cassel and sister of Britain's Queen Alexandra, and King George I of Greece. Among her children was the last Russian monarch, Emperor Nicholas II, whom she outlived by ten years.\n\nPrincess Marie Sophie Frederikke Dagmar was born at the Yellow Palace in Copenhagen. Her father was Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, a member of a relatively impoverished princely cadet line. Her mother was Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel.\n\nShe was baptized into the Lutheran faith and named after her kinswoman Marie Sophie Fredrica of Hesse-Kassel, Queen Dowager of Denmark as well as the medieval Danish queen, Dagmar of Bohemia. Growing up, she was known by the name Dagmar. Most of her life, she was known as Maria Feodorovna (Russian: Мари́я Фёдоровна), the name which she took when she converted to Orthodoxy immediately before her 1866 marriage to the future Emperor Alexander III. She was known within her family as Minnie.\n\nDagmar was the daughter of Christian of Denmark and Louise Hesse Kassel Rumpenheim.\n\nYou can read more about her and see some wonderful photos here.\n\nSources\n\nWikipedia:Maria_Feodorovna_(Dagmar_of_Denmark)\n\nMaria Fedorovna Romanov on Find A Grave: Memorial #15919288 Retrieved 6 sep 2016.\n\nWikidata: Item Q153601\n\nFind a Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/15919288/maria-fedorovna-romanov : accessed 03 July 2022), memorial page for Maria Fedorovna Romanov (26 Nov 1847–13 Oct 1928), Find a Grave Memorial ID 15919288, citing Saint Peter and Paul Fortress, Saint Petersburg, Saint Petersburg Federal City, Russia ; Maintained by Find a Grave ."
