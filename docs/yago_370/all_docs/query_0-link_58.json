This insightful work—the first in over 40 years and the first in English—traces the empress's tragic life from little known daughter of the King of Denmark, to integral part of the Russian imperial family, through revolution and ruin. The most senior member of the dynasty to survive the Bolsheviks, her word was law among the emigrés and her influence paramount among the surviving Romanovs. She had truly become Matoushka, the mother of the Russian People. She died in Denmark, a tragic relic of a bygone age.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR"
