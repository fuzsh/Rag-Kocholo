        "text": "Alexander III (Russian: Александр III Александрович Романов, romanized: Aleksandr III Aleksandrovich Romanov; 10 March 1845 – 1 November 1894)[1] was Emperor of Russia, King of Congress Poland and Grand Duke of Finland from 13 March 1881 until his death in 1894.[2] He was highly reactionary in domestic affairs and reversed some of the liberal reforms of his father, Alexander II, a policy of \"counter-reforms\" (Russian: контрреформы). Under the influence of Konstantin Pobedonostsev (1827–1907), he acted to maximize his autocratic powers.[citation needed]\n\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is Alexandrovich and the family name is Romanov.\n\nQuick Facts Emperor of Russia, Reign ...\n\nClose\n\nDuring his reign, Russia fought no major wars, and he came to be known as The Peacemaker (Russian: Миротворец, romanized: Mirotvorets, IPA: [mʲɪrɐˈtvorʲɪt͡s]), with the laudatory title of Tsar’-Mirotvorets enduring into 21st century historiography.[3] His major foreign policy achievement was the Russo-French Alliance, a major shift in international relations that eventually embroiled Russia in World War I. His political legacy represented a direct challenge to the European cultural order set forth by German statesman Otto von Bismarck, intermingling Russian influences with the shifting balances of power.[4]\n\nAlexander was known for his striking appearance, a tall, heavy-set man, of enormous muscular strength."
