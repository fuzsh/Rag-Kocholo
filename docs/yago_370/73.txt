Emperor Alexander III of Russia (1845 - 1894) and his wife, Empress Maria Feodorovna (1847 - 1928) photographed in the Fredensborg castle (Denmark) in 1883.

Maria Feodorovna, known before her marriage as Princess Dagmar of Denmark, was the second daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hessel-Kassel. Her eldest son became the last Russian monarch, Emperor Nicholas II.

Alexander III, who was 193 cm tall, was famous for his great physical strength. Once, when he and his family traveled by train, an accident occured and the train overturned. Tsar Alexander allegedly held the roof of the damaged carriage with his hands in order to save his family.

The original photo - here processed and colorized by me - is in the Danish National Museum archive. The photographer was Peter Elfelt.
