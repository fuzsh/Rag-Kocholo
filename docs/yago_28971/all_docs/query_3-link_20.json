        "text": "Carol II is the King of Romania who ruled the Kingdom of Romania since his father Ferdinand I of Romania had been deposed by the Germans in favor of him.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nCarol was born in Peleș Castle. Carol grew up under the thumb of his dominating grand-uncle, King Carol I, who largely excluded his parents, the German-born Crown Prince Ferdinand and the British-born Crown Princess Marie, from any role in bringing him up. Romania in the early 20th century had a famously relaxed \"Latin\" sexual morality, and the British Princess Marie of Edinburgh who despite or perhaps because of her Victorian upbringing ended up \"going native\", having a long series of affairs with various Romanian men with whom she could obtain more emotional and sexual satisfaction than she could with Ferdinand, who fiercely resented being cuckolded. The stern Carol I felt that Marie was unqualified to raise Prince Carol because of her affairs and her young age, as she was only seventeen when Carol was born, while Marie regarded the King as a cold, overbearing tyrant who would crush the life out of her son.\n\nAdditionally, the childless Carol I, who had always wanted a son, treated Prince Carol as his surrogate son and thoroughly spoiled him, indulging his every whim. Ferdinand was a rather shy and weak man who was easily overshadowed by the charismatic Marie, who become the most loved member of the Romanian royal family. Growing up, Carol felt ashamed of his father, whom both his grand-uncle and mother pushed around. Carol's childhood was spent being caught up in an emotional tug-of-war between Carol I and Marie, who had very different ideas about how to raise him. The Romanian historian Marie Bucur described the battle between Carol I and Princess Marie as one between traditional 19th century Prussian conservatism as personified by Carol I versus the 20th century liberal, modernist and sexually liberated values of the \"New Woman\" as personified by Princess Marie. Aspects of both Marie's and Carol I's personalities were present in Carol II. Largely because of the battle between the King and Marie, Carol ended being both spoiled and deprived of love.\n\nTeenage Years and Love Life[]\n\nDuring his teenage years, Carol acquired the \"playboy\" image that was to become his defining persona for the rest of his life. Carol I expressed some concern at the direction that Prince Carol was taking, as the young Prince's only serious interest was stamp collecting and he spent an inordinate amount of time drinking, partying, chasing after women; young Carol fathered at least two illegitimate children by the teenage schoolgirl Maria Martini by the time that he was 19. Carol rapidly become a favorite of gossip columnists around the world owing to the frequent photographs that appeared in the newspapers showing him at various parties with him holding a drink in one hand and a woman in the other.\n\nIn order to teach the Prince the value of the Prussian virtues, the King had the Prince commissioned as an officer into a Prussian guards regiment in 1913. His time with the 1st Prussian Guards regiment did not achieve the desired results, and Carol remained the \"playboy prince\". Romania in the early 20th century was an intensely Francophile nation, indeed perhaps the most Francophile nation in the entire world as the Romanian elite obsessively went about embracing all things French as the model for perfection in everything. To a certain extent, Carol was influenced by the prevailing Francophilia, but at the same time he inherited from Carol I, in the words of the American historian Margaret Sankey, a \"profound love of German militarism\" and the idea that all democratic governments were weak governments.\n\nIn November 1914, Carol joined the Romanian Senate, as the 1866 Constitution guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching maturity. Known more for his romantic misadventures than for any leadership skills, Carol (Romanian for \"Charles\") was first married in the Cathedral Church of Odessa, Ukraine, 31 August 1918 (under the occupation of the Central Powers at that time), to Joanna Marie Valentina Lambrino (b. 1898), known as \"Zizi\", the daughter of a Romanian general, Constantin Lambrino. The fact that Carol technically had deserted as he left his post at the Army without permission to marry Zizi Lambrino caused immense controversy at the time.\n\nBecoming Germany's chosen Puppet Ruler for Romania.[]\n\nRomania during Germany's conquest of the Eastern Front conquered Transylvania and Besirarabia , Germany got it's revenge by conquering Romania and then replacing Ferdinand I with Carol II himself who then took the throne of Romania. The Reason they replaced Ferdinand was because Ferdinand was a Roman Catholic and Carol was Romanian Orthodox which is the state Religion of Romania and his marriage with Zizi, a pure Romanian would be a new Branch of Wilhelm's family. Carol was crowned Carol II of Romania as his wife Zizi Lambrino was crowned Queen Zizi of Romania.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nCarol II is married to Zizi Lambrino and they have one son."
