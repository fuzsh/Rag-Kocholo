        "text": "Of all the royal palaces and castles, Peleş, while without doubt the most beautiful, was also the first royal residence built by Carol I - the first King of Romania, who, together with his wife, Queen Elizabeth, left his mark on this sumptuous residence in Sinaia. The King decided to build a residence worthy of his status as a German prince of the House of Hohenzollern.\n\nTo ensure the full success of his plans, King Carol I drew craftsmen from all over Europe. There were Italian masons, Romanians doing the earthworks, unskilled gypsy laborers, Albanians and Greeks working in the quarry, Germans and Hungarians working as carpenters, and Turks firing bricks. Then there were the Polish craftsmen and Czech stone masons. This while the French did the drawings and the English the measurements.\n\nThe castle is surrounded by splendid parklands - the work of several landscape architects, each of whom left his mark on the park and gardens of Peleş."
