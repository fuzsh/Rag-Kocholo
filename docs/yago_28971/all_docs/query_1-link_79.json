        "text": "Carmen Sylva was the pseudonym of Elisabeth of Wied, born into the royal principality of Wied in 1843. Her father had a keen interest in metaphysics and had published a monograph on the subject.1 Sylva would soon follow in his footsteps and was known for her creativity at a young age. She travelled extensively, visiting Britain several times as a child. In later life, in the summer of 1890, she made a six-week tour of Britain, spending time in London, Llandudno, and Balmoral, the latter of which was at Queen Victoria’s invitation. Her husband, Prince Karl of the prominent Hohenzollern family (or Carol, as he soon became known), became the Sovereign Prince of Romania after a coup had displaced the previous monarch, Alexandru Ioan Cuza. When he [End Page 78] and Sylva were married in 1869, their honeymoon was spent travelling to Romania. Fluent in German, French and English, Sylva soon learnt to speak Romanian and dedicated herself to charitable causes, particularly after the death of her only daughter in 1874. Many contemporary biographers saw Marie’s death as the catalyst for Sylva’s prolific literary output.2 She was first published in a German magazine in 1878 and British interest began soon afterwards. She became a regular feature in periodicals, with articles focusing on her personal life, travels and literary work. Sylva published consistently across her thirty-year career, in genres including novels, poetry, aphorisms, nonfictional articles, and short stories.\n\nGiven her background and life in Romania, it is unlikely that Sylva and Nesbit were acquainted. Nesbit and her husband, Hubert Bland, rarely travelled outside of Britain and would not have socialised in the same circles as Sylva, who did not return to Britain after her tour in 1890. Nesbit was born into a largely middle-class family and spent most of her life in London or Kent. She published in the periodical press throughout her career, beginning in Good Words in 1875.3 Two years later she met Hubert Bland and they married in 1880. Their atypical home life—numerous extramarital affairs and living with her friend, Alice Hoatson (who was also Hubert’s mistress and had given birth to his two illegitimate children)—is generally accepted. Along with her husband, she was one of the founding members of the Fabian Society, a socialist group that allowed Nesbit to circulate with like-minded intellectuals. During her long and prolific career, she published around forty volumes in a variety of genres, although the majority of her oeuvre has subsequently been relegated to the realms of “hack-work.”4 She is now best remembered for her children’s fiction, for creating “a world of magic and inverted logic that was entirely her own”—at the expense of her other writing, which is now largely out of print.5\n\nAlthough different in terms of status and family life, there are some similarities between the two women, not least the “passionate temper and high spirits” that biographers credit as stimulating their literary endeavours.6 Both were prolific, working in a variety of genres and producing novels, fairy tales, short stories, poetry and memoirs. They were also reviewed and advertised alongside each other in lists of new books or soon-to-be-published volumes, suggesting that they were seen as similar writers—at least for marketing and review purposes. Sylva’s collection of fairy tales A Real Queen’s Fairy Book and Nesbit’s The Woodbegoods were both published in 1901 and appeared in lists of recently [End Page 79] published titles, as well as reviews.7 Their contributions to the fairy-tale genre, for example, were often seen as equally inappropriate:\n\nWe cannot offer so warm a welcome to A Real Queen’s Fairy Book (Newnes), by Carmen Sylva, for, though lavishly illustrated and attractively prepared, the stories are not too suitable for children, nor are they very attractively told. A strained sense of beauty is not the best passport to the nursery.… Nine Unlikely Tales (Unwin), another original work, by E. Nesbit, is rich in high spirits, but not always as free from vulgarity as one could wish.8\n\nSylva’s stories, particularly those with a more magical element, often suffered as a result of their perceived vulgarity, which was deemed inappropriate for a young audience. Nesbit’s work received similar criticism. Nevertheless, both women published frequently, sometimes with the same publisher.9 Their short fiction for adults appeared in Belgravia, Good Words, the Lady’s Realm, Pall Mall Magazine and the Strand before being collected in book form: five of Sylva’s folktales were published in periodicals before becoming Legends from River and Mountain (1896) and stories from A Roumanian Vendetta and Other Stories (1903) also appeared in this format before being collected in a book.10 Likewise, seven of the eighteen stories in Nesbit’s The Literary Sense appeared in Pall Mall Magazine between January and July 1903. The similarity of most significance, however, is the fact that both women’s short stories are currently overlooked. Sylva is entirely out of print in Britain and the various collections produced during Nesbit’s lifetime, which range from romantic tales to ghost stories, receive little modern attention.11\n\nThe enduring nature of Nesbit’s children’s fiction is in part due to modern biases. She has become part of a group of “women writers for children” known for her children’s fiction, but failing to be recognised as a more diverse writer.12 Julia Briggs, for example, argues that Nesbit’s adult fiction was written in a “popular, romantic style … primarily to pay the bills,” and it has been forgotten due to its inferior quality.13 It would be naïve to suggest that, given Nesbit’s prolific levels of literary production, she wrote adult short fiction for money and children’s fiction for purely “literary” reasons. The relegation of a significant part of Nesbit’s oeuvre to “bill-paying-fiction” reveals the bias at work in modern canons: literary criticism is intentionally narrow when discussing prolific female authors, for whom the only value of popular writing is financial. Nesbit cannot be “great” at everything; one genre must be elevated above the rest. [End Page 80]\n\nThe financial imperative behind Sylva’s work was also emphasised—seen as conforming to the masses, not creating art.14 Popular fiction was often linked to rapid rates of literary production, which one critic made explicit in an early review of Sylva: her works “follow each other too rapidly for an enduring reputation.”15 The reviewer makes a clear correlation between the quantity of work, the speed of production and the writer’s reputation. In Sylva’s case, she writes too much, too quickly to ever be considered “great.” Nesbit was also criticised for being too prolific and Briggs recounts a letter sent to her by the poet and editor W. E. Henley, in which he advises her to produce fewer poems of a higher quality: “if you do not run the risk of breathlessly making too many—you will do a piece of notable work.”16 The popular becomes puerile, as does the realm of the female writer, writing in “elegant boudoirs, with violet-coloured ink and a ruby pen;… and inexperienced in every form of poverty except poverty of brains.”17 The elitist assumption is that when a popular writing style meets high levels of productivity, the outcome is rushed and thoughtless work; negative associations that imply a low quality and a lack of value. The contrast is with authors like Dickens, known for his prolific output, immense popularity and use of the periodical press, who has nevertheless retained canonical status and is seen as a successful pioneer of serialization.18\n\nThe language used by other reviewers reaffirms this bias. Nesbit’s In Homespun received largely mixed reviews, with one critic describing it as a “stringing together of a few very tolerable magazine stories.… The trail of the journalist is all over them.”19 Unlike The Literary Sense, where a number of stories were published in periodicals before coming together as a collection, there is no evidence that In Homespun has a similar publishing history. It was, in fact, volume twenty-two of John Lane’s Keynotes series, best known for George Egerton’s Keynotes. Egerton’s volume, in its seventh edition by January 1897, just a few months after the publication of In Homespun, attracted more critical attention than Nesbit’s offering—both now and since.20 This is likely connected to literary criticism of the stories. This critic intentionally emphasises the journalistic quality of In Homespun, hinting that this approach has negatively impacted on their style and content. This is also true of Thirteen Ways Home (1901), deemed “pretty little stories of the unexciting sort.… We imagine most of them have appeared in monthly magazines, and it is almost a pity they did not stay there, as they were hardly worth preserving in more permanent form.”21 Popular fiction and, more specifically, popular short fiction published in journals, [End Page 81] which has connotations of mass-market writing produced solely for profit, again comes under fire in comparison with the crafting of more “literary” and “permanent” endeavours. The implication is that stories written for magazines and newspapers, due to the transient nature of ephemera and their mass audience, cannot possess literary value. From the outset, responses to literature are shaped by a set of subjective values that frequently come into conflict with gender, class and education. Attitudes towards popular short fiction in the fin de siècle are undeniably tied to critical elitism. Indeed, Virginia Woolf’s and James Joyce’s beliefs in the superiority of “high art” stemmed from a fear that the swelling population and the rise of both the popular newspaper and the popular novelist would result in the self-determined literary elites becoming obsolete.22 Although Patricia Waugh notes that “certain qualities are more pleasing to our shared human nature than others, and for that reason there is a standard of taste,” these “qualities” are not necessarily shared by all, as shown in the marginalisation of Sylva’s and Nesbit’s short fiction.23\n\nPopular fiction has often been overlooked and devalued, despite the insights it provides into the reading habits of the Victorian public. This is especially true of the short story and its evolution into a genre that is now praised for its formal complexity. Both women undoubtedly made money from their writing, Sylva to fund her various charitable foundations and Nesbit to support her family, but profit was not the sole motive. Their short fiction allowed them to take advantage of the popularity of periodical culture, which had expanded rapidly during the nineteenth century as a result of improved print technology and repeals on paper tax. It was also a medium in which to explore social stereotypes and gender roles in more ambiguous terms. Short fiction by Sylva and Nesbit offers in cultural terms a broader understanding of the fin de siècle, indicative of the interests of the Victorian reader and the high demand for short fiction. Their work seeks a middle ground between old and new, between tradition and progress.\n\nBoth writers’ personal lives, however, are often couched in terms of deviation from the norm. Sylva’s reputation, both during her lifetime and posthumously, has explored her eccentricities. Brigitte Hamann, for example, describes Sylva as “a figure of fun” in a sophisticated Viennese social and cultural milieu and Julia Gelardi has noted how she could be “unpredictable … capricious and eccentric, with a propensity for overacting.”24 Current criticism on Nesbit focuses on her “unconventional feminism”—which Michelle Smith links to her short hair, [End Page 82] smoking and cycling.25 Despite this, both women were often cautious when their ideas appeared in print. Whilst socialising with New Women such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Charlotte Wilson, Nesbit expressed distaste for such issues, lecturing the Fabian Women’s Group on “The Natural Disabilities of Women” in 1908 and rejecting women’s suffrage.26 Opinion pieces written by Sylva in the 1890s are equally reluctant to embrace change. Her views on women’s sporting activities—an issue made topical by the rise of the New Woman and the feminist movement—concluded that women should play sport, but only if they remained true to their femininity.27 Her “disquietude” is founded on a fear that she will see “the chivalrous man slain by the modern Amazon.”28 For Sylva, sport has the potential to destroy traditional ideological boundaries; women were fighting for roles that were not designed for them, with fatal consequences for their male counterparts. These conservative convictions were developed further in 1909, when Sylva stated that woman “is made for her home.”29 Whilst recognising that some women must work, Sylva sees this as a result of necessity, not a desire for independence.\n\nThis rejection of a more liberal attitude does not mean that Sylva wholeheartedly accepted the prevailing ideologies of womanhood, as is true of other women of the period. Writing under the pseudonym “John Strange Winter,” Henrietta Stannard, for example, produced a number of military-based novels, as well as founding and editing a weekly magazine, Golden Gate, which engaged with women’s issues “without an overtly feminist stance.”30 These women presented contemporary debates in far more ambiguous terms. The binary blurring in their work—between female angel and female demon—extends into Nesbit and Sylva’s personal lives as well as their literature. Public recognition of this may have resulted in both women’s work being seen as contradictory or muddled, leading to their eventual marginalisation.\n\nThe dismissal of both writers’ short fiction for adults is a result of the lack of literary value attributed to popular periodical fiction, but also to a certain style of short story; stories with a more moderate engagement with contemporary debates, particularly with regards to the gender controversies of the 1890s. Indeed, D’hoker and Eggermont have noted that women writers of the 1890s are doubly marginalised since\n\nthe normative status of the modernist story continues to overshadow the innovations of fin-de-siècle short fiction, and if the latter is considered at all, it is mainly through the work of writers such as Rudyard Kipling, Henry James, and Joseph Conrad. That the feminist studies have been unable [End Page 83] to change this situation is probably due to the fact that their emphases have been mostly on the feminist potential or aesthetical allegiances of fin-de-siècle women’s writing.31\n\nSylva and Nesbit take this one step further, affected by a triple marginalisation: their work does not fit into the modernist canon, the “feminist potential” of their work is affected by a moderate tone in their writing and their ambiguous engagement with the issue of gender. Finally, their own reputations have been marginalised. Sylva’s writing has been almost entirely forgotten in literary history and Nesbit’s short fiction for adults is subsumed by her stories for children. Nesbit and Sylva do not fit neatly into the modern mould of acceptable women writers and their work brings a literary chiaroscuro to the current view of fin-de-siècle literature, shying away from the polarities prized by many critics. As Schaffer has noted, “any literary critic knows how enormously tempting it is to call a neglected woman writer ‘subversive,’ since that is the accepted way to demonstrate her worth.”32\n\nThe notion of maintaining a moderate interest—achieving balance, rather than extreme opinions—can also refer to political discussions or debates. Many writers grappled with the concept of “moderation” when engaging with one of the most heated topics of the period, the Woman Question, which stimulated serious debate about the role of women in the 1890s without reaching a finite conclusion. The early feminist movement, in continental Europe as well as Britain, called for improvements to women’s status, but also “glorified motherhood as the basis of women’s claim to dignity, equality, or a widened sphere of action in both public and private spheres.”33 Even as women advocated change, they would often distance themselves from association with more radical opinions or behaviour in order to stress the respectability of their movement. As Ann Ardis has highlighted, much of the contemporary discussion could be seen as contradictory, characterised by “boomerang plots,” which “catapult their rebellious heroines back into conventionality or show the next generation’s backlash against their mother’s feminism.”34\n\nThe passive Angel in the House was now joined by the independently minded New Woman, but there was also a third woman, who might be termed the New Angel. She recognised her maternal and wifely duties, but also encouraged social change—and can be frequently found in the fiction of Nesbit and Sylva. The boomerang plots Ardis describes, pushing forward in some ways, but propelled back to tradition in others, allow this New Angel to exist. This is one layer of moderation found [End Page 84] in Nesbit’s and Sylva’s work: the multi-faceted New Angel who blurs traditional and progressive gender roles. Characters cannot be broken down into a composite stereotype, such as the angel or the demon—they are a combination of both. The other moderate element in their writing is that of a “middle ground.” With regards to issues of gender, it favours neither males nor females: both sexes can be responsible for problems and misunderstandings that occur. Mutual change often results in the quintessential “happy ending.” Examining Sylva’s and Nesbit’s work in this light is a way of recognising a hybridity, an “eclecticism and unevenness” that categorised fin-de-siècle writing and complicates the existing understanding of the development of the short story for adults.35\n\nA number of Sylva’s and Nesbit’s stories offer initial emancipation for their female characters before returning them to the role of the traditional carer, creating a mix of personality traits within individual women. Whilst Nesbit shies away from placing women in physical danger, Sylva uses her fiction to show that adherence to the woman-as-angel stereotype is a dangerous level of subservience. In “A Pen and Ink Confession,” Augusta composes a letter to a friend, detailing her husband’s vice, violence and debilitating illness, the birth of her disabled daughter and Augusta’s own love affair. In the initial stages of the narrative, Augusta is constantly described as an “angel” by her troubled husband Reinhold and initially exemplifies the stereotype, nursing him when he becomes ill and being subservient to the extent that she “would stand silently an hour or two and wait silently in the room till it should please him [Reinhold] to turn round and look at me.”36 Augusta sacrifices her own free will to Reinhold’s control, but this apparently appropriate behaviour is soon shown to have extreme consequences. Domestic violence is threaded throughout the narrative. It begins with throwing plates, progresses to an attempted strangulation of their dinner guest, Herbert Krause, and culminates in attacking Augusta: “I do not know rightly what happened next. I have an indistinct recollection of bells ringing, of Reinhold beside himself with fury. I think he struck me.”37 The incident takes place shortly before her daughter’s birth, implying that Reinhold’s violence is responsible for the child’s disabilities. Here, albeit implicitly, we have the strongest indication from Sylva about the dangers of extreme passivity, symbolising the “private rod” within nineteenth-century fiction and society, where violence was concealed from public view and remained outside of legislative and cultural authority.38 [End Page 85]\n\nSylva’s story also makes reference to the “fallen woman” trope. After Reinhold is incarcerated for his violent outbursts, Augusta slips into depression, which is only lifted by the company of Herbert, with whom she soon falls in love. It is here that the moderate New Angel enters the narrative, as Augusta appears to abandon her angelic persona to begin an extramarital affair. She remains by her husband’s side as a result of her overriding sense of duty, which she describes as her “last spring, and although it was a season of storm, tempest and threatening clouds, with only now and then a ray of sunlight and small buds of hope, I felt almost young again when I [Augusta] think of it.”39 The use of pathetic fallacy reflects the nature of her trials and deprivation, the “last spring” symbolising her final taste of freedom before her husband recovers and returns.\n\nStereotypically angelic and demonic characteristics are combined in Augusta, and Selwyn in Nesbit’s ghost story, “The Haunted Inheritance,” also engages with the issue of gender blurring—although in this instance, it is tied to physical concealment, rather than a refusal to accept social norms. In order to scare away the competition for the family estate, her cousin Lawrence, she impersonates one of the ghosts purported to haunt the ruined home. Although she imitates the ghost in white—which locals describe as a woman—descriptions of Selwyn’s do not focus on the feminine; she is simply a ghostly figure.40 As a ghost, she intentionally conceals her identity and is judged by her actions, not her sex. Her actions equalise her with her male cousin, who made the same plan—attempting to scare away the relative he never met but assumed was male. Failure is an equalising tool: Selywn concocts an identical plan to Lawrence’s and achieves the same degree of success (very little). Nesbit’s choice of name supports this reading: it is gender neutral, hence Lawrence’s confusion. We might view Selwyn’s actions as unconventional—a form of selfishly motivated bravery that sees her going against the quiet Angel in the House role and masquerading as a spirit.\n\nThis quality is also found in Mary in “Coals of Fire” who finds herself pregnant and abandoned at the altar, having succumbed to “wickedness” the night before the wedding, thinking there was no “harm in it, and us being so nearly man and wife.”41 The story encapsulates what Stephanie Forward has termed “‘local color’ [sic] writing”; seen not only in the conversational dialects but also in the scandalous events that unfold.42 When Bill returns and offers to marry Mary she remains aloof, standing “like a Queen” and rejecting his advances.43 Despite her current [End Page 86] status—the illegitimate child has transformed Mary into a “fallen woman”—and her mother’s suggestion that he make an “honest woman” of her, Mary stands firm: “‘I’m as honest as I want to be,’ says she, ‘and the child is all my own now.’”44 This clear avowal of independence is recognition of child custody laws, which if they had been married, might have resulted in the loss of the child.45\n\nHowever, the relationships these women initially reject later become the site of their self-sacrifice and martyrdom. Selwyn’s apparent boundary breaking is quickly qualified by her reaction. Once her ghostly deception is revealed she faints into Lawrence’s arms and quickly reverts to a childlike state: “at first she clung to me as a frightened child clings, and her tears were the prettiest, saddest things to see.”46 Lawrence’s increasing attraction towards her stems from Selwyn’s childish—and by extension innocent—behaviour. With the ghosts unmasked, Lawrence suggests that they renovate the house together, and he then proposes. The woman who initially wished to scare Lawrence away is now content to marry him. There is an element of equality here—both wanted the house, worked on it and have now come together in a marriage that will also be a product of two minds rather than patriarchal ownership. Yet this knowledge comes from Lawrence’s perspective—we hear nothing of the marriage and his idea of equality is not revealed to us. This qualifies the story’s ending, returning to a more conservative reading of the relationship.\n\nSimilarly, whilst Augusta’s affair might suggest the need for women to escape a stifling, abusive marriage, she paradoxically opposes change, rejecting the suggestion of separation: “‘don’t say that [Herbert], or all must be over between us. I could not love you any longer if I were faithless.’”47 This blurs the ideological lines within the narrative: a story that appeared to support divorce or separation becomes one that seeks to uphold the sanctity of marriage. By admitting her love for another man, however, Augusta is already being “faithless” to the marital vows to love, honour and obey. This is in keeping with Zimmerman’s argument that she is “zwischen ehelicher und mütterlicher Verpflichtung, zwischen individuellem Freiheits- und Liebeswunsch und der Qual durch ihren psychisch kranken Mann hin- und hergerissen,” (“torn between marital and maternal obligation, between a desire for personal freedom and love and the torment of her mentally ill husband”).48 As a result, “faithlessness” takes on a dual meaning connected to Augusta’s marriage and her religion in an age that “privileged female religiosity.”49 If women were seen to be biologically inferior to men, they made [End Page 87] up for it through morality and Augusta’s recognition of this imperative explains why she turns away from the “un-Christian” path of divorce and remarriage and remains with her family.\n\nRetaining the traditional family structure is encouraged by human influence as well as religious faith. In both “A Pen and Ink Confession” and “Coals of Fire”—stories in which women are linked to men by marriage and children—a doctor is used as a carrier of social expectations. Soon after Reinhold’s attack, Augusta suffers a mental and physical breakdown, yet she paradoxically describes it as “a blessed time for me, one of absolute forgetfulness.”50 Her preference for extreme illness is a clear indication that her current role is unbearable, but this progressive suggestion is instantly refuted through Sylva’s depiction of wider society, epitomised by the respectable doctor. He informs Augusta that she “must learn to be as submissive under this as under [her] other trials.”51 Here readers gain some insight into patriarchal expectations: it is the duty of women to suffer in silence, to keep others happy, and deny themselves. Similarly, when Bill in “Coals of Fire” is found dying—of “weakness” caused by typhoid—he proposes again and Mary accepts without a word of admonishment.52 In doing so, the local doctor states that she has saved his life—explicitly connecting wifely duty with the survival of the family. These stories reflect the medicalization of socially acceptable behaviour in the nineteenth century. They speak to the “moral management” of women, which as Elaine Showalter has argued “substituted close supervision and paternal concern for physical restraint and harsh treatment.”53 Sylva again takes this further than Nesbit, using changes to Augusta’s appearance—her hair prematurely graying—to symbolise her decline. This breakdown is also in keeping with Showalter’s suggestion that a young girl’s increasing awareness of her social dependence—in comparison to men—may well result in an emotional crisis.54\n\nCrucially, both women benefit from their “appropriate” behaviour: once Augusta ends her relationship with Herbert, her daughter Henny stands on her own for the first time, walks and speaks. The juxtaposition of this miracle after an act of female self-renunciation becomes a didactic message that women will be rewarded for their obedience to tradition. This problematises Zimmerman’s assertion that Augusta was “torn”: the loss of Herbert is painful, but the perfect place for Augusta is with her husband and child—a symbolic return to the traditional family unit. Although Augusta recognises that she has “almost become a woman of business,” by taking over from her husband to manage [End Page 88] their finances and household affairs, this is only a minor shift.55 Her agency is confined to that of a household manager, which, as Elizabeth Langland has shown, was tied to discourses of domesticity.56 Mary is also rewarded with stereotypical family life: a convention that she initially rebuffed, but, Nesbit implies, subconsciously desired. Here are the “qualities, here of pathos and there of sincerity,” that a contemporary critic found so commendable.57 Yet we can also see the moderate layering within these stories, whereby the women are not defined by one stereotype, but have a combination of character traits. The flexible femininity shown through characters like Augusta, Mary and Selwyn is testament to the changing attitudes at the end of the nineteenth century; hybridity and “shapeshifting” that, as Heilmann has argued, “make them such emblematic figures of the fin de siècle, an age of multiple contradictions, endings as much as beginnings … not infrequently in the work of one and the same writer.”58\n\nThrough the role of the doctor and the decisions of their female characters, both Sylva and Nesbit resist a more progressive ending—in this instance, Augusta or Mary raising their children alone, or Selwyn running the estate singlehandedly. This oscillation between traditional and progressive may reflect the changeable nature of anti-feminist writing, where, as Valerie Sanders has shown, “the interplay of ideas is more unstable, exposed by ambiguous characterisation and dialogue, uncertain endings, and an undertow of dissent from the apparent ideological direction of the work as a whole.”59 Yet it is difficult to view either Nesbit or Sylva as antifeminist. There may be some didactic elements, in keeping with anti-feminist writing, but there is also violence, abuse and ill treatment. Moreover, there is a streak of independence undercutting their female characters. The women change over the course of their narratives, metamorphosing into New Angels: women who exhibit some degree of self-sufficiency but still advocate the traditional marriage. For Amelia A. Rutledge, “displacement and distancing” by way of elements of fantasy make Nesbit’s work less controversial; an argument that is also applicable to Sylva.60 In this instance, the “fantasy characteristics” are the survival of the male characters, coupled with Mary’s and Augusta’s willing reacceptance of them—elements that conform to conventions of “popular romance” and are woven into the stories in order to achieve a positive outcome.\n\nBoth authors use the short story to deviate from the prescribed levels of propriety found in more conservative writing by women in the nineteenth century, creating a middle ground between anti-feminists [End Page 89] and feminists. They emphasise that the problems that occur within a relationship stem from both men and women and mutual change is often needed to achieve positive resolution. This becomes another layer of moderation within their writing. Neither writer is sitting on the proverbial fence, hence their frequent depictions of vice and mistakes made on both sides. They do not place the same degree of emphasis on female independence as other women writers, but instead allow traditional ideas to coexist with progressive ones. It is not an overt protest or a clear affirmation of traditional ideas, but a push-and-pull narrative that seeks to balance both. There are, however, different levels of change within Sylva’s and Nesbit’s moderate fiction. Both show the significant effects of external influence, which range from the “other woman” to a priest and a dog bite, but the defining factor is the characters’ response. Success, defined as staying with their partners but admitting mutual guilt and changing their attitudes, is open to Sylva’s couples because they embrace change. Ironically, this moderate outcome is often achieved by violent, extreme means. In “Shaded Canvasses” and “Nine Days,” injury is pivotal to the positive outcome.\n\n“Nine Days” is an amalgamation of boundary breaking and almost simultaneous affirmation of tradition, exploring the representation of adultery, loveless marriages and illness after a woman and her husband are bitten by a rabid dog in a Romanian town; themes in keeping with New Realist short stories produced at the end of the nineteenth century, which often focused on the taboo.61 Undercutting the sensational content is an ironic twist: impending death brings the characters back to life. The narrator, Anna, hints in the initial stages of the story that she and her husband possess little more than a marriage of convenience, remarking that “years had passed since the time we had lived together in harmony of thought and feeling; all was over between us.”62 After many hooks and hints, she reveals that adultery—on both sides—is the cause of their marital strife: “since the time I discovered he was unfaithful to me I had never said a kind word to him, or tried to brighten his hard life. I took all my pleasures and enjoyment with others, at first to show him I did not care and afterwards because it amused me.”63 Anna’s complicated relationship with the Angel in the House ideology is emphasised here. She has intentionally adopted the “fallen woman” mantra to counterbalance her husband’s behaviour. Yet focus remains on mutual responsibility for the breakdown of the marriage, a quality shared by Frosi and Matthes in “Shaded Canvasses,” who are the quintessential perfect couple but possess a misplaced pride that [End Page 90] threatens to ruin their relationship after Matthes is accidentally shot. The accident results in an emotional separation and physical violence against Frosi. The local priest can only persuade her to stay with Matthes by appealing to her pride and this is portrayed as her fundamental flaw, for which she must be physically punished in accordance with the biblical saying “pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”64 The priest performs a similar function to the doctor in “A Pen and Ink Confession,” albeit adding moral rather than scientific weight to his arguments. However, the priest’s presence enhances the moderate layering in the story, since he visits both Matthes and Frosi to encourage change. Accordingly, both parties develop over the course of the narrative and admit their guilt.\n\nAll four characters are punished for their behaviour—Louis and Anna face impending death; Matthes is shot at the wedding after refusing to heed his wife’s advice; and Frosi becomes noticeably thinner, breaks down in tears and is “feverish,” with “glittering” eyes and “burning cheeks.”65 The imagery of illness symbolises both her physical and emotional breakdown and indicates that the destruction of Frosi’s character is necessary to the narrative. Matthes’s injury is also vital, echoing the conclusion of Jane Eyre, in which Rochester’s accident is designed to bring about what Patricia Meyer Spacks has described as “a marriage of ideal reciprocity.”66 Likewise, Louis and Anna’s shared experience—the fatal dog bite—causes them to reconnect as a couple. Looking at their child, Anna “felt now so full of courage that I stroked Louis’s hand as we sat together by the child’s bed, and said ‘Even this anxiety is easy to bear, because we share it and are together and live.’”67 From failing to make even visual contact, having “long ago left looking full at each other,” there is now physical touch.68 Moreover, the softness and reassurance of stroking his hand is indicative of a fundamental change in their relationship. Sylva structures her stories around a central conflict and its eventual resolution to indicate that violent tragedy can be transformed into positive change within a marriage. Both women’s agency may eventually focus on their husbands—returning to the female passivity and affirmation of the “separate spheres” ideology found in Augusta’s characterisation—but Sylva closes her stories with mutual appreciation and redemption. As Stephanie Forward has argued, many women remained in favour of marriage, hoping to instigate change by “promoting the ideals of equality and freedom of choice.… no single view can be claimed as absolutely representative of the period.”69 Sylva’s short fiction exemplifies this argument, reflecting the [End Page 91] fluidity of approach to gender relations and the repercussions for those who have ingested the flawed belief systems of their societies. Acting out a prescribed role can only bring destruction if there is no change or improvement.\n\nNesbit, in contrast, focuses on social impediments or the personal, emotional barriers that must be broken down to orchestrate change. Her moderate tone is achieved by more moderate events. The outcome of “The Unfaithful Lover,” for example, is negative because her couple avoid the problems they face and refuse to act against society’s expectations. Problems are brought about by the “literary sense”—ideas encountered whilst reading that they believe should be replicated in real life. The story focuses on a couple’s separation after the unnamed male protagonist confesses to kissing another woman at a dance and takes a more tragic turn than most of Sylva’s, who often allows her redeemable couples to change and reconcile, albeit with severe physical scars. Here, the anonymous woman responds hysterically to her lover’s confession rather than saying what she really feels, for “what opinion would he form of the purity of her mind, the innocence of her soul, if an incident like this failed to shock her deeply?”70 Paradoxically, she remains anxious about his opinion, even though he admits to an error. Her identity—and the stereotypical feminine purity she strives for—is tied to this emotional response. She believes that she can meet societal expectations by going against her own nature, which urges her to forgive him. For Nesbit, “literary sense” means a lack of common sense, but this accusation is not levelled at the female characters alone. Her lover leaves angrily—without paying for their tea and cake—as “he, also, had what she never suspected in him—the literary sense.”71 This blind faith in doing what is expected leads him to join the army and die of enteric. Destiny, as the story’s sardonic narrator concludes, “is almost without the literary sense.”72 The male lover perishes abroad and the woman remains unmarried and unloved, leaving Nesbit to end her story with the message that lives are ruined as a result of adherence to social expectations.\n\nRejecting the whisperings of wider society brings its own benefits, as shown in “Cinderella,” deemed “negligible” by Julia Briggs.73 This story goes one step further to demonstrate that misunderstandings are not limited to love-struck young people, but occur irrespective of age. Problems are again society based, in keeping with Nesbit’s other stories, but the external influences are more passive: gossip and rumours cause Harry and Charling to leave their families. When Charling discovers [End Page 92] that her father has gone away to be married, she runs away, afraid of being “‘kept under’ by this strange lady, who would come and sit in her own mother’s place, wear her own mother’s clothes, no doubt presently burn her own mother’s picture, and make Charling wash the dishes and sweep the kitchen like poor dear Cinderella.”74 As with the other characters in this collection, there is a clear link between a simple misunderstanding and the “literary sense”—in this case, an awareness of a fairy tale. The father’s remarriage is instantly linked to the literary trope of the evil stepmother and the ill treatment of the paternal daughter. The increasingly hyperbolic expectations for the stepmother are indicative not only of Charling’s age—her childish fears are quickly blown out of proportion—but also the effects of the well-known story on an impressionable mind. Yet this passage also reveals an independent streak in the young girl, who rejects the white-knight stereotype, for although “Cinderella’s misfortunes ended in marriage with a prince … Charling did not wish to be married, and she had but little faith in princes.”75"
