        "text": "HRH Prince Carol of Romania, who has died aged 86, spent much of his life in the quest to prove his legitimacy.\n\nHis paternity was never in doubt. He was the son of Crown Prince Carol of Romania (later King Carol II) and Jeanne Marie (Zizi) Lambrino, an aristocratic Romanian girl whom the future King had married in contravention of the rules of the Royal House.\n\nCarol's birth caused grave problems. His father was the eldest son and heir of King Ferdinand I and Queen Marie (daughter of the Duke of Edinburgh - later Duke of Saxe-Coburg - and thus a granddaughter of Queen Victoria). The Crown Prince was handsome and intelligent, but not without an element of instability in his character. He was also highly sexed, some believing that he suffered from satyriasis. Anatomical descriptions, when overheard, were mistaken for descriptions of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nAs the result of being trained by a socialistic Swiss tutor, doubts were sown in his mind about the merits of royal life. Madly in love with Zizi, he took her over the Russian border from Jassy, thus effectively deserting from the Army, a crime punishable by death. The pair were married in Odessa on September 14 1918. The Crown Prince's mother, Queen Marie, described the crisis as \"a staggering family tragedy which hit us suddenly, a stunning blow for which we were entirely unprepared\".\n\nA week later Queen Marie had the Crown Prince confined in a monastery, while his bride returned to Jassy, feverishly searching for an announcement of her wedding. Then King Ferdinand forced an annulment in January 1919 at Bucharest. But Carol remained attached to Zizi, who was by now expecting his child. When pressed to rejoin his regiment, he renounced his rights to the throne \"for me and my heirs as well\", serving this notice on August 1 1919. Queen Marie forced Carol and Zizi to remain apart, and at Christmas a promise was extracted from him that he would renounce Zizi totally.\n\nOn January 8 1920 the son was born in Bucharest, and registered as Mircea Grigore Carol Lambrino, the name he used for most of his early life. That the father's name was not put on his birth certificate was \"another danger overcome\", as Queen Marie put it. One day the Crown Prince wrote to Zizi that they would soon be the \"most united family possible\", but the next that they could not remarry in Romania - and that if they went away \"it would be la misère noire\". The Crown Prince was then sent on an eight-month cruise to cool down.\n\nSince the marriage had been legal, and the annulment not published until April 23 1919, the birth of the child was within the 300-day period allowed to permit legitimacy. To this day, different branches of the family question the legality of the annulment and the consequent rights of Prince Carol. The reality was that he was excluded from the Romanian Royal Family.\n\nThe Crown Prince never saw his wife again, nor did he visit his newborn son, for which Zizi never forgave him. The boy later claimed to have seen his father only once, when he was five. The Crown Prince resumed his position as heir to the throne, while the child and his mother were dispatched to Paris, Zizi being asked to return family jewels in exchange for an allowance, and ordered never to return to Romania.\n\nIn 1926 Zizi fought a 10 million franc case in the Paris courts for damages incurred by grief over her divorce. To support her son, she resumed her life as a dancer, while he was educated at the Académie des Beaux Arts and trained as an artist; he later painted landscapes and his own Christmas cards.\n\nMeanwhile, the Crown Prince married Princess Helen of Greece, and had a second son, the present King Michael, only to desert her for Elena (Magda) Lupescu, causing a further crisis in the Romanian Royal House. When King Ferdinand died, the young Michael succeeded, reigning from 1927 to 1930, whereupon Carol became King until 1940, when he handed the throne back to his son, who was finally driven out of Romania in 1947.\n\nWhen the Communists took over, the small stipend sent to Zizi ceased. In 1945 Carol had travelled to Brazil to appeal to his father for funds, but was forbidden to see him. Zizi eventually died in the charity ward of a Paris hospital in March 1953, Carol cabling his father in vain for funds to bury her. Within a month ex-King Carol died in Portugal.\n\nCarol Lambrino worked as a bookbinder in Paris, though by 1957 he was out of a job, explaining that people no longer bought the kind of artistically designed de luxe leather books that were his speciality.\n\nAfter his father's death, Carol began the long battle to establish his legitimacy, winning court actions in Portugal in 1955, and again in Paris in 1957. He assumed the title of Prince of Romania, and the style of Royal Highness, though Romania was by then under Communist rule.\n\nPrince Carol settled in Britain, taking a 21-year lease in 1961 at favourable rates on Upton House at Poole, Dorset, which had been left to the local corporation by the former Conservative minister Lord Llewellin.\n\nBut there were endless financial problems, threats of eviction, a gardener refusing to work because he had not been paid for 26 weeks and unpaid grocery bills of several hundred pounds. In 1964 Prince Carol was granted letters of administration on his father's English property worth £5,922. Soon afterwards the media decided that he was a wealthy man, with varying estimates as to his newly inherited fortune.\n\nThere was talk of property on the French Riviera, though all that seemed to remain was a villa in Nice. In 1964 he bought Winterfold House at Cranleigh, Surrey, for a mooted £100,000. In June 1965 both these homes were searched by police and dogs following a tip-off that the escaped train robber Ronnie Biggs might be in hiding there: he wasn't.\n\nLater the Prince sold decorative fashion belts in Hampstead, using the Romanian crown as his trademark. That he was presently living in Montagu Square in London as a picture-frame restorer implies that the hoped-for fortune never fully materialised.\n\nPrince Carol was married three times, first in Paris, in 1944, to Hélène Nagavitzine. Their son, Paul, born in 1948, was educated at Gordonstoun and Millfield, and later wrote a biography of his grandfather, King Carol.\n\nThe Prince and Hélène separated in the early 1950s, and she went on to sing leading roles in Mozart and Puccini operas in Paris under the name of Lena Pastor. They divorced in 1960, and soon afterwards Lena was complaining to her lawyers and the press that she could not have her son for a promised eight-day Christmas holiday. She was determined that he lead a normal life \"away from these dreams of royalty. That is what ruined my marriage with his father.\"\n\nIn 1960 Carol married Jeanne Williams, from Nashville, Tennessee, with whom he had a further son, Alexander, who was born in 1961 and educated at Ampleforth. By 1970 Carol and his second wife were living apart, and in 1975 there were legal battles over the custody of their son. They divorced in 1977 and in 1984 he married Mrs Antonia Ropner, daughter of Major-General Edward Colville and a niece of the Queen's taciturn former Press Secretary, Commander Sir Richard Colville.\n\nIn 2003, after a long court case, a Romanian court recognised Prince Carol's legitimacy and his birth certificate was altered accordingly. The former King Michael contested the decision; the Romanian Supreme Court has yet to rule on his appeal.\n\nNot long before he died Prince Carol visited Romania to look into the possibility of reclaiming some of his father's properties.\n\nPrince Carol, who died on January 27, is survived by his third wife. His last wish was to be buried near King Carol, whose remains were returned to Bucharest in 2003."
