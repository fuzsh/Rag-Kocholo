His domestic life was a constant source of scandal, marked as it was by a morganatic marriage with an officer’s daughter, Zizi Lambrino; a second unhappy marriage to Helen, daughter of King Constantine I of Greece; and a continuing liaison with a Jewish adventuress, Magda Lupescu—an affair that finally obliged him to renounce his rights to the throne and go into exile (1925).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
