        "text": "The present paper attempts to touch upon some aspects related to well-known fairy tales and to the ways in which these reflect a people’s national identity, as well as common national stereotypes. We start from the assumption that fairy tales constitute the most common expression of Romanian traditional folklore, being representative of a typically oral culture. Fairy tales seem to appear predominantly in developed societies, where the individual tends to partly distance himself from the community as a whole. In fairy tales, the individual’s moral fibre, as well as his emotions, do not solely apply to the characters in the narrative story, but also extend to the narrator himself. We shall focus on two of the most common Romanian fairy tale characters, referring also to the two-fold nature of the story: on the one hand, the conscious and maybe superficial purpose of entertaining the reader, and on the other hand, their deep, unconscious cathartic nature.\n\nAbstract The body of fairy folklore is one important factor in defining the spiritual identity of a culture and even of a whole nation. The oldest strata of religious practices and spiritual beliefs in Romania are detectable within the fairy lore - and I believe it is safe to assume that this holds true for other cultures as well. In losing fairy traditions by allowing them to be distorted beyond recognition or plainly erased from a culture’s patrimony, we get one step closer to spiritual annihilation through severing the connection with ancient roots. Romanian fairy folklore, once extremely rich, is gradually recovering from times and events that nearly brought it to extinction. The reclamation efforts began long ago, but they only started to come to fruition in more significant ways in the years after the fall Communist regime, which happened in 1989. This paper gives a brief overview of: - how fairy lore and practices changed first through assimilation into Christianity; - fairy lore mutilation, and its survival through the policy of spiritual annihilation imposed by the dictatorial regime; - ongoing reclamation process, importance, and impact.\n\nIn the following paper, the authors analyze the prevalence of princess culture in the literature, film, and visual culture of young people. The authors, an art educator, art historian, and professor of English literature, propose creative interventions through alternative resources and readings. Focusing on foundations of media studies and literature of Fairy-Tale Studies and girlhood studies, this interdisciplinary collaboration investigates complex creative predicaments of girlhood and princess media. Utilizing Princess Aurora and Sleeping Beauty as a case study and focal point, the authors discuss their collaborative arts research intended to explore problems and possibilities of princess culture.\n\nThe present article’s purpose is to examine the relationship between History and Fiction in the Middle Ages through the example of The Romance of Melusine, a romantic novel written by Jean D’ Arras and, more specifically, how this powerful fairy founded the dynasty of the Lusignans. In any event, no medieval history would be complete without an account of this powerful dynasty, for it is argued that the story of the “fairy of the feudal imagination”1 has much to tell us about the Middle Ages. It is to be questioned how the author, the readers and the Lusignans themselves reacted to this tale. To what degree did the Lusignans think that their origins derived from Melusine’s lineage? Moreover, did Jean d’ Arras consider himself a novelist or a historiographer? And lastly, what did the readers feel about Melusine and her reactions? These and many more questions about the beautiful fairy, from whom more than a century of kings from Armenia to Scotland are descended, will be discussed.\n\nArt as propaganda is traditionally thought to be used as a tool of monarchs in cementing their role. In addition to coins with the king's face and seals featuring the king in majesty, the king's face could also appear on public art such as statues, stained glass, and even frescoes. This essay seeks to understand four pieces of stonework visible to the medieval public which would have featured two fourteenth-century queens of Hungary: Elizabeth of Poland (d. 1380), wife of Charles I Robert, and Elizabeth of Bosnia (d. 1387), wife of Louis I 'the Great' (r. 1342-1382)."
