        "text": "by Scott Mehl © Unofficial Royalty 2014\n\nKing Carol I of Romania was born on April 20, 1839, at Sigmaringen Castle in Sigmaringen, Principality of Hohenzollern, now in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. At the time, he was Prince Karl Eitel Friedrich Zephyrinus Ludwig of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, second son of Karl Anton, The Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Princess Josephine of Baden.\n\nCarol had five siblings:\n\nLeopold, Prince of Hohenzollern (1835–1905), married Infanta Antónia of Portugal, daughter of Queen Maria II of Portugal, had three children including King Ferdinand of Romania\n\nStephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1837–1859), married King Pedro V of Portugal, no children\n\nAnton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1841–1866), died in battle at age 24\n\nFriedrich of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1843–1904), married Louise of Thurn and Taxis, no children\n\nMarie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1845–1912), married Philippe of Belgium, Count of Flanders, had five children including Albert I, King of the Belgians\n\nWhen Karl was 11 years old, his father abdicated as the sovereign Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, and the principality was annexed by Prussia. Karl embarked on a military career, becoming an officer in the Prussian forces. Due to political unrest in what was then called the Romanian United Principalities, the former Ruling Prince (Domnitor) – Alexander Ioan Cuza – was forced to abdicate in February 1866. Due largely to the familial relationship with the French Emperor Napoleon III and the Prussian monarchs, Karl was elected by the Romanian government to become the new Ruling Prince on April 20, 1866 – his 27th birthday.\n\nKarl arrived in Romania on May 10, 1866, and declared his allegiance to his new country, taking on the more Romanian spelling of his name – Carol. Soon after the country established its first Constitution, and formally changed the name to Romania – beginning the steps toward eventual independence from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn 1861, while he was still Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Carol had met Princess Elisabeth of Wied. After meeting again in 1869 when Carol was touring Europe searching for a bride, the couple was married in Neuwied, Principality of Wied, now in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany on November 15, 1869. They had one daughter – Maria – born on September 8, 1870. Maria died of scarlet fever on April 9, 1874, and Elisabeth never fully recovered from the loss of her only child.\n\nIn the Russo-Turkish War of 1877, Romania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire and joined forces with Russia. The following year, Romania was formally established as an independent nation under the Treaty of Berlin. Three years later, on March 15, 1881, the Romanian parliament declared Romania a Kingdom, and Karl became King Carol I. His coronation was held on May 10, 1881, the 15th anniversary of his arrival in Romania. He was crowned with the Steel Crown, made from the steel of a cannon captured from the Ottomans during the Russo-Turkish War.\n\nFollowing a reign of more than 48 years, King Carol I died on October 10, 1914, in Sinaia, Romania. He is buried in the royal crypt at the Monastery of Curtea de Argeș in Curtea de Argeș, Romania. King Carol I was succeeded by his nephew, King Ferdinand I, the second son of his elder brother Leopold.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
