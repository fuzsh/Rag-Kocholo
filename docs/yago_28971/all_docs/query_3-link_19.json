        "text": "King Michael I of Romania\n\n(1921 - 2017, Reigned 1927-1930 and 1940 - 1947)\n\nPhotograph of King Michael as a child of eight on the royal terrace at Sinaia.\n\nMichael IÂ (bornÂ 25 October 1921 â died 5 December 2017) was the last King of Romania, reigning from 20 July 1927 to 8 June 1930 and again from 6 September 1940 until his abdication on 30 December 1947.Â Michael was born inÂ Sinaia, Romania, the son of King Carol IIÂ (then Crown PrinceÂ of Romania) and Princess Elena of Greece.Â He was the grandson of then-reigning KingÂ Ferdinand I.Â Â He married Princess Anne of Bourbon-ParmaÂ in 1948 with whom he had five daughters and eventually settled in Switzerland.Â\n\nKing Michael had two periods as theÂ reigning monarch of Romania : the first was fromÂ 20 July 1927 â 8 June 1930, after hisÂ father’s forced renunciation of the throne, as a minor he reignedÂ with a Regency Council. The second period of reign was fromÂ 6 September 1940 â 30 December 1947, after his father, King Carol, was deposed, until he was forced to abdicate and go into exile by the Communists. Nicolae Ceausescu's communist dictatorshipÂ was overthrown in 1989Â and the following year Michael attempted to return to Romania, only to be arrested and forced to leave upon arrival. In 1992, Michael was allowed to visit Romania forÂ EasterÂ where he was greeted by huge crowds; a speech he gave from his hotel window drew an estimated one million people toÂ Bucharest. Alarmed by Michael's popularity, the government refused to allow him any further visits. In 1997, afterÂ the presidential elections of the previous year, Michael's citizenship was restored and he was allowed to visit Romania again. Several confiscated properties, such as Peles CastleÂ andÂ Savarsin CastleÂ were eventually returned to his family.\n\nPlease click on the following link to read an obituary from The Telegraph from 7 December 2017.\n\nKing Carol II of Romania\n\n(1893 - 1953, reigned 1930 - 1940)\n\nKing Carol II is seen on the right in this photograph, wearing medals, with a Romanian army, British-made Tank in 1940\n\nKing Ferdinand I of Romania\n\n(1865-1927, reigned 1914 - 1927)\n\nKing Ferdinand I of Romania photographed in 1925\n\nCarmen Sylva\n\n(1843-1916) Poet and Queen of Romania (Regina Elisabeta)\n\nCarmen Sylva\n\n(H.M. Queen Elisabeth of Romania)\n\nPauline Elisabeth Ottilie Luise zu Wied (Schloss Monrepos, Neuwied, 29 December 1843 - Curtea de ArgeÅ or Bucharest, 3 March/2 November 1916) was the Queen Consort of King Carol I of Romania, widely known by her literary name of Carmen Sylva.\n\nBorn in Neuwied, she was the daughter of German Prince Hermann of Wied and his wife Marie, daughter of Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau (and sister of Grand Duke Adolphe of Luxembourg). She was a prospective bride for Edward VII of the United Kingdom, then Prince of Wales. She first met the future king of Romania at Berlin in 1861, and was married to him on 15 November 1869 in Neuwied. Her only child, a daughter, Maria, died in 1874.\n\nIn the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 she devoted herself to the care of the wounded, and founded the Order of Elizabeth (a gold cross on a blue ribbon) to reward distinguished service in such work. She fostered the higher education of women in Romania, and established societies for various charitable objects.\n\nEarly distinguished by her excellence as a pianist, organist and singer, she also showed considerable ability in painting and illuminating; but a lively poetic imagination led her to the path of literature, and more especially to poetry, folk-lore and ballads. In addition to numerous original works she put into literary form many of the legends current among the Romanian peasantry.\n\nShe was the 835th Dame of the Royal Order of Queen Maria Luisa.\n\nWikipedia contributors, 'Elisabeth of Wied', Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, 13 November 2008, 04:54 UTC, <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elisabeth_of_Wied&oldid=251497414>\n\nA signed photo of Queen Elizabeth of Romania (the authoress 'Carmen Sylva')\n\nA letter written on behalf of Queen Elizabeth of Romania (the authoress 'Carmen Sylva') by her Private Secretary in August, 1907.\n\nQueen Marie\n\n(1875-1938) Writer\n\nMarie of Romania in a photograph used by the English press in October 1914, just after she became Queen.\n\nPrincess Marie of Edinburgh (Marie Alexandra Victoria; later Queen of Romania; 29 October 1875 – 10 July/18 July 1938) was a member of the British Royal Family who became the queen consort of Ferdinand I of Romania.\n\nShe was born on October 29, 1875, at Eastwell Park in Kent, the eldest daughter of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh and Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia. Her father was the second-eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Her mother was the only surviving daughter of Alexander II of Russia and Maria Alexandrovna of Hesse. She was baptised in the Private Chapel of Windsor Castle on December 15, 1875 and her godparents were the Empress and Tsarevitch of Russia, the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the Princess of Wales and the Duke of Connaught. As her father was in the Royal Navy she spent much of her time abroad, particularly in Malta.\n\nIn her youth, Princess Marie was considered a suitable match for marriage to the royalty of Europe. Her first cousin, Prince George of Wales, later King George V, fell in love with her and proposed marriage. Marie's father and George's father approved of the marriage, but Marie's mother disdained the British Royal Family and was keen to see her daughters marry outside its court.\n\nPrincess Marie married Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania, nephew of King Carol I of Romania in Sigmaringen, Germany on 10 January 1893. The bride was 17 years old and the groom was 10 years her senior. (Marie's father did not become Duke of Coburg-Gotha until a few months later.) The marriage, which produced three daughters and three sons, was not a happy one. Her correspondence with her longtime secret confidante, the American dancer Gerte Fuller, revealed \"the distaste, which grew to revulsion\" that Marie felt for her husband.[2] The last two children were born after Marie met her long-time lover, Barbu Åtirbey, and historians generally agree that Prince Mircea was his son (having brown eyes like Åtirbey, unlike Marie and Ferdinand),[3] while Ileana's paternity is under discussion, as was her second daughter, Princess Maria,the future Queen of Yugoslavia (known as Mignon) Their eldest sons, Carol and Nicholas, and eldest daughter, Elisabeth, were quite certainly biologically Ferdinand's.\n\nQueen Anne of Romania\n\n(b 18 September 1923 died 1 August 2016\n\nQueen Anne, consort of King Michael of Romania\n\nPlease click on the following link to read an obituary from The Telegraph Website from 1st August 2016\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/08/01/queen-anne-of-romania--obituary/"
