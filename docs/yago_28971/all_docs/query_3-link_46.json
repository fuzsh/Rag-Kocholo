        "text": "In the pre-war press, Prince Carol (often Anglicized as “Charles”) of Romania was often suggested as a likely husband for either Olga or Tatiana. Certainly there was some truth to the Olga rumor, given that the Imperial Family did visit Romania in 1914 with a vague hope of a possible engagement, but it seems as if in reality it was not Olga or Tatiana, but Maria who interested Carol. [A]t one time [Olga] was mentioned as a possible bride for the Crown Prince of Roumania. But the Grand Duchess did not like him, and, as the Crown Prince liked the Grand Duchess Marie better than her sister, nothing came of the project. - Lili Dehn, The Real Tsaritsa The Emperor was almost uninterruptedly at Mohileff during the summer and early autumn of 1916. He came back for short spells, both in October and November. During this second stay a slight stir was caused at Court by the visit of the Crown Prince Carol of Rumania - his second visit to Russia. This was the last time a State dinner was given. It was marked by the first official appearance of the Grand Duchess Marie, the Emperor’s third daughter. She looked extremely pretty in her pale blue dress, wearing the diamonds that her parents gave to each of their daughters on her sixteenth birthday. Poor child! she felt that the world was coming to an end and that she was disgraced in its eyes for ever, when she slipped in her new high-heeled shoes and fell down as she was entering the dining-hall, on the arm of a tall Grand Duke. On hearing the noise, the Emperor remarked jokingly, “Of course, fat Marie.” - Sophie Buxhoevenden, The Life and Tragedy of Alexandra Feodorovna In 1916 Prince Carol again visited the Russian Court, and now his young man’s fancy rested on Marie. He made a formal proposal for her hand, but the Emperor, declaring that Marie was nothing more than a schoolgirl, good-naturedly laughed the Prince’s proposal aside. - Anna Vyrubova, Memories of the Russian Court Carol proved himself to be an exceptionally poor choice of a royal husband. He married “Zizi” Lambrino, the daughter of a Romanian general, in 1918. The marriage was annulled in 1919, but the couple continued to live together and had a son, Mircea, in 1920. In 1921, Carol married Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark, daughter of King Constantine I. A son, Mihai (Michael) was born less then 9 months later. By 1925 the marriage had broken down, with Carol quite openly having an affair with Magda Lupescu, another Romanian commoner. Helen wanted to try and make the marriage work, both on matters of faith and because of their son, but finally divorced him in 1928. Carol married Magda in 1947, after 22 years together."
