Most of us want a tangible gift on our birthday. Actor Santosh Shukla who you have last seen on Bigg Boss 6 and previously on Koi Sapno Ke Deep Jalaye, Jai Santoshi Maa, Jai Jai Shiv Shankar and Adaalat, feels that his perfect gift on his birthday today (2 July 2013) would be the woman of his dreams. Despite being an actor, he feels that the perfect soul-mate for him would be a girl who doesn’t wear makeup or contact lenses. “I would like God to gift me on my birthday a girl who is from a poor family and is sweet, simple and honest. She shouldn’t be cunning a bit. She should love and accept me the way I am, instead of trying to change me. She should respect my parents. She should be pretty from within and on the exterior too. If there is a girl like that she may email me,” laughs the good looking actor. If he could have gifted himself something today, he would have met Sakshi Tanwar to propose her. He expresses his fondness of Sakshi, “I am a die-hard fan of the actress. In fact I want to get married to her. If she turns down my proposal, that would be okay too.” Though he is yet to avail the gift of his perfect soul-mate or win Sakshi’s hand in marriage, Salman Khan has made this blessed day special by gifting him a delicious cake today. They are in Hyderabad today busy shooting for their upcoming film Mental. Santosh may also go with the cast and crew of this film for a merry get-together after pack up to celebrate this day. His career related birthday wish is to be immersed in work in good projects all year round. Pondering on his worst birthday, he candidly says that it was five years back, when a relationship he was in, came to an end. “I simply do not wish to think of that birthday. With Mahadev’s blessings I overcame the grief.” He feels that he is celebrating his best birthday today as he is shooting with the superstar Salman Khan, who he admires so much. If he could have gone on a birthday vacation, he feels the best holiday would be spending some quality family time with his parents in his hometown in Lucknow. He then went on to joke that another holiday option would have been visiting Goa accompanied by his loneliness. We wish that the actor is lonely no more and finds his life partner soon.
