        "text": "MUMBAI (ANI) – As the curtains closed on Bigg Boss OTT Season 3, Ranvir Shorey, who finished as the second runner-up, shared his thoughts on his intense journey through the reality show.\n\nThe season concluded with TV actor Sana Makbul emerging as the winner, while rapper Naezy claimed the runner-up spot.\n\n“Five ke baad three tak aagaya, bahaut hai,” he remarked, acknowledging his significant progress in the show.\n\nShorey went on to discuss the nature of the competition, stating, “The one who receives Bigg Boss’s favor and gets more votes wins–that’s how life is.”\n\nReflecting on the challenges of participating in Bigg Boss OTT 3, Shorey admitted, “Staying away from family for 42 days and living with 15 strangers away from the outside world was very challenging.”\n\nHe described the experience as “very tough,” highlighting the difficulties he faced while confined in the house.\n\nDespite the intense environment, Shorey took away valuable lessons and experiences.\n\n“I’ve created memories that will stay with me forever. The difficulties inside the house make it a very tough experience,” he shared.\n\nHis time on the show also brought about significant personal growth, as he noted, “I’ve learned a lot, gained experience, and created lasting memories.”\n\nThroughout the season, Shorey formed strong connections with several housemates, including Armaan Malik, Deepak Chaurasia, and Kritika Malik.\n\nHowever, he also encountered conflicts with some contestants, saying, “I had good bonds with many people, but not with everyone. Sana Makbul, Lavkesh, Vishal, and Shivani were among those with whom there were some conflicts.”\n\nShorey expressed his gratitude towards the audience for their support, especially given his absence from social media.\n\n“Reaching the top 3 is entirely due to the audience’s support,” he emphasized.\n\nLooking ahead, Shorey said, “My core ambition is not to win a reality show; it lies in filmmaking and acting. I am coming out after 42 days, I hope to face new challenges,” he said."
