We Are the Lamp and the Wick) is an Indian television soap opera that aired on StarPlus from 29 August 2011 to 10 September 2016 and comprised 1,487 episodes.[3][4] It was produced under Shashi Sumeet Productions. It stars Anas Rashid and Deepika Singh.[5]\n\nSet on the backdrop of Pushkar, Rajasthan, Diya Aur Baati Hum focused on breaking the stereotypical image of women in rural India by showing the inspirational journey of Sandhya Rathi, whose ambition is to become an IPS officer. She achieves her goal with the help of her husband, Sooraj, by going against all odds.[6]\n\nA sequel series, Tu Sooraj Main Saanjh, Piyaji starring Rhea Sharma and Avinesh Rekhi, aired from 3 April 2017 to 1 June 2018.[7]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAmbitious and educated, Sandhya Kothari aspires to fulfill her dream of being an IPS officer for her father Arvind. Sooraj Rathi, a partially-educated and simple young master-confectioner is the perfect elder heir to his middle-class traditional family in Pushkar, Rajasthan. Later, Sandhya is shattered as her parents die in a terrorist attack. Her brother Ankur fixes her marriage to Sooraj whose strict mother, Santosh, wants a simple and uneducated daughter-in-law, with the excellent skills of a housewife. So, Ankur lies about Sandhya's education level.\n\nGiving up her education and dreams, Sandhya marries Sooraj. Soon as her truth of being educated and not knowing cooking is revealed, Santosh banishes her. Sooraj stands up for and vows to help Sandhya in becoming the daughter-in-law Santosh wants. After helping Sandhya complete studies, Sooraj convinces Santosh to accept her dreams. Sandhya faces challenges in IPS Academy, establishing as an extraordinary police officer. She fights terrorist leader Raj Kumar, and struggles to balance between her professional duties and domestic responsibilities.\n\nTogether with Sooraj, Sandhya forms a relationship with underlying love. She donates one of her kidneys to Santosh battling for life, a fact which the family later learns. Ankur's daughter Bulbul greatly eagers for a sibling but his wife Ankita miscarries and is unable to conceive again. Sandhya, expecting twins, decides to give their one twin to Ankita. Eventually, she delivers twin sons Ved and Vansh who get kidnapped. In the rescue, Ved is saved and the unfound Vansh is presumed dead, shattering all. A police officer saves and returns Vansh though promptly.\n\n7 years later\n\n[edit]\n\nSandhya, Sooraj and Ved live happily. They find out Vansh never died and was adopted by Ankur, who planned the past things to keep Vansh with them. As Sooraj dreams of opening a big hotel and works for it with Sandhya, she is appointed for an extremely perilous mission Mahabhali, to defeat a dangerous terrorist in his territory in West Bengal, faking her identity as Sagarika. Sandhya leaves and enacts to be presumed dead in a train accident. Sooraj loses his dreams and mental stability due to this shock. Owing to his condition, Santosh starts hating Sandhya.\n\nSantosh wants Sooraj to marry Laalima Agarwal, who she believes will be able to help him recover. Sandhya battles with the difficulties of Mahabhali and finally sabotages their plan, but her identity is exposed. The terrorists capture and almost torture her to death. Sooraj finds out Sandhya is alive, and joins her on the mission to help. They complete the mission and return home. Santosh refuses to forgive Sandhya. Laalima falls in love with Sooraj.\n\nBut, Sooraj and Sandhya's love wins and Santosh forgives her as Laalima gives up. Later, Sooraj's youngest brother Mohit is shot to death after attempting to molest Laalima by Santosh. With the help of women's rights activists, Sandhya bails her out.\n\nSanthosh hates Pakistan because of a tragic accident on the border which took her younger brother's life when they were children. Not knowing Arzoo is from Pakistan, she fixes her alliance with Aryan. At first, Sandhya suspects Arzoo of being a terrorist.\n\nLater, Sandhya not only saves Arzoo from the terrible misunderstanding but also helps her get accepted by Santosh. Sooraj meets with an accident and gets stuck in a wheelchair. Sandhya decides to run his confectionery shop by leaving her job, much to Sooraj, and the family's displeasure.\n\nAs Sandhya delivers a daughter named Kanak, Sooraj overcomes his disability and is able to walk to run his shop. Sandhya gets a proposal from commissioner and joins the police again before meeting IPS Arpita Khanna, who considers Sandhya as her rival at first but later becomes among her best allies.\n\nSoon, Vansh discovers the truth about his birth parents but hates them for giving him away. Four terrorists kill Ankur and Ankita and also take the residents of the Rathis' neighborhood hostage, including them. Sandhya and Sooraj bravely rescue the civilians.\n\nUpon seeing his parents' selflessness and courage, Vansh forgives them and the family is reunited, but not for long. Sandhya and Sooraj unsuccessfully try a trap for the terrorists and punish them. The leader kidnaps Kanak and makes Sandhya and Sooraj eat bomb pills.\n\nSandhya and Sooraj bid their farewell to family and others by jumping into the river before exploding. Sandhya's mangal sutra and Sooraj's chain becomes entangled in the water before the setting Sun, highlighting that even death cannot separate them.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMain\n\n[edit]\n\nDeepika Singh as IPS Sandhya Kothari Rathi: Arvind and Kanchan's daughter; Ankur's sister; Sooraj's wife; Ved, Vansh and Kanak's mother (2011–2016)\n\nAnas Rashid as Sooraj Rathi: Arun and Santosh's eldest son; Vikram, Mohit and Chavvi's brother; Om's cousin; Sandhya's husband; Ved, Vansh and Kanak's father (2011–2016)\n\nRecurring\n\n[edit]\n\nNeelu Vaghela as Santosh \"Bhaboo\" Rathi: Arun's wife; Sooraj, Vikram, Mohit and Chhavi's mother; Mishri, Pari, Golu, Ved, Vansh and Kanak's grandmother.

I just based my show Diya Aur Baati Hum on this incident, which was still afresh in my memory.\n\n— Sumeet Mittal during January 2012[17]\n\nSpeaking about the series before its premiere, Nitin Vaidya, the Business Head of StarPlus then said, \"It's undeniable that in India, traditionally the women's role is seen as bride, wife or mother, within the geographical parameters of her home. This show aims at breaking that mold and raising public acceptance of women stepping out of their homes towards self-fulfillment. Diya Aur Bati Hum is another testimony of Star Plus' programming ethos – 'Rishta Wahi, Soch Nayi (Same relationship, different thinking)'.\"[18]\n\nOn 8 January 2013, the cast and crew went to Ajmer to shoot a sequence, expected to return to Mumbai on 11 January 2013.

However, Rituraj Singh got the role due to the creative differences with Khan.[28] In April 2015, Randeep Rai, who was cast for the role Adult Chotu, quit the series in few months and was replaced by Kunal Khosla in January 2016.[29][30] In November 2015, Varun Jain playing Mohit wished to opt out of the series unhappy with his role shaping up and thus his character was killed in the series.[31][32]\n\nCancellation and future\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to its fluctuating ratings, it was reported to go off air on 15 August 2016.[33] But, it received an extension for about a month and ended on 10 September 2016.[34] However, before the series was about to end, it was reported to come back with a sequel series owing its popularity.[35] Within seven months, the sequel titled as Tu Sooraj Main Saanjh, Piyaji premiered and aired from 3 April 2017 to 1 June 2018 for 365 episodes.[36]\n\nFilming\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series is based on the backdrop of Pushkar, Rajasthan.[37][38] The series is mainly filmed on the sets created in Mira road, Mumbai.[39][40] Some of the scenes were filmed in Rajasthan including Pushkar, Ajmer and Bikaner.[41] The final scene of the series was filmed in Udaipur.[42] In June 2012, the sequence of lead character Sooraj's cooking competition was filmed in Singapore for 10 days.[43] For that, the upcoming episodes were shot well in advance before going there such that shooting did not happen for 12 days after it in India.[44]\n\nFrom December 2013 for a few months, the main IPS training sequence of lead character Sandhya was shot at Haryana Police Commando Complex in Newal, Karnal and the initial promo of the sequence being shot in a ground at Matunga.[45][46][40] During which, in April 2014 the sequence of a training in Jungle was shot at Ghodbunder road, Thane, Maharashtra.[47]\n\nIn March 2015, the storyline took a five years leap.[48] Soon, in the same year, in July, it took a three years leap.[49]\n\nIn 2016, the sequences of the character Arzoo in Pakistan was shot at Bhopal which was shown in the series as Pakistan.[50]\n\nSingh and Rashid continuously ran for about 12 hours for filming the last sequence for 2 days.[51]\n\nCrossover\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 24 August 2012, the show had a crossover episode with Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai.
