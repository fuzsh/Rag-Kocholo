During a recent interview, he displayed his wedding ring and expressed his frustration over the speculation, while acknowledging that such rumours are part of celebrity life. Abhishek stated, 'I am still married. I don't have anything to say to you all about that. You all have blown the entire thing out of proportion, sadly. I understand why you do it; you have to file some stories. It's okay, we're celebrities, we have to take it.' The rumours started when Abhishek and Aishwarya attended separate events at the Ambani wedding, and were further fueled by Abhishek’s like on a post about divorce cases.\n\n2236 views | 20 hours ago\n\nRupali Ganguly Calls for Global Action to Protect Minorities in Bangladesh\n\nRupali Ganguly recently spoke out about the plight of minorities in Bangladesh, urging global voices to support the helpless amid escalating protests. The 'Anupamaa' actress expressed her anguish on X, emphasizing her father's Bangladeshi roots. Her post included hashtags such as 'All Eyes on Bangladesh' and 'All Eyes on Bangladeshi Hindu.' She wrote, “The stories of persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh have left me in a state of anguish. Having my father’s roots in present-day Bangladesh, it scares me to think of the constant atrocities and violence the minorities are being subjected to. This is the time for every human being throughout the world to stand up and raise our voice for the protection of the helpless and vulnerable minorities in Bangladesh.' In addition, Sonu Sood had previously shared a heart-wrenching video of a Bangladeshi woman crying for help. On August 5, Sheikh Hasina resigned as Bangladesh's Prime Minister and flew to India. During the protests, actor Shanto Khan and his father, producer Selim Khan, were brutally killed.\n\n557 views | 4 days ago\n\nSonu Sood Calls for Immediate Action to Bring Indians Home from Crisis-Hit Bangladesh\n\nAfter former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country on a military aircraft, Sonu Sood called on both the government and citizens to assist in evacuating Indians from violence-hit Bangladesh.
