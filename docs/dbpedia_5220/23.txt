Moustapha Akkad, producer of the cult "Halloween" slasher series and the director of three of his own religious-themed films, died Friday after suffering injuries from the hotel bombings in Jordan.

Akkad, 75, and his 34 year-old daughter, Rima Akkad Monla, were in the lobby of the Radisson SAS in Amman when bombs went off in a simultaneous attack on three area hotels; Monla also died.

Akkad, a Los Angeles resident, had enjoyed a nearly 20-year career in filmmaking despite the difficulties of being Arabic and Muslim in Hollywood. The native Syrian began by directing his own Muslim-themed films: "The Message" (1976) and "Lion of the Desert" (1981). Following the resulting acclaim and religious controversy, Akkad turned to horror films, executive producing John Carpenterâ€˜s legendary "Halloween" (1978).
