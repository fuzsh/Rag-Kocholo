        "text": "The Message (Arabic: الرسالة, Ar-Risālah, lit. The Message; originally known as Mohammad, Messenger of God) is a 1976 Islamic epic drama film directed and produced by Moustapha Akkad, chronicling the life and times of the Islamic prophet Muhammad through the perspective of his uncle Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib and adopted son Zayd ibn Harithah. Mark Cousins in his The Story of Film: An Odyssey said The Message was \"perhaps seen by as many people as have seen any film in cinema history.\"\n\nReleased in separately filmed Arabic- and English-language versions, The Message serves as an introduction to early Islamic history. The international ensemble cast includes Anthony Quinn, Irene Papas, Michael Ansara, Johnny Sekka, Michael Forest, André Morell, Garrick Hagon, Damien Thomas, and Martin Benson. It was an international co-production between Libya, Morocco, Lebanon, Syria and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film was nominated for Best Original Score in the 50th Academy Awards, composed by Maurice Jarre, but lost the award to Star Wars (composed by John Williams). Then-Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi provided the majority of the financial support.\n\nShooting[]\n\nFilming in Morocco started in April 1974, but Moroccan police forced them to stop filming on August 5, as Hassan II of Morocco had been pressured by Faisal of Saudi Arabia. Akkad was granted permission to film in Libya after showing unedited film to Muammar Gaddafi and filmed from October 1974, to May 1975.\n\nCast[]\n\nAnthony Quinn - Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib\n\nIrene Papas - Hind bint ʿUtba\n\nMichael Ansara - Abu Sufyan ibn Harb\n\nJohnny Sekka - Bilāl ibn Rabāḥ\n\nMichael Forest - Khalid ibn al-Walid\n\nGarrick Hagon - Ammar ibn Yasir\n\nDamien Thomas - Zayd ibn Haritha al-Kalbi\n\nAndré Morell - Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib\n\nMartin Benson - Amr ibn Hisham (also Khosrow II for Arabic dub)\n\nRobert Brown - Utbah ibn Rabi'ah\n\nRosalie Crutchley - Sumayyah bint Khabbat\n\nBruno Barnabe - Umayya ibn Khalaf\n\nNeville Jason - Ja'far ibn Abi Talib\n\nJohn Bennett - Abd Allah ibn Ubayy\n\nDonald Burton - Amr ibn al-As\n\nEarl Cameron - Najashi\n\nGeorge Camiller - Walid ibn Utba\n\nNicholas Amer - Suhayl ibn ʿAmr (as Nicolas Amer)\n\nRonald Chenery - Muṣʿab ibn ʿUmayr\n\nMichael Godfrey - Al-Bara' ibn Malik\n\nJohn Humphry - Ubadah ibn al-Samit\n\nEwen Solon - Yasir ibn Amir\n\nWolfe Morris - Abu Lahab\n\nRonald Leigh-Hunt - Heraclius\n\nLeonard Trolley - Silk Merchant\n\nGerard Hely - Sinan\n\nHabib Ageli - Abu Hudhayfa ibn Utba\n\nPeter Madden - Toothless Man\n\nMohamed Hassan Al Joundi - Khosrow II (as Hassan Joundi)\n\nAbdellah Lamrani\n\nElaine Ives-Cameron - Umm Jamil\n\nMohammad Al-Gaddary - Money Lender\n\nRest of cast listed alphabetically:\n\nAhmed Abdelhalim - Uriqat\n\nMohamed Basri - Merchant\n\nHassan Essakali\n\nSalem Gedara - Wahshi\n\nRichard Johnson - Narrator\n\nMohamed Majd\n\nVic Tablian - Hamzu army soldier (uncredited)\n\nArabic voice dub[]"
