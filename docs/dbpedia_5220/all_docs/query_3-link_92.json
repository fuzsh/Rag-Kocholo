        "text": "Night Shyamalan’s first unabashed commercial failure as a major filmmaker was the 2006 film Lady in the Water, an intensely strange film about a man finding himself immersed in a weird story involving “Narfs” and “Scrunts” invading his apartment complex’s swimming pool, was reportedly based on a bedtime story that Shyamalan would tell to his kids. When that movie crashed and burned commercially and critically people thought “well, maybe fatherhood just led him on a strange lark” but the issues with his filmmaking trajectory did not go away as he moved on to more adult projects. Shyamalan has, however, remained fairly interested in turning his filmmaking career into a family affair and as his daughters have grown up he’s kept them involved in his work behind the scenes and this seems to have culminated in the summer of 2024 with a pair of projects that seem to have had slightly nepotistic intentions. First there was The Watchers a film fits into his overall brand and was produced by him but was directed by his twenty four year old daughter Ishana Night Shyamalan. That movie was not great but I would say wasn’t an embarrassment either, the younger Shyamalan was certainly competent behind the camera but the movie she was making didn’t entirely work and has been pretty quickly forgotten. Now we have another Shyamalan project, this one directed by the man himself but which seems heavily designed to be a musical and acting showcase for another of his daughters, Saleka Shyamalan, who has a heretofore not overly successful career as an R&B singer. That film, Trap, probably has more commercial upside than The Watchers but from where I sit it’s kind of a toss-up as to which of the movies is better.\n\nTrap opens with a man named Cooper (Josh Hartnett) escorting his daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue) to an arena for a mid-day concert being performed by a major pop star who goes by the name Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan). The two get into the building and find their seats but along the way Cooper starts noticing an unusual number of police in and around the building and starts to wonder what’s going on. We see early on that he has some sort of live video on his cell phone of someone tied to a chair and it would seem he has some reason to be afraid of talking to police. Eventually he starts chatting with a merch vendor (Jonathan Langdon) and learns on the down low that the whole concert is a sting operation: they’ve learned that an infamous local serial killer uncreatively dubbed “The Butcher” will be attending the show and they’ve closed off all exists in hopes of interrogating everyone in the building who fits the killer’s profile in hopes of capturing him. Frightened, Cooper realizes he needs to scope out this whole situation and try to find means of getting past security and escaping this place but it’s going to take some incredible ingenuity to pull such an escape off.\n\nThe basic high concept here, of someone essentially needing to escape from a Taylor Swift concert undetected, has some potential. I’m not exactly sure I find this scenario plausible, firstly because I have my doubts that a pop star would agree to such a situation and secondly because I don’t think it’s actually legal or possible for the police to conduct that many random searches on people… I don’t think what they have constitutes probable cause, but it is something I’m willing to play along with for the purposes of a thriller. The bigger issue with this concept is, well, it implicitly requires you to empathize with and hope for the escape of a literal serial killer. This isn’t something that’s impossible to overcome necessarily, if a filmmaker is willing to be particularly perverse or particularly empathetic there probably are ways to pull such things off but I’m not sure this movie does. Unlike Kevin Costner in the comparable No Way Out we don’t have any good reason to think this guy is innocent, nor do we get the sense that he’s reformed or that he had some sort of good reason to commit his crimes. I’m guessing that Shyamalan rather over-estimated how much good will the fact that this guy seems to genuinely love his daughter would buy with the audience or maybe he just thought that Josh Hartnett would have enough magnetism to make audiences like the unlikable but I’m not sure why he would have expected that given that Josh Hartnett is and always has been a mediocre at best talent who is not worthy of the comeback people seem to want to give him.\n\nBeyond that the movie is just kind of ridden with plot holes and contrivance. Through much of the movie the protagonist seems to be able to get people to completely bend backwards to help him and I think the idea is supposed to be that this is just a function of him being this super charismatic and manipulative guy who can get people to bend to his will, but I just don’t think either Shyamalan’s dialogue or Hartnett’s performance really sold these scenes as intended and Shyamalan really doesn’t make the twisted mind of his protagonist feel particularly authentic or interesting. On the plus side, I do think the film took a couple risks in terms of genre and structure that were interesting. There’s a bit of a perspective shift the movie takes at about the halfway point that I do think it pulls off and the movie starts to work a lot better for a stretch there. I would also say that the father/daughter dynamic in the opening parts before the thriller elements take off felt pretty realistic and the “nepo-baby” aspects of the project were less of a detriment than they could have been. I didn’t find Saleka Shyamalan that believable as a world conquering pop star and the music she wrote for the movie is decidedly “mid” but when the singer becomes a more direct player in the story at a certain point she mostly holds her own well enough as an actress and wasn’t that much of a distraction. Beyond that, I don’t want to give the impression that this is too big of a failure. It works sporadically as intended and is mostly watchable. Shyamalan has made much worse movies in the past but I still don’t really count this as a success, it just botches too much and has a bit too many questionable Shyamalan-isms and kind of feels like a wasted opportunity.\n\n**1/2 out of Five\n\nOne of the bigger spectacles behind the scenes in the film world as of late has been the various circumstances around Megalopolis, the big and largely self-financed film that Francis Ford Coppola which is by all accounts a bonkers piece of cinema that will likely be a total financial boondoggle but which does excitingly offer one more movie from one of the most fascinating living directors today. With this likely being the final culmination of a long career filled with ups and downs I decided that it was finally time to track down and watch that final handful of Francis Ford Coppola movies I’d yet to see in order to be a true completionist with the guy leading up to that Megalopolis release. Not long ago I had way more Coppola blind spots than I do now, but there have been several re-appraisals of his post-70s career which have led me to check out stuff like One From the Heart and The Cotton Club and at this point I’m down to just having six movies left to watch: three of them pre-Godfather early efforts two from the 1980s when he was in the wilderness after the failure of American Zoetrope, and one movie from his brief return to commercial relevance in the 90s. I will say, there’s a reason I haven’t watched some of these, most of them are definitely not considered some of his best work so this may not be the best way to hype myself up for this new release but… well, given some of what I heard about Megalopolis that might be the right way to set expectations.\n\nYou’re a Big Boy Now (1966)\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola entered the film industry after graduating from UCLA Film School and like a lot of filmmakers of his generation his first film was a low budget genre movie made with Roger Corman. That movie 1963’s Dementia 13 is considered a pretty strong example of horror cinema from its era but doesn’t tend to get talked about that much in terms of its director, in fact I saw it many years ago without even knowing it was directed by the dude who made The Godfather. His first real entrance into “respectable” cinema was this 1966 comedy which doesn’t feel particularly Coppola-esque to me either but which nonetheless feels like a very interesting specimen of what was going on with studio filmmaking during this era. The film is an adaptation of a book of the same name by David Benedictus about this wildly sheltered young upper class man of nineteen raised by people who would today be called “helicopter parents” who finds himself leaving home for the first time and moving into an apartment in New York and experiencing some pretty big culture shock. The movie came at this very strange time in Hollywood where the Production code was clearly going down in flames but before it had been formally replaced by the ratings system we have today, so you have movies like this which is essentially a sex comedy which is far raunchier than anything that would have been made in the 50s but which still isn’t quite empowered to let the F-bombs fly or really show much in the way of onscreen sex or nudity.\n\nThe film is a product of its time in other ways as well as it employs a looser style than you might have expected from a movie from the earlier studio era with a lot of fourth wall breaking techniques throughout. It sort of reminds me of other mid 60s comedies like A Thousand Clowns but it doesn’t necessarily fit to clearly in a wider genre. It’s very much the work of a young director who’s trying to throw a lot of different ideas at the screen some of which work better than others. I call it a product of its time, and it certainly is, but in some ways it may have been ahead of its time as well. Some have called it a precursor to The Graduate in its interest in a young man with an identity crisis but it never caught on like that movie… partly because it’s not nearly as good, but also because young audiences hadn’t quite started looking for stuff like this yet. That said the movie wasn’t seen as a total failure at the time, I’m not sure what its box office was but it was notable enough to get Geraldine Page a supporting Actress nomination at the Oscars and a Best Picture – Comedy nomination at the Golden Globes, so someone was watching it and it would lead Coppola to much bigger things with his next movie.\n\n*** out of Five\n\nFinian’s Rainbow (1968)\n\nAfter making You’re a Big Boy Now for Seven Arts (a production company that would go on to merge with Warner Brothers) Coppola was tapped to take on a much larger production: a roadshow musical based on a Broadway production from the late 40s called Finian’s Rainbow. Of the early films Coppola made this is easily the one that’s hardest to reconcile with what Coppola would go on to become. This doesn’t feel like a work of The New Hollywood at all, quite the opposite in fact, it’s the antithesis of it. These big budget family friendly musicals are exactly the kind of square Hollywood productions that the New Hollywood was created to counter and this came out after the public was already kind of turning on them. It would be the equivalent of if someone like Chloé Zhao got tapped to make an MCU movie or if Lee Isaac Chung was hired to make a CGI disaster movie… totally implausible. Now, Finian’s Rainbow is a little different from The Sound of Music or Hello Dolly in that it’s a somewhat lower budget production than them and reportedly it wasn’t made with the Roadshow format in mind originally but was turned into one by the distributors. The film stars a nearly seventy year old Fred Astaire and Petula Clark (the woman who sang “Downtown”) as his daughter, who have both emigrated from Ireland to the United States having absconded with a leprechaun’s gold and are being pursued by said leprechaun (played by Tommy Steele). Once in America they find themselves in a southern town and get in the middle of a conflict between the bigoted mayor and a black community he’s trying to steal land from.\n\nSo that plot is pretty bonkers and the movie generally doesn’t take itself very seriously, which is another thing that differentiates it from most roadshow musicals of the era, which tended to lean a bit more into their “epic” quality despite having characters bursting into song. The film does ostensibly have a message about racism and discrimination which I would describe as “clumsy.” This is basically a family movie so its depiction of the theme is pretty simplistic and there’s also something a little dated about making a movie like this that’s almost entirely from the perspective of “good” white people. Even more dated is a subplot in which a character wishes that the film’s villainous mayor could know what it was like to live as a black person, unaware that there was Leprachan wish granting afoot… you can probably guess where that plotline is heading and what makeup effects were used to make it happen… yeah, the subplot was probably well intentioned but, yikes. Beyond all that the movie is just sort of fluff. Coppola does inject some scenes with some needed energy and tries something interesting with the camera here and there but beyond being an immigrant story you’re not going to find a lot of his sensibilities in this material. It’s not really terrible at what it’s trying to be, but what it’s trying to be is corny as shit so that’s not that much of an accomplishment. The music here isn’t even very good, in fact it’s rather forgettable and so is the movie itself; it seems to have done decent but unspectacular business at the box office and did well at the Golden Globes but it seems like Coppola was happy to move past it and work on more personal projects going forward.\n\n** out of Five\n\nThe Rain People (1969)\n\nI hadn’t heard much about The Rain People before watching it outside of the Coppola name and didn’t really know what to expect since it has a pretty bad title. The film looks at a woman played by Shirley Knight who walks out on her husband and goes on something of a spur of the moment road trip in which she picks up a hitchhiker played by James Caan. Robert Duvall also plays a key character who shows up late in the film so you can kind of see Coppola networking with some future cast members of The Godfather here. Where the previous Coppola films mostly feel like late 60s work-for-hire jobs this one legitimately feels like part of the “New Hollywood” and specifically the film rather resembles movies like Scorsese’s Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore, Barbara Loden’s Wanda, and even Spielberg’s The Sugarland Express to some extent and it could maybe be argued that Coppola was just a bit ahead of the curve on some of his early films. Then again it may have just been natural that filmmakers were interested in making movies like this: road trip movies are cheap to produce for young filmmakers and stories of women leaving their controlling husbands to find themselves were pretty topical during this era in the wake of Betty Friedan’s “The Feminine Mystique.” Broadly speaking I think this movie can be called feminist, or at least an attempt at feminism but one coming from a young man who I’m not sure has as much insight into this topic as he thinks he does. There’s some good acting and good late-60s/early 70s style to be found here but the film has kind of been supplanted by some of the other movies of the era I mentioned earlier and it also has kind of a weak ending which doesn’t really resolve the central character arc as much as it thinks it does. The movie is interesting enough both as a precursor to what Coppola did later and as a sort of forgotten New Hollywood movie but it’s not some lost classic or something I anticipate revisiting anytime soon.\n\n*** out of Five\n\nGardens of Stone (1987)\n\nIn my run through my remaining unseen Coppola films I’m taking a nearly twenty year leap from 1969 to 1987, picking up after a run of classics the man made in the 70s and a run of movies in the 80s which were at least reasonably well remembered for one reason or another. But the movie I’ll be looking at may well be the least discussed movie of the man’s entire filmography. The 60s movies I started with aren’t very widely seen either but they do at least get discussed for their roll as stepping stones leading up to The Godfather and other more flawed Coppola movies like One From the Heart or The Cotton Club have interesting production histories regardless of how much you like them, and other movies he’s made at least stand out as major misfires. But this one? Pretty much never hear a word about it either positive or negative. It failed at the box office but not disastrously, the critics received it with indifference, and it didn’t seem to affect Coppola’s career in the slightest. The film is a follow-up to 1986’s Peggy Sue Got Married, and like that movie it feels like a fairly mercenary effort that you would not guess was made by one of the cinema’s most acclaimed auteurs.\n\nFrom a screenplay by Ronald Bass, the film is an adaptation of a not particularly well known novel by Nicholas Proffitt, and looks at a drill sergeant training the honor guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which is this highly disciplined showcase unit that are basically the American equivalent of the guards at Buckingham Palace. This is set during the Vietnam era and much of the plot concerns the drill sergeant’s conflicted feelings about the war and how the effect his role as an otherwise proud career military man and his mentorship of a young and idealistic soldier. The very concept of Coppola making another Vietnam related film, even one that’s almost entirely set on the home front like this, instantly weighs the film down with expectations given that Coppola made what is probably the best movie about that war with Apocalypse Now. On top of that there were already a whole lot of movies re-litigating that conflict in more ambitious fashion like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket and this isn’t in much of a position to compete. There is some interest to be found in the premise here; the mindset of a military man who is against Vietnam specifically but who clashes with some of the more strident anti-war activists on one side and military brass on the other is a worthwhile premise at its core but the movie never really presents this in a way that fully brings it to life. The film is never quite able to settle on which character it wants to follow between the older drill sergeant and the younger cadet and while the performances are decent the characters end up being more interesting on paper than in execution. Visually the film is also just a snore. The movie reeks of its bland 80s studio drama style and if you’d told me this was made for HBO or something it wouldn’t have surprised me. If the movie stands out at all it’s as a forgettable mediocrity in the middle of a career that’s otherwise defined by big swings.\n\n**1/2 out of Five\n\nTucker: The Man and His Dream (1988)\n\nBy the late 80s things were looking pretty bleak for Francis Ford Coppola. His financials were drained and he was making mediocre Hollywood programmers like Peggy Sue Got Married, but then he got a bit of a break when his pal George Lucas agreed to help produce one of Coppola’s passion projects. That project, Tucker: The Man and His Dream, looked at the life of inventor Preston Tucker who had a variety of ideas for how to improve the American automobile with innovative features and has a plan to manufacture these cars outside of the systems of the “big three” automakers. It’s a story that Coppola had a fairly personal connection to as his father was apparently an investor in Tucker’s venture back in the day and owned one of the few Tucker 48 automobiles that actually got manufactured before the operation went bust. George Lucas, being a known auto enthusiast himself, was also pretty interested in these cars so the project is in some ways an opportunity for these guys to geek out over a topic that the general public wasn’t particularly interested in. They’d pay for that at the box office. Another factor may well have been the film’s title with its unwieldy use of a colon and subtitle, something that makes it sound like a documentary rather than scripted feature and seemingly tries to brand the movie with a name that not many people know or care about.\n\nWhere the film failed with audiences it did get some of the better reviews Coppola had received in a while and is indeed a little bit of a comeback for the filmmaker and presaged his little early 90s renaissance where he’d make The Godfather Part III, Bram Stoker’s Dracula, and The Rainmaker. The film is not as formally inventive and experimental as some of his other passion projects but you can plainly see that he has a bigger budget to work with than he’s had with some of its immediate predecessors and Coppola seems to be renewed in bringing the movie up to the screen. Jeff Bridges does some very good work as the title character here and the movie does a decent job of making some fairly obscure business stuff intelligible to audiences as we get into a courtroom sequences late in the film. While this is a “passion project” it is still being pitched in a relatively commercial direction in its writing and filmmaking and Tucker himself is portrayed in a positive light that maybe could have benefited from a bit more complexity. That’s in part because Coppola likely sees quite a bit of himself in this guy… in fact the film has been pretty widely interpreted to be something of an allegory for his own experiences in failing to disrupt the film industry by producing an independent product through his American Zoetrope Studio and that metaphor might be blinding Coppola a bit. He basically pins all of Tucker’s problems on interference from Detroit, which by extension might suggest that he’s blaming the studios for the demise of American Zoetrope rather than the fact that he dumped millions of dollars into an un-commercial Tom Waits musical and by extension he maybe could have done more to explain how Tucker’s dreams may have been a bit unrealistic from the jump. But that meta element does add another layer of interest to what is already a pretty enjoyable telling of an obscure bit of history and the film does stand as one of Coppola’s better post 1970s efforts.\n\n***1/2 out of Five\n\nJack (1996)\n\nI knew going into this “Closure” project looking at the remaining Francis Ford Coppola movies I hadn’t seen that it was going to end on something of an anti-climax as the most recent unseen Coppola movie for me was Jack, a film that is seen as something of a nadir for the filmmaker which pretty well derailed the little comeback he had going after The Godfather Part III and Bram Stoker’s Dracula. The film is about the life of a kid born with a rare genetic disorder that makes him grow exponentially fast resulting in him looking like Robin Williams when he’s only ten. It’s a plot inspired by the very real disease of Progeria, though the film is careful to say it’s not actually Progeria but some sort of super-Progeria, in part because this is not really how Progeria works. Progeria does make kids bodies detereoriate like they’re aging rapidly but doesn’t make them grow tall like adults or generally be mistaken for one, rather they end up looking rather strange and deformed (see the documentary Life According to Sam, if you’re interested). It’s an incredibly sad condition and the movie is not unaware of this, it’s pretty upfront about the fact that Jack is not going to live much into adulthood, but for long stretches it still very much plays out like a cute “child-like adult” comedy like it was Big or something.\n\nJack is not exactly a movie that exudes incompetence or anything, in fact it’s fairly professionally made and has some interesting subtext if you want to look for it (it’s probably Coppola processing the death of his son Gian-Carlo on some level), but it is an exceptionally strange movie and not in a good way. Rather it’s a movie that aggressively begs the question “who is this for?” The movie’s poster makes this look like some kind of half-baked family film vehicle for Robin Williams, but it kind of isn’t. The movie was funded by Disney but was not released under their banner and is actually rated PG-13 for “some sexual references” and has a kind of grim and morbid subject matter at its core. So it’s not really for kids, but it’s still made in such a way as to feel like it is. The casting of Robin Williams probably plays into this; he sort of makes sense for the role in that “Robin Williams plays a big kid” seems like something that could sell tickets but the Robin Williams of 1996 kind of inherently sets the movie up to be something pretty lighthearted which the actual film isn’t going to be able to really deliver on. I’m not going to say it’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen or even the worst thing Coppola’s ever made as I’d probably rather re-watch this than sit through Twixt again, Robin Williams can also do much worse as this is definitely preferable to Patch Adams but it’s not what we want out of great auteurs and also not what we want out of Disney movies so it’s definitely a failure.\n\n** out of Five\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nI knew going in that this wouldn’t really be a look at Coppola’s best work by any means and I was more or less proven right about this, and yet I still think this was an interesting little journey. The early Coppola movies I watched were very much stepping stone films that were interesting for how they reflected a young artist making the most out of some odd cards he was dealt. The three later films I saw were in various different ways also looking at Coppola making the most out of some strange assignments with the possible exception of Tucker: The Man and His Dream, which is easily the best of the movies here in part because it was Coppola working on something he really wanted to work on while still being kept at least somewhat restrained by a studio. Truth be told I think Coppola is one of those guys like Terry Gilliam who are control freaks who think they need to fight off studio notes to the death but who maybe do their best work when they’re given a certain amount of freedom by the moneymen but isn’t given total free rein from them. That said, unrestrained Coppola can make for some pretty interesting messes and as such it’s probably fitting that his (possibly) last movie coming up is going to be one last wild mess he made while trying to maintain his independence.\n\nFor most of the year I’ve been looking forward to the release of Deadpool and Wolverine but then a couple of weeks ago I stopped and asked myself why I was excited for this thing. When the trailers for the original Deadpool came out I thought it looked obnoxious and didn’t even bother to see it in theaters and when I caught up with it I thought it was passable at best. I thought Deadpool 2 was maybe a slight improvement, but mostly just by virtue of it being a larger budget production with better action scenes. But the Deadpool franchise has never been my cup of tea and there were plenty of red flags that this could be the worst of them: it’s being directed by Shawn Levy, who I consider to be something of a hack, and the idea of bringing Hugh Jackman back yet again as Wolverine strikes me as rather distasteful given how Logan ended that character arc. So why was I still excited for this thing? Well, I think it’s mostly because this was going to be Deadpool’s introduction to the MCU after the 20th Century Fox acquisition, meaning this would be the first MCU movie of any kind we’ve gotten for a while and I’ve been jonesing for that fix. That’s maybe indicative of a rather unpalatable addiction given that it’s only actually been nine months since the last one of these but it feels like an eternity given the grip these universe has had on the culture, and if the MCU is going to make a comeback something a little off their usual brand like this would seem to be the way to do it.\n\nThe story for Deadpool & Wolverine kicks off with Wade “Deadpool” Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) attending his birthday party with friends and family only to be interrupted when TVA agents knock on his door and drag him to a room in the TVA where he meets an agent named Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen). Paradox tells him that Universe 10005 (the universe of the Fox X-men movies) is going to collapse because its anchor being, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) has died during the events of Logan, which will eventually make the world wither and die but probably not for something like a thousand years. Paradox believes the universe should be pruned rather than allowed to collapse slowly but understands that Deadpool plays some role in the future of Universe 616 (the MCU’s timeline) and offers to move Deadpool to that timeline if he helps him out. Deadpool quickly refuses and instead jacks a universe teleporter and looks for an alternate universe Wolverine to take the place of 10005’s Wolverine, ultimately finding a suitable candidate in a bar who looks and acts like Wolverine but wears a blue and gold suit and is even more drunk and surly. Quickly Paradox tells him that this isn’t going to work and instead sends both of them into “the void” where they’ll need to make their way through the detritus of various Marvel universes and face off against a powerful mutant named Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin).\n\nThere’s a moment pretty late in Deadpool & Wolverine where Deadpool, in his usual fourth wall breaking form, looks at the camera and says something along the line of “enough with multiverses am I right? Don’t we all agree those are overdone?” To say that this comment was like the pot calling the kettle black would be a bit of an understatement. This movie’s plotline is as dependent on multiverses as anything and its comedy is heavily rooted in references to earlier movies, to the point where I wonder if it would make the slightest bit of sense to anyone who hasn’t spent the last twenty five years watching damn near every superhero movie that’s come along while also being enmeshed in the various rumors and entertainment news surrounding them. I, of course, am one of the people who all that applies to so I guess I’m the perfect target audience for it in much the way I’m still kind of on board with a lot of these recent multiverse Marvel movies, but for audiences who find movies like The Flash to be incomprehensibly mired in references to other movies this movie will, in its own way, be just as impenetrable. And for all the film’s promise of bringing Deadpool into the MCU… it kind of doesn’t. The MCU is certainly referenced frequently, and much of it is set in the TVA/void which are I suppose the intellectual property of the MCU having been introduced in the “Loki” TV series, but through the entire movie only something like three minutes of it are actually set in the “sacred timeline” of universe-616.\n\nThose worried that the migration to Disney would result in a neutered version of Deadpool need not worry; the film is plenty violent and plenty profane. I’d say that the action sequences are probably a step down from what we got from what David Leitch gave us with the second film and the movie in general is a bit held back by some bad habits like the use of CGI blood, but the action scenes we do get are reasonably fun. As for the comedy… well, I’ve always been a bit hot and cold on this franchise’s sense of humor. Half the jokes in your average Deadpool movie is legitimately amusing but there are also plenty of whiffs along the way and I’d say that ratio carries through with this one. There is something about the attitude of these movies that kind of grates on me over time; they’re sort of parodies but not always entirely loving ones. Deadpool himself just sort of takes potshots at the universes he inhabits as the movie goes along and these insights are not always that clever, he’s often sort of shooting fish in a barrel. But there are places where these movies do just kind of work on their own merits beyond all the deconstruction. Here I particularly enjoyed the villains: Matthew Macfadyen is fresh off succession and brings his Tom persona to another fun height here and Emma Corrin is also fun as a psychotic evil twin of Charles Xavier and the film has fun with the effects used to have her probe people’s minds with her fingers.\n\nI guess this is ultimately a movie I’m of two minds about. The more analytical part of myself is pretty critical of the whole thing, viewing it as pandering fan-service drivel that has all the same problems of most of these easter-egg-o-rama multiverse movies but tries to hypocritically hide behind a bunch of snarky cynicism. I think that take is basically accurate… but there’s another part of me that had a little too much fun along the way to really dismiss the experience. I liked seeing the dude in red slice people up, I laughed a decent handful of times at the jokes, and I definitely had that nerdy excitement when some of the cameos happened. I’m not sure that that reaction is going to hold up after the first viewing though. This thing is really mired in the moment and a lot of what it does is going to feel very dated not too far in the future. So, we’re left with a movie that I fundamentally don’t respect and which I don’t think is going to leave much of a legacy but which still kind of got to me with it’s cheap pandering… I guess it’s a true guilty pleasure.\n\n**1/2 out of Five\n\nMaxxxine(7/9/2024)\n\nSay what you will about Ti West’s X franchise but they certainly don’t play it safe with their evolution. They went from being this 80s style slasher movie in 70s movie garb to being a 1910s set serial killer movie shot like a 1940s style musical to now being an 80s L.A. set giallo. The film picks up about six years after the events of X and Maxine Minx has become a pornstar living in L.A. who’s trying to go “legit” by auditioning to star in a horror movie, but there’s a serial killer in the area and it starts to sound like the demons of Maxine’s past are catching up to her. Maxxxine was clearly made on a larger budget than the previous X movies, which were shot back-to-back on the cheap during the pandemic and before West or the studio knew if either film would be a success. They’ve managed to assemble a pretty impressive cast this time around including the likes of Kevin Bacon, Elizabeth Debicki, Bobby Cannavale, Michelle Monaghan, Giancarlo Esposito, Halsey, and Lily Collins with many of them chewing scenery pretty hard. Like Pearl the movie is perhaps more interested in luxuriating in its period setting and its cinema references than it is in actually scaring its audience. There is more gore in this movie than there was in that one but there’s probably a less interesting character study and performance at its center. In terms of pure style there’s a lot of fun to be had with this movie and West seems to be having a lot of fun with it but it’s also a bit messier and more indulgent than the two movies that came before. On some level I almost wonder if this whole franchise would work better as some kind of anthology TV series called “decades of terror” or something as a lot of them kind of feel like period settings in search of a movie but I have fun with them just the same.\n\n*** out of Five\n\nLonglegs(7/14/2024)\n\nSlowly but surely Neon seems to be catching up with A24 in getting into the horror game. Their latest film Longlegs appears to be on track to be their biggest financial success to date in that genre, and this is notable because the film is basically a straight-up “elevated horror” movie. The film was directed by a guy named Osgood Perkins, director of The Blackcoat’s Daughter and Gretel & Hansel, who previously hasn’t really had the success of someone like Robert Eggers or Ari Aster but who may have finally come a bit closer this time around. I didn’t really love or even particularly like Perkins’ earlier horror movies but I could detect a unique style to them and that carries over more successfully to this one. Here he’s making a 90s set film about an FBI investigation into a serial killer who seems to have some possibly supernatural ability to drive people to go made and kill their own families, an action investigators are only able to catch on to because he leaves coded messages for the police at the sight of these murders signed “Longlegs.” Perkins’s filmmaking style is distinctive but a little hard to describe. His blocking tends to be rather formal and locked down but also incorporates a lot of stylized lighting and affected line deliveries from his actors but he never seems to be trying anything too radical, but will occasionally do something a bit out there like shifting aspect ratios during flashbacks.\n\nPerkins’ films generally engage in the supernatural but in ways that are a bit different than what we’re used to. For instance here we’re essentially dealing with an occult devil worshiping villain but we mostly don’t get the familiar pentagram iconography which is usually associated with that. On the other hand he doesn’t hide from obvious cinematic influences either. Our hero is a female FBI agent hunting a serial killer, which of course instantly reminds audiences of The Silence of the Lambs and the killer has some distinct Buffalo Bill DNA to him, but the movie doesn’t feel like a copycat either outside of its most basic trappings. In fact I’d say the movie rather admirably avoids horror movie formulas, at least on its surface and usually keeps the audience guessing (though there is at least one twist you see coming from a mile away) and is a pretty unique elevated horror experience overall. Having said all that I’m not sure it’s quite a movie I can go all in on. For one, the movie is more unsettling than it is scary and I’m also not so sure about Nicholas Cage’s performance here. Cage is decked in makeup to the point of being almost unrecognizable at first glance, but as soon as he starts talking you know exactly who it is because this performance is as Cagey as it gets in all its aggressive weirdness. Still, this is plainly a horror movie that’s more than worth giving a watch and I do want to see more of what Osgood Perkins does now that he seems to have hit his stride.\n\n***1/2 out of Five\n\nTwisters(7/17/2024)\n\nHollywood is scrambling to find the “next big thing” now that superhero movies seem to be on the outs and one strategy they seem to be going for in the wake of Top Gun: Maverick is to try to make long delayed sequels to popular movies that they didn’t feel the need to make sequels to back in the day. The latest film to get this treatment is Twister, although the follow-up they’ve come up with does not have any of the cast members of the 1996 original and unless I missed an Easter Egg in there somewhere I don’t think they reference a single character or event from that movie, so really this is more of a remake in the guise of a sequel. Personally, I never cared to much about the original Twister so the idea of more of it doesn’t exactly fill me with excitement but it’s also not like the legacy of anything that mattered to me was on the line with this one so there wasn’t much to lose. Interestingly the guy they tapped to direct the movie was Lee Isaac Chung, the man behind the immigration drama Minari, who isn’t exactly an intuitive choice for something like this but that movie was set in Arkansas and knowledge of that region is valuable when making a movie set in Tornado Alley and while I’m certainly not going to call this anything resembling a deep exploration of red dirt country there is some local flavor that Chung is able to inject here, which is one of the film’s stronger elements. Chung also brings the film’s other major strength to the table: it’s a generally well shot and crafted movie with some good special effects. The tornados mostly look good and the sound effects have the room shaking as you’d want it to.\n\nSo there’s some reasonably effective filmmaking to be found here but the movie is let down by Mark L. Smith’s screenplay, which struck me as being really uninspired and formulaic and generally lived down to the flaws of the original film. The problem with both of these movies is that, in reality, tornados are rather random and disparate events and while “storm chasers” do exist the notion that they could stumble upon one of these disasters a day for a week is unlikely and it’s hard to build a movie around this. So in order to really structure one of these movies they need to give the characters some weird personal problems like a rivalry with opposing storm chasers or a romantic subplot, both of which are present here. The movie centers around a woman who’s coming back to storm chasing after having lost friends in a misguided chase five years earlier but has to contend with a rival group of storm chasers who are looking to get viral fame rather than conduct real science. The main guy in that rival group is played by Glen Powell though and as the movie goes on he starts to not seem so bad and as the movie goes on the main woman plainly starts to fall for him. That romance plays out pretty directly in line with formula, as does the rest of the movie. It’s a little pandering too. If there’s anything to be found under the surface of this its this Hallmark-esque subtext about city girls coming home and marrying a small town hunk. The movie is watchable enough and has a couple decent action sequences, but there’s really not any substance there and the storytelling is pretty weak. Please don’t let this lead to Armageddon 2.\n\n**1/2 out of Five\n\nBack in 2015, while promoting his film The Hateful Eight, Quentin Tarantino told the website ShotList “I like westerns, and I like the idea that, when I’m done with everything, I’ll be considered a western director… And I think you need to do three westerns to consider yourself a western director.” Later he reiterated this and said he doesn’t count “cheat” movies like Kill Bill Vol. 2 or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood to count towards this, so if he sticks to his ten movie limit and his next movie isn’t a Western then he’s not going to achieve this goal. Truth be told given the genre’s wane there are probably not many other major contemporary auteurs who are going to be able to hit this goal either. There’s Clint Eastwood obviously (though he’s mostly just “contemporary” because of a long lifespan), and the Coen Brothers have made it there if you’re willing to count No Country for Old Men, and I’m sure there’s a name or two I’m not thinking of, but the modern figure who really seems to embody the label of “western director” is none other than actor/director Kevin Costner. Costner’s debut film is one of the most successful westerns of the last 50 years, the Academy Award winning Dances With Wolves, and thirteen years later he also directed the under-appreciated cowboy movie Open Range putting him definitively as the director of two bona fide westerns. From there one could make an argument that his creative influence over the Lawrence Kasdan directed Wyatt Earp could be counted, or that the frontier elements in his post-Apocalyptic films Waterworld and The Postman counts them as westerns or that his acting in things like Silverado, “Hatfields & McCoys,” and “Ýellowstone” makes him definitively linked to the genre regardless of how many he’s directed. But such cheating is no longer needed because he’s opted to enter the “western director” club in the most dramatic way possible with his latest epic of the west, the “Horizon” series.\n\nThe “Horizon” series is a wildly ambitious project helmed and partly financed by Kevin Costner which is intended to play out an epic western story over the course of four lengthy movies that are to be released over the course of 2024 and 2025. After a prologue of sorts our story begins in 1863 in the San Pedro Valley with a burgeoning frontier town being attacked by a band of Apache who burn the place down and kill vast swaths of the population, and then we start to follow some of the surviving parties from that. Firstly we follow the Apache attackers, who are revealed to have been conducted by a young hothead named Pionsenay (Owen Crow Shoe) who is at odds with tribal elder Tuayeseh (Gregory Cruz), who worries this will lead to further violence and reprisals. This proves correct as a cadre of survivors led by a vengeful old man named Tracker (Jeff Fahey) and including an angry adolescent boy named Russell (Etienne Kellici) head off looking for Apache scalps. Meanwhile other survivors including a woman named Frances Kittredge (Sienna Miller) and her daughter Elizabeth (Georgia MacPhail) follow the less vengeful survivors follow Cavalry Lieutenant Trent Gephardt (Sam Worthington) to a military base in the vicinity. Meanwhile, we’re also introduced to two other storylines occurring elsewhere which will presumably converge on Horizon in later installments. We’re introduced to a wagon train heading in from the East led by a guy named Matthew Van Weyden (Luke Wilson) and finally we’re also introduced to a conflict in the Wyoming territory where we’re introduced to a local sex worker named Marigold (Abbey Lee) who finds herself mired in a conflict between her friend Lucy (Jena Malone) and her estranged family which culminates in a local drifter named Hayes Ellison (Kevin Costner) having to step in.\n\nAs you can probably tell there are kind of a lot of storylines going on at once here and the movie somewhat awkwardly shifts between them. These storylines do not get equal screentime (we’re only barely introduced to that wagon train for example and the storyline has gone nowhere by the end of this chapter), and often right once one of them seems to get going it will cut away from it. At least at this stage it feels less like a movie where multiple stories intersect and weave together and more like a TV show like “Game of Thrones” introducing separate B and C stories that might theoretically come up eventually but which feel like entirely separate movies being broken apart here. “It feels like it should be a TV show” is probably going to be something you hear a lot about “Horizon,” and while I value the theatrical experience and want experiments like this I’m not unsympathetic. We’ve had multi-part theatrical films like this before (Sergei Bondarchuk’s War and Peace comes to mind) but this pacing and structure feels a lot closer to something you’d see on television, in part because there’s just something kind of weird about finishing a lengthy day at the movies only to have things end not with a resolution, or even with a cliffhanger, but just with a “tune back in next week for more.” Had they maintained their feature length structure they might have benefited from a streaming release akin to something like what Netflix did with the “Fear Street” trilogy a couple years ago where you get a movie a month and don’t need to make too much of an investment.\n\nSo structure aside, what is Costner doing with this series? Well, Horizon is a fictional town and all of the characters here are fictional, but I’m pretty sure the town is meant to be a stand-in for Tombstone, Arizona (also located in the San Pedro Valley, though with a much less appealing name) and the Tuayeseh character is probably meant to be a stand-in for Geronimo. So this isn’t trying to be some kind of Spaghetti Western romp or something, it’s very much a movie looking to make really big proclamations about the “the west” and about the drive for migration and settlement, specifically it seems to be tying western settlement with “the American Dream” and by extension “Manifest Destiny.” The one thing you’ll find in all of the storylines (except for the Apache one) is an advertising flyer that’s apparently been spread far and wide advertising Horizon as a potential boom town waiting to be settled which is apparently drawing all these people together and how this flyer ignores the many challenges and downsides of this settlement. The movie is not exactly subtle about this theme and they don’t just let this be communicated with the poster, in fact there’s a lengthy conversation between the Sam Worthington character and his commanding officer about this. I’d also point out that this isn’t exactly the most original of takes. It’s kind of been the subtext and/or text of most westerns we’ve seen since the dawn of the genre and whether we need twelve hours of material to re-iterate it remains to be seen.\n\nThere were some fears early on that this movie would be some kind of right wing screed meant to appeal to the worst “Yellowstone” fans and these seem mostly unfounded. I wouldn’t call this movie “progressive” necessarily and there are some eyebrow raising elements but it does seem to be engaging on some level with the raw deal that Native Americans were given and the movie also does a fairly admirable job of creating female characters to populate its stories and give them reasonable focus as part of the tapestry. How well it maintains this remains to be seen… and for that matter a lot remains to be seen and that’s frustrating. I generally don’t like to whine about running-times but when a movie wants to you invest three hours of your time while also expecting a potential future investment of another nine hours you do kind of want it to deliver some serious dividends on that investment and I don’t know that the outlook on returns here looks promising. I’m also not sure the movie or series really have much of a natural audience; it seems a little too ponderous and reverent to be audience pleasing entertainment but also doesn’t appear to be novel and insightful enough to really satisfy as highbrow art. It’s possible that these stories will hit their stride in future installments and the appeal of a lot of this will become more apparent, but that might be too little too late for a lot of people. It’s like when someone recommends a TV show to you while saying it doesn’t really “get good” until season three. That having been said, there are glimmers of good stuff to be found here and I do wonder if this could have been turned into something that works a bit better if it was tinkered in editing and format. I’m curious enough to probably keep watching once “Chapter 2” comes out but I can’t say this looks like it will ever turn into something that’s good enough to justify how much it expects audiences to put into it.\n\n**1/2 out of Five"
