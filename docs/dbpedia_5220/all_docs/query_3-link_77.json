        "text": "THe Arab-American actor Sayed Badreya has had no problem finding work in Hollywood. With his dark beard and his accented English, he has had his pick of parts as terrorists, hijackers, kidnappers and Islamic militants.\n\n''Usually I play the bad guy role, a terrorist or someone,'' Mr. Badreya said by telephone from Egypt, where he is on a film shoot with Al Pacino, playing the head of the military wing of Hezbollah.\n\n''When I got to Hollywood, at first I couldn't get a lot of jobs,'' Mr. Badreya said. ''So I grew a beard and look like a really bad Arab, and I started to get a lot of work because that's what they want.''\n\nAfter years of virtual invisibility, Arab-Americans are finding prominence in Hollywood movies -- as terrorists and villains. They are only the latest in a long line of ethnic groups and nationalities cast in sterotypical bad-guy roles, from American Indians to Germans to Japanese to African Americans to Russians.\n\nEach set of villains reflected the headlines and the anxieties of its era. Each passed into obsolescence as the headlines changed. Now, with Soviet pretensions shattered and aliens from outer space passe, the new cinematic enemy is the Muslim extremist.\n\nThe latest film of this genre is ''The Siege,'' which opens on Friday and stars Denzel Washington, Annette Bening and Bruce Willis. Trailers for ''The Siege'' reduced it to the typical terrorist scare-fare with exploding buses and shadowy images of men in mosques, but the full-length film is a cut above. ''The Siege'' posits the dangers to democracy and freedom when the United States military, in pursuit of a terrorist cell operating in New York City, imposes martial law and herds the entire Arab-American population of Brooklyn into a detention camp.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
