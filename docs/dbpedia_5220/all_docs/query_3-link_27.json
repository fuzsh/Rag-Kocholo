        "text": "Michael Myers is back this Halloween. The seminal titular slasher gem and two of its sequels have returned to theaters and drive-ins this October.\n\nThe franchise has grossed over $640 million at the worldwide box office.\n\n“John Carpenter’s original Halloween was where this all began with a couple of drive-ins and theaters in Kansas City. It was an independent film that started there, word of mouth happened and it went theater to theater and has spread like wildfire,” explained Ryan Freimann, one of the executive producers of 2018’s Halloween. “In 1978 it ended up grossing somewhere around $70 million at the box office. I was born in 1977, so I went to the drive-in several times, but it trailed off in the 80s.”\n\n“What I find so fascinating about this is that we’re going back to analog solutions in this modern era, that’s increased as we combat the pandemic, as it offers a way for people to escape their homes safely. Halloween is meant to be seen with an audience. That’s why I think fans who have, in many cases, seen it hundreds of times have done that because of the shared experience.”\n\nThe wildly popular Halloween series has had blips in its 42-year history; however, it has weathered the storm.\n\n“I would put the fact that it has endured down to three things. The first maybe seems obvious but tying it to Halloween itself was the masterstroke,” enthused producer Malek Akkad. “It was the original distributor who came up with that name after John Carpenter had written the script. I think number two is just the amazing job that John did to make the original film and create that lore. He was a tour de force from the way he shot it through to the score. He teed it up perfectly to have a lasting legacy. The original movie still stands up.”\n\nAkkad’s late father, Moustapha Akkad, executed all of the Halloween movies from the first one to Halloween: Resurrection in 2002.\n\n“Thirdly, it was bringing Michael Myers back,” he added. At the end of Halloween II, the hospital explodes, so that’s really the end of Myers, then they tried to do Halloween III: Season of the Witch, and that would have been it. We would not have had the continuation of the franchise at all if it were not for my father, and I give him credit here, who just said, ‘Well, why can’t we bring him back?’ Everyone thought he was crazy because Myers exploded. That reaction only encouraged him even more, so that’s why he called it Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, so it was right out there. I think those three things set it up for continued success as well as all the fantastic talent that has been part of the legacy along the way.”\n\nThe sequels Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers are the installments returning to drive-ins and theaters alongside the 1978 original. They grossed $17.8 million and $11.6 million at the box office, respectively, on their initial releases, and while they aren’t the best-reviewed entries, fans continue to show them love.\n\n“The thing I find fascinating is that there’s something in each of the Halloween movies for somebody, and you can never really see what that is. There are the detractors for each of the films too,” Akkad mused. “I think part of it, as it’s tied to the holiday so much and often a moment in time for people when it came out or when they saw it, it’s very personal. There are so many reasons and things that solidify that. When I get to meet the fans, which I love to do as they’re just a lovely bunch of people, for whatever reason, they have their favorites and their reasons for it.”\n\nA revival of the franchise with Halloween in 2018, the first entry in a new trilogy, proved a critical and commercial success. It grossed $255.5 million at the worldwide box office. The sequel, Halloween Kills, was due to be released in theaters on Friday, October 16, 2020. The movie was pushed back a year because of the pandemic and will now land on Friday, October 15, 2021.\n\n“Universal UVV Pictures got behind Halloween and did a marketing campaign the likes of which we’ve never seen on this franchise. Not only was it the marketing campaign, but also a fantastic director, David Gordon Green, and, of course, Blumhouse Productions,” Akkad said. “The franchise has many suitors, but ultimately it does come down to the belief in the studio to fund it properly. A lot of our missteps were where people wanted to underfund it to save a buck. It takes a lot of money, so I give Universal a lot of credit. They’ve probably got one of the greatest marketing teams in the industry, if not the best, and you can feel their belief in the film and the IP. We’ve seen that even more so with Halloween Kills. Part of the decision to move it to next year was because they know they have a great film and everyone involved in it creatively felt the same way.”\n\nMichael Myers, Akkad believes, is finally appreciated again.\n\n“When you talk appreciation, you’re speaking to what I went through for many years at the previous studios where it wasn’t appreciated. One of our biggest points of disagreement was that some of them were looking at Halloween as a way to try to make a quick buck. I was looking at it from the standpoint of making a great film that was well-acted and well-directed. There was a disconnect, and thankfully, with the new home at Universal, they get it. I mean, it’s the home of all the movie monster legends, right?”\n\nFreimann added, “Halloween has always been there. I think it’s exciting to see what Blumhouse is doing to move it forward. Bringing these legacy films back into circulation with these October screenings supports that. We’ve been carrying the torch of Michael Myers with our company for 40 years. It’s been the work of Malik, especially after the passing of his father, to make sure the films are done in a way that isn’t a cash grab.”\n\n“It’s simply to respect this franchise, this amazing character, the incredible fans, and try to make the best possible film with what we have. That’s why somebody like David Gordon Green, who comes from a variety of different genres, can knock it out of the park. He did it with Halloween 2018, and he’s doing it again with Halloween Kills, which you will see for yourself when it comes out.”\n\nCould the Halloween revival go beyond the current trilogy at Universal?\n\n“You know, Michael is also a meandering kind of guy, so we’ll see how long this lasts for him,” mused a cagey Akkad.\n\n“I would love to have a crystal ball forecast that but the current intention is, and has always been, that David Gordon Green create a trilogy with this story,” chimed Freimann. “I think fans will always clamor for more Michael Myers, and there will always be an appetite for that. Hopefully, we’ll have the opportunity to keep bringing amazing films to an audience that wants them.”\n\nHe concluded, “I’ve seen more interest in Halloween over the last few years. I think Halloween 2018 brought in a new group of fans who had never seen the original films. The desire is there to search these out, and to see them in such a unique way, at a drive-in movie theater, is a blessing. I’m excited to go.”\n\n“I haven’t had a chance to do it yet, but I’m looking forward to that opportunity to take my wife and experience it that way. It is a bridge; it provides time for more people to understand the character and the origins better, so we see it is a silver lining that this has come together this year, and it leads us nicely towards Halloween Kills next October.”"
