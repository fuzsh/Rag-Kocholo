        "text": "As the year comes to a close, I would like to share some of the films that I saw for the first time during this most recent revolution around the sun. None of these are in any particular order.\n\nThe Message (dir. Moustapha Akkad, 1976)\n\nThe Message is an epic masterpiece chronicling the rise, tribulation, and early triumph of nascent Islam. The film was directed by Moustapha Akkad, who is perhaps most famous for his later involvement with the John Carpenter’s classic horror film Halloween (1978) and all of its sequels up to Halloween Resurrection in 2002. His son, Malek, has been involved in all of the films since, including the two Rob Zombie films.\n\nOne likely wouldn’t expect a film as religiously driven as The Message to be from the same creative stock as the great pioneer of slasher films, but the versatility of Akkad showcases the holistic power that films can have. Sometimes you just want to make an atmospheric horror film to frighten an audience. Other times, the filmic medium becomes the channel for which to fulfill a religious obligation. Such was the case for Akkad, who sought to present his religion to the Western world."
