        "text": "Moustapha Akkad, producer of the cult \"Halloween\" slasher series and the director of three of his own religious-themed films, died Friday after suffering injuries from the hotel bombings in Jordan.\n\nAkkad, 75, and his 34 year-old daughter, Rima Akkad Monla, were in the lobby of the Radisson SAS in Amman when bombs went off in a simultaneous attack on three area hotels; Monla also died.\n\nAkkad, a Los Angeles resident, had enjoyed a nearly 20-year career in filmmaking despite the difficulties of being Arabic and Muslim in Hollywood. The native Syrian began by directing his own Muslim-themed films: \"The Message\" (1976) and \"Lion of the Desert\" (1981). Following the resulting acclaim and religious controversy, Akkad turned to horror films, executive producing John Carpenter‘s legendary \"Halloween\" (1978)."
