        "text": "The LTA has confirmed the squad to face Sweden in the Billie Jean King Cup from 11-12 November at the Copper Box Arena.\n\nThe nominated players are: Katie Boulter, Jodie Burrage, Harriet Dart and Heather Watson\n\nLexus GB Billie Jean King Captain, Anne Keothavong said: “I’m delighted that all our strongest ranked players have made themselves available for the Billie Jean King Cup tie versus Sweden next month. We are very excited to have yet another opportunity to play in front of a home crowd, especially at the Copper Box Arena where the fans were so instrumental in helping get us over the line when we last played there a few years ago. Finally, being able to captain this team is always a huge privilege and to bring live tennis back to where I grew up, means a great deal to me on a personal level.”\n\n(Photo by Rob Casey/SNS Group via Getty Images)\n\nCopper Box Arena is playing host to the Billie Jean King Cup for the second time after a successful result in 2019 when Great Britain defeated Kazakhstan 3-1 in front of 11,000 fans across both days.\n\nGB and Sweden are competing for a place in the 2024 Billie Jean King Cup Qualifiers. In 2022, the Lexus GB team recorded their best finish in the competition since 1981 by reaching the semi-finals, but following defeat to France in this year’s Qualifiers, they must now face Sweden in a Play-off tie to keep alive the possibility of a return to the Billie Jean King Cup Finals in 2024.\n\nGreat Britain and Sweden are tied 3-3 in their Billie Jean King Cup head-to-head, with Sweden winning the last three ties contested between the teams. The most recent meeting, in a 2012 World Group II Play-Off saw Sweden come out on top 4-1 at home in Boras."
