        "text": "LET’S START THE YEAR with a burst of Ixionic whimsy, this time on the vexed question of tollgates: “Anachronisms. That is the only long word I know. It was a pet word of my colonel’s in the great war, and I took it up to curry favour with him. Unfortunately, I didn’t quite understand it, and when I applied it to a bad egg, he expounded its true meaning to me at length. It means a tollgate. The other week I remarked that tollgates were moribescent, so to speak—dear me, that colonel has a lot to answer for—and ever since I have had a perfect avalanche of letters from irate motor cyclists, whose jaunts awheel are hampered by these survivals of the Middle Ages. The most pathetic is from a gentleman resident in Barmouth and fiancé to a damosel at Portmadoc. These conditions imply a quite expensive spruceness in personal appearance. Buttonholes. New chamois gloves. Then there are chocolates. Finally, two shilling tollgates in as many miles. And the Government appeals to us to be economical, and lend it our money! Another wistful epistle is signed by a Bachelor of Divinity belonging to one of the Nonconformist denominations. I understand that a padre of this connection usually serves about half a gross of chapels dotted over a huge area. My correspondent labours in a part of the country which simply bristles with tollgates. Here is a chance for the Ministry of Transport to wield the super-axe with great popularity.”\n\nWHIMSY FROM IXION COMES as no surprise but on t’other side of the pond even engineers could let there hair down. Here’s a weekend project suggested by one Lawrence Hamilton in Popular Science Monthly: “A one-cylinder motorcycle engine, a pair of small airplane wheels (or motorcycle wheels), an old bicycle, and a 2inx12inx10ft plank are the materials I used to make this air-driven tricycle. The motor and wheels were bought at a nearby motorcycle shop for $10. A 5ft. length of the plank was used for the floor of the machine. One end was bolted to the rear axle and the other end clamped to the frame of the bicycle after the rear wheel, seat, hanger, and chain were removed. The clamps were made as shown. The motor mounting, places directly over the rear axle, was made from the remainder of the plank. A piece 18in. long formed the back of the mounting and the sides were two pieces 20in. long, one side of each tapering from 12in at the bottom to 5in at the top. The front was covered with a large board hinged at the side. It gives access to the interior of the motor mounting containing the gasoline tank, batteries, and coil. When closed, this door forms the back of the seat. As the gasoline thank is lower than the carburettor, air pressure is used to force up the gasoline. This is provided with an ordinary bicycle pump. Lag screws were passed through holes in the lugs of the motor into the motor mounting to hold it secure. The only control is a throttle placed on the left side of the seat, arranged so that the left side of the seat, arranged so that upon pressing it down the gas-valve opens, as shown in the diagram. The propeller was made from a No 1 white pine 2×4, carefully shaped and balanced. It was fasted on the crankshaft of the motor by means of locknuts and a pin through the propeller and shaft.”\n\n“BRIGHT WEATHER AND GOOD ROADS made the Glasgow Western MCC New Year ‘point to point’ run to Perth a most enjoyable outing. The run was the same as previous years—to Perth and back, with checks at Stirling both ways. Amongst the competing machines there were several new models, some of which had not been seen in competition on the northern side of the Border before. R Watson was riding a 1922 Martinsyde sidecar outfit, and G Templeton was riding a 3½hp of the same make. The Royal Scot, ridden by J Donaldson, did credit to itself on this its first appearance in competition work. J Bell (7hp AJS sc), who is only fourteen, and his passenger, who is rather less, had difficulty in holding their youthful spirits in check. They confided to our representative on the return journey that they thought these trials tame affairs. Of the 35 starters 22 finished; last year, with a larger entry, only seven competitors finished.”\n\nWHILE WORKING FOR INDIAN’S London depot, where he had developed the 8-valve twin, Bert le Vack was sourcing alcohol for esoteric racing fuels from a London distillery. This led to an offer to move to JAP, where Le Vack used his experience upgrading the 1,000cc Indian Powerplus (on which he had won the 1921 Brooklands 500-Mile Race) to produce a 986cc ohv ‘super twin’ that he called a ‘Yank-buster’. The engine became a world-beater; (Indian subsequently dropped out of international competition). The official JAP company history records: “The famous rider, H Le Vack, was engaged six weeks before the TT races, and a conference held to decide if two engines could possibly be completed for the event. It was decided to make the effort to complete two engines in three weeks; a schedule was drawn up allowing so many days for making detailed drawings, patterns, castings, and for machining all parts; the engines were ready ‘on the dot; and Le Vack rode to an immediate success.”\n\n“SIR,—THINKING YOUR READERS might be interested, I venture to relate a little experience that befell me the other evening when returning from a run. After slowing up near Hammersmith to allow passengers to board a tramcar I engaged gears, and was preparing to accelerate when my machine gave a roar and stopped. On checking over I found everything in apparent good order, plenty of petrol, valves OK, gears properly home etc. Mystified I put the machine on the stand and was walking round to the near side to inspect the magneto when I felt a tug at my neck. The ‘mystery’ was solved. The day being cold I was wearing a very long scarf of fine wool, which I allow to hang almost to my knees. It had worked free from underneath me, and one end had been sucked through the long air pipe fitted to the Amac carburetter on the Sports Sunbeam, and was firmly wedged in the slides.\n\nSF Seyfried.\n\n[Instances of this kind spoiling a non-stop run in a trial have been recorded.—Ed.]\n\n“SIR,—I HAVE BEEN MUCH IMPRESSED by the kind attention to details that you give in answering what would appear to be, in many cases, difficult questions, and, though I feel it to be rather a selfish demand on your valuable time and space, I am in hopes that you might be able to help me in a little undertaking of mine. As there seems to be a vast amount of sewage space literally crying out for a fuller use, I intend to endeavour to construct a subterrabrain waveium, and the following are the points on which I solicit your kind advice :\n\n(1) Would a 1914 Auto-Wheel develop sufficient power to propel it?\n\n(2) Would you suggest 14 or 16 blades to the propeller or paddles?\n\n(3) Should they be forged steel or cast iron, as I propose to make them of material 4x4in or 8x8in?\n\n(4) Would you suggest a pilot jet or just an ordinary rudder for purpose of navigation?\n\n(5) Is duroleum preferable to linoleum or paper saturated with petroleum the best material with which to construct the watertight compartments?\n\n(6) How often would you propose I should take up the bearings, and, as there seems considerable controversy on the subject, I want to ‘get well down to it’?\n\n(7) Which, in your opinion, is the best dual-purpose contrivance on the market to serve as diving-bell and state cabin?\n\n(8) When ordering my rubber boots, have I to state the size of my feet or the size of the boots?\n\n(9) What would happen if I reversed the figures?\n\n(10) How much would the driving licence cost to one who is habitually sparing with the soda on principle?\n\n(11) Would it be necessary, absolutely, to have a tank when there are such excellent feeding bottles to be procured at a much smaller cost?\n\n(12) Could you descant on the value of its imperishability with relation to the nebular hypothesis?\n\n(13) As I propose to construct it to bend in order to negotiate sharp corners, could you advise me as to the most suitable hinge on the market?\n\n(14) As I also propose to make the frame of 12xl2in pitch pine, would you recommend adhesive tape or just ordinary tinned tacks for the joints—it is to be annealed in any case?\n\nJA Cheek.\n\n“UP TO THE PRESENT only one designer has tackled the problem of evolving a commercially possible radial for motor cycle use which, as a lightweight engine, was fully described in our pages. The same designer has now evolved a much more ambitious engine (still adhering to the three-cylinder layout), which, named the Cyclone, is being manufactured by SYS Engineering of Leeds…The crank case, of aluminium, is in two symmetrical halves, and the cast iron cylinders (63.5×101.6mm=963cc) are held down on studs in the usual way. The combustion heads are of the T-shaped variety, and the cast iron pistons have deeply concave tops. Cast integrally with the crank case sections are extensions which house the timing gears; these gears consist of a stationary internally toothed ring, a toothed wheel carrying four cams and an eccentric mounted on the crankshaft. In its oscillations the eccentric causes the wheel to roll round the ring, and the cams are brought in turn under the tappets; obviously as there are four cams on the one wheel, this must revolve, only once to eight revolutions of the engine crank-case shaft…A noticeable feature of the engine is the remarkably cool running, due both to the vaned flywheel and to the enormous cooling area of the seven ribs on the cylinder…On the test bench we observed an engine working, and noticed that its range of smooth running varied between about 600 and well over 3,000rpm; while on the road in a light cycle car we found that the speed obtainable was extremely high.”\n\n“WORCESTER &DMCC: EARL BEAUCHAMP (patron of the club) took the chair at the recent annual dinner, being supported by Vicount Deerhurst, Mr TW Badgery (president) and Mrs Badgery, the Mayor of Worcester (Mr Samuel Southell), Ald A Carlton, and a representative assembly, including several well-known riders and motor cycle manufacturers.”\n\n“PRAISE FOR POLICE: WE HAVE had several letters from London-Exeter competitors appreciating the services of helpers and police, who, through the long, wet, and windy night directed the riders on their muddy way to Exeter.”\n\n“THE MARKETING OF MOTOR CYCLES in the United States of America is exercising the minds of sales and financial experts at the present time. The following statement appears in Automotive Industries as being from within the motor cycle industry: ‘We strive to reach a field of dignified clean cut riders. To do so we educate them in terms, of exalted speed and dare-devil exploits of track burners. We bemoan the presence of public disfavour, and to remove it we increase the burden by eternally shouting speed, speed, and more speed.’ In Great Britain the motor cycle has taken its place in all spheres of utility, and speed is not the chief factor.”\n\n“BOHEMIAN MCC: A MOTOR CYCLE CLUB has been formed in Southampton, and has been christened as above. It is the outcome of a party of enthusiasts who met occasionally for a jaunt in the New Forest; this was followed by an impromptu hillclimb, and within a fortnight the club was formed, and boasted 30 members. Taking into view the fact that the weather is hardly conducive at this time of year [January] to motoring, the start made is a very promising one. A novel feature is that there are no rules or regulations of any description. A most interesting programme has been arranged. Trade and professional riders are entirely excluded.”\n\n“ADVANCE IN DESIGN IS NOWHERE more impressively demonstrated than in such programmes as the Raleigh and AJS,” Ixion remarked. “Both firms deliberately ignore the 500cc engine which has dominated our touring market for so many years. Each firm selects a biggish twin for sidecar work, and specialises in a light, high-efficiency 2¾hp for the solo man. It is only a few years ago that the thought of unrestricted touring on a 2¾hp machine seemed like a Christmas nightmare. To-day many hardy spirits attach sidecars to machines of even less than and manage to go almost anywhere with them.”\n\nIXION, IF ONE MIGHT BORROW from colonial baseball parlance, was in the habit of writing ‘out of left field’. And sometimes he left the stadium altogether: “After road trouble one day (broken crankshaft, I think), I dived into a train in motion, and, to my joy espied a magazine left on the seat by some departed passenger. My hopes of mental refreshment during an irksome non-stop were rebuffed when I found the journal was Blue Bells (or words to that effect) and its principal contributor a certain ‘Aunt Rosie’, who advised fair readers what immediate action to apply if they spotted Bertie taking another maiden to the cinema. To-day I find myself compelled to play a similar role. The flapper who flaps on the bracket of a reader signing himself ‘Big Four’ is tired of her parrot perch, and yearns for a ‘bus of her own. ‘Big Four’ promptly procured a sheaf of folders describing the best baby two-stroke. Not a bit of it. Miranda insists on a sports model of not less than 500cc. This time ‘Big Four’ has come to the right man. I have often been there. There are two modes of action, the suaviter in modo (otherwise, the velvet glove) and the fortiter in re (otherwise, the iron hand). The iron hand policy consists simply and solely of getting another flapper. ‘Big Four’ informs me in a lugubrious postscript that he has thought of this only to reject it (he has my sympathy, whether he is alluding to compromising letters, or to the fact that, like Little Willie in front of Verdun, he is too deeply engaged to withdraw). The velvet glove (cheer up, ‘Big Four’!) consists of borrowing…well, this almost needs a paragraph to itself. Let ‘Big Four’ procure an extremely large ‘bus—998cc, if possible. Let him carefully detune it so far as to make starting difficult. A wide plug gap. Air leaks at every joint in the induction pipe. No 3 spirit in the tank. Seccotine in the oil tank. Let him then select a day on which the temperature is low and the sky overcast. Let the road then be taken. ‘Big Four’ will start the lady’s ‘bus at the outset (a surreptitious injection of methyl ether is recommended). The lady must then be tempted to a scrap, and allowed to get the better of it. Within a mile or so ‘Big Four’ must allow himself to be left, whereupon he will lay bare his rear tube, unscrew and remove the tyre valve therefrom. This will give him a strafe-proof excuse to push home. The lady will be left wrestling with the unstartable 7-9hp, scaling some 3cwt. When she finally returns, she will be in an extremely chastened condition, and it will be found that, for the future, she prefers a Levis Popular to anything on wheels. Personally, I do not commend such mean-spirited handling of a restive damosel. I believe in beginning as you mean to go on—in getting the girl properly to heel right at the outset. But as ‘Big Four’ is clearly only about 0.35 of a man, he may prefer the latter of my two alternatives.”\n\n“THE YEAR 1921 WAS NOT a pleasant financial one for motor cyclists. We bought dear, and we sold—if, indeed, we were able to sell at all—quite abominably cheap. Consequently, like all wise men, I limited my purchases as far as possible, and depended, as far as passible, for new experiences on Press trials. The trade was producing plenty of new stuff, and was anxious for publicity; so my note-book reveals that I sampled the paces of some 50 different bicycles, sidecars, and cycle cars for periods of varying duration. I select for serious attention three machines which I either owned or used for over 2,000 miles apiece. All my hackwork was performed on a baby two-stroke, a 2½hp Cedos. There are so many machines of this type upon the road nowadays that I dare not acclaim my selection as the absolute best; but if there is a better machine in this class, I shall be very happy to. make its acquaintance. Its reliability is absolute, no trouble of any sort or kind resulting from a full year of daily hard work, coupled with the most brutal neglect; an occasional\n\nsooted plug or choked jet were the sole blots on its faithful service, and these trivial items must rank as inevitable, whatever one owns. Its power is quite up to the standard in this class, 45mph being obtainable on top gear, whilst main road hills create no anxiety on bottom. Its two chief features are its extraordinary comfort and cleanliness. Devoid of oil leaks, thanks to perfect machining and fitting of all joints, it remains almost equally virgin of road stains, thanks to a light, substantial and admirably designed underscreen, good mudguards and efficient leg-shields. The under-shield on the Cedos is a forward extension of the rear mudguard. I frequently rode it in tennis flannels, in good tweeds, and even in black Sabbath garments—tests of which few motor cycles are worthy. Its comfort demands a more technical analysis than I have the knowledge to execute, and I have never owned a lightweight which I cared to hog over bad roads as I hogged this Cedos. The one and only criticism which I can pass upon it is that its carburetter was never worthy of it; the fuel consumption was too high—just under 60mpg—and the response to the control levers was never the same on two consecutive days. Next in order of gratitude I must rank a sports Sunbeam, specially geared rather low to compensate for my clumsy driving in freak trials, and to permit of sure climbing when a neglected engine dropped a little tune. If this machine had ever stalled me by the road I should have felt the same amazement as if the sun failed to rise one morning. It inspires the most supreme confidence, evincing a quite remarkable freedom from even the pettiest stoppages or sulkiness. Its middle gear would take a really clever rider anywhere, for the engine develops tremendous power, and, unlike some ‘revvers’, it can pull uncommonly hard at quite low engine speeds. A little bit inclined to be rough and\n\ncoarse at its most hurried gaits, I did not press it in the way of speed, but at high touring speeds it ran very smoothly. Its main fault was the location of the gear quadrant, which had a sharp corner just where one’s knee palpitated on bad going. My pleasantest speed experiences occurred on a Scott Squirrel, which is one of the most refined mile-a-minute ‘buses on the surface of the earth. Two factors contribute to the delight of its hurry. The first is the well-known Scott frame—not forgetting the fork. As all practised riders are aware, the glutinous qualities of the Scott chassis—whether in speed cornering or in mere tearaway dashes over moorland tracks or pot-holed tar—are the envy and the despair of nearly every rival designer. For comfort, steering, and safety, it is as nearly peerless as any competitive article can hope to be; and it is obviously useless to own a super-engine if the frame makes you nervous about opening the throttle except on those rare occasions when you find a perfect road in perfect condition. Secondly, the torque of a twin-cylinder two-stroke is so smooth that the Squirrel’s speed does not set you wondering whether a crumpled connecting rod is going to emerge sideways out of the crankcase at any moment; and the high gear ratio permits you to touch railway speeds with out revving the engine up to its kicking point.”\n\nAS USUAL, THE MOTOR CYCLE published a comprehensive TT report; as usual you’ll find it in the features section. But Geoff Davison, who (spoiler alert) won the Lightweight, went on to become editor of the TT Special and, in 1947, published The Story of the TT. So before reading the full preview and report, you might enjoy this straight-from-the-horse’s-mouth report as an hors d’oeuvre. Over to you, Geoff: “The very fact that Howard Davies had won the 1921 Senior on a Junior mount gave rise once again to the old cry that the machines were getting too fast for the course and there was considerable agitation to reduce the Senior capacity to 350cc and the Junior to 250. The ACU and the imperturbable Mr Loughborough were not amused. Very wisely they left the Senior and Junior as they were and created a real race with a Trophy of its own for what had hitherto been known as the Lightweight class. It was in 1922, therefore, that the three TT races as we know them today—Senior, Junior and Lightweight—first got together. And in 1922 three new stars were born, all of whom were to make TT history in the years that followed. Between them they have won 15 TT races and made 28 fastest laps. I refer to those three brilliant riders, Wal Handley, Jim Simpson and Stanley Woods. Surely they were the greatest trio that the TT has ever seen and it is a coincidence that they should all have been ‘new boys the same term’. Each was in a different race that year—Wal Handley (OK) in the Lightweight, Stanley Woods (Cotton) in the Junior and Jim Simpson (Scott) in the Senior. The Lightweight event, although a separate TT race for the first time, was\n\nrun concurrently with the Junior, the Lightweight riders all being despatched first. The race received an entry of 32—11 more than the previous year—with 13 different makes. From the entries it was obvious that it would be a battle between the four-strokes and two-strokes. The 1920 Lightweight class had been won by a two-stroke and the 1921 event by a four-stroke—the ‘know-alls’ said the days of the two-strokes were ended. Four-strokes were represented mainly by seven New Imperials with JAP engines and by Coulson, Massey-Arran, OK, Rex-Acme and Sheffield-Henderson with Blackburne engines. The principal two-strokes were Levis, Sun Vitesse and Velocette, each with their own power units. I personally had learnt a lot from the 1921 event. This had shown me that acceleration was all-important and that one of the best ways of improving acceleration was to reduce weight. Bob Newey, the Levis designer, had promised me the best possible engine he could make and I myself set about reducing the weight of the machine. I had the run of the factory and, as sets of TT fittings came through, I selected the lightest of each. I dispensed with such ‘pansy’ fittings as sock-absorbers, footrest-rubbers and so one, and the net result was that my Levis, although the same to look at as the others, was nearly 40lb lighter than any of them! In addition I went in for personal weight reduction—straight slimming by cutting down beer, etc, and further weight reductions by use of light clothes. My riding kit—this was before leathers were compulsory—consisted of a crash helmet, tight-fitting cricket sweater, wash-leather gloves, drill breeches, stockings and dance pumps. I’m glad I didn’t fall off! It is interesting to note, too, that although I was by no means the lightest rider—in spite of my almost tropical attire—the combined weight of myself and my machine was over two stone less than that of any other rider and machine in the race. Actually my Levis and I weighed about four stones less than Doug Prentice and his New Imperial and six stone less than Wal Handley and his OK. I thought that was good! The race from my point of view was uneventful. I took only one real risk, when I came over Ballaugh Bridge on the first lap in a group of four riders and on the wrong side of the road for the following right-hand bend. The somewhat hectic results of this adventure steadied me down and I took care not to do it again! Wal Handley (OK) and Doug Prentice and Bert Kershaw (New Imperials) were the favourites and Wal indeed, true to the fame which he was to win later, set off full\n\nbore to make a record first lap in 44min 24sec (at 51.01mph), 11 seconds better than my own time. Bert Kershaw was third, just over a minute behind me. Then Wal broke down and from then onwards I had no-one to worry me. My Levis, due to the combination of its magnificent little engine and extremely low weight, had terrific acceleration and ran like a train. I led Bert Kershaw by two minutes on the second lap and by nearly four minutes on the third lap when I came into refill. Bert packed up in the fourth lap, letting Dan Young (Rex Acme) into second place, ten minutes behind me. I slowed down for the fifth and final lap, but Dan slowed down more and I won by just over 13 minutes with an absolutely no-trouble run. SJ Jones (Velocette) was third, a minute-and-a-quarter behind Young. Two-strokes were first and third and the clever fellows who had said they were finished began to think again. Actually my speed was 49,89mph and time 3hr 46min 56sec—32sec better than Jack Thomas who finished third in the Junior event. I was very pleased indeed to have won the Lightweight Trophy, but at the same time I could not help wishing that the regulations had been the same as for the previous year—in which case I should have clicked for third place in the Junior as well!” And here’s an extra note, courtesy of the Blue ‘Un: “The winning Levis purred in, its engine running with much the same, smooth power as at the start. It was only some twenty minutes slower over the course than the winning 350cc machine, and its time marks a huge advance on the lightweights of 1921. Judging by Davison’s jaunty appearance, the Levis had given him a very comfortable ride; he seemed tolerably fresh and full of smiles. When it was clear that none of the later starters could beat the times now registered, boy scouts hung laurel wreaths over those columns on the board in which Sheard’s and Davison’s times were posted.”\n\n“ONE OF THE GREATEST DRAWBACKS to the passenger motor cycle is the difficulty of finding suitable housing for it. It is admitted that a machine which is kept a long distance from its owner’s residence is not used so frequently as another which is ‘on the premises’. Especially is this the case in our large cities, where all kinds of expedients have to be resorted to in order to find stabling for one’s steed, at home or otherwise. The writer claims the following as a practical and inexpensive solution of this problem, suitable in many cases where an independent shed is out of the question. Briefly, the idea is to form a cupboard in the house itself, with access from the outside only. In the first place, a lintel should be prepared. This should be 6ft long, and may be either of wood, stone, or concrete. It should be the full thickness of the wall (which would probably be 9in), and if of wood it may be in two lengths, each 4½in wide. The brickwork should then be cut out to receive the lintel. This may, in most cases, be done without any props, providing the wall is fairly well built. It will be found most convenient to make the lintel about 7in deep, and this will occupy the place of two courses of bricks. After this is once fixed and wedged up tight, the brickwork below may safely be taken out, but care must be taken to leave 4½in under each end of the lintel…Inside the room the cupboard may be made to suit individual taste and the purpose to which it is proposed to be put…The finished height above the floor being only 4ft, the top can be made to serve as a table, writing desk, or any useful article of furniture…It will be found to be considerably cheaper than erecting an independent shed, but if the occupier is a tenant only, he should obtain permission from the owner before starting the work…”\n\n“SIX-CYLINDER motor cycles are a rarity, although a few have been described in the columns of The Motor Cycle, the machine illustrated is interesting as being probably the most ambitious mount in the world of single trackers. The last six-cylinder motor cycle we described had a ‘twin-3’ radial engine, which, besides being remarkably light—under 200lb, in fact—ran with a smoothness that could only be likened to an electric motor. Designed and built by a Spanish enthusiast, the machine under review has six cylinders in line, is water cooled, has three speeds and reverse, and is shaft driven. The bore and stroke are 50mm and 60mm respectively, the total capacity being 708cc. As will be seen from the illustrations, the valves are on each side of the cylinders, the cylinder heads are therefore of T formation. Though water-cooled, this fact is not immediately apparent, as the radiator is neatly located in the fore end of the tank. The thermo syphon system is used. It will be observed that the engine, gear box and the various smaller units are neatly disposed, and that the machine has not the appearance of being unduly heavy or cumbersome.”\n\n“MOTOR CYCLISTS ARE DISGRACED by three masked riders who entered a branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland, held up the staff, and stole about £2,000. Hitherto the motor cycle has not been used extensively as an accessory of crime. The machine was a Sunbeam.”\n\n“IF 1921 HAS TAUGHT ME ANYTHING,” Ixion remarked, “it is the unparalleled value of a variable jet Nothing but the laziness of the public prevents these fittings being standardised by universal demand, for, having already two carburetter controls on the average motor cycle, John Citizen is dead against being bothered with a third. The, result is that manufacturers experience a limited demand for the fitting, and as it must increase the cost of a carburetter quite appreciably the average carburetter maker prefers to push a fixed jet. But we are not all of us idle or untechnically minded Speaking for myself, I find that for nine-tenths of my mileage I prefer a small jet; it gives me all the speed and climb which 1 ordinarily want, plus real economy—possibly 110mpg on a 500cc four-stroke engine. For the remaining tenth of my mileage I care nothing about economy, but I yearn for lurid acceleration, intense speed, and terrific climb. This unrestrained tenth of my mileage being irregularly sandwiched into the more docile nine-tenths, changing a fixed jet occasionally does not fit my needs. I like to have jet control, so that a twitch of a lever converts my gentle tourist into a fire-eating road-burner. Those readers who have never tried a jet control should experiment with one in 1922.”\n\n“ALTHOUGH THE REPAIRS HAD NOT finally been completed, Brooklands track was partially re-opened on Wednesday of last week [1 February] mainly, we were told, on account of the keenness of the motor cycle element among its patrons to be ‘at it’ again. It was a glorious, summer-like morning, but the rain of the night before still lay in puddles along the inner edge of the track, guiltily indicating that nearly two months’ work and the use of many tons of concrete had failed to produce the billiard table surface still popularly and erroneously associated with Brooklands. The roar of a healthy single drowning the buzz of two chain-driven Zenith-Bradshaws ‘on test’ suggested that Judd or O’Donovan might be early arrivals, but enquiry revealed the somewhat surprising information that the machine was a P&M. That the makers of such an essentially ‘slogging’, touring type of mount should turn their attention to speed work for the first time after so many years of successful reliability performances is, to say the least, significant. While we were there, P Cunningham on a stripped 3½hp model, lapped at nearly 58mph but previously lap speeds of very much over the mile-a-minute mark had been obtained. It is realised the track is a great teacher, and, even should the P&M remain (almost exclusively) unobtainable as a sports model, much of value may be learned. DR O’Donovan, the unassuming Norton wizard, and his most promising pupil, Judd, were also there—Brooklands would not be Brooklands without them—but not bent on any serious work, although the former gave us to understand that long-distance records would be in danger on the following week. The phrasing is ours, of course, not his…On the whole, the track may be classified as excellent, and to all appearances ready for very high speeds by either motor cycle or car. Without doubt some extraordinary figures will be attained…It is proposed to admit people to the test hill at Brooklands on Sunday afternoons and to allow those who desire to go round the track to do so at a reduced fee. There will also be a band playing.”\n\n“FATHER HAS TO PAY? Recently, at Kingston, a 14-year-old rider was summoned because his number-plate was obscured by the coat of his father, who was riding on the carrier. The boy was fined 10s, but the summons against the father for aiding and abetting was dismissed.”\n\n“IT MAY SURPRISE MANY OF OUR readers to learn that manufacturers of the best known American motor cycles consider long-distance events, such as the London-Edinburgh run, of greater importance from a publicity standpoint than the Tourist Trophy races…America is suffering a trade depression such as she has not experienced for many years, and, as is usual at such times, a close study is being made of the true value of different methods of propaganda. As a result of this, track racing is at a discount…while, as part of a publicity campaign, track racing has been proved to possess a purely local value. In other words, if and when phenomenal speeds are attained in America the rest of the motor cycle world (if the achievement obtains prominence) is unconcerned, or doubts its authenticity. On the other hand, the attainment of a success in a leading British reliability trial or race is accepted as authentic the world over because it is endorsed either by a club of unquestioned integrity and independence or by the governing body of the motor cycle movement in a country whose traditions have always upheld clean sport…In sober fact, Great Britain is recognised as the arena for motor cycle competitions, and the results are reflected, and therefore influence trade, throughout the world.”\n\n“IN AMERICA THE 4HP FLAT-TWIN Harley-Davidson is regarded purely as a solo machine, and although in this country it is often fitted with a light sidecar, and is quite capable of such service, the factory which produces it no doubt regards the fact with something akin to mild surprise. It was with this in mind that we took over one of these machines for a test of its road capabilities and behaviour—particularly as compared with the British conception of an ideal solo mount. Since the ideals of America in this matter are obviously not the ideals of Coventry, Birmingham, or Wolverhampton, it is not surprising that the respective machines should differ considerably both in general design and detail specification. This latter point was very forcibly impressed on us when we rode up to the Harley-Davidson depot in Newman Street on a typical Coventry-built sporting single, and a few minutes later rode away on the American flat twin. An automatic carburetter (Schebler) controlled by the right twist grip, a heel and toe pedal operated clutch, and a service brake (internal expanding) on the right-hand side of the machine instead of the left are the main points in which the Harley differed from our previous mount, but most readers will realise that these factors contained possibilities of half-a-dozen awkward moments in the same number of initial miles. Added to that is the fact that, almost immediately after starting up, we found ourselves negotiating Oxford Street traffic at—so it seemed!—its very worst. The Harley came through this severe test of controllability unscathed and with flying colours. Only in three prolonged traffic blocks was the rider compelled to put down a foot; the slow-running setting of the Schebler saw to it that: the engine was not once involuntarily stopped, and the beautiful balance, good acceleration on second gear, and efficient braking of the machine combined to transport us clear of London traffic with considerable rapidity and without as had been half-feared arousing the ire of taxi-driver, policeman, or ‘bus-driver. All things considered, we think that this performance speaks for itself and that any further comment on the controllability of the machine—which weighs about 280lb—would be superfluous. Further out on the Portsmouth road other characteristics began to make themselves apparent. The engine, as nearly as any reciprocating engine ever will be, is vibrationless at all speeds, and, in conjunction with 27×3½in and 26x3i. tyres on the rear and front wheels respectively, provides such a degree of smooth running and comfort that, in our opinion, it would be absurd to fit a spring frame. Acceleration is not startling, but a quick turn of the\n\nthrottle grip as far open as it will go brings a perfect response from the engine without any of the ‘dead-spot’ misfiring much too common on flat twins with extensive intake manifolds. Exhaust heated inlet pipes are probably responsible for this. On the road the maximum speed—42mph—was disappointing, and a move was made to Brooklands to see if this could be improved upon without retuning; 45mph proved possible on the straight, but no more. If no speed indicator had been fitted we should certainly have estimated the speed at 50, but, while admitting the possibility of an error by the Corbin-Brown speedometer (perhaps caused by the gigantic rear tyre on this particular machine), we have learned not to place too much reliance on personal guesses at velocity. It would be unfair, too, to estimate the fuel consumption during the time the Harley was in our possession, but at touring speeds well above the legal limit 65mpg must be considered a fair average. An early 45 miles cost just the price of one gallon of fuel, but this was considerably improved before we returned the machine. There are no easily-reached hills in Surrey or the adjoining counties that might reasonably be expected to extend the Harley, and therefore it was decided to be content with an ascent of the Brooklands test-hill. Lubrication is by mechanical pump, and in consequence the rider may dismiss the subject from his mind; there is an auxiliary hand pump also. Gear-changing and kick-starting are more efficiently performed after some little experience. The gears are easily ‘found’, but the ‘high’ position of the lever is apt to be disturbed by the skirt of a heavy leather coat. The clutch is smooth in engagement, and the large pedal permits very gradual manipulation. Summarising, the 4hp Harley is extremely smooth running, very controllable, and very comfortable, but is not particularly speedy at anything approaching an economy setting of the carburetter. From all indications it should be just as steady on greasy tramlines as on dry tarmac, and has much to commend it to the hard rider who does not object to more weight than the British manufacturer thinks necessary for this type of motor cycle. Weight spells comfort.\n\n“SIR,—I READ WITH SURPRISE your criticism of the 1922 4hp Harley-Davidson. I feel sure that there must have been something radically wrong with the machine in question. I have now ridden my 4hp Harley (1920) regularly for 15 months, and have covered over 10,000 miles on it. In your criticism you stated that the maximum road speed was 42mph. Without any tuning, other than carburetter adjustments, I attained a speed of 60mph by my speedometer, which I have compared with many others and found correct within 3mph. This speed was attained on the main road between Penrith and Appleby. I have never tried it out on the track. By speedometer, I have many times exceeded 50mph with an adult on the carrier, and occasionally with two on the carrier. I have also exceeded 40mph with three on the carrier. I think the above will testify that the 4hp Harley has plenty of power, and reasonable speed. As to petrol consumption: Last summer I rode down from Appleby to Newport (Salop), at an average speed of 30mph (running time). The total mileage was 185. When I started my tank was full, containing 2¼ gallons of petrol. When I arrived I had exactly a quarter of a gallon left. This works out at 92.5mpg, which leaves very little to be desired. As regards the other points in your criticism, I agree with and heartily endorse them. I think a large majority of the 4hp Harley riders will agree with me.\n\nFour-Up-Solo, Newport, Salop.”\n\n“THE MACHINE DESCRIBED BELOW is the ‘ideal’ of Professor Low, who has been long connected with the motor cycle movement, and has made a careful study of motor cycle design; in fact, his association with the Auto Cycle Union as a judge has placed him in close relationship with all types of machines. His production is of thoroughly sound design and bristles with novel points…A certain section of potential purchasers of motor cycles require a mount which can be ridden in white flannel trousers to the tennis club, or in dress clothes, as well as in everyday garb. Many riders have also expressed a wish for a machine with shaft drive, an even torque, and one which could be hosed after a muddy ride. Such a machine is the Low four-cylinder two-stroke…The charm of the Low machine is that engine and transmission are entirely enclosed, while the general lines are graceful, though unconventional…Pressed steel is used for the frame construction, and serves to\n\nenclose engine and gear, box units and the 2½gal petrol tank, tubes being employed only in the forks and carrier. No attempt has been made to embody rear spring suspension in the design, but the saddle is mounted on duplex laminated springs and a linked stay, while the cantilever-type forks are of light, but strong construction, employing a laminated spring. For the first time in the history of the motor cycle movement four-cylinder two-stroke engine forms the power unit of a single track vehicle. Though of the three-port variety, the engine design shows originality; the cylinders form a ribbed monobloc casting, but with air passages between each…The inlet and exhaust manifolds are one casting, so that the incoming charge is adequately heated by the exhaust…Engine and three-speed gear box form a complete unit…As the final drive is by shaft and bevel, the drive to the shaft universal joint is through a train of gear wheels…The propeller-shaft is enclosed by a telescopic sleeve, a portion of which can be slid backwards to allow disconnection with the drive in the event of the rear wheel requiring to be withdrawn…front and rear wheels are interchangeable, while if a sidecar should be fitted the wheel of this will also be interchangeable. Though only 492cc, the machine is designed to take a sidecar, and cup-shaped threaded holes are provided in the frame construction into which a ball joint may be inserted…A Rotax dynamo is mounted over the gear box, and is driven by a train of gear wheels. The dynamo supplies current for ignition as well as for\n\nlighting: a coil and accumulator being used in conjunction with a distributer mounted at the forward end of the crankshaft…For the purpose of carrying out ordinary adjustments to plugs or distributer, it is only necessary to open the doors in the frame…The weight of the machine is 2901b; 26×2½in tyres are fitted on wheels fitted with internal expanding brakes which come away intact with the wheel; front and rear brakes are interchangeable…Despite its rough state, the experimental machine ran extremely well. There was no silencer fitted at the time of our brief test, but the exhaust made a delightful hum reminiscent of a miniature aeroplane, while the acceleration was all that could be desired, and the engine ran with the smoothness of an eight-cylinder, there being four impulses per revolution…The saddle suspension and forks were most comfortable, but it is admitted that the rake of the steering was a quarter of an inch out, while the design of the handle-bars was not ideal. Still, these are but trivial points, and for an experimental model its behaviour was quite remarkable.”\n\n“SENT AT MIDDAY FROM PARIS in a Goliath aeroplane, a Gnome and Rhone motor cycle was delivered to the Brussels agent within six hours, including passing through the Customs. It is stated that the cost of transport was less than by express train.”\n\n“SPEED-MEN WILL BE INTERESTED to learn that a number of the actual machines entered by the BSA Company in the TT last year are now available, completely rebuilt and renovated, at an extremely moderate figure.”\n\n“THE FRENCH NATIONAL FUEL, the ingredients of which have hitherto been kept secret, consists of high-grade petrol, alcohol, cyclo-hexanol, and phenol. Naturally, petrol forms the greater part of the mixture.”\n\n“THE LAW STATES QUITE DEFINITELY that a licence to drive a motor-propelled bicycle may be issued to any individual who shall have attained the, age of 14 years. Yet the same law does not differentiate between this young person and toothless, tottering old age, nor between the degenerate, the mentally unsound, the blind, the deaf, and the hopeless cripple. It may, therefore, be quite reasonably assumed that the law—itself termed a ‘hass’—has very carefully refrained from admitting that because a licence to drive a motor bicycle is issuable at the age of 14, therefore, as a natural sequence, as it were, the individual of 14, male or female, is fitted so to drive, and is an absolutely responsible person. How many boys of 14 are actually capable of handling a machine at the legal age for licensing? I submit that quite a considerable number are capable many more, in fact, than are generally credited. And, further, I venture to state that the ownership of a motor cycle—preferably of the small lightweight type—provides at once, a healthy stimulus to the boy or girl of 14, whereby much that is desirable in youth—care, discrimination, thoughtfulness, a keen eye for detail, the faculty of observation, good temper, judgment, and pluck—is encouraged and developed in a manner far more natural than under many other conditions…Of course there is dust, of course there is noise and grease, but there is sun and wind and rain; and it all calls for the exercise of those qualities of endurance which we value so highly, while the need to care for one’s own personal safety and the absolutely necessary consideration for the safety of other people, is bound to eradicate any trait of recklessness which may have existed in the first days of ownership—when, proud of the capacity to manage a machine, the youngster opens up his throttle and lets her ‘rip’ along the high road…It must sharpen the wits of any youngster and inflame his natural curiosity when accosted with a modern power unit, while the desire to comprehend everything connected with it will make even a dull and somewhat stupid fellow liven up…It is a foregone conclusion that any youngster not attracted by machinery is sick, or dull, or unusually constructed…I am positive that, with due safeguarding, the possession of such a machine can only result in good.”\n\nLt Col FS Brereton CBE [chairman of the ACU].\n\n“SIR,—AS A STEADY, MIDDLE-AGED ‘potterer’, I have read with alarm the article, ‘Motor Cycles for Boys and Girls’, by Lt-Col Brereton. Surely we motor cyclists have enough to bear from road-hogs, chars-a-bancs, etc, without our terrors being added to. I think I can claim a greater knowledge of boys than Lt-Col Brereton, as in the course of my duties I come into personal contact with the boys of 500 schools every year, and my experience teaches me that the average boy of 14-16 years of age is a reckless, irresponsible dare-devil, entirely devoid of nerves. I will not accuse him of being selfish, but he is certainly thoughtless (what boy isn’t?). It was this very recklessness, dare-devilry, call it what you will, in our young pilots (Heaven bless them!) which gained us our supremacy in the air during the. war, but we don’t want it illustrated on our roads. The law which grants licences to boys of 14 must certainly be a ‘hass’. The motor cyclist who is shortsighted, deaf or crippled knows his limits, and the rest of us have little to fear from him, but the average boy of 14 wants speed, and knows no limit. Fortunately, we see very few boy motor cyclists on the road, which makes me think that parents are evidently of the same opinion as\n\nXH 3296, Canterbury.”\n\n“A SPECIAL PRIZE IS TO BE given to the driver of the first sidecar outfit to climb the new Kent hill ‘find’ that figures in the Woolwich Club’s opening invitation run on March 12th. The discovery, first brought to light in the Correspondence columns of The Motor Cycle, is arousing great interest, and the officials are receiving many inquiries.”\n\n“NO GREATER CONTRAST IS IMAGINABLE than last Saturday’s trial of the Essex MC and the previous week-end’s event of the Coventry club; the former was the more sensible, but the latter was more enjoyable.”\n\n“QUITE ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING machines which we have been able to examine and handle is now undergoing preliminary road tests in an experimental form. Originated by Mr E Poppe, it will be produced in conjunction, with Mr G Packman, of Rochester, and it is hoped that it will be ready for the market in the autumn of the present year. Though in its present form the machine differs somewhat from the production model, the essentials are embodied and are undergoing prolonged tests. A White and Poppe two-stroke engine of 250cc is fitted, and the gear is a Sturmey-Archer lightweight three-speed, with clutch and kick-starter. It is intended that these two parts shall be embodied in a single unit, the Sturmey-Archer gear parts being fitted in an extension of the crankcase. The engine is to be increased in bore so as to bring it within the 350cc class, and a mechanical pump will supply oil from a sump between the crank and gear box partitions. By a clever piece of design (not shown in our illustrations) the whole engine and its accessories can be closed in by side shields, which are neatly fastened to the tank. These side pieces splay outwards at the front, and they are curved round to form leg shields, which help to deflect air over the engine and keep the rider free from oil as well as mud, yet they can be detached in a few seconds…A short run on the road convinced us that the machine is thoroughly comfortable, and steers perfectly at speeds over 10mph; at slower speeds an improvement might be made, and the matter is receiving attention at the moment.”\n\n“WEEK-ENDING AT COUNTRY HOUSES has made me [Ixion, inevitably] realise what a number of people, resident at fair distances from stations, churches, post-offices, and the like, are looking to the motor cycle as a possible tender to their cars. I can recall at this moment a score of households which maintain something like a 20hp Austin as their main transport and have since the war invested in some sort of a two- wheeler as a dinghy to the yacht. Madam wants to go to church, or to the station, or to post, when Papa is away with the car there may be two or three dancing and tennis-playing daughters; there is a governess; occasionally the more youthful sort of son, say a Winchester boy on his holidays, requires short distance solo transport. Of course, young Clarence knows all there is to know about motor bikes, as his arguments with the governess at the breakfast table testify. Such households form curious backwaters of the motor cycle world. They muddle and struggle along quite on their own, innocent of club matters, technical matters, and the like, regarding motor cycles much as you arid I, dear reader, regard a. gas meter—as inexplicable boxes of mechanism, which are necessary evils of life under certain conditions. In 1920 and 1921 such families generally bought a scooter. I have yet to encounter one solitary case in which they loved it. It was not very strong on hills. It was quite easily upset. Frequent tumbles seem to have been the rule with it, especially on the part of the fair sex; and its history in their hands makes me rejoice that, before its failings were exposed, this journal gave it a very guarded and critical welcome. Just at present the Ner-a-car is what such families seem to fancy, though the small two-stroke is by no means unknown amongst them.”\n\n“AT A RECENT MEETING OF the Hereford City Council there was a discussion as to the advisability of limiting speed in the city to 10mph. The Mayor of Hereford wisely objected to the imposition of an artificial speed limit, saying that his experience in the police courts had shown him that it was best to deal with ‘road hogs’ by prosecuting them for dangerous driving, his opinion being that any speed limit was an encouragement to drive at that speed irrespective of risk to others.”\n\n“MR ALAN W DAY, THE HONORARY SECRETARY of the North London MCC, one of the most enterprising Southern clubs, sends us the following letter for publication: ‘With reference to the annual rally on Good Friday at Richmond (Yorks), this club and several other similar organisations in the South are awaiting with interest the publication of the full regulations governing this year’s event. In 1921 a band of enthusiasts from the North London MCC made the long journey to the Northern market town, leaving the Metropolis on Thursday evening after the usual day’s toil, snatching refreshments and a few hours’ sleep at Bawtry, and arriving at Richmond with none too much time to spare before the count at 12.45pm. Your interested readers will recollect that an attempt was made (and duly frustrated) to disqualify the Londoners on the grounds that they had not travelled the whole distance on the day of the rally—a feat well-nigh impracticable—although there was no clause in the rules to that effect. If the energetic organisers intend to include such an irksome restriction (from the point of view of Southern clubs) in this year’s regulations, it is suggested that its seeming harshness be somewhat tempered by fixing the hour for the count considerably later in the afternoon, say, 3pm. This compromise would, at least, give the enthusiastic clubs a sporting chance, even though they dare not put foot to kick-start until the last stroke of the hour of midnight on the previous day. It is confidently assumed that our Yorkshire friends would welcome parties from Southern clubs, and in view of the foregoing facts and suggestions, it is repeated that the publication of the rules governing the 1922 Richmond Meet are awaited with interest. It is worthy of mention here that, in connection with the Second London Rally organised by this club, which takes place on Whit Monday (probable venue, Hendon Aerodrome) two Yorkshire clubs have already signified their intention of attending and that, in addition to the count taking place as late as possible in the afternoon, it will not be necessary for them, or any other distant club, to ride all night and thus arrive at the rally possibly too fagged to be able to participate in and enjoy ‘the fun of the fair’.”\n\nIXION, THE PROUD PAPA: “My small son—aged three—has already begun to follow in father’s footsteps. When knowledge fails to carry him any further, he speculates boldly. The advertisement columns of The Motor Cycle are his weekly joy, though he sometimes trips technically. The other day one of our advertisers pictured a telephone receiver on his page. Junissimus had never seen a telephone, but like his papa he was not going to be beaten by a little thing like that. ‘You pushes down that!’ he explained, pointing to the mouthpiece; ‘and the oil comes out there,’ pointing to the earpiece. Similarly with a mammoth sketch of a KLG plug. ‘You pull down that,’ indicating the terminal clip, ‘and the bang comes out there!’ pointing to the electrodes. The Editor has engaged him to undertake this column when I fill my tank for the last time.”\n\n[A personal note: In 2010, at the Sunbeam MCC’s first Ixion Cavalcade in Bexhill-on-Sea (where Ixion was parish priest) I was introduced to Junissimus and was privileged to shake the hand of Ixion’s son—Ed].\n\n“QUITE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER of motor cyclists may be regarded as enthusiasts, and of this number a large proportion long to possess a solo mount, well finished in all respects, and capable of high road speeds without apparent exertion. It is for such as these that Mr George Brough has laid himself out to cater, and his wide experience in sporting trials has provided him with a valuable source of knowledge of the special requirements of this type of rider. A comparatively small output in a specialised line enables him to give personal attention to every machine turned out from the works, and the resulting product is therefore likely to be ideal for the sporting soloist or for use with a light sidecar. Price, of course, must be a secondary consideration, but the Brough Superior compares favourably with machines of its class. The latest Brough Superior model in- corporates the new 8hp side-by-side valve JAP engine with roller bearing crankshaft. This engine is a remarkably ‘clean’ design, and at the outset we may state that, though the machine which we tested had a big mileage behind it, the engine was extremely quiet and was the most effortless and vibrationless V-twin that it has been our good fortune to handle. As regards flexibility and power, it is possible, on the sidecar gear of 4.28 to 1, to crawl through busy streets or to accelerate on open roads to speeds often talked of but seldom accomplished. This without touching the gear lever, and with only reasonable clutch manipulation in traffic. This is due to the wide weight-power ratio and the flexibility and power of the new side-valve JAP engine. Pulling sweetly and evenly at all speeds, the engine gives one an extraordinary feeling of confidence, which is increased by the excellent balance of the machine, and though the writer had not handled a Brough Superior for over a year, he was immediately at home on the big machine. Even after a stop of some two hours in wintry weather the engine was quite free and started easily, ticking over without fuss or rattle. A 30 mile run at speeds best left to the imagination seemed to improve the general qualities of the engine rather than otherwise, and on every occasion on which it was employed the machine behaved so admirably that our parting was regretful. It is a difficult matter to find a hill with a gradient sufficient to test the powers of such a mount, and we had to content ourselves with intentionally placing the machine at a disadvantage with a view to discovering its true virtues. As an instance of this, the Brough Superior was driven up a slope of 1 in 9 dead slow on top gear, yet while still on the gradient a touch of the throttle caused the machine to accelerate rapidly and without a symptom of hesitation. Again on a trip through devious and twisting byways we intentionally took acute corners on greasy roads without changing gear. In every case a little clutch slip was sufficient to ensure a safe turn and rapid acceleration. If, however, under such circumstances, one drops into middle gear, as all good riders should do, the ‘get away’ is terrific, yet perfectly smooth. Any tendency to harshness in the all-chain transmission is effectively damped out by the cush rear hub; and a recent modification of the front chain guard provides for the protection of both top and bottom chain runs, though the centre part is left open to facilitate adjustments or\n\nrepairs. Clutch and gear box are of the usual Sturmey-Archer type, and well up to the power of the big engine. One cannot help admiring the neat way in which so large an engine is housed in so small a frame without a suspicion of overcrowding, and on riding the big ‘eight’ one has a sensation of bestriding a handy lightweight with the power and road-holding qualities of a big machine. The 3in tyres attend to the rider’s comfort, and are materially assisted in this respect by the Montgomery leaf spring fork and a large and comfortable saddle, while the steering angle and trail are the result of considerable experimental work. Certainly these experiments have been worth while, for we can testify that the Brough Superior handles well in grease and over loose stones, a test which has proved too much for many an otherwise excellent machine. It is not only in points of major importance that the Brough Superior excels, for every detail is carried out with care, and the finish is superb. Only two small criticisms occur: (1), that the finish is a trifle showy for the every-day rider (yet the plated tank cleans up easily and satisfactorily on account of its smooth and rounded shape, and have we not already suggested that most motor cyclists are enthusiasts?); (2), that on the actual machine we tested the steering lock was rather limited. We hear, however, that this point has already received the attention of the designer, and that no future machines will suffer from this slight defect. Mudguarding is good, the brakes are sensible—especially the parallel action rear—the toolbag behind the saddle tube is ample in capacity, and is in the correct position, and the handle-bar operated oil pump is neat arid very convenient. The fates have decreed that our road tests of this particular make shall be accompanied by snow, and the last occasion was no exception to the rule. This provided us with ample Opportunities for testing the machine under all conditions of slush and slime, which it survived with credit, but the inclement weather somewhat curtailed our experiences with the smaller MAG-engined model. In spite of this we were able to verify the fact that the 6.5hp MAG (72x90mm=748cc) is a very sweet-running engine of no mean performance, and it is sufficient to remark that the rest of the machine is almost identical with its larger brother. Its weight, however, is 251b less. In conclusion, there is just one word of warning which should be issued with every Brough Superior. The comparative novice should insist on an accurate speedometer, for in spite of the fact that the machine will run slowly and steadily, so smooth is the engine and transmission that one is more than likely to find that one’s actual road speed is nearly double the intended figure.”\n\n“PNEUMATIC TYRES MADE MOTOR CYCLING POSSIBLE. Unfortunately, they also made punctures possible. and, although the larger and better tyres of to-day are not so susceptible to these annoying occurrences as were the diminutive covers of yesterday, the bogey is always with us. But perhaps it will not be ever thus; for several very promising ‘unpuncturable’ tyres (or tubes) are making an appearance. We illustrate two new inventions. The Jeff patent tube has passed the experimental stage, and is now available to the public…It is quite different from anything of the kind attempted before, and consists of what externally looks like an ordinary air chamber, but inside is a series of rubber flaps overlapping one another, with the result that any foreign object which penetrates the outer cover and tube merely pushes the flaps to one side, and when this object is withdrawn the hole is immediately sealed by the flap beneath it being forced upwards by the pressure of air. Mr HFS Morgan, the well-known exponent of the three-wheeler which bears his name, has recently put this tube to a very severe trial, when, after driving seven nails through the cover, he found the tyre quite hard. He then penetrated the cover with several ordinary nails, a bradawl, a strong needle, a sharp scriber, and one or two blunt file ends, and the tube still retained air. On quite another principle the Compression puncture-proof tube is of considerably greater thickness than one of standard pattern and the circumference of the outer cover which it fits. In its deflated form it is moulded with deep corrugations on the sides, but when inflated the corrugations straighten out, thus conforming to the internal contour of the cover. When inflated, instead of stretching the tube, the air pressure compresses the rubber, so that, if punctured, the holes made by nails or other puncturing agents are closed automatically. It is claimed that it is more resilient than the ordinary tube, and requires 25% less air pressure…the concessionaires, state that if the tubes are fitted to their Tulsa cord tyres they will be guaranteed against punctures and all defects of manufacture for 10,000 miles.”\n\n“THANKS TO A CHANGE OF COVER,” Ixion reported, “I had a Challenger tube lying around my office last night and proceeded to demonstrate it to two incredulous visitors. The mere fact that I was prepared to inflict umpteen punctures on my own property no doubt carried a certain amount of conviction. I thought I had destroyed this by my first test, for I had such confidence in the tube that the weapon selected was the marlin-spike on a camping-knife possibly half an inch in diameter. I thrust this well through the tread till its tip distended the inner periphery of the tube and then withdrew it. A nasty hiss followed; but, even as my guests opened their mouths to crow at me, the hiss ceased, for with a vicious ‘plop!’ a gobbet of black mastic surged up from inside the tread and sealed the hole, no material pressure having been lost. When more modest weapons, approximating to wire nails, were used, there was no hiss at all.”\n\nTHE 684-MILE PARIS NICE TRIAL attracted 45 bikes, ranging from 250-1,000cc. Any rider who failed to average 25mph was eliminated which made life hard for the lightweights; despite a couple of 60min extensions only three tiddlers were among the 25 finishers. There were few British riders but the first three 500cc class were two ABCs and a Sunbeam; the first three in the 750cc class were an ABC, a Triumph and a Beeza.\n\n“THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT the popularity of the motor cycle in England, but in America it would be. useless to claim that motor cycles find universal favour. An American journal just received is using great efforts to show the wide use of the motor cycle in England by every class of rider, from the highest in the land to the lowest.”\n\n“WHEN MOTOR CYCLES ARE SPRUNG more or less from end to end the springing may be divided into three classes: (1) That in which the whole frame except the rear wheel attachments, sometimes including the carrier, is sprung; (2) A method of springing applied to the driver and the principal parts of the mechanism, the rear wheel being mounted in a rigid part of the frame extending to the head; (3) A partly duplicated frame providing spring suspension for the saddle and footboards or footrests.”\n\nRECORD BREAKING IN 1922 HAS been opened. Riding a new ohv 3½hp Norton (70x100mm=490cc), RN Judd lowered the international mean speed figures for the kilometre and mile on March 15th.” What would become known as the Model 18 set kilometre and mile records of 89.92mph and 88.39mph respectively. “Judd’s previous speed for the kilometre, attained a year ago, was 86.37mph, while the speed of the last holder of the international one mile record, EB Halford (3½hp ohv Triumph), was 83.91mph. Although the overhead valve Norton has been something of an open secret for quite a while past, this is its. first official appearance in the public eye, and no doubt, ere long, it will be a formidable contestant in the lists for the kilometre and mile British records. At present the ultimate speed in the 500cc class appears to be G Dance’s 93.99mph over the flying kilometre with the 3½hp Sunbeam.”\n\n“TWELVE MONTHS AGO 100MPH ON a motor cycle of any power had yet to be accomplished in this country; last week a 500cc machine, of the popular ‘3½hp’ class, attained the magic figure, the honour of being first going to CG Pullin on an ohv flat-twin Douglas. Several people were known to be in the running for some time past—George Dance on a new ohv Sunbeam, FB Halford on a four-valve Triumph, RN Judd in combination with DR O’Donovan and the ohv Norton, and CG Pullin and his Douglas—but actually the tussle resolved itself into a duel between the Norton and Douglas camps to be settled before the other two made an official reappearance on the track. The game was opened on Tuesday of last week by CG Pullin (TT winner of 1914), who succeeded in sending up Dance’s (Sunbeam) 93.99mph for the flying kilometre nearly 5mph to 98.11mph, and Harford’s 87.89mph to 93.26mph for the mile. Hand timing was employed in this instance. On the very next day, however, incidentally a bitterly cold one, Judd decided that the ohv Norton had already proved fast enough to better these amazing speeds. Accordingly an attempt was made, this time with electrical timing, for it was recognised that an error of a fraction of a second might mean the difference between success and failure. At first ill-luck attended him, and a broken inlet valve spring caused some delay. It was nearly lunch time before the overhead Norton was lovingly pushed half-way up the test-hill—to\n\nensure a certain start—but once going it was only a matter of seconds before it was all over. At his first Tim he lifted the mile and kilometre speeds to 97.35mph and 98.50mph…As we indicated last week, this design is in a very experimental stage; so much so that lugs are cast in the cylinder head for one type of valve rocker gear, while an entirely different type is used…All the Norton people were confident that they had by no means reached their limit, and that even more startling speeds would be reached very shortly. All this time, however, Pullin had been working steadily in an endeavour to extract an extra ounce or two of power from his Douglas, and it is said that not before two o’clock on the following morning did he cease from this labour of love…His industry was rewarded, for a few hours later, on Thursday, there fell to him the signal honour of being the first man to be timed officially on a 500cc machine at 100mph, and also to regain the flying-mile and kilometre records…Pullin’s 100mph was accomplished over the second measured half-mile, his exact time being 17.89sec=100.06mph.”\n\n“YESTERDAY,” IXION REPORTED, I WAS poised in dumb . adoration before an ultra-modern outfit with instrument board, interchangeable wheels, spring frame, hood, screen, and several billion gadgets (note the diminutive, implying the presence of a cigar lighter, variable jet, mechanical oiler, and all the other small fry). My agile brain fled back at a tangent to AD 1902 or so, when I used to transport my particular packet of fair femininity in a forecar, scaling about 180lb all-on. It had a 76x80mm engine with automatic inlet, direct belt drive, accumulator ignition, 2in Clincher tyres, and brakes consisting of a Bowden horseshoe astern, and two bands in front with the circumference of a florin apiece. Yet ‘Me and ma Gal’ actually toured Devon in this outfit. What’s more, my taste in gals ever inclined—like the Kaffirs, I believe—to plumpness. What’s more, we never had any serious trouble with that outfit, though we reeled off 5,000 miles on it. Punctures were our one real foe, with belts in the background. Hills? Well, we dodged the worst ones; and the others we took in three charges: charge 1, ‘Ixion’ and Miranda seated; charge 2, Miranda unloaded for a walk, ‘Ixion’ descending and making a fresh rush; charge 3, ‘Ixion’ and Miranda running alongside, with ‘Ixion’ pushing and Miranda pretending to push. Naturally, there is no real comparison between the 1922 super sidecar at 8cwt and my own tricar at 180lb. Still, I daresay there is still a market for the economy two-passenger motor cycle, and a few specifications like the Harper indicate that some designers have long memories.”\n\n“RACING A MOTOR CYCLE ENGINE whilst on the stand is a detestable habit. It is tolerated in a garage, or under special circumstances on the road, but when an individual persists in stepping and starting his engine 20 times in the course of a quarter of an hour for no apparent reason, one does begin to feel one’s nerves fray. The obvious course was for me to quit the place I had chosen for my lunch, but being such a delectable spot I hated to leave it. A narrow grassy lane led past, the rose-embowered cottage and on to undulating tilth and pasture. The setting of the little house was perfect. Nothing marred the harmonious whole except the tinkering motor cyclist. Fleecy clouds drifted across a blue sky, and a faint smell of burnt wood bark and peeled willow pervaded the air. A moment’s cessation, a moment of heavenly silence, when the bees could be heard buzzing from flower to flower. I filled my pipe, and thanked Providence that the fellow with the machine had by his time ceased to tinker. Ordinary tuning I could have understood, but what tuner would allow his engine to rev appallingly for minutes on end? The spell of silence was short, however, and once again the din started. This time I decided to investigate, and approached the cottage, where I saw a youth of 20 or so in a red blazer and white trousers standing in a curiously intent attitude listening to the beat of the engine. Occasionally he shifted the lever and allowed the engine to tick over. To be just, it must be admitted that the engine appeared to be in perfect tune. He throttled it down until it just tickled over, then opened out to a lively, healthy roar. Somehow the noise did not seem half so bad when the machine was in sight. But why didn’t the fellow try it on the road? I stood in full view expecting him to speak, seeing that I could not be mistaken for anything but a motor cyclist. Such was my conceit that I felt piqued at his indifference, and prepared to move away. An indifferent unsociable sort of a bounder, thought I. But, why should he, at home in his own garden, turn to accost a perfect stranger? But a strange feeling compelled me to remain where I was, and at last he straddled the machine and dragged at the stand. The engine was just ticking over as he paddled it down the miniature drive. I had just moved aside when a matron rushed from the house in apparent alarm. ‘Dick!’ she cried, hurrying after him. ‘What are you doing? You must be mad.’ The boy smiled, and waved a reassuring hand. ‘Don’t alarm yourself, mater,’ he laughed, ‘I’m only going to feel the road, just feel what it is like.’ The lady in grey stood in the pathway, the picture of nervous apprehension, and watched the youth pass through the gateway. The scene is fixed vividly in my mind, although at the time I had no notion of its significance. The grey lady, the little drive lined each side with green velvet and Mrs Simkins pinks, the white-washed cottage in the background, and the indifferent youth. He looked directly at me, but my presence created no more interest than a mere handcart would have done. Straddling the machine he let in the clutch and the machine moved a yard or two on low gear towards the hedge. Directly the wheel touched the grass he stopped the engine, and wheeled the machine back towards the gate. Curiously enough, the lady in grey did not show any surprise, but opened the gate for him to enter and helped him through. It was just after he had pushed the ‘bus back on the drive that a thought occurred to me, and I strode to the gateway. ‘Anything wrong?’ I asked. ‘Perhaps I can give you a hand.’ I was quite close to the lady in grey, but the response came quickly from the youth. He turned, and, with a flushed but smiling face, ‘It’s all right—thanks, thanks.’ And as he moved, away the lady turned to me. ‘He’ll never ride again,’ she said quietly. There was a moment of silence, then she added with a break in her voice: ‘He was blinded in France—no, he will never ride again, the doctor says so.’\n\nFriar John\n\n“IN CONSIDERING THE MOTOR CYCLE as a whole, the engine presents most scope for improvement and individuality. In consequence it has received the most attention, and though transmission, frames, and springing are all capable of considerable improvement, it is right that the motive power should have first consideration…Not by a very long way have we reached the limit of power output per unit of capacity, nor of thermal efficiency, but steady progress is being made, and the popularity of small engines even for long-distance touring is a sign of the efficiency of modern designs generally…A study of the laws governing gas flow has caused port design to be modified to a very considerable degree, enabling a greater weight of charge to be induced in a given time, and avoiding obstruction to the flow of exhaust gases. This in itself tends to raise the actual compression at large throttle openings, and better cooling has also enabled even higher actual compression ratios to be employed. Easy ingress and egress of the charge brought high revolutions into the realm of possibility, but before these high engine speeds could be used to advantage it became necessary to lighten reciprocating parts so as to avoid undue bearing stress due to the rapid acceleration of masses constantly reversing in direction. This reason has brought the aluminium piston into prominence, and though much trouble was experienced with some early designs, the type has come to stay…The correct location for valves is still disputed by many, but there can be no doubt that a well-designed overhead valve engine is capable of higher all-round efficiency than the side valve type, though a badly-designed overhead valve engine is a thing to be avoided at all costs…Two innovations of recent date show great promise, although they are distinctly unconventional as far as motor cycle practice is concerned. The first of these, the Bradshaw oil-cooled engine, is based on well-proved theories which came to light during research work on aero engines, and incidentally have great possibilities for all types, more especially in the case of multi-cylinder layouts, where direct air-cooling is a somewhat difficult matter. The second example of unusual practice, is the adoption of the Burt single sleeve valve by Barr & Stroud, Ltd, and both bench tests and road work with the B and S engine have clearly demonstrated the fact that it is possible to combine very high efficiency with almost entire absence of mechanical noise…There are many others which depart from the more commonly used designs in one way or another. The Triumph four-valve single cylinder is not the least important. The ohv Blackburne and the newer JAP power units have points of extreme interest, while lesser known engines such as the CAM, the B and H, and the British Anzani may create for themselves a place in motor cycle history before the year is out. At the present time Tourist Trophy racers are occupying the attention of many designers, and our knowledge in this direction inspires us to say that engine design is undergoing some remarkable changes. One hundred mph by a 500cc engine has not yet been achieved, but we can prophesy that this is only a matter of time—and perhaps not such a very long time. This is a matter for the ‘tuning wizard’ after the designer has completed his work, for it is certainly true—and we do not think any expert in theory will disagree—that whatever speed can be obtained by means of correct design theoretically, the rider-experts—of whom only a few exist—can improve upon it.”\n\n“SPECIALLY BUILT TO WIN FOR ENGLAND the high-speed records at present held by America, the British Anzani racing engine (83x92mm=996cc) is a unit which promises to give an excellent account of itself as soon as it is ready for the track. There are four valves in each cylinder, and these are actuated by means of a special cam gear held in an oil-tight heavily ribbed aluminium case situated above the cylinder heads, each pair of camshafts being driven by two vertical shafts and bevel gearing…In the racing engine aluminium bronze is the material used for the cylinder head, which is carefully machined internally, and is provided with ports of enormous size…each cylinder has two plugs fired by its own double-spark magneto…This engine, it is claimed, has already developed 46hp at 4,000rpm, but even better results are expected. Of the same dimension, the 8-10hp sports model is built on somewhat similar lines to the special racing engine, but is a commercial proposition. On each head there is a bracket supporting the rocker shafts, which run on ball bearings packed with grease; like the racing engine it has four inclined valves to each cylinder. Adjustment for the tappet clearance is provided…The detachable heads, which are of the same design as those fitted to the racing engine, are in this case of cast iron…Die cast aluminium pistons fitted with a scraper ring and strengthened by internal ribs are employed…We are naturally looking forward to seeing the performances of these engines on the road and track. From the ingenuity displayed in their design and the excellence of the workmanship, they will no doubt give an excellent account of themselves.”\n\n“SIR,—MY OVERALLS, BEING EX-WD STOCK, are distinctly ‘baggy’, and at times touch the plug. Thus, when they are thoroughly soaked with water, a circuit is formed along the overalls, through my hands on to the handle-bars giving an unpleasant shock. Have any of your readers been troubled in the same way?\n\nSivel.”\n\n“WILFRID DUPUY, WHO LAST WEEK won his class in the Coeur-Volant hill climb, is the youngest French motor cyclist to possess a driving licence. He is 12 years of age, and had to compete with 501b ballast. He is the son of a director of the Petit Parisien.”\n\n“A MOTOR CYCLE CLUB HAS BEEN FORMED in Worthing and an open trial from Worthing to John o’ Groats, thence to Land’s End and finally back to Worthing, figures on its fixture card. Whether this event has received a ‘permit’ we are unaware, but apparently the Worthing worthies believe in tempting Providence, for the club flag is to be blue with a white circle, ‘inscribed with the figures thirteen in red’.”\n\n“IN LOOKING BACK OVER THE YEARS one now sees that in 1913, say, it would have been a very safe prediction to have anticipated a great future for the sound, sturdy, and well-made 3½hp single-cylinder, which was then really coming into its own. That we are on the eve of another similar epoch is felt by most of those who are in close sympathy with the motor cycle movement. To-day, however, the decade on which we are opening will assuredly be the decade of the 2¾hp single. Typical ‘3½’ machines have outgrown themselves and developed into heavy mounts far more suitable for sidecar work than for even merely occasional solo riding. True a sports type of ‘3½’ has developed, but it is the result of the demerits of its overgrown parent, and for the average rider it remains a type that novices still regard as being too weighty, too fast, and too powerful. A machine for the man who invariably rides solo, yet who yearns not habitually for the joy of freak hill conquering nor for the thrill of ultimate speed, need have no greater cylinder capacity than 350cc. Such an engine will give all reasonable speed, may indeed give more speed than many roadster 4hp models, will climb any reasonable hills, and most unreasonable ones, and, finally, will provide occasional trans port for two, either by pillion or by sidecar. Just as the 4hp has become a passenger model used for occasional solo work, so has the 2¾hp single stepped up to take the vacated place as the ideal solo mount which at the same time is quite suitable for occasional passenger work. That the foregoing thoughts were inspired by the use we recently enjoyed of a 2¾hp three-speed Raleigh may be taken as greater commendation of the machine than anything we might say of the actual machine’s performance under this, that, or the other circumstance. Handed over to us almost immediately after the ACU stock machine trial, the machine under review was in the condition in which it finished that event wherein it gained a special certificate of merit as a standard stock machine. Without any chance to become familiar with it, it was driven straight into the densest London traffic, and subsequently used for running in and out to business and a week-end’s pottering, as well as subjected to tests on rough surfaces and hills. In all respects it gave good results such as one would expect from a machine bearing the distinguished name it carries and finished so handsomely as it appears to be. Ridden solo the machine’s performance on ordinary hills was such that no use of the gears was called for on Surrey main roads, but departures into by-tracks occasionally demanded second, and on one occasion even produced knocking on that ratio, which caused a further drop to low; this, however, was due to a combination of mishandling and very low speed. A pillion passenger’s extra weight on one jaunt proved that the machine was not appreciably slowed on hills by the double load, but,\n\nof course, the ability to climb hills slowly on top gear was reduced. Owing largely, no doubt, to its outside flywheel, the c Raleigh engine pulls exceptionally well at low speeds and in moderate traffic; its top gear of 5½ to 1 (roughly measured) is all that is needed in conjunction with the lightly-operated clutch. In very dense traffic middle gear was advisable and a smooth restart, even on gradients, could be made. Low gear was found to be too low for convenient handling of the machine in traffic on level roads, and should never be needed except on single-figure hills. Maximum speed is not abnormal, but it has a useful pace, and at 38-40mph engine vibration is not unpleasantly discernible. Riding position (and steer- ing) is excellent, and both feet may remain firmly on the rests, even when the heel-brake pedal is in use on the near-side. The top gear position of the gear-control lever is rather out of reach, and might be higher with advantage. On the actual machine we tested petrol consumption was rather high, between 90 and 95mpg being obtained; 115 to 120mpg should normally be obtained with this size of engine. Starting from cold was also none too easy, unless liberal injections were made. Both faults, however, could no doubt be eradicated at once by suitable carburetter adjustments. To sum up in a sentence, we consider that the 2¾hp Raleigh, without being superlative in any one direction, combines as many sound and workmanlike qualities as one would wish to find in a mount; withal the value for money is good, for it is sold at a competitive price.”\n\n“FROM TIME TO TIME THERE APPEAR in print indictments against what it pleases certain writers to term the ‘super-knut’. They tell us he bestows lavish care upon his person, bedecking himself in much earnest in helmet, goggles, and generally conspicuous clothing, while in many cases his mount is obviously lacking the most elementary attention. That he may be recognised in any crowd as a motor cyclist, they would have us believe is a crime in itself. They draw for themselves pictures of this indelicately equipped person, generally, be it said, grossly exaggerated, and then we are treated to a long dissertation on ‘making the countryside hideous with dense volumes of smoke and ear-splitting reports—all part of a plan to attract attention’. The necessary connection between wide TT handle-bars and a riding helmet, or even between an open exhaust and blue smoke, is hard to see. That nuisances do exist is not to be denied, and much to be regretted, but I very much doubt if the abandonment of the riding helmet, brightly hued scarf, etc, would produce a wonderful change in the countryside. Take the ordinary family man, who, far from being a road-hog, is content, perhaps, with a comparatively ancient machine, and whose use of the roads is limited to week-ends. After his first two or three ventures in true November weather he decides that the ordinary cap, or soft felt, leaves much to be desired in the way of comfort when riding; that an upturned coat collar is hardly proof against the cold winds he is going to contend with; and again that something to augment the so-called freedom from mud which his machine affords, and at the same time maintain as warm limbs as possible, is very desirable. For this man, if he is to equip himself for his job, as all other sportsmen do, naturally turns to articles specially designed and sold to meet his need, so we find him wearing leather fleece-lined helmet, woollen scarf, and leather knee-boots—and arrayed thus he becomes, automatically a super-knut so called. How would the sight of Tottenham Hotspur playing football in dancing-pumps or a cricket team playing in boxing-gloves appeal to these critics of ours? And yet the motor cyclist, because he is such, is to be precluded from equipping himself in accord with the requirements of his sport. Again I say that the riding helmet does not have such a deleterious effect on the brain of the wearer as to compel him to ride a real hog-bus, famous for noise, smoke, and finding the killjoys.\n\nReneve\n\nEVERY YEAR SINCE 1906 The Blue ‘Un had published a Buyers’ Guide.

Nevertheless, they can hardly be blamed for the extraordinary conditions which prevailed on Saturday last [All Fools’ Day]. Starting from Clent in the early morning, the roads were frozen and dusty, and though an icy wind was blowing there was every prospect of the hills being in dry condition. Before reaching Cheltenham the roads were covered with snow, and only a few miles further on the route was blocked by four-foot drifts, no traffic being possible in places. A detour was made, but for a matter of 35 miles progress was but little more than a fast walk, and near Warmley the roads were again impassable. Conditions improved on nearing Bristol, but so great was the delay that the stewards wisely decided to conclude the trial at Clevedon—originally intended as the lunch stop. After a stewards’ meeting it was\n\nannounced that all solo riders who reached the finish, and all drivers of passenger machines to check in either at Tetbury or Clevedon, would be awarded a special silver medal, to rank as a first-class award, and to be engraved with the words ‘Western Centre Arctic Trial’. This decision was received with cheers by the assembled competitors, and certainly anyone who reached the finish, by whatever means, richly deserves his medal. Never before have we seen anything to equal the snowbound roads in the West of England, and it is many years since such a snowfall has occurred in these parts. Falls were frequent, and it was not uncommon to find an exhausted solo rider lying where he fell, after struggling through the drifts, while drivers of passenger machines took it in turns to lift, push, and man-handle each other’s vehicles through masses of snow at least two feet deep in places…Even in the Scott trial we have never witnessed, nor experienced, so many falls per mile, yet the greater the difficulties the more the riders became obsessed with the idea of reaching Clevedon…Of 127 entrants, 43 solo men reached Clevedon and 39 sidecars, three-wheelers, and cars reached either Tetbury or Clevedon, thus qualifying for medals.”\n\n“THE BROKEN PROMISE. ONE OF the conditions of the ACU consenting to run the TT races in the Isle of Man this year was that an electric crane should be erected on Douglas quay. Now the IOM people say that such a crane cannot be erected; a story we have heard before, but where there’s a will…!”\n\n“A REPORT HAS JUST BEEN RECEIVED to the effect that the TT course is in an appalling condition in parts, the mountain road being badly cut up by the haulage of loads of stones by means of steam wagons. The matter has been brought to the notice of the Highway Board, who are giving it their immediate attention, and we understand a large staff has been engaged to put the roads into a thorough state of repair.”\n\n“IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT the average young motor cyclist has a commercial mind, but the exception proves the rule, and the following small advertisement makes interesting reading: ‘Experienced motor cyclist in London, NW district, offers sporting ladies or gentlemen desiring exhilarating country rides the comfortable pillion seat on his special solo motor cycle; 6d per mile; distance no object; passenger weight limit nine stones.'”\n\n“THE MOTOR CYCLE PENETRATES into the farthest corners of the earth, where its utility is appreciated as much as at home. Fourteen patrol men of the Honolulu police are now to be mounted on motor cycles. The United States of America was the pioneer country of motor cycle police. They were first adopted by the City of Chicago in 1910; there were 25 motor cycle police in 1913, and now 50 new Hendersons have been supplied to the force. This is irrespective of others allotted to various parks in the city.”\n\n“WHAT A FINE FELLOW IS THE MOTOR CYCLIST who keeps his machine in the centre of one of our great industrial cities. How proudly can he hold up his head and look down upon the ordinary citizen tied down to the crowded train, the bumping bus, or the ever-stopping tram! Never was there such a rider. Grease holds no terrors for him. Necessity has made him skilful. No one would ride wet traffic-bethronged roads for choice, but the town-dweller must perforce traverse them on occasions to reach the country and again to reach home. See him thread his way through the densest traffic; spurting ahead through the narrowest opening, stern of face and yet happy, ready to check at a moment’s notice, and wary lest aught meet him from the side street or crossing. He is not to be caught napping. Ever alert, he becomes immune from accident, since caution combined with skill prove to be his sure protection. Doubtless he envies his country friend, who has his own private motor house, where he can tinker o’nights and at week-ends, slip on to the great highway, and cover half of England before he sees a tramline. But he has not the joy of reaching the country after miles of traffic and rough roads. Once the unpleasantness is over the open road is all the more appreciated. We are all better suited to enjoy our pleasures if we do not attain them without a little trouble, and the breath of the sea is all the sweeter to him whose lungs mostly inhale a less pure atmosphere…There are few more interesting studies of the town motor cyclist than to see him issuing in his hundreds along the great arteries radiating from the industrial centres at the week-ends. Young men on their motor cycles or sidecar outfits with their sweethearts or wives, and the older men on their family buses. All with the same happy if tense look, bent on taking their meal on the wind-swept common, on the wooded hill-top, or by the silver sea, or perhaps on visiting some distant relative or friend. No nation has learned the joys of the motor cycle better than Great Britain, and it is curious indeed that other countries have not even commenced to realise its advantages…\n\nCome, fill the tank with petrol, and fill the flask with tea,\n\nPack up the food in the old tin box and leave the town with me.\n\nSoon we’ve left the tramlines, the air blows sweet and free,\n\nAnd we’ll sail o’er the hill to the field by the mill where the stream flows down to the sea.\n\nAnd then in the shade of the ev’ning, back to our home we’ll ride,\n\nTo sleep and dream of the swift-flowing stream and the joys of the country ride.”\n\n“ALTHOUGH THE FIRST OF ITS KIND to be attempted in Australia, the NSW ‘Six Days’ proved to be a great success. Of 38 entries received 24 faced the starter. It was very unfortunate that wet weather was experienced during the trial, as the rain was responsible for the failure of some of the competitors. On the whole, however, the trial proved the reliability of the motor cycle, and it should also create a greater interest in the sport.”\n\n“R BLACKBURN, ACKNOWLEDGED TO be South Africa’s champion heavyweight rider, will very shortly be seen in Natal competitions with a new racing Harley-Davidson, which has just been unpacked. The new machine is of the eight-valve track type, and is certified as having accomplished the speed of 112mph in America.”\n\n“THE EARLIEST RECOGNITION BY PARLIAMENT of the use of mechanically-propelled road vehicles was in 1831, when a Select Committee of the House of Commons was appointed to inquire into the tolls imposed on coaches and other vehicles propelled by steam or gas on common roads.”\n\n“SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE 8HP BSA, the 6hp engine, which has already earned a good reputation, has been relegated to a lighter frame, and in its present form it is particularly well adapted to pull a light or medium weight sidecar. The machine in its standard form is remarkably well equipped with cast aluminium chain cases, comfortable footboards, and a spare detachable rear wheel may be supplied. In addition to all these fittings the actual model placed at our disposal Was fitted with Lucas Magdyno lighting set, a pair of most practical leg shields, and the large sheet aluminium windscreen which attracted so much attention at the last Motor Cycle Show at Olympia. As the screen is the most noticeable fitting, it is as well to deal with it first and to sum up the pros and cons. The writer, who usually chooses a more or less sporting solo mount for his own use, seated himself behind the protecting wings of the big screen with a feeling which almost amounted to prejudice, and a tendency to look round or over the shield had to be consciously restrained for the first few miles. After a short time, however, the folly of such a\n\nprocedure became obvious, for the view of the road obtainable through the adjustable celluloid window is ample for most driving purposes. Just to begin with, the window was kept open for about six inches, but a cold head wind encouraged a trial with the window totally closed. Having once discovered the advantages of full protection, the feeling of security and comfort steadily increased, and after driving through an adverse hailstorm in the dark the conquest was complete. There is no doubt whatever that an adequate shield would be a blessing to hundreds of motor cyclists who ride daily through the winter, and the BSA Co are certainly on the right lines with their somewhat daring introduction. Concerning the head resistance, it would appear that this is but slight, for although the machine was ridden for nearly three hundred miles both with and without the shield, it was in position when the highest speed was actually accomplished.
