        "text": "The Common Council, in June, 1771, resolved to set about the construction of the street (Union Street) from Dolphin Lane to Broadmead. Owing to the costliness of the undertaking, it was determined to reduce the proposed width of the thoroughfare from 40 to 30 feet. The butcher market at the Exchange being overcrowded, it was resolved to erect a market on the eastern side of the new street The undertaking presented considerable difficulties, many thousand\n\n396THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1771.\n\ntons of earth having to be carted to the spot, and a lofty bridge constructed over the Froom. St. James's Market was opened on the 1st May, 1776. The outlay of the Corporation far exceeded the original estimate of about £4,000. In 1776, the Chamber ordered that £2,600, in addition to £6,000 already borrowed, be raised by means of life annuities, “for defraying the expence of making Union Street and the market there”.\n\nThe growing inconvenience to traffic caused by Redcliff Gate at length overcame the conservative instincts of the Corporation. On the 8th June, 1771, the Chamber unanimously ordered that the obstruction should be forthwith taken down. As already stated (p. 175), the gate had been rebuilt so recently as 1731. Redcliff Parade, on a site previously known as Adderclift, belonging to the dean and chapter, but held under lease by Mr. Sydenham Teast, was under construction at this time. In 1776 the capitular lease was renewed on payment of a fine of £650.\n\nA great public improvement was determined upon in the autumn. The impetus came from London, where the corporation had just introduced flagged footways for pedestrians. The Common Council of Bristol resolved, on the 28th September, that a paved way, seven feet wide, should be made before the Exchange, to which it was also determined to remove the four brass pillars that had long stood before the Council House. This resolution must have been come to in view of the action taken in reference to footways by the paving authorities; for a writer in Felix Farley's Journal of October 26th, referring to various local improvements, applauds “the paved foot passages so commend ably begun in several of the streets”. In the following June a letter appeared in the Bristol Journal, in which “the Ladies of Bristol return thanks to the magistrates for encouraging the accommodation of their feet with smooth paved streets”; but complain that “four wheeled carriages called trucks” were allowed to be driven along the footways.\n\nThe removal of the brass pillars, just recorded, put an end to a singular annual ceremony, described by a London observer as follows:- “On the 5th November the eldest scholar of the city grammar school, standing on a brass pillar in the street, at the Tolzey, commemorates the deliverance in a Latin oration to the mayor, who attends to him at the Council-house door; and when the declaimer dismounts, rewards him with a piece or pieces of gold, as Mr. Mayor thinks proper; but the throng is always so great that very\n\n1771-72.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.397\n\nlittle is heard”. The oration was afterwards delivered in the Council House, but was discontinued in 1780, and was only at intervals revived.\n\nOn the 7th November, John Shoals was tried at the Admiralty Court, London, for the murder of one M'Coy on board the Bristol ship Black Prince, in January, 1769. Shortly after the ship left Bristol on a slaving voyage, the sailors resolved to seize the vessel and become pirates. The captain and nine officers were accordingly forced into a boat, which soon after sank. M'Coy, who acted as cook, having incurred the displeasure of the crew, was tried by a mock court-martial, of which Shoals was a member, and, having been sentenced to be hanged, was suspended to the yard arm; but the rope broke, and the poor fellow fell into the sea and perished. The prisoner was acquitted of the murder, but was sentenced to death for piracy, and subsequently executed. The Black Prince was eventually stranded on the coast of Hispaniola.\n\nOn the 2nd January, 1772, the famous John Wilkes, having been invited by Sir William Codrington, Bart., Mr. Samuel Peach, Mr. Henry Cruger, and other influential citizens to pay a visit to Bristol, arrived at the White Lion inn, Broad Street, amidst the cheers of a vast crowd of admirers. The bells of St. Stephen's and St. Maryleport were rung in his honour; but many of the clergy, according to the Bristol Journal, prevented the ringing of a peal. Wilkes was entertained to dinner in Tailors' Hall, where about eighty gentlemen sat down, and 24 toasts were afterwards drunk, that of “the legal representative of Middlesex” being received with enthusiasm. Sarah Farley was venturesome enough to publish in her newspaper the speech of the gentleman who welcomed Wilkes's arrival; but his name, as well as the demagogue's after-dinner oration, was carefully suppressed.\n\nHandel's oratorio of “Judas Maccabaeus” was performed on the 25th March in the theatre in King Street, to which the admission was five shillings. Master Linley, then a musical prodigy, was “first violin” in the orchestra.\n\nAn advertisement dated April 8th, 1772, appeared in the Bristol Journal, announcing that “Robert and Thomas Southey, linen drapers, mercers, and lace-men, have this day opened shop, next door to the Plume of Feathers, in Wine Street”. Tne premises were distinguished by “the sign of the Hare”. The senior partner, in the following September, married a Miss Hill, of Bedminster, daughter of Edward\n\n398THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1772.\n\nHill, attorney, deceased, and from this union was born, over the Wine Street shop, on the 12th August, 1774, Robert Southey, many years poet laureate, but better known as the biographer of Nelson and the author of “The Doctor”. The draper brothers dissolved partnership about 1778, Thomas migrating to Corn Street; but both became bankrupt in 1791. At the latter date the shop in Wine Street, since divided into two, was let for £44 a year.\n\nOn the 15th May, 1772, a man named Jonathan Britain was hanged at St. Michael's Hill for forging a bill of exchange for the sum of £10. The case excited much public attention. Britain had been an usher in the school kept by Mr. Donn in the City Library in King Street, and had also been a frequent contributor to an anti-ministerial paper called the Whisperer, In July, 1771, whilst at Reading, he attempted to obtain cash for four bills of exchange to the total value of £45; but doubts as to their genuineness having been aroused, he was arrested, and ultimately committed for trial on suspicion of forgery. Apparently in dread of the result, Britain soon afterwards declared that he was one of the persons concerned in setting fire to Portsmouth dockyard a short time previously, and that it was his intention to avail himself of the royal pardon promised in the London Gazette to any one making a full discovery of that crime. He followed up this statement by publishing in the Whisperer virulent attacks on members of the Government, and on the king's favourite, Lord Bute. These articles, which were continued for several months, and insinuated criminal charges against many prominent personages, excited attention all over the country. In the meantime, a Bristol firm acquainted the prosecutors at Reading that Britain had absconded from this city, after obtaining payment of three forged bills, amounting together to £35. This fact came to the knowledge of the Rev. William Talbot, vicar of St. Giles's, Reading, who had taken an inexplicable antipathy to Britain from the outset, and who, as he afterwards avowed, had resolved to rid the world of “an execrable villain”. It was foreseen that the charge of forgery at Reading could not be sustained, the prosecutors having neglected to retain the evidence of the fraud. It appeared also that the injured persons in Bristol had no intention of prosecuting the prisoner. Mr. Talbot therefore determined to prosecute the Bristol cases at his own expense, and made several journeys to the city to engage legal assistance and collect evidence, having stooped, it was alleged, to gross\n\n1772.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.399\n\ndissimulation for the purpose of extracting information from Britain's friends. Two or three journeys were also made to London with the object of strengthening the case. Finally, on the Berkshire grand jury rejecting the Reading indictments, Britain, at Mr. Talbot's instance, was arrested by officers from Bristol, where he was brought up for trial on the 2nd May, 1772, on one of the three indictments laid against him. The prisoner had practically no defence, and his claim to be entitled to pardon under the Gazette notice referred to above was, of course, set aside. After conviction, Britain confessed that he really knew nothing about the Portsmouth fire, and that his articles on the subject were a tissue of falsehoods. The man was undoubtedly a vicious and heartless scoundrel; but the extraordinary manner in which he was dragged to the scaffold by a clergyman gave great offence, and Mr. Talbot's solemn assurances that his time and money had been lavished solely in the service of the public were received with general incredulity.\n\nA letter in the Bristol Journal of the 13th June, addressed to the mayor by “a great number of the citizens liable to serve as jurors”, throws light on the accommodation provided for the due administration of justice. The writers suggested that seats should be placed in the Crown Court at the Guildhall for the use of the jurors, who, being obliged to stand throughout the trial of a prisoner, sometimes lasting for three or four hours, were often so much fatigued as to be unable to perform their functions. The appeal was unnoticed.\n\nA great improvement near St. Stephen's Church was proposed during the summer, namely, the demolition of a number of old hovels which blocked up the approach to the church from the newly-constructed Clare Street. The Corporation subscribed £200 towards the fund raised for clearing the ground. Subsequently the vestry extended the design, and in 1774 an Act of Parliament was obtained to remove old buildings, including the former rectory, to widen the narrow streets in the neighbourhood, and to extend the churchyard. A witness deposed before the House of Commons that, owing to the confined area of the cemetery and the number of burials, the ground had become raised five feet above the natural level. Considerable alterations were also made in the church itself, though they are scarcely referred to by Mr. Barrett, whose indifference to the freaks of contemporary churchwardendom showed his lack of good taste, and caused marked defects in his history. In November, 1776, the vestry resolved on the immediate erection of\n\n400THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1772.\n\na new vestry room at the east end of the church, and this building caused the destruction of the east window of the south aisle. In the following May, it was resolved that “the foundation of the north aisle be built and brought up window high, so as to make it of an equal length with the south aisle”. It is probable that much of the old tracery of the windows was replaced about this time by work of a debased character. The cost of carrying out the improvements far exceeded the estimates, and, as will be seen hereafter, the parochial authorities were saved from insolvency only by the help of the Corporation.\n\nFelix Farley's Journal of June 20th, 1772, acquainted the public that Thomas Boyce had completely fitted up “three large and elegant lodging houses on Clifton Hill”, which appear to have been built by himself at a cost of about £8,000, and received the name of Boyce's Buildings. Attached to the houses were a pleasure garden, three summerhouses, ten coach-houses, and stabling for 34 horses. The projector became bankrupt in the following November.\n\nA coach to Leicester - an unprecedented enterprise - started in June, the owners undertaking to make the journey bi-weekly in two days. By intercepting the London coaches to Liverpool and Lancaster at Coventry, Bristolians were offered greatly increased facilities for reaching that part of the kingdom.\n\nOn the 4th September, Elizabeth Inchbald, who had not then completed her nineteenth year, appeared at the King Street theatre in the part of Cordelia; a play-bill of the evening, preserved in R. Smith's MSS., adds “being her first appearance on any stage”. The performance was for the benefit of her husband, an actor and painter, whom she had married a few weeks before. Mrs. Inchbald afterwards acquired a lasting reputation and a handsome competence by her dramas and novels. In the summer of 1774 the leading female performer on the local stage was Mrs. Canning (née Costello), widow of George Canning, an Irishman claiming descent from the renowned Canynges of Bristol, and mother of a four year old boy of the same name, destined to become Prime Minister. Mrs. Canning, who was much admired for her beauty, married an actor of repute, named Reddish, then manager of Bristol theatre, and frequently acted during three seasons. Reddish dying, his widow married one Hunn, who, according to Mr. Smith, was a liquor dealer in Tucker Street, but by another account was a draper at Plymouth, whom she also outlived.\n\n1772.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.401\n\nThe lady continued on the stage till 1801, when her son, who had been adopted by a banker uncle (father of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe), and had then been Under-Secretary of State for four years, arranged to have his pension of £500 a-year settled on his mother and sisters.\n\n“Mr. Astley, performer of horsemanship, from London”, a man destined to attain fame as a circus proprietor, but who at this period picked up a precarious living as a showman at Bristol and other fairs, gave several equestrian entertainments on Durdham Down during the month of October, depending for his reward upon the liberality of the spectators. The chief attractions were the performances of his son, five years old, and of his wife, upon two bare-backed horses. The first local equestrian performance indoors seems to have taken place in June, 1786, when a troupe of Astley's company occupied the “new riding school in the Borough Walls, leading from Thomas Street to Temple Street”.\n\nThe bakers of the city were greatly irritated about this time by the proceedings of an interloper in the trade, named Jenkins, who persisted in selling bread at a lower price than that agreed upon by the Bakers' Company, and thereby gained great popular support. The publication of violent attacks on his character having proved ineffectual, the Company, in October, resolved to prosecute him under the law of Elizabeth, forbidding any one from pursuing a trade to which he had not served seven years' apprenticeship; but the grand jury ignored the indictment, and Jenkins triumphantly opened a shop in Wine Street, started a mill at St. Anne's to defeat a combination of millers, and sold more bread than ever. His family, who succeeded him, eventually acquired a fortune. This appears to have been the last attempt to enforce the old Act by which trade monopolies had been so long defended.\n\nThe local theatrical season had been hitherto limited to the summer months, during which the Hot Well was attended by fashionable and pleasure-seeking visitors. In November, 1772, an attempt was made by a band of comedians to supply a series of winter entertainments, and the Coopers' Hall was engaged for that purpose. The Act of 1737, branding players as rogues and vagabonds, being still in force, the company were reduced to the usual expedient for evading the law. The Bristol Journal of November 21st cautiously announced:- “We hear that the first theatrical concert at the Coopers' Hall will be on Wednesday\n\n402THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[l772.\n\nnext”. No opposition having been offered, the following week's Journal says:- “We hear the next theatrical concert (between the parts of which will be introduced, gratis, Othello and the Lying Valet) will be on Monday next” Growing bolder, the next number announced that three “concerts” a week would be given, and similar advertisements were continued in later issues. The proceedings were doubtless very aggravating to the proprietors of the neighbouring theatre, but their hands were tied by the fact that the performances in their own house were as illegal as those at the hall. A correspondent of the Journal joyfully announced in January that the magistrates had at length put the law in operation against the intruders, and a few days afterwards four of the principal performers were fined £50 each; but the “concerts” nevertheless continued until the 3rd April. In the following winter, to the wrath of the theatre owners, the interlopers reappeared, the “concerts” being resumed on the 17th November, 1773. Three weeks later, however, the Council resolved to crush them, and on the 18th December the managers, Messrs. Booth and Kennedy (both either in hiding or in prison), announced their benefits, hoping that “their present situation”, which prevented them from personally waiting on their friends, would not deprive them of public support. A promise was added that the hall would be reopened after Christmas; but the luckless players were unable to fulfil the pledge.\n\nIn addition to the annual gift of wine to the two members for the city, the Council, in December, 1772, made a similar present to Mr. James Laroche, one of the Common Council, and M.P. for Bodmyn, “for his services in Parliament”. The gift was repeated in the five following years, the recipient having in the meantime been created a baronet for his zealous support of the King's American policy; and, though the present was withheld in 1778, it was resumed in 1779. Owing to commercial misfortunes, Sir James then retired from Parliament.\n\nAt a meeting of the Council in December, a pension of £30 a year was granted to William Stevens, an insolvent linen draper. The only claim for sympathy put forward on his behalf was that he had married a daughter of “John Bartlett, Esq., late a member of this House”. “When Stevens died, in 1780, his widow was granted a pension of the same amount. In 1790 a pension of £20 was proposed to be conferred on the widow of Bartlett's son. The motion was negatived; but the daughter of the widow forthwith\n\n1772.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.403\n\npetitioned again, alleging that her mother had not sufficiently described her distressed state, and the House thereupon granted £30 a year to the daughter, for life!\n\nOn the 15th December, 1772, at a meeting of a few leading citizens, it was resolved to form an association under the title of the Bristol Library Society, having for its purpose the promotion of literature in the city. The original promoters of the movement were John Peach, John Ford, Joseph Harford, Samuel Farr, M.D., John Pryor Estlin, Richard Champion, Mark Harford, William BuUer, Abraham Ludlow, M.D., and Joseph Smith. Bishop Newton accepted the office of president. The subscription was fixed at a guinea, with an entrance fee of the same amount. (The latter was afterwards largely increased.) The society from the outset coveted the acquisition of the ”Library House“ erected by the Corporation in 1740 for the free use of the citizens, and private negotiations to attain that end soon took place, for in January, 1773, at the annual election of civic officials, Mr. Donn, the schoolmaster, who had been librarian for some years, was not reappointed. At the Council meeting in the following March, the Rev. Thomas Johnes petitioned for the vacant office of library keeper, and a memorial was presented from the society ”for increasing the library and rendering the same more useful to the publick“, begging for the free use of the building, and for Mr. Johnes' appointment. Both requests were granted (Mr. Johnes's salary was soon after raised to 12 guineas with rent-free apartments), and Mr. Donn was directed to quit the premises at Midsummer. The sum of £162 was next paid by the Chamber for renovating the premises and repairing the books. These preparations completed, the library was opened on the 1st July, 1773, the books belonging to the city, though kept apart from those of the society, being, of course, available to the members. Although the house was built for a free library, no reservation of the citizens' rights was made by the civic body, and the entrance of a non-subscriber into the building was soon treated by Mr. Johnes as an impertinent intrusion. In 1775 the Common Council rendered a further service to the new institution. In 1728 the Corporation had permitted Ezekial Longman, ancestor of the great London publishers, to erect a stable and coach-house in King Street, in front of the library, on his paying a rent of 20s. These constructions, with others added by the tenant, being found inconvenient, the Chamber purchased the whole for £392, and had them demolished\n\n404THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1773.\n\n”to lay open the library house and widen the public way“, the Merchant Venturers contributing £100 towards the improvement. The Society was well supported, and being helped by various donations (the Society of Arts subscribed 10 guineas annually for upwards of half a century), its literary treasures rapidly increased. In 1786 it applied to the Common Council for a piece of void ground adjoining the library, upon which to build an additional wing. The land was granted at a rent of 2s. 5d., and a subscription of £100 was voted towards the intended building. The addition was completed in 1789. The restoration of the Library House to its original purpose was not effected until half a century later. See ”Annals of the Nineteenth Century“, p.333.\n\nIf travelling was slow during the eighteenth century, it was at least comparatively cheap. An advertisement in the Bristol Journal of the 13th February, 1773, intimates that a post chaise and pair of horses to Bath or Sodbury could be hired for 9s., or to Wells, 15s. These charges were about fifty per cent. higher than had been usual a few years earlier. In 1760 the price to Wells was half a guinea, and the average rate on level roads was then sixpence a mile in summer. The ordinary rate of travelling by post chaises was thirty miles per day.\n\nAt a meeting of the Council on the 27th March, 1773, a petition was read from owners of property on Kingsdown and St. MichaePs Hill, representing that they had within a few years built many new houses there, but were discouraged from making further improvements owing to the great damage done to their property by the populace during the execution of criminals, and praying that the gallows be removed to Brandon Hill. On the margin of the minute book is written:- ”Nothing done herein“.\n\nA strike of tailors took place in April. The workmen, alleging that their weekly earnings averaged only 8s., demanded that the rate for the summer months, 12s., should be raised to 14s. The dispute was maintained for four months, and seems to have ended in the success of the men, for in 1777 there was another strike, caused by the employers reducing the rate from 14s. to 12s. In 1781, and again in 1790, the masters advertised for journeymen, offering 14s., their hands having demanded 15s. On both the latter occasions the workmen were defeated.\n\nThe weakness of rich Bristolians in reference to turtle was a theme for much sarcasm down to the first quarter of\n\n1773.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.405\n\nthe present century. Mr. Nugent has been shown describing the civic dignitaries as ”full of turtle“, and from his time to that of Byron, who said much the same thing, many jokes were cracked at the expense of the citizens. Of late years, thanks to Mr. Punch, the stream of banter has been diverted upon the Corporation of London, and the witticisms upon Bristol turtle eaters have been almost forgotten. The trade appears to have attained its highest point at the period now under review. The Bristol Journal of July 17th, 1773, announces:- ”Just imported, several large and small turtle from 2 to 120 lb., and from 1s. to 2s. per lb. To be sold at the Old Turtle Warehouse, next door to All Saints' Conduit, Corn Street“ - a convenient locality for the dignitaries at the opposite Council House. At this time a famous victualler, John ”Weeks, had just become tenant of the Bush tavern, fronting the Exchange, where he dressed turtle with such remarkable success that his soup became celebrated throughout the country, large quantities being prepared for distant consumption. In July, 1776, he advertised “turtle ordinaries every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday during the turtle season”, at 5s. a head. Weeks's renown as a caterer extended over thirty years, and he is said to have enjoyed the patronage of the Prince of Wales (George IV.). In 1781 the Corporation accounts contain the following item:- “Paid for a small turtle sent to the Recorder (Dunning) as a present, £6 16s. 4d”. In 1796 the proprietors of the Bush, White Lion, Talbot, and Montague hotels announced that fresh turtle was dressed by them every day during the season.\n\nAt a meeting of the Council in December, 1773, the master of Queen Elizabeth's Hospital and the mistress of the Red Maids' School were voted an extra sum of £42 each (£1 per scholar) on account of the high price of provisions. The children in the two charities were “farmed” by their teachers, the master of the Hospital being allowed at this time £10 per boy for clothing, food, and instruction, whilst the mistress of the girls received £7 per head, together with the profits derived from the needlework at which the children were almost constantly employed - their school lessons being confined to reading.\n\nThe Council, at the same meeting, ordered that a hogs-head of wine should be forwarded to the recorder, as an acknowledgment “for his advice”. The fee of the recorders from the time of Sir Michael Foster had been £60 for each gaol delivery. It was now probably thought that this\n\n406THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1774\n\nhonorarium was insufficient. At all events, the gift of wine was renewed annually, and continued until the reform of the Corporation.\n\nIn the session of 1774 a Bill was promoted by the Bristol turnpike trustees for a renewal of their powers, then about to expire, and for the inclusion in the trust of Gallows Acre Lane, of the road from the top of Park Street to the bottom of Clifton Hill, of the lane from Stoke's Croft to the Blackbirds Inn Gate, Stapleton Boad, and of the road from Gallows Acre Lane to Whiteladies' Road. The two last-named proposals excited much local agitation, and petitions against them were adopted by the poor law guardians and by a public meeting of the citizens, on the ground that the large traffic between the Hot Well and Bath, as well as that between Wales and the South of England, then passing through Bristol, would be diverted, to the great loss of the inhabitants. The opposition was successful in forcing the trustees to modify their scheme. Power to make a turnpike road from the top of Stokers Croft to Stapleton Road was, however, obtained a few years later, and Ashley Road was opened in 1786.\n\nOn the 22nd February, 1774, the philanthropic John Howard paid his first visit to Bristol in the course of his remarkable exertions for the promotion of prison reform. It is difficult for later generations to render full justice to Howard's dauntless labours, inasmuch as the horrors he had to encounter have long passed away. That he ran no trifling risk is attested by the facts relating to Somerset prison recorded at page 172, and by the circumstance that a lord mayor, an alderman, two judges, and the greater part of a London jury perished from gaol fever caught in court in 1760. These and many other warnings had produced no effect on the authorities when Howard began his mission. The Castle prison at Gloucester, which he had visited before reaching Bristol, was found in a wretched condition. The floor of the main ward was so ruinous that it could not be washed; the male and female felons were herded together in a single day-room; a large dunghill lay against the steps leading to the dormitories; and the gaoler, having no salary, made his living out of the profits of the liquor sold to the prisoners, and by taxing the debtors brought under his charge. “Many prisoners”, Howard noted, “died there in the course of the year”. Newgate prison, in Bristol, was overcrowded with inmates, but was in a better sanitary state than that of Gloucester, though the “dungeon”, or\n\n1774.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.407\n\nnight room for male felons, often densely crowded, was eighteen steps underground, and only 17 feet in diameter. “No bedding, nor straw”. In the yard the criminals of all ages and both sexes mingled with the insolvent debtors, even the poorest of the latter class paying the gaoler, who had no salary, 10½d. a week for the lodgings in which they were incarcerated by their creditors. There were 38 felons and 68 debtors in Newgate at the time of Howard's inspection. Bridewell was in a worse state than the gaol, the rooms being very dirty, and the air offensive from open sewers. There was no bedding, no employment, insufficient water, and the only food was two pennyworth of bread per head daily. At Lawford's Gate Bridewell there was “a dark room, the dungeon, about 12 feet by 7, in which the felons slept, except those who could afford to pay for beds. The rooms were without chimneys, and yet the inmates were never allowed to leave them. A prisoner had no allowance for food, except he was very poor, when he had twopence a day”. Howard paid repeated visits to Bristol, where he generally stayed for some time at the Hot Well. He noted in December, 1776, that he had released a woman from Bridewell, who had been acquitted at the quarter sessions, but was detained for nonpayment of fees, 3s. 6d. Some improvements were effected in Newgate after the publication of Howard's reports; but he describes it in 1787 as “white without and foul within; the dungeon and several rooms very dirty. The allowance still to felons only a penny loaf before trial, and a twopenny loaf (1½lb.) after conviction”. At his last inspection, May, 1788, the gaol was found “much cleaner”, and Bridewell “perfectly clean”. The improvement, however, was of brief duration (See “Annals of the Nineteenth Century”, p.66).\n\nA musical festival took place in the Cathedral on the 31st March, 1774, for the benefit of the Infirmary. During the morning service, to which the admission was free, the performances consisted of “the grand Dettingen Te Deum, a manuscript Anthem, and the Coronation Anthem, all composed by the late Mr. Handel”. In the evening “The Messiah” was given, “between the parts of which Master Charles Wesley performed a concerto on the organ”. The vocalists and instrumentalists were ninety-one in number. “Tickets, 5s. 3d. each”; and the committee promised that the Cathedral should be “well-aired” for the occasion. The festival realised a profit of £100.\n\nThe progress of the quarrel between the American\n\n408THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1774.\n\ncolonies and the mother country suspended the white slave trade, so long carried on under the name of emigration, to which repeated reference has been made. The latest record of the traffic has been found in the New York Gazette of May 10th, 1774, an advertisement notifying that a number of “servants” had just arrived, and were then for sale on board the Commerce, “amongst whom are a number of weavers, taylors, blacksmiths, masons, joiners, . . . and spinsters from 14 to 36 years of age. Apply to . . . the master, on board”. A letter in the Bristol Journal about a fortnight earlier quotes the price of these imports at New York and Philadelphia at about £16 currency per head. The trade revived after the colonies had gained their independence. In November, 1800, William Cobbett, in his Porcupine, stated that he had personally seen a cargo of emigrants put up for sale at Wilmington, and treated as mere cattle, in 1793; adding that an Irishman offered him a little girl, seven years of age, for six guineas, her servitude to last until she reached twenty-one years. The child, with her sisters, was to be sold to pay for the passage of her sick, and therefore valueless, mother.\n\nAt a meeting of the Council on the 13th August, 1774, an order was made for the demolition of Froom Gate, Christmas Street, “in order to make the way there more commodious”. A committee also reported that the removal of Small Street Gate would greatly improve the locality, and that certain inhabitants had offered to undertake the work, as well as to demolish some projecting tenements adjoining the barrier. On the recommendation of the committee, the Chamber voted £300 towards the estimated outlay of £600. (A further subscription of £60 was made in 1776.) Another street improvement was ordered three weeks later. A committee reported that Blind Steps, between Nicholas and Baldwin Streets, were very narrow, dark, and dangerous, and that it was desirable to make a better thoroughfare, by removing some old hovels and lofts, the property of the Corporation. The report was adopted, and orders were given for carrying out the work.\n\nOn the 29th August the rector and churchwardens of St. Michael's published a circular stating that the fabric of the church had been condemned by Mr. Thomas Patey, architect, as being in a ruinous condition. As it provided accommodation for only 660 persons out of an estimated population of 2,000, it was deemed inadvisable to repair the old structure, and Mr. Patey having reported that a “roomy,\n\n1774.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.409\n\nelegant, and commodious new church” could be erected for £1,800 or £2,000, the authorities solicited subscriptions to carry his suggestion into effect. The parishioners responded liberally to this appeal; the Corporation contributed £300 and the Merchants' Society £160; and, the fund soon amounting to £2,400, the old church, with the exception of the tower, was demolished in the spring of 1776. In the following July the foundation stone was laid of the new edifice, and the building - a striking specimen of the bad taste of the age - was finished at an outlay of £3,100. The church was reopened on the 22nd June, 1777.\n\nThe dissolution of Parliament in the autumn of 1774 brought about the most interesting election that ever took place in Bristol. Lord Clare and Mr. Brickdale offered themselves for re-election; but the Whig party was much discontented with the conduct of the former, who was charged with having become an obsequious supporter of the King's American policy; and Mr. Henry Cruger, by birth an American, and an advocate of conciliatory measures towards the colonies, came forward in opposition to the once popular peer. A meeting of Whigs was held on the 6th October, when Mr. Cruger's action was unanimously approved. Some of the more zealous opponents of American taxation being desirous that both the seats should be claimed, the name of Edmund Burke was brought forward by two influential Quakers, Joseph Harford and Richard Champion, but the proposal was disapproved by Mr. Cruger's friends, and was not pressed to a vote. Burke was then at Bath, awaiting the decision of the party. Upon learning the result, he proceeded to Malton, where he was returned without opposition. The formal nomination of candidates for Bristol took place on the 7th October, when Lord Clare, Mr. Brickdale, and Mr. Cruger presented themselves; and after about a dozen votes had been recorded for each, the proceedings were adjourned. Lord Clare, mortified by the discovery that his popularity was at an end, and that many of his former supporters were working zealously for Cruger, left the city in the evening, after intimating that he should not continue the contest. His retreat revived the hopes of Burke's friends, who held a hurried meeting in the middle of the night, drew up a letter to the great orator pressing him to return, and despatched a messenger with it to Malton. Polling on the 8th was practically suspended owing to the announcement of Lord Clare's determination and to the excitement caused by the prospect of another candidate,\n\n410THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1774.\n\nonly twenty votes being tendered during the day. On the 10th (Monday) Burke was proposed by Richard Champion, in the midst of vehement protests by the friends of Brickdale, and the contest now fairly set in, the poll of the day being:- Cruger, 95; Burke, 71; Brickdale, 46. Mr. Burke reached Bristol from Malton in the afternoon of the 13th, after what was regarded as a break-neck journey of 270 miles in 44½ hours. Upon his arrival he proceeded to the Guildhall, and was cordially received upon offering his services. He subsequently, for several successive days, addressed numerous meetings of the electors, until he lost his voice through hoarseness. Hannah More, hearing of his mishap, sent him a wreath of flowers with the following couplet attached, conveying her mediocre esteem of her fellow citizens:-\n\nGreat Edmund's hoarse, they say; the reason's clear.\n\nCould Attic lungs respire Boetian air?\n\nThe poll remained open 23 days, although the number of voters during the last week did not average much more than a hundred daily. At the close of the contest on the 2nd November, the numbers were:- for Mr. Cruger, 3,566; Mr. Burke, 2,707; Mr. Brickdale, 2,466; Lord Clare, 283. The formal declaration of the result was made on the 3rd; after which, says a local journal, “the members were carried through the principal streets in chairs richly ornamented, amidst an incredible number of people, whose acclamations were beyond everything of the kind that was ever seen or heard in this city”. The bells were, however, silent, by express order of the clergy. A series of private entertainments followed. Burke, writing to his wife on the 8th November, said:- “I begin to breathe, but my visits are not half over. ... The dinners would never end. But we close the poll of engagements next Saturday ”- (the 12th). Peculiar ideas as to freedom of election were then prevalent. Cruger's committee publicly thanked the mayor (C. Hotchkin) “for his great liberality in permitting the publicans in his ward to vote as they thought proper”. The aldermen of six other wards voted for Brickdale; it is significant that no similar compliment was offered to them. Only two aldermen supported Burke and Cruger. Not a single beneficed clergyman in the city supported Burke, and only one did not vote against him. Upwards of 400 freemen were brought from London; one came from Guernsey, two from Ireland, and one is recorded as “John Lloyd, merchant, Charlestown, South Carolina”. In addition to these, an immense number\n\n1774.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.411\n\nof men (nearly 2,100) were placed on the freemen's roll, the fees being paid by the committees of the rival candidates. The right of no small portion of these persons was derived from their having sumilarily married the daughters of freemen for the mere purpose of obtaining a vote, the newly-united couples often separating for ever on leaving the church. (One of the devices for divorce imagined by such couples was to stand on each side of a grave in the churchyard, and to separate after repeating the words “Death us do part”.) The fees of these weddings were of course defrayed by the election agents. As the constituency was also copiously regaled throughout the contest, the gross outlay of the contending parties must have been enormous. Burke, in a letter to his wife's sister, stated that he had been returned at no expense to himself; but six years later, in a letter to Joseph Harford, he referred with “horror” to the burden he had entailed on his friends. Mr. Brickdale petitioned against the return, contending that the nomination of Burke after the poll had been opened was illegal, that great numbers had been allowed to vote whose freedoms had been granted after the issue of the writ, and that his defeat had been due to corruption. The last charge was withdrawn; the committee of the Commons decided that the post- nomination was valid; and as the petitioner's agents admitted that 772 of Brickdale's voters had been admitted freemen during the contest, the sitting members were declared duly elected. After the dismissal of the petition, Burke was requested to return to Bristol to take part in a triumphal procession, but he declined to neglect his “duty for such a foolish piece of pageantry”. Cruger accepted the invitation, and on the 27th February, 1776, he was met at Keynsham by about a thousand citizens on horseback and fifty private carriages, and escorted amidst cheering crowds to his house in Great George Street, a gay triumphal arch being reared in the newly-opened Clare Street. The story that Mr. Cruger was so incapable of public speaking as to be forced to cry at the declaration of the poll, “I say ditto to Mr. Burke”, is a silly fiction. Cruger, as senior member, was the first to return thanks, and made an appropriate address. He subsequently spoke so ably in the House of Commons on American affairs as to be complimented by his party leaders. Shortly after the election, a satire was published entitled “The Consultation, A Mock Heroick Poem”, written by James Thistlethwaite, who had served an apprenticeship to a stationer in Corn Street, and claimed to be a friend of\n\n412THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1774.\n\nChatterton. The author appears to have been utterly destitute of principle, but he was a not unskilful imitator of the style of Churchill, and excelled that master of invective in the vulgarity of his abuse. There are strong reasons for asserting that Thistlethwaite, after printing the book, in which upwards of a hundred Tory citizens were libelled, endeavoured to wring money out of his victims by offering to suppress it if he were compensated for his trouble. This trick meeting with slender success, the satire was published, and as personalities are always agreeable to certain minds, it had a rapid sale; and the slanderer jubilantly produced a second edition, with additional vituperation. A copy of the original pamphlet, annotated by Mr. Richard Smith, of gossipping fame, is in the Jefferies Collection. Some of the notes are amusing. Thus, in a reference to Sir Abraham Isaac Elton, the town clerk, Mr. Smith alleges that it was said the corporate functionary was all jaw and no law, while one Vernon, a contemporary local barrister, was described as all law and no jaw, and Rowles Scudamore, judge of the sheriff's court, neither law nor jaw. Speaking of Daniel Harson, collector of Customs, Smith says he was “formerly a dissenting minister”; while John Powell, who succeeded Harson, was “formerly a medical man on board a slave ship”. As to Henry Burgum, the pewterer, to whom Thistlethwaite dedicated the satire in vilifying terms, the note-maker states that twenty men whom Burgum brought up to vote for Cruger and Burke were decorated by him with pewter hats. Thistlethwaite, who walked about “with the butt ends of two horse pistols peeping out of his coat pockets”, produced another lampoon in 1775, styled “The Tories in the Dumps”, savagely commenting on the failure of the election petition. The author afterwards removed to London, where he was for some years a hack to booksellers and law stationers.\n\nA more agreeable literary souvenir of the election is to be found in Thompson's Life of Hannah More. During the contest a party of Cruger's friends halted before the house of the Mores in Park Street (next door to Cruger's) and gave “three cheers for Sappho” - whom some of the assisting mob imagined to be a new candidate. Burke was a frequent visitor at the house, and, when his success was assured, the Misses More sent him a cockade, adorned with myrtle, bay and laurel, and enriched with silver tassels, which Burke wore on being “chaired”.\n\nDuring the four weeks that Burke remained in Bristol, he was entertained by Mr. Joseph Smith, a merchant\n\n1774.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.413\n\nresiding at 19, Queen Square, but paid occasional visits to Blaize Castle, then belonging to Mr. Thomas Farr, and to the house at Henbury to which Richard Champion had shortly before removed. Grateful for the kindness of the Smith family, the new member requested Champion to exert his utmost skill in the manufacture of a china tea-service for presentation to his host's wife. Champion was preparing a still more exquisite specimen of his art in the shape of a service destined for Mrs. Burke. The result was the production of works which, for the purity of the material and the splendour of the ornamentation, have never been surpassed. For an adequate description of the services the reader must be referred to Mr. Owen's “Ceramic Art in Bristol”, pp. 95-98. The tea-pot of the Burke service was sold by auction in 1876 for £215 5s., a cup and saucer at the same time bringing £91 - more than thrice the value of their weight in gold. The cream jug was sold for 115 guineas some years previously. The teapot of the Smith set was sold in 1876 for £74 10s., and a cup and saucer have realised £55.\n\nA special meeting of the Council was held in November, for the purpose of passing a vote of thanks to Lord Clare for his lengthy services to the city, and for conferring the freedom upon Mr. Burke. Lord Clare, in responding to the compliment, boasted of his “dutiful attachment” to the king, and of his “inflexible resolution to co-operate in maintaining the sovereign authority of the legislature over the colonies”. His lordship's devotion to the king and his policy was rewarded in 1776 by a further elevation in the peerage, the earldom of Nugent being bestowed upon him.\n\nThe Corporation, in December, voted a grant of £80 “to assist the inhabitants of Queen Square in removing the middle row of trees on each side of the square, and throwing the double walks there into one”. At the same meeting, the Council resolved to give £20 yearly to a chaplain to the Infirmary, and the Rev. Thomas Johnes, the newly-elected city librarian, was nominated to this post also.\n\nIn 1774 the Jamaica legislature passed two Acts to restrict the trade in slaves. But the Bristol and Liverpool merchants petitioned the Government not to sanction the measures, and their appeal was successful. The colonists remonstrated, but the President of the Board of Trade replied that “we cannot allow the colonists to check or discourage in any degree a traffic so beneficial to the nation”. In a History of Jamaica published in 1774, the author estimates that the yearly number of fresh slaves\n\n414THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1775.\n\nrequired to keep up the stock in the British plantations was 6,000, which at the prices of that day involved an outlay of £360,000. The value of negroes had doubled in the previous 16 years. It was the practice, he adds, of speculators to buy slaves, for the purpose of hiring them to poor or thriftless planters, who not only paid from £8 to £12 a year for them, but made good losses by death, the proprietors thus earning a profit of about 16 per cent.\n\nAccording to calculations made in 1775, when the first blood was spilt in the war with the revolted colonies in America, the yearly value of the produce imported into England from the thirteen settlements before the struggle began was upwards of three millions, while that of the home manufactures taken by the colonists sufficed to balance the account. Of this great trade Bristol possessed a very considerable share, and the effects of the quarrel, long before the actual outbreak of hostilities, was painfully felt in many branches of business. From casual notices in the newspapers, it appears that a single firm in the city employed 400 hands in making serges for America, and that the manufacture came wholly to an end. Another house was accustomed to purchase every spring, for export across the Atlantic, 3,000 pieces of stuff made at Wiveliscombe, but the quantity fell in 1774 to 200 pieces, and afterwards to nothing. Until the quarrel arose, the tobacco-pipe makers of Bristol - a numerous body - each sent 600 or 600 boxes of pipes yearly to the colonies, but the exports ceased after 1774. These facts, though not very important in themselves, indicate the depression caused in many industries by the disruption. In January, 1775, before the last fatal measures of the Government had been taken, a meeting of merchants trading with America at all the chief ports was held in London, to remonstrate against the proceedings of the Ministry, and to petition for a repeal of the Acts prohibiting trade with the colonies. Petitions to a similar effect were forwarded by the Merchants' Society and a numerous body of Bristol citizens. The appeals, however, fell upon deaf ears; and within a few weeks 8,000 tons of shipping had to return from America unloaded, the blockade preventing them from landing their cargoes. The Bristol West India merchants joined with their brethren of Liverpool and London in holding another meeting in the metropolis, and a strong remonstrance was again adopted with practical unanimity. It was stated at this gathering that the amount of English capital invested in the West\n\n1775.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.415\n\nIndies was 60 millions sterling; that 20,000 hogsheads of sugar were taken by the American settlements, besides 10,000 hogsheads of refined sugar from England; and that the West Indies were dependent on the revolted States for food and timber. No effect was produced on the Cabinet, or rather on the Crown, which persisted in its attempt to trample down the “rebels” and to realise the merchants' predictions of wide-spread commercial disaster. Mr. Baines, in his History of Liverpool, states that the condition of that town so greatly deteriorated during the war that “not less than 10,000 out of the 40,000 inhabitants became dependent on charity for their daily support”. In Bristol the poor rates increased about 160 per cent., and great distress prevailed. The general depression, however, did not abate the determination of the influential local supporters of the Government to defend its policy. On the 18th September a memorial was addressed to the mayor by Thomas Tyndall, Michael Miller, John Vaughan, Slade Baker, and other leading Tories, asking him to summon the Council to address the King in support of the Ministerial policy. A meeting was accordingly convened for the 21st, but a quorum did not attend. The agitators then asked the mayor for the Guildhall to hold a public meeting, which took place on the 28th, when an address, expressing abhorrence of the rebellion and a wish for its forcible suppression, was adopted. Some opposition was manifested by American merchants and others, but a reporter notes that “numbers prevailed, and they were silenced”. The address, which was signed by nearly all the local clergy and many merchants, was “very graciously” received by the king. An address praying for conciliatory measures was, however, drawn up by John Fisher Weare, Richard Champion, and others, and was numerously signed. A few weeks later Mr. Burke attempted to introduce a Bill into the Lower House to lay the grounds for reconciliation, but was defeated by an immense majority. During the autumn the Americans began to fit out privateers, which were soon preying upon English merchantmen in all parts of the Atlantic, and even on our own coasts. The step provoked measures of retaliation, and the energies of the two nations were vigorously devoted to the destruction of commerce through the remaining years of the war. The foreign trade of Bristol rapidly declined, until it sank to a small fraction of its previous dimensions. In 1776 the number of ships paying mayor's dues was 629; in 1781 it shrank to 191.\n\n416THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1775.\n\n(This, however, was partially due to the refusals to pay the dues about to be recorded.) The African trade was virtually suspended, and the ships laid up. Even the number of privateers was insignificant as compared with the ships sent out in previous wars. In January, 1778, it was stated in the House of Lords that the number of British ships destroyed or taken by the enemy was 559, of a computed value of £1,800,000; that of the vessels thus lost (many of which belonged to Bristol), 247 were engaged in the West India trade; and that all imports from America had risen enormously in price - tobacco from 7½d. to 2s. 6d. per lb., and other articles in proportion.\n\nThe extent of the Bristol postal establishment at this date is accidentally brought to light by a paragraph in the Liverpool Advertiser of February 17th, 1776. A memorial had been sent to the Postmasters General, complaining that there was only one letter-carrier for the delivery of all the letters received in Liverpool. The answer of the authorities was that only one letter-carrier was maintained in any provincial town, and that they did not think themselves justified in incurring for Liverpool the expense of another. An additional Bristol postman was, however, appointed previous to January, 1778.\n\nA melancholy accident occurred on the 17th March to the Rev. Thomas Newnham, one of the minor canons of the Cathedral. The reverend gentleman, who was about 25 years of age, had gone with his sister and two friends to visit a singular cavern near Brentry, known as Pen Park Hole. Endeavouring to ascertain the depth of the cave, Mr. Newnham hung over the opening for the purpose of throwing down a line, when the small branch of an ash tree to which he was clinging suddenly broke, and he was precipitated to the bottom - nearly 200 feet - into a deep pool of water. Although repeated efforts were made to recover the body, it was not rescued until the 25th April.\n\nA number of the inhabitants of St. Augustine's parish having offered to carry out the clauses of the Improvement Act of 1766 in reference to the removal of old houses standing on the Butts, or Quay, from opposite the end of Denmark Street to the end of Trinity Street, and to supplement this work by widening the narrow and dangerous road from St. Augustine's Back to College Green, the Common Council, on the 1st April, acceded to the proposal. The expense was estimated at £2,400, one third of which had been promised by the Merchant Venturers' Society; and\n\n1775.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.417\n\nthe Corporation contributed the same amount. The improvement was completed in 1776.\n\nAt a meeting of the Council in April, 1775, a committee recommended the prosecution of all persons, “particularly members of this House” who had refused to pay the town dues, that is the local tax on goods imported and exported, payable to the Corporation. The report was confirmed, and actions were soon after commenced against Mr. William Miles and Mr. Henry Cruger, two leading merchants, who contended that the dues were illegal, and who both served the office of mayor whilst the matter at issue remained unsettled. In January, 1778, the defendants published an appeal to their fellow merchants in Felix Farley's Journal. “The fee in dispute”, they wrote, “has within 5O years advanced more than treble, and still the body corporate are not satisfied, which growing evil necessarily alarms us, and is of such a nature that, if established, must put a stop in a great degree to the trade of the city”. The writers requested the citizens to attend a meeting in the Guildhall during the following week, “to consider of a proper mode to resist this attack”. No report of the gathering is to be found in the local journals, beyond the fact that Mr. Cruger presided and that Mr. Miles made a vigorous speech against the obnoxious burden. What pecuniary support they obtained from other merchants is unknown; but the civic records show that many firms refused to pay the dues. The Corporation seems to have been lethargic in pursuing the litigation, the actions not being brought to trial for more than twelve years. The matter excited much bitterness of feeling. A writer in Felix Farley's Journal of November 5th, 1785, asked, if Strafford was punished, “what punishment ought to fall on a Whig C____ in exercising a despotism under the pretence of prescription?”\n\nThe miserable condition of the unhappy people incarcerated in Newgate for non-payment of their debts led to the establishment of a local society for the relief of insolvent prisoners, a meeting of which was held on the 11th April The report stated that during the previous year 72 debtors had been released from gaol on payment by the society of £132 10s. - of which sum £32 12s. were demanded by the gaoler for fees. Many people were flung into prison for non-payment of only a few shillings, and, as they were compelled to provide their own food, some would have perished from hunger but for relief obtained from the charitable. The box provided for this purpose at the door\n\n418THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1775.\n\nof the gaol was, in seasons of extremity, carried about the city. On at least one occasion, this was turned to account by heartless knaves, complaint being made in the newspapers that through the hawking of “false boxes” the debtors had been defrauded of many donations. The “true gaol box” afterwards bore the name of the governor as a security against imposition.\n\nThe coaching enterprise of John Weeks, the landlord of the Bush inn, excited much attention at this period. In April, 1775, he advertised that “the original Bristol Diligence, or Flying Post Chaise”, would thenceforth make the journey to London in sixteen hours - a feat which plunged old-fashioned travellers in equal astonishment and terror. The fare was 3d. a mile, and luggage was limited to 101b. a head. The coaches carried only four passengers each. Soon afterwards, Weeks started a fast coach to Birmingham, setting off early in the morning and completing the journey in the evening. The owners of the two-days coach tried to beat their rival off the road by reducing their fares, but Weeks lowered his rates also, and gave his passengers a dinner, with wine, into the bargain. One-day coaches to Exeter and Oxford followed, and the Bush soon attained the first rank amongst local coaching houses.\n\nAmongst the curiosities of English taxation, the duty levied in the last century upon starch is entitled to a place. In July, 1775, the excise officers discovered an illicit starch factory in St. James's Back, and brought the owner before the magistrates, who fined him £500 for breaking the law. The custom of powdering the hair with starch was universal amongst the upper and middle classes at this period, causing a great consumption.\n\nA now very scarce work, in two volumes, styled “The Philosopher in Bristol”, was published in July by George Routh, “printer, in the Maiden Tavern, Baldwin Street”. The book, which is a collection of desultory essays, was from the pen of a singularly prolific writer, William Combe, born in this city in 1741, and supposed to have been the illegitimate son of a wealthy merchant. Educated at Eton and Oxford, with a handsome person and engaging manners. Combe studied with a view to becoming a barrister, but soon floated into fashionable society, and rapidly spent all his means. Falling into complete destitution, he was by turns a common soldier, a waiter at a Swansea inn, a cook at Douai College, and a private in the French army. In 1772 he was again in England, and, probably through the\n\n1775.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.419\n\nreceipt of some legacy, he soon after mingled with the fashionable company at the Hot Well, amazing the public by his profuse mode of living, his couple of chariots, and his grand retinue of servants; from which he was commonly known as Count Combe. “The Philosopher in Bristol”, one of his earliest works, must have been written during this blaze of magnificence. A comedy called “The Flattering Milliner”, of which he was also the author, was played at the Bristol theatre on the 11th September, 1776. Having returned to London almost as poor as ever, he sought to gain a precarious living by literary labour, and produced a number of versified satires and other fugitive essays, which like all his works were published anonymously. In the eventful year 1789, when political discussions became a mania, he started as a party pamphleteer, and is alleged to have had no scruples in serving either camp. He gained, however, the favour of Mr. Pitt, and enjoyed a pension of £200 until the resignation of his patron. Later on he became one of the chief conductors of the Times. But although he was one of the few men of his age who totally abstained from intoxicants, his taste for extravagance was inveterate, and for the last forty years of his life he was compelled to live within the “rules” of King's Bench prison. His chief literary work was the “Tour of Dr. Syntax in Search of the Picturesque”, which originally appeared in Ackermann's Poetical Magazine, and won its author both reputation and profit. Combe also wrote histories of Westminster Abbey, Oxford, and Cambridge, finely illustrated. The list of his works in the “Dictionary of Biography” enumerates eighty-six publications, besides which he is known to have written over two hundred biographical sketches, seventy-three sermons, and an immense quantity of fugitive articles. Mr. Combe, whose private life seems to have been far from creditable in despite of his religious professions, died at Lambeth on the 19th June, 1823, in his 82nd year, leaving no legitimate descendants.\n\nAn enterprising local shopkeeper, dealing in tea, china and glass, announced in a local paper of August 19th, 1776, that a stock of “silk and other umbrellas” was also on sale. An umbrella was then a great novelty. Southey's mother, born in 1762, stated that when she was a child, a person displaying one in Bristol would have been hooted by the populace. (So late as 1778, a footman who had brought one from Paris was followed by jeering crowds in the streets of\n\n420THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1775.\n\nLondon.) £1 14s. was paid in 1785 for an umbrella “for the use of the Council House”.\n\nThe old Assembly Room at St. Augustine's Back, having been taken on lease by Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, and fitted up at her expense as a chapel, was opened for divine service in August. Although the building was not consecrated, the Common Prayer Book was adopted, and the pulpit was supplied for several years by clergymen of the Church of England. The attendance was generally large, and many distinguished families, during their visits to the Hot Well, were accustomed to attend. Subsequently, a chapel at Clifton was thought desirable, and the building known as Hope Chapel, erected at the joint expense of Lady Henrietta Hope and Lady Glenorchy (neither of whom lived to see it completed), was opened on the 31st of August, 1788, “under the patronage of Lady Maxwell”. The patroness seems to have been a lady of “exclusive” ideas, for a local journal of August 7th, 1790, eulogises “the Rev. Mr. Collins, for asserting so nobly the rights of the public” on the previous Sunday, by “ordering admission for the multitude, who are excluded from that place of worship, now devoted to mercenary purposes”.\n\nThe Common Council, in December, granted a pension of £20 a year to the widow of Henry Casamajor, she being a daughter of Anthony Whitehead, a former member of the Chamber. A chaplain for Newgate was appointed at a salary of £35 a year. A subscription of 100 guineas was voted to the local movement for the relief of the troops engaged in America (the amount raised by the anti-American party for this purpose was about £2,000); and to denote more strongly the political views of the majority, the freedom of the city was conferred upon Lord North, the head of the Government responsible for driving the Americans into revolt. A similar compliment was paid to the Earl of Berkeley, lord lieutenant, and to the Duke of Beaufort.\n\nThe first Bristol Directory was published about the end of the year by James Sketchley, printer and auctioneer, 27, Small Street; who, it is said, not merely collected the names of all the upper class and commercial residents, but also numbered their dwellings throughout the city, and placed the figures on their doors for the consideration of one shilling per house. Copies of his book are so rare that it has escaped the attention of local historians. The commercial directory extends over 110 pages, and contains the names of\n\n1775.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.421\n\nabout 4,400 citizens. A list of 167 merchants, filling six pages, is appended to facilitate reference to that class. The list of the Corporation is interesting as showing the localities still in good repute. Alderman Morgan Smith resided at 78, Lewin's Mead, and had as next door neighbour Alderman William Barnes. Alderman Jeremiah Ames lived in Maudlin Street, and Alderman Mugleworth in Orchard Street. Two others dwelt in Prince's Street, two in St. James's Square, one in Park Street, one at Clifton, and two were non-resident. Of the Common Council, one gentleman resided in the Old Market, one in Nicholas Street, one in Back Lane, St. Philip's, two in Maudlin Street, one in Dove Street, six in Queen Square, four in College Green, one at Clifton, and the rest in various localities. Sir Abraham Elton, Bart., town clerk, lived in St. James's Barton. Dr. Tucker, Dean of Gloucester, lived in Trenchard Lane, and other beneficed clergymen in Wilder and Culver Streets. One of the striking features of the directory is the number - nearly a hundred - of “ship captains” recorded as householders. The textile industries common at the beginning of the century had nearly disappeared, but the city was well supplied with gunsmiths and pewterers, a great many tobacco-pipe makers, four buckle makers, as many patten makers, two workers in horn, and scores of peruke makers. Two “limners” and a miniature painter were the only representatives of art, with the exception of a china painter. One tradesman described himself as a harpsichord and spinnet maker, another as organ builder, and a third as organ builder and harpsichord maker. There were two old book shops on St. James's Back. Only one commercial traveller, described as a “rider and bookkeeper”, appears in the list. Some men cumulated trades: one was a gardener and schoolmaster, another a breeches and glue maker; a music-seller kept an alehouse in the Pithay, a ship captain relieved the tedium of life on shore by retailing beer and spirits, and John Cole, victualler and apothecary, invited patronage at the Pestle and Mortar, Prince Eugene Street. The most old-world tradesman in the Directory was Thomas Bennett, hour-glass maker. Wilder Street. About twenty distinctively French names, such as Daltera, Bonbonous, Laroche, and Peloquin, mark the Huguenot element in the population. Sketchley included Clifton in his work, but only 36 houses were numbered “on the hill” (Mr. Goldney's house being “No. 2”), and the number of merchants residing there was no more than four. In some notes descriptive of\n\n422THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1775-76.\n\nBristol the author states that a survey of the city, Clifton, and Bedminster had shown the total number of houses to be 6,570 (exclusive of 348 unoccupied), with a population of 35,440. Similar surveys, he adds, had credited Birmingham with a population of 30,804, and Liverpool with 34,407. It is certain, however, that the population of Bristol was greatly underrated in this return. The next Bristol Directory - printed at Birmingham - was published in 1783, and was followed by local works dated 1785, 1787, and 1792.\n\nAn Act of Parliament was passed in 1776, “to remove the danger of fire amongst the ships in the port of Bristol”, and for other purposes. The preamble recited that owing to the large importations of timber and other inflammable articles, the quays were often encumbered with such goods, and the danger of fire was much dreaded; that the Merchants' Company, to provide a remedy, had purchased certain (Champion's) docks at Clifton, and that it was desirable to enlarge these docks and erect warehouses for storing dangerous materials. The Act empowered the Company to carry out the works, prohibited timber, tar, etc., from being landed at the public quays, and permitted the customary dues to be collected at the docks. It being desirable that the property should be under civic jurisdiction, it was enacted that all that part of Clifton lying to the south of Hotwell Road (between “a little brook anciently called Woodwell Lake, but now a sluice carried under ground near a place where a lime-kiln stood... and a certain ferry called Rownham Passage”), should be separated from the county of Gloucester and become part of the city and county of Bristol; except as regarded local taxes and freeholders' votes at county elections.\n\nIn consequence of the complaints made by the parishioners of St. Nicholas of the inconvenience caused by the open markets on the Back, the Council, in April, 1776, gave orders for the erection (at a cost not exceeding £340) of a market house there, “for the sale of poultry, fruit, and other provisions brought from Wales”.\n\nOn the 29th April, Dr. Johnson, whilst sojourning with the Thrales at Bath, paid a visit to Bristol, accompanied by his faithful companion and biographer, for the purpose of inquiring into the authenticity of the so-called Rowley Manuscripts produced by Chatterton, over which a fierce battle was then raging in the literary world. Johnson had never doubted that the boy poet was the author of the\n\n1776.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.423\n\nworks, and only marvelled how the “young whelp” could have written them. The visitors were met at their inn by the steadfast Bowleian, George Catcott, who predicted to Boswell that he would make a convert of the doctor, but was doomed to disappointment. “We called”, adds the biographer, “on Mr. Barrett, the surgeon, and saw some of the originals, as they were called, but... we were quite satisfied of the imposture”. The enthusiastic Catcott, however, urged Dr. Johnson to visit St. Mary Redcliff, and inspect “with his own eyes the chest in which the manuscripts were found”. In spite of his asthma, the lexicographer good-humouredly toiled up to the old chamber over the north porch; but to the immense mortification of his guide, he remained as sceptical as before. Boswell's account of the Bristol visit is scanty and incomplete. The explanation is that he had a “tiff” with Hannah More whilst preparing his great work, and that he shabbily cancelled his account of the visit which Dr. Johnson paid to the Misses More. The visitors were much dissatisfied with the (unnamed) inn at which they stayed; Johnson jocularly describing it as so bad that Boswell wished himself in Scotland.\n\nThe open-air entertainments given during the summer season at “New Vauxhall”, near the Hot Well, have been already noticed. In 1761 the garden was offered for sale in building sites, and visitors had thenceforth to content themselves with the in-door amusements offered in the evening at the two assembly rooms near Dowry Square. At length, on the 23rd May, 1776, a few enterprising persons opened another Vauxhall on an estate “formerly called the Red Cliff”, and promised, in return for a moderate subscription, to give a grand concert every Monday and Thursday evening during the summer season. “Admission to non-subscribers, one shilling”. Handel's “Acis and Galatea” was performed in the following August, when there was “a transparency on the bowling green”. The place was extensively patronised at the outset, and occasioned the publication of a satirical poem entitled “A Trip to Vauxhall”, professedly written by a Bristolian “lately returned from Madeira” to a friend in that island. The author begins by lamenting the degeneracy of the citizens. Scarcely a trace of the downright honest trading class, he says, remains; Folly has taken possession of all, and the modest shopkeepers that formerly contented themselves with decent bob-wigs now parade about with tails down their backs, like monkeys, while their wives, starched out in silk and\n\n424THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1776.\n\nlace, rattle along in fine coaches. As if a playhouse in the middle of the city did not offer sufficient scope for dissipation, a Vauxhall was opened by the limpid waters of the Avon.\n\nThey have here furnished up an old family seat, And built a saloon, in length seventy-five feet. The gardens were luckily laid out before, So some lamps stuck about there now needed no more. Six days out of seven in business begun Is ended in jollity, feasting, and fun.\n\nOn Sundays, he continues, the vanity-stricken throng to College Green to display their fine dresses. The nights are given up to fine suppers, upon which tradesmen squander all their profits. After this denunciatory exordium, the author proceeds to describe his visit to Vauxhall, where he beholds a breeches maker defending his fair cheeks from the sun with a pink silk umbrella, and another shopkeeper, renowned for his drinking, mirth and song, swaggering\n\nWith a large oaken stick, a slouch'd hat, and black stock, Cropt hair, leather breeches, and jockey-cut frock.\n\nA drunken parson, a gouty alderman dubbed Turtle, and other personages receive similar irreverent treatment; the illuminations are ridiculed; and the voices of the singers are said to have been drowned by the uproar made by “the Bucks” in the neighbouring bowling-green. The satire can have had little effect on the fortunes of Vauxhall. The site, however, was inconvenient, as the garden could be reached from Clifton only by crossing the Avon (Vauxhall ferry still exists), and although the subscription concerts were continued in 1777, the speculation was soon after abandoned as unprofitable.\n\nIn the course of 1776 the rector of Christ Church, whose fixed income was only £25 or £30 a year, besought the vestry of the parish to contribute, out of the revenue derived from church lands, the sum of £100, which, with a similar subscription expected from the Corporation, would entitle him to a benefaction of £400 from Queen Anne's Bounty, and thus secure an increased rectorial income of £30 a year. The application having been refused, the rector was induced to enquire into his right to the meagre stipend granted him as a boon; and as his claim to a larger share of the estate seemed conclusive, and the vestry haughtily rejected his offers of accommodation, he filed a bill in Chancery in October, 1776. The cause was not heard until May, 1780, when judgment was given in the rector's favour. Finally, in June, 1782, to the great irritation of the parochial\n\n1776.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.425\n\nauthorities, whose fund for feasting was much curtailed, the amount to be paid to the incumbent out of the church estate was fixed at £80 a year, the court also awarding him ten years' arrears. The suit cost the vestry £1,400 in law costs.\n\nThe Common Council, in December, granted a lease of upwards of an acre of ground, “part of Brandon Hill”, to one Joseph Farrell, then building a house in Great George Street. The appropriation of this slice of public property excited no remark. In December, 1786, another lease of “part of Brandon Hill” was granted to Lowbridge Bright, then living in Great George Street. It is possible, however, that the two leases dealt with the same plot of ground.\n\nIn the year 1776, a woman, described as extremely young, of prepossessing appearance and graceful manners, but obviously of disordered intellect, entered a house at Flax Bourton, and asked for a little milk. After obtaining refreshment, she wandered about the fields, and finally took shelter under a haystack, where she remained three or four days. Some ladies in the vicinity having become acquainted with her condition, she was supplied with food, but neither solicitations nor threats induced her to sleep in a house, and as her mental derangement increased she was removed to St. Peter's Hospital in Bristol. How long she was detained there is unknown, but she regained her liberty in 1777 or 1778, and immediately returned to the stackyard at Bourton, where, strange to say, she remained nearly four years, receiving food from the neighbouring gentry, but obstinately refusing the protection of a roof, even in winter. Throughout this period, “Louisa”, or “the Maid of the Haystack”, as she was called, declined to give any account of her birthplace, parentage, or past life, though from casual remarks it was inferred that her family was of high distinction. A peculiar accent led observers to suppose that she was a foreigner, but there is no trustworthy evidence that she either spoke or understood any language except English. In 1781, the condition of the poor woman excited the interest of Miss Hannah More, who, with the assistance of friends, had her removed to a private lunatic asylum at Hanham; while the mystery of her antecedents was sought to be cleared up by the publication of “A Tale of Keal Woe” in a London newspaper. Although no pains were spared to elicit information by publishing translations of this story in the chief towns of France and Germany, the results for some years were wholly negative. But in 1785\n\n426THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1776-77.\n\n[Ed: part of the following page is obscured, so the first few lines are incomplete.]\n\n... French but probably\n\n... .ce under the title of\n\n... According to the writer,\n\n... attentions paid her by the\n\n... personages, was believed to be\n\n... Emperor Francis I., had lived in a\n\n... at Bordeaux from 1765 to 1769; she had\n\n... at the instance of the Empress, carried\n\n... and eventually conducted to a coast near\n\n... where £50 was put in her hands, and she was\n\n... to her wretched destiny\". The purpose of the\n\npamphleteer, who did not produce a vestige of evidence in support of his story, was to identify the Bristol “Maid of the Haystack” with the alleged half-sister of the Queen of France. And in spite of the improbabilities surrounding his assumptions (Louisa, for example, could not have been ten years old when she was supposed to have set up a princely establishment at Bordeaux) Miss More and others appear to have firmly believed in the bare assertions of a masked libeller of the house of Austria, whose work was translated into English, and went through three editions. In the meantime the alienation of Louisa degenerated into helpless idiocy, and she was removed to a lunatic house connected with Guy's Hospital, London, where she died in December, 1800. Miss More continued to the last to contribute towards her maintenance, and paid the expenses of her funeral. The mystery surrounding the lunatic was never cleared up. The most probable supposition is that Louisa was of gipsy parentage, and had either escaped or been driven from her tribe.\n\nA villainous scheme for destroying the shipping in the harbour was attempted on the morning of the 16th January, 1777. A vessel named the Savannah La Mar, loading for Jamaica, had been daubed during the night with pitch and other combustibles, and had finally been set on fire; but assistance being speedily at hand, the flames were extinguished before much damage was done. The Fame privateer and the ship Hibernia, lying at about an equal distance above and below the Savannah, had been also visited by the incendiary, but the fire he had lighted in each of them failed to communicate in the woodwork. The attempt was made at low water, when all the ships in port were aground, so that the devastation would have, been immense had not the flames been suppressed at the outset. A few hours later, whilst the excitement caused by the affair was at its height,\n\n1777.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.427\n\nit was discovered that a warehouse occupied by Mr. James Morgan, druggist, Corn Street, had narrowly escaped destruction. The incendiary, after forcing an entrance into the building, had filled a large box with tow moistened with spirits of turpentine, and after placing it against some casks of oil, had applied a light to the materials. Through the dampness of the box, however, the match had failed in its purpose. Three days later (Sunday) a more successful attempt caused a general panic. Shortly before daybreak the warehouses of Messrs. Lewsley and Co., in Bell Lane, stored with Spanish wool, grain, etc., burst into flames, and in spite of vigorous exertions six buildings were destroyed in two or three hours. The premises had been fired by large torches, one of which, surrounded with inflammable material, was found when the firemen entered. Similar torches were picked up during the day in different parts of the city; and the sugar house of Alderman Barnes in Lewin's Mead was twice attempted to be destroyed by them. The inhabitants, now thoroughly alarmed, organised patrols in each parish, a rigorous watch being maintained day and night. “The town”, as Champion wrote to Burke, “had the appearance of a siege, and people in general were frightened out of their senses”. It is lamentable to add that political capital was sought to be made out of the matter by party fanatics. Tories, forgetting that some of the principal merchants were Americans, and that an American was the chief sufferer by the fire, taunted the Whigs with having instigated the outrages; while the latter as foolishly retorted that the whole affair was a factious manoeuvre of the Ministerialists. Walpole alleges, moreover, that the Government was much less alarmed by the fires than ready to turn them into matter of clamour against the “rebels”. A reward of 600 guineas, to which the king added £1,000, and Mr. Burke £50, was offered for the discovery of the incendiary, but for some weeks the mystery remained impenetrable. Suspicion was at length directed to a Scotchman who had lodged at various houses in the Pithay, but had suddenly disappeared; and a description of him having been circulated, he was arrested in Lancashire, where he had just committed a burglary. (The expenses of his apprehension, £128, were paid by the Corporation and the Merchants' Society.) On being taken to London, proofs were obtained (and in fact he ultimately confessed) that he was the man named James Aitken, alias Jack the Painter, who had set fire to the rope-house at Portsmouth dockyard in December, 1776. Being convicted\n\n428THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1777.\n\nof that crime at Hampshire assizes, he was hanged at Portsmouth on a gallows 67 feet high. In his confession Aitken stated that the Bristol fires were devised solely by himself, and that he had made several other attempts, but had been thwarted by the vigilance of the patrols. Although only 25 years of age, he acknowledged having committed many burglaries, robberies, and outrages. (An extraordinary popular delusion in reference to this criminal's head shows that legends can arise from malefactors as well as from saints. At the time of Aitken's execution, a warehouse was being erected in Quay Street by a mason named Rosser, who, having purchased part of the ruins of Keynsham Abbey, stuck a corbel thus obtained into the front of the new building. For some inexplicable reason, many people firmly believed that the ornament in question was the veritable skull of Jack the Painter. The error was not confined to the lower classes. On the illumination of the city on the king's recovery in 1789, Sarah Farley's Journal recorded as a “good thought” that “a light was affixed on the head of John the Painter”, in Quay Street. The warehouse has since been rebuilt, and the fate of the corbel is unknown.)\n\nOn the 18th January, 1777, whilst the city was still panic stricken by the outrages, the Common Council resolved to present a congratulatory address to George III. on the success of his arms in America, expressing a hope that “the seeds of rebellion would speedily be eradicated”. The Chamber was nearly equally divided on the American question. Previous attempts to forward a “loyal” address had been defeated by the inability of its promoters to obtain a quorum. On this occasion, according to a letter of Champion to Burke, two weak-kneed Whigs went over to the Ministerialists, and the address was voted by a House of 22 members, 20 being absent. The majority, which succeeded after a warm debate in carrying a similar address in Merchants' Hall, did not content itself with paper sympathy. The Council offered bounties to sailors volunteering into the Navy, and although the Corporation was embarrassed by a heavy and increasing debt, £592 were thus distributed in less than a year. In August, moreover, the freedom of the city was conferred on the Earls of Suffolk and Sandwich, two Ministers notorious for their rancorous hostility towards the colonists. This compliment was voted just after the Newfoundland trade had been lost to local merchants, and several ships had been captured in the English Channel by American privateers. Burke, in a\n\n1777.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.429\n\nletter to Champion, wrote:- “To choose the very moment of our scandalous situation as a season of compliment to Ministers seems to me the most surprising instance of insanity that ever was shewn out of the college [madhouse] of Moorfields”.\n\nThe Bristol newspapers were much too timid to criticise, or even to record, the amusements of the fashionable company that assembled every summer at the Hot Well, but contented themselves with publishing a list of the aristocratic arrivals. In May, 1777, however, Felix Farley's Journal, prompted by some sarcastic visitor, startled its readers by publishing “Bon Ton Intelligence” from the healing fountain. One paragraph says:- “We are informed from the Hotwells that it is there the prevailing ton for gentlemen to go and drink the waters at the Pump-room with their nightcaps on; and that this innovation of the head-dress somewhat alarms the ladies”. A fortnight later, under the same heading, appeared the following:- “We are informed that no considerable alteration in dress has taken place since the Revolution of the Nightcap, except the seemingly extravagant appendage of an extraordinary watch; as the gentlemen of the true ton wear one in each fob”. (The wearing of two watches by young men of fashion was often noticed by contemporary caricaturists.) Another paragraph refers to some passing folly of the fair sex:- “The season at the Hotwells is now truly brilliant, but no considerable alteration in polite amusements has taken place, except that the ladies and gentlemen have formed a resolution of going to the balls undressed”. This was the last quip of the Journal's “polite” contributor prior to his departure, and unfortunately he never reappeared.\n\nStatistics showing the precise effects of the American war on local commerce are unfortunately unobtainable. That the decline in the shipping trade was very great is, however, beyond question. At a meeting of the Council, on the 16th August, a resolution was passed to the effect that, as the amount of the mayor's dues (40s. per vessel above 60 tons) had considerably fallen off during the previous year, as the expense of discharging the office of chief magistrate was considerable, and as the dignity of the Corporation was concerned in that office being duly supported, it was desirable that the mayor's income should not fall below £1,000. The chamberlain was accordingly ordered to pay Mr. Farr (mayor in 1775-6) such a sum as would raise his receipts from dues and fees to that amount. As the product of the\n\n430THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1777.\n\ndues was expected to fall off still more seriously in the current civic year, a similar order was made in favour of Mr. Pope, and also of future mayors. By another resolution, Messrs. Edward Brice and John Noble were ordered to be paid such sum, not exceeding £1,000, as the mayor and aldermen should consider proper, for having served as sheriffs a second time in 1775-6; and the allowance of each future sheriff was fixed at £420.\n\nA carrier named Somerton surprised the city in October by announcing that his “flying wagons”, carrying passengers and goods to London three times a week, would thenceforth accomplish the journey in forty-eight hours. Large bets were laid that the conditions would not be fulfilled, and there was much astonishment when Somerton carried out his pledge.\n\nOn the 30th October, during a gale, a windmill for grinding snuff on Clifton Down (on the site of the present Observatory) took fire, owing to the rapidity with which it was set in motion by the storm, and the building was gutted. No attempt was made to reconstruct the mill, which had been in existence only a few years.\n\nOwing to the severe distress which prevailed amongst the poor at this time, highway robberies were extremely frequent. One evening during the autumn, the Birmingham coach was stopped within a hundred yards of Stoke's Croft by two footpads armed with blunderbusses, who robbed the passengers of about £5. The carriage of Mr. and Mrs. Trevelyan was attacked in Park Street, probably by the same thieves, and the inmates were stripped of their money and a gold watch. Highwaymen swarmed on all the great roads. A man eventually identified as John Caldwell, who kept the Ship tavern in Milk Street, and a companion robber named Edward Boulter, were so successful in their daring raids as to become for a time the terror of the western counties. Boulter had been previously sentenced to death for robbery, but pardoned on condition of entering the army. He soon deserted from his regiment, and concealed himself in the cellar of Caldwell's house, from whence he and his host, after having stolen two valuable horses near the city, sallied at intervals to prey upon travellers. Several marauding excursions, extending from Cheshire to Dorsetshire, were successful, and the plunder thus acquired was concealed in a deep hole made in Caldwell's cellar. Early in 1778 they were arrested in Birmingham, whilst trying to convert some of their spoil into cash, and were sent to\n\n1777-78.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.431\n\nLondon for identification. Boulter, however, escaped from Clerkenwell prison, and had the audacity to return to Bristol, where he was soon after recaptured. At the summer assizes at Winchester, the two men were convicted of a robbery in Hampshire, for which they were executed at Winchester. Owing to confessions made by them before death, the police authorities in Bristol made a descent upon the Milk Street tavern, still occupied by Caldwell's wife. The hiding place must have been difficult to find, for the “sundry expenses” of the search, paid by the Corporation, amounted to £4. At length the hoard was brought to light, and several persons recovered their stolen watches and jewellery.\n\nThe dean and chapter, in December, 1777, granted leave to the Corporation “to erect a portico at the front door of the Mayor's Chapel”, on payment of an acknowledgment of 2s. 6d. annually. A sham Gothic structure was accordingly erected by order of the Corporation in 1778, at a cost of £92 10s. 6d. The abortion was removed in 1888.\n\nThe respect of the capitular body for pluralism on the part of their servants is exemplified in a minute which follows the foregoing. It being reported that one of the singing men was parish clerk of St. Stephen's, whilst another held the same office in All Saints', the chapter ordered that one shilling weekly should be allowed to each of them, “to get a clerk to officiate for them every Sunday morning”.\n\nOn the 19th January, 1778, a meeting of citizens approving of the Ministerial policy towards America was held in the Guildhall, the mayor (John Durbin) presiding, when a subscription was started “to strengthen the hands of the Government”. Thirty-nine gentlemen subscribed £200 each, and the fund eventually amounted to upwards of £21,000. A meeting of the opposite party had been held a few days previously, Mr. Joseph Harford in the chair, to raise money for the relief of the numerous distressed Americans detained as prisoners of war; but the total sum subscribed amounted to under £363. The mayor's zeal on behalf of the king's coercive policy was promptly recognised, the honour of knighthood being conferred upon him before the end of the month. Burke, writing to Champion in April, asserted that the local subscription in support of the war had “made America abhor the name of Bristol”. The promoters, after all their professions, were by no means so zealous as they wished the country to believe. According to an account\n\n432THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1778.\n\npublished by their committee in May, 1779, only £4,668 of the fund had been expended (in obtaining 1,146 recruits for the army), and £768 were said to remain on hand. The residue of the subscription, £16,500, was not accounted for, and was in fact never paid up.\n\nA cock-fight on the largest scale took place at the Ostrich inn, Durdham Down, in February, 1778, and was attended by great numbers of West country squires, the match having been arranged between the gentry of Somerset and Devon. Fifty-one birds contended on each side, for prizes amounting to about 350 guineas.\n\nAt a meeting of the Council in March, the freedom of the city was ordered to be forwarded to the Earl of Sussex, “he being entitled to the same by having married the daughter of a free burgess”. The Bristol lady thus referred to was Mary, daughter of John Vaughan, goldsmith and banker. Lady Sussex died childless.\n\nThe mode in which ecclesiastical patronage was administered is illustrated by another minute made at the above meeting. The Bishop of Bristol had just conferred the vicarage of Almondsbury and also the rectory of Filton upon the Rev. John Davie, vicar of St. John's, and the recipient petitioned the Corporation to be permitted to retain his city incumbency, to which the Chamber at once consented. Mr. Davie, however, resigned it in the following year, on being presented to Henbury.\n\nEarly in April, Earl Nugent, the rejected representative of Bristol, gave notice in the House of Commons on behalf of the Govornmont of a motion for considering the laws regulating the trade and commerce of Ireland. His views as to the impolicy of existing restrictions were immediately applauded by Mr. Burke. A few days later, Lord Nugent brought forward resolutions dealing with the subject, his chief proposals being that all goods produced in Ireland (woollens excepted) should be allowed to be exported to the colonies, and that colonial products (indigo and tobacco excepted) should be permitted to enter Ireland direct. Under regulations then in force Irish imports and exports had to be first landed in England. Permission to export Irish glass to foreign countries, and to import Irish cotton yarn into England were minor features of the scheme, to which Burke added a proposal that Irish sailcloth and cordage should be permitted to enter England. Although the resolutions were received with approval on both sides of the House, they excited a tempest of indignation amongst\n\n1778.]IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.433\n\nmerchants and traders, and nowhere did the storm blow more fiercely than in Bristol, where the panic was as great as during the outrages of Jack the Painter. Lord Nugent's action in the matter was ascribed to a diabolical spite against the city on account of his rejection in 1774, whilst Burke was charged with a design to promote the interests of his native country by injuring those of England. The Corporation, the Society of Merchants, and the trading classes hastened to forward petitions to Parliament declaring that the proposed concessions to the Irish would have ruinous consequences to local commerce. The Common Council deputed two of its members to organise opposition against the scheme in the lobby of the House of Commons. No feature of the resolutions excited more passionate predictions of injury than did Burke's proposal to admit Irish sailcloth and ropes into England, although, as it was afterwards discovered, the prohibition of these imports had been abolished many years before. Every leading merchant who had supported Burke, with the exception of Richard Champion, seems to have been offended by his conduct, and some electors sent him positive orders to vote against the scheme in its future stages, whatever might be his private opinions. His replies to the Merchants' Company and to some personal friends may be found in his correspondence. In spite of the clamour, he was more energetic in support of the measure than were the Ministers themselves. Indeed Lord North, quailing before the wrath of the Tory boroughs, gradually withdrew all the important provisions, until little was left of the original scheme save the clauses favouring Irish linens. In the spring of 1779, a Bill introduced to allow Ireland to import her own sugars excited renewed irritation in Bristol, whence a deputation was again sent by the Common Council, and Lord North delighted local merchants by procuring the rejection of the measure. In a few months, however, the scene changed. The islands of St. Vincent and Grenada were captured by the French, whose navy held the mastery of the English Channel; American privateers threatened Hull and Edinburgh; whilst the Irish, invited to prepare for defence against invasion, had raised an army of volunteers, and threatened to follow the example of the Americans unless their grievances were redressed. Covered with humiliation. Lord North, on the 13th December, offered to concede to Ireland full liberty to trade with all the colonies, to remove the restrictions on her glass trade, and, hardest sacrifice of all, to permit the export\n\n434THE ANNALS OF BRISTOL[1778.\n\nof her woollen manufactures. A Bill giving effect to this capitulation passed rapidly through Parliament, the opposition of Bristol and other ports becoming lukewarm when the measure was urged forward by the “king's friends”. Burke's advocacy of free trade was not, however, forgotten by his constituents, and his dismissal at the next election was already practically certain.\n\nA writ of inquiry was opened at Gloucester on the 9th April, 1778, to assess damages in an action brought by David Lewis, a Bristol merchant, against the mayor and Corporation. It appeared that the water bailiff had demanded illegal fees of the plaintiff, and that, on his refusal to pay them, his goods had been seized and sold by order of the Corporation. A verdict, with £50 damages and costs, was given for the complainant. About eighteen months later an action was tried at Gloucester assizes, Lewis being again the plaintiff, whilst the defendants were Sir John Durbin and other commissioners of the Court of Conscience. The ground of the action was the assault and imprisonment of Lewis after an illegal judgment delivered against him. For some inscrutable reason, the Corporation paid the damages and costs (£116) in this case also.\n\nA frigate of 32 guns, the Medea, was launched from Hilhouse's dock on the 28th April. Ship-building for the navy had been so long suspended in Bristol that the Journal very erroneously asserted that this was “the first king's frigate ever built in this port”. Four other frigates were then building in local yards.\n\nAfter a slumber of forty years the question of establishing a Mansion-house was revived at a meeting of the Council on the 13th June. It was unanimously resolved that a committee of the whole Chamber should be appointed to consider “of the taking some convenient house to be constantly occupied and used as a Mayoralty House”. On the 22nd August the committee advised that a mansion should be provided forthwith, and suggested that the house of Sir Abraham Isaac Elton, in St. James's Barton, together with the adjoining dwelling, would be most eligible for the purpose. Sir A. Elton had made an offer of his house for £1,500, and the commi"
