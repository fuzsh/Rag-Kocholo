        "meta_description": "This chapter considers the form, evolution and usefulness to historians of a group of closely related records: surveys, custumals, extents, terriers and rentals. The main objective of the thirteenth-century survey in its classic form was to provide a written description of the lands held by the manorial tenants, and to record the terms and conditions on which those lands were held. Clearly, an understanding of those basic tenures is essential to understanding the form, and subsequent evolution, of the survey. The distinction between free and unfree tenure was paralleled by a distinction between personal freedom and servility. The gradual demise of villeinage and serfdom in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is the most important social development of the era. The growing irrelevance of earlier surveys to the requirements of late-medieval land management inevitably resulted in changes to the content and format of later fourteenth- and fifteenth-century surveys.",
