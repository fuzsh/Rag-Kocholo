        "text": "Bulters History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe name Bulters is Anglo-Saxon in origin. It was a name given to a sifter of meal. Other evidence suggests that the surname Bulters was established as an area called Boulder. From there people acquired the surname. The name is also derived from the Old English word bulder which means boulder or cobblestone. Alternatively the name could have been derived from the word bolter which was a miller. Boulter's Lock and Boutler's Island are both located on the River Thames on the eastern side of Maidenhead, Berkshire.\n\nEarly Origins of the Bulters family\n\nThe surname Bulters was first found in Yorkshire, where they held a family seat from ancient times, long before the Norman Conquest in 1066.\n\nEarly History of the Bulters family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Bulters research. Another 33 words (2 lines of text) covering the years 1272, 1635, 1671, 1672, 1694, 1698, 1701, 1709, 1719, 1724 and 1742 are included under the topic Early Bulters History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nBulters Spelling Variations\n\nUntil the dictionary, an invention of only the last few hundred years, the English language lacked any comprehensive system of spelling rules. Consequently, spelling variations in names are frequently found in early Anglo-Saxon and later Anglo-Norman documents. One person's name was often spelled several different ways over a lifetime. The recorded variations of Bulters include Boulter, Bolter, Boulder, Bolteir and others.\n\nEarly Notables of the Bulters family\n\nDistinguished members of the family include Edmund Boulter (c.1635-1709), a London merchant and politician, Sheriff of London (1694); Edmund Boulter (c. 1635-1709), a London merchant and politician, Sheriff of London in July 1694, Member of Parliament for Boston (1698-1701); and Dr. Hugh Boulter (1672-1742), Church...\n\nAnother 45 words (3 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Bulters Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nMigration of the Bulters family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Bulters family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt. More information about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nMigration of the Bulters family\n\nThousands of English families boarded ships sailing to the New World in the hope of escaping the unrest found in England at this time. Although the search for opportunity and freedom from persecution abroad took the lives of many because of the cramped conditions and unsanitary nature of the vessels, the opportunity perceived in the growing colonies of North America beckoned. Many of the settlers who survived the journey went on to make important contributions to the transplanted cultures of their adopted countries. The Bulters were among these contributors, for they have been located in early North American records: Nathanial Boulter who settled in Hampton New Hampshire in 1630; William Boulter settled in New England in 1748; John Bolteir settled in Virginia in 1654..\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Bulters (post 1700) +\n\nJob Bulters (b. 1986), Dutch professional footballer\n\nRelated Stories +"
