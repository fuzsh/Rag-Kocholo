The names of fallen soldiers found in the CVWM are inscribed in the seven Books of Remembrance.\n\nThe Canadian Virtual War Memorial also includes the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)’s Honour Roll. The RCMP Honour Roll remembers those who lost their lives while performing operational police functions."
