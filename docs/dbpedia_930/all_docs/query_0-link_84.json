        "text": "Toward the end of January, 1686, the London doctor, Hans Sloane wrote to the naturalist John Ray, reporting to him (among other things) the ways that unscrupulous merchants were currently seeking to fool unwary purchasers of the febrifuge known as Jesuit’s Bark. ‘[I]t being so good a drug, that they begin to adulterate it with black cherry and other barks dipped in a tincture of aloes, to make it bitter’. Sloane noted that anyone familiar with the substance might spot the trickery immediately, for ‘the bitterness of the adulterated bark appears upon its first touch with the tongue, whereas the other is a pretty while in the mouth before it is tasted’. The letter included news that suggested Sloane might soon have considerable use for the drug himself. ‘I have talked a long while’, he wrote, ‘of going to Jamaica with the Duke of Albemarle as his physician, which, if I do, next to serving his grace and family in my profession, my business is to see what I can meet withal that is extraordinary in nature in those places. I hope to be able to send you some observations from thence, God Almighty granting life and strength to do what I design’.\n\nAlthough only twenty-six at the time, Sloane had already made a name for himself as a skilful collector of natural historical specimens. Travelling through France while undertaking a medical degree (granted at the University of Orange in 1683), he spent a portion of his time gathering a sizeable collection of flora, which he then sent to Ray to make use of in his three-volume History of Plants (1686–1704). Sloane’s previous work was on Ray’s mind when he responded to the news that the young man might soon be working on an island that had only recently come into English possession. ‘Were it not for the danger and hazard of so long a voyage’, wrote Ray in April 1687, ‘I would heartily wish such a person as yourself might travel to Jamaica, and search out and examine thoroughly the natural varieties of that island. Much light might be given to the history of the American plants, by one so well prepared for such an undertaking by a comprehensive knowledge of the European’. In June, Ray got more detailed about the kinds of questions he hoped Sloane could answer. Great things were expected, ‘no less than the resolving all our doubts about the names we meet with of plants in that part of America … You may also please to observe whether there be any species of plants common to America and Europe’. The largest number of specific queries derived from Ray’s readings of a recent book by a Jamaican doctor, Thomas Trapham. Trapham’s Discourse of the State of Health in the Island of Jamaica had appeared in 1679, and contained a number of natural historical observations. Ray wanted the better-trained Sloane to determine the origin of ambergris (was it really the juice of a metal or aloe dropped into the sea?), the nature of the plant known as ‘dumbcane’, and precisely what Trapham meant when he described the ‘shining barks of trees’ that he had seen.\n\nSloane had presumably already read Trapham’s text, not least as preparation for the work expected of him as physician to Jamaica’s new Governor. Trapham’s Discourse was the first English book written on the diseases of the West Indies. Indeed, today it is considered by some to be the first English monograph on tropical medicine more generally. Sloane would soon meet Trapham in Jamaica, where the two butted heads over the Duke’s medical treatment. The elite metropolitan physician was clearly irritated when Trapham was called in for a consultation as ‘one who understood the country diseases having lived there several years’. By his own account, however, Sloane ‘declined quarrelling with him. Thought my case hard enough in that I was blamed by some for want of success when his Grace would not take advice’. Neither doctor would achieve a great deal. The Duke died in October 1688, after which Sloane returned to England, having spent only fifteen months away.\n\nSloane’s interactions with both Ray and Trapham would profoundly shape the most substantial product of his brief sojourn in the West Indies, his two-volume Voyage to the Islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers, and Jamaica (1707 & 1725). Prior to this English-language work, in 1696 (by which time he had been elected secretary of the Royal Society), Sloane had published a Latin catalogue of Jamaican plant life. In writing a ‘short account’ of the catalogue at Sloane’s request, Ray answered a number of the questions he had first posed a decade earlier. Sloane, he noted ‘hath informed us that the Dumb-cane so called, which being tasted, inflames the tongue and jaws in that manner, that, for awhile, it takes away the use of speech, is not properly any species of reed or cane, but of arum, or wake-robin’. More generally, ‘we are assured by his work that there are some plants common, not only to Europe and America, but even to England and Jamaica, notwithstanding the great distance of place, and difference both of longitude and climate’. The import of this statement appeared in Sloane’s Preface to the 1707 volume of his Voyage. Responding to the potential retort that his discoveries in the West Indies were hardly surprising, since one might imagine that all the plant life in such a foreign clime was novel, Sloane wrote, ‘I answer it is not so … I find a great many plants common to Spain, Portugal, and Jamaica, more common to Jamaica and the East-Indies, and most of all common to Jamaica and Guinea’. The natural history he was offering, he argued, could ‘reasonably be suppos’d’ to describe not only the botanical world of the Americas, but even of Guinea and the East Indies and thus ‘to contribute to the more distinct knowledge of all those parts’.\n\nThe argument that related plants in America to those in England was important to Sloane’s overall purpose, which was, in part, to encourage a kind of trade of plant life between the Old and New Worlds. If one of Sloane’s aims was to teach those who lived in or near Jamaica the uses of plants growing wild or in their gardens, another was to educate those in England about the virtues – particularly the therapeutic virtues – of the materials that he brought back. ‘It may be objected’, he suggested, ‘that ‘tis to no purpose to any in these Parts of the World, to look after such [Jamaican] Herbs, &c. because we never see them; I answer, that many of them and their several Parts have been brought over, and are used in Medicines every day, and more may, to the great Advantage of physicians and Patients, were People inquisitive enough to look after them’. As he made this argument, Sloane could, presumably, count on his readership calling to mind the efficacy of Jesuit’s (or Peruvian) Bark. Now medicinal and other plants were thriving throughout Europe: in England and Ireland, Holland, Germany, and Sweden.\n\nAn argument about the similarity between Jamaica and Europe was also central to the medical portion of Voyage, which made up roughly 40 per cent of the 154-page Introduction to Volume I. Before leaving with the Duke, Sloane narrated, ‘I was told that the Diseases of this place were all different from what they are in Europe, and to be treated in a differing Method. This made me very uneasie, lest by ignorance I should kill instead of curing’. Sloane went on to inform the reader that his own experiences had shown that the notion that diseases in Europe and the West Indies were very different was false. ‘[A]bating some very few Diseases, Symptoms, &c. from the diversity of the Air, Meat, Drink &c. any person who has seen many sick people will find the same Diseases here as in Europe, and the same Method of Cure’. In fact, Sloane continued, in an oft-quoted sentence:\n\nFor my own part, I never saw a Disease in Jamaica which I had not met with in Europe, and that in People who never had been in either Indies, excepting one or two; and such instances happen to people practicing Physik in England, or anywhere else, that they may meet, amongst great number, with a singular disease, that they had never seen before, nor perhaps meet after with a parallel instance.\n\nMost scholars who have written about this aspect of Sloane’s work have tended to take the author’s statements at face value, seeing Sloane as an outlier largely because he portrayed himself as one. Thus, Harrison has argued that: ‘A few European physicians, such as Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753), expressed scepticism about the distinctiveness of diseases in the tropics, but such opinions (as Sloane himself noted) were at variance with both lay and professional opinion in the West Indies’. Wendy Churchill, similarly, has read Sloane as offering a ‘challenge to the developing notion that illness manifested differently in different climates’. It makes some intuitive sense to think of Sloane’s as an unorthodox position, for it would seem to run counter to ideas dating back to antiquity that related climates and characteristic diseases. Andrew Wear, for example, has identified an early modern European tradition based on the Hippocratic text, Airs, Waters, and Places. That tradition, he has argued, ‘contains both the constitution-shaping aspect of place and the belief that particular diseases reside in particular places’ and ‘acted in Europe as a conscious or unconscious template for views on the relationship between places, health, and disease’. However, although it is clear that a Hippocratic lineage for eighteenth-century texts on diseases and places existed, one must also emphasise the fact that the lineage was neither continuous, straightforward, nor hegemonic.\n\nI argue in this chapter that Sloane’s characterisation of medical understandings of the relationships between health and place were, if not wrong, at least rather selective. They served, at least in part, a particular set of social claims about the necessity, or not, for a doctor in Jamaica, to have expert, local knowledge of disease. Before making that case, however, it is necessary to capture the complexity of discourse about diseases and places prior to 1700. Section 2.1 explores the relative absence of references to Airs, Waters, and Places until the late sixteenth century, as well as the eventual deployment of the text in works such as Prosper Alpini’s De Medicina Aegyptiorum (1591) and Jacobus Bontius’ De Medicina Indorum (1645). Section 2.2 examines the flexibility and nuances of this neo-Hippocratic tradition from the seventeenth century onward, for Hippocrates’ text was used as much to draw similarities between far-flung locations with common airs, waters, and places as it was to delineate differences. Far from solely being a resource for rote arguments about the peculiarity of afflictions in foreign locations (although it was this, too) the arguments of Airs, Waters, and Places could also be deployed to draw distant lands closer, allowing boosters for colonial settlement to cast new areas as new-found ‘relations’: sites seemingly designed for British settlement. Different climates resulted in different diseases, to be sure. But we should be wary of ascribing our contemporary conceptions of the marked differences between the climates of the West Indies and of Britain (for example) to eighteenth-century actors, who also found many connections between the two sites."
