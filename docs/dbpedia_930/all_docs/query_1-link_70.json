        "text": "AUGUST 1982\n\n[I had recently had my first lessons on the double bass from a professional player; ten years before I had played the bass in my school orchestra, but I had never had a bass player to teach me how.]\n\nOn Monday 16th my sister Tig and I set off from our home near Norwich in the Fiat Panda. My double bass was in its cover on the roof rack. My dog Fido was also coming with us all the way to the Isle of Man. We had lunch at a pub near RAF Cranwell. Bill had travelled from his home near Whitby to see us for the day, and having shared the driving we arrived at the house of Marie Wragge (Bill’s mum) in Prestbury at four o’ clock. We three younger ones took the dog down to the Bollin river for a walk. The river had lots of Himalayan Balsam plants growing on the banks, and I enjoyed surprising Bill with their exploding seed pods. That evening he drove us all out to a village called Wincle, where we had smoked trout at the Ship Inn.\n\nOn Tuesday Bill had to catch the train back to Yorkshire, and we bade farewell to Mrs Wragge and drove off to catch the ferry at Liverpool. We had been to the Isle of Man two years earlier, with Bill on that occasion. We gave Fido a run in a disused railway yard beside the terminal and then boarded the RO-RO ferry, Mona’s Isle. The dog got on free, although I think he was supposed to have a ticket. He was able to walk round the ship on his lead. While Tig went to the bar I chatted to a Manxman who was returning to his birthplace after 20 years. After the crossing we drove round the island and saw the Viking longship Odin’s Raven at Peel. She had sailed to the IoM from Norway three years earlier.\n\nWe were staying in Tiggy’s friend Elly Cadell’s cottage near Port Erin. Elly, who was away as resident nurse at a sanatorium, was not then living in May Cottage. This pretty property had previously belonged to Ronnie Aldrich, the former bandmaster of the Squadronaires. We drove south from Peel to find the cottage; it is very picturesque but very damp, although not as bad as it had been in 1980 when Bill and I slept there. In spite of it being summer we had to light a fire, which began to dry things out a bit. There is a lovely moor nearby, with flowering grasses and heather, and so were able to exercise Fido. We had shepherd’s pie and apple tart for tea.\n\nOn Wednesday 18th I enrolled for the Festival and bought my ticket for the final concert. There is a newspaper for the competition called the Daily Scroll. Then with Tig I went to see the Glen Maye waterfall near Peel. We took Fido for a long walk and met a sheep in a pigsty. Then we had coffee and Tig bought me a deerstalker hat for 95p! I promptly left on Odin’s Raven, but Tig got it back. To Douglas and saw the horse-drawn and electric trams. We bought a ticket for Fido so he will be legal on the boat back.\n\nIn the evening I went to a concert by Rodney Slatford and 12 of his pupils from the Royal College of Music. Frances Dorling, a young bassist from Norwich who is studying at the Guildhall School of Music sat with me. She intends to be a professional musician.* She will be competing in the Festival later. I sent a postcard to our mutual teacher Colin Boulter to tell him the news.\n\nThursday; after breakfast I was taken to the Falcon’s Nest in Port Erin where they were holding a Junior Bass School. The warm-up studies were excellent; I suppose I should have been playing, but I would have been out of my depth even in a junior class! Alan Pickard who had taught music at Gresham’s when I was a pupil there has now returned to his native IoM where he has a music shop. I was talking to a couple of locals who were helping out at the concert. They knew Alan very well. After Fernando Grillo’s concert at the Art Centre I went to Alan Pickard’s bookshop and we reminisced on old times. He says that he wrote the Lt. Governor’s introduction in the programme for him! After lunch I went to the Railway Museum- Bill would have had a field day buying souvenirs, old tickets and crested crockery. Next I went to a lecture by a husband and wife who make bows for basses; they are going to show us rehairing later. Then to a Master Class by Barry Green. At cocktail hour I got talking to a student and an army trombonist who plays bass as a sideline. The evening concert was given by the prizewinner of the first competition in 1978. I chatted with Frances Dorling again and met another competitor, a young man called Mike Woolf [an American who is now Professor of Double Bass at the University of the Arts, Berlin].\n\nFriday, August 20th; today I fluctuated between despair at ever being able to play and enthusiasm. I walked Fido towards the Chasms after breakfast of fish fingers; the first class was at 9.30 so I did not have to rush. It was bowing exercises today, followed by a video of the BBC The Great Double Bass Race. Heard pieces by Mozart, Capuzzi and Bottesini. Had a drink with Frances in the Bass Bar and chatted to Joan, a bassist from the Western Australia Symphony Orchestra. Returned to the cottage to find Elly had arrived with her dog Honey, who Fido was very interested in.\n\nSaturday; drove into Port Erin for a lecture by Rodney Slatford on Koussevitsky (1874-1951), the Russian born conductor, composer and bass player. He spent most of his career in Boston, USA. After going round the Motor Museum I came home for sherry before lunch with Tig and Elly. The dogs get on well except when they are eating, when Honey gets the upper hand. Back for a class on bass maintenance; things like bass bar repairs and the fact the sound post always falls down when the strings are removed – all bass players know that. Then it was a very special Master Class by František Pošta (1919-1991), the Czech virtuoso. On the way over I was chatting to Barry, a bassist who plays with the Bournemouth Symphony who knows Colin Boulter very well – he bought his five string bass from him, a fine instrument by Benedikt Lang. František Pošta’s English is just adequate; his most memorable saying; ‘play in tune then add VIBRATO, play in time then add RUBATO‘. Back for a concert by Leonard Woolf. Barry tells me that Colin got a fellow bass player so drunk he had to be held up all though a concert!\n\nWhen I got back Tig and Elly were out with Elly’s friend Marie and I was locked out, but the back door was open. Apparently Honey had eaten Fido’s supper again; she will be getting enormous and poor Fido will fade away.\n\nSunday; Elly drove us to the Laxey Wheel, and told us to buy something to eat at the pub before going on the tram up Snaefell. We took rolls and cans of drink with us. We went to the summit, leaving the dogs behind. It was sunny, but the haze prevented us seeing any of the four other countries you can see on a good day (England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland). We descended and I saw two bassists on the tram going up. Elly took us to Tholt-y-Will Glen, and we walked down past the waterfalls to have a cup of tea at the bottom. We drove south to Fleshwick Bay where I gathered a lot of driftwood for the fire (although we had earlier bought some coal). Back to the cottage to burn some of the wood. This evening Fido was able to eat his food before Honey got to it.\n\nMonday morning Tig and I went to a secondhand bookshop in an old barn. The owner had died three months before and it was being run by his widow. We got a lot of books, a Wodehouse, Pick of Punch etc. I went to a recital at 2.30, it was by the eventual winner. I asked Frances what she did yesterday and she told me she spent it playing quartets with three other bassists. At May Cottage I sawed up some logs. The evening concert was by the Nash Ensemble.\n\nTuesday; a lot of walking in the rain; things kept getting cancelled but eventually I attended a lecture on position playing. At 10.30 there was a Jazz bass concert. Home, and Tiggie and I went to the Nautical Museum at Castletown. There we saw the armed yacht Peggy built in 1791 by an eccentric called Quayle. It had been walled up in its boathouse in the early 19th century and was rediscovered in 1951. At Port Erin I heard the lecture on hairing bows. On my return to the cottage I found the ladies having a bonfire in the garden and the house full of smoke. The recital this evening was by a Japanese competitor.\n\nWednesday. Tig took Fido to Ramsey and nearly ran into another car which pulled out into her path; she braked so suddenly Fido fell off the car seat. I did not go into Port Erin until 10 o’clock and watched a video of two members of the Berlin Phil playing cello and bass in pieces by Rossini, Mon, Paganini and Romberg. I sat through another recital with Joan, Frances left after two items. There was also a concert of Dragonettis and Bottesine pieces written for instruments other than the double bass. As it was such a lovely bright afternoon I skipped the Jazz recital and went round the open air museum, saw the train arriving but returned in time for cocktail hour. I had taken my copy of the 1978 competition programme for Joan to read. The František Pošta recital was well received by most of the audience but the music was not to Frances’s taste. Colin would say that the job of a professional musician is to play what is put in front of him, not to like what he hears. Afterwards I had a drink in the Bass Bar.\n\nThursday 26th August. It was the last day of the competition, taken up with recitals by the finalists in various categories. I bought Bill one of the last three dinner plates at the museum shop with the Isle of Man railway crest; it cost £4. The two Dutch bassists who Tig had met earlier in the week gave a very stylish recital. After the final performances (which Duncan McTier won) we went back to the Falcon’s Nest for a farewell drink at the Festival Final Reception. František Pošta shook us all by the hand.\n\n*Frances Dorling has worked as a freelance double bass for many of the professional orchestras in the UK. She played in the Dutch Tango quartet Cuarteto Rotterdam until 2008. For more details of Frances Dorling’s biography click here. To see her and hear her on the bass click here.\n\nFor some of my own later experiences playing the double bass click here. A list of the musicals I played in the decade to 1990 is given here.\n\n[I am told by his granddaughter that Colin Boulter died in February of this year- 2017. He had been living in London since 1982.]\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\nTHE BLOG FOR THE STORY OF THE DOUBLE BASS\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nRate this:\n\nI mean sweet or Spanish chestnuts, not horse chestnuts or conkers. Conkers may be fun for the young (although personally I rapidly got bored by whacking a conker on a string until mine or my opponent’s split) but sweet chestnuts are an enduring passion. Both chestnuts and conkers have a brief season. Chestnuts can be roasted on the kitchen hob, but my love of roast chestnuts has been rekindled by the recent purchase and installation of our woodburner. It is ideal for roasting chestnuts on the flat cast iron top.\n\nThere are other ways eating chestnuts; until I was married I had never eaten boiled chestnuts, but these were a favourite with Doris Turner, my mother-in-law. They are alright, but not as delicious as roast ones. There are lots of recipes that include chestnuts from soups and stuffings to marrons gladé; these are more my wife’s department. I can cope with simpe roasting.\n\nWhere to get your chestnuts from? Out local branch of Tesco will stock them some years and some years they won’t. These nuts when they have them are imported from Spain, like all the chestnuts available commercially. Although they grow prolifically in this country the size is generally meagre, and so no good for marketing. Some years when the climate has been suitably moist during the summer they do grow to a good size and may be gathered from the woods. Where I live this means Felthorpe Woods which are not much more than a mile away from where I live. They is no fence and people appear to be free to help themselves, although things may change now that the woods have recently been sold. These woods are full of chestnut trees.\n\nWhen gathering your own chestnuts sometimes the cases will already be open and you can see if the contents are of a decent size. More often than not however the cases will remain closed as they lie on the ground. The prickles are not as sharp as they are on conkers, but the job of undoing them can get a bit uncomfortable with bare fingers, and I prefer, if possible, to open up the cases by standing on them.\n\nLast season was one when Tesco had no chestnuts, at least in our branch. I have seen none this year either. I am no longer capable of gathering nuts for myself, so I am reliant on buying them where I can. I thought last year would be a nutless one, but in February Molly and I travelled to Brussels to visit my son who was living there at the time. There is a very good Sunday vegetable market outside the main railway station in Brussels, and there my wife found some kilo bags of chestnuts, and they were not at all expensive. By contrast if you buy a little bag of about three nuts already roasted on the streets of Norwich they cost a small fortune. Anyway, I was able to have my yearly ration of chestnuts after all. The nuts were not from Belgium at all, but imported across the globe from China!\n\nThey were certainly a good size, but the flavour was not quite as good as authentic Spanish chestnuts. Would I have thought this if had not spotted that they came from half way around the world? I think so, but I would say that, wouldn’t I? And they weren’t at all bad, when all’s said and done. The marvel is that they can be brought so far and still be sold for so little.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES OF EAST ANGLIAN LIFE\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nRate this:\n\nThis subject is rather irrelevant to East Anglia; we have not had significant improvements to our infrastructure since Queen Victoria was a young woman. It was then that the railways linking our East Anglian counties to the wider world were built. The motor age was largely ignored in the East. To go west one still has to take one’s life in one’s hands along single carriageway roads; there is no Motorway in East Anglia. Only the A11 is dual carriageway along its entire length and that is disrupted by severe delays at roundabouts like that at Barton Mills. Even our ‘International’ airport (at Norwich) has regular flights to just one foreign destination. There are no ferry ports in Norfolk or Suffolk, and even Harwich has only a service to the Hook of Holland, since that to Denmark was abandoned. There has been no investment in our railways for thirty years, since the lines from Kings Lynn and Norwich to London were electrified. Even a slight track realignment at Ely junction which is desperately needed has been delayed because the funds are not available. A similar plan to reinstate dual track through the town of Soham (and to reopen the station there) has been put off indefinitely because we cannot afford it; and this is just to restore a small part of our railway infrastructure to the status it enjoyed a hundred years ago.\n\nIt is not that we are a sleepy backwater in term of nationally important facilities. Forget the agricultural industry which produces more crops than any other region in Britain; it no longer employs many workers. But most of the country’s natural gas comes ashore at the terminal at Bacton in Norfolk and Felixstowe in Suffolk is one of our largest container ports. The Cambridge to Norwich corridor is promoted as a major artery in Life Sciences research. The North Sea wind farms are supplied from East Anglian ports. There is a strong possibility that we will we get another nuclear reactor at Sizewell. We are buzzing with state of the art industrial advances, yet the transport infrastructure lags woefully behind.\n\nCompare this with the enormous sums of money being wasted on HS2 (the High Speed railway line from London to Northern England). This involves an eye-watering investment even on current projections, which will inevitably prove to be far too small. Nor will the communities through which this white elephant will charge gain any advantage; to reach their destination in Birmingham or Manchester a few minutes earlier the trains will not be able to stop on the way. Surely the investment in HS2 would be better spent on smaller improvements that are so desperately needed across the country, but especially in East Anglia.\n\nEven the reopening of the line from Wisbech to March has no prospect of happening. The track is still in place, although with years of neglect it would all need to be replaced. The only politician who sees the restoration of rail passenger services to Wisbech as a matter of urgency is Jeremy Corbyn, and this project alone makes me look wistfully at the distant prospect of him becoming Prime Minister.\n\nCorbyn is against nuclear defence. If we could afford both nuclear and conventional weapons I would be in favour, but we can’t. These American missiles hardly constitute a genuine independent deterrent anyway. Once they had been binned by the Corbynistas this would leave the way clear for some future government to spend the money saved on real defence – the ships and aircraft that we cannot at present afford. It is true that Jeremy has the bizarre notion of removing the nuclear missiles but retaining the submarines they are held in, to protect Scottish jobs. In fact the loss of Trident would remove the last thing connecting Clydebank in Scotland with England and free the way for Scottish Independence; the inhabitants of that benighted country could then pursue whatever third world future they chose. They seem to have forgotten the terrible muddle they got into that led to the Act of Union in the first place.\n\nSo will any of these things ever come to pass? Will any infrastructure improvements come our way? Well there is a plan to speed up the trains from Liverpool Street to Norwich by closing level crossings in Norfolk, but the loss of road connections hardly sounds like improving anything. There is also the prospect of building the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway, but this will be a brand new Motorway, not the reopening of the Varsity railway line. This rail link would not require huge civil engineering investment as the line is still mostly intact, though large stretches of it are overgrown with weeds. In every particular the clever people at the top get all these decisions totally wrong. I could understand them making a few mistakes, but to be so monumentally incompetent takes some doing. We need the infrastructure but not what is proposed, at such great expense. Perhaps that explains why our national debt is about the largest in the world in terms of GDP, and it is growing by nearly one and a half billion pounds a week.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\nTHE BLOG FOR THE FUTURE OF EAST ANGLIA\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nRate this:\n\nThere is once again a paper-mill in Norfolk, over sixty years after the last of the old mills closed. This new mill belongs to the German firm Palm Paper, and is a huge facility just to the south of Kings Lynn on the Great Ouse river. It produces 450,000 tonnes of newsprint a year, and it is one of the largest paper-mills in the world. This is a far cry from the first paper-mill in Norfolk which opened not many miles away from Kings Lynn in 1695. This was converted from a fulling mill (for the treatment of woollen cloth) in Castle Rising. This was known as the Upper Mill to distinguish it from another one further downstream on the Babingley river. There are records of five mills (including wind-mills) in Castle Rising, although not all were working at the same time. There was no printing industry in Norfolk until the early 18th century and although a certain amount of writing paper was required this first mill probably made paper used in pressing cloth or wrapping paper.\n\nThe next paper-mill in Norfolk was also converted from a fulling mill – a popular choice as the water powered hammers used to beat the cloth could easily be converted to making pulp for paper. This was in Taverham, a small village on the river Wensum about five miles outside Norwich. It opened in 1701. From the first it advertised itself as making ‘paper suitable for printing’ although there was then no printer to make use of it. Lacking this essential industry, Norwich was obviously keen to attract a printer, and this they soon did in the person of a young craftsman from London called Francis Burges. The capital in London and the two university towns of Oxford and Cambridge were the only places where printing had been allowed until 1695, when Parliament refused to renew the Licensing Act which controlled printing. Bristol had been quicker off the mark than Norwich in setting up a printing office, but the City was not far behind, and it was Norwich that produced the first newspaper outside London.\n\nDuring the 18th century a number of paper-mills were active in Norfolk. A few miles away from Taverham the mill at Lyng (also on the river Wensum) had a paper-mill that was operated by the same partnership as Taverham mill. A few more miles upstream from Lyng another mill at Swanton Morley, and to the north-east the mill at Oxnead on the river Bure also made paper. To the south of Norwich on the river Tas the mill at Stoke Holy Cross made paper until it was taken over by the Colman family in the early 19th century as their main mustard mill. With all these mills producing paper around the city of Norwich there must have a healthy trade among rag merchants, as old rags were the raw material that they all relied upon. There was a paper-mill at Sheringham that may have used old sails and ropes from the shipping industry to produce a lower quality paper.\n\nThe paper mill at Thetford was able to gather rags from the Ouse basin, and this material was brought up to the town by barge. This we know from a court report where a number of men were prosecuted for stealing from a barge involved in transporting rags to the town. The first reference to paper making at Bishop’s Mill in Thetford dates back to 1735, and the pulp mill in the town did not finally close until circa 1955. The paper mill at Oxnead closed in the 1820s (although it briefly reopened as a paper-mill in the middle of the 20th century), that at Castle Rising in the mid-nineteenth century and the mills at Lyng, Swanton Morley and Sheringham at around the same time. Although no longer required for producing paper these water-mills were still a useful source of power, and most were converted to corn milling. Taverham paper mill was an exception, and when this mill closed in 1899 it was left derelict. Most of the structure was demolished in the first half of the 20th century, only the former canteen block remaining today.\n\nA late-comer to the paper-milling business was the city of Norwich. Carrow paper-mill in King Street was erected in 1874/8, and the cardboard it produced was used for packing the goods made at Carrow Works, mainly laundry starch, blue and (naturally) mustard. It had closed by the mid twentieth century. Another Norwich mill was St Miles mill near Oak Street bridge. In 1890 this was a steam mill. All across the country steam was taking over as the power to drive paper manufacturing. Today electricity is the power used in all forms of industry including paper-mills.\n\nAlthough water has long ceased to be the power source, large amounts of water are still needed to produce the pulp paper is made from, so all paper-mills are located by a river. Once the chemical process for breaking down wood into pulp had been perfected, this became almost the sole source of fibre used in the industry. Only highly specialised products like artists’ paper still used rags. The softwood was imported from Scandinavia and the most successful paper-mills were located on river estuaries, where the ships could unload their cargoes of logs. For hundreds of years, until the late nineteenth century, the industry had relied exclusively on recycled material. At first this raw material was in the form of linen rags; once the mills round Manchester began processing Indian cotton this material became the principal source of rags. Factory waste from cotton mills was also recycled in paper-mills. In the 19th century demand for paper exceeded the supply of recyclable rags, and this produced a bottleneck in the system. Esparto grass from North Africa was used as an alternative to rags, but it was the use of wood pulp which eventually solved the problem. Although in the first instance wood is a virgin raw material, once used the paper can be recycled up to eight times. This brings us neatly back to Kings Lynn and to Palm paper. One hundred percent of their production is made from recycled newsprint.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\nTHE BLOG FOR MEMORIES OF EAST ANGLIAN LIFE\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nRate this:\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF NUNS IN ANGLO-SAXON TIMES\n\nNUNS occupied an important position in Anglo-Saxon society, and it is doubtful if women have again been so influential until very recent times. Let us take for an example the Synod of Whitby (664). This was an epoch-making occasion in English history. Although it was nominally about the date of Easter and the wearing of the monastic tonsure, it was in fact an agreement which tied the church in England to the Pope, rather than to the Irish church. In the seventh century this church was a separate institution, owing almost no allegiance to the bishop in Rome. This agreement thus orientated England to the continent of Europe, rather than to an offshore island in the Atlantic. There is still as basic argument about whether we a part of Europe or not!\n\nIn regard to the importance of women, the point is that this important conference was held under the aegis not of a man, but of Abbess Hilda of Streoneshalh (Whitby). To take another example of important nuns, the Abbey at Ely was, like that at Whitby, a double monastery for both monks and nuns. This was true of many convents in England; moreover, it was not the males who took the first place in these institutions; the monasteries were ruled over by Abbesses. The reason for this importance of nuns relates to the social arrangements of the Anglo-Saxon royal families. The boys were expected to take up arms, but the girls were placed in the church. Thus the religious houses had plenty of royal nuns among their number, while royal monks were far fewer. Because of social status, it was the nuns who took control of the religious life in the land, and religion was in those times a potent force.\n\nThe connection between royalty and nuns is seen in the special place accorded to women in the care of the tombs of Royal Saints and Martyrs. As I have said, men were expected to take up arms and as a consequence kings were frequently killed in those bloody times. According to the circumstances, these royal deaths could often result in the creation of a martyr. The tenth century king of England, Edward the Martyr, was little more than a boy when he was murdered at Corfe Castle. In life he had been something of a spoilt brat, but in death he was granted martyr status. The care of his body was entrusted to the nuns at Alfred the Great’s foundation at Shaftesbury Abbey.\n\nAnother Royal Martyr was St Edmund, king of East Anglia. Women also played a prominent part in his early cult. Not many decade after his death the first of the guardian of Edmund’s tomb who we know by name was a widow called Oswen. She it was who trimmed the saint’s nails and cut his hair, which by all accounts miraculously continued to grow after his death. Surprising the Abbey at Bury St Edmunds was not dedicated to St Edmund himself; it was prevented from being so dedicated by a disagreement with the king, Cnut. It was instead dedicated to Christ and St Mary, with Edmund only mentioned in third place almost as an afterthought. The only monastic building in England dedicated to St Edmund was that at Lyng in Norfolk, and that was a nunnery.\n\nWomen continued to play a significant role in St Edmund’s cult until the Norman Conquest, which brought with it a more masculine form of society. Even at the time of the Domesday survey it is recorded that there were still many nuns accompanying the monks at Bury St Edmunds Abbey. That was twenty years after king William had come to the throne, but there were fewer females in positions of influence after that. The reign of Empress Matilda shows that women could still attain the highest position in the land, but the time, known as the Anarchy, was a disaster. There were no other reigning queens in England for centuries. Now we are very happy to have Queen Elizabeth as our monarch.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BOLG FOR HISTORY\n\nRate this:\n\nThere has been an enormous growth in public lighting over the last 70 years. The Second World War had just finished; during the conflict the blackout had meant there was no street lighting permitted. Astronomy was not uppermost in the majority of people’s minds during the war, but the absence of light pollution must have produced ideal conditions for stargazers.\n\nI am too young to remember the blackout, but when I first became aware of my surroundings it was still possible to look up at the night sky outside my home and see the stars twinkling above me. In the 1950s only the towns had street lights, so all the villages were plunged into darkness after nightfall. Small rural communities did not expect their nighttime to be bathed in light, and the idea of illuminating empty roads in the countryside would have seemed bizarre.\n\nHaving been to visit our relations at Kings Lynn it was always a delight for me to return to Norwich at night. After leaving the West Norfolk town the only place to have a few lights was Fakenham, so after many miles of darkness it was magical to look down on the lights of Norwich from the crest of the hill in Drayton. How things have changed! Now the street lights go for miles along the road, through Drayton and Taverham too, and there is no delightful view of the bright city lights. In those days the lights of Norwich were largely mercury vapour lamps, which gave off a greenish tinge. The 60s saw the change over to sodium vapour, whose orange light was less attractive.\n\nAfter travelling through the centre of the city we left through the village of Trowse on our way to Poringland. Trowse was adjacent to Norwich and was highly unusual for a village at that time in having street lights. This was no doubt a kindness provided by Mr Colman, a modern facility for his workers who largely populated the village. These street lights were still, in the 1950s, old-fashioned gas lights however, which had to be lit by the lamp lighter. This was a man with a ladder who went round every evening to light the lamps, and again in the morning to turn them off. The light the gas mantles shed was even more attractive than the mercury vapour lamps of the city.\n\nThe only rural communities to have any permanent outdoor lighting were those lucky enough to possess a railway station. There the platform would have oil lamps, and this form of illumination lasted until the majority of villages lost their stations in the 1960s. Otherwise the only permanent lighting in the countryside was indoors, and this was mostly provided by candles until the arrival of electricity. The occasional oil lamp might be held in the hand of someone who had to venture outdoors, where a candle would soon have blown out.\n\nIn the towns and cities where there was street lighting in the 19th century the lamp posts were made of cast iron. This was true of gas lamps and it remained true of electric lights when these arrived. The cross member at the top was made of wrought iron, and this is nicely demonstrated by the photograph of St Benedict’s street at the top of this page. I mentioned towns and cities, because by the time villages and rural main roads began to get street lighting the construction method had changed to reinforced concrete. The main advantage of this from the council’s point of view was that these did not require painting. Cast iron lamp posts have now all but disappeared in this country, but in Beziers in Southern France they still have cast iron lamp posts decorated with climbing art nouveau foliage. I think there are still some mild steel ones about here in England.\n\nStreet lighting is now so pervasive that the whole globe appears like a gaudy bauble from space. There has been a reaction to this, and attempts have been made to reduce the unnecessary lighting in the dead of night, in residential areas at least. There the illumination serves no purpose when the inhabitants are fast asleep. Needless to say, this eminently sensible suggestion has met with vocal opposition from those who fear marauding night-dwellers, who would do vile deeds in the hours of darkness.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE BLOG FOR THE STORY OF EAST ANGLIA\n\nRate this:\n\nMINING, SPINNING, PAPERMAKING & PRINTING; Industrial History.\n\nWe spent our summer holiday in Matlock, Derbyshire, in 2003. This was my wife Molly, son aged 15, daughter aged 13 and me. We went by car, which was quite an experience for us, accustomed as we were to the flat lands of East Anglia. As we were approaching the town we went down a hill so steep that our brakes overheated – we should have selected first gear! Once settled into our hotel we could appreciate the hills without anxiety; the view from our bedroom window included the prospect of Riber Castle – but more of that later.\n\nMatlock is but a town, as opposed to Derby which is a city, yet Matlock is the county town of Derbyshire. The Derbyshire Record Office is in Matlock, and this too will be referred to later in this post. County Hall is also in Matlock; it was previously the Hydro, constructed by the industrialist John Smedley who also built Riber Castle as his home. As you can tell, Riber Castle is not Medieval gothic but Victorian ‘Gothick’.\n\nMasson mill is on the river Derwent a few miles downstream from Matlock. In 1771 a paper mill had been built in the village Matlock Baths, but Sir Richard Arkwright added a much larger mill in 1783. It was Arkwright’s revolutionary idea to harness the power of the river Derwent for cotton spinning. Previously spinning had been done as a cottage industry by individuals, largely by women using a simple distaff in their own homes. Arkwright introduced spinning machines and employed a large workforce, which increased the output of cotton yarn by a factor of 50. This laid the foundations for the great cotton industry which grew up in Lancashire and particularly around Manchester. If the origins of the Industrial Revolution can be traced to a single time and place it is to 1783 and to Matlock in Derbyshire. Lombe’s silk throwing mill in Derby was built a few years earlier, but silk did not have universal appeal that cotton goods had. Masson mill did not cease producing cotton yarn until 1991.\n\nWe had a great time ascending the Heights of Abraham (it is named after the Plains of Abraham in Quebec where General Wolfe was killed). This cliff is not far outside Matlock, and is accessed by a cable car from Matlock Baths. This village we reached by train from Matlock; since Beeching wielded his axe Matlock has been the terminus of the Derwent line from Derby. This line formerly continued to Buxton and thence to Manchester. I will not get on my hobby-horse about the foolish short-sightedness of this and other closures. The railways lost money before Beeching and they continued to lose just as much money after him; today the privatised railway still need enormous government subsidy. At least the trains still run to Matlock; the number of passengers using the station has more than doubled since we used it a dozen years ago. At the Heights of Abraham, once we had gone over the gorge in a Gondola car, we were able to explore the lead mines which were first excavated in Roman times; this continued until the eighteenth century. The last lead mine in the Peak District did not close until 1940. The caverns have regular guided tours, one of which we took.\n\nMatlock Baths got its name from the spa which was developed there after the discovery of hot springs in the eighteen century. Lord Byron compared the scenery at Matlock Baths to Switzerland. Although the fashion for spa bathing has passed into history, Matlock Baths is still a popular resort with ice cream sellers, fish and chip shops and fruit machines all along the bank of the river Derwent, very much like a seaside town.\n\nA day or two later we walked up to Riber Castle, which was then in a completely derelict state. The property had not been occupied since 1930, when the boys’ boarding school which had acquired the site on the death of John Smedley’s widow closed. By the 21st century the ruin was roofless, and even the Wildlife Park that had occupied the grounds until the year 2000 was no more. Since then the whole building has been restored, re-roofed and fitted with new windows. Although not quite ready for occupation, it has been turned into a large number of flats. They will certainly have commanding views across the valley to Matlock. In the past it used to be problematical supplying the property with water, as it is at the top of a hill.\n\nA few years after my first visit to Matlock I made another journey there, this time to research the machine-made paper manufacturing business which was set up in Taverham, Norfolk, in 1809. Why this necessitated a visit to Derbyshire requires a little explanation; the designer of the Fourdrinier machine in question was one Brian Donkin, who worked from Bermondsey in London. Years after his time the firm he founded relocated to Chesterfield in Derbyshire and its archives were eventually deposited in the Matlock Record Office. These included Brian Donkin’s diary of his time in Taverham. While staying at Taverham, besides installing the paper machine in Norfolk, he was informed of the concept of the world’s first rotary printing press by its inventor Richard Bacon. “THE BACON-DONKIN PRINTING MACHINE; Norfolk and the origin of the rotary press” is an article I wrote for the Norfolk Industrial Archaeological Annual as a result of this research.\n\nOn this occasion I stayed at a bed and breakfast run by a lady who originated in Bulgaria. She was a member of that country’s Baptist community which I had not imagined existed until then. She had a well-stocked bookcase in my bedroom and I found a biography of C. S. Lewis which provided me with interesting reading after my days’ work in the Record Office.\n\nMy other visits to Derbyshire, particularly to Chatsworth House, Bakewell (where we had to sample the authentic Bakewell tart) and Monsal Head must wait for another time.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nMATLOCK, CRADLE of the INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\n\nRate this:\n\nThere were two periods in my life when bonfire night assumed great importance. The first lasted about seven years until I was fourteen, but it was divided into two distinct halves, which I will explain later. The second period was when my own children were a similar age.\n\nThe excitement lasts longer than just the night of November the Fifth; it grows as the bonfire builds. We were never at a loss for things to burn; there were always plenty of sticks, dead leaves and garden rubbish in the autumn. Bonfire Night comes just at the right time of year to get rid of all the garden detritus that has been accumulated through the summer. In the days before the local council provided a wheelie bin to take it away, this pile of debris demanded that we had a bonfire, regardless of the national celebration of Guy Fawkes’ failure to blow up parliament.\n\nThere is no denying the effect that the earlier celebration of Hallowe’en had on Bonfire Night; coming just five days later many of the features were simply transferred from the Popish festival to one than even Puritans could tolerate. For example turnip lanterns were still a feature of Bonfire Night when I was a child. These had faces carved on them. just as pumpkins have on Hallowe’en. All Saints Eve was never mentioned in Britain until the 1970s; I could not even tell you when it was before then. When this old Catholic Holy Day was reintroduced, albeit in secular form, it came from America. It is slightly puzzling that the American migrants, who were originally far more strictly Protestant than Britons, should have preserved this Roman Catholic tradition.\n\nWhen the added excitement of fireworks became a part of Bonfire Night I am not quite sure; the first English firework display I am aware of was on the 27th April 1749. That was held in Green Park, London, to celebrate the signing of Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle the previous year. The only reason I know of that occasion is because of Handel’s famous wind band suite, Music for the Royal Fireworks, which he wrote for that night’s revelry. There were certainly other earlier examples of public firework displays, but fireworks would not have been available for ordinary folk to purchase until the late 19th century.\n\nThere are dangers to letting off fireworks, but so long as you are sensible these are manageable. When I was a lad fireworks were much more scary and dangerous. There were cracker-jacks that were deliberately thrown at your feet; these would jump about with an explosion every second or two, and you never knew where the would go next. Bangers were even worse, and were thrown at unsuspecting by-standers by ill-intentioned teenagers. This kind of firework had no visual impact, just a loud noise. Even so, I can remember no injuries from such explosions, but all these devices have been banned long ago. Fireworks only ever came out on Guy Fawkes night. It was just possible to have them on the following Saturday night if the 5th of November fell mid-week. After November the Fifth they disappeared for another year. They were never a part of high days and holidays like birthdays and New Year’s Eve as they are today. Indeed I assumed that it was actually illegal to set them off except on November the Fifth.\n\nFor me the home bonfires ended when I was nine, because thereafter I was at boarding school for Guy Fawkes Night. The importance of the celebration itself only increased however. All the boarders would co-operate in building the bonfire, which began weeks ahead. It was no longer a domestic sized affair but a huge mountain of combustible material. We would take a handcart down to the school woods just to gather sticks and branches. The Guy too became a joint effort. When I had made one at home it had always been an effigy of the historical Guy Fawkes. Now at school the Guy represented the particular hate-figure of the day. Who the ‘bad guy’ was I have no idea fifty years later, but as this was 1959 perhaps it was Castro. The celebration of Guy Fawkes Night ended when I entered the Senior School; the occasion was no longer celebrated – it would certainly have been used for smoking surreptitious cigarettes in the dark.\n\nWhat about poor old Guido Fawkes himself? He and his fellow conspirators had intended to blow up the House of Lords in November 1605, killing King James I and thus clearing the way for the restoration of the Catholic church in England. Guy Fawkes was certainly a terrorist, perhaps the first in the modern sense of the term. The barrels of gunpowder were discovered and the plotters were arrested; the plot was an abject failure. But even if the plot had gone perfectly for Guy Fawkes, it is unimaginable that the Pope would thereafter have been accepted as the head of the English church. Things do not work like that, a fact which potential terrorists would do well to remember. The Catholic IRA attempted a very similar bomb outrage well within living memory in Brighton; then the bomb actually exploded and there was loss of life. Admittedly the objective was more political than religious, but the suicide bombers who carried out the 7/7 attack were motivated largely by religious considerations; what is it that makes bombs and religion go together? Whatever the motives for terrorist outrages, they never achieve what they set out to achieve. Northern Ireland is still a part of the United Kingdom, and if it rejoins Southern Ireland it will not be as result of bombings. I think few people have had their view of Islam improved by the prospect of being blown up. At least we can be glad that Guy Fawkes avoided the gory and slow death of being hanged, drawn and quartered by falling off the scaffold and breaking his neck.\n\nThese are troubling thoughts; let us return to the fun of fireworks and Bonfire Night.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE STORY of the 5th of November\n\nRate this:\n\nI am not a great fan of the phone box. They did not feature much in my life, even in the days when they were an essential part of most people’s lives. This was because I was in the very fortunate position of belonging to a family that already had a phone. This black Bakelite instrument stood silently in the hall of our bungalow, but when it sprang into life the bell made a dominating noise that you could not ignore. This was not a phone dedicated to our own use, but a so-called party line. This meant that the connection was shared with another subscriber, and sometimes you could not use the it because the other user was on the phone.\n\nThe other reason the phone box did not feature in my childhood experience is that there was not one anywhere near our house. Quite how far I cannot now tell you, but the nearest box must have been about a mile away. There was undoubtedly a phone box in our village somewhere, but it is an extended settlement and we lived right on the edge of it. As a consequence of there being no local phone box, those of our neighbours who needed to use the phone in an emergency tended to borrow ours.\n\nThe iconic phone box was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and was introduced in 1926. It differed in several respects from Scott’s original intention. The K2 telephone kiosk is cast in iron, rather than being fabricated from mild steel as he had proposed; also his plan was to have them painted silver. The door closes automatically and protects you from the elements. A rudimentary ash tray was provided to allow you somewhere to place your cigarette while speaking into the receiver. The original telephone kiosk had been made in 1920 out of concrete, and there have been several other designs since.\n\nThe one we all regard as the archetypal ‘red box’ is the K2. The same design appears elsewhere in the world; Irish phone boxes are the same pattern but are painted green of course, and have a harp instead of the Royal Crown at the top. The phone boxes in Malta and Gibraltar are painted red, as are the ones in Bermuda, but in the latter country it is so hot that being shut in would be claustrophobic and they do not have doors. The phone boxes on the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands used to be red until the 1960s; then the local postal services was run by the GPO, but since these have been transferred to these various island authorities they have been painted green, yellow or blue. In Jersey they have since assuming control of their Post Office kiosk been painted yellow are are of a different design..\n\nThere have been many attempts to find new uses for phone booths since the almost universal availability of mobile phones made them all but redundant. Unfortunately their perfect suitability for the purpose of housing a phone makes them unsuitable for anything else. They have been converted to defibrillator centres, solar powered mobile phone chargers and mini-libraries, but none of these uses seem to fit the space. What sort of library can you fit in phone box ? To use a defibrillator you need to be a trained first aider at the very least, and what are the chances of one of them, a patient and a phone box all meeting up when required? The mobile phone charger seems the best option, but the experiment has now ceased. As I said, I have never been a great fan of the phone box, and if they were all removed I would not be greatly distressed. At least they would not appear as Grade 2 listed buildings all across the country, in a sorry state of repair, derelict, rusty, growing moss and phone-less.\n\nJOSEPH MASON\n\njoemasonspage@gmail.com\n\nTHE HISTORY OF ENGLAND\n\nRate this:"
