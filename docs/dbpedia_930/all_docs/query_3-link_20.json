        "text": "KYLE EDMUND finally won a match at Wimbledon at the fifth time of asking, and admitted it had been a long time coming.\n\nThe 22-year-old world number 50, a first-round loser four times in both singles and doubles, won the battle of Britain against Alex Ward on Court Three.\n\nWard, who has slipped to 869th in the world rankings after a string of injuries and needed a wild card just to get into the qualifying competition, threatened to continue his fairytale by winning the first set.\n\nBut Edmund, the British number two, eventually imposed himself on his friend and compatriot and ran out a 4-6 6-3 6-2 6-1 winner.\n\n“It’s nice to just win in general,” he said. “Especially, I guess, because you’re British, it’s the one tournament you want to do well in more than any other tournament.\n\n“It’s more from your heart, because as a kid you watch this sort of event. To actually say that I’ve won one now is nice to say.”\n\nElsewhere in SW19, Great Britain’s Katie Boulter came close to a shock debut victory but ultimately came up short against the US’s Christina McHale.\n\nBoulter defied a gap of 178 places in the world rankings to lead by a set and then by a break in the decider, only for McHale to fight back and win 3-6 7-5 6-3.\n\nGranted a wild card to make her first singles appearance in the main draw at the All England Club, Boulter will have been disappointed not to capitalise on what was a stirring opening performance.\n\nMeanwhile, Roger Federer reached the second round of Wimbledon for the 15th consecutive year after opponent Alexandr Dolgopolov retired during the second set.\n\nIn what was a near repeat of the previous match on Centre Court, when Martin Klizan pulled the plug against Novak Djokovic, Dolgopolov retired with an ankle injury when trailing 6-3 3-0.\n\nThe victory means Federer has moved ahead of Jimmy Connors with his 85th match win at Wimbledon — the most of the open era."
