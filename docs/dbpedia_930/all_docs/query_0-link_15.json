This book provides an in-depth analysis of the details surrounding the events that shaped Christian’s musical development, beginning with his early influences of ‘Territory bands’ and ‘western swing’ groups. The book documents Christian’s performances in the urban area of Oklahoma City on Second Street, better known as ‘Deep Deuce’, as well as his travels with both Anna Mae Winburn and the Alphonso Trent Orchestra. Christian’s discovery by producer John Hammond led to Christian’s membership in the Benny Goodman Sextet in August of 1939. The book also chronicles Christian’s most significant radio broadcasts, live performances, and recordings for Columbia Records, and also includes facts regarding Christian’s pioneering guitar style during the early 1940’s,as his performances at Minton’s Playhouse in Harlem represented the connection between swing and bebop. The biography finally uncovers details into Christian’s private life, and his untimely death during the apex of the Goodman era.\n\nPrice: $279.95\n\nBoulter, Roger Stephen\n\n2012 0-7734-2586-1 404 pages\n\nThis book reconsiders the life of former South African Defense Minister, F.C. Erasmus. Although an architect of the Nationalists' post-war election victory, he was not considered a minster of the first rank. Erasmus initiated a process of ridding the defense force of officers who he believed were associated with the government of Jan Smuts. Erasmus felt that the armed services had been too British in its ethos and appearance and wanted to create a force that was uniquely South African. However, without an immanent military threat, Erasmus never received a substantial budgetary allocation to modernize the military which left the military unable to assist the civil power in suppressing disturbances. Moreover, while Erasmus sought to cement South Africa’s relations with the West, he was unsuccessful in creating an anti-communist alliance for the land and maritime defense of Africa. This new biography looks at the events and time period that shaped this period of South African history in an attempt to correct misinterpretation of this period.\n\nPrice: $259.95\n\nCupillari, Antonella\n\n2008 0-7734-5226-5 340 pages\n\nThis book brings together for the first time in English the most important historical publications on the life and work of Maria Gaetana Agnesi, an important eighteenth-century mathematician.

Her own life as a revolutionist and writer, and her writings about women will interest those in women’s studies. As an Irish nationalist in a movement that had considerable influence on subsequent nationalist leaders like Arthur Griffin, her views in her revolutionary poems and articles are still pertinent.\n\nPrice: $339.95\n\nArndt, Eve Marie\n\n2001 0-7734-7410-2 312 pages\n\nThis first full-length critical study of Sean O’Faolain’s oeuvre in 25 years explores this neglected Irish writer and puts his achievement in historical and political context. Arndt’s theoretical framework uses primarily Foucault and Fanon. Though O’Faolain tried to convey a picture of himself as an internationalist, he also remained emotionally attached to his Irish roots. This study proposes that these fundamental points lie at the heart his often contradictory arguments on contemporary Irish issues such as the Gaelic heritage, Catholicism, nationalism, and the Anglo-Irish and English colonial presence in Ireland. Essential reading for those interested in cultural, political, historical and literary aspects of 20th century Ireland.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nBarnette, W. Douglas\n\n1995 0-7734-8983-5 164 pages\n\nThis book is the first to study in English the poetry of Manuel Mantero, a member of the Spanish Generation of 1950, and winner of major prizes for his poetry while living in Spain, in self-exile in the United States since 1969.

Bartholomew Booth, Oxford-educated, entered the Church of England and became a country schoolmaster. He opened his own academies first in Liverpool, later in Lancashire and Essex, offering an unusually wide curriculum, broadly following the educational philosophy of Benjamin Franklin. Booth emigrated to Maryland in 1773 with two of his three sons, his two patronesses. After siding with the Revolutionary cause, he returned to his educational work and opened academies in Maryland, at The Forest of Needwood and at Delamer, for the sons of the leaders of the Revolution, including Benedict Arnold, Dr. William Shippen, and members of the Washington family. Despite the privations of war, his work prospered and the popularity of his enlightened curriculum endured until his death in 1785.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nColetta, Paolo\n\n1997 0-7734-8676-3 508 pages\n\nThis biography of Admiral Marc Mitscher follows him from his days at the Naval Academy through his days in two World Wars: commanding three naval air stations during WWI, and then as Commander Fleet Air for many missions in the east during WWII, including the Battle of Midway, the Marianas, Leyte Gulf, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Following WWII, he served as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air) and finally as Commander, Atlantic Fleet. He was the first aviator to make admiral and fill combat commands. This book will be of interest to scholars of the two world wars, as well as of U.S. Naval and Air history. Includes many photographs and maps.\n\nPrice: $299.95\n\nMoremen, Grace E.\n\n2003 0-7734-6836-6 520 pages\n\nThis is the first full biography ever written of Adolphus Frederick, Duke of Cambridge, youngest and, arguably, favorite son of King George III. It is the thesis of this biography that of the seven surviving sons, Adolphus was most successful at internalizing the kings concept of royal duty, which enabled him to live a purposeful and productive life in a time of immense technological, political, and social change. It documents a multitude of facts long buried in archives and newspapers, which add to knowledge on such topics as the complex dynamics in the family, the nature of the Personal Union between Hanover and Britain, student life at Göttingen University; the crucial part played by the Hanoverian military in the defeat of Napoleon and Adolphuss active role as an officer; the Kingdom of Hanover during the 1830s; his happy marriage as illustrated by letters from his wife, never before published; the early years of Victorias reign, and Adolphuss devotion to many good causes. With many illustrations.\n\nPrice: $299.95\n\nHawkshaw, Susan\n\n2023 1-4955-1148-0 216 pages\n\n\"This book will explore the career of renowned cellist Aldo Parisot, using first hand interviews with him and his wife Elizabeth as well as material from written sources. The book will stress Mr. Parisot's solo career, and will also touch upon his teaching career. My argument will be that Parisot is an extraordinary cellist with a creative bent. Not only was he an exceptional interpreter of what composers put on paper, but he also made creative suggestions to composers with regard to how their music might be more effective on the cello and more effective in general. Composers such as Villa-Lobos and Martino tailored their work to his cellistic personality, and Parisot sometimes made suggestions having to do with composition along the way. For example, Villa-Lobos in his Second Cello Concerto wrote a slow movement similar to what he had done in his Bachianas. ...This book might be useful to all students of the cello as well as Mr. Parisot's students in particular, as there is much to be learned from Parisot's comments on the history of the cello, and also about the expansion of the cello repertoire and the history of cello ensemble playing in the twenty and twenty-first centuries. It might also be of interest to scholars in the history of string performance and the cello in particular, but it is written in non-technical language and might equally well be read by contemporary aficionados of the cello.\" -Susan Hawkshaw (\"Preface\") This book was originally published in 2018 by Pendragon Press.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nBellofatto, Luigi D.\n\n2011 0-7734-1496-7 536 pages\n\nA biography of Alexander Wheelock Thayer which brings new insight into his study of the life of Beethoven.\n\nPrice: $299.95\n\nMorrow, John A.\n\n2008 0-7734-5119-6 332 pages\n\nThis study explores the indigenous presence in the works of Rubén Darío, one of the most important and influential literary figures in the Spanish-speaking world. The work uncovers indigenous thematic, symbolic, mythological, and stylistic influences in Darío’s poetry, and reveals his deep social concerns along with the duality of his poetic inspiration, both European and Amerindian.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nJohnson, Andre E\n\n2018 1-4955-0657-6 148 pages\n\nVolume 6 continues the series by Dr. Andre Johnson as he recovers the lost voice within African American History of Henry McNeal Turner one of the most prolific writers and speakers during his time. Post-reconstruction in the United States and Turner's election as the bishop in the A.M.E. Church gave him an important platform from which he shared his views. The letters and correspondence cover the period from 1893-1900.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nAnderson, Raymond Kemp\n\n2013 0-7734-4467-X 476 pages\n\nThe first retrospective work of its kind bringing us into direct and personal contact with one of the 20th century’s most discussed and influential thinkers.

Salinger and his work between 1982 and 2016.

Some exist in French, but this writer is only familiar to English readers and scholars through his better-known novels. André Chamson’s place in French literature is assured in France, but his work is not well-known in Britain or in other English-speaking communities, mainly owing to the lack of scholarly criticism and biographical studies in existence in the English language. The works of Chamson have much to offer Anglophone readers, in terms of providing a more detailed and informed picture of France, as a nation and as a collection of regional identities. His substantial historical work (novels, essays, biographies) offers a knowledgeable insight into modern France, particularly since the revolution. One of Chamson’s major concerns was the study of political, religious and social conflict. His works express and illustrate these lifelong interests. Indeed, a number of these issues are still topical; their origins and their development are effectively illuminated by Chamson’s narratives of collective memory. This biography traces the life and times of one of France’s most prominent and active writers in the twentieth century, as well as providing substantial critical analyses of his works. It also features the development of French society in the twentieth century as the context in which André Chamson and his contemporaries (such as Albert Camus, André Gide, Jean Giono, André Malraux, Charles Maurras, Jean-Paul Sartre, and many others) lived and wrote. The biography is intended for students and scholars of French literature, particularly those who are interested in literature, politics, history and political ideology in the twentieth century. It should also appeal to those interested in contemporary literary studies, and to social, cultural, and political historians, as well as to students, scholars, and specialists in the area of the history of ideas.\n\nPrice: $219.95\n\nHerbenick, Raymond M.\n\n1997 0-7734-8542-2 256 pages\n\nThis study first examines ethnographical studies of Carpatho-Rusyns here and abroad with respect to religious and folk art familiar to Warhol; then examines the biographies of Warhol prepared by his close friends and co-workers in regard to his ethnic beliefs, customs, and practices in relation to his art; next it examines the autobiographical and diary evidence by Warhol himself on his ethnic identity concealments and disclosures; finally, it examines nearly four decades of his art.\n\nPrice: $199.95\n\nRosslyn, Wendy\n\n1997 0-7734-8527-9 372 pages\n\nThis is the first extensive study of Bunina's poems and detailed exploration of her life, using archives and numerous periodicals. It describes the cultural expectations which Bunina challenged, her poetic unconventional lyric persona, her strategic choices of poetic language and genre, the reception of her work, and her unprecedented success in living by the pen. It illuminates the pre-history of feminism and the feminine literary tradition in Russian through the reflections on gender and writing of the most radical and gifted of the early women writers.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nMorton, Richard E.\n\n1989 0-88946-563-0 150 pages\n\nA survey of Anne Sexton's poetry from the standpoint of the special statement her poems make, charting the development of that statement by close reading of eight volumes in the order of their publication.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nSmith, Alan G.

All five were very active as intermediaries between Continental and English thought in the Republic of Letters, located in Holland because of that country's encouragement of free inquiry.

First, she applied the scientific method of observation, experiment, hypothesis, and verification to the study of social problems. Second, an outgrowth of the first contribution, she, along with her husband Sidney Webb, turned government into a science in the interest of furthering socialist doctrine to combat social problems. This book will interest scholars in historical sociology, the sociology of knowledge, sociological theory, political sociology, and gender roles.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nFry, C.

That she herself knew Daura well in the last two years of his life has greatly enhanced her authority in this undertaking, as has her ongoing and open relationship with the Daura family. . . . This biography’s inclusion of reproductions of many of Daura’s works is a particular strength . . . . From my perspective, both as a scholar and militarist, the influence of the Spanish Civil War on the arts cannot be overstated. Its role in the personal and artistic development of Pierre Daura is of particular biographical interest, of course, but it also has broader cultural implications that should expand the potential audience for Professor Davis’s study. . . .The author has a readable and inviting style that is delightfully uncharacteristic of too many scholarly biographies. It is a smart read but also a good read.” – William A. McIntosh “I was impressed by the quality of the research and by the clarity and engaging style of the writing. Further I am sure that the samples of Daura’s art chosen to illustrate the book will enhance its value for all readers. Altogether this will make a volume to be treasured by all who appreciate its subject, and it will expand the knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of readers at all levels.” – James A.

It offers interesting commentary on the emergence of the United States as a world power and many diplomatic and international issues of the decades around the turn of the 20th century. It follows Porter from his service as an aid to Grant in the Civil War through his career as Ambassador to France and beyond. “Owens’ topic is a worthy one. Horace Porter seems to be a man of many talents, not the least of which was his great literary flair. A prolific writer, he not only lived a full and exciting life, but he also possessed the inclination and ability to record in on paper. He also, in turn, distinguished himself as a warrior, an emissary, an industrial mogul, and a statesman of many talents. . . . well-written and quite readable. . . will appeal most to serious students of history, and more specifically to scholars interested in the major events of late nineteenth century. I see a real possibility for use in upper-level or graduate courses focused on the Gilded Age. It will also capture the attention of lay readers curious about the various topics presented, ranging from the Civil War to the railroad industry to early twentieth-century diplomacy.” – David Hogan “This book is based largely on research in primary sources, including memoirs and archival records in the United States, Great Britain, and France. Professor Owens’ account demonstrates how biography can provide its lively and moving story, and at the same time throw significant light on broader long term patterns in history. It is good biography, good history, and an enlightening contribution to understanding where we are and how we got here.” – Wayne S.

Lillian and George Willoughby resettled European refugees in the late 1930s, relocated interned Japanese-Americans when World War II broke out, and served as conscientious objectors during the war. They protested nuclear weapons in the 1950s. They promoted integration of the races, preservation of open spaces, and new ways of communal living. They opposed the Vietnam War and participated in peace walks, one of which reached Moscow. Despite the normal stresses on marital and family life, they worked increasingly as a tem, developing nonviolence training workshops, based on Gandhian principles, which they took to India and other countries in Asia. In the new millennium, they have continued their ministries, and engaged in the new social issues: nonviolent peacekeeping in Central America and Sri Lanka, protection of open spaces, and opposition to the violence of the War on Drugs as well as the real war on Iraq.

She was in the center of events during much of the reigns of Henry VIII, Mary I, and Elizabeth I. Niece to Henry VIII, wife to Matthew Stewart, the Early of Lennox and a close claimant of throne of Scotland, she was the mother of Henry, Lord Darnley, the husband of Mary Queen of Scots.

While covering his output from 1959 onwards, the chosen approach is systematic rather than chronological. Shedding light on Kennelly’s poems, novels, and plays from different angles – “History and Politics”, “Spaces/Places: Country, City, Nature”, “Religion and Ethics” as well as “Gender and Sexuality” – Kennelly’s development is traced from his neo-Romanticist beginnings to a critical and highly provocative postmodern stance, above all in the later long poems: Cromwell, The Book of Judas, and Poetry My Arse. While this study is certainly valuable as an introduction for the general reader, combining in-depth analyses of the most important works with general contextual information, the embedding of these analyses within a larger theoretical framework (including deconstruction, postcolonial theory, or gender studies) will also challenge the more experienced Kennellyan. Brendan Kennelly is a painstaking critic of today’s complacencies, inhibitions and violence, a scrupulous analyst of society, and an uncompromising reader of the past who, nevertheless, remains self-critical throughout.\n\nPrice: $259.95\n\nBradley, Peter T.\n\n1999 0-7734-7866-3 628 pages\n\nThis is a single-volume survey of the voyages of English navigators, from the pioneers of the late 15th century to the scientific expeditions of the early 19th, not only in South American waters, but also the Caribbean and North America.

It is heavily annotated with hundreds of footnotes, and completely indexed. Since its first publication in Scotland and England ( in 1727 and 1744, respectively), it has only been republished once, in a limited edition in 1930. It is a fascinating insight into the life of a Scottish seafarer, and an extraordinary history of southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, and other areas. Hamilton was an eye-witness to wars, pirate attacks, scheming English and Asian profiteers, and imprisonment. This edition is taken from the original text of the 1727 edition. Footnotes assist clarification of minor points of history and obsolete terms or names. A Glossary of place names updating Hamilton’s phonetic version to a current nomenclature is given at the end of the text.\n\nPrice: $339.95\n\nFrerer, Lloyd Anton\n\n2001 0-7734-7667-9 364 pages\n\nBetween 1842 and 1908, Bronson Howard wrote 27 plays which appeared under 39 different titles, and had opening nights in New York, London, and Berlin. By the 1890s, Howard was recognized both here and abroad as the Dean of American Dramatists. This study is both historical biography and critical analysis of the literature, concluding with an attempt to place his work in critical perspective both in terms of his own era and ours. In addition to his best-known play, the often-anthologized Civil War spectacle Shenandoah, it examines his other works such as Saratoga, Young Mrs. Winthrop, One of Our Girls, and The Henrietta.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nBradley, Margaret\n\n1998 0-7734-8485-X 452 pages\n\nThis volume tells the story, largely unknown, of a major figure in French engineering and engineering education through the Revolutionary, Napoleonic and Bourbon periods to the first years following the revolution of 1830. Prony is best-known today for creating a massive collection of mathematical tables in the 1790s, the largest ever compiled; and for the dynamometer for measuring the work-rate of waterwheels and related hydraulic machines. He was also a founder-professor of mathematics at the École Polytechnique, and director of the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, exercising much influence on the national body of civil engineers. This volume not only describes Prony's life and work, but presents selections (in French) of the many manuscripts Prony left behind. Prony is an example of the ingénieur savant, the scientist concerned with both teaching and research in engineering issues.\n\nPrice: $279.95\n\nReinhartz, Dennis\n\n1997 0-7734-8604-6 204 pages\n\nWinner of The Adele Mellen Prize for Excellence in Scholarship This is the first book-length study of one of Great Britain's most important and prolific engravers, cartographers and geographers, Herman Moll (1654?-1732), and his work. It puts his life and singular geographies and maps into the historical context of late-17th/early 18th century London at the dawn of the British Empire. It also examines the often-symbiotic interaction of Moll with an exceptional circle of contemporaries: Daniel Defoe, Jonathan Swift, Robert Hooke, John Locke, William Dampier, Woodes Rogers, and William Stukeley. Methodologically and somewhat uniquely for an historical study, this book makes major use of maps and other graphics as sources to reconstruct the history of Moll, his life and times, and friends.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nBurgess, Ruth Vassar\n\n2008 0-7734-5094-7 284 pages\n\nThis narrative biography is unique in that it is written in the postpositive style.

By placing their poetry in its biographical and historical contexts, he demonstrates how four poets with similar social and educational backgrounds responded to the stresses of private life and uneasy times, while remaining continuously aware of each other's work.

Second, it contains unabridged reprints of the seven Foster articles (including the classic Mind trio) which are most concerned with the relations between religion and science. Third, and perhaps most important, it contains a number of responses to Foster by contemporary scholars representing a wide range of academic disciplines and theological persuasions. Stanley Jaki, Francis Oakley and others have contributed lively critiques and further theoretical explorations, stimulated by Foster, concerning nature, creation, science, Christianity, and modernity. This volume is an absolute prerequisite for all further work on Foster. It also makes a vital contribution to the areas of theology, philosophy, and intellectual history, especially regarding the concepts of `creation' and `nature', two notions which have become increasingly important to serious philosophical and religious discourse about the human situation today.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nMacKenzie, Raymond N.\n\n2002 0-7734-7220-7 420 pages\n\nMeynell was in her time widely regarded as one of the generation’s greatest talents.

Jr.\n\n2000 0-7734-7724-1 204 pages\n\nThis is a dramatic record of one man’s service in the Pacific War. “Jack” Wilson began to take notes during training, and these notes developed into a diary of thoughts, movements, and events, especially after he was shipped overseas in January 1943. He served in New Caledonia, Australia, New Guinea, the Admiralty Islands, and the Philippines. Trained to be a baker in the Quartermaster Corps, instead of staying safely in the rear, he volunteered for hazardous duty and baked bread for troops on the front lines. Jack and his platoon saw the grisly residue of battle, and his diary is in part a startling contrast between the decency of his middle-class upbringing and the brutality of war. Another contrast is between tedium and excitement, as routine is interrupted by air raids and prisoners. Extensively annotated by Jack’s son, the diary is both personal and historical.

Bridgman was sent to the port of Canton in southern China in 1830 as a representative of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. One of the small number of Protestant missionaries who arrived in China prior to the Opium War, he played a key role as a pioneering scholar and cultural intermediary, laying the foundations for American sinology and shaping the development of early Sino-American relations. Editor of the world’s first major journal of sinology, The Chinese Repository, Bridgman became America’s first ‘China expert’. Among his other works was the first Chinese language history of the USA, and he also contributed greatly to the formulation of America’s first treaty with the Chinese government.\n\nPrice: $259.95\n\nFahey, David M.\n\n2014 1-4955-0267-8 572 pages\n\nAn informative editing of Edward Lawrence Levy’s (1851-1932) historical autobiography providing fascinating insight into this remarkable man.

His vices -- drinking, womanizing, cursing, duelling, and political corruption, all fully documented -- were all, by the sheer force of his personality, somehow turned to virtues, and even to political advantage. He was certainly the most controversial, but also the most effective, politician of the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Two full chapters and parts of others are dedicated to his preeminent position among England's electioneers. Much of this information is new, gathered with the help of the History of Parliament Trust in London. These chapters represent an important addition to electoral historiography. Finally, Wharton is viewed at close range with other members of England's political great, including William III, Queen Anne, Godolphin, Marlborough, Harley, and the members of the Whig Junto.\n\nPrice: $279.95\n\nChristensen, Richard L.\n\n1995 0-7734-2273-0 244 pages\n\nThis study of controversial biblical scholar Charles Augustus Briggs substantially revises our understanding of Briggs as an important figure in the world of late 19th-century theology. The book demonstrates that he made unique contributions to ecumenism which anticipated much of the present-day ecumenical dialogue.

In 1964, they started the interwoven publication of their fictional works, stressing that neither of them could be understood without reference to the other.

Despite these weighty comparisons and the fact that he was a key inspiration for many later wildlife conservationists and ecologists, Seton has remained a much neglected figure. This lucidly written and well-researched study provides a splendid introduction to the life and work of this “creative genius”, demonstrating the importance of Seton as the naturalist who, at the turn of the twentieth century, was largely responsible for initiating an ecological consciousness and ethic. Instead of focusing on Seton’s personal life, this book presents Seton as a wildlife artist, as a pioneer literary figure who established the realistic animal story, as the apostle of American Indian culture, as well as an influential figure in the founding of the Boy Scouts.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nLicata, Thomas\n\n2008 0-7734-5176-5 416 pages\n\nA revealing look at the artistic and theoretical output of Thomas DeLio whose original compositions, books, and essays are innovative, wide-ranging and wholly provocative.

James Morris was responsible for making the Humane Station the successful social experiment it was, and he is also noteworthy as a member of the Planters of Nova Scotia, the first wave of colonists from New England who settled in Nova Scotia in the mid-eighteenth century. By studying the rhetoric of Planters like Morris, we gain insight on the cultural ethos which Canada and the United States share today.

The author concentrates predominantly on those components of these multi-volume projects that he argues are autobiographically motivated, although he establishes that these texts are not straightforwardly representative of this mode. In its tripartite arrangement, his study investigates the main areas of critical attention relating to the classification of the authors’ works, with particular reference to autobiography. Throughout this investigation, he provides evidence for his contention that for Leiris and Fichte alike, life and writing becomes mutually defining over the protracted progressions of their self-scrutiny. In the first part, he highlights biographical parallels between the authors, and he compares their respective project-conceptions. He then evaluates the efficacy of autobiographical theory in explaining their self-projections beyond their personal experience and towards textual processes of enactment.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nParr, Adrian\n\n2003 0-7734-6564-2 240 pages\n\nThis study explores the work of Leonardo da Vinci with the aim of developing a concept of creative production, It argues that the conditions of a truly creative practice require an imaginative re-working of the real so that new and unforeseen realities can emerge. Studying Leonardo’s notebooks and sketches, where a cross-pollination of theory and practice abounds, it shows that creativity is critical power that operates in between the real and ideal, confounding the clear-cut distinction between them.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nBarrell, Rex A.\n\n1990 0-88946-451-0 96 pages\n\nFrancis Atterbury (1662-1732), Bishop of Rochester and Dean of Westminster, was one of the greatest Churchmen of the latter part of the seventeenth century and the first two decades of the eighteenth. Exiled as a traitor to Europe in 1724, he spent the rest of his life in France and died in Paris. While Atterbury's political correspondence has been edited and published, his literary correspondence has been practically ignored. Much of the latter disappeared during the revolutionary upheavals, but enough remains to form some idea of his literary tastes and critical faculties. This work is an edition of his correspondence with Thieriot (a friend of Voltaire), the Marquis de Caumont, and Charles Rollin. Includes a preface outlining the textual apparatus, an introduction, a biographical sketch, prefaces for Atterbury's correspondents, a bibliography, and an index.\n\nPrice: $99.95\n\nHara, Jacqueline\n\n1997 0-7734-8664-X 172 pages\n\nFrancisco Goya's Letters of Love and Friendship to Martin Zapater establish a connection between Goya's private life and his work.

The letters are translated within the context of their time, and the translator provides biographical data and notes explaining difficult, archaic, or dialectal words and expressions.

This book examines both the nexus of inherited positions informing this cultural recovery, and its original reformulation, through the works of the most prominent intellectual of the Xeración Nós, Ramón Otero Pedrayo (1888 - 1976). Otero was an important figure in Galician intellectual and cultural life over the larger part of the twentieth century, especially when expression of Galician distinctiveness, whether political or cultural, was severely limited and largely discouraged by the Franco regime. He is particularly deserving of an in-depth study, especially since this theme so intrinsically associated with him has not yet been written upon from a perspective of cultural history, and also given his sheer intellectual versatility and position as the leading cultural anthropologist of that generation of Galician writers and thinkers. This work is, therefore, an intellectual history of the cultural activity prevalent in the northwest of Spain - from 1918 to 1936 and beyond - and its interaction with other notions of Spanish identity.\n\nPrice: $259.95\n\nCummings, L.A.\n\n1989 0-7734-0554-2 240 pages\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nDunn, Richard M.\n\n1998 0-7734-8488-4 376 pages\n\nThis is the first full-length biography of writer, architect, esthetician and editor Geoffrey Scott (1884-1929). His Architecture of Humanism was considered the most important statement about architecture since Ruskin and was for years used as a basic text in architectural schools in England and the States, and is still in print. The Portrait of Zelide won the James Tait Memorial Black Prize and is often compared to the best of Lytton Strachey's biographies. When Colonel Ralph Isham brought the famous Boswell papers to the States in the late twenties, he commissioned Scott to edit them. Scott was also a prominent figure in social and intellectual circles in London, Florence and New York. A protegé of Bernard and Mary Berenson, he spent many years living and working at the art historian's famous Villa I Tatti outside Florence (which, in fact, he helped create). Married to the wealthy Lady Sybil Cutting during the War, he had a tempestuous affair with Vita Sackville-West. Edith Wharton, John Maynard Keynes and other Bloomsbury figures were among his friends. This biography focuses particularly on his letters, found in the Villa I Tatti and almost entirely unpublished.\n\nPrice: $239.95\n\nPanton, Clifford D.\n\n2005 0-7734-6207-4 136 pages\n\nThis study is a chronology of the life of the mulatto violin prodigy George Bridgetower from the late eighteenth century to the nineteenth century. We know of Bridgetower through his association with Beethoven and their first performance of the Kreutzer sonata, originally dedicated to Bridgetower in Vienna, 1803. Bridgetower was born 1778 when slavery was on the rampage. The deteriorating image of people of color is examined through art and philosophy beginning with fifteenth century images. In spite of the very negative images present during Bridgetower’s life, he was able to rise to unusual heights in the music world of his day. This study shows how the reality of people of color during the eighteenth century might have helped propel Bridgetower’s career. From his beginning as the “African Prince” to his patronage by the Regent prince of England (later King George IV) and his decline after the death of George IV. His interaction with noted musicians of his day, programs, performance schedules, reviews, and letters relevant to Bridgetower are presented.\n\nPrice: $139.95\n\nBullion, John J.\n\n2012 0-7734-4079-8 584 pages\n\nThe book is a collection of Professor John L. Bullion’s published and unpublished essays on King George III’s impact on the origins and development of the American Revolution. They comprise the most extensive investigation and assessment of George’s relationship to his mother, the Dowager Princess of Wales Augusta, and her enduring influence upon his character and approach to politics. The essays also examine in detail his friendship with the Earl of Bute, both as a young protégé with his mentor and as a king with his minister. They are the most complete and compelling account of George’s early years in his preparation for “the true essential business of a king.” They establish how his development and studies contributed to the imperial crisis and the loss of most of Britain’s North American empire. In addition, Bullion’s careful examination of policy dilemmas reveal the difficulties Britain’s leaders faced. Bute’s central role in the making of peace with the French and Spanish and in planning for Britain’s security, finances, and commerce during the postwar period are covered extensively. These essays fully show how and why the disastrous decisions on colonial policies in the early 1760’s were made. Other chapters shed new light on the king’s reactions to the armed struggle in America during 1775-1783 and the aftermath of defeat. The book closes with a poignant and hitherto unpublished account of the old monarch’s turn away from reform. By illustrating so vividly the mistakes and tragedies of his reign, this book will significantly alter historians’ understanding of George III, his family, his “dearest friend” Bute, and the politicians who acted with America’s last king.\n\nPrice: $319.95\n\nBlaszak, Barbara J.\n\n1989 0-88946-454-5 228 pages\n\nThe only biography detailing Holyoake's contributions to the Cooperative Movement and his connection to the workers' movement.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nField Jr., Lester L.\n\n2015 1-4955-0328-3 792 pages\n\nThis is the first study to tap the deep archival reservoirs of Gerhart Ladner’s personal correspondence in an effort to reveal not only Ladner’s valuable intellectual treasures but also the evolution of his groundbreaking research into the history of reform which led to his seminal work The Idea of Reform.\n\nThis book examines the lifework of Gerhart Ladner (1905-1993).

Born in Switzerland and educated at German universities, as an immigrant scholar he had a distinguished American career as church historian, biblical scholar, apologist of Christianity, and fervent advocate of the reunion of the Christian churches.\n\nThis book offers for the first time a scholarly exploration of Philip Schaff’s German years of education, for, as the book demonstrates, only a thorough understanding of Schaff’s formative years will enable us to do full justice to his distinguished American career. His German education largely shaped his American career.\n\nWith its broad compass and with its focus on outstanding personalities and theological positions in nineteenth-century German Protestantism, this study therefore contributes to the ongoing scholarly discussion both of a significant figure in nineteenth century American Christianity and of German Protestantism in the nineteenth century’s first half, as it contributes to the important field of immigration studies. An extensive bibliography of relevant German literature is another contribution to scholarship by this book.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nFreeman, Robert\n\n2023 1-4955-1086-7 282 pages\n\n\"Gil's devotion to the music of our own time has been legion, making him the champion of three generations of living composers.

Using personal writing as their primary child rearing tool. the Alcotts promoted what literary historian Richard Brodhead terms \"disciplinary intimacy\" as a means of instructing youngsters in proper behavior and parentaly sanctioned values. This study, which draws extensively on primary source materials, including family letters and journals, focuses on the potent relationship between literacy, maternal authority, and discipline in the private and public spaces of the Alcott home and Bronson's grammar school classrooms.

The focus is on a selection of Morris’ writings and situates them in the fields of art, culture, and society. Through Roland Barthes’ approach to interpreting text, Sasso demonstrates that Tennyson, Swinburne, Gissing, and Yeats were all readers of Morris’ work which in turn stimulated their own writing and infused them with desire. Shows how Morris’ influence caused his contemporaries to emulate his style of writing and how that style ultimately framed the mind of Victorian England.\n\nPrice: $179.95\n\nOblas, Peter B.\n\n2009 0-7734-4660-5 256 pages\n\nThe writings of Hugh Byas, journalist and japanologist, developed while he was editor of the Japan Advertiser and later as correspondent of the London Times and New York Times.

It explores the Life of Bishop Wilfrid, an eighth-century account of a famous Anglo-Saxon abbot and bishop of Hexham, with an eye to exposing and analyzing the convictions of Wilfrid's biographer. Argues that the portrayal of Wilfrid's seemingly abrasive brand of sanctity approximates more closely the New Testament image of the holy man than other early English portrayals, especially the first portrayal of St. Cuthbert.\n\nPrice: $159.95\n\nPeden, W.

Presents a historiography of the queen from her own time to the present. Many illustrations. \"With the trend of films and television to nowadays twist ‘History' to fit the drama , we now have a benchmark to judge past and future efforts. My congratulations go to the author who has persevered in finding the facts from hidden records, so many others of which have, regrettably, been lost over the intervening centuries. She has then assembled them into a very readable and lively account which I commend.\" – from the Foreword by His Grace, the Duke of Somerset (descendent of the Seymour family) \". . . a treatise which reflects the result of superb scholarship and difficult historical research. . . . Its subject has hitherto been almost invisible in serious literature because her life was inaccessible to straightforward historical research techniques. . . . Professor Gross has spent years slowly removing the shroud of anonymity surrounding Seymour. The result is an important scholarly work that traces the personal impact of Jane Seymour as well as the influence of the Seymour lineage exerted in the future of the monarchy. . . . the reader will be treated to solid research and delightful writing. From the hallmark quote setting the stage for each chapter to the commendable research that reveals for the first time an important, but previously obscure, historical figure, Jane the Quene is worthy of the close attention of serious scholars..\" – J.
