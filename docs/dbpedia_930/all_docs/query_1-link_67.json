        "text": "British number three Katie Boulter says she \"put her heart out there\" to claim her first Grand Slam match win and reach the second round at Wimbledon.\n\nThe in-form 21-year-old, who has climbed to 122nd in the world, beat Veronica Cepede Royg 6-4 5-7 6-4.\n\nShe joins Johanna Konta, Kyle Edmund and Katie Swan as the British interests in the second round.\n\nBritish teenager Jay Clarke fell agonisingly short on his Grand Slam debut in the men's draw.\n\nThe wildcard lost in five sets to former world number 10 Ernests Gulbis of Latvia, going down 4-6 6-3 7-6 (7-3) 3-6 6-4 in three hours 16 minutes.\n\nNaomi Broady lost 6-2 7-5 to defending champion Garbine Muguruza on Centre Court, while Gabriella Taylor fell 6-0 4-6 6-3 to 2014 runner-up Eugenie Bouchard.\n\nKaty Dunne saved two set points before falling 6-3 7-6 (7-5) to Jelena Ostapenko, while Heather Watson lost 6-4 7-5 to Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium.\n\nBoulter, who was ranked in the world's top 10 as a junior, has climbed up the senior rankings after an impressive year.\n\nShe has won two ITF tournaments - the tier below the main WTA tour - and beat former US Open champion Sam Stosur at Nottingham last month.\n\nSo it meant she would have been confident of beating Paraguayan world number 123, who has never won a main-draw match at Wimbledon.\n\nBoulter hit 11 winners and four aces to just four unforced errors in a tidy first set, before breaking again early in the second.\n\nA missed match point at 5-4 through a loose forehand allowed Cepede Royg to recover and force a decider.\n\nBut Boulter broke at a crucial time for a 5-4 lead, securing victory with a deft touch on her second match point.\n\n\"I just put my heart out there and luckily I got the win,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\n\"One thing about me is I will never give in. Whatever the score, I will be working hard.\"\n\nShe will now face rising star and Indian Wells champion Naomi Osaka of Japan.\n\nClarke has travelled as part of the Great Britain Davis Cup team in the past, as well as practising with Andy Murray before Grand Slams.\n\nGulbis, a 2014 French Open semi-finalist, was far more experienced - but for the most part, Clarke produced the more mature performance.\n\nGulbis was erratic, hitting 53 winners and 43 unforced errors, while the British teenager showed off his impressive athleticism and mental attitude in forcing a decider after losing a third-set tie-break.\n\nClarke looked the better player in the fifth set but his first serve faltered at 4-4 and Gulbis earned the crucial break before going on to complete the victory in the following game.\n\nDespite an encouraging performance, the British number five said it would take a few days for him to see the positives from the defeat.\n\n\"I'm not happy at all. I'm very sad with how it ended,\" added the wildcard.\n\n\"He's been 10 in the world, reached semis in Slams and had a couple of good wins here so there will be a lot of positives to take, but they are tough to see right now.\""
