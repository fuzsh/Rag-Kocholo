        "text": "Younger sons of the gentry occupied a precarious and unstable position in society. They were born into wealthy and privileged families yet, within the system of primogeniture, were required to make their own way in the world. As elite men their status rested on independence and patriarchal authority, attaining anything less could be deemed a failure. This article explores the way that these pressures on younger sons emerged, at a crucial point in the process of early adulthood, as anxiety on their part and on the part of their families. Using the correspondence of 11 English gentry families across this period we explore the emotion of anxiety in this context: the way that it revealed ‘anxious masculinities’; the way anxiety was traded within an emotional economy; the uses that anxiety was put to . We argue that anxiety was an important emotion within the gentry community and that the expression of anxiety persisted amongst younger sons and their guardians across this period. To be published in Historical Journal 2019\n\nAccessioned by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1941, an early eighteenth-century sleeved waistcoat of silk and metallic damask and brocaded satin is a rare survivor. In cut and construction, this visually striking garment trimmed with gold metallic braid and lined with taffeta and linen dates to about 1720. It would have been worn as part of a relatively new form of male dress, the three-piece suit. Extraordinary in its own right as a splendid example of textile design and historic fashion, the waistcoat does not appear to have undergone any later alteration, as is often the case with such early examples of eighteenth-century clothing. Its bold, exotic design, consisting of multicolor floral, foliate and abstract brocaded motifs, adorns both the front and back panels as well as the cuffs of the sleeves. The waistcoat was acquired with a known provenance identifying its original owner, Ebenezer Storer, Sr., a Boston merchant born in Maine in 1699. In this paper, I treat Storer’s waistcoat as a foil for exploring the trans-Atlantic influence and circulation of European fashion in colonial New England, focusing specifically on Boston in the period spanning the 1680s through the 1730s. Critical consideration of these factors will be used to interpret the motivations for and consequences of owning such a garment during an important period of transition in New England’s colonial history. Storer’s waistcoat might well be cast as emblematic of this paradigm in its own right. Informed by European tastes and the likely product of the British silk industry in and around London, the waistcoat was worn and refashioned within the context of both an evolving spiritual tradition and a developing mercantile elite on the fringes of the British Atlantic world. The cosmopolitan nature of Boston’s merchant community and its conscious self-fashioning marked a significant departure from orthodox Puritan doctrine and theology. These differing perspectives and aspirations converged in New England, with changing opinions on dress helping to give rise to a new social order and civil society at the turn of the eighteenth century.\n\nPublisher's summary The English economy underwent profound changes in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, yet the worldly affairs of ordinary people continued to be shaped as much by traditional ideals and moral codes as by material conditions. This book explores the economic implications of many of the era’s key concepts, including Christian stewardship, divine providence, patriarchal power, paternal duty, local community, and collective identity. Brodie Waddell draws on a wide range of contemporary sources – from ballads and pamphlets to pauper petitions and guild regulations – to show that such ideas pervaded every aspect of social and economic relations during this crucial period. As a result, the book reveals the inadequacy of many previous discussions of English economic life, which have tended to ignore or dismiss the influence of cultural factors. Indeed, Waddell argues that popular beliefs about divine will, social duty and communal bonds remained the frame through which most people viewed vital ‘earthly’ concerns such as food marketing, labour relations, trade policy, poor relief, and many others. Ultimately, he demonstrates both the vibrancy and the diversity of the ‘moral economies’ of the period. This analysis of later Stuart economic culture can thus contribute significantly to our understanding of early modern society.\n\nHistorians of eighteenth-century Britain have used toasting as evidence of the construction of socio-political allegiances and signs of dynastic, religious political divides. This presentation examines the construction of toasting norms within the paradigm of politeness, ascendant in the early part of the century and culminating in the ideal of the \"polite gentleman\", which may be understood as a model of hegemonic masculinity. Toasting, a ritual of male bonding, strengthened homosocial groups and included some males at the expense of other males and all women. Secondly, this paper explores the dimension of competitiveness and aggression always lurking below the veneer of polite masculinity. Toasting rituals served to channel violence into socially acceptable forms and can be seen as substitutes for duelling or brawling. The third moment of this paper qualifies claims about women's exclusion, showing they could engage in toasting, in domestic settings but also in some public contexts, especially from the end of the century. Femininity was also increasingly seen as a moderating, civilizing form that would restrain the excesses of all-male drinking.\n\nThis MA History thesis examines the life of William Byrd II (1674-1744), Virginian landowner and founder of Richmond. Despite extensive comparisons with Thomas Jefferson, Byrd preceded the revolutionary generation of self-defined ‘Americans’. This has become increasingly evident as the historiography of gender in the early modern Atlantic has exploded in the last ten to twenty years. However, few of its ideas and frameworks have ever been applied to the extensive ‘ego-document’ sources left behind by Byrd. The most recent analyses are biographical overviews of his diaries and correspondence date back to the late 1980s. Byrd is now a more accessible historical figure than ever, with many more of his primary sources digitised and published in edited collections. This thesis explores Byrd’s experience of gender in the early modern Atlantic and, more specifically, explores how his masculinity was ‘transatlantic’. Using a microhistorical approach, I will situate Byrd at the center of a distinct gender dynamic: ‘transatlantic masculinity’. The Atlantic ocean itself helped to configure Byrd’s identity, shaping the socio-economic environment of port cities where Byrd lived (London and Westover). Furthermore, the ocean created destabilising tensions, separating Byrd’s life into metropolitan and colonial halves which he struggled to navigate between. This resulted in Byrd developing a maritime mentality, and his masculine identity developing distinctly from English norms. He blended European forms of masculinity and genteel learning with colonial subjects: his aging mirrored the economic and demographic explosion of Virginia. Overall, this thesis is intended to analyse Byrd’s masculinity in the light of new frameworks and methods, as an example of time- and place-specific ‘transatlantic masculinity’."
