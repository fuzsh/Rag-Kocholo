The history of the last name Boulter

The surname Boulter has its origins in England, specifically in the counties of Hampshire and Berkshire, where it first appeared in the 13th century. The name derives from the Old English word "bultere," which referred to a miller or a person who sifted flour using a bolting cloth.

In medieval England, the milling of grain was a crucial industry, and those involved in this trade often took on surnames related to their occupation. The earliest recorded instance of the name Boulter dates back to 1275, when a Richard le Bultere was mentioned in the Hundred Rolls of Oxfordshire.

The Boulter name is also found in early tax records and parish registers, such as the Subsidy Rolls of 1332, where a John Boulter is listed in Sussex. In the 16th century, the name appeared in various spellings, including Bolter, Boulter, and Boultoure, reflecting the regional variations in pronunciation and spelling at the time.

One notable historical figure bearing the Boulter surname was Sir Edmund Boulter (1640-1728), an English merchant and Member of Parliament. He served as the Sheriff of London in 1707 and was knighted in 1714 for his services to the Crown.

Another prominent individual was Hugh Boulter (1672-1742), an Anglican priest who became the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland in 1724. He played a significant role in the ecclesiastical affairs of Ireland during the 18th century.

In the realm of literature, Matthew Boulter (1579-1629) was an English poet and clergyman who authored several works, including "Monumenta Pietatis et Literaria" and "The Poets Panegerick."

The name Boulter also has connections to place names, such as Boulter's Lock on the River Thames in Berkshire, named after a local miller or lock-keeper with the surname Boulter.

John Boulter (1768-1843) was a notable English engineer and inventor who patented several improvements in the design and construction of watermills and windmills, further strengthening the connection between the Boulter name and the milling trade.
