        "text": "This review was corrected on March 26, 2003\n\nMaking a movie without really knowing what it’s going to be about is not generally advisable, but Maija DiGiorgio’s “Bitter Jester” makes that process quite entertaining. After 91 minutes you may not even notice — or care — that docu has neither investigated the causes for DiGiorgio’s professional crackup (pic’s starting point) nor really answered any questions about the business of doing comedy (as it promises en route). Presence of numerous name “special appearances” will make this lively, oddball package a solid cable attraction; theatrical prospects are iffier.\n\nAs glimpsed in initial parade of TV clips, DiGiorgio was well on her way up the stand-up comedy ladder when she got herself blacklisted (or so she claims) by throwing an audience-abusive tantrum before industry bigwigs at the Aspen Comedy Festival. (In excerpt shown, however, aud seems to think she’s kidding, and laughs accordingly.)\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nSuddenly career-stalled, DiGiorgio consults a shrink who suggests she make a video-diary. But rather than examine the cause of her breakdown, DiGiorgio tows the camera around to professional environs she’s no longer welcome at — including one NYC club that’s off-limits while Jerry Seinfeld is filming his own documentary (last year’s “Comedian”) there.\n\nEx-boxer/celebrity bodyguard and current boyfriend Kenny Simmons, something of a loose cannon himself, commandeers DiGiorgio’s project and turns it into an endless quest for star-comedian interviews. Simmons already has a valuable pal in stand-up lifer Richard Belzer, who signs on as exec producer and opens many doors for the filmmakers.\n\nMaija, Kenny and lenser Jody Del Giorno then spend months crisscrossing the U.S. and Canada chasing down in-person wisdoms from the famously funny, many glimpsed in eye-blink fashion. Chevy Chase offers a bleak reality-check when he attributes 99.9% of show biz success to “blind luck, no more or less.”\n\nWhoopi Goldberg advises DiGiorgio to follow her own muse, or sell out — but don’t expect to pull off both; Richard Pryor’s latest ex-wife/caregiver holds forth while he, sadly, tries and fails to speak from his wheelchair, and Phyllis Diller hits a nerve when she tells the ever-whining Maija, “I feel empathy for people like you who are young and beautiful–it’s much more difficult for you to find things to bitch about.” A lot of good questions arise from protag’s own persona, not to mention several other struggling comics who bitterly resent those who’ve “made it.” (They all hate Seinfeld.) But while considerable dysfunctional behavior is observed here — much of it the filmmaking trio’s own, pitilessly exposed by DiGiorgio’s manic, clever editing –those issues are never directly addressed. Ultimately, we don’t know just what she’s learned. (We haven’t even seen enough of her routines to gauge why her talent got her this far.)\n\nIt’s hard to tell just how much unvarnished truth “Bitter Jester” really offers, especially given mysterious screen credits for “story” (DiGiorgio, Simmons, David Burton Levin) and “narrative” (DiGiorgio, Levin, Adam Greenbaum). Perhaps the one sure lesson is that when comics “reveal” themselves, it’s likely to be just another performing mask.\n\nOn the considerable upside, however, “Jester” is often hilarious and always diverting. Whole package is a resourceful font of ideas, with no end of visual/editorial gambits (including split screen images) and witty soundtracked music choices. DiGiorgio may fret that “Maybe comedy isn’t the thing I should be pursuing.” Regardless, she definitely has a future as a filmmaker."
