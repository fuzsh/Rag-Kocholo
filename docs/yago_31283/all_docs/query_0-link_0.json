        "meta_description": "Bitter Jester: Directed by Maija DiGiorgio. With Maija DiGiorgio, Kenneth Simmons, Richard Belzer, George Carlin. BITTER JESTER is the first documentary to give us a glimpse into the real process behind the comedy we watch in clubs, on television and at the movies. Through the eyes of comedienne Maija DiGiorgio, we take a guided tour of the comedy business at its rawest. Behind the jokes and smiles, Maija reveals what really goes on in the minds of so many comedians. She allows us to witness a side of stand-up comedy we rarely see, from young comics unable to get stage time to comedy superstars musing on their own failures. Over the course of nearly two years, Maija documents her own roller coaster career in stand-up comedy and searches for the answers we all seek. This extraordinarily bizarre and entertaining journey takes her back and forth across the country several times as she seeks the insight and wisdom of fellow comics. Original, spontaneous and incredibly funny, BITTER JESTER is a unique glimpse into the soft underbelly of stand-up comedy and the personalities who inhabit it. It is a story of struggle, self doubt, and the emotional pain from which humor is born and the powerful role it plays uplifting us and keeping us sane.",

        "text": "I don't know if this documentary is available anywhere, but this film Does have elements worth checking out and seeing, especially if you are Prepared for the great film making and the overpowering of laughter. I Agree with the excellent review, and details that have been said by all. This is a fascinating film I also think director Maija Di Giorgio is to be commended for working well with limited resources, especially the Great experience she has. Given more of the latter, I believe she has Become an excellent film maker and will go a long way it the film Making industry. Richard Pryor in all his decimated glory, but truly the film spends too much time dealing with him, his ego, and his exploits. Inspiring if a little flawed, Bitter Jester is a film you must see if you are an aspiring comedian, an artist, or just a caring, feeling human being. Bitter Jester ostensibly delves into the highs and lows of struggling along the comedy circuit. Beautiful and outrageously talented Maija experiences a crisis of conscience and seeks to find center again by making a documentary of her youth, parents, rise on the comedy scene, implosion on said scene, psychotherapy, meeting her homicidal boyfriend, using his contacts to talk to other comedians about their experiences, feuding with Jerry Seinfeld, cross country trips, But amidst the clutter, there is a beautiful film in here."
