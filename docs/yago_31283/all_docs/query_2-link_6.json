        "text": "Graham is best known for originating the role of Herbert West in Stuart Gordon's stage adaptation of his seminal film, Re-Animator the Musical. First performed in 2011 at The Steve Allen Theater in Los Angeles, the stage production won several awards including the LA Weekly award for Best Musical. Bob Verini, a critic for Variety, wrote \"not since “Little Shop of Horrors” has a screamfest tuner so deftly balanced seriousness and camp.\"\n\nThe production appeared at the New York Musical Theatre Festival in July, 2012 and made its international debut at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August, 2012.\n\nGraham has a decade of experience working in all aspects of the independent film industry: acting, directing, producing, writing, and editing. He also owns and operates the Rated R Speakeasy horror-themed pop-up bar based out of Glendale, CA. Rated R Speakeasy has quickly established itself as a premiere destination for horror fans and filmmakers looking to unwind. Opening for one-or-two night events every month, it has horror music, horror films on the big screen, a horror art gallery, horror video arcade, aerial acrobat bartenders, roaming monsters, a full bar, and food. Essentially, it’s a fully immersive bar / haunt experience!"
