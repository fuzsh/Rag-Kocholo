        "text": "You’ve seen her on HBO, Showtime & more!\n\nMaija DiGiorgio is a comedian, filmmaker, and NY-to-LA transplant. In her first year doing stand- up, Maija took the comedy world by storm taping five national TV appearances, receiving a standing ovation at NBC’s Live from the Apollo, and performing at the HBO Aspen Comedy Festival. Her hour show IncogNegro was part of the summer series at the prestigious Here theater in SOHO. Maija’s Dry Bar Special “Maija Pinion” is available now with several of the clips reaching over 1 million views. She is in the process of recording her first comedy album with 800 PoundGorilla Records.\n\nSince her impressive start in comedy, Maija has taken her talents to countless prestigious venues worldwide—including the Beacon Theater, the New Orleans Essence Festival, and Scotland’s Edinburgh Festival—as well as TV performances across most major networks—including HBO’s Def Comedy Jam, NBC’s comics unleashed, Fox’s Laughs, Uncontrolled Comedy Hour, Bet’s Comic View, and Showtime’s Michael Vick Comedy Explosion. Through her work, she has had the opportunity to perform alongside many industry standouts—including Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart, Bill Burr, Dane Cook, Wanda Sykes, Louis CK, Mike Epps, and Tracy Morgan. Maija has been described as “Fantastic” by Dave Chappelle and been referred to as “A f**king star!” by Bill Burr."
