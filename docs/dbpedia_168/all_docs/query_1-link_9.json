GUTIERREZ! anp CHRISTOPHER Z. WOMERSLEY Department of Zoology, Edmondson Hall 152, University of Hawai’i at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, USA Abstract. The roles played by eyes, cephalic tentacles, and dermal receptors in the shadow responses of the Hawaiian black nerite gastropod, Nerita picea, were tested. Snails exhibited withdrawal responses when exposed to a passing shadow. Shadow responses involved a contraction of both cephalic tentacles and partial to full retreat of the snout or whole body into the shell. Removal of the cephalic tentacles or differentiated eyes did not impair the intensity of response to passing shadows. Withdrawal responses to passing shadows at very low light levels (1.1—320 lux) in blind and/or ablated snails demonstrated the maintenance of acute photoreceptivity. The observations presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that dermal photoreceptors are primarily responsible for the occurrence of shadow responses in N. picea. INTRODUCTION For the vast majority of animals, light is a distinctive stimulus that conveys, via sensory structures, useful in- formation about the environment. In invertebrates, a wide range of specialized light receptors, which include com- pound eyes, ocelli, single-lens eyes, and simple eyes in the form of pigment cups and pinhole eyes, have evolved to facilitate light detection (Dusenbery, 1992). However, many marine invertebrates also show responses to light that are not mediated by any structurally known receptors. These responses are referred to as extraocular or dermal sensitivity to light. Dermal sensitivity to light has been observed in tubiculous polychaetes (Nicol, 1950), crus- taceans (Larimer, 1966), echinoderms (Millot, 1954; Yoshida & Ohtsuki, 1966), and gastropods (Millot, 1968). Dermal photosensitivity in mollusks usually involves withdrawal responses that are mediated via sensitivity in the siphon, e.g., Mya arenaria (Light, 1930); the anterior edge of the mantle, e.g., Helix (Foh, 1932); or both the mantle edge and siphon, e.g., Nassarius reticulatus (Crisp, 1972). Many other gastropods also exhibit shadow responses that are mediated through dermal photorecep- tors rather than differentiated eyes (Franz, 1921; Foéh, 1932), leading Land (1984) to argue that defense respons- es of most mollusks to shadow stimuli are mediated through dermal photoreceptors. Preliminary observations by one of us (LMG) sug- gested that the Hawaiian black nerite, Nerita picea (Ré- cluz, 1841) (Gastropoda: Neritidae), a ubiquitous snail in the rocky intertidal of the Hawaiian Islands, responds to passing shadows by withdrawing into its shell. The pre- ' Corresponding author: telephone (808) 956-8617; fax (808) 956-9822; e-mail: guterrez @zoology.hawaii.edu sent study was designed to test the importance of dermal photoreceptors in the defense responses of N. picea to shadow stimuli. The possible role(s) played by eyes and/ or cephalic tentacles in shadow responses was also as- sessed by using blinded snails and snails with ablated tentacles. Blinding and ablation experiments were felt necessary for a number of reasons: (1) A previous study (LMG, unpublished results) demonstrated that both neg- ative phototaxis and vision are important in the accurate coastward orientation of N. picea, suggesting that nega- tive photo-tactic responses, and consequently, shadow re- sponses, might be visually mediated; (2) the eyes of most invertebrates possess pigment-bearing cells that are close- ly associated with photoreceptive cells (Goldsmith, 1972) and thus might be partially involved in shadow responses; (3) a common viewpoint has maintained that eyes might be the only photosensitive structures present in some snails; (4) it is known that the cephalic tentacles of other gastropods have a high degree of tactile sensitivity and may possess photosensitive abilities as well (Charles, 1966). The research we present here demonstrates that defense responses to shadow stimuli in N. picea are not mediated by either eyes or cephalic tentacles, but appear to be primarily controlled via dermal receptors that are associated with the pigmented surface areas of the snail’s body. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental Animals Nerita picea (Figure 1) has a globose shell with a low spire and an elliptical aperture. It has a broad snout with slightly thick lateral processes. Fully retractable cephalic tentacles are located on each side of the snout and the eye-stalks with apical eyes located on the outer side of Page 2 & ape Ly ‘ V.fs. t Ne g ah ~ mtp. 3) ie Figure 1 Ink illustration of Nerita picea.

M. Gutiérrez. these. The coloration of the animals is pale gray, with black pigmentation on the upper surface of the snout, the sides of the foot, the mantle edge, and in males, the ce- phalic penis. This pigmentation occurs in highly concen- trated flecks that form horizontal black bands, or “‘tiger striping” (Figure 1). The cephalic tentacles carry long longitudinal black lines on the upper surface, but these fade toward the underside. The apical regions of the eye- stalk have a high concentration of pigmentation, which is not set in any distinct pattern. The sole of the foot is unpigmented. The snail carries the operculum on the pos- terior foot lobe (metapodium). When crawling, N. picea exposes part of its snout, both cephalic tentacles, and the eyes (not eye-stalks) at the edge of the shell. Specimens of adult N. picea (n = 4264) were collected during morning low tides from two intertidal rocky shores, Sandy Beach and Pupukea, located on opposite sides on the island of O’ahu. The two sites were chosen to allow comparison of shadow responses by two differ- ent populations of snails from different substrates and ex- The Veliger, Vol. 44, No. 1 posure. Sandy Beach is primarily composed of black vol- canic boulders that are highly exposed to surf action. Conversely, Pupukea is mainly a limestone rocky shore with volcanic boulders dispersed throughout and is more sheltered from the effects of surf action due to the pres- ence of a limestone bench offshore. The geomorphology of these two beaches has been discussed elsewhere (Wentworth, 1938, 1939). Snails were maintained in glass aquaria with running seawater and provided with a 12light: 12dark cycle. Mean shell measurements for Sandy Beach and Pupukea snails were 12.11 mm (length), 9.7 mm (width), 6.57 mm (height); and 15.77 mm (length), 10.478 mm (width), and 7.457 mm (height), respectively. Individual sets of snails collected from both these sites were subjected to two series of experiments described below. Shadow Response of Normal Snails Three tests were devised to determine the shadow re- sponses of various parts of the body: (1) “Crawling.” In this position, snails exposed part of the snout, both ce- phalic tentacles, and the eyes at the edge of the shell, in addition to the anterior and lateral portions of the foot, i.e., maximal pigmentation exposure; (2) “Sole of Foot.” Snails were turned upside down and allowed to emerge from the shell until the sole of the foot was maximally extended. In this position, the foot almost covered the entire shell, and no anterior, lateral, or posterior foot lobes were visible, i.e., minimal or no pigmentation exposure; (3) ‘““Metapodium.” Snails were turned upside down and allowed to retreat into their shells. Testing occurred when the snail emerged from the shell at a point when only the metapodium, to which the operculum is attached and car- ried, was visible, i.e., partial pigmentation exposure. Representative individuals of both snail populations were placed in one of the above test positions and ex- posed to a shadow stimulus by passing a square black card (8 X 8 cm) through a light source, decreasing the illumination from an initial light level of 1.1-1400 to 0 lux. The stimulus period lasted approximately 1 second. A light source (100 watts) was located 0.75 m above the experimental animals inside a completely enclosed 2 X 1 x 1 m matte black box ensuring uniform illumination. Temperature effects of the light source on experimental subjects were nil. Light intensities, representing a grada- tion from full moon (1.1 lux) to dusk or dawn (1400 lux), were controlled via a previously calibrated dimmer and measured with a GE light meter (Model No. 27A). Shad- ow responses of individual snails were observed at six different light intensities (1.1, 110, 320, 540, 750, and 1400 lux). All experiments were conducted in a dark room at night to avoid interference from ambient light, and the observer wore black to negate reflection from clothing. A snail’s reaction to a passing shadow was scored as L. M. Gutiérrez & C. Z. Womersley, 2001 either “‘response”’ or “‘no response.”’ A simultaneous con- traction of both tentacles and/or snails retreating into the shell constituted a positive response. All other behaviors were scored as ‘“‘no response.”’ Because of the rapid ha- bituation of snails to sequentially repeated shadow stimuli (LMG, unpublished observations), individual snails were only tested once. Shadow Response of Blinded and Ablated Snails To discern whether the eyes or cephalic tentacles me- diated shadow responses, snails of both populations were anesthetized for 15 min in 7.5% MgCl, and either (1) the cephalic tentacles or (2) the eyes and the eye-stalks re- moved with iridectomy dissecting micro-scissors. Surgi- cally treated animals were allowed to recover for 24—48 hr before being exposed to shadow stimuli in one of the three test positions in an identical manner to that de- scribed for normal snails. Control experiments used snails previously anesthetized that had an incision in the basal area of the eye and tentacles. Statistical Analysis Chi-square tests were conducted to assess the signifi- cance of the difference in shadow responses by snails exposed to shadow stimuli in each of the three test po- sitions. Shadow responses with probabilities less than 0.05 indicated that a response was dependent on the body area being tested. RESULTS Nerita picea displayed two common responses to passing shadows. First, when crawling, there was either (a) a si- multaneous contraction of both cephalic tentacles, or (b) contraction of cephalic tentacles coupled with a partial to full retreat of the snout or whole body into the shell. Second, when turned upside down, snails only exhibited a partial or full retreat into the shell; cephalic tentacles were retracted in the shell in blind and normal snails. Interestingly, as snails turned over and made contact with the substratum, shadow stimulation did not arouse a with- drawal response, and turning continued until the snail was in the upright position. Type of habitat, volcanic versus limestone, did not affect the shadow responses of snails (Table 1), as shadow responses did not vary between snail populations from Pupukea or Sandy Beach. Thus, the data presented represents a pooling of both populations. Shadow Response of Normal Snails Nerita picea demonstrated withdrawal responses to a passing shadow, and both body position and light inten- sity affected the intensity of response (Figure 2a, Table 2). “Crawling”? and ‘‘metapodium”’ snails exhibited a positive dependence on light intensity with respect to the number of shadow responses (Crawling, x*: 64.75, n = Page 3 Table 1 Chi-Square test results assessing whether degree of re- sponses to shadow stimuli by N. picea is independent of beach of origin.

At low light intensities (1.1—540 lux), ‘“‘metapodium” snails showed reduced responses com- pared to ‘‘crawling”’ snails, but at higher light levels (750 and 1400 lux), showed a similar number of responses (Figure 2a, Table 2). Conversely, the responses of “sole of foot’’ snails were highly reduced at all light intensities and therefore not dependent on light intensity (x7: 10.923, n = 396, P > 0.05) (Figure 2a). Shadow Responses of Blind and Ablated Snails Both blind and ablated snails exhibited positive shadow responses that were dependent on light intensity in all three test positions (Figures 2b, c, Table 3). Blinded Snails. Blind ‘“‘crawling”’ snails exhibited more positive responses than blind “‘sole of foot’’ snails at all light intensities (Figure 2b). “Crawling”? and ‘“‘metapo- dium” snails showed similar responses at most light in- tensities, but at 110 and 540 lux, more “‘metapodium”’ snails failed to respond to a passing shadow. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the negative shadow response of “‘sole of foot’? and ‘‘metapodium”’ snails. Ablated Tentacle Snails. Ablated “‘crawling”’ snails be- haved similarly to ‘“‘metapodium”’ snails at most light in- tensities (Figure 2c). More “‘sole of foot’’ snails failed to respond to a shadow than “‘crawling”’ or “‘metapodium”’ snails at most light intensities (320—1400 lux). At 110 lux, “‘metapodium”’ and “‘sole of foot’ snails behaved similarly, showing more negative responses to shadow stimuli. Irrespective of test position, the majority of ab- lated tentacle snails failed to respond at low light levels (1.1. Tux). Comparison of responses between ablated/blind, nor- mal/blind, and normal/ablated snails is presented in Table 4. With the exception of lower light intensities (1.1 and 320 lux) where more “crawling” blind snails showed positive responses to shadow (Table 4a), no differences were observed in the shadow responses of blind and ab- lated snails in the three test positions.

At lower light inten- sities (110 lux), more ‘“‘crawling”’ blind snails and less ‘““metapodium”’ blind snails responded positively when compared to normal snails. In comparison to normal “sole of foot” snails, blind “‘sole of foot’? snails showed more negative responses at most light intensities (320, 750, and 1400 lux). Shadow responses of blind “sole of foot” snails increased with increasing light intensity (Fig- ure 2b). With the exception of low light levels (1.1 and 110 lux), shadow responses of normal and ablated snails in the “‘crawling”’ position were not significantly different (Table 4c). Unlike normal snails, more ‘“‘metapodium”’ ablated snails failed to respond to a passing shadow at 110, 320, and 540 lux. The shadow responses of “‘me- tapodium” ablated snails increased with increasing light intensity (Figure 2c). DISCUSSION In the present study, N. picea from two different habitats (Sandy Beach and Pupukea) exhibited similar withdrawal responses to passing shadows. Shadow responses showed little impairment when differentiated eyes and eye-stalks Table 3 Chi-Square test results assessing independence of shadow responses to light intensity of blind and ablated snails.

These results are entirely consistent with the observation that many molluscan re- sponses to light are based on dermal receptors (Land, 1968). For example, the reactions of N. reticulatus to shadow were not affected by eye removal (Crisp, 1972), and shadow crossing the cephalic tentacles of Helix elic- ited no response, but the animal fully withdrew when shadow crossed the mantle near the base of the shell (Foh, 1932). Snail posture studies (Figure 2) suggest that the dermal receptors involved are closely associated with the dark pigmentation, “tiger striping,” of the foot (Figure 1). Consequently, snails in the “‘crawling”’ position which had more pigmented body areas exposed, i.e., snout, an- terior, posterior, and lateral foot lobes, eyes and/or ten- tacles, if present, were generally more responsive to light irrespective of experimental treatment (Table 2). Con- versely, the ““metapodium”’ position, which only allowed snails to expose the highly pigmented posterior part of the metapodium, and “‘sole of foot’? snails, which ex- posed only the unpigmented ventral foot surface, were less responsive to shadows. Thus, like the black garden slug Arion ater, in which the amount of porphyrin present (known to cause photosensitivity) is directly proportional to the amount of dark pigment in the integument (Ken- nedy, 1959), the amount of dermal pigmentation in N. picea would appear to be directly proportional to dermal photosensitivity. The importance of the dermal photosen- sory system of N. picea is emphasized by the fact that it allowed blind and ablated snails to keenly respond to shadow stimuli at very low light levels (1.1 lux), allowing them to conduct a correct defense response even in a dimly lit environment. In conjunction with both ocular and dermal receptors, our results also suggest that the darkly pigmented ce- phalic tentacles may have a photosensory role in addition Page 6 The Veliger, Vol. 44, No. 1 Table 4 Chi-Square test results for shadow responses of snails in experimental treatments and positions.

Thus, blind snails (with tentacles) dem- onstrated more shadow responses at low light levels than did ablated snails (with eyes). However, the photosensory role of the cephalic tentacles appears to be extremely spe- cific, enhancing the snail’s dermal photosensitivity only at low light levels (1.1 lux). Although the sole of the foot in N. picea is devoid of dark pigmentation, snails in the “‘sole of foot’? position did show some responsiveness to shadow, suggesting the presence of photoreceptors not associated with pigment granules. Similar structures, called “‘phaosomes’’ (Ha- szprunar, 1996), are well known in annelids (Rhodes, 1991; Jamieson, 1992; Verger-Bocquet, 1992), bivalves (Salvini-Plawen & Mayr, 1977), and gastropods (Crisp, 1971; Kunz & Haszprunar, 1992). It is also possible, that photoreception in N. picea is not totally confined to spe- cialized photosensitive structures or receptors. For ex- ample, some cnidarians which lack specialized photore- ceptors are photosensitive (Passano & McCullough, 1962; Mackie & Boag, 1963; Mackie, 1975), and brain neurons can act as photoreceptors and may even possibly control the diurnal rhythm of locomotion in Aplysia (Land, 1984). The results presented suggest two important functions that dermal photosensitivity fulfills. First, in conjunction with the skoto-tactic responses, snails exhibit (LMG, un- published observations), dermal photosensitivity which would appear to allow N. picea to mediate all phototactic responses and ensure that the snails optimize their loca- tion in their preferred habitat. Second, because N. picea lives in habitats that vary little in temperature, but can be cloudy for extended periods, it is evolutionarily advan- tageous for the species to possess an acute photosensitive mechanism that immediately alarms them of any changes in illumination caused by potential moving predators even at low light intensities. Present research is directed toward determining the relative importance of each component of the integrated photosensitive system that N. picea ap- pears to use. Acknowledgments.

Ecoloxia e Bioloxia Animal, Facultade de Ciencias, Universidade de Vigo, Pontevedra, Espafia Abstract. We investigated the influence of three different vegetation types on the establishment of terrestrial gastropod communities in the northwest Iberian Peninsula, using both an ordination technique (Detrended Correspondence Analysis) and a classification technique (Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis) applied to a 498 X 47 site-by-species abundance matrix (total number of individuals 17,902). The results of these analyses indicate that meadow sites are characterized by a group of species comprising Cionella lubrica (Miiller, 1774), Nesovitrea hammonis (Strom, 1765), and Zonitoides excavatus (Alder, 1830). Woodland sites are characterized by a group comprising Columella aspera Waldén, 1966, Oxychilus alliarius (Miller, 1822), Acanthinula aculeata (Miiller, 1774), and Punctum pygmaeum (Draparnaud, 1801). Vitrea contracta (Westerlund, 1871), Discus rotundatus, and Aegopinella nitidula (Draparnaud, 1805) form a group of companion species to this latter community. INTRODUCTION The view that vegetation type affects the distribution of terrestrial gastropods has been advanced from various an- gles and conclusions by authors including Baba, 1974; Beyer & Saari, 1977; André, 1982; Stamol, 1991, 1993; Cowie et al., 1995, and Hermida et al., 1995. Some au- thors have suggested that distribution is not primarily re- lated to vegetation but rather to litter characteristics (Bishop, 1977; Locasciulli & Boag, 1987). By contrast, other authors have gone so far as to define gastropod communities corresponding to specified phytosociologi- cal communities (Frank, 1981; Kornig, 1989; Stamol, 1992; Baba & Bagi, 1997). It has also been suggested that microhabitat characteristics are the most important determinants of gastropod distribution (Drozdowski, 1968; Boag & Wishart, 1982; Young & Evans, 1991). Most studies in this field are based on simple descrip- tions of the habitats in which different gastropod species are found, and relatively few studies have applied quan- titative methods. In the present study, with the aim of furthering understanding of the influence of vegetation type on the distribution of terrestrial gastropods, we col- lected 498 samples from three biotopes (woodland, mead- ow, riverbank) in the northwest Iberian Peninsula (Figure 1). These three biotopes have distinct characteristics, and could be expected to have distinct malacofaunas. The data were analyzed with the aid of an ordination technique (Detrended Correspondence Analysis) and a hierarchical classification technique (TWINSPAN). DESCRIPTION oF THE STUDY AREA The study area (12,400 km’) comprises the Provinces of A Corufia and Pontevedra in western Galicia (northwest Spain) (Figure 1). This area is bounded to the east by a mountain system running north-south and reaching ele- vations of up to 1100 m. Soils are generally poor, in view of the predominance of granites and schists, together with the high rainfall and hilly topography: cambisols, lepto- sols, and regosols are the most frequent. Climate is oce- anic, characterized by high rainfall and mild tempera- tures. The potential vegetation over most of the study area (which falls within the Eurosiberian Region) is Quercus robur L. woodland. Depending on series, the codominant tree species may be Betula pubescens Ehrn. or Castanea sativa Miller, with Laurus nobilis L., Ilex aquifolium L., Crataegus monogyna Jacq., or Frangus alnus Miller in the shrub layer. However, much of the study region is currently occupied by the introduced species Pinus pi- naster Aiton, P. radiata D., and Eucalyptus globulus La- bill. Riverbank vegetation is strongly influenced by ground- water level, with two different associations being recog- nized, both dominated by Alnus glutinosa (L.), namely Valeriano pyrenaicae-Alnetum glutinosae, richer in ferns P. Ondina & S. Mato, 2001 SF ——_ | ‘Sad aoe Figure | Location of the study area showing the 100 km squares of the UTM (Universal Transversal Mercator) Grid. and nemoral herbs, and the more disturbed Senecio bay- onesis-Alnetum glutinosae. Meadow vegetation in the study area falls into the phy- tosociological class Molinio-Arrhenatheretea elatioris. The most frequent species within this association include Agrostis capillaris L., Linum bienne Miller, Lolium per- enne L., Trifolium dubium Sibth., Bellis perennis L., Plantago lanceolata L., and Holcus lanatus L. MATERIALS anD METHODS Samples were collected, by stratified random sampling, from a total of 498 woodland, riverbank, and meadow sites (166 sites in each biotope). At each site we obtained a soil and litter sample of 100 x 50 X 5 cm (length x width X depth). In the laboratory, the samples were wet- sieved through a 7 mm mesh over a 0.5 mm mesh. Ma- terial retained by the second sieve was carefully exam- ined under a magnifying glass, with the aim of finding all gastropods. Gastropods found were immersed in water, then fixed in 70° alcohol. Only live specimens were in- cluded, since otherwise the abundance of testaceous spe- cies is likely to be overestimated (André, 1981; Phillipson & Abel, 1983). The 47 species found, together with the species codes used in the tables and figures, are listed in Appendix I. The resulting 498 X 47 site-by-species abundance ma- trix was analyzed by Detrended Correspondence Analy- sis. DCA is a modification of Correspondence Analysis (CA) developed to overcome some conspicuous faults. The main modification, from which the technique obtains its name, is detrending, which attempts to remove the “‘arch efect’’ in which the second and subsequent axes appear as polynomial functions of the first axis and thus obscure the underlying gradient structure (Ter Braak, 1986, 1988). Page 9 The analysis was performed with CANOCO 3.1 (Ter Braak, 1990) using the rare-species downweighting op- tion, by which all species with frequency below 20% of the maximum frequency of any species are downweighted in proportion to their frequency (Hill, 1979). For this analysis, the data matrix was first log-transformed (log[n + 1], where n is number of individuals). CANOCO can supply centroids (weighted averages) of environmental variables in the ordination diagram. To find out the centroids, a matrix was built in which the variable biotope was converted into a nominal variable, so that it was possible to represent it by points in the ordenation diagram (Ter Braak, 1988). To verify the results obtained by ordination, we used a divisive hierarchical classification technique (Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis, TWINSPAN; Hill, 1979). One of the basic ideas in TWINSPAN stems is that each group of sites can be characterized by a group of differential species, species that appear to prevail in one side of a dichotomy. The idea of a differential species is essentially qualitative, and to be effective with quantita- tive data must be replaced by a quantitative equivalent. This equivalent is the “‘pseudospecies.’’ Each species abundance is replaced by the presence of one or more pseudospecies. The more abundant a species is, the more pseudospecies are defined. The levels of abundance that are used in TWINSPAN to define the crude scale are here termed “‘pseudospecies cut levels.” RESULTS Ordination The results of correspondence analysis of the log-trans- formed 498 X 47 site-by-species matrix are summarized in Figure 2 and Tables | and 2. The first four axes ex- plained the majority of total variance. Significance was calculated using a x” procedure. Absolute contribution values for each species were cal- culated according to Judez (1989). Assuming that the 47 taxa have the same absolute contribution (defined as uni- form absolute contribution), every species would contrib- ute with 2.12% to the total variance of a single axis (100/ 47). Species with absolute contribution value higher than 2.12% would be the ones which better explain the axes (Judez, 1989). Such species are listed for axes I and II in Table 3. The interpretation of the results of this analysis in terms of potential cause-effect hypotheses is made diffi- cult by the large number of samples and species, and by the low inertias of the first three axes (despite their sta- tistical significance). With the aim of reducing data noise and better revealing the data structure, we thus performed a second analysis (Figure 3) using those species that were not downweighted, i.e., species that had been assigned a downweighting factor of 1, namely, Acanthinula aculea- ta, Arion intermedius, Aegopinella nitidula, Coumella as- Page 10 Figure 2 Ordination of the 47 species on the first two axes extracted by Detrended Correspondence Analysis. pera, Cionella lubrica, Carychium tridentatum, Discus rotundatus, Nesovitrea hammonis, Oxychilus alliarjus, Punctum pygmaeum, Vitrea contracta and Zonitoides ex- cavatus (Table 1).

Species with absolute contribution value higher than 8.3% (100/12) are indicated in bold. For axis I, these species are (in decreasing order of contribution) N. ham- monis, C. lubrica, C. aspera, A. aculeata, Z. excavatus, and O. alliarius, which together explain 77% of the var- iance on this axis. For axis II, these species are A. inter- medius, O. alliarius, D. rotundatus, and C. tridentatum, which together explain 84% of variance on this axis. We base our interpretation on axis I, since axis II was not significant at the 5% level (Judez, 1989). According to Figure 3, it can be seen that there is a group of three species (N. hammonis, Z. excavatus, and C. lubrica) which can be clearly differentiated from the rest in relation to their position along the axis. Toward the far right side of this axis, C. aspera, P. pygmaeum, and A. aculeata show a high correlation with this axis, although A. nitidula and V. contracta also show certain proximity, but with lower contributions to axis I. The two species with lowest absolute contributions to axis I were C. tridentatum and A. intermedius, which located close to the origin of this axis. O. alliarius shows a higher con- tribution to axis II than to axis I. In the plot of sites (Figure 4), most of the woodland sites are located on the right side of axis I, whereas most Table 2 Eigenvalues, percentage inertias, significance levels, and degrees of freedom for the first four axes extracted by DCA of the 498 X 47 site-by-species abundance matrix.

In view of this plot, the woodland gastropod community can be con- sidered to comprise C. aspera, A. aculeata, P. pygmaeum, and O. alliarius, accompanied by V. contracta, A. niti- dula, and D. rotundatus, while the community of open areas, meadows, comprises N. hammonis, C. lubrica, and Z. excavatus. To confirm these conclusions, we calculated the cen- troids. To find out the centroids, a matrix was built in which the variable biotope was converted into a nominal variable. So we assigned to each sample the value 1 or 0, according to their presence or absence into the consid- ered variable. As expected, the woodland centroid lies to the right of the plot, whereas the open-site centroids are plotted to the left (Figure 5). The riverbank centroid lies close to the origin, which is attributable to the fact that such sites represent various biotopes with highly variable characteristics intermediate between woodland and mead- ow. This heterogeneity of the riverbank sites makes it difficult to discriminate a clearly defined species com- Table 4 Eigenvalues, percentage inertias, significance levels and degrees of freedom for the first four axes extracted by DCA of the 12 species.

The characteristic that these riverbank samples have in common is constant moisture supply, which would discriminate aquatic species (not considered in the present study). Classification The species-abundance cut-offs selected for definition of pseudospecies for TWINSPAN were 0, 3, 6, 10, 20, 40, and 100, giving up to seven pseudospecies per spe- cies. The results of the subsequent classification of sites by pseudospecies are summarized in Figure 6. The first split separated a group (group A) containing most (73%) of the woodland sites, about half (48%) of the riverbank sites, and some (26%) of the meadow sites, from a group (group B) containing most (74%) of the meadow sites, the other half (52%) of the riverbank sites, and some (27%) of the woodland sites. The results of the classification of species by sites are summarized in Figure 7. The two species groups defined by the first split are very similar to those obtained by DCA: a first group (group A) including A. aculeata, C. aspera, O. alliarius, P. pygmaeum, A. nitidula, C. triden- tatum, V. contracta, Euconulus fulvus, and Clausilia bi- The Veliger, Vol. 44, No. 1 Figure 5 Centroids of the three biotopes (M—meadow; R—riverbank; W—woodland) on the first two axes extracted by DCA of the 12 species. dentata, and a second group (group B) including C. lu- brica, N. hammonis, Z. excavatus, Deroceras reticulatum, Ponentina subvirescens, Deroceras lombricoides, Dero- ceras laeve, and Vertigo pygmaee. The results of classification of sites considering the 12 species used in DCA are summarized in Figure 8. Con- sidering the groups resulting from the first split, the in- dicator pseudospecies for group A (with abundance class in brackets) are N. hammonis (1) and C. lubrica (1), while those for group B are V. contracta (1), A. nitidula (1), and A. aculeata (1). Group A contains 79% of woodland sites, 57% of riverbank sites, and 34% of meadow sites, whereas group B contains most meadow sites, somewhat less than half of the riverbank sites, and a small propor- tion of woodland sites. The first split within group B sep- arates group BB, with indicator pseudospecies C. lubrica (2), C. tridentatum (1), and Z. excavatus (2), containing most of the meadow sites and only a single woodland site, from group BA, containing all other group-B wood- land sites. The first split within group A separates group AA, with indicator pseudospecies C. tridentatum (1), A. nitidula (1), D. rotundatus (1), V. contracta (1), C. lu- brica (1), and A. aculeata (1), from group AB, with in- dicator species O. alliarius (1).

The classification of these 12 species by sites (Figure 9) is again very similar to that obtained by DCA. The first split separates a group (group B) comprising N. ham- monis, C. lubrica, and Z. excavatus from the rest (group A). The first species to split from group A are C. triden- tatum and A. intermedius, in accordance with the more variable behavior of these taxa (as was indicated by DCA). The remaining species split into two groups: one comprising V. contracta, D. rotundatus, and A. nitidula, the other P. pygmaeum, O. alliarius, C. aspera, and A. aculeata. DISCUSSION Gastropod populations exist in complex environments re- flecting the interaction of numerous factors, including characteristics of the soil-humus-litter-vegetation system. This system is clearly dependent on the herb and woody layers, which contribute to litter formation, filter light, and buffer variation in moisture levels and temperature. The resulting habitat characteristics are critical for the establishment of certain species, and variations in these factors are the cause of the observed differences among communities. Taken together, the results of the different analyses in- dicate that the C. lubrica, N. hammonis, and Z. excavatus characterize the snail communities present in open sites (meadow). The other group comprises C. aspera, O. al- liarius, A. aculeata, and P. pygmaeum, with preference for wooded areas with more vegetation cover. V. contracta, D. rotundatus, and A. nitidula form a group of companion species to the woodland gastropod community, but are also important in riverbank commu- nities, where they are in fact more abundant. A. intermedius and C. tridentatum show more irregular behavior, their presence being more homogeneously dis- tributed, though both appear to have a stronger preference for open areas than for woodland sites.

Although these are the only species for which statisti- cally significant conclusions may be drawn, in view of their abundances and contribution to the ordination, valid conclusions may also be inferred for a number of other species. Notably, some species that are relatively infre- quent in the sample as a whole may in fact be important components of particular habitat types that form subcat- egories of the major categories (woodland, riverbank, meadow). Species of this type may include the agrioli- macids D. reticulatum, D. lombricoides, and D. laeve (which appear to show a preference for open areas), and the group comprising P. subvirescens, Cochlicella bar- bara, and V. pygmaea (particularly the latter), which is more abundant in meadow. E. fulvus, by contrast, shows a preference for woodland sites. Some authors, including Boycott (1934), whose study provided the starting point for the majority of more recent studies, have concluded that gastropods show no specific association with vegetation, and that apparent relation- ships between gastropods and vegetation are due more to environmental conditions than to the fact that the plants in question are food sources (since the variety of the gas- tropod diet means that this would be a limiting factor only under extreme conditions). Bishop (1977) considered that vegetation has no important effect on the composition of the malacofauna, but that the litter layer (which provides Table 5 Coordinates, weights, and absolute contributions to the first two axes extracted by DCA for all 12 species included in the analysis.

Locasciulli & Boag (1987) pointed out that litter layer characteristics depend on the overlying vegetation, and took as their starting point the assumption that gastropods do not use the litter layer directly, but rather nutrients derived from it; nevertheless, they stressed the importance of the litter layer for providing a stable microclimate. In the present study, we have taken as our starting point the view that even the most common and most euryecious species do not occur in all vegetation types; all species prefer some biotopes over others, so that different bio- topes can be considered rich or poor depending on the conditions that they offer to the specific demands of the species in question. Thus each biotope may contain char- acteristic associations, and it is thus probably the condi- tions created by that biotope that determine the establish- ment of the malacofauna. Woodland vegetation may itself provide the gastropod fauna with the necessary conditions for survival: it buff- ers variations in temperature and humidity, and provides shelter and varied microhabitats such as tree roots, fallen trunks, hollows, together with a usable humus and litter layer. The tree cover performs a basic microclimatic role, which is probably more important than the composition of the litter layer. It is indeed the presence or absence of climate-buffering tree cover that largely explains the dif- ference in malacofauna between woodland and meadow biotopes: the latter are exposed to marked daily and sea- sonal variations in temperature, humidity, and light inten- sity (Dillon, 1980; Boag & Wishart, 1982; Curry, 1994). Species that occur preferentially in meadow are probably more resistant to such variation, and escape its effects by Page 16 The Veliger, Vol. 44, No. 1 A Z. excavatus C. tridentatum V. contracta P. pygmaeum A. intermedius N. hammonis D. rotundatus O. alliarius C. lubrica A. nitidula C. aspera A. aculeata Figure 9 TWINSPAN classification of the 12 species considered in the second DCA. burrowing into the soil (Stephenson, 1966 in Peake, 1978; Outeiro et al., 1989; Outeiro et al., 1993), or are more influenced by other non-microclimatic factors first, such as biotope factors, or soil factors, or factors not consid- ered in the present study, such as the quality of the litter or the herb layer. Riverbanks constitute such a heterogeneous category that fauna of both types are present, especially species at the limits of the requirements of the other biotopes. These habitats thus probably behave as ecotones, as well as be- ing favorable because of water availability. In order to facilitate comparison of our results with those of previous studies, we have summarized previous results in Table 6. Like us, most authors have reported C. lubrica and N. hammonis to be species of meadow, though only Riballo (1990) also included Z. excavatus as the third characteristic species of this community. Previ- ous reports of species characteristic of woodland com- munities, however, show some discrepancies. For exam- ple, Alonso (1977) concluded that C. lubrica is charac- teristic of poplar groves. This is probably attributable to the particular characteristics of poplar groves, in which trees are planted in existing meadow, where C. lubrica was probably already present. Baba (1981) likewise considered C. lubrica to be a constant species within the malacofauna of woodland sites. This author’s aim was to identify relationships be- tween the successional series of gastropod communities and plant communities along a river. The only habitats considered were woodland biotopes, characterized by various moisture and temperature indices; there was thus no comparison with other biotopes. Similar conclusions were reached by Wareborn (1982), who considered WN. hammonis and C. lubrica to be characteristic of woodland (again the only biotope considered), though it should be stressed that the characterization of biotopes in terms of malacofauna was not one of the goals of this study, so that there was no comparison with other biotopes. This author also found that C. Jubrica may occur at high abun- dance in meadow. Waldén (1955) reported that C. lubrica iS a species typical of woodlands, but this conclusion was not based on a uniform sampling strategy (16 samples were obtained from woodland sites, versus only four from open sites). This author likewise reported that C. lubrica may be abundant in swamps and marshes. Note, however, that Waldén’s data analysis (using percentage abundanc- es) is not directly comparable with that used in the pre- sent study. The few previous studies to consider Z. excavatus have concluded that it is a woodland species (Boycott, 1934; Bishop, 1977; Anderson, 1983); this contrasts with the present study, and with Riballo (1990), who found that Z. excavatus appears to be characteristic of meadow. Ri- ballo (1990) states that the distribution of Z. excavatus is wider than has been suggested by some previous authors; indeed, Anderson (1983) also found this species in mead- ow, and remarked that in acid soils (as in the present study) it typically occurs in association with N. hammon- P.

Boycott (1934) did not find this species in his wood- land sites and, although he referred to it as a woodland taxon, he stated that its special characteristics (notably calciphobia and sensitivity to competition) lead it to live “where it can” and not “‘where it would like to.”’ In any case, there have been few ecological studies of this spe- cies, and there is a shortage of data to facilitate statistical investigation of putative relationships with particular types of biotope. Our results for both P. pygmaeum and A. aculeata agree closely with previous reports; both have consis- tently been identified as woodland species. Similarly, our results for C. aspera and O. alliarius, classified in the present study as characteristic of woodland, likewise show close agreement with previous studies. The species classified in the present study as woodland-community companion species have often been described as wood- land species, supporting our findings.

This difference is probably attributable to the fact that these previous stud- ies considered only woodland sites, therefore the presence in this biotope of ubiquitous species seems logical. More- over, some of the species classified in the present study as characteristic of meadow or riverbank have previously been classified as ubiquitous by previous authors. It should be borne in mind that there have been few studies in which the sampling method or the statistical treatment of the data have been directly comparable with those used in the present study. Furthermore, most pre- vious studies included consideration of species that are absent from our region, or that did not show significant habitat preferences in the present study. André (1982) studied terrestrial mollusk populations in Quercus pubes- Page 18 cens communities, and by means of multivariate analysis techniques obtained an ordination of samples and species that is very similar to that obtained in the present study. He likewise characterized two contrasting groups of sam- ples, on the one hand samples from open sites, and on the other, samples from sites with taller vegetation cover. Many of the species present in this author’s samples were not present in our samples. Nevertheless, our results for those species present in both studies show close agree- ment, with C. lubrica characteristic of open sites, and D. rotundatus, E. fulvus, A. aculeata, and P. pygmaeum characteristic of woodland or semi-woodland sites.

The hitherto unknown occurrence of the strombid subgenus Lentigo in deposits of Neogene and Quaternary age in tropical America is documented. Sixteen species are recognized, which occur at 17 different general locations throughout the Caribbean. The oldest record is from the early middle Miocene of Carriacou, Lesser Antilles, and the youngest from the Holocene of Isla Margarita, Venezuela. Lentigo is therefore documented over a time interval of about 15 million years. Four species are described as new: S. barrigonensis from the Cubagua Formation (early Pliocene) of the Araya Peninsula, Venezuela; S. toroensis from the Cayo Agua Formation (early Pliocene) of Cayo Agua, Bocas del Toro, Panama; S. fetus from the Escudo de Veraguas Formation (late Pliocene) of Escudo de Veraguas, Bocas del Toro, Panama; and S. insulanus from the Escudo de Veraguas Formation (middle Pliocene part) of Escudo de Veraguas. INTRODUCTION While making up faunal lists of assemblages from the island of Escudo de Veraguas, Bocas del Toro, Panama for the Panama Paleontology Project (PPP), the senior author came across a small incomplete specimen of some kind of Strombus he thought he had never seen before. The puzzling feature of this specimen was three spiral rows of knobs on the dorsal side of the body whorl. He showed the specimen to the junior author, who almost immediately said that he remembered an article in a French journal dealing with species of Strombus showing that very feature: it was the paper by Lozouet & Maestrati (1986). In that paper the authors discussed two species of the subgenus Lentigo, Jousseaume, 1886, from the Eu- ropean late Eocene and Oligocene to early Miocene, re- spectively, stating that the late Eocene species must have given rise to the living Eastern Pacific Strombus granu- latus, Swainson, 1822, since no species of Lentigo was known from the American Cenozoic. We could hardly believe this statement, and we decided to search the col- lections of the Basel Natural History Museum, old col- lections and the new PPP collections. The result was as- tonishing: we found a total of 43 fossil specimens of Len- tigo, 26 in the old collections, and 17 in the new PPP collections. This admittedly not very rich material is here assigned to 16 “‘species.’”’ The word species is put in quo- tation marks because five of them are identified by letters only, six are positively identified, and five are identified by means of open nomenclature. Some of these ‘‘species”’ are represented by a single more or less well-preserved specimen or even by a fragment only. In case additional material should become available in the future, the num- ber of species or their designation may have to be mod- ified. The purpose of this paper is to document the occur- rences of species of the subgenus Lentigo in the Neogene and Quaternary of tropical America. It is not the purpose to give a revision of the subgenus. As now understood, the subgenus Lentigo seems to be characterized by two features. First: Lentigo has three or four axial swellings per whorl on the earliest teleoconch whorls with a varying number of axial ribs in the inter- spaces. On succeeding whorls the axial sculptural ele- ments become subequal in size. Second: Lentigo has two or more spiral rows of knobs on the dorsal side of the body whorl. We are aware that this is not a convincing definition of the subgenus, but this goes for other subgenera of Strombus as well. As a matter of fact, the family Strom- bidae badly needs a thorough revision. We know very little about the ontogenetic development of strombid spe- cies. Careful studies of protoconchs and the sculptural development of early teleoconch whorls should be un- dertaken. Such studies will at the same time help the un- derstanding of variability in strombid species. However, for the time being we are in the dark and are perhaps guessing too much.

DISTRIBUTION THROUGH TIME AND SPACE When discussing the living Indo-Pacific species of Len- tigo, Abbott (1960:117) also assigned Strombus aldrichi Dall (1890:175, pl. 12, figs. 1, 4) from the early Miocene Chipola Formation of Florida to that subgenus. Lozouet & Maestrati (1986:15) disagreed with that assignment by simply stating that S. aldrichi is a species very different from the “‘radix-granulatus group.” If we presume for a moment that S. aldrichi actually is a member of the subgenus Lentigo, it represents not only the oldest but also a rather isolated occurrence in the Western Hemiphere. In the original description of S. aldrichi Dall (1890:176) expressed the opinion that it was related to the living S. granulatus. Strombus aldrichi is indeed a problem. We have eight specimens from the Chipola Formation of Florida at hand. In general shape they are similar to the material reported on herein, but their relationship to that material is not clear. As in other species of Lentigo, the early teleoconch whorls of S. aldrichi are sculptured by three axial swell- ings per whorl and four to eight axial ribs in the inter- spaces, all of which are crossed by spiral threads.

If S. aldrichi belongs to Lentigo, its distant ancestor must be one of the European species discussed by Lozouet & Maestrati (1986). One of the un- known ancestors of S. aldrichi must have lost (or never had) the characteristic feature of spiral rows of knobs on the dorsal side of the body whorl, which has not been reacquired since. The 16 species recognized in this paper occur at 17 different general locations (Figure 1). The westernmost location is situated west of Limon, Costa Rica. The north- ernmost location is Santiago, Dominican Republic; the easternmost locality is Barbados, Lesser Antilles; and the southernmost occurrence is the Esmeraldas Province, Ec- uador. In other words, the subgenus Lentigo is spread over a large area mostly covered by water with a north- south extension of about 2000 km and an east-west ex- tension of about 2500 km. The part of the Pacific Ocean shown in Figure | is inhabited by S. granulatus and that of the Caribbean Sea by S. raninus. The stratigraphic occurrences of the 16 species are list- ed in Table 1. The oldest record is Strombus (Lentigo) cf. insulanus n. sp. from the early middle Miocene Grand Bay Formation of Carriacou, and the youngest record is the single specimen of S. raninus from the Holocene Boca Chica Formation of Isla Margarita, Venezuela. The material described in this paper therefore covers a time interval of about 15 my. SYSTEMATIC DESCRIPTIONS Genus Strombus Linnaeus Linnaeus, 1758:742.

East Africa to the Marshall and Tu- amotu Islands according to Abbott (1960:117). Remarks: It is not the purpose of this paper to review the subgenus Lentigo, but to document its occurrence in tropical America. A proper review of Lentigo would re- quire the study of much more material and from a broader geographic area. For this reason, we refrain from the at- tempt to give a proper diagnosis of the subgenus. How- ever, there seem to be two features that largely define Lentigo. First: Lentigo has three or four axial swellings per whorl on the earliest teleoconch whorls with a vary- ing number of axial ribs in the interspaces. Second: Len- tigo has two or more spiral rows of knobs on the dorsal side of the body whorl. Future work on the group may reveal additional diagnostic characters. Among the species recorded herein the first feature is seen in S. granulatus, S. raninus, and S. insulanus. In S. barrigonensis and S. fetus it is not documented because the earliest teleoconch whorls are not preserved. Their assignment to Lentigo is therefore mainly based on the second"
