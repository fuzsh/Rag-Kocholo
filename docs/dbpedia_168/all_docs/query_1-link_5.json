        "text": "Abstract: This study investigates the population density characteristics of the megafauna at two previously described chemosynthesis-based communities associated with cold seepage at the Off Hatsushima Island site (OHl) in Sagami Bay and hytlrothermalism at the Minami-Ensei Knoll (MEK) in the Okinawa Trough. Quantitative sampling was conducted using a submersible, ROV and Deep Tow Camera array near each community. A total of 26 and 27 megafaunal species were recorded at OHI and MEK, respectively. The dominant organism with respect to population density was the provannid snail Provanna glabra at OHI. This species also occurred at MEK, but it had a lower density than at OHL Instead, Cantrainea jamsteci was the dominant gastropod species at MEK. The community at MEK was dominated with respect to population density by the symbiont-containing mussel Bathymodiolus japonicus, but this species was not so common at OHI. The mean population densities of almost all megafaunal species, except f...\n\nFossil evidence of chemosynthesis-based organisms has so far been circumstantial and completely based on association of fossilized organisms with 13 C-depleted authigenic carbonates. In this study, the stable isotopic signatures of preserved organic matter, conchiolin, in the fossil shell interior were used to obtain additional evidence for chemosynthesis-based bivalves, since the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isotopic compositions of soft tissues can distinguish chemosynthesis-based animals from marine photosynthesis-based animals. The carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of both soft tissues (the mantle) and conchiolin from modern chemosynthesis-based bivalves belonging to the genera Calyptogena and Bathymodiolus had small difference (Δ 13 C conchiolin-mantle ≤ +3‰, Δ 15 N conchiolin-mantle ≤ −1‰ with the exception of −7.5‰ for a Calyptogena specimen). Sulfur isotope compositions of the conchiolin from Calyptogena whose lifestyle is almost entirely infaunal were significantly depleted in 34 S, while epifaunal Bathymodiolus showed relatively small differences between the δ 34 S values of chonchiolin and soft tissues. Thus, a systematic difference in sulfur isotope compositions has not been observed for chemosynthesis-based bivalves (Δ 34 S conchiolin-mantle = −16.1 to + 2.6‰). Moreover, we were able to extract conchiolin from fossil bivalves to determine its isotopic compositions. The δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of the conchiolin obtained from the fossil Vesicomyidae were −28.5 and −1.4‰, respectively. The δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of lost soft tissues were estimated at approximately −31‰ and − 1‰, respectively, by subtracting the Δ conchiolin-mantle values determined for modern soft tissues and conchiolin (Δ 13 C conchiolin-mantle = +3‰, Δ 15 N conchiolin-mantle = −1‰). Such values are expected for clams harboring thioautotrophic symbionts, suggesting that the fossil was dependent on chemosynthesis during its lifetime. In contrast, the carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios of the conchiolin from the fossil Mytilidae were −23.1‰ and + 4.2‰, respectively. The estimated δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of its lost soft tissues were approximately −26‰ and + 5‰, respectively. These values are depleted in 13 C and 15 N relative to non-symbiont bearing marine organisms suggesting that this fossil likely supported chemosynthetic and/or methanotorophic symbionts and was also dependent on photosynthetically derived organic matter. Our study provides additional and more direct evidence for putative chemosynthesis-based bivalves, whether or not they harbor symbionts."
