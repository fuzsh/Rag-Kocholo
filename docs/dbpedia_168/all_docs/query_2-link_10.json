        "text": "A new parasitic species of eulimid gastropod, Haliella seisuimaruaesp. nov. , is described from bathyal (728–978 m) waters off the Pacific coasts of Japan. It shows the closest resemblance to the type species H. stenostoma from the North Atlantic and Barents Sea in having a tall shell with an almost straight outer lip, but differs in having a junction of the parietal wall and columellar lip at 38% of the aperture height from the suture (33% in H. stenostoma ), a slightly wider aperture and a more curved and extended columellar lip. The holotype of H. seisuimaruaesp. nov. was found attached to an irregular sea urchin, Brissopsis sp. cf. luzonica (Spatangoida: Brissidae). This represents the first direct observation of parasitic ecology and echinoderm host for the genus Haliella . A new replacement name, Eulima tsushimensisnom. nov. , is proposed here for Eulima stenostoma A. Adams, 1861, which is preoccupied by Eulima stenostoma Jeffreys, 1858 (type of Haliella ).\n\nThe joint Russian-German expedition SokhoBio in 2015, on the research vessel Akademik M.A. Lavrentyev, provided the first opportunity to investigate the richness and composition of the abyssal gastropod fauna in the Kuril Basin of the Sea of Okhotsk, from which only a single species has been recorded in the literature. During the expedition, sampling of benthic animals was conducted at eight stations in the Sea of Okhotsk and at three stations in the Pacific (landward slope of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench) using an Agassiz trawl, an epibentic sledge, and a giant box corer. A total of 417 specimens of 'prosobranch' gastropods were taken alive and were classified into 15 families and 70 species of Vetigastropoda and Caenogastropoda. Both abundance and richness were lower than expected in the Kuril Basin compared to the Pacific: 97 specimens belonging to 27 species (11 families) were collected at seven stations in the Kuril Basin, while 286 specimens in 43 species were found from two abyssal stations on the Pacific side of the Kuril Islands. Only six species occurred at abyssal depths on both sides. Familial composition also differed: large-sized buccinids were common only on the Pacific side. The very low levels of dissolved oxygen might explain the low abundance and richness, as well as the scarcity of large species, of Gastropoda in the Kuril Basin.\n\nSolenogastres (Mollusca, Aplacophora) form a common part of the benthic malacofauna in the deep sea, but their diversity in the Northwest Pacific is poorly understood. In this study, we analyze the systematics and distribution of Solenogastres sampled during the Kuril-Kamchatka Biodiversity Studies II expedition to the hadal Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, in the framework of previous expeditions to the shallow bathyal areas of the Japanese coast, the abyssal Kuril Basin in the Sea of Okhotsk, and the open abyssal plain of the Northwest Pacific. This unique dataset from adjacent regions extending from bathyal to hadal zones, enables us to study bathymetric and geographic distribution ranges in this neglected deep-sea clade for the first time. Our applied species delineation in these taxonomically challenging aplacophoran molluscs relies on an integrative approach, combining scleritome characters with molecular analyses. A first molecular phylogenetic study based on two mitochondrial markers reveals conflict with traditional systematics and suggests the need to revise at least two polyphyletic families and the polyphyletic order ‘Cavibelonia’. In total, 192 specimens could be grouped within 60 candidate species, which present a surprisingly rich abyssal fauna and includes the first representatives of Solenogastres at hadal depths. We found a high proportion of singletons and little faunal overlap between the investigated regions and depths, suggesting that the diversity of the abyssal and hadal Solenogastres is not entirely determined by source-sink dynamics from the bathyal slope. Rather, there is evidence for abyssal source populations, supporting the presence of endemic abyssal and potentially even hadal species. Our molecular data reject the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench as an insurmountable barrier of dispersal for Solenogastres, with one species present at both sides of the trench. Remarkably, one species from the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench shows a vertical distribution extending over more than 6,000 m. Overall, our study more than doubles the global number of solenogaster species from abyssal depths, provides first records of a unique hadal solenogaster fauna and delivers valuable insights into distribution ranges of these deep-sea molluscs. Highlights: • First records of Solenogastres from the hadal zone (>6000 m). • First phylogeny of Northwest Pacific Solenogastres reveals conflict with traditional taxonomy. • Little faunal overlap between investigated regions and depth zones. • Bathymetric range of >6,000 m in an Acanthomeniidae species (bathyal to hadal depths). • Molecular evidence for dispersal between landward and seaward side of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench.\n\nThe phylogenetic position of Haloceratidae, a little-known family of the subclass Caenogastropoda, is contested due to its extreme rarity in bathyal waters worldwide (c. 800–3,500 m deep). Haloceratids share several morphological and ecological traits with members of Vanikoroidea, Tonnoidea, Capuloidea and Velutinoidea, and were provisionally included in Vanikoroidea based on the absence of certain apomorphic features of the latter three taxa. Here, we first investigate the phylogenetic position of the family based on molecular data from both of the recognized genera, Haloceras and Zygoceras. Reconstruction based on three nuclear and three mitochondrial gene sequences suggests that the Haloceratidae constitute a sister clade to the Capulidae and that the two families collectively form the superfamily Capuloidea. This superfamily is united in a large, robust clade with Calyptraeoidea, Velutinoidea, Tonnoidea and Neogastropoda. The superfamily Cypraeoidea, as previously conceived, was found to be polyphyletic; we propose new concepts of Cypraeoidea (including Cypraeidae and Ovulidae) and Velutinoidea (including Velutinidae, Eratoidae and Triviidae). This topology also confirms the polyphyly of taxa with the ‘echinospira’ type of larvae (Echinospirida). The morphological resemblance of these polyphyletic taxa highlights parallel acquisition of traits in response to the same selective pressures.\n\nThe vastness and difficult accessibility of the deep sea, together with the previous thought that it harboured no life, has hampered research in this environment until the nineteenth century, when the exponential discovery of new species was rapidly combined with the development of new gears to explore the deep-sea fauna. Nevertheless, apparatuses developed in the twentieth century are still used to sample benthic organisms nowadays. Among them, box corers (BC) and epibenthic sledges (EBS) are the most common ones applied in macrofaunal studies. In this study, the comparability between these two gears from samples collected at the deep NW Pacific was tested by means of non-permutational ANOVA. Using uni- and multivariate analyses, we tested whether significant differences could be found between gears using the univariate indices: high taxa richness, total abundance, evenness, estimated number of taxa, and Shannon diversity; and the multivariate indices: total abundance, presence|absence, and relative abundance. Results indicate that both gears can be comparable when evenness, estimated number of taxa, and Shannon diversity (univariate indices) are used, as well as relative abundances based on the multivariate data matrix. This means that data derived from the EBS can be used in a quantitative way, for e.g. in an ecological context, up to a certain extent. On the other hand, significant differences between BC and EBS were found for total abundance and species richness. This could be a result of the bigger amount of sediment the EBS collects together with a larger sampled area by this gear, consequently leading to a higher amount of organisms and taxa sampled. Moreover, despite the interchangeability between these two gears was possible for some indices at higher taxa level, caution should be taken into account when comparing data for other deep-sea areas and at species level."
