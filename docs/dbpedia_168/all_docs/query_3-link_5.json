This complex lies at the break of the slope ( Figure 2). The entire Logatchev area is heavily sedimented. Several sites showed di¡use £ow through the soft sediment (Figure 1). These sites were typically small ( $ 2 Â 3 m) and marked with dead mytilid shells. One of the larger di¡use £ow ¢elds discovered by the MAR'97 expedition $ 100 m north-west of Irina-2 appeared to have an extensive population of vesicomyid clams. This ¢eld was named Ànya's Garden' (Figure 1) and marked with the marker Ànya'. Several patches ( $ 1 Â 3 m) of dead vesicomyid shells coated with manganese oxides were also observed north-west of Anya's Garden. In addition, there are also indications of active venting outside the area mapped on Figure 1. Dredging $ 550 m north-east of the Main Mound (start 14 8 45.326 ' N 44 8 58.507 ' W, depth 3010 m, end 14 8 44.874 ' N 44 8 57.699 ' W, depth 2780 m) recovered numerous live mytilids, several vesicomyid shells, cerithiacean gastropods and the conid snail Phymorhynchus moskalevi . French divers also reported dead mytilids and chimneys south- east up the slope from the Main Mound at a depth of 2680 m (D. Prieur, personal communication). More recently in 1998, another expedition on RV `Professor Logatchev' discovered a dead mytilid ¢eld $ 3 miles south- east from the Main Mound at 2600 m (G. Cherkashev, personal communication), with sulphide structures and deposits (sampled), empty tubes of chaetopterid polychaetes (sampled) and mussel shells (observed only). The taxonomic status of some of the dominant species at Logatchev is being disputed. This study addresses the problems with mytilid and vesicomyid bivalves, bresilioid shrimps, and polynoid polychaetes. In general, mytilid bivalves are the dominant megafaunal species at Logatchev. They clearly belong to the genus Bathymodiolus , but they di¡er in some morphological and genetic characters from Bathymodiolus puteoserpentis found at Snake Pit and Broken Spur (Von Cosel et al., 1999). However, other genetic (and morphometric) studies based on mitochondrial DNA comparisons strongly support the Logatchev mytilid to be considered Bathymodiolus puteoserpentis , with little di¡erentiation of Snake Pit and Logatchev populations (Maas et al., 1999). At present, taxonomic authorities refer to the Logatchev mytilid as Bathymodiolus a¡. puteoserpentis . The Logatchev mussels harbour commensal polynoid polychaetes like everywhere else on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Unlike its host, this polychaete belongs to the same species all along the known vent sites of the MAR, but is presently referred to as Branchipolynoe a¡. seepensis since it shows signi¢cant genetic divergence from the Gulf of Mexico cold-seep B. seepensis (Chevaldonne ̈ et al., 1998). Caridean bresilioid shrimps of Logatchev include a variety of species. Rimicaris exoculata is present in abundance, as well as the `enigmatic small orange shrimp'. The taxonomic status of this shrimp has been disputed since observations by Segonzac et al. (1993) who proposed this form to be a new species of Chorocaris with some features intermediate between Chorocaris and Rimicaris (see Shank et al., 1998 for references). This `small orange' shrimp was then described as Iorania concordia by Vereshchaka (1996) and independently as Rimicaris aurantiaca by Martin et al. (1997). However, Shank et al. (1998), using allozymes as well as mitochondrial DNA sequences (COI and 16S rRNA genes), found no di¡erence between R. exoculata and the `small orange shrimps'. They concluded that these are two ontogenic stages of R. exoculata . Recent studies of shrimp lipids have also suggested that the small orange shrimp is a highly specialized juvenile stage of R. exoculata that obtains and stores substantial amounts of polyunsatu- rated fatty acids produced by phytoplankton, enabling this shrimp to inhabit deep-sea vents and disperse between remote and isolated sites (Pond et al., 1999; Southward et al., 1999). In this paper we therefore refer to the `small orange shrimp' as juvenile R. exoculata . Chorocaris chacei is also present at Logatchev, as well as Mirocaris keldyshi (Vereshchaka, 1997). The taxonomic status of the latter can also be considered controversial, since there is little genetic di¡erence at the mitochondrial COI gene between Mirocaris fortunata and M. keldyshi (T. Shank, 1999). However, because of morphological di¡erences, and until population genetic studies including both morphotypes are conducted, we will call the Mirocaris found at Logatchev M. keldyshi . Finally, the shrimps of the genus Alvinocaris found on the Main Mound appear to belong to two species: A. markensis , common at other hot vent areas on the MAR, and a new species being described, which is closely related to the Gulf of Mexico cold-seep shrimp A. muricola (A.Williams & A.Vereshchaka, personal communications). It has also been suggested that there is a third species of Alvinocaris in the Logatchev area found at present at Irina-2 and Anya's Garden (A. Vereshchaka, personal communication). The vesicomyid clams found at Logatchev appear to belong to a new species, tentatively assigned to Ectenagena (E. Krylova, personal communication). However, it should be noted that Peek et al. (1998) have demonstrated that generic names ( Vesicomya , Calyptogena , Ectenagena ) within the family Vesicomyidae seemed to be phylogeneti- cally meaningless. Preliminary morphological (E. Krylova, personal communication) and genetic (A. Peek, personal communication) analysis of this new species indicated a¤nities with Calyptogena sp. nov. from the Gulf of Mexico and Calyptogena kaikoi from Japan cold seeps. Notably, the population of clams nearest to Logatchev studied in the Atlantic, at the Barbados prism area (Olu et al., 1997), belongs to a species not as closely related (A. Peek, oral communication). The preliminary list of fauna known currently from Logatchev is given in Table 1. Taxa still being processed and missing from the list include in particular some polychaetes, crustaceans and limpets. The Main Mound presents at least three biotopes where communities of vent-speci¢c organisms ...\n\nContext 2\n\n... smoking craters, (ii) black smoker chimneys, and (iii) sites with di¡use £ow through soft sediment. Fauna around smoking craters appeared to be relatively poor. Observations showed sparse populations on small (0.5^1.5 m tall), weakly active chimneys which usually mark the crater rims. These included clusters of Bathymodiolus a¡. puteoserpentis (up to 14 individuals) especially abundant at Irina, small groups of shrimps Rimicaris exoculata and Mirocaris keldyshi , occasional Chorocaris chacei , small numbers of the ophiuroid Ophioctenella acies (up to 10 ind m 7 2 ) and the conid gastropod Phymorhynchus moskalevi . Slurp-gun samples taken on small chimneys around smoking craters earlier by `Mir' (at Irina) revealed a more diverse fauna ( Table 1), dominated by M. keldyshi , B. a¡. puteoserpentis and O. acies with a few Alvinocaris spp. also present (a sketch of one of those sites is given in Gebruk et al., 1997a). Swarms of shrimp were not found on the Main Mound and the abundance of organisms in all the communities studied was relatively low. Several sites with di¡use £ow through the sediment were reported earlier from the Main Mound (Gebruk et al., 1997b) and some of them were also seen from Alvin (Figure 1). One slurp-gun sample taken earlier by `Mir' contained at least ten species from this biotope, including live B. a¡. puteoserpentis , R. exoculata and M. keldyshi , various gastropods, including P. moskalevi and limpets, and several polychaete species (Table 1). Most of the mound at Irina-2 is inactive with several rows of short 1^2 m tall dead chimneys spreading more or less radially from the top central chimney complex (Figure 2). An exceptionally rich hot vent community was discovered during one of the Àlvin' dives around the central chimney complex and on the westnorth-west slope of the mound. It was marked with a `MAR-2' marker. This community includes a large swarm of Rimicaris exoculata extending from the base to the top of the central smoker complex, and a thick mussel bed at least 20 m in diameter (Figure 2). The mussel bed is 0.5 m thick near the base of the central chimney complex (estimated while sampling at point 3; Figure 2) with the thickness gradually diminishing to just one layer of mussels at the edge of the bed. Associated with the mussel bed is the ophiuroid O. acies , which forms a multilayered carpet at some places with densities estimated to reach up to 80 ind dm 7 2 (point 3, Figure 2). Gastropods are also common, with P. moskalevi forming big clusters (up to 12 individuals per cluster at point 2), and limpets. The shrimp population on the mussel bed is dominated by M. keldyshi , but also comprises C. chacei , A. markensis and A. a¡. muricola . Fila- mentous bacteria often form patches on the mussel shells and this bacterial fouling seems to attract numerous limpets and M. keldyshi . Di¡use £ow could often be seen emerging through the mussel bed. Occasional macrourids and zoarcids were the only ¢sh observed in this community. The biomass of mytilids was estimated at point 3 (Figure 2) where the mussel bed is 0.5 m thick. However, only the 0.3 m thick layer was used in calculations, since many of the mussels in the deeper layers were dead. The value showed 244 g for a 10 Â 10 Â 10 cm cluster (wet weight including shells), corresponding to over 70 kg m 7 2 for the 0.3 m thick layer.

The central smoker complex was occupied by the swarm of R. exoculata with distinct patches (0.3^0.5 m in diameter) of the orange juvenile stage of R. exoculata . At Irina-2 some groups of juvenile R. exoculata also occurred in zones of di¡use £ow where the temperature exceeded 20 8 C. However, they were not present in zones of high vent £ow and adjacent to black smoke, where only aggregations of adults could be seen. Compared to adult R. exoculata , juveniles were frequently less active in the swarm. The density of shrimps in the swarm (estimated from video frames) was at least 3000 ind m 7 2 for adult R. exoculata and up to 3500 ind m 7 2 for the orange juveniles. However, the vertical orientation of the swarm and its thickness (up to 0.4 m on concave surfaces) make the three-dimensional swarm structure very complex, so that density estimates are probably too conservative. The borders of the swarm were very pronounced: shrimp density changed from thousands of individuals to just several m 7 2 over a few tens of centimetres. Patches of juvenile shrimps (up to 10^15 individuals), also orange in colour, frequently occurred on the mussel bed. Slurp-gun samples (taken at points 3 and 4) showed that shrimps in these groups were mainly M. keldyshi and Chorocaris chacei with a few specimens of R. exoculata also present. Adult Chorocaris chacei occurred solitarily or in small groups (3^4 individuals) within the swarm and on the mussel bed. Detailed video observations revealed that they scavenge on dead Rimicaris but are also able to attack live shrimps. Species of Alvinocaris were the less common shrimps of this community. Solitary adults could be observed moving actively on the mussel bed or close to the swarm of R. exoculata , but they rarely formed groups. At the periphery of the community, at point 9 ( Figure 2), ¢ve big motionless adults were observed at one time on the rock covered with unidenti¢ed zoantharians. It seems likely that Alvinocaris spp. are active predators/scavengers only entering zones of high biomass to feed. Several specimens of Alvinocaris spp. were caught in the baited trap deployed at point 3, Figure 2). Of special interest is the occurrence of live vesicomyid clams at Anya's Garden (Figure 3). This is the ¢rst record of a living vesicomyid population on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Anya's Garden lies at $ 3038 m depth $ 100 m north- west of Irina-2 and is at least 12 m in diameter. The distribution of clams on the ¢eld was very uneven, varying from small groups of 3^4 individuals to aggregations covering several m 2 , with highest densities reaching 120 ind m 7 2 (Figure 3). One of the aggregations formed linear clumps up to 0.4 m high and 5 m long, presumably following a pattern of £uid discharge from the sediment. Most of the individuals were partly buried in the sediment in the slightly inclined position typical for vesicomyids (Figure 4). Other bivalve species occurring on the clam ¢eld were Bathymodiolus a¡. puteoserpentis and at least two species belonging to the family Thyasiridae: Thyasira ( Parathyasira ) spp. Mussels in Anya's Garden were seen in clumps of 4^60 individuals often associated with visible di¡use £ow. T emperature measurements showed 7 8 C immediately above one of the clusters. Associated with the mussels were numerous large limpets (yet to be identi¢ed). Many of the mussels were covered with ¢lamentous bacteria and egg capsules of Phymorhynchus moskalevi . Thyasirids (up to 18 mm in diameter) occurred among vesicomyids. The density of thyasirid shells (mainly empty) on the sediment surface reached 20 ind m 7 2 . Both vesicomyids and thyasirids seem to avoid zones of highest £ow with increased temperature. T emperature measurements were not taken among clam clusters. Clams and mussels were rarely seen together and always in discrete clusters. Within the clam ¢eld, the shrimp population included Mirocaris keldyshi , Chorocaris chacei and Alvinocaris sp. Other fauna within Anya's Garden included Ophioctenella acies (up to 20 ind m 7 2 ) associated with mussels, Phymorhynchus moskalevi (in clusters up to 7 ind among the clams), limpets and galatheid crabs. The infaunal population in this community was very diverse and abundant and was dominated by polychaetes (samples are being processed and the data will be published separately). Samples of gills from all bivalve species were preserved for transmission electron microscopy to search for endo- symbiotic bacteria. Preliminary results indicate that there are two morphological types of symbionts in the gills of Bathymodiolus a¡. puteoserpentis : one abundant type resem- bling methane-oxidizing bacteria in morphology, and another type that might represent sulphur-oxidizing bacteria (Southward et al., 1999). In the vesicomyid and thyasirid bivalves, only one morphotype of bacterial symbiont, possibly sulphur-oxidizers has been detected thus far (E. Southward, A. Gebruk & P. Chevaldonne ̈, unpublished data).
