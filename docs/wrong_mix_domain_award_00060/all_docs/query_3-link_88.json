        "text": "Elsevier and the editors of the leading international journal Chemical Physics Letters announced that the 8th Ahmed Zewail Prize in Molecular Sciences has been awarded to Professor Emeritus John C. Tully from Yale University “for development and insightful application of powerful theoretical tools to elucidate the motions of molecules undergoing bond-breaking, energy transfer, electronic transitions, and adsorption/desorption.”\n\nThe award consists of a monetary amount, a gold medal and a certificate. The award ceremony takes place at the Ahmed Zewail Prize Award Symposium every two years, where the award winner will be requested to deliver a lecture and invite 3 - 4 colleagues to each deliver a supporting lecture covering their work in a related field. The prize symposium will be held in 2021 and more details about this will follow.\n\nCongratulations, John!"
