        "text": "Exclusive\n\nOn Wednesday, August 2, the seventh anniversary of the departure of the Egyptian scientist, Dr. Ahmed Zewail, who passed away on this day in 2016.\n\nProfessors and students of Zewail Education City organized a visit to his cemetery in the 6th of October City, Giza, as an annual tradition, which his students and associates of the university, which remained his dream until it was fulfilled a few years before his death, did not witness the graduation of its first batches.\n\n7 years ago, he left our world who said: “Curiosity is everything the world revolves around: revealing hidden secrets,” femto-chemist Ahmed Zewail, so that Egypt lost one of its prominent landmarks.\n\nBorn February 26, 1946, Zewail is married, and has four children.\n\nHe is an Egyptian scientist, known as the “father of femtochemistry”, he won the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on femtochemistry and became the first Egyptian scientist to win a Nobel Prize in a scientific field. He is the Linus Pauling Chair Professor of Chemistry, Professor of Physics, and the director of the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nHe was brought up in Disuq, and received his first degree from the University of Alexandria before moving to the United States to obtain his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter some post doctorate work at the University of California, Berkeley, he was awarded a faculty appointment at Caltech in 1976, where he has remained ever since.\n\nZewail’s key work has been as the pioneer of femtochemistry—i.e. the study of chemical reactions across femtoseconds. Using a rapid ultrafast laser technique (consisting of ultrashort laser flashes), the technique allows the description of reactions on very short time scales – short enough to analyze transition states in selected chemical reactions.\n\nAwards and Honors\n\nIn 1999, Zewail became the third Egyptian national to receive the Nobel Prize. Zewail gave his Nobel Lecture on “Femtochemistry: Atomic-Scale Dynamics of the Chemical Bond Using Ultrafast Lasers”. His prize was following Egyptian President Anwar Al-Sadat (1978 in Peace), Naguib Mahfouz (1988 in Literature).\n\nOther international awards include the Wolf Prize in Chemistry (1993) awarded to him by the Wolf Foundation, the Tolman Medal (1997), the Robert A. Welch Award (1997), the Othmer Gold Medal in 2009 the Priestley Medal from the American Chemical Society and Davy Medal from the Royal Society in 2011. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2001.\n\nIn 1999, he received Egypt’s highest state honor, the Grand Collar of the Nile.\n\nZewail was awarded an honorary doctorate by Lund University in Sweden in May 2003 and is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Cambridge University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science in 2006.\n\nIn October 2006, Zewail received the Albert Einstein World Award of Science for his pioneering development of the new field femtoscience and for his seminal contributions to the revolutionary discipline of physical biology, creating new ways for better understanding the functional behavior of biological systems by directly visualizing them in the four dimensions of space and time.\n\nIn May 2008, Zewail received an honorary doctorate from Complutense University of Madrid. In February, 2009, Zewail was awarded an honorary doctorate in arts and sciences by the University of Jordan.\n\nIn May 2010, he received a Doctorate of Humane Letters from Southwestern University. In October/2011 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Glasgow, UK His students include scientists like Martin Gruebele. He also has won the King Faisal award in 1989. The Zewail city of science and technology is named in his honour."
