        "text": "MSU Research Foundation Professor, Marcos Dantus, is the 2023 recipient of the prestigious American Chemical Society (ACS) Ahmed Zewail Award in Ultrafast Science and Technology.\n\nThe award, sponsored by the Ahmed Zewail Endowment Fund established by the Newport Corp. (a supplier of photonics technology and products), recognizes outstanding and creative contributions to fundamental discoveries or inventions in ultrafast science and technology in the areas of physics, chemistry, biology or related fields.\n\n“I am honored and very excited to be recognized by this award,” said Dantus, who holds joint appointments in the Department of Chemistry and the Department of Physics and Astronomy in the College of Natural Science at Michigan State University.\n\nDantus is a pioneer in the use of spectrally and temporally shaped ultrafast pulses and the inventor of revolutionary laser optimization instruments. His research utilizes ultrafast lasers to explore high-energy chemical reactions, detect cancer, and trace explosives. Dantus is incorporating computer-controlled lasers to speed up advanced photonic materials characterization by orders of magnitude.\n\nDantus was recognized as a MSU Research Foundation Professor in 2015."
