Schatz Awarded the Ahmed Zewail Prize in Molecular Sciences

November 1, 2018

George Schatz was awarded the Ahmed Zewail Prize in Molecular Sciences. This prize is sponsored by the journal Chemical Physics Letters.

George is being recognized for his outstanding contributions to the theory and understanding of gas-phase reaction dynamics, plasmonics, and nanostructured materials. The prize, which is awarded on a biennial basis, was developed by Elsevier to honor Nobel Laureate Professor Ahmed Zewail, a longtime editor of Chemical Physics Letters. The award consists of a monetary award of $20,000 and a medal.

George will deliver a lecture at the Ahmed Zewail Prize Award Symposium (location to be announced). He is the 7th winner of this international award, with other recent luminaries including Michael Graetzel and Sir John Meuring Thomas.
