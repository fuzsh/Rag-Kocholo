        "text": "(1207-Nov. 16, 1231). Medieval saint. She was born at Pressburg (Bratislava), Hungary, the daughter of King Andrew II of Hungary and his queen, Gertrude. In 1221 she married Louis IV, the Landgrave of Thuringia. Elizabeth came under the influence of the Franciscans. After the death of her husband on Sept. 11, 1229, she joined the Tertiaries (Third Order) of the Franciscans at Marburg, Germany. She lived a most austere life, wore the poorest of clothes, existed on the scantiest food, gave all her income to charity, and took care of the sick. She died at Marburg, and was canonized by Pope Gregory IX on May 27, 1235. Many hospitals throughout the world are named in her honor. Elizabeth and King Louis IX of France are the patron saints of the Third Order of Franciscans. Her life is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on Nov. 19."
