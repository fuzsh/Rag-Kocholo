        "text": "RESPONSORIAL PSALM: I will bless the Lord at all times!\n\nTODAY’S MASS INTENTION: Karen Therese Wiltman, by Phil & Julie Lucchese\n\nMASS INTENTIONS FOR THE COMING WEEK:\n\nFROM THE DESK OF FR. BONA: Saint Elizabeth was the daughter of King Andrew II of Hungary and Gertrude of Merania. According to tradition, she was born in Hungary, possibly in the castle of Sárospatak or Pozsony on 7 July 1207. At the age of four, Elizabeth was brought to the court of the rulers of Thuringia in central Germany, to be betrothed to Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia (also known as Ludwig IV). In 1221, at the age of fourteen, Elizabeth married Louis; and the marriage appears to have been happy. In 1223, Franciscan friars arrived, and the teenage Elizabeth not only learned about the ideals of Francis of Assisi, but started to live them. Louis was not upset by his wife’s charitable efforts, believing that the distribution of his wealth to the poor would bring eternal reward; he is venerated in Thuringia as a saint, though he was never canonized by the Church. After the untimely death of her husband in 1227, Elizabeth left the court at Wartburg and moved to Marburg in Hesse. There she made private solemn vows similar to those of a nun. She continued to exercise her charity: she built a hospital at Marburg for the poor and the sick with the money from her dowry, where she and her companions cared for them. In 1231, Elizabeth died in Marburg at the age of twenty-four. She was canonized in 1235 and is honored by the Third Order of St. Francis as its patroness. Happy Feast-day of St. Elizabeth! God bless! Fr. Bona\n\nThe weekly television Mass produced by the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland is moving to a new TV channel and new time slot.
