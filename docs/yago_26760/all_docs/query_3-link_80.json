        "text": "Overview\n\nTitle social-status\n\nDuchess of Slavonia\n\nDate of Death\n\n1296/97\n\nBiography\n\n(See also Genealogical Table(s): 2.2.)\n\nThomasina Morosini was the daughter of Michele Morosini of a prominent Venitian family. She married Stephen, the youngest son of Andrew II and his third wife Beatrice dâEste, who was born in Germany after his fatherâs death. Beatrice had been accused by the ArpÃ¡ds of adultery, so Stephen was not recognized as legitimate. But after the death of Ladislaus IV without an heir, king Andrewâs son by Thomasina was declared legitimate by Hungarian prelates and barons and he succeeded Ladislaus (his first cousin once removed) as Andrew III. Andrew invited his mother to come to Hungary from Venice in late 1292 or early 1293. The official sent to receive her was captured by rebels but he was rescued by a Croatian aristocrat, Radoslav Babonich, at some cost, who finally brought her into the kingdom, as Ladislaus describes in a letter (CDCr 7.146-48, #128, dated 1293, July 11). Shortly thereafter a court was organized around her with her own officials."
