Gertrude of Merania (1185 &ndash; September 24 1213) was the first wife of Andrew II, king of Hungary. She was the daughter of Berthold IV, Duke of Merania. Her sister was Agnes of Merania, a famous beauty, who married King Philippe Auguste of France. Yet another sister was St. Hedwig of Andechs.

She and Andrew married before 1203, and she was the mother of his successor Bela IV of Hungary and Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, wife of Louis, landgrave of Thuringia. Gertrude was killed in 1213, by the Hungarian noblemen, who were jealous over the advancement of her relatives at court. While the king was in battle, Gertrude gave out Hungarian land as "gifts" to her German relatives. 1/3 of the country were gifts but the Hungarian got it back after the queen's death. Thus, Hungary did not prosper and the queen acted as a dictator. The Hungarian nobles had enough and in 1213 while hunting, she was killed. Due to the current political situation most of her murderers remained unpunished during the rule of Andrew II. Only Gertrude's son BÃ©la IV took revenge after elevated to the throne.
