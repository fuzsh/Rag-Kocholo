Andrew II (born 1175—died Oct. 26, 1235) was the king of Hungary (1205–35) whose reign was marked by controversy with barons and the great feudatories and by the issuance of the Golden Bull of 1222 (q.v.), which has been called the Hungarian Magna Carta.

The son of Béla III, Andrew succeeded László III, his elder brother’s son, on the throne in 1205. Powerful landed interests forced Andrew to spend royal funds so recklessly that the crown was soon impoverished and dependent on the feudatories, who soon reduced Hungary to a state of near anarchy. Objecting to the prodigality of the German followers of Andrew’s first wife, Gertrude of Meran, rebellious nobles murdered her in 1213. Four years later, with an army of 15,000 men, Andrew set off on an ill-fated Crusade to the Holy Land. After his return the barons forced him to agree to the Golden Bull, which became an important source of the Hungarian constitution. It limited royal rights and prerogatives, confirmed basic rights of smallholders and nobles, guaranteed justice for all, and promised to improve the coinage. Under it, nobles had the right to resist by force any royal decree.
