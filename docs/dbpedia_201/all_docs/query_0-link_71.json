        "text": "\"When discussing the topography of Athens, one thinks first of all of Judeich (1931) and Travlos (1971), still an inevitable point of departure for any attempt at a synthesis. And such an attempt would still not be possible without recourse to other invaluable texts by Wachsmuth, Milchhöfer, Cavvadias and Kawerau, Dörpfeld, Della Seta, and Graindor, to mention only a few of the protagonists of investigations on ancient Athens, or without the analytical work carried out by the Americans on the Agora, by the Germans on the Kerameikos, and by the Greeks on the Acropolis and in the city – especially during the building of the subway –, or the excellent general overviews by Camp (2001) and Etienne (2004). This study has the ambition of representing the topographical history of Athens without neglecting the contribution of a whole range of disciplines and viewpoints, and without forgetting to take account of written sources, not only per se, but in the light of the variety of interpretations resulting from different approaches - anthropological, political-historical, economic and religious. It is hence not a mere update, but a work that intends to rethink the history of the Athenian urban space employing new approaches and critically verifying all the opinions put forward in earlier studies. The book includes many photographs and images - almost all reworked -, which make it easier to follow the text. In addition to these, in the outer pockets of each volume are detailed area plans and, in the fourth volume, a general archaeological map of the Asty.\"\n\nSection I of this paper briefly presents the new Erechtheid monument, with particular attention to the epigram. Section II attempts to place the monument in its original archaeological, literary and historical context. Part A offers a summary review of what is known of other early fifth century Athenian monuments to the city’s war-dead. Part B considers other epigrams associated by ancient sources or in the archaeological record with Marathon, and especially the fragmentary poems on IG I3 503/504 (the city cenotaph). Part C considers the larger question of the Athenian presentation of the battle, both immediately after it took place and in the wake of the invasion of 480–479 BCE, and attempts to place potential readings of the Erechtheid epigram in that context. Finally, Section III asks what recalling Marathon through the epigram may have meant to Herodes Atticus and his peers. The conclusions that emerge have as much to do with the fragility and contingency of the interrelated processes of reading and remembering as they do with the Battle of Marathon itself.\n\n\"When discussing the topography of Athens, one thinks first of all of Judeich (1931) and Travlos (1971), still an inevitable point of departure for any attempt at a synthesis.
