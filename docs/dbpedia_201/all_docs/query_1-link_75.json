Where necessary, there is discussion of legal and/ or moral aspects of the problems in question. Com­ ment is offered, where it has seemed helpful, on controversial readings and textual difficulties. The Drama of the period, espe­ cially the Comedies of Aristophanes, makes allusion to certain cases of the treatment of hostages or prisoners of war, and, ct^hei^e possible, these allusions are indicated and examined. Where it is of particular importance, Thucydides' own opinion, or that of the general public, is investigated. The basic conclusions drawn are that during the Peloponnesian War the treatment of captives, with certain exceptions,grewprogres ­ sively harsher as the intensity of the conflict heightened, but that the treatment of hostages did not follow the same pattern. In the matter of hostages, each case was conducted in accord with the function of those particular hostages, and the outcome was dependent on the prevailing circumslances. In other words, the treatment of captives, under tke * customary law of war*, was generaJiy cruel, and in some cases brutally inhumane, while the treatment of hostages was, in relative terms, far more moderate.

The Peloponnesian War was no exception, for during this war, as the historian referring to the civil strife in Kerkyra emphasizes, mode­ ration was held to be a cloak for unmanliness... frantic violence be­ came the attribute of manliness... and the advocate of extreme mea­ sures was always trustworthy?).’ More or less the same tendencies were displayed as regards the treatment of captives on both sides. There were exceptional instances of humane conduct towards the captured enemy, whether an individual or a group, and merciful treatment of whole cities, either as acts of clemency or simple political expediency; but in many more cases both the belligerent powers and their allies displayed a cruelty and inhumanity, whose magnitude corresponds to the magnitude and im­ portance of the Peloponnesian War itself, which in Thucydides’ view was the greatest disturbance between Greek and Greek up to that time.’ Throughout the course of hostilities, beside ill-treatment of prisoners, enslavement, executions, massacres and calculated e^o^s at depopulation were inHicted in many cases upon the defeated by the victorious side after an encounter. There is some controversy concerning the way in which the treat­ ment of captives developed during the War. It appears from the evi­ dence that this treatment grew progressively harsher as the inten1 ni82.2. Cf. Gomme. H.C.T., ad loc.. andonin.84. (vol.

But doser examination is necessary. Thucydides mentions that at the beginning of the War all those ' whom the Lacedaemonians captured at sea were treated by them as I enemies and slaughtered indiscriminately, whether they were allies of ' Athens or neutrals? On that point Gomme argues that «the Athe­ nian threat to loll the Spartans taken in Sphakteria if the Peloponne-. sians invaded Attica was on the same level, morally»,® and again: «the Lacedaemonian prisoners from Sphakteria were hardly better treated, for they were hostages for Spartan behaviour» * But it ‘ seems to us that only an extreme moral formalism could justify such ' a moral judgement, which would allow one to identify or even com- ' pare acts which were so different in their outcome. The morality of motives here appears to be almost irrelevant, in view of the consi- ‘ dcrable distinction to be made between the decision to kill captives which was finally carried through,' and the threat to kiU captives which finally remained only a threat.® In retaliation against the Spartan decision, the Athenians and their aUies behaved with even more cruelty towards the enemies whom they captured. Thus in the very chapter in which Thucydides tells us of the Spartan decision, there is an early instance of Athenian reprisal against captives; «The Athenians slew them all the same day, J 1. Q o m m ©, a.C.T. on L30.1, comments with justification i «to sell as slaves * or kiU firee men who had surrendered after a siege was a practice which became common m Recourse of the war», and oaIV.57.4: ttlhe’customs of war’were becoming grimM, as the fighting progressed)).

On the con­ trary, P. D u c r e y, ic traitement desprisonniers de guerre dans la Grice antigue, Paris 1968, p. 335, believes that aau cours du conflit lai-meme, il paralt illusoire de vouloir distinguer une evolution dans le sens de la moderation, mais ihversement, on chercherait cn vain, nous semblc-t-fl, le signe d’un durdssement systematiquen.

Violence led to farther violence, and the Plataians were later punished in a similar and even worse way by the Spartans.* The view that the treatment of prisoners became progressively more violent as the war took its course gains substance if we exa­ mine the way in which subdued enemies were treated en massed The Mclian massacre* for instance took place eleven years after the Mytilenean revolt® had been moderately punished by the Athenians. The Peloponnesians and their allies captured in Torone in 423 were later exchanged,^ while the Syracusan treatment of the Athenian captives in the quarries was much more cruel.® One year before the end of the War Lysandros killed all captured sailors, thousands of them, at Aigospotamoi. This marked the climax of cruelty towards captives in the whole War.* On the other hand, the fact that a number of captives, those of Sphakteria in 425, were only imprisoned by the Athenians and finally released, while prisoners taken previously had been put to death (e.g. Thebans in 431 and Plataians in 427) does not necessarily mean that this was an action of moderation and humanity or even an interruption 1.

It is only-shortly before the end of the War that we can distin­ guish a positive clement^ towards captives and the signs of some tem­ porary change of policy, mainly on the part of the Peloponnesians. In 406, after taking Methymna fay storm, the Spartan admiral K^likratidas, in answer to the demand of the allies to sell the Mefhymnians as slaves, declared: «As long as 1 am in command not a single Greek shall be enslaved.»® In another case one year later, Tysandros ((released all free - bom persons without exceptions.* But the change was not to last long: all captives taken later at Aigospotamoi were executed by the Peloponnesians,® Now again, in the last stage, the' struggle, as 6 u s o 11 points out, ((assumed the brutal character of a war of annihilation».® It is also true that, after their final victory over Athens, the Spar­ tans displayed an almost unexpected moderation towards their capi­ tulated enemies in spite of the. insistence of their allies, espe^ally the Corinthians and the Thebans, that they should totally destroy the* City and kill the people? But it seems that the Spartans felt it was* necessary for them that public opinion should be on their side at this very point in time, when they were about to assume the hege­ mony of Greece, and a humane policy towards Athens was apparently the best means of gaining this support. Besides, it was naturi that the Spartans were content in being the final victors and they could now afford to be generous towards their defeated enemy. It 1. The great desire of the Spartans to regain those captives was, in fact, the strongest motive for the conclusion of the Peace of Hildas, which was then so ad­ vantageous for Athens. 2. Ducrey, Le traitcment, p.335, n. 2, cites an individual incident to support his argument against the view that the customs of war were becoming more savage as the fighting progressed: Salaithos, the Spartan envoy in Mytilcne, was captured and finally executed by the Athenians in 427 (Thue, in.36.1), while Tantalos, the Spartan commander in Thyrea, captured under similar circumstances in 425, was only imprisoned fThuc. IV.57.3). But an isolated case cannot be held to prove an argument; besides, the circumstances were not the same, and Tantalos had been wounded (afiCoWP*iOn ydp teTp©pivov.®» Thucydides rarely discussed moral .responsibility® but Ke was not indifferent to morals, as has been suggested.’ Of course, he was 1.

A quite different emphasis isgivenby G.E.M.de Ste Croix, TAe Origtrwof/AePdeponnesian IFor, London, 1972, pp. 18f, n. 35, in distinction between Th.’s attitude to morality within thepolisand that of inter-state relations. In support of this view A. Hands reminds us of Th.’s admiration for Themistokles in sp»te of the lat-\n\n-24-\n\nJ\n\npnmarfly an historian, not a philosopher; but he was a philosophizing 1 historian and ‘as such he was interested not only in the actions and J suffering of Copies and individuals historically, but also in the state I of their souls philosophically? . d Now a cldai-distinction ha?’to be made between individual fight- 1 ing men taReiS prisoner in hot blood, so to say, during a battle or an assault, and‘the population of a surrendered city. j The customary law,' the' unwritten laW, the dypapo^ vdpog^ of Greeks concenung especially the treatment of captured towns XhSt^ w^ taken by assault, is cruel. Xenophon represents Kyros as’;say-i/ ing to his soldiers that «it is an eternal law among men that, when’’ a city is taken from *a fitting enemy, both the inhabitants and theiif\" property belong to the captors».’ But'this law is sometimes trans?'| gressed for humanitarian reasons. CyrOs goes on to explain to^ his, 'I troops: «So it'is nof'duj^to an injustice, if you acquire such posses- | sion, but it is rather'due to benevolence, if you permit the enemy to- I keep anythin^).* . I But to,captives who voluntarily surrendered to their-enemy and 1 appeared to them as supphants, the unwritten law is more humane'. 1 Sometimes^ however, even in the case of voluntary capitulation, the I conditions imposed were extremely severe, as for instance in the case -I tor’s dubious conduct in inter-state affairs. The general view on that issue presented by G.E.M. de S.t e Croix is that Thucydides held that there was no such thing as an'international law^ parallel to the law that he did recognize within asinglecity-state. If prisonerswere trcatedin an outrageousway in dwar between twoGreekcity-states,that is regrettable, but there could be no infringement of any international law. See also D.

Compelled by hunger,, the Poteidaians surrendered to the Athenians, who were besieging them, but according to the dpo> Xoyio, together with their wives and children and vyith the foreign troops there, they had to leave their town; the men were allowed to have one garment, the, women two, and a certain sum of money,for their travel.® Then the Athenians colonized the evacuated town wfth their own citizens.® Again, the Plataians, after their surrender to the Spartans in 427, in their djghified appeal, pleaded with their captors for their lives, say­ ing among other things the following: «to grant .us our lives would be therefore a righteous judgement; if you consider also that we are prisoners who surrendered of their own accord, stretching out our hands for quarter, whose slaughter Hellenic law forbids...»* They also urged that if the Spartans acceded to the request of the Thebans* that the Plataians should ,be killed, they would do this to their own dishonour.® Their plea was in vain: in spite of the «v6n6?

Ducrey (La trail«m«nt, p. 268), who refers to the exchange of captives here, does not go further. 4. In the case that, as we think, the Salaminian captiv’es were not mai^r enough, there must have been more Athenian or allied captives from previous engagements trtio were given in exdumge, and all of them freemen, of course. 5. The problem of the constitutional atatus of the Salaminians remains, to our knowledge, unsolved. It seems that they were less than wholely Athenian citizois and more than subject-allies. Cf. K.3. Graham, Colony, p. 186, n. 6, and Com me, H.C.T. on U.23.3 (pp. 80 f.).\n\nwise the man-for-man exchange would have been impossible? Besi­ des, the event that the exchange of captives was agreed later and took place at Athens, allows us to conclude that not only prisoners taken exclusively in the North-west were exchanged. This exchange of captives is the first that Thucydides mentions since the beginning ol the Peloponnesian War.* On this occasion it is interesting to observe the practice of this special treatment of captives, that of exchange, during the first part of the War. From what Thucydides informs us, before the Peace of Nikias of 421 the only instances of exchange of captives are the one men­ tioned above (IL 103.1) and one part of V.3.4. All the other relevant quotations refer to one section of the negotiations of the Peace of 421, i.c. V.18.7, 21.1 and 35.5. It is clear that the two instances of exchange of captives before 421 cited by Thucydides refer to prisoners in the same number, dvi)p dvr* dvSpd?, and only to captives taken during a certain time of mi­ litary enterprises and at a certain place; on the contrary, all the other cases, i.e. those concerning the exchange of captives of the Peace of Nikias, generally refer to all the existing prisoners of both bel­ ligerents, taken in any place or time up to that point. But three cases only, of which the first two are similar, and different from the third, do not seem to offer sufficient evidence on which to base a general conclusion about ^distinct procedures^.*\n\n1. A. Ha nds notes that Androtion (Jacoby, P.GrJIUt., 324, F. 44) could affect the force of this argument. 2. Later on he mentions more: cf. V.3.4; V.18.7 (and again in V.21.1) and V. 35J, all of them in the same Book. 3. D u c r e y, Le traittmtnt, pp.268 f.,discttsse3 the same problem and suggests the theory of adeux procedures distinctesn. It would be interesting, indeed, to be able to distinguish categories regarding the evolution of the practice of exchanging captives, if we bad more cases and, especially, information from each and every part of the Peloponnesian War. Ducrey, ibid., also speaks of ales bataiUcs de Patrai ct de Naupactc co 428», and refers to Thue, n.84.3, although these actions clearly took place in 429 (428 was the year of the exchange of captives).\n\n4- Captives during the Mytilenean Affair The Mytilenean affair appears in two phases: one, the Revolt of Mytilene, which started right at the beginning of the fourth year of the War, 428; the other, the Mytilenean Debate at Athens and the measures taken in 427. The whole encounter is presented by Thucydides (again with interruptions, like the Plataian affair) in Book III. 2-6, 8-16, 18, 25 - 50.' The resolution of this drama (indeed, the revolt, the debate and the punishment compose a historical drama) is dealt with by Thucydides shortly before the final phase of the Plataian affair, which is also the chronological order. In the spring of 428 the Mytilenean oligarchs, who were then very strong, thought the time was right for them to move a revolt against their Athenian «alUes» with the help of Spartans and Boiotoians for the following reasons: because the Peloponnesians had just invaded Attica; because now that the war was raging the Athenians were distressed by the plague and they also had lost Perikles, the great figure of their empire, a few months before. The Athenians were informed of the Mytilenean plan but they did not want to believe the information ;* nevertheless, they sent forty ships to blockade Mytilene and to begin action against her in case she still insisted on the defection. In the meantime «thc ten triremes of Mytilene, which happened to be serving with the fleet according to the provisions of the alliance were kept back by the Athenians and their crews placed under arrest».* This is the first mention of Mytilene1. Book in is of extremely vital importance. From its beginning until Chapter 85 three of the most significant events of the Archidamian and of the whole Pelopon­ nesian War are included; the Mytilenean affair, the second phase of the Plataian affair and the civil strife in Kerkyra. 2.

This obligation, 'Koxd xd 4ugpaxuc6v’, is expressly mentioned by Thucydides for the first time here, although\n\n— 49 —\n\nans kept in custody by the Athenians and, essentially, their first precautionary action against the defection? Thucydides does not mention the crews of these ten ships again; we shall discuss their probable fate later, commenting on in. 36.2 and 50.1? In the summer of the same year, on the occasion of the 88th Olympic Games, Mytilenean envoys were sent to Olympia and deli­ vered a speech before the Peloponnesian Assembly there, appealing for help; their request was accepted. But the Athenians unexpectedly sent a hundred new ships to the Isthmos in a display of power; the result of this was that the invasion of Attica was immediately called off and the Peloponnesian help to Mytilene was postponed. The Spartan Salaithos was sent in a galley during the winter to encourage the besieged. Then, in the spring of 427, forty ships sailed from the Peloponnese to help Mytilene against the Athenian blockade, but in the meantime Mytilene surrendered. So the Athenians overcame the two dangers they were most afraid of during the crisis, a revolt of more allies and the increase of the enemy fleet. Nevertheless, as J. H. F i n 1 e y, J r. observes, the Athenians had been badly frightened, and their fear remained as the undertone of the great debate which followed, on a fitting punishment for the revolted and captured dty.’ The main reason for the surrender of Mytilene was the fatal mistake of the Spartan envoy Salaithos, who, in agreement with the oligarchic rulers, gave arms to the commons; for as soon as the demos was armed, they pressed the ruling party to distribute the provisions, with the threat that, if they did not, then the demos themselves separately would come to terms with the Athenians and deliver the city.* So the government, knowing that they were unable to prevent this, and fearing that an agreement could really be concluded without them, agreed to come to terms with the Athenian general Paches and his army, on the understanding that ’‘’AGqvaioig g£v £^cTvat pouXeOoai nepi MuTtXqvalov, ditoTov fiv xi pouXcovrai’*,® and that «the Mytilenians should be allowed to send an embassy to Athens to plead the precise number of ships in all naval contingents has been given; ef.

Paches raised them up from their suppliant position, promising that he would do them no harm, and put them in custody on Tenedos until he learned what decision the Athenians would come to about them».* As we shall sec below more analytically, those oligarchic MytiIcneans, kept in custody on Tenedos, were later transported to Athens and finally, although surrendered unconditionally, were killed together with the Spartan envoy Salaithos and the other ringleaders of the defection*. In the meantime, the Peloponnesian squadron of forty ships, that was sent under admiral Alkidas to help the besieged Mytileneans,* learned the bad news of the surrender during their slow voyage; when they eventually put into Embaton in the Erythraia,® a whole week had already passed since the capitulation of the subject city.’ Alkidas, despite the attempts of an Elean, named Teutiaplos, as well as those of some exiles from Ionia and Mytilene who were par­ ticipating in the expedition, to urge him to remain there and to un­ dertake action, decided to sail back to the Peloponnese as soon as possible.* As if this mistake were not enough, admiral Alkidas «touch-\n\n1.

He was immediately given a lesson: «Upon his coming to anchor at Ephesus, envoys came to him from the Samians at Anaia, and told him that he was not going the right way to free Hellas in massacring men who had never raised a hand against him, and who were not enemies of his, but allies of Athens against their will, and that if he did not stop he would turn many more friends into enemies than enemies into friends. Alkidas agreed to this, and let go all the Chians still in his bands and some of the others that he had taken».’ The first question that arises here is how Alkidas was able to take many prisoners, since he avoided landing anywhere on enemy territory. The explanation is given by Thucydides himself: oOg Kaxa xXoOv eUlf|. and translates: «mcn with whips hastened on their way any who approached these li­ nes too slowly. Or perhaps, ‘who approached the place of execution too slowl/n.\n\n2. H.C.T., ibid. 3. IV.48.11 «^vto ydp ohtouc pctCKnfieovTdc sot ftXXooe ftysiw (Transl. Warner). 4.

But it is difficult to find any evidence whatsoever for such a hypothesis. Grote (Hut. of Gr., vol. VI, p. 637) believes that the enslavement of women and children was «a fate but too common in those daysn. 3. For another man for man exchange see Thue, n.103.1. Diodoros,who here follows Thucydides, ceases his narration with the transfer of the captives to Athens (Xn.73.3). 4. We cannot be sure how many exactly they were, as we are only given by Thu­ cydides the total number of captives, seven hundred, including the Peloponne­ sians. But, even if only half of them were non-Peloponnesians, the remaining, who were exchanged, can be considered «many» relatively to the number of the Athenian\n\n-101 — Thomas Arnold long ago gave a very satisfactory expla­ nation:^ that the Athenian prisoners may have fallen into the hands of the Olynthians after the defeat of Xenophon near Spartolos(Thuc. n. 19/ or after the Athenian recovery of Eion (Thue. IV. 7)’. His se­ cond argument, however, is stronger: he says: «Nor would it follow that the men thus exchanged were Athenian citizens: they may have been some of the partisans or allies of the Athenians, who had fallen into the hands of the Olynthians at different times since the first breaking out of the war».* Another point concerning the captives’ fate here is the following: what happened to those of the men in Torone, who had been on the Athenian side or at least not against them, and to their wives and children;® We think Thucydides himself indirectly gives the answer: his expression «they made slaves of the women and children of the Toronaians (V.3,4: «Kat tfflv Toptovafcav ywaTKO^ jiSv Kai jtaTSo? f|v5paTi65tcav») simply means «of women and children from Torone» and. of course, docs not imply «of aU women and children»« or «of captives whom the Olynthians could have. A. Hands thinks that this argument might be modified by consideration of Androtion (Jacoby, F. Gr. Hist., 37A),\n\nF. 44. 1. eOYKYAIAHZ, Oxford, 1832.on V. 3.4.

And if the suspicion is true,^ then those Argive oligarchs of the «fiffhi column» must have been brave enough, although not particularly able,* to plan a rising in support of the Spartan attack, in spite of the fact that three hundred men of their party had previously been taken as hostages by the Athenians.*\n\n1. This is probable, as the Spartan sacrificies for crossing the frontier fThuc. V.n6.1) showed; this in some modem historians* opinion (e.g. B u s o 11, Gr. Gesch., p.t270. n. 1) should be interpreted as a failure ol the remnant of the oligarchs to prepare the route for a Spartan attack with possibilities of success. However, the whole story may well have been only a provocation on the part of the demos. 2. Since the plan failed, perhaps through their own fault. 3. Cf. Grote, Hist, of Gr., Vl^, p. 139.\n\n-118-\n\n3. Melos The great event of the summer of 416 is the Athenian expedition against the Lakonian colony of Melos, one of the Kykladic islands? The events leading up to the dramatic enterprises of Athens against this small Dorian island are briefly as follows: at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, Melos and Thera were the only islands of the Kyklades outside the Delian League? Later, according to a Lakonian inscription, Melos made two contributions to Spartan war funds? Tn 426 Athens, under the command of the general Nikias, made an unsuccessful attempt to reduce it? From another inscription we learn\n\n1. Among the numerous, more recent, works on Melos and the famous Melian dialogue are the following: A.

But this suggestion has not been accepted by many modem scholars.* M e i g g s’ and Andrewes’ suggestions are much more convincing and probable. The former argues that the inclusion of Melos in the assessment of 425 implies that the island was to haw one more chance to submit to Athens without fighting, but she preferred to ding stub­ bornly to her independence and therefore she was attadeed and puni­ shed by Athens.® The latter, arguing about the choice of time for the atteck, maintains that the Athenians «were restless after the collapse of their plans in the Peloponnese and ready to take up anything offe­ red; which is no doubt true, and relevant for the mood in which they took up the opportunity to intervene again in SicHy the next year».* 1. i.G.

Meiggs regards as the causes of the aggression : (a) the Melian defiance of 426 (b) the restlessness of the Athenian demos (as Andrewes, H.C.T., on V.84.2, p. 157), and (c) AHtibiades* ambition. 6. H.C.T., on V. 84.2 (p. 157). Andrewes’ summary of the causes of the attack arc that Melos had (a) successfully resisted any pressure to submit to Athens at the beginning of the war (b) contributed (probably) to AUetdaa’ expenses in 427 (c) resisted Nikias in 426 (d) ignored the Athenian assessment 425 (e) (probably) done something in the immediate past which could bd ewwtrutd as provocation (V. 84.2, 89. nn.). He adds, howewr, that «to point these points out is not to justify\n\nAthens».\n\n— 120 — The events of the aggression, blockade and conquest of Melos are related by Thucydides who lays unusual emphasis on this episode.^ The Dialogue,* a masterly piece of writing unparalelled in Thucydides, is represented in a dramatic fashion.* The historian shows here his fellow (representatives of the Athenian imperialism, now at the beginning of its climax—the expedition to Sicily was to follow after one year) as displaying a unique cynicism, and contempt for the weak. To the courageous Melians, pleading in vain to be allowed neutrality, the Athenian envoys put it that might alone is right:* ^Submit to the stronger, or else’» The Melians refused to conform, the envoys returned to the army, and the generals ordered the blockade of the city. Then they left behind a contingent of their own citizens and of the allies, to besiege the place by land and sea, and returned home.* In the following winter the Melians, after having made two sud­ den sallies, and having taken part of the Athenian lines, were finally forced to surrender for the following three reasons: (a) reinforcements arrived from Athens and consequently the siege was now carried on more vigorously*, (b) there were acts of treachery from within the\n\nI.

This is why some scholars have argued about the way in which Thucydides presents (or rather does not present) the Melos story. One of them, A.E.

Captives Taken in Various Engagements Sicily\n\nin\n\n(1) In the summer of 414 the Spartan commander Gylippos, who had recently arrived at Sicily to help the Syracusans against the Athe­ nians, sent a detachment to take the fort Labdalon at the edge of the highland of Epipolai, above the city of Syracuse? The fort was in fact captured, and Gylippos put to death all Athenians who were taken inside? This was the first sign of Gylippos’ relevant activity in Sicily. It was the same Gylippos who was later to accuse the Athenians of cruelty and inhumanity,’ displayed previously in the Greek mainland.\n\n(2) In the summer of the following year 413 there took place a naval action within the harbour of Syracuse, in which Gylippos at­ tacked and took the forts of Plemmyrion.* The Athenians «sank eleven ships of the Syracusans and killed most of the men on board except for the crews of three ships, who were made prisoners.® Finally the Athenians lost the forts but won the sea - fight What the fate of these captives was we never learn. Diodoros who also mentions the sinking of the eleven ships docs not refer to captives at all.® 1. Thue. VI.97.5 and 98.2. 2. Thue, vn.3.4: «pApoc IXape 4v ndvtoc dxfeicreivevM.

Ducrey, Le iraitement, p. 68, n. 1, and p. 127. On the same day an Athenian ship that lay moored off the harbour was captured by the Syracusans (see Thue. Vn.3.5). This ship must have been capt­ ured without its crew; otherwise Ihuqrdides would have said 'aCrcoic AvSpdoi, as he does in cases of ships captured with crews on board : cf.

XIll.9.6. Diodoros (ibid.) says that both the Athenians and the Syracusans put up trophies, the former for their naval victory, the latter for the capture of the forts, while Thucydides (VII.23.4) tells us that the Athenians set up one trophy on the tiny island opposite Plcmmyrion and the Syracusans there, one for each\n\ncaptured fort.\n\n— 128 — More important than the sea-fight was the capture of the forts of Plemmyrion by the Syracusans, which cost the Athenians increased difTiculties in bringing in supplies and caused the first deterioration of their morale? Indeed, in this engagement the Syracusans under the command of the able Spartan Gylippos saw for the first time that the Athenians were not invincible? Here also «in the capture of the forts many men were killed or made prisoners? Diodoros, again, docs not mention any prisoners in the capture of the forts? On the contrary Plutarch has: «and he (sc. Gylippos) killed many men and took pri-\n\nsoners».*\n\n(3) Shortly afterwards, in the summer of the same year 413, the only damage that the Athenians managed to inflict on the Pelopon­ nesian reinforcements to Sicily was the capture of one of the ships with the crew on board: «The Athenians with twenty ships were on the look - out for them at Megara and captured one of their ships with its crew, but failed to overtake the others, all of which escaped and reached Syracuse».“ (4) Shortly afterwards, in the summer of the same year 413, the Syracusans defeated the Athenians in two naval battles at Syracuse. In the second of them, two Syracusan vessels, in the excitement of victory, went too near the Athenian ones and were destroyed; one of them was captured with its crew.’ But in the second engagement the Athenians lost seven ships and many others were disabled: «as for the crews, the Syracusans 1.
