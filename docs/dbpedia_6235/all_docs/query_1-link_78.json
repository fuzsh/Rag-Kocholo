        "text": "I wish I’d been present at the meeting where someone suggested Mark Wahlberg as a college literature professor steeped in Camus and Shakespeare. Can we also look forward to Michael Cera starring in “The John Wayne Story”? Rosie O’Donnell as Mother Teresa? How about Ben Affleck as Batman? But, no. Now I’m just being absurd.\n\nWahlberg, disgorging great knowing chunks of campus dialogue (you can tell he’s reaching when his voice gets all high and defensive), redefines the phrase “spectacular miscasting,” but this remake of the 1974 James Caan film written by James Toback still crackles with mordant cynicism.\n\nProfessor Wahlberg spends his days telling his writing students they’re all useless, except the one (Brie Larson) upon whom the gods of talent have smiled. At night he hits underground casinos, where his strategy at the blackjack table is to keep betting until cleaned out, then approach local loan sharks for more financing, and repeat.\n\nAs I asked when watching Christopher Walken make a career out of playing Russian roulette in “The Deer Hunter”: How did this guy manage to stay alive this long? Dispensing with the niceties, the action is boiled down to a single week, which will be the last of the prof’s life unless he delivers a quarter of a million dollars to the two dangerous dudes he owes.\n\nThe self-destructing nihilist movie is a favorite subgenre of mine, but the presence of Larson — a floral breeze unexpectedly wafting through one man’s inferno — creates a redemption possibility that means we don’t know exactly what kind of movie we’re watching until the end. While structurally uninteresting, the film is not, then, quite predictable. And thanks to the angular choices of director Rupert Wyatt (“Rise of the Planet of the Apes”), who fills the soundtrack with mind-messing stuff like reggae covers of Pink Floyd and a chorus singing Radiohead’s “Creep,” the film feels like a strangely intoxicating dance to the gallows.\n\nWahlberg’s Jim Bennett, it seems, simply wants to get killed, preferably with a lot of pain. He asks his rich mother (Jessica Lange) for the money, but doesn’t press. He refuses money from another loan shark (John Goodman) because he can’t abide by one condition: that he proclaim, “I am not a man.” Goodman, clad in a towel and encased in a quantity of flesh that would make Jabba the Hutt blanch, lays out the mechanics of the manly need for independence in what will soon be known — must be known! — as the “F - - You” speech.\n\nDialogue, we seem to have forgotten, matters, and the words — by the brutally funny screenwriter of “The Departed,” William Monahan — are electric eels, slithering and sinister and nasty. They sneak up and sting you, or sometimes tickle your toes. Lowlifes don’t actually talk this way? Yeah. But if only they did."
