        "text": "I find Mark Wahlberg to be one of those ‘hit or miss’ performers. He’s starred in some of my all time favourite movies, (The Departed/The Fighter) yet appeared in equal measures in those I most detest (TED – need I say more?). When I caught wind of the ‘The Gambler’, a fast-paced crime drama based on the 1970s classic, I had high hopes that it would deliver another strong performance from the unpredictable Wahlberg.\n\nThe film opens with the anti-hero Jim Bennett (Wahlberg) sitting by his grandfather’s deathbed. We do not know this yet, but Bennett is the male heir to one of the richest families in America. It is perhaps his own personal awareness of his ancestry wealth that encourages his expensive habit.\n\nFor despite his affluent upbringing, Jim Bennett has a dirty secret; an addiction that no amount of money can feed … he’s a gambler. When we see him next, he is throwing his money away in a seedy, underground casino. The cinematography Wyatt uses is almost ‘Fight Club’ esque, with harsh lighting and dramatic shadows used to convey the intensity in the room.\n\nAfter losing $120k in two hands, you think things can’t get any worse for Bennett – but his problems have only just begun. We soon learn that this isn’t the first bad hand he’s suffered, as he already owes $240k to the Casino boss. On top of this, he owes a further $50,000 to a ruthless loan shark, accompanied by a complementary interest rate. With only seven days to clear the total debt, the storyline is born …\n\nJump back to reality and we discover that Bennett leads a fairly modest life as an English teacher. He does his best to keep his other life hidden from his students, but can’t contain his self-professed arrogance which breaks out in his classroom manner more and more frequently as his money problems spiral further out of control. Despite his unorthodox teaching methods, his students feel an attachment to him (pity perhaps) and act as his sole support unit throughout the film. From the blonde belle who lends her ear and her heart to the basketball star who rigs his game to help Wahlberg’s character win a bet.\n\nThe loan sharks are at a loss of their own, as they struggle to find a bargaining tool to threaten Bennett with. He is a man who does not care about anything – least himself.\n\nThe Gambler shamelessly plays into traditional stereotypes. From the Chinese operated casinos to the Black African Americans at the heart of the city’s corrupt underground. Then there is Wahlberg himself, portraying the spoilt white rich kid. Bennett is an individual that you are clearly meant to dislike, but I don’t know if this necessarily has the desired impact that the writers were going for.\n\nOn a whole, the character’s lack any kind of originality. This, in turn, makes it difficult for the viewer to engage with the storyline, as there is nothing particularly compelling to hold one’s attention.\n\nFollowing a stroke of gamblers luck, Bennett finds himself flush with cash again. The director should have begun to wrap things up here, but in the penultimate scene as if to prove that he really is incurable, Bennett bets all the money he has on blackjack. Granted, he wins and doubles his money, but rather than feeling joy or relief on his part, I couldn’t help but think ‘WHAT A DICK?!’.\n\nI won’t even attempt to disguise my disappointment with this film. The acting was bland, the storyline poor and worst of all, Wahlberg was lacking in muscles! It’s only saving grace was the soundtrack which is an electric mix of the nineties and noughties (think Pulp meets M83). Given the choice, I’d prefer to download the music to my iPod than sit through nearly two hours of nonsensical garbage again. Avoid if you can!"
