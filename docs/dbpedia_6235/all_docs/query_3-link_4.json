        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Last summer, Mark Wahlberg called James Caan to tell him that he was going to play the lead in a remake of “The Gambler,” the 1974 film that starred Mr. Caan.\n\n“It was a respect thing,” Mr. Caan explained, adding that the conversation didn’t end there. Mr. Wahlberg told him that he and the new movie’s director, Rupert Wyatt, had discussed the possibility of casting Mr. Caan as a thug in the updated version. “What a horrible idea, a ridiculous distraction. Me, I thought, ‘Why even remind them?’ Then I think both came to their senses.”\n\nMr. Wahlberg, 43, and Mr. Caan, 74, have been friends since they met in 1999 on the set of “The Yards.” Mr. Caan played the corrupt owner of a company that repairs railway cars, and Mr. Wahlberg was his nephew, a soft-spoken ex-con hoping to turn his life around. At the time, Mr. Wahlberg was still relatively new to film, and he gravitated to the older actor, celebrated for his roles as charming bruisers in “The Godfather” and “Thief,” among other movies. Later, when Mr. Wahlberg invited Mr. Caan to his house for dinner, there on the wall alongside a collection of photographs of Mr. Wahlberg’s favorite masculine heroes — James Cagney, John Garfield, Steve McQueen — hung a beautiful shot of Mr. Caan from “The Gambler.”\n\n“I got it a long time ago,” Mr. Wahlberg said. “But he thought I’d just put it up there for the day because he was coming over.”"
