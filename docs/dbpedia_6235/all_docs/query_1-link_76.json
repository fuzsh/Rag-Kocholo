        "text": "The Gambler\n\nWould you take a class on the modern novel from this man?\n\n(Paramount Pictures)\n\nMark Wahlberg doesn't know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em.\n\nWahlberg's remake of the 1974 classic \"The Gambler\" is meant to be a breakout, a meaty role that showcases his strengths as a dramatic actor, but it comes off as more of a vanity project that exposes his limits. It's slick and moves quickly through the overworld/underworld of a rich compulsive gambler without getting anywhere the depths to which it aspires. And hey, the music is great and those sunglasses Wahlberg wears are really cool.\n\nWahlberg plays Jim Bennett, a hip L.A. cat with an amazing haircut who leads a double life: during the day, he's the world's most pretentious English professor. At night, he's the world's most reckless gambler. Old Double-or-Nothing, they call him at the high-stakes games run by Mr. Lee (Alvin Ing) in empty mansions at the beach and behind the kitchens of Korean restaurants. He's also, as someone helpfully points out, \"the grandson of the 17th-richest man in California,\" an alienated rich kid who runs headlong toward trouble.\n\nThe death of his grandfather sends Jim on a gambling bender, and he goes straight from the service into deep-down debt, first with Mr. Lee and then Neville Baraka, who loans him $50,000 (\"plus 20 points\") that he promptly loses. This becomes a pattern, borrowing from his mother (Jessica Lange, fierce and fabulous) and yet another gangster, Frank (John Goodman, respledent as a pasha in a steamroom), and blowing the money before paying it back. It's almost as he has a death wish, or, as he helpfully explains, \"Life's a losing proposition. Might as well get it over with.\"\n\nA countdown begins, superimposed in big numbers on the screen. Jim has seven days to pay Mr. Lee, and seems to have no interest in doing so. (He has enough money, in cash, and goes to a casino and starts playing $10,000 hands of blackjack. Lucky Jim.) He starts a romance with one of his students and tries to get another, a basketball star, to fix a game. No boundaries for Professor Wahlberg!\n\nWahlberg's best quality has always been his ability to project a quiet authority, street toughness in the service of greater good, whatever it might be. In \"The Gambler,\" that translates into blank looks and bitter wisecracks. He's hurting inside, and he doesn't care how he goes down. We get that, but it doesn't feel like there's anything at stake or much going on behind his eyes when he does bother to take his shades off.\n\nWahlberg is also a generous actor who can be part of a scene without dominating it. He was superb in the all-star team that was \"The Departed\" and allowed Christian Bale to upstage him all the way to an Oscar on his passion project, \"The Fighter.\" In \"The Gambler\" he does marvelous work with Lange, Goodman and Williams but flounders in his classroom scenes, flopping on a table or jumping on a desk while browbeating his dumbstruck students about Shakespeare and Camus.\n\nThe script is by William Monahan, an Oscar winner for \"The Departed,\" and it's from the All Criminals are Nietzschean Philosophers School of Screenwriting. Wahlberg can't have a simple conversation with Goodman -- \"you owe me some money/I'll pay you on Friday\" -- without everyone getting all pseudo-profound. Wyatt, the director of \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes,\" keeps the pace up and shows some nice touches with underwater imagery. He also had a major hand in the soundtrack, needle-dropping Dinah Washington and Bob Dylan at surprising moments.\n\nThe 1974 version of \"The Gambler\" starred James Caan and was written by James Toback, who used his experiences as a New York literature professor and gambling addict. Toback taught Dostoevsky and took a little of the Russian master's \"The Gambler\" for his own. Wahlberg's \"The Gambler\" is California Lite.\n\n\"The Gambler\"\n\nGrade: B-minus\n\nRating: R\n\nRunning time: 111 minutes\n\nPlaying at: Opens Dec. 24 for evening previews; Dec. 25 everywhere.\n\nCast and crew: Mark Wahlberg, Jessica Lange, Brie Larson, John Goodman, Michael Kenneth Williams, Alvin Ing, Richard Schiff, Dominick Lombardozzi; written by William Monahan; directed by Rupert Wyatt.\n\nThe lowdown: Wahlberg plays a compulsive gambler in a remake of a 1974 classic starring James Caan and stays at surface level, cool and composed.\n\n-- Jeff Baker"
