The Gambler is a 2014 American crime drama film directed by Rupert Wyatt. The screenplay by William Monahan is based on the 1974 film The Gambler, written by James Toback, which, in turn, is loosely based on Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel of the same name. The remake, starring Mark Wahlberg as the title character, premiered on November 10, 2014, at the AFI Fest,[5] and was theatrically released in the United States on December 25, 2014. It features the final film performance of George Kennedy before his death in 2016.

In August 2011, Paramount Pictures announced a remake of the 1974 film The Gambler with the original producers, Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff. Intended as a directorial project for Martin Scorsese, it was reported that Leonardo DiCaprio was attached as the star and William Monahan would write the screenplay.[6]

Scorsese left the project and filmmaker Todd Phillips was in talks to take over as of August 2012.[8] In September 2013, actor Mark Wahlberg and director Rupert Wyatt expressed interest in making the film.[9]

By October 17, 2013, Brie Larson was in talks to play the female lead role, alongside Wahlberg.[10] On January 15, 2014, Emory Cohen joined the cast of the film, playing one of the professor's students.[11]

Shooting began on January 20, 2014.[12] On February 3, 2014, Wahlberg was spotted on The Gambler set in Downtown Los Angeles.[13] On March 13, there was a basketball scene filmed in Los Angeles.[14]

On September 8, 2014, it was announced that Jon Brion would be scoring the music for the film,[15] while on October 27, Film Music Reporter revealed that Theo Green composed the score for the film.[16] Republic Records released a soundtrack album for the film on December 16, which features songs from various artists.[17]

The Gambler had its world premiere during the 2014 AFI Fest at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on November 10.[18] Paramount previously set the film for a limited release in the United States on December 19, 2014, for an Oscar-qualifying run strategy, and planned to expand the film on January 1, 2015.[19] But on December 5, Paramount announced the film would be released wide in cinemas on December 25, 2014, instead of the previous platform release plans.[20]

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 44% based on 144 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "Well-paced and reasonably entertaining in its own right, The Gambler still suffers from comparisons to the James Caan classic that inspired it."[23] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on reviews from 40 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[24] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C+ on scale of A to F.[25]

Bilge Ebiri of Vulture.com wrote: "Wahlberg grows into the part. He may not be right as a precocious, self-loathing intellectual, but he's very much at home playing a dickhead who's gotten in too deep. And as The Gambler becomes less about its protagonist's dashed intellectualism and more about the gathering danger of his predicament, the film gains power."[26]Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called it a slick and efficient remake, and "In nearly every scene, Wahlberg carries off the central role with what could be called determined elan."[27]Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film two out of four stars, saying: "Wyatt keeps the action coming at a fast clip, but watching Jim repeatedly pursue a path of self-destruction for reasons never made clear grows wearying."[28]

Jessica Lange's performance has received critical acclaim. TheWrap wrote that Lange had one of her "meatiest film roles in ages."[29] The Huffington Post described her performance as "ferocious" and capable of "knocking down William Monahan's profanity laced dialogue with gleeful abandon"[30] Also, the Boston Herald described her work as "strikingly memorable",[31] which Newsday, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and Indiewire have agreed with, terming her "affecting", "stirring", and "terrific".[32][33][34] James Berardinelli from ReelViews described her as "heartbreaking as the cold, rich widow who blames herself on some level for her son's failure."[35] Chris Nashawaty from Entertainment Weekly lauded her acting as effortless by saying "[she] can do icy in her sleep..."[36] Rex Reed from The New York Observer described her performance as "hard" and "venomous".[37] Peter Travers described her performance as "reliably superb".[28] Jeff Baker from The Oregonian stated that her acting is "fierce".[38] Indiewire suggested Lange as a contender for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[39]

One of the many complaints that I hear about this movie is that there aren't enough scenes of him gambling. It's called The Gambler so it logically should show a lot of gambling. But thats the thing. The whole movie is one massive gamble. It requires some rewatching and I strongly recommend attempting to actively track the money as you watch. But this isn't about money. Not even slightly. So let me clue you in to the point of this film: this is a suspense driven theatrical analysis of unparalleled genius.

I dont mean this as to say that the film itself is unparalleled genius. The film attempts to delve into the concept of being bored while being intelligent, the burden of natural talent, the depression of a lack of meaningful purpose and a test of intelligence where the wager is life itself and the payout is the nirvana of the culturally glorified individual.

After realizing that he has interest in Amy and a reignited spark for life Jim must then finish ahead of the house after he has gotten up with what he was truly gambling for. This is where the ideology if searching for genius becomes one of the most neccesary lenses to view the movie through as its at this point Jim is approached by one of the three sharks he owes money to and told to enlist the help of basketball GENIUS Lamar Allen. Jim takes out money on his life and is beaten severely for it and then we get one of the best speeches from Frank, one of my favorite characters in film ever. In this speech he talks about positions of power and the ability to truly be free, through self control and being realistic. He knows Jim cares about life now so in giving him the speech he also gives him money in an attempt to let him get out one last time. This is where the money counting becomes important. It's unknown just how much Jim had dexter bet in Vegas. There is a perfectly legitimate possibility that Jim still had some cash on him at the very end from the basketball game especially considering Dexter didn't take the 50k. So Jim not only might have beaten the house and found a purpose but also did it with the added bonus of a payout. This is speculation because it's unknown what was truly bet on the game.

Jim then runs away from the city symbolically leaving the lavish and coveted lifestyle to pursue true happiness having experienced what he was told happiness was. I think this film has gotten a bad rap because it's a literary movie with lots of theatrical elements such as monologuing and quips. I dont even have time to address everything important with how it was directed, filmed, cut. The coloring, the music, the symbolic nature of what some scenes represent on his journey to self enlightenment. It's quite unfortunate that this movie isn't appreciated more. It has quite a lot to say on the nature of being a human and what it means to be happy especially in a modern society and meeting the criteria of being its ideal image. I tend to watch this film as though I were enjoying Shakespeare. I am there for the complex ideas through fun dialogue and searching for things that are implied. This movie set out to, in a sea of over saturated spoonfed reboots, give the viewer a chance to feel intelligent. To try and beat the house and find the meaning in life.

If you're a film buff who enjoys films for the analysis and conceptualization then this film is worth a rewatch. Because it's attempting to figure out what it means to be a human when the ideal version of a human is killing you from the inside out. And it does a damn good job.

The Gambler series generated five Emmy Award nominations. Rogers made his acting debut in the original film The Gambler, which was a massive ratings hit that achieved critical success for CBS upon its original release on April 8, 1980. It was nominated for two Emmy Awards.

By popular demand, Rogers returned as Brady Hawkes in The Gambler: The Adventure Continues, which premiered in November 1983 on CBS. The film was an even bigger ratings success than the first and was nominated for an additional two Emmy Awards. The Gambler Part III: The Legend Continues followed in 1987 (also on CBS), and the Emmy-nominated fourth installment of the series, The Gambler Returns: The Luck Of The Draw, starring Rogers and Reba McEntire, aired on NBC in 1991. The series moved back to CBS for the 1994 finale, Gambler V: Playing For Keeps. The first four movies of the series were directed by Dick Lowry and the last was directed by Jack Bender.

Brady Hawkes is back in this rip-roaring sequel to The Gambler. When Brady's son Jeremiah is kidnapped by a vicious gang, the gambler and his sidekick Billy Montana saddle up to rescue him. With the aid of the quick-drawing Kat Muldoon (Linda Evans - Dynasty), the stakes couldn't be higher. Will this pair of aces with a queen kicker come out on top?
