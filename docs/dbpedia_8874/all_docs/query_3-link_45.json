        "text": "As a teenager, Corbin began learning guitar taking lessons from session guitarist Pee Wee Melton, going on to playing in a band, earning opening slots with Janie Fricke and Mel McDaniel. After finishing college, achieving a degree in agribusiness, Corbin married and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, US, where he began performing as a solo artist.\n\nAfter being put into contact with A&R senior director Joe Fisher, Corbin signed to Mercury's Nashville label in 2009, releasing his debut single, \"Little More Country Than That\" in July the same year. It reached the top 40 of the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. His self-titled debut album, produced by Carson Chamberlain, built on that success, with first-week sales of 43,000 copies. Following the release, \"A Little More Country Than That\" went on to reach number one on the Country Charts, the first male country artist's debut single to do so. The album reached number 10 in the US charts, number four in the Country Charts. With his fame building, he was invited to tour with Brad Paisley upon his world tour, began in May 2010.\n\n2010 really was a successful year for Corbin, being awarded for his sensational debut album with several awards. Corbin won 'New Breakthrough Artist of the Year,' 'Breakthrough Single' as well as 'Best Video by Breakthrough Artist' along with a whole host of nominations.\n\nHis debut album was followed by 2012's \"All Over The Road,\" which featured two top 40 singles, \"Lovin' You Is Fun,\" reaching number five and \"All Over The Road\" at number three."
