        "text": "What a great night! Thank you!! I've never attended a Rodeo, but was very excited to see Easton Corbin. Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate. My friends ended up canceling, as well as the rodeo. But Easton Corbin still played, and we danced in the mud under a full moon. It bonded my boyfriend and I, and gave us some time by ourselves to work though a problem area in our relationship. We left Shawnee stronger and better than ever. Thank you so much!!\n\nHad a great time at the rodeo with friends. Thank you so much for your support and generosity to me and our vetrans. The arena was wonderful and very personable. Bryon\n\nWhat's that old saying, \"This ain't my first rodeo?\"¬ù For us, it was. And it was great. The donors sure know how to throw a party. Non stop action. I would be hard pressed to pick my favorite event. Probably the bull riding. Ronald the Rodeo Clown kept everyone in stitches! The band was a comprised of a group of folks from Wyoming that did a great job with original songs they had written. These guys may be possible CMA winners in the future. You never know. Great event, great fun. Thanks VetTix and donors."
