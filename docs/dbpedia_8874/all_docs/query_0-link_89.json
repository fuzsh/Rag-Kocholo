        "text": "A native of Batesville, Mississippi, Rodgers grew up not only on 90’s country music, but on the work ethic demonstrated during those days by the people who surrounded him and the artist who inspired him – artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Merle Haggard, and Eric Church.\n\nWith the success of his Platinum-certified, No. 1 debut hit “Some Girls” and his follow-up Top 10 smash “Cold Beer Calling My Name,” Rodgers is in fact cementing his place amongst the future legends of the genre, finding that truth and toughness mixed in with a whole bunch of authenticity can form a career for even the most skeptical of artists.\n\nVisit Jameson Rodgers Website\n\nMore so than the massive physique that helped Stell become a collegiate basketball standout, the Platinum certified singer has proven via the songs he sings and the shows he puts on that he is far too powerful of an artist to ever fit into some sort of singular category. In fact, to describe Stell in a few words would be a complete disservice to the man he is and the artist he looks to become as he releases his new EP Better Than That on October 16.\n\nVisit Matt Stell’s Website\n\nJon Langston grew up in Loganville, GA, listening to music by his heroes Alan Jackson and the Eagles. He played football, eventually earning a Division 1 college football scholarship. Jon always thought football would be a part of his life, but after his sixth concussion left him blind for fifteen minutes, his football career ended abruptly. So, he picked up his guitar which he hadn’t touched since the eighth grade and re-taught himself how to play. Playing open mic nights and working on his songwriting eventually lead to the 2013 release of self-penned, “Forever Girl,” the first song he ever wrote. That release kicked off his music career which has culminated in sold out shows across the country and over 500 million career streams.\n\nJon opened for Luke Bryan on his Farm Tour in 2017, which was a full circle moment having attended as a spectator of the Farm Tour only a few years before in Athens, GA. He was invited to perform on the tour again in 2018 and joined Luke in support of his Sunset Repeat Tour in 2019. Jon signed a publishing deal with Sony ATV, management with KP Entertainment, and is the first artist signed under Luke Bryan’s new Label 32 Bridge Entertainment with EMI Records Nashville. Jon’s debut major label single, “When It Comes To Loving You” reached No. 1 on the all-genre iTunes Chart.\n\nVisit Jon Langston’s Website\n\nSinger/songwriter Kate Boytek hit the stage for the first time at her local county fair talent show at the tender age of five. Singing opportunities were few and far between in Kate’s tiny hometown of Logan, West Virginia, nestled deep in the Appalachian coalfields. However, Kate sang at dozens of local charity events, directed her church choir, and eventually attracted the attention of WV native and legendary Grand Ole Opry and Bradley’s Barn audio engineer Vic Gabany. Boytek is pursuing her dream in Nashville and has appeared with country hitmakers Easton Corbin, LOCASH, Drew Parker, Tyler Farr, Eric Paslay, Trick Pony, Little Texas, and others. Kate’s songwriting style is both fresh and contemporary and yet has echoes of the classic singer-songwriters from the 1970s.\n\nVisit Kate Boytek’s Website"
