We had fantastic seats and loved the concert!’n\n\nCedar City, UT@\n\nAmerica First Event Center\n\nCJ\n\nAugust 4th 2023\n\nI didn't go, but somehow I received this request for a rating. I can say I have been to at least 8 Easton Corbin concerts and they have all been absolutely amazing! He always knocks it out of the park at every concert. He's an amazing singer, HOT, funny, and kind. His music is pure country and some even current country. He's got something for all ages to listen to and enjoy. He's so fan friendly it's why he's loved so much. So I can only assume he and Loren (his guitarist) did a phenomenal job at the Grand Ole Opry House that night too! Just sayin....\n\nNashville, TN@\n\nGrand Ole Opry House\n\nPatricia\n\nJuly 29th 2023\n\nHe jas got to be the most exciting country performer he has all the crowd up and singing would definitely want to see more of him\n\nIndianola, IA@\n\nWarren County Fair\n\nCristian\n\nMay 23rd 2023\n\nEaston Corbin one of the best country music singers these days. I took my two sons and we had a great time. He played great songs and played for a good while. It was an awesome show. I hope he comes back to Texas soon. I highly recommend him in future events.\n\nRockwall, TX@\n\nHarry Myers Park\n\nApril 29th 2023\n\nBand and Singer were great. volume of sound was a little overwhelming. venue stage was too low so it was hard to see anything when crowd was standing. drink area was small creating long lines.\n\nJefferson, IA@\n\nWild Rose Casino & Resort\n\nSara\n\nDecember 16th 2022\n\nAs always, Easton put on a damn good show!!

He is a sweet and great person. It was good seeing him again. It was also good seeing Leorone Ellis again too. This was my 4th time seeing Easton since 2020. His shows keep getting better and better every time. Love always, Clarissa Aikman\n\nAlma, AR@\n\nAlma Performing Arts Center\n\nZach\n\nAugust 22nd 2022\n\nEaston is a great performer & entertainer. I've liked his music for years & really liked how he engaged with the audience during the concert.

All of the artists were totally awesome! Easton Corbin reached down and high five’d me and the guy next to me and I swore I heard Billy Currington say my name right before he started singing 🎤😊\n\nVentura, CA@\n\nSan Buenaventura State Beach\n\nPatty\n\nApril 28th 2019\n\nIt was an awesome event !! Got there at 5:00 and left at 11:00 . Job well done !! I loved Easton Corbin . I had a meet n greet with him a few years back . Great performer !! Love his music !! Good times !! 💙🎶💙🎶💙💙💙\n\nJacksonville, FL@\n\nMayport Beacon\n\nStephanie\n\nApril 28th 2019\n\nEaston always puts on a great show. The five stars are based solely on his show. Way less than excellent was the venue. Understaffed with bartenders. It shouldn't take 45 minutes to get a drink in a place that size. One bartender working at an upstairs bar that was packed is not enough. Poor planning/scheduling for a Friday show.\n\nTampa, FL@\n\nDallas Bull\n\nTroy\n\nFebruary 23rd 2019\n\nHe was fantastic and sounded great considering the acoustics for the venue and had great seats upstairs to see everything- first time at the beach as I have been to the flats a couple times and always enjoyed it🙏🤠🐴\n\nSan Diego, CA@\n\nMoonshine Beach\n\nJerry\n\nJuly 20th 2018\n\nThe music was great but started very late.

Loved the show though. Great music, very small and up close show. I have been to many many Easton shows and I think this was by far my favorite. 😍🤩\n\nDubuque, IA@\n\nQ Showroom\n\nTeyris\n\nJanuary 18th 2017\n\nThis was my fourth time seeing Easton Corbin and he never disappoints! He's such a great performer and his vocals are just as if you were listening to his Album! Brett Young and Morgan Wallen were also amazing, I loved that they threw some non-country covers in there to mix things up.\n\nColumbus, OH@\n\nExpress Live!\n\nLoel\n\nMarch 15th 2016\n\nEaston was great, his band was great, his people were great! The event center itself was unorganized and their sound system had bad feedback, and I've heard other concerts there, so I know what's what. Sad that Carrie, Easton, And The Swon Brothers didn't get the best venue to show their talent to Reno! Reno needs a better open air venue like Mountain View,CA or Wheatland, CA. Reno is really becoming a great family destination place to visit, so add an outdoor concert venue, and it would bring the place up a level.\n\nReno, NV@\n\nReno Events Center\n\nView More Fan Reviews\n\nEaston Corbin has been gracing stages with his memorable baritone and unique blend of traditional and modern country music for more than a decade. The Florida native, who boasts two No. 1 singles with “A Little More Country Than That” and “Roll With It,” embarks on a new musical chapter with his recent signing to Stone Country Records. Corbin teams with industry veterans Benny Brown, Paul Brown and Jason Sellers as the label’s flagship artist.\n\nCorbin says he and Music Row mainstay Benny Brown initially met and bonded over their mutual love of traditional country music. No stranger to the writing room himself, Corbin has penned songs with Sellers ahead of signing with the independent label. The singer, who has spent several years as an independent artist following nearly a decade with Mercury Nashville, says he’s in a great position being Stone Country’s flagship artist.\n\n“They let me do what I want to do and let me be me, which is very important,” the singer says.\n\nCorbin’s neotraditional sound shined on his debut label single “I Can’t Decide,” co-written by Corbin with producer Wade Kirby and esteemed writers Ashley Gorley and Rhett Akins. The soaring pedal steel combined with a driving beat and plucked guitar rhythms allows Corbin’s warm baritone to further accentuate the up-tempo song.\n\nThe Florida native continues to write with longtime producer Carson Chamberlain as well as Kirby, Shane Minor, Adam Craig and Wyatt McCubbin, who he penned the romantic wedding ode and current radio single “Marry That Girl” with. Corbin says the past three years have allowed him to focus more seriously on writing music and finding the message he wants to convey to listeners on his forthcoming project.\n\n“It’s about being authentic and that’s what I always focus on when I write or record,” he says. “I keep one foot in traditional and one foot in the modern and marry those two. That’s really been my motto through the years.”\n\nAnd he’s had a successful time doing so. Throughout his career, Corbin has amassed seven top 10 singles and three American Country Awards. Named Billboard’s 2010 Top New Country Artist, Corbin has never shied away from his traditional roots with Your Big Sky complimenting his “unapologetic and unwavering traditional country sound.” His self-titled debut album was named Country Breakthrough Album of the Year by iTunes Rewind Best of 2010 while American Songwriter has complimented the singer’s “warm, smooth-as-gravy-southern drawl.”\n\nAlong the way, Corbin hasn’t forgotten his roots. The young boy who grew up listening to Merle Haggard and George Jones with his grandparents remembers where he came from.\n\n“I do love traditional country music,” he says. “That sound is what drew me to country music as a genre. One of my very first records was a Merle Haggard album when I was a kid. The way he delivered a song, the emotion in his songwriting and in his voice, he was just the whole package.”\n\nCorbin most recently released his album Let’s Do Country Right - his first in eight years. The 14-song feat is a collection of new, yet-to-be-heard tunes, as well as previously released songs, like Corbin’s current radio single and streaming hit “Marry That Girl.” Since releasing with DSPs, the romantic ode has organically amassed an impressive 55 million+ streams collectively, and was featured on hit FOX reboot Joe Millionaire: For Richer or Poorer.\n\nOn radio impact, it was the No. 2 most added song by country stations, and was featured in a live performance by top daytime talk show The Kelly Clarkson Show, as well as fan-favorite syndicated iHeart radio show The Bobby Bones Show. Laced with Corbin’s warmly familiar baritone vocals, and layered with the true-to-his-roots production fans and radio love, the record offers something for everyone.\n\n“The record is a good mixture of that up-tempo and midtempo songs along with a few ballads here and there,” he says of Let’s Do Country Right.\n\nShow More"
