        "text": "American professional wrestler\n\nAllen Neal Jones[7] (born June 2, 1977),[1] better known by his ring name AJ Styles, is an American professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand and is the leader of The O.C..\n\nJones debuted in 1998 and competed for various independent promotions before gaining initial mainstream exposure in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 2001. He gained prominence after signing with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) having been described as \"the cornerstone of the company since its inception\";[6] he won the TNA World Heavyweight Championship twice, the NWA World Heavyweight Championship three times, and was the inaugural titleholder of the X Division Championship, which he won six times. He is also the first TNA Triple Crown and Grand Slam champion. Jones simultaneously appeared in Ring of Honor (ROH) from 2002 to 2006, where he became the inaugural ROH Pure Champion. Jones has also wrestled extensively internationally, in promotions such as New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), where he is a two-time IWGP Heavyweight Champion and the United Kingdom based Revolution Pro Wrestling (RevPro), where he is a former RPW British Heavyweight Champion.\n\nJones first appeared in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 2002, but declined a developmental contract. He returned to the company in 2016, and won the WWE Championship twice. With his second victory in Manchester, England, Jones is recognized by WWE as the first wrestler to win the title outside North America. At 371 days, he is tied with Randy Savage for the eighth-longest reign in title history.[8] He also won the United States Championship three times, the Intercontinental Championship and the Raw Tag Team Championship once each, becoming the second wrestler (after Kurt Angle) to become a TNA and WWE Triple Crown winner and first Grand Slam champion in both promotions, as well as the third man (after Brock Lesnar and Angle) to be both IWGP and WWE Champion.\n\nJones has been thought of as a pillar of the wrestling industry for over two decades, being respected by fans and co-workers, and is considered one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time.[9] He has headlined numerous pay-per-view events, including the respective premier events of WWE and TNA, WrestleMania and Bound for Glory. He ranked atop the annual Pro Wrestling Illustrated 500 in 2010, the first TNA wrestler to do so, was voted PWI Wrestler of the Year three times between 2016 and 2018, and Wrestler of the Decade in 2020. He also won 10 Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards, including Wrestler of the Year in 2015 and 2016, and was inducted in their Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen Neal Jones[7] was born at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina,[2] on June 2, 1977.[1] He grew up in poverty with an abusive, alcoholic father.[2] The family's poverty was such that they could not afford cable television, which resulted in Jones being unable to watch professional wrestling, his childhood passion.[10] He attended Johnson High School in Gainesville, Georgia, graduating in the class of 1996.[11] Jones took up amateur wrestling in high school and became a two-time state wrestling champion.[12] Jones then attended Anderson University in Anderson, South Carolina, where he was on a wrestling scholarship, and studying physical education.[13] He was then invited by some of his friends to try professional wrestling.[13] He entered a professional wrestling school because his friends were doing it and to find out whether he had a natural aptitude for it.[2] To supplement his income, he worked by mowing lawns and driving an ambulance.[13]\n\nProfessional wrestling career\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly career (1998–2001)\n\n[edit]\n\nJones was trained by Rick Michaels and debuted in 1998.[7] In the Georgia-based National Championship Wrestling (NCW) promotion he wrestled as Mr. Olympia, a masked wrestler, losing to Michael Brooks in his first singles match.[7] By August 1999, he had won the promotion's Television Championship.[7]\n\nFrom 1999 to 2001, he generally competed in less notable independent promotions. In December 1999, NCW merged with NWA Georgia to form NWA Wildside, and Jones was renamed A.J. Styles. He appeared sporadically even after signing with NWA-TNA, and is a former NWA Georgia Heavyweight Champion, having defeated Rick Michaels for the title on December 22, 2001, at Christmas Chaos.[7]\n\nWorld Championship Wrestling (2001)\n\n[edit]\n\nAtlanta-based World Championship Wrestling (WCW) had observed Styles' and Air Paris' program in NWA Wildside and offered each a contract in early 2001. Styles (renamed Air Styles) and Paris were placed in a tag team, which was named Air Raid. The team's gimmick saw both men dress in G-suits, with Air Raid also appearing on Thunder.[7] On the March 5, 2001, episode of Nitro, they were entered into a tournament for the newly created WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship but were eliminated in the first round by eventual winners Elix Skipper and Kid Romeo.[7]\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation appearances (2001–2002)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 9, 2001, Styles had his first WWF tryout match against his trainer, Rick Michaels, before the taping of Raw. Styles won with a Shooting Star Press but was not offered a contract.\n\nStyles made two more appearances for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 2002: on the January 26 episode of Metal (taped on January 21), in a losing effort against The Hurricane, and a dark match before the January 27 episode of SmackDown! (taped on January 22), where he was defeated by Rico Constantino. After these matches, WWF offered Styles a developmental deal contract, which would require Styles to relocate to Cincinnati, Ohio, where the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA) developmental territory was located. Styles ultimately declined the deal, as the move would interfere with his wife's college plans. Despite this, Styles wrestled one non-contracted match for HWA, on February 19 against Matt Stryker in a losing effort.\n\nIndependent circuit (2001–2002)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn October 26, 2001, Styles participated in All Pro Wrestling's King of the Indies tournament, defeating Jardi Frantz in his first-round match but was eliminated by Christopher Daniels in the quarter-finals the following night.[14] On November 13, 2001, Styles debuted in Xcitement Wrestling Federation (XWF), competing in a battle royal against Billy Fives, Christopher Daniels, Juventud Guerrera, Kid Kash, Prince Iaukea, Psicosis and Quick Kick for the XWF Cruiserweight Championship, but was unsuccessful in winning the title. Later that night, Styles defeated Josh Mathews in a match taped for XWF television. The following night, Styles was defeated by Daniels, again in a match taped for the XWF television program.\n\nStyles debuted for Australian promotion World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) on February 24, 2002, making his pay-per-view debut at The Revolution against Christopher Daniels, Low Ki, Shark Boy, Super Nova and Tony Mamaluke in a six-way cruiserweight survival elimination match, in a losing effort. On April 10, Styles faced Jerry Lynn and Super Nova in a three-way-dance, in a losing effort.[14] On April 12, Styles defeated Nova in a tournament semi-final match at The Eruption for the International Cruiserweight Championship. Styles progressed to the final later that night in which he defeated Jerry Lynn to win the title, which he vacated soon after.[7]\n\nOn March 2, Styles debuted in the East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA), entering the promotion's 6th annual Super 8 tournament. He defeated Xavier in the first round, as well as The Amazing Red in his semi-finals match, but was defeated in the final by Donovan Morgan.[15] On June 15, Styles debuted in Game Changer Wrestling, entering the Jersey-J Cup tournament. In the first round, Styles defeated Qenaan Creed, he then progressed to the quarter-final, defeating Colt Cabana. In the semi-final, he was defeated by Reckless Youth and was eliminated from the tournament.[15]\n\nIn October, Styles traveled to the UK, debuting in the Frontier Wrestling Alliance (FWA) on October 13, suffering a loss to Jonny Storm in his debut match at FWA: British Uprising.[15] On October 15, Styles was defeated in an FWA British Heavyweight Championship number one contender round-robin challenge three-way match by Doug Williams and Jerry Lynn at FWA: Seasons Beatings. Later that night, Styles defeated Jody Fleisch in the same round-robin challenge.[15] On November 1, Styles debuted in IWA: Mid-South, taking part in the promotions annual Ted Petty Invitational tournament, but was defeated by Christopher Daniels in the first round.[15]\n\nRing of Honor (2002–2006)\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly years (2002–2004)\n\n[edit]\n\nStyles debuted in Ring of Honor (ROH) at its third show, 2002's A Night of Appreciation,[16] and quickly became a main eventer (e.g., performing in main event matches against Low Ki for the ROH World Championship at Honor Invades Boston).[16] After failing to win the title, he became the first holder of the Number One Contender's Trophy, which was viewed within the promotion as a secondary championship at the time.[16] At the First Anniversary Show in February 2003, Styles competed against Low Ki and Paul London in a three-way match, which was won by London. After this, Styles competed by himself and defeated The Backseat Boyz (Johnny Kashmere and Trent Acid), The Carnage Crew (HC Loc and Tony DeVito), and The S.A.T. (Joel and Jose Maximo), to receive a title shot for the ROH Tag Team Championship. He chose Amazing Red as his partner, and the two defeated The Prophecy (Christopher Daniels and Xavier) to win the championship.[16][17] Styles then feuded with London, who was upset that he had chosen Red as his partner, wrestling to a draw at Night of the Grudges.[16] Styles and Red then defeated The Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark Briscoe) on three separate occasions, but lost to The Prophecy. At Wrath of the Racket, Christopher Daniels and Dan Maff put Red out of action and Styles picked Homicide as his replacement partner. Styles and Homicide beat The Prophecy,[16] but Styles had to vacate the title due to Red being sidelined by a legitimate injury.[17]\n\nAfter his reign as ROH Tag Team Champion, Styles took Jimmy Rave as his protégé and attempted to become the ROH World Champion, defeating Bryan Danielson at Main Event Spectacles to become the number one contender. At War of the Wire, Styles unsuccessfully challenged Samoa Joe for the title.[16] He then defeated CM Punk, Jimmy Rave, and Matt Stryker in a one-night tournament at the Second Anniversary Show to become the first ROH Pure Wrestling Champion.[16] Styles defeated Punk in a rematch with Ricky Steamboat as the guest referee at At Our Best for his final match for ROH in 2004,[16] as TNA withdrew all of its contracted wrestlers from all ROH events and ROH vacated the title.[18]\n\nFeud with Jimmy Rave (2005–2006)\n\n[edit]\n\nStyles returned to Ring of Honor at the Third Anniversary Celebration: Part Two to wrestle Jimmy Rave, who accused him of stealing the Styles Clash (which he called the Rave Clash) from him, though he was unsuccessful in defeating Rave.[16] During his feud with Rave and The Embassy, Styles formed an alliance with Generation Next, who were also feuding with The Embassy. At Glory by Honor IV, Styles defeated Rave with Mick Foley in his corner, with the stipulation that the loser could no longer use the Rave/Styles Clash in Ring of Honor.[16] At This Means War, he defeated Generation Next leader Austin Aries, who was attacked by The Embassy following the show. At Vendetta, Styles had his final match against The Embassy when he, along with Austin Aries, Jack Evans and Matt Sydal were defeated by Abyss, Alex Shelley, Jimmy Rave, and Prince Nana in an eight-man tag match.[16]\n\nFollowing his feud with The Embassy, Styles set his sights on winning a championship. At A Night of Tribute, Styles faced Christopher Daniels and Matt Sydal in a three-way match, which Daniels won. On the first show of 2006, Styles wrestled and defeated Matt Sydal, after which the two agreed to form a tag team and challenge for the ROH Tag Team Championship, which was held by Sydal's Generation Next teammates Austin Aries and Roderick Strong. Before receiving a shot at the tag team title, Styles received a shot at the ROH World Championship when he was handpicked by Bryan Danielson, but he was unsuccessful.[16] At the Fourth Anniversary Show, Styles and Sydal received their shot at the ROH Tag Team Championship, but were unable to defeat the champions.[16]\n\nAfter an absence, Styles returned at Death Before Dishonor IV, defeating Davey Richards. Styles returned at Time to Man Up, losing to Samoa Joe.[16] In a pre-taped promo, Styles said he would be taking several months off from ROH following the match; however, ROH commentators continually referred to the match as his final match and even played a special tribute to him after it.[19]\n\nTotal Nonstop Action Wrestling / Impact Wrestling (2002–2014)\n\n[edit]\n\nNWA World Heavyweight Champion (2002–2004)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May 2002, Styles was signed to a non-exclusive contract by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). He appeared on the first weekly TNA pay-per-view, teaming with Low Ki and Jerry Lynn and losing to The Flying Elvises (Jimmy Yang, Jorge Estrada and Sonny Siaki).[7] The following week, Styles defeated Low Ki, Jerry Lynn and Psicosis in a double elimination match to become the inaugural TNA X Division Champion.[7] He won a second title on the third TNA pay-per-view, teaming with Lynn and defeating Bruce and Lenny Lane in the finals of a tournament for the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship.[20] Styles successfully defended both titles in the following weeks but began to bicker with the veteran Lynn during their matches together. On August 7, Styles lost the X Division title to Low Ki in a three-way dance also involving Lynn.[14][unreliable source?] The following week, he and Lynn fought Jeff Jarrett and Ron Killings to a no contest, and the tag team title was held-up as a result.[14] The following week, he and Lynn fought one another in a Falls Count Anywhere match (which was won by Lynn), a no disqualification match (which was won by Styles) and a ten-minute Iron Man match, which ended in a draw after both men scored three pinfalls.[14] On August 28, Low Ki defended the X Division Championship against Lynn and Styles in a ladder match and lost the title to Lynn.[14] Recruiting Mortimer Plumtree and Sonny Siaki as allies, Styles continued to feud with Lynn in successive weeks.[14] On October 23, he defeated Syxx-Pac for the X Division Championship,[7] but lost the title to Lynn on November 6 and tried unsuccessfully to regain it throughout the remainder of the year.[7]\n\nIn 2003, Styles began focusing on the NWA World Heavyweight Championship when, after defeating David Flair on January 15 to become the number one contender, he recruited the help of Larry Zbyszko and associated himself with Vince Russo's Sports Entertainment Xtreme (S.E.X.) stable.[14] Styles faced NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett on February 19, but was defeated.[14] In the course of the match, Styles became a fan favorite, attacking S.E.X. as they tried to interfere on his behalf because he did not want to win in that manner. Styles briefly teamed with D'Lo Brown, but disbanded for their world title aspirations, challenging each other on June 4 in a number one contenders match which was won by Styles. Styles defeated Jarrett and Raven in a three-way match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship (becoming the first TNA Triple Crown) on June 11 with assistance from Russo.[7] Throughout July 2003, Styles successfully defended the title in matches against D'Lo Brown and a myriad selection of opponents before dropping the title back to Jarrett on October 22.[7] Following his loss, Styles reverted to being a fan favorite while Jarrett became a villain. On November 12, he teamed with Sting to defeat Lex Luger and Jeff Jarrett, though his bid for the title on December 3 was unsuccessful due to interference from Kid Kash.[14]\n\nStyles feuded with Abyss and Jeff Jarrett throughout January, and on February 4, 2004, after Styles demanded a title shot, Jarrett's ally Don Callis forced him to team with Abyss in a match with the NWA World Tag Team Champions, Kevin Northcutt and Legend, which Styles' won, despite being abandoned by Abyss.[7] The following week, Styles defeated Abyss in a match to determine the sole owner of the tag team championship by disqualification after Jarrett interfered, but his victory was overturned by Callis, leading to another match the following week which was won by Abyss after Lex Luger interfered, thus granting Abyss sole control of the tag team championship.[7] On March 17, Abyss defeated Styles to become the number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.[14] Russo granted Styles a championship steel cage match against Jarret on April 21, where he won his second world title.[7] He successfully defended the title in matches with Ron Killings, Raven and Chris Harris, and on May 19 he defended against all three men in a four-way title match. Styles lost the title to Killings after Jarrett interfered in the match, hitting him with a guitar.[14]\n\nX Division Champion (2004–2007)\n\n[edit]\n\nStyles returned to the X Division shortly thereafter, winning a four-way match to become the number one contender to the X Division Championship on the June 4 episode of Impact!.[7] On June 9, he defeated Frankie Kazarian to become a three-time X Division Champion.[7] In the following weeks, Styles feuded with Kid Kash and Dallas,[7] while successfully defending the title in matches with Kazarian and Mr. Águila. An additional match on June 23 with the debuting Jeff Hardy was interrupted by Kash and Dallas.[21] On July 28, he defended the title against Kazarian and Michael Shane in an Ultimate X match.[22] After Kash struck Styles with a crutch, Shane and Kazarian simultaneously retrieved the title belt and became co-X Division Champions.[22] After several abortive attempts to regain the title, Styles fought Kash in a number of matches, culminating on September 8 in a tables match which was won by Styles.[23] In October, Styles began feuding with Petey Williams (who by then was the TNA X Division Champion) and on November 7 at Victory Road, the first monthly pay-per-view event held by TNA, Styles failed to regain the title from Williams.[24]\n\nAt Final Resolution, Styles won the X Division Championship for a fourth time in an Ultimate X match, defeating Chris Sabin and the reigning champion Petey Williams.[25] Styles faced Christopher Daniels for the first time on January 21, 2005, and after failing to defeat him in ten minutes, qualified for a thirty-minute Iron Man match for the championship at Against All Odds,[26][27] where Styles defeated Daniels to retain the title after initial tying and going into \"sudden death\" rules.[27] The feud between Styles and Daniels continued and at Destination X on March 13, Styles lost the title to him in an Ultimate X Challenge also featuring Ron Killings and Elix Skipper.[28]\n\nAfter defeating Abyss at Lockdown to become the number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship,[29] Styles won his third world championship from Jeff Jarrett at Hard Justice,[30][31] which he lost to Raven in a King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary.[32] Styles then entered the TNA 2005 Super X Cup Tournament, which granted the winner a shot at the X Division Championship. Styles defeated Matt Bentley in the quarter-finals and Petey Williams in the semi-finals, but lost to Samoa Joe at Sacrifice.[33] As Christopher Daniels (the reigning X Division champion) had interfered in the match, TNA Director of Authority Larry Zbyszko added Styles to the resultant title bout. At Unbreakable, Styles defeated Samoa Joe and Daniels in a critically lauded three-way match to become the X Division Champion for a fifth time.[34][35]\n\nAt Bound for Glory, Styles successfully defended the title against Christopher Daniels in the second thirty-minute Iron Man.[36] The following month at Genesis, Styles successfully defended the title against Petey Williams.[37] Styles then started a feud with Joe, claiming that he had broken the unwritten \"code of the X Division\" by brutally beating Daniels.[37] At Turning Point, Styles lost the X Division Championship to Joe.[38] Styles was unsuccessful in retaining the title in a triple threat match, also featuring Daniels, at Against All Odds,[39] and in an Ultimate X match at Destination X, which Daniels won.[40] After Daniels lost the title back to Joe, Styles joined Daniels to challenge America's Most Wanted for the NWA World Tag Team Championship.

On the following episode of Impact!, Flair, who had aligned himself with Styles, Desmond Wolfe, Kazarian, Robert Roode and James Storm, announced that he would reform the Four Horsemen under the new

from Desmond Wolfe.[101] On the July 22 episode of Impact!, Styles defeated Terry to win the Global Championship (formerly the Legends Championship) for the second time.[102] The following week on Impact!, Styles renamed the title the TNA Television Championship.[103] Fourtune (soon renamed Fortune) then feuded with EV 2.0 and Styles defeated EV 2.0 leader Tommy Dreamer in a non-title \"I

with Christopher Daniels, effectively ending Fortune.[128]\n\nFinal storylines (2012–2014)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the February 9 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kazarian, now seemingly a reluctant associate of Daniels, helped him defeat Styles in a singles match.[129] Three days later at Against All Odds, Styles was defeated by Kazarian in a singles match.[130] On the March 3 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kazarian defeated Styles in a gauntlet match; had Styles been successful, Kazarian would have to explain his alliance with Daniels.[131] Mr. Anderson then returned and aligned with Styles to defeat Daniels and Kazarian in tag team match at Victory Road[132] and at Lockdown, where the two duos were on opposing teams in the annual Lethal Lockdown match.[133] On the May 10 episode of Impact Wrestling, Kazarian revealed that he originally aligned himself with Daniels to keep him from revealing Styles' secret, but changed his mind after learning what the secret was, at which point Daniels revealed a series of photographs insinuating a relationship between Styles and TNA president Dixie Carter.[134]\n\nAt Sacrifice, Daniels and Kazarian cost Styles his match against Kurt Angle, who nonetheless saved Styles from a post-match beatdown.[135] On May 31, Styles defeated Daniels in the main event of the first live episode of Impact Wrestling, after which Daniels and Kazarian played

Wrestling, Styles and Carter revealed their secret—they were not having an affair but were helping an addicted pregnant woman named Claire Lynch overcome her problems.[139] The following week on Impact Wrestling, Styles and Angle lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship back to Daniels and Kazarian when Kazarian hit Styles with a steel chair, after which Daniels admitted that Styles and Carter had told the truth about Claire, but claimed that they had left out the part about Styles being the father of her unborn baby.[140] Styles defeated Daniels in a Last Man Standing match at Destination X,[141] and again in a Bound for Glory Series match and, per the pre-match stipulations, earned the right to get a paternity test on Claire's baby.[142] The following week on Impact Wrestling it was revealed that Claire was not pregnant after all and her attorney revealed Daniels' and Kazarian's plot to blackmail Styles.[143] On the August 30 episode of Impact Wrestling, Styles was eliminated in the 2012 Bound for Glory Series after losing to Samoa Joe.[144] At No Surrender and Bound for Glory, Styles and Angle unsuccessfully challenged Daniels and Kazarian for the TNA World

preventing him from receiving another title opportunity until Bound for Glory 2013 as per the pre-match stipulation.[147] On December 9 at Final Resolution, Styles was defeated by Christopher Daniels in what was billed as their \"final match\".[148] On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Styles said that he was tired of doing the right thing and that he was going to do his own thing from there on.[149]\n\nBeginning in February 2013, TNA began airing videos at Styles' home interviewing his wife, a friend, and even attempting to interview Styles himself before he angrily forced them to leave.[150][151] Styles, now sporting a beard, unkempt hair, and all-black attire, returned to TNA with the Calf Killer submission hold as his new finisher, which he used to defeat James Storm in his first match back.[152][153][154] Styles, who remained silent in the following weeks, began feuding with Kurt Angle after refusing to tell Angle whether or not he was with the Aces & Eights stable.[155] His new gimmick was nicknamed \"The Lone Wolf\", since he rejected joining Aces & Eights.[156] At Slammiversary XI, Styles was defeated by Angle in a singles match,[157] but he defeated him in a rematch to earn the final spot in the 2013 Bound for Glory Series.[158] Throughout the following weeks, Styles participated in the Bound For Glory Series, winning the tournament and becoming the number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory.[159] The following week on Impact Wrestling, Styles claimed that he was no longer under contract with TNA and insulted Dixie Carter, who responded by saying that Styles was not a great wrestler.[160] In the weeks leading up to Bound for Glory, Styles continued to appear on Impact Wrestling, despite not having a contract with the company, but he would defeat Bully Ray at Bound for Glory, despite interference from Aces & Eights and Carter, to win his second TNA World Heavyweight Championship and fifth world title in the company overall.[161] Styles made his first televised title defense on the following episode of Impact Wrestling, defeating Ray in a rematch after interference from Mr. Anderson, after which he refused Carter's new contract offer and walked out of TNA with the title.[162] On October 29, TNA vacated the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.[163] On the December 2 taping of Impact Wrestling which aired on January 2, 2014, Styles returned to TNA with his championship to confront Carter and Magnus (who had won a tournament to crown the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion), with Styles challenging Magnus to a title unification match on next weeks episode of Impact Wrestling, which Magnus accepted.[164] On December 5 taping of Impact Wrestling which aired on tape delay on January 9, Magnus won to unify both titles after interference from eight other wrestlers on Magnus' behalf and Sting interfering on Styles' behalf in what would be Styles' final match with TNA.[165][166][167] On December 8, it was reported that contract negotiations between Styles and TNA had broken down and that Styles would be leaving the promotion, becoming a free agent effective December 17 and ending his near twelve-year association with the company.[168] According to Styles he left the promotion since they made him an offer which reduced his salary about 60%.[169]\n\nReturn

(2014–2016)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bullet Club\n\nFor the first time since the TNA-NJPW partnership in 2008, on March 27, 2014, it was reported that Styles would return to New Japan Pro-Wrestling and had signed a contract with the company.[203] Styles' return came on April 6 at Invasion Attack, where he attacked IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada after his match and laid him out with the Styles Clash and challenged Okada to a title match, before revealing himself as the newest member of Bullet Club, establishing himself as a villain in the process.[204][205] Following Invasion Attack, with Styles still working a full schedule on the American independent circuit and only booked to work NJPW's larger events,[206] Karl Anderson was positioned as the new leader of Bullet Club.[207] However, Styles was considered the leader of the Ring of Honor (ROH) version of Bullet Club,[208] a role which was also given to him by NJPW by the end of 2015.[209] Styles wrestled his first match under a New Japan contract on May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku, where he defeated Okada with help from Yujiro Takahashi to become the new IWGP Heavyweight Champion.[210] With this victory, Styles became the sixth gaijin (non-Japanese) champion in the title's history and the first American champion since Brock Lesnar in 2005.[211][212] The win also made Styles the shortest IWGP Heavyweight Champion in history.[213] On May 17, Styles made his first successful title defense in a three-way match with Okada and Michael Elgin at the NJPW/ROH co-produced War of the Worlds event in New York City.[214] On May 25 at Back to the Yokohama Arena, Styles defeated Okada for his second successful title defense.[215][216] Styles suffered his first loss in NJPW on July 21, when he was defeated by Okada in his first match in the 2014 G1 Climax tournament.[217] Out of his nine remaining matches in the tournament, Styles lost only one, but failed to advance to the finals due to his loss against Okada in the head-to-head match.[218][219] On October 13 at King of Pro-Wrestling, Styles lost the IWGP Heavyweight Championship to Hiroshi Tanahashi in his third defense, after the returning Yoshitatsu stopped Bullet Club's newest member, Jeff Jarrett, from interfering in the match.[220][221]\n\nOn November 8 at Power Struggle, Styles defeated Yoshitatsu with help from Jarrett and after the match was confronted by Tetsuya Naito.[222] During the match, Yoshitatsu legitimately broke his neck on a botched Styles Clash in which he tucked his head, leading to NJPW pushing Styles as a \"killer\" and the Styles Clash as a controversial maneuver.[223][224] Later in the month, Styles entered the 2014 World Tag League, alongside Yujiro Takahashi.[225] Despite a win over the reigning IWGP Tag Team Champions, Bullet Club stablemates Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson,[226] Styles and Takahashi failed to advance from their block with a record of four wins and three losses due to losing to Kazuchika Okada and Yoshi-Hashi on the final day.[227] Styles and Naito faced off in a match on January 4, 2015, at Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome, where Styles was victorious.[228][229] On

by Kazuchika Okada.[235][236] From July 20 to August 14, Styles took part in the 2015 G1 Climax.[237] Styles entered the final day with a chance to advance from his block, but a loss against Hiroshi

but was again defeated by Okada.[239]\n\nIn November, Styles entered the IWGP Intercontinental Championship picture by challenging Shinsuke Nakamura to a title match.[240] Later that month, Styles was forced to pull out of the 2015 World Tag League, where he teamed with Yujiro Takahashi, after experiencing a back injury.[241] Styles returned to the NJPW ring on January 4, 2016, at Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome, where he unsuccessfully challenged Shinsuke Nakamura for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship.[242] Hours after Styles' Wrestle Kingdom 10 match, it was reported that Styles had given his notice to NJPW on the morning of January 4, announcing that he was leaving the promotion and signing with WWE.[243][244] The following day, Styles made his final appearance for NJPW, where the rest of Bullet Club turned on him with Kenny Omega becoming the stable's new leader.[245]\n\nWWE (2016–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nFeud with John Cena (2016–2017)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: The O.C.\n\nAfter weeks of speculation and WWE themselves covering the rumors of Styles leaving NJPW for WWE,[246][247] on January 20, 2016, it was confirmed that he had signed with WWE.[243][244] Prior to signing, Styles had also had extensive discussions with TNA and according to them, Styles had agreed to return to the promotion with Bullet Club stablemates Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson,[248] before being offered a \"blow-away deal\" by WWE.[249] After not being on WWE television since his Metal match in 2002, Styles made his re-debut in WWE on January 24 at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view during the Royal Rumble match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, entering at number three. Styles went on to eliminate Curtis Axel and Tyler Breeze, before being eliminated by Kevin Owens, lasting just under 29 minutes in the match.[250] Styles then entered a storyline with Chris Jericho, with the two exchanging victories on both Raw[251] and SmackDown,[252] which ultimately led to an encounter between the two on February 21 at Fastlane,[253][254][255] where Styles emerged victorious via submission.[256] After Fastlane, Jericho and Styles formed a tag team, dubbed \"Y2AJ\",[257] and defeated The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston) in two non-title matches.[258][259] Y2AJ failed to win the WWE Tag Team Championship from them on the March 7 episode of Raw, after which Jericho turned on Styles and attacked him, ending their team.[260] The two subsequently interfered in each other's matches,[261][262] leading to Styles challenging Jericho to a match at WrestleMania 32,[263] which Jericho ultimately accepted on the March 28 episode of Raw.[264] At WrestleMania 32 on April 3, Styles lost to Jericho.[265]\n\nOn the following episode of Raw, Styles defeated Jericho, Kevin Owens, and Cesaro in a fatal four-way match to become the number one contender for Roman Reigns' WWE World Heavyweight Championship.[266] In the weeks that followed, Styles reunited with former Bullet Club stablemates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson (now known as The Club), and an alliance was teased, which Styles initially declined.[267][268][269] At Payback on May 1, Reigns eventually defeated Styles by pinfall after the match was restarted twice (with Styles first winning by countout and then by disqualification), despite Gallows and Anderson's interference.[270] Styles received a rematch against Reigns at Extreme Rules on May 22 in an Extreme Rules match,[271] but was unsuccessful in winning the championship due to interference from both Gallows and Anderson and The Usos (Jey and Jimmy Uso).[272] The following night on Raw, Styles failed to qualify for the Money in the Bank ladder match at Money in the Bank against Owens.[273] On the May 30 episode of Raw, he welcomed back a returning John Cena, only to attack Cena with help from Gallows and Anderson, turning heel in the process.[274] This set up a match between Styles and Cena at Money in the Bank on June 19,[275] which Styles won after interference from The Club.[276] At Battleground on July 24, The Club were defeated by Cena and Enzo Amore and Big Cass in a six-man tag team match after Cena pinned Styles.[277] During the 2016 WWE draft, Styles was drafted to the SmackDown brand in the first round of picks, being the brand's second pick overall, while Gallows and Anderson were drafted to the Raw brand, splitting up The Club.[278] He faced Cena once more at the SummerSlam pay-per-view on August 21,[279] where he was victorious.[280] After his victory over Cena, Styles claimed himself to be the \"new face of WWE\" and \"the Face That Runs the Place\".[281]\n\nDue to his victory at SummerSlam, Styles immediately re-entered the renamed WWE World Championship picture and received another opportunity at the title at Backlash against Dean Ambrose.[282] At the event on September 11, Styles defeated Ambrose to become the WWE World Champion for the first time after a low blow, also his first championship in WWE and eighth world title overall.[283] Styles made his first successful title defense against Ambrose in a rematch on the September 27 episode of SmackDown after interference from John Cena.[284] At No Mercy on October 9, Styles retained the title against Cena and Ambrose in a triple threat match after pinning Cena.[285] At Survivor Series on November 20, Styles made up Team SmackDown alongside Ambrose, Bray Wyatt, Randy Orton and Shane McMahon in the 5-on-5 Survivor Series match against Team Raw,[286] which the former won.[287] At TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 4, Styles retained the championship over Ambrose in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match after James Ellsworth interfered and pushed Ambrose off a ladder and through several tables.[288] Styles then resumed his feud with Cena leading into the Royal Rumble on January 29, 2017,[289][290] where Styles was defeated for the championship, ending his reign at 140 days.[291]\n\nOn February 12 at Elimination Chamber, Styles competed in an Elimination Chamber match against Cena, Baron Corbin, Bray Wyatt, Dean Ambrose and The Miz for the WWE Championship,[292] which Wyatt won.[293] On the following episode of SmackDown, Styles failed to regain the title from Wyatt in a triple threat match also involving Cena.[294] In March, Styles began a feud with SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon, due to Styles' frustration of being unable to reclaim the WWE Championship.[295][296] This led to a match between the two at WrestleMania 33 on April 2,[297] which Styles won.[298] On the following episode of SmackDown, Styles shook hands with McMahon, thus turning face in the process.[299]\n\nOn the April 11 episode of SmackDown, Styles defeated Baron Corbin and Sami Zayn to become the number one contender for the United States Championship at Backlash on May 21,[300][301] but he lost his match for the title against Kevin Owens by countout.[302] At Money in the Bank on June 18, Styles failed to win the Money in the Bank ladder match.[303] After Styles became once again the number one contender to Owens' championship,[304] a title match was set for Battleground.[305] However, two weeks before the pay-per-view, Styles defeated Owens during a WWE house show at Madison Square Garden on July 7 to capture the United States Championship for the first time in his career.[306] At Battleground on July 23, Styles lost the title back to Owens,[307] but regained it two days later on SmackDown in a triple threat match also involving a returning Chris Jericho, beginning his second reign with the championship.[308] At SummerSlam on August 20, Styles defeated Owens to retain the title with Shane McMahon as the special guest referee.[309] Styles once again defeated Owens two days later on SmackDown to end the feud.[310] In September, he began a feud with Tye Dillinger and Baron Corbin,[311][312] leading to a triple threat match at Hell in a Cell on October 8,[313] where Styles lost the title to Corbin who pinned Dillinger, thus ending his reign at 75 days.[314] Two days later on SmackDown, Styles failed to regain the title from Corbin.[315]\n\nYear-long WWE Championship reign (2017–2018)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the October 17 episode of SmackDown, Styles began a rivalry with then WWE Champion Jinder Mahal, confronting and attacking him.[316] On October 22, Styles appeared at Raw's exclusive event TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs,[317] competing against Finn Bálor due to Bálor's original opponent Bray Wyatt not being cleared to compete,[318] where he was defeated by Bálor.[319] On the November 7 episode of SmackDown in Manchester, England, Styles defeated Mahal to win the WWE Championship for the second time in what marked the first time the title changed hands on SmackDown since September 2003, becoming recognized by WWE as the first titleholder crowned outside of North America[320] (Antonio Inoki had won the title in Japan in 1979,[321] but this reign is unrecognized by WWE).[322] With the win, Styles replaced Mahal in the champion vs. champion match at Survivor Series against Universal Champion Brock Lesnar on November 19,[323] but lost.[324] At Clash of Champions on December 17, Styles defeated Mahal via submission in his first title defense.[325] His next feud came against Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn, whom he lost back-to-back matches to due to interference,[326][327] leading to a handicap championship match at the Royal Rumble on January 28, 2018,[328] which Styles won.[329] Styles retained the title against Owens, Zayn, John Cena, Baron Corbin, and Dolph Ziggler in a six-pack challenge at Fastlane on March 11.[330]\n\nStyles defended the title against Royal Rumble winner Shinsuke Nakamura at WrestleMania 34 on April 8,[331] in which he was victorious. After the match, however, Styles was subjected to a classless assault by Nakamura.[332] This led to a rematch between the two on April 27 at the Greatest Royal Rumble,[333] where they fought to a double countout, but Styles retained the title.[334] Another rematch was made for Backlash with a no disqualification stipulation added on the May 1 episode of SmackDown.[335][336] At the event on May 6, Styles and Nakamura fought to a no contest after low blowing each other, again retaining the title.[337] Their feud ended at Money in the Bank on June 17,[338] where Styles defeated Nakamura to retain the WWE Championship in a Last Man Standing match.[339] After retaining the title against Rusev at Extreme Rules on July 15,[340] Styles became the longest-reigning WWE Champion in SmackDown history on August 14, surpassing the 280-day record set by John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield.[341]\n\nOn the July 24 episode of SmackDown, Styles started a feud with Samoa Joe, after he was attacked by Joe.[342] Styles retained the title at SummerSlam on August 19, despite losing via disqualification.[343] Styles' and Joe's rivalry continued over Styles' wife, Wendy, where Joe claimed he would defeat Styles and become the \"new daddy\",[344] leading to a rematch at Hell in a Cell on September 16,[345] which Styles won in controversial fashion to retain the title; Styles submitted to Joe during a roll-up, however, the referee did not see the submission and counted the pin, allowing Styles to retain the title.[346] Styles retained the title against Joe at Super Show-Down on October 6 by submission[347] and Crown Jewel on November 2.[348]\n\nOn the October 30 episode of SmackDown, Styles defeated Daniel Bryan to retain the title.[349] On November 7, Styles surpassed the 365-day mark of his title reign, becoming the 8th man to have held the WWE Championship for a continuous reign of a full year.[350] On the November 13 episode of SmackDown Live, Styles lost the WWE Championship to Bryan following a low blow, ending his reign at 371 days.[351] Styles received his rematch against Bryan at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 16,[352] but failed to regain the championship.[353]\n\nReturn of The O.C.

In 2010, Jones acquired a large tattoo down the right side of his torso which reads \"AJ 05-03-05 02-14-07 09-15-09\", representing his initials and birth dates of his first three children.[474] In 2016, he added the birth date of his fourth child, reading \"10-08-14\".[475] The family lives in Gainesville, Georgia.[476]\n\nJones is a devout Christian, stating that in his life, \"It's God first and family second.\"[477][472][10] He is a big fan of Christian hip hop music, and his favorite groups to listen to are the West Coast-based K2S, Lil' Raskull, FTF, and L.G. Wise. While Jones was working for TNA, he met GRITS members Stacey \"Coffee\" Jones and Teron \"Bonafide\" Carter at Universal Studios Florida, TNA's former primary television taping location. Jones would become good friends with the duo, using their remix of his entrance music \"I Am\", later renamed \"Get Ready to Fly\").[478]\n\nJones has been accused throughout his career of being homophobic and being prejudiced against LGBT+ people due to him using the anti-gay slur \"faggot\" on numerous occasions.[479][480][481] NWA had part of a segment Jones was apart of for NWA TNA bleeped out due to him using inappropriate language, particularly him using the slur at Disco Inferno. \"Road Dogg\" Jesse James, who was then known as BJ James, also used the slur during another show but not at Inferno. No consequences were taken at Jones by management, but he did apologize stating that the slur \"is a word you just say when your when goofing off\".[482] At a 2005 Ring of Honor show,[483] Styles used the slur against an audience member during a match against CIMA. During a backstage cut during a Pro Wrestling Guerrilla show, he interrupted a promo from Kevin Steen (later Kevin Owens) and used the slur against him; he also referred to an opponent's manager during a 2015 show as a \"douchebag with a faggity bow tie\", telling him afterward to \"find a life partner and get out of here before [he gets] hurt\".\n\nChampionships and
