        "text": "Mississippi Delta-born sister country music duo, American Blonde, will visit GRAMMY Museum® Mississippi for an intimate Q&A and performance as part of the Museum’s Spotlight series on Thursday, Aug. 29, at 7 p.m. Proceeds from this special program will raise funds to support the music education initiatives of GRAMMY Museum Mississippi.\n\nSpotlight: American Blonde will take place on Thursday, Aug. 29 at 7 p.m. in the Museum’s Sanders Soundstage. Tickets are $20 for GRAMMY Museum Mississippi Members and $30 for non-members and can be purchased by calling the Museum's box office at 662-441-0100. This special program is made possible by Needle Specialty Products Corporation.\n\nAbout AMERICAN BLONDE\n\nRaised in the Mississippi Delta, the birthplace of American music, sisters Natalia (Nata) and Christina (Tinka) Morris were raised hearing the stylings of artists in country, rock, Americana, and blues. Previously performing with their sister Hanna in their teens under the name Southern Halo, their upbringing laid the groundwork for American Blonde’s sound—a generous blend of country-pop with an edge and, at times, a hint of blues. Nata and Tinka didn’t grow up playing in church like most young artists—they played at local bars and rowdy festivals. It was their involvement in their area Texaco Country Showdown, where they made it to the finals and performed at The Ryman, that shifted them from a multi-genre girl group to one rooted in the Nashville sound and, ultimately, encouraged their path forward as artists. They continued full steam ahead, performing throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe, opening for artists like Maren Morris, Kane Brown, Parmalee, Easton Corbin, Thompson Square, and even B.B. King, among others."
