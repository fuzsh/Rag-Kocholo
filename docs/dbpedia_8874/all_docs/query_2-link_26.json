        "text": "Country artist Easton Corbin will headline the annual Farley Fest concert on Saturday, July 29.\n\nNamed Billboard’s 2010 Top New Country Artist, Corbin’s catalog of hits includes “A Little More Country Than That,” “Roll With It” and “All Over the Road.” Corbin’s most recent album, Let’s Do Country Right, was released in January.\n\n“Easton has been performing for more than a decade on some of the world’s biggest stages, and we are thrilled to be bringing him to Farley Fest,” said Jamie Henderson, Milbank Area Chamber executive director.\n\nCorbin is dedicated to retaining classic country music influences in his songs. “That’s what I love and that’s what I do. For me, it’s about keeping one foot in the traditional and one foot in the modern, and marrying those two,” said Corbin. “I’m a country singer. That’s one of the things that I take pride in. I try to hone the craft and try to represent that.”\n\nCorbin’s childhood in Florida was full of Merle Haggard and Hank Williams music. “My earliest memories are of me as a kid with a guitar, singing and playing along with the radio,” Corbin said. “I knew from an early age I wanted to be a country singer.”\n\nHaving spent more than 10 years in the spotlight, Corbin has his musical priorities in order. “I know what I want to say and what I don’t want to say, and I know what I would say and what I wouldn’t say. I think the new music highlights the fact that we’ve been honing these songs and trying to cut the best songs and writing the best songs we can,” said Corbin.\n\nCorbin recently started a new creative journey as an independent artist. However, his past songs still resonate with his current direction. “‘A Little More Country Than That’ radiates with me and my band as well because that really is who I am. That’s where I came from, that’s who I am. It’s just as important now as it was then, because that’s the one that started it all for me. That’s definitely a staple of an Easton Corbin show. I think it also defines my audience and who they are.”\n\nTickets will be on sale starting Tuesday, May 2. They will be available for purchase through the chamber office or online at www.farleyfest.com.\n\nCategory:"
