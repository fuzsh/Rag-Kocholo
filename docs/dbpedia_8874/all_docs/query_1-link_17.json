        "text": "It use to be that when you said your hometown was Alvin, Texas, everyone thought of a certain very famous and fantastic baseball player.\n\nNow, there is another name associated with the town where talent abounds. The Junior Gordon Band began its trek to the top in music in Alvin, but the group is now seeing their fan base expand, and their latest album, “BIG” making a (dare we say it?) BIG impact on country music. Along with a new album “Made In The U.S.A.”, That was released in late September 2016. As of March 2016, they have their first ever top 10 single with “I’m Breaking In” blazing through and burning up every stage they set foot on. People just simply love the talent, beat and message of the band. Sharing the stage with Easton Corbin, Cody Johnson, Bri Bagwell, Lee Brice, Tracy Lawrence, Sammy Kershaw, Johnny Lee, David Allen Coe, Tracy Byrd, Sam Riggs, Eli Young, Sundance Head, Roger Creager, Kevin Fowler, Kyle Park, Cory Morrow just to name a few."
