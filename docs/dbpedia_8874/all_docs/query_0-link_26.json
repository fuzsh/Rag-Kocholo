        "text": "Modern traditionalist Easton Corbin is set to bring new music, shows, and a very unique TV appearance this year. I sat down with him at Country Radio Seminar in Nashville to discuss all the exciting things happening for him in 2022.\n\n“Marry That Girl” on Joe Millionaire\n\nOn March 3, Corbin will not only release the digital version of his newest single “Marry That Girl,” but fans will get to see him perform the song on Joe Millionaire: For Richer or Poorer. The show is a twist on the original version, featuring two eligible bachelors and twenty single women who have no idea which man is the millionaire and which is a “regular Joe.” The episode’s details are top secret, so tune in to watch the performance during the show on Thursday at 8/7 central on FOX.\n\nCorbin stated that hasn’t done anything quite like this television appearance before and the song ended up being a perfect fit for a dating show where people hope to fall in love.\n\nThe Story Behind “Marry That Girl”\n\nImagine meeting someone for the first time and immediately knowing you’d spend forever with them. Perhaps it’s the way they look at you or how you get lost in a deep conversation after only a short time. That’s what “Marry That Girl” is about, told through a story of a couple meeting at a birthday party and instantly connecting.\n\nWhen writers Adam Craig, Wade Kirby, and Shane Minor joined Corbin in the studio, the guys were chatting frivolously until Adam said something that sparked a song idea. “I knew I was gonna marry that girl,” he said, referring to his wife. From there, they crafted a heartfelt song with the lyrics:\n\n“I’m gonna change her name, but she don’t know it yet\n\nShe’s what I’ve been prayin’ someday God would send\n\nI ain’t never been the same since we first met\n\nI’m gonna marry that girl.”\n\n“Marry That girl”\n\n“I Can’t Decide”\n\nCorbin plans to release another song titled “I Can’t Decide” in May. He wrote it several years ago and plays it occasionally at his shows. After gauging the reaction from fans, he decided to release it as a single. He explained, “I’ve always thought it’s been a great song and any time I do play it in public, it catches people’s ear.”\n\n“Tulsa Texas” is another song that’s popular at shows. Corbin explained, “It’s probably one of my fan-favorites even though it never was a single.” Will he ever release it as a single? Only time will tell.\n\nLatest EP: Didn’t Miss a Beat\n\nI’m always drawn to songs with lyrics that elicit emotion and are thought-provoking, which is why several songs stood out to me while listening to Corbin’s Latest EP, Didn’t Miss a Beat. Released in 2020, the EP is a stand-out project that’s worth listening to if you haven’t heard it yet.\n\nThe song “Back to Me” is about a guy whose girlfriend is leaving their hometown to experience life outside of what she’s known. He’s hoping that after she’s seen the world, she’ll come back to him, which from a storytelling standpoint, evokes many questions. Will they still be a fit if she returns? And from the woman’s perspective, how much does she need to experience before settling down? And is it better to stick with what you know or branch out into the unknown?\n\nI asked Corbin about his first encounter outside of his hometown and he said it was when he moved to Nashville after college. He was surprised that it was a pretty tight-knit community within a large city. I can imagine that the many artists who make this move enhance their songwriting by the additional exposure to things they otherwise wouldn’t have seen.\n\nWhether a person experiences more than their hometown or not, their choices shape who they are and it’s intriguing how two people can be completely happy with opposite choices in life.\n\n“Before You Wish You Had”\n\n“Before You Wish You Had” is another captivating song about what we could be missing out on by focusing on things that won’t mean as much in the end. Corbin says it’s really about prioritizing what’s important in life. “It’s about the relationships you have with people and your loved ones,” he said.\n\nListen to Didn’t Miss a Beat\n\nStone Country Records\n\nHaving recently signed to Stone Country Records as its flagship artist, followed by Ben Gallagher, Corbin has found a home with a like-minded label. “It’s been awesome,” he began, “A great experience. I got a great team who really loves traditional country music and supports what I do and that means a lot.”\n\n“That’s where my heart lies,” he said about traditional country music. Corbin describes his style as keeping one foot in the traditional side of country and one in the modern side. “Music’s always evolving,” he explained.\n\nNew Album\n\nIn addition to new singles, fans can look forward to a new record coming out in the near future. While the release date is yet to be announced, Corbin stated that it’s a gratifying mixture of songs and was happy to have the past two years to have a relaxed writing process. He described the notion that artists have their entire life to write their first record and after that, it’s expected that they rapidly create new songs. The last couple of years was a reset that gave him time to write. We’re looking forward to hearing the album and hope that you all support it!"
