        "text": "If you were country before country was largely the domain of the cool, coiffed, might-as-well-be-pop-stars who seem to rule its charts today, Easton Corbin might be your guy.\n\nThe baseball-cap-wearing Floridian cites George Jones, Merle Haggard, Keith Whitley and George Strait as his primary influences and has reminded more than a few reviewers of the last name on that list. He bears strong vocal resemblance to Strait and has been heralded by some as a throwback, a true-blue country boy, a flesh-and-blood reminder of headier, 10-gallon days. PopMatters ranked his self-titled debut third on its list of last year’s best country records, and Entertainment Weekly’s Whitney Pastorek wrote Corbin could help listeners “remember why” they “fell in love with country music in the first place.”\n\n“At a time when so many new country acts are drawing their inspiration from stale ’80s arena rock and early-’90s adult contemporary drivel, newcomer Easton Corbin stands as a refreshing change of pace,” Slant magazine’s Jonathan Keefe wrote this year, his statement hitting the proverbial nail squarely on its head.\n\nCorbin’s debut echoes Strait and evokes Whitley’s memory, no doubt a function of his personal history and that of producer Carson Chamberlain, who, having played with Whitley, acts as a bridge between past and present generations of country. The record is anchored by Corbin’s breakout No. 1 hit “A Little More Country Than That.” Essentially, the track is a laundry list of the singer’s backwoods bonafides; Pastorek called it “the latest in a too-long line of singles asserting the down-home legitimacy of their respective artists.” Yet it’s an authentic statement — Corbin was an FFA and 4-H-loving kid from the smallest county in the state — and its easygoing, earnest charm signposts the singer’s potential to endure and endear himself to audiences.\n\nThat same charisma asserts itself throughout the album, but rarely does the quality of tune match the sincerity of tone. “Someday When I’m Old” benefits from a bluesy shuffle that’s first articulated in a funky boondocks guitar strum and then fleshed out by some wonderfully soulful piano. The song features some pretty banal lyrics about aging with attitude, but the sorry state of verse can be forgiven in light of the song’s spirit-stirring swing. “Leavin’ a Lonely Town,” a song All Music Guide’s Todd Sterling said “could be a lost song from Steve Earle’s groundbreaking Guitar Town sessions,” has a great country-rock shuffle; though it’s the last song on the record, it’s the first that truly connects Corbin to the country music of train depots and truck stops played by his forefathers.\n\nFor as much as Corbin, through no fault of his own, has been treated like Central Casting’s answer to a dearth of good ol’ boys, he still finds ways to land right in step with the fashionable boot-wearing crowd that rocks country radio. “A Lot to Learn About Livin’ ” is Corbin’s take on Kenny Chesney’s signature take on a signature sound he took from Jimmy Buffet. “An empty-headed knockoff of” Chesney’s “stale tropical island shtick,” as Keefe put it, the song takes lyrics about beach living as a means of breaking out of the modern rat race and sets them against rhythms that gently sway like palm trees. It’s light; it’s loose, it’s pretty limp stuff.\n\nSeveral cuts on the record, “The Way Love Looks” and “Don’t Ask Me About a Woman,” are plagued by the same wholly predictable lyrical bent, each finding quasi-new ways to say the same worn-out thing: “Women are like this … men are like this … what can you do?” The sentiments sound universal at first but, contemplated a second time or for more than a second of time, come off as unimaginative and, frankly, pretty reductive. Perhaps the greatest misstep here is one of pacing — most of the material is midtempo fare, songs that can’t possibly deviate from one another by more than a few beats per minute. After half a dozen songs or so, the effect is something like musical water torture.\n\nDrawing upon the obvious Strait comparisons, Keefe concludes, “Unfortunately for Corbin, though, he doesn’t reach the same heights of Strait’s best singles or even of his halfway-interesting recent albums. Instead, the album recalls the series of interchangeable, filler-packed albums Strait recorded in the mid ’90s.”\n\nThe lesson here is the greatness of the Jamey Johnsons and Punch Brothers and Miranda Lamberts of the world aside, country music has come to a point where the most average Strait tribute is a far better thing than many of the best efforts its mainstream artists have to offer. Corbin should be enjoyed then encouraged to step it up a little more next time out."
