        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nI'm curious to hear it. Easton Corbin is an artist I have a mixed opinion of, and we all know this will be uptempo, hopefully it's more like \"Roll With It\" and less like \"Baby Be My Love Song\" and \"Yup\".\n\nPost by gingersnap on\n\nNot related to this song inparticular, but over the past few years the words girl and boy has been used in so many songs, there are 4 songs on the charts right now with the word \"Girl \" in the title , 6 actually if you count \" Holding Her and \"For Her\", and some songs have the words alot and I mean alot in them. Just making an observation.\n\nPost by The Brazilian Guy ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· on\n\nIt's a shame it took him so long for him to release \"Are You With Me\" as a single... he has hardly any buzz left around him and that song was never able to achieved it's full potential charts-wise.\n\nI hope this is a good song... I like Easton and even though some of his past singles were very underwhelming in my opinion, I would love to see him getting some traction back to his career with a successful song\n\nPost by codyj100 on\n\nI am so bummed that \"Are You With Me\" didn't make it as far as it should have. I was seriously hoping that it would become a hit. However, it only seems fitting that they move on to a new era ASAP. He may only have a little momentum left, but I'd say he probably expanded his fanbase quite a bit by touring with Carrie in 2016. Usually when I see an artist in concert, especially one that I have never seen before (and then enjoy) I will start buying their music.\n\nPlus the About To Get Real era was just awkward. \"Baby, Be My Love Song\" was the only hit off the album.\" \"Clockwork\" did okay, but obviously not well enough to release the album, calling for it to be pushed. I'm just hoping this new single from the new era can build up momentum somehow.\n\nPost by robenglund on\n\nThis is one of titles where I can already tell what the song is going to be about. The lyrics are probably going to be nothing special which is fine with me. Hoping for some strong neo-traditional instrumentation! If it's modern and overproduced I will be so angry.\n\nPost by robenglund on\n\n@cjbhab said:\n\nPurportedly it is written by Rhett Akins, Jesse Frasure and Ashley Gorley.\n\n(to the latter two writers). Where is your source for this? \"Dirt On My Boots\" was written by the exact same writers and Jon found a way to country-ify it, so I haven't lost all hope in this song.\n\nPost by zaclord ðŸŒˆ on\n\nI don't quite get all the love for him or especially \"Are You With Me\". \"All Over the Road\", \"Clockwork\", and \"A Little More Country Than That\" are the only singles of his that I've genuinely enjoyed and I feel like others in the genre do the traditional country sound better than Easton (Jon Pardi, WMM, etc.) and have higher quality output than him. I'm particularly not interested by his voice. It's rather uninteresting and when I saw him open for Carrie twice in the past year I was surprised at how much I disliked him live (in Greensboro he had to have been sick or something because it was BAD). \"Are You With Me\" was always just bland and boring to me and coupled with a bland and boring voice, it did nothing for me.\n\nIt'll be interesting to hear this though and see how it does considering its a pretty quick turn around from \"Are You With Me\" leaving. He definitely needs an uptempo to get him a hit here though.\n\nPost by robenglund on\n\nIt has some loops but really feels like a Ronnie Milsap song.\n\nLyrics:\n\nwww.roughstock.com/lyrics/2017/01/41285-easton-corbin-a-girl-like-you\n\nYou've heard audio for this? Where?\n\nI don't quite get all the love for him or especially \"Are You With Me\". \"All Over the Road\", \"Clockwork\", and \"A Little More Country Than That\" are the only singles of his that I've genuinely enjoyed and I feel like others in the genre do the traditional country sound better than Easton (Jon Pardi, WMM, etc.) and have higher quality output than him.\n\nI kind of agree with you on this. Easton was my \"traditional guy\" let's say two years ago, but Pardi won me over once \"Head Over Boots\" came out and WMM won me over once I heard his stellar debut album. Easton is kind of on the back burner for me now, but I'm hoping he can win me over again!\n\nPost by .indulgecountry on\n\nThe production in the clip sounds a little off to me but he sounds great. Probably won't be a favorite for me from him by any means, but it sounds like a solid enough choice for radio. Hope it returns him to the upper reaches of the charts again.\n\nPost by dm2081 on\n\nKind of sound likes a Luke Bryan song to be honest, especially with the driving beat to it in the beginning. That being said, it doesn't go too overboard and I did enjoy it. Sounds weird hearing Easton go this direction, but he probably had to so he can stay relevant at radio. This sounds like a hit to my ears, and I could see radio turning this into a 40 week top 5 charting song.\n\nPost by LBTrocks on\n\nI love Easton, but have gotten away from his music. I can't really remember anything about his last album except for the singles. As for this one, it sounds good except for the beat. Once the clip progressed, it started working better as a whole for me. And the guitar riff is really infectious. I love his voice and the vocal arrangement. I'm sure I'll enjoy this and I'm interested in hearing it in full.\n\nPost by sabre14 on\n\nI could look past the lyrics if it wasn't for that annoying back-beat. Ugh. I like the ultra Country instrumentation but this production is definitely done to get radio airplay -- not that I think that's \"wrong\" necessarily, since Easton and UMG Nashville are entitled to want a hit at radio but it's beyond evident on this track, by my ears.\n\nI don't hate it; it's a great earworm (the verse melody is infectious) and Easton sounds great but it's a step in the direction I wish he didn't have to go.\n\nPost by robenglund on\n\nDamn that beat. You can pretty much dance to that. There's that Gorely/Frasure influence. I'll need to listen to the whole song to make a judgement. Definitely not as traditional sounding as \"Dirt On My Boots\". Love the twangy guitars. The vocals remind me of \"Hometown Girl\" in that the instrumentation production is very modern but the vocals themselves are classic Josh/Easton. The modern production should sound good on the speakers. I could easily see this song being played/remixed at the country bars/clubs.\n\nPost by The Brazilian Guy ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· on\n\nAm I the only one hearing a bit of \"Let's Hear it For the Boy\" on that instrumentation? LOL\n\nI quite like this... it's not the best I think he's capable of doing but it's fun and different from the last couple of bland singles he's put out on the last era. I'll have it!"
