        "text": "DETROIT LAKES — The ice may still be on Detroit Lake, but the recent concert announcement that Easton Corbin and Ben Haggard will perform at the Bash on the Beach on Saturday, July 20, may have some people dreaming of summer.\n\nThe concert is part of the Northwest Water Carnival in Detroit Lakes, which is hosted by the Detroit Lakes Jaycees.\n\n“While Haggard is opening for Corbin, I feel like we are bringing in two big names for one night of music,” said the 88th Northwest Water Carnival Admiral Rachel Kohler.\n\nThe Bash on the Beach is traditionally two nights of big-name artists. Kohler said this year is no different.\n\n“We are still finalizing the Friday night show,” the Cormorant resident said. “When we have Friday finalized we will start selling tickets. Until then, we’re being hush-hush about the Friday night act.”\n\nThe 2002 Detroit Lakes High School graduate explained those who purchase tickets for both shows get a discount, and that is often the most popular option. However, when tickets go on sale there will be the option of attending just one show as well.\n\nBringing in big names takes a lot of time and organization, as tour schedules have to line up with the event date, and the contract price has to be in the range of those hiring the artist.\n\n“We started working on this year’s show within a few weeks after our last year’s Northwest Water Carnival ended,” Kohler said.\n\nCorbin was a top pick of past Water Carnival admirals, and Kohler was excited to see his name on the shortlist, too.\n\n“I knew he was our guy,” she said. “He hasn’t been in the area for some time and we thought it would be great to bring in a fresh new face with really good country songs.”\n\nCorbin hit the country music scene in 2009 with his chart-topping “A Little More Country Than That.” Since, he has become an established artist offering a baritone swoon that dances with a mix of traditional and modern country sounds.\n\nKohler said her sister had the pleasure of seeing Corbin in concert and offered a rave review that applauded Corbin’s stage presence and music.\n\n“We were raised with our father playing drums for bands, and grew up with country music, so if my sister says he was great — I will take her at her word,” Kohler said.\n\nThe nonprofit group full of good Samaritans was also pleased to find Haggard was available for the opener slot on Saturday, July 20.\n\nWhen Kohler learned Haggard is the son of country legend Merle Haggard, she tuned in to his music online and discovered an up-and-coming talent with a country vibe that fit with the main act."
