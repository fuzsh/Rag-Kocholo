        "text": "Easton Corbin stopped by The Bobby Bones Show to talk about his new music, how it’s been five years since he last released a project, perform some of his hit songs, and answer uncomfortable questions from listeners where we find out his relationship status!\n\nAlmost 10 years ago, on March 14, 2013, Corbin was one of the first guests on the show. His appearance on the show today (March 13) to talk about his new song “Marry That Girl,” which is his first new song in five years, is a full circle moment. “Marry That Girl” is about appreciating the process before “I Do.” He wrote the song with Shane Minor, Wade Kirby and Adam Craig and the lyrics were inspired by Craig’s wife. During the writing session he told them that he knew he was going to ‘marry that girl’ the first time he saw her. That’s when the idea for the song sparked and it was finished in a few hours.\n\nThe single is from his latest album, Let’s Do Country Right, that came out this past January. That marked five years since he last released a full record. Leading up to that moment, he left his last label and took some time to write and work on music he truly wanted to make. That’s when he found his new label at Stone Country Records. He said, “They say you have your whole life to write your first record and those three years I took off, I felt like I had my whole life again to write a new record.”\n\nCorbin was raised on a small cattle farm in a town in North Florida called Trenton. After school he’d come home and have to do chores on the farm before finishing his schoolwork. He said being raised on a farm taught him a lot of life lessons just about life in general and how when hard work lands on you, it’s up to you to get it done. He started playing guitar at 13-years-old and would practice every day after school, then he started playing at local venues around his hometown but didn’t think he could pursue a career in music at that time. He went to the University of Florida’s College of Agricultural and Life Sciences where he studied a bunch of economic classes.\n\nCorbin feels like his new record is a new version of him and his career. He’s been given a chance to reset and write music he truly loves that feels right to him. When he released his first album in 2010, he wasn’t sure if he’d have success. That album produced two number-one hits and after that a bunch of people wanted to come work together and add something to the new music even though the old music already worked. Being able to take a break and focus on what he truly wants to write about has given him a new passion for his work, he said.\n\nBefore leaving, Corbin answered some uncomfortable questions from listeners:\n\nHow much does he bench press? Not that much. He said a lot of people are much stronger than him.\n\nCan he change a car tire? Yes.\n\nHas he ever been in a bar fight? Almost, but no.\n\nHas he ever had to stop a show cause there was a fight in the crowd? Yes.\n\nDoes he own the red corvette he posted on his Instagram? No. He was playing a FFA event and the guy who put the show together had it and let him drive it. He thought it was cool so he posted a picture of it.\n\nIs he single? Yes."
