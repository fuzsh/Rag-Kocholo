        "text": "Artist Name: Brady Lee\n\nHometown: Milwaukee, WI\n\nWhat project(s) are you currently working on?\n\nI’m spending most of my time right now on my new solo project, which is a pop country sound. We debuted this project on September 25, 2020 and the response has been completely amazing.\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue a career in music and when did you know?\n\nMusic is a part of who I am. I’ve always been a musician. I can’t not write music and play it. I think I was inspired to go all in on music when I was in high school. I played this little open mic night with a friend and some trusted friends and family said they saw something in me.\n\nIf you weren’t pursuing a career in music, what would you be doing for a living?\n\nI really don’t know. I’ve been doing this for so long. This is who I am, and it’s what I’m made to do. I’ve never really thought too much about a plan B. When I was much younger, I was always fascinated by being a lawyer, and so I guess if I had to pick something, it’d be that.\n\nWhat is your favorite downtime activity?\n\nI love being home and playing with my boys. Dinosaurs, diggers, sidewalk chalk, I love it. Being a dad is the greatest job in the world and I wouldn’t trade it for anything!\n\nWho is your biggest celebrity crush?\n\nProbably Ryan Tedder ha! That guy just writes absolute bangers. I want to be best friends with him.\n\nWho is your favorite sports team(s)?\n\nGreen Bay Packers. I’m from Wisconsin, you can’t not love the packers. My wife isn’t a football fan, but she’s a Packers fan. The Packers are kind of a way of life in Wisconsin haha.\n\nWhat is the last movie that you watched?\n\nI’m SO glad this question is on here. My wife and I have been going through movie series, and we just finished the Jurassic Park series. Steven Spielberg is the man!\n\nWhat is the last album you listened to?\n\nKacey Musgraves’ Golden Hour. It’s a fabulous album. I’m always trying to take in new music, but this record has just captivated me and continually holds my attention.\n\nIf you could only listen to one album for the rest of your life, what would it be?\n\nThat is a really tough question. It’s so hard to pick just one record. But if I could only have one, I think I’d want Paradise Valley by John Mayer. There’s just so much goodness on there. It’s a really well done record. You can hear the sweat that went into it.\n\nWhat is the greatest country song of all time?\n\nJust pick a Garth Brooks song and that’ll probably be correct. But seriously, there is so much incredible music out there, and it’s so hard to figure out which songs are going to go down in history. If I had to pick only one country song and put it in a time capsule for the future, I think I’d pick Johnny Cash’s “The Hurt” or Dolly Parton’s “I Will Always Love You.”\n\nWhat has been your favorite city/town that you’ve visited out on the road?\n\nCharleston, South Carolina. That place is just a beautiful piece of this country. The ocean, the pier, the history, all of it. The people there are so kind and loving, and honestly I’ve considered moving there probably a dozen times. There’s this INCREDIBLE barbecue joint called the Smokey Oak there. If you’re on the road with me, and we go anywhere near Charleston, we’re stopping there. No question.\n\nWhat is your favorite meal?\n\nMy mom makes this ridiculous beef stroganoff recipe. It’s served over rice, and I’m 90% sure it calls for ginger ale as well. It’s so good. My mouth is watering just thinking about that dish. I might need to call her after this is over and place an order.\n\nWho is your dream duet partner?\n\nI haven’t “made it” until I’ve done a session with Taylor Swift. That’s been a dream of mine pretty much since I’ve been doing music. She’s a legend in my book.\n\nWho would you like to go on tour with?\n\nHonestly, I’ll tour with anybody. Tours build family bonds. There are so many incredible acts that I respect and I would gladly support any of them. If I had a dream tour, I would want to tour with one of the iconic music acts of the 60’s like Elvis, Johnny Cash, The Beatles, one of those acts.\n\nWhat is your ultimate career goal(s)?\n\nReally, I just want to be the best artist I can be. That’s all there is to it. There are so many goals, including doing an arena tour before I’m thirty, playing a Europe tour, recording a Christmas album, etc. But really, I just want to look back on this journey and say that I gave it everything I had."
