        "text": "WORTHINGTON — The 2022 Windsurfing Regatta and Music Festival will kick off Friday with country music singer Easton Corbin as the headliner. The 2010 Billboard’s Top New Country Artist will kick off the weekend festival at 9 p.m. on Sailboard Beach, on the shores of Lake Okabena.\n\nA Florida native, Corbin entered the country scene in 2010 with his chart-topping debut single “A Little More Country Than That.” He went on to garner another No. 1 hit with the feel-good song, “Roll With It,” as well as seven Top 10 singles throughout his musical career.\n\n“We’re super excited,” said Regatta board chairman Josh Miller of Corbin’s appearance. “I think he is going to be our best one yet.”\n\nCorbin will join other country music acts such as Maiden Dixie, Friday’s opening performer at 7 p.m., and Brad Morgan who will perform Saturday.\n\n“This came with lots of planning from our music committee,” said Miller. “Somehow we’re fortunate enough to land these great artists that we've been able to get over the years.”\n\nFor Corbin, 2020 launched a series of new releases, starting with the release of his singles “Turn Up” and “Didn’t Miss a Beat,” which he performed on NBC’s TODAY Show. Corbin’s EP of the same title, which included songs like “Old Lovers Don't Make Good Friends” and “Back To Me” was released in November that year.\n\nThough Corbin has had many successes in the past decade as an independent artist, he says “A Little More Country Than That” still reflects who he is as an artist and where he sees his career going.\n\n“That’s really how I grew up,” Corbin said in his press bio. “‘A Little More Country Than That’ radiates with me and my band as well because that's really who I am. That’s where I came from; that’s what I am. It’s just as important now as it was then because that’s the one that started it all for me … I think it also defines my audience and who they are.”\n\nDuring his early years, Corbin was surrounded by music. He credits Merle Haggard and Hank Williams as artists who helped define his musical memories. Even then, Corbin knew he wanted to be a country music singer.\n\nNow, over a decade into his career, Corbin is known as a vocalist and “country traditionalist” who weaves timeless story songs together while tipping his hat to the classic country artists who came before him."
