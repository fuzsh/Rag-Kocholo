In all, the Northeast radio veteran has earned 7 national Country Music Association (CMA) Award nominations since 2000, and one nod from the Academy of Country Music (ACM) in 2014.\n\nRichards' passion and reputation in Country Music led to an invitation from the CMA to host and produce the CMA Heritage Artist Panels at the CMA Music Festival in 2013. Richards worked with the CMA to book, host, and produce a groundbreaking reunion of CMA winners from the 70s, 80s and 90s on the CMA 'Close Up' stage at Nashville's Music City Center- an event Richards cites as one of his greatest contributions to Country Music.\n\nKevin Richards began his broadcasting career at the age of 12 on WSCG in Corinth, New York. After winning a contest on the radio, the young country fan found himself applying for a child actor's permit to legally work on the air after school.
