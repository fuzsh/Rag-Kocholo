        "text": "With his simple yet poignant way of capturing universal feelings, Cole Taylor has quickly become an in-demand country music songwriter. Nine months after moving from Cuthbert, Georgia to Music City, Cole signed his first publishing deal in 2013 and has been present on country radio since 2015 with at least one song that he has written being in the top 40 each year. Since then, Cole has been a Sirius XM “Highway Find” with his song “Cold Beer” and had two songs reach #1 on the country music charts; “Sippin’ On Fire” by Florida Georgia Line and “Home Alone Tonight” by Luke Bryan featuring Karen Fairchild of Little Big Town. He has also written songs recorded by Jason Aldean, Cole Swindell, Dylan Scott, Chris Lane, Chase Rice, Jake Owen, Easton Corbin, Jerrod Neimann, Rodney Atkins, Travis Denning & Ryan Hurd.\n\nIn the 8 years since the release of his debut album on Warner Music Nashville, Cole Swindell has toured with the biggest superstars in country music including Luke Bryan, Kenny Chesney, Jason Aldean, Florida Georgia Line, Dierks Bentley and officially became a headliner on his own Reason To Drink Tours in 2018. Swindell has sold out all four of his Down Home Tours in support of the Down Home Sessions I, II, III, IV. He kicked off his headlining Down To Earth Tour in March 2020 and relaunched his show with Thomas Rhett’s Center Point Road Tour in summer 2021. Swindell has racked up an impressive 12 No. 1 songs, the most recent being “She Had Me At Heads Carolina” which sat at the top of the charts for 4 weeks. He was named the NSAI Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2016, winning two CMA Triple Play Awards in both 2015 and again in 2016 and Music Row’s Breakthrough Songwriter of the Year during his debut in 2015 with celebrated songwriting credits which include not only his own but “This Is How We Roll” by Florida Georgia Line, “Get Me Some of That” by Thomas Rhett, and several songs with Luke Bryan including his No. 1 single “Roller Coaster,” among others. The Georgia native has played on some of the biggest stages in the world including making history being the first-ever live radio and TV broadcast from the 57th floor terrace of 4 World Trade Center, overlooking the Freedom Tower where he performed his hit “You Should Be Here.”\n\nBorn in Mobile, Alabama and educated (socially, at the very least) at The Florida State University, Tyler’s hometown sensibility, attitude and humor come across in his songs and through his live performances. As a storyteller, songwriting fits quite naturally for Reeve. “I’m a song guy; I love longs, I love stories, I love the ride music can take you on.” Tyler’s performances are riddled with stories – usually funny ones – about inspiration for his songs, having a few too many, and even spending a night or two in jail. He has had his hand in writing some of country music’s biggest hits in the past few years, including the 2018 BMI Song of the Year “In Case You Didn’t Know” by Brett Young, SiriusXM The Highway’s 2020 Song of the Year and ACM Musical Event of the Year “Does To Me” by Luke Combs featuring Eric Church, and other notable songs “Where I Go When I Drink” by Chris Young and “Whiskey On My Breath” by Love & Theft. Tyler has shared the stage (and the golf course) with heroes and friends alike, including John Daly, Jim Furyk, Randy Houser, Chris Young, Eric Church, Brett Young, Jake Owen and Willie Nelson."
