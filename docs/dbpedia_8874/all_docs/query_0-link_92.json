        "text": "Beale Street dates back to 1841 when it was established by developer Robertson Topp, who named it after a forgotten war hero. Initially, Beale Street served as a bustling commercial district filled with shops, saloons, and theaters, attracting a diverse array of visitors.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Beale Street evolved into a crucial center for African American culture and commerce. It became a hub for Black-owned businesses, clubs, and newspapers. This period also saw the birth of the Beale Street Baptist Church, the first Memphis church built for Blacks and home to the first Black newspaper, The Memphis Free Speech, edited by Ida B. Wells. An Ida B. Wells Plaza & Statue now sits outside the church.\n\nThe emergence of the blues cemented Beale Street's legendary status. Musicians such as W.C. Handy, known as the \"Father of the Blues,\" played a pivotal role in popularizing the genre from this very street. Beale Street clubs and bars became the launching pad for many blues legends like the “King of the Blues” B.B. King, Albert King, Memphis Minnie, Howlin’ Wolf, and so many more. Today, you can visit the WC Handy Home and Museum at the end of Beale Street. An outdoor music venue on the street, Handy Park on Beale, is also named in his honor.\n\nThe mid-20th century brought challenges that left the area in disarray. Yet, in the 1980s, a concerted effort to revitalize Beale Street began, transforming it into a thriving entertainment district once again. Today, Beale Street stands as a testament to Memphis's rich musical legacy and cultural history, drawing millions of visitors who come to experience its unique blend of history, music, and vibrant nightlife.\n\nTHINGS TO SEE & DO ON BEALE\n\nBeale Street Flippers\n\nA Memphis treasure-turned national sensation on America’s Got Talent, the Beale Street Flippers defy gravity with their amazing acrobatics down the center of Beale Street. Don’t be surprised if they call on you to join the show!\n\nRum Boogie Café\n\nEat, drink, boogie, repeat. With a slogan like that, how can you not have a great time? Open 7 days a week until 1 a.m. (2 a.m. on Fri. & Sat.), the fun starts early and includes live music, a delicious Cajun-barbecue menu, and one of the best rum menus east of the Mississippi. Rum Boogie Cafe is also a featured venue for the International Blues Challenge, a music event that attracts thousands to Beale Street for the very best of modern blues.\n\nB.B. King's\n\nWhether it’s blues, soul, or rock ‘n’ roll, you can find your beat at the original legendary B.B. King’s Blues Club. Delicious Southern staples like fried catfish, greens and macaroni and cheese are served alongside Memphis-style ribs and pulled pork. Visit for lunch, dinner or a late-night meal and enjoy live music on the mainstage daily.\n\nA. Schwab\n\nA. Schwab is the city’s oldest and longest-standing store. You'll find everything from products, novelty items, and Memphis-themed souvenirs in the store. Plus, visit the nostalgic soda fountain and share a homemade soda or creamy milkshake, with two straws of course.\n\nSilky O'Sullivan's\n\nDon’t forget your green when you visit Silky O’Sullivan’s pub. Dine inside with your group or visit the patio to check out the tower-climbing goats. Yes, real live goats. It's also the place to be on March 17, during the annual St. Patrick’s Day Parade when Silky O’Sullivan’s charm takes center stage on Beale Street.\n\nFedExForum\n\nGrizzlies and Tigers and … Timberlake! The largest indoor arena in the Mid-South area is home to the NBA’s Memphis Grizzlies and the NCAA Division I University of Memphis Tigers men's basketball team. Plus, some of the world’s biggest performances take the stage throughout the year at the FedExForum.\n\nThe Orpheum Theatre\n\nBroadway shows, live concerts, comedy performance and movie series are some of the events you'll find at the majestic Orpheum Theatre on the corner of Beale St. and Main."
