        "text": "Blake Shelton says of Casi Joy, \"She has this electric energy when she's on stage and has these unique things that she can do vocally. She's an edgier version of a country artist. She's old school but has a youthful energy about her. There's no stopping Casi Joy.\"\n\nWith over 50 million video views online, and 350,000 followers, Joy has captured the attention of music fans around the globe who appreciate the way she melds traditional country and modern pop influences. A seasoned performer, her impressive social media presence eventually led to a highly-touted run on NBC's The Voice, where she instantly turned all four chairs and was singled out by Rolling Stone as having one of the top 10 best blind auditions of all time - a testament to the hard work and dedication of someone who has been performing professionally since the age of five.\n\nCasi began her music career touring the midwest in the country opry circuit. After years of performing country classics, she was spotted and signed by Radio Disney at the age of 14. Shortly after, she took her music to Nashville, where she recorded at legendary RCA Studios.\n\nThere hasn’t been a time in Casi’s life that she hasn’t pursued music, but she’s quite a jack-of-all-trades. Growing up, Casi was involved in several activities including Varsity Soccer (All District), Track (State Sectionals), was captain of the dance team, and was the Student Council class secretary. Her athletic background earned her a track scholarship to Park University, where she graduated Summa Cum Laude with a bachelor’s degree in education. While working her way through college, and touring with her rock band at the time, Casi was also a music instructor at the School of Rock where she then became the director of their Pre-K music program “Little Wing.” In 2015, the songstress knew her true calling was where it all began; country music. She made the move to Nashville on New Years Day. Shortly after, she released her debut EP “Love on Repeat” where she worked with top players in the industry at Sound Stage Studio. Casi’s hard work and dedication paid off when she got the call to be on The Voice. After making it to the live finals on Team Blake, Casi was touring the US and Canada so frequently that she bought a tour bus she now calls home. \"The Joyride\" has given her the ability to spread joy wherever the music takes her, which is something she's worked for since she was five years old.\n\n​\n\nJoy's vibrant stage presence has led to sharing the stage with many notable country acts including Chris Jansen, Montgomery Gentry, Maren Morris, Keith Urban, Carly Pearce, Easton Corbin, Dustin Lynch, LOCASH and other various chart topping artists. Hailing from Kansas City before moving to Nashville, Casi has become a beloved hometown figure. One of her favorite events to come back for is the Kansas City Plaza Lighting seen by 250,000 attendees and half a million television viewers. She has also been invited numerous times to sing her stunning rendition of the National Anthem for the Kansas City Chiefs, American Royal, KC Royals, and Sporting KC.\n\nWhen not touring and performing, Casi can be found writing music and connecting with her booming social media following. The fiery redhead is known for her melodic, personal songwriting, and her close relationship with her fans. Following her time on The Voice, Casi released her highly anticipated, sophomore EP \"The Bright Side,” which debuted at #19 on the iTunes Country Album Charts. Following that success, she released singles \"The Money,\" \"Namaste,\" and \"Senses Fail,\" which received an overwhelming response including premieres and features with People Magazine, CMT, Academy of Country Music, Taste of Country, and Sounds Like Nashville. With a bus load of music on the way, and a tour beginning in November, Casi is poised for a busy and bright future.\n\nAlongside her music, Joy is an advocate for children and animals and has used her musical talent to do extensive charity work for the Craig Morgan Foundation for foster children, Autism Speaks, Pediatric Cancer Research, Children's Mercy, Noah's Bandage Project, Team Smile, Big Slick KC, Animal Justice League of America, Northland Animal Welfare, American Cancer Society, and Suicide Prevention. She also spent many years teaching students and special-needs children voice, piano and guitar."
