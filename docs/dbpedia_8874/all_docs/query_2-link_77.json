        "text": "WORTHINGTON — Worthington’s Windsurfing Regatta and Music Festival has found its headliner in Billboard’s Top New Country Artist of 2010 recipient, Easton Corbin. The “tried-and-true” country vocalist is set to take the stage Friday, June 10, to kick off the weekend festival.\n\nCorbin, a Florida native, hit the country scene back in 2010 with his chart-topping debut single “A Little More Country Than That.” He would go on to garner another No. 1 hit with the feel-good song, “Roll With It,” as well as seven top 10 singles throughout his musical career.\n\n“This came with lots of planning from our music committee,” said Regatta board chairman Josh Miller. “Somehow we’re fortunate enough to land these great artists that we've been able to get over the years.”\n\nCorbin is one of multiple artists who are scheduled to perform during this year’s music festival and, while the full set-list has not yet been released, music committee chairman Barry Roberts said the roll-out is coming soon, and festival organizers are thrilled to have Corbin headlining.\n\n“He's actually someone we have looked at in the past,” Roberts said. “We're glad that we've been able to pull it off and have him come to town.”\n\n2020 launched a series of new releases for Corbin, starting with the release of his infectious singles “Turn Up” and “Didn’t Miss a Beat,” which he performed on NBC’s TODAY Show. Corbin’s EP of the same title, which included a “wide array” of songs like “Old Lovers Don't Make Good Friends” and “Back To Me” was released in November that year.\n\nThough Corbin has had many successes in the past decade as he continues to make music as an independent artist, he says “A Little More Country Than That” still reflects who he is as an artist and where he sees his career going.\n\n“That’s really how I grew up,” Corbin said in his press bio. “‘A Little More Country Than That’ radiates with me and my band as well because that's really who I am. That's where I came from; that's what I am. It's just as important now as it was then because that's the one that started it all for me … I think it also defines my audience and who they are.”\n\nCorbin was surrounded by music as a child. Merle Haggard and Hank Williams stand out as artists who helped define his musical memories. Even then, Corbin knew he wanted to be a country music singer. Now, over a decade into his career, Corbin is known as a vocalist and “country traditionalist” who weaves timeless story songs together while tipping his hat to the classic country artists who came before him.\n\n“We're super excited,” Miller said of Corbin headlining the festival. “I think he is going to be our best one yet.”"
