        "text": "With seven Top 10 hits, two No. 1 singles, and performances on some of the biggest stages in the world, Easton Corbin has made a lasting impression on the country music landscape.\n\nCorbin is known for his signature hits including “A Little More Country Than That,” “Roll with It,” “Lovin’ You Is Fun” and “Baby Be My Love Song” from his No. 1 debuting album, About to Get Real. “Are You with Me” was also the most played song on the radio the day it was released. Easton’s most recent single and title of his current tour “A Girl Like You” is out now. We had the chance to catch up with Easton ahead of his recent show at The Bowl at Sugar Hill.\n\nBy: Lizzy Kidney | Photos by Lizzy Kidney\n\nYou grew up in Trenton, Florida. What kind of influence do you think your hometown had on your music career?\n\nWhen I think of my hometown I think of my friends, family, and the overall way I was raised. All of those things definitely help to embody who I am and have shaped me into the person and musician I am today.\n\nHow do you think you have grown since first starting out in the music industry to now?\n\nI would like to think that I am a better entertainer on stage since I have had a lot more experience. I have been able to go on tour and watch people like Blake Shelton and Carrie Underwood do their thing, and everything I have experienced throughout my career has helped me to write new music and become a stronger musician.\n\nYou have toured with some big names in country music (Rascal Flatts, Blake Shelton, Carrie Underwood). Do you have any fun tour stories?\n\nIt wasn’t fun at the time… but I literally walked off the stage during my first headliner tour with Blake Shelton. He and I were doing an encore together and I remember it was so dark in there that I could barely see, so I ended up actually walking/falling right off the stage! Luckily, I was able to play it off and land on my feet.\n\nWhat has been your most memorable career moment?\n\nProbably playing the Grand Ole Opry for the first time. I grew up watching the Opry with my grandparents every Saturday night and getting the opportunity to actually perform with them in the audience was definitely a full circle moment for me.\n\nWhat is something that is still on your “country music bucket list?”\n\nI definitely would love to work and perform with George Strait!\n\nWhat do you look forward to most about performing?\n\nI love playing for a live audience and watching them sing along with me. It’s a great feeling knowing your songs have made an impact and people are really enjoying them.\n\nDo you have any pre-performance routines?\n\nI always warm up with the guys beforehand and we say a little prayer because I need all of the help I can get!\n\nWith such a busy schedule, what do you enjoy doing in your free time?\n\nWe are always on the go, so whenever I get the chance I love to go fishing, hunting and even ride motorcycles from time to time.\n\nOut of all of the songs you have released, do you have a personal favorite?\n\n“A Little More Country Than That” was my debut single and I love it because I feel like it really helps to describe who I am and where I come from.\n\nYour newest song, “A Girl Like You,” was released last year and was in the Top 5 on the Billboard Charts; it is also the name of your tour. What’s the story behind that one?\n\nWell first of all, it’s a huge honor and dream come true in itself to have a song in the Top 5. As for “A Girl Like You,” you never know when a song is going to speak to you. I remember sitting and listening to it in the studio and really enjoying the message of the song. I kept going back to it thinking, “I can really make this my own,” and I feel like that’s what we did."
