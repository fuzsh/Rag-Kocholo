        "text": "Singer, songwriter, and musician Cody Webb has played hundreds of dates across the country, earning thousands of fans with his keen vocals, meaningful lyrics, and distinctive guitar skills. The most notable part of Cody’s career, was his first cut as a songwriter, “Memories Are Made Of,” co-written with Luke Combs and Ray Fulcher, which was featured on Combs’ debut album, This One’s For You, in 2018. Cody’s music has garnered over 14 million streams across all platforms. The South Carolina native made his first National TV appearance as the featured artist on the 2019 NFL Draft intro, narrated by Dolly Parton. Touring every corner of the US, as well as Canada, and Mexico, Cody has opened shows for acts including Morgan Wallen, Dylan Scott, Sam Hunt, Riley Green, Easton Corbin, Charlie Daniels, LoCash, Cole Swindell and many others. Cody has performed the National Anthem at Dodgers Stadium as well as Bank Of America Stadium. His brand partners include, Natural Light, Lucchese Bootmaker, Pendleton Whisky, South Carolina Department Of Tourism at Lake Murray, Takamine Guitars, PRS Guitars, and more. Having grown up in the smalltown of Ridge Spring, SC, Cody’s childhood consisted of hunting, fishing, sports, and music. His mother was the music minister at his hometown church and his father was a singer-songwriter and musician. It came as no surprise when Cody chose to follow in their footsteps and take his own path into the music world. He began playing guitar at a young age, with musical roots that were planted in southern rock. He was influenced by Lynyrd Skynyrd, Allman Brothers, Pink Floyd, and many other classic rock bands. His first official live performance was at the South Carolina Poultry Festival, playing alongside his father’s band. With shaky hands, at a mere twelve years of age, Cody had his spotlight moment playing the intro to “The Ballad of Curtis Loew.” It was at that moment that Cody knew he wanted to be a guitar player and headline his own shows. Cody attended Clemson University majoring in mechanical engineering while continuing to hone his craft as a musician. “I wanted to play the downtown bars so bad. My first college gig was a party my friends threw during my freshman year. Eventually, I talked a local venue into letting me play one Wednesday. We packed it out and I never had a problem booking a date in Clemson after that. I played as much as I could and saved as much money as I could, knowing Nashville had to be my next destination,”says Cody. Cody has management with Bow To Stern Group alongside Grammy-nominated producer Matt McClure. Cody says, “I believe what I do, starts with a song and that a song is the foundation of what we do in the music business. As an artist, I’ve always wanted to take writing very seriously. I don’t want to put my style in a box; I just want to always release great songs that make me feel something.” Cody continues to release new music every 6-8 weeks through ONE rpm distribution."
