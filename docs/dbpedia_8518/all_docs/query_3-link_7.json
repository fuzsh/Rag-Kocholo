        "text": "The verb depict can be defined as to represent, as a painting or picture does (that's from OED's definition for OP's context).\n\nThere is no \"medium-specific\" verb for representing something in an auditory, olfactory, gustatory, or tactile medium (songs, perfumes, statues, etc.). Figurative use, such as the song depicts [whatever it's supposed to \"reflect, invoke\"] is perfectly common. Otherwise, you can just use to represent in all contexts for all mediums.\n\nThe more \"literal\" general-purpose verbs include invoke, express, emulate, show, suggest, etc. Alternatives which are more \"figurative\" include reflect, capture, encapsulate, etc.\n\nIf it is a digital representation, you could say\n\n\"This MP3\n\nripped\n\ndigitized\n\nencoded\n\ndiscretized\n\nthe Beatles rendition of A Hard Day's Night.\"\n\n(These words may get to the partial representation with some loss of fidelity, but it must be of the original song and band.)\n\nIf it is a group other than the Beatles performing the song, you could say, \"The recording covers The Beatles A Hard Day's Night.\" (This may get to aspect of the imitation or recasting of a song, and must be performed by a different band.)\n\nAnd, for the record, I had no idea that Alvin and the Chipmunks covered A Hard Day's Night.\n\n\"Depict\" is for artistic representation, not recorded or mechanical representation. That is, a \"painting depicts\" and a \"photograph records.\"\n\nHowever, your question appears to be about the representative meaning of a picture vs. the representative meaning of a piece of music. This is also relates to how you experience a painting - you view it. With music, you listen to it.\n\n\"Depicts\" is a description of what the object you are interacting with is \"doing\" (it is \"representing\" something).\n\nA painting \"depicts\" a subject. A musician \"plays\" a score. A singer \"sings\" a song.\n\nWhen a musician plays or singer sings, it is their artistic representation of that music."
