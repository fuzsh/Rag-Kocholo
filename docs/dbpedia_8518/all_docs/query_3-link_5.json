        "text": "Describe what you see/what is visually evident. Long text alternatives for pictures verbally describe the appearance for the benefit of people who are unable to see them. They should simply answer the question, \"What does the image look like?\"\n\n1. Describe From General to Specific\n\nBe logical. In order to be easily understood, image descriptions of pictures should describe according to some logical sequence. Begin with a general overview of what the picture is or portrays, focusing first on an overview before providing details. Following the overview, various portions of the picture can be detailed, in some type of orderly fashion. One tactic is to explain the foreground, mid-ground, and background. In general, provide directions from the perspective of the viewer looking at the picture. For example, refer to the left or right side of a picture as if one was standing in front of it in a gallery. However, when describing people within a photo, it is better to use their perspective. This applies when mentioning a subject's \"left hand\" or \"right shoulder.\"\n\n2. Describe Objectively and Accurately. Don't Describe Motivations or Intentions.\n\nBe objective. Descriptions of pictures should be straightforward and factual. They should avoid interpretations or emotional responses.\n\n3. Be Descriptive. Try to Use Vivid, Imaginative Language.\n\nImage descriptions should utilize vivid terminology to describe various features of the picture. For instance:\n\nIt is best to avoid jargon or specialized terminology that may be unfamiliar."
