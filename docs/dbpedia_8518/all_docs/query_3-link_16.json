The selected gauge will be displayed on the bottom of the slider panel.\n\n“View by Year” (default): Select a year by sliding the year marker on the right to view the amount of relative sea level rise associated with that year for each of the five local sea level rise scenarios on the left (intermediate low, intermediate, intermediate high, high, extreme). Adjust the 1-foot increment map layers (circle) to view the potential inundation impacts for each scenario.\n\n“View by Scenario”: Select a local scenario by sliding the scenario marker on the right to view the amount of relative sea level rise associated with that scenario in 20-year increments displayed on the left. Adjust the 1-foot increment map layers (circle) to view the potential inundation impacts for each year increment.\n\nChoose which sea level rise scenarios to view:\n\n2022 - Based on NOAA, 2022\n\n2017 - Based on NOAA, 2017\n\nUnderstanding the Scenarios\n\n2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report:\n\nThe four relative sea level rise (RSL) scenarios shown in this tab are derived from the 2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report using the same methods as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Sea Level Change Curve Calculator. These new scenarios were developed by the U.S. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force as input into the U.S. Global Change Research Program Sustained Assessment process and, Fifth National Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios provide an update to the NOAA 2017 scenarios, which were developed as input to the Fourth National Climate Assessment.\n\nWhile these RSL scenarios begin in 2005, they have been adjusted to 2000 to more easily compare them with the 2017 RSL scenarios. They take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth’s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.\n\nBy 2050 (relative to sea level in 2000), RSL projections range from 0.40‐0.45 meters along the East Coast, 0.55‐0.65 meters along the Gulf Coast, 0.20‐0.30 meters along the West Coast, 0.20‐0.35 meters along the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands, 0.30 meters along the northern coast of Alaska, and an RSL decrease along the southern coast of Alaska\n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early 1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\n\nAnother important change from the 2017 scenarios is the exclusion of the extreme (2.5 meter) scenario. Based on the most recent scientific understanding, and as discussed in the IPCC AR6, the uncertain physical processes that could lead to much higher increases in sea level are now viewed as less plausible in the coming decades before potentially becoming a factor toward the end of the 21st century. A GMSL increase of 2.5 meters is thus viewed as less plausible and the associated scenario has been removed.\n\n2017 Sea Level Rise Technical Report:\n\nThe five relative sea level rise (RSL) scenarios shown in this tab are derived from NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 083: “Global and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States” using the same methods as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change Curve Calculator. These new scenarios were developed by the Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force, jointly convened by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and the National Ocean Council as input to the USGCRP Sustained Assessment process and Fourth National Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios provide a revision to the global scenarios that were developed (Parris et. al, 2012) as input to the Third National Climate Assessment.\n\nThese RSL scenarios begin in 2000 and take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth’s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.\n\nFor almost all the scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska.\n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early 1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nA RSL-change adjustment to the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001) will cause a minimal offset that may be needed for some applications. The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can correct for this offset.\n\nRounding to the nearest 1-foot mapping increment to view potential impacts is appropriate based on the accuracy of the elevation and tidal surface data used as mapping inputs.\n\nMarsh\n\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map. The selected gauge will be displayed on the bottom of the slider panel.\n\n“View by Year” (default): Select a year by sliding the year marker on the right to view the amount of relative sea level rise associated with that year for each of the five local sea level rise scenarios on the left (intermediate low, intermediate, intermediate high, high, extreme). Adjust the half-foot increment map layers (circle) to view the potential inundation impacts for each scenario.\n\n“View by Scenario”: Select a local scenario by sliding the scenario marker on the right to view the amount of relative sea level rise associated with that scenario in 20-year increments displayed on the left. Adjust the half-foot increment map layers (circle) to view the potential inundation impacts for each year increment.\n\n“Accretion Rate”: Customize the selected accretion rate to reflect sediment accumulation conditions that best reflect your area. These rates are flat values applied across the landscape and can be used to highlight how accretion can offset sea level rise.\n\nChoose which sea level rise scenarios to view:\n\n2022 - Based on NOAA, 2022\n\n2017 - Based on NOAA, 2017\n\nPredictions represent the potential distribution of each wetland type (see legend) based on their elevation and how frequently they may be inundated under each scenario. As sea levels increase, some marshes may migrate into neighboring low-lying areas, while other sections of marsh will change type or be lost to open water.\n\nUnderstanding the Scenarios\n\nThe scenarios are derived from NOAA Sea Level Rise Technical Reports and take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth’s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion. You can learn more about them within the Local Scenarios Tab of this viewer.\n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early 1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur."
