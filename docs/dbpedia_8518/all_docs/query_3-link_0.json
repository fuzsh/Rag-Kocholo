        "text": "'Describe' primarily focuses on presenting or explaining something in words or in written form. It involves providing a detailed account or explanation of a person, object, event, or concept using language. Describing often involves highlighting characteristics, qualities, features, or attributes to create a verbal image or understanding of the subject. 'Depict', on the other hand, is mainly concerned with providing an image of the subject that represents its qualities and characteristics, either through verbal or visual media such as paintings and pictures. For example:\n\nIn her essay, she described the historical events leading up to the revolution in great detail.\n\nThe author vividly described the breathtaking sunset.\n\nThe photographer's black and white images powerfully depict the harsh realities of poverty.\n\nThe novel adeptly depicts the complexities of human relationships in a small town."
