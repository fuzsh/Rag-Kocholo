        "text": "Alternative (Alt) Text is an essential part of making content accessible. When adding images, charts, icons or other graphic elements, alt text should be added to ensure your content will be accessible to all users.\n\nWhat is Alt Text?\n\nAlt Text is a brief text description of an image.\n\nAlt Text is read by screen readers (or other assistive tech) to provide information about the image's purpose to the reader.\n\nAlt text should not just describe what the image contains, but instead should provide context on how the image relates to the page content.\n\nAlt Text Best Practices\n\nKeep it short, usually 1-2 sentences. Don’t overthink it.\n\nConsider key elements of why you chose this image for your document, instead of describing every little detail.\n\nNo need to say “image of”or “picture of.”\n\nBut, do say if it’s a logo, illustration, painting, or cartoon.\n\nDon’t duplicate text that’s adjacent in the document or website\n\nEnd the alt text sentence with a period.\n\nHow to Write Alt Text\n\nImages\n\nWhen adding images, consider why you have chosen that particular image and what you want it to convey.\n\nExample: This image will be used on a page about track tryouts.\n\nPoor Alt Text: \"Harvard Runners.\"\n\nUseful Alt Text: \"Harvard Stadium with two lone runners bounding up the steps.\"\n\nLogos\n\nAlt text for logos should reference the image's purpose. They may or may not include the word logo.\n\nExample: This is Harvard's classic shield used on many branded materials.\n\nPoor Alt text: \"Harvard.\"\n\nUseful Alt text: \"Harvard's Crimson Veritas Shield.\"\n\nIcons\n\nAlt text for icons should be the equivalent to the information intended by the icon, such as “Download PDF” or “Visit our Facebook Page.”\n\nExample: This printer icon will be used on a page with a schedule of events.\n\nPoor Alt Text: \"Printer icon.\"\n\nUseful Alt Text: \"Print the Event Schedule.\"\n\nImages as Links\n\nIf the image is being used to link to another page, the alt text should describe what will happen when the image is clicked (rather than what it looks like).\n\nExample: This question mark links to a help page and is intended to encourage users to click if they need support.\n\nPoor Alt Text: \"Question Mark.\"\n\nUseful Alt Text: \"Contact Support.\"\n\nAdditional Benefits of Adding Alt Text\n\nIt is indexed by search engines.\n\nIt also will display if the image fails to load, as in this example of a missing image:\n\nTesting\n\nUse testing tools to hide images and display their alt text. Does the page make sense with the images hidden, replaced by their text alternatives?\n\nDo all linked images meaningfully describe their action rather than their appearance?\n\nResources"
