        "text": "Answer:\n\nI would have been able to give a more specific answer if you had provided some more information about the context in which you wish to use the word \"depict\" and what the table that you wish to describe presents. Under the present circumstances, I can only give a generic reply. Grammatically speaking, it would not be incorrect to use the word \"depict\" to describe a table in text. For example, \"Table 1.2 depicts the data that were collected from the first group of patients.\" I would say \"presents\" or \"shows\" are better word choices; however, you can also use \"depicts.\"\n\nRelated reading:"
