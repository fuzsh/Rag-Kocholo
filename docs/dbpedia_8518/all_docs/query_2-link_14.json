        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn recent years, forensic radiography has seen significant advances and evolved into a powerful tool in forensic medicine (Obafunwa et al. 2015; Schuliar & Knudsen 2012). Forensic pathologists use forensic radiography to provide information on a deceased person’s autopsy findings and to solve criminal cases. Forensic radiography examinations are performed on the deceased (i.e. a corpse) and living persons, for example, in cases of child, spouse or elderly abuse (Kahana & Hiss 1999; Rohringer et al. 2020). For the purpose of this article, forensic radiography refers to radiographic examinations of the deceased. In South Africa, it is the promulgated responsibility of the health department in each province to provide forensic services, and among others, to conduct a diagnostic internal postmortem examination (South African Government 2004).\n\nAll medicolegal postmortem examinations are performed by a forensic medical practitioner (FMP), who could be a qualified forensic pathologist, registrar (resident, or forensic pathologist-in-training) or a medical officer, to establish the cause of and circumstances surrounding death (Dempers et al. 2018). Viner (2005) concluded that forensic radiography in South Africa was mainly performed by pathologists and, in some instances, police technicians. Importantly, in most cases diagnostic radiographers who were undertaking forensic radiological examinations lacked the training demanded for that specific type of work. Furthermore, at the Salt River mortuary in Cape Town, prior to obtaining a mobile C-arm fluoroscopy unit, forensic cases that required forensic radiography were transported to Groote Schuur Hospital for imaging on the newly acquired digital imaging Lodox Statscan. To provide a forensic radiography imaging service in the forensic pathology mortuary at Salt River would require the daily presence of a radiographer. The lack of resources (funds) and radiographers has resulted in pathologists performing fluoroscopy themselves, although they had received insufficient training on X-ray imaging equipment (Viner 2005).\n\nForensic radiography assists in judicial investigations as a subfield of forensic science and medicine (Elifritz et al. 2014). The courts in South Africa do not define standards of expertise for imaging by radiographers or forensic pathologists (K. Bolton [Associate Professor of Paediatrics, University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg] pers. comm., 09 May 2022). According to Bolton, within the adversarial nature of the South African system, if a forensic pathologist gives evidence in a criminal case (e.g. for the State) on an X-ray that he or she has taken or interpreted, the defence counsel will interrogate the experience and expertise of the pathologist in this area. The defence counsel may use their own expert to give another opinion. The technical quality of the study will often be crucial. Therefore, it is important for pathologists performing forensic radiography to be trained to produce acceptable images. It is crucial that whoever performs the procedure must be trained in protecting themselves and their staff members from excess radiation (K. Bolton, pers. comm., 09 May 2022).\n\nConsequently, it is important to highlight that personnel performing forensic radiography should have thorough training in the use of the imaging equipment and how radiographs must be taken. Radiographers who are familiar with and trained in forensic radiography might not always be available (Wilson, Bonner & Rutty 2004). Possible reasons for the unavailability of radiographers could be that they are not being trained in forensic radiography, posts are not available and radiographers prefer not to perform forensic radiography because of the physical and emotional challenges (Sangonuga, Kekana & Eze 2022).\n\nPhotography, radiography and light microscopy are standard imaging methods used in forensic investigations (Aalders et al. 2017). Technological advances have allowed for the development of new, more powerful imaging methods for forensic purposes, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and also expanded the scope of imaging in forensic radiography (Sangonuga et al. 2022). Aspects of acquiring imaging that influence image quality may also be considered, including the acquisition protocol and the personnel who perform forensic radiography, such as radiographers or forensic technologists who receive in-service training.\n\nRadiographers who perform forensic radiography, for example, are required to complete postgraduate training and should be registered with the International Association of Forensic Radiographers and the Society of Radiographers in Australia and the United Kingdom (Johnson 2014). These professional organisations offer postgraduate training and seminars for forensic radiographers to develop the competence necessary to produce high-quality diagnostic images (Sangonuga 2020). Forensic radiographers should adhere to protocols in order to produce high-quality images that will be accepted in a criminal court (Kudlas, Odle & Kisner 2010; Johnson 2014).\n\nPersonnel performing forensic radiography have been identified as radiographers trained in the specific imaging modality or autopsy technicians certified in-service (Aalders et al. 2017). However, specific protocols applicable to forensic radiography have yet to be standardised (Karalis & Denton 2016). There is limited information available in the literature within the South African context on the specific training that forensic radiographers or personnel performing forensic radiography have to undergo, the knowledge required regarding the equipment used and the maintenance of forensic radiology equipment. The standard or level of knowledge needs to be clearly defined.\n\nThe Colleges of Medicine of South Africa (CMSA) is the national examining body for the medical professions of 29 constituent colleges, including the College of Forensic Pathologists of South Africa. The latter offers one specialist or fellowship and three diploma qualifications, including (1) Fellowship of the College of Forensic Pathologists of South Africa – FC for Path(SA); (2) Diploma in Forensic Medicine of the College of Forensic Pathologists of South Africa – Clin: Dip For Med(SA) Clin; (3) Diploma in Forensic Medicine of the College of Forensic Pathologists of South Africa – Clin/Path: Dip For Med(SA) Clin Path; and (4) Diploma in Forensic Medicine of the College of Forensic Pathologists of South Africa – Path: Dip For Med(SA) Path (T Naidoo [President of the College of Forensic Pathologists of South Africa] pers. comm., 17 May 2022).\n\nForensic imaging is embedded in the general overall learning outcomes, detailed learning objectives and respective logbook requirements of the aforementioned examinations. However, the related technical instruction is provided by the individual training institutions across the country (i.e. Health Professions Council of South Africa accredited University Departments of Forensic Medicine or other Clinical Forensic Medicine Departments, where applicable). The practical training in operational and diagnostic forensic radiology is therefore variable and not standardised (T. Naidoo, pers. comm., 17 May 2022).\n\nThe key user training is provided by Lodox to forensic pathologists at the site. In some cases, Lodox equipment training may be extended to the forensics officers (W. Papane [Sales and Marketing Executive, Lodox] pers. comm., 09 May 2022). At the forensic mortuaries where Lodox equipment has been installed (listed in ), no radiographers are employed. With the Lodox, it is not necessary to manually select the exposure factors. However, the procedure (i.e. full-body antero-posterior [AP]) and the size (i.e. weight) selection are the two factors that will determine the kV and mA used. The exposures are preset according to the weight and procedure protocol selected. Changing the kilovolt peak (kVp) and milliampere-second (mAs) is not required (B. Nkosi [Clinical Applications Specialist Lodox] pers. comm., 17 May 2022).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nProvinceDate of installation Western Cape George Forensics11 May 2015Tygerberg Mortuary12 April 2020Salt River Forensics31 March 2015Observatory Forensic Pathology Institute03 May 2022 Gauteng Germiston Forensics12 December 2011Pretoria Forensics06 June 2014Hillbrow Forensics25 August 2014Ga-Rankuwa Forensics25 February 2015 KwaZulu-Natal Pinetown Medico Legal Mortuary12 April 2021Richards Bay Forensics26 July 2016Phoenix Forensics28 July 2016 Free State Bloemfontein Forensic Pathology Service (FPS)22 January 2020 Limpopo Polokwane FPS12 March 2020 Mpumalanga Middelburg FPS02 December 2016Ermelo FPS11 November 2016Themba FPS12 March 2020\n\nThe guidelines of the Directorate: Radiation Control (DRC) indicate that in South Africa, only radiographers and radiologists registered with the HPCSA and chiropractors registered with the Allied HPCSA (AHPCSA) may operate X-ray equipment for medical use in their scope of practice (Department of Health 2016). However, in the code of practice for users of nonmedical equipment, the operators may be persons either qualified in radiography and radiology or ‘appropriately trained forensic personnel’ (Department of Health 2014). The licence holder of the forensic radiology equipment must ensure that it is used and maintained by competent, accountable and professionally skilled personnel. The licence holder must ascertain that radiation quality control (QC) tests are conducted at prescribed frequencies to monitor the forensic radiology imaging equipment’s safe and correct use (Department of Health 2014, 2016). The licence holder must also ensure that radiation levels are monitored and within appropriate levels in the work environment.\n\nThe Western Cape Forensic Pathology Service currently has 18 forensic mortuaries that vary in size and function, from the two large academic centres in Cape Town to small rural facilities (G. Kirk [Clinical Unit Head – Forensic Pathology Service (FPS), Western Cape Government, and Senior Lecturer, Division of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town] pers. comm., 22 April 2022). The larger facilities such as those in Cape Town, George, Paarl, Knysna and Worcester have their own radiology equipment, while other facilities use the local provincial hospital radiology departments. In the Western Cape FPS, all radiological examinations must be carried out by a medical practitioner, although they can be assisted by a forensic pathology officer (G. Kirk, pers. comm., 22 April 2022).\n\nThe Gauteng northern region has three forensic pathology facilities (S. Rossouw [Acting Head, Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Pretoria] pers. comm., 06 May 2022). The Pretoria facility is affiliated with the University of Pretoria, the Ga-Rankuwa facility is affiliated with the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University and a small mortuary in Bronkhorstspruit is staffed by a sessional medical officer (S. Rossouw, pers. comm., 06 May 2022).\n\nThere are 11 forensic mortuaries in the Free State province ( ). Forensic imaging equipment is only available at the mortuary in Bloemfontein. Therefore, corpses from the mortuaries in Welkom, Kroonstad and Sasolburg are transferred to the Bloemfontein forensic mortuary for forensic radiography examinations (O. Kopane [Mortuary Manager, Welkom, Kroonstad and Sasolburg] pers. comm., 27 April 2022). The researchers were not able to obtain information pertaining to the knowledge and training of personnel at these mortuaries and deemed it important to address this gap.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nFacilityRegionBloemfonteinFree State, SouthernBotshabelo Holding FacilityFree State, SouthernJagersfontein Holding FacilityFree State, SouthernSmithfield Holding FacilityFree State, SouthernBethlehemFree State, EasternPhuthaditjhabaFree State, EasternHarrismith Holding FacilityFree State, EasternFicksburg Holding FacilityFree State, EasternWelkomFree State, NorthernKroonstadFree State, NorthernSasolburgFree State, Northern\n\nIn other words, in South Africa, no nationally agreed curriculum or coordinated forensic radiography training has been proposed. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the level of knowledge and training of forensic pathologists (consultants) and registrars (forensic pathologists-in-training) who perform forensic radiography at a selected forensic pathology mortuary in the Free State province of South Africa.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and training of personnel performing forensic radiography at a mortuary. Radiographers are skilled in both obtaining X-ray images and applying information that would assist to control the patient (Tarani et al. 2017). As discussed above, this specific accessible population did not include radiographers. According to the Department of Health, a radiation worker is anyone who works in an occupation that brings them into contact with more than three-tenths of the occupational dose limit (Department of Health 2014). A pathologist, therefore, is a radiation worker who may operate X-ray equipment for nonmedical purposes (Department of Health 2014).\n\nThe identified radiation worker is then issued with personal radiation monitoring devices (PRMDs). A PRMD continuously monitors the environment and the dosage of radiation that their bodies have been exposed to. Contrary to this information, all the participants (n = 8) indicated that they were not registered radiation workers, and four (50.0%) of them used radiation monitoring devices. Personal radiation monitoring devices are issued to radiation workers in South Africa by the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) Holdings (Pty) Ltd. Radiation Protection Services, and each monitoring device has a unique Bureau Identification Number (BIN) that is allocated by Radiation Protection Services to a specific registered radiation worker. The PRMD must be replaced in less than 32 days, and records of the exposure must be kept on record by the service provider for 10 years (Department of Health 2014). Hence, it might be possible that the participants were not adequately informed that they were considered to be radiation workers.\n\nIn a study performed on the experiences of forensic pathologists and radiographers in providing forensic radiography services, the findings indicated that the participants did not receive any training on forensic radiography. Furthermore, they also indicated that there was no forensic radiography available and that they had to learn on the job (Sangonuga et al. 2022). In terms of the current study performed in the Free State province (South Africa), only three (37.5%) participants stated that they had received training to operate forensic radiography equipment. One (12.5%) of the participants indicated that training was received to operate the C-arm machine. This finding emphasises the need for training to adhere to the requirement that the licence holder of X-ray machine equipment must ensure that all personnel using the equipment must be trained (Department of Health 2014).\n\nSix (75.0%) participants had not received training on technical factors, such as exposure settings. The majority (n = 7; 87.5%) of participants stated that the Lodox full-body scanner was the most frequently used machine, followed by the C-arm machine (n = 2; 25.0%). Therefore, exposure setting would not be required as these two machines employ automatic exposure control. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the planned Lodox training at this site was postponed.\n\nRadiation workers are provided with appropriate protective clothing and safety instructions and guidelines (Department of Health 2016). All forensic personnel within 1 m of an X-ray tube or a corpse must wear protective clothing with the specific lead equivalence of 0.35 mm Pb plus a thyroid shield and leaded glasses (Department of Health 2014). It is important to highlight that not all participants in this study were aware that they should use protective gear when using radiation-emitting devices.\n\nHalf of the participants expressed an interest in receiving training on how to conduct QC tests on the forensic radiography equipment they used at the forensic mortuary. The use of X-ray equipment is controlled by the Hazardous Substances Act 15 of 1973 (DoH 1973, DoH 2016). This legislation requires that an inspection body, approved by the Department of Health, must perform an initial acceptance test of all X-ray equipment and regularly perform safety testing (DoH 2016). Every machine must be licensed, and the licence holder of X-ray equipment must appoint in writing an appropriately trained person to take responsibility for the safe use of the equipment, training of staff members and that QC tests are performed (DoH 2016). The equipment used for nonmedical forensic purposes must also be maintained by the licence holder and responsible person and the safe use of the equipment must be monitored on a regular basis. A register must be kept of the X-ray examinations with specific reference to the name of the operator and the deceased, the date, the reason for the examination and the dose or exposure time of the procedure. Quality control of the equipment is mentioned as record-keeping for inspection pertaining to the service record of the equipment and the protective clothing that must be tested twice a year. The code further indicates that records must be available for inspection by the DRC (Department of Health 2014). The researchers therefore assume that records of training and QC tests will be maintained by the licence holder and responsible person for inspection by the DRC.\n\nAbout one-fourth (n = 2; 25.0%) of the participants indicated that protocols were not followed when performing forensic radiography. Three (37.5%) participants were unsure or unaware of forensic radiography imaging protocols. It could be argued that they either did not know about forensic radiography imaging protocols or were unaware because they had not received any formal training. Aalders et al. (2017) emphasised that the forensic radiography protocol applied for acquiring images affects image quality. Furthermore, Flach et al. (2014) emphasised that personnel performing forensic radiography on advanced imaging equipment, such as CT, should adhere to medicolegal requirements in terms of image quality, protocols and standards. Furthermore, the importance of best practice in forensic imaging, including medicolegal requirements, has been emphasised by Doyle et al. (2020).\n\nThe participants at the selected site performed forensic radiography to determine the cause of death or for judiciary purposes. For authentication purposes, all radiography images must have a correct anatomical lead (side) marker according to best practice standards (Johnson 2014; Sebelego, Van der Merwe & Du Plessis 2019). The date of imaging should be clearly recorded so that the person who acquired the image might be held accountable in both criminal and civil cases, if necessary (Johnson 2014). It is evident that the use of such markers needs to be highlighted in the areas in which training is required. Three (37.5%) of the participants were unaware that the placement of lead markers was a part of forensic records. As three (37.5%) participants did not answer this question, it would be reasonable to assume that they were either unsure about or did not know this."
