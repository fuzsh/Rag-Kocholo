The ground over which Lieutenant Inkson had to move was much exposed, there being no cover available.\n\nCitation\n\n20th April, 1900 At Wakkerstroom, on the evening of the 20th April, 1900, during the advance of the Infantry to support the Mounted Troops, Lieutenant Nickerson went, in the most gallant manner, under a heavy rifle and shell fire, to attend a wounded man, dressed his wounds, and remained with him till he had him conveyed to a place of safety."
