        "text": "MoSCoW Prioritization Categories\n\n1. Must-have initiatives\n\nAs the name suggests, this category consists of initiatives that are “musts” for your team. They represent non-negotiable needs for the project, product, or release in question. For example, if you’re releasing a healthcare application, a must-have initiative may be security functionalities that help maintain compliance.\n\nThe “must-have” category requires the team to complete a mandatory task. If you’re unsure about whether something belongs in this category, ask yourself the following.\n\nIf the product won’t work without an initiative, or the release becomes useless without it, the initiative is most likely a “must-have.”\n\n2. Should-have initiatives\n\nShould-have initiatives are just a step below must-haves. They are essential to the product, project, or release, but they are not vital. If left out, the product or project still functions. However, the initiatives may add significant value.\n\n“Should-have” initiatives are different from “must-have” initiatives in that they can get scheduled for a future release without impacting the current one. For example, performance improvements, minor bug fixes, or new functionality may be “should-have” initiatives. Without them, the product still works.\n\n3. Could-have initiatives\n\nAnother way of describing “could-have” initiatives is nice-to-haves. “Could-have” initiatives are not necessary to the core function of the product. However, compared with “should-have” initiatives, they have a much smaller impact on the outcome if left out.\n\nSo, initiatives placed in the “could-have” category are often the first to be deprioritized if a project in the “should-have” or “must-have” category ends up larger than expected.\n\n4. Will not have (this time)\n\nOne benefit of the MoSCoW method is that it places several initiatives in the “will-not-have” category. The category can manage expectations about what the team will not include in a specific release (or another timeframe you’re prioritizing).\n\nPlacing initiatives in the “will-not-have” category is one way to help prevent scope creep. If initiatives are in this category, the team knows they are not a priority for this specific time frame.\n\nSome initiatives in the “will-not-have” group will be prioritized in the future, while others are not likely to happen. Some teams decide to differentiate between those by creating a subcategory within this group.\n\nHow Can Development Teams Use MoSCoW?\n\nAlthough Dai Clegg developed the approach to help prioritize tasks around his team’s limited time, the MoSCoW method also works when a development team faces limitations other than time. For example:\n\nPrioritize based on budgetary constraints.\n\nWhat if a development team’s limiting factor is not a deadline but a tight budget imposed by the company? Working with the product managers, the team can use MoSCoW first to decide on the initiatives that represent must-haves and the should-haves. Then, using the development department’s budget as the guide, the team can figure out which items they can complete.\n\nPrioritize based on the team’s skillsets.\n\nA cross-functional product team might also find itself constrained by the experience and expertise of its developers. If the product roadmap calls for functionality the team does not have the skills to build, this limiting factor will play into scoring those items in their MoSCoW analysis.\n\nPrioritize based on competing needs at the company.\n\nCross-functional teams can also find themselves constrained by other company priorities. The team wants to make progress on a new product release, but the executive staff has created tight deadlines for further releases in the same timeframe. In this case, the team can use MoSCoW to determine which aspects of their desired release represent must-haves and temporarily backlog everything else.\n\nWhat Are the Drawbacks of MoSCoW Prioritization?\n\nAlthough many product and development teams have prioritized MoSCoW, the approach has potential pitfalls. Here are a few examples.\n\n1. An inconsistent scoring process can lead to tasks placed in the wrong categories.\n\nOne common criticism against MoSCoW is that it does not include an objective methodology for ranking initiatives against each other. Your team will need to bring this methodology to your analysis. The MoSCoW approach works only to ensure that your team applies a consistent scoring system for all initiatives.\n\nPro tip: One proven method is weighted scoring, where your team measures each initiative on your backlog against a standard set of cost and benefit criteria. You can use the weighted scoring approach in ProductPlan’s roadmap app.\n\n2. Not including all relevant stakeholders can lead to items placed in the wrong categories.\n\nTo know which of your team’s initiatives represent must-haves for your product and which are merely should-haves, you will need as much context as possible.\n\nFor example, you might need someone from your sales team to let you know how important (or unimportant) prospective buyers view a proposed new feature.\n\nOne pitfall of the MoSCoW method is that you could make poor decisions about where to slot each initiative unless your team receives input from all relevant stakeholders.\n\n3. Team bias for (or against) initiatives can undermine MoSCoW’s effectiveness.\n\nBecause MoSCoW does not include an objective scoring method, your team members can fall victim to their own opinions about certain initiatives.\n\nOne risk of using MoSCoW prioritization is that a team can mistakenly think MoSCoW itself represents an objective way of measuring the items on their list. They discuss an initiative, agree that it is a “should have,” and move on to the next.\n\nBut your team will also need an objective and consistent framework for ranking all initiatives. That is the only way to minimize your team’s biases in favor of items or against them.\n\nWhen Do You Use the MoSCoW Method for Prioritization?\n\nMoSCoW prioritization is effective for teams that want to include representatives from the whole organization in their process. You can capture a broader perspective by involving participants from various functional departments.\n\nAnother reason you may want to use MoSCoW prioritization is it allows your team to determine how much effort goes into each category. Therefore, you can ensure you’re delivering a good variety of initiatives in each release.\n\nWhat Are Best Practices for Using MoSCoW Prioritization?\n\nIf you’re considering giving MoSCoW prioritization a try, here are a few steps to keep in mind. Incorporating these into your process will help your team gain more value from the MoSCoW method.\n\n1. Choose an objective ranking or scoring system.\n\nRemember, MoSCoW helps your team group items into the appropriate buckets—from must-have items down to your longer-term wish list. But MoSCoW itself doesn’t help you determine which item belongs in which category.\n\nYou will need a separate ranking methodology. You can choose from many, such as:\n\nWeighted scoring\n\nValue vs. complexity\n\nKano model\n\nBuy-a-feature\n\nOpportunity scoring\n\nFor help finding the best scoring methodology for your team, check out ProductPlan’s article: 7 strategies to choose the best features for your product.\n\n2. Seek input from all key stakeholders.\n\nTo make sure you’re placing each initiative into the right bucket—must-have, should-have, could-have, or won’t-have—your team needs context.\n\nAt the beginning of your MoSCoW method, your team should consider which stakeholders can provide valuable context and insights. Sales? Customer success? The executive staff? Product managers in another area of your business? Include them in your initiative scoring process if you think they can help you see opportunities or threats your team might miss.\n\n3. Share your MoSCoW process across your organization.\n\nMoSCoW gives your team a tangible way to show your organization prioritizing initiatives for your products or projects.\n\nThe method can help you build company-wide consensus for your work, or at least help you show stakeholders why you made the decisions you did.\n\nCommunicating your team’s prioritization strategy also helps you set expectations across the business. When they see your methodology for choosing one initiative over another, stakeholders in other departments will understand that your team has thought through and weighed all decisions you’ve made.\n\nIf any stakeholders have an issue with one of your decisions, they will understand that they can’t simply complain—they’ll need to present you with evidence to alter your course of action.\n\nRelated Terms"
