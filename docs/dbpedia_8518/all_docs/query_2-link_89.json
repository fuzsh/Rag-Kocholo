Read about the styles and map projection used in the above map (Physical Map of KROONSTAD).\n\nPhysical map\n\nPhysical map illustrates the mountains, lowlands, oceans, lakes and rivers and other physical landscape features of KROONSTAD. Differences in land elevations relative to the sea level are represented by color.\n\nGreen color represents lower elevations, orange or brown indicate higher elevations, shades of grey are used for the highest mountain ranges in the world. Underwater topography is represented by blues. Darker blues are used for the deepest water, lighter shades of blue represent shallower water such as the continental shelf.\n\nGeographic map projection\n\nA map projection is a way how to transform points on a Earth to points on a map. This map of KROONSTAD uses Plate Carree projection. The Plate Carree projection is a simple cylindrical projection originated in the ancient times. It has straight and equally spaced meridians and parallels that meet at right angles.\n\nAll projections from a sphere to a plane are distorted. The drawback of the Plate Carree projection is that it doesn't make an attempt to compensate for these distortions. For the general view of KROONSTAD, this is not a significant problem. The detailed maps use the Mercator projection which preserves the shape of small areas better.\n\nTechnology\n\nWe unlock the value hidden in the geographic data. Thanks to automating the complex process of turning data into map graphics, we are able to create maps in higher quality, faster and cheaper than was possible before.\n\nForever free\n\nWe created Maphill to make the web a more beautiful place.

Maps are assembled and kept in a high resolution vector format throughout the entire process of their creation.\n\nExperience of discovering\n\nMaphill maps will never be as detailed as Google maps or as precise as designed by professional cartographers. Our goal is different. We want to redefine the experience of discovering the world through the maps.\n\nFast anywhere\n\nMaps are served from a large number of servers spread all over the world. Globally distributed map delivery network ensures low latency and fast loading times, no matter where on Earth you happen to be.\n\nSpread the beauty\n\nEmbed the above physical map of KROONSTAD into your website.
