        "text": "AMRIT RAI, son of Chhail Rai, a Bhatt of LAHORE, and pupil of Chatar Das, a noted poet, had completed his Ras Ratnakar and Chitra Bilas ( the latter in 1679) before he came under the patronage of GURU Gobind SINGH at ANANDPUR. What is left of his compositions while with the Guru is his rendering in Hindi verse ofaparva or part from the Mahabharata and a stanza quoted by Bhai Santokh Singh, Sri Gur Pratap Suraj GRANTH (q.v.), ntu 5, arisu 26. In the latter stanza Amrit Rai sings the fame of the Guru as a bounteous patron and offers himself for service. The former, entitled Sabha Parab, was completed on Baisakh vadi`2, 1753 Bk/ 8 April 1696. The only known GURMUKHI manuscript of this work is preserved in the private collection of the Maharaja of PATIALA.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Kahn Singh, Bhai, Gurushabad Ratnakar Mahan Kosh.
