        "text": "Exciting news for the BIM and construction management community. I‚Äôm excited to announce the launch of our new plugin that helps calculate the number of full and cut tiles required for a project, as well as the amount of waste generated. This plugin is designed to help builders and contractors optimize their tile usage, reduce waste, and save money. But that‚Äôs not all. This plugin also has a positive impact on the environment. By reducing the amount of waste generated, we‚Äôre helping to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability in the building industry. This is an important step towards a greener future. This remarkable feat was made possible through the unwavering dedication and expert guidance of our R&D Manager, Eng. Mohamed ElSarha, and with invaluable support from Eng. Islam Heakal. The \"Waste of Tiles\" plugin has been meticulously created to address the following key functionalities: 1- Calculate floor tiles and efficiently estimate waste in the entire building effortlessly. 2-Obtain completed and uncompleted tile counts for each room, level, floor type, and the entire building. 3-Provide essential dimensions for each floor type. 4-Determine the required amounts of sand and mortar for floor finishes in each room and the entire building. 5-Accurately assess and manage tile wastage in individual rooms, levels, types, and the entire building. By utilizing the \"Waste of Tiles\" plugin, we can streamline our flooring processes and ensure optimal resource utilization, resulting in higher project quality and reduced material wastage. I am excited to announce that version 2 of our plugin will be published soon. Stay tuned for more updates. #Redcon #RedconConstruction #autodesk #revit #construction #bim #development #csharp #programming #wpf #bimservices #sustainability #architecture #waste #plugin #cost #carbonemissions\n\nüîçüè†‚ú® If you want your custom home to be built the way it was designed and at the budget promised, you should know these three things: 1. In the agreement between a client and their architect, the architect warrants that their work will meet a level known as ‚ÄúStandard of Care‚Äù. This is defined to mean that the architect will exercise the same care and diligence in performing its duties as other architects engaged in similar work. Errors and omissions are to be expected and viewed as honest mistakes; perfection is not the standard or expectation. Those plans often contain a number of errors and omissions, some significant. This is because it‚Äôs simply not possible for the architect or engineers to foresee every possible detail that will be needed or conflicts that will be encountered between architecture, engineering, systems and assemblies. This is beyond the typical scope of work of the design consultants, and, not to discredit them in any way, their level of expertise. 2. This ‚Äúgap‚Äù between the information within the design documents, the expectation of the builder is generally not well understood by the owner. And the contractor‚Äôs typical 5% contingency is often inadequate to cover these unforeseen costs. When one considers that rework adds 10% (or up to 30%) to the cost and 20% time to the schedule of a ‚Äútypical‚Äù construction project, the added expense to the client to get their home built can be substantial. 3. Pre-construction analysis and modeling is the way to mitigate these additional costs. By constructing the project in a 3D model(or prototyping your home), following the plans and specifications, those issues that would be so costly to correct in construction reveal themselves in the model, where they‚Äôre a lot easier to investigate and correct. This allows the field crews to build the project correctly in the field the first time.

Design assist is a process where a mass timber manufacturer is brought on board alongside a project's design team (architect and engineer) during the design phase to help tailor the design toward solutions that are efficient. Specifically a lens toward creating a mass timber package which promotes ease and speed of fabrication and construction is leveraged. Does every mass timber project need this? No. But many could benefit from it. Let's discuss the when and the whyüëá If you are going to work with a manufacturer on design assist, when should they be brought in? 50% - 100% Schematic Design (SD) phase is usually a good target. At this point in time: ‚úÖ General building massing is set ‚úÖ Occupant needs are identified ‚úÖ Preliminary grid and framing is proposed ‚úÖ Construction type and fire ratings are known but ‚ùé Member sizes are still a bit fluid ‚ùé Construction install sequencing isn't set ‚ùé Structural framing and details are not locked in 100% This allows the design assist partner to provide incremental input (think tweaks not tear down and start over). Which leads us to the why: Why engage a mass timber manufacturer to provide design assist services? You might be new to mass timber design. Or not familiar with the common styles of connections and details. Or perhaps your design isn't maximizing the efficiencies and capabilities of the specific manufacturer involved (since each has differences in species and structural properties, member sizes/press capabilities, CNC fabrication and tooling, etc.). This collaborative design process between AE and design assist partner helps make small changes like adjustments in grid, modifications in detailing style, dialing in member sizes and updating panel layouts which both minimize cost and waste, while designing with efficient construction logistics in mind. It also helps you avoid RFIs and back and forth during the shop drawing process since those types of questions are worked through during design.

I love David Chipperfield Architects work. Simple, tranquil, still. The kind of building you love in your city. I wanted to try build their Dairy Road scheme in Giraffe Flow. First, I tried understanding the architects thoughts about rhythm and proportion. Then I encoded it as rules in a Giraffe flow. Now, putting on a master planning hat, I stretched the building to a specific site. All I needed to draw was a single line. The computer uncomplainingly generated the apartments, the proportions and facades, and did the area calculations. It freed time for me to think like a developer, or a planner. I could change unit mix and balcony depths. Or adjust the structural grid to meet the ground whilst keeping an eye on key metrics. And - with my #BIM manager hat on - I know I can pull these apartment polygons into Speckle, and then push them into Revit. Heavy use of adaptive components and standard details and the documentation process would be quick & rigorous. A clean, logically ordered design process helping to drive a clean and logical construction process. #generativedesign\n\nHey architects, specifiers, and anyone interested in sustainability, making sustainable choices in construction doesn't always require complex solutions. Nearly 50% of all carbon emissions are from the built environment and it is important that we as industry professionals take proper action to reduce our contribution to a warming planet. Simple material decisions can significantly reduce embodied carbon of your building materials. Explore materials with lower embodied carbon, such as sustainably harvested wood or recycled steel, or carpet or paint or fireproofing. Prioritizing these options minimizes the environmental impact of the construction process. Consider using Building Transparency and their Embodied Carbon Tool to assess the carbon footprint of any building material. https://lnkd.in/gR4WaSkQ In addition, look beyond initial costs of a product and assess the entire lifecycle of materials, considering factors like durability, maintenance, and end-of-life disposal. Opting for long-lasting materials can reduce the need for frequent replacements or repairs. MONOKOTE fire protection has a proven track record in lasting for the lifespan of the building. #YieldProductionTrust #takesateam - Rick Mihevc Jennifer Vorberger Tamara Alvarez Matthew P.
