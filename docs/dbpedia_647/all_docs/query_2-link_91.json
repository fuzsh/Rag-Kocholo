It first opened its door as a Government school in 1837 under the Liberal Government of Sir Charles Metcalfe the then Lt. Governor of the North Western Provinces. In 1837 the college began with 57 pupils & Mr. Rogers was its Head master. The course of Bareilly College has never smooth & unaccountably awry & baffling it was in the initial stage when it had to battle right royally against the formidable forces of ignorance & superstition masquerading under the name of religiosity. With the passage of the time the adverse criticism died down & the college gathered & more strength, commanded the confidence & respect of the public & thus made steady progress. In 1850 it was raised to the status of Government College with Mr. Vernon Tregear (1850-53) as its first principal."
