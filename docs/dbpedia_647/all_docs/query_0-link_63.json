        "text": "Amrit Singh Rai, once a prominent Sikh activist,wassentenced to three years in a federal prison on Wednesday for robbing a bank in Surrey, B.C., last October.\n\nHis brother, Baljit Singh Rai, saidAmrit Raicommitted the crime to fuel his drug habit and now he's asking the community to forgive him.\n\nAmrit Rai was once a spokesperson for the International Sikh Youth Federation, which the federal government has listed as a terrorist group, before his descent into drugs.\n\nAmrit Rai, who was found guilty after a four-day trial in May,smiled and waved to family and friends during his sentencing hearing Wednesday in provincial court in Surrey. The 44-year-old baptized Sikh wasn't wearing a turban and his hair was cut, but his beard was long.\n\nAt the hearing, Judge Gurmail Gill sentenced Rai to three years in a federal prison for robbing a bank in Surrey last October.\n\nCourt was told Rai tried to rob the bank using a fake gun and threatening to \"blow away\" customers and staff. Rai's lawyer said Rai wanted money to pay off a drug dealer.\n\nBaljitRai said outside court thatRai was depressed due to marital problems and because he'd been called a traitor to the Sikh community. The court heard Wednesday thatRai began using drugs and eventually spent $270,000 to feed his crack cocaine habit.\n\nBaljit Rai said his brother will probably end up spending nine more months in jail, after he receives credit for time already served.\n\n\"My brother was happy so I am very happy with the sentence,\" Baljit Rai said.\"What my brother said right in the court, he is still telling all the community to forgive him. If you're a baptized Sikh, the father lord forgives you for all the sins.\"\n\nAmrit Rai told the court he plans to be rebaptized."
