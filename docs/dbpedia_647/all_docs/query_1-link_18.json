        "text": "Amrit Singh Rai's fall into the devastating world of drugs and crime occurred incredibly quickly.\n\nMr. Rai was a key organizer for blood drives and an outspoken advocate on human-rights issues in the early years of this decade. His descent into the world of crack cocaine began three or four years ago, around the same time some of his closest friends started to ostracize him over a shift in his political views and his marriage fell apart.\n\nHe slipped into a depression and then someone offered him cocaine, a family member said yesterday shortly before Mr. Rai was sentenced for robbery.\n\nMr. Rai cashed out his family savings of $230,000 and then took out a $30,000 line of credit to feed his appetite for crack cocaine, Crown counsel Winston Sayson said yesterday in Surrey Provincial Court.\n\nMr. Rai turned to crime to pay for his next fix, Mr. Sayson said in court.\n\n\"He could be a poster boy for what drugs can do to destroy a person's life,\" Mr. Sayson said later in a brief interview outside the courtroom.\n\nMr. Rai's record of drug-related crime began in 2005 with a conviction for possession of illegal drugs for the purpose of trafficking. His criminal activity escalated to breaking and entering, carrying a concealed weapon and then robbery.\n\nA drug dealer had broken Mr. Rai's arm a day before the robbery. Mr. Rai had failed to pay a debt, his lawyer, Craig Sicotte, told the court, reading from an assessment completed before the trial. Mr. Rai was \"drug-sick,\" not thinking rationally and desperate to obtain more drugs, Mr. Sicotte said.\n\nMr. Rai robbed a TD Canada Trust branch in Surrey in October, 2006. He gave a note to the teller, shouted out threats and exposed the butt of a gun tucked into his clothing. He ran out of the bank with $700 but left his fingerprints behind on the scrap of paper he had passed to a teller. He was arrested shortly afterward.\n\nYesterday, Mr. Rai, 44, was sentenced to three years in a federal prison for robbing the bank. With credit for time in custody while waiting for his trial, he will have to serve only 18 more months. He was required to provide a blood sample for a police DNA registry and was banned from having a firearm for the rest of his life. Once he is released, Mr. Rai will remain on probation for three years.\n\nHis daughter Amandeep Rai, who is in her early 20s, said outside the court she felt the sentence by Provincial Judge Gurmail Gill was \"fair.\" Hopefully, he will decide to get help for his addiction \"so he can come back home,\" Ms. Rai said.\n\nAfter he was sentenced, Mr. Rai smiled and waved at his family in the public gallery, appearing content with the ruling. His lawyer had told the court that he has expressed remorse for his crimes, accepted responsibility for what he has done and was ashamed of his behaviour.Mr. Rai is determined stay away from drugs and return to the roots of his religion and be rebaptized as a Sikh, three years after he abandoned his turban. He hopes to become a leader in the Sikh community again, Mr. Sicotte said.\n\nMr. Rai came with family members to Canada from Calcutta when he was 11 years old. He dropped out of a Calgary school in Grade 10 to help support his family. He embraced the Sikh religion and was baptized in 1984, at the age of 20. For the next 20 years, he did not drink alcohol or use illegal drugs, his brother, Baljeet Singh Rai, said outside the courtroom.\n\nDuring those years, he was known as a spokesman for the International Sikh Youth Federation, a group advocating an independent Sikh homeland called Khalistan and linked to terrorism in India. He was one of several temple members convicted of public mischief in 1999 after a fracas over whether Sikhs could use chairs and tables during a meal at a Sikh temple in Surrey.\n\nHowever, Mr. Rai parted ways with the fundamentalists in 2003, shortly after the federal government listed the ISYF as a terrorist organization in Canada. He went to India in 2003, after India took his name off a blacklist. On returning, his political friends called him a traitor and began to ostracize him, and months later, his marriage fell apart, his brother said."
