You will be acquainted with the complex circumstances in the twentieth century Indian context that shaped the role of communication among the larger population. When you read parts of an essay that grappled with the dialectic of struggle against a colonial regime, you will, with the help of the points raised in the essay, understand the case for appropriate language-use in our country.\n\nWords given in bold throughout this unit are explained in the Glossary at the end.\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\n\nLet us, at the outset, come face to face with an issue that is of prime importance concerning communication generally, and connecting members of society in a thread of unity particularly. The first relates to saying something in words that are sound patterns denoting a view about the world in which we live. We call it language and that is a part and parcel of our existence. Language is a human act in which the mind plays an active part. The study of such an act is known as linguistics, the science of language. The second that concerns uniting people, fulfils a social purpose. In it we perceive the social sense, the urge to live in a bond that will strengthen us as well as create an atmosphere of goodwill and friendship. It deals with the role that language may play in life, and how it may add richness to our existence. Thus, we know how we handle questions of culture, ideas and relationships. Let us reiterate - language is defined to gain clarity so that we understand its nature. Further, under this head, we have information\n\nLanguage Politics: Hindi, Urdu and English\n\nabout the way ideas are structured. The starting point is sound patterns which later evolve into units of impressions and ideas. Still later, when we confront problems of repetition and being stuck to certain notions, the study of language may assist us in sorting out word-entanglements. But this theoretical endeavour is pursued because we realise that it has a purpose beyond mere study. That is where society is brought in and we start looking at language from the point of view of usefulness. In this unit, we shall engage with the twin issues with respect to the use of Hindi.\n\nActivity 1\n\nIn your opinion, based on your reading of the above, how is language and its study relevant to society?\n\n1 ABOUT THE AUTHOR: AMRIT RAI\n\nAmrit Rai was a prolific Hindi novelist, a critic and a translator. He is renowned in academic circles for his definitive biography of Premchand, Qalam ka Sipahi, which won him the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1963 and later, the Soviet Land Nehru Award in 1971. He also wrote several novels such as Dhuan, Sargam, Hathi ke Dant, etc. He translated Shakespeare’s play Hamlet into Hindi, and wrote critical works such as Nai Sameeksha and Vichardhara aur Sahitya. Versatile in many languages, he also wrote one of the most significant works on the Hindi-Urdu debate in English, A House Divided: The Origin and Development of Hindi/Hindavi.\n\n1 EXCERPT: UNDERSTANDING HINDAVI\n\nBefore we move further in pursuit of these aspects and comprehend how social life involves us in the working of a language, let us take a look at the following argument that Amrit Rai presented in one of his books, A House Divided. I quote a passage from the beginning of a chapter titled “A House Divided.” This offers a comprehensive view of the issue we are discussing in this unit. The passage is as follows:\n\nA House Divided The present work proposes to be a study of the earliest origins of the language Hindi/ Hindavi, and an investigation into the causes that led to its division into two separate languages, modern Hindi and modern Urdu.\n\nSometimes, this word ‘Hindi’ is also used in a general sense, as noted by Grierson:\n\nIt is a Persian, not an Indian word and, properly signifies a native of India, as distinguished from a ‘Hindu’ or ‘non-Musalman’ Indian. ... In this sense, Bengali and Marathi are as much Hindi as the language of the Doab.\n\nHowever, at various places Khusrau (1251/54-1325) uses the word ‘Hindi’ in the specific sense of the language, and that, naturally, the language of North- Western India with which the Muslims first came in contact in the Punjab and then in Delhi. Speaking of this Hindi language Khusrau had occasion to comment:\n\nLanguage Politics: Hindi, Urdu and English\n\ninquiry into the causes that led, at some point in time, to its division into two separate languages - standard or High Hindi and standard or High Urdu as we know them today, and also as they are known in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.\n\nHowever, their recognition as two separate languages under the Constitution need not deter linguists from questioning the scientific validity of their separation. For example, Gyan Chand, a noted Urdu scholar, says:\n\nIt is absolutely clear that Urdu and Hindi are not two separate languages. To call them two languages is to belie all principles of linguistics and to deceive oneself and other.. though Urdu literature and Hindi literature are two different and independent literatures, Urdu and Hindi are not two different languages.. Urdu and Hindi as two languages in the Indian Constitution, is political expediency, not a linguistic reality.\n\nActivity 2\n\nDo you think that it is right to characterise Hinduwee or Hindavi as exclusive to Hindus?\n\n1 DISCUSSION\n\nFirst, let us summarise the passage. Initially, says Amrit Rai, the word “Hindi” denoted the country India - anybody who lived in India could be called Hindi with the same meaning that “Indian” had. Thus, a person was Hindi and a language such as Tamil or Marathi was Hindi. But, “Hindi” also denoted the Hindi language that was spoken in Northwest India. This was the case, said Amir Khusrau, to whom the language existed before the Muslim invasion occurred. The name given to the language was, however, “Hindavi” or “Hinduwee.” The two words were interchangeable. Khusrau also asserted that from the point of view of use and expression, Hindavi was the best language in the world barring Arabic. Soon after, Rai says that the Muslim invasion did little to Hindavi except putting it into a creative mode which, indeed, contributed to its growth. As such, Hindavi did not stagnate but kept its pace of evolution in the coming centuries. Later, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it entered a new phase and became Modern Hindi, or what came to be called High Hindi.\n\nWhat about Urdu? In Rai’s opinion, Modern Hindi and Modern Urdu are one language, they cannot be separated since they share the history of Hindavi with which they are vitally connected. In this sense, the two words did not do much except lead one to believe that it was not one but two languages. In this, there is a catch, says Rai. Whereas the language is one, literature written in it has gone in two directions and resulted in two distinct literatures - Hindi literature and Urdu literature. They are separate from each other and each enjoys a distinct identity.\n\nDo you see how the argument presented by Rai has become subtler? The two literatures have separate sets of words to compose states of mind and express cultural norms - these are linked with their separate identities. Also, the literatures use separate scripts, Devanagari in one case and Persian in the other. This combination of factors has come handy, suggests Rai, to those who dabble in the political arena for pursuing their limited interests, both social and cultural.\n\nUnderstanding the Nature of Language\n\nAt this juncture, a comment on the passage quoted above would be in order. This will help us, too, in laying bare the context in which Rai’s argument is located. Consider how at the outset, the word ‘Hindi’ is problematized by use of the epithet ‘modern’ to give each language a different face. Rai is aware that his argument would gain relevance if it referred to a context, that which was mentioned at the initial point. This means that modern Hindi and modern Urdu have assumed different shapes, distinguishable from each other in a long historical process. This suggestion should be borne in mind so that the discussion remains on track. Thus, principles of living are asserted as invariably exerting pressures on specific sections of society at a specific time. There is also a clear hint in the quoted passage that through reference to the roots of the two languages, we can identify the source of culture affecting communication.\n\nActivity 3 In spite of springing from a more or less common source, why is it that Hindi and Urdu literature have evolved separately?\n\nFrom this general point in the passage, we are soon taken to the next point that George Grierson (b. 1851), the famous linguist made regarding the history of the word. Grierson was a British India administrator particularly associated with the Linguistic Survey of India. Mark the expression “native of India” that has connection solely with India as a country, not with the religion Hindu or Muslim. Indeed, this is the crux. ‘Hindi’ is used in the passage as denoting India’s natives, as equivalent of Indian. As a word, it signifies that all languages used for communication in India are Hindi. Later, when reference is made to Hindi as a language, it enjoys association with Doab, the place where it is spoken. The distinction will throw a subtler light on the issue.\n\n1 KHUSRAU AND HINDAVI\n\nHow fascinating it is to note that Amrit Rai’s opinion and that of Amir Khusrau meet so well with regard to Hindi! Amrit Rai quotes Amir Khusrau to establish his point more firmly and says that Hindi or Hindavi as a language had immense power and potential to communicate.\n\nOn his part, Khusrau has used the word “expressive power” in the context of comparing the two languages - Hindi/Hindavi on the one side and Persian on the other. Khusrau is so enamoured of the capability of Hindi that he explicitly places it on a par with Persian, a classical language and, therefore, long established for its wide acceptance. Khusrau goes on to iterate that Hindi is indeed superior to Persian since it could embody with great effect the intent and force of the one who used it. Note the phrase “prince of poetry” that suggests the ability of the person who decides to express himself through poetry.\n\nThere are two things that impel Khusrau to revere the poet - the sense of beauty that resides in the poet’s heart, inspiring her/him to compose a poem and, the skills that a poet brings into play through one language in preference to another. Is it vocabulary, richness of phrases or flexibility inherent in a language that makes it worthy of praise? It appears that in the case of Hindi, Khusrau sets store by the rootedness in the actual life of a community as well as a multiplicity of dialects that a language derives its strength from. We see this argument in the\n\nUnderstanding the Nature of\n\n1 LANGUAGE, CULTURE AND POWER: THE Language\n\nCASE OF HINDAVI\n\nIt makes sense that a language taking shape through cultural ups and downs and becoming an effective means of communication finally should be adopted to preserve time-tested norms. The vocabulary it picked up from active social usage contained seeds of growth and evolution that would ensure continuation with the change-oriented past. They would also equip its new users with skills of learning and experimenting - so useful for taking society forward.\n\nYet, there are hurdles on the way. A vast country with a rich variety of ideas and attitudes is deeply conscious about identity. It would think twice before accepting policies and strategies proposed by distantly situated intellectuals. The national movement had a dynamism of its own; it was broad-based and highly sophisticated in terms of sorting out needs of the specific context. The leadership had an eye on an integrated India and they sought guidance from the desired unity of people against a common enemy. The Khari boli in its Urdu-Hindi combination had proved to be an effective tool to expand the nationalist message opposing the colonial regime. The aim indeed was political and ideological, not aesthetic.\n\nMeanwhile, writers felt bound to the medium in which they were active - writing is addictive since it makes inroads into the subconscious layers of the writer’s mind. They sought identity in the medium of expression and quite significantly, they saw a part of their self not just in word-use but also in the script. We should remember that poets, fiction writers and dramatists, while playing a role in the arena of literature, earned credit from the readers’ appreciative response. Soon, particularly in the nineteen twenties and thirties, they felt deflected from the nationalist aim and toyed with authorial prospects of success. That is why the debate about language, script and vocabulary intensified around this period. Wasn’t there also a chunk of cultural thought that was double-edged? It sought direction in religious-cultural appeal on one hand, that was divisive, and conversely looked for the answer in nationalist-secular ideals on the other. The problem is well articulated by E. Ramakrishnan in the following observation:\n\nLanguage is the site where, very often, social, cultural and political battles are fought in India. Alternatively, one may say that socio- political conflicts invariably acquire cultural and linguistic overtones, necessitating negotiations with and through languages. Some of these fault-lines that cause fissures and ruptures run deep and will have to be factored into the discussion of the shifts of our cultural terrains. (Ramakrishnan 57)\n\nHe states unequivocally that the context is India-specific. There might be, in our country, clashes, but why “social, cultural and political battles”? If post- Independence, the country aimed to establish a solid democratic base on which differences could be expressed for building consensus, why battles? The second thing rearing its head is the shift of cultural issues to social and political fields. This means that subjects such as language become a cause for socio-political tensions in society.\n\nRamakrishnan sees language as power. In the conventional understanding of the term, language is taken in the sense of a means of communication. In the twentieth century language was interpreted as an act that involved use of signs to forge\n\nLanguage Politics: Hindi, Urdu and English\n\nconcepts about the life around an individual. It became thus a means to construct knowledge. The first query then would be whether knowledge is power or a part of the social process where power is created and wielded.\n\nSeen objectively, language has economic ramifications - it is linked with specific groups getting a chunk of jobs when one or other language acquires a national character and becomes a national language. Add to this the fact that in India in the twentieth century under British rule, English had created a middle class that enjoyed power and privilege through it. The form of power manifested in influence, clout and role of language-based policies in an emerging economic scenario. Without going into the nitty-gritty of details, we might think of the upper middle class wielding enormous power in the formation of policies at the centre and in the states. Elitism was the recipe that the upper echelons in our country relished. There is no doubt that policies we are talking of left an imprint on writing and production of books for schools and colleges and for general consumption. Since all this required economic resources for profitable investment, retention and development of English appeared the best bet.\n\nActivity 5\n\nIn what way can language be seen as power?\n\nLooking at the journey covered by knowledge so far, we might assume that knowledge has given humans and societies a special capability to effect changes in the surroundings. If the face of the world has changed unrecognizably, it is because of the mental capacity of humans and language is linked firmly with knowledge. Regarding ideology, we notice that societies over the world remain active in constructing and using social thought on a big scale in a mode that works as a system of ideas, and as we have observed, it does not matter whether the system is wrong or right till it serves one or other purpose. Such a system is considered ideology, and since it is neutral to wrong or right depending on whose purpose it serves, its joining up with society’s power structure assumes dangerous implications. Language is not neutral, it is itself ideology in the practice of adoption and use in a situation. In the second unit of this block we will discuss Raghuvir Sahay’s poem ‘Hindi,’ and this issue of ideology inherent in the social working of language will be taken up. Let us say that the issue touches a multiplicity of factors in the working of an organised social structure. This is what Hindi writer Premchand said in precise terms in his controversial essay ‘Urdu, Hindi and Hindustani’:\n\nThe fact is that India’s national language can neither be Urdu that heavily draws upon Arabic and Persian words that are unfamiliar and not in common use and is burdened with them, nor Hindi that borrows the difficult vocabulary of Sanskrit. If the partisans and supporters of these two languages stand before each other and exchange views in their respective literary languages, neither group would perhaps make sense of that spoken by the other. Only that language shall qualify for becoming the national language that has the base of general comprehensibility - that which all make sense of with ease. Why would such a language bother that a certain word be dropped since it originated from Persian, Arabic or Sanskrit? The only criterion it would follow would be that of the ease with which common people will follow it. And the common people come from Hindus, Muslims, Punjabis, Maharashtrians,\n\nLanguage Politics: Hindi, Urdu\n\nand English 1 LET US SUM UP\n\nIn this unit, we examined the issue of language politics linked to Hindi and Urdu. What emerged in the discussion is that the two are so close in their origins and roots that they cannot be considered different or unconnected, to the extent that they can indeed be called inseparable. Where a language was seen as a medium that played a positive unifying role during India’s national movement, Hindi or Urdu were both in the fore-front. But the literary writing they fostered split into two parallel streams giving an identity colouring to the language they were written in. A solution could be sought in the interests of the common people for whom both language and literary writing are envisioned as domains; hence the internal characteristics of language/languages and their links with one or other classical languages could be kept out of the purview. In their place, we should consider an easy and effective linguistic medium. As such, an open and ever-evolving language denoted by the term Hindustani could be considered a viable option. Amrit Rai attempted to form a unified view of Hindi in the modern context and marshalled many arguments to put forth a perspective of utility concerning language-use. When the struggle for India’s independence from the British colonial stranglehold began in the opening years of the twentieth century, a language was needed to spread the message of equality. Indeed, it could be only that language which was spoken by a sizeable chunk of people and had an ethos of diversity and the urge to learn. Other related factors also came into consideration and contention arose mainly between Hindi and Urdu. The debate about this question was sharp in the nineteen twenties when the movement against British imperialism had intensified. Many scholars joined the debate from the opposite sides of the issue and presented opinions on various aspects ranging from society, politics to culture.\n\n1 AIDS TO ACTIVITIES\n\nActivity 1: Language also has a social purpose.\n\nActivity 2: It would be wrong to come to that conclusion as some of the greatest poets of Hindi-Hindavi were Muslims.\n\nActivity 3: The two literatures have evolved separately, with different scripts and set of words and the expression of cultural nuances.\n\nActivity 4: Hindustani is used because it has more fluid boundaries and can act as a linking language between people of various regions.\n\nActivity 5: Language is power because it has economic ramifications.\n\nActivity 6: It is an ideology because of the policies leading to the adoption and use of a particular language for a specific purpose.\n\n1 GLOSSARY\n\nDialectic : the logic that considers opposites as linked and feeding upon as well as fighting with each other.

The other poem taken up for discussion in this unit, ‘Hindi’, was written in the nineteen fifties. Separated from each other by more than seven hundred years, the two poems enjoy some common strands. The consciousness about the nature of literary writing and its role is one important thread that they share. Equally, they are self-reflexive - they use words and phrases with care. The writer of ‘Ghazal’ combines Persian, Hindi and Braj deftly in the same line and creates a rare sense of beauty. The writer of ‘Hindi’ is metaphorical to the core. In one breath, he talks of language, politics and nationalism, weaving them together subtly. It is to be iterated that poetry and other forms of literature yield appropriate meaning only when their writers are seen as repositoriesof social norms and culture and receive credit and importance for their artistic feats.\n\n2 KHUSRAU - THE MAN OF LITERATURE\n\nDear student, let us first talk in general about the poet Amir Khusrau and attempt to link him to his ghazal that is in your course. Khusrau’s ghazal carries the influence of Sufism. (You have been reading about Sufism in the previous Block). He wrote mainly in Persian and was equally conversant with the local Braj Bhasha tradition that left its mark on his poetry. For this reason, he is considered the pioneer of ‘Hindavi,’ an emerging dialect close to life on the street. He brought together the sufi strains, Persian poetic forms and dialects of the Avadh region in his works. Khusrau’s poetry deviates from the typical court poetry written in his day to please patrons and kings alike. His ghazals do not carry amplification of conventional literary forms. In fact, his poetry is intimate, carrying the simple spontaneous elements of folk poetry. Khusrau followed the Sufi tradition and wrote poetry closer to the emotions and experiences of common life.\n\nKhusrau in his ghazals takes on a feminine persona and refers to his poet friend Amir Hasan Sanjari as his lover. The present ghazal is a case in point. The poem evokes the love tradition and the emotion (‘rasa’) love-in-separation that was a part of the ancient Indian aesthetics. He says in the ghazal, “Talk to me with your eyes; dear heart, I cannot bear the sorrow of parting”. This is an essential trait of Sufi poetry written in the early medieval period where ideas of Ishq carried resonances of ardent love. This love was, however, shared between the subject and god and sometimes transferred to fellow human beings who were equal participants in the quest for mystic union. For Khusrau in the present context, the emotional bond between friends is an example of experience much like that between lovers and it may be viewed as an extension of the frenzy of divine Sufi love. Sufi poets often used secular tales of love and incorporated them in their poetry. For instance, Jalaludin Rumi (1207-73) used the epic Laila–Majnu tale to express his love for God. Madness (a concept familiar to you from your reading of the previous Block) associated with this love also finds expression here. The idea of self-annihilation known as Fanah and suffering that is dear to Sufi saints is borrowed by Amir Khusrau and is made to represent his human-centred approach. Khusrau captures the intensity of human sentiment and at the same time remains sensuous in his descriptions. Take for instance the expression – “Long as tresses the night of parting”. He gives his love a human form. The night without the lover is as dense and enveloping as a woman’s tresses. On the other hand, the “the day of love is short as life”. The poet suffers the pangs of separation and reiterates the longing to see the beloved in “If I see not my love, O friend, how can I spend dark nights of grief?” The language of the ghazal is simple. The\n\nLanguage Politics: Hindi, Urdu and English\n\nlines alternate between the Persian and the Braj as if the poet were translating his emotions from Persian to Braj and vice versa. It also projects the spontaneous flow of the poet’s feelings that are not inhibited by any one language and freely moves in and out of the two languages. Still, the two languages add different meanings to the context of the poem while maintaining its lyrical quality and adding variety of speech.\n\nActivity 1\n\nWhat do you understand by the word ‘lover’ in the context of Amir Khusrau’s poem and Sufi poetry in general?\n\n2 A READING OF KHUSRAU’S ‘GHAZAL’\n\nNow, that you have a general idea of the poet and his work, let us first read the ghazal written in Urdu by Amir Khusrau (1253-1325) that goes as follows in translation:\n\nGhazal\n\nForget me not, the sorrowful, Talk to me with your eyes; Dear heart, I cannot bear the sorrow of parting, Keep me well within your heart. Long as tresses the night of parting, The day of love is short as life, If I see not my love, O friend, How can I spend dark nights of grief? Two magic eyes with a hundred charms Have put my sad heart’s rest to flight; Now who would care to go and tell Dear love my sad and lonely plight? As a candle lit, as an atom struck No sleep in my eyes, no rest in my heart Banished, alas, from that moon’s grace He sends no news, nor shows his face. On the day of love, for truth, Khusrau The loved one tricked me and went away If I could find him, I will keep Him in my heart with love always. (translated from Urdu by Ahmed Ali) Interpretation See what the poet observes in the beginning—he becomes one with the male lover and tells the woman that she has become forgetful of late, and that there is something that engages her mind. What can it be? We are made to think that preceding this situation, the woman has lost interest in the immediate surroundings. But she at least can speak with her eyes, since in certain situations\n\nLanguage Politics: Hindi, Urdu and English\n\nof ornamentation. This was exactly the case in the original version where Khusrau used the Awadhi dialect.\n\n2 VIEWING THE POEM AS A GHAZAL\n\nHere, we look at the poem from the angle of “ghazal” as a literary form. You might be wondering as to why it is given this name. In the literal sense, the word stands for beauty and innocence enshrined in the looks and conduct of a female deer, the word for which is “ghazala.” The transparent nature of the eyes of the deer is used in literature to signify the purity of gaze of the young woman whom the amorous male desires as a companion. With such a friend by his side, the lover will give vent to his softer feelings. The relationship between the young and handsome male and his lover, will project a view of romance and longing. These are indeed the features of poetry in general. Specifically, in the case of the ghazal form, the expression will attain heights of imaginative wonder and magic. We may regard this to be the main purpose of the poet attempting a ghazal that is entirely devoted to the theme of love which is considered synonymous with beauty traditionally. If you apply this description of the ghazal form to the poem given above, you may reach the conclusion that human life attains nobility and gentleness through literature, and for this reason, poetry is used to create the aura of sensuous pursuit of beauty. Let me ask this question squarely of you: “Does one not like to talk about sweetness in a relationship?” In fact, the same is enjoyed when one watches a drama or a film. From this general point, we shall later turn to the ghazal as a poem in which feelings are depicted through word- pictures of states of mind and language use.\n\nActivity 2\n\nTry to read this poem in the original. Why do you think Khusrau would combine two or three languages or dialects while composing ‘Ghazal’?\n\n2 IMPLICATIONS OF TRANSLATION\n\nWhile engaging with this poem, we are conscious that it is a translation from the original Urdu into English. We have also to remind ourselves that the English translator aims to adhere to an already existing expression. It is not expected that a translator will take liberties with the depiction and edit or change the original composition to create an effect. Let me say that this is precisely the difficulty with this ghazal. In its translated form, the poem does not let us know, for instance, that the writer Amir Khusrau made use of three languages in each line—Persian, Urdu, and Awadhi. That was an artistic feat, a miracle. We do not see that in the translation and read the text as an articulation of a lover’s emotions by the poet in the chaste medium of English. I draw your attention to this fact of anomaly between the original text and its translated version. For me, this might serve the purpose of focusing upon language in literary expression. Amir Khusrau blended the three languages to forge an imaginative response guided entirely by requirements of a beautiful representation.\n\nNevertheless, we might pick up certain words from this poem to realise that the poet is intent upon telling us particularly about the subtle emotion of love, and the woman pining for union with her lover who has gone away from her. Thus,\n\n‘Ghazal’ by Amir Khusrau and ‘Hindi’ by Raghuvir Sahay\n\nwe have three persons involved in the situation that is at the centre of this poem— the poet, the woman and the figure of the man in the background. It is against this backdrop, that we must read this poem by Amir Khusrau.\n\n2 GHAZAL AS AN ART FORM AND ITS\n\nINTERACTION WITH SOCIETY\n\nMost of what we have said about Khusrau’s ghazal so far is from the point of view of form. Under such a view, we have considered aspects of composition, linguistic use, voice of the lover, emotions of a woman in a situation of distance from her lover-husband and the overall beauty of poetry in the hands of a master composer of the ghazal. Let us also consider the question of social and cultural surroundings in which literature operates and performs a specific function. For instance, Khusrau lived at a time when society was in a state of turmoil, mainly at the political level. Conditions in India were such that no single approach as that of the governing authority would be accepted as final. There would be voices in India in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that laid stress on originality and freedom and take to ways of enjoyment and self-indulgence. Let us bear in mind that freedom of this sort available to the artist and thinker reflects peculiar facets of social living.\n\n2.7 Creativity - The Primary Motive\n\nPeople become creative and approach their horizons differently than those that were visualized by their predecessors. We might call it an act of courage, but it also takes us towards challenges that are hidden from the common eye. Apart from being an act of courage, the creative endeavour in the time of Khusrau also pointed towards the penchant for learning. The early medieval India had social sections that mixed with unknown and lesser known people with a sense of curiosity and pleasure. No section or group of people was seen as a threat and challenge. Even as there would be competition in trade, workplace and neighbourhood living, people welcomed novelty of thought. Ghazal as an art form could serve to reveal the urge to change one’s way of expressing oneself. Otherwise strictly hierarchical, the society of the time left the common masses in the lower rungs to fend for themselves and be what they wished to be. Among people of the upper strata, too, there would be a vision of beauty that crossed boundaries of accepted standards. The present ghazal offers a pretty picture of coexistence of languages struggling to forge ahead of others in effect and appeal.\n\n2.7 Celebrating Union with the Lover\n\nAs we have noticed, the present ghazal is not merely about a lonely woman thinking of her lover, but also about a common urge to celebrate union with a lover. The physicality of this ghazal brings forth in clear terms the honest emotion of bonding that is lyrical and sensuous. Khusrau, the man from the upper echelons derives a great deal of pleasure from visualizing words and phrases and the element of senses embedded in them to join in mutuality with the lower sections of people in his own time. There is no doubt that the early medieval India was a place where people met one another on equal terms at the level of imagination. It is noteworthy that the ghazal under discussion is a means of high entertainment at a time when India was opening up to the world beyond its boundaries in productive and exchange areas as also in regions of culture and art."
