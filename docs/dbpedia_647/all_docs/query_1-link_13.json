This page houses many of the stories I've written for the program over the last year or so. More are on the way... #writing #technology #communications #marketing\n\nIt was an incredible webinar well-organized and well-presented by the CyberWarFare Labs where I learned a lot from this session regarding Lateral Movement, Diamon Ticket, Prerequisites for getting certified in CELMS, and many more. Thanks a lot, CyberWarFare Labs Team for your great effort. #CyberWarFareLabs #EthicalHacking #HappyHacking #LateralMovement #DiamondTicketing\n\nThink NFTs are just a passing trend? Chris Dixon might change your mind. NFTs aren't just digital bragging rights. Dixon's latest clip highlights their use in everything from wedding certificates to video games. Artists, musicians, and gamers are also gaining access to new revenue streams thanks to NFTs. It's about making sure creators get their fair share, directly and securely. Imagine getting paid every time your digital creation changes hands. That's the power of NFTs. ðŸ¤” Skeptical? That's fair. But the implications are too big to ignore. NFTs are not just reshaping the art world; they're redefining digital value and ownership. ðŸ¤” Do you believe NFTs offer real value or is it all speculative hype? #blockchain / #NFTs / #Web3 / #innovation ðŸ¤” Enjoyed this post? ðŸ’¬ Reshare or leave a comment ðŸ”” Hit the bell + follow Pete Madigan\n\nAre you going to TCEA?

And #PTCL #FlashFiber reigns supreme on that particular parameter, here is our campaign using the two premiere fast bowlers strenghtening our claim. An absolute essential for your everyday and Worldcup viewing experience. #PTCLGROUP\n\nDuring this year's State of Unreal at GDC, we showed the Talisman project on stage, which is a great demo of how creators can use MetaHuman to bring high-fidelity digital humans to UEFN. Stage demo link: https://lnkd.in/gjsRtbz5 Documentation link: https://lnkd.in/gJgNDx2t âš¾ Some insider baseball: There's more documentation being written for the template that was talked about in the stage demo. And the template doc will accompany the great overview that the team wrote. So keep your eye on the ball and bookmark the MetaHuman Overview in UEFN doc because when the template doc goes live, it'll cover the workflows being used by the team to ship the template."
