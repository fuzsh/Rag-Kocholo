        "meta_description": "German postcard. Photo: Heinrich Haas, Hamburg.\n\t\n\tAustrian-born stage and film actor and theatre director <b>Fritz Kortner</b> (1892-1970) was one of the best-known character actors of German silent cinema. His speciality was playing sinister and threatening roles.\n\t\n\tFritz Kortner was born Fritz Nathan Kohn in Vienna in 1892. He studied at the Vienna Academy of Music and Dramatic Art 9an academy at the Burgtheater). After graduating, he received his first engagement at the National Theatre Mannheim. In 1911,  he joined the Max Reinhardt at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin. There he played only minor roles, but soon he moved again. These were wandering years for the actor, hopping from stage to stage. At the outbreak of the First World War, he was called up for military service. However, he was soon written off as unfit for the front.  In 1915 he made his first appearance in a silent film. He played in a series of adventure films directed and produced by Harry Piel, including Manya, die Türkin/Manya, and The Turkish Woman (Harry Piel, 1915). During the war, he also appeared in such films as Der Märtyrer seines/The Martyr of his heart (Emil Justitz, 1918) as Ludwig von Beethoven, Der Sonnwendhof/The Sonnwendhof (Emil Leyde, 1918) and Frauenehre/Honour of a woman (Georg Kundert, 1918), in which his expressionistic acting style first came into its own. On stage, his roles became more important, and in 1919 he had his breakthrough with his performance in the play Die Wandlung (the conversion) by Ernst Toller in Die Tribüne in Berlin. Then director Leopold Jessner committed him for the Staatstheater and made him one of his principal actors. Kortner appeared in many plays by Schiller, Büchner, and Shakespeare under the direction of Jessner. His Shylock in The Merchant of Venice became his most famous role. It made him one of the great theatrical stars of Germany in the 1920s, with a new form of theater: expressionism. His specialty was playing sinister and threatening roles. He intensified his film activities. In the cinema, Kortner also excelled in expressionist works with his demonically subtle acting, such as in Satanas/Satan (F.W. Murnau, 1920) opposite Ernst Hoffmann, Die Nacht der Königin Isabeau/The Night of Queen Isabeau (Robert Wiene, 1920) starring Fern Andra, and the thriller Schatten/Warning Shadows (Arthur Robison, 1923) with Alexander Granach. Another early classic was the drama Hintertreppe/Backstairs (Leopold Jessner, Paul Leni, 1921) in which he played a crippled mailman in love with a maid (Henny Porten) who lives in the same building. In 1924, Kortner married the actress Johanna Hofer, and they stayed together till his death. That year he played the role of the villain in the Austrian silent horror classic Orlacs Hände/Orlac’s hands (Robert Wiene, 1924) opposite Conrad Veidt. He proved his versatility with completely different parts in two other classics, as Dr. Ludwig Schön in Die Büchse der Pandora/Pandora’s Box (Georg Wilhelm Pabst, 1929) featuring Louise Brooks, and the title role in the early sound film Dreyfus/The Dreyfus Case (Richard Oswald, 1930) with Heinrich George.\n\t\n\tDuring the turbulent times in the early 1930s, the Jewish Fritz Kortner decided to install his residence in Ascona. In 1932 he was attacked in the Nazi propaganda sheet Der Angriff (The Attack): &quot;One had chosen for the role in Gott, Kaiser und Bauer (God, Emperor, and Farmer, 1932) the Jew Kortner-Kohn, who actually should have stopped playing in the Berlin theater scene long ago. He is pretty much the worst and grubbiest type who has ever been on a German stage.” When Adolph Hitler came to power in 1933, Kortner, was on a tour through Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. He decided not to return to Germany. Over Czechoslovakia, then to Vienna - where he performed at Max Reinhardt’s Theater in der Josefstadt – to Paris, the Kortner family emigrated to Great Britain, where Fritz Kortner could appear in films again. Among his British films are Chu Chin Chow (Walter Forde, 1934) with Anna May Wong, and Abdul the Damned (Karl Grune, 1935) with Nils Asther. In 1937, he emigrated to the United States, where he found work as a character actor and theatre director. In 1938 followed his family, and they moved on to Hollywood. Here he worked on scripts. Until his return to Europe in 1947 he starred in nine films such as The Hitler Gang (John Farrow, 1944). However, they were not convincing artistically. After his return to Germany, he became noted for his innovative staging and direction. His artistic homes were the Münchener Kammerspiele under Hans Schweikart and the Schillertheater in Berlin under Boleslaw Barlog. A classic became his direction of Richard III (1964) in which the king crawls over piles of corpses at the end. At the Kammerspiele, he directed seventeen plays until 1967. He also appeared in some interesting films, such as Der Ruf/The Last Illusion (Josef von Báky, 1949) with Johanna Hofer, and the suspenseful drama-thriller Epilog: Das Geheimnis der Orplid/Epilogue (Helmut Käutner, 1950). In the 1960s, Kortner started to direct at the Burgtheater in his native Vienna. He directed his last play, Emilia Galotti with Klaus Maria Brandauer, in April 1970, three months before his death at the Viennese Theater in der Josefstadt. Fritz Kortner died of cancer in Munich, aged 78. Kortner’s style of interpretation and rehearsal influenced a new generation of directors. Particularly noteworthy are Peter Stein and Jürgen Flimm, who both have been assistant directors of Kortner.\n\t\n\tSources: Wikipedia (English and German) and IMDb.\n\t\n\t<b>And, please check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.</b>",
