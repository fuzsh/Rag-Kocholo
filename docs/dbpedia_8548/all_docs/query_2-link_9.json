He wrote over 20 film scripts, the first of which was Das kleine Hofkonzert in 1935, an operetta with music by Edmund Nick based on a comedy by Verhoeven and Toni Impekoven.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1948 he was artistic director at the Residenz Theatre/Staatsschauspiel in Munich.\n\nVerhoeven was married to the actress Doris Kiesow, with whom he had three children: Lis Verhoeven, who became an actress and was the first wife of Mario Adorf; Michael Verhoeven, who became a film director and married Senta Berger; and Monika Verhoeven.\n\nFrom his relationship with the actress Edith Schultze-Westrum, he had a son, Thomas Schultze-Westrum, who became a zoologist and maker of animal documentaries.\n\nPaul Verhoeven died on stage of a heart attack[1] in 1975 while delivering the eulogy for the recently deceased actress Therese Giehse at the Munich Kammerspiele. He was buried in the Munich Waldfriedhof next to his wife."
