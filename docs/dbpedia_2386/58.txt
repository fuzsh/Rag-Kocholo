Head of Hypnos. Roman bronze after Hellenistic original. Found at Civitella d'Arno (near Perugia, Italy). Quoted by Fernand Khnopff in his late 19th century painting. Hypnos' wings allowed him to move swiftly over land and sea, and to fan the foreheads of the weary until they fell asleep. His son was Morpheus, the personification of dreams.
