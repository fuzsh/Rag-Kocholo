Exclusive to the British Museum, a replica of the head of the ancient Greek god of sleep, Hypnos.

This magnificent replica is cast and hand-finished in the UK from resin, using a mould taken from the original bronze winged head, which is now housed in the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities in the British Museum.

The original Roman bronze is a copy of a complete ancient Greek marble statue which dates to the 4th century BC. Hypnos was the son of Nyx and Erebus, and the twin of Thanatos. He was a deity who personified sleep, and lived in the underworld Hades.

A wonderful home ornament for lovers of classical sculpture and mythology.
