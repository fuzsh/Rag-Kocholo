Enghsh travellers nearly always play at follow the leader, and there are probably not two hundred hving who have ever closely explored the scenery of the Abruzzi, the characteristic cathedrals of Apuha, or the historic sites of Magna Graecia. Except the admirable Unter- Italien of Gsell -fells. The Abruzzi by Abbate, the Grande Grice of Fran9ois Lenormant, the chapters on the Abruzzi, Apulia, and Naples, in the Italian Sculptors of C. C. Perkins, and in the Storia dell' Arte of A. Venturi, little of other than scientific or archaeological importance has been written about these places. It has not been considered worth while; and even the beautiful illustrations in Lear's Journal of a Landscape Painter and the cult of Garibaldi have failed to attract a stream of travellers as far south as Calabria. The vastness and sometimes ugUness of the districts to be traversed, the bareness and filth of the inns, the roughness of the natives, the torment of zanzare, the terror of earthquakes, the inseciirity of the roads, and the far more serious risk of malaria or of typhoid from the bad water, are natural causes which have hitherto kept strangers away from the south. But every year these risks are being lessened, and som.e of the travellers along the southern railways to Sicily may well be induced to hnger on the way, though, with the exception of the rebuilt hotel at Reggio, the inns in Calabria are still such as none but hardy tourists may care to encounter, and the lower sites are seldom free from fever. There is not, however, the same reason for hurr>'ing through Apulia, which is generally healthy, and where the more rapid improvement of the inns permits archaeologists to explore certain of its wonderful old cities with some comfort. Owing to rail and motor, everj' year the splendid land between Rome and Naples is becoming far better known. All the places near the Eternal City have been aheady fuUy described in Days near Rome, and the Italy of artists is to be found more amongst these moimtain districts than in any other part of the peninsula. Here the costumes still glow with colour, and xxii INTRODUCTION the wonderful picturesqueness of the towns is only equalled by the exquisite beauty and variety of the scenery. The way in which the national character alters, as Naples is approached, may seem incredible to those who have not lived in Italy. Within fifty miles of Rome, where the people have not been demoralised by travellers and their luxuries (as at AlbanoJ, cases of extortion or incivility are almost unknown, and the peasants are honest, fairly contented, and industrious. Some of the truest of gentlemen in Italy are the Campanian shepherds. But after crossing the Pontine marshes or passing the Garighano into the former kingdom of Naples, the characteristics of the people are utterly changed, and all friendly confidence on the part of strangers (except, perhaps, in the islands of Capri and Ischia) would be misplaced. The degree to which a Neapolitan of the lower orders can cheat is only equalled by the degree to which he is in the habit of lying ; while the ignorance of the people, and the extravagance of their superstitions, is such as can only be realised by long familiarity. The misgovernment of the Spanish viceroys and afterwards of the Bourbon princes accounts for much. There is possibly regret in Tuscany for the Grand Dukes : there are still some living who would restore the sovereignty of the Popes ; but, with the exception of a few members of the rather extensive nobility, there is no Italian who would wish to bring back the Bourbons to Naples. Since 1880, the old Neapolitan States have derived great advantage from the opening out of the country by railways, and in being freed from the thraldom of an ignorant and self-interested priesthood. But grinding misery and povertj' are caused by the severe taxation, which absorbs nearly half the income of real property, while the corruption of the police and misprision of justice are still deplorable. In 188 1, the Italian Minister of the Interior, Signor De Pretis, was com- pelled to issue a circular to all the prefects of the kingdom, calling their attention to the extraordinary number of arrests made by the police and not followed by a conviction, proving thereby that, on the average, 660 innocent persons were daily imprisoned through caprice, abuse, or paltry pretext. In 1910 things are of course better : but they are by no means perfect* Few words deserve more consideration from modern Italians than those of Massimo d'Azeglio, when, during the first exultation which prevailed in the meeting of the Italian Parliament at Turin in i860, he exclaimed — \" L' Italia e fatta, ma chi far4 ora gl' Italiani.\" In 191 1 the noble Province of Basilicata suffers severely from over-emigration. The effectual men depart ; the agriculture devolves upon the women : education is neglected ; and consequently juvenile crime flourishes on an extraordinary scale. , With the exception of a few highly-favoured spots, the beauties of scenery in the old Neapolitan States on the mainland are confined to the neighbourhood of the capital, and this, with INTRODUCTION xxiii the liveliness and originalit\\' of its inhabitants, will compensate the passing traveller for the disadvantages by which a resi- dent in Naples is apt to be depressed. The spirit of fun which possesses Neapolitans is irresistible. To enjoy while you can is the apparent ciim of every hour of Ufe — to laugh at Pulcinella and Bailardo, to dance the tarantella, to listen to improvisatore. or to bagpipers — the utricularii of ancient days : these to NeapoUtans are like duties. Prolonged gravity to them is impossible. They will be convulsed with laughter while they tell you they are starving, and the slightest joke will drive them from the excess of grief or anger into peals of merriment. Swin- burne narrates how some malefactors, left all night upon a gibbet, were characteristically found the next morning with hats and long periwigs on their heads, and pipes of tobacco in their mouths : and how, on the feast of a patron of a church, a paste- board PoUchinello was exhibited on the front of the edifice administering a clyster to Scaramouche (Scaramuccia), and at a given signal the instrument took fire, and both apothecary and patient blew up in a volley of crackers. \" Le peuple napolitain, 4 quelques ^gards, n'est point dn toot dvilis^ ; mais il n'est point vulgaire a la maniere des autres peuples. Sa grossieret6 meme frappe I'imagination. La rive africaine qui borde la mer de 1 'autre cote se fait presque deja seatir, et il y a je ne sais quoi de Numidie dans les cris sauvages qu'on entend de toates parts. Oes visages bninis, ces vetements formes de quelques morcaux d'etoSe rouge ou violette, dont la couleur foncee attire les regards ; ces la.~beau d'habillements, que ce peuple artiste drape encore avec art, donnent quelque chose de pittoresque a la populace, tandis qu'aiUeurs Ton ne peut voir en eUe que les miseres de la civilisation. Un certain gout pour la parure et les decorations se trouve souvent k Naples, a cote du manque absolu des cfaoses necessaires ou commodes. Les boutiques sont omees agreablement avec des fieurs et des fruits. Quelques-unes ont un air de f£te qui ne tient ni a I'abondance, ni 4 la felicite publique, mais seulement k la vivacite de I'imagination ; on veut rejouir les yeux avant tout. La douceur du dimat permet aux ou\\Tiers, en tout genre, de travailler dans la rue. Les tailleurs y font des habits, les traiteurs leurs repas ; et les occupations de la maison, se passant ainsi au dehors, multiplient le mouvement de mille m«uiieres. Les chants, les danses des jeux bruyants accompagnent assez bien tout ce spectacle ; et il n'y a point de pa^-s oH Ton sent plus clairement la diSerence de I'amusement au bonheur ; enfin. Ton sort de I'intdrieur de la ville pour arriver sur les quais, d'oil Ton voit et la mer et la Vesuve, et Ton oublie ak>FS tout ce que Ton sait des bommes.\" — Madeatu de Sttu-l, Corinne. The grossest brutahty to animads used to be a Neaf>ohtan characteristic, and \"Ma non sono cristiani \" — \"But they are not Christians\" — was the universal ans^ver to any remonstrance. For this the priest was chiefly responsible. Yet it must in justice be noticed that Naples has improved in this very matter more rapidly of late than has any other town in all Italy. The NeapoU- tans have outshone the Romans altogether in humanity, and they deserve exceptional praise for it. A passion for gambhng is universal, and is encouraged by all the popular games, especially by that of morra : and a behef in witchcraft (especially that kind called la magta bianca, or Intimate intercourse with spirits) is shown by the eagerness with which their advice is sought as to taking tickets in^the xxiv INTRODUCTION Government lottery. In this, an ambo, or two prize numbers, gives the fortunate speculator twenty times his money ; a terno, or three prize numbers, a hundred times his investment ; while a cinquina, or all the five prize numbers, is considered to make his fortune. The lottery, and which numbers seem likely to turn out lucky, is the most serious occupation of the NeapoUtan intellect. \" C'est le peuple du monde qui aime le plus I'argent. : si vous demandez & un homme du peuple votre chemin dans la rue, il tend la main apres avoir fait un signe : car ils sont plus paresseux pour les paroles que pour les gestes, mais leur goftt pour I'argent n'est point methodique ni reflechi ; ils le depensent aussitot qu'ils le refoi- vent. Si I'argent s'introduisait chez les sauvages, les sauvages le demanderaient comme cela.\" — Madame de Stael, Corinne. The conversation of Neapolitans is more than half made up of gestures ; it is amusing, and it saves trouble. \" Here are a few of the commonest signs. An outward wave of the hand, Adieu ; an inward, Come ; a downward, Stop. The thumb pointed backwards, Look ; to the lips, with a slight toss of the head, drinking ; passed across the forehead as though wiping away the perspiration, fatigue. The index finger drawn across the mouth, anger ; across the clenched teeth, defiance ; rapping the closed fingers against the lips, eating ; passing the extended index and thumb in front of the mouth, hunger ; twisting the end of the moustache, isn't it good to eat ? a backward wave of the hand beneath the chin and a simultaneous toss of the head — not at any price, no, nothing ; closing the fingers consecutively with a drawing motion of the hand — thievery ; thumb and forefinger rubbed together, money, as with us ; a prolonged shrug of the shoulders and both arms drawn back, gesture deprecatory ; the open fingers of both hands crossed in front of the face to represent bars, prison ; and so on ad infinitum.\" — Stamer, Dolce Napoli. The exuberance of Neapolitan gesture comes to its climax in the popular dance of the tarantella. \" The tarantella is a choreographic love-story, the two dancers representing an enamoured swain and his mistress. It is the old theme — ' the quarrels of lovers are the renewal of love.' Enraptured gaze, coy side-look ; gallant advance, timid retrocession ; impassioned declaration, supercilious rejection ; piteous supplication, softening hesitation ; worldly goods' oblation, gracious acceptation ; frantic jubila- tion, maidenly resignation. Petting, wooing, billing, cooing. Jealous accusation, sharp recrimination ; manly expostulation, shrewish aggravation ; angry threat, summary dismissal. Fuming on one side, pouting on the other. Reaction, approxi- mation, explanation, exoneration, reconciliation, osculation, winding up with a grand pas de circonstance, expressive of confidence re-established and joy unbounded.\" — Stamer. The sights of Naples may be easily visited from Pozzuoli or Castellamare. Besides those at these places, tolerable inns may be found at S. Germano, Caserta, Capri, and Salerno ; while at Sorrento, Ischia, La Cava, and Amalfi, the hotels are excellent. A summer may be spent delightfully at Ischia, Capri, or Sorrento, and no one has a real knowledge of what Italy can be who has not enjoyed the open-air life of these lovely places — the flowers, the fire-flies, the bathing, and, above all, the nights, of which Chateaubriand said, \" Ce ne sont pas des t6nebres, mais seulement I'absence du jour.\" On the eastern coast the only tolerable centres for excursions are to be found at Foggia, Barletta, Trani, Bari, and Brindisi ; while, on the west, mere comfort may be said to cease altogether INTRODUCTION xxv at Salerno. Thencefonvards, the trains crawl Sicily-ward, through the ugly but sometimes very grand country, and loiter, without the shghtest apparent object, at small wayside stations, to which the ragged, cursing, begging population is freely admitted. Luggage is often robbed in the transit, and the traveller will obtain no assistance in discovering his plunderer. Porters are rare, and, where they exist, are violent, and greedy. The dihgences are indescribably wretched, and sway like a boat in a rough sea over the half-formed roads. Carriages are difficult to procure, and bullock-carts are the usual means of transit. The inns are miserable, and sometimes are swarming with insects ; the beds are damp : the food is scanty, and except at Bari, Reggio and Cosenza, sanitary arrangements are unknown. No words descriptive of wretchedness can portray the utter degradation of the peasantry in these southern provinces, or the way in which large famihes are huddled together, with their pigs and fowls, eternally unwashed, and covered with vermin, to which in time they become impervious, Uke the beasts them- selves, iluch of this misery is due to the immense size of the great farms (latifundia), which are worked in gangs under an overseer, and to the absenteeism of the landlords, for the villeg- giatura of the noble Neapohtan famihes is hke the vie de Catn- pagne under Louis XV. ; they merely leave the town to have change of air, and to enjoy the dissipations of a smaller and more intimate society, and they trouble themselves but Uttle about their dependants. Their vast domains are managed by fattori or rented by mercanti di campagna, the sole intermediaries between the proprietors and the peasantry, of whom they used to be as much the cruel oppressors as were the slave-owners in South America. If you ask a Calabrian peasant, e%en a peasant proprietor, what he gains, the usual answer which comes from his hps is \"Si campa,\" \" One exists.\" * But he now has a refuge; even in America. The artist who travels in Calabria should be provided with letters of introduction from Naples to the agents for some of the great houses. In the country places nothing eatable can be obtained, except bread, eggs, and ri^otte, giuncaie, provelle, mazzarelle, and other preparations from milk, generally sheep's milk, or, as a treat, occasional goat's flesh, cooked with garhc and rosemary. There is comparatively little danger from brigands anywhere in Italy now, but there is a general transmitted feeling of insecurity in the south, and it is still the custom in Calabria for lonely country houses to be prepared for a state of siege, while no Italian gentleman ventures to go out unarmed and unattended, and, on returning to his country villa, is always met at the railway station by armed servants, with horses which fail not to have pistols on their holsters. It is not a great many years since the cracking of whips was forbidden on the road from Rome to Naples, because it served as a call to brigands, and the • 5««.Valer>-,_Bk. xiij. xxvi INTRODUCTION Neapolitan peasantry still regard brigandage as by no means dishonourable : it was rather an attraction by which a young fellow secured the favour of his love, and brigands were always poveretti, to be pitied and sympathised with. Witness the exaggerated sentiment of hero-worship evinced in the trial of Musolino in 1902. A pedestrian foreigner is still apt to feel, especially in Calabria, as if every man's hand was against him, and, if he travels in desolate places, entertains (though needlessly) still as much dread of a stealthy pistol or stiletto, as of the fury of the sheep-dogs, from whom the fate of Actaeon seems constantly impending. It does not do to run from these latter : the sight of a man picking up a stone is usually sufficient to keep them at bay. It is illustrative of the way in which the southern (or agricul- tural) provinces have always lagged behind the rest of Italy, that, even in Naples itself, the use of glass only became common in 1740, about the same time that the popular Father Rocco first succeeded in getting the streets lighted after a certain fashion, by turning the devotion of the people to account, and persuading them to keep innumerable lamps before images of the saints in the public thoroughfares. In Southern Italy all other religion is lost in the worship of the Madonna, but if the Calabrese do not get what they want, they will punish their Madonna by shutting her up in her shrine as if she were in prison ; they will deprive her of their accustomed offerings ; and tliey will expostulate with her as with a living person, or as Caligula did with Jupiter Capitohnus. As \" divina mater,\" the Madonna occupies the place once filled by Cybele, yet \" Madonnaccia fritta \" is only one of many undescribable terms of contempt and fury which it is common to hurl at a Madonna who is supposed to have misbehaved herself. The popular saints — Antonio, Nicola, Agata, or Rosaha — are also alternately extolled or reviled, adored or cursed, by the faithful, as if they belonged to the domestic circle, and in proportion as they are supposed to exert themselves for the benefit of their admirers. These familiarities are seen at their full height on the festival of S. Gennaro, when the people fill the cathedral of Naples with groans at their favourite saint, and call him every abominable name they can think of if his blood delays to liquefy, but implore his forgiveness with tears, and shower the most endearing appellations upon him when the annual \" miracle \" is at length accomphshed . \" Viva la Divina Providenza ' ' — ' ' Long life to the Divine Providence\" — is the familiar sign of many pubUc-houses in Sicily. In the lower orders, people usually keep a regular account with heaven, by way of calculating how long their residence in purgatory is likely to be. \" Domeniddio non paga lo Sabbato \" is a popular proverb indicating the belief that God lays up the amount of sin with interest. Very primitive are the habits of domestic life in the South, where almost everything is conducted in public or in the open air. It is a common thing for a Calabrian woman, far advanced INTRODUCTION xxvii in pregnancy, to go up to the forest for fuel, and to be there surprised by the pains of childbirth, perhaps hastened by toil. She is nowise dismayed at the sohtude around her, or the distance from home, but, as in some of the Caucasian tribes, deUvers herself of her infant, which she folds up in her apron, and, after a little rest, carries back to her cottage. It is a proverb much in use, \" Che una serva Calabrese piu ama far un figho che un bucato \" ; i.e., \"A Calabrian maid-servant prefers the labour of childbirth to that of a wash.\" The desire for male children is universal. WTien a Neapolitan woman sneezes, all the bystanders wish her \" figlii maschi \" — sons. But if the wife of a small peasant proprietor gives birth to a daughter, it is the custom to plant at once a row of poplar- trees, which will be ready to cut down and produce her dowry seventeen years after. It is funny to see NeapoUtan children cry ; they always go to the wall for it — to their \" waihng-place \" — perhaps, a relic of Saracenic rule. The old customs and even the old proverbs have been dying out rapidly in Naples, together with the old religion, and the old streets, since the change of government ; but the classical student will be interested to find how many customs and superstitions, which are mentioned by the Latin authors, still continue to survive. The few Church festas permitted are not what they used to be, and chiefly consist in days spent in idleness and firing of miniature cannon. But Neapohtans, who love eating more than any other people, never forget that each festival has its appropriate dainty. As carpe diem is always the fashion, they will sell even their clothes ajid beds to buy the orthodox feast at Christmas, and they make susanielli and striiffoli of flour, oil, and honey, such as the Romans offered to Janus, and eat \" the cake of S. Martino,\" because to that saint they pray for abundance. During the Carnival (from came vale — farewell to flesh), all the extravagances of the national character are seen in fullest excess, throwing into greater solemnity Holy Week, when there is a general impression that no one ought to enjoy themselves at all, especially on Good Friday. Under the Bour- bons, no horse or carriage whatever was allowed in the streets of Naples from 12 on Holy Thursday to 10 a.m. on the follow- ing Saturday — a great annoyance to arriving travellers. But, in the Neapolitan States, a certain solemnity used actually to pervade every Friday — \" Allegrezza di venerdi, pianto di domenica,\" was a well-known proverb. At Easter, all servants give colnri — painted eggs — to their masters. At La Majuna (May i) doors and windows are decorated with green boughs, arboscelli di maggio, or garlands, banderuole, of flowers. On S. Luca (October 18) it is an absolute necessity to eat coccia — wheat boiled with chestnuts and milk. The popular dishes themselves are still often those of classical times. Sausages — lucanicae (from Lucania) — are still manufactured in the way Apicius describes, and are served with a garnish of maccaroni — xxviii INTRODUCTION \" Filia Picenae venio Lucanica porcae Pultibus hinc niveis grata corona datur.\" Martial, Ep. xiii. 35. The small figs introduced by L. Vitellius, uncle of the emperor, are still dried in the old fashion, and called cottate. \"In ficorum genere caricas, et minores ejus generis, quae cottaaa vocant.\" — Pliny, xiii. 10. Of South Italian superstitions the most prominent is that of the Jettatura, or Evil Eye, which has been handed down from classical times. Thus Virgil says : \" Nescio quis teneros oculus mihi fascinat agnos \" ; Eclog. iii. 103. while Sannazzaro, in the fifteenth century, writes : \" L'invidia, figliulo mio, se stessa macera, E si dilegua come agnel per fascine.\" A number of antidotes are in requisition against the Jettatura. Children wear bits of rock-salt round their necks, and women a httle silver frog, with the same intention. Some burn incense mixed with the palms blessed at Easter ; the use of the palm in averting danger being mentioned by Pliny. But the most popular antidote is a little coral hand with one finger stretched out — the hand of S. Gennaro — with which the shops of Naples abound. These charms are especially in request whenever Vesuvius is in a state of eruption. If the case is alarming, half the population may be seen kneeling in the streets ; processions of clergy and monks carry the Blessed Sacrament, or even the relics of S. Gennaro himself, to the scene of danger ; the air resounds with litanies ; never was there a people in such an agonised state of repentance for their sins, but immediately the danger is over, all are laughing, singing, dancing, quarrelling, gambling, cursing, fighting, as before, or, further, are rushing to the lotteries in order to secure lucky numbers. \" During a late eruption of Vesuvius, the people took oflence at the new theatre being more attended than the churches, and assembled in great numbers to drive the nobility from the opera ; they snatched the flambeaux from the footmen, and were proceeding tumultuously to the cathedral to fetch the head of S. Gennaro and oppose its miraculous influence to the threats of the blazing volcano ; this would undoubtedly have ended in a very serious sedition if Father Rocco had not slept forth, and, after reproaching them bitterly with the affront they were about to put upon the saint by attending his relics with torches taken from mercenary hands, ordered them all to go home and provide themselves with wax tapers ; the crowd dispersed, and proper measures were taken to prevent its gathering again.\" — Swin- burne's Travels. The treatment of the dead shows the character of this idolatrous and self-seeking people in its saddest aspect. When the funeral of a friend passes, a Neapolitan will exclaim with characteristic selfishness, \"Salute a noi \" — \"Health to ourselves\" — without thought of the departed. Most of the middle classes belong, as in ancient times, to a congregazione or buricd-club. Amongst the poor, when any member of a family has expired, it is the custom for the oldest person present to recapitulate the virtues of the dead. Then, if there is a widow, she repeats the words. INTRODUCTION ' xxix adding her own comments, howling and tearing out handfuls of her hair, which she strews upon the bier. She alone is allowed the pri\\-ilege of vocal demonstration ; the sisters and daughters also tear their hair and beat their breasts, but they must do so in silence. All the duties of the family, however, end at the house, and heccamorti , or hired mourners, carry the corpse to the \" pauper pits \" of the Campo Santo Vecchio, to be hurled into the common \" grave of the day \" : sometimes it is accom- panied by a number of old women, paid to howl as mourners — the praeficae of the ancients. \" In funeral ceremonies, it is usual to hire clergymen called Fratanzari, who, having no patrimony, earn as much by their fees on these occasions as pays for their ordination ; but it is very common for them to dress up the vagabonds of the streets in their clothes and send them to sing and pray in their stead ; these fellows are always attended by a friend who holds a paper bag, into which they make the tapers waste as much as possible. .At the burial of an Archbishop of Naples four hundred friars attended with wax lights, but some thieves let loose a mad ox among them and in the confusion ran away with the candles. At another great fimeral a gang of rogues disguised themselves like clerks and sacristans, and demanded from each assistant his tapers, which they extinguished, and carried oS with the utmost^ hypo- critical composure.\" — Swmbunu's Travels, 1785. In passing through the agricultural districts of the Neapohtan pro\\-inces, the traveller will be perpetually reminded of the Latin poets, especiall}' of the Georgics of Virgil, which may well be taken as his companion. Fields are still covered with cerintha and lupin — the \"tristis lupinus \" — and the peasants stiU, in cloudy weather, tell the hour by the position of this flower, which, like the sunflower, turns, as PUny describes, with the sun. The wood of the plough is still elm — \" Et corvi fonnam accepit nlmos aratri \" ; Georg. L 170. and the oxen still drag back the inverted plough — \" Videre fessos vomerem inversum boves Collo trahentes languido.\" Horace, Ep. ii. 63. The vinedresser also recalls Horace as he exercises his wit upon the passengers in the neighbouring highway — \"Durus Vindemiator, et in\\'ictus, cui saepe viator Cessisset, magna compeOans voce cucullum \" ; Sat. L 7. and the wild fig -tree stiU spUts the rocks with its \" evil strength \" — \" Ad quae Discutieoda valent sterilis mala robora ficus.\" Juvenal, X. 145. The artist will find few subjects attractive to his pencil, which are not architectural, after leaving Amalfi and Paestum ; but RocceUa, Scilla, and the forests of Pietra Pennata are exceptions. To the historian and antiquarian a tour through the Southern Provinces must always be of extreme interest. But it is to the architect especially that such a tour commends itself, though he XXX INTRODUCTION may cease his investigations at Paestum on the west, and with the Terra d'Otranto on the eastern coast. A journey undertaken with a camera for the sole purpose of tracing the gradual victory of Benedictine Lombardic over Byzantine art in Apulia, would bring rich reward. \" Though the architectural objects in Southern Italy adopted Christian forms they never abandoned the classical feeling in details, and it is this which mainly renders them worthy of study. Whether considered in dimensions, outline, or constructive peculiarities, their churches will not bear a moment's comparison with those of the north ; but in elegance of detail they often surpass purely Gothic build- ing to such a degree as to become to some extent as worthy of study as their more ambitious rivals. . . . Their great interest in the eyes of the student consists in their forming a link between the Eastern and Western worlds, and thus joining together two styles which we have hitherto been in the habit of considering as having no point of contact. \" The style of architecture which most resembles that used in ApuUa is the one we find prevailing in the valley of the Po during the twelfth and early part of the thirteenth centuries ; but we miss entirely in the south the reed-like pillars which formed so favourite a mode of decoration in Verona and elsewhere ; we miss also the figured sculpture which everywhere adorned the northern portals and facades. The Greek iconoclastic feeling prevailed to such an extent in the south as entirely to prevent the introduction of the human form, either in bas-reliefs or in single figures ; but the architects indemnified themselves for this by the introduction of lions, elephants, and monsters of all sorts, to an extent foimd nowhere else, and by the lavish employment of sculptured foliage and richly carved frets and mouldings and a bold system of bracketing, which gave to the style as much richness as can be desired, often combined into great beauty of detail.\" — Fergusson, In Basilicata and Calabria almost every ancient building has perished in the numerous earthquakes which have devastated those provinces, but in Southern Latium, the Abruzzi, Campania, and above all in Apulia, magnificent remains are to be seen which illustrate every period of architectural evolution — of polygonal walls and gates, at Cassino, Alatri, and Arpino : of Greek temples, at Paestum and Metaponto ; of Roman buildings, at Aquino, S. Germano, Capua, Naples, Pozzuoli, Herculaneum, Pompeii, and Beneventum ; of mediaeval cathedrals and Bene- dictine abbeys, always of interest and often of unexpected magnificence, at Beneventum, Troja, Lucera, Barletta, Trani, Bitonto, Bitetto, Bari, Altamura and Matera ; of splendid monasteries, at Casamari, Trisulti, Fossanuova, Monte Cassino, and La Cava ; of world-famous shrines at Monte Vergine and Monte S. Angelo ; of noble castles at Avezzano, Naples, Melfi, Lucera, Lago Pesole, Castel del Monte, and Oria ; of countless exquisitely beautiful tombs, pulpits, thrones, paschal candelabra, and other works of sculpture at Aquila, Salerno, Ravello, and in the churches of Naples. Besides these, the great palace of Caserta will claim attention from the architect, being almost the only modern building of importance in Southern Italy, though, while the Bourbon sovereigns took little trouble for the advancement of their kingdom, their care for their own comfort is evinced by the number of palaces built by them. No kingdom of the size had so many royal residences. Besides the palaces in Sicily, INTRODUCTION xjod La Reggia in the capital, Capodimonte and Portici in its immediate suburbs, and the dreary Caserta, the sovereigns had villas at Gaeta, at Castellamare, at Carditello, and at Persano near Paestum, with the castles of Procida and Ischia for sea- bathing. \" Sotto questo cielo non neiscono sciocchi \" is at least a proverb, and many NeapoUtans have been distinguished in hterature since the days of Statins, Domitian's laureate, who was a native of Neapohs (Parthenope). Amongst these we may reckon Vico, the logician ; Giannone, the historian of the Two Sicihes ; Filangieri, the jurist ; Galiani, the economist (though bom at Chieti), Bartolomeo Capasso, and the Abbe SameUi. * ^ * The Editor takes this opportunity of thanking Messrs. G. Sommer, of Naples, and Signer R. Moscioni, of Rome, for permission to use certain of their photographs for the illustration of this work. CHAPTER I Frosinone : Veroli : Trisulti : II Pozio di Santulla : Casamari : Monte S. Giovanm : Rocca Ducale : Ceccano : Ceprano : Fondi : Speilonga : Itri : Formia : Gaeta : Spaianise : Mintumo. Frosinone (Albergo Garibaldi), 9760 inhabitants. A beautifu place (955 ft.), witli an exquisite name, spreads over a picturesque hiU which it cro'WTis with a tall campanile. It is two miles from the station on the Rome-Naples Une, and seven south of Feren tino. It looks over the vale of the Sacco and across to the Monti Lepini and the Hemican mountains. It belonged to the redoubtable Volsci, whom the Romans deprived here of a portion of their territory for inciting the Hemicans to rebel. It became a miUtary colony, and suffered at the hands alternately of BeUsarius and Vitiges, but prospered in the Middle Ages until, in 1798, the French sacked and burned it. Juvenal describes the contrast bet^veen the economy and tranquiUity of life in Frusino and in the neighbouring to^\\^ls. A few relics of a Roman amphitheatre alone witness to its antiquity. Its interest Ues in its beauty of position, its fertihty, and the charming costume of its women. From here the road due north travels to Alatri (see Days near Rome), and thence, via Collepardo, to the beautiful Certosa di Trisulti. If we turn off to the right, at Pignano, there is a road to Veroli (17 kilometres from Frosinone), 11,070 inhabi- tants, situated on a spur of Mount Castellone, and ha\\ing seven gates. On the north side are to be seen remains of polygonal walls and the ancient acropolis. One tower of the mediaeval castle remains. From the highest point, called Civita, is obtained a superb panoramic view over the valleys of the Sacco and Cosa. The Duomo is in the Piazza, and has choir-stalls, finely car\\'ed, of nut. The breviary of S. Louis of Toulouse, brother of King Robert of Naples, is among the treasures shown by the sacristan. In S. Saloma is the tomb of Francesca Leni, of Arpino, and there is a majolica -tiled pavement. Excursions to the Abbey of Casamari (four hours) ; Bauco (two hours). A carriage may be obtained at Frosinone Station (54 miles from Rome) for the excursion to the Carthusian monastery of Trisulti (about two hours distant), to which the road leads Z A 2 SOUTHERN ITALY through beautiful mountain-scenery. About a mile from the village of CoUepardo (by a path which turns left before enter- ing it) is the strange hole called II Pozzo di Santulla, a pit in the rock recalling the Latomiae of Syracuse, about 400 yards round and 200 feet deep, hung with vast stalactites, and fringed at the top with weird ilex (guide, 5 lire). The Pozzo, says tradi- tion, was once a vast threshing-floor, on which the people im- piously threshed corn upon the fcsta of the Assumption, when the outraged Madonna caused it to sink into the earth, with all who were upon it, and it remains to this day a memorial of her wrath. Beyond Santulla the majestic character of the scenery increases. The path winds round a chaos of great rocks, and descends into a deep gorge, whence it mounts again to the final isolated plateau of Trisulti, close under the snows, and overlooking a splendid ravine. Here is a wood of old oaks carpeted with lilies, and beyond it Alpine pastures, sheeted in spring with mountain crocus and iris. Only the booming of a bell through these solemn mountain solitudes tells the traveller that he is near the monastery, until he is close upon it, and then a mass of white buildings, overtopped by a church, reveals itself on the edge of a great rocky platform. The interior of the monastery is modernised, but its well-kept courts, garden, and curious fountains, have a beauty of their own, in the Carthusian fashion. Moreover, the magnificent bald ridges look down into them over the roofs. AU seems peaceful with these silent white brethren ! The church, built in 1208 by Innccent HI., was restored in 1768. It is lined with precious marbles. In the sacristy is a good picture by the Cavalier e d'Arpino, and on either side of the church are two large pictures by the modern artist Balbi of Alatri, one representing Moses striking the rock, the other the same miracle as performed by S. Bruno. Over the high altar is a fresco of the sending out the first Carthusian monks to colonise Trisulti. The terrace beyond the little garden, with its formal box-edges, leads to the spezerla, decorated by Balbi, where many herbal medicines, and excellent liqueurs and perfumes are made by the monks. The country people come hither from a great distance to receive gratuitous medicine and advice, and in all respects the monks are considered the best friends and helpers of the poor of the neighbouring villages in sickness or trouble. May and June are good months for visiting it. A little path turning to the left outside the gateway of Trisulti gives the best view of the monastic buildings, and continues through the forest to the Gothic chapel and cell of S. Domenico Loricato, who first collected a number of hermits around him on this spot, and built a chapel which he dedicated to S. Bartholo- mew. In returning to Ceprano, or Alatri, a divergence should be made, leaving the horses at the top of the rock, to visit the famous TV- r^ \"-TJ^ ^h S 4. n- ;-^^\"M V ^)f '--^,-':^:^^djs-- CASAiURI 3 Grottoes of Collepardo. A stony path winds by zigzags into the abyss of the Cosa. Here the scenery is magnificent : the gorge is very narrow, only wide enough to contain the stream and the path by its side, and on the left rises a tremendous precipice, in the face of which yawns the cavern. It is best to take the precau- tion of ordering what is called an \"illumination\" on the way to Trisulti, and one costing five Ure is the best to ask for, as producing the degree of light which is enough to show, but not to annihilate, the effect of darkness. Attended by a troop of boys, we descend into the earth by a wide path Uke a hillside, and then ascend by a narrower rocky way through the darkness, lighted by glaring torches. Suddenly we find ourselves on the edge of a chasm, something Uke the Pozzo di Santulla, with a kind of rock-altar rising in the midst, blazing with fire, and throwing a ghastly glare on the wondering faces overlooking the edge of the abyss, and on the sides of the tremendous columns of stalactite which rise from the ground to the roof Uke a vast natural cathedral, and seem to faU again in showers of petrified fountains. Sir R. C. Hoare says that \" the large vaulted roof, spacious halls, fantastic columns and pyramids, imitating rustic, yet unequaUed, architecture, present a fairy palace which rivals the most gorgeous descriptions of romance.\" But Collepardo must be seen to be reaUsed ; seen, with its vast stalactite halls opening one beyond another, not level, but broken by rugged cUffs with winding pathlsts along their edges ; seen, with its flame-bearing pinnacles sending volumes of bright smoke into the upper dark- ness ; seen, with its groups of wondering people clambering along the rocks, with their flashing torches, shouting to one another cis they go, and startUng the bats and owls, which add by their shrieks to the unearthly confusion. Casamari, almost washed by the Amaseno, which is crossed by a ferry (iraghelto), now a Trappist abbey, was originally Bene- dictine, and in 1 1 5 1 Cistercian. It more resembles a fortress than a convent, and is a national monument Uke Monte Cassino. The foundation-stone of its Gothic church was laid in 1203. The entramce through a round-arched central portal, carried on six lateral shafts, leads into nave and aisles of six bays, with side altars. The west front has a good rose-window between two lancets. At the fifth pair of piers a screen of wrought iron separates the monastic portions of the church from the lay. The floor is decorated with tiles bearing the Barberini bees. The soft cream-Uke tone of the travertine, with which it is built, is remarkably fresh. The choir contains a \" tribuna \" made after the manner of a small temple in the Corinihian style, and of fine marble. The transepts have eastern chapels. The Cloister, surrounded by Lombard arcades carried on coupled columns of varjing design, is entered from the proces- sional door of the south aisle, and the usual Cistercian arrange- ment of the domestic buildings ensues. In the centre is the 4 SOUTHERN ITALY well. The chapter-house, infirmary, and dormitories are shown by the courtesy of the Prior. The site is supposed to be identifiable with Cereatae, which claims equally with Arpino to be the birthplace of Caius Marius. The long row of store-sheds before the piazza of the monastery serves for shops during the fair held here on the feast of S. Matthew. From Casamari can be reached Monte S. Giovanni Campano (Locanda F°. CinelU), 5710 inhabitants ; said to have originated in the refugees from Cereatae, and formerly a fief of the Marchese di Pescara. The Piazza, \" II Belvedere,\" on tliree sides commands magnificent prospects. To the north-west rises with two of its towers the Rocca Ducale. The chapel was formerly the prison, where S. Thomas Aquinas was confined by order of his mother and brothers in order to prevent his adopting the ecclesiastical career, and from it he escaped to Monte Cassino. S. Maria della Valle is said to be constructed after a design by Bramante. It contains a good wooden statue of the Virgin (sixteenth century). In the neighbourhood are worked asphalt, petroleum, &c. Monte Pedicino can be visited in four hours. Ceccano, 900 ft. (Locanda Anelli), 7260 inhabitants, on the side of a hill overlooking a deep glen and the valley of the Sacco. The upper town was girdled with walls by Pope Silverius. The newer town below is much resorted to by visitors in the hot season. Woollen and paper factories are the chief sources of in- dustry. On the left of the Sacco, two miles south of Ceccano, is the site of Fabrateria Vetus, a Volscian city made into a Roman colonia. In ancient days the Sacco bore the name of Trerus. Amaseno, a fief of Colonna, with a castle, can be visited from here. Ceprano (buffet at the station), 5100 inhabitants, on the right bank of the Liris. The town is three kilometres from the line. Paschal II. lived here while he was quarrelling with the Emperor, Henry V., about the Investitures, and deposed the Archbishop of Benevento. Here, fifty years later, Manfred was betrayed by his troops (cf. Dante, Inferno, Cto. xxviii. 16). Near it, on high ground, was situated the Oscan Fregellae, destroyed 125 b.c. for rebellion. It arose again under the name of Vic us Cipri. Fondi, on the Via Appia, may be reached from Terracina, or from Ceprano by a very beautiful mountain road descending near Lenola. It is a picturesque walled town in the province of Caserta, and but eleven miles from Terracina, overlooking the Lago di Fondi and the Gulf of Terracina. It was a municipium in 338 B.C., and a colonia in 188 b.c, and is well worthy a visit of two or three days (10,100 inhabitants). Horace satirises the airs of the local official {Sat. i. 5, 34). The castle of the Caetani, with many towers, and flamboyant windows, adjoins the cathe- dral. The latter has a fine portal with the usual lions and a fifteenth-century tomb of Onorato Caetani, Lord of Fondi. The episcopal throne is of the thirteenth century, and decorated with mosaic (Cosmatesque). Robert of Geneva was here elected ITRI S antipope to Urban VI. (Prignano) in 1378, a fact especially annoying to the latter, who was a Neapolitan. S. Maxia contains a Cosmatesque pulpit and a Madonna by Silvestro dei Buoni, 1490. In 1534 Hayradeen Barbarossa, brother of the Pseudo-Dey of Algiers, landed at Sperlonga (Spelunca), with a view to raiding Fondi and carrjing off, as a prize for Selim II., Giulia Gonzaga, the lovely widow of Vespasiano Colonna. Her servants were mercilessly massacred, but she escaped in her night-dress from a window, and took refuge in the mountains. The Turks again sacked Fondi in 1594. The famous Caecuban vine (Horace, Ode i. 20) is believed to have been gro\\\\Ti between Fondi and Itri. Sperlonga is a fishing village, finely situated on a head- land, and a resort of the ancient Romans. Suetonius and Tacitus tell how Sejanus, the powerful, but iU-fated, Chancellor of Tiberius, saved his master's life, when, at a banquet given in one of the decorated caves here, large stones fell from the vault and buried some of the suite as well as Sejanus, who hurled his body and arms over Tiberius, so as to shelter him. The guard excavated both, and Tiberius journeyed on to Capua in order to dedicate a temple there. The Grotta di Tiberio is shown a kilometre beyond the village (south). Leaving Fondi by the Via Appia (south-east) the road mounts gradually amid beautiful wild scenen.', past the Fontana S. Andrea, by a pass to Itri (690 ft.), with a crowning castle in ruins, built out of the substructure materials of the Appia Antica. Here was born Michele Pezza, otherwise the \" Fra Diavolo,\" of Auber's famous opera {d. 1806), a personage, what- ever bis crimes, who w^as much patronised by the royal family of Naples during the French invasion of 1798-99, when he and Mammone secured the passes from Portella to Mola di Gaeta. Ir\\ ing's sketch. The Inn of Terracina, has perpetuated the interest in him. The French pursued Pezza remorselessly, and having driven him to Sicily, and offered large rewards for his capture, he was discovered to them at Baronisi, near Palermo, in 1806, and shot. In earlier days Alarco Sciarra, a robber baron, promised Tasso a safe conduct through the region. Alter leaving Itri the road winds down to Formia, H. dei Fiori, facing south into the Gulf of Gaeta, passing near the round tower on square base, called the Tomba di Cicerone, overgrown with herbage (Albergo della Querela and dei Fiori). Formia is so exquisitely situated that Ischia and most of the promontories of the Bay of Naples can be surveyed from it. The Villa Caposele (a.d. 150) above it, is held to have been that of Cicero, whence he escaped to meet death at the swords of the Tribunes PopiUus and Herennius 43 b.c. Formerly a favourite resort of the Bourbon Kings of Naples, it now belongs to a private family who are good enough to permit \\asitors at stated times to see its gardens and ancient remains (fee, | lira at Palazzo Rubino), The mountains rise abruptly on the north side of the bay. 6 SOUTHERN ITALY Gaeta (Albergo Corona di Ferro), 5701 inhabitants, on the south-west, stretches out, Uke a long barrow, into the sea with its lighthouse, and was once a formidable fortress of the Neapolitan kingdom, and became the last refuge of Francis II. His Queen, Maria of Bavaria, heroically held it for four months in 1861 until the Sardinian fleet, on February 23, received the surrender. Hither, in November 1848, Pius IX. fled from Rome. From the Piazza a path leads to the summit of the promontorj', which is crowned by the Torre d' Orlando, being actually the tomb of Lucius Munatius Plancus, the founder of Lugdunum (Lyons) in the reign of Augustus. In 1504 the town surrendered to a Spanish fleet under Gonsalvo da Cordova, and in 1806 it held out for six months against Massena. The Duomo, S. Erasmo, has a thirteenth-century tower, and behind its high altar is preserved a banner presented by Pius V. to the victor of Lepanto, Don John of Austria, represent- ing the Saviour with SS. Peter and Paul. In front, rising from four lions, stands a sculptured Gothic column. The railway from Formia passes to Sparanise on the Naples- Rome route, near the coast. Minturno (460 ft.), the ancient Minturnae (where Marius concealed himself among the rushes of the Liris, and was made prisoner, but escaped almost miraculously from the barbarian sent to kill him), has the remains of an aqueduct and an amphi theatre, i.e., the modern Traetta. The town occupied both banks of the river and was made a colonia by Cajsar. Here Gonsalvo da Cordova gained his final triumph over the French (Decem- ber 27, 1503). Near S. Agata the road passes in sight of Sessa Aurunca (530 ft.), on the slope of Rocca Monfina, with another amphitheatre and a ruined bridge. The Duomo (twelfth century) contains a remarkable ambone (pulpit), and paschal candelabra. Beyond, on the right, rises Monte Massico (2660 ft.), famous for classic vintages. PLLI'IT IX S. PlETRO AT FONUI Moscioni CHAPTER II Sora : Isola : Arpino : Arce : Atina : Belmonte : Rocca Secca : Aquino : Pontecorvo : Monte Cassino : Rocca Janula : Teano : Calvi : Capua : StaJ Maria di Capua : Caserta : Cajazzo : Alife : Piedimonte : Val d' Inferno : Maddaloni : Cancello : Aversa. On the line from Avezzano, in the Abruzzi, to Rocca Secca on the Naples-Rome railway, stands Sora, 920 ft., a town of 6172 inhabitants, on the right bank of the half-encircUng Liris. Close behind it stand the polygonal walls of the ancient \" quiet country town \" of Juvenal (Albergo di Liris, Roma). In modem days the learned Cardinal Baronius (i 538-1607) was born here. It gives a ducal title to the Buoncompagni family. It is a prosperous place and admirably situated for excursions ; but it is more attractive for the costume and beauty of its women. Italian costume reaches its climax here ; and the festival of S. Restituta (May 27) affords the best occasion for studying it. At Isola, 710 ft. (Albergo Meglio), on the road to Arpino, occur the beautiful Falls of the Liris. The cascade tumbles in a mass of water, encircled by smaller streams, from beneath an old castle, almost into the midst of the town. The colour is glorious, and the iris more vivid than at Temi. Between it and Sora, on an island (Insula Arpinas) in the Fibreno, and close to its junction with the Liris, stands the convent of S. Domenico Abbate, where Gregory VII. was once a monk. This island belonged first to Cicero, and then to SiUus Italicus. Through the trees overhanging the waters are exquisite mountain-views ; and among the vegetation lie fragments and capitals of columns. The Roman bridge across the Liris, Ponte di Cicerone, remains. Arpino, 1475 ft. (Albergo della Pace), the birthplace of Cicero, bears for its municipal banner the letters M. T, C. He constantly alludes to his native town and describes the people there as rustic and simple, and with all the virtues of rugged mountaineers. It stands upon two hills ; one summit, the higher one, called Civita- Vecchia, occupies the ancient site of Volscian Arpinum, and retains its polygonal walls. The inscriptions let into the walls of various buildings tell of the ancient industry of woollen manu- facture and dyeing. Mercurius Lanarius had a temple here supposed to have occupied the site of the Church of Sta. Maria di Civita. The Porta dell' Arco, reached by the path opposite 7 8 SOUTHERN ITALY the hotel (2055 ft.), constructed of polygonal masonry, without cement, has been compared with the gate of Mycenae, though it probably dates only from the fifth century b.c. The ancient pavement hard by witnesses to the wheels of primitive waggons. The round towers along the walls are of the fifteenth century. The large square tower in the citadel was occupied by Ladislaus, King of Naples, on his way to Rome, 1404. Arce, below the old castle of Rocca d'Arce, commands wonderful views. It occupies the site of Arx Volsciorum, with polygonal walls and other remains. Atina, on the road from Sora to Cassino, is a mediaeval hill- town. Near it, on another point of the mountain, are the polygonal remains of its Volscian predecessor, reputed to have been founded by Saturn : \" Atina potens,\" and it is mentioned as a snowy spot by Silius Italicus : \" Monte nivoso I, .' Descendens Atiua.\" The drive down hence to Cassino (11 miles), past Belmonte and S. Elia, is never to be forgotten. The village of Rocca Secca, three miles from the line, is not inviting, and sits on its bare flank of mountain, with little visible means of subsistence. Above it are the ruins of the castle in which Thomas Aquinas (it is said by some) saw the light. A few miles further we reach Aquino, 335 ft., the birthplace of Juvenal, and once a place of importance. Strabo speaks of it as chief among the Volscian cities. Dolabella was put to death here. The town was de- stroyed by the Lombards, whereupon the inhabitants took refuge at Castro Cielo, on the top of the mountain. Thence after a tims they descended to Palazzuolo, where their descendants probably exist stiU. The circuit of ancient Aquinum is now filled with vineyards and gardens, amid which gigantic fragments of ruin appear at intervals. The desolate suburban Church of S. Maria Libera is approached by an immense flight of marble steps, once the approach to a temple. The walls are encrusted with fragments of ancient carving. Glorious friezes of acanthus in the highest relief surround the great door. A mosaic of the twelfth century represents the Virgin and Child, and below, on either side, is a sarcophagus, with a female head projecting from it, one in- scribed \" Ottolina,\" the other \" Maria.\" Ottolina has been identified with the wife of Adolfino, son of Landolfo of Aquino, first Count of Alsito, and sister-in-law of S. Thomas Aquinas. The interior of the church was curious, having six pillars on one side of the nave and only three on the other ; since 1870 ignorant mania for uniformity has destroyed its interest. Close to the church is a beautiful httle Triumphal Arch, with Corinthian columns. A mill-stream has been diverted through it, and it stands reflected in the clear water, which falls below it in a series of miniature cascades. AQUINO 9 Descending the great marble staircase, we find a lane following the Via Latina, which retains some of its ancient polygonal lava pavement. Passing a succession of Roman fragments, we reach the ruined Church of S. Tommaso, in which are several beautiful fragments of frieze from local temples. A Uttle beyond, the Via Latina is crossed by the massive Porta S. Lorenzo, a Roman gateway in perfect preservation, by which we enter the circuit of the ancient city, passing through the still existing hne of old walls. Farther down the Via Latina is a succession of buildings in ruins — a theatre ; some colossal blocks, shown as having belonged to a temple of Diana, and now called S. Maria Madda- lena ; and a huge mass of wall, beheved to have belonged to a temple of Ceres, afterwards converted into the beisihca of S. Pietro Vetere. AH the ruins are embedded in vineyards and gardens. Returning through the Arco S. Lorenzo, and follow- ing the little stream in the valley, we find a strange old church supported upon open arches, through which there occur most picturesque views of the present town, scrambling along the edge of tufa rocks, crested and overhung by fig-trees. The mediasval city, which arose under the powerful Counts of Aquino, is the oldest bishopric in the Roman Church. Its bishops sign ecclesiastical documents immediately after the archbishops, and the whole cathedral chapter of Aquino have stiU the right to wear mitres and full episcopal robes. S. Thomas Aquinas was bom, March 7, 1224, in the still exist- ing Casa Reale (the old palace of Aquino, with Venetian Gothic windows), being the son of Count Landolfo and his wife Teodora Caracciolo. His grandfather married the sister of the Emperor Frederick L, and he was therefore great-nephew of that prince. It has been the custom to say he was born at Rocca Secca, which, however, was never more than a mere \" fortezza \" of the Counts of Aquino, but never used by them as a residence ; and all uncertainty has been cleared up by the recent discovery of a letter of the saint in the archives of Monte Cassino, sajdng that he was coming to seek the blessing of the Abbot Bernard before setting out upon a journey, and that he intended to visit his birthplace at Aquino on the way. Here the youngest sister of S. Thomas was killed by a flash of lightning, while sleeping in the room with him and her nurse. At five j'ears S. Thomas was sent to school at Monte Cassino, but at twelve his masters declared themselves unable to teach him any more. On account of his stoUd silence, he obtained the nickname of \" the dumb ox,\" but his celebrated tutor Albertus Magnus, after some answers on difl&cult subjects, said, \" We call him the dumb ox. but he wUl give such a bellow in learning as will astonish the whole world.\" At seventeen he received the habit of S. Domenico at Naples. His mother, the Countess Teodora, tried to prevent his taking the final vows, and he fled from her toward Paris. At Acquapendente he was intercepted by his brothers Landolfo and Rinaldo, who tore oS his habit, and carried him to his father's lo SOUTHERN ITALY castle of Rocca Secca. Here his mother met him, and finding her entreaties vain, shut him up, and allowed him to see no one but his two sisters, whose exhortations she hoped would bend him to her will. On the contrary, he converted his sisters, and, after two years' imprisonment, one of them let him down from a window, and he was received by some Dominicans, and pro- nounced the final vows. Gradually S. Thomas became the greatest theological teacher and writer of his time. When he refused a bishopric, the Pope made him always attend his person, and thus his lectures were given in the different towns of papal residence — Rome, Viterbo, Orvieto, Fondi, and Perugia. The crowning work of S. Thomas was the Summa Theologia — the science of the Christian religion ; but to ordinary readers he is perhaps less known by his theology than by his hymns, of which \" Pange Lingua\" and \" Tantum Ergo \" are the most celebrated. Near Aquino is the mountain castle of Loreto, which belonged to the parents of S. Thomas. It was while they were staying there that he, a boy, stole all the contents of the family larder to distribute to the poor. The legend tells that, when his father intercepted him, and commanded him to give up what his cloak contained, a shower of roses fell from it to the ground. Three miles beyond Aquino, the road which passes under the Arco S. Lorenzo reaches Pontecorvo, once an independent state like Monaco. In the Middle Ages it belonged alternately to the Tomacelli and to the abbey of Monte Cassino. Napoleon gave it as a duchy to Bernadotte. The town is well situated, and is approached by a triumphal arch, adorned with a statue of Pius IX. The cathedral stands on the substructions of an ancient temple. The costumes here are magnificent. On the left of the railway, the great convent of Monte Cassino is seen crowning a rocky hill-top above the plain of the Garig- liano, and the fine old castle of Rocca Janula occurs over- looking Cassino. Inn, Albergo Varrone, clean and reasonable. From the station to the Abbey and back for two persons, 4 lire. Cassino (10,000 inhabitants) occupies the site of the Roman Casinum, which Strabo describes as the last town of Latium on the Latin Way. Livy tells how Hannibal intended occupying it in order to prevent the Consul Fabius from advancing on Campania, but was led by a mistake of his guide to Casilinum. Silius Italicus mentions its springs and its foggy climate. Casi- num continued to flourish under the empire, but was destroyed by the Lombards in the sixth century. Its former name of S. Germano was derived from a holy bisliop of Capua, a contem- porary and friend of S. Benedict. Half a mile from the town, just above the high-road from S. Germano to Rome, is the principal relic of Casinum, an Amphi- theatre, small, but perfect externally, built, as an inscription (now at Monte Cassino) narrates, at the private expense of Nunnidia Quadratilla, whose Ufe and death are celebrated by MONTE CASSINO ii Pliny the younger. The interior is a field and the seats are gone. Just above stands the little Church of the Crodfisso, occupying an ancient tomb, which is shown as that of NunnidiaQuadratiUa. It is cruciform witli a dome in the centre, recalling the tomb of Galla Placidia at Ravenna. The blocks of travertine in the entrance walls are colossal. At the head of the steps in front of the church is a sacrificial altar. Immediately beneath cire the vast remains of the seminary of Monte Cassino, occupying the site of the historic convent Plumbariola. Near the town, on the banks of the Fiiime Rapido, are some ruins, supposed to belong to the Villa of Varro, of which Cicero has left a detailed description. It was here that Antony indulged in those orgies against which the great orator poured forth his perilous eloquence. The CoUegiata of S. Germano was built by the Abbot GisuLfo in the ninth centurj', and, though greatly altered in the seventeenth century, retains its twelve ancient marble columns. Donkeys (2 hre) may be obtained for the ascent (1703 ft.) to the monastery. The steep stony path which used to wind above the roofs of the houses is superseded. Instead there is a fine zigzag road, leaving to the right the ruins of the castle of Rocca Janula, twice besieged and taken by Frederick II. The views are indescribably beautiful, and small oratories here and there by the wayside offer shelter from wind and sun, and commemorate the Benedictine story. First we have that of S. Placidus, the favourite disciple of the patriarch ; then that of S. Scholastica, his beloved sister ; then a triple-chapel, where one of the Benedictine miracles occurred. Beyond these, a cross marks the final meeting-place of Benedict and Scholastica. It is not known that the twin sister of S. Benedict ever took any vows, though she privately dedicated herself to God from childhood, ^^'^len her brother came to his mountain monastery, she followed him, and founded a rehgious house in the valley below (at Plumbariola, it is supposed), where she devoted herself to a Ufe of prayer with a number of pious women, her companions. At her last interview with her brother on this spot, after they had passed the day together in rehgious exercises, Scholastica implored Benedict to remain with her till the morning, that they might praise God through the night, but the saint refused, saying that it was impossible for him to be absent from his convent. Then Scholastica bent over her clasped hands and prayed ; and, though the weather was beautiful, and there was not a cloud in the sky, the rain began immediately to fall in such torrents, accompanied by thunder and lightning of such a terrific kind, that neither Benedict nor the brethren who were with him could leave the place where they were. \" The Lord be merciful to you, my sister,\" said the abbot; \"what have you done?\" \" You have rejected my prayers,\" answered Scholastica, \" but God has been more merciful ; \" and thus the brother and sister remained together till the morning. S. Gregory the Great, who tells the storj', says that one must not be surprised that the wish 12 SOUTHERN ITALY of the sister was heard by God rather than that of the brother, because, of the two, the sister was the one who loved Him the most, and with God the one who loves the most is always the most powerful. As we draw nearer the convent, 1703 ft., we find a cross in the middle of the way. In front of it a grating covers the mark of a knee which is said to have been left in the rock by S. Benedict when he knelt there to ask a blessing before laying the foundation- stone of his convent. Benedict came hither from Subiaco, when he had already been thirty-six years a monk, led through the windings of the Apennines, says the tradition, alternately by two angels and two ravens, until he reached this spur of the mountain above Casinum, which had then already been ruined by Genseric. Not strange to say, the inhabitants of this wild district in the sixth century of Christianity were still pagan, and worshipped Apollo in a temple on the top of the mountain, where also was a grove sacred to Venus. Dante writes in allusion to this — \" Quel monte, a cui Cassino e nella costa, Fu frequentato gia in sua la ciraa Dalla gente ingaruiata e mal disposta. Ed io son quel che su vi portai prima Lo nome di colui clie'n terra addusse La verita, che tanto ci sublima ; E tanta grazia sovra me rilusse, Ch'io ritrassi le ville circostanti Dall' empio culto che'l mondo sedusse.\" Par. xxii. 37. We enter the abbey by a great gate guarded by two lions, and ascend a low vaulted staircase, the only portion of the building ascribed to the time of Benedict. On the right a lamp burns before an old marble statue of the founder ; at the top Benedict and Scholastica kneel before the Virgin and Child. Here the peasants of the neighbourhood in their wonderful costumes — some almost Egyptian -looking — assemble to receive the dole of the convent, or bring up provisions. We are shown into a large bare chamber by a lay-brother who then goes to signify our arrival to the Prior. The latter presently advances to receive us, and in excellent English demands how long our stay will be : \" Is it for three days, three months, or three years ? \" The low vault of the entrance was intended to show the yoke of humility to which the entering monk must bend. It is in- scribed : Fornicem saxis asperum ac depressum tantae moll's aditum angustum ne mireris, hospes, angusiitm fecit patriarchae sanctiias : venerare potius et sospes ingredere. Above the gate is a square tower (modernised externally), of which the lower portion at least is ancient. It contains two chambers inscribed : Pars inferior tiirris, in qua S. P. N. Benedichis dum viverct habitabat ; and, V etustissimtim habitaculum in quo SStni patri- archae discipuli quiescebant. This then occupies the position of the cell where S. Benedict MONTE CASSINO 13 dwelt for twenty -three years (520-43), and which, as the source of monastic law, Pope Victor III. has not hesitated to compare to Sinai. \" Haec domus est similis Sinai sacra jura ferenti, Ut lex demonstrat hie quae fuit edita quondam. Lex tunc exiNit, mentes quae ducit ab imis, Et vulgata dedit lumen par climata saecli.\" Lm Osiietisis, Chron. Casinen. iii. 27. The room in the upper part of the tower is shown as that in which Benedict saw in a vision the death of the bishop S. Ger- mano. Here also, only trwo days after his last and miraculously prolonged interview with her, he saw the soul of his sister Scho- lastica ascending as a dove to heaven, and becoming thus aware of her death and translation \" was filled with joy, and his grati- tude flowed forth in hymns and praises to God.\" He then begged the monks to fetch her body, that it might be laid in the tomb in which he should rest himself. The brother only survived the sister for forty days, days spent in the most austere observance of his own monastic rule. Feeling his end approaching, he bade the monks to carry him to the oratory of S. John Baptist, where he caused the tomb of his sister to be opened. Resting by its side, at the foot of the adtar, he received the viaticum, and then, extending his hands to heaven, he died in the arms of his companions, March 21, 543, at the very hour which, according to the legend, he had foretold. Benedict was laid by Scholastica, \" so that death might not divide those whose souls had been united in God.\" A beautiful and spacious courtyard, by Bramante, adorned with statues of the chief benefactors, and with a fair fountain in the midst, occupies the centre of the building. Open arcades, on either side, display other courts, now used as gardens, where, amid the flowers, are preserved many portions of the granite pillars from the church which the Abbot Desiderius, afterwards Pope Victor III., built in the eleventh century. Colossal statues of Benedict and Scholastica guard the ascent to the upper quad- rangle, \" II Paradiso,\" which is centred by a well. Near the entrance of the church are the parents of Benedict, of Placidus, and of Maurus. The Uving raven which hops about here, and which is quite a feature of the monastery, commemorates the birds which miraculously guided the patriarch hither from Subiaco. At sundown we stood on one of the terraces and looked over to the western mountains, the e\\ening breeze whispering among the flowers at our feet. The last burst of golden hght swept the great crags in the south, and burned like tongues of fire upon the calm snow-cro%vns of the nearer Abruzzi, and streaming across to the monastery, illumined the solemn cypress-tops, and cast a tender aureole about the dome of the abbey-church. Ttie rich deep voices of the monks rose softly in vespers, and the olive-trees seemed to quiver with the blending harmonies. 14 SOUTHERN ITALY At midnight, at the window of the cell. What a vision of loveliness was there ! The silvery world was now still, as in a heavenly trance. The nearly full moon was enthroned above the mountains, that dreamed like enchanted giants. Far down in the vale the rapid rivers were screened with spellbound vapours. Long before the sun arose the ridges lost their intense pallor and gradually blushed into mysterious carmine as of spilled roses, while their lower ranges and their foot-hills loomed out weirdly in shades of plum-like purple. Later the morning- star faded, and feeling slowly for his new dominion the sun poured his great arms of gold over peak and promontory, and at last again enfolded the shrine of S. Benedict. The existing church was built after 1648 in the form of a Latin cross. It is of the most extreme magnificence — and rivals S. Martino at Naples in the richness and ostentation of its marbles. The doors have plates of the original bronze gates of the church of Desiderius, inlaid with silver letters containing a list of all the possessions of the abbey in 1066, when they were made at Constantinople. The roof of the nave is painted by Luca Giordano, and by the same painter is a great fresco over the doors, depicting the consecration of the first basilica by Alexander II. The stalls of the choir are splendid specimens of Renaissance carving : in the centre of each is a Benedictine saint. Here hang four pictures by Solimcna. In the left transept is the tomb of Pietro de' Medici, who was drowned in the Garigliano, December 27, 1503, by the overcrowding and sinking of a boat, in which he was taking flight after the defeat of the French by Gonsalvo da Cordova. The bas-reliefs are by Sangallo. In the opposite transept is the tomb of Guidone Fieramosca, last Prince of Mignano. In the side chapels are several works of Marco Mazzaroppi, the best representing S. Gregory the Great, and the Martyrdom of S. Andrew. Beneath the high altar, and surrounded by a chain of lamps, repose Benedict and Scholastica, with these words only over their grave, \" Benedictum et Scholasticam, Uno in terris partu editos, Una in Deuin pictate coelo redditos, Unus hie excipit tumulus Mortalis deposit! pro aeteniitatc custos.\" In the crypt below, where Tasso, on his last journey to Rome, knelt by the founder's tomb, are some ruined frescoes by the rare master Marco da Siena. In the sacristy a number of magnificent old copes are preserved. Here are a curious old brazier and a stone lavatory. The services are four daily. The refectory contains an immense picture by Francesco and Leandro Bassano. In the upper part, Christ is represented performing the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes; in the lower, S. Benedict is distributing the symbolical bread of the Benedictine rule. The painter Leandro has introduced his own 't :^'Li. ■ . CASSIXO 1 5 figure to the left of the saint. In the corner is John Cal\\in (?), livid with disgust. The Library, built in the sixteenth century, by the Abbot Squarcialupi, contains about 20,000 volumes. Its origin mounts up to the foundation of the abbey, for S. Benedict mentions it in one of the rules of his Order. Eight hundred original diplomas remain, containing the charters and privileges accorded to the abbey by popes, emperors, and kings. The collection of Lombard charters deserves especial notice on account of the miniatures placed at the head of each, a contemporary portrait-gallery rudely executed, but at least interesting, as displaying the costume of the time. The earUest charter, bearing date 884, is of a Prince of Beneventum, and begins — \" Ajo Dei providentia Lx)ngobardorum gentis princeps.\" The earhest buU is that of Pope Zacharias of the beginning of the eighth century. Amongst the MSS. is a coeval copy of Dante. Most of the pictures at Mont Cassino were stolen to form the gallery at Naples. A few sketches, by old masters, which remain, are collected in the cell of S. Benedict. It requires more than a passing visit to Monte Cassiuo in order reaUy to appreciate it. The views are such as grow upon one daily, and are full of interest. The highest peak is Monte Cairo, near the foot of which is the patriarchal fortress of the family of S. Thomas Aquinas. Through the valley winds the Garigiiano. In the plain between it and the sea the great battle was gained by Gonsalvo da Cordova, from Pietro de' Medici, who was drowned in crossing the GarigUano, and to whom his uncle, Clement VII., gave a tomb here. Between the mountains the Mediterranean may be descried, gUttering in the Bay of Gaeta. The services which Jlonte Cassino has rendered to Uterature have exempted it from the entire confiscation which has fallen upon other religious houses in Southern Italy since its incorpora- tion in the kingdom. But the monks have a bare subsistence allowed them, and times are indeed changed since the Abbot of Monte Cassino, \" Abbas Abbatum,\" was the first baron of the kingdom of Naples, administrator of a diocese (created 1321) composed of 37 parishes ; while amongst the dependencies of the abbey were 4 bishoprics, 2 principahties, 20 countships, 250 castles, 440 towns and villages, 336 manors, 23 seaports, 33 islands, 200 mills, 300 tracts of land, and 1662 churches. Its revenues at the end of the sixteenth century were valued at 500,000 ducats. The abbot is bishop during his spiritual rule, which is hmited to six years, after which he becomes a simple monk again, only retaining the right of wearing the abbatial cross, and of precedence in rehgious ceremonies. After leaving Cassino, the railway passes nothing of importance till it reaches — Teano {.rVlbergo Lancellotti). The town, several miles to the right, at the foot of Rocca Monfina, 3297 ft., contains a magnificent I6 SOUTHERN ITALY castle of the Duke of Sermoneta, built in the fifteenth century by the Dukes of Sessa. It has stabling for a hundred horses. The cathedral dates from 1530, but has ancient columns, and the town possesses other small remains of amphitheatre, theatre, &c., belonging to Teanum Sidicinum, which formerly occupied this site. In the cloister of a suppressed convent is the efhgy of Marino Marziano, Duke of Sessa, who married a sister of Ferdinand I. of Aragon, but who was so consumed by hatred of his brother-in-law that he openly received his enemy, John of Anjou, in his castle of Sessa, and afterwards tried to murder Ferdinand in a lonely spot between Teano and Cerignola. He was seized and im- prisoned in the dungeons of the Castel Nuovo at Naples, where he died, some say was strangled. The mineral springs of Teano had a very early celebrity and are mentioned by Pliny. The chalybeate spring, called Acqua delle Canterelle, is the source of the Savone, stigmatised by Statius as \" piger,\" or lazy. There is an exquisitely beautiful view toward the sea and islands from the neighbourhood of Teano. Sparanise (118 miles from Rome). Hence there is the line toGaeta. On the left (one mile) the poor village of Calvi has ruins of an amphitheatre, theatre, and other remains of the ' ancient Cales, whose wine {vinum Calenum) was praised by Horace. The cathedral is dedicated to its first bishop, S. Casto. Traversing the plain of the Volturno, and crossing the river, we reach — Capua (Inn, Lo:anda della Posta), a walled city (15,113 inhabi- tants), founded 856, by Count Lando and his brothers, on the site of the ancient Casilinum, which so stoutly resisted Hannibal. The Duomo is approached by a quadrangular court surrounded by twenty ancient columns. The interior (eleventh century) is a three-aisled basilica. Its twenty-four granite columns have newly gilt capitals. The black marble font is supported on lions. At the third altar on the right is a Madonna, between SS. Stephen and Lucy, of 1489, by Antoniazzo. The Norman crjrpt has twenty-two ancient columns, and contains a sarcophagus with a relief of the Hunt of Meleager, and a Holy Sepulchre by Botti- glieri. Until recent times the Archbishop of Capua was one of the greatest ecclesiastical dignitaries in Italy. In the Piazza de' Giudici is the modern Arch of S. Eligio, and many inscriptions. In front of the Church of S. Eligio are two ancient columns. The Torre Mignana still exists, to which the women fled when 5000 male inhabitants of Capua were massacred during the sack of the town by Caesar Borgia in 1501. The Cappella de' Morti, outside the town, is the place where mass was said for their souls. On October i, i860, the Battle of Capua was fought on the banks of the Volturno, and gained by Garibaldi over the troops of Francis II. The Museo Campano contains many objects of interest, especially statues in tufo. There are also some portrait-corbels from the Castello of Frederick II., including one of himself. CAPUA 17 S. Maxia di Capua or S. Maria Maggiore, si miles from Capua (Inn, Albergo di Roma), occupies the site of the ancient Capua (20,544 inhabitants). An Etruscan town, Capua (called Voltumum) was conquered by the Samnites in 423 B.C., but continued to be \" urbs maxima opulentissimaque Italiae.\"* After the battle of Cannae the town opened its gates to Hannibal, who made it his winter-quarters, 216 B.C., at a time when the luxurj'^ and effeminacy of its inhabitants were proverbial. Five years later it was taken by the Romans, who degraded it to the position of a third-rate provincial town ; but it rose again to prosperity under the Caesars, and continued to flourish till the invasion of Genseric, from which time it fell into ruin, being totally destroyed by the Saracens in 840 a.d. Of late years S. Maria has had a revival, chiefly owing to a small trade in leather. The magnificent ruins of the Amphitheatre (on the road to modern Capua, carriage thither i lira : entrance 50 c.) only date from imperial times. The measurements, 555 by 456 ft., were nearly those of the Roman Coliseum, and it was capable of accommodat- ing 70,000 spectators. It was from the gladiatorial schools of Capua that Spartacus broke out with seventy companions in 73 B.C. Not far distant are the remains of a Triumphal Arch, crossing the road. The Mens Tifata (1975 ft.), above Capua, so often mentioned in the history of the campaigns of Hannibal, was once crowned by a temple of Jupiter : the site is now occupied by Chapel of S.Nicola. Near the foot of the mount, on the site of a Temple of Diana Tifatina (3I miles from S. Maria, turning right beyond the amphitheatre), is S. Angelo in Formis (1058), a very interesting church, which is mentioned in records of the tenth, and is adorned with remarkable Byzantinesque frescoes of the eleventh century, illustrating entire sacred history. In the apse is seen the enthroned Saviour. The name in Formis is derived from the remains of an ancient aqueduct in the neighbour- hood. The railway proceeds through the richly planted Terra di Lavoro, level, and intersected with lines of poplars, with vines festooning from tree to tree, to — Caserta (19,750 inhabitants), 230 ft. Inns, Crocella, Villa Reale, Vittoria, Stella. The famous Palace of Caserta {casa-erta, the dreary house) faces the station (Albergo Vittoria and Villa Reale, automobiles obtainable). In its vastness and desolation it recalls the Escurial. It was considered by Valery and others to be the noblest con- ception of a palace in Europe. It was built (1752) by Vanvitelli for Charles III., who bought the estate and its feudal right from the Caetani, Dukes of Sermoneta. It forms a rectangle. Its fa9ade is 746 ft. long, 546 broad, and 125 high, and is built of the white travertine found near Capua, in the S. lorio quarries. \" The situation of this palace is often condemned as flat ; but is that a disadvantage ? A convent, a Gothic castle, a villa, a hunting-lodge may, like ordinary men, seek • Livy, vii. 31, 18 SOUTHERN ITALY distinction from eminence of station ; but this august pile, like a true hero, involves all its dignity in itself. It depends on no accessories, nor tricks of the picturesque ; it challenges inspection near or remote ; it demands an immense plain and solitude.\" —Forsyth. To visit the interior a permesso obtained either here, or at the Palazzo Reale at Naples is demanded (custode i lira, sacristan of chapel 25 c). The apartments have the usual mixture of splendour and gloom, which is the characteristic of great palaces, but here the gloom predominates, and the sove- reigns seem to have thought so, for they have scarcely ever inhabited Caserta. The columns of the theatre were plundered rom the temple of Serapis at Pozzuoli. The chapel contains a Presentation in the Temple by Mengs. \" If you wish to see specimens of all the marbles of this country collected in a short space, visit this palace. The stairs are formed of single blocks of the marble of Trapani, in Sicily, called LumacheUa, and at each landing are lions exquisitely sculptured, with numerous statues of allegorical figures. The sides are of the finest marbles, among which you see the choicest breccias of Dragoni, and the marbles of Vitulano in Principato Ulteriore. There are twenty-four Ionic pillars adorning the centre of the vestibule made of the red breccia of Mous Garganus in Apulia, and sixteen of the portico are of the yellow breccia of the same mountain.\" — C. /. Ramage. The Gardens (open to the public till Ave Maria), which trench upon the mountains, are of three kinds ; the Italian garden with its waterfalls and mythological statues ; the wood of the ancient Dukes of Caserta, which formed the feudal park ; and the English garden of Queen Caroline, with its greenhouses, cedars, tulip-trees, and magnolias. The magnificent waterworks are supplied by a winding aqueduct twenty-one miles in length called Ponte Maddaloni, which brings the water from the foot of Monte Taburno, near Airola. \" Quoique nouveau, cet aqueduc semble pouvoir se passer du temps ; il a le caractere et toute la majeste d'un ouvrage des Remains, et Ton pourrait tres bicn lui appliquer ce que Plutarque disait des monumens d'Athenes au temps de Pericles. Chacun d'eux des lors qu'il fut parfait, sentait deja son antique quant a la beaute.' ' — Valery. In the basins are kept gigantic bull-trout. The largest of the springs which supply the aqueduct is called Fizzo, the more abundant Fontana della Duca. Above Caserta is the little Palace of S. Leucio or Belvidere, with a pretty park, and an ilex forest full of game is beyond it. It is worth while to make an excursion from Caserta into the beautiful district of the Matese. The road crosses the Volturno to Cajazzo (8 miles), a considerable town with a large castle of the Florentine Corsi, which perhaps occupies the site of Calatia. \" Nee parvis aberat Calatia muris.\" 6\"t/. Ital. viii. 210. A tomb near the high-road is shown as that of A. Attilius Calatinus, a general distinguished in the First Punic War, whose epitaph is given by Cicero. The road again crosses the Volturno before reaching (11 miles) Alife, on the site of AUifae of the Samnites, of which there are considerable remains. The walls AVERSA 19 form a rectangular parallelogram with gates in tlie centre of each side protected by bastions, and the lower portions of the walls are ancient. Two miles farther is Piedimonte, in a pictur- esque situation at the foot of the Matese, with a fine castle of the Dukes of Lorenzano. In the neighbouring Val d 'Inferno is the source of the Torano beneath a low natural arch. Piedi- monte is the best point for the ascent of the Matese, of which the highest peak, Monte Mileto is 6740 ft. high. In the plain at the summit is a lake, said to be fathomless in the centre. Maddaloni (20,100 inhabitants) is a clean town with balustrades and orange groves, and the ruins of three feudal castles on the hill above it. The brother of a (Caraffa) Duke of Maddaloni fell a victim during the Masaniello Revolution, and his carriage was used by Masaniello's wife and mother when they paid their first visit of ceremony to the vice-queen. The palace of dukes is now a college. Maddaloni is the best point from whence to make an excursion in search of the disputed site of the Caudine Forks (Furculae Caudinae), which some place between S. Agata dei Goti cind Airola, a narrow tract watered by the brook Isclero, which fadls into the Voltumo (a romantic little valley quite incapable of containing the 30,000 men of the Roman army) ; and for which others indicate a vaUey three miles wide, which is entered close to Arienzo. Only the most far-reaching imagination can make any site in this neighbourhood agree with the account in Livy, which describes a plain traversed by a stream and surrounded on aU sides by lofty cUfis, only penetrated by a narrow passage at each extremit>'. Here, when the Roman army, on its march from Calatia to Luceria, had entered, it is said that they found the passage of exit filled up by stones and trunks of trees. Return- ing, they found their retreat blockaded in the same way, and, after being pent up for two days, were obhged to submit to the conditions of the Samnites, and stripped, scourged, and insulted, were let out one by one, being made to pass under a yoke to mark their disgrace.
