        "text": "7522: Hypnos. Bronze head of Hypnos, 4C BC. Copy at Axel Munthe's Villa San Michele, Capri.\n\nHypnos, who some say is the god that is dearest to the MUSES, is Sleep and Dream. He is the younger brother of Thanatos (Death), and Nyx (Night) is the nurse of both.\n\nSleep resembles Death\n\nIt has been ordained that Hypnos and Thanatos should have all things in common. Hypnos, the younger, imitates the other in everything. He had been surnamed \"The Bountiful,\" for this is the god who puts cares to flight, and soothes the bodies of both mortals and immortals. He can fashion shapes that seem to be true forms, and in his art he receives help from his sons.\n\nThe abode of Hypnos\n\nHypnos, they say, has his abode within a hollow mountain in Cimmeria, which is to the north of the Black Sea. In this place, silence and twilight shadows reign, and from the bottom of the cave there flows the stream of Lethe (Oblivion), whose murmuring waves invite to slumber. Before the entrance, where poppies bloom, there are also countless herbs which cause somnolence. Hypnos himself lies with heavy eyelids on a high couch of ebony in the cavern's central space, surrounded by empty dream-shapes, which mimick many forms.\n\nSons of Hypnos\n\nMorpheus is a cunning imitator of the human form, skilled in representing the features and the speech of men in dreams, as well as the clothing and the accustomed words of each he represents. Phobetor is the one who represents the forms of beasts, or birds, or serpents, in men's dreams; and Phantasus is in charge of putting deceptive shapes of earth, rocks, water, trees, or other lifeless things in the dreams of men.\n\nHypnos' wife\n\nHera promised Hypnos to give him Pasithea 2 (one of the CHARITES) as a bride if he would help her to let Zeus fall asleep. This he did in spite of his fears; for once before he performed a similar task, also at Hera's request. But Zeus woke up in anger and sought Hypnos everywhere, and the god would have hurled him from heaven into the deep, had Nyx not saved him. For also Nyx is a powefurl goddess, who prevails over both gods and men.\n\nIris 1 asks for service\n\nAlso Iris 1 came to Hypnos, sent by Hera, to ask him fashion a shape resembling Ceyx, which appearing before Ceyx's wife Alcyone 2, would inform her of her husband's death.\n\nOniros"
