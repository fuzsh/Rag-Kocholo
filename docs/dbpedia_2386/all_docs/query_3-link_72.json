The support provided by these mattresses is beneficial for reducing or eliminating joint pain while you sleep. Additionally, an orthopaedic mattress helps you maintain proper spinal alignment, strengthens the back muscles, and benefits your posture.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nBest Overall - Wakefit Grid Mattress\n\nThe XpertGRID by Wakefit features 3500+ airflow channels that use airflow to regulate the body's temperature. Its intelligently designed grid material also responds to pressure points on the body to provide a combination of medium firm & medium soft comfort for a restful night's sleep.\n\nThis mattress by the Sleep Company is a game-changer in the playground of premium mattresses! Elev8's Zero GMode allows users to sleep virtually weightless. As scientifically designed by NASA, keeping your head and legs raised in the Zero-G position relieves pressure on your spine.\n\nBest for back pain - Duroflex Back Magic\n\nThis amazing mattress from Duroflex has a Smart Orthopaedic Layer that adapts to your sleep demands based on the five zones of your body for personalised support and ideal spinal alignment, which is ideal for easing back pain.\n\nBest Lumbar Support - The Sleep Company SmartGRID Orthopedic Pro\n\nThe only mattress with the patented SmartGRID Technology that lessens pressure points while providing appropriate cradling and cushioning is SmartGRID, which is neither memory foam, latex, nor a spring mattress.

Back discomfort makes it difficult for one to fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night, while on the other hand, not receiving enough restorative sleep worsens the pain.\n\nCan a sleeping position cause back pain?\n\nBack pain may stem from sleeping in an unsupportive position since it puts more pressure on your spine. On your side, with a slight bend in your knee, is the ideal resting posture for lower back pain.\n\nTypes of Back Pain and What are the best positions for different types of back pain\n\nTypes of back pain:\n\nAxial pain- axial pain is localised to a single area or spot. Characterising it has several ways, including harsh or dull, comes and goes, persistent, or pulsating. A muscular strain, facet joints, and annular disc tears are frequent causes of axial back discomfort.\n\nReferred pain- Referred pain is frequently described as dull and achy and has the propensity to migrate and change location. For instance, degenerative discs in the lower back might transfer discomfort to the hips and back of the thighs.\n\nRadicular pain- Radicular pain, which travels along the course of the spinal nerve as it leaves the spinal canal, is sometimes described as electric shock-like or burning pain. Herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and spondylolisthesis are a few possible conditions that may cause it.\n\nBest (and worst) sleeping positions:\n\nLaying flat\n\nLaying flat on your back is the ideal position to prevent back pain. It is still the most difficult method for many people to get a good night's rest. Put a pillow under your head or neck and a second under your knees for the best spine alignment.\n\nOn the side: a capable runner-up\n\nThe second-best position for preventing back and neck problems is to sleep on your side with both legs straight. To keep your spine neutral, stretch your legs straight and tuck a cushion between your knees.\n\nOn your stomach\n\nThe worst posture for your spine while sleeping is on your stomach. Because it flattens your spine's natural curve, this position puts the most strain on its muscles and joints. However, if you can’t help sleeping in this position, try to put a pillow under your stomach for better spinal alignment.\n\nWhat types of mattresses are good for back pain\n\nMemory foam or latex foam mattresses are best for back pain aid. These help in proper spinal alignment, blood circulation, and pain relief by evenly dispersing the body's weight.\n\nIs a soft or firm mattress better for back pain?\n\nIn general, heavier individuals favour firmer mattresses. Soft foams could be too prone to sinking in for adequate comfort. Lighter people prefer soft to medium-firm mattresses because they tend to sink in less and find firm beds uncomfortable.\n\nHow to Pick a Mattress for Back Pain\n\nFirmness- A overly firm mattress while you sleep, might lead to pressure point aches and pains. For more comfort, patients who want a firmer mattress for back support might get one with more padding.\n\nSupport- A good mattress should support the spine's normal curvature and alignment. Additionally, the right amount of back support aids the patient in avoiding morning muscle soreness.\n\nPressure relief- An exceptionally soft mattress does not offer the support your body requires. In contrast, a tough mattress can cause additional strain on pressure areas like the neck, back, and shoulders. This is why medium-firm ones are the best for pressure relief.\n\nMaterial- Study the benefits of the mattress's components before you purchase an orthopaedic mattress to relieve pain.\n\nSize- Invest in a mattress that enables you to stretch out, flip on your side, and roll over without contacting the edge or waking up your partner.\n\nBrand reputation- Consider the mattress retailer's customer support, including delivery alternatives, warranty, removal of old mattresses, and return policies. Find mattress brands allow consumers to exchange mattresses if unsatisfied with the quality.\n\nSeek professional advice- Consult a physician or an orthopedist if you have severe back pain to find out what's wrong. Additionally, you should consider it if you have a chronic illness before purchasing a mattress.\n\nTips on how to take care of a mattress to increase its life\n\nRotate it- We advise regularly turning the mattress from head to foot to uniformly break in the sleeping surface and prevent the one-bed area from becoming softer.\n\nUse mattress protectors- Mattress protectors act as a barrier, preventing impurities like moisture, sweat, dust mites, and dirt from getting inside the mattress.\n\nDon’t bend it- A mattress or box spring almost certainly contains an internal border wire that is not intended to be bent unless constructed completely of soft material or designed specifically for folding.\n\nAllow it to breathe- Remove the linens and let your bed air out completely. Allowing your mattress to breathe can keep odours from building up.\n\nDon’t overload it- To ensure the mattress is supported, replace broken box springs, frames, or other support structures. This will avoid breaking and bowing due to overload.\n\nAvoid jumping on it- Jumping or standing up in bed might place too much weight on one mattress area, irreversibly damaging it.\n\nKeep it clean- Even with extreme caution, eating or drinking in bed can result in spillage. Avoid doing this, as it can cause odours to linger and result in mould and other infestations.\n\nBest in India\n\nWakefit's 3300*+ air channel XpertGRID is intelligently designed for optimal cooling even on the warmest nights.
