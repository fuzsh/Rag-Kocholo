        "text": "This year's hotly anticipated Galway Races are getting underway and things are already off to an exciting start long before the starting gates open.\n\nAdvanced ticket sales for the festival had \"exceeded expectations\" in June compared to the same time last year and it's clear that Ballybrit will be absolutely bustling this week.\n\nUnfortunately for one top jockey however, he'll be on the sidelines for the big event after an injury left him unable to compete.\n\nSean Flanagan took a knock after he came off Hard Target at Killarney last week and despite initially thinking it was a run-of-the-mill fall, he realised he'd broken a metacarpal bone and would need an operation to put it right.\n\n\"It looks like I’m going to be out for around five to six weeks, which unfortunately means I’m going to miss the Galway Festival,\" the Wexford jockey said.\n\n\"This is obviously hugely gutting news. Galway is a meeting I always look forward to each summer, but it is what it is, and I’ll just have to take it on the chin.\"\n\nHe added that it was \"a massive shame\" to miss such a high-profile racing outing.\n\nIn other racing news this week, punters have been turning their eye to trainer Harry Fry's horse 'In Excelsis Deo' who will be competing in Wednesday’s Tote Galway Plate.\n\nThe six-year-old is the 6-1 joint-favourite with Paddy Power alongside the JP McManus-owned Perceval Legallois. McManus also owns In Excelsis Deo so it's set to be a good race for him either way.\n\nIn Excelsis Deo had twice been placed at Cheltenham, an achievement which led Fry to decide to run him at Galway this week.\n\nThe veteran trainer said that he's aware the horse is in for a challenge but he has a nice profile for the race."
