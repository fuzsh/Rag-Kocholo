It is the first object <.f Etruscan antiquity which lias been discovered in that region. It ditfers from ordinary Etruscan mirrors in being perfectly Hat, like the mirrors of Greece and Egypt, instead of concave; and .qso in displaying in the figures incised on it, not a subject from the Greek mytliology, as usual, but a scene ol native and rural life. It exhibits, in fact, a rustic dance beneath a portico. A woman clad in transparent drapery, like the nymphs in tlie painted tombs of Corneto, and wearing a pointed tutidus, and large disk- (MUTings, is dancing to her partner opposite, when another man from behind suddenly seizes her round the waist. Other women are looking on. In front a man sits on the ground, holding a dog by a rope attached to his collar, and tlireatening him with a stick. Below the dancers is an inscription in Etruscan cliaracters, which resembles the curious epitaphs on the tombs at Orvieto, ‘‘ Mi . Ma . lkna . lartiiia . ruRUirENAS.”'*^ The last case contains numerous little figures ot deities and T.ares, some Boman, but many genuine Tnscanica sif/na, to be <listinguished by their archaic and often grotesque character. Some are as rudely^ misshapen as those from the Nuraghe of Sardinia, or the eafl}^ sepulchres of Malta ; others are fearfully elongated ; others have all the Egyptian rigidity, especially the females, many of wdiom, with one foot slightly in advance of the other, are holding out their gowns with one hand as if preparing for the dance, in the peculiar attitude whicli characterizes the Spes and the Nemesis of the Homans. Certain of these figuies are from Arezzo ; some from Bibbona in the T uscan Alaremma ; and some from Adria, at the mouth ol the Po. I must not omit to notice two archaic damsels in fetid limestone, from Chiusi, very similar to the Proserpine in the Museum of that town, who mount guard over the inner door of this chamber. I recognised them as formerl}’^ in the Ottieri collection at Chiusi.

In this fragment are two conduits or sewers — square openings, with projecting sills, as at Fiesole, ten or twelve feet from tire ground.^ The fifth fragment is also fine ; but the sixtli is very grand — forty feet in heiglit, and about one hundred and forty in length ; and here also open two sewers.”^ Tlie masonry is veiy irregular. A horizontal arrangement is preserved; but one course often runs into another, shallow ones alternate with deep, or even in the same course sevcnnl shallow blocks are piled up to equal the depth of the huger. The masses, though intended to be rectangular, are rudely hewn, and more rudely put together, with none of that close ‘‘kissing ' of joints, as the Italians say, or neat fitting-in of smaller j)ieccs, which is seen at Fiesole. This may be called a rectangular Cyclopean style, if that be not a contradiction in terms. Never- theless, it is essentially the same masonry as that of Fiesole ; hut here it is seen in its rudeness or infancy, while Fiesole shows its perfection. To the friability of the sandstone of which it is composed, is owing inucli of its irregular character, the edges of the blocks having greatly worn away ; while tlie walls of Ilesolo. being of harder rock, have sufiered less from the action of the elements. I air comparisons, however, can only be drawn between the walls on corresponding sides of the several cities ; for those which, face the south, like these fragments under Santa Cliiara, are always tound most afiected by the Aveather. As usual in the most ancient masonry, there are no traces of ceniont. In spite of the saying, Diiro con duro Non fa mai biion miiro, these gigantic masses have held together without it some tweiitv- five or thirty centuries, and may yet stand for as many nioitv All the fragments on this side of Volterra are mere embankments, as at Fiesole, to the higher level of the city.

From the heiglit of Iluselhe you look southward over tlie wido vale of the Ombrone, with the ruined town of Istia on the haiik'^ of that river; but (Irosseto is not visible, being concealed by the loftier heights of Moscona, which is crowned by the ruins of a circular tower.^’ On the east is a wooded hollow ; but on tlie north lies a wide bare valley, through which runs the road to Siena, and on the opposite heights stands the town of Batignaiio of proverbial insalubrity— ‘ ‘ Ihttkfnano fa la fonsa On tire west tlie valley widens out towards the great lake of Castiglione, the JjacuH Prdins, or of antiquity, which of old must have been as at present a mere morass, into whicdi several rivers dis- charge themselves ; but it had then an island in the midst, whieh is no longer distinguishable.'

Classicjjil Tour, I. p. .^>0. ^ This hike, or rather swamp, is called “ Aprilis,” by the Itineraries (see page 211). Cicero (pro Milone, 27) calls it ‘ ‘ Trelius,” and speaks of its ishind. Pliny (HI. 8) must mean the same when he mentions the “ amnes Prille,” a little to the north of the rmbro. These “amnes'’ seem to refer to several months or emis- saries to the hike. The island of which Cicero speaks is by some supposed to have been the hill of Radia al Fango, nearly two miles from the lake, but Repetti (IV. lu 10) considei-s it rjither to have l>een a little mound now called Badiola, on which arc still some remains of ancient buildings, and which he thinks in the time of CiiTO* may have stood in the midst of the mai^li, instead of hard by it, as Jit i>resent. It is impossible to Bay of what extent tiie lake was of old ; before the hydraulic operatiniis commenced in 1828 for its “ bonification, ’ <as the Italians term it, it had a superlicial extent of 83 square miles, but it is now reduced by the Jiieans taken, and still tjiking, for filling it up ; this is done iiy letting in the waters of the Ombnnie, whicli bring down abundant deposits from the interior. It would seem, from the forcible possession Clodius took of the island in its waters, as related by Cieem (loc. cit. ), tlmt this spot was much more desimble as a habitation in ancient times than at present, when it is “the very centre of the infection of the Tuscan Ma- remma.” Rej)etti gives good reasons for regjirding this lake or swamp as originally ■ 'the bed of the sea. An interesting account will be found in the same writer (II. <Irosseto) of the attempts made at various periods and by different means to retluce the extent of stagnant water, and lessen the unhealthine of this district. (HVP I-] ORIGIN OF POLYGONAL MASONRY. 257 lerrulav hodomon of the Greeks, nor the opus ratiadatinn of the limiiaiis has it more strongly marked. I could as readily believe tliat the Corintliiau capital was invented by every nation by which it lias been adopted, as that this style of masonry had an in- depeiident origin in every country where it has been found.^ The question next arises, to wliat particular race is this peculiar iiiasoiiry to be ascribed. No doubt when once introduced, the fisliiou might be adopted by other tribes tlian that which origi- nated it,\" hut the type, whose source alone we are considering, would still he proper to one race. Now at the risk of being thought to entertain old-fashioned opinions, I must confess that I can refer it to no other than the Pelasgi. Not that, with Sir W. (hdl, I would cite the myth ol Tjycaon, son of IVdasgus, and tV)uiider of Lycosura, as proof that this masonry was of Pelasgic origin^ — f might even admit that ‘‘there is no conclusive evidence in any one iiistam^e of the Pelasgian origin of the monuments niider consideration ” ^ — yet there is, in most cases, the same kind and degree of evidence as lead us to ascribe the walls of Fiesole and Volterra to the Pltruscans, those of Ihestum to the (inu'ks, or Stonehenge to tlie J)rui<ls.

The rock is a sort of sandstone, which will not take a very fine surface, and therefore hardly allows of a liifth finish or of much force of colour. The figures are in a band about twenty-two inches deep, whicli ^iirrouiuls the chamber as a frieze. They are twenty-six in number, and are divided into two subjects, banquets and games, l),.th having a funereal reference. On the portion of the frieze facing you as you enter, are the pahestric games. 'To the right (if the central door is a race of three hifirc.

By the side of each chariot is a tree, or what in the con- V( iitional system of the Etruscans was intended to represent such, tliough to our eyes it is more like a tall bullrusli, or a paddle stuck into the ground, the stick being painted red, and the blade bright blue.

Next, a naked man, whose attitude may remind you of the celebrated dancing Faun at Naples, is boxing with an imaginary opponent,^ to the sound of the double-pipes plaved i)v a boy behind him. A woman follows, dancing to the same miisie and to the castanets which she rattles herself. Her flesh is of tlm same red hue as that of the men around her. She is draped witli red bodice, yellow transparent gown, and a white cldamys or scarf on her shoulders, and wears red sandals; and in attitude as well as costume is very like the dancing-girls in the tombs of Tanpiinii.^ She is followed by another suhido ; and then by a naked youth with crested Greek helmet, round shield, and wavy spear, leapiiui from the earth as if practising an armed dance, such as tlw ancients were accustomed to perform. ^ The last figure is a naked man, exercising himself with halteres, or, iii plain Englisli, usiii*^ the dumlvbells, which, with the ancients, served the same purt)ose as with US.’ ® This figure seems at first to be beating nothing })ut tlic air with his hands, and time with his feet ; but that he is a imgilist is rendered evident by a precisely similar figure in tlic Depo.sito dc* Dei, who lias an opponent. lie lias no cestnn, though one fist is closed.

But as Athenicus (XIV. 28, 29) informs us that the PyiThic dance was performed hy armed boys, and that at Sparta, where alone in his day, the dance was kept up, all boys above five years old were taught to dance it, a.s it was practised in preparation for w'ar, we are authorised to believe' that when women were represented as performers it must liave been in Imrlesipie. The prohaltility then is tliat the jyyrrlilchistea depictei] in this tornl) w'as intended for a male. That the Etruscans had armed dniiccs is jiroveil, not only hy tJicir jiainted tomh^, but by other monuments, e.g. a silver gilt vc.s.sel in very archaic style found at Chiusi. Dempster, I. tab. 78 ; Inghir. Mon. Ktru.s. HI. tav. 19. Miiller (Etrusk. IV. 1 , 7) Is of opinion that the Etruscan who formed an c.ssential part of th'* pageantry of the circus, danced amusl, because they are comj)arcd by Valerius Maximu.s (11. 4, 3) to the Curctes. Ami the armed dances of the Salii in honour of iMars, which according to one tradition (8erv. ad .En. VIII. 285) were of Veientino institution, Miiller would refer to an Etrus- can origin. The figure, however, in tliis painted tomb can have no relation to the Salii, who, as described by Plutarch (Xuinal, danced in purple robes, with brass belts, helmets, sworefs, and brass bucklers of a peculiar form, which are represented on a singular Etruscan gem in the Utfizj Museaim at Florence, where the iSalii are carrying ancilia in procession.

Half of the frieze in this chamber being devoted to games, the otlier half is pictured with the banquet. Here are flte couches, eadi hearing a pair of figures, all males, young and beardless, Imlf'draped, and crowned with blue chaplets. The absence of tlio fair sex shows this to be a sijmposium, or drinking-bout. The gestures of the revellers, animated and varied, betray the rxhilarating iiiHuencc of the rosy god. One holds a chaplet, jinotlier a ilower, a third a branch, apparently of myrtle, and st veral have jkdene, which the slaves are hastening to replenish. The whole goes forward to the music of the double-pipes. Eacli vouth lies under a separate coverlet, and the colours of the cloths )iie contrasted with each other, and wuth their own borders. 'I’hc couches themselves are draped with white, spotted with hlnck crosses. Beneath each is the usual hjjpopodiumy or ^foot- stool, here resting on lions’ paws. At one end of the scene stiiiids a tripod with a large triple Iches, or basin, of red earth, ( ither a wine-cooler, or containing the beverage, mixed to the l):dates of the revellers ; and a naked slave is busied at it, re- plenishing wine-jugs. A second figure, who, with arm uplifted, is giving the slave directions — Deprome, o TJi(ili(ircJie, ineniin diotd!'^ — is evidentl}\" the butler; and the patera (j]] suspended on the wall marks this corner as his pantry. ^ ll Should curiosity be excited as to the costume of butlers ill Italy some two or three-and-twenty centuries since, I iinist reply that this Etruscan worthy is ‘'in leathers,” // as the Spaniards say, thougli not in biifi*, chamois, or // ccrdovaii. I f)ne of the slaves in this scene holds a cullender, j ' 1 with a handle bent into a hook, for the purpose of sus- / l»'‘iisi()ii oil the rim of the wine- vessel. This is the simi-ui.i m. <’thfn()s, hijUsterj or cohiiii, for straining the wine into the cup, and was generally of bronze. The sinipalain, or ladle, lu ally resembled it in form, the bowl being at right angles with ' XIV. 40 ; Juv. Silt. VI. 421 ; Seneca, XV. 4; LVL ; rollux, X. c. 17. ‘''' luca says they were of ^ead.

A .simil.ar tripod with basins is shown on a bas-relief from Cbiusi, representing the funeral feast and dance.s, in very archaic style (Micali, Mon.

The inner chamber is of smaller dimensions, with a bench of rock on two sides. It has also a frieze of figures, here only i\\nil teen inches higli— a chorus of youths, fourteen in all ; one witli a jyttera, another with a chaplet, a third has the double-pipes, anil a fourth a lyre, by which to regulate the dance. All are viakeil with the exception of a light chlamjjs on tlieir shoulders, or i^uiai the waist.^ The natural interpretation of these scenes is that they repre- sent the funeral rites of the Etruscans. Thougli some antiquaik s have attached a symbolical meaning to them, I see no reason why ^they should ifot represent tlie feasting, music, dances, and pahestric games, actually held in honour of the dead.^ Jt is possible that tliey may be at once descriptive and symbolical. Ibis is a point on which evoiy one is at liberty to hold his own oinnion. The figures in these paintings are generally outlined with black or red. Tlie colours are hardly so well ])reserved as in tliose of Parquinii ; the blues and whites are the most vivid. Yet all have been seriously injured. Let the visitor have a care * This cJilamija may he introducetl merely for the sake of the colour j as it varies — red, black, blue, and white, in successimi. For variety’s sake also, these li^^ures are made to alternate with trees, ail painted l)Iack, both stems and foliage, and not paddle-shaped, like those in the outer chamber, but branching out with more nature and freedom than usual in Etruscan tombs. Some of these figures are painted red, others are merely sketched on the wall, with black or red outlines — carbonc ant rubricA picti. All have been carelessly scratched in before being coloured ; and the artist has not always adhered to his outline, which in some cases has evidently been retouched. * I may adtl to what has been sUted elsewhere (Vol. I. pp. 323, 374), that Inghirami regards such scenes as “ an apotheosis of virtuous souls” — i. e., that the figures in these scenes do not represent the survivors, thus expressing their sorrow for the dead, but symbolise the souls of the dcj)artetl, depicted in the enjoyment of sensual jilcasures, because the ancients lia^l no other way of representing the (l(?liglil.s of Elysium. In truth, some of them con- sidered that the highest rewards the g<Kls (vnild bestow on the virtuous in anotlicr life was an eternity of intoxicaition. JMus;eus, ap. Flat, llcpub. II. p. 3t)3, dl. Stei>h. Inghirami thinks such an inter- pretation the more a^ipropriato to tlie scenes in this tomb, because the usual tables for food being wanting, the figures are drinking, not eating ; and souls in bliss would be served with nectar alone. Ann. Inst. 1835, p. 22. But this difference merely indicates a drinking-bout in.stcad of a regular meal — a si/mpoaion, not a dcipnon. In either case it may be a funeral fcjust, iu its late, rather’ than early stage. In the trees of the dancing-scene in the inuer chamber, he sees the “fortunata nemora, .and the “ luci opaci” of the Elysiau regions (Virg. JEu. YI. 639, 073), ami further quotes vV||^iL (JEn.

Other figures of huntsmen, dogs, and wild beasts, all prostrate in the midst of a wood, together with two other chariots, were seen in this tomb when first opened, but they soon faded from its- walls.

Even in the plan, number and arrangements of the chambers, these sepulchres exactly corresponded. Unfortunately the Deposito de' Dei had suffereil so much injury; the suiface of the wall had flaked off to such an ■ extent, that it was considered useless to continue to keep it under lock and key, and it was accordingly closed a few years since, and the urns it contained were transferred to the IVIusea Civico of Chiusi. A description of this tomb, as it was, is given in the Appendix to this Chapter, Note I. Deposito belle Monache. Not far from the sepulchre de’ Dei, and about a mile and a half from Chiusi, to the north-west, in a hollow, called Val d’Ac(pia, was the Tomb of the Nuns,^’ so called, not from containing the ashes of ancient religious virgins — Etruscaji civilisation, so far as we can learn, never having encouraged voluntary celibacy in either sex — but from being in the grounds of the nunnery, of Santo Stefano. It was a vaulted chamBer of small size, rudely hollowed in the rock, and unpainted ; pos- sessing no interest beyond the preservation of its monuments, just as they were discovered — two sarcophagi, for iiiiburnt bodies, and a number of cinerary urns, of alabaster and travertine ; but these have all eitlier been sold, or transferred to the Etruscan Museum at Florence, and the tomb is now reclosed. These sepulchral monuments proved, by the epitaphs they bore, that this sepulchre belonged to the family of \"‘‘-Umrana.’' Ihis is an interesting fact, for in this word we recognise the name of Umbria ; and it is confirmatory of the historical record of the early relations betw^U that country and this city of Clusium.^ ^ This tomb was discovered in 1820 , by some clairvoyant peasant, The last syllable of Umrana is but the Vipina.

Ihit the fact loses much of thf marvellous when it is recollected that the discovery of tombs around Chiusi is of every-day occuiTenco ; the neighbourhood being so full of them, that on any spot a man inioht select, h§ 'fould probably meet with traces of ancient sopultare. But suchvis ‘/the stuff that dreams are made of’* in Itulv, where the low^er orders place implicit faith in them, and cuiisult soothsayei’s and somnipatent books for tlie interpretation thereof. In lottery matters, dreams are the Italian’s oracles. Before purchasing a ticket he tries to dream of *^buoni numcri or if no numbers enter into his visions, the circumstances of the (Iroiun determine its character, and the phantasmagoria of his somnolent hours are translated into numerals. In 186 G a tomb was opened at the Colic, near the Tenuta Casuccini, which had figures painted on its walls. It was a single cliamber of small size, closed, instead of a door, witli three large tiles, two of which bore Ktrnscan inscriptions. On eaeli side-wall of the tomb was painted in black, whether merely in outline it does not appear from the description we liave of them, a figure, on one side a man, on the opposite, a woman, holding a bowl, from which she seemed to be pouring a libation. Near her was drawn a bird, apparently a croAV, The male figure stood in tlie midst of an Etruscan inscription of four lines — the epitaph, it appeared, of the man dejiicted on tlie Avail, Avhich corresponded with the inscription on one of the tiles, and also Avitli tliat on a < inerary urn in the tomb, Avhich probably contained the ashes ol this gentleman. A similar agreement existed betAveen the iiiscri])- tion attached to the female figure on the Avail, that on the other tile Avith which the entrance Avas closed, and one on a second einerary urn. The inscriptions seemed to mark the figures as laan and Avife, he being of the family of ‘‘ Tiuza,” she of that of “Heriune” (Herminius). The tomb is now closed.^ to fiiul traces of that connection in the names of families, which, among the Etnis- as among other nations, were often ‘leiived from regions, citie*l, rivers, &c. ; and the discovery of a family-name of this (“haracter at Chiusi is corroborative of tho historical record. It may be further oh- ^erved that tho appellation Livy (IX. 36) attaches to tho foreign kindred of tho Cam«5it^ilto*nhri,’’ has its <=<iuWaleiit in this in one of the epitaphs the names arc coupled together — “Pluvstia Umranci Curnerunasa” — which, dive.sted of the adventitious terminations, would l)e— Uiiira Cumere. On an urn in the Musco Casuccini the very word Umbria, expifessed as well as it can bo in tho Etrus- can, which has no B, occurs as a family name — “Larthia Umria Puia.” * Conestabile, Bull.

It contained seven chambers, full of urns, the fruit of excavations made in tlie neighbourhood, which have now been transferred to the Miiseo Civico. In the cliff hard by have been discovered many urns in niches, covered with tiles. Near this, a tomb was discovered in 1837, having two figures of the Etruscan Charun, as large as life, sculptured in higli relief in the doorway, and armed with hammers as if to guard the se- pulchre against violation. Unfortunately this tomb has been reclosed.^ Tomba della Scimia. In the Poggio Ihaizo, or La Pellegrina, an oak-covered liill, about a mile from Chiusi to the north-east, a tomb was discovered ill March, 1810, by Signor Francois, which was decorated with l)aintings of very early date, and singular interest. It is generally i designated the '' Monkey-Tomb.” This sepulchre since its discoveiy lias been reopened and re- closed twice, but in 1870, I found it still preserved under lock and key. In form and arrangement it bears a resemblance to llie other painted tombs, but has four chambers, all surrounded by rock-hewn benches, carved to resemble banqueting-couches. 1 he central chamber is surrounded by a band of figures, thirty inches high, representing pahestric games. The only spectator is a lady, with a red mantle on lier head, sitting beneath the shade of an umbrella, just like those of modern times, and indica- tive, it is probable, of her rank and dignity.\" Her foot-stool is reliefs from the ruins of Nineveh, and the coast of Lycia, now in the British Museum, satisfactorily attest. So also Pei'siau kiiii,'s are represented in the reliefs of Persepoli;^. ^ The proudest tropl^ nf the Gallic arms in Africa was the uiBj>r^lla Of Abd-el-Kader, till he himself shared its fate ; though he was soon avenged by his victor being com- pelled to abandon his in a far ignobler manner. Umbrellas preserved the com- plexion of “ the fair-cheeked” Helen, and sheltered many a fair one of Greece and Rome from Phoebus* gaze, as we leani from ancient vases, bas-reliefs, and paintings. An nmbrella was introduced into the only Gre«^ainted tomb, of which we have record,^, I^Tritcea in Ach®a, fo^ ^ Ann. List. 18117, 2, p. 2.58. * Bi-aun takes this huly to represent the spectators in general. Umbrellas and jiarasols be it remembered, arc as old iis the sun and rain. Though of comiiaratively modern introduction into England, they were well-known in the olden time. In the East the umbrella ha« been used from time immemorial, ^though chiefly by the great ; and jiroud^^ the ' ■oriental despot who can style “ llrotlior of the Sun and Moon, of the Umbrella,” Assyrian moi stood beneath its shade while homage from their vanquished foes ^ and Lycian princes sat under .such shelter while directing the siege of a hostile city ; as the CONTENTS.

[ii front of her is a decorated inclosure, probably intended to ^resent the orchestra, within, which stands a suhiilo blowing his • es for lier amusement ; and\" outside stands a woman, in yellow icket and red gown and with a string of large brown beads . lossed on her bosom, as the she-demons wear their bands, who l.ilaiices a lighted candclahmm on her head. There are other iiiiisicians also — a minstrel with his lyre, and a trumpeter with ■1 long Iiorn, of the peculiar lituus-\\ike form, which was an Ktniscan invention.^ I'here is also a race of three bu/cCf so often represented in tlicse painted tombs of Chiiisi, and the hmheutcs or umpire stands in front ready to bestow a palm-branch on the victor. I’nder the horses’ feet lie bundles in net-work, wliich may be intended for skins of oil, the usual prizes in such contests, often introduced into representations of ancient chariot-races ; thougli lit re they have been supposed to be obstacles of some sort, tlirown inirposely under the chariots in order to upset them, — lair play on tin* turf being no better understood in those early days than at I'l’cscut, — and this view is borne out by the figure (jf a boy behind the liorses in the foremost who appears to be setting a large deg at tliem to make them swerve from their course. In otlier jiurts of tlie chamber are two other pairs of horses — one ridden bv a groom, the other by a man with a javelin and by a boy with :i bow — tlie riders in both instances being seated sideways, as horsemen are often represented on Ktruscan monuments. See the woodcut at p. 333.^ The steeds are black, red, or white, and although not of perfect forms, are not deficient in spirit. (VIT. 22, G) describes a beautiful ''Hiiig l.ulv sittin<» on an ivory throne, as 'It'l'i' trd on its walls, sheltered by an 'nnhrella held by a niaid-scrvant over licr head. Umbrellas were borne by the 'iion, ‘Ls well as by the, Maids of Athens in tlietUysof Pericles (Aristoph. Eqiiit. 1348; Thosmuph. 823, 829; Aves, 1508, 1550) ; ‘h I Roman gallants were wont to prove thf-ir devotion by holding them over their J'^i^tresses. Ovid. AH. Amat. II. 209. Mart. XI. ep. 73. In this tomb of bliiiLsi we have proof that they were used in Ktrnria also. Yet though an umbrella. ^ shadowed the rich cheek of Cleopatra, and softened the glow ofAspasia’s charms, in London, the centre ofj^dern civilisation, a century since, Jonab Hanway was ridi- (*nled for candying one through tlie streets. 3 Tliis is not the circular triinij)et or cornu represented in the Tomha Oolini, at Orvieto (ut naptay p. 55), and on the urns of Voltcrra (p. 188), hut it is curved ;it the end like n pedum y or litiius ; and is of that description designated by the latter name.

Dwarfs and monke3's are associated in our minds ; and apparently in those of the Etruscans. Here, amid the athkue sits an ape chained to the stump of a tree, from which new- branches are sprouting. He has -no apparent relation to the scene, and it may bo that, like the dwarfs, he is introduced to lill an awkward space under the projecting lintel of a door.^ All tlie figures on this wall are shown in the woodcut on page 338. It is impossible not to be struck with the mediieval character of much of this scene. It requires no great exercise of the imagination to see a castle-yard in the days of chivalry. 'J’iiere is the warder witli his horn, the minstrel with his lyre, tlie knight in armour, the nun witli her rosary, the dwaifs and monke}^— and even some of the other figures would not he out of place. Yet the style of art, hearing a resemblance to that of tlic earliest tombs at Corneto, proves this to have been one of the most ancient of the painted tombs of Chiusi, and four or fivt* centuries before the Christian era. Below the figures is a band of tlie meander fret. Above tlicin is a cornice tiainted witli the egg and tongue pattern, and on it tio each wall is a female head with dishevelled hair. The inner chamber has onW two (igures painted ; a boy on each side-wall, — one holding a flask of wine or oil; the other a bill-hooked lance. Like the outer cliaml>er this has a sepulchral couch hewn from the rock ; but in one corner a square mass is left, which would liardly be intelligible, were not the arm of a chair painted on the wall above it, indicating its analogy to tlio curule chairs in the tombs of Cervetri.' Tlie arm in this case repres^ts a spotted snake. In the recessed coffer in the ceiling were painted four ivy leaves, and in the cdpiws as many Sirens, each with long dis- hevelled hair, and hands to her bosom as if beating it in grief, and with two pliirs of wings, like the Cherubim of the Jews. The se^c^^ of the figures in this tomb are as usual distin- guished by their colour; the males being a strong red, the females white. Many figures were first scratched in, then drawn with strong black outlines^and filled up with colour. Some of them show th^t the artist ipdf several attempts before he could draw the form to his satisfePron. , ® Dr. Braun (Ann.

In this tomb, he says, ‘‘we find true Etruscan portraits, .,11(1 distinguish the various characters of the individual figures ; the lady who presides at the games being represented as noble jind dignified ; the men on horseback, active and graceful ; the pjirrliK'liistcs^ bold and proud ; the luigilists, coarse and almost hc^stial.” - Dr. Brunn, on the other hand, does not consider these ])aintings to be of great antiipiity, or even to belong to tlie period of advanced archaicism. They have a certain rudeness ;aid rusticity, which is not so much a sign of antiquity, as the mark of the individual artist or school, and must not be con- founded with the true characteristics of archaic art, which are liere wanting. He admits, however, the true Etruscanism of the style, so entirely opposed to the princiiiles of Groidv art, and liased on tliose of realism ; for the artist would not subject liiinself to the laws of any particular style, but his aim was evidently to represent people as tlu^y appear to the eye in the reality of cominon life. In this he recognises an independent .hIiooI of art, which may la}\" claim to bo called national.^ ^car the “Monkey-Tomb,’* another was opened at the same time, also containing three chambers, one of which was painted witli tlie scene of a hare-hunt, a rare subject in Etruscan tombs, though the Grotta dei Cacciatori at Corneto has a scene of soiiKuvliat similar character.^ The art in this tomb was very Ulterior, and its walls so much dilapidated, that it was not thouglit worthy of being kept, open for public inspection, and was therefore reclosed. Hard by these tombs a remarkable circular well or shaft has been recently discovered, sunk to a great deptli in the hill, and having window's at intervals ox)ening into tombs, of which there supposed to be several stories, j|ut the well has not yet been hilly excavated.

Near the summit of Poggio Kenzo, and not far from tlie ''Monkey-Tomb,” was opened, in 1874, a scipiilchre, whose avails were painted with animals in the most archaic style. The fi^mres were almost as large as life, and represented lions, panthers, hears, gritfoiis, sphinxes, all winged, and depicted in threateniiur attitudes, or devouring their prey, and among them a goose, so often introduced, as if for contrast, among similar ferocious beasts and cliiimeras, on the vases of the First, or so-called Idue- nician, style. The outlines were scratched on the wall, and tlie figures were all bichromatic, black and red, painted on the smoothed surface of the yellow rock, which was se)ne with quaint conven- tional rcjiresentations of leaves and flowers, as in those very archaic vases. Indeed the decorations of this tomb seemed hut faithful copies, on a magnified scale, of the figures on some vases of that early period ; and that they had a corresponding anti(|uity there could be no (question, for though the sepulchre had been rifled in past ages, a relic of its original furniture was left in a homhylios in the same archaic style. There can be no doubt that this was one of the earli(‘st painted tombs yet found in Ftriiria, although we may hesitate to regard its decorations as works of Etruscan art ; and it is to be regretted that it is no longer oymi for%ispection.~ On the hill-slope behind the Tomba della Scimia, is a tomb opened many^ years since, but wliicli contains one of the lew Etruscan inscriptions discovered on tins site, graven or painted on the rock. It is cut over a large body-niche in the inner chanib^ as in tlu' tomb by the Ponte 4'errano, at Civita Castcl- lana. ' The inscription is legible, but does not appear to be a jiroper i:^me. Tliis same Poggk|J^Uzo, when further explored in 1872, was found to contain Earliest necropolis of Chiusi. Near its summit opened a number of little tombs, lying in three rows, utte^ luilike any yet described, being sunk, like shallow wells, to tlie^?ptl^f about a mfetre, and lined with pebbles and broken stones,- put^^^^liether without cement. •Each of them con- tained a single cinerary hucchero, from C to 14 inches lu height, of very rude I^Sraon, e,lthier entirely plain, dt* orna- mented with geometrical patterns, scratched on the clay ; and all of them had invariably one of their two handles broken.

Ill the pots of both kinds, the only articles found among tlio aslies of the deceased, were crescent-shaped razors of bronze, ami thill plates, almost square, of the same metal, with holes for a fiiiii^c, which were supposed to have been worn as ornaments ,,r insiffnia on the breast, and were of higher antiquity than the la/ers. 'riierc were also found a few , Hhul(e of bronze, some small cliains linked together, and an object somewhat resembling a Latin cross, all of the same metal ; but. no articles of gold, silver, ivory, or amber ; no. rings for the ears or fingers; and no timires, either of man or beast, either scratclied, or impressed, nil tlie pots which held the ashes, were discovered in these primi- tivr se])ulchres. In one instance alone, the lid of one of the pots liDio two figures embracing, which fornnul the handle, but so ruddy fasliioned were they, that they more nearly resembled a ( -iiiplo of bears hugging, than a pair of human beings.*^ Still further from the town in the same direction, or to the ]i()itli-east, lies the Lake of Chiusi, a piece of water about two '^(liinro miles in extent, and of no great beauty, yet heightening tli(' charms of the surrounding scenery. Though generally styled tli(‘ “ ('liiaro di Chius^” it is the muddiest lake I have ever seen; ;is golden in hue as the Tiber, the Tagus, or the Guadalquivir.

[cha).. i,,v. In a slope above tlie lake, nearly two miles from Chiusi is the Deposito dee Gran Duca or “ del Sovrano,” so called from lying in the property of th,. Crown. It is also known as the “ Camera della Pacoianese,\" as it lies immediately below the Podere, or farm, of that naine. I was startled t)n entering ; so unexpected was the sight. Yet the walls blazed not with gorgeous colours — no Bacchanals danced before me — no revellers lay on their couches no fttlihii/' contended in the ais|^a. All was colourless and sombre. But the tomb was vaulted’ over with a perfect arch of neat travertine masonry ; ® and on the benches around lay the urns exactly as they were found, undisturbed for more than tw’o thousand years. If other proof were wanting, this tomb would sufiice to show that the Ktruscans understood and practised the arch.® There are here eight urns of travertine, some without roenni- bent figures on their lids; and none with reliefs of great interest — Gorgdn’s heads, winged and snaked, among llowers or foliage -sea-divinities and winged Iniypocnutpi a between two pelta or haif-moon sliiclds ; the most striking is a male figure riding on a panther, though with none ot the attributes el Ihtcchus. 'The inscriptions, which are painted in red or black, show this 'to be the tomb of tlie Peris— one of the nobh; fannlics of ifclusium.^ The doorway of this tomb is worthy ol notice. It has a liiitc of a single stone, but abov^ that is a low arch of cuneilorm blocks springing from the masonry of the doorposts, which seems intro- duced to lessen the pressure of the superincumbent earth upon the hl^l, but is, in fact, the termination of the vault witbin.

About a mile or more to the west of Chiusi, in tin' Tognio delle Case, at a spot called 1 Pianacci, another painted tomh \\\\a> discovered in 1846, but soon afterwards tlie roof fell in and choked it, and the paintings were destroyed. This is much to be regretted, for in point of design the figures in this tomh had a decided superiority over every other yet discovered at Chiusi. A description of the paintings is given in the Appendix, Note II. In a hill near the Poggio Gajella, cjdled Poggio Paccianesi, or del Vescovo, because it is episcopal property, is a tomh with seven chambers, arranged like atriuni and frirVuiid, some ot which bear traces of paintings; but little is now to In* distin- guished beyond a pair of parti-coloured lions in one of tin' pedi- ments.

We arc apt to reganl Italy as a country so thoroughly beaten by travellers that little new can be said about it ; still less do we imagine ^at relics of the olden time can exist in the open air, and rem^ unknown to the world. Yet the Irutli is, that vast districts of the reninsiila, especially in the Tuscan, Homan, and Neapolitan States, are to the arclneologist a terra incofjnita* Every monument on the high-roads is familiar, even to the fire- side traveller; but how little is known of the by-ways ! Of tlie swarms of foreigners who yearly traverse the conntiy between Florence and Home, not one in a hundred leaves the beaten tracks to visit objects of antiquity; still fewer make a journey into the intervening districts expressly for such a purpose. How many leave the train to explore the antiquities of Cortona, Chiusi, or Orvicto ? or if a few run from Rome to Corneto to visit the painted tombs, not a tithe of that small number continue their route to Vulci, Toscaiiella, or Oosa. That wide region, on the frontiers of the fonner Tuscan and Roman States, which has been the subject of ^e last two chapter, is so rarely trodden by the foot of a traveller, even of an antiquary, that it can be no matter of surprise that relics of ancient art should exist there, and be utterly unknown to the world — gazed at with stdpid. astonishment by the peaiftintry, or else more stupidly unheeded.

So it was with the maguiiicent temples of rjestum. Though they had reared their mighty columns to -the sunbeams for some three and twenty centuries, isolated in an open jdain where they were visible for many a league, and stand- ing on tlie sea-shore, where they must liave served^ov ages as a landmark to tlie mariner ; yet their very existence had been for- gotten, till in the middle of the last century a Neapolitan painter discovered them afrc'sh, rescuing them from an oblivion of fifteen hundred years.^ So in Etruria, the interesting cemeteries of Norchia and Castel d’Asso were brought to light not seventy years ago by some sportsmen of Viterbo. I am now about to describe some other remarkable remains of Etruscan autiipiity, which owe their rediscovery to the inteliigeiit enti’rprise of an blnglishman. In the spring of 184f3, Mv, Aiusley, my former fellow-traveller in Etruria, in the course of a third tour thi'ough tliis interesting land, penetrated to Ihtigliano, and thence made an excursion to Sovana. Being aware that that place was known only as the site of the Roman Suana, he liad no reason to expect relics of Etruscan times ; yet, hanng cstablislied suc,h an antiquity for Pitigliano, ho shrewdly suspected the same for tlie neighbouring site. Here he inquired for antiquities. Antiquities ! — Nobody at Sovana had ever heard of sueh “ roba.” From the provost to the hind, all were alike ignorant. But his curiosity was excited by some coliunharia and roek-hewii tombs of familiar character, and he proceeded to explore the surrounding ravines. His suspicions were soon conrirmod. Here were tombs with rock-bewn facades as at Norebia and Castel d’Asso, — and, follow- ing the range of cliffs, he came to a monument in the form of a temple, in a style both unique and beautiful. His surprise and delight at this discovery explained to the villag(‘rs wlio accom- panied him the nature of the objects he was seeking. They were no less astonished Jo find a stranger display such interest in what to their simple minds was iticaninglcss, or a mere scherzo ” — a freak of Nature imitafing Art, or a ’fanciful work carved in an idle or wanton mood h.y the ‘‘rude forefatjfiers of the hamlet.’* ' I give the current stoiy, ■which I l)e- to the itfiintcr’s discovery, which was 17J>5. lieve. houever, to have Veen disproved as Sec l)eh*gardette, liuincs de Feustuin, p. 15. trcgaids the discoverer,— a dcsciiption of It is at least established tliat those marvels the temples having been puhiished at of Grecj^ art have been known to Kuro^x) Naples, by Antonini, in his ■v\\oik on Lu- for little niofc than a century, cauia, ten years before the date assigned PAINTEp TOMBS NOW BE-CLOSED. fUAl’. 3B5 - ,1 liii as an athlete, playing at •L)all with a boy, i.e.^ making the hoy his ha* he had one knee to the ground, with his hand raised as if to eateh tli«’ iay. whom he had tossed over his head.
