Her hair is cloud or pillow like and the wings are those of a Tawny Owl to further emphasise the theme of Sleep. The owl wing patination is of the Eastern Mediterranean tawny owl which are greyer than those of tawny owls in the UK, due to the drier climate.",

        "text": "All the sculptures on the website are described by the Artists themselves stating the materiel they are made from and their dimensions. If they are stated to be suitable for outdoors they have a guarentee of 10 years subject to the effects of weathering which will alter their colour and finish over the years unless you give them regular cleaning and maintenance. For instance Bronze and to a lesser extent bronze resin/cold cast bronze will aquire a green patina, usually rather sought after and all could attract moss lichen and a greeny pollen especially under trees which should be removed regularly with warm water and washing up liquid.\n\nIron and steel will oxidise(rust ) and this falls outside our guarentee.\n\nOrganic materiel like wood, bark willow is variable and depends to a great extent on where it is sited and you should discuss any guarentee direct with the Artist as this too falls outside our Guarentee.\n\nYou can either talk or correspond with Peter at ArtParkS prior to ordering or just click on the buy now button and follow the instructions adding in the delivery charge unless the Artist is offering it free.\n\nPayment can be made by Direct Debit, cheque, via credit or debit card, or Paypal though we try and avoid the latter because we have to forward the 5% they charge us on to you."
