        "text": "Fiona is a multi-media artist working in Bristol with painting, sculpture and jewellery making\n\nThis new work is part of our group project responding to the theme of Colour.\n\nDuring this exhibition cycle I have let my mind wander through ideas of visibility, opaqueness, perception, transparency, reflection and luminescence. Thinking about what I enjoy looking at and what I am drawn to, as well as how I perceive colours through all my senses. I have been inspired by the artists Odilon Redon, William Blake, Eric Ravilious and Paula Rego alongside the interiors of Sir John Soane’s house, Charleston, Museums and breakfast cafes.\n\nI have explored our theme through its association with emotions, mood, movement, aesthetics and identity. These colours include: night- time fears, the depth of velvet, cups of tea, longing, shimmering light, a sense of home, jewels and metals, convex mirrors, embroidery, memories, fairground rides, the sea, overheard conversations and quiet musings.\n\nWinged Hypnos\n\nAcrylic on canvas 2023\n\nImage adapted from a Roman copy of a Greek bronze head of Hypnos in the British Museum collection since 1868\n\nDonkey, my Friend\n\nWatercolour and pencil drawing torn and reassembled on magazine cover published in 1952\n\nElytra and Fountain\n\nAcrylic on canvas 2023\n\nShining Blue Castle\n\nPhotograph 2023\n\nImage of found black and white tourist photograph showing a beautiful view in the Cote d’Azur viewed through a glass prism on a magazine cover from 1952.\n\nBowl of Gold & Figure\n\nAcrylic on canvas 2023\n\nGoldfish image adapted from fireplace design by Duncan Grant 1925, Charleston."
