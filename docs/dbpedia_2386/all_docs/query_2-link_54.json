        "text": "THE GREEK GODS - PRINCESS URIBE\n\nUser-created\n\nThis user gallery has been created by an independent third party and may not represent the views of the institutions whose collections include the featured works or of Google Arts & Culture.\n\nIn this gallery, you will find representations of Greek Gods and the areas in which they ruled and had dominion over in the form of sculptures, statues and painted objects that are three dimensional in nature.\n\nHere we have Zeus, God of the Sky. In this statue, Zeus is shown in a power stance about to throw a lightning bolt. This shows how he carries out his divine will. The statue is finely sculpted, showing great details in Zeus physical appearance. It's a really elegant sculpture. It's glossy finish shows great craftsmanship.\n\nThis is Hermes, God of the Roadways, Travelers, Merchants and Thieves. This marble sculpture is crafted with such detail. We can identify that this is him by his winged sandals and the herald's staff in his left hand.\n\nOn the far right, we have Poseidon, God of the sea. You can tell it's him by the trident he is holding. The god on the left is Dionysos, God of Wine. He is pictured carrying a vine and drinking cup. This jar is very detailed. The gods are easily identified by their attributes.\n\nHere we have Demeter, goddess of fertility. The way this statue was built shows how Demeter was portrayed; serene, mature, motherly and modestly veiled. You can tell by how she is poised, seated on her throne.\n\nThis is Hypnos, God of Sleep. This bronze sculpture shows a young Hypnos in his younger years. He is shown with his wings that allowed him to move over land and sea so he could get people to fall asleep.\n\nThis is Athena, Goddess of Wisdom and Military victory. This bronze sculpture displays the goddess wearing the aegis and a Corinthian helmet with a big, double-plumed crest. This indicates her involvement within the military.\n\nHere we have Aphrodite, Goddess of love. She is shown standing very poised wearing a large wreath of flowers and a cloak around her hips. She is shown semi nude to display her sensuality.\n\nThis is Apollo, God of Music. He is displayed standing, \"holding his kithara, a stringed harp like instrument.\" This is a strong indicator that he is the God of Music.\n\nThis is Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt. In this statue, you see her quiver strap that runs diagonally across her chest. This shows that she is the goddess of the hunt. The quiver is said to be made of metal; suggested by the hole above her right shoulder-blade."
