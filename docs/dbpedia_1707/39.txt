Where to Watch

Bye, See You Monday is a wistful French/Canadian comedy of romance. Miou-Miou and Carole Laure star as a pair of attractive young housemates. Both ladies are involved with married men; both approach these delicate relationships in different fashion; and both learn a little something about what happens when one plays with fire. David Birney costars in this clever concoction. Bye, See You Monday, originally titled Au Revoir a Lundi, was filmed in 1979, but withheld from general release until 1981.
