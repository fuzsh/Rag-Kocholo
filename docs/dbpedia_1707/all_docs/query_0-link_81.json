        "text": "\"By The Numbers presented by Compass Minerals\" is a season-long series that gives a statistical preview of every Sporting match. To visit the series archive, click here.\n\nSporting Kansas City will visit reigning MLS Cup champion Columbus Crew in the Leagues Cup Round of 32 at 6:30 p.m. CT on Friday at Lower.com Field. The Knockout Stage match will stream live on Apple TV for MLS Season Pass subscribers and radio coverage will air on Sports Radio 810 WHB, La Grande 1340 AM and SiriusXM FC.

Food and drink specials will start at 5:30 p.m. with the first 25 fans in attendance receiving their first drink on the club.\n\nManager Peter Vermes' men have found their footing since the end of June, winning five of their last nine games and progressing to the knockout rounds of Leagues Cup. Awaiting them is a formidable Columbus side that boasts a potent attack, a stingy defense and a possession-oriented playing style that has yielded significant success over the last 18 months.\n\nAs anticipation builds toward Friday, we take a statistical look at the win-or-go-home battle in our newest edition of By The Numbers, presented by Compass Minerals.\n\nHead-to-Head\n\nSporting and Columbus have never previously met in an international competition. Leagues Cup will be the fourth competition in which Sporting and Columbus square off (MLS regular season, MLS Cup Playoffs and Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup).\n\nThe clubs last met on June 22 in Columbus. The Crew earned a commanding 4-0 home win behind a Cucho Hernandez hat trick and a second-half strike from Christian Ramirez.\n\nThe result on June 22 was Sportingâs first lost to Columbus since August 2015. Kansas City went 2-0-3 against Columbus from 2016-2022.\n\nSporting has just two losses in the last 13 regular season meetings between the clubs since October 2012, going 7-2-4 against the Crew during that stretch.\n\nSporting has a 26-23-9 record in the 58-game regular season series, scoring 86 goals (1.48 per game) and conceding 88 (1.52 per game).\n\nNo current Sporting players have scored against Columbus as members of Kansas City.\n\nTwo current Sporting players have scored one regular season goal against Columbus: midfielder Memo Rodriguez (in 2020 as a member of Houston Dynamo FC) and forward Khiry Shelton (in 2016 as a member of New York City FC).\n\nForward Christian Ramirez has one regular season goal against Sporting as a member of four different clubsâMinnesota United (2017), LAFC (2019), Houston Dynamo FC (2020) and Columbus (2024).\n\nColumbus forward Cucho Hernandez scored his third career MLS hat trick in the most recent meeting against Sporting on June 22. His first two MLS hat tricks came in September 2023 against Montreal and Chicago, respectively.\n\nColumbus forward Diego Rossi has five goal contributions (two goals, three assists) in seven regular season appearances against Sporting.\n\nSporting Kansas City\n\n2024 MLS record: 6-14-6, 24 points (12th in West | 41 GF, 52 GA)\n\n2024 away record (all competitions): 3-9-2 (17 GF, 27 GA)\n\nLast five matches (all competitions): 2-2-1 (W-L-T-W-L)\n\nLeagues Cup group stage: Won 2-1 vs. Chicago; Lost 1-2 vs. Toluca\n\nSporting has advanced to the Leagues Cup knockout stage for the second straight season after finishing second in West Region Group 4.\n\nSporting is looking to reach the Leagues Cup Round of 16 for the first time since the tournament expanded to its current format last summer.

That accounts for 26.9% of the clubâs goal scoring (14 of 52).\n\nSporting has fielded 23 different starting lineups in its last 23 matches across all competitions. Sporting has utilized 27 different starting lineups in 31 total matches this season.\n\nForward Willy Agada leads Sporting with 11 goals this season in all competitionsânine in the MLS regular season, one in the Open Cup and one in Leagues Cup.\n\nAgada has six goals across his last six starts in all competitions since July 7.\n\nForward Stephen Afrifa scored an equalizer in Mondayâs 2-1 loss to Toluca in the Leagues Cup group stage finale. He is tied for the team lead with five goals this season in all competitions.\n\nAfrifa has goal contributions in each of Sportingâs first two Leagues Cup matches, having earned an assist in a 2-1 win over Chicago on July 28.\n\nForward Johnny Russell assisted Afrifaâs goal on Monday and now has 50 assists in his Sporting career, fifth most in club history.\n\nRussell leads Sporting with seven assists this season in all competitions.

The clubâs last road win in an international tournament was a 2-0 decision against Toluca that sealed a 5-0 aggregate victory in the 2019 Concacaf Champions League Round of 16.\n\nSporting is visiting the state of Ohio for a Leagues Cup match for the second straight year. The team opened its Leagues Cup 2023 campaign with a 3-3 draw at FC Cincinnati, falling 4-2 on penalty kicks.\n\nSporting is visiting an MLS team in an international tournament for the fourth time after traveling to face FC Cincinnati in Leagues Cup 2023 (T 3-3), Vancouver Whitecaps FC in the 2016-17 Concacaf Champions League (L 0-3) and New England in the 2009 SuperLiga (T 1-1).\n\nSportingâs best finishes in an international competition came in 2002 and 2019 when the club reached the semifinals of the Concacaf Champions Cup and Concacaf Champions League, respectively.\n\nColumbus Crew\n\n2024 MLS record: 12-4-7, 43 points (3rd in East | 47 GF, 22 GA)\n\n2024 home record (all competitions): 7-1-6 (25 GF, 10 GA)\n\nLast five matches (all competitions): 2-2-1 (W-W-W-T-L)\n\nLeagues Cup group stage: Bye to knockout stage\n\nColumbus advanced to the final of the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup, falling 3-0 to Pachuca on June 1. It was the Crewâs best finish in an international competition in club history.\n\nAs the 2023 MLS Cup champion, Columbus earned a group stage bye to the Leagues Cup knockout stage.
