        "text": "House Title, Defined\n\nA house title represents all of the legal rights surrounding the ownership and use of a residential property. A property title isn’t a document; it’s a concept used to establish a property owner’s “bundle of rights.”\n\nBundle Of Rights\n\nThe bundle of rights encompasses all of the rights that come with being a property owner. It means you have the right to:\n\nPossess the property (Right of Possession)\n\nUse the property (Right of Control)\n\nEnjoy the property however you wish (Right of Enjoyment)\n\nSell, rent, or transfer ownership (Right of Disposition)\n\nLimit who can enter the property (Right of Exclusion)\n\nThese rights may be limited by the law, easements or liens on the property or homeowners association (HOA) rules. For example, though you typically have the right to limit who can enter your property, a legal search warrant presented by a law enforcement officer can override this right. Also, while you might enjoy painting the exterior of your home to look like a lava lamp, your HOA might not permit this.\n\nWhen you buy a house, there are a few different ways you can opt to hold title. We’ll get more into that in a minute.\n\nChain Of Title\n\nChain of title refers to the history of ownership of a home.\n\nWhen a home is in the process of being sold, its chain of title will be thoroughly scrutinized to ensure that the seller actually has the legal right to sell the home and that the buyer will be able to take possession of the home without any encumbrances that could jeopardize their ownership or cost a lot of money to remedy. This is called a title search.\n\nTypically, the entity that performs this search during a home purchase transaction is a title company. They’ll comb through public records to ensure that the title is clear.\n\nWhy Is The House Title Important?\n\nA home’s title tells us who legally owns it. It also tells us who has a claim to the property.\n\nYou might think that the person selling the home is the one who legally owns it, and that when they sell it to you, you’ll be the legal owner. But it’s not always that simple.\n\nSay, for example, somewhere along the chain of title on a home, the property was sold when it was supposed to be willed to some long-lost heir. Unaware of this, you buy the home. Then a few years later, this long-lost heir comes a-knockin’ at your door – or rather, their door.\n\nIf that heir can prove that they’re the rightful owner of the property, you could lose your home.\n\nMore commonly, a homeowner will, knowingly or not, try to sell a home that has some type of lien on it. Maybe they have property taxes they never paid or a contractor performed some work on the house and was never paid for the job. If the sale goes through, the new owner becomes legally responsible for those debts.\n\nA title search will usually catch these things and prevent the sale from moving forward until any issues are resolved and the title is clear. If a problem with the title comes to light after you’ve purchased the home, title insurance could protect you from any related financial loss.\n\nIf you’re relying on title insurance as your protection, you’ll have to purchase an owner’s title policy in addition to the lender’s title policy required by the mortgage company that protects its interest in your home from an investment standpoint. Without the owner’s policy, your mortgage company will be covered, but you won’t be able to rely on it for a new home.\n\nIt’s also important to understand the way you hold title on your property. Co-owners, liens and easements can all limit what you’re able to do as an individual with your property.\n\nPrimary Methods For Holding House Title\n\nThere are a few different ways homeowners can hold title to a property. These different methods can change how ownership interest is divided among co-owners and who that interest will be passed onto when an owner dies.\n\nBelow are some of the most common ways a homeowner can hold title and how they typically work. However, the types of ownership available to you and the specifics of those types can vary depending on your state’s laws.\n\nSole Ownership\n\nThis method for holding title is pretty straightforward. A sole owner holds title to a property in their name only; they don’t share ownership interest with anyone else.\n\nThis type of ownership is most often utilized by single homeowners or married individuals who want to be the sole owner of the property. If you’re a married person buying a house without your spouse, your spouse may need to formally relinquish their right to that property by signing a quitclaim deed or otherwise waiving their spousal rights at the closing table.\n\nWhen a sole owner dies, who takes over ownership of the home depends on whether they had a will. If they did, the property will be passed to the heirs designated in the will. If they didn’t have a will, the home will be transferred according to state law.\n\nCommunity Property\n\nArizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin are what’s known as community property states.\n\nIn these states, any property obtained by one spouse during a marriage is considered to belong equally to both spouses. When it comes to homeownership, this means that both spouses hold title on the home as community property.\n\nDepending on individual state laws, this type of ownership may or may not include what’s known as “right of survivorship.”\n\nRight of survivorship means that when one owner dies, their ownership interest is automatically transferred to the living owner(s) without having to go through probate.\n\nFor example, if a husband and wife own their home together and the husband dies, the wife will automatically become the sole owner of the home.\n\nWithout right of survivorship, both spouses are free to will their share in the property to whomever they choose.\n\nJoint Tenancy\n\nJoint tenancy allows two or more co-owners to share equal, undivided interest in a property.\n\nThis means that each co-owner has an equal right to the entire property, with ownership interest typically split up evenly (so two co-owners would both have a 50% interest in the property, for example).\n\nWhen co-owners hold title this way, they’re granted right of survivorship. This means your share can’t be willed to others and will automatically pass to your co-owner(s) upon your death.\n\nHowever, depending on your state’s laws, one joint tenant may be able to unilaterally sever the joint tenancy agreement and convert it to a tenancy in common agreement (more on that below), which allows property to be willed to others.\n\nThis type of ownership is popular with married couples.\n\nTenancy In Common\n\nTenancy in common allows two or more people to co-own a property with ownership interest split up however they choose. This means that one co-owner could own a 75% interest in the property while the other owns 25%. However, all co-owners have an equal right to possess the entire property.\n\nThis type of ownership is common among unmarried couples.\n\nWith tenancy in common, each owner has a right to sell, give away or otherwise do as they wish with their ownership interest. This includes the right to will it to whomever they choose, as tenancy in common doesn’t include right of survivorship.\n\nTenancy By Entirety\n\nThis type of ownership is only available to married couples, and isn’t an option in every state.\n\nWith tenancy by entirety, a married couple is viewed as a single legal entity for the purposes of property ownership.\n\nTenancy by entirety includes right to survivorship. Each spouse needs the other’s permission before they can sell, transfer or encumber the property or their interest in it.\n\nLiving Trust\n\nSome homeowners may decide the best way to handle the ownership of their property is to put it into a living trust.\n\nThis type of ownership means that your property is held in a trust by you, for you; you’re both the trustee and the beneficiary.\n\nWhen you die, the assets in your trust will be distributed according to your instructions without having to go through probate.\n\nIt’s worth noting that when you initially close on the property or refinance it, many lenders, including Rocket Mortgage®, will only lend to people and not legal entities. The property cannot close in a trust."
