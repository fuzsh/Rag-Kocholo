        "text": "Want to know how to say âgoodbyeâ in French? Learning how to say farewell in French is a good way to end your conversations naturally in the French language. Below, youâll learn how to say âgoodbyeâ in French as well as other expressions to use when parting ways with native speakers.Â Want to learn more words and phrases in French?Â Try Drops!\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n#1 Au revoir - âGoodbyeâ in French\n\nIn French, au revoir is a common way youâll hear people say âgoodbyeâ in French and its acceptable in most situations--both formal and informal. Literally, it means âuntil we see each other again.â\n\n#2 Salut - âByeâ in French\n\nSalut is a versatile expression in French. You can use it to say either âhelloâ or âbyeâ in French. Itâs a very casual way to say âbyeâ in French, so be sure you donât use it in formal situations!\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n#3 Ã demain - âSee you tomorrowâ in French\n\nDo you plan on seeing someone tomorrow? If so, you can use Ã demain to say âsee you tomorrowâ.Â\n\n#4 Ã bientÃ´t - âSee you soonâ in French\n\nIf you would like to tell someone that youâll see them soon, you can use bis bald. Bis means âtillâ and bald means âsoonâ. Itâs okay to use in both formal and informal situations.Â\n\n#5 Ã tout de suite - âSee you in a momentâ in French\n\nÃ tout de suite means âsee you soonâ, but with more immediately. In a way, it also means âsee you in a moment.â So, for example, if you were chatting with a French colleague by their desk but needed to leave to prepare for a meeting starting shortly that youâll both attend, you could use this phrase.Â\n\n#6 Ã tout Ã lâheure - âSee you laterâ in French\n\nIn addition to saying âsee you soonâ, you can also say âsee you laterâ in French. This is Ã tout Ã lâheure, but you can also use...\n\n#7 Ã plus (tard) - âSee you laterâ in French\n\nÃ plus tard means âsee you laterâ in French, but it can be shortened to Ã plus and in written communication, you may even see it as A+. This is slightly more informal than the Ã tout Ã lâheure.Â Â\n\n#8 Ciao - âByeâ in French\n\nThis farewell has Italian origins, but itâs a word that French, along with many other languages, like German, has borrowed.Â\n\nâ\n\n#9 Ã la prochaine - âUntil next timeâ in French\n\nIf you want a way to âsee you laterâ or âsee you next timeâ to someone you see on a regular basis, but you arenât sure when youâll see them next, you can use Ã la prochaine.Â\n\n#10 Je mâen vais - âIâm going to goâ in French\n\nTo say âIâm taking offâ or âIâm going to goâ in French, you would use je mâen vais. Itâs slightly informal, but itâs a great way to tell someone âIâm going to get goingâ.\n\n#11 Bonne journÃ©e - âHave a good dayâ in French\n\nParting ways during the day? Tell the person youâre leaving âhave a good dayâ, letting them know youâd like them to enjoy the rest of their day. If youâd like to say âhave a good nightâ or âenjoy your eveningâ you can use the expression bonne soirÃ©e. These expressions are acceptable in both formal and informal situations and youâll often hear them used as youâre leaving stores or restaurants.Â\n\nIf youâd like to add a little extra familiarity to them, you can add Monsieur (âMr.â or âsirâ), Madame (âMrs.â), or Mademoiselle (âMissâ). So, for example, âBonne journÃ©e, Monsieur.â means âHave a good day, sir.â\n\n#12 Je me casse - âIâm offâ in French\n\nThis phrase literally means âI break myselfâ, but you use it to say youâre heading off in French. This phrase is very informal and would be best used with friends and not with family, co-workers or strangers.Â\n\n#13 Adieu! - âGoodbye!â in French\n\nEnglish speakers might be familiar with the expression âI bid you adieu.â In French, this has slightly more finality to it. Youâd most likely use it when you know youâll never see them again. It literally means âto Godâ and is the most formal of goodbyes on this list.\n\nâ\n\n# BONUS: Ã â¦ lundiâ¦ la semaine prochaineâ¦ etc. - âSee you Mondayâ¦â in French or âSee you next weekâ¦â in French, etc.\n\nIn French, you can use Ã followed by almost any time word to let someone know when youâll next see them. So, for example, you could see Ã lundi is âsee you Mondayâ and Ã dimanche is âsee you Sundayâ.Â\n\nâ\n\nLearn More Words and Phrases in Frenchâ"
