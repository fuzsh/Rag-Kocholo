        "text": "Saying âhiâ and âgoodbyeâ is the first thing you learn when studying any foreign language. But have you ever stopped to think about why itâs important to learn different ways to say goodbye in English?\n\nIt's not just a matter of polite manners, but rather a matter of language culture. One expression may be reserved for family and close friends, while another could be used with someone you met only once or twice.\n\nJust like hello in English, saying goodbye is a very important part of communication, and there are many different ways to say it. While there are many creative and funny ways to say goodbye in English, it's important to know the right one to use in different situations and contexts. You don't want to offend someone by being informal when you should be formal or visa-versa.\n\nTo help you avoid awkward situations, weâve prepared this list of 80+ ways to say goodbye and additional ways to say goodbyeÂ without actually saying goodbye (in case you need a sneaky exit strategy).\n\nAnd if you want to master how to say goodbye in over 100 different languages, we've got a blog for that too, of course.\n\nFirstly, how do you actually say âgoodbyeâ and âbyeâ in English?\n\nThe most common way to say goodbye in English is simply âgoodbyeâ (pronounced: gud-bai). This is a neutral way to end a conversation, a phone call, or when youâre exiting a place. The good news is that you can never go wrong when using this word to say goodbye, especially in formal situations. You can say it to your boss at the office or your overly polite aunt at a family dinner.\n\nYouâve probably also heard English speakers use expressions such as âbyeâ or âbye-bye,â which are both informal abbreviations of âgoodbye.â These two expressions are more suited for casual settings. You can use either one of them to end a phone conversation with your talkative girlfriend or say goodbye to your 7-year-old nephew after playing Minecraft with him for three hours.\n\n80+ other ways to say goodbye without saying goodbye\n\nâGoodbye,â âbye,â or âbye-byeâ arenât the only ways to say goodbye in English. In fact, if you always use one of these three expressions to end all of your conversations in English, theyâll seem unnatural and, frankly, quite strange!\n\nSo, help us help you avoid socially awkward conversations and read this list of ways to say goodbye without saying goodbye.\n\nHow to say goodbye in English formally or in a business setting\n\nKnowing what expressions to use in formal situations is one of the most important things to learn, not only when it comes to vocabulary but also in terms of culture. In some English speaking countries, politeness is fundamental, and people can be extremely polite (if youâve ever been to England, you know what we mean).\n\nFor example, a simple thank you in English is enough to end the interaction when leaving a supermarket. But in case youâre leaving a business meeting, you might need to have a few useful expressions up your sleeve to make a lasting impression.\n\nSo, letâs take a look at some ways to say goodbye in English formally.\n\nEnglishPronunciationContextHave a nice weekend!/ hÉv É ËnaÉªs ËwiËËkend /A universal way to wish someone a good day.Have a nice day!/ hÉv É ËnaÉªs ËdeÉª /A universal way to wish someone a good day.Have a great rest of your day!/ hÉv É ËgreÉªt Ërest Év jÉr ËdeÉª /Same as above.I look forward to our next meeting./ ËaÉª ËlÊk ËfÉËrwÉrd tÉ ËaÊÉr Ënekst ËmiËtÉªÅ /You can use it when you have another meeting planned with this person.It was a pleasure seeing you/talking to you./ ËÉªt wÉz É ËpleÊÉ ËsiËÉªÅ ju ËtÉ:kÉªÅ tÉ ju /To affirm how pleased you were to see them/talk to them after a long time.It was a pleasure speaking with you./ ËÉªt wÉz É ËpleÊÉ Ëspi:kÉªÅ wÉªÎ¸ ju /A very customer-oriented way to say goodbye.Hope you have a wonderful day/evening/weekend./ hoÊp ju hÉv É ËwÊndÉrfÉl ËdeÉª ËiËvnÌ©ÉªÅ ËwiËËkend /To politely wish someone a nice time after your meeting/conversation.Take care./ ËteÉªk Ëker /A common expression in formal settings; it means you like someone and wish them well.Speak to you then./ ËspiËk tÉ ju ËÃ°en /You can use it if you have another conversation planned with this person soonIâll see you then./ ËaÉªl Ësi: ju ËÃ°en /You can say this to someone who has scheduled an appointment with you.Good night./ gÊ ËnaÉªt /This is a perfect goodbye for late nights in the office!\n\nHow to say goodbye in English casually or with friends\n\nSaying goodbye in an overly formal way to your friends would probably cause quite an awkward situation.

For example, in the USA, it's not common to kiss everyone on the cheek when saying goodbye. This is usually reserved for very close family members or friends. When it comes to cheek-kissing, if you're unsure whether to do it, just don't!\n\nAlso, itâs always considered rude to use a casual farewell in formal settings in any country. Don't say things like \"see ya\" if you want to be taken seriously!\n\nGoodbye songs in English\n\nDo we even need to say how much we love learning languages with songs?

Itâs truly a beautiful song.\n\nSee you later, alligator!\n\nWe hope that this guide on over 80 ways to say goodbye will help you sound more natural and fluent in English on your trips to English speaking countries, during business meetings, or during English conversations with friends.
