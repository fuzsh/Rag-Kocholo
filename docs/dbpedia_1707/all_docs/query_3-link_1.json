        "text": "Prefix or suffix added to someone's name in certain contexts\n\nNot to be confused with Tittle.\n\nFor other uses, see Title (disambiguation).\n\n\"Customary title\" redirects here. For other use, see customary land.\n\nA title is one or more words used before or after a person's name, in certain contexts. It may signify either generation, an official position, or a professional or academic qualification. In some languages, titles may be inserted between the first and last name (for example, Graf in German, Cardinal in Catholic usage – Richard Cardinal Cushing – or clerical titles such as Archbishop). Some titles are hereditary.\n\n\"Honorary title\" redirects here. For the term in academia specifically, see Honorary title (academic).\n\nTitles include:\n\nHonorific titles or styles of address, a phrase used to convey respect to the recipient of a communication, or to recognize an attribute such as:\n\nImperial, royal and noble ranks\n\nAcademic degree\n\nSocial titles, prevalent among certain sections of society due to historic or other reasons.\n\nOther accomplishment, as with a title of honor\n\nTitle of authority, an identifier that specifies the office or position held by an official\n\nMr. – Adult man (regardless of marital status)\n\nMs. – Adult woman (regardless of marital status)\n\nMrs. – Married Adult woman (includes widows and divorcées)\n\nMiss – Unmarried Adult Woman or Female child\n\nMaster – Male Child\n\nMadam (also Madame and Ma'am) – Formal form of address for an adult woman. Also used to denote a position of power or respect, similar to the usage of \"Mister\" for men, e.g. \"Mister/Madam Ambassador\".\n\nSome people object to the usage of titles to denote marital status, age or gender. In 2018, a campaign named GoTitleFree[1] was launched to encourage businesses to stop requesting, storing and using marital status titles in their registration forms, and when speaking with customers, launched on the grounds that titles often lead to assumptions about a woman's age or availability for marriage, and exclude non-binary people. This is in line with established practice advocated by the World Wide Web Consortium[2] and the Government Digital Service[3] which sets the standard for UK government online services. This in turn means that titles are optional on UK passports and driving licences.\n\nFamily titles in English-speaking countries include:\n\nUncle – one's parent's brother (may also include great uncles)\n\nAunt or Aunty – one's parent's sister (may also include great aunts)\n\nGranny, Gran, Grandma or Nana – one's grandmother (may also include great-grandmothers)\n\nPop, Grandpa, Gramps or Grandad – one's grandfather (may also include great-grandfathers)\n\nHon. (Honourable) (for younger sons and daughters of barons) and. Rt. Hon. (Right Honourable) (for Privy Councillors), used in the United Kingdom\n\nSome job titles of members of the legislature and executive are used as titles.\n\nMP, for members of the Parliament (usually the lower house)\n\nMYP, for members of the UK Youth Parliament\n\nMSYP, for members of the Scottish Youth Parliament\n\nRepresentative\n\nSenator, for members of the American or Australian upper house\n\nSpeaker, for speaker of Parliament\n\nPresident (from which comes such titles as Deputy President, Executive Vice President, Lord President of the Council, and Vice President)\n\nCouncillor, for member of a council\n\nYouth Councillor (YC)\n\nAlderman/Selectman\n\nDelegate\n\nMayor and related terms such as Lady Mayoress and Lord Mayor\n\nGovernor and Lieutenant Governor\n\nPrefect\n\nPrelate\n\nPremier\n\nBurgess\n\nAmbassador\n\nEnvoy\n\nSecretary, Cardinal Secretary of State, Foreign Secretary, General Secretary, Secretary of State, and other titles in the form \"Secretary of...\" in which Secretary means the same thing as Minister\n\nAttaché\n\nChargé d'affaires\n\nProvost\n\nMinister (from which comes such titles as Prime Minister and Health Minister)\n\nSee also: Royal and noble ranks\n\nPrince/Princess – From the Latin princeps, meaning \"first person\" or \"first citizen\". The title was originally used by Augustus at the establishment of the Roman Empire to avoid the political risk of assuming the title Rex (\"King\") in what was technically still a republic. In modern times, the title is often given to the sons and daughters of ruling monarchs. Also a title of certain ruling monarchs under the Holy Roman Empire and its subsidiary territories until 1918 which is still used in Liechtenstein, (Monaco still uses the title Prince to this day, even though it was not a part of the Holy Roman Empire) and in Imperial Russia before 1917. The German title is Fürst (\"first\"), a translation of the Latin term;[A] the equivalent Russian term is князь (knyaz).\n\nArchduke/Archduchess – A title derived from the Greek Archon (\"ruler; higher\") and the Latin Dux(\"leader\"). It was used most notably by the Habsburg Dynasty that ruled Austria and Hungary until 1918.\n\nGrand Duke/Grand Duchess – \"Big; large\" + Latin Dux (leader). A variant of \"Archduke\", used particularly in English translations Romanov Dynasty Russian titles. Also used in various Germanic territories until World War I. Still survives in Luxembourg.\n\nDuke/Duchess – From the Latin Dux, a military title used in the Roman Empire, especially in its early Byzantine period when it designated the military commander for a specific zone.\n\nMarquis or Marquess/Marquise or Marchioness – From the French marchis, literally \"ruler of a border area\" (from Old French marche meaning \"border\"); exact English translation is \"March Lord\", or \"Lord of the March\".\n\nCount/Countess - From the Latin comes meaning \"companion\". The word was used by the Roman Empire in its Byzantine period as an honorific with a meaning roughly equivalent to modern English \"peer\". It became the title of those who commanded field armies in the Empire, as opposed to \"Dux\" which commanded locally based forces.\n\nEarl (used in the United Kingdom instead of Count, but the feminine equivalent is Countess) – From the Germanic jarl, meaning \"chieftain\", the title was brought to the British Isles by the Anglo-Saxons and survives in use only there, having been superseded in Scandinavia and on the European continent.\n\nViscount/Viscountess - From the Latin vicarius (\"Deputy; substitute\". Hence \"vicar\" and prefix \"vice-\") appended to Latin comes. Literally: \"Deputy Count\".\n\nBaron/Baroness - From the Late Latin Baro, meaning \"man, servant, soldier\". The title originally designated the chief feudal tenant of a place, who was in vassalage to a greater lord.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Lord\" and \"Lady\" are used as titles for members of the nobility. Unlike titles such as \"Mr\" and \"Mrs\", they are not used before first names except in certain circumstances, for example as courtesy titles for younger sons, etc., of peers. In Scotland \"Lord of Parliament\" and \"Lady of Parliament\" are the equivalents of Baron and Baroness in England.\n\nLord – From Old English hlāford, hlāfweard, meaning, literally, \"bread-keeper\", from hlāf (\"bread\") + weard (\"guardian, keeper\") and by extension \"husband, father, or chief\". (From which comes modified titles such as First Sea Lord and Lord of the Manor.) The feminine equivalent is Lady from the related Old English hlǣfdīġe meaning, literally, \"bread-kneader\", from hlāf (\"bread\") + dīġe (\"maid\"), and by extension wife, daughter, or mistress of the house. (From which comes First Lady, the anachronistic Second Lady, etc.)\n\nEmperor/Empress – From the Latin Imperator, meaning he/she who holds the authority to command (imperium).\n\nKing/Queen – Derived from Old Norse/Germanic words. The original meaning of the root of \"king\" apparently meant \"leader of the family\" or \"descendant of the leader of the family\", and the original meaning of \"queen\", \"wife\". By the time the words came into English they already meant \"ruler\".\n\nTsar/Tsarina (Tsaritsa) – Slavonic loan-word from Latin.\n\nCaesar – The name of Julius Caesar taken by his heir Augustus and thereafter by Augustus' successors as Roman Emperor through the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Loaned into German as Kaiser.\n\nLeader – From Old English lædan, meaning \"to guide\". The head of state of North Korea is titled Great Leader. The de facto head of state of Iran is titled Supreme Leader.\n\nChief – A variation of the English \"Prince\", used as the short form of the word \"Chieftain\" (except for in Scotland, where \"Chieftain\" is a title held by a titleholder subordinate to a chief). Generally used to refer to a recognised leader within a chieftaincy system. From this come the variations paramount chief, clan chief and village chief. The feminine equivalent is Chieftess.\n\nMale version Female version Realm Adjective Latin Examples Pope There is no formal feminine of Pope Papacy Papal Papa Monarch of the Papal States and later Sovereign of the State of Vatican City Emperor Empress Empire Imperial\n\nImperial and Royal (Austria) Imperator (Imperatrix) Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, Ottoman Empire, Holy Roman Empire, Russia, First and Second French Empire, Austria, Mexican Empire, Empire of Brazil, German Empire (none left in Europe after 1918), Empress of India (ceased to be used after 1947 when India was granted independence from the British Empire), Japan (the only remaining enthroned emperor in the world).

Count Countess County Comital Comes Most common in the Holy Roman Empire, translated in German as Graf; historical: Portugal, Barcelona, Brandenburg, Baden, numerous others Baron Baroness Barony Baronial Baro There are normal baronies and sovereign baronies, a sovereign barony can be compared with a principality, however, this is an historical exception; sovereign barons no longer have a sovereign barony, but only the title and style Chief Chieftainess Chiefdom, Chieftaincy Chiefly Capitaneus The clan chiefs of Scotland, the grand chiefs in the Papua New Guinean honours system, the chief of the Cherokee nation, the chiefs of the Nigerian chieftaincy system, numerous others\n\nPopess\n\nThe title of a character found in Tarot cards based upon the Pope on the Roman Catholic Church. As the Bishop of Rome is an office always forbidden to women there is no formal feminine of Pope, which comes from the Latin word papa (an affectionate form of the Latin for father). The legendary female Pope Joan, is also referred to as Popess[5].\n\nNonetheless some European languages, along with English, have formed a feminine form of the word pope, such as the Italian papessa, the French papesse, the Portuguese papisa, and the German Päpstin.\n\nThese do not confer nobility.\n\nSir – Used by knights and baronets\n\nDame – Used by dames and baronetesses\n\n\"Sir\" and \"Dame\" differ from titles such as \"Mr\" and \"Mrs\" in that they can only be used before a person's first name, and not immediately before their surname.\n\nChevalier (French)\n\nCavaliere (Italian)\n\nAdvocate\n\nAdvocate General AG\n\nAttorney\n\nBailiff\n\nBarrister\n\nChancellor C (of the High Court)\n\nJudge and Admiralty Judge\n\nJustice J\n\nChief Justice or Lord Chief Justice CJ (of the judiciary)\n\nLord Justice Clerk\n\nLord Justice of Appeal LJ (of the Court of Appeal)\n\nJustice of the Peace\n\nMagistrate and Promagistrate\n\nMaster of the Rolls MR (of the Court of Appeal)\n\nMember and Chairman, for members of quasi-judicial boards\n\nMufti and Grand Mufti\n\nNotary\n\nPresident P (of the Queen's/King's Bench Division) or President P (of the Family Division)\n\nLord President of the Court of Session\n\nPrivy Counsellor (or Privy Councillor) PC (of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council)\n\nQueen's Counsel QC (King's Counsel KC when monarch is male)\n\nSolicitor\n\nLictor\n\nReeve\n\nSeneschal\n\nTribune\n\nTitles are used to show somebody's ordination as a priest or their membership in a religious order.
