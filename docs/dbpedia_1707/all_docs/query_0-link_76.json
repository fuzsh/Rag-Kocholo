On the other hand I do like to check and at least I can see how mistakes occur especially when using colloquial language .I always have an idea of what the unfamiliar phrase is...sometimes I am baffled because a translation is not correct However as my french is much better than my Spanish I occasionally check by using French to Spanish translations .You do very very well with an impossible job !\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nGreetings, Thank you for your review! We appreciate your feedback! All the best, -iTranslate Team\n\nparleen kaur ,\n\nAmazing\n\nThis app was and still is very helpful. I use it so I can improve my language skills and pronunciation. I love the fact that it has revision cards added to it because it is very helpful for my Spanish homework and even sometime English homework ( since I am not fluent, I get to learn new words) I have been trying to find the perfect app for translation but this is beyond perfect. The only reason I didnât give it a 5 is because if you want to use a different language keyboard, it will not go well because it will get use of everything that you use to type with including personal details like your house address, so plz donât do that or else other ppl will get your personal info. I also donât like the fact that I have to pay in order to use other features. I also think that some just SOME of the words need to be correctly written. But with all that aside lol, I LOVE this app and use it every time without hesitation and guess what, I get all my homework correct haha. Thanks for reading and I hope all my wishes and others wishes for improvement get fulfilled and they all give this app a 5 stars â­ï¸ as I does deserve ð¥°.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nGreetings, Thank you very much for your review!
