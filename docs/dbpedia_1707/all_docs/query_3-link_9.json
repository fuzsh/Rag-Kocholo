Sign up for the email list using the form found here.\n\nCapitalizing job titles\n\nOne of the most frequent inconsistencies I see when editing is the capitalization of job titles. While there is arguably not a set-in-stone “right” or “wrong” way to approach this, the University follows best practices used by other media and institutions. Let’s take a closer look at our style for job titles.\n\nGenerally, a formal job title is capitalized when it precedes a name, but is lowercase when it follows a name.\n\nThe speaker for the event will be Provost John McGreevy.\n\nbut\n\nThe speaker for the event will be John McGreevy, provost.\n\nWe invited Director of Internal Communications Jenna Liberto to our Monday meeting.\n\nbut\n\nWe invited Jenna Liberto, director of internal communications, to our Monday meeting.\n\nThe University has no preference on which construction is used. That will be up to the length of the title, the sentence structure, and the writer’s personal preference. In general, longer titles should go after the person’s name to make it easier for readers to digest.\n\nOne key exception to this rule is endowed titles, which are always capitalized no matter where they fall in a sentence.\n\nThe speaker for the event will be Charles and Jill Fischer Provost John McGreevy.\n\nThe speaker for the event will be John McGreevy, the Charles and Jill Fischer Provost.\n\nNote that when an endowed title follows a name, it is always preceded by the—this is also done to give readers an easier time.\n\nThere are other occasional exceptions, such as when a job title is more of a descriptor than a formal title.\n\nHistory professor Jane Smith has an office down the hall.\n\nTo read more about job title capitalization, check out chapter 8 of the Chicago Manual of Style.\n\nPop quiz!\n\nWhat's the University's preferred format for listing a time?\n\nClick on your answer.\n\n8 AM\n\n8:00 AM\n\n8:00 a.m.\n\n8am\n\nJanuary pop quiz winner\n\nCongrats to Olivia Rosenberg, assistant director of emergency management, the winner of the January pop quiz!\n\nWhich is the correct meaning of bimonthly? Every other month\n\nBimonthly historically means every other month, but so many people use it to mean twice a month that most dictionaries include both definitions (if you mean the latter, better to use semimonthly). But—if you're confused, readers are too! It's best to just write what you mean when talking about an event.\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nBomb Cyclone? Or Just Windy with a Chance of Hyperbole?\n\nThe New York Times\n\nOpinion | AI-generated writing highlights the need for editing and fact-checking\n\nPoynter\n\nBook recommendation:\n\nBecause Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language by Gretchen McCulloch\n\nLatest Style Guide updates\n\nHoly Week\n\nHoly Week is the week leading up to Easter, beginning on Palm Sunday. It includes Holy Thursday (also known as Maundy Thursday) and Good Friday, and ends on the evening of Holy Saturday. In all references, both words of Holy Week are capitalized.\n\nLent, Lenten\n\nLent is the period of 40 days in the Catholic liturgical calendar between Ash Wednesday and Holy Thursday. Lenten is the adjective form. Lent and Lenten are always capitalized."
