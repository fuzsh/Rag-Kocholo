        "text": "Monday’s are always the perfect day to start the week off with music, right? Actually, music always makes any day worth its weight in salt. Wait, what?! OK, I’m just grasping at cliche straws at the moment – let’s just say that music is awesome and move on, shall we?\n\nSo this week’s theme for Monday’s Music Moves Me was selected by our previous Spotlight Dancer, from Mark of Chronicles From the Man Cave who challenged us to find songs about “Moving Forward” – open to our own interpretation. Of course my interpretation stems from ‘moving forward’ from an idiotic lying cheating ex, and the subsequent abusive ex – so the first song that popped into my head is going to lead the charge.\n\nThe artist originally performed with his identical twin brother in the early years, but they decided to take a break from music. During that break they pursued different paths – six years later one of the brothers wanted to get back into it, since he had so many ‘stories’ to tell, and went solo with his brother’s blessing.\n\nUnfortunately, his solo act only produced his final one-hit-wonder in 2010 with this song. I love that he got Jaime Pressly to play the lead/girlfriend in this music video – I love her. Here’s Jaron And The Long Road To Love with “Pray For You”:\n\nNext up is a song that was released in 1998 by another favorite artist of mine – in fact, this particular song, along with another one, helped her get out of a bind when she made some bad business decisions and changed management – both of which almost caused her to file bankruptcy. Luckily this song was a hit, followed by another, so she was able to hang on to her sanity (along with her home and her car).\n\nHere’s the inimitable Jo Dee Messina with “Bye Bye”:\n\nNext up is a sibling trio who added yet another number one hit to their credit – for once written by the two brothers without their sister’s input. She was the first one to hear it, though, and immediately fell in love with it.\n\nIt’s the second single from their sophomore CD “Pioneer”, which they felt was the perfect moniker – you think of covered wagons and bonnets or astronauts on moons, but for them it meant going out into the unknown and knowing they have somewhere to go that they’re barreling towards, but not necessarily knowing the path they’re going to take. It’s all about putting one foot in front of the other.\n\nHere’s The Band Perry with “DONE”:\n\nLast, but certainly not least, is another favorite group who released this song on May 13, 2013 – their second single from the new album.\n\nThe song is about a breakup, seen mainly from the perspective of the male in the relationship, who sees the sights of his town and expresses desire to leave, because every aspect of the town reminds him of his lover. The song was drawn from experiences of one of the artists from a breakup of a girlfriend during his last year of college.\n\nHere’s Lady Antebellum with “Goodbye Town”:\n\nI’m still struggling to get back on track, and still trying to find time to get back in the groove with my blogging, especially the visiting all you awesome people part (which is sadly lacking at the moment) – having solid internet connection and uninterrupted time at my computer seems to be a non-existent entity at this moment, so please bear with me as I attempt to snag time as it comes along.\n\nThank you so much for visiting and commenting – I’ll return the favor as soon as I’m able! Have a great Monday!\n\nNow on to the particulars of Monday’s Music Move’s Me:\n\nI have the supreme honor and privilege of being a co-host with the inimitable Xmas Dolly and our musical cohorts,Callie from JAmericanSpice, Cathy from Cathy Kennedy’s Blog, and our Honorary Co-Conductor, Naila Moon at Just the Stuff Ya Know .\n\nWant to join in the fun? It’s easy – just find a tune that rocks your boat, post it and link up – don’t forget to grab Xmas Dolly…er, um, I mean her button…over at her place here. Check out Xmas Dolly’s sidebar for the random themes we sport each week – and you can always ask for a specific theme of music you like, too. Check out the other music lovahs and let’s jam!\n\nAPPLAUSE! APPLAUSE!"
