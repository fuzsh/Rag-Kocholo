        "text": "When you purchase a motor vehicle (new or used), you are required to pay the applicable taxes and apply for title in your name within 30 days of the purchase date. This is true regardless of the condition of the vehicle.\n\nIf you wish to drive the vehicle, you must also obtain valid registration (license plates).\n\nFor complete instructions, visit our Motor Vehicle Titling page.\n\nTo prevent unlawful use of your unexpired plates, you may destroy and recycle them where you are, or you may return them to any Missouri license office to be destroyed and recycled.\n\nIf you wish to mail them to our central office to be destroyed and recycled, please use the following address:\n\nMissouri Department of Revenue\n\nATTN: License Plate Surrender\n\n301 West High Street – Rm 370\n\nJefferson City MO 65105-0100\n\nIf you happen to receive a renewal notice for those plates, you may simply disregard the notice.\n\nUnfortunately, Missouri statute does not authorize a refund of registration fees for unexpired plates.\n\nA Transfer on Death (TOD) beneficiary is a simple way to transfer ownership of a vehicle after the titled owner has died. By naming a TOD beneficiary on your title application, you will avoid the need for the vehicle to go through probate upon your death.\n\nIf you choose to assign a different TOD beneficiary at a later date, you may do so by completing a new title application. There is no ownership benefit for the TOD beneficiary until the titled owner(s) have died.\n\nMissouri law requires that a motor vehicle must be titled (within 30 days of the purchase date) before it is either registered for highway use or transferred to another individual. If you do not have a properly assigned title (or Manufacturer's Statement of Origin), you have no clear legal right to the vehicle.\n\nIf you did not receive a properly assigned ownership document (e.g., certificate of title) at the time of purchase, and the seller is not available to make proper assignment, you may wish to seek the advice of a legal professional.\n\nA Military Award Placard is a removable placard which allows a qualified veteran to park their motor vehicle, weighing not more than 6,000 pounds, without charge in a:\n\nMetered parking space contingent upon approval of local authorities; or\n\nParking lot or garage on any public college or university in the state of Missouri, except during a special event where a separate parking fee may apply.\n\nA Military Award Placard may be issued to a veteran if the applicant has been awarded any of the following medals through military service:\n\nDistinguished Service Cross\n\nAir Force Cross\n\nCoast Guard Cross\n\nCongressional Medal of Honor*\n\nFormer Prisoner Of War*\n\nPurple Heart*\n\nSilver Star*\n\nNavy Cross*\n\nDistinguished Flying Cross*\n\nBronze Star*\n\nBronze Star Valor*\n\n* Specialty plate is available for this designation.\n\nTo obtain the placard, the applicant must submit:\n\nA completed and signed Application for Missouri Military Personalized License Plates (Form 4601); and\n\nThe veteran must already have one of the specialty plates listed above, or present award of medal verification. Common documents demonstrating award of medal are:\n\nCertificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (Form DD214);\n\nCorrection to Form DD214 (Form DD215); or\n\nA citation letter given with the award that states the medal has been received.\n\nThere is no fee charged for the placard.\n\nThe application may be completed at a local license office or mailed to our central office for processing.\n\nBefore using this placard, it is the placard holder’s responsibility to contact local authorities to verify that the Military Award Placard is accepted in that jurisdiction.\n\nNOTE: A Bronze Star Placard issued prior to August 28, 2017 will continue to be honored. The placard holder does not need to request a replacement.\n\nYou may apply for a new title at any Missouri license office. You must submit the notarized lien release (copy or original), your current title (if in your possession) and pay an $8.50 title fee and a $6 processing fee. The new title (in your name, without the lien) should issue within 3-5 business days, and will then be mailed to you (at the address provided on the application).\n\nIf you would prefer to submit your application by mail (to the address shown below), you must submit the documents and fees listed above, plus a completed and signed Application for Missouri Title and License (Form 108). Your signature on the Form 108 must be notarized if you are not in possession of your current title. The average turnaround time for a mail-in title application to be processed is 4-6 weeks.\n\nMissouri Department of Revenue\n\nMotor Vehicle Bureau\n\n301 West High Street – Room 370\n\nJefferson City MO 65105-0100\n\nNOTE: You should keep the original notarized lien release (or a copy) for your personal records. The copy that is submitted with your application will not be returned to you.\n\nPayment may be made by cash, personal check, or money order at any Missouri license office. Credit and debit cards (Discover, American Express, Master Card, and Visa) are also accepted.\n\nThe Department's central office accepts cash, personal check, cashier's check, money order, and credit or debit cards (Discover, American Express, Master Card, and Visa). Personal checks must be made payable to the Missouri Department of Revenue. Personal checks must be preprinted with the check writer's name, address, bank code, and account number. The personal check must also include the following information regarding the check writer:\n\nDriver license or nondriver ID number\n\nDate of birth; and\n\nDaytime phone number.\n\nThe Missouri Department of Revenue may electronically resubmit checks returned for insufficient or uncollected funds.\n\nCredit / Debit Card Transactions â The \"convenience fee\" charged by the credit/debit card vendor is 2.0% + $0.25 per card transaction.\n\nIf the deceased owner of a vehicle had not designated a Transfer on Death (TOD) beneficiary, the vehicle must go through probate before a transfer of ownership can occur.\n\nWhen applying for a Missouri certificate of title accompanied by Letters of Administration, Letters Testamentary, or a Small Estate Certificate/Affidavit, the following items must be submitted:\n\nThe appropriate application form, completed and signed:\n\nApplication for Missouri Title and License (Form 108); or\n\nApplication for Missouri Watercraft or Outboard Motor Registration and Title (form 93);\n\nThe certificate of title in the decedent’s name, properly assigned (by the administrator, executor, or personal representative of the estate) to the new owner. If the title is lost, stolen, or mutilated, the administrator, executor, or personal representative named in the court order must apply for:\n\nA duplicate title in the name of the estate (if one is open) or in the deceased person’s name; or\n\nAn original title in his or her name or by submitting an affidavit for lost title and the court order;\n\nThe original or certified copy of the Letters of Administration Letters Testamentary, or Small Estate Certificate/Affidavit; and\n\nThe appropriate title and processing fees:\n\n$14.50 (motor vehicle or trailer title)\n\n$13.50 (boat title)\n\n$11 (outboard motor title)\n\nThe administrator, executor, or personal representative (except a creditor with Letters of Refusal) may give the vehicle as a gift if the decedent paid taxes on the vehicle and a gift affidavit is presented. If the vehicle is transferred as a gift, no sales tax is due.\n\nIf the administrator, executor, or personal representative applies for title in their name, no sales tax is due.\n\nApplication for title may be made in person at any Missouri license office, or the paperwork and fees can be mailed to our central office for processing:\n\nMissouri Department of Revenue\n\nMotor Vehicle Bureau\n\n301 West High Street – Room 370\n\nJefferson City MO 65105-0100\n\nYou must sign and print your name as \"seller\", and the other person (who is being added) must sign and print their name as \"purchaser\". Leave the \"purchase price\" blank because this is not a complete change of ownership.\n\nEither one of you may then apply and pay an $8.50 title fee and a $6 processing fee for a new title in both names. You must complete an Application for Missouri Title and License (Form 108) and submit the application by mail or at any Missouri license office. This is also a good time to add a Transfer on Death (TOD) beneficiary.\n\nLienholder authorization is required to add or remove a name from a title if an outstanding lien exists. The Notice Of Lien, Lien Release, Or Authorization To Add/Remove Name From Title (Form 4809) should be used.\n\nYour ex must sign and print their name as \"seller\", and you must sign and print your name as \"purchaser\". Leave the \"purchase price\" blank because this is not a complete change of ownership.\n\nIf the title has been lost or stolen or you cannot reach your ex, but you were awarded the vehicle in the divorce, the divorce decree may be presented in lieu of the properly assigned title.\n\nYou may then apply and pay an $8.50 title fee and a $6 processing fee for a new title in your name alone (or you may add a different co-owner). You must complete an Application for Missouri Title and License (Form 108) and submit the application by mail or at any Missouri license office. This is also a good time to add a Transfer on Death (TOD) beneficiary.\n\nLienholder authorization is required to add or remove a name from a title if an outstanding lien exists. The Notice Of Lien, Lien Release, Or Authorization To Add/Remove Name From Title (Form 4809) should be used.\n\nThe person who's name is being removed must sign and print their name as \"seller\", and you must sign and print your name as \"purchaser\". Leave the \"purchase price\" blank because this is not a complete change of ownership.\n\nOr, if the co-owner is now deceased, proof of death is required (i.e., copy of death certificate, newspaper obituary clipping, funeral home card) with the unassigned title.\n\nYou may then apply and pay an $8.50 title fee and a $6 processing fee for a new title in your name alone (or you may add a different co-owner). You must complete an Application for Missouri Title and License (Form 108) and submit the application by mail or at any Missouri license office. This is also a good time to add a Transfer on Death (TOD) beneficiary.\n\nLienholder authorization is required to add or remove a name from a title if an outstanding lien exists. The Notice Of Lien, Lien Release, Or Authorization To Add/Remove Name From Title (Form 4809) should be used.\n\nWhen you apply for a title, you must submit a bill of sale or Notice of Sale (Form 5049) for the vehicle that you sold and the purchase (or contract to purchase) and sale dates must be within 180 days of one another. You do not have to purchase a \"like\" vehicle to qualify for a sales tax allowance.\n\nEXAMPLE: You can buy a car and sell a boat and receive a sales tax allowance for the car, but the two events must occur within 180 days of one another.\n\nThe purchaser of a motor vehicle, trailer, vessel (watercraft), or outboard motor may deduct the amount of a total loss claim settlement received from an insurance company plus the owner's deductible from the purchase price of another like unit that is purchased or contracted to purchase after the date of loss but no later than 180 days after the date of the total loss payment. The applicant must present a notarized statement from the insurance company indicating the year, make, and identification number of the “total loss” unit, the date the insurance company pays the settlement, the amount of the insurance settlement, and the amount of the insurance deductible, if applicable. If the insurance agent certifies that the information in the statement is true and accurate, the form does not have to be notarized.\n\nThe total loss statement can be in anyone’s name; however, at least one of the owners of the total loss vehicle must be the same on the application for title on the newly acquired vehicle. Example: John and Jane Smith have a vehicle titled in their name that is declared a total loss. Brenda Smith insured the vehicle and receives a certified total loss claim from the insurance company. As long as John or Jane’s name is listed as an owner or co-owner on the new vehicle, the total loss credit in Brenda’s name may be used.\n\nIn addition, the owner of a motor vehicle, trailer, vessel (watercraft), or outboard motor, that was replaced because of theft or casualty loss, who does not have insurance coverage on the unit, may receive a tax credit on the fair market value of the unit being replaced. The applicant must present the original or copy of the accident report completed by law enforcement agent showing the year, make, and identification number of the total loss vehicle, and the date of accident or loss accompanied by two appraisals listing the fair market value of the total loss vehicle.\n\nThe fair market value of the unit is determined on the pre-wrecked condition of the vehicle based on the Kelly Blue Book, NADA Used Car Guide, Abos Blue Book, or the average of two appraisals from licensed motor vehicle or boat dealers. The fair market value is deducted from the purchase price of the replacement unit. The replacement unit must be purchased or contracted to purchase within 180 days after the date of loss as certified by a law enforcement agency on the accident report.\n\nTo receive a tax credit on a total loss vehicle, the vehicle being replaced must be a like unit (e.g., a motor vehicle must be replaced by a motor vehicle, a trailer replaced by a trailer).\n\nNOTE: If you have already paid sales tax on your replacement vehicle you may apply for a refund by sending a completed Motor Vehicle Refund Request Application (Form 426) with all supporting documentation to the Motor Vehicle Bureau , PO Box 87, Jefferson City, MO 65105-0087.\n\nClick here for more information about Form 426.\n\nEffective August 28, 2013, the owner of a commercial motor vehicle registered for 18,000 lbs or above may be issued a second license plate for the rear of the vehicle. The second plate will have the same configuration as the initial (front) license plate, but will bear a “2” sticker indicating that it is for the rear of the vehicle.\n\nIf you wish to apply for a second license plate, you must submit:\n\nProof of ownership or registration;\n\nA completed Application for Replacement Plate(s)/Tab(s) (Form 1576); and\n\nThe $12 fee.\n\nThe transaction may be processed at the time of renewal or at any time during the registration period at any Missouri license office. The second plate will be mailed directly to your address (as specified on the application).\n\nTitling and registration for a scooter or moped depends on whether the vehicle meets the definition of a motorized bicycle. The Missouri statute definition of a motorized bicycle is as follows:\n\n\"Any two-wheeled or three-wheeled device having an automatic transmission and a motor with a cylinder capacity of not more than fifty (50) cubic centimeters, which produces less than three (3) gross brake horsepower, and is capable of propelling the device at a maximum speed of not more than thirty (30) miles per hour on level ground.\"\n\nA motorized bicycle does not have to be registered with the Missouri Department of Revenue. However, you must have a valid driver license to operate a motorized bicycle (though no motorcycle endorsement is required).\n\nMissouri statute does not require a helmet to be worn when operating a motorized bicycle. Please contact your local law enforcement agencies for any county/municipal codes that deal with helmets and motorized bicycles.\n\nKeep in mind that no motorized bicycle may be operated on any public thoroughfare located within this state that has been designated as part of the federal interstate highway system."
