It sounds very formal and is typically only used if you’re never going to see the person again.\n\nHowever, we use it to refer to the action of saying goodbye.\n\nWe’re leaving in a few minutes. Say goodbye to your friends.\n\nBye\n\nThis is the standard goodbye. It’s short, simple, and you can say it to absolutely anyone. It’s appropriate for friends, family, co-workers and business partners.\n\nEven if you use some of the other expressions on this list, you normally still say “bye” as well afterward.\n\nIt was great seeing you. I hope we can meet up again soon. Bye!\n\nBye-bye\n\nThis sweet and babyish expression is usually only used when speaking to children.\n\nOccasionally, adults will say “bye-bye” to each other, but only if they know each other well and are trying to be flirtatious or cute. You don’t want to say this to a colleague or business partner.\n\nBye-bye, Joey! Have a great day at school!\n\nWays to Say Goodbye in Formal Settings\n\nHere are some ways to say goodbye in more formal settings or when doing business with someone, as well as some slightly more casual alternatives you can use with your coworkers when leaving for the day.\n\nNote that in these phrases, the adjectives “nice,” “good” and “great” are interchangeable. For example, you can say “Have a nice day,” “Have a good day” or “Have a great day” and they all mean pretty much the same thing.\n\nEnglishContextExample Have a nice day / Have a great rest of your day This is a common way for cashiers, shop attendants or restaurant staff to say goodbye to customers during the day. Thanks for shopping with us. Have a nice day! Have a nice evening You can use this phrase to say goodbye to someone in the evening or late afternoon, like when you're leaving work for the day. I'm heading home. Have a nice evening! Have a great (rest of your) week If you won't see someone for the rest of the week, you can say this. It was nice meeting with you. Have a great week and I'll see you next Tuesday. Have a great weekend You can say this on a Friday to coworkers or anyone you generally see only during the week. Have a great weekend! See you on Monday. I look forward to our next meeting This formal expression is appropriate if you want to continue working with someone. Thank you for your time today. I look forward to our next meeting. Until... This expression is a little less common, but you might use it if you know the next time you’ll see the person. It was nice seeing you. Until next week! Take care This is a warm expression that can be used in professional situations as well as more casual ones. I'll see you when I get back from vacation. Take care! It was nice meeting you If this was the first time you met the person, you can use this phrase when saying goodbye. It was nice meeting you. I hope to continue working together in the future. It was nice to see you again / It was nice seeing you You can use this expression to say goodbye to someone you already know or have met before. Bye, it was nice seeing you!\n\nCasual Ways to Say Goodbye\n\nWhen you’re in a more casual situation, there are a whole other set of phrases and expressions you can use to say goodbye. You can use these with friends, coworkers you see often, family members and other acquaintances.\n\nEnglishContextExample See you later / See you soon These phrases are commonly and widely used to say goodbye in more casual situations. I'm going out for lunch. See you later! See you around You can say this to someone you sometimes run into but don't intend to make plans with, like a neighbor. It was nice running into you. See you around! See ya This is a shortened, more casual version of either of the previous two phrases. This is my stop. See ya! I’ve got to get going You can say this when you’re ready to leave a social gathering to let people know you’re ready to say goodbye. I’ve got to get going. I have to wake up early tomorrow morning.\n\nGotta go /\n\nGotta run These are shorter, more casual versions of the previous phrase and are often used when in a rush. Wow! It's already 5p.m. Gotta go! I’m heading off / I’m taking off This is another casual way to say you’re leaving and are ready to say goodbye. I'm heading off, I have to feed my dog. See you tomorrow! Have a good one This is a casual way to say \"Have a nice day/evening/night/etc.\" without having to specify, so you can use it at any time of day. I'm taking off. Have a good one! Good seeing you This is a more casual version of \"It was nice seeing you.\" It was so good seeing you! Let's get together again soon. Good night This can only be used late in the evening when people are going to bed soon. Here are some more ways to say good night in English. I'm going to bed because I have an early flight tomorrow. Good night! ‘Night This is an abbreviated, more casual version of \"goodnight.\" You might also say \"nighty night\" to a child. I'll see you in the morning. 'Night! Sweet dreams Here's a cute way to say good night by wishing that someone has good dreams as they sleep. I'm going to bed. Goodnight! Sweet dreams! Drive safe You can say this to someone who's leaving and will be driving. You're leaving already? Drive safe! Get home safe This is like the previous phrase but can be used no matter how the person is getting home. It's typically used at night. Get home safe! Text me when you've arrived. Have a safe trip / Have a safe flight You can say this to someone who's going on a trip or traveling home from somewhere relatively far away. I'm so glad you came to my wedding. Have a safe trip home! Safe travels This is a shortened, more casual version of the previous phrase. I hope you enjoy your vacation. Safe travels! Bon voyage While this is actually a French phrase, some English speakers use it to wish someone well before they go on a trip. Enjoy your trip to France! Bon voyage! Good luck You can say this to someone who's about to do something with some risk involved, like have surgery or perform on stage. Good luck! I'll see you when you get back from the audition. Have fun If the person you're talking to is going to do something fun, you can wish them well with this phrase. You're leaving for the party now? Have fun! Be well This is a goodbye or sign-off that means you wish the person well. Thanks for listening to our podcast! Be well. Keep in touch This is a way to tell someone that you want to stay in contact with them. It's generally used when you won't see them for a while but want to talk by phone or email. I'll see you at the wedding next summer. Keep in touch! Don’t be a stranger This is another way to tell someone you want to stay in touch with them. Don't be a stranger...come over anytime! This was fun You can use this to tell a friend or a date that you had a good time with them. This was fun! We should do it again soon. So long, my friend This is an old-fashioned, rather dramatic way to say goodbye that people these days generally say in a joking way. I'm heading out...this party is boring. So long, my friends. Farewell This is another old-fashioned way to say goodbye that is now mostly used in an ironic or funny way. Farewell, friends! I'll see you in a week. I bid you adieu Adieu is a French word that means\"goodbye,\" and this phrase is another silly one often said with false formality among friends. It's time for me to go home. I bid you adieu.\n\nSlang Ways to Say Goodbye\n\nThese are some colloquial expressions that you should know to avoid confusion when speaking with native speakers. If you can use them yourself, you’ll really impress your English-speaking friends!\n\nEnglishContextExample I gotta jet / I gotta hit the road These are slang versions of “I’ve got to get going.” “Gotta” is an abbreviation of “got to.” This has been fun but I gotta jet. Later / Laters / Catch you later These slang ways of saying “see you later” are common among teenagers. They’re very casual and should only be used with people you know very well. I've gotta go to work. Later! Peace / Peace out These casual ways of saying goodbye were trendy in the 1990s. Some people still use them today, but they can also sound outdated. I'm heading to class. Peace! I'm out / I’m out of here This is a casual way of letting people know you’re leaving, which should only be used among friends. \"Out of\" is often spelled and pronounced \"outta.\" I finally finished all my final exams for the semester. I'm outta here! Take it easy This expression is similar to \"have a good one\" and encourages the person to relax and enjoy their day. In a different context, it can mean “calm down.” I'm heading out. Take it easy, guys! I’m off This is another informal way of letting people know you’re ready to say goodbye. Anyway, I’m off. I’ve got a busy day tomorrow. Catch ya on the flip side This slang expression for \"see you later\" comes from when radio DJs played vinyl records and had to flip them over to the other side. It's a pretty old school phrase, but you might hear it occasionally. \"Ya\" is slang for \"you.\"\n\nI've got basketball practice. Catch ya on the flip side! Hasta la vista, baby While this phrase comes from the Spanish language, it was made popular by Arnold Schwarzenegger's character from the 1991 film \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\" I've got some business to handle. Hasta la vista, baby! Smell you later This is another slang phrase from the 90s that you probably won't hear much these days, unless you're watching TV shows or movies from that decade. I'm gonna be late for school. Smell ya later! It's been real This is a casual phrase used to say that you had a good time and are ready to leave. Well friends, it's been real...but it's time for me to go. Sayonara This word comes from the Japanese language and is a very informal way to say goodbye that's been around for many years. Have a great trip! Sayonara! See you later, alligator This is a playful way to say goodbye. It's often shorted to just \"later gator.\" The common response is \"In a while, crocodile.\" It's time for you to go to school. See you later, alligator!\n\nWays to Say Goodbye in a Letter or Email\n\nIf you’re writing a letter or email, there are a different set of words and phrases often used to sign off.\n\nEnglishContext Best regards A versatile and professional closing suitable for business and formal correspondence.

Ok, talk to you later. Bye. I'll call you right back If your phone call gets interrupted and you need to call them back, you can use this phrase. Sorry, my boss is calling me.

Bye for now If you're ending the call but expect to talk again soon, you can use this phrase. Ok, we'll talk again when you get there. Bye for now. Cya/Cya l8terThis is a shorter way to type \"See you\" or \"See you later.\" Young people sometimes use it when texting or chatting. Gotta go to class. Cya.
