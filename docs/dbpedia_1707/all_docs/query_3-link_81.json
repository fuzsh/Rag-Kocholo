        "text": "What is a Duplicate Title?\n\nA duplicate title is obtained when the original title has been lost, stolen, mutilated, destroyed, or becomes illegible. The duplicate title is printed with the word “DUPLICATE” on its face. When a duplicate title is issued, the original title becomes void. In the event the original title is located, destroy it to ensure it is not used in the sale or transfer of ownership of the vehicle. When purchasing a duplicate title, you must provide an unexpired photo ID (e.g., driver's license, state-issued ID, school, military, bank card, passport, probation card, work ID, membership card).\n\nHow to Purchase a Duplicate Title"
