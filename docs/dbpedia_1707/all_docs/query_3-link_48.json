        "text": "Titles\n\nRHODE ISLAND'S TITLE LAW HAS CHANGED\n\n*Effective January 1, 2024*\n\nALL USED VEHICLES coming into Rhode Island from out of state, regardless of model year, require a VIN Inspection from a local municipal police department.\n\nIf an out of state used vehicle is being registered in Rhode Island, and the state from which the vehicle is coming is a state that required a title for that vehicle, that title MUST be in the name of the seller, properly assigned to the buyer, and be presented, along with VIN Inspection at the time of sales tax payment or registration at the RI DMV.\n\nIf an out of state used vehicle is being registered in Rhode Island, and the state from which the vehicle is coming is a state that did not require a title for that vehicle, a valid proof of ownership (e.g. old registration, or paid sales tax form) in the name of the seller must be presented, along with a VIN Inspection, at the time of sales tax payment or registration at the RI DMV.\n\nALL USED VEHICLES, regardless of model year will now be issued a Rhode Island Certificate of Title upon payment of Sales Tax and/or Registration.\n\nTaxes and Titles\n\nWhen you purchase a vehicle in Rhode Island, you are required to pay sales tax on the vehicle and obtain a title in your own name, even if you do not register the vehicle.\n\nYou will need to complete both a Sales Tax form and a Application for Registration (TR-1) form.\n\nFor Out of State vehicles, a VIN check from the police department is required.\n\nThis transaction may be processed by mail, please send documents and payment to Division of Motor Vehicles, 600 New London Ave., Cranston, RI 02920.\n\nCosts are listed in the DMV Title Fee Table.\n\nPreviously Non-Titled Vehicles\n\nPrior to January 1, 2024 Rhode Island did not title vehicles model year 2000 and older.\n\nEffective January 1, 2024 ALL vehicles are now eligible for a title including model years 2000 and older previously registered under the old law.\n\nTo obtain a title for a previously untitled vehicle registered in your name, present a valid registration, expired registration, or stamped paid sales tax form and a completed TR2/TR9 and a payment of $52.50 to the Research Office at the Cranston DMV.\n\nDuplicate\n\nDuplicate titles are processed at the DMV Headquarters in Cranston only.\n\nYou must complete the Application for Title (TR-2/TR-9) form.\n\nCosts are listed in the DMV Title Fee Table.\n\nThe Research Office at the DMV headquarters in Cranston can assist you in documenting the vehicle's information.\n\nDuplicate titles can only be issued to active RI titled vehicles.\n\nNotes on liens and lienholders:\n\nRhode Island does not require a person to apply for a new title once the lien has been satisfied. RI only requires the lien to be released by your lien holder signing off on the title and/or providing you with a letter of lien release to attach to the title.\n\nYou can only apply for a duplicate title if you are the owner listed on the original title. If you still have a lien on the vehicle, the lienholder can apply.\n\nIf your original title was issued with a lienholder listed on the title, you will need to supply an original lien release with an application in order to receive a lien-free title in your name.\n\nSalvage\n\nThe following documents and fee must be submitted when the Owner of the vehicle is applying for a Rhode Island Salvage Title:\n\nSalvage application completed by the Owner listed on the face of the existing Rhode Island title.\n\nExisting Rhode Island title in the Owner's name.\n\nA letter from the insurance company stating the vehicle is a total loss and the owner is retaining the vehicle AND indicating Class A (parts only) or Class B (repairable) classification.\n\nWritten estimate/appraisal of the damage from the insurance company.\n\n$52.50 fee (check or money order).\n\nAll required documents and the fee can be mailed to the Cranston DMV, 600 New London Avenue, Cranston, RI 02920 or dropped off at the Cranston DMV Drop Box. The drop box is accessible only during normal business hours - Monday thru Friday, 8:30 am - 3:30 pm. If a Research Office reservation is needed, please follow the DMV's instructions on making a reservation.\n\nAll repairs to a \"salvage\" vehicle must be performed by a Rhode Island licensed salvage rebuilder. For additional information or a list of salvage re-builders, you can visit the Department of Business Regulations website.\n\nOnce the vehicle is restored, a salvage inspection is required.\n\nAffidavit in Lieu of Certificate of Title for Salvage Vehicles\n\nThe Affidavit in Lieu of Certificate of Title for Salvage Vehicle form is only to be used by Insurers or by Rhode Island Dealers, the primary business of which is the sale of salvage motor vehicles on behalf of insurance companies, applying for a Salvage Title to certify that a valid Certificate of Title for the vehicle acquired by the applicant is not available due to circumstances as detailed in RIGL 31-46-1. Do not use this form if you have the vehicle’s Certificate of Title. Mail this completed form, along with a completed Application for Title (TR-2 / TR-9) and any supporting documents, to the address at the top of the form. Attach originals of 2 written attempts sent by certified mail to contact the vehicle’s former owner and any known lienholder (originals required). Fee: $52.50. The Registrar may refuse to accept an incomplete filing.\n\nCustom Builds\n\nA custom built car or motorcycle can be registered or just titled and re-sold. You must present the DMV with documentation for all parts used to build the vehicle. The Enforcement Office of the Division of Motor Vehicles will verify all your documents.\n\nAdditional information about Kit Vehicles and Custom Builds\n\nIf you have questions, you can call the Enforcement Office of the Division of Motor Vehicles at (401) 462-5736 or visit the Enforcement Office located at the DMV headquarters in Cranston."
