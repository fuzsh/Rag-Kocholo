If the original out of state title does not require notarization of the seller’s signature our office will accept it as a valid proof of ownership document as long as the transfer section of the title is completed properly by the seller.\n\nTransferring a Non-Titled Vessel From an Individual\n\nNotarized bill of sale.

The HIN is similar to a VIN on a car. Vessels manufactured or imported before 1973 are EXEMPT because they often do not have a HIN. All vessels manufactured or imported after 1972, must have a HIN, and this HIN must be identified during the vessel registration process. HIN numbers are typically located:\n\nOn sport and fishing boats, they can be found on the back right outside corner.\n\nOn pontoons, they can be found on the right side of the frame above the pontoon, but below the deck.\n\nOn personal watercrafts, they can be found under the seat as well as on the lip of the foot rest.\n\nWhat are USCG Documented Vessels:\n\nVessel documentation is the process of registering a boat with the U.S. Coast Guard National Vessel Documentation Center. Unlike state titling, USCG vessel documentation occurs at the federal level.\n\nA USCG Certificate of Documentation establishes the ownership and nationality of a vessel. Recreational vessels over five net tons have the option to document their vessel with the U.S. Coast Guard and obtain a Certificate of Documentation.\n\nMore Information.\n\nWhat Vessels Must Be Registered:\n\nAll motorized vessels used on public waters must be registered, including jet skis.\n\nUS Coast Guard Documented Vessels operating in North Carolina for over 90 consecutive days must be registered.\n\nAll sailboats used on public waters must be registered if longer than 14 feet at the load waterline.\n\nIf a vessel registered in another state is brought into North Carolina for over 90 consecutive days, the registration must be transferred to North Carolina.

In most cases, lenders require a title as a condition for granting a loan on a vessel.\n\nWhat Vessels Are Exempt From Registration:\n\nVessels that are unused and kept on dry land.\n\nRowboats, canoes, kayaks, and rafts moved only by oars, paddles, or the current.\n\nA vessel used only on a private pond.\n\nShip's lifeboats or dinghies do not need to be registered if they are used only for emergency lifeboat purposes.
