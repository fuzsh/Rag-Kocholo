Use your full legal name as listed on your driver license.\n\nIf the title says 'person 1' AND 'person 2', both parties must sign it.\n\nIf the title says 'person 1' OR 'person 2', either party can sign without the other.\n\nIf the vehicle is not registered or not operational, you may change the title only without obtaining insurance, a smog check or registration. Bring the title to a DMV office.\n\nIf you will be registering and driving the vehicle, you must obtain Nevada liability insurance in the same name(s) which will be on the new title and registration. If your vehicle requires a smog check, you must have a new test done if the last one is more than 90 days old.\n\nBring the signed-off title, current registration slip and smog check if needed to a DMV office to re-register the car. Credit will be given for the unused portion of the current registration.\n\nIf you are changing your name, you must have the legal document which authorizes the change (Marriage Certificate, divorce decree, etc.).
