        "text": "What is a title?\n\nA title is a secure, negotiable document issued by the DOR that represents ownership of a motor vehicle, trailer, or a manufactured housing unit.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat vehicles are required to be titled?\n\nSince 1969 Mississippi requires all motor vehicles to be titled. Beginning in 1999 manufactured homes are required to be titled. Pre-1969 vehicles and ATV’s may be voluntarily titled.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nI purchased a new vehicle in another state. What do I need to title that vehicle in Mississippi?\n\nWhen registering the vehicle in Mississippi, you will need to provide the title from the other state and an odometer disclosure statement. If the vehicle was not titled in the other state, you will need to provide the Manufacturer’s Statement of Origin.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow do I title and register my motor vehicle when moving to Mississippi?\n\nYou should register the vehicle at your county Tax Collector’s office within 30 days of establishing residency in Mississippi. At the Tax Collector’s office you will need to complete an Application for Mississippi Title and License for each vehicle you own and pay all applicable taxes and fees. You will need the vehicle’s title and current valid registration (license plate) receipt from the state in which the vehicle was last registered.\n\nIf the title is being held by your lien holder or if the vehicle is being leased, you will need to supply documentation supporting the ownership. Appropriate ownership documentation is a registration receipt from another state or a duplicate title from another state. If all information is complete, you will be issued a license plate at that time. If there is a lien on the vehicle, DOR will hold the title application until the out-of-state title is forwarded to DOR.\n\nIf the title is being held by another state, the current valid registration (license plate) receipt from the state in which the vehicle is registered will be used as proof of ownership for accepting the application for title and registration. DOR will correspond with the lienholder and/or the other state to request that the title be surrendered to Mississippi. If the title is not surrendered, your application will not be processed and your license plate may not be renewed. The vehicle can not be legally operated without valid/current registration.\n\nYou will need to apply for a Mississippi Drivers License. Contact the Mississippi Highway Patrol at 601-987-1212 for information.\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat does it cost to make application for a Mississippi Title?\n\nThere is a $9.00 fee for a motor vehicle title or a manufactured home title. A “Fast Track” title is available for an additional $30.00 if you need expedited processing of the title application. Designated agents may add $1.00 to the transaction as their fee for services rendered.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow long does it take to get my Original Title from the state?\n\nTitles are normally issued within 3-4 weeks after the title application is received by DOR unless further research or documentation is required. Fast Track titles are issued within 72 hours of receipt of the application by DOR.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow do I apply for a Duplicate Title?\n\nYou must complete Form 78-006​ “Application for Replacement Certificate of Title” and pay a $9.00 fee. For a Fast Track title, complete Form 78-026 and pay a $39.00 fee.\n\nIf you are planning either to buy or sell a vehicle and that vehicle’s title is missing, the owner of the vehicle must apply for a duplicate title. The sale is not valid without a properly assigned title. If the title has been lost, mutilated, destroyed or otherwise ruined, the owner of the vehicle must apply for a duplicate title in order for the sale to proceed.\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow long does it take to get a Duplicate (replacement) Title issued?\n\nIt normally takes 10-14 days from time the application is received by DOR to receive a duplicate or replacement title. Fast Track titles are issued within 72 hours of receipt of the application by DOR.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nIf I purchase a vehicle without a title, what do I need to do to obtain a title in my name?\n\nIf you didn’t receive the title or cannot obtain a title, then you will need a title bond. Please contact the Title Bureau at 601-923-7640 for further information.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow do I transfer ownership of a vehicle or trailer I have sold or given as a gift?\n\nTo transfer ownership, the title for the vehicle or trailer must be assigned to the new owner. The seller must complete all information on the assignment of title except for the buyer’s printed name and signature. If the title assignment does not have a space to record the purchase price, a bill of sale will also be required.\n\nIf the buyer and seller are related as spouse, child, parent, grandchild, or grandparent, an Affidavit of Relationship should be completed.\n\nThe previous owner must remove their license plate from the vehicle or trailer once the title is assigned and the vehicle or trailer is delivered to the new owner.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat is the procedure to get a new title when an owner is deceased, or the decedent didn’t leave a will?\n\nYou should go to your local county Tax Collector’s office and complete a title application, form 78-002. You will need to have the previous (currently existing) title of the vehicle.\n\nOn the existing title, you will need the signature of the surviving spouse if the existing title is joint ownership listed as “John OR Jane Doe.” If the existing title is listed as “John AND Jane Doe,” or “John AND/OR Jane Doe,” you need a completed title application, the existing title signed by the surviving spouse, and a court endorsed copy of the decedent’s will.\n\nIf a will wasn't probated, you need to provide a letter of administration or testamentary naming the person (new owner) to receive the vehicle. If the owner of the vehicle died without a will, you will need to form 79-014, “Affidavit-Owner Dies without a Will.”\n\nLegal heirs should take the completed form and information to their local county Tax Collector’s office. The executors or administrators of estates may apply for an original title using the same process. A title fee will apply, along with other appropriate fees or taxes.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat is required for transactions involving manufactured homes?\n\nModel year 2000 and following are required to be titled. You will need to provide the original Manufacturers Statement of Origin when completing the application for certificate of title. Pre year 2000 units are required to be titled if the home is sold through a licensed mobile home dealer.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat are requirements for a motorized bicycle or scooter to be titled?\n\nA motorized bicycle manufactured in 1980 and after must have a seventeen (17) digit VIN conforming to the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration requirements. There must be a decal or plate attached with a statement that the motorized bicycle meets the Federal Safety Standards. If the motorized bicycle does not meet these requirements, it is considered a “toy vehicle.” A toy vehicle can not be titled or registered in Mississippi and can not be operated on public roadways within this state.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nDoes Mississippi title boats, watercraft and boat trailers?\n\nPlease contact the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks (phone 601-432-2065) for information on boat and watercraft registration requirements in Mississippi.\n\nBoat trailers may be voluntarily titled if less than 5000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW.) If the trailer is over 5000 pounds GVW, then it is required to be titled.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow do I have an error corrected on the Mississippi title that was issued to me?\n\nPlease take the incorrect title to your county Tax Collector’s office and apply for a corrected title. DOR will research the error. There is no fee if the error was made by the county and/or the state. However, if the title was issued according to the paperwork submitted, the applicant will be requested to submit a fee for the corrected title.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nHow do I change a name(s) on a title already in my name?\n\nTo change a name(s) on the title, you need to take the title to your local county Tax Collector’s office and complete the necessary applications. You may only add a member of your immediate family, specifically your spouse, parent, child, grandparent or grandchild, to a title.\n\nAdding additional names of non-immediate family members is considered a new title application and all fees and taxes, including casual sales tax, will be due. You will need to complete the information requested on the back of the existing title. Please record all the names that are to appear on the new title in the “purchaser’s name” space. If there is a lien holder for the vehicle, then the lienholder must be listed at the bottom of the title in the “reassignments” space.\n\nIf you are changing a name due to marriage or a court order, you will need to provide a copy of the marriage license or the court order.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nI have just purchased a new vehicle. What do I need to get the title in my name?\n\nIf the vehicle was purchased from a Mississippi dealer, the completed application for certificate of title is submitted by the dealer. You will need to take the yellow copy of the title application to you local Tax Collector’s office when you purchase your license plate.\n\nIf the vehicle was purchased from an individual, you will apply for a title with your county Tax Collector. If there is no \"purchase price\" space on the assignment of title, you will need to provide a bill of sale to the Tax Collector. You will be required to pay Sales Tax on the purchase of this vehicle.\n\nIf the vehicle was purchased from an out-of-state dealer, you will apply for a title with your county Tax Collector. You will need to provide a copy of your purchase or sales invoice to the Tax Collector. You will be required to pay Sales tax on the purchase of this vehicle.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nI sold my vehicle. How do I have my name removed from vehicle record?\n\nYou need to remove the license plate(s) from a vehicle or trailer that you have sold or disposed of when handing over the title to the new owner. You should then take the license plate to the county Tax Collector’s office. Once the tag is turned in, the record for the vehicle showing your name as owner will no longer be the current ownership record.\n\nIt is a good idea to make a copy of the front and back of the title after it has been signed and keep in your personal records along with other documentation.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat do I do when buying a vehicle and the seller does not have the title?\n\n​If you are buying the vehicle from a seller who does not have the title, the seller will need to obtain a duplicate or replacement title so that they may transfer ownership to you.\n\nI just bought a vehicle and the seller did not give me the title and I can't find him or her; OR, the title that the seller gave me does not have a complete assignment (missing signatures, mileage, etc.) and I can't locate the seller to fix the problem. What do I do?\n\nIn these types of situations, please contact the Title Bureau at 601-923-7200 for information.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nI'm selling my vehicle to a person that responded to my newspaper ad. He or she does not want me to write their name on the assignment as the new purchaser. They're telling me they will write it in later. Is this okay to do?\n\nNo. Never deliver or accept a title that is not completely and properly assigned. It is a violation of Mississippi law to fail to show complete chain of ownership of the title.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nDo I need to title/register an ATV? Utility Vehicle? Golf Cart? Motorized Scooters, Mini-Bikes, Dirt Bikes, Go-Karts, Motor Assisted Bicycles?\n\nIn Mississippi ATV’s are voluntarily titled but they are not issued a license plate (registered.) It is unlawful for any person to operate these vehicles on an interstate highway, federal highway or state highway, or in the corporate limits of any city unless authorized by such city. Please contact your local authorities and property owners for information about operation of these devices on private property.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat do I need to do if I import a vehicle?\n\nWhen you go to your county Tax Collector’s office to apply for a title and register the vehicle, you will need to take the following documentation with you: a current Registration Certificate; a notarized Bill of Sale; the foreign country's ownership documents (similar to our certificate of title); U.S. Customs Form 7501; EPA Form 3520-8; DOT Form HS-7; and, the manufacturer's statement of origin (MSO.)\n\n(In Canada the equivalent form for a MSO is referred to as a New Vehicle Information Statement (NVIS, ) and in Europe the similar form is referred to as a European Community Certificate of Conformity.)\n\nYou must provide a certified English translation of any document printed in any language except English.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat is a Fast Track Title?\n\nA fast track title (original or replacement) is one that is issued within a 72-hour time period after DOR receives the application. There is an additional $30.00 fee for this expedited service. The fast-track program does not change any paperwork requirements. All required documents must be completed and attached. If paperwork is not correct or completed, all paperwork will be rejected.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat is a “salvage” title?\n\nWhat is a branded title?\n\nA title brand provides important information about the condition of a vehicle. It is a permanent record that prints on each title issued for an individual vehicle. When you are buying a vehicle, check the front of the title for any brands and ask the seller if he/she should check any of the brands on the assignment of title at the time of transfer. Examples of branded titles include salvage, rebuilt, flood-damaged, and hail-damaged.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nMy vehicle was involved in an accident and I no longer have it. What do I do?\n\nAs the seller, you must sign over the title to your insurance company so they can apply for a salvage title. If you have sold the vehicle to a salvage yard, you must apply for the salvage title and provide it to the salvage yard.​\n\nBack to Top\n\nWho do I contact if I can not find the answer to my title or registration question in the FAQ?\n\nPlease contact DOR’s Title Bureau at 601-923-7200, or you may email your questions from the contact us section on our webpage.​\n\nBack to Top"
