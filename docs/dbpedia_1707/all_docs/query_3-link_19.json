        "text": "The Modern Language Association style, commonly referred to as MLA style, is a system of documentation generally used in the humanities, such as language arts and history. MLA documentation requires in-text citations for brief references to sources used in the body of the text and a works cited page featuring full citation information for all of your sources. In this style, writers create citations by listing all the core elements of a source.\n\nMargins:\n\nMargins are 1 inch on all sides of the page.\n\nFont:\n\nStandard font is 12-point Times New Roman. For other fonts, MLA recommends a font that when the word is italicized the difference is clear. Leave only one space after periods or other punctuation marks.\n\nParagraph and line spacing:\n\nIndent the first line of each paragraph 0.5 in. Text is double-spaced. No extra spaces before or after headings or between paragraphs.\n\nFirst page:\n\nIn the upper left hand corner of the first page, write your name, professor’s title and last name, the course title and number, and then the date (Day Month Year) on separate lines. On a new line, create a title (in Title Case) centered on the page. List your last name and page number in the top right corner of every page.\n\nSection headings:\n\nSection headings are used to divide major sections of a paper. MLA does not require specific formatting for section headings. The general rule is to maintain consistency in the use of bold, italics, and alignment when creating levels. Topics of equal importance share the same level heading throughout the document.\n\nCitations:\n\nIn-text citations are used to credit the work of others and refer readers to the source on your Works Cited page. Parenthetical citations include the author’s last name and page numbers. Enclose citations in parentheses and follow by a period.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nBegin a new page. Title as “Works Cited” centered on the top of the page. List all sources used alphabetically.\n\nIn MLA, every time you use the work or thoughts of another, you need to cite the original author. The use of others’ work or thoughts includes summary, paraphrase, and direct quotations. To cite the source, you will need an in-text citation, which typically consists of the author’s last name and the page number where the material comes from. In-text citations are enclosed in parentheses and followed by a period.\n\nSingle Author\n\nIf introducing the author in the text, use their first name and last name the first time it is used and then use only the surname thereafter. If introducing the author in the parenthetical citation, list only the author’s last name followed by the page number.\n\nSingle Author Example\n\nThe text portrays the mindset of millennials through lines like this: “[Alice thinks] of the twentieth century as one long question, and in the end we got the answer wrong” (Rooney 101).\n\nTwo Authors\n\nIf a source has two authors, list the authors’ names in the parenthetical citation or in the text and connect them with an ‘and’:\n\nTwo Authors Example\n\nThe first time the character Viktor is introduced, he’s described as “[…]the lowliest of the lot” (Charaipotra and Clayton 18).\n\nThree or More Authors\n\nList the first author’s last name followed by the abbreviation “et al.” (and others)\n\nThree or More Authors Example\n\nHeat is a significant symbol in the book Blackout. The very first page discussed how “tensions matching the temperature make people do stupid things in a city full of millions” (Clayton et al. 1).\n\nOrganization or Group Author\n\nIf no author is listed and/or the source is published by an organization or group, list the group’s full name in the text or citation (with the page number), followed by the abbreviation if well known. Use the acronym for every subsequent citation. If no known acronym is given, shorten the organization name to the shortest noun phrase within the parenthetical citation.\n\nOrganization or Group Author Example\n\nAccording to The Modern Language Association (MLA), “whenever you use the title of a source in your writing, take the title from an authoritative location in the work” (53).\n\nNarrative Citation\n\nIf you introduce the author before quoting, summarizing, or paraphrasing, then only the page number is included in the in-text citation:\n\nNarrative Citation Example\n\nAccording to music critic Mark Prindle, Minneapolis rock combo The Cows are an acquired taste (259).\n\nUnknown Author\n\nIf the author’s name is unknown, and there is no group author, include a shortened version of the publication title in quotations if it’s a short work or italics if it’s a longer work. Include a page number if it’s available.\n\nUnknown Author Example\n\nWhen thinking about what kind of photography to use, it’s important to consider that, “[d]igital photography is more eco-friendly than traditional photography” (Eco-tography 119).\n\nBlock Quotations\n\nWhen using a direct quotation that runs four or more lines long, the quotation is introduced by a colon, set off from the main text, and indented an extra half inch from the left margin. Do not indent the first line, add quotation marks not present in the original, or adjust the line spacing. Include the parenthetical citation after the final period or punctuation mark of the block quote.\n\nBlock Quotations Example\n\nFitzgerald movingly describes how the personality traits of Gatsby:\n\nOnly in Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. (Fitzgerald 6)\n\nOmissions or Alterations to Quotations\n\nPlace an ellipsis (…) where parts of a quote were omitted in the middle of the sentence (e.g. “Grammar… is the study of writing techniques”). Ellipses are not necessary to indicate the first part of a phrase was omitted. Put brackets [text] around necessary alterations made to quotations for clarity, as in “[They] said…”\n\nCommon Knowledge\n\nFacts or information that you already know, is widely available, and undisputed is considered common knowledge, which does not require an in-text citation. Common knowledge includes biographical information, dates of historical events, and other information that reasonable readers would accept as fact.\n\nCommon Knowledge Example\n\nAbraham Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States.\n\nDisclaimer: Our WordPress does not allow for “hanging indents,” therefore the following bibliography entries are not formatted with hanging indents. Check out the .pdf guide for a more accurate view!\n\nMLA style requires a works cited page that includes full citation information for each source. Begin by starting on another page titled “Works Cited” centered in the page. Alphabetize each entry by the last name of the first author listed. Hanging indents are an important characteristic of work cited pages. To make a hanging indent, The second and following lines are indented 1/2 inch after the first line. MLA style customizes entries for each type of source, meaning that each citation will be unique.\n\nWebpage from a Website\n\nWebsite citations follow a basic format for all types of websites. For sources without authors, list the group or organization as the author. If no group or organization is given, move the website name to the author position.\n\nWebpage from a Website Example\n\nAuthor Last Name, Author First Name. “Article Title.” Publisher, Day Month Year, URL.\n\nBoise State University Writing Center. “Welcome to the Writing Center.” Boise State University. https://www.boisestate.edu/writingcenter/. Accessed 9 Sep. 2022.\n\nBook\n\nList the author, the title, the publisher, and the year it was published. Include the editor/translator/any other type of contributor before the publisher if it can be found. The title can start the citation:\n\nBook Example\n\nAuthor Last Name, Author First Name. Book Title. Publisher, Year Published.\n\nPratchett, Terry. Guards! Guards! Gollancz, 1989.\n\nWork from a Collection\n\nThe type of works in this category may include an essay in an edited collection/anthology or a chapter of a book. Here’s the basic form:\n\nWork from a Collection Example\n\nLast Name, First Name. “Chapter Title.” Title of Book, edited by Editor’s Name(s), Publisher, Year, Page Range.\n\nKinsella, Sophie. “Seven.” The Party Crasher, edited by Kara Cesare et. al., The Dial Press, 2021, pp. 95-119.\n\nJournal Article\n\nJournal articles, or periodicals, are print and electronic sources issued within larger journals:\n\nJournal Article Example\n\nAuthor(s). “Article Title.” Journal Title, Volume (vol. #), Issue Number (no. #), Year, Page Range (pp.). DOI if available\n\nHollingdale, Jack et. al. “Impact of COVID-19 for people living and working with ADHD: A brief review of the literature.” AIMS Public Health, vol. 8, no. 4, 2021, pp. 581–597. DOI: 10.3934/publichealth.2021047\n\nNewspaper Article\n\nNewspaper and magazine articles are two other types of periodicals. Include volume, issue, and/or page number(s) if available:\n\nNewspaper Article Example\n\nLast name, First Name. “Article Title.” Newspaper Title, Day Month Year, pages (if print). URL (if digital)\n\nMitchell, Jessi. “New public health laboratory breaks ground in Harlem.” CBS NEW YORK, 06 July 2022, https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/harlem-public-health-laboratory/\n\nYouTube Video\n\nIncluding the author/creator/publisher is optional, you could just go into the title. If you bring up a name in your paper or want to emphasize a participant in the video, it would be a good idea to include it.\n\nYouTube Video Example\n\nLast Name, First Name. “Video Title.” Streaming Service, uploaded by Username, Day Month Year, URL\n\nSmith, Clint. “Marsha P. Johnson and the Stonewall Rebellion.” YouTube, uploaded by CrashCourse, 29 June 2022, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftcvaJCKVjs\n\nPodcast Episode\n\nCiting a podcast differs from the typical way of citing in MLA in that the title of the episode is listed first, followed by the name of the series in italics. Make sure to include where it was published, who it’s hosted by, and that it’s the podcast edition of the recording.\n\nPodcast Episode Example\n\n“Episode Name” Name of series from Publisher, hosted by Host Name, Podcast Number, Day Month Year. URL\n\n“The Mysterious Disappearance of Brittanee Drexel.” Morbid from Amazon Music, hosted by Alaina Urquhart and Ashleigh Kelley, episode 203, 23 January 2021. music.amazon.com/podcasts/30381209-4d12-4c82-ba16-5bde361156c9/episodes/40756d04-f27a-4723-b036-8a3d3083f508/morbidepisode203themysteriousdisappearanceofbrittaneedrexel"
