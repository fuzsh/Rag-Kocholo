        "text": "A Guide for Buyers and Sellers\n\nOver 1.2 million vehicles are officially registered in South Dakota, all of which are identified by a legal document called a vehicle title. While the primary purpose of a title is to establish who owns the vehicle, titles also provide vehicle information like make, model year, weight and the vehicle identification number (VIN). As vehicles are bought and sold, the title becomes the legal documentation of each change in ownership. Both the buyer and the seller must follow specific procedures to ensure the title is correctly transferred from one owner to the next.\n\nQuick Navigation\n\nVehicle Registration\n\nNMVTIS Vehicle History Report\n\nMethods of Annual License Renewals\n\nIn-Person Renewal\n\nRenewal by Mail\n\nInternet Renewal\n\nDMV Now License Renewal Kiosks\n\nRegistration Fees\n\nLicense Plate Renewal Dates\n\nLicense Plate Fees\n\nElectric Vehicles\n\nNon-resident Fee\n\nElectronic Lien & Title (ELT)\n\nBonded Titles\n\nOther Titles, Fees & Registration Resources\n\nTitles, Fees & Registration Online Forms\n\nVehicle Registration\n\nA shortage in the paper used to print titles led the South Dakota Department of Revenue’s Motor Vehicle Division to delay printing most paper titles effective November 9, 2022. States across the nation were experiencing paper supply issues. The paper used for printing titles is unique because it has built in security features to prevent fraud. All delayed titles have been printed and mailed to the vehicle owners.\n\nIf there is a lien on the vehicle title, the titles are held electronically until the loan is paid off and the financial institute sends notification to the Department that the lien has been released. At that time a paper title is mailed to the vehicle owner.\n\nIf you were previously issued a paper title but have misplaced and need a duplicate title, please complete the following form.\n\nDuplicate Title\n\nIf you have recently purchased a vehicle, titles must be updated within 45 days from the date of purchase.

No paper title will be printed while there is a lien noted, unless one of the exceptions in South Dakota law apply. SDCL 32-3-70\n\nHow Does the ELT System Work?\n\nLenders have the option to utilize a third-party provider that will provide electronic notices of title issuance and lien perfection when a record is issued in the state system. Upon the release of a lien, a participating lender will send a lien release electronically through its provider. Upon receipt of the electronic lien release, the title will be printed and mailed to the owner, unless directed otherwise by the lender. For more information on the Electronic Lien & Title system, take a look at the ELT Guide (PDF).\n\nNotation of Liens on Existing South Dakota Printed Titles\n\nTo have a lien noted on an outstanding title, the owner or lienholder shall present the original South Dakota certificate of title (or valid duplicate) and a copy of the security agreement to the titled owner’s county treasurer’s office. A lien notation fee of $10 must also be submitted. Note: the check or money order must be made out to the appropriate county treasurer (not to the Motor Vehicle Division).\n\nRelease of Liens on Printed South Dakota Titles\n\nThe signature of the lienholder on the face of the certificate of title is not needed if there is a notice of the satisfaction for liens noted on a South Dakota certificate of title. Note: while liens can be canceled in any county, lien notations must be made in the titled owner’s county of record.\n\nOn Titles Which Are Held by the Lienholder\n\nIt is the responsibility of the lienholder to have the lien against the record holder released by the county treasurer within 20 days after final payment. No fee is assessed for the release of a lien.\n\nOn Titles Which Are Held by the Owner\n\nIt is the responsibility of the lienholder to execute a release within 20 days after final payment is received. The lienholder shall mail or deliver the release to the owner. The certificate of title and lien release shall be forwarded by the owner to any county treasurer. No fee is assessed for the release of a lien.\n\nBonded Titles\n\nThe State of South Dakota allows customers with a vehicle 30 years old or older with no record on file to obtain a bonded title.\n\nRequest a Bonded Title\n\nTo start the process, a Bonded Title Request Form, along with a $2 fee for the record search, must be submitted to the Motor Vehicle Division office in Pierre, along with all necessary documentation indicated on the form or requested by the Motor Vehicle Division.\n\nIf no record is found, the Motor Vehicle Division will determine the vehicle’s value from the information submitted. If more information is needed, the vehicle may require an inspection by a Motor Vehicle Division Agent. Once the vehicle’s value is determined, the Motor Vehicle Division will complete and send back a Vehicle Valuation for Surety Bond form along with any other submitted paperwork.\n\nA bond must be purchased from a South Dakota surety bond company. Once purchased, the customer will submit all previously submitted documents, a completed Application for Motor Vehicle and Boat Title & Registration, and any applicable fees to their local county treasurer's office.
