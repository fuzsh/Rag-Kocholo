        "text": "Good morning from a grey Bristol. There is a cooling breeze. Is it my imagination or are the days shorter?\n\nAfter a very busy morning, doing a whole load of things at church before and after the service, I had a quiet day.\n\nOn my way back from church,I passed a house decorated with birthday balloons, they all proclaimed that the birthday person was 91. It puzzled me for a while as 91 is not normally much of a celebration. Suddenly, it occurred to me that the balloons were upside down and they were for a 16th birthday! üòÇ\n\nOff to Tesco this morning, then a whole load of administration etc., later.\n\nHave a good day. Carpe diem ü¶©ü¶©ü¶©ü¶©\n\nGood morning all from Polmont where it's currently 17¬∞, cloudy and windy. Not a nice day. Mick I hope you feel better today. GrandMattie I hope the birthday person had a good time, regardless of age!\n\nYesterday was a day in the kitchen mostly. Lentil soup made and a chicken and leek pie. I roasted six beetroot and will pickle them today. I visited mum in the afternoon and she was fairly chatty.\n\nToday is early childcare day. Shortly I'll head to dds and wait for the boys to get up. I'll take them to soft play again as the weather is not promising. That should tire them out! Have a good day all.\n\nGood morning, Michael and all GNs. Going to be a bright clear day in South Yorkshire. Sorry to hear you were poorly yesterday Mick - hope today is a better day for you.\n\nI had a quiet day yesterday but managed to get a walk in and picked a few more blackberries; chatted to a lady I hadn‚Äôt seen for a while. I cooked myself a good dinner and then had a phone call from DD and co in Canada where they had been paddling a canoe on Lake Louise. Photos looked amazing.\n\nToday I need to go out and look for some new shoes. This used to be a straightforward exercise but good shoe shops are becoming a thing of the past!\n\nHave the best day you can folks.\n\nGood morning from s somerset, it will be sunny and warm later\n\nA very satisfying day day yesterday, I thoroughly enjoyed my cycle ride, I seem to be stronger going up hills, not fast, just less effort on my legs, I still puff by the time I get to the top. I was home by 9.30, I love mornings most of all\n\nThen most of the day cutting a paper pattern and sewing a nightie. which I wore last night. Perfect, very pretty, cool and comfortable. Ankle length on me. A 3m ¬£10 remnant of pretty ecovera viscose, size M when a few years ago I was XL\n\nToday I have some tidying and will be sorting and clearing two bedroom drawers, it is about time I got rid of the XL stuff, I am not going back to that size. I can re-purpose a couple of things into underwear\n\nHave a good day\n\nMorning all from West Oxfordshire. Sorry you‚Äôve been under the weather Mick. I spent a lot of yesterday curled up under a blanke on the sofa.\n\nUsual Waitrose shop today. Then I must prepare the rooms for elder son and his family who are coming to stay while their bathroom is updated. Should be fun.\n\nOH popped over to see his bees yesterday. They have made lots more honey! We‚Äôve still got about 50 jars left of the last batch and ten of the previous batch.\n\nHave a good day.\n\nGood morning all from the South Coast! Looks like another lovely day today but that slight hint of dew around. Cleaned some of my silver spoons yesterday with a new dip basket. You put them in the basket in the pot and swirl them around for 3 minutes and rinse off. New sparkly spoons. Not done for ten years! Never use them.\n\nGood morning all from a wet Glasgow, where it is 17¬∞C\n\nI have had a dreadful night painwise and with coughing, so have had very little sleep. I am in a zombie state. üòâ\n\nYesterday was spent doing the chores, I planned for\n\ntoday, due to the fact that we unexpectedly have BabyD.\n\nHer mum was supposed to be off, but she is in the middle of a huge project for the Museum Service and has been called into work.\n\nBaby, expects only gourmet food, so she will be having banana and blueberry muffins for breakfast and home made soup for lunch, which I made for her yesterday, ü•∞ instead of chilling,.\n\nHeaven knows how we will keep her entertained, the weather is awful.\n\nI hope you feel better today, Mick.\n\nEnjoy your day folks.\n\nGood morning from a cloudy and breezy Torbay.\n\nYesterday, after church, we went to a local steam rally which was interesting and not too crowded as it was the third day of the event. It included classic cars and other vehicles from the past besides some impressive steam rollers and traction engines. I remember steam rollers from my childhood as part of the resurfacing of roads.\n\nI hope you continue to feel better today, Mick.\n\nGood luck at soft play, Grandmabatty: a good idea for energetic boys!\n\nI think the nights are drawing in a little, grandMattie.\n\nI hope your DD continues to improve, Gingster.\n\nHave a lovely day with the little one, Marydoll.\n\nHave a good week, everyone! ü¶©üíêü¶©üòéü¶©\n\nGood morning from Malta where it is already heating up for another scorcher of a day.\n\nYesterday I received a voicemail of a sad little voice crying for ‚ÄòNana‚Äô. Fortunately I had showered and dressed early so went over immediately and enjoyed a couple of hours with the boys before returning home in time to walk round the corner to Mass.\n\nHad a pleasant catch up chat with my friend in Leicester then watched the tennis final which didn‚Äôt go the way I‚Äôd hoped but so be it.\n\nThis morning I plan to go and buy some toys for the boys to keep at my house. Most of what I have belonged to DGD when she was here and they aren‚Äôt really into princesses and so forth.\n\nThey love playing in water so I shall get something appropriate.\n\nSo sorry to hear you felt so unwell yesterday Mick. Take it easy today. I hope you will feel better.\n\nWishing a good day to all.‚òÄÔ∏è\n\nGood morning everyone from a bright and sunny üåûNorthampton, but don't know how long it's going to stay like it, as a cloudy dull day is forecast. However I have got the towels in the washing machine and hope to get them out on the line before I go to yoga.\n\nNeed to get the bus to yoga this morning as the friend who gives me a lift is on grandma duty today.\n\nThen home to coffee and a few household jobs, hoovering downstairs being one of them, and then changing the bed.\n\nDS and elder DGD came down yesterday morning to use the shower while their boiler is broken. I got DS to put a new bulb in my oven while he was here.\n\nManaged to cut the back grass yesterday afternoon, then pulled up all the primroses which have kept reseeding over the years, and were looking the worse for wear and very untidy. I' sure more will re-appear next year!\n\nSpent the rest of the afternoon watching Olympics, then a lovely evening watching BBC4, which had a series of programmes about George Gershwin and his Rhapsody in Blue, culminating in the wonderful John Wilson conducting a Proms concert of American music, showcasing the piece.\n\nHave a good day everyone.\n\nGood morning everyone from Inverness where we‚Äôve fluffy white clouds and a blue sky. It rained quite a lot last night so the garden is well watered and refreshed\n\nSorry to hear you weren‚Äôt well yesterday Mick I hope you‚Äôre better today\n\nA bit of shopping in town today, we‚Äôre off on holiday in a couple of weeks and I‚Äôd like a few new things. I‚Äôll probably have to order online as the choice here is limited, but I like to browse the shops first.\n\nThinking of everyone with worries and struggles, hope today is gentle and take care all whatever the day brings üíê\n\nGood morning from a damp hillside in south Glos, it‚Äôs drizzling here and there‚Äôs a cool breeze.\n\nWe spent an hour hoicking out the overgrown irises in our small pond yesterday, and I hacked back the rampant water hyacinth so it‚Äôs looking very much better. DH has made a frame for the netting to keep the herons away.\n\nApart from that I didn‚Äôt do anything much other than the usual daily chores.\n\nDog and I had a nice walk late afternoon, it was very peaceful.\n\nI hope you feel better today Mick.\n\nHave a lovely day üåπ\n\nGood morning to you all.\n\nI watched an hour and a half of the very long first set of the men‚Äôs tennis final in Paris yesterday. Just as the tiebreak was about to commence to end the set, transmission was abruptly halted for a shooting contest. I was absolutely furious.\n\nI agree with GM that you certainly do have very nice feet Urms - your shade of nail varnish is very similar to the one I have. However I have unsightly bunions probably as a result of tottering around in heels throughout my 20‚Äôs so I won‚Äôt be posting a pic of mine. üòÇ\n\nI really must tackle some housework today. Have a good day everyone.\n\nGood morning from a dull South Downs, although sun all day is forecast. Cooler at 21c though. Quite pleasant.\n\nI‚Äôm managing to waste a lot of time lately watching the olympics. I always find myself watching and getting excited over sports that I never think about. The rowing always gets me jumping up and down, and of course this week the athletics.\n\nI must pot up a small acre today that I‚Äôve been nurturing since it was a twig. It will go in the little Japanese garden. I also have a miniature Japanese Cherry to pot up. But first the struggles to get the dead pot bound rhododendron out of the pot.\n\nMight have a barbecue tonight - I have some spare ribs to marinate. . First is housework day.. Hate housework day. but it keeps me active.\n\nmike hope you are feeling better today.\n\nllfl isn‚Äôt this the swarming season? Your DH will have to be on his guard!\n\nEnjoy your day all\n\nPeace and harmony for our poor country, and of course our world.\n\nGood morning and it‚Äôs another warm, sunny day here in Essex.\n\nNot much on today, so after going to the fields with little pooch, I‚Äôll tackle the housework. Haven‚Äôt done much as it‚Äôs been too hot and humid.\n\nHope you feel better today Mick.\n\nMarydoll sorry you had another bad night. Babydoll will keep you ‚Äòon your toes‚Äô but try to rest up when she has a nap. üë∂üèº. They are busy bees at that age.\n\nGlammagran that was so annoying with the tennis üò°.\n\nI hope peace is restored soon in our beautiful country üôè\n\nGood morning everyone from south Manchester where it‚Äôs pleasantly warm enough at 17¬∞C just no sunshine. Alexa tells me it will be 24¬∞C later. Nice.\n\nMy stepfather needs to go to his bank this morning. We will pick him up and then go for coffee. He too likes an opportunity for people watching! After we take him home we will pop in to say ‚Äòhi and bye, see you in M√°laga on Friday!‚Äô to the grandchildren.\n\nAs we are eating in tonight I plan a salad. üòÅ\n\nGood morning from a sunny W Kent.\n\nThe cleaner should arrive later and I need to tidy around before and during her visit. Later we really must have a walk as the weekend was lazy watching the Olympics. DD1 sent lovely pictures of a family gathering for her SIL in Scotland they look as though they have a clan of their own.\n\nHope you are better today Mick.\n\nBest wishes\n\nGood morning all from the Isle of Skye where there are huge puddles. The 10 min walk from the accommodation block to breakfast could be interesting ü§î wet\n\nSo far I've met some very nice fellow Gaelic students and enjoyed a wine and cheese evening.\n\nI will celebrate my 91st birthday gMattie if I make it - though no balloons. I believe every year is precious. You made me giggle.\n\nMarydoll you have been overdoing things again. Enjoy your time with baby doll.\n\nHope everyone has a good day.\n\nA sunny Suffolk good morning. We are expecting our boiler service man at 8.30. He has been a very reliable and helpful one for many years now but he always arrives early. So we must have our porridge now,throw a few clothes on and greet the day.\n\nWe plan a beach walk later,hopefully it won‚Äôt be as crowded as it would have been over the weekend.\n\nHope today is a sunny one for all‚Ä¶.I haven‚Äôt read the posts yet so hope the rest of us are having the lovely morning here in the East."
