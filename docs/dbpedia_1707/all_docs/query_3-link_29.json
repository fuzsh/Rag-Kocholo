        "text": "General Format\n\nWelcome to the Purdue OWL\n\nThis page is brought to you by the OWL at Purdue University. When printing this page, you must include the entire legal notice.\n\nCopyright ©1995-2018 by The Writing Lab & The OWL at Purdue and Purdue University. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, reproduced, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed without permission. Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our terms and conditions of fair use.\n\nSince The Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS) is primarily intended as a style guide for published works rather than class papers, these guidelines will be supplemented with information from, Kate L. Turabian’s Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations (8th ed.), which is largely based on CMOS with some slight alterations.\n\nTo see a side-by-side comparison of the three most widely used citation styles, including a chart of all CMOS citation guidelines, see the Citation Style Chart.\n\nPlease use the example at the bottom of this page to cite the Purdue OWL in CMOS.\n\nA Note on Citations\n\nUnlike many citation styles, CMOS gives writers two different methods for documenting sources: the Author-Date System and the Notes-Bibliography (NB) System. As its name suggests, Author-Date uses parenthetical citations in the text to reference the source's author's last name and the year of publication. Each parenthetical citation corresponds to an entry on a References page that concludes the document. In these regards, Author-Date is very similar to, for instance, APA style.\n\nBy contrast, NB uses numbered footnotes in the text to direct the reader to a shortened citation at the bottom of the page. This corresponds to a fuller citation on a Bibliography page that concludes the document. Though the general principles of citation are the same here, the citations themselves are formatted differently from the way they appear in Author-Date.\n\nIf you are using CMOS for school or work, don't forget to ensure that you're using your organization's preferred citation method. For examples of these two different styles in action, see our CMOS sample papers:\n\nAuthor-Date Sample Paper\n\nNB Sample Paper\n\nGeneral CMOS Guidelines\n\nText should be consistently double-spaced, except for block quotations, notes, bibliography entries, table titles, and figure captions.\n\nFor block quotations, which are also called extracts:\n\nA prose quotation of five or more lines, or more than 100 words, should be blocked.\n\nCMOS recommends blocking two or more lines of poetry.\n\nA blocked quotation does not get enclosed in quotation marks.\n\nA blocked quotation must always begin a new line.\n\nBlocked quotations should be indented with the word processor’s indention tool.\n\nPage numbers begin in the header of the first page of text with Arabic number 1.\n\nSubheadings should be used for longer papers.\n\nCMOS recommends you devise your own format but use consistency as your guide.\n\nFor CMOS and Turabian’s recommendations, see “Headings,” below.\n\nSupplemental Turabian Style Guidelines\n\nMargins should be set at no less than 1”.\n\nTypeface should be something readable, such as Times New Roman or Courier.\n\nFont size should be no less than 10 pt. (preferably, 12 pt.).\n\nMajor Paper Sections\n\nTitle Page\n\nAccording to Turabian style, class papers will either include a title page or include the title on the first page of the text. Use the following guidelines should your instructor or context require a title page:\n\nThe title should be centered a third of the way down the page.\n\nYour name, class information, and the date should follow several lines later.\n\nFor subtitles, end the title line with a colon and place the subtitle on the line below the title.\n\nDouble-space each line of the title page.\n\nDifferent practices apply for theses and dissertations (see Kate L. Turabian’s A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, ad Dissertations [8th ed.].\n\nMain Body\n\nTitles mentioned in the text, notes, or bibliography are capitalized “headline-style,” meaning first words of titles and subtitles and any important words thereafter should be capitalized.\n\nTitles in the text as well as in notes and bibliographies are treated with quotation marks or italics based on the type of work they name.\n\nBook and periodical titles (titles of larger works) should be italicized.\n\nArticle and chapter titles (titles of shorter works) should be enclosed in double quotation marks.\n\nThe titles of most poems should be enclosed in double quotation marks, but the titles of very long poems should be italicized.\n\nTitles of plays should be italicized.\n\nOtherwise, take a minimalist approach to capitalization.\n\nFor example, use lowercase terms to describe periods, except in the case of proper nouns (e.g., “the colonial period,” vs. “the Victorian era”).\n\nA prose quotation of five or more lines should be “blocked.” The block quotation should match the surrounding text, and it takes no quotation marks. To offset the block quote from surrounding text, indent the entire quotation using the word processor’s indentation tool. It is also possible to offset the block quotation by using a different or smaller font than the surrounding text.\n\nIn Flowers of Freedom: Reframing Political Thought, Rose eloquently sums up his argument in the following quotation:\n\nIn a society of control, a politics of conduct is\n\ndesigned into the fabric of existence itself, into the\n\norganization of space, time, visibility, circuits of\n\ncommunication. And these enwrap each individual life\n\ndecision and action—about labour [sic], purchases, debts,\n\ncredits, lifestyle, sexual contracts and the like—in a web\n\nof incitements, rewards, current sanctions and foreboding\n\nof future sanctions which serve to enjoin citizens to\n\nmaintain particular types of control over their conduct.\n\nThese assemblages which entail the securitization of\n\nidentity are not unified, but dispersed, not hierarchical\n\nbut rhizomatic, not totalized but connected in a web or\n\nrelays and relations. (246)\n\nReferences\n\nLabel the first page of your back matter, your comprehensive list of sources, “Bibliography” (for Notes and Bibliography style) or “References” (for Author-Date style).\n\nLeave two blank lines between “Bibliography” or “References” and your first entry.\n\nLeave one blank line between remaining entries.\n\nList entries in letter-by-letter alphabetical order according to the first word in each entry, be that the author's name or the title of the piece..\n\nUse “and,” not an ampersand, “&,” for multi-author entries.\n\nFor two to three authors, write out all names.\n\nFor four to ten authors, write out all names in the bibliography but only the first author’s name plus “et al.” in notes and parenthetical citations.\n\nWhen a source has no identifiable author, cite it by its title, both on the references page and in shortened form (up to four keywords from that title) in parenthetical citations throughout the text.\n\nWrite out publishers’ names in full.\n\nDo not use access dates unless publication dates are unavailable.\n\nIf you cannot ascertain the publication date of a printed work, use the abbreviation “n.d.”\n\nProvide DOIs instead of URLs whenever possible.\n\nIf no DOI is available, provide a URL.\n\nIf you cannot name a specific page number when called for, you have other options: section (sec.), equation (eq.), volume (vol.), or note (n.).\n\nFootnotes\n\nNote numbers should begin with “1” and follow consecutively throughout a given paper.\n\nIn the text:\n\nNote numbers are superscripted.\n\nNote numbers should be placed at the end of the clause or sentence to which they refer and should be placed after all punctuation, except for the dash.\n\nIn the footnotes:\n\nNote numbers are full-sized, not raised, and followed by a period (superscripting note numbers in the notes themselves is also acceptable).\n\nLines within a footnote should be formatted flush left. Place commentary after source documentation when a footnote contains both; separate commentary and documentation by a period.\n\nIn parenthetical citation, separate documentation from brief commentary with a semicolon.\n\nDo not repeat the hundreds digit in a page range if it does not change from the beginning to the end of the range.\n\nFor more information on footnotes, please see CMOS NB Sample Paper.\n\nHeadings\n\nWhile The Chicago Manual of Style does not include a prescribed system for formatting headings and subheads, it makes several recommendations.\n\nMaintain consistency and parallel structure in headings and subheads.\n\nUse headline-style for purposes of capitalization.\n\nSubheadings should begin on a new line.\n\nSubheadings can be distinguished by font-size.\n\nEnsure that each level of hierarchy is clear and consistent.\n\nLevels of subheads can be differentiated by type style, use of boldface or italics, and placement on the page, usually either centered or flush left.\n\nUse no more than three levels of hierarchy.\n\nAvoid ending subheadings with periods.\n\nTurabian has an optional system of five heading levels.\n\nTurabian Subheading Plan\n\nHere is an example of the five-level heading system:\n\nTables and Figures\n\nPosition tables and figures as soon as possible after they are first referenced. If necessary, present them after the paragraph in which they are described.\n\nFor figures, include a caption, or short explanation of the figure or illustration, directly after the figure number.\n\nCite the source of the table and figure information with a “credit line” at the bottom of the table or figure and, if applicable, after the caption. The credit line should be distinguished from the caption by being enclosed in parenthesis or written in different type.\n\nCite a source as you would for parenthetical citation, and include full information in an entry on your Bibliography or References page.\n\nAcknowledge reproduced or adapted sources appropriately (i.e., photo by; data adapted from; map by...).\n\nIf a table includes data not acquired by the author of the text, include an unnumbered footnote. Introduce the note by the word Source(s) followed by a colon, then include the full source information, and end the note with a period.\n\nHow to Cite the Purdue OWL in CMOS\n\nOn the new OWL site, contributors’ names and the last edited date are no longer listed at the top of every page. This means that most citations will now begin with the title of the resource, rather than the contributors' names.\n\nFootnote or Endnote (N):\n\n1. “Title of Resource,” List the OWL as Publishing Organization/Web Site Name, https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/717/02/.\n\n1. “General Format,” The Purdue OWL, https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/717/02/.\n\nCorresponding Bibliographical Entry (B):\n\n“Title of Resource.” List the OWL as Publishing Organization/Web Site Name. http://Web address for OWL resource.\n\n“General Format.” The Purdue OWL. https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/717/02/.\n\nAuthor Date In-text Citation:\n\n(\"Title\" Year of publication).\n\n(\"General Format\" 2017).\n\nAuthor Date References Page Citation:\n\nYear of Publication. “Title of Resource.” List the OWL as Publishing Organization/Web Site Name. http://Web address for OWL resource.\n\n2017. “General Format.” The Purdue OWL. https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/717/02."
