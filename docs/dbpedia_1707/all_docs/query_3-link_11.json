        "text": "Interrogative title\n\nThis is the one which has a query or the research question in the title.[3,4,16] Though a query in the title has the ability to sensationalize the topic, and has more downloads (but less citations), it can be distracting to the reader and is again best avoided for a research article (but can, at times, be used for a review article).[3,6,16,17]\n\nFrom a sentence construct point of view, titles may be nominal (capturing only the main theme of the study), compound (with subtitles to provide additional relevant information such as context, design, location/country, temporal aspect, sample size, importance, and a provocative or a literary; for example, see the title of this review), or full-sentence titles (which are longer and indicate an added degree of certainty of the results).[4,6,9,16] Any of these constructs may be used depending on the type of article, the key message, and the author's preference or judgement.[4]\n\nStructured and unstructured abstracts\n\nStructured abstracts are followed by most journals, are more informative, and include specific subheadings/subsections under which the abstract needs to be composed.[1,7,8,9,10,11,13,17,18] These subheadings usually include context/background, objectives, design, setting, participants, interventions, main outcome measures, results, and conclusions.[1] Some journals stick to the standard IMRAD format for the structure of the abstracts, and the subheadings would include Introduction/Background, Methods, Results, And (instead of Discussion) the Conclusion/s.[1,2,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,17,18] Structured abstracts are more elaborate, informative, easy to read, recall, and peer-review, and hence are preferred; however, they consume more space and can have same limitations as an unstructured abstract.[7,9,18] The structured abstracts are (possibly) better understood by the reviewers and readers. Anyway, the choice of the type of the abstract and the subheadings of a structured abstract depend on the particular journal style and is not left to the author's wish.[7,10,12] Separate subheadings may be necessary for reporting meta-analysis, educational research, quality improvement work, review, or case study.[1] Clinical trial abstracts need to include the essential items mentioned in the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials) guidelines.[7,9,14,19] Similar guidelines exist for various other types of studies, including observational studies and for studies of diagnostic accuracy.[20,21] A useful resource for the above guidelines is available at www.equator-network.org (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research). Unstructured (or non-structured) abstracts are free-flowing, do not have predefined subheadings, and are commonly used for papers that (usually) do not describe original research.[1,7,9,10]\n\nThe four-point structured abstract: This has the following elements which need to be properly balanced with regard to the content/matter under each subheading:[9]\n\nBackground and/or Objectives: This states why the work was undertaken and is usually written in just a couple of sentences.[3,7,8,9,10,12,13] The hypothesis/study question and the major objectives are also stated under this subheading.[3,7,8,9,10,12,13]\n\nMethods: This subsection is the longest, states what was done, and gives essential details of the study design, setting, participants, blinding, sample size, sampling method, intervention/s, duration and follow-up, research instruments, main outcome measures, parameters evaluated, and how the outcomes were assessed or analyzed.[3,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,17]\n\nResults/Observations/Findings: This subheading states what was found, is longer, is difficult to draft, and needs to mention important details including the number of study participants, results of analysis (of primary and secondary objectives), and include actual data (numbers, mean, median, standard deviation, “P” values, 95% confidence intervals, effect sizes, relative risks, odds ratio, etc.).[3,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,17]\n\nConclusions: The take-home message (the “so what” of the paper) and other significant/important findings should be stated here, considering the interpretation of the research question/hypothesis and results put together (without overinterpreting the findings) and may also include the author's views on the implications of the study.[3,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,17]\n\nThe eight-point structured abstract: This has the following eight subheadings – Objectives, Study Design, Study Setting, Participants/Patients, Methods/Intervention, Outcome Measures, Results, and Conclusions.[3,9,18] The instructions to authors given by the particular journal state whether they use the four- or eight-point abstract or variants thereof.[3,14]"
