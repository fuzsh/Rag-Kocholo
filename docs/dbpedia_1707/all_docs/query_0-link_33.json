The Most Common Ways to Say Goodbye in Finnish\n\nIf you’re just after a quick translation for the word goodbye in Finnish, look no further. We’ll cover the most common formal and informal ways to say goodbye before moving on to other useful expressions. However, we really recommend sticking around until the end—there are numerous phrases to learn that are guaranteed to come in handy!\n\n1 – Goodbye\n\nWhen saying goodbye, there’s one word that you can safely use in almost any situation:\n\nNäkemiin. (“Goodbye.”)\n\nThis expression is derived from the word nähdä (“to see”), and its literal meaning is “until seeing.” It’s a polite way to say goodbye, so you can use it whenever you’re talking to older people or those you don’t know very well.\n\nThe equivalent expression to use when ending a phone call is:\n\nKuulemiin. (“Goodbye.”)\n\nThis one is derived from the word kuulla (“to hear”) and literally means “until hearing.”\n\n2 – Bye\n\nNow that we’ve covered the formal way to say goodbye, let’s see how to say a more informal “bye.” Actually, the words in this section embody how to say hello and goodbye in Finnish—they can be used for both purposes!\n\nHei (“Hi” / “Bye”)\n\nMoi (“Hi” / “Bye”)\n\nHowever, the words above can sound a little abrupt when parting, and it’s more common to use these longer variants when taking leave:\n\nHei hei (“Bye-bye”)\n\nMoi moi (“Bye-bye”)\n\nThese Finnish phrases for goodbye are neutral expressions and are very common in Finland. They can be used in a variety of situations, from business meetings to coffee dates with friends.\n\nAnd finally, these two words are more casual versions of hei and moi:\n\nHeippa (“Hi” / “Bye”)\n\nMoikka (“Hi” / “Bye”)\n\nHei hei, nähdään koulun jälkeen. (“Bye-bye, see you after school.”)\n\n2. Specific Ways to Say Goodbye\n\nNow you know the most essential expressions, but let’s not leave it there! Now we’re going to learn a number of phrases that will take your goodbyes to the next level.\n\n1 – See you!\n\nThe Finnish equivalent to the casual expression “see you” is the verb nähdä (“to see”) in its passive form:\n\nNähdään! (“See you!”)\n\nNähdään taas. (“See you again.”)\n\nYou can use this expression with people you know well, and whom you expect to see again sometime. Here are a few different variations you can use in case you want to be a bit more specific about when you plan to see them again:\n\nNähdään pian. (“See you soon.”)\n\nNähdään myöhemmin. (“See you later.”)\n\nNähdään huomenna. (“See you tomorrow.”)\n\nNähdään ensi viikolla. (“See you next week.”)\n\nNähdään maanantaina. (“See you on Monday.”)\n\nYou can customize that final phrase by using any other day of the week—just add the ending -na to the name of the weekday. In case you need a refresher on how to say the days of the week in Finnish, you’ll find them all on this vocabulary list.\n\nOther verbs can also be used in a similar way. Take, for example, the humorous phrase below, using the verb törmäillä (“to repeatedly bump into something”) in the passive form:\n\nTörmäillään! (“See you!”)\n\nLearn more about the passive voice in Finnish on Wikipedia.\n\nIt’s a date!\n\n2 – Until next time!\n\nHere are some more examples of how to say goodbye in Finland when you expect to meet someone again. In these expressions, the noun is in the illative case.\n\nEnsi kertaan! (“Until next time!”)\n\nSeuraavaan kertaan! (“Until next time!”)\n\nNote that the word ensi can mean either “the first” or “the next,” depending on the context. For example, ensi-ilta refers to the premiere or opening (i.e. the first) night of a film or theater production. In contrast, seuraava always means “the next.”\n\nUsing the same form, you can also refer to meeting someone the next day, for example:\n\nHuomiseen! (“Until tomorrow!”)\n\nEnsi viikkoon! (“Until next week!”)\n\n3 – Keep well.\n\nIt’s nice to wish somebody well when saying goodbye! Let’s take a look at a couple of ways to do just that.\n\nThe verb voida is used to express how someone is feeling or doing. Using the imperative mood, you can use this verb to wish someone well, particularly when you’re not going to see them for a while:\n\nVoi hyvin. (“Keep well.”)\n\nYou can also use the word pärjäillä (“to be fine” / “to do okay”) when you want to wish someone well. These expressions are especially relevant when the other person is going through challenging times (though the first one can also be neutral):\n\nPärjäile. (“Hang in there.”)\n\nKoita pärjätä. (“Try to hang in there.”)\n\nWant to wish them all the best? Say this:\n\nKaikkea hyvää.\n\n(“All the best.”)\n\nKoita pärjätä. (“Try to hang in there.”)\n\n4 – It was nice to see you.\n\nHere’s how to tell someone that you’ve enjoyed your time with them:\n\nOli kiva nähdä. (“It was nice to see you.”)\n\nNote that the Finnish sentence doesn’t actually include the words “it” (se) and “you” (sinä). A literal translation would be: “Was nice to see.”\n\nHere are a couple of similar expressions:\n\nOli hauska tutustua. (“It was fun to meet you.”)\n\nOli mukava jutella. (“It was lovely to chat with you.”)\n\nWould you like to construct more sentences like those above to suit a specific situation? Look up more verbs in Finnish on our most common verbs list.\n\n5 – Let’s keep in touch.\n\nHave you made a nice Finnish friend and want to chat again? Here are a few Finnish goodbye phrases you can use to say so. Remember nähdään (“see you”)? Again, we’re going to use the passive form of our chosen verb:\n\nPidetään yhteyttä. (“Let’s keep in touch.”)\n\nPalataan asiaan. (“Let’s get back to it.”)\n\nPalaillaan. (“Let’s get back to it.” – A casual alternative to the phrase above.)\n\nSoitellaan. (“Let’s keep calling.”)\n\nKirjoitellaan. (“Let’s keep writing.”)\n\nSoitellaan. (“Let’s keep calling.”)\n\n6 – Have a nice day.\n\nHere are a few different ways to tell someone to have a nice time as you part ways:\n\nHyvää päivän jatkoa. (“Have a nice day onwards.”)\n\nHauskaa iltaa. (“Have a fun evening.” – Used especially when the other person has special plans.)\n\nHyvää illan jatkoa. (“Have a nice evening onwards.”)\n\nHyvää yötä. (“Goodnight.”)\n\nHyvää viikonloppua. (“Have a nice weekend.”)\n\nHyvää lomaa. (“Have a nice vacation.”)\n\nNote that the word jatko in päivän jatkoa and illan jatkoa refers to a “continuation” of the day or evening. You can use the word jatko by itself, too. This expression is suited for situations when you’re not going to see the other person for a while:\n\nHyvää jatkoa. (“All the best in the future.”)\n\nHyvää yötä! (“Goodnight!”)\n\n7 – Farewell.\n\nTread carefully! This is an expression that you should only really use if you never expect (or intend) to see someone again:\n\nHyvästi. (“Farewell.”)\n\nThis word is derived from the word hyvä (“good”), and it’s used as a common way to wish someone well when parting. So why does it have a somewhat negative connotation now? The meaning of the word changed during wartime—because you couldn’t be sure if you would ever see your loved ones again, the expression became associated with a permanent parting of ways. Nowadays, hyvästi is rarely used in Finland, and it sounds fairly formal.\n\nHyvästi means goodbye forever.\n\n8 – Saying goodbye in an email or letter\n\nWhat about saying goodbye in writing? Here are a couple of ways to close an email or letter in Finnish:\n\nTerveisin. (“Best wishes.”)\n\nYstävällisin terveisin. (“Kind regards.”)\n\nRakkaudella. (“Much love.”)\n\nKiittäen. (“Thanks.”)\n\nYou can learn more Finnish expressions to use in emails and letters on here.\n\n3. Goodbye Gestures in Finland\n\nSo now you’ve learned a lot of goodbye expressions, but what about goodbye gestures?\n\nA simple wave of the hand works in any casual situation, whereas a brief and firm handshake is commonplace when saying goodbye in formal situations. Hugging is common among close friends, family members, and romantic partners, while French-style cheek kisses are not used in Finland.\n\nWant to learn more about Finnish customs and manners?
