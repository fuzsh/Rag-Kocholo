See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section “Registration Procedures., and Circular 4, Copyright Office Fees”.\n\nWhere can I get application forms?\n\nSee Forms.\n\nCan I file online?\n\nYes. We offer online registration through our electronic Copyright Office (eCO). See Circular 2, Copyright Registration.\n\nCan I choose any title when registering my work?\n\nYes, you can choose any title to identify the work you are registering.\n\nNote: Titles are not protected by copyright law. Further, all information on the application should be factually accurate, as it forms the basis for the registration record.\n\nOur current system only accepts titles containing Roman letters and/or Arabic numerals. It does not accept other types of letters, numerals, or characters, such as Cyrillic or Mandarin. It also does not accept diacritical marks, such as ç, à, ñ, or ü.\n\nFor more information, see section 610.6(C) of the Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, Third Edition.\n\nAre there specific requirements regarding the title of my work that I should know when completing my application?\n\nYou should not provide generic titles, such as “Untitled,” “No Title,” “Working Title,” or “No title yet,” as the title of the work. Works registered with generic titles may be difficult to find in the public record.\n\nAdditionally, our current system only accepts titles containing Roman letters and/or Arabic numerals. It does not accept other types of letters, numerals, or characters, such as Cyrillic or Mandarin. It also does not accept diacritical marks, such as ç, à, ñ, or ü.\n\nNote: The information on the application should be factually accurate, as it forms the basis for the registration record.\n\nFor more information, see sections 610.6(A) and 610.6(C) of the Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices, Third Edition.\n\nWhat is the registration fee?\n\nSee Circular 4, Copyright Fees.\n\nDo you take credit cards?\n\nIf you file your application online using eCO eService, you may pay by credit card. Credit cards are not accepted for registration through the mail, but may be used for registrations that are filed in person in the Copyright Office. There are other services for which the Copyright Office will accept a credit card payment. For more information see Circular 4, Copyright Fees.\n\nDo I have to send in my work? Do I get it back?\n\nYou must send the required copy or copies of the work to be registered. Your copies will not be returned. If you register online using eCO eService, you may attach an electronic copy of your deposit. However, even if you register online, if the Library of Congress requires a hard-copy deposit of your work, you must send what the Library defines as the “best edition” of your work. For further information, see Circular 7b, Best Edition of Published Copyrighted Works for the Collection of the Library of Congress, and Circular 7d, Mandatory Deposit of Copies or Phonorecords for the Library of Congress. Upon their deposit in the Copyright Office, under sections 407 and 408 of the copyright law, all copies and identifying material, including those deposited in connection with claims that have been refused registration, are the property of the U.S. government.\n\nHow do I know whether to submit electronic or hard copies of my work?\n\nAn electronic copy can be uploaded and is strongly encouraged when:\n\nYour work is unpublished.\n\nYour work was published ONLY in electronic format (such as an ebook released solely as a download) and NOT in a physical format (such as a hardcover or paperback book).\n\nYour work was published and identifying material is permitted or required (instead of sending a complete copy of the work). For more information, see section 1506, chapter 1500, of the Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices Third Edition.\n\nYour work is first published abroad in electronic format regardless of whether it was later published in a physical format.\n\nYou are registering a musical work that was published solely in an audio format (such as a CD, LP, or digital audio file) but was not published in a printed format, such as sheet music.\n\nYou are registering an architectural work.\n\nYou are seeking a group registration for:\n\nUp to 20 musical works that were published on the same album\n\nUp to 20 sound recordings and any photographs, artwork, or liner notes that were first published on the same album, if the album was distributed solely in a digital format and was not distributed in a physical format (such as CD, LP, etc.)\n\nUp to 750 photographs (published or unpublished)\n\nA electronic deposit must be submitted when:\n\nYou are seeking a group registration for:\n\nUp to 10 unpublished works\n\nUp to 3 months of issues from a serial publication, such as a magazine or journal\n\nA month of issues from the same newspaper or newsletter\n\nA group of works created by an individual author that were first published in a periodical\n\nA group of short online literary works created by an individual authors that were first published online\n\nA group of items prepared for use in a secure test\n\nA physical deposit must be submitted when:\n\nYour work was first published in the United States BEFORE you submitted your claim to the Copyright Office, and the work was published in a physical format, such as a compact disc, DVD, or a paperback book\n\nYou work was first published in the United States BEFORE you submitted your claim to the Copyright Office, and the work was published BOTH in a physical AND an electronic format (such as a sound recording that was released both on compact disc and as a download)\n\nYour work was first published abroad BEFORE you submitted your claim to the Copyright Office, and the work was first published in a physical format, such as a compact disc, DVD, or a paperback book\n\nWill my deposit be damaged by security measures in place on Capitol Hill?\n\nTo avoid damage to your hard-copy deposit caused by necessary security measures, package the following items in boxes rather than envelopes for mailing to the Copyright Office:\n\nelectronic media such as audiocassettes, videocassettes, CDs, and DVDs\n\nmicroform\n\nphotographs\n\nslick advertisements, color photocopies, and other print items\n\nMay I register more than one work on the same application?\n\nGenerally, you may only register one work per application but there are several exceptions to this rule. Each exception has strict eligibility requirements. If you do not meet or comply with these requirements the Office may contact you, which will delay the registration decision, or the Office may refuse registration. See Circular 34, Multiple Works, for specific information on the exceptions for registering multiple works with one application.\n\nDo I have to use my real name on the form? Can I use a stage name or a pen name?\n\nThere is no legal requirement that the author be identified by his or her real name on the application form. For further information, see FL 101, Pseudonyms. If filing under a fictitious name, check the “Pseudonymous” box when giving information about the authors.\n\nWill my personal information be available to the public?\n\nYes. Please be aware that when you register your claim to a copyright in a work with the U.S. Copyright Office, you are making a public record. All the information you provide on your copyright registration is available to the public and will be available on the Internet.\n\nHow long does the registration process take, and when will I receive my certificate?\n\nThe time the Copyright Office requires to process an application varies, depending on the number of applications the Office is receiving and clearing at the time of submission and the extent of questions associated with the application. Current Processing Times\n\nCan I submit my manuscript on a computer disk?\n\nNo. Floppy disks and other removal media such as Zip disks, except for CD-ROMs, are not acceptable. Therefore, the Copyright Office still generally requires a printed copy or audio recording of the work for deposit. However, if you register online using eCO eService, you may attach an electronic copy of your deposit. However, even if you register online, if the Library of Congress requires a hard-copy deposit of your work, you must send what the Library defines as the \"best edition\" of your work. For further information, see Circular 7b, Best Edition of Published Copyrighted Works for the Collection of the Library of Congress, and Circular 7d, Mandatory Deposit of Copies or Phonorecords for the Library of Congress.\n\nCan I submit a CD-ROM of my work?\n\nYes. The deposit requirement consists of the best edition of the CD-ROM package of any work, including the accompanying operating software, instruction manual, and a printed version, if included in the package.\n\nDoes my work have to be published to be protected?\n\nPublication is not necessary for copyright protection.\n\nHow much do I have to change in my own work to make a new claim of copyright?\n\nYou may make a new claim in your work if the changes are substantial and creative, something more than just editorial changes or minor changes. This would qualify as a new derivative work. For instance, simply making spelling corrections throughout a work does not warrant a new registration, but adding an additional chapter would. See Circular 14, Copyright Registration in Derivative Works and Compilations, for further information.\n\nDo you have special mailing requirements?\n\nIf you register online, you may attach an electronic copy of your deposit unless a hard-copy deposit is required under the \"Best Edition\" requirements of the Library of Congress. See Circular 7b. If you file using a paper application, our only requirement is that all three elements—the application, the copy or copies of the work, and the filing fee—be sent in the same package. Please limit any individual box to 20 pounds. Many people send their material to us by certified mail, with a return receipt request, but this is not required."
