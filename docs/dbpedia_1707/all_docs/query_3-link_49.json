The vehicle cannot have been previously titled in K.Y. The vehicle can come into Kentucky on an out-of-state title/bill of sale/affidavit of ownership but cannot bear any brands such as salvage, rebuilt water damage, or hail damage. Must also have a sheriff's inspection for VIN verification and ownership documents.​\n\n​After a classic motor vehicle project vehicle has been restored to roadworthy condition, the customer takes the vehicle and the classic project title to the Sheriff's office for an inspection. The vehicle is required to meet the requirements of KRS 189 about vehicle equipment. After passing the K.Y. sheriff's inspection for roadworthy condition, the owner vehicle can apply for a new original certificate of title and registration. Contact your County Clerk's office​.\n\n​In the sale of a vehicle, the seller must sign the back of the title in the presence of a notary. This will sign over ownership of the vehicle. The buyer takes the signed title, proof of Kentucky Insurance, proof of Identification, and money for fees and applicable taxes to their local County Clerk's office for transfer. Older Titles before 2000 may require a completed TC96-182​ to complete the transfer process.\n\n​You will need to notify your County Clerk's office of the name and state of the new owner. You will need to complete form TC96-3 Affidavit of Incomplete Transfer​ if the vehicle has not been transferred within 15 days. You will also need to return the Kentucky license plate to your Kentucky County Clerk's office. If you were a resident of Kentucky and the vehicle owner on January 1st, you might have property taxes due on that vehicle.\n\nIf you suspect fraudulent title practices by Dealers or Private Sellers within the Commonwealth of Kentucky, please email us​\n\n​\n\nPOLICE IMPOUND\n\nFor vehicles that are purchased from the police impound by an individual, a completed Application for Kentucky Certificate of Title or Registration (TC 96-182 form), A Bill of Sale on law enforcements letterhead (stipulating compliance with KRS 82.630), certified mail notifying registered owner(s) and lienholder(s), and a sheriff inspection if vehicle is coming from out of state.
