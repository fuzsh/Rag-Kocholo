        "text": "Just as there are a number of ways to greet someone “Hello” in Mandarin, there are also just as many ways to say “Goodbye”. In fact, in Chinese, there are quite a number of equivalents to English’s “Bye bye”, “See you”, “Farewell”, and all other sayings that mean you are parting ways, even if just for a little while. Let’s explore some of these different ways to say goodbye in Chinese below:\n\n1. 再见 [zài jiàn]\n\n再见 literally means “See you again”, and is the most common way to say goodbye. Most of us learned this word in our first Chinese class, right?\n\n2. 拜拜 [bài bài]\n\n拜拜, a phonetic translation of English’s ‘bye bye’, this is a more casual and common way to say goodbye.\n\n3. (有空)再会 [(yǒu kòng) zàihuì]\n\n会means “meet”, so 再会means “Until we meet again” (which is quite similar to 再见)\n\n4. 再联系 [zài liánxì]\n\n再, as we’ve said, means “again”, and 联系means “contact”. So, 再联系means “Let’s stay in touch” or “Let`s make contact with each other again”.\n\n5. 告辞 [gào cí]\n\nIt means “I’m leaving”, and is a formal way to announce one’s departure.\n\n6. 失陪 [shī péi]\n\nThis is very formal, and can be translated to mean “Excuse me, but I must be leaving now.” We also say “失陪一下”which means “Excuse me, but I must leave you for a while.”\n\n7. (_______ )见 [jiàn]\n\nAll the phrases we mentioned above are vague about the exact time of departure. So, there is a very practical pattern about how to say “see you” at an exact time. As we have mentioned, 见 means “see”. So if we add a relatively exact time before 见, it means “see you” at that certain point in time. For example:"
