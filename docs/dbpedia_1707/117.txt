But how dem tink say Russia fit help dem in any way, Abudlahhi tok say: "We see Russia as a global power. So if di kontris wey bin colonise us like UK and US just dey watch and no do anything, sake of say our leaders dey loyal to dem, why we di ordinary citizens no go turn to anoda country wey we believe say dem fit come to our aid?"

E give example wit Nigeria neighbour, Niger Republic and Mali. Both kontris dey under military rule and dem don turn away from dia bifor bifor Western allies to embrace Russia.
