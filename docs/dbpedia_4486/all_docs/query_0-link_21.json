Aurora theater shooting. Tucson supermarket shooting.\n\nAre visceral reactions to tragedies trumping the words of our forefathers?\n\nShould we allow fear and the growing concern over public safety to limit our civil liberties?\n\nDead Patriot Films presents “Assaulted: Civil Rights Under Fire,” a documentary that brings audiences to the center of the controversy over the issue that is dividing our nation – gun control. Narrated by Ice-T, a critically acclaimed rapper and actor, the film takes a critical look at current gun laws and the rising movement to restrict the rights guaranteed by our Second Amendment.\n\nWith the original intention of empowering a citizenry’s ability to defend themselves against a corrupt or tyrannical government, the concept today may seem farfetched or the makings of a Hollywood blockbuster. However, it has happened throughout U.S. history. And long before gun control was positioned as a “common sense measure” to combat violence, it was used as a means to oppress certain minority groups. Presently, the growing trend in gun control favors the wealthy and privileged, who leverage their connections to ensure their Second Amendment rights and safety, while those of lesser means struggle.\n\nInformative and emotionally charged, “Assaulted: Civil Rights Under Fire” is an eye-opening look at the genesis of the Second Amendment to the Constitution, leading the audience to rethink the issues surrounding gun control, and the effect on civil rights and liberty.\n\nAfter all, what you don’t know can kill you.\n\nAPPEARANCES\n\n§ Ted Nugent – Rock Star and Second Amendment Advocate\n\n§ Chris Cheng – Professional Marksman & Winner, “Top Shot” Season Four\n\n§ Dan Gross – President, Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence\n\n§ Bobbie Ross – Civil Rights Lawyer & Chair, American Bar Association’s 2nd Amendment Committee\n\n§ Alan Gottlieb – Founder, Second Amendment Foundation\n\n§ Eugene Volokh, Ph.D. – Professor UCLA School of Law & Blogger, “The Volokh Conspiracy”\n\n§ Adam Winkler, Ph.D. – Professor UCLA School of Law & Author, “Gun Fight”\n\n§ David Kopel, Ph.D. – Research Director, Independence Institute\n\n§ Margot Bennett – Executive Director, Women Against Gun Violence\n\n§ Alan Gura, Esq. – Civil Rights Lawyer Attorney, Lead Counsel for Heller (District of Columbia v.
