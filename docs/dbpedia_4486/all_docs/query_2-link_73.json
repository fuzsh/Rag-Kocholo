        "text": "According to Chapter 134 of the Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes, “Firearms, Ammunition and Dangerous Weapons,” all firearms in Hawaiʻi must be registered whether or not they are serviceable and no matter how they are acquired. The following exceptions apply:\n\nRegistration is not mandatory for rifles and shotguns acquired in the state of Hawaiʻi prior to July 1994. However, one permit per rifle or shotgun was required for acquisitions between 1981 and July 1994.\n\nRegistration is not required for firearms designed to fire loose black powder and for firearms manufactured before 1899, but permits are required.\n\nHowever, all firearms imported into Hawaiʻi from out of state must be registered. See Registration of Firearms for more information.\n\nOn the Big Island, residents must register their firearms with the Hawaiʻi Police Department. Residents may apply for a permit to acquire a firearm or register their firearms at their district police station.\n\nBelow are the steps you must follow to acquire, register, and transfer possession of firearms and the hours during which you can register:\n\nPermit to Acquire\n\nIneligibility\n\nRegistration of Firearms\n\nTransfer, Possession of Firearms\n\nLicense to Carry\n\nDirectory of Registration Stations\n\nSB 1230 – Reference for Upcoming Laws Effective 1-1-2024\n\nBack to top\n\nPermit to Acquire\n\nIf you wish to acquire a handgun or wish to acquire a shotgun or rifle for the first time, you must be at least 21 years old and a United States citizen. You must apply for a permit to acquire a firearm. You must make an appointment at any police station island wide in order to apply for a permit to acquire a firearm. See the list of police stations and phone numbers below. If you were not born in the United States, you would need to provide proof of U.S. citizenship.\n\nDirectory of Firearm Registration Stations on the island of Hawaiʻi\n\nThe following is a list of firearm registration stations on Hawaiʻi Island. Registration is Monday through Friday, by appointment only. Please call the station nearest you.\n\n(For other islands, please contact the appropriate police department.)\n\nStation Police District Phone Hilo South Hilo (808) 961-2239 Pahoa Puna (808) 965-2716 Laupāhoehoe North Hilo (808) 962-2120 Honokaʻa Hāmākua (808) 775-7533 Waimea South Kohala (808) 887-3080 Kapaʻau North Kohala (808) 889-6540 Kailua-Kona Kona (808) 326-4646 (Ext.222 or 285) Nāʻālehu Kaʻū (808) 939-2520\n\nHRS 134-2 states: “No person shall acquire the ownership of a firearm, whether usable or unusable, serviceable or unserviceable, modern or antique, registered under prior law or by prior owner or unregistered, either by purchase, gift, inheritance, bequest, or in any other manner, whether procured in the state or imported by mail, until the person has first procured from the chief of police of the county of the person’s place of business or…residence…a permit to acquire the ownership of a firearm as prescribed in this section.”\n\nFor the complete wording of the state law governing firearm permits, see Section 134-2 of the Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes.\n\nYou must apply for a separate permit for each handgun you wish to acquire, but only one permit is required for rifles or shotguns no matter how many you wish to acquire within a years time. Before you are granted a permit to purchase a handgun, you must successfully complete a hunter education class or a gun safety course conducted by an instructor certified by the National Rifle Association. The number to call to register for a hunter education class is 887-6050. To sign up for an NRA class, you should check with a local firearms dealer.\n\nThe applicant for a handgun permit must provide proof of a State of Hawaiʻi Hunter Education course or an affidavit signed by a certified NRA instructor. The affidavit signed by the certified firearms instructor who conducted or taught the course (providing the name, address, and phone number of the instructor and attesting to the successful completion of the course by the applicant) shall constitute evidence of certified successful completion under this paragraph.\n\nFees — Effective January 1, 2017, Hawaii Police Department all firearms permit applicants (including prior firearms applicants, out-of-state firearms applicants, and law enforcement officers with personal firearms), will be assessed a $43.25 one-time fee. No fee will be charged for subsequent permits to acquire a firearm, but even those who previously paid a fingerprint fee before January 1, 2017, will be assessed the $43.25 fee for the first registration after January 1, 2017. Payment must be made by Money Order or Cashier’s Check only, payable to Hawaiʻi Criminal Justice Data Center.\n\nIf you receive a firearm by inheritance or bequest, you must first apply for a permit to acquire before actually taking possession of the firearm. You may, however, transfer the inherited or bequeathed firearm directly to a dealer licensed by the state of Hawaiʻi without having to apply for a permit. You may also relinquish the firearm to Hawaiʻi Police Department for destruction.\n\nThere is a minimum waiting period of 14 calendar days between the time you apply for a permit and the time you may be granted the permit. This waiting period gives the Police Department time to conduct a background check to make sure you are eligible for a permit to acquire.\n\nBack to top\n\nIneligibility\n\nPersons are not eligible to own or possess a firearm or ammunition if:\n\nThey are a fugitive from justice.\n\nThey are under indictment, have waived indictment or have been bound over to the circuit court for a felony, any crime of violence or illegal sale of any drug.\n\nHave been convicted of a felony, any crime of violence or illegal sale of any drug.\n\nAre or have been under treatment or counseling for addiction to or abuse of any dangerous, harmful, or detrimental drug or alcohol.\n\nHave been acquitted of a crime on the grounds of mental disease or mental disorder.\n\nHave been diagnosed as having a significant behavioral, emotional, or mental disorder or for treatment for organic brain syndromes.\n\nAre younger than 25 and have been adjudicated by the family court to have committed a felony, two or more crimes of violence or an illegal sale of any drug.\n\nHave been restrained by court order from contacting, threatening, or physically abusing another person.\n\nBack to top\n\nRegistration of Firearms\n\nOnce you receive a permit to acquire a firearm, you must register all firearms with the Hawaiʻi Police Department within five days of purchase or acquisition.\n\nIf you move to Hawaiʻi and bring in a firearm of any description, you must register the firearm within five days after the firearm enters the state. If you were not born in the United States, you would need to provide proof of U.S. citizenship. Fees — you will be charged a one-time fee of $43.25 (after January 1, 2019) for a fingerprint check. Payment must be made by Money Order or Cashier’s Check only, payable to Hawaiʻi Criminal Justice Data Center.\n\nOnce you register a firearm, the registration will remain valid until you sell or otherwise dispose of the weapon.\n\nBack to top\n\nTransfer, Possession of Firearms\n\nYou may not lend any rifle or shotgun to anyone younger than 18 except for the purposes of hunting or target shooting.\n\nExcept for the purposes of hunting or target shooting, you may not possess any firearm owned by another without a permit from the police chief.\n\nFor the purposes of hunting or target shooting, you may lend a lawfully acquired rifle or shotgun to an adult for use within the state for up to 15 days without a permit from the police chief. If the firearm is to be used outside the state, it may be on loan for up to 75 days.\n\nYou may not knowingly lend a firearm to any person who is prohibited from ownership or possession of a firearm.\n\nYou may not bring into the state an assault pistol or sell or transfer an assault pistol to anyone other than a licensed dealer. If you acquire an assault pistol through inheritance or bequest, you must render the weapon permanently inoperable, sell or transfer it to a licensed dealer or turn it in to the Hawaiʻi Police Department within 90 days.\n\nAnyone 16 years of age or older or anyone younger than 16 when accompanied by an adult may carry and use any lawfully acquired rifle or shotgun and suitable ammunition while engaged in hunting or target shooting or traveling to and from the place of hunting or target shooting.\n\nIf you sell or transfer the ownership of a handgun, you must obtain the recipient’s permit at the time of sale or transfer. You are required to sign the permit in ink and submit the permit to the Hawaiʻi Police Department within 48 hours of the transfer via hand delivery or registered mail.\n\nIf you sell or transfer the ownership of a rifle or shotgun, you must submit a Sale/Transfer of Rifle/Shotgun form (PDF Long gun sale transfer form) to the Hawaiʻi Police Department within forty-eight hours of the transfer via hand delivery or registered mail. The form must be completed and signed in ink by the vendor or transferer.\n\n(To view the PDF document above, you may download Adobe Reader®, which is a free download.)\n\nBack to top\n\nLicense to Carry\n\nOn August 24, 2022, the Hawai`i Police Department announced that it has revised the permitting process for license to carry concealed and unconcealed firearms as a result of the July 23, 2022, Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) decision in the case of New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc., et al. v.
