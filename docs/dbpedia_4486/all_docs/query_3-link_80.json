        "text": "Chekhov’s gun, principle in drama, literature, and other narrative forms asserting that every element introduced in a story should be necessary to the plot. The concept was popularized by Russian playwright and author Anton Chekhov, who frequently illustrated the principle by using a gun as an example of an essential element.\n\nChekhov often discussed the concept in correspondence with other writers. In 1889 he wrote: “One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn’t going to go off. It’s wrong to make promises you don’t mean to keep.” Because a rifle is an attention-grabbing element that elicits a certain expectation—i.e., going off—its presence as a stage prop becomes a “promise” to the audience. The writer keeps that promise by using the element, the gun in this case, to contribute to the story. For example, in The Seagull (1896) the character Konstantin carries a gun onstage early in the play. The same gun goes off in the final act, becoming a key element to the plot.\n\nChekhov’s gun is frequently presented to aspiring writers as an extension of the principle of concision. In a similar way that concise writing avoids weak or unnecessary words to make a writing style stronger, the principle of Chekhov’s gun suggests avoiding weak or unnecessary details to make a story stronger.\n\nThough Chekhov’s gun has become a popular guideline for artists in general, some have sometimes rejected it. Chekhov himself flouted his own rule in his play The Cherry Orchard (1904), which contains firearms that are never fired. Moreover, by reversing the principle, a writer can create a red herring. Whereas Chekhov’s gun refers to a seemingly inconsequential element that becomes important later, a red herring is an element that seems important but turns out to be insignificant. It is often used in detective stories to distract or mislead the reader.\n\nChekhov’s gun has been reinterpreted as a media trope that relates to foreshadowing. As a trope, Chekhov’s gun involves employing a setup and a payoff. Because audiences understand that artists rarely include superfluous elements, the inclusion of a seemingly unnecessary element (the setup) can signal that the element will become important later in the work (the payoff). Such an element is sometimes referred to as “a Chekhov’s gun.” For example, in the 1984 film Ghostbusters, the characters are warned early about the disastrous consequences of “crossing the streams” of their energy weapons. This warning serves little role in the plot at the time, but it functions as a setup for later events. By the end of the movie, this setup pays off when the characters are forced to ignore the warning and cross the streams to defeat the colossal Stay Puft Marshmallow Man who is terrorizing New York City."
