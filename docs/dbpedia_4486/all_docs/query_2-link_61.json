        "text": "Begin with a basic search (“militia”). Then, use the advanced search to narrow the results by adding a term like “musket,” searching based on where that term appears (in the body of the law, the title, etc.), and adding additional terms and parameters as needed. For complex searches, you can bypass the main search box and use only the advanced search. The “Include Related Terms” check-box extends your search to cover synonyms and common alternate spellings (“Billy club” and “billie-club”). This is useful for exhaustive searches but may lead to less precise results."
