        "text": "2024 GUn LAW\n\nTRENDWATCH\n\nA Roundup and Analysis of the Latest State Firearm Legislation from GIFFORDS Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence\n\nScroll\n\nGun Law Trendwatch rounds up the latest information on gun legislation in America.\n\nHERE TO HELP\n\nInterested in partnering with us to draft, enact, or implement lifesaving gun safety legislation in your community? Our attorneys provide free assistance to lawmakers, public officials, and advocates working toward solutions to the gun violence crisis.\n\nCONTACT US\n\nMay 2024: Delaware’s Decisive Action\n\nThis will be our last regular post of Trendwatch for the year. We’ll be back soon with more updates as additional state legislative sessions come to an end.\n\nLike many other cities across the country, Wilmington, Delaware, continues to suffer from devastating gun violence. Fortunately, state leaders have taken notice and are taking concrete steps to reduce the crisis.\n\nOn May 16, Delaware Governor John Carney signed into law SB 2, which requires people to obtain a purchaser permit before they can buy a handgun, whether from a dealer or a private seller. Three factors make someone ineligible for a permit: Being under the age of 21, being prohibited under federal or state law from possessing or purchasing firearms, or having been determined by state police to pose a danger to themself or others. Additionally, the law requires completion of firearm safety training within the past five years.\n\nImportantly, applicants must also appear in person to have their fingerprints taken by the state police. This provides additional protection against fraud or inaccuracies that could allow dangerous individuals to obtain handguns. A strong permitting process like this can also prevent instantaneous purchases of firearms for impulsive acts of violence, including suicide.\n\nThe NRA, unsurprisingly, opposed the Delaware bill, calling the measure “extreme” and urging its members to ask the governor to oppose it. But public officials and Delaware residents know that requirements like firearm safety training and submitting fingerprints are commonsense—and save lives.\n\nWe know strong permit to purchase laws work to prevent gun violence. After Connecticut passed its licensing law, its gun homicide rate dropped by 28%, and its gun homicide rate dropped by 33%. States with in-person application or fingerprinting requirements have 56% fewer fatal mass shootings.\n\nAnd the gun lobby will not succeed in challenging these laws in court. Even while significantly curtailing states’ authority to deny concealed carry permits, the Supreme Court made clear in Bruenthat it wasn’t touching gun permitting that requires safety training or other relevant procedures.\n\nBut there’s evidence that demonstrates just how dangerous removing these laws are. After Missouri repealed its permitting law in 2007, there was an increase of between 25% and 47% in gun homicides, and a 23.5% increase in firearm suicides in the state. Additionally, the share of crime guns recovered in Missouri that originated from in-state retail purchases doubled.\n\nWe know that permits to purchase firearms are a commonsense measure to ensure that people trying to buy guns 1) are who they say they are and 2) are not likely to harm themselves or others. Passing permit to purchase laws decreases gun violence, while repealing these laws increases it. However, the gun lobby continues to fight against commonsense, lifesaving solutions at every turn.\n\n2024 Bills in Motion\n\nFor more than three decades, GIFFORDS Law Center has helped states pass evidence-based gun safety policies while fighting the gun lobby’s dangerous agenda. This year, both gun safety bills and gun lobby bills are moving in statehouses across the country, as lawmakers go head to head over protecting their communities from gun violence versus caving to the whims of the gun lobby.\n\nSo far in 2024, at least 43 states and Washington DC have active gun safety bills.\n\nGun Safety Bills in Motion\n\nBACKGROUND CHECKS: CT HB-5467 passed the senate and was signed by the governor. MA H-2367 passed a committee. The following bills failed: MO HB-1878, MO HB-2487, MO HB-2714, and MO HB-2715.

Bills that would penalize banks or other companies that refuse to do business with the gun industry are pending in at least three states.\n\nApril 2024: The Gun Lobby Won’t Protect Students\n\nIn Tennessee, just a year after the shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville left six dead, the only laws the state has enacted in response are ones that allow more guns in schools.\n\nThe new Tennessee law arming teachers has received considerable attention from the media for defying the wishes of both parents and teachers themselves, who do not generally support proposals to arm teachers. Several school districts have already announced that they will opt out.\n\nThe other bill that Governor Lee signed this month has received less media attention, but still carries significant implications for schools. SB 1715/HB1664 gives local law enforcement agencies the authority to assign an armed school resource officer to a school, even if the school district itself does not want an officer there. The research on the effects of school resource officers in schools is mixed—some studies suggest they can have a lasting negative and racially disproportionate impact, including contributing to increased expulsion and arrest rates and the school-to-prison pipeline, and negatively influencing students’ perceptions of law enforcement later in life.\n\nMarch 2024: Standing Up to the Gun Lobby\n\nSome of the nation’s worst mass shootings, including in Aurora, San Bernardino, and Orlando, involved guns purchased with credit cards. And usually, these purchases were accompanied by egregious behavior that should have raised red flags.\n\nIn 2016, for example, the Pulse nightclub shooter in Orlando obtained six new credit cards that he used to purchase over $26,000 in guns and ammunition. He then used these weapons to kill 50 people and wound more than 50 others in what was then the worst mass shooting in recent American history.\n\nCredit card fraud also facilitates straw purchasing and firearm trafficking, fueling everyday gun violence. In 2021, the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan indicted 10 people for a scheme in which they used stolen credit card information to purchase firearms online, some of which were then resold for profit. The group obtained over 40 firearms, three of which were recovered from convicted felons.\n\nMass shootings prompted gun safety advocates to take action.\n\nUntil recently, credit card companies like Visa, Mastercard, and American Express identified almost every kind of business—restaurants, toll roads, and even snowmobile dealers—but they didn’t identify gun and ammunition sellers. Instead these businesses were categorized with the generic code for sporting goods retailers.\n\nDue to this discrepancy, in 2022, a number of high-level public officials, law enforcement groups, and a coalition of gun safety organizations—including GIFFORDS—advocated for the creation of a merchant category code that would distinguish purchases from gun stores and ammunition sellers from other purchases at other sporting goods stores. Doing so would allow the credit card companies and law enforcement to identify suspicious patterns of gun and ammunition purchases—preempting mass shootings and illegal firearm trafficking.\n\nMerchant category codes (MCCs) are four-digit numbers used by credit card companies to classify businesses by the type of goods or services provided. In response to our pressure, the International Standards Organization created a new code, giving credit card companies the ability to identify when transaction history indicates an individual may be trafficking firearms or stockpiling firearms and ammunition for a mass shooting.\n\nThe gun lobby has stalled progress on the new merchant category codes.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the gun lobby objects to the use of the MCC. It falsely claims that the new MCC for guns and ammunition is an invasion of privacy designed to create a gun registry, and it’s pushed this narrative by exploiting fears about gun confiscations. As a result, in 2023 six states (Mississippi, Idaho, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, and Florida) enacted laws prohibiting banks and other businesses from using merchant category codes specific to firearms and ammunition businesses. In these states, credit card companies are now unable to distinguish between firearm purchases and purchases of general sporting goods, and therefore will not have the necessary information to identify and report troubling patterns that could indicate planned mass violence. As a result of this legislation, in March 2023, credit card companies halted plans to implement the new MCC.\n\nThis year, the gun lobby is doubling down on its attack, supporting legislation in almost 20 states that would entirely prohibit the use of the MCC for guns. Already, Indiana, Kentucky, Utah, and Wyoming have enacted these laws, and bills are pending in at least 14 other states that would follow this trend. Among other things, these bills would cause credit card companies to fail to meet the expectations imposed by federal regulators, which encourage the use of dedicated MCCs for specific industries.\n\nMany states are still fighting for progress.\n\nNotably, one governor has stood on the side of gun safety to buck this trend. On March 29, Wisconsin’s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, vetoed one such bill passed by the state’s Republican legislature.\n\nThe gun lobby is holding firm in its opposition to the new MCC, but states fighting to protect their communities aren’t backing down. The new merchant category code is a simple and innovative way to prevent future mass tragedies—and if leaders want to save lives, they should stand up to the gun lobby and help implement the new MCC.\n\nFebruary 2024: Regulating Auto Sears\n\nThe gun debate is one of the most polarizing and fraught discussions in American politics, and it often seems like there’s no common ground.\n\nBut that’s not true. The vast majority of Americans support background checks, and nearly two-thirds of Americans support laws that ban large-capacity magazines. Voters overwhelmingly want measures in place that protect their kids and communities from gun violence. But a less obvious point of consensus involves auto sears, also known as “switches” or “machine gun conversion devices.”\n\nAuto sears are devices designed to convert semiautomatic firearms into automatic firearms (i.e., machine guns). In other words, when one of these devices is installed on a gun, it can fire a continuous stream of bullets with a single pull of the trigger. This feature makes these firearms horrifically destructive.\n\nAuto sears are banned, but loopholes mean they aren’t gone for good.\n\nUnder federal law, auto sears are banned, since the definition of a “machine gun” includes not only any gun capable of firing automatically, but also any part designed and intended solely and exclusively for use in converting a weapon into a machine gun. Manufacturing new machine guns (including new auto sears) for civilian possession has been illegal in the US since 1986, and anyone in possession of a machine gun or an auto sear is guilty of a federal felony.\n\nAnd shockingly, 29 states have weaker laws regarding auto sears than federal law. These states use a definition of machine gun that excludes parts like auto sears and only applies to complete automatic firearms. As a result, these states do not regulate these devices, meaning that state law enforcement officers who encounter them may be reluctant to arrest those who have them or to seize the devices themselves. In those states, enforcement of the federal ban is unlikely unless federal agents get involved.\n\nStates are beginning to fight back.\n\nFortunately, some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are taking steps to fix this problem. In 2023, Louisiana and Indiana enacted laws to close this loophole. While these laws may not look like much, by conforming these states’ definitions of the term “machine gun” to the definition in the federal law, they will encourage compliance with federal law—and help ensure that the residents of these states are less likely to encounter the horrific damage that automatic firearms can cause.\n\nThis year, it looks like progress on this issue may continue. A bill was reported out of the Pennsylvania House Committee on the Judiciary in early February that would add both auto sears and bump stocks to the state’s list of “offensive weapons.” In Mississippi, a bill that would ban machine gun conversion devices—including auto sears—passed out of committee. In Virginia, a bill that would ban auto sears has passed the house, but has yet to be voted on in the senate.\n\nIt will take a wide array of solutions to put an end to gun violence in this country. While there is much more state legislators could be doing, these moderate but positive steps to address the danger that auto sears pose prove that progress on gun safety is possible, even in the most unlikely places.\n\nJanuary 2024: Virginia’s Progress\n\nLegislative sessions have begun in most states, and gun violence prevention bills are already on the move across the country.\n\nFor the Virginia legislature, 2024 promises to be a productive year for gun safety. After listening to Virginia residents, lawmakers are likely to put multiple gun violence prevention bills on Governor Glenn Youngkin’s desk that address a wide array of gun policies, including banning assault weapons, auto sears, and ghost guns; limiting the carrying of concealed handguns in public; and ensuring that people convicted of domestic violence turn over their guns. As of February 1, six bills had already passed one chamber, and many other bills had passed out of committee.\n\nVirginia is prioritizing gun safety once again.\n\nFor some longtime gun safety advocates, this activity may feel a little like déjà vu. In 2020 and 2021, following prominent mass shootings in the state, Virginia enacted numerous gun safety bills under then governor Ralph Northam. In 2020, Virginia passed laws that require background checks, require the reporting of lost or stolen firearms, ban bump stocks, allow people to put themselves on a list so they cannot buy firearms, and limit the purchase of handguns to one per month. Then in 2021, Virginia passed laws that disarm people who have committed domestic violence; allow courts to issue extreme risk protection orders; protect polling places, schools, and government buildings from guns; and allow the state police five business days to conduct a background check. Thanks to these new gun safety measures, Virginia’s grade jumped from a D to a B in GIFFORDS Law Center’s Annual Gun Law Scorecard.\n\nWhile progress may have slowed in 2022 and 2023, Virginia was still able to improve its grade from a B to a B+ by investing in community violence prevention programs. In 2023 in particular, Virginia invested $34 million in community violence intervention (CVI) and created the Office of Safer Communities. Governor Youngkin also signed into law a $10 million, one-time appropriation to create the Virginia Mass Violence Care Fund, designed to provide assistance to victims and survivors of mass shootings, as well as their families.\n\nDespite this progress, Virginians continue to suffer from gun violence.\n\nThe state is a major source of guns trafficked into Maryland, New York, New Jersey, and DC. The District of Columbia, in particular, has been hard hit by gun violence in recent years, and Virginia’s less-than-adequate gun laws bear some responsibility.\n\nIn addition, gun violence in Virginia made headlines last year when a six-year-old boy critically injured a teacher with a handgun in a first grade classroom in Newport News, Virginia. The handgun used by the boy was purchased by his mother and was kept in their home until the boy brought it to school in his backpack the day of the shooting. A few months later, a high school graduation in Richmond was the site of a mass shooting.\n\nLegislators will continue to fight for safer communities.\n\nLuckily, following the results of last year’s elections, gun safety is once again a top priority for the state legislature. In November, Democrats retained control over the state senate and took control of the house of delegates—and, in what one reporter has called a “replay of 2020,” the legislature has already demonstrated a real hunger to pass gun laws that will reduce gun violence. It’s also sparked speculation about whether the Republican governor will sign gun safety legislation into law or veto the popular policies. In the meantime, legislators are continuing to listen to their constituents and put in the work to create safer communities for us all.\n\ntake a\n\nstand\n\nJOIN THE FIGHT\n\nOver 40,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence every year.
