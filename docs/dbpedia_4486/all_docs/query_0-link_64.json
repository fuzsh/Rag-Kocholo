        "text": "‚≠ï New Jersey has among the strictest gun laws in the nation\n\n‚≠ï Do you have the right to 'stand your ground' in the face of an attack?\n\n‚≠ï When can you use deadly force against another person?\n\nApplications for gun permits continue to rise in New Jersey with many seeking to purchase a gun for self-protection.\n\nWith many new gun owners in New Jersey, I am often asked about the state‚Äôs self-defense laws and the use of deadly force.\n\nWhile I have written about this topic extensively, many still ask if New Jersey is a so-called ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù state.\n\nBefore I answer that question, let‚Äôs take a closer look at what ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù means and the types of self-defense laws that are generally adopted in the United States.\n\nPlease note: This article is not intended as a substitute for legal advice. If you have specific questions about the law and how it may apply to your circumstances, we strongly urge you to consult with an attorney.\n\nAmong the experts I consulted for this topic are:\n\nSamuel ‚ÄúSkip‚Äù Reale. Skip spent nearly 30 years as a prosecutor, including with the New Jersey Attorney General‚Äôs Organized Crime and Racketeering Bureau. Since 2003, Skip has been in private practice, specializing in criminal defense.\n\nTim Alexander. Tim is a veteran prosecutor and prominent Civil Rights attorney. Alexander is a former detective captain in charge of the Atlantic County Prosecutor‚Äôs Criminal Investigation Section. He is also the former major trial prosecutor for the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office.\n\nWhat is ‚ÄúStand your Ground?‚Äù\n\nWhile individual state laws vary, the essence of stand your ground is the removal of a duty to retreat permitting the use of deadly force in self-defense.\n\nIn the broadest sense, this can involve situations both in your home and in public.\n\nThe first state to pass a stand your ground law was Florida in 2005.\n\nPerhaps the most famous stand your ground case came in 2012 when George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon Martin.\n\nAt the time, Zimmerman was working as a neighborhood watch captain when he approached Martin who he described as acting ‚Äúsuspiciously.‚Äù\n\nA confrontation ensued and Zimmerman shot and killed Martin.\n\nHe was ultimately found not guilty under Florida‚Äôs stand your ground law.\n\nREAD MORE: When you use a gun in New Jersey\n\nAre there variations of stand your ground?\n\nThere are.\n\nSome states have a variation that apply only to specific locations.\n\nThe most common would be inside your home.\n\nThis is commonly referred to a ‚Äúcastle doctrine‚Äô or defense of habitation.\n\nHowever, some states have expanded this law to include other specific places like anywhere on your property, your place of work or even your vehicle.\n\nThese statutes generally remove any duty to retreat before the use of deadly force.\n\nWhat is Duty to Retreat?\n\nA Duty to Retreat statute is the opposite of stand your ground and castle doctrine.\n\nAgain, while the law may vary from state to state, the general statute requires you retreat from any threatening situation if you can do so safely. Only when retreat is not an option, may you employ the use of deadly force.\n\nGenerally, however, this statute does not apply to the confines of your home.\n\nWhat is the law in New Jersey?\n\nNew Jersey has very specific laws regarding the defense of oneself, defense of others and defense of property.\n\nAccording to veteran prosecutor Skip Reale, the use of deadly force is not permitted in defense of oneself or another person in all but the most extreme circumstances.\n\nAttorney Tim Alexander agrees, pointing out that deadly force is never permitted in the defense of property.\n\nEven if someone were to break into your house, you are permitted to defend yourself, but not the contents of the home.\n\nIf someone is stealing something from you, there is no presumption under New Jersey law that they intend to do you bodily harm.\n\nDoes New Jersey have the 'Stand your Ground' law?\n\nNo.\n\nNew Jersey does not have a stand your ground law, nor does it have castle doctrine.\n\nIn fact, Reale and Alexander say in New Jersey it is just the opposite.\n\nYou have a duty to retreat unless someone is actually inside your home posing a danger to you or your family.\n\nREAD MORE: Mistakes to avoid when applying for a gun permit in NJ\n\nIs that always the case?\n\nPretty much.\n\nIn New Jersey, you have a duty not to use deadly force in all but the most extreme cases.\n\n\"If I'm in danger, if I perceive that I or others are in danger of imminent bodily, or serious bodily injury, you can use deadly force,\" Alexander explained, \"However, for most run-of-the-mill occasions ‚Äî the guy trying to boost the car, a stranger in the yard, anything suspicious ‚Äî that is not going to include deadly force in most circumstances.\"\n\nMonmouth County Sherriff Shawn Golden recognizes the sensitive nature of the issue.\n\n‚ÄúIt may be somewhat of a political view but my view is you have a right to protect your home,\" Golden says, \"And if you have a legal firearm and you are feeling threatened within your residential domicile, then you need to take the action that you believe you need to take.‚Äù\n\nSummit Police Detective Mike Freeman agrees.\n\n‚ÄúIf they are coming into your home, or in your home, it‚Äôs reasonable to assume that they're causing a threat to your person or your family. So, you would, in my opinion, be justified in using deadly force.‚Äù\n\nREAD MORE: NJ 101.5's Judi Franco gets a gun\n\nAnother word of caution\n\nStafford Township Police Chief Thomas Dellane cautioned that these instances are not always black and white.\n\n‚ÄúEven if the law allows for it, you're going to be subject to an investigation. You're subject to potential criminal charges. You're subject to potential civil charges (a lawsuit). If I can make one strong point this evening, call 911 as soon as possible and let the professionals deal with it the way we're trained to do.‚Äù\n\nWhat states do have a stand your ground law?\n\nThe following states have some version of a stand your ground law, but each state also has very specific rules as to when it applies.\n\nThe most common provision is that the person using deadly force must not be the initial aggressor in any altercation.\n\n‚≠ï Alabama\n\n‚≠ï Alaska\n\n‚≠ï Arizona\n\n‚≠ï Arkansas\n\n‚≠ï Florida\n\n‚≠ï Georgia\n\n‚≠ï Idaho\n\n‚≠ï Indiana\n\n‚≠ï Iowa\n\n‚≠ï Kansas\n\n‚≠ï Kentucky\n\n‚≠ï Louisiana\n\n‚≠ï Michigan\n\n‚≠ï Mississippi\n\n‚≠ï Missouri\n\n‚≠ï Montana\n\n‚≠ï Nevada\n\n‚≠ï New Hampshire\n\n‚≠ï North Carolina\n\n‚≠ï Ohio\n\n‚≠ï Oklahoma\n\n‚≠ï Pennsylvania\n\n‚≠ï South Carolina\n\n‚≠ï South Dakota\n\n‚≠ï Tennessee\n\n‚≠ï Texas\n\n‚≠ï Utah\n\n‚≠ï West Virginia\n\n‚≠ï Wyoming\n\nWhat state‚Äôs have Duty to Retreat laws?\n\nWhile these states, including New Jersey, require you to retreat if you can safely do so, you do not have a duty to retreat from an intruder in your home.\n\n‚≠ï Connecticut\n\n‚≠ï Delaware\n\n‚≠ï Hawaii\n\n‚≠ï Massachusetts\n\n‚≠ï Maryland\n\n‚≠ï Maine\n\n‚≠ï Minnesota\n\n‚≠ï Nebraska\n\n‚≠ï New Jersey\n\n‚≠ï New York\n\n‚≠ï North Dakota\n\n‚≠ï Rhode Island\n\n‚≠ï Wisconsin\n\nWATCH: New Jersey 101.5 Town Hall on the state's gun laws\n\nReport a correction üëà | üëâ Contact our newsroom"
