        "text": "Gun Laws in Colorado\n\n#11 in the country for gun law strength\n\nUp from #12 last year\n\nCompare\n\nColorado has many strong firearm laws and has made significant progress in its gun law strength in the years since the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting. These measures will have an impact on keeping guns out of the wrong hands—and the state can hope for an improvement in its gun violence rate as the impact of those new laws comes into view.\n\nIn the years since the Aurora shooting, Colorado has required that firearms be stored securely to prevent child access, ensured domestic abusers turn in their guns, and mandated background checks for all gun sales. In 2021 alone, lawmakers in the Centennial State repealed a law limiting localities from passing gun laws, created an Office of Gun Violence Prevention, barred people with violent offenses from buying guns, and limited qualified immunity. In 2023, lawmakers continued their progress by passing laws to help hold bad actors in the gun industry accountable for the harms they cause, raise the age to purchase a firearm, stem the proliferation of ghost guns, and institute a waiting period for firearm sales.\n\nKey Metrics\n\nGun Law Strength\n\nComposite score\n\n63\n\n0 Last year’s score: 58.5 100\n\nGun Violence Rate\n\nGun deaths per 100k residents\n\n17.1\n\n0 National average: 14.2 29.6\n\n2024 Gun Law Checklist\n\nHow Colorado stacks up on 50 key policies\n\nColorado Foundational laws\n\nBackground Check and/or Purchase Permit\n\nRequires Background checks for handgun purchases at point of sale and/or for permit to purchase\n\nDoes the law cover only handgun purchases, or also rifle and shotgun purchases?\n\nAll firearms (handguns, rifles, and shotguns)\n\nWhen is the background check performed?\n\nPoint-of-sale\n\nConcealed Carry Permit Required\n\nRequires any person who carries a concealed firearm in public to first obtain a permit\n\nIf so, does the state require training?\n\nYes\n\nDoes state training include firing an actual gun?\n\nYes\n\nExtreme Risk Law\n\nAllows law enforcement (and often family members) to petition for a court order to temporarily prevent someone in crisis from accessing guns.\n\nWho may petition for an order?\n\nLaw enforcement, family/household members, certain medical professionals, and certain educators\n\nNo Shoot First Law\n\nDoes not have a dangerous Shoot First law in place\n\nSecure Storage or Child Access Prevention Required\n\nRequires that firearms be stored locked, unloaded, and separate from ammunition in certain circumstances\n\nWhen does the law apply?\n\nWhen child may or is likely to access\n\nHow does the state define child?\n\nUnder 18\n\nDoes the state law require storage to prevent access by other prohibited people?\n\nYes\n\nColorado Gun industry and product safety\n\nAssault Weapons Prohibited\n\nBars purchase of certain assault-style weapons originally designed for military use\n\nConsumer Safety\n\nRequires new handgun models sold in the state to have childproofing features\n\nGhost Guns Regulated\n\nRegulates ghost gun parts, ensuring they cannot be sold without serial numbers and a background check\n\nWhat does the state law require?\n\nSerial numbers for component parts.\n\nHigh Capacity Magazines Prohibited\n\nBars purchase of gun magazines larger than a prescribed size\n\nMicrostamping for New Handguns\n\nRequires new handgun models sold in the state to include microstamping technology\n\nNo Special Immunity for Gun Industry\n\nDoes not have a dangerous legal immunity law in place\n\nDoes the law proactively give gun violence survivors access to justice?\n\nYes\n\nColorado Guns in public\n\nCrime Gun Tracing\n\nRequires officials to trace all guns recovered at crime scenes, using the federal tracing system\n\nNo Carry After Violent Offense\n\nBars concealed carry by people with assault or other violent misdemeanor convictions\n\nNo Guns Mandate on College Campuses\n\nDoes not force colleges and universities to allow concealed carry\n\nNo Guns at State Capitols and/or Demonstrations\n\nBlocks the public carry of guns on state capitol grounds and/or political protests\n\nNo Guns in Bars\n\nBlocks the concealed carry of guns in bars\n\nNo Guns in K-12 Schools\n\nDoes not have a law allowing carry in K–12 schools by staff or other permit holders\n\nOpen Carry Regulated\n\nRegulates how guns may be carried visibly in public, either requiring a permit or else barring open carry altogether\n\nStrong Concealed Carry Authority\n\nAllows officials to bar concealed carry by people who pose a danger\n\nDoes the state also require permission to carry on private property open to the public?\n\nNo\n\nColorado Keeping guns out of the wrong hands\n\nEmergency Restraining Order Prohibitor\n\nBars domestic abusers from having guns while subject to short-term emergency orders\n\nFelony Prohibitor\n\nBars gun possession by people with felony convictions\n\nHow long is a person prohibited by the state law?\n\nIndefinitely\n\nFugitive from Justice Prohibitor\n\nBars gun possession by fugitives\n\nGun Removal Program\n\nRequires officials to identify and seek removal of illegal guns\n\nHate Crime Prohibitor\n\nBars people from having guns after a hate crime conviction\n\nMental Health Prohibitor\n\nBars gun possession by people who have been involuntarily committed or found to be a danger to self or others\n\nMinimum Age to Purchase\n\nRequires handgun buyers to be 21+ and rifle and shotgun buyers to be 18+\n\nWhat is the minimum age for gun buyers?\n\n21 for all firearms\n\nNo Gun Purchases After Violent Offense\n\nBars gun purchases by people with assault or other violent misdemeanor convictions\n\nDoes the prohibitor cover assault and battery crimes?\n\nYes\n\nHow long is a person prohibited?\n\n5 years;
