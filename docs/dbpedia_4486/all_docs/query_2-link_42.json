        "text": "The nation’s largest gathering of gun enthusiasts opened its annual convention Friday in Houston, three days and nearly 300 miles away from the Texas scene of one of the nation’s deadliest mass school shootings ever.\n\nThe National Rifle Association is starting its convention at the close of one of the country’s bloodiest months in recent memory, with horrific shootings at a Buffalo, N.Y. grocery store, a Santa Ana, Calif. church, and an elementary school in Uvalde, Tex., that combined claimed 32 lives and left more than two dozen injured.\n\nThe carnage has sparked a new round of debate over one of American democracy’s most controversial freedoms: the Second Amendment. It’s provoked a massive groundswell of outrage from people–regardless of political affiliation or gun ownership–who want better forms of gun control.\n\nYet, after the Uvalde shootings, Congress is floundering about what –-if anything –- to do to address a public health crisis unique to America: mass shootings.\n\nIn response, Atlanta Civic Circle has undertaken this look at gun laws in Georgia, where nearly half of all adults live in a home with a gun–and a young person can’t legally drink until they’re 21, but can possess a gun at 18.\n\nGeorgia has some of the weakest gun laws in the country, ranking 36th nationally, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, an anti-gun-violence nonprofit.\n\nAnd the state’s gun laws have been getting steadily weaker. Georgia lawmakers passed a law in 2017 requiring colleges and universities to allow guns on campus. In April, Gov. Brian Kemp signed a law that allows gun owners to carry concealed handguns in public without a state license.\n\nGEORGIA GUN LAWS\n\nAge when you can legally possess a handgun: 18\n\nAge when you can legally buy a gun: 21 (18, if you’re in the military or honorably discharged)\n\nAge when you can legally possess a rifle or shotgun: No minimum age.\n\nFirearms that are illegal to possess in Georgia: Bazooka, machine gun, sawed-off shotgun or rifle, rocket launcher.\n\nHOW MANY GEORGIANS OWN GUNS?\n\nGeorgia adults who live in a home with a gun: 49.2%\n\nGeorgia’s national ranking in gun ownership: 6th\n\nGun licenses in Georgia in 2021: 304,124\n\nGuns registered with a law enforcement agency in Georgia: 190,050\n\nRegion with the largest number of gun owners: the South\n\nWHAT KIND OF GUN LAWS DO WE HAVE?\n\nAre there any restrictions on assault weapons?\n\nNo. Georgia neither regulates nor prohibits the sale or possession of assault weapons.\n\nOr any kind of ban on large-capacity magazines?\n\nNo. Georgia also doesn’t regulate or prohibit the sale or possession of large-capacity magazines.\n\nDo you need to undergo a background check to buy a gun in Georgia?\n\nYes, if you buy the gun from a gun shop because federal law requires all licensed gun dealers to perform background checks. But no if you buy it online or from a gun show.\n\nDoes Georgia have any law regulating gun sales at gun shows?\n\nNo. In fact, Georgia explicitly bans any county or city from regulating gun shows in any way, according to Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. That means anyone of any age can buy a gun at a gun show.\n\nDoes Georgia require a waiting period to buy a gun? No.\n\nDo you need a weapons carry license to buy or carry a firearm in Georgia? No.\n\nLicensing laws are to ensure that someone passes a background check before buying a gun. They require you to apply for a gun license in person at a law enforcement agency, as an extra safeguard against fraud or errors that could allow dangerous people to get guns.\n\nWhat about to carry a concealed weapon? No.\n\nDo you have to register your gun with local law enforcement in Georgia?\n\nNo. In fact, state law prohibits firearm registries.\n\nIs there any federal requirement to register a gun with a law enforcement agency?\n\nNo. There is no national gun registry. In fact, federal law prohibits using the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to create any registry of guns or gun owners.\n\nDoes Georgia have a law banning guns in secondary schools from K-12?\n\nNo. School personnel are allowed to carry guns.\n\nDoes Georgia have a “red flag” law?\n\nNo. While 19 states and the District of Columbia have some form of red flag laws that allow law enforcement officers to confiscate firearms from people that a court has deemed dangerous, Georgia does not.\n\nDoes Georgia have a law prohibiting domestic violence offenders from having a gun?\n\nNo. The state does not automatically prohibit either domestic abusers or stalkers with a “no contact” protective order against them from having a gun. However, when petitioning a judge for a protective order, you can ask them to restrict the abuser from having or buying guns.\n\nAre guns allowed on Georgia college campuses? Yes.\n\nDoes Georgia have a “stand your ground” law?\n\nYes. Georgia is one of 30 states with a law saying you don’t have a duty to retreat from an attacker and you can legally use violent or deadly force against them, as long as you are in a place you have a legal right to be.\n\nDoes Georgia have a secure gun storage law?\n\nNo. Nationally, 23 states have laws requiring people to keep their guns locked up to prevent children from getting hold of them. Georgia, however, is not one of them. The strongest laws penalize any failure to secure a gun while weaker laws impose penalties only if a child actually gets to a gun.\n\nHERE ARE SOME COMMON-SENSE GUN LAWS IN OTHER STATES:\n\nMandatory insurance:\n\nGun owners in San Jose, Calif. must carry liability insurance under an innovative law passed by city officials a couple of months ago. It works like auto insurance, offering lower premiums for responsible gun owners to encourage safe behavior.\n\nMandatory gun safety class:\n\nIf you want a license to carry a gun in California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Washington, you’ll have to complete a safety training course first.\n\nMandatory gun registration and licensing:\n\nStates with registration and licensing systems, like California and Connecticut, report fewer guns sold within the state are used in crimes, according to this 2001 study. When Connecticut passed its licensing law, the gun homicide rate fell by 28% and the gun suicide rate fell by 33%.\n\nADDITIONAL SOURCES AND RESOURCES"
