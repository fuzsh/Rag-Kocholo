        "text": "The National Rifle Association (NRA) is holding its annual meeting in Indianapolis, with former US President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis due to address delegates.\n\nThe meeting is taking place amid increasing calls for tighter US gun laws in the wake of a record number of mass shootings in 2023.\n\nAccording to the Gun Violence Archive, external, there have been 146 mass shootings in the country since January.\n\nFounded in 1871 as a recreational group designed to \"promote and encourage rifle shooting\", the National Rifle Association has grown into one of the most powerful political organisations in the US.\n\nIt lobbies heavily against all forms of gun control and argues aggressively that more guns make the country safer.\n\nIt relies on, and staunchly defends, a disputed interpretation of the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which it argues gives US citizens the rights to bear arms.\n\nIt directly funds US politicians and lawmakers who support its aims.\n\nThe group is currently in legal difficulties, having been locked in a court battle with New York's Attorney General since 2020.\n\nLetitia James alleges that in the past the organisation diverted millions of dollars to leaders including Mr LaPierre for their personal use.\n\nShe is suing Mr LaPierre for millions of dollars he has been paid by the NRA, and wants the organisation to face financial monitoring.\n\nThe NRA has described her lawsuit as a \"baseless, premeditated attack\".\n\nEstimates of the NRA's membership vary widely. The association claimed that membership rose to nearly to five million in response to the mass shooting at Sandy Hook school in 2012.\n\nHowever, some analysts put the figure at closer to three million.\n\nIn 2022, the NRA received $97m (Â£78m) from membership dues, external. That is down by more than 40% from its peak year, 2018.\n\nThe organisation blamed the Covid pandemic for the fall.\n\nHowever, the NRA still has a substantial budget which it uses to try and influence US politicians on gun policy.\n\nIn 2021, it spent $4.2m on lobbying, external, according to non-partisan US research firm OpenSecrets.\n\nOpenSecrets' figures suggest that since 2010, the NRA has directed more than $140m to pro-gun election candidates.\n\nThe NRA also has considerable influence via its membership, many of whom will vote for a candidate based solely on their stance on guns.\n\nIt grades members of Congress from A to F on their perceived friendliness to gun rights. Those ratings can cost pro-gun control candidates their seats.\n\nOn 27 March, six people including three children were killed at a school in Nashville.\n\nThe NRA responded by calling for more security in schools, external, rather than restrictions on gun ownership.\n\nThe Nashville attack was the worst mass shooting at a US school since 19 children and two adults were killed in Uvalde, Texas, in May 2022.\n\nThe NRA held its 2022 meeting in nearby Houston only days after the Uvalde attack, despite widespread calls to cancel the event.\n\nIn 2018, it backed a call by then-president Donald Trump to arm teachers and other members of staff, external to deter gun attacks - although many teachers do not want to be armed."
