        "text": "It would enhance background checks for prospective gun buyers ages 18 to 21, requiring for the first time that juvenile records, including mental health records beginning at age 16, be vetted for potentially disqualifying material. The bill would provide incentives for states to pass “red flag” laws that allow guns to be temporarily confiscated from people deemed by a judge to be too dangerous to possess them. And it would tighten a federal ban on domestic abusers buying firearms, and strengthen laws against straw purchasing and trafficking of guns.\n\nIt also includes hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for mental health programs and to beef up security in schools.\n\n“This is not a cure-all for all the ways gun violence affects our nation, but it is a long overdue step in the right direction,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, said on the Senate floor. “It’s significant — it’s going to save lives.”\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi of California announced on Thursday night that the House would move to take up the measure on Friday morning. White House officials have said President Biden would sign it, calling the bill “one of the most significant steps Congress has taken to reduce gun violence in decades.”\n\nThe bipartisan breakthrough came on the same day that the Supreme Court struck down a New York law that placed strict limits on carrying guns outside the home, reflecting a stark divergence between the conservative-leaning court and the Democratic-controlled Congress on one of the most politically intractable issues in the country.\n\nThe vote tally also underscored how deeply polarizing the issue remains, and how fleeting the spirit of compromise around guns may be. Most Republicans opposed the bill, and most of those backing it will not face voters this year, suggesting that the measure was less an opening for a new era of bipartisan consensus on gun violence than a rare moment of agreement that may soon give way to more gridlock, particularly if Republicans win control of Congress this fall.\n\nStill, a small group of Democrats and Republicans seized on the outrage that followed the massacre in Uvalde almost exactly one month ago and a racist mass shooting in Buffalo days before that to forge a modest compromise that could succeed where earlier attempts had repeatedly failed.\n\nMr. McConnell praised Democrats for being “willing to give up their wish list” and accept less than they have insisted on in past efforts at revamping gun laws.\n\nHe also conceded that he and other Republicans saw a clear political advantage in supporting the legislation in a midterm election year in which their path to winning control of Congress runs through the suburbs, where their party’s hard-right lurch has alienated many voters.\n\n“It’s no secret that we’ve lost ground in suburban areas,” Mr. McConnell told reporters on Thursday night. “I hope it will be viewed favorably by voters in the suburbs we need to regain to be in the majority next year.”\n\nThe compromise, the product of an intense round of talks between a small group of Democrats and Republicans, omits many of the sweeping gun control measures that Democrats and activists have long called for.\n\nToiling to keep Republicans on board, Democrats left out their marquee gun control proposals, including a House-passed measure that would prohibit the sale of semiautomatic rifles to people younger than 21, a ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines and a federal red flag law. They also agreed that the enhanced background checks for younger buyers would expire after a decade, just as the assault weapons ban did in 2004, leaving future Congresses to haggle anew about whether to extend it.\n\nBut it included substantial breakthroughs beyond what Democrats had initially thought possible when they set out to find a modest deal that could, at the very least, show that Congress was capable of responding to national crisis.\n\n“I’ve never seen families and kids and parents as scared as they were after Uvalde,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut, the lead Democratic negotiator, said on Thursday. They were scared for their children’s safety, he said, “but they were also scared that their government was so fundamentally broken that it couldn’t step up and address the one thing that matters most to anybody in this country — the safety of our kids.”\n\nMr. Murphy said that while the legislation fell short of everything Democrats would like to pass, it provided “an answer that allows us to tell families all across this country that the era of inaction is over.”\n\nThe bill would set aside $750 million in federal grant funding to help states implement red flag laws and for other crisis intervention programs, including mental health courts.\n\nIn another change long sought by activists against domestic violence, it would include serious current or recent dating partners in a federal law that bars domestic abusers from being able to purchase a firearm, closing what has become known as the boyfriend loophole. The ban currently applies only to people who have been married to, have been living with or have a child with a victim.\n\nThe legislation would set aside millions of dollars, largely in grants, to address mental health in schools and communities, including $150 million for the national suicide hotline. It also would provide $300 million for school safety programs, including bolstering security and funding school resource officers.\n\nBesides Mr. McConnell, the Republican support came from centrists, longtime veterans of previous failed negotiations, and notably, lawmakers just a couple of years into their latest term. Just two of the 15 Republicans, Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Todd Young of Indiana, are facing voters in November, and four are retiring.\n\nIn trying to make their case to Republicans, Mr. McConnell and Senator John Cornyn of Texas, his handpicked emissary to the talks, conducted a poll of 1,000 gun-owning households across the country and found that most supported the key elements. A solid majority backed increasing federal funding for states to maintain or implement red flag laws, and more than 80 percent supported closing the boyfriend loophole and allowing law enforcement to have more time to examine juvenile and mental health records.\n\nThat was not enough for most Senate Republicans, however, who argued that the measure would infringe upon the rights of gun owners.\n\n“I’m angry that these horrific crimes keep happening, but I’m also angry that this august chamber plays political games,” said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who teamed with Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, in an unsuccessful effort to strip out the gun-related measures and divert federal funds to mental health and school safety programs.\n\n“Do something that will stop these crimes — this bill ain’t that, but it does have provisions that are troubling,” Mr. Cruz added. “It does have provisions that satisfy the Democrat political priority to go after the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms of law-abiding citizens.”\n\nMr. Cruz was echoing some of the criticism that the National Rifle Association heaped on the bill. The group said the legislation “does little to truly address violent crime while opening the door to unnecessary burdens on the exercise of Second Amendment freedom by law-abiding gun owners.”\n\nDemocratic proponents said the legislation’s approval was possible only because the senators involved in the talks put aside their parties’ orthodoxies to find a deal.\n\n“Our bipartisan group of senators rejected the notion that legislating must be a zero-sum game with winners on one tally sheet and losers on the other,” said Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, a key Democratic negotiator who took on the role of conduit to the Republican side during the negotiations.\n\nThat meant Democrats had to tailor the bill’s provisions to appeal to Republicans. For instance, they accepted a G.O.P. demand that closing the boyfriend loophole would not be implemented retroactively and that dating partners who commit a single misdemeanor offense can regain the ability to purchase a gun after five years if their records remain clean.\n\n“The potential we have to save lives is worth any sort of concession we might have had to make during the negotiation,” Mr. Cornyn said in a speech on Thursday night, in which he thanked his colleagues for ignoring “those who would spew disinformation and outright lies” about the measure. Afterward, several Democrats went up to Mr. Cornyn, who was heckled at a Republican gathering in Texas last week for last week for participating in the talks, to offer thanks and shake his hand.\n\nDemocrats were hoping that the majority of Republicans who opposed the bill would look out of step with voters in the coming midterm elections. A recent Quinnipiac poll showed that 59 percent of Republicans and 76 percent of independents favored raising the minimum legal age to buy any gun to 21. And the vast majority, including Republican voters, supported at least some gun control measures, including enhanced background checks.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nJune 23, 2022\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the day that senators took action on gun safety. The test vote was Thursday, not Wednesday.\n\nHow we handle corrections\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote the opinion of the court, a 6-3 ruling in which he was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Amy Coney Barrett, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. The opinion held that “the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual’s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.”\n\nIn concluding that New York had violated the Constitution by requiring people to show “proper cause” when applying for a license to carry a handgun in public, Justice Thomas wrote (Pages 68-69):\n\n“The constitutional right to bear arms in public for self-defense is not ‘a second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.’ We know of no other constitutional right that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special need. That is not how the First Amendment works when it comes to unpopular speech or the free exercise of religion. It is not how the Sixth Amendment works when it comes to a defendant’s right to confront the witnesses against him. And it is not how the Second Amendment works when it comes to public carry for self-defense.\n\nNew York’s proper-cause requirement violates the Fourteenth Amendment in that it prevents law-abiding citizens with ordinary self-defense needs from exercising their right to keep and bear arms.”\n\nJustice Thomas set out a new standard by which courts should evaluate gun restrictions (Page 14):\n\n“To justify its regulation, the government may not simply posit that the regulation promotes an important interest. Rather, the government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only if a firearm regulation is consistent with this nation’s historical tradition may a court conclude that the individual’s conduct falls outside the Second Amendment’s ‘unqualified command.’”\n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer, in a dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, focused on the toll of gun violence. He cited a long list of statistics and criticized the majority’s conclusion that gun regulations had to be historically rooted in order to pass constitutional muster (Page 85-86):\n\n“The court wrongly limits its analysis to focus nearly exclusively on history. It refuses to consider the government interests that justify a challenged gun regulation, regardless of how compelling those interests may be. The Constitution contains no such limitation, and neither do our precedents. … The question before us concerns the extent to which the Second Amendment prevents democratically elected officials from enacting laws to address the serious problem of gun violence. And yet the court today purports to answer that question without discussing the nature or severity of that problem.”\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice Alito suggested that the statistics Justice Breyer cited were irrelevant (Page 71):\n\n“Why, for example, does the dissent think it is relevant to recount the mass shootings that have occurred in recent years? Does the dissent think that laws like New York’s prevent or deter such atrocities? Will a person bent on carrying out a mass shooting be stopped if he knows that it is illegal to carry a handgun outside the home? And how does the dissent account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the top of its list took place in Buffalo? The New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator.”\n\nJustice Breyer responded by arguing that the complex facts of gun violence, and the differing circumstances in different parts of the country, made the issue best suited for resolution by state legislators, not by courts (Page 92):\n\n“The primary difference between the court’s view and mine is that I believe the Amendment allows states to take account of the serious problems posed by gun violence that I have just described. I fear that the court’s interpretation ignores these significant dangers and leaves states without the ability to address them.”\n\nIn an important concurring opinion — one that appeared to limit the sweep of the majority opinion — Justice Kavanaugh, joined by Chief Justice Roberts, wrote that some licensing requirements remained presumptively constitutional.\n\nIn reference to “shall-issue regimes” — that is, states in which officials “must issue concealed-carry licenses whenever applicants satisfy certain threshold requirements, without granting licensing officials discretion to deny licenses based on a perceived lack of need or suitability,” in the words of Justice Thomas’s majority opinion — Justice Kavanaugh wrote (Page 80):\n\n“Those shall-issue regimes may require a license applicant to undergo fingerprinting, a background check, a mental health records check, and training in firearms handling and in laws regarding the use of force, among other possible requirements. Unlike New York’s may-issue regime, those shall-issue regimes do not grant open-ended discretion to licensing officials and do not require a showing of some special need apart from self-defense. As petitioners acknowledge, shall-issue licensing regimes are constitutionally permissible, subject of course to an as-applied challenge if a shall-issue licensing regime does not operate in that manner in practice.\n\nGoing forward, therefore, the 43 states that employ objective shall-issue licensing regimes for carrying handguns for self-defense may continue to do so. Likewise, the six states including New York potentially affected by today’s decision may continue to require licenses for carrying handguns for self-defense so long as those states employ objective licensing requirements like those used by the 43 shall-issue states.”\n\n“Many states have tried to address some of the dangers of gun violence just described by passing laws that limit, in various ways, who may purchase, carry or use firearms of different kinds,” Justice Breyer wrote. “The court today severely burdens states’ efforts to do so.”\n\nA string of mass shootings in recent months has pushed Congress to the brink of passing new national regulations on guns.\n\nThe massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on May 24, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed, was the deadliest mass shooting in the United States so far this year. It happened just 10 days after 10 people were shot and killed at a supermarket in Buffalo.\n\nThe Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization, has counted at least 279 such shootings, defined as ones in which four or more people were killed or injured, through this week. (Justice Breyer’s dissent gave the number as 277, saying he last checked the archive Monday; two more occurred that very day.) Of those shootings, 14 involved four or more fatalities.\n\nThe group recorded 692 mass shootings last year, with 28 involving four or more fatalities.\n\nThe full toll of gun violence in the United States is far larger, as mass shootings account for only a small percentage of deaths and injuries. Justice Breyer’s dissent began by noting that firearms killed 45,222 Americans in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and that shootings kill more children and adolescents than any other cause, including motor vehicle crashes.\n\nThe United States has more civilian-owned firearms than citizens — about 120 guns per 100 people, according to statistics Justice Breyer cited — and also has a much higher rate of gun violence than other wealthy democracies.\n\nJustice Breyer argued that the six-justice majority that struck down New York’s law had erred by not taking that toll into account and instead basing its application of the Second Amendment “nearly exclusively on history.”\n\n“It refuses to consider the government interests that justify a challenged gun regulation, regardless of how compelling those interests may be. The Constitution contains no such limitation, and neither do our precedents,” he wrote, adding: “In my view, when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed often necessary, for them to consider the serious dangers and consequences of gun violence that lead states to regulate firearms.”\n\nJustice Breyer wrote that the court was considering the degree to which the Second Amendment prevents governments from enacting laws to address gun violence. But the court ignored the magnitude of the violence itself, he said:\n\n“The court today purports to answer that question without discussing the nature or severity of that problem.”\n\nChristine Hauser contributed reporting.\n\nFifteen Republicans crossed party lines to side with Democrats in support of the measure, which passed 65 to 33.\n\nThe 80-page bill falls short of the toughest gun control measures that Democrats have long sought, but its enactment would still represent a remarkable breakthrough after years of stalemate in Congress on addressing gun violence in the United States. To win over Republicans, Democrats had to drop some of their more expansive proposals, many of which have passed the House but stalled in the Senate amid Republican opposition.\n\nHere’s a look at what’s in the bill — and what was left out.\n\nEnhanced background checks for younger gun buyers\n\nJuvenile records, including those regarding mental health, would for the first time be required in criminal background checks for prospective gun buyers under the age of 21, and authorities would have more time to conduct the checks — 10 days, up from the current three.\n\nUnder the legislation, federal authorities would have to check with local law enforcement and review state records to determine if a prospective buyer has a juvenile criminal or mental health history that would disqualify them from purchasing a gun. If they found such a record, they would turn it over to the F.B.I. for further investigation.\n\nWhat was left out: The proposal falls far short of legislation that has passed the House that would ban anyone under the age of 21 from buying a semiautomatic weapon.\n\nDemocrats also agreed to allow the enhanced background check requirement for younger buyers to expire after 10 years, leaving future Congresses to haggle over whether it should be extended. A similar “sunset” provision allowed the federal assault weapons ban enacted in 1994 to lapse in 2004, to the dismay of Democrats, who have never been able to muster enough support to revive it.\n\nAnd there is a limit on how long authorities would be able to reach back into a buyer’s mental health history; such records from before a potential buyer turned 16 could not disqualify them from buying a gun.\n\nIncentives for states to implement red flag laws\n\nThe bill would provide $750 million in federal money to states that create so-called red flag laws, which allow guns to be temporarily confiscated from people deemed dangerous by a judge. The funding, meant to incentivize the enactment of such measures, would also support the creation of crisis intervention court programs.\n\nWhat was left out: Democrats wanted to go further than providing incentives to states and enact a federal red flag measure, passed in the House, that would allow guns to be taken from anyone deemed by a federal judge to be dangerous.\n\nClosing the ‘boyfriend loophole’\n\nOne of the bill’s last sticking points was a provision to toughen federal law to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. It would expand current law that bars people convicted of domestic violence or subject to a domestic violence restraining order from buying a gun. The current law applies only to people who are married to or lived with the victim, or had a child with them.\n\nThe legislation would include other intimate partners, closing what has come to be known as the “boyfriend loophole.”\n\nWhat was left out: Democrats wanted a blanket prohibition, but in negotiations with Republicans, they agreed to allow some offenders to regain the ability to purchase a gun. If a person is a first-time offender and the crime is a violent misdemeanor, the ban would disappear five years after the end of their criminal sentence, so long as they did not commit further violent crimes. Negotiators also agreed not to make the provision retroactive, bowing to another demand by Republicans.\n\nFunding for mental health and school safety\n\nThe bill would allocate billions of dollars to schools and communities for expanding mental health programs. The funding also aims to boost school safety. The bill grants $300 million over five years for school safety programs targeting violence that would fund school resource officers and beef up security in schools. In addition, funding would go to training school personnel and adults who interact with minors to respond to mental health issues.\n\nWhat was left out: Republicans insisted on keeping the cost of the bill as low as possible. In total, the measure would cost $13.2 billion.\n\nTougher penalties on illegal purchases\n\nThe bill would crack down on “straw purchasers” or people who buy guns for those who would not qualify. No current law specifically prohibits these purchasers or illegal gun trafficking, so prosecutors have relied on people who make false statements in connection with purchasing a gun.\n\nThe bill would establish a penalty of up to 15 years in prison or 25 years if the firearms are used in connection with serious criminal activity like drug trafficking or terrorism. It would also provide resources to help prevent and investigate these purchases.\n\nWhat was left out: The bill does not include more sweeping measures to impose universal background checks or ban the sale of large-capacity magazines. Republicans also said they refused to consider any mandatory waiting period for gun sales or a license requirement to purchase an assault weapon.\n\nAnnie Karni contributed reporting.\n\nZeneta Everhart, whose 21-year-old son Zaire Goodman was shot in Buffalo but survived, said in an interview Thursday that “as a mother, I’m heartbroken that this country isn’t protecting Zaire.”\n\n“It’s ridiculous,” Ms. Everhart said. “When is enough going to be enough? What else has to happen before this country wakes up and understands that the people in this country don’t feel safe. The government, the courts, the lawmakers, they are here to protect us — and I don’t feel protected.”\n\nShe added that while she supports the tenets of the Second Amendment, she believes that “people should have to earn the right to handle a firearm in this country.”\n\nIn his concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito directly cited the May 14 massacre, suggesting that it showed the state’s law was not improving safety.\n\n“Will a person bent on carrying out a mass shooting be stopped if he knows that it is illegal to carry a handgun outside the home?” he wrote. “And how does the dissent account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the top of its list took place in Buffalo? The New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator.”\n\nGarnell Whitfield Jr., whose 86-year-old mother Ruth Whitfield was killed in the massacre, said in a Thursday interview that he believed the reference to Buffalo was inappropriate.\n\n“If he wanted to bring up Buffalo, he should have talked about white supremacy,” he said in reference to the racist ideologies espoused by the gunman. “The court is illegitimate at this point. It’s completely been politicized.”\n\nMr. Whitfield Jr. said that he felt the nation was taking “one step forward and two steps back,” given that the decision came on the same day that the Senate moved closer to approving bipartisan gun safety legislation.\n\n“It’s a kick in the teeth. It’s hurtful,” he said.\n\nNew York became the first in the nation to pass new legislation earlier this month in the shadow of the killings in Buffalo and Uvalde, approving several bills including one to increase the minimum age to purchase a semiautomatic rifle from 18 to 21.\n\nWayne Jones, who lost his mother Celestine Chaney, 65, in the Buffalo massacre, said Thursday that he held mixed feelings about the decision. He empathizes with residents who might worry about weapons being carried, he said, but shares the view of public defenders that the current law disproportionately affected people of color.\n\n“My thing about the gun situation is they’ve targeted the Black community,” Mr. Jones said in an interview. “The big fight needs to be these assault weapons. You don’t need them. And we need to get them off the streets.”"
