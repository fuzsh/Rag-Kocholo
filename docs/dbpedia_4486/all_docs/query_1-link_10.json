        "text": "Gun violence is a complex, ever-evolving crisis. No one strategy will prevent every type of shooting, but we do know the effective policies and programs that, when deployed in concert, have been proven to reduce gun violence as a whole.\n\nThe gun lobby fights progress at every turn—in statehouses, in the courts, in elections—while also devising workarounds to existing laws in order to turn a profit. To save lives, gun safety advocates have had to adjust their approach, anticipating loopholes and countering extremism. This year states raised their grades in creative and unexpected ways, enacting innovative policies to stop gun violence.\n\nDespite scandals rocking the gun lobby in recent years and plummeting public support, the industry still makes billions. Bold lawmakers have started hitting gun companies where it hurts—their wallets—while also repealing laws that shield gunmakers from liability and even taxing the gun industry to fund violence intervention programs.\n\nTechnological innovations have accelerated the gun violence crisis as well. Ghost guns, bump stocks, and more are all designed to skirt gun safety laws and make it easier to take lives—but lawmakers are fighting to make these workarounds illegal. At the same time, social media has facilitated a rise in extremism that puts our democracy at risk, compelling legislators in a number of states to take action to prevent armed political violence and intimidation.\n\nIt’s important to remember that policy is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to stopping gun violence. Leaders need to take a holistic approach that features working with the communities most impacted by violence, defending commonsense gun laws in court, and even issuing executive orders. Together, we’ll break gun lobby obstruction and save lives."
