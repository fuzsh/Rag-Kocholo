Movie plot tags

A zany parody that is peppered with famous characters, all of whom are cheerfully slandered, including Picasso's father who joins the Nazis; a sulking Ernest Hemingway knitting in a corner; and Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Tolkas, played by men in drag. The dialogue is spoken in a jumble of European languages happily mixed with grunt, hollers and nonsensical syllables. Amazingly, all is as clear as can be, or as clear as the story allows, which is quite a different matter. Adventures of Picasso is, at once, witty and childlike, sophisticated and slapstick, irreverent and unabashedly vulgar!
