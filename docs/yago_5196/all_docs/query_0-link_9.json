        "text": "The Adventures of Picasso'' is billed as ''a lunatic comedy,'' and while it does achieve that feeling on a couple of rare occasions, for the most part it's like a bad dream. This leaden Swedish farce invents a life of slapstick and idiocy for the artist, and parenthetically lambasts everyone from Rembrandt to Toulouse-Lautrec in the process. Ernest Hemingway is seen sitting in a Parisian cafe, wearing a T-shirt that says ''Hemingway'' and knitting mittens. It's remarkable that a film can be so full of fancifulness without developing anything resembling real wit.\n\n''The Adventures of Picasso,'' which opens at Cinema I today, is something of a linguistic curiosity. Very little of it is in English, and it veers at random from one language to another. Yet no subtitles are necessary - the comedy is that broad. When World War I is declared, for instance, a newspaper boy comes by with a headline reading ''Boom! Krasch! Bang!'' When the actors are supposed to be Spaniards in Madrid, they spend a lot of time saying ''Caramba!''\n\nThe film's strategy is to make everything as feverishly absurd as it can be. When a costume party is held, for instance, a large red balloon is introduced as the President of France in a balloon suit - that's one of the better laughs. Salvador Dali, seen painting on the beach, has long melting fingers that scare the bathers. Amusing touches are outnumbered by asinine ones, though, and there's no unifying attitude toward the artist or his life. Pablo Picasso, as played by Gosta Ekman, is simply a buffoon in white shorts who becomes bald-headed and wealthy in his old age.\n\nOccasionally, there are funny routines that draw their inspiration from the artist's work. The best of these features Picasso hiding his friends from the Nazis by disguising them as furniture, with three women hanging onto a curtain rod and pretending to be draperies. And by its ending, as Picasso is being followed even to the bathroom by tourists who treat his house as if it were a museum, the film has found something like a satirical edge. But too much of it has the ring of desperation. It's all too frantic for words."
