        "text": "Sagan om Karl-Bertil Jonssons julafton (Template:Lang-en) is a 1975 Swedish animated short film directed by Per Åhlin, adapted from Tage Danielsson's short story of the same name, telling the tale of a boy who steals Christmas gifts from the wealthy to give to the poor people of Stockholm while working in a post office on Christmas Eve. The film has gained huge popularity in Sweden, and is broadcast every Christmas Eve on Swedish and Norwegian national television. It is also often shown on Christmas Eve by FST in Finland.\n\nThe film was dubbed to English into 1987, with Bernard Cribbins as the voice-over.\n\nCast[]\n\nTage Danielsson as Narrator\n\nPer Andrén as Karl-Bertil Jonsson\n\nToivo Pawlo as Tyko Jonsson\n\nMarianne Stjernqvist as Mrs Jonsson\n\nÅke Fridell as H.K. Bergdahl\n\nCatrin Westerlund as Mrs Bergdahl\n\nCriticism[]\n\nA Swedish debate about the tale's moral nature has sparked every few years ever since SVT started broadcasting it annually, with critics arguing that it is too political and that stealing isn't really on par with traditional Christmas spirit. Danielsson's response was that it is only a tale and shouldn't be overanalyzed.[1][2][3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
