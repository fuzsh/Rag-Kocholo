        "text": "The Swedish actor Lena Nyman has died of cancer aged 66, a day after the death of Maria Schneider. Both actors were instantly associated with a sexually explicit film: Schneider with Last Tango in Paris and Nyman with I Am Curious (Yellow). But while Schneider's career and life suffered consequently, Nyman went on to establish herself as a well-loved performer in her native country.\n\nCut by 11 minutes in Britain, I Am Curious (Yellow) (1967), directed by Vilgot Sjöman, was seized by the US customs, pronounced obscene and banned. But a federal appeals court then ruled that it was protected under the first amendment, which allowed it to be released in March 1969 – though only in New York and New Jersey. From today's perspective, it seems much ado about nothing, but the brouhaha helped it remain the most financially successful foreign film in the US for 23 years; it brought Nyman international fame and paved the way for movies such as Last Tango in Paris (1972).\n\nIn the film, Nyman is an amateur sociologist conducting interviews with workers, women and young people, mainly about Swedish class structure. \"Do we have a class system in Sweden?\" she asks. \"It depends on the people,\" comes the reply. \"Undress them, and they're all the same; dress them, and you have a class system.\" Therein lies the key to the film; Nyman has a passionate affair with a working-class visitor to her father's apartment. They copulate in her bedroom, outside the royal palace, in a tree, on the grass and in a pond.\n\nThe main interest of I Am Curious (Yellow), which reflects the changing political and sexual climate of Europe in the late 1960s, was its blend of newsreels, cinéma vérité techniques and meta-narrative, much influenced by Jean-Luc Godard. This succès de scandale was followed in 1968 by I Am Curious (Blue) – yellow and blue are the colours of the Swedish flag – which used material left over from the earlier film, including the fictitious affair between the director and his star. Vincent Canby, of the New York Times, wrote that Sjöman showed \"obvious affection for Lena of the earnest, pretty face and the somewhat rotund figure that betrays every candy bar she has ever eaten. It looks like real love.\"\n\nNyman, who was born in Stockholm, started acting as a child, appearing in her first film, Dangerous Promise (1955), at the age of 11, playing a girl who witnesses a murder. In the same year, she appeared in the film version of the popular children's novel Rasmus and the Vagabond. By the time Sjöman discovered her, Nyman had made four films, and had graduated from the Royal Dramatic School in Stockholm.\n\nSjöman first cast Nyman in 491 (1964), the title of which refers to the biblical passage in which Jesus proclaimed that each man will be forgiven \"70 times seven\". The film promised to be about \"the 491st sin\" – audiences could take their pick from rape, sodomy and bestiality. It dealt with a group of six teenage boys who participate in a social experiment – they are encourag- ed to behave in an antisocial way without punishment. Nyman played one of their victims.\n\nFew could make a connection between the \"Curious\" films and her subsequent career. As a member of the Royal Dramatic theatre, she played Gina Ekdal in Ibsen's The Wild Duck, Polly in Brecht and Weill's The Threepenny Opera and Bertha in Strindberg's The Father. The latter acclaimed production, directed by Alf Sjöberg, became a 1969 film with Nyman repeating her role as the unhappy daughter fought over by a retired army captain and his wife.\n\nA few years later, in Autumn Sonata (1978), Ingmar Bergman's chamber work of Strindbergian intensity, she gave a remarkable performance as the severely disabled younger daughter of Ingrid Bergman.\n\nAfter Autumn Sonata, Nyman was seen rarely outside Scandinavia because she concentrated largely on unexportable Swedish comedies, several by the popular writing-directing-performing comedy team of Tage Danielsson and Hans Alfredson. Among the best were Release the Prisoners to Spring (1975), The Adventures of Picasso (1978) and The Simple-Minded Murderer (1982).\n\nNyman was married twice, both times briefly."
