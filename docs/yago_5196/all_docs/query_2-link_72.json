It is derived from the Old Norse word \"taki,\" meaning \"day.\" This name has gained popularity in recent years, particularly in the United States. In American English pronunciation, Tage is pronounced as TAYG (/teɪdʒ/). It has a unique and distinctive sound that sets it apart from more common names. While not extremely popular, the name Tage has been steadily used for newborn boys over the past few decades. Its usage has seen some fluctuation, but overall it remains a relatively uncommon choice. If you're looking for a name that is both unique and rooted in Scandinavian heritage, Tage might be the perfect choice for your little one.\n\nPronunciation\n\nAmerican English"
