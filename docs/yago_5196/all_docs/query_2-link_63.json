        "text": "It gives coming generations a deep and more versatile understanding of themselves and their fellows, and of their place in history and society. Further, perspectives from the humanities and social sciences can create an in-depth understanding of humans as social, historical and political beings. Throughout life, language, literature and art can be pathways not only to self-insight but also to societal understanding and compassion.\n\nKnowledge in the humanities and an artistic perspective contribute in this way to the type of culture and historical awareness that is necessary to make wise decisions. In-depth historical studies and a comparative perspective create understanding of our history and present, which is required to build a society characterised by sustainability, democracy, compassion and social justice.\n\nThus, the professorship programme is founded on the concept of education and research in the humanities, social sciences and artistic disciplines, as part of the foundation of a democratic society.\n\nThrough these professorships, Linköping University aspires to contribute to societal development based on knowledge, a broader utilisation of the knowledge assets of the academic world, and a society characterised by credibility, security and trust. It aspires also to the clear communication of these values to coming generations.\n\nNominations\n\nAppointment will be through a nomination procedure in which primarily research environments at the Department of Culture and Society can propose candidates.\n\nThe professorships will he held for a period of 1-3 years. The holders are expected to spend the majority of their time at Linköping University during this period, and will receive an appropriate academic salary at the level of professor, as agreed.\n\nLinköping University will through these professorships attract people to the university renowned for scholarly or artistic expertise.\n\nThe programme is intended for prominent researchers in the humanities and social sciences, and those in elements of the educational sciences focussed on the humanities. The programme is also intended for authors, educators, teachers, journalists, writers, artists, film creators, photographers and those active in other art forms. The professorships may be awarded to Swedish and international applicants.\n\nAppointed to the Tage Danielsson professorship 2021-2022\n\nWhy did the Vikings raise runestones? How can we understand the Rök runestone? Which grammatical models can help both teacher and pupil? These are questions that Per Holmberg focused on as visiting professor.\n\nPer Holmberg is professor of Swedish at the University of Gothenburg, intensely interested in how language is used in different situations. His research focusses on how speech and text function in various social contexts and covers many fields – from conversations between young people, cooking programs on TV, the essays of school pupils, situations vacant announcements, and runestones. Holmberg has worked as teacher of Swedish and religious studies in secondary and upper secondary schools – and from this work he brings with him a specialisation in, and interest for, the way we use language.\n\nPhoto credit Magnus Johansson\n\nAppointed to the Moa Martinson professorship 2021-2023\n\nWriting and social questions will be in focus for Susanna Alakoski as she takes up a visiting professorship at the Department of Culture and Society. She will devote her time to stimulating and improving writing skills in research and education.\n\nSusanna Alakoski has published several novels, children’s books and essays. Her debut novel, Svinalängorna, in 2006 was awarded the August Prize and has been transferred to both the cinema and the theatre. Her work depicts women’s history, social vulnerability and poverty, but also survival, joy and love.\n\nAlakoski studied as a social worker, and worked in this profession before turning to writing. She has a strong commitment to issues of society and social politics.\n\nPhoto credit Magnus Johansson"
