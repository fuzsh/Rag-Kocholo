The 6th of June is our National Day and we celebrate it because of reasons that hardly any Swede knows, some historians found a speach by a king from the mid-1550s that happened to happen on 6th of June, while other historians says it's a latter day creation. So it doesn't matter if this list comes a day late.\n\nThese 10 movies chosen by BFI (British Film Institute) tries to be as diversive as possible with only one movie per director.\n\nThese kind of lists are always discussable (and please do!), I see them more as a good way to start if someone out there is interested in Swedish movies (as in this post), and then each and every one can make up their own minds if any of those created any curiosity to go further.\n\nI've chosen to use the English or International titles in this post.\n\nThe chosen ones are:\n\nSir Arne’s Treasure 1919, Director Mauritz Stiller\n\nWitchcraft Through the Ages 1922, Director Benjamin Christensen (who is actually a Dane, but the movie is Swedish).\n\nMiss Julie 1951, Director Alf Sjöberg\n\nWild Strawberries 1957, Director Ingmar Bergman\n\nRaven's End 1963, Director Bo Widerberg\n\nI Am Curious (Yellow) 1967, Director Vilgot Sjöman\n\nThe Emigrants 1971, Director Jan Troell\n\nShow Me Love 1998, Director Lukas Moodysson\n\nSongs from the Second Floor 2000, Director Roy Andersson\n\nLet the Right One In 2008, Director Tomas Alfredson\n\nThose were the chosen ones. Agree or disagree? please discuss, the speech is free!\n\nFor more indepth reading about each movie, the complete artice is here: BFI 10 Swedish essentials\n\nPost by Chalice_Of_Evil on\n\nSince it was the Swedish National Day yesterday I thought this could be a bit fun. The 6th of June is our National Day and we celebrate it because of reasons that hardly any Swede knows, some historians found a speach by a king from the mid-1550s that happened to happen on 6th of June, while other historians says it's a latter day creation. So it doesn't matter if this list comes a day late.\n\nSeeing you mention Swedish National Day reminded me of when I was looking at videos on YouTube featuring Swedish actress Alicia Vikander and stumbled across this one where she talks about Sweden's Midsummer Holiday.\n\nI had been waiting since first finding that^ video to post it on the date the holiday is celebrated...then promptly forgot. Oh well, better late than never. I figured this was probably as good a thread as any. I hope you don't mind.\n\nBack on the subject of Swedish films...\n\nHirundoRustica first directed my attention towards the film Arn: The Knight Templar (2007).\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arn_%E2%80%93_The_Knight_Templar\n\nIt was sometime after I started watching the TV series Bron/Broen (aka The Bridge) starring Swedish actress Sofia Helin.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_(2011_TV_series)\n\nThe reason I took an interest in the movie was because she starred in it. I own the ‘Extended Version’ on Blu-ray.\n\nApologies if any of this^ is OT.\n\nPost by mikef6 on\n\nI’ll play contrarian here. I have seen 6 of the 10 but most were seen years ago. If you are going to pick only 10 from more than a century of great films, then – except one – they are worthy choices.\n\nHere’s where I get all over contrary:\n\nOne of the recent ones is “Song From The Second Floor” (2000) – which I loved. I also really like Andersson’s other films “You, The Living” (2007) and “A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence” (2014) (English titles, of course).\n\nThe most modern one is “Let The Right One In” which I thought was an unpleasant exercise full of vampire and modern “horror” tropes. I have to shake my head whenever the title or its English language remake shows up on any “Best” list.\n\nPost by teleadm on\n\nThanks teleadm … That still from Curious Yellow has finally inspired me to watch tonight, the film has sat unwatched for years on my shelves !\n\nI enjoy Swedish classic cinema very much... Erotikon (1920) is a sensational silent from Mauritz Stiller , the dark dramas of Hasse Ekman Flicka och hyacinter (1950) , the sensual romance of Lars-Magnus Lindgren, Käre John (1964) and a favourite comedy is Äppelkriget (1971) the Apple War from Tage Danielsson\n\nI agree, when doing those kind of lists a few directors falls behind. unfairly like Hasse Ekman, Lars-Magnus Lindgren and Tage Danielson, since they too made some great movies, and Girl with Hyacints is a great movie, sadly Ekman's films in his later career was a bit out of touch and too old-fashioned, or even too popular, and I guess that's why he is seldom mentioned.\n\nHis father was Gösta Ekman, whi played Leslie Howard's role in the Swedish version of Intermezzo.\n\nLars-Magnus Lindgren breakthough was Angels, Do they Exist?, and Dear John offcourse, but sadly at the end of the 1960's his directorial career somehow petered out.\n\nTage Danielsson was part of the comedy team of Hasse o Tage, who created some marvelous revues that was also televised over the years, mixing comedy and satiric bite.\n\nThanks for your respons!\n\nPost by teleadm on\n\nSince it was the Swedish National Day yesterday I thought this could be a bit fun.

I own the ‘Extended Version’ on Blu-ray.\n\nApologies if any of this^ is OT.\n\nI wrote in my original OP that the speach is free, so don't worry! as long as we don't quarrel and call each other stupid names.\n\nThe Vikander clip was fun. The Midsummer feasts differs from north to the south, and is one of the few Pagan holidays we have left, it's not a specific day nowdays (it once was), the last week-end in June is the usual date. Midsummer Eve is also a traditional day to marry, my parents did.\n\nIt's still called a Maypole (Majstång) even if it is in June, I think it was a decision that it might be possible that North and South Sweden have the same weather at the end of June.\n\nWhile Swedes dances around the pole, and we like to dance fast, I too remember that \"that little frogs are funny to look at, without ears and tails\" and Quack-ack-ack, Quack-ack-ack (One is supposed to jump around with bended knees, and I can't do that anymore).\n\nAnother Midsummer song that I remember, in a slightly hipper version.\n\nPost by manfromplanetx on\n\nThanks teleadm … That still from Curious Yellow has finally inspired me to watch tonight, the film has sat unwatched for years on my shelves !\n\nI agree, when doing those kind of lists a few directors falls behind. unfairly like Hasse Ekman, Lars-Magnus Lindgren and Tage Danielson, since they too made some great movies, and Girl with Hyacints is a great movie, sadly Ekman's films in his later career was a bit out of touch and too old-fashioned, or even too popular, and I guess that's why he is seldom mentioned.\n\nHis father was Gösta Ekman, whi played Leslie Howard's role in the Swedish version of Intermezzo.\n\nLars-Magnus Lindgren breakthough was Angels, Do they Exist?, and Dear John offcourse, but sadly at the end of the 1960's his directorial career somehow petered out.\n\nTage Danielsson was part of the comedy team of Hasse o Tage, who created some marvelous revues that was also televised over the years, mixing comedy and satiric bite.\n\nThanks for your respons!\n\nThanks so much Teleadm I have been most interested and have noted some great recs...\n\nFollowing on we finally got Curious and watched Yellow last night... Well the list does say \"essential\" which is not exactly the same as the best.\n\nWith a very low user rating of 6 at IMDb I must admit I also did not fully enjoy this film, and was glad when the end credits finally rolled. Essential as a historical cinematic curio certainly. I found it to be a bit of a muddled mess ...\n\nDid I miss something ? am I getting old !! I think Blue will have to sit on the shelves for some time yet before I get motivated to watch it...\n\nHappy Viewing to you..."
