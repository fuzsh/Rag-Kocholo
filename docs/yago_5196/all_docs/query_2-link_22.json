        "text": "Every Christmas Eve since 1975 people in Sweden have settled down in front of the TV to watch Karl-Bertil Jonsson\"s Christmas Eve, an animated film by Per Åhlin based on a story by Tage Danielsson from his \"Tales for Children over the Age of 18\". This book tells the story of Karl-Bertil Jonsson. The illustrations are taken from the film which is so familiar to all Swedes.\n\nPer Åhlin is an acclaimed animator with many children\"s films to his name. Tage Danielsson was an author, actor, poet and film director. He was well-known for his particular brand of humanistic humour, always fighting for a just cause, exactly like Karl-Bertil.\n\nKarl-Bertil\"s motto comes from his idol Robin Hood: \"To take from the rich and give to the poor.\" In the season of Christmas he tries to follow in his idol\"s footsteps...\n\nTage Danielsson was a Swedish author, actor, poet and film director. He is best known for his collaboration with Hans Alfredson in the comedy-duo Hasseåtage.\n\nDanielsson matriculated at the University of Uppsala in 1949, where he got involved in student theatre of Östgöta Nation and became a member of the Juvenalorden, as well as serving as vice president of the Uppsala Student Union.\n\nAfter graduation, Tage Danielsson found work at Sveriges Radio in 1955. From 1959 to 1962 he was the manager for its entertainment department. At his work he came in contact with Hans Alfredson. They started the entertainment production company AB Svenska Ord together in 1961.\n\nSvenska Ord in general, and Danielsson in particular, excelled in making scorching comments on current events in an illusorily naive and outward-lookingly friendly way that often succeeded to endear even political opponents to his particular brand of humorist humanism. He was also a constant campaigner behind the scene for causes ranging from Anti-Apartheid to Anti-Nuclear to social solidarity, and a regular contributor to the anarcho-syndicalist newspaper Arbetaren.\n\nIn 1980 he received an honorary doctorate at Linköping University."
