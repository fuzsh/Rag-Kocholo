        "text": "The Adventures of Picasso Starring Gosta Ekman, Hans Alfredson, Margaretha Krook, Bernard Cribbins, Wilfrid Brambell, Per Oscarsson, Lennart Nyman, Lena Nyman, Birgitta Andersson. Directed by Tage Danielsson. 1980. New Star Video. 88 minutes. $59.95. Not rated.\n\nHemingway, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with his name, sits in a Parisian cafe and knits mittens. Dali paints on a beach and scares away bathers as his long fingers melt like molasses toffee. And Picasso hides friends from the Nazis by disguising them as furnishings in his house (three hang from rods as they pretend to be curtains).\n\n''The Adventures of Picasso,'' Janet Maslin said in The Times, is billed as a ''lunatic comedy,'' and while it does achieve that feeling on a couple of rare occasions, for the most part it's like a bad dream.''\n\nThe movie, she said, ''invents a life of slapstick and idiocy for the artist, and parenthetically lambastes everyone from Rembrandt to Toulouse-Lautrec in the process.\n\n''The film's strategy is to make everything as feverishly absurd as it can be. When a costume party is held, for instance, a large red balloon is introduced as the President of France in a balloon suit - that's one of the better laughs.''\n\nPicasso, played by Gosta Ekman, ''is simply a buffoon in white shorts who becomes bald-headed and wealthy in his old age,'' Ms. Maslin said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
