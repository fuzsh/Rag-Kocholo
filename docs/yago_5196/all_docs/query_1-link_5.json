        "text": "An unemployed man looks down from his window at a female street musician singing in front of a symphony orchestra in his courtyard. He immediately falls in love with the songstress, and runs after her along the streets of Stockholm. They pass a lonesome woman, who at once falls in love with the unemployed man, and starts chasing him. The trio continues to chase each other, split, and start chasing again, while they pass through a series of absurd situations among eccentric persons. Unable to get the man she loves, the lonesome woman goes to a restaurant, and starts drinking. Next morning she finds a stranger in her bed. He presents himself as Björkman. Both try to get away from the embarrassing situation as quickly as possible. Meanwhile the unemployed man tries in vain to win the songstress. The chase continues. Suddenly the lonesome woman realizes that she loves Björkman. She tells him that they must get married, because she is pregnant. At the wedding party Björkman falls in love with another woman, and when she leaves, he starts chasing her. He is followed by the lonesome woman, the songstress, and several others, all of them chasing one another in a long string.\n\nA German business man, Volkswagner, comes to Österlen in the south of Sweden to build Deutschneyland, a gigantic amusement park for German tourists. The local councilors and the member of parliament are all in favor of the idea, although it will turn vast areas into parking lots for cars. The Lindberg family does not like the idea and with the help of a little magic, they start scheming against it."
