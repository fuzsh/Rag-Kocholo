        "text": "It’s been over a year since the latest update to my most-wanted films list, and you better believe I’ve been finding new must-see/can’t-see titles all the time. Here are 25 of the most fascinating and/or elusive of them, some of which can at least be tracked down – some of which can’t.\n\nThe Adventures of Picasso (1978)\n\nA surreal Swedish comedy by the comedian and filmmaker Tage Danielsson, whose body of work includes two other films I’d love to see (Out of an Old Man’s Head and Egg! Egg! A Hardboiled Story). This particular film is a fanciful “biopic” about the life of Picasso, with frequently absurd dialogue in multiple languages, linked by narration which can be dubbed depending on the country – and if I can get ahold of the English version, that’ll make up for not finding a version with subtitles (which has been the case so far).\n\nAlmonds and Raisins (1984)\n\nA documentary on the Yiddish cinema of the late 20s and 30s, featuring numerous clips and interviews with those involved. Although the increased availability of the actual films makes up for this film being so hard to find (in fact, at the moment it’s effectively impossible to find), I’d really love to hear from the people who made them – and it doesn’t hurt that it’s narrated by Orson Welles and that Ralph Steadman did the awesome poster which you see here.\n\nAmerica First (1972)\n\nAfter making the wonderful, long-unseen Spring Night Summer Night, Joseph L. Anderson made only one other feature. The logline: “A previously isolated Appalachian region is infiltrated by seven travelers, who seek to create a utopian community with the residents. A television documentary crew films the fraught interactions.” Sounds pretty intriguing, especially given how good Spring Night was. But reviews, images, or any other substantial trace of the film eluded me, until I came upon this article, which notes:\n\nPeter has sent me information on a second planned restoration: “Joe only made one other feature after SNSN, AMERICA FIRST (1972), but it was never released. I actually hold all the original materials on the film and hope to do preservation on it…assuming I can find the funding. It’s a sort-of follow up to SNSN, though very different in tone. Filmed in color, in the same area, but more like ZABRISKIE POINT than SNSN!” Eminent cinematographer Ed Lachman…began his film career by shooting America First, and he has agreed to participate in the color correction.\n\nSo yeah, I really hope that happens, because I’d absolutely love to see this. Fingers crossed.\n\nArruza (1972)\n\nBudd Boetticher’s last two films are both of considerable interest to me; one is the offbeat Western A Time for Dying (fairly easy to find online), and the other is this documentary about the bullfighter Carlos Arruza, which Boetticher spent most of the 1960s making, and according to Wikipedia, he “fought with the Mexican government and unions; ran out of money twice…was evicted from hotels; and put into prison and a sanatorium.” On top of all that, Arruza was killed in a car accident in 1966, before shooting was complete. The fact that Boetticher got the film finished at all compels my attention, although the reviews I’ve seen haven’t been glowing. There was, surprisingly, a VHS release 35 years ago, but it’s now very hard (though not impossible) to track down.\n\nThe Balcony (1963)\n\nBefore courting controversy (and earning an Oscar nomination for Adapted Screenplay) with his adaptation of Ulysses, Joseph Strick adapted a play by provocateur Jean Genet about a brothel in a country racked by revolution, with Shelley Winters as the madam, Peter Falk as the chief of police, and a supporting cast including Lee Grant, Ruby Dee, and Leonard Nimoy. On top of that, it managed to get an Oscar nod for B&W Cinematography and a Writers Guild nod for its script. It’s one of the easiest films on this list to find (it’s even available on Blu-Ray), but it remains somewhat obscure.\n\nThe Dance of Death (1969)\n\nA film of August Strindberg’s play about a turbulent marriage, essentially a film of a National Theatre production – but one that starred Laurence Olivier and Geraldine McEwan. As a lifelong thespian – albeit one who’s had little experience with Strindberg – it’s of decided interest. Although it’s apparently never been released on home video, it can be found online in passable shape. Curiously, it seems to have taken a full decade to have received any Stateside release.\n\nThe Dark at the Top of the Stairs (1960)\n\nWilliam Inge’s plays Come Back Little Sheba, Picnic, and Bus Stop were all made into films which are readily available. And the film of his original screenplay Splendor in the Grass is readily available. But this film, adapted from one of his plays, seems never to have been released on home video and remains difficult to find (although uploads can be found online) despite receiving good reviews, earning Supporting Actress nods for Shirley Knight from the Oscars and Globes alike, and making the NBR Top 10 list. I’m tempted to blame it on the nebulous boogeyman of “rights issues,” but at least there are ways to see it.\n\nThe Double-Barrelled Detective Story (1965)\n\nOn the other hand, I have yet to find a way to see Adolfas Mekas’ film of the Mark Twain story about, essentially, Sherlock Holmes in the Wild West. The trailer can be found, and while it looks rather broad (albeit spirited), I’m quite curious to see how Mekas, a noted figure in independent cinema (although he’s now somewhat in the shadow of his brother Jonas) worked with mainstream talents like Hurd Hatfield, who was playing Pontius Pilate in King of Kings just a few years earlier, and with what seems to be a larger budget than he or his peers typically worked with. According to Mekas’ Wikipedia page, the film was taken out of his hands and not given a proper release, so tracking it down may be especially difficult – all the more surprising, given that the trailer is available.\n\nThe Experiment/Eksperimentet (2010)\n\nThis is not to be confused with the film The Experiment starring Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker; this is a Danish film, based on the Little Danes experiment, in which 22 Greenlandic Inuit children were sent to Denmark to be, quite frankly, re-educated. The results were tragic, with many of the children suffering emotional trauma and dying young; it would take almost 70 years for the Danish government to formally apologize. The film itself has received mixed reviews, and it doesn’t seem to have had a proper American release (I’ve found an upload, but it doesn’t have subtitles), but I’m at the very least curious to see how it handles a heartbreaking true story. It would make an interesting double feature with Sami Blood (which is available with subtitles).\n\nThe Fixer (1968)\n\nHere’s another film which is surprisingly hard to find, given that it was an Oscar nominee for Best Actor (the only nomination of Alan Bates’ career), a Globe nominee for Picture, Actor, Supporting Actor (for Hugh Griffith), and Screenplay (for Dalton Trumbo), a major studio production (MGM), and an adaptation of a Pulitzer-winning novel (by Bernard Malamud), which itself was based on the persecution, in Tsarist Russia, of a Jewish man for a murder he didn’t commit (with blood libel factoring into the “case” against him). Oh, and it was directed by John Frankenheimer, a dark and troubling film to follow comparably unsettling works like The Manchurian Candidate and Seconds. Uploads are easy enough to come by, but it’s a bit strange how much this film has fallen into obscurity.\n\nGive Us This Day/Christ in Concrete/Salt to the Devil (1949)\n\nBetween being one of the Hollywood Ten and naming names, Edward Dmytryk made a couple of films in England, one of them being this drama about a working-class Italian immigrant family in New York (filmed, I should reiterate, in London), based on the novel Christ in Concrete but compelled to use alternate titles for archaic reasons. Barely released in the States and long elusive, it was released on DVD almost 20 years ago, but I’ve never seen a copy in the wild; it is easy to find online, however, and the reviews I’ve read of it are mostly glowing, hailing it as the kind of hidden gem I’m always anxious to uncover. So I’ll probably be seeing this sooner rather than later.\n\nHerostratus (1967)\n\nCW: Suicide.\n\nHere’s a film whose obscurity is much more understandable – a 142-minute experimental satire from the UK, with a premise that seems at once to anticipate Network and remind one of Meet John Doe (an artist attempts to commodify his suicide), given very little release at the time. It’s easier to see nowadays, thanks to a Region 2 Blu-Ray and the subsequent uploads, but it remains pretty obscure, despite being Helen Mirren’s film debut. It looks visually impressive, and while its reputation has never been unreservedly high (some have been dazzled, some confounded), it’s the kind of film I want to see – and hope to champion.\n\nIt’s Showtime (1976)\n\nCapitalizing on the success of That’s Entertainment!, this documentary provides an overview of animals in film, including Lassie, Rin Tin Tin, Flipper, and Trigger. Despite being a major studio release of the 70s, and one which seems to have been fairly well promoted – although the existence of posters with two alternate titles (Paws, Claws & Jaws and The Wonderful World of Those Crazy, Cuckoo Animals) suggests it was not an overwhelming success – it’s now extremely hard to find. I’m not sure if it was ever released on home video – which, given that it’s made up of clips from existing films, might make sorting out the relevant rights a nightmare – but it does appear to have streamed on Netflix at one time, which gives me some hope it’ll resurface. I’ve heard it’s fun, I like animals, and I’m intrigued by this particular variety of documentary. (Found and reviewed here.)\n\nJonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000 (1976)\n\nSwiss filmmaker Alain Tanner is one of those directors who was fairly well regarded at one time, but doesn’t seem to get talked about much anymore (he’s actually still alive, but hasn’t made a feature film since 2004). The high point of his career was probably this intriguingly titled ensemble piece about 60s radicals in the years after the May 1968 protests in France (so, kind of a proto-Big Chill), which was a pretty solid art-house hit at the time, winning the NSFC for Best Screenplay; the script was even translated and published. Despite its success (and generally positive latter-day reviews), it’s fallen into considerable obscurity, having never been released on DVD in the States. Again, one can find uploads, but I’m surprised Criterion hasn’t gotten around to it.\n\nLegacy (1975)\n\nThis film, on the other hand, has never been that well known (it has less than 30 votes on the IMDb) but it was released on DVD about a decade ago and received some pretty supportive reviews, especially for Joan Hotchkis’ performance as a rich woman suffering some kind of a breakdown over the course of 90 minutes (though how much time the film itself covers is apparently unspecified). Hotchkis wrote the script, I believe was based on her one-woman play, giving herself, I’d imagine, by far the most rewarding role of her career. I’m very keen to see it and might well order the DVD (including commentaries and interviews with Hotchkis and director Karen Arthur), but surprisingly, there seem to be no uploads available – unusual for a film with a digital release.\n\nMilestones (1975)\n\nSimilar to Jonah, this is a film about 60s radicals in the 70s, but this is an American film, even larger in scale and far greater in length (a staggering 198 minutes – you know I like my epics), and from what I’ve read, a much darker, rawer, and angrier film. All of this might help to explain why it’s never been very widely seen (it has about 230 votes on the IMDb), and it certainly sounds like a lot to take in, but I’m certainly interested in seeing its panorama of radicalism, especially since, despite its documentary style, it is a dramatic film. It has been released on DVD, but uploads can be found.\n\nOverwhelm the Sky (2018)\n\nA three-hour “existential neo-noir,” inspired by the 1799 novel Edgar Huntly, shown with an overture and intermission during its (very limited) theatrical release (because director Daniel Kremer respects the singular majesty of the roadshow as much as I do), and generally praised by those who’ve seen it, although some have reservations about its enormous length. In other words, it sounds like the kind of movie that was made for me, in the same kind of absurdly ambitious maximalist way a novel like Uwe Johnson’s Anniversaries feels like it was written for me. Luckily, seeing Overwhelm the Sky isn’t all that hard to do – it can be streamed for less than the cost of a ticket – but given how easily it could’ve flown completely under my radar, despite opening so recently and aiming so high, I figure it belongs on this list.\n\nPrurient Interest (1974)\n\nHere’s a film I hadn’t so much as heard of until I came upon while flipping through an old edition of VideoHound, which described it as “A video play revolving around a movie producer’s battle with the Board of Censors for approval of his feature ‘Eat Me in St. Louis.'” Okay, so I was intrigued. A little digging online turned up this page, where a clip of the film (three minutes out of 27) and a good deal of information about its iconoclastic creator, one Willie Boy Walker, can be found. However, beyond that site, the film has all but vanished from sight, despite having been available on videotape at one time. It does look crude, but the subject matter – and the gender dynamics on display in that clip – remain relevant.\n\nTaking Off (1971)\n\nPivoting away from Prurient Interest – a thoroughly independent film – we turn to one of the highest-profile films I can think of that has never been given a proper home-video release in its native country. Miloš Forman, having established himself as a major director in his native Czechoslovakia, moved to America, making his English-language debut with this social satire about a teenage girl who “takes off” and how her parents try to understand the counterculture she’s embraced. Although it wasn’t a popular success, it won the Grand Prix at Cannes and many critics, then and now, have praised it. Despite this, and despite Forman’s subsequent success in America (winning two Oscars), it has never had an official Region 1 release that I know of. It’s not hard to find online, and it’s easy to acquire in Europe, but it’s baffling that Universal has never given it even a barebones release.\n\nTiki Tiki (1971)\n\nGerald Potterton was best known for directing The Railrodder (Buster Keaton’s last great short) and Heavy Metal (a quintessential cult film). But he also made this feature about a group of monkeys making a film, using clips from the Soviet kids’ movie Aybolit-66 to show the fruits of their labors. I’ve seen comparisons of the film to What’s Up, Tiger Lily? and Mystery Science Theater, but the use of animation – at a time when there were relatively few animated features – really piques my curiosity. Unfortunately, it’s virtually impossible to see, with no clear evidence it was ever released on home video. This tweet is the only evidence that it even still exists, and it’s all the more maddening that it remains unavailable. Let’s hope that changes at some point.\n\n2000 Years Later (1969)\n\nYet another major studio release that is damn near impossible to come by, though given that it was apparently an independent production, spent a couple of years on the shelf, and met with little success when it was released, it’s perhaps not surprising that Warner Bros. hasn’t gone out of their way to make it available. But it sounds like a fascinating bit of mod satire: an ancient Roman is sent to modern-day America, is exploited by television hosts (played by Terry-Thomas and veteran comic actor Edward Everett Horton!) and ends up taking part in a televised orgy! It’s the only dramatic feature directed by Bert Tenzer, who otherwise made commercials and documentaries, and it was promoted in a decidedly odd fashion; in addition to the poster shown here, there was another one which declared “It’s Time for an Anti-Movie.” Intriguing, no? Critics weren’t that kind to it, but it has its defenders on the IMDb – and by their accounts, it sounds so wild that, even if it weren’t good, it would be worth a look out of sheer curiosity. But for the time being, it too is pretty much impossible to find; no uploads, no bootlegs, nothing.\n\nThe Virgin and the Gypsy (1970)\n\nAmong the more obscure titles to make the NBR’s Top 10 lists (at least in the last 60 years) is this adaptation of the D.H. Lawrence novel about a cross-cultural romance between a clergyman’s daughter (Joanna Shimkus) and a Roma man (Franco Nero). Presumably, this being Lawrence, there’s some sex along the way. Coming in the wake of the highly successful Lawrence adaptation Women in Love, it was decently well received, but didn’t make the same impression and quickly faded into obscurity, and it’s not the only Lawrence adaptation to do so; the 1960 adaptation of Sons and Lovers is one of the most obscure Oscar nominees for Best Picture post World War II. It’s not that hard to find uploads, however.\n\nWelcome to the Club (1971)\n\nThis entry was sparked by a post on the blog Cinematic Revelations, which mentioned how this comedy, despite being a major studio release, has all but disappeared – except for the posters, which are quite easy to find online. And while the tagline is rather eyeroll-inducing, especially in light of the “equal-opportunity offender” defense used by edgelords, a look at the synopsis suggests a somewhat more serious and complex attempt to detail with issues of racism in the armed forces. Then again, the few reviews I’ve been able to find suggest the film didn’t succeed at doing so, and I’m honestly just curious as to what this, seemingly a raunchier take on The Teahouse of the August Moon, is doing in 1971, or why a film set in Hiroshima (after the bomb, I’m guessing, which adds a whole other layer) was shot on location in exotic Copenhagen.\n\nWildrose (1984)\n\nJohn Hanson, who co-directed the regional period drama Northern Lights (profiled in the first of these lists) directed this romance set against the backdrop of Minnesota’s iron mines by himself. It stars Lisa Eichhorn, who I was sure had been a TV star, but it turns out she wasn’t – she was up for a role on Cheers but didn’t get it, and her career, which started pretty well with acclaim for films like The Europeans, Yanks, and Cutter’s Way, never quite took off. In any case, it’s apparently a pretty good film (Leonard Maltin loved it, others have been a bit more reserved), but it’s never had much of audience, even though Troma (yes, that Troma) was behind the original release, and as of now it has just 75 votes on the IMDb. But there are uploads, so I will get around to seeing it one of these days.\n\nYour Three Minutes Are Up (1973)\n\nAnother film praised by Leonard Maltin, who specifically calls it “overlooked” and “unpretentious,” noting that it “says more about our society than many more ‘important’ movies of recent vintage.” And Keith Bailey of The Unknown Movies says “it without doubt belongs in a list concerning the ten best sleepers of that decade” (that being the 70s). Got your attention yet? It’s a comedy-drama about a straight-laced office drone (Beau Bridges) who gets sucked into the lifestyle of his buddy (Ron Leibman) who cons his way through life. (Reminds me of at least one person I know.) On top of that, it’s heavily compared to Sideways, a film I really love. Luckily, there are uploads online, so I can also cross this one off my list sooner rather than later.\n\nAll-Time Most Wanted:\n\nThese films, drawn from the three lists I’ve made to date, all remain effectively beyond my reach:"
