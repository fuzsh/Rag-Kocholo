        "text": "French director, born in Neuilly in 1961.\n\nAfter a master’s thesis on Tex Avery and the Marx Brothers, Cédric Klapisch left to study cinema at New York University (NYU) in 1983. Back in France, he directed four short films, including the renowned Ce Qui Me Meut about Etienne-Jules Marey. His first feature film, Little Nothings, was nominated at the Césars in 1992. He then directed a television film for ARTE, Le Péril jeune, which also had a theatrical release. The film, which revealed Romain Duris, was a huge success with audiences. He later directed more than ten feature films (including When the Cat's Away, Family Resemblances based on the play by Bacri and Jaoui, Paris, My Piece of the Pie, and his trilogy consisting of Chinese Puzzle, Pot Luck and Russian Dolls) and a number of documentaries including L’Espace d’Un Instant about the prima ballerina Aurélie Dupont, which won a Fipa d’Or in 2010. After the romantic comedy Deux-moi (2019), he confirms his growing interest in the world of dance with En Corps (2022)."
