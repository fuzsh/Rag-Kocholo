        "text": "Pre-War Art Documentaries\n\nDocumentary explorations of art and artists can be found early in film history. Already in the late 1910s, German film studios such as Deutsche Lichtbild and Welt-Kinematograph produced documentary shorts on the sights and monuments of historical cities such as Munich and Seville.1 Strikingly, when visual art started to become the subject of films, it appeared only in the form of architecture and monumental sculpture. Having the advantage that they could be filmed in natural light, churches, palaces and monuments were the pre-eminent subject of early films on art. In spite of the vast majority of films on painting among later art documentaries, it seemed easier to justify filming three-dimensional works, such as sculpture and architecture, as movement of the viewer in space is necessary to see and experience them. Films on art, after all, confront the paradox that art objects are still while films trace movement in space and time. Through editing and camera movements, film added movement to the static artwork. This was the advantage that film was supposed to have over photography. ‘We feel the necessity of movement in order to grasp the statue's immobility,’ famous French art historian Henri Focillon asserted. ‘When we do not have the work itself, but an image of it, cannot it be imagined that the latter, through a clever artifice, will move at our pleasure before us who remain motionless?’2\n\nA way to circumvent the problem of the static artwork was to combine it with movement by showing some sort of activity. Made at the time when museums were supplementing their lantern slide collections with motion pictures, many films on art of the 1920s and 1930s showed, for instance, how to make pottery, how to weave baskets, how Indians made their blankets and so forth.3 Another possibility to make static artworks interesting for cinema was to show famous artists at work-a motif that, as will be demonstrated in the following chapter, would also turn into one of the characteristics of artist biopics. Already in 1915, Sacha Guitry made Ceux de chez nous (Those of Our Land), a twenty-two-minute film on leading French writers and artists including Degas, Monet, Renoir and Rodin. Each artist was shown at work in a lively mixture of close-ups and long shots. Guitry's film, however, presented portraits of the artists rather than showing the creation process of paintings or sculptures. More information on the work process and act of creation can be found in the short films Elias Katz produced in the United States in the late 1930s, although these are no more than simple ten-minute glimpses of artists such as Lynd Ward, William Gropper and George Grosz at work.\n\nUndoubtedly, the most fascinating pre-war film project dealing with artists at work originated in the Institut für Kulturforschung (Institute for Cultural Education), which was founded in Berlin in 1919. Under the direction of art historian Hans Cürlis, this Institute was one of the first organisations that favoured film as a mediator for art.4 In 1922, Cürlis started the film cycle Schaffende Hände (Creating Hands), showing prominent artists such as Liebermann, Corinth, Slevogt, Kollwitz, Pechstein, Kandinsky, Rohlfs, Dix, Grosz, Mataré and Belling at work. Being the first to use the ‘over the shoulder’ shot to give the spectator the same view as the artist, Cürlis showed, in the words of Rudolf Arnheim, ‘the process of a work's creation and the nature of the technique used – for instance colour mixture, hand positions, and hand motions, et cetera.’5 The footage dedicated to Otto Dix, for instance, revealed his technique for modelling in his Three Women (1926), for which he used white paint on the underdrawing. Cürlis, however, filmed not only artists but also artworks. From 1919 onwards, the Institute made several films containing shots of sculptures grouped under titles such as ‘Heads’, ‘Negro Sculpture’, ‘Old-German Madonnas’, ‘German Saints’, ‘Kleinplastik’, ‘Indian Crafts’ or ‘East-Asian Crafts’. Filmed in natural light, each sculpture was put on a pedestal and slowly rotated on its axis. Cürlis, too, considered paintings and drawings unfilmisch. By means of the moving camera, film, in the first place, had to increase the expressive powers of sculptural art-a feature also prominent in the documentary shorts on ‘Nazi sculptors’ Arno Breker and Josef Thorak that Cürlis made together with Arnold Fanck in the 1940s.6\n\nApart from Cürlis's Institute, smaller studios as well as UFA, Germany's major studio, produced films on visual arts during the interwar period. UFA even comprised a unit that produced popular educational shorts for both theatrical and non-theatrical release, and listed art subjects in its catalogues as early as 1922. An often noted UFA Kulturfilm was Steinerne Wunder von Naumburg (Stone Wonders of Naumburg) (1935) by Rudolph Bamberger and Curt Oertel, in which the camera gently moved among the sculpted Gothic figures on the façade and in the interior of the Naumburg cathedral. According to Arthur Knight, it was the first film ‘that suggested the possibility of granting an art experience through the medium of motion picture’.7 A few years later, Oertel realised another impressive film on sculpture with Michelangelo: Das Leben eines Titanen (1940). In several respects, this film announces the innovations that characterise the art documentaries made by filmmakers such as Storck, Emmer and Resnais shortly after the Second World War. First of all, Oertel turned the contemplation of art into a thrilling cinematic experience. With both his mobile camera and skilful lighting, Oertel succeeded in retaining the plasticity of sculptures and the texture of marble surfaces. On the occasion of the American release of The Titan, a critic stated that ‘most people would actually understand the work of Michelangelo better after seeing this movie than they would if they were dropped down in front of the originals. The camera makes you see more than your eyes would even discover.’8 In addition, Oertel uses animation techniques. In the sequence on the Sistine Chapel, for instance, Oertel shows us first the ceiling without any paintings. Then one by one they flash into view while the narrator tells the story of the creation of the frescoes. Furthermore, like the art documentaries by Resnais of the late 1940s, The Titan is not a film simply showing works of art. In the first place, the film tells the story of the dramatic life of the artist without recourse to living actors, sets or dramatics. By means of light, sound effects and (subjective) camera movements, Oertel carries us along through intrigues of popes, conspiracies against the Medici, the death of Savonarola and civil wars. Critics reacted enthusiastically to the sensation that Michelangelo is ‘moving just beyond camera range and that is tremendously exciting’.9 In retrospect, however, this is unmistakably the weakest part of the film. Iris Barry spoke of ‘the rather kittenish fashion in which the camera pretended to be trotting at the heels of the artist’ as a result of which ‘the technique verged on an abuse of the mobile powers of the medium.’10 Nonetheless, this experiment in telling a story exclusively by using artworks proved very influential. Its impact was also the result of its wide distribution. Soon after the film was released, the Nazis showed The Titan throughout Europe as an example of German culture. At the end of the war, the film was captured in France by the U.S. Army. Recognising the unusual cinematic qualities of the film, famous documentarist Robert Flaherty supervised a re-edit. According to Flaherty, ‘even once in a museum you can't see what's there. Only the camera, which catches so much more than the eye, can properly illuminate these subjects.’11\n\nReconstruction and Reproduction\n\nDespite the fascinating experiments by filmmakers such as Cürlis and Oertel, the art documentary only developed into a specific genre after the Second World War. What is more, preceding the breakthrough of the medium of television, the late 1940s and early 1950s can be considered as the golden age of the art documentary. The importance of this genre in that era can be linked with the conditions of a society recovering from the traumas of the Second World War. After the barbarism and obscurantism of Nazism and the devastation of war, film, in its capacity of a mass medium, was called in for the accomplishment of a humanist ideal of cultural emancipation through education. This ideal was also at the basis of the foundation of UNESCO in November 1945. International cultural organisations such as UNESCO and the Fédération internationale des Archives du Film (FIAF) played an important role in the support of the production, distribution and critical contextualisation of art documentaries, which were presented as devices for cultural and educational reconstruction.12\n\nFurthermore, the golden age of the art documentary coincides with a politics of popularisation of the fine arts. During the same years, the cultural participation of the middle and lower classes was expanding-a phenomenon resulting in increasing number of visitors to museums as well as in the breakthrough of the art book, which had already undergone some major changes shortly before the war. Kenneth Clark, for instance, who would much later write and present the milestone BBC television art documentary Civilisation (1969), had published One Hundred Details from Pictures in the National Gallery in 1938. The book turned out an instant success and was followed by the publication of More Details from Pictures in the National Gallery in 1941. Inspired by the improvement of photographic reproduction techniques, both books were made for the pleasure of the eye. Although a few details had been selected ‘for historical or iconographical reasons’, most details ‘have been chosen chiefly for their beauty’, Clark emphasised in the introduction. Clark further remarked that the book contained many details that viewers had never noticed. This means that ‘we do not look at pictures carefully’ and that ‘the great value of these photographic details is that they encourage us to look at pictures more attentively, and show us some of the rewards of patient scrutiny.’13 After the war, both the art documentary and new types of art books encouraged this patient scrutiny. The 1940s and 1950s were the heyday of publishers such as Skira and the years in which André Malraux wrote his Musée imaginaire.14 According to Malraux, in an era of globalisation and proliferation of industrial techniques of reproduction, only photography was capable of preserving and making accessible the world's cultural heritage. The traditional physical museum could be succeeded by a kind of virtual all-encompassing photographic archive, which could be embodied in the phenomenon of the art book. In contrast with the traditional museum, which stimulated the contemplation of unique and isolated masterpieces, the Musée imaginaire was rather based on the juxtaposition of artworks of divergent styles, periods and cultures. Whereas, according to Walter Benjamin, photography and film had a revolutionary potential because they were capable of violating normal perception and destroying the aura of the traditional work of art, for Malraux, modern techniques of mechanical reproduction had a rather ambivalent role. Photography was unmistakably capable of disconnecting the work of art from its original context but it could also reinforce its aura by revealing a kind of immaterial affinity with the entire world heritage or with human creativity as such. Strikingly, for Malraux, the medium of photography supplies the materials for the art book but it is cinema that provides its organisational model. According to Malraux, the art book was, just like a film, a succession of images arranged on the basis of montage.15\n\nFigure 1.1\n\nMalraux's notion of the imaginary museum perfectly coincided with the golden age of the art documentary. Its importance for both the film culture and the art world of the 1940s and 1950s is demonstrated by several phenomena. Leading filmmakers such as Flaherty, Dreyer, Grémillon, Clouzot and Alekan contributed considerably to the development of the genre.16 Art documentaries were a prominent issue at film festivals and several of them won Oscars and other important film awards in these years.17 In addition, prominent critics and film theorists such as Bazin, Francastel, Lemaître, Kracauer and Arnheim paid attention to the phenomenon of the static artwork registered by the moving film camera.18 Furthermore, the encounter between cinema on the one hand and traditional media such as painting and sculpture on the other was also discussed extensively at international conferences, in professional film and art journals and in publications of professional associations.19 Some even mentioned a veritable movement of the film d'art or art film and FIFA (Fédération International du Film sur l'Art) was called into being in 1948. An important subject of discussion popping up regularly in these circles was the question to what extent the art documentary should be considered as an independent phenomenon, which possesses a relative autonomy vis-à-vis the artwork being the subject of the film. Although some stated that the medium of film remained ‘predominantly a machine for seeing better, a remote cousin of the magnifying lens, a periscope, a pair of opera glasses’,20 leading filmmakers presented their ‘documentaries’ not as mere registrations-something that remained the case in the reproduction of art by still photography, including in the model developed by Malraux. Cinematic reproductions of artworks resulted in new filmic artworks-a strategy that in art photography was only developed much later in the works by Louise Lawler or the museum pictures by Thomas Struth, for instance.\n\nLuciano Emmer\n\nDuring the years immediately following the Second World War, some filmmakers specialising in the genre of the art documentary made their public appearances. Strikingly, although the post-war era also saw the production of interesting films dealing with sculpture-Visual Variations on Noguchi (Marie Menken, 1945), Thorvaldsen (Carl Theodor Dreyer, 1949), L'Enfer de Rodin (Henri Alekan, 1959)-painting replaced sculpture and architecture asthe favourite subject of art documentarists. The major figures of the golden age of the art documentary were Luciano Emmer, Henri Storck and Alain Resnais, working in Italy, Belgium and France, respectively – countries with a rich artistic (particularly pictorial) past. Emmer, Storck and Resnais, each of them having close contacts with the avant-garde in one way or another, developed new formulas for the genre of the art documentary that remained customary for decades. All three of them, albeit in divergent ways, set the tone by using a more analytical approach instead of glorifying the artwork as an expression of a divine or human soul.\n\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, the painter Luciano Emmer joined forces with Enrico Gras, an early experimentalist in the cartoon film, to produce a series of experiments in surrealist film, attempting to develop a poetic documentary form.21 After the Fascist Ministry of Culture condemned these films, Emmer was exiled in Switzerland whereas Gras was forced into the army. Together again after the war, they realised a series of innovative and commercially successful short art documentaries. In the first place, Emmer L'Allegoria della primavera (1948) deal with works by Fra Angelico, Carpaccio and Botticelli, respectively. and Gras attempted to transpose the narrative aspects of certain paintings into film. In many paintings, after all, within the confines of a single frame or by means of a cycle of paintings, a story is told and the main characters are depicted more than once. Emmer was convinced that cinema had inherited the narrative functions that painting had once exercised. By reviving those popular legends, which were so often recounted in episodic pictures, a new public interest in painting could be created.22 Not coincidentally, most of Emmer's films deal with the rich tradition of trecento and quattrocento painting, which exchanged the iconic stasis of the medieval and Byzantine tradition for an outspoken narrative character. During the 1940s in particular, Emmer aimed his camera at fourteenth- and fifteenth-century painters studied by the Italian leading art historian and critic Lionello Venturi, whom Emmer befriended after the war. Both Racconto da un affresco (1938) and Il Dramma di Cristo (1948), for instance, deal with Giotto's frescoes at the Arenachapel in Padua, while Cantico delle creature (1943) has the murals attributed to Giotto in Assisi as its subject. Guerrieri (1943) focuses on battle scenes painted by Simone Martini, Paolo Ucello and Piero della Francesca. Piero's work, particularly his fresco cycle in Arrezzo, is also the subject of L'Invenzione della croce (1948). In addition, Fratelli miracolosi (1946), La Leggenda di S. Orsola (1948) and L'Allegoria della primavera (1948) deal with works by Fra Angelico, Carpaccio and Botticelli, respectively.\n\nFigure 1.2\n\nIn most of these films, Emmer was no longer satisfied by simply showing works of art, he liked to reveal their narrative and dramatic potentials. To Emmer, reproducing a painting in its visual entirety by a simple process of camera recording constituted an ignoble use of the cinematic medium. Instead, he transposed only the thematic entirety of the original painting, subjecting it to a re-interpretation through specifically cinematic techniques. Breaking down the frescoes thematically, he analysed and culled each section for the plastic elements that would most eloquently express the strongest values of story content.23 ‘It was no longer simply a question of producing a short film with a series of photographs of a painting because there is a human content, a continuous drama which might come alive in the film,’ Emmer stated in 1945.24 Emmer and Gras therefore exploited the ‘filmic principle’ that determines a certain kind of (narrative) painting. In various films, Emmer extracted dramatic moments of a painting in order to connect them again in a cinematic way. With a sophisticated feeling for concentration, Emmer directs the eye of the spectator to these dramatically significant elements by means of rhythmic editing, pans, tilt shots and close-ups. According to Lauro Venturi, it was simply the purpose of Emmer and Gras ‘to make a short subject by using (for financial reasons) painted images instead of humans, dogs, or landscapes’.25 Impressed by the vivid expressiveness of the paintings as seen by the apparently ubiquitous eye of Emmer's camera, Francis Koval noted that ‘elaborate camera movements and dramatic editing make the figures almost three-dimensional.’26 In Racconto da un affresco, which deals with Giotto's murals in Padua, for instance, the scene of the kissing of Christ opens with a long shot of the fresco, establishing the site of action. Then Emmer cuts into the picture with a medium shot on the isolated fragment of a robed man pointing to Judas about to kiss Christ. This is followed by a close-up reaction shot of a soldier; two close-ups of bystanders in the crowd; and a close-up of Judas taken from a different fresco. Emmer subsequently cuts to a reaction close-up of Christ and part of a menacing soldier behind him. This is followed by a dramatic close-up of the kiss itself, with the eyes of the two men meeting. Finally, Emmer cuts to a still of a later fresco showing Christ's hands bound.\n\nSimilarly, the purpose of a film such as La Leggenda di S. Orsola was ‘to tell the legend of St. Ursula seen by Carpaccio, and not to make a short about Carpaccio's painting. The latter would have been an entirely different film.’27 In the first place, Emmer transforms Carpaccio's static paintings into a cinematic love story about a young princess who has agreed to marry a foreign prince and is converted to his religion. She leaves with him to his distant country, knowing that she and her escort of eleven thousand virgins will be massacred before they arrive. Rather than giving us information on the art or artist, Emmer's films narrate the legends, fables or events that the painter himself had illustrated in his paintings, by using camera movements to point out details, by using editing rhythm to impart action to the static actors, and by working very closely with the musical score (often composed by Roman Vlad) and the commentary. In so doing, most of the shots of an Emmer film focused on narrative elements in the paintings-elements that painters had used themselves in order to create a narrative such as gestures, facial expressions or the positioning of the characters. As in making a feature film, Emmer inserts shots of details from the painting with no narrative function but that help to create an atmosphere and a setting for the story. In a 1950 essay as well as in later interviews, Emmer emphasised that there was no essential difference between his films on art and his first feature film Domenica d'Agosto (1950).28 Both were marked by the same humanism that also marked contemporaneous Italian neorealist cinema. In Domenica d'Agosto, Emmer simply looked for the same faces and emotions on the beaches of Ostia as the ones that are depicted in the art of the masters of the Early Renaissance.\n\nIn a sense, by breaking down the storytelling paintings into their narrative elements, the filmic storytelling is done through the painter's own eyes. Emmer simply attempted to give to each element a ‘duration in time’ corresponding to the ‘duration in space’ given to that same element by the painter. However, Emmer quickly realised that it was impossible to respect pictorial composition and space determination because a cinematic logic required these elements to be seen in a narrative sequence. The composition of Carpaccio's painting of the dream of Saint Ursula, for instance, is such that the eye is led immediately to both the sleeping princess and the angel entering the room. In his film on La Leggenda di S. Orsola, however, Emmer first concentrated on Ursula and established her setting before revealing the presence of the angel. The angel's appearance being unsuspected, the scene gained in the film an element of suspense that is purely cinematographic and anti-pictorial. Strikingly, Emmer did not show the total of the painting before moving in for close-ups (as many art historians criticised him for not doing).29 As a result, Emmer gives the painted figures a purely cinematic movement instead of a movement derived from the surface composition of the painting. According to Lauro Venturi,\n\nfor this reason the whole picture is rarely seen in his films. The movement of the composition would destroy the cinematic movement of the details because details from different sections of the paintings are combined to express ideas or emotions which they could not separately express.30\n\nAccording to Herbert Margolis such an ‘isolation of parts from the whole purposely disturbed the equilibrium of the original paintings in order to form a new cinematic equilibrium’.31 Images, which have no meaning or balance in themselves, are combined through a shot juxtaposition creating a story continuity that rises to a dramatic climax.\n\nAlthough unmistakably based on the narrative organisation of the paintings, Emmer's films presented themselves as translations or transpositions rather than reproductions. Instead of simply showing the original paintings, Emmer revealed their hidden meanings. For Lauro Venturi, the cinematic narration of Emmer's films\n\nis so persuasive that, when we see the painting after having seen the film, we spontaneously look for those hidden details which the camera has revealed, and we are able to understand the painter's poetry and dramatic construction far better.32\n\nFurthermore, Emmer not only combines otherwise unrelated details, he sometimes even contradicts the original paintings. Two characters, for instance, who are back to back in the painting, are facing each other in the film. In other instances, Emmer mixes faces and actions from different paintings. In Giotto's depiction of the Dream of Joachim, for instance, he introduced two soldiers that are part of the Resurrection. In Giotto's fresco showing the mourning of Christ, Emmer selected five progressive phases of angles in motion from different Giotto frescoes. When viewed in rapid succession, one dissolving into another, they create the cinematic illusion of an angel in continuous flight. Referring to Il Paradiso terrestre (1946), which deals with Bosch's triptych of the Garden of Delights, Emmer stated that:\n\nthe film […] is not and must not be a cinematographic translation of the pictorial work. It would have been an absolutely pretentious and arbitrary experience to attempt to violate an autonomous artistic reality. Bosch's painting is harmony in space. The makers of the film have taken those painted images, freed them form their pictorial bonds, and used them as new objects.33\n\nEmmer's films were carefully planned, as demonstrated by the technical indications for filming that are drawn on photographic reproductions of the artworks. They were also made with very limited means. Dozens of still photographs of an artwork were filmed with an old 1913 Pathé camera on an animation stand in a way similar to the making of an animation film. For his art films, Emmer used photographs by Fratelli Alinari, the Italian photographic studio that already in the nineteenth century had established itself as the leading firm for photographic reproductions of historical monuments and artworks. Published widely, and widespread among connoisseurs all over the world, Alinari pictures played an important part in the development of the discipline of art history and they had become part of the collective memory of art lovers. Creating new connections between individual Alinari photographs, Emmer situates himself in a project hypostasising the age of mechanical reproduction, not unlike Malraux. Comprising numerous sentimental depictions of love, Destino d'amore (1942) even presents photographic reproductions as such as the subject of the film. This unique satire of a romance between a chambermaid and an Italian soldier at the Front was created through ingenious editing of the couple's picture-postcard exchanges. It was immediately banned by the Ministry of Popular Culture for being ‘a ridiculous insult to the love life of the heroic fascist soldier’.34 Massimo Ferretti sees this film as an instance of the surrealist influences on Emmer, who uses the postcard as a ready-made or an objet trouvé that acquires a new meaning in a way similar to the photographic practices of the avant-garde.35\n\nEmmer's films were widely discussed in the contemporaneous publications of the film d'art movement and they became very influential, particularly in French film circles, where Emmer had close contacts with people such as Henri Langlois, Marc Allégret, Marcel Carné and Jean Cocteau. But Emmer's films were also widely shown in many other countries. When the Arts Council of Great Britain organised its first Art Film Tour in the autumn of 1950, operating as a mobile unit, its catalogue contained a list of twelve art films, six of them by Luciano Emmer.36 John Read, who started making television documentaries on art for the BBC in the early 1950s, acknowledged Emmer's influence. Emmer's reliance on linear narrative, his focus on the individual and his preference for feeling over analysis also became crucial elements in British television's framework for the arts.37\n\nEmmer's works, however, were the target of criticism as well. The concentration on the narrative of artworks was both the strength and weakness of Emmer's films. In some of his later films such as Leonardo da Vinci (1952), Goya (1952) and Picasso (1954), Emmer even abandoned his focus on narrative and dealt with entire oeuvres that were even presented as cultural manifestations of an entire era. Some critics also reproached him for the fact that his camera took charge of the pictorial form and distorted it by its ingenuity, whereas others described the typical Emmer formula already in the early 1950s as tedious and nearing exhaustion.38 In 1955, Lotte Eisner wrote that:\n\nthe method of filmmakers with true intuition and sensibility, like Luciano Emmer and Enrico Gras-whose films on Giotto and Bosch discovered the possibilities of treating a picture like a scene in the studio without the element of the third dimension-has now become stale with imitation and abuse.39\n\nNonetheless, some of Emmer's films are characterised by a highly personal and poetic dimension. His account of the Legend of Saint Ursula, for instance, can indeed be interpreted as the simple telling of a story but it is unmistakably also marked by a surrealist fascination for terror and oneiric elements, which certainly can be found in the original Italian version but which were even more elaborated in the French version of the film that has a voice-over commentary written by Jean Cocteau.40 As Raymond Durgnat noted, in Emmer's films, ‘the camera, paradoxically, takes the works of art out of the context of art appreciation, and attempts to give back to them an interest which is not so much literary as a religious holism of eye, mind, and heart.’41 First and foremost, Emmer experimented with the narrative potential of the still image in a cinematic context. Consisting of a montage of shots of details of a painting combined with varied camera movements and a soundtrack, his films not only precede similar works by Storck or Resnais, they foreshadow experimental films such as Marker's La Jetée (1962), which is also based on a mechanism of movement or animation of the still image.\n\nCauvin, Storck, Haesaerts and the Belgian School\n\nIn the late 1940s, Henri Storck and Paul Haesaerts were carrying out similar experiments that belonged to a rich Belgian tradition of art documentaries including remarkable films by Charles Dekeukeleire and André Cauvin, among others. In one of the contemporaneous books on the phenomenon of the art film, published by UNESCO, Paul Davay stated that the Belgian cinema ‘has made relatively few blunders in the domain of the film on art’. In addition, Davay noted that Belgian filmmakers abandoned the ‘traditional sanctimonious contemplation of art and introduced their spectators into an unknown realm, obliged them to see, revealed the secrets of what they before had only looked at mechanically’.42 In Belgium, the art film had already flourished before the war. Although the genre reached back as early as the mid-twenties with films such as Gaston Schoukens's Nos Peintres (Our Painters, 1926) on artists from the Flemish Primitives to Rubens, Belgium inparticular produced some seminal and highly original art documentaries in the late 1930s. Dekeukeleire's Thèmes d'inspiration (1938) compared portraits of Old and Modern Masters with footage of real people to demonstrate ‘that throughout the ages the soul of the people had not been changed’.43 Constantly shifting between the past and the present, Thèmes d'inspiration is marked both by the avant-garde (to which Dekeukeleire had contributed earlier with film poems inspired by Germaine Dulac and a series of montage films) and by the new documentary trends of the 1930s.44 Focusing on the telluric alignment of characters in paintings by Pieter Bruegel, Joachim Patinir, Jacob Jordaens, Constant Permeke and Frits Van den Berghe, among others, Dekeukeleire's film also comprised images of the countryside and farmers at work, connecting them to the land by means of low camera positions. A highly lyrical film, Thèmes d'inspiration won the Grand Prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1938.\n\nThe most influential pre-war Belgian art film, however, was André Cauvin's L'Agneau mystique (The Mystic Lamb, 1939), which dealt with the famous fifteenth-century altarpiece by Jan and Hubert Van Eyck. In this landmark short film, the verbal narrative was confined to a minimum of fact and description in favour of the sensuality of excellently vibrant lighting and the moving camera, which brought the static painting to life. Entirely shot in the cathedral of Ghent, Cauvin's film prefigured the camera mobility that characterises many of the post-war documentaries on painting. After an establishing shot of the cathedral, the camera leads us impressively through the gates that guard the chapel in which the Van Eyck polyptych stands. Subsequently, it scans the side-panels shielding the painting, then these swing open and the camera begins to examine the central panels. From a careful overview we are led on to a closer analysis. The camera moves slowly so that there is time to contemplate the many details rendered in close-up. For the first time, an art film draws attention to the aesthetic coherence of a complex piece of art, enabling the viewer to make a formal analysis of a single work. Moreover, the spectator is invited to look for himself. ‘For the first time spectators began to see a living world in a painting,’ Paul Davay stated. ‘No one had ever before seen the city of Ghent through this window. No one had noticed that the angel musicians are little Belgian country girls with bright but rather ugly faces.’ Davay further remarked that the world that Cauvin revealed is not essentially pictorial. ‘The camera always works on a limited field, so the profound structure of the painting constantly escapes us, the play of volumes is only approximately realised, and the colour relationships hardly at all.’45 Cauvin's film is essentially a cinematic exploration of the world depicted by Van Eyck. Light, rhythm, camera movement and sound-all contribute to an all-over poetic effect. Together with a similar film on Memling (1939), The Mystic Lamb was produced by the Belgian government specifically for showing in its pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair, where it made a lasting impression. Calling it a ‘true art experience on film’, Arthur Knight described The Mystic Lamb as ‘probably the first of the new art films on an adult level to be seen by any considerable audience in America’.46 Writing in 1952, Iris Barry stated that The Mystic Lamb ‘has not even now, after so many other cinematic studies of paintings, been surpassed. […] Cauvin was truly exploring unknown country here: his calmness and clear perception made for brilliant pioneering.’47\n\nCauvin's experiments were taken a step further by Henri Storck, who specialised in the genre of the art documentary from 1936 onwards, when he realised Regards sur la Belgique ancienne (Views of Old Belgium, 1936). Dealing with the medieval treasures produced by religion or a new emerging civic culture, the film mobilises static imagery by means of forward and backward travellings as well as lateral and vertical pan shots. Storck's more important contributions to the development of the genre, however, date from the late 1940s with his landmark films on Delvaux and Rubens. In contrast with Cauvin's film on Van Eyck's Mystic Lamb and most of Emmer's films, Storck did not base his films on individual paintings but rather on a collage of details from various works. In so doing, Storck exceeded Emmer's ambitions by putting film at the disposal of an analysis of both the content and the form of the artwork. While Emmer wanted to tell stories that were also the subject of his filmed paintings, Storck rather developed film essays that were aesthetic treatises or studies in the history and theory of art.\n\nAs the title suggests, Le Monde de Paul Delvaux (The World of Paul Delvaux, 1946), which Storck made in collaboration with poet and essayist René Micha, deals with surrealist painter Delvaux's entire oeuvre rather than with his biography or a specific painting. Delvaux's famous nudes and uncanny cityscapes merge with other figures, objects and fragments from various of his canvasses, crystallising into an oneiric and melancholy universe. Accompanied by the voice of Paul Eluard and music by André Souris, Le Monde de Paul Delvaux presented itself as a modern Gesamtkunstwerk. Paul Davay called it:\n\nan almost perfect meeting and fusion of different artistic disciplines subject to a new means of expression-the cinema. Under Storck's direction, the painter Delvaux, the script-writer René Micha, the musician André Souris, and the poet Paul Eluard found a common ground.48\n\nStorck's camera gently and subtly moves over Delvaux's paintings, scrutinising as well as cherishing them. On the one hand, the filmmaker focuses our attention on the material aspects of the paintings. Arthur Knight stated that ‘more than any other art film has yet succeeded in doing, Storck creates an awareness of texture, of technique, of how the paint is laid on.’49 On the other hand, Storck manages to evoke the almost immaterial and dream-like world of Delvaux's art. In order to achieve this effect, Storck and Delvaux did away with the frames of the pictures and in some cases lined them up one next to the other so that Storck's camera could pass without interruption from one to another.50 Perfectly fit for black-and-white film, Delvaux's uncanny nudes in haunted nocturnal cityscapes show certain resemblances to films of that era such as late instances of Surrealism, like Cocteau's La Belle et la bête (1946) or Hans Richter's Dreams That Money Can Buy (1946), as well as to contemporaneous Hollywood productions, such as One Touch of Venus (William Seiter, 1948), Pandora and the Flying Dutchman (Albert Lewin, 1949) and several Gothic and noir films featuring haunting portraits.\n\nFigure 1.3\n\nWith Rubens (1948), which Storck realised in collaboration with Paul Haesaerts, cinema entered into the realm of art analysis. Rather than dealing with the narrative of a certain painting (as in many of Emmer's films) or with a fictitious world created in many works of a painter (as in Le Monde de Paul Delvaux), Rubens attempted to give both an art historical reading and a formal analysis of the work of the baroque painter. In order to analyse the style, composition and iconography of the artist, Storck called in the entire repertory of the film medium-from split screens and multiple exposures to parallel editing and animation techniques. In Rubens, Storck frequently isolates a fragment of the painting through the device of an iris. A subsequent shot shows a close-up of that fragment for a more detailed analysis. In other instances, a moving camera and rapidly rotating images reveal Rubens's predilection for spiral-shaped movements. Animated lines point out the characteristics of Rubens's compositions-his focal points, divisions and the sweep of his movements. Rubens is presented as a master of ultimate flexibility and movement by means of animated circles and ovals. Dissolves to footage of water, clouds and flames evoke Rubens's idea of both a universe in motion and a fertile nature. By means of split screens, Storck and Haesaerts compare Rubens with other masters. On the one hand, split screens make clear that Rubens sought and found other solutions to depict the world than the ones used by earlier Flemish painters such as Van der Weyden, Van der Goes, Memling, Van Eyck, Bosch or Bruegel. On the other hand, split screens are also invoked to demonstrate Rubens's affinities with other painters or his influence on later artists such as Titian, Veronese, Van Dyck, Jordaens, Delacroix, Wiertz, Watteau and Renoir. Furthermore, Storck and Haesaerts also make comparisons between similar details from a number of works by Rubens himself. A sequence, for instance, juxtaposes a series of hands painted by Rubens and investigates their significance in the construction of a narrative. In this film, in short, Storck does not evoke Rubens through a series of anecdotes but recreates his works before our eyes. According to Paul Davay, Storck and Haesaerts ‘oblige us to remain in front of the picture, to see it, with their eyes, but they give us the right to protest, to disagree, and to join in a discussion which is always open to our intelligence’.51 While Storck and Haesaerts may be using virtuoso textbook techniques, they also intrude in the stories depicted in the paintings directly by their glorious travelling shots, statically filmed details, and close-ups of characters or their features.\n\nWith Rubens, Storck clearly demonstrated that the medium of film was suitable for formal analyses of artworks. Moreover, with his large formats and compositions characterised by movements and spatial depth, Rubens is almost presented as a precursor of cinema. This aspect is even made explicit when a view of the interior of a Jesuit church with an altar painted by Rubens is almost transformed into a cinema theatre. Suddenly, the image is underexposed apart from the altar that illuminates as a cinema screen. Rubens's art, in short, is presented as a proto-cinematic spectacle-an idea that is not absurd, knowing that the proliferation of his prints was particularly important for nineteenth-century academic painting, which, in turn, is echoed in the spectacular and lavish shot compositions of Hollywood directors of the late 1910s and 1920s such as Cecil B. DeMille.\n\nRubens is appropriately described as a landmark art documentary bymany commentators.52 According to Kracauer, ‘Rubens combines cinematically brilliant camera penetrations of the painter's world with an attempt to drive home his predilection for gyrational movements. Note that this film is neither pure cinema nor merely a teaching instrument. It is a glamorous hybrid.’53 More explicit than Emmer, Storck presented the art documentary as an autonomous cinematic work. His documentaries on Delvaux and Rubens were not conceived as educational projects but as pure cinema or something in between. As such, they were often criticised by art critics and historians. Storck simply employed artworks as raw material that needed to be transformed in order to become cinematic elements. In this process, he attempted to realise effects that sometimes had little to do with the original work of art. H. W. Janson, author of a well-known and popular survey of art history, wrote that:\n\nambitious and successful films such as the Belgian-made Rubens and Le Monde de Paul Delvaux have demonstrated how effectively the moving camera canguide the beholder's eye so as to focus his attention and heighten his perceptions. There is a strange excitement about viewing paintings thus spread out upon the movie screen. A new dimension, we feel, has been added to our experience, and we find ourselves in a state of visual alertness that makes the forms speak to us with particular eloquence and intensity.54\n\nFigure 1.4\n\nFigure 1.5\n\nAfter Rubens, Storck continued making art films such as La Fenêtre ouverte (The Open Window, 1952), which can be described as a short history of landscape painting in Technicolor. Storck's collaborator on Rubens, the art historian and critic Paul Haesaerts, also realised other art documentaries in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In De Renoir à Picasso (1950), Haesaerts adopted the techniques that were used in Rubens. Split screens, diagrams and animation help us to analyse the forms and structures of paintings. In this case, these techniques are invoked to make statements about modern art in general since De Renoir à Picasso attempts at tracing three inspirational sources of modernart-the so-called sensual or carnal (Renoir), the cerebral (Seurat), and the instinctual or passionate (Picasso). Evoking what Henri Lemaître, in his 1956 book on fine arts and cinema, called film's power to make a ‘confrontation significative’ between artworks, Haesaerts juxtaposes works in order to demonstrate artistic affinities and contrasts. Decades later, the film looks deadly didactic but Haesaerts certainly still amazes us by his attempts at developing new ways of analysing artworks in cinematic ways. At the time, it made a lasting impression. According to André Thirifays, Haesaerts uses\n\na technique which is perfectly adapted to the film medium, and which, moreover, in this case, is more efficacious than the written word. By using graphs, pointing quick contrasts, or introducing music, he succeeds in giving forceful expression to his critical opinions, whilst at the same time, with a few swift touches, he indicates various influences and successive trends in the realm of art and dwells on the dramatic aspects of the works mentioned.55\n\nThe only master still living in Haesaert's genealogy of modern art De Renoir à Picasso was also the subject of another landmark documentary that the Belgian art historian-cum-filmmaker realised in 1950. Strikingly, Visite à Picasso opens with a travelling shot showing numerous books on Picasso. Inso doing, the film not only evokes Malraux's imaginary museum, it also contributes as well as refers to the veritable cult of Picasso portraits that emerged after the Second World War. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Picasso came to embody modern art as such. Both his persona and his work were discussed and reproduced extensively in both art journals and popular media, and they also became the subject of other films such as Guernica (Resnais, 1950), Picasso (Emmer, 1954) and Le Mystère Picasso (Clouzot, 1956).56 After the opening images of Picasso books, Haesaerts shows us a series of works by Picasso in chronological order. Then the film switches to images of Picasso's studio in Vallauris. The artist walks outside and enters the studio to work on a piece of sculpture and a drawing. By holding the sculpture, the artist projects its shadows on one of the studio's walls. In the remarkable following sequence, Picasso paints various forms (a bird, a vase with flowers, various zoomorphic figures) on a sheet of Plexiglass stretched between himself and the camera. Sometimes, the artist looks straight into the lens through the drawing. The effect is striking-certainly because the pane of glass occupies the entire frame or covers an entire door opening. Shown against a dark background, it looks as if Picasso draws white lines into the space in which he finds himself.\n\nFigure 1.6\n\nThe use of a glass pane in order to show the creation process itself proved very successful and it was adopted by several other landmark art documentaries of the 1950s. Haesaerts himself fell back on this procedure in his Quatre peintres belges au travail (Four Belgian Painters at Work, 1952) dealing with Edgar Tytgat, Albert Dasnoy, Jean Brusselmans and Paul Delvaux. However, the process led to better results in the American production of Jackson Pollock (Paul Falkenberg and Hans Namuth, 1951) simply because Pollock's action painting involved a more physical dimension and also implied a new relation between the painting and its creation process. In the often-quoted voice-over, Pollock himself emphasised the importance of being physically part of his paintings. Similarly, The Reality of Karel Appel (Jan Vrijman, 1962) features the artist flicking paint at a glass screen in a frenzy of apparent creativity accompanied by a Dizzy Gillespie soundtrack. The use of filming through glass sheets, in short, proved very useful for documenting painters with a heavy brush technique and an outspoken physical way of applying paint on their canvas (as in Pollock's drippings). Since their paintings present themselves as almost seismographic registrations of their bodily movements, they became favourite subjects of filmmakers who endorsed what Philip Hayward described as an ‘extreme fetishisation of the actual moment of crea-tion’.57 The most famous variation on Haesaerts's technique, however, was also used in a film dedicated to Picasso. In the feature-length film Le Mystère Picasso (The Mystery of Picasso, 1956), established French fiction film director Henri-Georges Clouzot showed Picasso at work in a film studio.58 Shot in noirish black-and-white, this footage was altered by long takes in colour of a porous white screen on which Picasso made nineteen paintings or drawings. The screen was filmed frontally from behind so that Picasso himself remains invisible. As a result, the screen is transformed into a kind of automatic painting-an effect particularly suited for Picasso's working process since as he works on a painting, he changes his mind about its central subject. The initial image of a flower becomes a fish, which in turn becomes a hen, before being transformed into a human face and finally the head of a faun. More than in Haesaerts's Visite à Picasso, Clouzot's long takes reproduce the duration of the painting process.\n\nResnais's Early Studio Visits and Artist Portraits\n\nClouzot's film on Picasso is an indication of the high level that the art film had reached in France by the mid-1950s. Besides Italy and Belgium, France contributed largely to the development of the art documentary between 1945 and 1955. Undoubtedly, the production of such films was encouraged by a decree that obliged film exhibitioners to include short features in their programmes during the late 1940s.59 After the introduction in 1955 of a new system of grants, France continued to experience an era of flourishing of short filmmaking which, together with the work of such sympathetic producers as Anatole Dauman (Argos Films) and Pierre Braunberger (Les films de la Pléïade), favoured the production of art documentaries by experimental filmmakers.\n\nA key figure in the development of the post-war French art documentary was Alain Resnais, who later became one of the major auteurs of French post-war cinema with films such as Hiroshima mon amour (1959) and L'Année dernière à Marienbad (1961). Resnais even started his career as a filmmaker with some remarkable art documentaries, which were heavily influenced by ‘Robert Hessens and the Belgian School of Paul Haesaerts’.60 Already in 1946–7, more or less during the same years in which Malraux-who later was to become Resnais's father-in-law-was working on the first versions of his Musée imaginaire, Resnais made, at the age of twenty-five, a series of film portraits of painters such as Henri Goetz, Hans Hartung, César Doméla, Lucien Coutaud, Christine Boumeester, Félix Labisse, Óscar Domínguez (unfinished) and Max Ernst. Since these films, each of them shot in 16 mm, were not meant for commercial distribution, they fell into oblivion and they are often lacking in Resnais filmographies. At the most, they can be considered as modest finger exercises. With the exception of the film on Ernst, which was shot in colour, they all are black-and-white films without synchronised sound. A soundtrack with music was later added to the Goetz film to be shown in museums and exhibitions. For the film on Hartung, a soundtrack with music by Antoine Duhamel and a voice-over commentary by Madeleine Rousseau was planned but only realised much later, when the film was saved from oblivion in 2000.\n\nThe selection of subjects in Resnais's early films is striking. In a 1960 interview, Resnais described his pictorial preferences, like his taste in other artistic disciplines, as highly eclectic. ‘I like what I call theatrical painting-Piero della Francesca, Félix Labisse, Paul Delvaux, etcetera. But then I also like Hartung. My favourite modern painter is Ernst; he satisfies me on both the theatrical and abstract levels.’61 For his first film portraits, Resnais invariably chose painters representing the various trends within the so-called école de Paris : post-cubism (Goetz), geometric abstraction (Doméla), figurationinspired by Surrealism (Labisse, Coutaud, Domínguez) and expressive, lyrical or organic abstraction (Hartung, Ernst, Boumeester). The fact that Resnais based his career as a filmmaker on a preference for modern abstract painting already prefigures his future outspoken modernist commitment-during the following decades, after all, Resnais not only became one of the protagonist of European modernist art house cinema but also collaborated with prominent modernist writers such as Cayrol, Duras, Semprun and Robbe-Grillet and composers such as Milhaud, Eisler, Fusco, Henze and Penderecki.\n\nThese at first sight rather modest films can be described as studio visits comprising images of the artist at work. Given this perspective, Resnais's early film experiments on the one hand connect to an old tradition reaching back to the origins of the genre of the art documentary. On the other hand, they foreshadow an important trend that would flourish in the following years with films already mentioned in the previous paragraph such as Haesaerts's Visite à Picasso and Quatre peintres belges au travail as well as Falkenberg and Namuth's Jackson Pollock and Clouzot's Le Mystère Picasso. In the sequences showing artists in their studio, Resnais often used a succession of shots characterised by a fixed framing, and some sequences are marked by striking camera positions.\n\nResnais's early artist films also contain a sequence consisting of a succession of static shots of various paintings, which enables the filmmaker to show the stylistic evolution of a painter's oeuvre as well as to emphasise the specific obsessions of the artist. In the film on Goetz, for instance, Resnais evokes an almost tormented and haunted atmosphere that is caused more by the montage than by the registration of individual works as such. In addition, Resnais succeeded in immersing himself and the viewer in the pictorial universe of a certain artist by means of various cinematic techniques. In particular, in the film portraits of Goetz and Hartung, Resnais extensively used the tracking shots that later would become the trademark of films such as Nuit et brouillard, Hiroshima mon amour and L'Année dernière à Marienbad. As François Thomas has noted, in the films on Goetz and Hartung, two different kinds of use of travelling shots can be found.62 In the film on Goetz, camera movements were deployed to suggest a continuity between shots showing fragments of several works considered to be the most representative of the painter. Camera movements facilitate, as it were, the selection of specific elements in these paintings and they give meaning to an entire series of works. In the film on Hartung, by contrast, camera movements guide us within a single painting. The camera follows axes in the composition and helps us to ‘read’ the painting. According to Resnais,\n\nthere is nothing like looking at a painter's work through a camera viewfinder to judge the cohesiveness of his painting as such. That was how I came to see through Gauguin, for example-he just didn't stand up-but it's also how I came to appreciate the formal values of Ernst.63\n\nIn Resnais's early film essays, static paintings are animated or brought to life by montage and camera movements. According to Resnais, these early films ‘had the intention to remove the paintings from the dusty rooms of museums’ and they were experiments\n\nto find out if painted trees, painted houses, and painted characters could, by way of montage, fulfil the roles of real objects and if, in this case, it was possible to substitute for the observer the interior world of an artist for the word that photography revealed.64\n\nLabelled as ‘important and invaluable experiments in the crucial relationship between montage and mise-en-scène’, these early artist portraits present themselves as autonomous artworks, which translate rather than merely register the formal language and universe of the painter in question.65\n\nVan Gogh\n\nThis aspect is even more crucial in Resnais's art documentaries made during the following years, which were made for commercial distribution in contrast with the early studio films. In films such as Van Gogh (1948), Guernica (1950), Gauguin (1950) and Les Statues meurent aussi (with Chris Marker, 1953), a shiftin the selection of the art and artists can be noted.66 Whereas the early film portraits were dedicated to artists who had come to the fore in the 1930s and 1940s and who, as a whole, embodied the most important currents in post-war European painting, Resnais now harked back to prominent artists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and African art. Nonetheless, this preference for artists and art forms that, a few years earlier under the Nazi occupation were considered still entartet or degenerated, indicates Resnais's modernist commitment.\n\nThe rediscovery of Vincent Van Gogh perfectly tallies with the artistic and intellectual climate shortly after the liberation. Both the art and the figure of Van Gogh seemed perfectly reconcilable with the then leading existentialist art discourse-the shoes of Van Gogh, which turn up a few times in Resnais's film, were at the core, for instance, of Heidegger's famous essay on the Ursprung des Kunstwerkes. During his military service in Germany in 1945–6, Resnais had visited Heidegger.67 On the occasion of the big Van Gogh exhibition at the Orangerie in Paris in 1947, several books were published, some containing fragments of the correspondence between Vincent and his brother Theo, which was also used in Resnais's short feature.68Van Gogh was originally shot in 1947, commissioned by the Amis de l'Art, a circle founded at the end of 1944 with the purpose of stimulating the proliferation of modern art by means of lectures and didactic exhibitions as well as films. This society was presided over by the renowned art historian Gaston Diehl, who also founded the Festival international du film d'art in 1948 and rendered his assistance as a screenwriter to films such as Les Fêtes galantes (Watteau) (1950) by Jean Aurel. Diehl spoke to Resnais about the Van Gogh exhibition and asked the young filmmaker if he was interested in making a film ‘in the style of Luciano Emmer’ for the Amis de l'art.69 Diehl also wrote the commentary for Van Gogh and also for Resnais's film on Gauguin. Also involved in the projectwas Robert Hessens, who developed into a maker of art documentaries as well as films on Malfray (1948), Toulouse-Lautrec (1950) and Chagall (1953).70 Resnais would also collaborate with Hessens on his film on Guernica and both were also involved in the production of Pictura (1951), in which famous actors such as Henry Fonda, Gregory Peck and Vincent Price spoke the voice-over in episodes dedicated to Bosch, Goya, Carpaccio and Toulouse-Lautrec.71\n\nInitially, Van Gogh was shot in 16 mm. Moreover, the budget was originally inadequate to provide for the soundtrack, comprising Diehl's text read by Claude Dauphin and music by Jacques Besse. Resnais, however, showed the unfinished film to producer Pierre Braunberger.72 Impressed by it, Braunberger, who was the driving force behind Panthéon Production (later Les films de la Pléïade), gave Resnais the assignment as well as the financial means to reshoot the film in 35 mm with sound. Eventually, the new version of Van Gogh, which was made on the basis of photographic reproductions instead of the original paintings used in the 16 mm version, premiered in May 1948.73 That year, it won the Grand Prize at the Venice Film Festival and the CIDALC Award. In 1950, the film won an Oscar for best documentary short. It is striking that Resnais's twenty-minute film was conceived and eventually also shot in black-and-white, whereas Van Gogh is usually considered as a great colourist. The film, however, should be situated in a context in which the vast majority of art reproductions were in black-and-white. Moreover, Resnais succeeded in turning this restriction into an advantage. The use of black-and-white makes the graphic and even graphological element in Van Gogh's works more visible-the painting is presented as an embodiment of a highly personal signature. Furthermore, the use of black-and-white film enabled Resnais to create, in his own words, links between completely different works as well as to focus more on the ‘architecture tragique de la peinture de Van Gogh’.74\n\nThe tragic nature of Van Gogh is indeed the crucial topic of the film. Already before the opening credits, we are assured that Van Gogh, in spite of his universally recognised talent, struggled desperately against misery and indifference. Van Gogh is not so much a visual essay analysing the content or pictorial system of a certain painter-as is the case in some of the films by Emmer. Resnais, in the first place, tells the story of the life of the artist. The opening image stipulates that ‘ce film tente de retracer, uniquement à l'aide de ses oeuvres, la vie et l'aventure spirituelle de l'un des plus grands peintres modernes.’ This life and spiritual adventure are unmistakably tragic. Already in the 1940s, among the public at large, Van Gogh was the ultimate embodiment of the misunderstood artist-an aspect fully developed in Lust for Life, the popular novel published by Irving Stone in 1934 that became the basis for the 1956 film directed by Minnelli. As will be demonstrated in the next chapter, both Stone and Minnelli as well as later filmmakers presented Van Gogh as an unrecognised loner, who was almost biologically determined to deviant behaviour. Lust for Life is completely built on Van Gogh's desperate and futile attempts to become a respectable artist. The fact that he remains a failure in the eyes of the community breaks his vulnerable and self-destructive personality. As Griselda Pollock has demonstrated in several of her writings, Van Gogh is the perfect embodiment of the romantic myth of the artist as an unrecognised, vulnerable, tormented, self-destructive and tragic individual.75\n\nIt is precisely this myth that Resnais used as a point of departure for his film essay. ‘We voluntary sacrificed the historical accuracy for the benefit of the myth of Van Gogh,’ Resnais stated.76 Van Gogh is immediately presented as a restless soul who is at home nowhere by means of a quote from the correspondence with his brother Theo: ‘It seems that I am always a traveller who always goes somewhere at some destination.’ It is this restless geographic as well as artistic and mental journey that determines the structure of the film. Van Gogh, after all, can be divided into four sequences coinciding with the four places that played an important part in the painter's life and that represent the four stages of his artistic development: Holland, Paris, Provence and Auvers-sur-Oise. Strikingly, Resnais tells the story of Van Gogh's life, which remains part of a familiar discourse on the mental and social alienation of the artist, exclusively by means of a cinematic manipulation of his paintings. On the whole, the film consists of a masterful succession of 207 shots of paintings, which suggest a continuity that is comparable with a feature film. Just like a filmmaker constructs a scene with shots and an entire film with scenes, Resnais composed Van Gogh by means of images of static paintings that are animated in a certain way. In order to tell the story of the painter's life, Resnais rearranged dozens of paintings into a kind of storyboard or comic strip-later in his career, Resnais touched on the relation between film and comics more than once and, for his art documentaries, he recognised his debt to Emmer on the one hand, and to Dick Tracey on the other.77 In order to construct a link between the individual images, Resnais appealed to all kinds of montage devices. He used several speeds and forms of transitions (from straight cuts to slow overlap dissolves) between the individual images. In addition, static images were brought to life by means of several camera movements-from right to left, from bottom to top, and from forward to backward (optical) tracks. In Van Gogh, Resnais used an entire repertory of camera movements, which he had tested earlier, in the films on Goetz and Hartung for instance, in a more isolated context. Furthermore, rather than juxtaposing shots of paintings, Resnais confronted parts of paintings to one another. Consequently, Resnais destroyed the integrity of the individual artwork in two ways: by focusing on isolated details on the one hand, and by jumping through an entire oeuvre on the other. In Resnais's film, Van Gogh's complete oeuvre is seen as a single vast painting.\n\nFigure 1.7\n\nFigure 1.8\n\nResnais not only employed these cinematic devices to enable us to get acquainted with Van Gogh's work in a ‘smooth’ way. In no way is his film like a kind of art history slide show adorned by various image transitions. In the first place, Resnais used cinematic devices to construct a drama. Given this perspective, his film is more in line with the biopics by Minnelli and other filmmakers than with most of the many art documentaries that were later dedicated to the painter. Resnais only told his stories without actors and locations but only by means of paintings and their details. ‘What interested me in Van Gogh was the possibility to treat a painting as if it was a real space with real characters,’ Resnais stated.78\n\nThe film's first images can simply be interpreted as a conventional establishing sequence. A series of overlap dissolves of the Dutch landscape take us to a certain location in a conventional way: a panoramic landscape is followed by sights of country roads bordered by trees, which in their turn are succeeded by the exterior and eventually interior of a house. From the very first, it is clear that Resnais employs paintings as components of a classical découpage, which constructs a narrative and even dramatic relation between the images. When the voice-over tells us that other horizons are calling and that Van Gogh leaves Holland on a November evening, we get to see a painting of a landscape including a dorsal figure that we interpret as Van Gogh himself. ‘Van Gogh, solitaire, s'engage vers son destin.’ A dissolve to black is followed by an iris on a painting representing Paris-‘Paris l'acceuille. Un Paris immense, peuplé d'espoir et de promesses …’-and, subsequently, by a conventional montage sequence of the French capital. Unmistakably, Resnais's camera work draws our attention to all kinds of plastic details but also results in the construction of a plot, which violates the original works of art. The camera, for instance, approaches a door of a building in a painting and suddenly enters its interior by means of another painting-an almost magical effect used by Resnais at several instances in the film. Paintings are thus linked in a way a director would use real locations. A forward track to the window in the painting of La Maison jaune is for instance followed by a backward tracking shot, which starts from a window and gradually reveals the entire interior of La Chambre à coucher de l'artiste à Arles. This cinematic logic can also be found inthe sequence in which an old Dutch farmer's wife enters a house and Resnais even creates the equivalent of a reverse shot.\n\nSupported by the ‘special effects’ of Henry Ferrand, Resnais also created more dramatic moments. A super-fast succession of backward tracks of trees, the flashing shift of landscapes, the restless use of the out-of-focus, the reframing of a painting or the agitated alternation between sunflowers and close-ups of eyes in self-portraits evoke both the insanity and the nervous brush strokes and loud colour contrasts of the painter. In this perspective, Resnais combines the innovations of both Emmer and Storck. Like Emmer, Resnais constructs a story by means of several details of paintings. Simultaneously, however, like in Storck's films, a mobile camera and an eye-catching montage reveal the essence of the formal language of the artist. The emphatic effects also indicate that Resnais did not have the ambition to tell only Van Gogh's biography by means of his paintings. At the most, the film deals with a kind of imaginary life of the artist. The story is rather told from within the painter's mind and the world is seen through the eyes of Van Gogh. This interest in the construction of narrative links between images of an internal and mental world is also at the basis of Resnais's feature films, such as Hiroshima mon amour, L'Année dernière à Marienbad or Providence, in which both characters and the spectator are immersed in the labyrinth of memory by means of shock-like successions and seamless transitions of images.\n\nGauguin\n\nAfter the success of Van Gogh, Resnais also dedicated an eleven-minute film to the painter's mate Gauguin (1950). For this purpose, Resnais collaborated again with Diehl (but without Hessens). The voice-over, again based on the artist's writings, was spoken by Jean Servais. Henry Ferrand again took care of the ‘special effects’ and this time the music was composed by Darius Milhaud. With Gauguin, Resnais once more told the story of a tormented and alienated artist by means of a montage of details of paintings. Even the structure and the important narrative elements of Gauguin remind one of the film about Van Gogh that Resnais created two years earlier. Again, the film deals with an artist who breaks with his environment and family to start a journey (with Paris as first stop-over) to discover himself. Again, the artist retires from society and this time he ends up in the timeless peace and quiet of the Breton countryside and eventually in the paradisiacal environment of Tahiti. To Gauguin, the Polynesian landscape is an almost magical world embodying a strange combination of voluptuousness and fear. Gauguin, too, therefore, answers perfectly to the mythic image of the artist as a self-destructive eccentric-not coincidentally, as will be noted in the next chapter, Gauguin was the model for one of the first Hollywood biopics dedicated to a modern visual artist: The Moon and Sixpence (Albert Lewin, 1942), based on a novel by Somerset Maugham.79\n\nSelf-portraits of the painter were used in Van Gogh as well but in Gauguin they receive more attention. By means of dissolves, Resnais shows us the slow changes in the artist's face. A vague self-assuredness makes room for tormented pride and eventually mistrust and agony. Even the cinematic form shows unmistakable resemblances to the film on Van Gogh. The camera movements, according to Henri Agel, characterised by ‘a sobriety that is always efficient and sometimes poetic’, already herald feature films such as Hiroshima mon amour and L'Année dernière à Marienbad with which Resnais developed into a master of the mobile camera.80 For the succession of the 117 shots of paintings or some of their details, Resnais again used a whole spectrum of image transitions. The beginning of the film, for instance, shows a little inspired series of wipes between a succession of paintings. At other moments, Resnais uses editing effects more emphatically. By means of an overlap dissolve, the painter's self-portrait in the painting Bonjour Mr. Gauguin (1889) is introduced in the landscape of another painting. As in Van Gogh, at the end of the film we find a swirling montage comprising people, animals and plants. The hectic rhythm has to evoke both the insanity and the death of the artist. The perception of the world is disturbed but, at the same time, the subject is immersed in it. On the one hand, the rhythmic editing evokes the exaltation of sensuous forms and, on the other hand, the ways in which the lonely individual loses himself in it. At the abrupt end of the film, after the paradisiacal images of the Pacific, Resnais suddenly shows us a painting of a snowy European landscape. Gauguin dies with the memory of the ‘distant shores of France and a Breton village in the snow’-an effect that is highly relevant for the artistic development of Resnais, who investigated the functioning of memory in relation to cinematic time and the (film) image in his following documentaries, such as Nuit et brouillard and Toute la Mémoire du monde, as well as in most of his feature films.\n\nProbably precisely because of the strong resemblances to Van Gogh, the film was rather poorly received by both the public and critics. Resnais himself later dissociated himself from this film. ‘To be of interest to me, a film must have an experimental aspect-and this was precisely what Gauguin was lacking and because of that it is a bad film.’81 Several critics noted that the subject was much less suited to black-and-white than Van Gogh, who always remained a draughtsman, whereas Gauguin manifested himself as a colourist in the first place. ‘Shooting Gauguin in black-and-white was a terrible thing,’ Resnais admitted, ‘and it contributed largely to its failure because I could conceive this film only in colour and I shot it in black-and-white only for economical reasons.’82\n\nGuernica\n\nThe restrictions of black-and-white were less problematic in Guernica (1950), which Resnais made in collaboration with Robert Hessens in the same year as Gauguin.83 This is not only the case because Picasso's painting with the same name is more or less monochromatic-after all, the twelve-minute film also comprises images of many other Picasso paintings and it deals with the subject of the painting rather than with the painting itself. In the first place, the film evokes the destruction of the Basque town of Guernica by German bombers in April 1937. As is generally known, this horrific event from the Spanish civil war inspired Picasso to create the famous painting that was put on display in the Spanish pavilion at the World Fair in Paris later that year. After the fall of the Spanish Republic and Franco's victory, Picasso entrusted the painting to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. During and immediately after the Second World War, it was exhibited in various American and European cities, turning into a universal anti-war symbol. In the middle of the Cold War, these associations were taken up by Resnais, who also dealt with the traumas of war in Nuit et brouillard and Hiroshima mon amour. Moreover, Guernica is a passionate meditation not only on the barbarism of war and human hope and resilience, but also on the struggle against fascism, which had to be continued after the Second World War in Spain; in La Guerre est finie (1966), Resnais also dealt with this theme.\n\nAfter the films on Van Gogh and Gauguin, who are at the basis of the myth of the modern artist as an alienated and tormented individual, Resnais focused his attention on the figure of Picasso, whose work, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, was a favourite subject in the early 1950s in art films by Haesaerts, Emmer and Clouzot among others. Guernica, too, elicited the attention of several documentary filmmakers: Danish filmmaker Helge Ernst made a six-minute film on the painting in 1949 and even Robert Flaherty had similar plans in 1948.84 As in Van Gogh and Gauguin, Resnais used countless details from the oeuvre of a single artist-in this case from the period 1902–49-in order to tell a story or to construct a drama. In contrast with his two previous documentaries, this time Resnais did not tell the story of the artist's life but commented on a historical event that was the subject of a single specific work. Consequently, in Guernica, the commentary was not based on autobiographical writings but on a lyrical poem by Paul Eluard, which is recited off-screen by Jacques Pruvost and María Casarès.85 The film even opens with a still of the ravaged city and by means of an overlap dissolve, Resnais suggests that some figures are emerging from the ruins. The figures are the characters from the painting La Famille de saltimbanques (1905), who are followed by more images of the vulnerable and melancholy figures of Picasso's pre-cubist paintings.\n\nIn a second series of images, Resnais deals more with the bombing itself. A montage sequence of 1937 newspaper headlines is followed by a series of special effects (again executed by Henry Ferrand) suggesting a devastating rain of bullets hitting wall drawings and various Picasso paintings. Supported by the mesmerising voice-over, Guy Bernard's inflammatory music and diverse sound effects, this part of the film is characterised by hectic editing and nervous camera movements that are much more agitated than comparable passages in Van Gogh and Gauguin. The famous painting from the title only appears after about seven minutes, in the third part of the film. It is introduced by a close-up of the lamp, which is situated in the middle of the top of the composition. Resnais links the image of this lamp to flashing light effects letting several figures emerge from darkness. In a rapid montage, stirred up by the rhythm of the music, the distorted bodies of humans and animals from the painting and from other post-cubist works by Picasso are presented as victims of the bombing. In the film's closing scene, which opens with total darkness, the camera slides over sombre Picasso sculptures. The lighting is dramatic and by means of a noirish effect, Resnais uses the restrictions of black-and-white film to advantage. By partially obscuring or closing the image, hectic editing of fragmented image layers and restless tracks scanning pictorial surfaces, Resnais created, as it were, a cinematic equivalent of cubism. Picasso's painting, which according to Rudolph Arnheim is characterised by a principle of montage and can be considered ‘cinematic’ in various ways, was resolutely transformed into an autonomous film consisting of 178 shots.86\n\nPainting in Film\n\nIn Guernica, this autonomy vis-à-vis the original artworks is much stronger than in Van Gogh and Gauguin. More than in the previous films, images are disconnected from their original context and charged with completely new meanings. By means of techniques reminiscent of Soviet montage, the original artwork is fragmented and even politicised-given this perspective, Guernica is an exercise in active and self-conscious art reception perfectly tallying with Benjamin's film aesthetics. This autonomisation in relation to the original artwork was an important subject for debate among the critical reflections on the art documentaries by Resnais, Emmer, Storck and Haesaerts. The autonomisation also makes clear that these filmmakers refused to make a clear-cut distinction between the film on art on the one hand and the art film on the other. Writing in a 1950 issue of Sight and Sound, Jean Queval explicitly denied the need for rigid delineations of type, arguing that at ‘present, there is little to be gained from introducing rigid categories into a genre that is still searching for principles’.87 Paradoxically, Siegfried Kracauer situated the autonomy of the new experimental art documentaries in an art historical tradition. Referring to the use of pieces of antique architecture in Piranesi's engravings or the presence of French and Italian fountain sculptures in Watteau's fêtes champêtres, Kracauer stated that objections against these art films usually fail ‘to take into account the fact that within the traditional arts themselves, transfers of works of art from their own medium to another are fairly frequent and are considered quite legitimate’.88 According to Beatrice Farwell, however, art documentaries are confronted by a dilemma by definition. ‘The more a film on art succeeds as a film, the less likely it is to increase one's understanding of painting.’89 Alluding to the film by Storck and Haesaerts, Farwell deals with the example of the art of Rubens, which, at first sight, seems like a natural for film treatment because his art is full of movement. The point, however, is that Rubens was capable of creating this movement in a static medium. When a painting is set into motion by means of cinematic devices, the illusion Rubens skilfully created is lost. A new filmic illusion is constructed, which, according to Farwell, falsifies Rubens's art and which can even lead to a misinterpretation of the art of painting in general.\n\nIn addition, the medium of film was often denounced by art historians because films did not show the entire work in a single shot or at a single glance-at the third FIFA conference in Amsterdam in 1950, an art critic even argued for the obligation for filmmakers to show the artwork entirely and in colour at the beginning of their films.90 Such demands, of course, completely ignored the essence of the film medium, which exceeds or at least questions the dichotomy based on Lessing between spatial and temporal arts. The complexity of film as both a spatial and temporal discipline is brought up by the art film. This is already clear from the Emmer films in which various stages of a narrative painting (such as The Legend of Saint Ursula by Carpaccio), which are seen simultaneously by the beholder of the original artwork and which are part of a single pictorial composition, are unfolded in time by means of camera movements and editing techniques.\n\nHowever, on a more fundamental level, the maker of an art film faces other problems. Even when a shot attempts to record a painting entirely, the artwork as a Gestalt is lost by definition because, almost always, the proportion of the painting does not completely coincide with the aspect ratio of the film camera and film screen. The filmmaker, consequently, has to crop the image or his frame comprises a part of the world that falls outside the painting. Strikingly, in the most interesting art films, filmmakers deal in a highly conscious way with their framings and create new visual balances and tensions within them. In the films by Emmer, Storck and Resnais, this even becomes a conditio sine qua non. In this perspective, one should also notice that not only the vast majority of art documentaries but also the most interesting and innovating ones have painting as their subject, whereas the film medium seems more appropriate for the registration of sculpture and architecture, which imply a mobilised beholder. Resnais, too, almost completely concentrated on painting-only in the end sequence of Guernica sculptures appear in his oeuvre for the very first time, visualised emphatically plastically by means of a gliding camera and chiaroscuro lighting. His series of pictorial explorations concluded in 1955 with Les Statues meurent aussi (with Chris Marker), his only film dedicated to sculpture dealing with completely different topics (such as the decay of African art as a result of colonisation).\n\nThis pronounced focus on painting cannot entirely be explained by referring to the prominent position the medium of painting has occupied since the Renaissance. It is precisely the confrontation between the frame of the painting and that of the camera as well as the interference of two kinds of two-dimensionality that turn the film of a painting into an interesting artistic challenge. Exactly at the moment when the avant-garde emphasises the integrity of the pictorial surface (for example, the insistence on flatness throughout Clement Greenberg's writings of the 1940s and 1950s), filmmakers play on the ambivalence of the film image, which, according to Arnheim, presents each object ‘in two entirely different frames of reference, namely the two-dimensional and three-dimensional’.91 By focusing on painting, Emmer, Storck and Resnais presented the genre of the art documentary as a means to investigate the boundaries of film by juxtaposing movement versus stasis, narrative versus iconic images, and cinematic space versus pictorial surface.\n\nThe juxtaposition between two frames also determines the scope of one of the major essays André Bazin dedicated to the relation between painting and cinema.92 According to Bazin, the fixed frame of painting enclosed a world that entirely exists by and for itself; it draws the attention in a centripetal way to a static composition. The frame of the film camera, by contrast, is mobile and implies a centrifugal space extending beyond the frame into the smallest and most remote corners of everyday life. When we show a part of a painting on a film screen, the space of the painting loses its orientation and it is presented as something borderless and hence as something that extends beyond the frame. Apart from the (educational or democratising) fact that cinema is capable of bringing a painting closer to a wider audience, film presents a painting as part of the world. According to Bazin, Resnais precisely succeeded in introducing this centrifugal space of film into the centripetal space of painting. By switching between paintings and by letting the camera glide over surfaces the limits of which remain invisible, Resnais breaks through the spatial restraints of painting. According to Bazin, Resnais's art documentaries are therefore hybrid or symbiotic works. On the one hand, they cannot simply be considered as documentary registrations of another art form because the material provided by the other medium is transformed. On the other hand, they are not autonomous films since they remain dependent on other arts.\n\nIt is striking that Bazin, who usually dismissed a montage aesthetics in favour of mise-en-scène, long take and deep focus, expressed himself favourably on the art documentaries by Resnais. It is clear that, for Bazin and Resnais, paintings are intriguing and obstinate themes and motifs which lend themselves only with great difficulty to a Bazinian realism celebrating the indeterminism of everyday reality. Confronted with two-dimensional, flat entities that create their own spatial illusions, both a deep focus technique and a notion such as mise-en-scène become quite meaningless. As spatial and static objects suggesting a kind of immobility and timelessness, paintings become attractive topics for the film medium, which precisely in that era exchanges, in Gilles Deleuze's terminology, the paradigm of the movement-image for that of the time-image. Contributing importantly to the development of modernist cinema that presents duration rather than movement as its essence, Resnais as well as Emmer, Storck and Haesaerts experimented with new relations between stasis and movement. In an era of increasing camera mobility in both American and European cinema, these filmmakers embarked on a private cinematic project aimed at animating static images. Resnais would later transform the tension between stasis and movement, which he explores in Van Gogh, Gauguin and Guernica, into the use of tableaux vivants and ingenious manipulations with time in L'Année dernière à Marienbad -a film that screenwriter Alain Robbe-Grillet described as a ‘documentary of a statue’.93\n\nThe revolutionary experiments with camera movements, montage and animation in the art documentaries by Emmer, Storck, Resnais and others in the late 1940s and early 1950s soon turned into conventions of the genre. In recent decades, interesting and innovative documentary films on painting such as Une Visite au Louvre (2004) by Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet precisely ignored these conventions in an emphatic way. Moreover, the techniques to bring static images to life by means of camera movements, montage and music, which were self-consciously developed within the film d'art movement, were also extensively used in contemporaneous feature films. Several noir films and gothic melodramas of the late 1940s and early 1950s, for instance, contain scenes in which a ‘haunted portrait’ plays an important role. With the help of comparable montage effects, pans, tilts, and forward and backward tracking shots, the painted portrait marks the presence of an important absentee. In films such as Rebecca (Alfred Hitchcock, 1940), Laura (Otto Preminger, 1944), The Picture of Dorian Gray (Albert Lewin, 1945), Scarlet Street (Fritz Lang, 1945), Portrait of Jennie (William Dieterle, 1948) and many others, a painted portrait functions as a memento mori of a deceased person, invoking a restless sense of fate. Through camera positions, camera movements, and editing, a close relationship between the portrayed person and the characters looking at the portrait is established. Often, the illusion is thereby created that the portrait reflects the gaze of the characters and the spectator. A similar situation can be found in scenes situated in a museum, which will be further discussed in one of the following chapters.\n\nNotes"
