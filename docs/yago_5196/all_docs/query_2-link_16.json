        "text": "The family film Sagan om Karl-Bertil Jonssons julafton (Christopher’s Christmas Mission) based on a story by Tage Danielsson, is due to start filming in the fall 2020 for SF Studios.\n\nAfter Fredrik Backman’s best-selling novel A Man Called Ove, Swedish director Hannes Holm will bring to the screens another heart-warming story based on a popular IP. Sagan om Karl-Bertil Jonssons julafton has been a Swedish family favourite since 1975, when Swedish pubcaster SVT first broadcast Per Åhlin’s animated short film of the same name, written by Tage Danielsson, from his 1964 book ‘Stories for Children over the age of 18’.\n\nThe screen adaptation is written by Tre Vänner’s founders Tomas Tivemark, Michael Hjorth and Johan Kindblom. The central character Karl-Bertil (14) is the son of Tyko Johnson, director of a department store. His life is already mapped out, as his father’s natural successor. But the idealistic Karl-Bertil has different ambitions as his hero is Robin Hood.\n\n“Some fairy tales deserve to be turned into reality, and this is the case with Sagan om Karl-Bertil Jonssons julafton,” said the director whose ambition is to create a family film for all ages.\n\nAnnika Sucksdorff, SF Studios’ Head of Film Production Sweden added: “It has been an exciting process to put together this project. From the initial conversations with Tage Danielsson's family to the moment when we shook hands with Hannes Holm, and decided it was time to follow up on the collaboration that SF Studios initiated with him on A Man Called Ove. “\n\nSucksdorff goes on: “This movie is not just a beloved classic, which is now getting a new life. It is also an important reminder of the individual's responsibility for the common good. Karl-Bertil is such a role model and hopefully with this film we will inspire many more people to be courageous and kind.”\n\nSagan om Karl-Bertil Jonssons julafton is produced by SF Studios in co-production with SVT and Film i Väst. The theatrical release is set for Christmas 2021."
