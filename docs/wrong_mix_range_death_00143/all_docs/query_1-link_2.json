        "text": "Douglas Adams (born March 11, 1952, Cambridge, Eng.—died May 11, 2001, Santa Barbara, Calif., U.S.) was a British comic writer whose works satirize contemporary life through a luckless protagonist who deals ineptly with societal forces beyond his control. Adams is best known for the mock science-fiction series known collectively as The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nAdams received an M.A. (1974) in English literature from the University of Cambridge, where he wrote comedy sketches for the performing arts society. He was a writer and script editor for the television series Doctor Who and wrote scripts for the British Broadcasting Corporation from 1978 to 1980.\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide series is an epic parody that lampoons modern society with biting humour and pessimism. The work achieved great popularity, first as a 12-part series on radio in 1978–80 and then in a 5-book series that sold more than 14 million copies internationally. The books in the series are The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (1979), The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980), Life, the Universe and Everything (1982), So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish (1985), and Mostly Harmless (1992). The Hitchhiker’s Guide was adapted for television, theatre, and film and was used as the basis of an interactive computer program."
