        "text": "Youngsville – A Funeral service will be held at 11:00 am, Friday, December 29, 2023, at First Baptist Church, in Youngsville, for Douglas Reese Adams, 59, who passed away on December 21, 2023, in St. Martinville, as a result of an automobile accident. Interment will be at a later date.\n\nBrother Chris Fuselier will officiate.\n\nVisitation will be at the First Baptist Church, 623 Lafayette Street, in Youngsville, on Friday, from 9:00 am until 11:00 am.\n\nDouglas was born on July 28, 1964, and raised in Lanham, Maryland. He moved to Louisiana in 1997, and he became a resident of New Iberia in 2019. Douglas’s enlistment in the Army inspired him to pursue a career as an electrical engineer, so he acquired his bachelor’s degree in physics and his master’s degree from West Virginia University, and subsequently earned his Professional Engineering license. He went on to work for Halliburton for 5 years, and then worked as an electrical engineer with CLECO for 23 years. With deep expertise in his field, he served as a high school Robotics Mentor for Team 3616. Douglas's dedication and commitment to sharing his knowledge with others inspired countless young minds to explore the world of robotics and STEM. His guidance and mentorship will continue to shape the future of this field for years to come.\n\nWhile Douglas excelled professionally, it was his role as a loving family man that truly defined him. He prioritized spending time with his loved ones and brought laughter and joy into their lives with his great sense of humor. He cherished every moment shared with his family and always went the extra mile to ensure their happiness. He was always there for family events and was someone that could be counted on. The sparkle in his eyes when surrounded by his loved ones revealed the depth of love he held for them.\n\nIn addition to being a devoted family man, Douglas's faith played an integral role in shaping his character. He was a devout Christian Believer who actively participated in the First Baptist Church of Youngsville. Within the church community, he was particularly involved in their Men's Group, where he found fellowship and shared spiritual insights with fellow believers. Douglas's unwavering faith provided him with strength and comfort during times of adversity.\n\nDouglas also had a strong commitment to serving others beyond the walls of the church. His military career spanned 23 years as a Retired Sergeant First Class in the U.S. Army, where he proudly served his country. During his time in the military, he was stationed in South Korea in 1983-1985 with the 213th Combat Aviation Company. He was also deployed during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2007, demonstrating his dedication to protecting freedom and democracy. Following his retirement from the Army, Douglas remained connected to the veteran community as a member of the New Iberia VFW.\n\nOutside of work and service, Douglas found peace in nature. He loved fishing and camping, relishing the opportunity to be outdoors and connect with the serenity of nature. Whether casting a line into Lake Henderson or spending time around the campfire, these moments were not only relaxing, but also of great fun for him.\n\nDouglas's love for knowledge led him to develop an affinity for history. He immersed himself in learning about the past, finding fascination in various historical events and figures. His thirst for knowledge extended beyond books as he actively sought to visit battlefields and museums during family vacations.\n\nThose who had the privilege of knowing Douglas will forever remember his warm smile, genuine kindness, and infectious laughter. As we mourn his untimely departure from this world, let us also celebrate the indelible mark he has left on our lives. We are comforted in knowing that he rests with the Lord, and his endearing legacy will live on for generations.\n\nDouglas Reese Adams will be dearly missed by his children, Jonathan Edward Louk (Lani), Douglas Reese Adams, II (Sandra), Charlotte Jean-Louise Adams (fiance’ Cameron), and Ruth Marguerite Adams; father, Worley Jack Adams; grandchildren, Carter and Liberty Louk; and his siblings, Kenneth Worley Adams (Winnie), and Debra Lyn Adams-Fish.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his mother, E. Charlotte Adams and his ex-wife of 19 years, Sharon Adams.\n\nAs we bid farewell to this remarkable individual who lived life with both purpose and passion, let us find comfort in knowing that the memory of Douglas Reese Adams will never be forgotten. May he rest in eternal peace, forever remembered, and immensely loved."
