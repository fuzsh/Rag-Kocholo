        "text": "The final instalment of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy series has been salvaged from Douglas Adams's computer, and is to be published next year on the first anniversary of his death.\n\nAdams was working on A Salmon of Doubt, the sixth episode of the Hitchhiker series, when he died from a heart attack last May at the age of 49. The files were found by his widow, Jane Belson, and his personal assistant, Sophie Astin. Adams's agent Ed Victor told the Daily Telegraph: \"We have pored over Douglas's hard drive. There were so many different versions of the novel. He would take it and then revise it repeatedly so there were many files.\n\n\"As soon as he wrote anything he would say, 'Oh, God that's terrible.' He was a very, very self-critical author and so had a lot of trouble writing. He was a perfectionist.\"\n\nThe novel will be published as part of a collection alongside some of Adams's later writing, including magazine articles, features from his website and the screenplay for the long-awaited Hitchhiker film. The novel itself will remain unfinished.\n\nAdams became a household name when The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was published in 1979. It went straight to number one and has since sold more than 14m copies worldwide. Adams went on to write four more instalments as well as a number of detective books based around Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency.\n\nAdams is believed to have suffered from writer's block for the last 11 years of his life. He had moved to California and made a living giving lectures and writing sleeve notes for classical CDs.\n\nMr Victor said the book would be \"a last will and testament of Adams in his writing\"."
