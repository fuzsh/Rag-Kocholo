Although best known as author of The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy “trilogy” of five books, in which much of the action happens several hyperspace jumps from the debris of the earth, his work is peppered with London locations, and the city was his home for decades. From Shepherds Bush to Highgate, we tour streets that Adams knew and cared about, unhappily noting the rampant development of Islington – “Grim concrete monoliths, eyeing the new spaces in Upper Street where they hoped to spawn their horrid progeny” – and the timeless joy of Hyde Park – “Hyde Park is stunning. Everything about it is stunning except for the rubbish on Monday mornings.”Also available: a set of six beermats from hostelries featured in Adams' books: Miliways, Horse and Groom, Big Bang Burger Bar, Old Pink Dog Bar, Domain of The King Bar & Grill, Stavro Mueller’s Beta. Folder contains: Map (400 x 690mm), two postcards (100 x138mm)Litho-printed in the UK on sustainably sourced paper. Prints are sent separately to other items in our shop.Free tracked shipping is included in the price.",
