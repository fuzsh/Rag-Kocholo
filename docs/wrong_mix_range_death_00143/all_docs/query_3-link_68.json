        "text": "We invite you to celebrate the unique talent of Douglas Adams. Join us (and many other Douglas fans!) to commemorate the 42nd anniversary of his book, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nDouglas was a founder patron of our charity. He once joined us for a climb up Mount Kilimanjaro in a rhino costume and even writes about it in The Salmon of Doubt.\n\nAfter Douglas’ death in 2001, his family began working with Save the Rhino to set up the Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture; an event with a number of speakers, each focusing on a topic that Douglas was interest in, such as science, exploration, conservation and comedy. The event is traditionally held in March around Douglas’ Birthday, which is 11th March.\n\nThe lecture brings Douglas’ fans together, shares an insight into many fascinating topics with brilliant speakers, and raises vital funds for rhino conservation. In recent years we’ve been privileged to hear lectures from Alice Roberts, Brian Cox and Neil Gaiman.\n\nWe’re excited to bring this event back in 2021 to celebrate such a significant year after a hiatus since 2016, and of course, opportunity could not be missed to bring a digital version of the event.\n\nThis year, the event includes: a fascinating lecture by Baroness Susan Greenfield (The Creative Mind: Insights from Neuroscience), and a presentation by Arvind Ethan David (On the Advisability of Writing Fan Mail), featuring the world premiere of “Socially Distanced Dirk” a new holistic short starring Samuel Barnett and Hannah Marks. Producer and Comedian Rachel Wheeley will be your host.\n\nDetails:\n\nDate – Thursday 11th March 2021\n\nTime – 1900 GMT\n\nCost – Suggested donation £10.00\n\nTickets for the show start at £4.20. The suggested donation is £10.00. We encourage everyone to donate what they can. Your donation will help us to continue our vital work to protect rhinos.\n\nYour purchase includes access to view the show on demand from 12 am GMT on 12 March through 19 March.\n\nAbout the speakers:\n\nBaroness Susan Greenfield\n\nFounder and CEO of Neuro-Bio Ltd, Baroness Greenfield is a neuroscientist, writer and broadcaster.
