        "text": "If you're keeping up with the Bachelor like Sue and I are, you may have noticed 2 of the men trying to win over Katie's heart are from New Jersey.\n\nOne was Jeff, who according to his Cast Bio from ABC is a \"surgical skin salesman\" from Jersey City. His time on the show was cut short after he brought Katie into his RV that was ...not presentable, to say the least. Things went very well for the other Jersey Guy, Greg Grippo, who is a sales rep from Edison. He wowed Katie over so much, that she gave him the first impression rose! And I mean, of course he did, look how cute he is:\n\nIf you're not familiar with the show, the first impression rose goes to the contestant who the lead can't stop thinking about, or gave a \"good first impression,\" as the title says. It saves them from elimination before the official rose ceremony even starts. Throughout the show's history, the recipient of the first impression rose usually makes it pretty far in the show, or even wins (i.e.: Peter Weber and Madison Prewitt, Clare Crawley, and Dale Moss, etc).\n\nNew Jersey isn't a very big state, and everyone here is connected in some way or another. So I couldn't help but wonder if I knew Greg in some way - and then realized probably every girl around my age in the Garden State is thinking the same thing. I ended up making this funny TikTok that shows the conversation we all had after watching the show's premiere. Check it out!\n\n@dianagebbiaAll Jersey Girls watching The Bachelorette last night. ##lifeisgood ##MACscaraface ##besties ##thebachelorette ##greggrippo ##nj ##newjersey ##jerseygirl â™¬ Spongebob - Dante9k\n\nNow, do we know if Greg Grippo is necessarily going to win or make it far? No. But, he's adorable and he's from New Jersey, so he's got that going for him. In fact, if he does win, he'll be the second Bachelorette contestant from NJ in recent history to walk off into the sunset with the lead. On the last season of the Bachelorette, it was Zac Clark from Haddonfield who got engaged to Tayshia Adams (and they're still going strong!)\n\nDo you think Greg Grippo will take home the final rose?"
