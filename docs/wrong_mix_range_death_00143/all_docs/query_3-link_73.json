        "text": "First of all, I always manage to miss International Towel Day on May 25th. It commemorates the day of Douglas Adams’ far too early passing. Towel Day is celebrated every year on as a tribute to the author by his fans. On this day, fans carry a towel with them, as described in Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, to demonstrate their appreciation for the books and the author.\n\nMy friend Cherrie still has the original newspaper clipping about his passing on her refrigerator. I’m not sure we ever recovered from his loss. Certainly the publishing industry never recovered.\n\nMy day is March 11th and was also Douglas Adams’ birthday. He was three years younger than me. I like to think of us as time twins even though we aren’t quite. I not only read his books, but I can recite many sections of it aloud from memory. I have read and reread those books with a special affection for “The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul.”\n\nUnlike my birthday which is singularly bereft of celebrities,Garry’s birthday is populated with celebrities. More movies stars than most. There’s something about April birthdays and performers. Probably it’s the whole Aries thing, an astrological sign that dearly loves the spotlight.\n\nGarry’s April 7th birthday is shared with James Garner, Francis Ford Coppola, Russell Crowe, Jackie Chan, Janis Ian, Adrian Beltre, Ravi Shankar, Raphael, Billie Holiday, William Wordsworth, Michael Bellisario (NCIS producer/director), Percy Faith, Jerry Brown (past California governor). Let’s not forget Joe Gallo. To put it in perspective, there was also Charlemagne, first Holy Roman Emperor. Note that he wasn’t holy or Roman and his empire lasted (barely) until his death, though the Empire’s name lingered on for a few more centuries.\n\nAs for me? As far as I know, Douglas Adams was pretty much IT.\n\nIf you haven’t heard of Douglas Adams, bow your head in shame. Find his books and start reading, laughing, and seeing the universe in a brand new way. I got lucky and have the recording of Douglas Adams reading his OWN work. Because they were his, they aren’t the same as printed versions. I have several and they vary in length depending on his mood when he recorded them. I suspect he didn’t use text to read them but pretty much read them from memory. They range from 3 to 6 hours with section moving from one place to another. He added pieces that were not in any published versions.\n\nAnd to all you Douglas Adams lovers? Don’t we wish he were here with us in this time of madness? He predicted — in his own insane and hilarious way — a time of upcoming madness. He was right. We could sure use the funny along with the crazy."
