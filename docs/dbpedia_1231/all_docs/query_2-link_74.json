        "text": "LIMA: Peru's congress suspended lawmaker Kenji Fujimori late Wednesday over corruption allegations but lacked a quorum to dismiss him as part of a fight with his sister for control of their father's political dynasty.\n\nBut the speaker of the chamber, Luis Galarreta, then suspended the session citing a lack of quorum -- 67 lawmakers -- before it could vote on a motion to dismiss Fujimori altogether as sought by the party of his sister and rival, Keiko Fujimori.\n\nKenji Fujimori, 38, is accused of attempting to buy votes to keep disgraced former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski from being impeached. Kuczynski ended up resigning, in March.\n\nWith Fujimori now out of congress, the vote Wednesday night shapes up as a win, albeit a costly one, for his sister in their battle for control of their father Alberto's political legacy."
