        "text": "Discussion\n\nOur analysis after propensity score matching demonstrated that antibiotics use could reduce the risk of intestinal resection and stoma creation for uncomplicated diverticulitis. Multivariate analysis using data before propensity score matching also showed that nonantibiotic therapy was a clinical factor that increased the risk of intestinal resection and stoma creation. Second- and third-generation cephalosporins were the most common antibiotics administered for diverticulitis in Japan.\n\nThe efficacy of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated diverticulitis is controversial. Two randomized controlled trials reported no differences in the time to recovery, hospital stay, complicated diverticulitis, and sigmoid resection between groups receiving antibiotics or conservative therapy [4, 5]. Two guidelines for diverticular diseases from Germany and the European Society of Coloproctology recommend that antibiotic therapy need not be prescribed routinely [21, 22]. In contrast, the guideline of the Japanese Gastroenterological Association states that antibiotic therapy is considered acceptable in present clinical practice because no studies have been conducted in Japan [23]. Our study included a high volume of patient admissions and showed that initiation of antibiotic therapy within 2 days after admission could reduce the risk of intestinal resection and stoma creation. Both analyses after propensity score matching and a multivariate analysis showed the same result. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to report the clinical efficacy of antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, our study is retrospective, and several biases such as selection bias could exist, which we discuss below. Although there are some limitations, our study findings indicated that antibiotic therapy in the early phase after admission could be effective; therefore, antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated diverticulitis should be considered. We additionally conducted another propensity score matching to evaluate in more detail patients’ background and eliminate confounding bias to the extent possible. Similar results in the clinical outcomes were observed (online suppl. Tables 1, 2; for all online suppl. material, see https://doi.org/10.1159/000534167).\n\nThe reason the results differed between the two previous randomized controlled trials and our data might be owing to differences in the number of participants in each study. The two previous randomized controlled trials included hundreds of participants. Although calculation of the required sample size was conducted in each study, the number of participants might have been too small to compare the rates of surgery and complication; those rates in the previous studies were very low (1.9–3.8%) [4, 5]. On the contrary, the DPC database includes so-called big data, with a large amount of admission data across Japan. Our analysis after propensity score matching included over 6,000 admissions each in the antibiotic and nonantibiotic groups, making it easy to detect slight differences in the surgery rate between groups.\n\nThe rates of in-hospital death were not different between the antibiotic and nonantibiotic groups. A multicenter retrospective study reported that the rate of in-hospital death among patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis was 0.2% [24], which was similar to our result. The mortality rate owing to uncomplicated diverticulitis is expected to be very low. Therefore, antibiotic therapy might not affect the mortality rate in uncomplicated diverticulitis.\n\nOur multivariate analysis revealed that older age was a clinical factor that increases the risk of stoma creation. Elderly patients are usually expected to have a worse general condition compared to younger patients and develop complications after surgery. Therefore, surgeons may be likely to select stoma creation for elderly patients in order to avoid anastomotic leakage. Another retrospective study also showed that older age was a risk factor that was associated with stoma creation [25].\n\nThe median duration of hospital stay and median medical costs differed between the two groups. Although the interquartile range in each group was slightly different, the length of hospital stay in each group was 8 days. We consider that differences in the duration of hospital stay may not have clinical importance. However, medical costs in the antibiotic group were higher than those in the nonantibiotic group, which might be owing to the cost of antibiotics. Although higher than the surgery rate in the antibiotic group, the surgery rate in the nonantibiotic group was only approximately 3%. Therefore, the higher surgery rate in the nonantibiotic group might not affect the overall medical costs.\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, the DPC database does not contain details of patients’ clinical data or information including body temperature, laboratory data, and CT findings. Those data are useful to detect the severity and complications of diverticulitis and clinical course of diverticulitis. Therefore, we alternatively evaluated the rates of intestinal resection, stoma creation, and in-hospital death. The DPC database also does not contain the time of admission, only the date of admission. Therefore, we defined admissions with antibiotic administration within 2 days after admission as the antibiotic group. Similarly, we limited cases to those that received CT within 2 days after admission so as to only select urgent admissions owing to diverticulitis. The reason why patients in the nonantibiotic group were not administered antibiotics within 2 days after admission was unclear. Furthermore, the criteria of antibiotics use were also unclear on the DPC database. Second, several biases and confounding factors could exist even though we conducted propensity score matching and multivariate analysis. We excluded complicated cases containing the words “abscess,” “peritonitis,” and “perforation” in the descriptions of comorbidities at admission. However, there is a possibility that we did not completely eliminate those complications at admission. Furthermore, the DPC database contains only data of inpatients, not outpatients in other hospitals or clinics. Some patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis were conservatively treated without admission. Our data may not reflect all patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis, and selection bias might exist in this study. For the same reason, we were not able to collect the data of patients’ background including past medical history and medications which improves the validity of comparison between antibiotic and nonantibiotic groups in this study. Third, the DPC database does not follow patients who are transferred to another hospital. Therefore, we calculated the number of admissions, not individuals. We cannot analyze the long-term prognosis and distinguish whether the admission is a first one or a recurrence for the same reason. Although our results from a large amount of database indicated that antibiotic administration for diverticulitis might improve the outcome, further prospective studies with an adequate number of participants are necessary to address the limitations in this study."
