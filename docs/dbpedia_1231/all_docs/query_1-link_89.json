        "text": "The announcement came after Fujimori's son Kenji split the opposition vote in parliament, allowing Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski to avoid impeachment and sparking speculation about a pardon as political payback.\n\n\"The president of the republic... has decided to grant a humanitarian pardon to Mr Alberto Fujimori and seven other people in similar condition,\" the presidency said in a statement that did not name the other pardon recipients.\n\nA medical team \"determined that Mr Fujimori suffers from a progressive, degenerative and incurable illness and that prison conditions represent a grave risk to his life,\" the statement said.\n\nKenji Fujimori hailed the decision.\n\n\"On behalf of the Fujimori family, I would like to thank President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski for the noble and magnanimous gesture of giving my father Alberto the humanitarian pardon,\" he wrote on his Twitter account.\n\nAlberto Fujimori was transferred from his cell to a clinic Saturday suffering from low blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. The 79-year-old had a \"sudden drop of pressure with marked arrhythmia,\" doctors said.\n\n\"He is making adequate progress in the intensive care unit,\" said his physician Alejandro Aguinaga. \"He will remain hospitalized for as long as necessary, until he has stabilized.\"\n\nFujimori, in office from 1990 to 2000 and imprisoned since 2005, was admitted amid rumors that he could be pardoned this Christmas.\n\nHe was loved by many for going after the rebels but hated by others for the ruthless, authoritarian way he governed.\n\nHis decade as president from 1990 and the years that followed were marked by a dramatic series of sieges, massacres and escapades.\n\nThey ended with him in jail, a frail, gray figure crippled by back pain and high blood pressure.\n\nA descendant of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori was a marginal figure among political parties but cultivated the support of the armed forces.\n\nUnder him and his hardline security chief Vladimiro Montesinos, state forces virtually wiped out the leftist Shining Path and Tupac Amaru rebels.\n\nFujimori also clamped down hard on his political rivals. In 1992, he staged an internal coup, dissolving the legislature with the knowledge of only Montesinos and military chiefs.\n\n\"Act first, tell people about it later,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nFaxing his resignation\n\nOne of the most dramatic episodes of his time in power was a four-month hostage ordeal at the Japanese embassy in Lima from December 1996.\n\nCommandos ended up raiding the embassy, saving nearly all the VIPs held by Tupac Amaru guerrillas and killing the 14 hostage-takers.\n\nThat strengthened Fujimori's reputation for fighting terrorism with a firm hand.\n\nAt the same time, he won popular support for boosting the economy of the South American country, a major mineral exporter.\n\nHis neo-liberal economic policies won him the support of the ruling class and international financial institutions.\n\nBut the dark flipside of his supposed success was revealed when he was found guilty of human rights violations for the killings of suspects by death squads.\n\nFujimori's downfall began in 2000 after Montesinos was exposed for corruption.\n\nThe president fled to Japan and sent a fax announcing his resignation.\n\nCongress voted to sack him instead and ban him from public office for 10 years.\n\nHe was eventually arrested when he set foot in Chile and extradited back to Peru for trial.\n\nFamily drama\n\nA court held him responsible for the killings of 25 supposed guerrillas and sympathizers in 1991 and 1992.\n\nIt sentenced him in 2009 to 25 years in jail.\n\nIn a separate case, he pleaded guilty to bribing lawmakers and spying on former rivals while in power.\n\nThe soap opera within the Fujimori family matched the drama of his turbulent decade in office.\n\nHis former wife Susana Higuchi divorced him in 1994, and later accused his men of torturing her.\n\nHis daughter Keiko Fujimori took over as the nation's first lady at the age of 19.\n\nShortly after their divorce, Higuchi ran against her ex-husband in an election in 1995, but he blocked her by passing a law prohibiting presidents' close family from succeeding them directly in office.\n\nOnce jailed, Fujimori was in and out of the hospital with heart, back and stomach trouble. He had several operations to remove cancerous growths from his tongue.\n\nThe courts in 2017 rejected efforts by Fujimori's family to have him pardoned and freed from prison.\n\nBut just days after Fujimori's son Keiko helped President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski survive an impeachment vote, the presidency announced that the jailed strongman would be granted clemency due to his poor health."
