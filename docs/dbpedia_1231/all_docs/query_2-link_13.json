        "text": "LIMA, Peru (AP) — The political party loyal to former President Alberto Fujimori expelled the ex-strongman’s son Tuesday as a rift widened between his two children over the party’s botched attempt to oust Peru’s current president in December.\n\nThe son, Kenji Fujimori, led a group of rebellious lawmakers from the Popular Will party who blocked a legislative push by the party, headed by his sister, to remove Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski for alleged corruption linked to Brazilian construction company Odebrecht.\n\nTwo days later, the scandal-tainted Kuczynski granted a medical pardon to Alberto Fujimori in what many see as a closed-door political deal. The elder Fujimori had been serving a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses and graft committed during his 1990-2000 rule. The pardon angered many Peruvians and has brought periodic protests, including on Tuesday.\n\nAlthough Kenji Fujimori obtained the most votes of any lawmaker in 2016 congressional elections, he has taken a back seat in the party to his older sister, Keiko Fujimori, who narrowly lost the presidency to Kuczynski in a runoff election.\n\nHis expulsion was the biggest sign of discord between the siblings.\n\nKenji Fujimori confirmed on his Twitter account the party’s decision to remove him.\n\nKeiko and Alberto Fujimori made no immediate public comment on his expulsion from the party."
