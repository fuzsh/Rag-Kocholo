        "text": "In December, 2016, at a private dinner with a handful of friends in a hotel in the Peruvian colonial city of Arequipa, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Peru’s new President, sipped on a Martini and grumbled about his political enemies. He called them “the Fujis,” a derisive reference to Keiko Fujimori, a former member of Congress and the leader of the Fuerza Popular Party; Kenji Fujimori, Keiko’s brother and also a member of Fuerza Popular; and Alberto Fujimori, their father and the country’s disgraced former President, who was doing time in prison. That June, Kuczynski—or P.P.K., as he is widely known—had unexpectedly defeated Keiko Fujimori in Peru’s Presidential election, winning by less than one per cent of the over-all vote. But Fujimori’s Fuerza Popular Party still dominated Congress. The Fujis, Kuczynski said, were clearly determined to make his life in office impossible; they had been blocking his Cabinet choices and voting against everything he proposed. Unless he could find a way to halt them, he would have a hard time getting anything done.\n\nKuczynski’s worries turned out to be well placed. On Wednesday, one day ahead of an all-but-certain impeachment vote in Congress, he appeared on television to announce his resignation from the Presidency. Seated at a desk and flanked by his Cabinet members, who stood uncomfortably behind him, Kuczynski fulminated against those who had driven him from office. He said that he had been falsely painted as corrupt, and that his opponents had brought about “a situation of ungovernability.” For the good of Peru, he said, he was stepping down.\n\nKuczynski’s Presidency had been hanging by a thread since the end of last year, when he narrowly survived a first impeachment vote. His opponents—led by “the Fujis”—had moved against him following revelations that, while he had been a minister in a previous government, his private investment company had received several million dollars in payments from the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht. For the past several years, Odebrecht has been implicated in one of Latin America’s largest-ever corruption scandals, centered in Brazil and known there as Operation Car Wash. Odebrecht officials, who have been coöperating with prosecutors in exchange for lesser jail time, have revealed that, over a decade, the company spent eight hundred million dollars in bribes around Latin America to secure official contracts worth billions. They have provided evidence showing that twenty-nine million dollars of the total went into officials’ pockets in Peru. Both of P.P.K.’s immediate predecessors, Alejandro Toledo and Ollanta Humala, were fingered as recipients of some of the bribe money. Early last year, Humala was arrested and imprisoned, where he remains, awaiting trial, while Toledo, who has been convicted in absentia, has refused to come home from an aerie in California.\n\nKuczynski had denied ever receiving any payments from Odebrecht. But late last year it emerged that while he was serving as a minister in Toledo’s government, a business partner had received money from the company. Kuczynski claimed not to know about the payments, which were apparently legal ones—Odebrecht’s officials, who knew about such things, have said that the fees paid to Kuczynski’s firm were aboveboard and not part of their bribery scheme. Still, things did not look good.\n\nIn an atmosphere of gathering public mistrust, Kuczynski’s moral character was called into question. He defended himself, but clumsily, in a public television roundtable with journalists, and then, when the impeachment vote came to a head, he survived thanks only to the abstentions of a few Fuerza Popular congressmen loyal to Keiko Fujimori’s brother Kenji. This raised some eyebrows. Three days later, when Kuczynski issued a pardon to the ailing, imprisoned Fujimori senior, it was clear to everyone that a deal had been done. Kuczynski was excoriated by many of his former allies, and a number of his ministers resigned in disgust.\n\nKuczynski’s reprieve did not last long. This week, as he and his opponents squared off for another impeachment vote, several videos emerged, apparently shot last December. They show Kenji Fujimori, a lawyer for Kuczynski, and a senior government official offering to give a congressman a cut from public-works contracts in return for his support for Kuczynski in the first impeachment vote. Kuczynski denied any knowledge of the shenanigans apparently undertaken on his behalf, but the damage was done, and his resignation came within twenty-four hours.\n\nThe great irony of Kuczynski’s downfall is that he ran for the Presidency on a promise to bring transparency to government. It was also a dismal end to a long and distinguished public career, one that at its height—immediately after he won the Presidency—had appeared to offer a fresh start to a country with a calamitous, even shameful, recent political history.\n\nOne could choose different moments to begin the chronology, but most Peruvians would agree that the country’s fall from grace, and from self-faith, began with Fujimori’s ten-year Presidency, which ended ignominiously in 2000, when he fled the country to Japan, in the midst of an erupting corruption scandal involving his right-hand man, Vladimiro Montesinos, Peru’s spy chief. Fujimori informed his countrymen of his resignation by fax from Tokyo. After five years in Japan, the ex-President travelled to Chile, where the government arrested him and extradited him back to Peru for trial. He was convicted and sentenced to twenty-five years in prison for crimes against humanity and corruption—until Kuczynski’s pardon last December. (Montesinos, meanwhile, was run to ground in 2001 in Venezuela. Since being brought back to Peru he has remained in prison, where he has been periodically tried and convicted of crimes ranging from torture and bribery to drug and arms trafficking. In his latest trial, in 2016, he was sentenced to twenty-five more years in jail. Now seventy-two, he seems unlikely ever to leave prison.)\n\nPeruvians are reeling from a lack of faith in their institutions and their national morale is at an all-time low. A tweet I saw from a Peruvian on Friday seemed to say it all: “By the way, what do you think about Perú? It’s latin america, we have no hope.” Kuczynski has been supplanted by his Vice-President, Martín Vizcarra, and the Fujimori siblings have been duking it out in Peru’s congress, with Keiko excoriating her brother for his involvement in a vote-buying scheme, and Kenji blaming his sister for sending a loyalist spy to make the secret videotapes and releasing them. It was all rather creepy, a disquieting echo of the behavior that cost their father the Presidency eighteen years ago. Kenji Fujimori quit the Fuerza Popular Party in March, and promised to form his own, with an eye, evidently, to run against his sister in 2021. Recalling that December, 2016, dinner with Kuczynski, I remember him saying that unless the Fujis could be stopped, he was doomed, and he was right. Now the question is, what lies ahead for Peru?"
