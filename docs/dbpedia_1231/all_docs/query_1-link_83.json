        "text": "On December 24, 2017, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (PPK), the President of Peru, granted Alberto Fujimori (President of Peru from 1990 to 2000) a humanitarian pardon just three days after PPK was almost ousted from the presidency because of alleged ties to the Obrecht corruption scandal. However, during the congressional process for impeachment, ten fujimoristas legislators abstained from voting and effectively kept PPK in the presidency. PPK, many within the government, and Fuerza Popular argue that Fujimori was pardoned because of his health while many Peruvians believe it was a political deal made between PPK and Fujimori’s younger son, Kenji Fujimori. Fujimori was elected president of Peru in 1990 and in 1992 he carried out a self-coup, eliminated Congress, and enacted a new Constitution. His legacy is one that still divides the country because many say he saved the country from hyperinflation and defeated the Shining Path, an insurgency, while his critics say he was a dictator who eliminated Congress, engaged in corruption, created death squads, and acquiesced in gross violations of human rights. Fujimori was convicted on April 7, 2009 when “the Special Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court handed down a historic unanimous judgment convicting former dictator Alberto Fujimori on four charges of human rights violations: the multiple murders of La Cantuta and Barrios Altos, and the kidnappings of Samuel Dyer and journalist Gustavo Gorriti.” This judgment was a landmark for the region because demonstrated that no one is above the law, not even former heads of state.\n\nBeyond the political context, the pardon of Fujimori raises important issues under domestic and international law, in particular whether pardons for persons convicted of crimes against humanity are compatible with victims’ right to justice under international human rights law. This novel issue will be discussed today before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR). Both La Cantuta and Barrios Altos were litigated before the IACHR on Human Rights and are subject to judgments which are now in the monitoring compliance stage. Shortly after the pardon, the IACHR convened a public hearing for February 2, 2018 where the government and representatives of the victims will present their arguments for and against the pardon. The victims will be represented by Viviana Krsticevic (CEJIL), Gloria Cano (APRODEH) and Carlos Rivera (IDL). Information on the hearing (starting at 10:15 Costa Rica time) can be found at the IACHR’s website http://www.corteidh.or.cr\n\nAs a background information, you may access the complete judgment convicting Fujimori in Spanish at the following link: https://www.unifr.ch/ddp1/derechopenal/jurisprudencia/j_20101107_05.pdf"
