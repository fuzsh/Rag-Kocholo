        "text": "Havana, march 22 (RHC)-- Peru's Congress is taking steps to eliminate five senators, including Kenji Fujimori, in light of secretly recorded videos released last night showing Kenji and Kuczynksi lawyers trying to buy the vote of a fellow legislator in exchange for kickbacks.\n\nA series of videos began circulating last night on the internet showing Kenji with the lawyer of recently resigned President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and the National Superintendent of Security and Arms, Freddy Aragon, offering legislator Moises Mamani five percent in kickbacks for future public works projects if he voted against impeaching Kuczynski last December.\n\n\"We’re making a constitutional move to impeach (congressional members) Kenji Fujimori, Bienvenido Ramirez, Guillermo Bocangel, Mercedes Araoz and Carlos Bruce\", said right-wing opposition legislator, Luis Galarreta of the Popular Force (PF) party.\n\n\"We’re initiating the process … to impeach these five parliamentary members involved in the videos,\" added Galarreta, who is also congressional president. Local media sources say at least 100 of the necessary 87 legislators are supporting their removal."
