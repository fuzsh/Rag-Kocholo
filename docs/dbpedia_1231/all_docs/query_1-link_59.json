        "text": "Former Peruvian strongman Alberto Fujimori was rushed by ambulance to a Lima clinic Wednesday just after the Supreme Court ordered the pardoned president back to prison.\n\nThere is no word on the condition of the 80 year-old Fujimori who was serving a 25 year-long sentence for crimes against humanity when he got a medical pardon last year.\n\nThe Peruvian Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that Fujimori was not entitled to be freed from jail because crimes against humanity are not eligible for a pardon under Peruvian and international law.\n\nFujimori had been living in a rented Lima mansion. His attorney has filed an appeal, saying the old man has a bad heart and going back to prison could kill him.\n\nFujimori is revered by some Peruvians and despised by others. He was elected in 1990 and in his 10 years in power, he put down a rebellion by the leftist Shining Path guerillas and saved Peru from economic ruin.\n\nBut Fujimori was an authoritarian leader whose far-right death squads massacred civilians as part of operations against the guerillas.\n\nHe was also accused of massive corruption and fled Peru for Japan in 2000, when he was mocked for handing in his resignation by fax.\n\nFujimori was arrested in Chile in 2006 and put on trial in Peru.\n\nFormer Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned Fujimori last Christmas and barely survived an impeachment vote with the help from Fujimori allies in Congress.\n\nKuczynski resigned in March and is under investigation for the pardon."
