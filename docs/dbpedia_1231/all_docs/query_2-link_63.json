The contributions of electrolyte-electrode interfaces, grain boundaries, intragrain ion-hopping, and optical phonons were quantified to relate the microscopic conduction behavior to the overall conductivity. Intrinsic conductivity was mostly governed by ion-hopping. For both 8YSZ and 8YbSZ, ion-hopping followed the universal dielectric response (UDR) for broadband frequencies except for the phonon dispersion frequencies. The higher overall conductivities of the 8YbSZ ceramics compared to the 8YSZ ones were attributed to differences in the UDR contributions. The dominant factor determining the difference in the intrinsic conductivity in broadband frequencies from direct current (DC) to microwave between the 8YSZ and 8YbSZ ceramics was the DC conductivity due to UDR, sigma(dc), where sigma(dc(8YbSZ)) &gt; sigma(dc(8YSZ)). Other parameters in the UDR and the optical parameters did not greatly influence the intrinsic conductivities.

In design of the units based on their equivalent circuit, frequency dependency of the admittance of individual elements in the equivalent circuit was taken into account. In addition, the length of the waveguide between the adjacent units was optimized in order to maximize isolation among the coaxial branch ports in the different units.

In our previous papers, some RF-DC conversion circuits with high conversion efficiency at low input power are proposed. However, these RF-DC conversion circuits have some parts of which size depends on operating frequency, so the circuit size becomes large at low operating frequency. And, the composition of these RF-DC conversion circuits is complicated. Therefore, in this paper, a new RF-DC conversion circuit composed of only chip devices is proposed. This circuit has higher conversion efficiency than the previously proposed circuits. And, size reduction of the RF-DC conversion circuit is realized. Moreover, the composition of the circuit is simple, so the circuit size does not depend on operating frequency. For design of the RF-DC conversion circuits, LE-FDTD method is used. The measurement results agree with analytical results of the LE-FDTD method very well, and availability of the LE-FDTD method is discovered. It is shown that LE-FDTD method is a powerful analytical way which can give efficient design of RF-DC conversion circuit with high conversion efficiency.\n\nDOIï¼ 10.1587/transele.E93.C.1323\n\nWeb of Science\n\nresearchmap\n\nRF to DC Conversion for Wireless Power Transmission\n\nShigeji Nogi, Kazuhiro Fujimori, Minoru Sanagi\n\nThe IEICE Transactions on Electronics Â J93-C ( 12 ) Â 540 - 548 Â 2010\n\nãMore details\n\nresearchmap\n\nAn important relation for determining a high-efficiency RF DC Conversion Circuit\n\nShohei Imai, Kazuhiro Fujimori, Minoru Sanagi, Shigeji Nogi\n\n2010 ASIA-PACIFIC MICROWAVE CONFERENCE Â 2319 - 2322 Â 2010\n\nãMore details\n\nLanguageï¼English Â Publisherï¼IEEE Â\n\nFor designing a high-efficiency RF DC conversion circuit, simulations and trial and error usually occupy a large part of the work. Such design method needs much time. The important part of design is to design an input circuit. The efficiency of a conversion circuit mainly depends on input circuit. However, it is difficult to design the input circuits. This study takes notice of the voltage when the DC load resistance is open. The open DC load voltage is an important quantity for design of the high-efficiency RF DC conversion circuit. We show by experiments and simulations that the efficiency of an RF DC conversion circuit tends to increase with the open DC load voltage.

Especially, mobile terminals such as mobile phones are actively developed. In developments of mobile terminals, miniaturization and frequency multiband of antennas are very important issues. However, there are no rational design strategy in small antenna designs. So, antenna developments depends on electromagnetic simulators or capability of engineer. And many cut-and-try processes are necessary for achieving desired characteristic. This makes many problems such as prolongation of developments. Then, now, automatic design techniques of antenna using genetic algorithm (GA) are paid attention.\n\nIn this paper, the new design strategy for miniaturization of antennas is proposed by operation of chromosome-length in GA. Proposed design technique provides a minimum area necessary for keeping characteristics of a antenna. And, efficient miniaturization of a antenna and removing many undesirable conductors in a design ares are possible. Removing undesirable conductors provides lower-cost designing of antennas.

This system has multiple operating modes, but by causing a slight deviation of only the free-running frequency of the end oscillator from the frequency of the injection signal, mode jumps can be suppressed and the phase difference between the oscillators made large. The effectiveness of this method can be numerically confirmed by finding the conditions for single mode operation with an approximation analysis of the governing equation. Using an active integrated antenna constructed of a patch antenna and serial-feedback FET oscillators, an experiment was performed by scanning the radiation beams of two-, three-, and five-element antenna arrays to demonstrate that the scan range in the radiation direction was extended with single mode operation.

Most design tools for circuits are based on the fundamental circuit theory using the S matrix combined with the harmonic-balance method. Consequently, the electromagnetic effect is ignored or approximated at best. Therefore, the extended finite-difference time-domain(FDTD) method combined with the equivalent circuit simulation had been presented. However, it takes very long times to analyze any circuits. In this paper, we propose a novel extended FDTD method to reduce calculation resources. We investigate its efficiency to compare with the conventional extended FDTD method or measurements, consequently, it is confirmed that the proposal method is required calculation resources less than 10% compared with the conventional method. We also show that the proposal method is able to analyze characteristics of the active integrated antenna(AIA) which are practicably impossible to analyze by using the conventional method.

The active antenna is composed of a patch antenna receiving RF signal and a parallel feedback type oscillator which operates as the self-oscillating harmonic mixer, and down-converts the received RF signal into IF signal. The mixer has two ports for local oscillating (LO) signal. One is an output port extracting the LO signal. The other is an input port for an injection signal to synchronize the local oscillation. The mixers can be coupled unilaterally without other nonreciprocal components by connecting the output port to the input port in the next mixer. In the unilaterally coupled array, the phase differences of the LO signals between the adjacent mixers can be varied without phase shifters in injection locking state by changing the local free-running frequencies of the self-oscillating mixers. The receiving pattern can be controlled by combining the IF signals from the individual active antennas, which have phases associated with the LO signals. The IF is difference between the RF and double of the LO frequency so that arbitrary phase differences from 0 to 2 pi radian can be provided to the output IF signals. The experiments using the two- and three-element arrays demonstrated beam control capability.\n\nDOIï¼ 10.1093/ietele/e88-c.7.1375\n\nWeb of Science\n\nresearchmap\n\nSecond Harmonic Oscillator with Optimum Fundamental Load\n\nNAKANE Takafumi, SANAGI Minoru, TAKAHASHI Shingo, KAMEI Ryu, FUJIMORI Kazuhiro, NOGI Shigeji\n\nIEICE technical report.

The propagation characteristics considering the radiation pattern of an antenna placed inside the tunnel are estimated. By comparison of the measured and analyzed results, the effectiveness and validity of the ray tracing method are shown. The propagation loss and fading in the tunnel are discussed. Further, the propagation characteristic is estimated by considering the radiation pattern of the base station antenna for the tunnel booster system. The analysis demonstrates that the dual radiation pattern is effective for the base station antenna. The variation of the covered area when the radiation pattern is varied is studied.
