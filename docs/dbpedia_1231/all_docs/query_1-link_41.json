        "text": "LIMA, Peru — Alberto K. Fujimori, the former president of Peru who had been serving a 25-year sentence for human rights violations, spent Friday — his first day of freedom after being granted a medical pardon — inside a house in a quiet suburb of Lima as he recovered from illnesses that had sent him to a hospital bed for almost two weeks.\n\nMr. Fujimori, 79, left a Lima hospital in a wheelchair on Thursday night, waving to journalists waiting outside as he stepped into a black S.U.V. that took him to a large house in the quiet, upscale neighborhood of La Molina. He was accompanied by his son, Congressman Kenji Fujimori, who posted on Twitter a picture and a video with his father as they made their way through the capital. Once at the house, Mr. Fujimori was reunited with his four children.\n\nIt also revealed the deep divisions within Popular Force, a party led by Mr. Fujimori’s elder daughter, and reopened some of the scars from the complex legacy of Mr. Fujimori. In office from 1990 to 2000, he remains a deeply divisive figure here, respected in some quarters for his economic overhauls and his crackdown on two violent insurgencies, but reviled by others for his strongman tactics and for military-backed atrocities during his tenure.\n\nIt is unclear what role, if any, Mr. Fujimori might play in Peruvian politics. Samuel Abad, a constitutional lawyer, said Mr. Fujimori could seek office, or return to Japan — where he lived for five years in exile after his presidency, and where he is a citizen, through his parents, who emigrated from Japan to Peru.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
