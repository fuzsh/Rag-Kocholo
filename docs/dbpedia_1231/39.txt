Peruvian Keiko Fujimori, right, smiles as her brother Kenji Fujimori watches the media, during her wedding in Lima, Peru, on Saturday, July 3, 2004. A small group of protesters put a damper on the wedding Saturday of Keiko Fujimori, daughter of Peru's fugitive former President Alberto Fujimori, now in exile in Japan. The group carried a placard with the faces of Fujimori and his former security adviser Vladimiro Montesinos, jailed in Peru and on trial on dozens of charges ranging from corruption to murder.
