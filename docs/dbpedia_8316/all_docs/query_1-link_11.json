Happy Valentine's day my love.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nEven Aishwarya expressed her love for Mohit in an endearing post and wrote, \"We find love in long conversations, the nonstop bickering, beautiful memories and the purest of souls. Happy Valentine's Day! I love you my jaan.\"\n\nThe couple has been dating for a while now but they'd never openly expressed their love for each other on social media platforms. Nonetheless, they look great together and look so much in love.\n\nAlso see: Prince Narula to Mohit Malhotra: 5 Splitsvillans who made it big on TV\n\nMohit, who forayed into TV with MTV Splitsvilla 2 has been a part of many popular shows like Bade Achhe Lagte Hain, Kya Hua Tera Vaada, Beintehaa and Jamai Raja.
