        "text": "As we celebrate our Independence Day, I find myself reflecting on the incredible journey our nation has taken to get here. Today isn’t just about looking back at our history; it’s about recognizing the values that continue to shape our future -- Freedom, Unity, and Resilience. These are the same values that drive us every day at Dabur. Whether we’re innovating, collaborating, or simply supporting one another, we’re all part of something bigger -- a shared mission of being dedicated to the Health and Well-being of every Household. On this special day, let’s take pride not only in our country but also in the work we do together. Each member of the Dabur family contributes to something meaningful, and together, we are helping to build a better future for everyone. Wishing you all a very Happy Independence Day. Let’s continue to inspire and uplift each other, today and always. Jai Hind! #Dabur #IndependenceDay #India #JaiHind\n\nTruly humbled and honoured to receive this prestigious Golden Excellence Award in the FMCG industry from His Excellency Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan. On behalf of the 7,000-plus members of the Dabur India Limited family, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the judges for recognizing Dabur and bestowing this honour on us. This award is a testament to the hard work, dedication, and passion of each and every member of the Dabur family. It’s also a celebration of our collective commitment to excellence, innovation, and consumer satisfaction as we work towards our mission of delivering Health & Well-Being to every Household. Thank You! #Dabur #Award #BusinessExcellence\n\nHad the honour of meeting with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to discuss ways to enhance bilateral trade relations between India and Bangladesh. Our discussions were incredibly productive, focusing on areas of mutual interests and the shared vision for economic growth. The discussions were marked by a spirit of cooperation and a shared ambition to create a sustainable and prosperous future for both nations. I am confident that the outcomes of this meeting will pave the way for a stronger, more dynamic trade partnership between the two countries, benefiting businesses and communities on both sides. #Dabur #DaburBangladesh #CII #Trade #Bangladesh\n\nWhat a win Team India! You are the true superheroes who snatched victory from the jaws of defeat and made 1.4 billion chests swell with pride. This T20 World Cup was nothing short of a crash course in management. Our India Captain Rohit Sharma showed the traits of a true leader, an individual who leads from the front, every single time. King Kohli displayed his class act when it mattered the most... in the Finals. As they say, 'Cometh The Time, Cometh The Man'... Form can come and go, but class is permanent. Our pacers Boom Boom Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh were the perfect examples of consistency... delivering results in every single match, while Rishabh was determination personified... to persevere and come back into the India squad and perform after a death defying accident almost derailed his career. And above all, our India coach Rahul Dravid, who I feel, was the epitome of Hard Work. An individual who put together this daredevil team and guided them to the big prize. On a lighter note, sharing a old Bollywood song which truly sums up the nation's mood since last night. Enjoy! #India #T20WorldCup #Cricket\n\nWe Work Hard, We Party Harder! Members of the Dabur family took a well-deserved break from the daily grind to celebrate our collective achievements in 2023-24, at our annual offsite meeting #Euphoria. As we soaked in the sun and breathed in the ocean breeze in Bali, we remembered the countless hours spent pushing boundaries, overcoming challenges, and striving for excellence. This offsite was not just a vacation; it was a testament to the power of perseverance and teamwork. It was a fantastic opportunity to not just reflect on our collective success, but also to look back and identify the missed opportunities while unwinding, bonding with colleagues, and reveling in our successes. We also recognized our top achievers for our dedication and hard work. From outstanding team wins to individual milestones, every achievement was celebrated with enthusiasm and applause. But the real highlight was the evening spent partying! With music blasting and laughter filling the air, we danced away any lingering stress and embraced the camaraderie that comes from working as a team. Here's to the power of teamwork, dedication, and a little bit of fun.. things that make up the Dabur Family! Dabur India Limited #Dabur # #WorkHardPlayHard #TeamCelebration #AchievementUnlocked\n\nThis is a big shoutout to the incredible women who have shaped my life in profound ways: my mother and my wife. They are the epitome of strength, resilience, and unconditional love. I don't need a special day for you, 'cos every day is special with you. My mother, the original SUPERHERO in my life, taught me the power of perseverance and the importance of kindness. And my wife, the heart and soul of our family, embodies grace under pressure and has an unparalleled ability to juggle the demands of work, family, life, and everything in between. Their love knows no bounds. To all the mothers out there, thank you for your endless love, your boundless strength, and your unwavering support. You are the glue that binds us together. Happy Mother's Day! #MothersDay #CelebratingMom #StrengthInMotherhood\n\nThis is a special toast to a dream team that makes success look effortless. A big Shoutout and Thank You to each and every member of the Dabur family. Our success story is a testament to your combined efforts and unwavering support. This Labour Day, let's cherish the moments of triumph, big and small, that we achieve together. #Dabur #DaburFamily #TeamDabur #LabourDay #Success\n\nAs we celebrate World Earth Day today, I wanted to share this exciting news with all of you. Around 20 days back, Dabur India Limited had embarked on a journey to revive a village pond in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh. Happy to share with all of you that we have now transformed it completely and this local pond is now ready to catch the rain this monsoon! The village pond had long been neglected, serving as a stark reminder of the challenges posed by climate change and unsustainable practices. However, with the dedication of our CSR team, we have managed to turn this neglected space into a vibrant ecosystem for the future... one that benefits both people and nature. By restoring the village pond, we will create a habitat for diverse flora and fauna, helping to restore local biodiversity and ecosystem balance. This pond will also serve as a vital water source for the community, supporting agricultural activities, replenishing groundwater levels. This project is not just about environmental conservation; it's about empowering the community to take ownership of their natural resources. We have involved the local residents in every step of the process, from planning and implementation to ongoing maintenance and monitoring. Here's to a Greener, Cleaner Future. #Dabur #DaburCSR #CSR #ReviveThePond #SustainableCommunity #WaterConservation\n\nHad the pleasure of hosting Adolfo Orive, the Global CEO of Tetra Pak, at our headquarters. Our discussions ranged from business and cost reduction strategies to community development programmes and the crucial topic of environmental sustainability. It was truly a pleasure to engage in such meaningful conversations with a man of Mr. Orive's caliber. The discussions ignited a sense of inspiration and motivation to do more for our planet and our communities. It's moments like these that remind us of the power of collaboration and shared passion in driving positive change. I'm thrilled to share that we will be joining forces to craft eco-friendly benches made from recycled Tetra Pak cartons, which will find their purpose in government schools, enriching the educational environment while promoting environmental consciousness. Together, we will pave the way for a greener, more sustainable future... one recycled carton at a time. #Dabur #DaburIndia #CSR #DaburCSR #TetraPak #Sustainability #Recycle #EnvironmentSustainability\n\nAmidst all the chaos, a heartwarming reminder: Humanity is still Alive! Came across this video today which shows an incredible act of compassion as a group of brave souls rescued a mother whale tangled in ocean pollution. Their selfless actions saved a life and restored faith in our capacity for kindness. Let's take this as a call to action! Our oceans are drowning in plastic and pollution, threatening marine life every day. It's time to step up and protect the precious ecosystems that sustain us all. At Dabur India Limited, we have been working towards collecting post-consumer waste from our cities and sending them for processing and recycling, thereby ensuring that this waste does not end up in landfills and oceans. Together, let's pledge to keep our oceans clean, not just for the whales, but for every living creature that calls it home. #SaveOurOceans #HumanityInAction"
