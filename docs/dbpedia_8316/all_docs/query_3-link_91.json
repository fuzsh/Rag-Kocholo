        "text": "Mohit Malhotra a model turned actor is renowned for his popular roles as Vihaan in Kya Hua Tera Vaada, as Kartik in Bade Achhe Lagte Hain on Sony TV, Birju in Star Plus's Mitwa Phool Kamal Ke and as Sid in Sasural Genda Phool. He forayed into the television industry with MTV’s most popular show Splitsvilla, as a participant in the second season of the show.\n\nIn an exclusive chat with Adgully, Mohit shared his experiences of being an actor and also spoke of his pursuit for new opportunities in his career.\n\nWhen asked to share his experience of being a part of Sony’s hit shows, he said “It’s been an amazing journey being part of such brilliant shows and working with my co-casts. Have achieved and learnt a lot with time.”\n\nMohit recently quit both the shows where he was seen playing the role of Kartik for Bade Acche Lagte Hain and Vihan for Kya Hua Tera Vaada.\n\nAs of now he seemed to be very excited being the host for Star Plus’s upcoming dancing reality show India’s Dancing Superstar. “It’s a great opportunity for me and I want to utilize it in the best way possible and I am looking forward to it,” said Mohit.\n\n“Anchoring is what I was eagerly waiting for since a long time. I wanted to experience it so now I am happy to be here as this is the first time I’ll be doing it,” he added.\n\nApart from acting, Mohit has also appeared in numerous print ads including Samsung, Mayur Suitings, Castrol, Pepsi, Minute Maid, Royal Enfield, Convergys, Aircel, Vmart, Jet Airways, Croma and television advertisements like Mazaa, Samsung Mobile, Toyota Etios Liva and many more.\n\nOn asking what made him host this show, he said, “The best part that I liked about this show is that there is no barrier in terms of age, demographic and style here and it is an ideal platform for everyone to show their talent.”\n\nHe personally likes doing the Salsa, having earlier learnt this dance form and is very much inspired by actor and legend Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nWith regard to how acting has been a learning experience for him he shared to say, “Key things that I’ve acquired from television are command over my language , diction, and the aptitude for acting. I feel everyone should be proud of their mother tongue.”\n\nPresently Mohit is just concentrating on his role as an anchor and not looking out for any other projects . He also hopes to get the support of his fans who accepted and liked him in his past roles in the daily soaps.\n\nMohit started his career in this industry without any reference but only through sheer talent. Hence he avers , “To become an actor, confidence and passion for your work is more important than any kind of reference. If you are willing to pursue a certain job / role, work on it and you will get it.” “What is important for me is to work and I don’t want to face any kind of pause in it, may it be acting in television , films, or anchoring and I am ready to take it,” he concluded."
