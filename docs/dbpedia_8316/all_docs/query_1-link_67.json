        "text": "Ahead of this week's big reveal of the contestants who will be appearing on season nine of Bigg Boss, India's version of Celebrity Big Brother, we have a round-up of all the latest news and gossip about the reality-TV show.\n\nThe host\n\nBollywood star Salman Khan, who is back presenting the show for a fifth time, is reportedly being paid 60 million rupees (Dh3m) per episode. Indian media had been speculating about whether he would return, especially after his comments last year about being tired of the show.\n\nThe contestants\n\nThe list of hopefuls is a closely guarded secret until the big announcement, but rumours have been flying for months. Names thrown around include (failed) Bollywood actor, and Ranbir Kapoor's cousin, Arman Jain; Sunil Grover of Comedy Nights with Kapil fame; Splitsvilla 2 runner-up Mohit Malhotra; television actors Mahi Vij, Mayur Verma, Roopal Tyagi and Ankit Gera; activist Nakshatra Bagwe; Salman Khan lookalike Najeem Khan; model Arshi Khan; godwoman Radhe Maa, godman Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh (commonly known as MSG); and actress Sana Saeed.\n\nThe theme\n\nSince this is the ninth season, the producers have focused on \"navarasa\" - or the nine emotions: love, laughter, compassion, anger, courage, terror, disgust, surprise and peace - which might have something to do with the kids of tasks that the contestants will be expected to perform.\n\nTrivia\n\nThere are no fewer than 80 cameras in the house this year, so nothing will go unnoticed.\n\nFor an opportunity to visit the Bigg Boss house, tweet a list of nine contestants you want to see on the show, with the hashtag #BiggBoss\n\nThe first episode of Bigg Boss Nau (9) will be broadcast on October 11 at 9pm on Colors TV\n\najhurani@thenational.ae"
