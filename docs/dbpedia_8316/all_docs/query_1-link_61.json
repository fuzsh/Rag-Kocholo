        "text": "Sidharth Malhotra\n\nBorn: January 16, 1985 (Delhi, India)\n\nThe fact he is dissatisfied with his modeling gigs Sidharth Malhotra, who was born in Delhi, wanted to work in Bollywood. Ironically, formerly the actor started working as an assistant director for Karan Johar, who was in the midst of filming his feature My Name Is Khan at the moment of his first appearance. A short while later, Johar cast the actor in his first starring part in the movie Student of the Year (2012), which also featured Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan, both of whom were making their screen debut debuts.\n\nSidharth's portrayal in his first film gained universal acclaim, and the actor has gone on to establish himself as among the most prominent performers of the younger breed since then. He has such a commanding presence on the screen that Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV compares him to the iconic Amitabh Bachchan. For example, the actor has performed cameos in movies like Hasee Toh Phasee (2014), Ek Villain (2014), and Kapoor and Sons (2009), to name a few of his credits (2016).\n\nEarly Life\n\nSidharth Malhotra was born in Delhi, India, on January 16, 1985, to a Punjabi family. In addition to being the son of Sunil, who used to work for the Indian Merchant Navy, his mother, Rimma, is also a homemaker. Additionally, he has an older brother, Harshad Malhotra, who is employed in the financial profession. He received his elementary and secondary schooling at Delhi's Don Bosco School and Birla Vidya Niketan before pursuing his studies at Bhagat Singh College in New Delhi. During his undergraduate years, Malhotra began taking on modeling gigs in order to supplement his financial situation. Soon after, he was discovered by a model coordinator, and he decided to pursue modeling as a full-time profession. The actor earned the Mr. Gujarat competition in 2007, finished second in the Gladrags Big supermodel and Manhunt tournament in 2007, and was voted Gladrags Face of the Year in 2009.
