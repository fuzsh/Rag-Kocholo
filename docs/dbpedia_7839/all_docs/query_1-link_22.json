        "text": "Our Work\n\nBroad-based development in Niger has been hampered by rapid population growth (almost 70% of the population is under the age of 25), poor infrastructure, extremely low education levels and recurring exposure to multiple concurrent shocks, such as conflict, droughts and floods.\n\nThis high-risk environment hinders investment by foreign governments and the private sector, further limiting the ability of the country and its people to grow economically and effectively mitigate, adapt to and recover from shocks and stresses.\n\nTo help Niger improve its food security and strengthen resilience, Feed the Future invests in efforts to help families increase their access to water and other natural resources, develop businesses, engage in growing markets and improve their health and nutrition. Feed the Future integrates agriculture and nutrition investments to enhance cognitive and physical development, increase economic productivity, strengthen resilience and advance global development. For more information, please view the Nutrition Priority Countries."
