        "text": "The biggest names in the oil industry rely on this region for their supply, leading to reckless deforestation and pollution from almost daily oil spills. Compounded by extreme poverty and historical political unrest, the Niger Delta is suffering.\n\nFor the many endemic resident species, there is little opportunity left for survival without protection. The Critically Endangered and endemic Niger Delta Red Colobus was described by science just 30 years ago. Since then, populations have dropped nearly 80% due to habitat loss and bushmeat hunting and has ranked among the world’s 25 most threatened primates for the last decade. Less than 500 individuals remain in the wild. We must act now.\n\nRainforest Trust and our partner, the SW/Niger Delta Forest Project, need your help as we work urgently to protect a 2,492- acre protected area that will safeguard a key portion of this highly threatened area, and nearly all of the remaining Niger Delta Red Colobus population.\n\nThis project will also save habitat for the endemic Sclater’s Guenon (EN) and Nigerian Putty-nosed Monkey (EN) and the Nigerian White-throated Monkey (EN), Grey Parrot (EN), White-bellied Pangolin (EN) and Red-capped Mangabey (EN).\n\nLocal communities will take their land back and maintain stewardship and ownership of this conservation effort, ultimately ensuring the long-term sustainability of the region, for the benefit of all.\n\nYour support in protecting a small piece of habitat in the core of this vulnerable region can save an entire species and provide a successful model for others to replicate."
