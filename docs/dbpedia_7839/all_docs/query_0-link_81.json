        "text": "Description of the sanctions\n\nThe sanctions regime was established by the Council Decision (CFSP) 2023/2287 concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Niger – specifically the military coup on 26 July 2023 – and the resulting political situation. The decision established a dedicated framework for restrictive measures against natural or legal persons, entities or bodies responsible for actions that threaten the peace, stability and security of Niger or undermine the constitutional order, democracy and the rule of law. In particular, the sanctions target those who are responsible for the arbitrary detention of Niger’s democratically elected authorities or have committed serious violations of applicable international humanitarian law in Niger, and natural or legal persons, entities or bodies associated with them. The natural and legal persons, entities and bodies that are subject to the restrictive measures are listed in Annex 1 to the Council Decision (CFSP) 2023/2287. To date, no individuals or entities have been listed.\n\nTravel restrictions\n\nMember States will take necessary measures to prevent the entry into – or transit through – their territories of those natural persons listed in annexes to the relevant Council regulations.\n\nFreezing of assets\n\nAll funds and economic resources that belong to or are owned, held or controlled by each natural or legal person, entity or body listed in annexes to the relevant Council regulations must be frozen. Nor may funds or economic resources, directly or indirectly, be made available to – or used for the benefit of – such individuals, entities or bodies.\n\nRelevant EU documents\n\nThe EU’s restrictive measures against Niger are in the Council Decision (CFSP) 2023/2287 of 23 October 2023. The aspects of the measures pertaining to EU law are regulated by Council Regulation (EU) No 2023/2406. The sanctions regime is covered by a humanitarian exemption in accordance with UN Security Resolution 2664 (2022)."
