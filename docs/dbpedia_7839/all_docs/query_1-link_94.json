        "text": "2021-2023 Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition (SHCC) Factsheet\n\nBased on Insecurity Insight data, the SHCC identified 18 incidents of violence against or obstruction of health care in Niger in 2023, compared to 13 in 2022 and four in 2021. In 2023, at least seven health workers were kidnapped and health supplies looted with cases more than doubling in Tillabéri region between 2022 and 2023. The factsheet is available in English.\n\nThe data is available to download and can be explored visually using our interactive Attacked and Threatened: Health Care at Risk map.\n\nInsecurity Insight monitors conflict events contributing to food insecurity in Niger as part of its conflict and hunger project. This report documents 697 incidents recorded between 1 January 2015-28 September 2023. Among reported incidents are those involving the looting (i.e. stealing) of livestock; the burning of granaries and markets; killings and abductions of farmers, pastoralists and fishers; and violent clashes between sedentary farmers and nomadic pastoralists. Restrictions imposed on cross-border movements following Niger’s military coup in July 2023 have led to the suspension of some food aid deliveries and have exacerbated difficulties for civilians in accessing food, especially members of vulnerable demographic groups. The data is available for download on HDX.\n\nTo support the humanitarian response in the Sahel, Insecurity Insight is conducting ongoing social media monitoring to understand sentiments on key issues expressed via social media. This document on Niger presents the findings of some 1,500 Facebook posts during the coup d’état in Niger of 26 July 2023. The aim was to identify possible misinformation, disinformation or malformation targeting the aid sector and online sentiment trends that could be indicative of possible risks for international aid organisations as a result of the coup. It found that pro-coup opinions tended to dominate debates about the coup on Facebook but that significant numbers of profiles of people from countries such as Burkina Faso and Mali without direct connections to Niger were contributing to this."
