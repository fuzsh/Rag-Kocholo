        "text": "Niger borders Algeria, Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, and Mali. The northern two-thirds of Niger is desert. In the north-central region are the Aïr Mountains. The country’s highest point is Mount Gréboun at 6,379 feet (1,944 meters). The Lake Chad basin lies in the extreme southeast. Most rivers in Niger flow only during the rainy season. The Niger River and Lake Chad are the only permanent bodies of water.\n\nNiger is one of the hottest countries in the world. Temperatures are high year-round, with averages of between 81–84 °F (27–29 °C). During May, the hottest month, the temperature averages above 100 °F (38 °C) in the afternoon. Rainfall amounts are low and uncertain. The average annual rainfall ranges from 31 inches (79 centimeters) in the far south to less than 4 inches (10 centimeters) in the northern regions that are part of the Sahara. Rainfall varies widely from year to year, and droughts are frequent.\n\nVegetation in Niger varies between regions. The northern desert has few trees and a little grass cover. The south receives enough rainfall to support some vegetation.\n\nThe south is in danger of becoming a desert as well. The vegetation has been drastically reduced as more and more people collect firewood and clear the land for farming and grazing. These actions, combined with the effects of drought, have the potential for making the south into a desert.\n\nElephants, giraffes, hyenas, and lions are found in southern Niger. Hunting and loss of habitat as the area turns into desert threaten the survival of these animals. Crocodiles and hippopotamuses live in the Niger River. The W National Park (so called because the Niger flows through the area in the form of a W) in the southwest is one of the best wildlife preserves in West Africa. The park has the largest population of elephants in West Africa and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996. The Aïr and Ténéré Natural Reserves is another World Heritage site in Niger. It is one of the largest protected sites in Africa and is home to gazelles, fennec foxes, cheetahs, ostriches, and many other animals.\n\nThe people of Niger are ethnically diverse. The largest group is the Hausa, who make up more than half of the population. The other major groups are the Songhai-Zarma, the Fulani, the Tuareg, and the Kanuri. The official language of Niger is French, but most people use the language of their ethnic group on a daily basis. The majority of Nigeriens are Muslim.\n\nThe Nigerien population is unevenly distributed across the country. A small segment of the population lives in the dry northern regions. Most of these people, including the Tuareg, are nomadic herders. Other people of the north work in mines or live in market towns such as Agadez. The majority of Nigeriens live in the south, where the climate makes farming possible. In this area rapid population growth is a concern. Many people worry that the land will be unable to support such a large population and that drought conditions will make life in the region increasingly difficult.\n\nMost of Niger’s population lives in rural areas. The main city is Niamey, the capital, which is located on the Niger River. The other principal cities are Zinder, Maradi, and Tahoua.\n\nAccording to scientists, humans first began to settle in the region of what is now northern Niger some 600,000 years ago. At the time, the area now covered by the Sahara was lush grassland. Many archaeologists believe that people migrated to areas in southern Niger as the grasslands gradually turned to desert.\n\nIn early times the Songhai and Kanem-Bornu empires controlled southern Niger. The Hausa and the Fulani later ruled. The Tuareg controlled the north. Europeans explored the region in the 1800s. The French made Niger a colony in 1922.\n\nNiger won independence in 1960. Since then the military has taken over the government several times. In the 1990s Tuareg rebels began fighting the government. Niger held its first democratic elections in 1993. Mamadou Tandja was elected in 1999. His leadership was widely credited with bringing political stability to Niger. He was reelected in 2004. Tandja was not allowed to run for reelection again, but he tried to change the constitution. When the legislative and judicial branches did not agree with his changes, he dissolved those branches of government. Tandja’s actions were widely condemned in Niger and internationally. However, Tandja still held an election to determine if he could remain in power for another three years after his second term ended in December 2009. Voters supposedly approved the plan, but in February 2010 he was removed from power by the military. The country returned to civilian rule in 2011.\n\nAround 2011 Islamic terrorist groups became more active in Niger. Boko Haram, a terrorist group based in Nigeria, launched an attack in southern Niger in 2015. Niger and other countries in the region fought back and soon saw progress. However, Niger had the task of providing for tens of thousands of refugees who had fled from Boko Haram in northern Nigeria and had settled in southern Niger."
