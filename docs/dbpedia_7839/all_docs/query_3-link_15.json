        "text": "Not to be confused with Niger State, Nigeria, or nigger.\n\nNiger or the Niger[12][13] ( or ;[14][15] French: [niʒɛʁ]), officially the Republic of the Niger,[12][13] is a country in western Africa. The capital is Niamey, and the official language is French. It is surrounded by Algeria and Libya to the north, Chad to the east, Nigeria and Benin to the south, and Burkina Faso and Mali to the west. Niger is landlocked, meaning it has no coastline. Niger gets its name from the Niger River, whose name possibly comes from the Berber word \"River of Rivers\".[16]\n\nThe Mali Empire and the Songhai Empire both had land in what is now Niger. Later France controlled the land that is now Niger. Niger has a population, or the number of people living in an area, of 15,306,252 and an area of 1,267,000 square kilometres. Much of Niger is desert.\n\nAfter a military coup in 2010, Niger is now a democratic, multi-party state. Most of the people live in rural areas, and have little access to advanced education.\n\nNiger is one of the poorest countries in the world with a lack of contraception. 41.4% live in poverty. Hunger plagues the country.\n\nNiger’s main exports are uranium ore, livestock, cowpeas and onions. Millet and sorghum are grown in the south, as well as cassava and sugarcane. Rice is grown in the Niger River valley. Peanuts are the most important cash crop. Other important crops are cotton and pulses.\n\nNiger is home to the critically endangered addax antelope. West African giraffes are the only giraffes in West Africa that exist in Niger.\n\nNiger is on the border between the Sahara and Sub-Saharan regions. Niger's area is 1,267,000 square kilometres (489,191 sq mi) of which 300 square kilometres (116 sq mi) is water. It is the world's twenty-second largest country. Niger borders seven countries. The longest border is with Nigeria to the south.\n\nThe lowest point is the Niger River, with an elevation of 200 metres (656 ft). The highest point is Mont Idoukal-n-Taghès in the Aïr Mountains at 2,022 m (6,634 ft).\n\nNorthern Niger: Agadez Region\n\nSouth-Central Niger: Maradi Region, Tahoua Region, Zinder Region\n\nSouth-Eastern Niger: Diffa Region, Zinder Region\n\nSouth-Western Niger: Tillabéri Region, Dosso Region, Niamey, Tahoua Region\n\nZinder Region and Tahoua Region are intermediates between Central Niger.\n\nThis table shows cities with a population over 10,000, according to 2001 census.\n\nCity Census division Population\n\n2001[17] Position[18] Abalak Tahoua 12,764 Agadez Agadez 78,289 Aguié Maradi 11,475 Arlit Agadez 69,435 Birni Ngaouré Dosso 10,775 Birni Nkonni Tahoua 44,663 Dakoro Maradi 18,875 Diffa Diffa 23,409 Dogondoutchi Dosso 29,244 Dosso Dosso 43,561 Filingué Tillabéri 11,661 Gaya Dosso 28,385 Gouré Zinder 13,422 Guidan Roumji Maradi 10,744 Illéla Tahoua 15,805 Kollo Tillabéri 10,533 Madaoua Tahoua 22,175 Magaria Zinder 17,776 Maïné-Soroa Diffa 10,176 Maradi Maradi 148,017 Matameye Zinder 17,930 Mirria Zinder 19,161 Nguigmi Diffa 15,922 Niamey Niamey Capital District 707,951 Say Tillabéri 10,502 Tahoua Tahoua 73,002 Tânout Zinder 15,779 Tchirozérine Agadez 10,032 Téra Tillabéri 19,508 Tessaoua Maradi 31,667 Tillabéri Tillabéri 16,683 Zinder Zinder 170,575\n\nNiger's subtropical climate is mainly very hot and dry. Much of it is covered by desert. In the extreme south there is a tropical climate on the edges of the Niger River basin. The land is mostly desert plains and sand dunes. There is flat to rolling savanna in the south and hills in the north.\n\nGazelle\n\nElephants\n\nViolet turaco\n\nBlack-headed lapwing\n\nBlue-naped mousebird\n\nThere are several ethnic groups in Niger:\n\nHausa 53.1%\n\nZarma/Songhai 21.2%\n\nTuareg 11%\n\nFulani (Peuhl) 6.5%\n\nKanuri 5.9%\n\nGurma 0.8%\n\nArab 0.4%\n\nTubu 0.4%\n\nother/unavailable 0.9%\n\nThe literacy rate (the amount of the adult population who can read or write) of Niger is among the lowest in the world. In 2005 it was estimated to be only 28.7% (42.9% male and 15.1% female).[19] Primary education in Niger is required for six years.[20] The primary school enrollment and attendance rates are low, particularly for girls.[20] Children are often made to work rather than attend school. This is particularly true during planting or harvest periods.\n\nList of rivers of Niger\n\nNiger at the Olympics\n\nNiger national football team"
