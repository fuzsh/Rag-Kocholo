        "text": "The Ibibio State Union\n\nIn 1928, the formation and formal inauguration of the Ibibio State Union took place. In 1948, the Union transformed from a mere progressive cultural association to a meaningful national institution, which engaged itself in the propagation and promotion of the noble cause of the creation of states in Nigeria based on the concept of Nigeria as a Federation of States.\n\nThe agitation for the creation of a separate state for minority groups in the former eastern region was heightened in 1953 with the passing of a vote of no confidence on the Eyo Ita government and the subsequent formation of the United National Independence Party (UNIP) made up mainly of the non-Igbo speaking people of the region.\n\nIt was this party as official opposition party in the reconstituted Eastern House of Assembly that first demanded for the creation of the Calabar-Ogoja-River (COR) State for the minority groups of the region. The agitation for state creation later spread to the minority ethnic groups in the country. The increased agitation by various ethnic groups was subsequently discussed at the London Constitutional Conference of 1957 and a case for the creation of State for the minority groups in the country was established.\n\nTrade Route & Missionary Contact\n\nWhat is now Akwa Ibom became a trade route supporting other trading centres, mainly Calabar. This can be observed from the existence of various European trading warehouses.\n\nMost importantly it was a major trade route particular during the era of slave trade (1503 – 1842) and a cradle of European Christian Missionary contact with people in hinterlands (1846 – 1900) at the beginning of the 20th century, seen in the early missionary presence of the Qua Iboe Mission established by Rev. Samuel Bill in 1912 at Ibeno and Etinan, followed by other missions like the Church of Scotland Mission, and the Roman Catholic Missions\n\nOil Rivers Protectorate to Southern Nigeria\n\nAfter the chiefs of Duke Town accepted British protection in 1884, the town, which was called Old Calabar until 1904, served as capital of the Oil Rivers Protectorate (1885–93), the Niger Coast Protectorate (1893–1900), and Southern Nigeria (1900–06). Southern Nigeria’s administration was under Queen Victoria. The Queen was soon succeeded by her son, King Edward VII in 1903 until the British administrative headquarters were moved to Lagos. In 1916 Lord Frederick Luggard promoted indirect rule and unified Southern and Northern Protectorates into one country, Nigeria.\n\nCalabar remained an important port (Shipping ivory, Timber, and Beeswax, as well as Palm produce) until it was eclipsed by Port Harcourt, terminus (1916) of the railroad, 90 miles (145 km) West.\n\nAccessibility Factors\n\nThe completion of roads from Calabar to Arochukwu, Ikom, and Mamfe (in Cameroon) and the Calabar–Itu–Ikot Expene highway (which provides easy access to the rest of Nigeria) has contributed to Calabar’s importance as a port.\n\nCalabar has long been an educational centre. Its first church school established by the Reverend Hope Waddell of the Free Church of Scotland in 1846, helped influence the Ekpe secret society to pass a law (1850) prohibiting human sacrifice.\n\nCommodity trade continued to flourish even with Luggard’s successor, Hugh Clifford (1919-25), who was concerned with introduction of practical benefits of Western experience. Clifford emphasized economic development, encouraging enterprises by immigrant southerners in the north while restricting European participation to capital intensive activity.\n\nWhat is now Cross River state was part of the former Eastern region until 1967, when it became South-Eastern state and renamed Cross River state in 1976.\n\nAgitation for a New State\n\nIn 1967, the struggle for state creation by the Ibibio State Union yielded fruit in the creation of states in Nigeria by the General Yakubu Gowon administration. The South Eastern State of which the present day Akwa Ibom formed a part was one of those states.\n\nDuring the General Murtala Muhammed administration, seven additional states were created in 1976. The South Eastern State was then re-named Cross River State. The change in name, however, did not assuage the agitation of the people. The struggle continued.\n\nAfter the collapse of the 2nd Republic in 1983, a memorandum demanding the creation of Akwa Ibom State was submitted to the General Buhari Military administration by Paramount Rulers from six local government areas of the “Mainland” part of the former Cross River State. Still, nothing happened. When the Political Bureau set up in 1986 by the Federal Military Government called for memoranda from the public on how Nigeria could be governed, the people once again, seized the opportunity to resubmit their memorandum for the creation of Akwa Ibom State.\n\n1987 Creation\n\nOn September 23, 1987 with the promulgation of Degree 24 of that year by the then military President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, the South-western third of Cross River state was created as a new state called Akwa Ibom State. Thus, Akwa Ibom was created by combining the Uyo, Ikot Ekpene, Eket and Abak divisions of old Calabar Province. Consequently, General Babangida appointed Tunde Ogbeha as the first Governor of the state. Tunde Ogbehia ruled the state from 23 Sept., 1987 to 30 July, 1988.\n\nBy all accounts and considerations, the creation of Akwa Ibom State has been a dream come true and the yearnings of people fulfilled. Its people have continued to cherish the euphoria, which greeted that first proclamation. And since then, they have risen to the challenges attendant, upon their new political identity, embarking vigorously on capital projects to ensure a prosperous state and a ‘Land of Promise’ which will serve as a model in Nigeria.\n\nGovernment\n\nThere are 31 Local Government areas in the state with Ikot Ekpene, the oldest local government area in Nigeria created in 1951, as one of them. Others are: Abak, Eket, Ekpe, Atai, Essien Udim, Etinan, Etim Ekpo, Ikono, Ikot Abasi, Ini, Itu, Mbo, Mkpat Enin, Nsit Ibom, Nsit Ubium, Okobo, Onna, Oron, Oruk Anam, Ukanafun, Uquo Ibeno, Uruan, Urue Offong/Oruko, Uyo, Obot Akara, Ibesikpo Asutan, Ibiono Ibom, Eastern Obolo, Udung Uko, Ika, and Ibeno.\n\nAdministrative Structure\n\nAkwa Ibom Government is comprised of three equal and independent branches, the Executive, Legislative and Judiciary. The Executive branch administers the Laws through organs of the executive council, ministries, agencies and Local Government and is overseen by the Government. The Legislative makes law, the responsibility carried out by the 26-member House of Assembly headed by the Speaker. And the Judicial branch headed by the Chief Judge preserves the rule of law by resolving dispute through the court.\n\nThe Executive Branch\n\nThe Executive branch of Akwa Ibom State Government has the Governor, Deputy Government and all Cabinet members. The Governor is allowed to pass or veto a bill that the legislative sends him. His assent is required for all bill passed by the House of Assembly before they can become one.\n\nThe Executive conducts the Government deciding on policy and administering legislation. All-important Government policy decision and Legislative proposals either come from or are agreed to by cabinet. Cabinet also coordinate the activities of Commissioners. Cabinet consist of Commissioner appointed by the Governor. These Commissioners are usually responsible for one or more Government departments supervised by permanent Secretaries.\n\nThe Legislative Branch\n\nAkwa Ibom State legislature has a chamber called the House of Assembly. 26 members are elected by citizens from across the State for the four-year term to represent them. The House responsibilities are to debate about legislations, provide a Government, supervised the Government administration that requires it to explain policies and action, supply funds and represent the views of the people of Akwa Ibom State. It has a number of selected committees, which examines proposed legislation (Bill) in detail, often bearing submission from interested members of the public.\n\nThe Judicial Branch\n\nThe Judiciary explains and applies the laws. This branch does this by hearing and eventually making decisions on various legal cases. The Judicial branch is in charge of the court system. There are three different courts, the Magistrate court, the high court and the court of appeal. Although there are special court for such cases as environmental and revenue matters. Judges are appointed by the Governor. The Judges apply the law to every case that comes before the court. Akwa Ibom State Judiciary is independent and free from political interference.\n\nMinistries\n\nAkwa Ibom State Ministries are Government’s Departments for sectoral service delivery by the Executive branch of the State Government.\n\nMost Ministries are housed in the Idongesit Nkanga’s Secretariat Complex. Each Ministry is headed by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor. The Commissioners work with the permanent Secretaries and directors of the ministries. The Staff of the Ministries are civil service employees headed by the head of Civil Service.\n\nThe Ministries are created to service needs of the citizens such as social, economic and environmental securities.

But officially, English is spoken.\n\nTourist Sites\n\nWhenever Tourism is discussed, the abundant evidence of Tourism potentials of Akwa Ibom State leads to the conclusion that, here is a pleasure and leisure latent pasture. Imagine a community at the bank of the Atlantic Ocean where there is sea-brewed fresh breeze sifted through unpolluted foliage of dense Mangrove forest to savour, or an amazing stretch of over 120 kilometres sand bank that transverses many Riverine Communities, or an ocean shore to cruise at ebb tide and the rhythmical music of the waves, providing tourists with exotic sites.\n\nMuseum and Monument\n\nMuseums, historic sites and monuments dot the entire landscape of Akwa Ibom State. This is evidence of the people’s enormous cultural vitality and capacity for immediate response to facing new challenges. There are Stone Age, Metal-Smelting Sites, Bronze and Terracotta Figurines, Ancient Farming and Fishing Settlements and Sites of Abandoned Village Playgrounds, Sacred Groves and Shrines.\n\nThere are three museums in Akwa Ibom State, which hold the relics of ethnic works of arts and history of the cultural heritage of the people of Akwa Ibom State.

The Portuguese and Aro Slave trading outposts and occasional troves of old manila currency still litter the hinterland of the state.\n\nIn addition to these are; the abandoned landing jetties, prefabricated buildings and warehouses from the flourishing oil palm trade, a mark of the state being an oil-palm heartland which brought economic prosperity and opened the region to civilization. Akwa Ibom state as a land of historical landscapes is evidenced by the various pre-colonial and colonial landscapes and legacies in all parts of the state including slave trade routes, slave warehouses, dungeons and slave master’s lodges.\n\nOron National Museum & Beach\n\nAt the beautiful river bank next to the old trade beach from which land boats carry cargoes from upriver area of the Niger delta coast towards Cross River, Cameroon and Fernando Po stands the Oron Museum, encapsulated by the clear flowing waters of the Oron River.\n\nThe Museum was established by K.C Murray in 1959 as a treasure house for the preservation of several hundred Ekpu Oro (ancestral spirits of Oron), wood carvings believed to be the oldest and finest wooden sculptures in Africa, which were preserved at the decaying ancestral shrines in the town. Apart from the Ekpu carvings, the museum is also the home of unique skin- covered and horned head masks; the powerful Obasi Njom masquerade from upper Cross River area, old manilla currency, water spirit masquerade relics, traditional raffia and metal works, the traditional pottery and provide a visitor with a cultural voyage into the world of creativity.

It is located at the Wellington Bassey Way end of Governor’s Office.\n\nThe Uyo Museum is another tourist site to behold. It is an embodiment of the historic relics of the state. It also contains cultural artefacts and administrative offices used by both the colonial and post-colonial administrators of the state. The museum, which stands on undulating landscape bordered by the captivating ravine presents a beautiful scenery and serenity. Surrounded by greenish courts and lined on either side by whispering pines and fruit trees it presents a monument that is close to nature.\n\nCenotaph of the Women War of 1929\n\nWomen of Ikot Abasi, then a part of Opobo were actively involved in the famous women riot of 1929 over taxation and in protest against colonial rule, which culminated into the Aba Women riot of 1929. It was alleged that the protest was as a result of the new tax regime introduced by colonial officials in the then Eastern Nigeria.\n\nWomen protesting against their inclusion in the head tax mobilized themselves from all parts of the region, some coming in canoes singing and chanting. On landing at the colonial administrative office they started chanting war songs. To quell the riot, the British officials asked the colonial police to open fire on the singing unarmed women, which led to the death of scores of women.\n\nTo commemorate the bravery of these women who stood their ground and died for a just cause, a statue was erected in front of the Ikot Abasi Local Government secretariat, which was then the administrative headquarters of the British colonial government. On every December 16, each year all Akwa Ibom women gather at the sight to commemorate the selfless sacrifice of these women.\n\nThe Slave Dungeons and the Bridge of No Return\n\nAt the bank of the Imo River estuary, a walking distance from the Amalgamation house and colonial offices is a jetty and a bridge designed to enable free movement to and from the river, to enable embankment into boats and canoes. This was the famous Bridge of No Return, a name given to it by the locals. Slaves were walked down this bridge to the canoes for onward movement to the slave ships that lay anchored at the middle of the high sea waiting for their human cargoes for onward journey through the Atlantic Ocean to the vast plantations in Europe and Americas. No slave that walks down the bridge ever returns and this informed the name “Bridge of No Return”.\n\nAlso at this bridge are the slave dungeons made up of containers of cast concrete with two tiny holes at each end to enable occupants receive air. This is where the most stubborn slaves were kept before shipment for the purpose of weakening their resolve. The Dungeons have partitions, so that each cubicle holds one slave. Apart from the dungeons, there are warehouses for goods that were later turned into slave warehouses. This was where the slaves were kept in preparation for their shipment.\n\nAmalgamation House\n\nOff the road from the hall of fame is the house in which Lord Lugard the colonial governor of Northern Nigeria Amalgamated the Northern and Southern Protectorates in 1914, making Nigeria one geographical entity. It was also in this historical edifice, which continues today to serve as an administrative office in Ikot Abasi Local Government, that General Olusegun Obasanjo the commanding officer of the Nigerian Army and General Phillip Effiong in January 1970 signed and declared a cease-fire that brought the Nigerian-Biafran civil war to an end.\n\nOriginally, the building itself belonged to the Royal Niger Company, the merchant traders who were given the Royal Charter to govern Nigeria on behalf of the British crown till 1900. This building served as their administrative headquarters. The building stands on short concrete pillars with brick walls and hardwood. Its corrugated iron roof sheets are still intact to this day.\n\nMary Slessor’s Residence & Office\n\nThe present Government Secondary School at Ikot Obong, Ibiono Local Government Area is a remodelled version of the Old mission school built by Mary Slessor in the late 19th century to cater for the educational needs of the indigent children. The old structures have been combined with new ones but the old walls are as strong as they were built. Within the school premises are the ruins of Mary Slessor’s former office.\n\nThe concrete steps leading to the office and her safe which recently was moved by the Presbyterian Church for safe keeping are still intact. Behind the school premises, one can find the ruins of the house where Mary Slessor lived for many years. Her water tank and the concrete foundations of the house are all that remain of this historical monument, as the house being made of clay has long been destroyed by the elements. It was in this site that Mary Slessor died in 1915, and from where her body was moved to Calabar, the then capital of the region for burial.\n\nOnna Museum\n\nThe museum at Ikot Udo Essang in Onna Local Government Area has personal collections of Cross ethnic works of arts and ethnographic, numismatic, traditional royal regalia of late Chief (Dr.) Clement Nyong Isong, the first Nigerian Central Bank Governor and first Civilian Governor of Cross River State before the creation of Akwa Ibom State which he donated to his State of origin. The museum and monument are available for research, for both youths and adults.\n\nGovernment Hills, Itu\n\nThe “Government Hills” at Itu, Uyo and Abak, which till date retains the feature of 20th century colonial administrative centres complete with the mangos and pear tree that are silent witnesses to the historical events and personalities that shaped the history of the era. This is also reflected in the local street names like Barrack road, hospital road, Brooks street, Liverpool street etc.\n\nLuggard’s House\n\nOpposite the Amalgamation house is the one-storey cottage, where Lord Lugard lived during the amalgamation period. It is said that the site was the first administrative headquarters of the region before it was relocated to Calabar.\n\nApart from the solid structure that is still comparable with modern structures, there were several colonial buildings in this area that served as courts, offices, residential houses and recreational centres. All these facilities are still intact as when they were built. One significant historical fact is that the area is situated at the bank of Imo River estuary, a tributary from where King Jaja of Opobo was shipped into exile.\n\nSlave Master’s Lodge and Warehouse\n\nThe Itu River was a renowned slave trade route and the old jetty still stands. There are a number of old prison-like warehouses where slaves were kept to await shipment via the Itu River. The main lodge was the residence of the white slave merchants who occupied the area. This is a one-story house, much complex and beautifully constructed.\n\nMary Slessor’s Cabin\n\nThis is a monument erected on the site of the home built by Mary Slessor “the white Queen of Okoyong” as a shelter for twins and their mothers, whom she rescued from the evil forest, where they were cast away. The floor of the old house is still intact and there is a long column of steps leading up to the site, which is located on top of the Okoyong Hill.\n\nQua Iboe Church\n\nThe Qua Iboe Church architecture at Atan Offot, Uyo, which still stands in its aesthetic splendour, is a relic representing the missionary zeal of self-supporting efforts of the people. The church was built through the efforts of local workers and contributions made by the people to ensure that evangelization along the Qua Iboe river basin and beyond was accomplished.\n\nRoyal Niger Boot Yard\n\nThe boat yard is found after Lugard’s house, behind the administrative building of the former Royal Niger Company premises. It is a large boar yard, where merchant ships were built and repaired. There exist some old boats and canoes of all sizes in the yard, which is an indication of the extensive businesses carried out in the area in the past.\n\nHall of Fame\n\nThis is another monument built in remembrance of the brave women who were killed in the 1929 women riot at the consular beach, Egwang Opobo now Ikot Abasi and elsewhere in the State. The commemorative marble plaque inside the building contains names of twenty-three women that died at Ikot Abasi; three that died at Etim Ekpo and another thirty-three at Abak. Also listed alongside their names are the names of their towns of origin, which on close examination shows, they came from all over the former Eastern Region and Niger Delta areas.\n\nAbandoned Settlement\n\nThese include old battle grounds at Esuk Odu, Ibiaku Uruan, Ekpene Ukim, Okat and Ikot Ibiok (Eket) and abandoned settlement sites of the obliterate five-mile-radius Ubuim settlement twice burnt down and the 17 destroyed Qua Iboe villages, all bore memory of resistance of the people against colonial rule. Local stories described the battles as unequal, a battle of men and women with bare hands and songs against machine gun of numerous military and punitive expeditions.\n\nWILDLIFE\n\nFor eco-tourists, Akwa Ibom is rich in various species of animal and bird life to make a memorable trip. Watch rare species of African fauna, elephants, leopards, rhino, antelope and different types of monkeys, birds and fishes in their natural habitat at the coastal and inland forest games reserves at Mbo/ Uquo, Ibeno Local Government.\n\nThe area offer amazing opportunities for bird watching, ocean of fresh water fishing, insect collecting and animal husbandry of unusual wool less sheep, small hunch – backed cattle, land snails and a variety of crayfish, prawns, clamps, crabs and lobsters.\n\nA conservation programme is going on here to preserve endangered species of flora and fauna under national and international conservation programmes.\n\nFestival Calendar\n\nEducation\n\nIn Akwa Ibom State, premium is placed on Education as a way of empowering the future generation.

These are:\n\n University of Uyo\n\n Akwa Ibom State University of Technology\n\n Akwa Ibom State Polytechnic\n\n College of Education\n\n Afaha Nsit, Obong University.\n\nEducation at Primary and secondary schools is free and compulsory for the protection of child rights; this has led to increased enrolments. Government also awards scholarships to various levels of students of higher institutions.\n\nThe targeted education strategy involves capacity building and empowerment that moves technology and science-based professionals into vital sectors to meet challenges of a modern economy so as to fight unemployment and assure adequate supply of skilled manpower. Further, these professionals as specialists in their respective fields become able to manage themselves as a business unit or become highly employable.\n\nHealth\n\nAkwa Ibom with a population of 3.9 million and 31 local government areas takes the health of her citizens serious. The state implements a care delivery system through a two-pronged integrated primary health care services and secondary health care strategies. The integrated primary healthcare services are deployed to carry out preventive health care measures, health education, maternal care, infant and child care and immunizations, mass screening social work and environmental and occupational health. On the huge scar HIV/AIDS has left on humanity, the state has deployed an action plan to fight the scourge, by establishing 18 Centres for the prevention of Mother – to- Child HIV/AIDS transmission and 47 HIV/AIDS Testing and Counselling Centres. Free food supplements are disbursed daily for those with the virus.

Free medical services have been introduced for children, pregnant women and senior citizens.\n\nMedia Houses\n\nThe State operates electronic and print media for information dissemination to her growing population. There are TV and radio stations, as well as a newspaper corporation that keeps the people abreast of happenings in and around the state. Government utilises the power of the press to mould opinion and set agenda.\n\nThese media houses conduct a systematic dissemination of entertainment, information, educational programming, announcements of political and social events, as well as public opinion and government agenda. Together, these media houses have become agents for social change between government and the general public.\n\nThese media houses provide locally produced content broadcasting in English and occasionally in Ibibio for the natives. They welcome business enterprise adverts and advertorial.\n\nGovernment champions special programmes through her public enlightenment parastatal, Ethical and Attitudinal Re-orientation Commission (EARCOM). EARCOM seeks to inculcate traditionally treasured values of honesty, integrity, self-esteem, enterprising spirit, respect to self and constituted authorities, sanctity of human life, peaceful coexistence, continence, sexual morality, work ethics, contractual obligation and general responsibilities among citizens. Private enterprises also sponsor a number of programmes towards the service to their customers.\n\nPerforming Arts\n\nAkwa Ibom State has a robust tradition of drama and theatre. The state is richly endowed with a well-articulated and diversified tradition of celebrated rituals, myths, festivals, initiation, masquerading, ceremonies, storytelling, as well as performing arts, songs, poetry, music, dance, mime and puppetry.\n\nCultural Dance\n\nAll dances in Akwa Ibom are generally in harmony with the body and in response to the rhythmic beat of the player(s). They are ritualistic or non- ritualistic. There is the Leap Dance, the Stride Dance and the Close Dance, which is the most outstanding feature of the Akwa Ibom dance. A typical feature of the Close Dance is free movement of the hips only as opposed to the Stride Dance and Leap Dance, where there is a lot of arm and leg movement with occasional somersault with example as in Akombo dance.\n\nEkemini Dance Group\n\nFor the people, drama, theatre and the performing arts are a dynamic part of its worldview and socio- cultural process of identification. Theatrical activities are organized on the basis of age, sex and vocational distinctions. The performances involve participation of every man and woman, young and old and are usually arranged around major cosmic cycles and events in the traditional calendar.\n\nThe Drama and theatre of Akwa Ibom people can be classified into four, namely Ekoon, Ndem, Ikang and Ibok. Each of these drama and theatre performances forms an overlap because of its unique capacity to combine with others.\n\nEkoon Drama\n\nThis is the most diverse, complex and colourful in terms of organisation and dramatic composition. It is an embodiment of the folk and mythological world of the lesser; generally farcical, cosmological forces of the society. The Ekoon dramatic forms are designed to inculcate a sense of ethical and moral discipline and beauty of the society, through dynamic media of creative theatrical entertainment.\n\nThe performers always appear in colourful and sometimes grotesque shapes in form of puppets, masquerades and other carrier images and symbols, representing the archetypical, ethereal world. These include fairies, the genie, the imps and bits and of what obtains in the mythical realm of the universe. The theatrical representation of these archetypes and unearthly forces represent “the grotesque beauty in the cosmos and the laughable weakness in man.\n\nIkaan Drama\n\nIkaan is a dramatic display that alludes to the ancestral spirit world. The Ekpo display is its principal dramatic form. Ekpo is a cultural institution with ultimate political power, especially among traditional Ibibio and Annang communities. In the coastal and riverine areas, the, Ekpe occupies a similar position and discharges similar functions as Ekpo, while the Ekpe is a colourful Ndem performance and dramatic embodiment of earth and water forces and deities. Ekpo on its part is a dramatic and theatrical encapsulation of the legendary and ancestral glories of the society. Ekpo masquerade are believed to be the incarnate bodies and beings of ancestral heroes to whom the different communities pray and make supplications for protection and benevolence.\n\nEkpo masquerades are generally regarded as ‘ghosts. Each ‘ghost’ being a replica of a person who died in this world and has surpassed the transit deformities, diseases, and beauty and natural qualities it carried to the grave. A typical Ekpo wears a black, ugly looking mask, paints his body pitch black using charcoal or soot to cover his head and torso with raffia manes and ferns. He ties a small bell, a sheathed knife and a band of blackened rags around his waist. On each ankle is tied a bunch of rattlers and the entire masquerade looks top heavy and reminiscent of the shape of a lion.\n\nNdem Drama\n\nThe artistic conception of the Ndem is glamorous, mysterious and synaesthesia. This is manifest in the use and display of extravagant costumes, aesthetic and ritual techniques and processes that emphasize the awesome power and mystery of the deities. The use of such symbols serves as a mirror reflection through which the society can gain fleeting glimpses of the inner cosmic, multi-dimensional world of the deities. The costumes are an amalgam of colours with profound esoteric and metaphysical meanings, with white, red, orange, yellow, indigo and gold the most dominant colours.\n\nThe performances in this group include Ekpe, Etambembe and Okud Ama among others. Of these, the Etambembe also known as Okokod in some parts of the state is the most unique. It is associated with the mythical fire-spitting snake or dragon described as Okukubaraka, a ‘great world’ snake believed to hold the secrets and transmutation power of life and death, which can be excised from it only by divine and supernatural assistance. The Etambembe is cylindrical in shape and spiral in design. The masquerade is constructed of several loops that are held together to form a spiral, over, which is draped a long fabric on which the loops are secured, sewn or fastened. The Etambembe performs with violent throes, writhes and twirls and coils in replication of the vibrant body movements of a rattlesnake. It also has the capacity to grow as tall as 45 feet or more, and to shorten itself to as small as two feet or less. Either way Etambembe can coil and roll on the ground like a snake. The performances are generally associated with coastal and riverine areas of the state, because Ndem is more associated with water spirits and deities than with earth and ancestral forces.\n\nIbok Drama\n\nThe Ibok drama is associated with magical and metaphysical order of the traditional cosmos or universe. The dramatization of the Ibok involves the invocation, use and interplay of magical forces for theatrical entertainment. The principal dramatic form is known as Oko or Nkim Itong in various parts of the state. The dramatization consists mainly of magical demonstration or display of magical feats and skills, such as cutting the different parts of the body with razor-sharp machetes; shooting one another with Dane guns; ‘drinking’ wine from the eye and piercing the stomach or navel with a sharp pointed iron-needle to recover the wine into a cup; it also involves spectacular magical somersaults and acrobatic stunts. The magic in these displays is that the machete for example, gets blunted by the body and cannot cut into the skin. So, is the bullet fired from the Dane gun, which cannot penetrate the skin.\n\nOther dramatic performances like Mboppo, Abang and Asian Uboikpa were dramatizations of such virtues and ideals as vestal innocence, pre-marital chastity, love, devotion, loyalty, humility, respect and industry. A summary of the innate values held sacred by Akwa Ibom people.\n\nMusical Instruments\n\nThe musical instruments used in the state are the same with the ones found in other parts of the country but differs in functionality and social context.\n\nFestivals\n\nAkwa Ibom festivals are frequent and offer opportunities for custodians of culture and customs to showcase their dexterity in supporting the tradition and culture of the people. These festivals are held all year round and in different parts of the state. Festivals of Akwa Ibom people can be classified into four, namely the Agrarian/food-related festivals, vocational/occupational festivals, ancestral/deistic/ceremonial festivals and others.\n\nFolk Songs\n\nAkwa Ibom State uniquely is rich in folk music and dance; symbols play very important roles as they relate to the process of adjusting the individual to the traditional social order in which one is born.\n\nMelodies are most commonly used, but one unique thing about the melodies of Akwa Ibom music is that it is the only part of Nigeria that makes use of three- note-melody (Tritonic scale). The melodies are ritualistic or non- ritualistic. The ritualistic type consists of praises to a particular ancestral god. While the non-ritualistic music is purely for entertainment, here the melodies become more improvisatory and humorous.\n\nIt is normally played in social celebrations, such as a marriage feasts, birth of a new baby or elevation in social status. Folk songs are also used as a means of communication through a masquerade. For instance, in the Mboppo, after a girl has been confined for some weeks in Ufok Mboppo (a place where virgins are cared for) up to a period of two months, and taught the rudiments of being a good housewife and mother, among other things, a masquerade visits the girl. If she has not grown fat he robs a charcoal on her. But if she has grown fat, the masquerade rubs her with Ndom Otong (white chalk) and rallies forth to the village square to sing her praises and pour invectives on the unfortunate virgin that did not respond to the Mboppo (fattening) treatment. A masquerade is used for this purpose because no one attacks a masquerade and moreover whatever, he is saying in the song he would not say in spoken language.\n\nOrchestra\n\nThe type of music indigenous to the people is assembled in form of orchestra. Like the folk songs, they are both ritualistic and non-ritualistic. There are orchestras strictly made for masquerades like Ekpo, Ekpe and Obon; as well as those performed at special non- ritualistic social cultural functions.\n\nThese orchestras are symbolic in nature. For example, the orchestra that accompanies the Oko men’s dance group, played at the burial of a prominent old man in the village. The Uta (gourd horn) orchestra is made up of four gourds (Uta horns) named after a mother and three sons – Eka Uta, Akpan Uta, Udo Uta and Etukudo Uta. Among these orchestras the ones that are distinctive to the state are the Uta orchestra played to show belief in a strong family system; the Nyama or Uso orchestra a functional orchestra played in loud tone, when necessary, to prevent a girl on whom clitoridectomy was being performed without any anaesthetic from screaming or making noise, as she is expected to endure the pains in silence as a mark of her readiness to enter the Mboppo fattening room; and the Ekpri Akata performed by young men in the night in a village informing members of the misdeeds in the society. They act as community news vendors, exposing fornicators, murderers and other undesirable behaviours in the society.\n\nMasquerade\n\nFrom the pre-colonial era, Akwa Ibom people used traditional cultural institutions, such as Ekpo and Ekpe to maintain order in the society. These institutions stood out as government of the time. Ekpo is founded on the belief in life after death, and is regarded as the soul or ghosts of ancestors that return to the land of the living in masquerade form to participate with their kinsmen in communal festivals such as farming and rite of passage.\n\nAs a male secret society, membership is strictly by initiations; hence, every aspect of Ekpo is designed to strike awe, fear and caution among women and non-initiates. The music is mortal by rhythms, the varying tones and pitches of drums arranged closely together could be mistaken by an unfamiliar ear for the sound of a battle. In the pre-colonial era, Ekpe served as the government of the people, performing such functions as judicial, administrative and religious duties. Based on the concept of the leopard being the king, Ekpe therefore performs the roles of government.\n\nVisitors and researchers will be amazed at the stories of the powers and exploits of these masquerades in the enforcement of social norms and discipline. Today, although the functions of Ekpo and Ekpe masquerades as instrument of government have been overtaken by modernity, the ritualistic and to a large extent, the entertainment function is still very relevant to the people. Other masquerades whose stories will equally amaze and confound visitors are Obon, Atat, Utue-ekpe (spider) Ubom Isong (land canoe), Ntok Odio-Odio, Obio Okpo etc. These sets of masquerades make Akwa Ibom State proud during carnivals and festivals both within and outside the state.\n\nTraditional Games\n\nAkwa Ibom traditional games are a reflection of traditional and cultural history, societal role, and norms of the people. Apart from their recreational aims, Akwa Ibom traditional games seek to inculcate good moral values, resilience in the face of strong opposition, honesty, respect for superiors, skills and production of socially fit and well-mannered citizens. Above all, since these games are played in participation of large audiences, they afford the opportunity for family, village and communal contract.\n\nEfak\n\nTwo or more children on moulded sand play Efak. Efak, a ring-like object of about six centimetres in diameter made from Piassava or broomstick is inserted into the sand mould. The players take their turns in clockwise succession to bring out the hidden object using either sticks or their forefingers. Whoever succeeds in bringing out the Efak is the winner. However, if finally, all the players are unable to find the Efak including the caster, the caster becomes the looser.\n\nNsa Isong\n\nThis is a traditional game that is also known and practiced internationally. In general, since these games are played with the participation of a large audience, they afford the opportunity for family, village and communal contacts. Indeed, Akwa Ibom State has a lot to offer the world in entertainment, cuisines, arts, craft, traditional games, festivals and historical sites of tourist interest.\n\nUko\n\nUko is a children and youth game involving two or more pebbles or shelled palm kernels that are cast on the floor. Each player in turn selects his or her Obong (KING), starts by throwing Obong into the air ensuring that he picks the Ndito Nsa (pawns) from the floor to catch the king before the king drops on the ground. It is repeated by picking the pawns in twos, threes, etc. The game is lost when the king falls on the ground before completion of a turn or the player is unable to pick all the pawns at a given turn.\n\nNyod\n\nNyod, is basically a marksmanship game by both adults and children of both sexes though it is only popular with children today. Nyod is played by two players each with four Nyods, that is the seed of Nyod; or each player uses the seed of rubber as a set of pawns. A common Obong (king) is used in turns to dismantle the opponents’ king. Thereafter the pawns are targeted individually or collectively. The loser is the player who losses all his pawns to the opponents strikes.\n\nMkpoketo\n\nMkpoketo is a game of concentration and cooperation. Children play it. Four or more children sit in a circular formation in the open. The starter player keeps all the Eto (sticks of about 15 centimetres long) that are of the same number with the players. The song of Mkpoketo is raided. The starter releases the stick in consonance with the rhythm of the song. In the process of the merry-go-round, whenever a player’s hand cadence galls out of rhythm with the song, two or more Eto (Sticks) will lie before him and he is eliminated. One stock is then taken out. The elimination process continues until the winner emerges.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nThe State Transport Company (AKTC) provides transport services to members of the Public. These services are complemented by the Local Government Mass Transit Programme and Private transporters. The Calabar and Port Harcourt seaports in Cross River and Rivers States respectively, as well as Oron, Ifiayong and Ikot Abasi beaches in Akwa Ibom provide access by sea.\n\nThe Mobil Air-strip at Eket, the Calabar and Port Harcourt International Airports also provide air services to the State.\n\nThe construction of Ibom International Airport has reached an advanced stage. The Akwa Ibom International Airport, occupying 2,453 hectares is located within the three local Government areas of Uruan, Okobo and Nsit Atai. It is designed to have a capacity for handling Boeing 747 aircraft, currently the world’s largest Jet-liner. The three main components of the airport are:\n\nAircraft Maintenance, Repairs and Overhaul (MRO)\n\nCargo Operation\n\nPassenger Operation\n\nUltra-Modern Motor Parks\n\nWith booming commercial activities in the State, the government is said to have developed four ultra- modern motor parks in Uyo, the State capital to facilitate easy movement of goods and services. These parks are located at Itam, Mbiabong, Olusegun Obasanjo Way, near Federal Secretariat and Aka-Nung-Udoe Road, near Champion Breweries Plc.\n\nFurther, government has proposed Uyo-Port Harcourt railway line to ease the movement of goods and persons in the region. Government is building the Ibaka seaport that will rival other seaports in the country and place the state on the regional map of West Africa. NDEBUMOG is unable to carry out evaluation and infrastructural evaluation concerning this proposed Sea Port, as virtually all the information here about the history, government, tourism, population, etc. came from the government sources.\n\nARTS AND CRAFT\n\nVisual Art\n\nAmongst the better-known traditional arts of Africa are those of Akwa Ibom State. This is evident in the archaeological findings of anthropologists. Raffia and cane craft have developed in the State to the extent that Ikot Ekpene, the main cluster of raffia craft in the town is known as the ‘Raffia City’. While in Ikot Andem Itam in Itu, cane craft is more of a passion than an art.\n\nTo this end, arts and crafts occupy a vintage place in the culture of the people. It remains a pride as one of the cultural endowments of the State. Akwa Ibom is one of the best-known traditional arts and craft making parts of the African continent. This is expressed in its indigenous works of art and its rich amalgam of artists like Ekpo Eyo (1977) of the Ibibio Mask and Oron Ekpu fame, Akpan the sculptor of world acclaim among others. It is a thing of interest that majority of the art carvings and masks were designed and produced by the people of Annang sub-linguistic group found around Ikot Ekpene area of the State.\n\nCraft Making\n\nAkwa Ibom is known all over the country and beyond for her captivating works of art, of which craft making is at the fore-front. These crafts are products of natural and man-made plants found in Akwa Ibom State. Among these crafts are Dolls, toys, ritual objects and puppets. Bamboo from raffia palm is cut and marked to represent dolls for female children to play with. At the developed level, the soft wood Ukpo is delicately carved into ritual objects used by female fertility cults, which are often beautifully painted with white clay, earth colours and enamels. Dolls are used in sacrificial rites for childbirth and to appease ‘Eka Abasi’ to lay her hands off a sick baby.\n\nRafia Craft\n\nRaffia craft is another work of art that has made the state a household name. Raffia belts, hats, shoes and hand bags are the products. Other raffia products include Lawyers Wigs, toys and furnishings (including car furnishing).\n\nThe fibres are extracted from raffia palm fronds, which could be dyed as may be desired. The weaving is manually done by the use of a simple loom. The local weavers demonstrate a great skill in the execution of a wide variety of woven design motifs. Ikot Ekpene town is the main centre of the craft trade; this explains the pseudonym of Ikot Ekpene as “Raffia City”.\n\nPottery\n\nPottery is an art practiced by women in many parts of the state. The most outstanding centres are; Itak and Mbiafin villages in Ini Local Government Area, Etinam, Ikot Ebom Itam, Ekpene Ukim, Etoi and Ikot Uboh in Nsit Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe combined production of the cottage industry alongside traditional pottery results in a wide range of wares such as clay pots for cooking, musical drum pots, and tablewares. Ornamental flowerpots and planters, tea sets, drinking mugs and lamp stands are all product of the craft.\n\nBasketry\n\nThis is another craft widely practiced in the State. The baskets come in different shapes and sizes depending on the intended function. There are baskets for storage, baskets for the kitchen use and baskets for packaging and transportation of goods.\n\nCane Craft\n\nThese are also indigenous to the state, with majority of the producers found in Ikot Andem Itam in Itu Local Government Area of the state. Among the range of cane crafted furniture produced by the people are settees, garden chairs, bar stools, room dividers, babies’ cots and beds.\n\nSmitten & Metal Crafts\n\nIn Akwa Ibom State, there abound many tinkers and metal workers. Around Ikot Ekpene are the brass designers who turn-out ornamental swords, ceremonial staffs and candle stands. Other metal workers are engaged in the production of metal boxes, pan pots, hoes, machetes and chisels. Other metal works include beds, metal furniture, gates and designed railings.\n\nWeaving\n\nCloth weaving in traditional society is limited to the production of strips of Ekpang, a strip of thick cotton fabric woven on a simple loom. Less common is the production of crowns, Ntinya strictly produced on order as the crowns can only be worn by selected chiefs. There are several weaving centres in Uyo, Abak, Eket, and Ikot Ekpene areas.\n\nCosmetics\n\nThe most common body decoration in Akwa Ibom traditional society is Okukin and Udohaya body decoration techniques. In the Okukin approach, a black indelible ink is used to draw design motifs on the desired part of the body. In the Udohaya type, a deep penetrating brown dye in paste form, made from roots and herbs is used. When eventually the paste is washed off, the dye leaves a dark stain that could last for as long as three years before fading completely.\n\nTattooing, which produces a permanent effect is also in practice. However, in recent times the practice is being replaced by more temporary body decoration with the use of white clay, cam-wood and red oxide to mark and draw motifs on the body. This decoration is seen among traditional dancers especially maidens.\n\nGrotesque Mask\n\nThe Grotesque masks on their parts were sacred symbols reserved for dangerous ancestral spirit masquerades. Among such masks are the Ekpo and Nyoho.\n\nThe masks show a distinctive feature compared to the Beautiful masks, as they are designed to instil fear in the minds of spectators. They are usually, made from finished mat and in Lamp-black colour. Their macabre nature is often intensified by the use of attachments of animal and human skulls, horns, miniature coffins and spirit dolls.\n\nOn the mask, one finds traces of sacrificial matter such as caked blood from previous sacrifices. Ekpo is such a mask and bears an ominous and mysterious Idiong ring on the head. A double Idiong ring on the head of the Ekpo indicates membership of the highest rank of the highly revered Idiong divination cult. In addition to the physical features, the forms employed by the grotesque mask, portray various animal and human imagery, with flapping jaws, the diseased gangosa, bulging eyes, grimacing facial features and general aggressive countenance. The grotesque mask presents an insight into the dangerous abode of the ancestral spirit world among the people and this explains the reverence given to it. Another popular grotesque mask among Akwa Ibom people is the Ekpu Oron.\n\nThe Ekpu Oron mask is popular among the Oron and to some extent Eket peoples of the state. The Ekpu is a revered ancestral worship expressed in the carving of spectacular wooden statues to honour the dead. A long-braided beard indicates age; Ekere, a traditional war gong in the hand meant that the ancestor was a hero-ama obio Ekong; if he was seated on top of other people, it showed that he had slaves; a top hat showed he had wealth and a strong phallus told of his many wives and children. Looking at the Ekpu statues, one is given an insight into a biographical profile of the dead ancestor.\n\nFuneral Art\n\nThis is a tradition embedded in the culture of Akwa Ibom people. It is meant to express the people’s belief that death is a continuation of life rather than an end. The expression Ekpo Akpa Ayin, Ikpaha utong, presupposes that the dead hears and could therefore intervene in matters of the living. This explains the belief system to provide for the dead.\n\nThe traditional funerary abode Nwommo was erected as a necessity for the dead. For men, the structure was usually erected with the use of Okono poles and a framework of bamboo, over which roofing mats were decked. The roof was often pitched. Decorated cloth was draped across the open front of the Nwommo.\n\nThe female version was often built with earth walls and had a steeply sloping roof. Though too tiny for any normal living being, the symbolic dwelling of the dead was often heavily decorated and decked out with household utensils for the comfortable living of the dead in the afterlife. To avoid theft, some of these utensils had to be deliberately damaged to render them useless to normal human use. The impressive aspect of the Nwommo hut was the lavish decoration. The walls were often painted using white and coloured clay, charcoal, and green from the awa plant. Red, obtained from cam-wood and red oxide was also used. Similarly, blue from local indigo dye and later, washer man’s blue was used. The motifs, included abstract geometric patterns, semi-abstract figures and symbols.\n\nBeautiful Mask\n\nThe Beautiful Mask is worn on variety of occasions and functions. It could be worn by masquerades like Udo Obot Eyen. Such benevolent spirit masquerades are usually staged by young pre-teenage boys who dance around the village from compound to compound, asking for the gods’ blessings and bestowment of fertility on the village womenfolk, who in turn offer gifts to the masquerade. Beautiful masks are also worn by play masquerades or clowns for entertainment.\n\nTo distinguish these masquerades from the Grotesque type, they are designed and painted with white clay and other earthly colours, their hair styles are coloured black to give off natural hair outlook. The facial features retain what could be presumed to be human faces; it bears a distant spiritual and pious countenance. The mask neither wears a smiling nor grimacing outlook.\n\nGEOGRAPHY & LOCATION\n\nWedged between Cross River, Abia and Rivers on the Sandy Coastal Plain of the Gulf of Guinea, Akwa Ibom State is bordered on the South by the Atlantic Ocean, which stretches for 129KM from Ikot Abasi to Oron.\n\nRelief\n\nThe physical relief of the State is basically flat. There are in some areas, Valleys, Creeks and Swamps due to the influence of the Atlantic Ocean, the Qua Iboe and the Cross Rivers, which traverse the length and the breadth of the State. The State has basically two distinct seasons: the rainy season lasts from May to October, while the duration of the dry season is November to April. However, in the Coastal areas, rain falls almost all year round. The Harmattan, accompanied by the North-East wind occurs in December and early January.\n\nTopography\n\nThe landscape of Akwa Ibom State is mostly flat. This is because the underlying geology of the State is predominantly Coastal Plain Sediments. The Coastal nature of the State makes it the natural deposit of mosaic of marine Deltaic, Estuarine, Lagoonal and Fluvio-Lacustrine material.\n\nAround Itu and Ibiono Ibom Local Government Area Councils, the topography of the land is undulating with some areas as high as 200 feet above Sea Level, while there are in some areas Valleys, Marshes, Ravines and Swamps due to influence of the Atlantic Ocean, Qua Iboe, Imo and the Cross Rivers. On the basis of terrain and landform types, the State has five major physiographic regions as indicated below\n\nVegetation\n\nThe Climate of the State allows for favourable cultivation and distraction of Agricultural and Forest Products, such as: Palm Produce, Rubber, Cocoa, Rice, Cassava, Yam and Plantain, Banana, Maize and Timber. There are basically 2 types of Agriculture in Akwa Ibom. The first is the small-scale peasant farming, usually practised on family basis, and which produces food crops, such as Cassava, Maize, Rice, Yam and Cocoyam for family consumption with the surplus sold in the local market. The second type of farming is the Estate Farming, which specialises in growing cash crops such as Rubbers, Cocoa, Rice and Oil Palm.\n\nClimate\n\nThe location of Akwa Ibom State, just North of the Equator and within the humid tropics and its proximity to the Sea, makes the State generally humid. On the basis of its geographical location, the climate of Akwa Ibom can be described as A Tropical Rainy Type, which experiences abundant rainfall with very high temperature. The annual mean temperature of the State lies between 260C and 290C and average sunshine cumulates to 1450Hours per year, while mean annual rainfall ranges from 2,000MM to 3,000MM, depending on the area. Naturally, maximum humidity is recorded in July, while the minimum occurs in January. Thick cloud cumulonimbus type is commonly experience in the month of March to November. Evaporation is high with annual values that range from 1,500MM to 1,800MM.\n\nAs with every Nigerian Coastal areas, the State experiences two main seasons, the wet and dry season. The wet or rainy season lasts between 8-9 Months starting from mid-march to the end of the November. The dry season has a short duration of between the last week of November or early December and last till early March.\n\nDespite the seasonal variation, by the nature and location of the State along the coast, which exposes it to hot Maritime Air Mass, rainfall is expected every month of the year.\n\nLocation\n\nAkwa Ibom’s 6900Sq. Km land area is located between Cross River, Abia, and Rivers on the Sandy Coastal Plain of the Gulf of Guinea. It is bordered on the South by the Atlantic Ocean, which stretches from Ikot Abasi to Oron; a sprawling volume of water seemingly kissing the skyline from flank to flank.\n\nAkwa Ibom lies between Latitude 40 32i and 50 53i north; and Longitude 70 25i and 80 25i East in terms of structural makeup. Akwa Ibom is triangular in shape and covers a total land area of 8,412Km2, encompassing the Qua Iboe River Basin, the Western Part of the lower Cross River Basin and the Eastern Part of the Imo River Basin. With an Ocean front which spans a distance of 129km from Ikot Abasi in the West to Oron in the East, Akwa Ibom present a picture of a captivating coastal, mangrove and beautiful sandy beach resorts.\n\nPEOPLE, POPULATION AND SETTLEMENT\n\nEthnic\n\nAkwa Ibom State enjoys a relatively homogenous ethnicity with the inhabiting ethnic groups of; Ibibio, Annang, Oron, Ibeno, and Eket. The Ibibio are the largest group, followed by the Annang. Language similarities exist among the ethnic groups and they readily express similar customs.\n\nIt is believed that a common heritage exists among the various ethnic groups, hence the prevalence of customary solidarity among them.\n\nThe similarities in language, music, values, art, styles, literature, family life, religion, ritual, food, naming, public life, and material culture is evidence of the historical fact that the people have pursued a common social, cultural, political, and economic relationships.\n\nSocietal Structure\n\nOver the years and armed with the intrinsic philosophy of promoting constructive societies and the ideology of self- determination, Akwa Ibom ethnic groups have collectively metamorphosed into a fraternally beneficial society, that operates at many levels; within the state, nationally and globally. These societies started as Ibibio State Union formed in 1928, even before Akwa Ibom was created. Akwa Ibom indigenes have also excelled in various leadership and developmental engagements globally to the pride of the State.\n\nGenerally, these benefit society, promote the ideal of service as the basis of enterprise, and encourage high ethical standards in business and the professions, good citizenship, good government.\n\nEthnic Stability\n\nFurther on this, with heavy “free borrowing” and modernisation of cultural elements through western influence, there has never been reported strife among the people and the common denominator of cultures and ethnicity remain intact. This is due to the fact that Akwa Ibom ethnic groups support pluralism, which generally makes for a combination of toleration and interdependence, as well as a tradition that expunges separatism and cultures that promote interdependence.\n\nEthnic stability of the Akwa Ibom people has made it possible for citizens of neighbouring states to voluntarily relocate and adopt its language and cultural practices and enjoy the serenity of the state. Ethnic strife is further made difficult as the various ethnic groups at one time or the other have been co-operators in education or infrastructure development and therefore are co-owners of these resources, according to government.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe people of Akwa Ibom State are blessed with language similarities. Even with minor dialectical differences, there are still some common denominators in all languages spoken.\n\nAkwa Ibom language is expressive of feelings. The people of the hinterland speak Ibibio or Annang and they generally understand themselves, while those in the coastal areas speak Oron, Ibeno, and Ekit. The people, being moulded by a shared vision and a common ancestry, share so much in common for collective good. At functions, local languages are freely spoken and such gatherings are cheered with shouts of “Akwa Ibom Isongo” by anyone having an opportunity to address the people, meaning people of Akwa Ibom State is strong. This awakens the spirit of oneness among the people. However, cultural modernisation has promoted English as the official language spoken in government circles and in public functions. There are 20 Languages spoken as first languages in Akwa Ibom State. The major languages are Annang, Ibibio and Oro. The other languages are minority languages. It goes thus:\n\nAnaang\n\nIkot Ekpene, Essien-Udim, Abak, Ukanafun, and Oruk-Anam LGA’s\n\nEbughu\n\nMbo and Oron LGA’s\n\nEfai\n\nMbo LGA\n\nEkit\n\nUquo Ibeno and Eket LGA’s\n\nEnwang\n\nMbo LGA\n\nEtebi\n\nUquo Ibeno LGA\n\nIbibio\n\nItu, Uyo, Etinan, Ikot Abasi, Ikono, Ekpe-Atai, Uruan, Onna, Nsit-Ubium, and Mkpat Enin LGA’s.\n\nIbino\n\nUquo-Ibeno LGA\n\nIbuoro\n\nItu and Ikono LGA’s\n\nIdere\n\nItu LGA\n\nIgbo\n\nIka LGA\n\nIka\n\nIka LGA\n\nIko\n\nIkot Abasi LGA\n\nIlue\n\nOron LGA\n\nItu Mbon Uzo\n\nIkono and Itu LGAs\n\nNkari\n\nIkono LGA\n\nObolo\n\nIkot Abasi LGA\n\nOkobo\n\nOkobo LGA\n\nOro\n\nOron LGA\n\nUda\n\nMbo LGA\n\nReligion\n\nThe Akwa Ibom people being migrants have passed through challenges and experiences in their sojourning; with the people tending to recognise that, which is awesome, appealing, attractive and commanding hospitality, admiration and reverence. The exposure of traditional indigenous religion to western culture has given way to acculturation. Traditional religion of Akwa Ibom people, have not been a documented practice, though traditional religious sagacious influence has waned; the dynamics do not impose one religion over another on citizens.\n\nThe people believe in monotheism, their sense of worship is to one God. Typically, it is a common belief that, reality is not restricted to sense experience alone. The people are generally free to belong to any religion to which they share a common belief with its leader. Hence, many Akwa Ibomites, from their days of migration, openly welcomed Christianity from its inception in Calabar.\n\nThey have used the platform of religion to ethnically close divides amongst themselves by ending some forms of taboos, which were against the interest of the people and practices, such as human sacrifice.\n\nPresently in the Akwa Ibom State, the major religions are Christianity, with many churches like the Roman Catholic Church, and Protestants being accepted. Pentecostalism has also penetrated many members of these orthodox churches, as they seek deeper experiences.\n\nTraditional religion places of worship have also become museum of monuments, as the lineage of leaders and worshippers have abandoned most of these institutions for want of successors. Most surviving traditional religion shrines are at their verge of going underground as people have moved and sometimes consider the shrines, its leaders and worshippers as derelicts.\n\nYet in some traditional functions, such as traditional marriages, some family meetings, and community functions, libation is poured for the spirit of the ancestors. Also in public addresses, reference is sometimes made to ancestral spirits. These signify that with some people of Akwa Ibom, there is still a form of somewhat less significant traditional paganistic worshipers. However, individuals often regard participation in such gatherings as religiously optional and most times do not participate in such worship, where it conflicts with their tenets.\n\nCulture\n\nThe Akwa Ibom indigenes having been known to be a mobile society have practiced social emancipation towards greater expansion as well as security and continuity of life at one time or the other in response to their environment, social order, and acceptable lifestyle of the day. They are a people whose culture can be identified with their language, ideas, beliefs, customs, codes, traditional institutions, tools, techniques and works of art, rituals and ceremonies.\n\nIntrinsic behaviours are bottled up and abolished through the use of taboos and stigmatisation. Learned and freely variable behaviours are transmitted from parents to children and from generation to generation. Frequently, learned behaviours are showcased in cultural events, such as traditional marriages, Obong Coronation, market trading, daily lifestyles, or even the more recent, churches-based events and festivals.\n\nGiven the importance of culture and the way of life of a people as expressed in the economic, social, technological and political institutions, like other Nigerian people, Akwa Ibom people documented their experiences through oral traditions.\n\nThe preservation of their history was very important to the people, being the vital link between their present and their past. This has assisted the different groups to define their identity and transmit same to their children. Thus, codification, preservation and transmission of these traditions occur at different levels of the society- at family, lineage, and villages and at clan levels.\n\nThe homogenous nature of the people is accountable for the minor difference in our traditions and customs, including all other aspects of cultural life. Little or no difference exists in our dances, songs, myths, shrines, funerals, folklore, mode of dressing, foods, cults, festivals and monuments We are noted for wood carving, sculpture, pottery and most importantly cane and raffia works. Ikot Ekpene is recognised internationally for its raffia products hence the term RAFFIA CITY.\n\nAkwa Ibom State is a home of culture. Their rich homogenous nature is expressed in their cultural outlook. To this end, Akwa Ibom people have four distinct cultural characteristics that affect and direct their behavioural model. Such include the following; Pre-occupation with the supernatural; Concern for good morals; Rebellion against injustice and belief in a strong family system. These four characteristics influence their music and dance. Therefore, when music and dance is talked about, in reality, it is interwoven as instruments of social control.\n\nTherefore, in order to understand the cultural and social role of the music of Akwa Ibom people, four major elements of their music become imperative, namely; the Folk songs, musical instruments, orchestras and dances.\n\nCuisine\n\nAkwa Ibom is well known nationally for its exciting and rich culture. It is highly gifted in culinary culture as the people are reputed for its salivating variety of standard cuisines. An Akwa Ibom cuisine lures and tours the world. In fact, the culinary culture is exported around the world. Its meals are often described as irresistible and outstanding preference. As the State lies within the tropical rain forest zones, Vegetables, Seafood, and Domestic animals dominate traditional diets, as most of these food items are seasonal for a greater part of the year. The list of salivating dishes in Akwa Ibom culture can be long. The people are versed in using farm produce like Cassava, Maize, Yam, Cocoyam, Vegetables and so on to create a variety of meals to suit various periods of the day and occasion. Thus, the States food preparation skills have resulted in the National Appreciation of some of its dishes.\n\nAkwa Ibom’s cuisine has a distinctive, regional, quality that is rarely equalled. These quality standards are exhibited in the preparation of the meal, the comprising ingredient and the made of presentation.\n\nPopulation\n\nAkwa Ibom is home to over 5 million people, with a density of 466 people per square km and 3% of Nigeria’s combined population of 36 states. Akwa Ibom population is controlled by the dynamics of fertility, mortality, immigration and emigration. Population of Akwa Ibom State is evenly distributed according to the breakdown of the state’s population as tabulated below:\n\nAKWA IBOM STATE 2006 POPULATION BREAKDOWN\n\nS/N\n\nLocal Government Area\n\nPopulation\n\n1.\n\nAbak\n\n139,090\n\n2.\n\nEastern Obolo\n\n60,543\n\n3.\n\nEket\n\n172,557\n\n4.\n\nEsit Ekit\n\n63,701\n\n5.\n\nEssien-Udim\n\n192,668\n\n6.\n\nEtim-Ekpo\n\n105,418\n\n7.\n\nEtinan\n\n169,284\n\n8.\n\nIbeno\n\n75,380\n\n9.\n\nIbesikpo-Asutan\n\n137,101\n\n10.\n\nIbiono-Ibom\n\n189,640\n\n11\n\nIka\n\n72,939\n\n12\n\nIkono\n\n131,904\n\n13\n\nIkot-Abasi\n\n132,023\n\n14\n\nIkot-Ekpene\n\n143,077\n\n15\n\nIni\n\n99,196\n\n16\n\nItu\n\n127,033\n\n17\n\nMbo\n\n104,012\n\n18\n\nMkpat-Enin\n\n178,036\n\n19\n\nNsit Atai\n\n74,595\n\n20\n\nNsit-Ibom\n\n108,611\n\n21\n\nNsit-Ubium\n\n128,231\n\n22\n\nObot-Akara\n\n148,281\n\n23\n\nOkobo\n\n104,057\n\n24\n\nOnna\n\n123,373\n\n25\n\nOron\n\n87,461\n\n26\n\nOruk Anam\n\n172,654\n\n27\n\nUdung-Uko\n\n53,278\n\n28\n\nUkanafun\n\n127,033\n\n29\n\nUrue Offong\n\n71,159\n\n30\n\nUruan\n\n118,300\n\n31\n\nUyo\n\n309,573\n\nTOTAL\n\n3,920,208\n\nThere are vast areas of permanent swamps along the Enyong Creek and the coastal areas of Eket, Mbo and Oron, which are either very sparsely populated or totally uninhabited. There are swampy areas, unsuitable for settlement in the lower Cross River State Valley in Ibiono, ltu and Uruan LGAs. About 60% of the population is agrarian and related employs, 25% is commercial oriented, while the remaining 15% constitute the civil and public sector.\n\nImmigration\n\nImmigration for occupational purposes moves a large population of working-class indigenes to superior urban areas outside the state and country. Many hotels in the country crave the services of Akwa Ibom cuisines and crave the services of the natives for this purpose. Top federal civil servants make the state their permanent (occupancy) residence, where they establish and support their families, some leaving their children behind in view of the conducive environment, even as themselves migrate to other places for official purposes, going home finally on retirement.\n\nA lot of Akwa Ibom youths travel outside the country for advanced studies and do not return to the state at completion of their studies but enjoy the higher earning power in hard currencies, which they transfer home frequently to support their parents.\n\nUrbanisation in Akwa Ibom State has resulted in a population shift from rural areas to the urban areas. Apart from Uyo being the capital, there are many other urban areas like Ikot Ekpene and Eket that attract majority of Akwa Ibom’s population to the effect that about one third of the population are in the urban areas.\n\nMortality\n\nAkwa Ibomites are renowned for their good culinary and sanitary habits. They cook good food and live in good environments. The state is experiencing improvements in mortality rates due to the improvement in health conditions, less smoking, less drinking, better nutrition, living and sanitary conditions. Altogether this should improve mortality rates of Akwa Ibomites to 70 years from the present state of 55. With government organised healthcare and disease control programmes, there is bound to be lower mortality in Akwa Ibom State.\n\nFertility\n\nWomen fertility in Akwa Ibom State is lower than their biological potential. Constrain by limiting childbirth to married couples, who in turn mutually limit childbirth to resource availability.\n\nMoral restraint of social behaviour of the Akwa Ibom people, where child upbringing between both parents and promotion of monogamy against polygamy means that most women do not begin childbearing upon reaching puberty, even with such potential, most women of Akwa Ibom State are first engaged in education or getting gainfully employed. When eventually a couple comes around to commence childbearing, they may both be gainfully employed and have to align childbearing with occupational challenges. Even when such women become widowed, they do not remarry as they have to maintain their jobs to support their single parent nuclear family. Time was when women education used to end at secondary or high school education. With the establishment of higher institutions in the state, the implication is that more women will move on to graduate level or even post graduate before marriage.\n\nDemographic Trends\n\nAccording to the State Government, there are no plagues, epidemics and other catastrophes that limit Akwa Ibom population. Rather, various government health programmes in place, added to improved transport and communication are lowering the state’s mortality rate. Coming from a previous perspective of high fertility and high mortality rates, when the state used to be more rural under the former enlarged Cross River State, these changes mean that with declining mortality rates, unaccompanied by a reduction in fertility, the population is bound to explode.\n\nThis also means that acculturation is taking its toll on the population, as the combined forces of tradition, religion, education and marriage, do not appear to check the rapid population growth.\n\nNATURAL RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe natural resource potentials of the state yield a wide variety of agricultural and industrial mineral products, from which raw materials can be sourced locally. For example, the oil palm serves as the source of raw materials for palm oil and palm kernel oil. In addition, the extensive forest plantations in nearby Cross River State provide a source of raw materials for the establishment of the Oku Iboku Paper Mill Industry, as well as other Smaller Paper Mills established in the State.\n\nThe state has proven deposits of gold and silver nitrite. These are precious metals useful in the production of jewelry.\n\nOil and Gas Resources\n\nThere are large deposits of oil and gas both on and offshore. Plus, other mineral sources, such as Limestone, Clay, Gold, Salt, Coal, Silver Nitrate and Glass Sand.\n\nCrude Oil in the Niger Delta was first discovered at Ikot Akata, in what is now Akwa Ibom State during the early fifties, following exploration for Petroleum, which began in Nigeria in 1937. Commercial discovery was, however, made at Olobiri in what is now Bayelsa State, with production beginning in 1958. In Akwa Ibom, offshore production of Crude Oil, Condensate and Gas by Mobil Petroleum Nigeria Limited, now Exxon/ Mobil, has elevated the state to being the largest petroleum producer in Nigeria. The Qua Iboe Terminal (QIT) on the Akwa Ibom seashore coast is one of the largest production facilities in the Niger Delta.\n\nOther oil-producing companies operating offshore in Akwa Ibom State are Elf and Addax.\n\nAgriculture\n\nThe climate of the state allows for favorable cultivation and extraction of agricultural and forest products, such as Palm Produce, Rubber, Cocoa, Rice, Cassava, Yam, Plantain, Banana, Maize and Timber.\n\nGiven the nature of the environment, past employment and productivity, there is no doubt that agriculture holds the future prospects for development and employment in AKS. At the moment, agriculture is the most important economic activity in the State and contributes by large percentage to the state’s income, which is second only to petroleum.\n\nThere are basically two types of agriculture in Akwa Ibom. The first is the small-scale peasant farming usually practiced on family basis, and which produces food crops, such as cassava, maize, rice, yam and cocoyam for family consumption with the surplus sold in the local markets. The second type of farming is the estate farming, which specializes in growing cash crops, such as Rubber, Cocoa, Rice and Oil Palm.\n\nForestry\n\nThe state has one of the largest palm forests in Nigeria, which harbors large varieties of wildlife.\n\nAkwa Ibom State supports a wide range of tropical vegetation that guarantees forestry as a viable economic venture. However, the dense human population in the State has profoundly altered the natural vegetation.\n\nExtensive clearing of the land for farming and the exploitation of timber have virtually destroyed much of the original rain forest cover, which is now restricted to a few isolated locations of forest reserves, “juju” shrines and plantations. Other areas designated as “protected forests” are so-called because they are protected against indiscriminate felling of trees and clearing.\n\nThe government has embarked on forest plantations in Eket, Ikono, Oron, Abak, Itu and Ikot Abasi. The need to increase the hectarage of plantations and forest reserves should be stressed. The need for timber is increasing daily, because of the demand for housing, construction and furniture.\n\nThe state is endowed with various mineral resources. It is the third largest producer of Petroleum in Nigeria. Other resources include Limestone, Clay, Natural Gas, Salt, Coal, Silver Nitrate and Glass Sand.\n\nSoil in the state is host to a number of mineral resources that can be commercially exploited. There are both the metallic and non-metallic minerals, which have been fairly distributed across the various local government areas of the State. A number of studies have been undertaken by the Federal Government owned Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC), on their uses and application. These studies are readily available to investors.\n\nLand and Climate\n\nThe 8,412Km Sq that forms Akwa Ibom State is endowed with enormous wealth. The land is arable from the saline water swamp forest in the South, to the rain forest in the Northernmost part- and support extensive Agriculture. A number of cash crops, which can be processed into Primary and Secondary goods, are grown in the State. They include Oil Palm, Rubber, Cocoa, Kola nut, Coconut, Citrus Cassava, Yam, Maize, Rice, Cowpeas, Plantain, Banana, and Pineapple. Akwa Ibom has the highest number of Oil Palm Tree per Capita in Nigeria. A variety of tropical livestock can also be found in the State.\n\nIn terms of Marine Life, its continental shelf and the neighboring estuaries of Cross River, Imo, Qua Iboe and Calabar Rivers are very rich in many varieties of fish and other Seafoods, including Cat fish, Sharks, Barracuda, Sardines, Croakers, Shrimps, Crayfish, Snappers, Bivalves and Oysters.\n\nSkills and Talent\n\nAkwa Ibom State is a colorful blend of people. The multi-cultural affinity of the people provides a unique heritage of accommodation, warmth and understanding. Akwa Ibom people are noted for their friendly attitude. They are industrious, honest, accommodating and single- minded; always driven by a passion to excel. It is a humorous carry over from the long history of interaction with the early explorers, who brought education and Christianity.\n\nAreas for Infrastructure Investment in Akwa Ibom State\n\nHISTORY AND OVERVIEW OF BAYELSA STATE\n\nHistorical Development\n\nAccording to the 1952 Census Report, the ljaws of the Niger Delta region have been recognized as one of the ten major ethnic groups with a population of 0.9 million. During the colonial administration, a separate province was created for them. The amalgamation of Southern and Northern Protectorates in 1914 triggered the fear among minority ethnic groups of political domination; hence their agitation for a distinct state comprising the old Brass, Degema and Western ljaw Divisions, under the umbrella of ljaw National Group, started in earnest. During the colonial period, Britain signed many treaties of protection with the chiefs of many coastal communities, especially the ljaws, with the hope that at Nigeria’s independence in 1960, a nation state would be created for them.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1956, many nationalist movements were formed mainly to establish ljaw political sovereignty. They pressed the issue of separate political sovereignty before the Willink Commission 1958. In order to allay the fears of the ethnic minorities, the Willink Commission recommended the establishment of the Niger Delta Development Board (NDDB) to tackle the problems of underdevelopment of the area, environmental neglect and political domination. Despite the establishment of the Board, the agitation for state creation, based on the above stated problems, continued until the military wrested political power and control of Nigeria from civilians on 15th January 1966.\n\nIn February 1966, Isaac Boro, an ljaw man from Kaiama town in Bayelsa State, with Sam Owonaro, Nottingham Dick and thousands of their supporters unilaterally proclaimed a “Niger Delta Peoples Republic.” But the Federal Government brought the rebellion to a sudden end. On May 27, 1967, the then Rivers State (which was made up the present Rivers and Bayelsa States) was created.\n\nAgitation for a separate State continued among the ljaws and some of the reasons given included: environmental degradation occasioned by oil exploration and exploitation; continued neglect of the economic development of the area, political marginalization et cetera. The area is currently among the least developed in the country, lacking any form of developmental amenity and infrastructure.\n\nAdministrative Areas\n\nAt inception, the state had three local government areas namely Brass, Yenagoa and Sagbama. The name Bayelsa is an acronym formed from the names of the three LGAs. in Bayelsa State operated on eight LGAs, until 28th to December 1999, when additional twenty-four LGAs were created by the first civilian governor of the state. The state has several towns and villages around which an indigenous administrative framework is built and local resources are my mobilized.\n\nAdministrative Structure\n\nThere are three arms of government in Bayelsa State and these include: The Executive Council of the Legislature and The Judiciary. The Executive Council is made up of the Governor, Deputy Governor, Commissioners, Special Advisers and the Secretary to the State Government. The commissioners are the accounting officers for each of the ministries, while the permanent secretaries oversee the daily activities in their ministries.\n\nThe parastatals are special organs of the government charged with the establishment and running of certain key economic areas of the state government. They are supervised by the Deputy Governor. The Governor has Special Advisers on education, special duties, information community affairs, et cetera.\n\nThe Legislature (Bayelsa State House of Assembly) is made up of elected members and it is the law-making body for the state. The Speaker of the House is the chairman in all the proceedings. The Judiciary is the body that interprets the law in the state. It is headed by the state Chief Judge. The second tier of Government in the state is the Local Government.\n\nOn 20th of December 1999, the state was further subdivided into thirty-two LGAs. Each LGA is headed by a chairman, run by the executive and the legislature. The LGA is the grassroots government, being the nearest to the people. Each community of the state has a traditional head while the State Council of Chiefs is headed by the most accepted elderly person. The traditional institutions are hierarchical.\n\nPHYSICAL SETTING\n\nLocation\n\nThe state is geographically located within latitude 4Â°15′ North and latitude 5Â°23′ south. It is also within longitudes 5Â°22′ West and 6Â°45′ East. The state is bounded by Delta State on the north, Rivers State on the east and the Atlantic Ocean on the western and southern parts.\n\nGeology\n\nBayelsa State is located within the lower delta plain believed to have been formed during the Holocene of the quaternary period by the accumulation of sedimentary deposits. The major geological characteristic of the state is sedimentary alluvium. The entire state is formed of abandoned beach ridges and due to many tributaries of the River Niger in this plain, considerable geological changes still abound.\n\nSoils\n\nThe major soil types in the state are young, shallow, poorly drained soils (inceptisol Aquepts) and acid sulphate soils (Sulphaquepts). There are variations in the soils of Bayelsa State; some soil types occupy extensive areas whereas others are of limited extent. However, based on physiographic differences, several soil units could be identified in the state. These include:\n\n The soils of the high-lying levees e.g. sandy loam, loamy sandy, and silty loamy soils as well as sands;\n\n The soils of the low-lying leaves e.g. the moderately fine texture, red silty or clay loamy soils;\n\n The meander belt soils which differ only slightly from the soils of the levels.\n\n The silted river belt soils e.g. peat for clay water bogged soils found mainly in the beds of dead creeks and streams.\n\n The basin soils e.g. silky clay loam or sandy loam which are inundated by water for most of the year;\n\n The transition zone soils e.g. silt and sandy silt which are known to be under the daily influence of tidal floods and fresh waters. There are pockets of potash deficiency especially in the sandy soils. The texture of majority of the soils range from medium to fine grains.\n\nRelief\n\nGenerally, Bayelsa State is a lowland state characterized by tidal flats and coastal beaches, beach ridge barriers and flood plains. The net features such as cliffs and lagoons are the dominant relief features of the state. The fact that the state lies between the upper and lower Delta plain of the Niger Delta suggests a low-lying relief. The broad plain is gentle-sloping. The height or elevation decreases downstream. There are numerous streams of varying volumes and velocities in the united states. These include Rivers Nun, Ekoli, Brass, Koluama, etc.\n\nClimate and Vegetation\n\nRainfall in Bayelsa State varies in quantity from one area to another. The state experiences equatorial type of climate in the southernmost part and tropical rain towards the northern parts. Rain occurs generally every month of the year with heavy downpour.\n\nThe state experiences high rainfall but this decreases from south to north. Akassa town in the state has the highest rainfall record in Nigeria. The climate is tropical i.e. wet and the dry season. The amount of rainfall is adequate for all-year-round crop production. The wet season is not less than 340 days.\n\nThe mean monthly temperature is in the range are of 25°C to 31°C. Mean maximum monthly temperatures range from 26°C to 31°C. The mean annual temperature is uniform for the entire Bayelsa State. The hottest months are December to April. The difference between the wet season and dry season on temperatures is about 2°C at the most. Relative humidity is high in the state throughout the year and decreases slightly in the dry season.\n\nLike any other state in the Niger Delta, the vegetation of Bayelsa State is composed of four ecological zones. These include: coastal barrier island forests, mangrove forests, freshwater swamp e.g. forests and lowland rain forests. These different or vegetation types are associated with the various soil units in the area, and they constitute part of the complex Niger Delta ecosystems. Parts of the fresh water swamp forests in the state constitute the home of several threatened and even endangered plants and animal species.\n\nThere are coastal barrier highland forests and mangrove forests. Coastal barrier highland forest vegetation is restricted to the narrow ridges along the coast. This vegetation belt is characterized by low salinity-tolerant fresh water plants. Sometimes, the Avicinia species of mangroves prevail in this vegetation.\n\nPalms such as phoenix reclivata and other species such as Uapacia, Xylopia and land Taminalia are predominant. In this belt, commercial timber species are found. The mangrove vegetation of the state is usually found between mid-tide relief levels to extreme high-water mark. This vegetation, linked with the brackish swamps, form a maze of water and highlands affected by the ebb and flow of tides.\n\nEcological Problems\n\nBayelsa State is one of the states within the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. This region has been described as “a region of physical handicap which is unlikely ever to be highly developed”. The region is a low-lying plain riddled with an intricate system of water channels through which the Niger finds its way into the sea. The state has very difficult terrain that constrains settlement development or expansion, accessibility to settlement sites and exploitation of natural resources.\n\nHuman activities are largely determined by natural conditions and other ecological opportunities. These hostile ecological conditions limit the occupation of the people to fishing. Bayelsa is a region which already has too much surface water with a high rainfall and long rainy days. This poses considerable problems for human settlement and land use. Almost every part of the state is under water at one time of the year or another. Associated with high rainfall, long rainy days, porous and very sandy soils, is prolonged and disastrous flood. These flooding incidents lead to continual changing of river courses in the state and renders rivers useless as good channels of transportation.\n\nThey also have a tremendous influence on the pattern of human life and economic activities in the state. Highlands are dry throughout the year and can be used as settlement sites and for agricultural practices. Inter-settlement movements in the state have been restricted because of poor road and water transport development. The available roads are those within the towns and villages.\n\nThere is near total absence of inter-town links. The terrain of the state makes the development of land-based transportation difficult requiring the application of modem and costly technologies. Inter-state movement is restricted to water transport which is equally confronted with many problems. Exploitation of forest resources is equally constrained by the terrain of the region. The major ecological problems of the state are thus flooding, coastal erosion and pollution.\n\nPEOPLE, POPULATION AND SETTLEMENT\n\nEthnic Composition, Languages, Culture and the Arts\n\nBayelsa State is dominated by the ljaw ethnic group whose members speak ljaw language. Other ljaw dialects include Tamu, Mein, Jobu, Oyariri, and Tarakiri. There are other pockets of ethnic groups such as Urhobo and Isoko. There are local dialects in some places. Other notable languages in the State are Epie, Atisa, Nembe and Ogbia. Christianity and traditional religion are the two main religions in the State. The culture of the people is expressed in their unique dresses, festivals, dietary habits, arts and crafts, folklore and dancing. These distinguish the people from other ethnic groups. The major crafts include canoe building, fish net and fish traps making, pottery, basket and mat making. Cane furniture industry is thriving in the State.\n\nPopulation Structure and Distribution\n\nAccording to the 1991 Nigerian population census, the total population of Bayelsa State was 1,121,693, distributed among the then eight local government areas. This was made up of 584,117 or 52.1 per cent males and 537,576 or 47.9 per cent females. The geographical constraints imposed by the limited dry land for settlements and agricultural practices, extensive mangrove swamps, excessive rainfall, prolonged and disastrous floods, and creek erosion, among others, underscore the population distribution pattern in the state. People are thinly scattered among “floating” settlements of villages and towns. The population concentration among LGAs ranges from 23.8 per cent in Southern ljaw, 14.2 per cent in Ogbia, through 11.1 per cent at Ekeremor to as low as 9.3 per cent in Yenagoa and 6.0 per cent in Kolokuma/Opukuma LGA . The geographical difficulties of the state and its neglect with respect to infrastructural provision and environmental degradation have limited inter-ethnic migration on a national scale in the State. There are few migrants, mostly raffia palm and oil palm tapers. The creation of Bayelsa State has however opened the state to Yoruba, lgbo and Hausa traders.\n\nURBAN AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND PATTERNS OF HUMAN SETTLEMENT\n\nAs was noted earlier, Bayelsa State is one of the least developed states in Nigeria such that some of the ministries are yet to find adequate accommodation for offices and for housing key staff; no settlement or LGA is served by the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) and only a gas turbine supplies power to parts of Yenagoa; portable water is nowhere available in the state while small-scale industries are to be found in only a few settlements. The low-level of development in the state is traceable to the settlement pattern and ecological constraints. Bayelsa State is a state of numerous villages and rural settlements that are scattered and isolated from each other. Twenty-five per cent of the state population live in “Urban villages” such as Ogbia, Oloibiri, Ogbolomabiri, Bassambiri, Okpuama, Twon-Brass and Nembe. Other important settlements include Yenagoa, Ofoni, Odi, Kaiama, Amassoma, Oporoma, Olugbobiri and Ekeremor.\n\nThe population of each of these towns is above 10,000 and, with the newly created local government areas, all of them have been made local government headquarters. Out of a population of 1,121,493, only 280,280 live in urban centers, hence the very low urbanisation index of 0.25. However, urbanisation index is very high in Nembe (0.47) and Yenagoa (0.43), while it is lowest in southern ljaw (0.17). Settlements are built on patches of dry land, islands and levees.\n\nThe difficult environment makes it impossible to build access roads to link other settlements and thus constrain human economic activities and land use. Almost all the rural settlements are ‘floating hamlets’ i.e. built on mangrove swamps and thus constantly threatened by floods. On the whole, small villages and hamlets predominate in the state and this characteristic poses problems for economic development since urban centers are needed to provide propulsive growth to the neighbouring regions.\n\nBayelsa State is a state of few towns and numerous isolated villages. Out of the sixty towns of 5000 persons and above, only two (Ogbolomabiri and Amassoma) record a population of 20,000 and above. These two settlements may be described as urban in so far as they have populations of 20,000 or more.\n\nBy implication, Bayelsa State is not yet experiencing problems of urban primacy. But it has opportunity to rationally develop regional urban centers of different orders for efficient location /allocation of facilities and amenities that will benefit the cross-section of the state’s population. The non-existence of urban primacy in the state has led to even geographical spread of social facilities such as schools and hospitals among LGAs. Since small towns and villages (or hamlets) dominate the state, the absence of urban centers will no doubt pose problems for efficient economic development.\n\nSOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nThere is linear relationship between infrastructural facility provision and economic development between fifty-two and fifty-eight per cent of all secondary and primary schools in the state. The three LGAs are located in the central half of the state; they are Yenagoa, Southern ljaw and Ogbia.\n\nHealth Facilities\n\nThe state is not adequately served with medical facilities. However, some LGAs such as Yenagoa, Southern ljaw and Ogbi are favorably served with medical facilities.\n\nThe three LGAs control 55.5 per cent, 72.2 per cent 43.8 per cent and 33.3 per cent of the state’s health clinics, maternity centers, primary health centers and hospitals respectively. However, Shell, and other oil prospecting companies have established medical centers to cater for their staff in various locations in the state.\n\nElectricity and Potable Water\n\nElectricity facilities are not sufficiently provided in the State, except, electricity supplied from the National Electricity Power Authority (NEPA). Access to pipe-borne water is limited.\n\nTransport and Communications\n\nThe major modes of transport in the state are waterways and roads. The state has many transport problems that have hindered its economic development for many years.\n\nWater Transport\n\nThe State, like any other state in the Niger Delta, is traversed by a network of River Niger’s distributaries, resulting in widespread swamp land. Water transport is therefore the main means of movement. Speed boat is the characteristic mode of transportation. The efficiency and capacity of speed boats is poor because they do not normally carry goods and they accommodate fewer passengers than out-board engine boats. The slowest means of travel is the out-board engine boat, while t"
