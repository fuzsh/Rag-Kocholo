        "text": "This page provides an overview of the critical characteristics of Niger along its likely (or Current Path) development trajectory. The Current Path forecast from the International Futures forecasting (IFs) platform is a dynamic scenario that imitates continuing current policies and environmental conditions. The Current Path is, therefore, in congruence with historical patterns and produces a series of dynamic forecasts endogenised in relationships across crucial global systems. We use 2019 as a standard reference year, and the estimates generally extend to 2043 to coincide with the end of the third ten-year implementation plan of the African Union’s Agenda 2063 long-term development vision.\n\nThe Republic of Niger, or Niger, is a landlocked country in West Africa named after the Niger River, the country’s only perennial river that is about 550 km long. With a vast land area of almost 1 270 000 km2, it is the second largest landlocked country in West Africa behind Chad, its neighbour to the east. Niger is a unitary state bordered by Libya to the north-east, Nigeria to the south, Benin and Burkina Faso to the south-west, Mali to the west, and Algeria to the north-west.\n\nOver 80% of Niger’s land area is arid and lies in the Sahara Desert. The remaining land areas are threatened by periodic drought and desertification. The country’s economy is dominated by subsistence agriculture, with some export agriculture in the more fertile south and the export of raw materials, especially uranium ore. Niger faces serious challenges to development due to its landlocked position, desert terrain, inefficient agriculture, explosive population growth, poor educational outcomes, deep-seated poverty, lack of infrastructure, poor healthcare, and environmental degradation.\n\nHistorically, what is now Niger has been on the fringes of several large states. Since independence, Nigeriens have lived under five constitutions and three periods of military rule. After the military coup in 2010, Niger became a democratic, multiparty state. Its new constitution, which restored the semi-presidential system of government of the 1999 constitution, in which the president and a prime minister named by the president share executive power, was approved on 31 October 2010.\n\nIn 2020, Mohamed Bazoum of the Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism was elected president in polls held in December 2020 and February 2021, which marked the first democratic transfer of power in Niger’s history. However, on 26 July 2023 the presidential guard detained President Bazoum and Presidential Guard commander General Abdourahamane Tchiani proclaimed himself the leader of a new military junta. In response to the coup, ECOWAS imposed sanctions on Niger, which then announced that it was leaving ECOWAS to pursue a confederation with Burkina Faso and Mali and that it intended to expand the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), established shortly after the coup. Niger subsequently decided to leave the G5 anti-jihadi force in the Sahel region and requested France to withdraw its 1 500 troops from the country.\n\nNiger is technically still a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), although it has announced its withdrawal with immediate effect. The treaty requires a notification process of one year.\n\nNiger has the fastest growing populations globally. Coming from a baseline of just over 8 million people in 1990, by 2019 the country’s population had increased almost threefold to 23.3 million people. Over the coming two decades, Niger’s population is expected to more than double and amount to 51.5 million people. In 2019, the population growth rate stood at 3.8%, the highest in the world when it comes to natural population growth. Population growth in Niger is driven by natural population growth, in other words, births outstripping deaths. The country has the highest average total fertility rate in the world.\n\nNiger also has the world’s youngest population, followed by Somalia in East Africa and Mali in West Africa. In 2019, half of Niger’s population was younger than 15.3 compared to the average median age of 17.9 years for the group of Africa’s low-income economies. In the Current Path forecast, Niger’s demographic structure is expected to change only very slowly. Historically, the country’s fertility rate has been extremely high. In 2019, it stood at an average of 6.8 births per woman, the highest globally and significantly above the average of 4.9 for its low-income peer group. By 2043, Niger’s fertility rate is expected to drop to 4.04 births per woman. As a consequence, the median age is projected to increase to 19.3 years — still the second lowest globally to be preceded only by Chad. Even in 2043, close to 70% of Niger’s population is projected to be younger than 30.\n\nThe slow decrease in fertility rates contrasts with an expected above-average increase in life expectancy — a combination that accelerates Niger’s explosive population growth. In 2019, the country’s average life expectancy was 64.5 years. On average, women reached 65.7 years and men 63.2. The country’s low life expectancy stems from a high disease burden, driven to a large extent by low access levels to safe water and improved sanitation. With a rate of 5.3 deaths per 1 000 people, Niger’s communicable-disease burden is higher than the average rate of its African income peer group which is 4.1.\n\nOn the Current Path, the average citizen of Niger can expect to live to 73.6 years — a gain of almost 10 years over the coming two decades, which would lie above the 2043 average for Africa’s low-income economies (at 70.8 years). A higher life expectancy would be a boost to Niger’s workforce. By 2043, the country’s working-age cohort is expected to account for 55.9% of the population compared to 48.1 in 2019. The ratio of people of working age relative to the dependent population is improving, but too slowly. Niger is moving through the demographic transition in slow motion. In fact, on the Current Path, it is expected to reach the peak of its demographic ‘sweet spot’ only in 2084 (from 0.92 in 2019 to 2.16 in 2084), more than ten years later than the average of its low-income peer group and at the absolute global bottom.\n\nNiger’s population of about 23.3 million people mostly lives in clusters in the far south and west of the country. With 80% of the country’s land area being arid, population density is low. It is estimated that 94% of the population lives on just 35% of the land. Niger’s capital and largest city is Niamey, located in Niger's south-west corner on the River Niger. The second and third largest cities are Maradi and Zinder, respectively.\n\nNiger is divided into seven regions and one capital district. These regions are subdivided into 36 departments that are broken down into urban and rural communes and administrative posts for largely uninhabited desert areas or military zones.\n\nNigerien society is ethnically diverse. The largest ethnic groups are the Hausa, who also represent the major ethnic group in neighbouring northern Nigeria, and the Zarma Songhai, who also live in parts of Mali. Both groups are sedentary farmers who inhabit the arable, southern part of Niger. The Kanuri (including Beriberi and Manga), on the other hand, make up the majority of the sedentary farmers in the far south-east. The remainder of the Nigerien people are nomadic or semi-nomadic livestock-raising peoples — Tuareg, Fulani, Toubou and Diffa Arabs.\n\nExplosive population growth has led to increased competition over scarce natural resources, including violent conflict.\n\nThe IFs platform uses data from the Global Trade and Analysis Project (GTAP) to classify economic activity into six sectors: agriculture, energy, materials (including mining), manufacturing, services and information and communication technologies (ICT). Most other sources use a threefold distinction between only agriculture, industry and services with the result that data may differ.\n\nIn 2019, Niger’s service sector accounted for almost half (47.4%) of the country’s GDP (US$7.3 billion), followed by agriculture which represented close to 30.3% (US$4.69 billion). In the future, the service sector is expected to remain the most important contributor to Niger’s GDP. Its share is set to grow to almost 55.9% by 2043 at a value of US$37.51 billion. At the same time, the contribution of the agriculture sector is forecast to drop to just over 10.7% (US$7.17 billion). The manufacturing sector, on the other hand, at 10.2% in 2019 the third largest contributor to Niger’s GDP, is forecast to increase only modestly by 2.3 percentage points to 14.5% in 2043. This is synonymous with an expansion of its GDP contribution from US$1.58 billion in 2019 to almost US$9.73 billion in 2043.\n\nNiger’s expected trajectory roughly mirrors that of its low-income peer group with the service sector representing both the current and future lion’s share of contribution to GDP, followed by the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, which are respectively expected to lose and gain ground.\n\nThe data on agricultural production and demand in the IFs forecasting platform initialises from data provided on food balances by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). IFs contains data on numerous types of agriculture but aggregates its forecast into crops, meat and fish, presented in million metric tons. Chart 9 shows agricultural production and demand as a total of all three categories.\n\nAt only 0.81 million metric tons per hectare in 2019, the country’s crop yield is the lowest within its low-income peer group on the continent. This reflects low productivity and low profitability. Rwanda, the frontrunner in this category, has more than ten times the crop yield of Niger. The average crop yield for Africa’s low-income economies in 2019 stood at 2.6 metric tons per hectare. By 2043, it is expected to increase to 3.5 metric tons per hectare compared to Niger’s at 1.03 metric tons per hectare.\n\nThe lion’s share of Niger’s agricultural output is crops. In 2019, the country’s crop production amounted to about 12.38 million metric tons compared to the average output of 13.82 million metric tons in its Africa low-income peer group. This gap is projected to widen by 2043 with Niger expected to increase its output to 15.7 million metric tons versus the group’s average output reaching 20.05 million metric tons.\n\nMore importantly, already at present, Niger’s agricultural production does not meet demand. In 2019, the gap between production and demand came to 1.67 million metric tons. By 2043, this gap is expected to widen to 17.87 metric tons. Agricultural demand is fuelled by Niger’s extremely fast-expanding population. In combination with low productivity, competition over scarce resources resulting in insecurity, as well as environmental degradation and high exposure to climate change-related risks, food insecurity is worsened.\n\nThere are numerous methodologies for and approaches to defining poverty. We measure income poverty and use GDP per capita as a proxy. In 2015, the World Bank adopted the measure of US$1.90 per person per day (in 2011 international prices), also used to measure progress towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 of eradicating extreme poverty. To account for extreme poverty in richer countries occurring at slightly higher levels of income than in poor countries, the World Bank introduced three additional poverty lines in 2017:\n\nUS$3.20 for lower middle-income countries\n\nUS$5.50 for upper middle-income countries\n\nUS$22.70 for high-income countries.\n\nAs a low-income country, Niger uses the US$1.90 benchmark to define extreme poverty. The country’s poverty burden is high. In 2019, 44.26% of the population was living below the poverty line, which corresponds to 10.3 million people. Niger’s poverty rate lies about 3.5 percentage points below the average of its low-income peer group on the continent (47.75%).\n\nOn the Current Path, the number of people living in extreme poverty in Niger is expected to drop to 7.64 million people by 2043. The country’s poverty rate is projected to decline to 14.76% by then — a drastic reduction by almost 70%. Over the same period, Africa’s low-income economies will on average reduce their poverty rates by 46.45%. In 2019, Niger had the ninth lowest poverty rate among Africa’s low-income economies. By 2043, it is expected to improve its position by three ranks.\n\nSocial welfare (government to household welfare transfers) in Niger is expected to increase from US$0.08 billion to US$1.93 billion in 2043.\n\nThe IFs platform forecasts six types of energy, namely oil, gas, coal, hydro, nuclear and other renewables. To allow comparisons between different types of energy, the data is converted into billion barrels of oil equivalent (BBOE). The energy contained in a barrel of oil is approximately 5.8 million British thermal units (MBTUs) or 1 700 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy.\n\nIn 2019, Niger’s total energy production was about 0.0119 million barrels of oil. By 2043, it is estimated to increase to 0.0173 million barrels. The country’s current energy mix is heavily reliant on oil, which accounts for 92.4% of total production, followed by coal at 7.6%.\n\nThe Current Path forecast indicates a significant change in Niger’s energy mix in the future. From 2026 onwards, renewables are expected to take off to eventually account for 61.5% of total energy production. Oil is projected to drop to 27.9% of total production while the share of coal is projected to remain fairly steady. The share of gas, only playing a minor role in 2019, is expected to increase modestly to account for 2.8% by 2043.\n\nThe anticipated share of renewables in Niger’s energy production profile by far exceeds the average of 39% that is anticipated for Africa’s low-income economies. This can be explained by Niger’s significant renewable energy resources (mostly solar and wind) that can be exploited to power the growing economy.\n\nThe Stability scenario represents reasonable but ambitious reductions in risk of regime instability and lower levels of internal conflict. Stability is generally a prerequisite for other aspects of development and this would encourage inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and improve business confidence. Better governance through the accountability that follows substantive democracy is modelled separately.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nThe Stability scenario reflects significant interventions, including increasing regime stability, lowering levels of internal conflict, improving gender empowerment and addressing high levels of corruption.\n\nIn 2019, Niger scored 0.69 on the governance security index, which was higher than the average score of 0.64 for its Africa low-income peer group. With a score of 0.76, Rwanda leads the group.\n\nThe broader Sahel crisis has been destabilising the region for more than ten years. Similar to its neighbours Mali and Burkina Faso, Niger faces several security challenges. These include the Boko Haram insurgency in the Lake Chad Basin, the Sahelian insurgency led by the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) in northern Tillaberi, and the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam (JNIM) activity in south-western Tillaberi.\n\nACLED summarises: ‘Since early 2021, the country has been marked by significant instability — militants believed to be ISGS have killed an estimated 390 people in various parts of the Tillaberi region and neighboring Tahoua. A series of large-scale killings targeting civilians of Djerma and Tuareg ethnicity resulted in most of the deaths reported.’\n\nIn the Stability scenario, governance security in Niger is projected to improve to a score of 0.83 by 2043 compared to 0.74 on the Current Path. Niger is on par with the projected average of 0.83 for its peer group in Africa in 2043.\n\nThis section presents the impact of a Demographic scenario that aims to hasten and increase the demographic dividend through reasonable but ambitious reductions in the communicable-disease burden for children under five, the maternal mortality ratio and increased access to modern contraception.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nDemographers typically differentiate between a first, second and even a third demographic dividend. We focus here on the contribution of the size of the labour force (between 15 and 64 years of age) relative to dependants (children and the elderly) as part of the first dividend. A window of opportunity opens when the ratio of the working-age population to dependants is equal to or surpasses 1.7.\n\nIncreasing access to modern contraception will have a dramatic impact on Niger’s total fertility rate which could drop by almost 50% from 6.8 births per woman in 2019 to 3.55 in 2043. On the Current Path, it would take the country roughly two more decades to reach a comparable fertility rate. A lower total fertility rate would slow down Niger’s population growth and change the population age structure, resulting in a more favourable ratio between people of working age and dependants, especially children. In the interventions in the Demographic scenario, Niger has the potential to accelerate its demographic transition by increasing the ratio between workers and dependants from 0.93 in 2019 to 1.36 in 2043 compared to 1.27 on the Current Path. Arriving at the ‘demographic sweet spot’, however, remains out of reach for Niger. In contrast, Africa’s low-income economies would on average get there by 2042 already (from 1.53 in 2019 to 1.74 in 2043).\n\nThis section presents reasonable but ambitious improvements in the Health/WaSH scenario, which include reductions in the mortality rate associated with both communicable diseases (e.g. AIDS, diarrhoea, malaria and respiratory infections) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (e.g. diabetes), as well as improvements in access to safe water and better sanitation. The acronym WaSH stands for water, sanitation and hygiene.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nThe Health/WaSH scenario has the potential to increase life expectancy in Niger from 64.48 years in 2019 to 74.12 years in 2043, compared to 73.65 years on the Current Path. The country would especially benefit from the interventions in the medium term. By 2033, the difference in the gain in life expectancy between the Current Path forecast and the Health/WaSH scenario comes close to a year. As in the case of infant mortality, Niger performs better in life expectancy than the average African low-income economy with a baseline of 63.78 years that is projected to increase to 70.85 years on the Current Path and to 70.85 years in the Health/WaSH scenario.\n\nThe Education scenario represents reasonable but ambitious improved intake, transition and graduation rates from primary to tertiary levels and better quality of education. It also models substantive progress towards gender parity at all levels, additional vocational training at secondary school level and increases in the share of science and engineering graduates.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nWith a mean of 2.7 years of education among the adult population in 2019, Niger’s educational outcomes are extremely poor. Educational outcomes for girls are even worse with a mean of 2.1 years. According to UNICEF, ‘geographic gaps in school coverage and poor retention rates remain unaddressed, quality has worsened, and inequities have deepened, with the poorest and rural children least likely to attend school’.\n\nThe Education scenario has the potential to increase Niger’s mean years of education to 5.5 years by 2043. This represents an improvement of 0.7 years compared to the Current Path forecast of 4.8 years in 2043. Female education outcomes would still lag behind those for males (5.1 versus 5.9 mean years of education, respectively). Globally, Niger ranks last educational performance measured in mean years of education. Together with Mali it is the only African low-income country with a mean below 3 years of education, which means that most Nigeriens will not have primary education by 2043. The average mean for the group is 4.4 years of education in 2019. By 2043, this will increase to 6.1 years on the Current Path and to 6.6 years in the Education scenario.\n\nThe Manufacturing/Transfers scenario represents reasonable but ambitious manufacturing growth through greater investment in the economy, investments in research and development, and promotion of the export of manufactured goods. It is accompanied by an increase in welfare transfers (social grants) to moderate the initial increases in inequality that are typically associated with a manufacturing transition. To this end, the scenario improves tax administration and increases government revenues.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nChart 30 should be read with Chart 8 that presents a stacked area graph on the contribution to GDP and size, in billion US$, of the Current Path economy for each of the sectors.\n\nIn the Manufacturing/Transfers scenario, the service sector will experience the largest gain in terms of its relative contribution to GDP. Its contribution is expected to have increased by 0.59 percentage points in 2043. The service sector is followed by the manufacturing sector that is projected to see its relative contribution to GDP increase by 0.49 in 2043. It needs to be noted, however, that the trend for both the relative contribution of services and manufacturing to GDP does not follow a linear development.\n\nThe value of the service sector is forecast to increase by US$18.2 billion in the Manufacturing/Transfers scenario compared to the Current Path forecast. The Manufacturing/Transfers scenario has the potential for the manufacturing sector to contribute US$6.82 billion more to the economy by 2043 compared to the Current Path. The ICT sector is expected to contribute an additional US$2.1 million in this scenario.\n\nThe Free Trade scenario represents the impact of the full implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) by 2034 through increases in exports, improved productivity and increased trade and economic freedom.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nThe trade balance is the difference between the value of a country's exports and its imports. A country that imports more goods and services than it exports in terms of value has a trade deficit, while a country that exports more goods and services than it imports has a trade surplus.\n\nIn 2019, Niger had a trade deficit that accounted for 16.1% of GDP. In the Free Trade scenario, the country’s trade balance is set to improve with the deficit accounting for 8.22% of GDP by 2026 before worsening again to 14.7% by 2037, and finally settling at 12.4% of GDP in 2043 versus 9.52% in the Current Path forecast. Essentially, in any case, Niger is expected to have a negative trade balance by 2043, but in the Free Trade scenario the deficit would be higher than in the Current Path forecast.\n\nHowever, the implementation of the AfCFTA in the Free Trade scenario would improve the short- and medium-term trade deficit for Niger compared to the Current Path forecast. With the removal of trade restrictions, following a trade liberalisation, it becomes easier to import while Niger firms face intense competition on the export markets. However, only trade balance is not a viable indicator to conclude that Niger will be a loser in the implementation of AfCFTA, other indicators need to be considered.\n\nThe Infrastructure scenario represents a reasonable but ambitious increase in infrastructure spending across Africa, focusing on basic infrastructure (roads, water, sanitation, electricity access and ICT) in low-income countries and increasing emphasis on advanced infrastructure (such as ports, airports, railway and electricity generation) in higher-income countries.\n\nNote that health and sanitation infrastructure is included as part of the Health/WaSH scenario and that ICT infrastructure and more rapid uptake of renewables are part of the Leapfrogging scenario. The interventions there push directly on outcomes, whereas those modelled in this scenario increase infrastructure spending, indirectly boosting other forms of infrastructure, including those supporting health, sanitation and ICT.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nIn 2019, only 4.5 million Nigeriens had access to electricity, accounting for about 19% of the population. In urban areas, access rates were more than twice as high reaching 50.9%. The interventions in the Infrastructure scenario have the potential to increase Niger’s overall electricity access rate to 44.3% by 2043 compared to 40.8% on the Current Path. This means that 8.17 million more Nigeriens could benefit from access to electricity by 2043 (29.13 million as opposed to 20.96 million).\n\nRural areas would benefit more from the interventions in the Infrastructure scenario than urban areas. Access rates in rural areas would increase about threefold from 13.16% in 2019 to 39.95% by 2043 compared to an expected increase from 50.93% in 2019 to 76.63% by 2043 in urban areas.\n\nThe Combined Agenda 2063 scenario consists of the combination of all 11 sectoral scenarios presented above, namely the Stability, Demographic, Health/WaSH, Agriculture, Education, Manufacturing/Transfers, Leapfrogging, Free Trade, Financial Flows, Infrastructure and Governance scenarios. The cumulative impact of better education, health, infrastructure, etc. means that countries get an additional benefit in the integrated IFs forecasting platform that we refer to as the synergistic effect. Chart 55 presents the contribution of each of these 12 components to GDP per capita in the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario as a stacked area graph.\n\nThe synergistic effect of all the scenarios on GDP per capita is about US$277 in 2043. Among the sectoral interventions, the Agriculture scenario is projected to have the greatest impact on GDP per capita, leading to an increase of US$255 by 2043. The second and third largest impacts on GDP per capita could be achieved in the Free Trade and the Leapfrogging scenarios: additions to GDP per capita of US$238.7 and US$194, respectively. The Health/WaSH and the Demographic scenarios would have the smallest impact on GDP per capita.\n\nSee Chart 8 to view the Current Path forecast of the sectoral composition of the economy.\n\nThe evolution of the various sectors in terms of their relative contribution to GDP does not follow a linear trajectory. In the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario and looking to 2043, the service sector will experience the greatest increase in terms of its relative contribution to Niger’s GDP compared to the Current Path: an additional 2.6 percentage points in 2043. This translates to an increase in GDP of US$43.83 billion attributable to services alone. The boost for services through the Combined Agenda 2063 interventions is most pronounced in 2037 when the difference in percentage points compared to the Current Path is 4.96. The agriculture sector is also projected to increase its relative contribution to GDP compared to the Current Path adding up to 2.44 percentage points in 2028. In 2043, agriculture will contribute an extra US$4.8 billion to Niger’s GDP even though the relative contribution of the sector starts declining from 2028. The ICT sector is projected to steadily increase its relative contribution to GDP in the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario gaining 1.87 percentage points. In terms of its absolute additional contribution to GDP, in the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario, the manufacturing sector will add an extra US$10.8 billion to Niger’s GDP by 2043 — more than any other sector with the exception of services."
