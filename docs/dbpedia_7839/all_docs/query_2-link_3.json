        "text": "Niger is a landlocked nation located in West Africa. It occupies an area of 1,267,000 sq. km and is split almost in half by the Sahara Desert. Niger shares a border with seven separate nations. Libya, Algeria, Burkina Faso, Benin, Nigeria, Mali, and Chad all surround Niger. The climate of Niger is quite arid with the wetter more arable regions being found in the south.\n\nThe Air Mountains, found in the north of the nation, punctuate the Sahara Desert in a north-south direction with a series of nine massifs. The highest point of the country, Mont Idoukal-n-Taghes at 2,022 m (marked on the map), is located in the south-central region of the Air Mountains. Another highland region is found to the northeast and comprises a series of high plateaus including Djado, Mangueni, and Tchiga√Ø in the west-to-east direction. The Tenere Desert (shown on the map), part of the Sahara, is covered by an erg and a reg.\n\nThe Sahel region dominates the southern geography of Niger, This biome extends from the southwestern border with Burkina Faso to Lake Chad in the southeast. This region is a transition zone between the Sahara desert in the north and the more lush grasslands and jungle that can be found in Sub Sahara Africa."
