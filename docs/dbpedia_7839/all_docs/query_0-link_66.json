Where no code exists for a specific location, use the nearest most appropriate broader code that includes it. DO NOT USE: to indicate any geographical aspect that is not to do with the content or subject of a book (e.g. place of publication, market availability, nationality of author â this is described in other metadata, etc). National extensions (i.e. 1*-xx- format codes, where âxxâ indicates a country code) can be assigned by any user, and are not exclusive to users in the indicated country. This section is not intended as an exhaustive gazetteer of all places but a list of commonly used locations in the global book supply chain.
