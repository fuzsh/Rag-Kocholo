        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nPresent-day Niger originated from the nomadic peoples of the Saharan north and the agriculturalists of the south. The Taureg kingdom of Takedda was one of the largest kingdoms in the north and played a prominent role in regional trade in the 14th century. In the south, the primary ethnic groups were the Songhai-Zarma in the west, the Hausa in the center, and the Kanuri in the east. When European colonizers arrived in the 19th century, the region was an assemblage of disparate local kingdoms.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the British and French agreed to partition the middle regions of the Niger River, and France began its conquest of what would become the colony of Niger.Â France experienced determined local resistance - particularly during the Tuareg uprising (1916-1917) - but established a colonial administration in 1922.\n\nAfter achieving independence from France in 1960, Niger experienced single-party or military rule until 1991 when political pressure forced General Ali SAIBOU to allow multiparty elections. Political infighting and democratic backsliding led to coups in 1996 and 1999. In December of that year, military officers restored democratic rule and held elections that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power. TANDJA was reelected in 2004 and spearheaded a 2009 constitutional amendment allowing him to extend his presidential term. In February 2010, military officers led another coup that deposed TANDJA. ISSOUFOU Mahamadou was elected in April 2011 and reelected in early 2016. In February 2021, BAZOUM Mohammed won the presidential election, marking Nigerâs first transition from one democratically elected president to another.\n\nNiger is one of the poorest countries in the world with minimal government services and insufficient funds to develop its resource base. It is ranked last in the world on the UN Development Programme's Human Development Index. The largely agrarian and subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by extended droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa. The Nigerien Government continues its attempts to diversify the economy through increased oil production and mining projects. In addition, Niger is facing increased security concerns on its borders from various external threats including insecurity in Libya, spillover from the conflict and terrorism in Mali, and violent extremism in northeastern Nigeria.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nWestern Africa, southeast of Algeria\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n16 00 N, 8 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 1.267 million sq km\n\nland: 1,266,700 sq km\n\nwater: 300 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 23\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly less than twice the size of Texas\n\nArea comparison map\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 5,834 km\n\nborder countries (7): Algeria 951 km; Benin 277 km; Burkina Faso 622 km; Chad 1,196 km; Libya 342 km; Mali 838 km; Nigeria 1,608 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km (landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\ndesert; mostly hot, dry, dusty; tropical in extreme south\n\nTerrain\n\npredominately desert plains and sand dunes; flat to rolling plains in south; hills in north\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Idoukal-n-Taghes 2,022 m\n\nlowest point: Niger River 200 m\n\nmean elevation: 474 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nuranium, coal, iron ore, tin, phosphates, gold, molybdenum, gypsum, salt, petroleum\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 35.1% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 12.3% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 0.1% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 22.7% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 1% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 63.9% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n2,666 sq km (2020)\n\nMajor lakes (area sq km)\n\nfresh water lake(s): Lake Chad (endorheic lake shared with Chad, Nigeria, and Cameroon) - 10,360-25,900 sq km\n\nnote - area varies by season and year to year\n\nMajor rivers (by length in km)\n\nNiger (shared with Guinea [s], Mali, Benin, and Nigeria [m]) - 4,200 km\n\nnote â [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\n\nMajor watersheds (area sq km)\n\nAtlantic Ocean drainage: Niger (2,261,741 sq km)\n\nInternal (endorheic basin) drainage: Lake Chad (2,497,738 sq km)\n\nMajor aquifers\n\nLake Chad Basin, Lullemeden-Irhazer Basin, Murzuk-Djado Basin\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nmajority of the populace is located in the southernmost extreme of the country along the border with Nigeria and Benin as shown in this population distribution map\n\nNatural hazards\n\nrecurring droughts\n\nGeography - note\n\nlandlocked; one of the hottest countries in the world; northern four-fifths is desert, southern one-fifth is savanna, suitable for livestock and limited agriculture\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n24,484,587 (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 56\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Nigerien(s)\n\nadjective: Nigerien\n\nEthnic groups\n\nHausa 53.1%, Zarma/Songhai 21.2%, Tuareg 11%, Fulani (Peuhl) 6.5%, Kanuri 5.9%, Gurma 0.8%, Arab 0.4%, Tubu 0.4%, other/unavailable 0.9% (2006 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nFrench (official), Hausa, Djerma\n\nReligions\n\nMuslim 99.3%, Christian 0.3%, animist 0.2%, none 0.1% (2012 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nNiger has the highest total fertility rate (TFR) of any country in the world, averaging close to 7 children per woman in 2022. A slight decline in fertility over the last few decades has stalled. This leveling off of the high fertility rate is in large part a product of the continued desire for large families. In Niger, the TFR is lower than the desired fertility rate, which makes it unlikely that contraceptive use will increase. The high TFR sustains rapid population growth and a large youth population â almost 70% of the populace is under the age of 25, as of 2022. Gender inequality, including a lack of educational opportunities for women and early marriage and childbirth, also contributes to high population growth.\n\nBecause of large family sizes, children are inheriting smaller and smaller parcels of land. The dependence of most Nigeriens on subsistence farming on increasingly small landholdings, coupled with declining rainfall and the resultant shrinkage of arable land, are all preventing food production from keeping up with population growth.\n\nFor more than half a century, Niger's lack of economic development has led to steady net outmigration. In the 1960s, Nigeriens mainly migrated to coastal West African countries to work on a seasonal basis. Some headed to Libya and Algeria in the 1970s to work in the booming oil industry until its decline in the 1980s. Since the 1990s, the principal destinations for Nigerien labor migrants have been West African countries, especially Burkina Faso and Cote dâIvoire, while emigration to Europe and North America has remained modest. During the same period, Nigerâs desert trade route town Agadez became a hub for West African and other Sub-Saharan migrants crossing the Sahara to North Africa and sometimes onward to Europe.\n\nMore than 60,000 Malian refugees have fled to Niger since violence between Malian government troops and armed rebels began in early 2012. Ongoing attacks by the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency, dating to 2013 in northern Nigeria and February 2015 in southeastern Niger, pushed tens of thousands of Nigerian refugees and Nigerien returnees across the border to Niger and displaced thousands of locals in Nigerâs already impoverished Diffa region.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 50.58% (male 5,805,102/female 5,713,815)\n\n15-24 years: 19.99% (male 2,246,670/female 2,306,285)\n\n25-54 years: 23.57% (male 2,582,123/female 2,784,464)\n\n55-64 years: 3.17% (male 357,832/female 364,774)\n\n65 years and over: 2.68% (male 293,430/female 317,866) (2020 est.)\n\n2022 population pyramid\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 105.4\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 100.4\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 5\n\npotential support ratio: 20.1 (2021 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 14.8 years\n\nmale: 14.5 years\n\nfemale: 15.1 years (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 227\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n3.66% (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 3\n\nBirth rate\n\n47.08 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 1\n\nDeath rate\n\n9.87 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 37\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-0.64 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 129\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nmajority of the populace is located in the southernmost extreme of the country along the border with Nigeria and Benin as shown in this population distribution map\n\nUrbanization\n\nurban population: 17.1% of total population (2023)\n\nrate of urbanization: 4.72% annual rate of change (2020-25 est.)\n\nMajor urban areas - population\n\n1.437 million NIAMEY (capital) (2023)\n\nSex ratio\n\nat birth: 1.03 male(s)/female\n\n0-14 years: 1.02 male(s)/female\n\n15-24 years: 0.97 male(s)/female\n\n25-54 years: 0.92 male(s)/female\n\n55-64 years: 0.97 male(s)/female\n\n65 years and over: 0.81 male(s)/female\n\ntotal population: 0.98 male(s)/female (2022 est.)\n\nMother's mean age at first birth\n\n18.5 years (2012 est.)\n\nnote: data represents median age at first birth among women 20-49\n\nMaternal mortality ratio\n\n509 deaths/100,000 live births (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 20\n\nInfant mortality rate\n\ntotal: 66.81 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nmale: 71.73 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nfemale: 61.75 deaths/1,000 live births (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 6\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\ntotal population: 60.09 years\n\nmale: 58.55 years\n\nfemale: 61.68 years (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 218\n\nTotal fertility rate\n\n6.82 children born/woman (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 1\n\nContraceptive prevalence rate\n\n11% (2021)\n\nDrinking water source\n\nimproved: urban: 95.8% of population\n\nrural: 63.1% of population\n\ntotal: 68.6% of population\n\nunimproved: urban: 4.2% of population\n\nrural: 36.9% of population\n\ntotal: 31.4% of population (2020 est.)\n\nCurrent health expenditure\n\n5.7% of GDP (2019)\n\nPhysicians density\n\n0.04 physicians/1,000 population (2020)\n\nHospital bed density\n\n0.4 beds/1,000 population (2017)\n\nSanitation facility access\n\nimproved: urban: 81.9% of population\n\nrural: 13.5% of population\n\ntotal: 24.8% of population\n\nunimproved: urban: 18.1% of population\n\nrural: 86.5% of population\n\ntotal: 75.2% of population (2020 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate\n\n0.2% (2021 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 99\n\nMajor infectious diseases\n\ndegree of risk: very high (2020)\n\nfood or waterborne diseases: bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever\n\nvectorborne diseases: malaria and dengue fever\n\nwater contact diseases: schistosomiasis\n\nanimal contact diseases: rabies\n\nrespiratory diseases: meningococcal meningitis\n\nnote: on 21 March 2022, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Travel Alert for polio in Africa;

Agriculture contributes approximately 40% of GDP and provides livelihood for over 80% of the population. The UN ranked Niger as the second least developed country in the world in 2016 due to multiple factors such as food insecurity, lack of industry, high population growth, a weak educational sector, and few prospects for work outside of subsistence farming and herding.\n\nÂ\n\nSince 2011 public debt has increased due to efforts to scale-up public investment, particularly that related to infrastructure, as well as due to increased security spending. The government relies on foreign donor resources for a large portion of its fiscal budget. The economy in recent years has been hurt by terrorist activity near its uranium mines and by instability in Mali and in the Diffa region of the country; concerns about security have resulted in increased support from regional and international partners on defense. Low uranium prices, demographics, and security expenditures may continue to put pressure on the governmentâs finances.\n\nÂ\n\nThe Government of Niger plans to exploit oil, gold, coal, and other mineral resources to sustain future growth. Although Niger has sizable reserves of oil, the prolonged drop in oil prices has reduced profitability. Food insecurity and drought remain perennial problems for Niger, and the government plans to invest more in irrigation. Nigerâs three-year $131 million IMF Extended Credit Facility (ECF) agreement for the years 2012-15 was extended until the end of 2016. In February 2017, the IMF approved a new 3-year $134 million ECF. In June 2017, The World Bankâs International Development Association (IDA) granted Niger $1 billion over three years for IDA18, a program to boost the countryâs development and alleviate poverty. A $437 million Millennium Challenge Account compact for Niger, commencing in FY18, will focus on large-scale irrigation infrastructure development and community-based, climate-resilient agriculture, while promoting sustainable increases in agricultural productivity and sales.\n\nÂ\n\nFormal private sector investment needed for economic diversification and growth remains a challenge, given the countryâs limited domestic markets, access to credit, and competitiveness. Although President ISSOUFOU is courting foreign investors, including those from the US, as of April 2017, there were no US firms operating in Niger. In November 2017, the National Assembly passed the 2018 Finance Law that was geared towards raising government revenues and moving away from international support.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$28.97 billion (2020 est.)\n\n$28.54 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$26.95 billion (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 137\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n4.9% (2017 est.)\n\n4.9% (2016 est.)\n\n4.3% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 51\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$1,200 (2020 est.)\n\n$1,200 (2019 est.)\n\n$1,200 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 225\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$12.926 billion (2019 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n-2.5% (2019 est.)\n\n6.3% (2018 est.)\n\n2.3% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 2\n\nCredit ratings\n\nMoody's rating: B3 (2019)\n\nnote: The year refers to the year in which the current credit rating was first obtained.\n\nGDP -
