        "text": "The linguistic history of the Ghana-Togo Mountain (GTM) languages, spoken in southeastern Ghana and the southern half of Togo, has been the subject of detailed research for more than a century. Nevertheless, there are still problems both with the external and the internal classification of the group. The present paper provides a state of the art overview of this research field. It is argued that linguistic reconstructions that can claim to provide credible hypotheses on genetic relationship patterns among languages are best based on the application of the comparative method.\n\nBackground: There are over 2000 genetically diverse ethnolinguistic groups in Africa that could help decipher human evolutionary history and the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. We have analysed 298 genomes from Niger Congo populations from six sub Saharan African countries (Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Zambia, Ivory Coast, Guinea) and a Nilo Saharan population from Uganda. These samples were collected as part of the TrypanoGEN consortium project http://www.trypanogen.net. Results: The population genetic structure of the 298 individuals revealed four clusters which correlated with ethnolinguistic group and geographical latitude, that is, West African Niger-Congo A, Central African Niger Congo, East African Niger-Congo B and the NiloSaharan. We observed a spatial distribution of positive natural selection signatures in genes associated with AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria and Human African Trypanosomiasis among the TrypanoGEN samples. Having observed a marked dif...\n\nWe analyzed sequence variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervariable segment I (HVS-I) from 201 Black individuals from two Brazilian cities (Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre), and compared these data with published information from 21 African populations. A subset of 187 males of the sample was also characterized for 30 Y-chromosome biallelic polymorphisms, and the data were compared with those from 48 African populations. The mtDNA data indicated that respectively 69% and 82% of the matrilineages found in Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre originated from West-Central/Southeast Africa. These estimates are in close agreement with historical records which indicated that most of the Brazilian slaves who arrived in Rio de Janeiro were from West-Central Africa. In contrast to mtDNA, Y-chromosome haplogroup analysis did not allow discrimination between places of origin in West or West-Central Africa. Thus, when comparing these two major African regions, there seems to be higher genetic structure with mtDNA than with Y-chromosome data. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2007.

However, the number of subgroups they fall into and how far these are related to one another and to Niger-Congo more broadly remains disputed. The paper concentrates on two families, Heiban and Talodi, both of which have alternating nominal affixes and alliterative concord. They are generally considered to be related, but published argument to support this is scarce. The paper reviews the evidence for lexical cognacy and nominal affixing when the proto-forms are compared. The percentage of cognate items on a 200-word list in surprisingly low, less than 10%, making regular phonological correspondences difficult to recover. The nominal affixes show very limited segmental cognacy despite common patterns of semantic grouping. However, their similarities to other Niger-Congo systems are doubtful; many idiosyncratic pairings seem to have no parallel. The paper concludes that Heiban and Talodi may well be independent Niger-Congo branches and the similarities due to more recent borrowing. Kordofanian has retained the essential structures of the Niger-Congo system, but segmental cognacy has become heavily eroded, perhaps due to contact with Nilo-Saharan."
