        "text": "Details\n\nA very fine watercolour of a pansy as a birthday note from Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia (1875 â 1960) to her granddaughter. The note is addressed to her granddaughter Princess Nadejda Dmitrievna (1933 â 2002). It is signed on the front very faintly \"Xenia\" , whilst on the reverse she has signed it with her family nickname \"Amama\".\n\n\"Darling Nadia\n\nThank you so much for your nice long letter. What do you say to your grandmother forgetting all about your birthday and never ending you a line!! It is too bad and I feel very ashamed of myself. I send you here enclosed 10/.- you must be kept busy reading all the books you were given for yr birthday. Fancy being 10 years old already - I can't believe it somehow!\n\nLots of kises from us all and my love to Miss Kraty. God bless you!\n\nYr Amama\"\n\nBoth Grand Duchess Xenia and her sister Grand Duchess Olga were well known for painting flowers, although it is rarer to find those from Grand Duchess Xenia.\n\nOn this particular note dated July 13th 1943, she has painted a violet pansy for her granddaughter congratulating her on her birthday, but also apologising for forgetting it. Miss Kraty is most likely a nanny.\n\nGrand Duchess Xenia was the elder daughter of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia (nÃ©e Princess Dagmar of Denmark) and the sister of Emperor Nicholas II. She married her cousin Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia, with whom she had seven children. During her brother's reign she recorded in her diary and letters increasing concern about his rule. After the fall of the monarchy in February 1917 she fled Russia, eventually settling in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn 26 February 1933, Xenia's husband Sandro Grand Duke Alexander Michailovich died. Xenia and her sons were present at his funeral on 1 March, in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in the south of France. By March 1937, Xenia had moved from Frogmore Cottage in Windsor Great Park to Wilderness House in the grounds of Hampton Court Palace, where she continued to live until she died on 20 April 1960. Despite reduced circumstances during her lifetime, Xenia left a small estate to her remaining relatives.\n\nSize: 12.5 x 9.5 cm approx"
