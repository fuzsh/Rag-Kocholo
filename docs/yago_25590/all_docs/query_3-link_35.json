        "text": "The Romanoff Dynasty [also transliterated as Romanov] ruled Russia for over 300 years, from 1613 to 1917. After the foundational Riurik dynasty ended with the death of Ivan the Terrible’s son Fedor in 1598, Russia entered a period of dynastic turmoil, internecine conflict, and foreign invasion known as the “Time of Troubles.” Finally, in 1613, after a popular militia drove out Polish invaders and restored order, an assembly of popular representatives [zemskii sobor] elected Mikhail Romanoff, the son of a prominent boyar [noble] family to serve as Tsar.\n\nMany of the Russian Tsars whose names are most familiar to Americans were members of the Romanoff dynasty: Peter the Great (ruled 1682-1725), worked to make Russia a great power, westernized Russian culture, and founded the city of St. Petersburg; Catherine the Great (ruled 1762-1796) built on Peter’s legacy, extending the boundaries of the Russian Empire to the south and the west; Alexander I (ruled 1801-1825), was emperor during the Napoleonic Wars; and Alexander II (ruled 1855-1881) finally emancipated Russia’s serfs, as well as inaugurating the era of “Great Reforms.”\n\nThe rule of the Romanoff dynasty ended in March 1917, during the First World War, when Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate due to a popular uprising known as the February Revolution. After the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in October 1917 and proclaimed Soviet power, members of the Romanoff dynasty suffered increased persecution as Russia devolved into civil war. The former ruler Nicholas II, his wife, and children were executed in Ekaterinburg in July 1918. Other Romanoffs were executed elsewhere in Russia. Some managed to escape from Russia, including Dowager Empress Maria Fedorovna and her daughter Ksenia Aleksandrovna, great-grandmother and grandmother, respectively, of Prince Nikita Nikitich Romanoff. Surviving members of the Romanoff family made lives in exile, including in France, Great Britain, and the United States."
