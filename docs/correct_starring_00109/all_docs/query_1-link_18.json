        "text": "While plans to further TriStar’s Godzilla franchise on the big screen fell through, the animated sequel turned out to be a great alternative. Godzilla: The Series debuted mere months after the 1998 film was released, and it went on to become a popular part of Fox Kids’ Saturday morning programming. And although this continuation had a limited lifespan of just two seasons, it still managed to do the impossible and redeem Roland Emmerich’s widely disliked adaptation.\n\nSimilar to Ultra Q, Godzilla: The Series saw Dr. Niko “Nick” Tatopoulos (out with Matthew Broderick, in with Ian Ziering) leading a specialized team — Humanitarian Environmental Analysis Team, or H.E.A.T. for short — in the struggle against the giant and disruptive creatures (often referred to as “mutants”) who have begun to appear all across the globe. Aiding them was the lone, surviving offspring of Godzilla teased at the end of the film. And to ensure the juvenile Godzilla stood with humanity rather than against it, the spawn imprinted on Nick and saw him as his parent.\n\nAlong with “worm guy” Tatopoulos, the animated Godzilla: The Series brought back supporting characters from the film and gave them lead parts. Namely H.E.A.T. members Dr. Elsie Chapman and Dr. Mendel Craven. Charity James filled in for Vicki Lewis while Malcolm Danare was one of several actors from the film to reprise their roles in the cartoon. Paleobiologist Chapman was the snarky animal-behavior expert, and engineer Craven served as the show’s comic relief (which was always done at his own expense). On top of Craven’s many ridiculous allergies and other vulnerable quirks, his talking robot-buddy N.I.G.E.L. (short for Next Millennium Intelligence Gathering Electronic Liaison) drew cheap laughs; the machine routinely met a fate in the vein of South Park’s “oh my god, they killed Kenny” running gag.\n\nRounding out H.E.A.T. were two new characters: DGSE secret agent Monique Dupré (Brigitte Bako) and young computer whiz Randy Hernandez (Rino Romano). The former started out like Jean Reno’s character from the film; Dupré was sent by the French government to “clean up” its mess after incidentally creating the Godzilla species, and after Philippe Roaché’s failure to eliminate all of the hatchlings. The steely servicewoman gradually warmed up as she became more involved in H.E.A.T. and realized this new Godzilla was vastly different from his father. As for Randy, he is the team’s genius slacker-hacker who still has a lot to learn from his older colleagues.\n\nThe previously mentioned Agent Roaché popped up in the cartoon, although now he was voiced by Keith Szarabajka. Reporter Audrey Timmonds (Paget Brewster) continued to be overly ambitious, much to the detriment of her already strained relationship with Nick, and her cameraman, Victor “Animal” Palotti, was downright testy now that Joe Pantoliano took over for Hank Azaria. On top of Malcolm Danare, other returning actors included Kevin Dunn as H.E.A.T.’s military associate and one of Godzilla’s reluctant supporters, Major Anthony Hicks, and Michael Lerner as Mayor Ebert. The latter character’s naming was, by the way, Emmerich’s petty response to critic Roger Ebert’s negative reviews of his previous films.\n\nMissteps regarding the ‘98 film’s namesake were decisively corrected in the animated sequel. For starters, Godzilla’s trademark atomic fire breath was reintroduced without questioning; the progeny now emitted a green flame, whereas later on in the story, its revived father suddenly possessed the traditional blue variant. Moreover, Godzilla Junior was not only bigger and stronger than his parent, he was far more resilient to military attacks and whatnot. The power upgrade was necessary if the new Big G was tangling with other colossal critters. Most importantly, though, was the addition of a personality. The film treated its enormous star as nothing more than a wrecking ball with legs and claws. Any attempt at creating character was saved for the human cast, however dull they turned out. Meanwhile, the series managed to imbue the King of Monsters with a sense of individuality without also veering into anthropomorphism. The prolific Frank Welker, who provided various creature sounds both here and in the ’98 film, helped vocalize Godzilla’s subtle but growing selfhood.\n\nAs beloved as Godzilla is, it failed to bring back any other Toho creations. Big hitters like Ghidorah and Mothra are nowhere to be found in the cartoon on account of the fact that licensing them would have been too pricey. To get around this obstacle, though, the staff periodically conceived parallels to Toho’s classic kaijū. There are those monsters whose references are subtle or obscure — Megapede, a prodigious breed of spider and a gigantic turtle respectively bear physical traits of Battra, Kumonga and Kamoebas — while others, such as Quetzalcoatl (Rodan), Robo-Yeti (Mechani-Kong) and Cyber-Godzilla (Mechagodzilla and Mecha-King Ghidorah), were blatant analogs. The remainder of the monster gallery had a tendency to be oversized, run-of-the-mill fauna brought on by chemical pollution, climate change and ecocide. Jumbo bugs were especially overused in the show. Nevertheless, Fil Barlow’s superb creature designs compensated for the more generic adversaries.\n\nGodzilla: The Series was, of course, not the first animated adaptation; Hanna-Barbera’s Godzilla aired between 1978 and ‘79. In several ways, the newer cartoon is an update of the aforesaid series. Both casts traveled by boat to foreign locales and tangled with regional monstrosities, and each show had specific technology that could summon Godzilla to their rescue at a moment’s notice. The ‘70s version had a fair share of outlandish stories, yet nothing quite compared to the far-out plots of its successor. On occasion, H.E.A.T. battled aliens (in a saga akin to Destroy All Monsters) and tackled time-travel (à la Marvel’s Days of Future Past). The cartoon route made all of these more fantastical adventures easier to swallow, not to mention feasible.\n\nJeff Kline and Richard Raynis (Extreme Ghostbusters, Men in Black: The Series) faced an uphill battle when they developed this series. And despite the cartoon raking in consistently good ratings and positive reviews, it still had no chance of surviving without tie-in toys to turn a profit. The staggering amount of unsold film merchandise led to retailers refusing to sell the toys for the TV show, thus leading to its cancellation. Even so, this small-screen sequel was captivating while it lasted. The characters were likable, the writing was punchy, the animation was solid, and the monster-on-monster action was plentiful and exciting. It was simply hard not to enjoy Godzilla: The Series. Even the film’s biggest detractors were — and still are — charmed by the overall quality of this animated follow-up.\n\nAs a veteran of what we now call the “old internet,” I remember a time when the scariest media you could find online consisted of seemingly innocent image macros containing sinister details lurking in the background. Known as “mindf*ck” images, half the fun of sharing these spooky memes was the anticipation of finding whatever poorly photoshopped demon face that awaited you in the dark.\n\nYears later, I still find myself fascinated by hidden horrors and I’m clearly not the only one – as we can see by the success of films like Osgood Perkins’ Longlegs, which features its own set of demonic background scares. And in honor of this specific kind of subliminal fright, we’ve decided to come up with a list celebrating six of the freakiest hidden scares in film.\n\nFor the purposes of this list, we’ll be classifying “hidden horrors” as any easily missable background scare that isn’t necessarily meant to be caught during your first viewing. And while we’ll only be discussing movies today, I’d also like to give a shout-out to Mike Flanagan’s excellent The Haunting of Hill House series, which features some of the best subtle scares in the genre.\n\nAs usual, don’t forget to comment below with your own favorite hidden frights if you think we missed a particularly spooky one.\n\nWith that out of the way, onto the list…\n\n6. Early Crawler Reveals – The Descent (2009)\n\nSpelunking is already terrifying enough even without the presence of flesh-eating humanoids adapted to living in the cavernous dark, so it makes sense that Neil Marshall’s claustrophobic thriller about a group of women trapped in an ancient cave system is often hailed as one of the scariest movies of all time.\n\nHowever, among Marshall’s varied bag of cinematic tricks is his decision to use the dark itself to obscure terrifying details that only eagle-eyed viewers will be capable of noticing. Case in point: a lot of hardcore fans don’t realize that we’re introduced to the film’s Crawlers almost as soon as the leading ladies enter their titular descent, though these “blink-and-you’ll-miss-it” appearances are initially limited to silhouettes and shifting limbs in the shadows.\n\n5. The Faces – Midsommar (2018)\n\nFrom wall-crawling mothers to subliminal demonology, Ari Aster’s Hereditary already had its fair share of unsettling background scares, but the director’s next film would take hidden horror one step further with the use of nearly imperceptible faces that were seamlessly blended into the background of several scenes.\n\nThrough pareidolia (our species’ natural tendency to recognize familiar facial patterns among random imagery), these faces were meant to evoke a sense of subliminal unease while also hinting at the true (possibly paranormal) nature of the film’s events – as well as Dani and her family’s possible involvement with the Swedish cult.\n\n4. The Witches – The Lords of Salem (2012)\n\nDespite having repeatedly stated that his dream project is a hockey biopic about the Philadelphia Flyers, rocker-turned-filmmaker Rob Zombie has developed an inaccurate reputation as a predictable director who can only tell stories about foul-mouthed redneck murderers. Thankfully, Zombie got the chance to make at least a couple of movies that broke the Firefly Family mold, and the best of these has to be his supernatural spook-fest, The Lords of Salem.\n\nA decidedly more cerebral and surprisingly subdued project than any of the director’s other endeavors (including his underrated fable about survivor’s guilt, Halloween 2), LoS also benefits from a disturbing collection of silent jump scares as the witches stalk and taunt our troubled protagonist from the shadows of her own home – often hiding in the corner of seemingly innocuous shots.\n\nRegardless of what you think about the rest of the film, you’ve got to admit that this is Zombie’s scariest film to date.\n\n3. Background Spirals – Uzumaki (2000)\n\nIt may not be remembered as one of the J-Horror greats (mostly due to the inherent difficulty of translating stylized imagery to live-action), but Higuchinsky’s adaptation of Uzumaki is still one hell of a creepy ride. Telling the story of a town that becomes infected by supernatural spirals, the film also makes use of subliminal patterns in order to immerse viewers in the same madness as its ill-fated characters.\n\nSeveral times throughout the experience, the background imagery will subtly shift into a spiral shape without calling much attention to itself, with these transformations often being accompanied by the ghostly faces of the curse’s previous victims. The CGI isn’t always convincing, but I appreciate the eerie attention to detail here.\n\n2. Mr. Pipes – Ghostwatch (1992)\n\nA simulated live broadcast, Stephen Volk’s subversive mockumentary is still influencing horror media to this very day. From the WNUF Halloween Special to Late Night with the Devil, countless films have attempted to recapture the nostalgic horror of tuning into supposedly cursed programming, but very few have achieved the same level of believability as this surprisingly well-crafted hoax.\n\nIn fact, keeping with the grounded approach, many of the film’s scares are actually hidden deep in the background – with the most disturbing examples involving the cheekily named poltergeist, Mr. Pipes. While in-universe viewers eventually call into the show to report that they’ve seen Pipes lurking in the footage, Ghostwatch never spoils the phantom’s eerie appearances, allowing you to look for these frights at your own risk.\n\n1. Alice’s Real Ghost – Lake Mungo (2008)\n\nA masterclass in both misdirection and slow-burn Found Footage, there are plenty of reasons to love Joel Anderson’s Lake Mungo. However, despite the film’s many qualities, I think what really makes this Australian gem stand out is the fact that it remains an exceedingly rare example of hidden horror being used as a narrative tool.\n\nI won’t be going into detail about the flick’s layered use of barely visible apparitions (it’d be a shame to spoil the experience for those who haven’t yet seen the film) but suffice to say that Lake Mungo’s chilling finale will leave you second-guessing nearly every frame of the experience preceding it.\n\nNot bad for the most low-budget film on this list!"
