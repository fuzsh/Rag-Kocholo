        "text": "The “Godzilla” series of films has always interested me. Yet I understand that there is a clear line which separates audience appeal with these movies. The very first film, “Gojira” (in Japanese) was a serious attempt to deal with the tragedies of Hiroshima.\n\nDuring the 1960’s, “Godzilla” became a cult hero battling Mothra, Ghidrah, Rodan, and other villains. I must confess that even 1998’s “Godzilla” starring Matthew Broderick was one I enjoyed.\n\n“Godzilla 2000” is what the classic series was all about. This version is perhaps the first to make it to America’s big screen from Japan in 15 years. Now Godzilla is back and tougher than ever! But he is still a man in a rubber suit and the buildings and cars still look like models.\n\nThe story is styled to meet the expectations of every fan. It is a visual buffet of classic “cheese”. Japan is once again facing disaster from invaders from space. A company sponsored by the CCIA (Crisis Control Intelligence Agency) is lifting a meteor from the ocean floor. They are hoping this rock will contain a new energy source. What they discover is an alien spaceship that is activated by their lights. The spaceship becomes interested in Godzilla because of his regenerative powers. Quicker than you can say “stormchasers”, this film has the GPN (Godzilla Positioning Network) interested in discovering more about Godzilla. The GPN and the CCIA have their share of conflicts in this well crafted, but predictable movie. The CCIA tries to destroy the spaceship and Godzilla, but fails at both.\n\n“Godzilla 2000” has a few negative objections. The language is mild and the violence is similar to the Saturday morning fare. I took my nine-year-old son along to do the review. He has watched all the old Godzilla films with me. His first comment was, “Cool, dad, it’s dubbed.” This is one fun movie."
