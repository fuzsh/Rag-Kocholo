        "text": "X-Men: First Class, a vivid tapestry of action and drama, unspools the genesis of the X-Men saga. In this robust prequel, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), who are yet to become Professor X and Magneto respectively, join forces against the dire threat posed by Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Set against the backdrop of the Cold War, it showcases their transformation from close friends into bitter adversaries. The film, interspersed with thrilling sequences and notable performances, won accolades for its narrative depth and visual effects. It's an intriguing exploration of loyalty, ideology, and origin, leading up to the birth of two conflicting factions in the mutant world.\n\nNaive Midwestern prep student Jonathan (Andrew McCarthy) bonds with his more worldly roommate, Skip (Rob Lowe), who takes the small-town boy under his wing. At Skip's urging, the inexperienced Jonathan is emboldened to seek out older women in the cocktail lounges of nearby Chicago, where he meets and beds the alluring Ellen (Jacqueline Bisset), who unfortunately turns out to be Skip's mother. The division between the friends is further deepened when a cheating scandal engulfs the school.\n\nDuncan Pinderhughes (Christopher Reid) is a nerdy straight-A student with no social life, and Blade Brown (Christopher Martin) is a tough bad boy with grades so low he has little hope of graduating from high school. When a fateful mistake swaps their permanent records -- and thereby identities -- they decide to take advantage. Duncan will raise Blade's grades, and Blade will show Duncan how to be cool. However, they both start to realize that their new lives aren't what they expected.\n\nFront of the Class is a 2008 American drama film based on the book by Brad Cohen, Front of the Class: How Tourette Syndrome Made Me the Teacher I Never Had, co-authored by Lisa Wysocky. The book was made into a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie starring newcomer James Wolk—a 2007 University of Michigan graduate—and featuring Treat Williams and Emmy Award-winning actress Patricia Heaton as Cohen's parents; the movie aired on CBS on December 7, 2008.\n\nClass of 1984 is a 1982 Canadian action-thriller movie about a newly hired music teacher at a troubled inner city school, where students have to pass through a metal detector due to problems with gangs, drugs, and violence. It was directed by Mark L. Lester and starred Perry King as teacher Andrew Norris, Merrie Lynn Ross as his wife Diane Norris, Roddy McDowall as Terry Corrigan and Timothy Van Patten as Peter Stegman, the leader of the gang of thugs who terrorize the school. It was one of Michael J. Fox's early roles, before he was a well-established actor. It was a major box-office success for its time making more than 20 million dollars in the US alone on a budget of four and half million, and was the number one film in many countries worldwide on release. The movie utilized the punk look and image that was becoming part of popular culture in the early 1980s. The movie's theme song, \"I Am the Future\", was performed by Alice Cooper. The film also features a performance by Canadian punk band Teenage Head. The film begins with a warning that it is partially based on true events."
