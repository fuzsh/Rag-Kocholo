        "text": "It wasn’t the fire-breathing King of All Monsters that got Aaron Taylor-Johnson hooked on “Godzilla.”\n\nThe 23-year-old actor was mesmerized by writer/director Gareth Edwards’ promise that the latest reboot would be driven less by special-effects than by human characters.\n\nWith a varied filmography that includes everything from playing John Lennon in “Nowhere Boy” to portraying the title role in “Kick-Ass” to partnering Keira Knightley in “Anna Karenina,” Taylor-Johnson decided to trust his instincts.\n\n“I sat down with Gareth the first time and we just didn’t stop talking for six hours about our love of film and how he wanted to shoot ‘Godzilla’ and where he wanted to take the characters,” says the actor. “I came out of that meeting thinking 100 percent that I wanted to be on this journey with him and everyone involved.”\n\nThe more time Taylor-Johnson spent with Edwards, the more he became fascinated with the history of “Godzilla,” which was created by Japan’s Toho Studios in 1954 as a metaphor for nuclear-age anxieties.\n\nHe didn’t see the original until Edwards said he wanted to embrace the origin story in his movie. “Godzilla,” now playing in area theaters, both hints at the mammoth creature’s beginnings as well as the reasons why he’s reappearing.\n\nTaylor-Johnson stars as a Naval officer who has just reunited with his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and son (Carson Bolde) in San Francisco when he’s summoned to Japan to help his nuclear engineer father (“Breaking Bad’s” Bryan Cranston) deal with impending disaster. The cast also includes Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn and Juliette Binoche.\n\nTaylor-Johnson might not have begun work on “Godzilla” as a fan of the giant lizard but he came away happy to be a part of what could be a new franchise.\n\n“I think it’s a brilliant emotional journey for the characters” through a natural disaster, Taylor-Johnson says.\n\nThe CGI-created Godzilla stands 355 feet tall, which makes him the biggest Godzilla in cinematic history. He’s a big departure from the creature played by a latex-suited actor named Hario Nakajima in the original film.\n\nIn the years since Godzilla let loose his first fiery breath, Toho has turned out 28 films starring the beast. There have also been other reboots as well, including 1998’s “Godzilla” starring Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno.\n\nJust like Taylor-Johnson, actress Elizabeth Olsen (“Oldboy”) jumped aboard “Godzilla” because she was fascinated with the story’s human dimensions.\n\n“I think preparation for this film largely was just making sure that the family wasn’t too stereotyped,” says Olsen. “The characters had to be broad enough ... to reach a world audience but also specific enough and rooted and grounded in a relationship so that you could get behind [them]. That was [the] conversation that never stopped between Gareth, Aaron and I.”\n\nJohnson was similarly committed to making sure his character felt authentic. Before production began, he underwent training with military advoser James D. Dever, a retired major in the Marines.\n\nWhile both Taylor-Johnson and Edwards have toiled on special-effects-heavy films before, Olsen was a newbie when it came to acting alongside creatures who weren’t really there.\n\n“Gareth comes from special effects,” says the actress, 25. “Instead of working for a production company, he worked for a special effects company. So he had confidence in that, fully, and he had confidence also in working with the actors. He also made us feel like he was there for the story. I never felt overpowered or overshadowed by special effects.”\n\nOddly enough, “Godzilla” helped Olson prepare for her work on 2015’s “The Avengers: The Age of Ultron,” in which she’ll play Scarlet Witch, the twin sister of Taylor-Johnson’s Quicksilver.\n\n“Aaron and I spent time together in Vancouver and I got to know his family,” she says, referencing the actor’s wife, director Sam Taylor-Wood, and their two toddler daughters. “I think we both like the fact that we have this other film in our repertoire.”\n\nOlsen made her first appearance as Scarlet Witch at the end of “Captain America,” in which “The Age of Ultron” was teased. Even though production has begun on the latest Marvel adventure, the actress is still perusing as many comics as she can get her hands on.\n\n“For me it was like, ‘Throw it all in!’ she says. “I’m the first human interpretation of The Scarlet Witch so you want to be able to honor the cartoons and comics but also bring your own thing to it ... It’s been a really fun process and awesome because she’s so dope.”"
