        "text": "So sad to learn of Michael Lerner’s passing!\n\nI met him a couple of times. The first was in the 1990’s in my L.A. neighborhood laserdisc store, he was not particularly warm and friendly to say the least. The second time was at the Antiquarian Book Fair in Pasadena, probably in 2018. Of course I mentioned how much I loved his studio chief role in Barton Fink. Much to my shock he pulled me in and gave me a big hug! Then he tried to peddle books for his book dealer friend who he had been speaking with when I approached, but it wasn’t the kind of stock that appealed to me.\n\nRIP Michael Lerner, your one famous role was an iconic one that will be enjoyed by many for years to come.\n\nJust saw him in The Missiles of October as Pierre Salinger. I remember as a kid watching him in Sara T - Portrait of a Teenage Alcohlic which was made around the same time. He was also in John and Yoko's film Smile.\n\nAlways a reliable actor. RIP.\n\nWonderful actor. I can't speak to any one role that impressed me but whenever I saw him, I knew he would be the most interesting character to watch. He had a capacity to move between seething anger and subtle empathy quickly. Thank you Michael."
