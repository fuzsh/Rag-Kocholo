        "text": "Roger Ebert reviews Godzilla 1985 (1984).\n\nIn 1996, I started watching Siskel & Ebert, the movie review program with the nation's leading film critics. I liked movies, and they were guys who talked about movies. It didn't take long for me to consider the show indispensable, and I soon found myself enjoying learning as much as I could about these two critics, almost as much as I enjoyed watching the movies they reviewed.\n\nNaturally, as a lifelong Godzilla fan, I became intrigued about their opinions about the genre. In the mid- and late '90s, gathering that kind of information wasn't easy, and it took years (and even decades) to learn the things contained in this blog post.\n\nAnd that's today's topic: What did Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert think of the various Asian monster movies they watched? I've compiled as much as I could about their comments regarding Japanese (and Hong Kong) monster movies and other tokusatsu productions in an effort to be as comprehensive as possible.\n\nGene Siskel and Roger Ebert outside of the Pickwick Theatre in Park Ridge, IL.\n\nThe pair's connection to the more obscure aspects of kaiju eiga is actually quite fascinating. In fact, the intro to the Tribune Media version of their show (called At the Movies) from 1982 through 1986 was shot at the Pickwick Theatre in Park Ridge, Illinois, which later became infamous for its summer screenings of low-quality tokusatsu DVDs. While that may not a direct connection to the genre by any means, it's certainly worth mentioning here.\n\nA still from King Kong Escapes (1967) as seen during the introduction of Opening Soon at a Theater Near You.\n\nIf we want to find all their references to Godzilla and other kaiju, it turns out that we have to go back at least to the very first show that Siskel and Ebert ever hosted. That show was the November 1975 episode of Opening Soon at a Theater Near You, which was shown on the PBS affiliate WTTW Chicago. In the intro, stills from both King Kong Escapes (1967) and Destroy All Monsters (1968) are included in the opening montage that mostly features images from classic Hollywood films.\n\nA still from Destroy All Monsters (1968) as seen during the introduction of Opening Soon at a Theater Near You.\n\nBy early 1976 (when the pair reviewed Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver), both stills remained in the intro. By the end of the year, however, only the frame from King Kong Escapes was still included.\n\nIn early 1977, when naming A*P*E (1976) one of the worst movies of the year on the program, Siskel quipped:\n\nYou know, they said this picture shouldn't be confused with King Kong. Hell, it shouldn't be confused with Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster!\n\nRegaled for 50 years by the stupendous idiocy of the American version of \"Godzilla,\" audiences can now see the original Japanese version, which is equally idiotic, but, properly decoded, was the \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" of its time. Both films come after fearsome attacks on their nations, embody urgent warnings, and even incorporate similar dialogue, such as \"The report is of such dire importance it must not be made public.\" Is that from 1954 Tokyo or 2004 Washington?\n\nThe comparison to Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004) always baffled me, but perhaps director Michael Moore was inspired by the dead rabbit in Ishiro Honda's Frankenstein Conquers the World (1965) for the infamous \"pets or meat\" scene in Roger & Me (1989).\n\nEbert continues:\n\nIn these days of flawless special effects, Godzilla and the city he destroys are equally crude. Godzilla at times looks uncannily like a man in a lizard suit, stomping on cardboard sets, as indeed he was, and did. Other scenes show him as a stuffed, awkward animatronic model. This was not state of the art even at the time; \"King Kong\" (1933) was much more convincing.\n\nI've never quite understood the argument by Kong or Harryhausen fanatics that stop-motion animation is more \"state of the art\" than suit-acting. I mean, would they also argue that, for example, Jack the Giant Killer (1962), with its stop-motion effects, is superior to Alien (1979) or Predator (1987), both of which utilize a guy in a suit? Whatever you may think about the type of SFX that brought the original King Kong and Godzilla to life, I think it would be very hard to argue that the former film had better miniature effects than the latter.\n\nCritics of the Godzilla series usually argue that the man in the suit always looks like a man in the suit, but the fact that Kong and every other stop-motion creation by O'Brien and Harryhausen look like animated puppets is never a point of criticism, which I find bemusing. Sure, it's probably more time-consuming and painstaking than putting on a suit and going to town, but the effect is no more realistic just because it's time-consuming. The miniature cityscapes featured in tokusatsu productions are some of the most detailed and intricate you will find in any film, yet they are always laughed off as \"cardboard sets,\" sight unseen. What happened to their appreciation of time-consuming and painstaking artistry?\n\nEnough of that tangent. Our heroic critic continues further:\n\nWhen Dr. Serizawa demonstrates the Oxygen Destroyer to the fiancee of his son, the superweapon is somewhat anticlimactic. He drops a pill into a tank of tropical fish, the tank lights up, he shouts \"stand back!,\" the fiancee screams, and the fish go belly up. Yeah, that'll stop Godzilla in his tracks.\n\nAnd it does! Ebert sums up his review thus:\n\nThis is a bad movie, but it has earned its place in history, and the enduring popularity of Godzilla and other monsters shows that it struck a chord.\n\nYeah, I don't know, either, guys. I'll admit that I do find G54 a bit overpraised and overcited these days, but this is a review by an old dude set in his ways who will only see this genre one way -- cheesy, goofy fun that has nothing to say through its badly-dubbed lips.\n\nA few months after Ebert published his newspaper review, there was a response to it in one of the Godzilla fan rags that used Ebert's health issues (that a couple of years later would rob him of his voice) to explain why he didn't like the movie. I thought that was disgusting then, and I still do. Disagree with Roger all you want -- and I certainly do -- but to suggest that only an unhealthy individual could find fault with the original Godzilla is beyond the pale.\n\nAs mentioned at the very beginning of this blog post, Hong Kong monster movies also got their moment in the Sun from Chicagoland's greatest film reviewers. Here's how it all started.\n\nIn his review of Infra-Man, Ebert writes:\n\nAnd so we're off and running, in the best movie of its kind since Invasion of the Bee Girls. I'm a pushover for monster movies anyway, but Infra-Man has it all: Horrendous octopus men, a gigantic beetle man with three eyes who sprays his victims with sticky cocoons, savage robots with coiled spring necks that can extend ten feet, a venomous little critter that looks like a hairy mutant footstool, elaborately staged karate fights, underground throne rooms, damsels in distress, exploding volcanoes, and a whip-cracking villainess named Princess Dragon Mom (Philip Wylie, please note).\n\nThese may be the only words of genuine praise Ebert has written about a live-action Asian monster movie:\n\nThe movie even looks good: It's a classy, slick production by the Shaw Brothers, the Hong Kong kung fu kings. When they stop making movies like Infra-Man, a little light will go out of the world.\n\nOn their TV show Sneak Previews, the pair hosted a special episode called \"Take 2: Guilty Pleasures\" (1979). On this episode, Ebert quipped:\n\nInfra-Man was produced by Hong Kong's leading sultans of schlock: two brothers named Run Run Shaw and Runme Shaw, and this time they really outran themselves.\n\nWell, at least he didn't say something truly silly like \"the Korean Infra-Man.\"\n\nInfra-Man would be brought up again by Ebert in the \"Guilty Pleasures\" episode aired on Siskel & Ebert in 1987. Interestingly, the pair would have this exchange on the show:\n\nSISKEL: Actually, I think there was a film similar to it called Ultraman. But, anyway...\n\nEBERT: A rip-off, probably.\n\nSISKEL: No, no, I think that one came first.\n\nSiskel goes on to point out that he enjoys the pose Infra-Man makes when he fires his beam. The results leave a lot to be desired.\n\nGene Siskel imitates Infra-Man's pose (and doesn't get it quite right).\n\nIn his 1999 review of Mighty Peking Man (1977), Ebert writes:\n\n\"Mighty Peking Man,\" made in 1977, is being re-released by Quentin Tarantino's Rolling Thunder Pictures, and we can only imagine young QT behind the counter of that legendary video store of his youth, watching this on the monitor and realizing he'd struck gold.\n\nActually, I think Tarantino jockeyed the desk at the video store, dreaming about the throngs of backyard moviemakers who would artistically handwave in front of tens of people at local \"film festivals\" as they enthusiastically described themselves as \"Tarantino types.\"\n\nEbert finishes his newspaper MPM review thus:\n\nI am awarding \"Mighty Peking Man\" three stars, for general goofiness and a certain level of insane genius, but I cannot in good conscience rate it higher than \"Infra-Man.\" So, in answer to those correspondents who ask if I have ever changed a rating on a movie: Yes, \"Infra-Man\" moves up to three stars.\n\nEbert also reviewed MPM on his TV program in early 1999 with Harry Knowles as his guest co-host (following the sudden death of Gene Siskel). The review doesn't contain any interesting comments that are worth quoting, other than Ebert repeats his view that sometimes \"bad\" special effects are more fun to watch than good ones and that he also really likes Infra-Man, which was made by the same studio.\n\nGotta admit here that I never quite understood the generally positive reaction to Mighty Peking Man, whether it was being promoted as a camp classic (as Ebert does here) or as a legitimately good movie in the Asian monster movie fan press (which I find even more bizarre). For sheer entertainment value, I've always considered A*P*E the superior choice. But to each his own.\n\nWith all that out of the way, all that's left is the miscellany. Mostly, it's a collection of irrelevant references to Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster and Infra-Man in reviews where they kind of don't belong. But it's worth a look, so here we go.\n\nIn his review of Battle of the Amazons (1973), Ebert writes:\n\nNo movie in the last 20 years has been dubbed more ineptly. No, not even \"Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster.\"\n\nThat was the first documented reference to Smog Monster that I could find. But the movie comes up again in Ebert's review of Tidal Wave (1975), which of course was just the Americanization of Submersion of Japan (1973). Ebert opens with:\n\nBad movies are really getting awful these days. It seems like only yesterday we were savoring bombs like \"The Vengeance of She\" and \"Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster\" movies so terrible they achieved a sort of greatness.\n\nEbert continues:\n\nI was hoping 'Tidal Wave\" would be a movie like that. When the publicity photographs arrived in the mail a few weeks ago, I was heartened by the sight of the staples holding together the cardboard skyscrapers: Here was a movie with real lack of promise!\n\nRemember what I said a moment ago about Toho's miniature work? Anyway, here, Ebert raises the ire of every Godzilla message board troll who takes it upon himself to police the overall fandom's opinion about who really won at the end of King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962):\n\nIt even looked like a good bet to outflank \"King Kong vs. Godzilla.\" (What happened in that one, as I recall, is that King Kong lost and is currently trying to promote a bout with the Smog Monster, to establish himself as a contender once again.)\n\nNext, Ebert proves you don't need a guy in a rubber suit in order to trash tokusatsu tactics:\n\nBut \"Tidal Wave\" let me down. It is purely and simply a wretched failure, a feeble attempt to paste together inept special effects (filmed in Japan) and Lorne Greene (filmed in America to his everlasting regret, I'll bet).\n\nEbert was as fit as a fiddle at the time he wrote that, so we can't blame his opinion on any illness. Now let's get back to Smog Monster references.\n\nIn his review of God Told Me To (1976), Ebert writes:\n\nNot since \"Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster\" had a press release promised so much.\n\nIn his review of Slithis (1978), we get a Roger Ebert double whammy when he offers:\n\nI did, however, enter the theater, hoping for one of those great bad movies like “Godzilla vs. The Smog Monster” or the immortal “Infra-Man.” I was disappointed.\n\nWow, a Smog Monster and Infra-Man reference in the same review! I guess Christmas came a bit early for readers of the Chicago Sun-Times. Let's skip ahead a view years to Rog's newspaper review of The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), in which Ebert writes:\n\nThe film's structure is weird. I thought it was over, and then it began again, with a San Diego sequence in which Spielberg seemed to be trying to upstage the upcoming \"Godzilla'' movie. The monster-stepping-on-cars sequences in the current Japanese import \"Gamera: Guardian of the Universe'' are more entertaining.\n\nI remember reading the above review in real time and thinking how interesting it was seeing Ebert essentially side with Godzilla and Gamera over Spielberg's latest offering. Out of context, it may seem somewhat impressive. In context, however, I think we all know how things really are.\n\nWhile we're on the subject, in his Movie Answer Man column from June 15, 1997, Ebert responds to a reader's question about whether the scene featuring evacuating Japanese businessmen in The Lost World: Jurassic Park might have been a bit racist:\n\nI laughed, too. Spielberg is obviously basing an affectionate in-joke on the Japanese monster movie genre, and no racism was intended or should be found. By the way, your financee should know that fans of Japanese monster movies think they're better than \"Lost World.\"\n\nOh, hey, look! Gamera's back in Ebert's review of Armageddon (1998):\n\nAfter meteors turn an entire street into a flaming wasteland, the woman complains, \"I want to go shopping!\" I hope in Japan that line is redubbed as \"Nothing can save us but Gamera!\"\n\nBelow is a grab bag of Infra-Man references. In his review of The Manitou (1978), Ebert closes his review with:\n\nWhat's interesting is that “The Manitou” finds it necessary to claim a factual basis for itself, at the end of easily the least plausible thriller since, oh, “Infra-Man.”\n\nIn Ebert's review of Flash Gordon (1980), he opens with:\n\nNot since \"Infra-Man\" has a movie opened with a development more ominous than the crisis facing Earth at the beginning of \"Flash Gordon.\"\n\nIn his Swamp Thing (1982) review, Ebert comments:\n\nThis is one of those movies like \"Infra-Man\" or \"Invasion of the Bee Girls\": an off-the-wall, eccentric, peculiar movie fueled by the demented obsessions of its makers.\n\nIn Ebert's review of If Looks Could Kill (1991), he writes:\n\nI'm so accustomed to the badness of the movies in the spy-spoof genre that it took me a while to realize that William Dear and Darren Star, the director and writer, were sincerely trying to go over the top - that like the makers of such films as \"In Like Flint,\" \"Invasion of the Bee Girls\" and the immortal \"Infra-Man,\" they indeed had an unholy light glinting in their eye, and were making a subversive film rather than following a formula.\n\nIn his review of Mars Attacks! (1996), he writes:\n\nEd Wood himself could have told us what's wrong with this movie: The makers felt superior to the material. To be funny, even schlock has to believe in itself. Go to a video store and look for “Infra-Man” or “Invasion of the Bee Girls,” and you will find movies that lack stars and big budgets and fancy special effects, but are funny and fun in a way that Burton's megaproduction never really understands.\n\nLast (and certainly least), Ebert received this message from one of his readers in his November 4, 2001, Movie Answer Man column:\n\nForget the theory that \"K-Pax\" was borrowed from the Argentinean film :\"Man Facing Southeast.\" The idea of a psychiatrist examining a patient who claims to be an alien dates back even further. \"Ghidrah, The Three-Headed Monster\" (1964) stars Akiko Wakabayashi as the princess of Salgina. Upon hearing a mysterious voice, she gains prophetic powers and claims to be a Martian (Venusian in the Japanese version). She is taken to a psychiatrist played by the late, great Takashi Shimura, who comes to the conclusion that there is nothing wrong with her, but he refuses to accept the notion that she is an alien. (Brett Homenick, Spring Valley CA)\n\nTo which the man himself replied:\n\nTakashi Shimura starred in \"Ikiru,\" \"The Seven Samurai,\" \"Hidden Fortress\" and \"Kwaidan,\" four of the greatest films of all time. I have to go with his diagnosis.\n\nAnd that's a wrap.\n\nI'm sure many will be quick to cry racism, but I think that charge misses the mark. Ebert was quick to praise many other Japanese movies as superior works of art. His \"blind spot\" seems pretty much limited to movies with guys in monster suits, which, in fairness, probably do appear quite silly to most normies.\n\nI'm sure there are things I missed, but this is about as complete as I could make it. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading!"
