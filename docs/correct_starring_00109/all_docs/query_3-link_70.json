        "text": "1. Citizen Kane (1941) - RKO\n\nDirector: Orson Welles\n\nStars: Orson Welles; Joseph Cotten; Everett Sloane, Agnes Moorehead\n\nSynopsis: Welles' first feature - the tragic story of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Welles), loosely modeled after the life of William Randolph Hearst, founder of the Hearst publishing empire, and the publisher's ultimately empty rise to power. Acclaimed for its innovative narrative structure, deep focus cinematography, soundtrack, literate screenplay, and nuanced portrayal of the central character.\n\n2. Casablanca (1942) - Warner Bros.\n\nDirector: Michael Curtiz\n\nStars: Humphrey Bogart; Ingrid Bergman; Claude Rains; Paul Henreid; Dooley Wilson\n\nSynopsis: Romantic drama of wartime sacrifice set in Nazi-occupied French Morocco. Bogart, as jaded and cynical American idealist saloonkeeper/nightclub owner Rick Blaine, sacrifices the love of a lifetime to join the world's fight against the Nazis. When the picture debuted, it marked the beginning of a beautiful friendship with generations of moviegoers. With a crackling script and the classic song, \"As Time Goes By.\" Academy Award for Best Picture. \"Here's looking at you, kid.\"\n\n3. The Godfather (1972) - Paramount\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nStars: Marlon Brando; Al Pacino; James Caan; Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton\n\nSynopsis: Tragic, romantic saga of Mob boss Don Corleone and the rise of his successor, son Michael (Pacino). Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, the film reimagined the genre of the Mob drama. It was marked by taut suspense, rich period detail, and memorable dialogue (\"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse\"). Brando is Don Vito Corleone, the sympathetic Godfather of a New York crime family, whose business it is to make offers people can't refuse. Visually beautiful images of times and locales contrast with the film's graphic violence. It won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor, among others.\n\n4. Gone With The Wind (1939) - MGM\n\nDirector: Victor Fleming\n\nStars: Clark Gable; Vivien Leigh; Olivia de Havilland; Leslie Howard; Hattie McDaniel\n\nSynopsis: Based on Margaret Mitchell's best-selling \"Immortal tale of the old South\" - the inimitable epic of Civil War destruction and the ill-fated romance between Scarlett O'Hara (Leigh) and Rhett Butler (Gable). Endures as a compelling story and an example of studio era greatness. The burning of Atlanta was a high water mark for screen excitement. As poet Ogden Nash put it, \"The Civil War was quite a fight and not a mere diversion; I never knew how tough it was before Dave Selznick's version.\" It won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director, Actress, and Supporting Actress.\n\n5. Lawrence of Arabia (1962) - Columbia\n\nDirector: David Lean\n\nStars: Peter O'Toole; Alec Guinness; Anthony Quinn; Omar Sharif; Jose Ferrer\n\nSynopsis: Majestic adventure and character drama - the epic story of T. E. Lawrence, an enigmatic British officer/mapmaker who transformed himself into the leader of a WWI Arab revolt against Turkey during World War I. The film became renowned for Lean's direction and Freddie Young's cinematography. Based on T. E. Lawrence's memoir Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Winner of many Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\n6. The Wizard of Oz (1939) - MGM\n\nDirector: Victor Fleming\n\nStars: Judy Garland; Ray Bolger; Margaret Hamilton; Bert Lahr; Jack Haley; Frank Morgan\n\nSynopsis: Magical adaptation of L. Frank Baum's children's fantasy of an enchanted land made Garland a major star. Garland's Dorothy Gale is transported from her black-and-white Kansas home to the colorful land of Oz via tornado. From here she journeys down the Yellow Brick Road and is helped by a Scarecrow, a Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion on their way to see the Wizard. The Harold Arlen/E. Yip Harburg score is highlighted by \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" - a song that became a popular standard. Inventive use of color and special effects are still impressive today. A children's movie for all ages.\n\n7. The Graduate (1967) - Embassy\n\nDirector: Mike Nichols\n\nStars: Dustin Hoffman; Anne Bancroft; Katharine Ross\n\nSynopsis: Black comedy of aimless, recent college graduate Benjamin (Hoffman) that defined a generation and established Hoffman as a star. Hoffman spends his summer trying to find out what to do next in this biting comedy. Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson has some ideas, and they're not about plastics. Hoffman's reactions to her advances and his attempts to be suave are among the film's funniest moments, and her seduction of Benjamin is withering and hilarious. The evocative Simon and Garfunkel score, that includes \"Mrs. Robinson,\" is as much a character in the movie as Bancroft's amorous Mrs. Robinson or Ross' lovely Elaine. Nichols won an Academy Award for Best Director.\n\n8. On The Waterfront (1954) - Columbia\n\nDirector: Elia Kazan\n\nStars: Marlon Brando; Karl Malden; Lee J. Cobb; Eva Marie Saint, Rod Steiger\n\nSynopsis: Gritty drama of union corruption memorable for Brando's sensitive performance as a misfit dockworker-longshoreman, epitomized in the backseat scene in which he cries, \"I could've been a contender.\" He rebels against his brother and corruption on New York City's docks in this powerful story that mirrors the political climate of the early 1950s. Winner of Academy Awards for Best Picture, Actor, and Supporting Actress, among others.\n\n9. Schindler's List (1993) - Amblin Entertainment/Universal\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nStars: Liam Neeson; Ralph Fiennes; Ben Kingsley\n\nSynopsis: Somber, inspiring adaptation of Thomas Kenneally's fact-based book about an opportunistic Catholic industrialist (Neeson) able to save several hundred Polish Jews from death camps during World War II by hiring them to work in his factory. Memorable performances all around, particularly by Fiennes, who plays a brutal Nazi officer. \"The list is life.\" Winner of Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director, among others.\n\n10. Singin' In The Rain (1952) - MGM\n\nDirector: Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen\n\nStars: Gene Kelly; Debbie Reynolds; Donald O'Connor, Jean Hagen\n\nSynopsis: Kelly makes a splash as Don Lockwood, a Hollywood leading man who reflects on the production of The Dueling Cavalier - a film that becomes The Dancing Cavalier when the studio takes advantage of a new invention called sound. Reynolds and O'Connor are his energetic, supportive sidekicks, helping to devise a clever way to cover the grating voice of his co-star Lina Lamont, played by Hagen. Furious when she learns of their plan, Lina asserts herself by screaming, \"Why, I make more money than, than Calvin Coolidge! Put together!\" Delightful musical send-up of the transition-conversion from silent to sound films, with many memorable and delightful song and dance musical numbers, including \"Make 'Em Laugh,\" \"Broadway Rhythm,\" and the incomparable title song. This musical set in Hollywood has Kelly singing, dancing and splashing in puddles.\n\n11. It's A Wonderful Life (1946) - RKO\n\nDirector: Frank Capra\n\nStars: James Stewart; Donna Reed; Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, Henry Travers\n\nSynopsis: Moving fable of disillusioned family man (Stewart) who is visited by a guardian angel (Travers) and shown what the world would be like if he had never been born. This notable Christmas classic features a complex, engrossing, Everyman performance by Stewart as George Bailey, a suicidal man redeemed by friendship and the recognition that each person's life touches many others. Remember every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings. Favorite film of both Capra and Stewart.\n\n12. Sunset Boulevard (1950) - Paramount\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nStars: Gloria Swanson; William Holden; Erich von Stroheim, Cecil B. DeMille\n\nSynopsis: The caustic, tragic noir about a screenwriter (Holden) and the deluded silent star (Swanson) who ensnares him. Swanson is ready for her close-up in this pungent slice of Hollywood life depicting a reclusive, former silent screen actress who kills her screenwriting, gigolo boyfriend. The film won three Academy Awards, including Best Screenplay. Memorable line: \"I am big. It's the pictures that got small.\"\n\n13. The Bridge On The River Kwai (1957) - Columbia\n\nDirector: David Lean\n\nStars: William Holden; Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Sessue Hayakawa\n\nSynopsis: Dark World War II drama about stiff-backed, rigid British POW colonel (Guinness), his equally unyielding Japanese captor (Hayakawa), and the bridge that embodies the absurdities of war. Guinness refuses to bow to torture in a Japanese prison camp during World War II, and Holden is an American who escapes from the camp, then must return to sabotage a bridge constructed to perfection by inspired POWs under Guinness' command. Winner of Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, among others. Memorable use of World War II song and the \"Colonel Bogey March.\"\n\n14. Some Like It Hot (1959) - Ashton/Mirisch\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nStars: Jack Lemmon; Tony Curtis; Marilyn Monroe, Joe E. Brown, George Raft\n\nSynopsis: Hilarious comedy about 1920s musicians (Lemmon and Curtis) who witness the 1928 St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago, then join all-female band and evade killers. Wilder's comic take provided sex symbol Monroe with two of her most unusual rivals, Curtis and Lemmon in drag. Memorable throughout, especially for the last line, \"Well, nobody's perfect.\" Adapted screenplay by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond, for which they won Academy Awards.\n\n15. Star Wars (1977) - 20th Century Fox\n\nDirector: George Lucas\n\nStars: Mark Hamill; Harrison Ford; Carrie Fisher; Alec Guinness\n\nSynopsis: Spectacular space adventure combined a simple story of good vs. evil with stunning visual effects and endearing robotic characters to revolutionize the science fiction and action genres and make a star of Harrison Ford. A landmark science fiction fantasy about a young man, Luke Skywalker (Hamill), who finds his calling as a Jedi warrior and with the help of \"droids\" and an outlaw named Han Solo (Ford), then embarks on a mission to rescue a princess (Fisher) and save the galaxy from the Dark Side. \"May the force be with you.\" Two sequels and prequels followed.\n\n16. All About Eve (1950) - 20th Century Fox\n\nDirector: Joseph L. Mankiewicz\n\nStars: Bette Davis; Anne Baxter; George Sanders; Celeste Holm; Thelma Ritter\n\nSynopsis: Classic story of backstage betrayal, with Davis as the aging star Margo Channing and Baxter as the young schemer Eve Harrington. Fasten your seat belts for a bumpy ride in this story of an aging actress who is undone by a young, ambitious fan.
