Mura is a municipality in the province of Barcelona and autonomous community of Catalonia, Spain. Located at 454 m above sea level, it is one of the main entrances to the Natural Park of Sant Llorenç del Munt i l’Obac.

Places of interest

Mura forms a pleasant set of cobbled squares and alleys, and stone houses, many of which have been prepared for holidays or weekend stays, due to the interest of the environment.

Near Mura, in a frame of scattered farmhouses, the unusual site of the Balma hill stands out, with buildings built inside a large balma that houses a small museum and an agro-tourism centre.

On the outskirts of the village there is the church of Santa Creu de Palou, in Romanesque style.
