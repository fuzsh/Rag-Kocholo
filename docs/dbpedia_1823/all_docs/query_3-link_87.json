        "text": "The location marker is placed on Mura. [More]\n\nThe real-time satellite image combines visible light during daytime with infrared radiation during nighttime. At night, the image is not dark as infrared radiation can detect temperature differences. Unfortunately, low clouds and fog are difficult to distinguish from ground temperatures and thus can be almost invisible during the night. Meteosat satellite images for Europe are updated in real-time every 5 minutes. GOES-16/GOES-17 (North & South America) and Himawari (Asia) images update every 10 minutes.\n\nPrecipitation is estimated from radar and satellites. Precipitation estimates from satellites are less accurate at night than during daytime."
