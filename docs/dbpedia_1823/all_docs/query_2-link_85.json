It is one of the beaches of Trapani settlement, just 0.9 km from its center. The beach is located in an urban area with very picturesque views.\n\nAverage Reviews rating\n\n7.5 Very good\n\nLK\n\nLena Kowalska\n\nUser status ‚Ä¢ Novice Beachgoer\n\n4 Frustrating\n\nThe pungent odor of decaying algae permeated the air, deterring us from lingering any longer at the beach. As a result, we opted not to stay.\n\nLR\n\nLorenzo Renzi.\n\nUser status ‚Ä¢ Novice Beachgoer\n\n6 Pleasant\n\nThis supposed beach had the potential to be a real gem, but unfortunately it's overrun with more seagrass and dirt than actual sand. It's a real shame that such a beautiful location has been left neglected and unattended. Perhaps the local authorities should invest in some proper maintenance and clean-up efforts. Until then, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time here.\n\nEF\n\nEnzo Ferruzzi\n\nUser status ‚Ä¢ Novice Beachgoer\n\n6 Pleasant\n\nThe beachfront promenade is a lovely place to stroll, but it's disheartening to see the amount of litter that's been carelessly discarded, posing a risk to marine life such as the seagulls that inhabit this area. It's a shame that people don't take responsibility for their waste and instead choose to spoil the natural beauty of this location.\n\nKM\n\nKira Mendoza\n\nUser status ‚Ä¢ Novice Beachgoer\n\n10 Exceptional\n\nThis location left us in awe during our visit in July 2019, coinciding with the Stragusto street food festival. The ambiance was exceptional, with a delightful atmosphere, immaculate surroundings, and an exquisite beach nestled beneath the walls. Moreover, the scenic view from the wall was breathtaking, making it a truly remarkable experience.\n\nKA\n\nK. Andersson\n\nUser status ‚Ä¢ Novice Beachgoer\n\n10 Exceptional\n\nThe coastline boasts a magnificent one kilometer stretch of the ancient Spanish wall, a remnant of the era when they ruled over this region of Sicily. The panoramic vistas and photo opportunities are simply breathtaking. The tranquil sound of the waves lapping against the shore is a soothing balm for the soul, especially when the beach is not teeming with visitors."
