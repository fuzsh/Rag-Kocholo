        "text": "What is Shizenjin Mura?\n\nWhen translated literally from Japanese to English, \"Shizenjin Mura\" becomes \"Natural (shizen) Person (jin) Village (mura).\"\n\nInspired by the Japanese concept of \"arinomama,\" or \"things as they are,\"\n\nShizenjin Mura is a wilderness resort where guests are invited to come as they are and reconnect with nature and themselves.\n\nSituated in the Akigawa Valley surrounded by mountains,\n\nShizenjin Mura guests can look forward to rich forest air, clear mountain streams, and farm to table local produce.\n\nCustom built from the wood of trees local to the Tama region of Tokyo,\n\nour private outdoor sauna is the perfect place to rejuvenate your body and mind.\n\nJoin us in creating a healing atmosphere and a community born through shared experiences in the great outdoors.\n\nOur Wilderness Values\n\nProtecting the inherent wildness of nature and placing value on preserving the natural landscape \"as it is.\"\n\nWe endeavor to build with, not against, the trees and plants that have taken root in the natural world, and hope that our buildings can grow old with their natural surroundings.\n\nBy adopting a design that blends in with the rich natural environment, we aim to create a beautiful space that takes advantage of the natural atmosphere.\n\nPromoting the charm of the Fukusawa area - Tokyo’s hidden gem.\n\nThe Fukasawa area is an attractive place for those looking to experience the excitement of visiting a largely unexplored part of Tokyo. Re-imagined as \"Wilderness TOKYO,\" we at Shizenjin Mura hope to support the further growth of the Fukusawa area by serving as a port of entry for tourists and locals alike.\n\nWe welcome you explore the unexplored.\n\nBuilding upon the philosophies and goals of the previous generation.\n\nShizenjin Mura was founded and named by the current owner's father's generation. Inspired by the Japanese concept of \"arinomama,\" or \"things as they are,\" he wanted to create a space for people to experience the healing powers of nature and \"return to their true selves.\"\n\nWe strive to provide a place for people to come, unwind, and renew - leaving the property refreshed and ready to welcome a new day.\n\nBoasting a barrel sauna made completely from locally sourced lumber from the Tama region, our Private Outdoor Sauna makes the most of Shizenjin Mura's overflowing natural beauty. After an intense sauna session, guests are invited to take a refreshing dip in the clear stream flowing right below the sauna area to truly experience peak relaxation. The sauna area also boasts a shower booth, wooden cold bath, and original relaxation bench from which you can enjoy the sounds of the river, the chirping of birds, and the calling of insects. There is no doubt that after a session in our sauna, both your body and mind will be fully rejuvenated."
