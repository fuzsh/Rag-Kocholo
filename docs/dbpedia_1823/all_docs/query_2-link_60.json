        "text": "Meiji Mura (明治村, meaning \"Meiji Village\") is one of Japan's best open air museums, displaying over 60 buildings from the Meiji Period (1868-1912). This era followed the end of Japan's feudal age, and its architecture is characterized by a strong influx of Western architecture.\n\nThe theme park-like museum is located in Inuyama, one hour outside of Nagoya, in a vast wooded area next to Iruka Pond. It takes at least half a day to explore the spacious museum grounds and cover all of its exhibits.\n\nFew of the buildings constructed in the Meiji Period survive in Japan today, as most of them were destroyed during the war or lost to city redevelopment. A collection of representative buildings from across the country have been relocated to Meiji Mura in order to preserve the period's architectural and cultural heritage. Among them are the entrance hall of Tokyo's old Imperial Hotel and Kyoto's St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral."
