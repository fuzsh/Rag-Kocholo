        "text": "I don‚Äôt think elegance and majesty can be defined any better. What is this beauty?! The appearance, charisma, the gait, everything screams royalty! This is a Friesian horse. They originated in Friesland, a province in the Netherlands, and are one of the oldest horse breeds in Europe. They are known for their striking black coat color, thick mane and tail, and luxurious feathering on their lower legs. Aside from their striking features, Friesian horses are very gentle. It just complements their looks. It makes them literally perfect. They check the box for looks, gait, and charisma, and also for manners. If I were a horse, I‚Äôd be totally jealous of them. One thing that stands out for me in this video is how the foal is learning from the parent. In this scene, it's not just about the beauty and majestic appearances. It's about community, learning, and mentorship. The experienced Friesian horse, with its poise and grace, becomes a natural teacher to the curious foal. It's a beautiful display of how animals, like us, understand the importance of passing down wisdom and skills to the next generation. We have an incredible ability to learn from one another, especially when it comes to survival skills or acquiring new knowledge. We often seek guidance from those who have more experience or expertise than us in certain areas of life or work. They help us acquire or understand necessary skills and knowledge. We find these connections when we come together as communities to support one another through shared goals or challenges. Seeking help and guidance when we need it is important, and learning from people who have been there and gone through that is one of the best ways to learn. Learning is timeless, and so is teaching, and when we recognize the strength that these two wield, we build stronger communities and actively support and uplift one another. #web3 #cryptocurrency #blockchain #bitcoin #community #impact #impactinvestment #animals #wildlife #collaboration #teamwork üé•poortershoek_freisians\n\nThere are still a few spots left on our MEGABike rides (and 1 full bike if you want to bring the whole team)!

Barcelona's Alex Roca Campillo made history as the first person with a Level 5 severe disability to complete a marathon, when he finished the Barcelona Marathon on the weekend in a time of 5 hours and 54 minutes. The 32 year old has cerebral palsy due to contracting encephalitis when he was six months old which rendered 76% of the left side of his body immobile and he communicates in sign language. In the Spanish disability grading system the 5th level being over 75% - meaning a very severe disability with the individual unable to perform most daily tasks by themselves. The doctors were not confident that Alex would survive, but his hard work, determination and perseverance has allowed him to take on life and not be defined by his disability. After the race he posted on social media: \"I HAVE NO WORDS!\" Alex's mantra is \"You set your own limits, they are set by us individually.\" A wonderful perspective reset and a reminder to do what you can with what you have. #Roca #Inspiration #MarathonMan Credit: @AlexRoca91 Thx Jose Bello"
