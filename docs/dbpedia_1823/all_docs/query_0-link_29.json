        "text": "4.4/5\n\nExcellent\n\nGGuest UserWe loved our stay at the Hesperia Presidente, very good area to be based for exploring by foot or by public transport. Around fifteen minutes walk to Passeig de Gracia or similar in the other direction along Diagonal to a lovely shopping centre. The staff really go out of their way to assist and were always very friendly and informative. We were in a Junior Suite for three adults, which had a dividing door for privacy - it was initially only set up for two but this was very quickly remedied. The room was quite large, with a great bathroom/fabulous power shower! The hotel has a lovely seating area in reception which was very welcome whilst waiting for our transfer in the evening (they kept our luggage after check out with no issues at all). The area is very busy being on Diagonal but I would feel very safe travelling on my own here - lots of restaurants, bars nearby\n\nShow More\n\n4.4/5\n\nExcellent\n\nGGuest UserI stayed here for two nights in January 2022 as part of a group tour and overall had a pretty awful experience. I faced the following problems at this hotel- 1- The bathroom is open without any door so basically everyone in the room can see you inside the bathroom. This is not an ideal situation for any travelers except couples. Moreover, it ensures that the water from the shower falls into the room and makes it wet. 2- The bed provides no comforter or blanket. So when you feel cold you have to unwrap a brown paper full length cover that does not give any protection at all from the cold. 3- When you switch on the hand shower, the head shower comes on automatically, that too with ice cold water! 4- There is a large counter behind the bed to place items but when you put something on it, you get a loud metallic shrieking noise. 5- Air conditioning in the corridor outside the rooms is set to freezing temperature. 6- Breakfast timings were supposed to be from 7 am to 10 am, but when we went at 8 30 am most of the food was over and nobody was taking an interest in refilling the food. The coffee machine was not working properly. 7- We could hear everything that occurred in adjacent rooms, because soundproofing was poor. 8- We were given two separate beds in spite of being a couple. 9- Finding out which switches operate which lights was very difficult. Moreover on the first day we requested a wake up call which never came! The few positive points are- 1- Close to Fira Metro Station on the Metro Line 9 (4 minute walk) 2- Close to Gran Vía 2 shopping mall (12 minute walk) 3- Friendly and polite staff Overall I think the hotel needs to make a lot of improvements!\n\nShow More\n\n4.3/5\n\nExcellent\n\nYYISHUBecause I booked the hotel and hoped to see more information I wanted to know in the evaluation, I would like to tell everyone about my experience, I hope it will help. First, the location of the hotel is not far from Passeig de Gràcia, about 10 minutes walk. There is a diagonal subway station nearby, about 7-8 minutes walk, no 12-13 minutes to the Gracia Metro Station, Casa Batllo and La Pedrera are nearby, completely walkable, and then walk for a while To the Plaza Catalunya, Inglis is on the side of the square, the airport bus, the city tour bus are on the square, so the hotel location is good. The second is that the hotel is a star hotel, facilities and services are good, clean and tidy, I feel that my choice is good, it is recommended. Thirdly, the hotel has a breakfast room 50 meters away from the hotel. The bread and coffee are cheap and good. The hotel is 150 meters away and there is a very popular Catalan restaurant. It is long queued every day. It is only three days before we turn. A meal, tastes good, and the price is not expensive.\n\nShow More\n\n4.1/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserThis is a solid three-star hotel once you get inside. The location is perfect, right on La Rambla, close to the squares and near the cruise port. The entry is a little hard to find and sketchy to say the least. There are three hotels that occupy the building. This hotel has three of the floors. You have to go up to the first floor to get to the lobby. They have a great security system and the interior of the hotel, while dated is nice ad clean. The staff is great especially the you man that helps with the luggage. He was working very hard every time I saw him. The rooms were clean and large, and the bathrooms and showers were great. Actually, the room were very large by most European standards. Our room had a mini-fridge and a microwave as well as a small balcony that overlooked La Rambla. A great location for people watching. The breakfast was substantial, and the 24-hour free beer, wine and snacks were also great. The snacks were really meals. Salads, pasta, bread etc. Lots of room to eat, including a large outside area. The price for what they offer is very reasonable and I would consider a repeat visit.\n\nShow More\n\n3.7/5\n\nGGuest UserTypical Novotel property, away from the city center but reachable by public transport, direct public transport bus (L77) is available for euro 2.40 to reach the hotel (Last stop) - refer to Google map. Nice and comfortable lobby and room, L-3 tram is available at 400m from the hotel which drops you at the nearest metro station, staff will advise about the same and city center attractions. The room was spacious with all the required amenities The reception staff was very nice special mention to Ms. Paula, she explained to us how to use the public transport in line with the attractions upon our arrival, Ms. Jessica was also great during our checkout Does it have a repeat value? for us Yes. We love to stay in this property again whenever we come to Barcellona.\n\nShow More"
