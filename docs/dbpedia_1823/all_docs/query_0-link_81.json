        "text": "If you’re looking for a quick day trip outside Barcelona, the beautiful Montserrat is worth a trek up. It hosts a beautiful monastery called ‘La Morena’; a black Virgin Mary statue. A lot of people visit the monastery for religious reasons, but I think the trek itself and the natural beauty that surrounds you is just stunning.\n\nHow to get to Montserrat\n\nCar: It’s just an hour’s drive from the city.\n\nTrain: There’s a train that runs every hour from Placa d’Espanya all the way to Montserrat-Aeri. From there, you could choose to take a scenic cable car or funicular ride.\n\nBus: There are daily buses from Plaça de la Universitat.\n\nWhat to do in Monserrat\n\n1) Visit the Basilica\n\nThe choir at Montserrat is supposedly quite beautiful to sit in and listen, but the Basilica in itself is extremely gorgeous.\n\n2) Trek up to the view point\n\nThe short trek up the mountain to the first viewpoint is relatively easy. It doesn’t take much longer and you don’t need to be particularly fit to go up. I do suggest you carry a comfortable pair of shoes though.\n\n3) Visit La Morena & the little markets\n\nIf you are looking to visit La Morena (also known as the Black Madonna), it’s quite a bit of a trek, but a downward one. I hear there’s usually a very long queue to see a very small statue. Might be worth your while if you’re the religious kind.\n\nHave you been to Montserrat? Let me know what you think of it in the comments below."
