        "text": "Hello Folks, 8 Types of Waste | 3M Waste 3M is a Japanese concept derived to identify and eliminate non-value-added activities present in the manufacturing process. 8 types of waste in Lean manufacturing come under Muda. 3M Waste are Muda(Waste), Mura(Unevenness) and Muri(Overburden). It is called 3M since the first letter starts with “M”. The seven wastes are categories of unproductive manufacturing practices identified by Taiichi Ohno, the father of the Toyota Production System In martial arts, any excess movement in a fight is a waste since it tires the athlete and leaves him open for an attack Similarly, any uneven or unnatural movement or thought, or unnatural stance, will delay your actions Finally, trying to do too much at the same time or using techniques that you have not yet mastered is overburden. Muda: Any activity that consumes resources without creating value for the customer. Within this general category it is useful to distinguish between type one muda, consisting of activities that cannot be eliminated immediately, and type two muda, consisting of activities that can be eliminated quickly through kaizen. An example of type one muda is a rework operation after a paintbooth, which is required to obtain a finish acceptable to the customer from a paint process that is not highly capable. Because a completely capable paint process for fine finishes has eluded manufacturers for decades, it is not likely that this type of muda can be eliminated quickly. An example of type two muda is multiple movements of products and inventories between steps in a fabrication and assembly process. These steps can be quickly eliminated in a kaizen workshop by moving production equipment and operators into a smoothly flowing cell. Mura: Unevenness in an operation; for example, a gyrating schedule not caused by end-consumer demand but rather by the production system, or an uneven work pace in an operation causing operators to hurry and then wait. Unevenness often can be eliminated by managers through level scheduling and careful attention to the pace of work. Muri: Overburdening equipment or operators by requiring them to run at a higher or harder pace with more force and effort for a longer period of time than equipment designs and appropriate workforce management allow. #3m #waste #muda"
