        "text": "As a person married to a Spaniard from Barcelona, I am going to go there a lot! Thankfully, F.C.’s folks love travelling too and are a fan of road trips, so a few days after our wedding, his dad had a day trip idea from Barcelona – a medieval town called Mura!\n\nLocated just a bit above an hour’s road trip, Mura is a charming and quaint town that’s perfect for a little hike and almost devoid of tourists in June. It has an interesting vibe to it, considering that it barely seems to have any inhabitants, but the surrounding nature and historical vibes make this town a wonderful spot to spend a few hours if you’re looking for something off-beat and different.\n\nWhat to do in Mura\n\nWalk and look around! You will start to appreciate not only the beautiful surrounding medieval-style architecture but also the cobblestoned streets and tavern-style restaurants are a delight to dine in as they’re so different! As you reach the parking lot, there is a visitor centre as well as a map, giving you different hiking routes around the town.\n\nVisit the Sant Marti de Mura Church\n\nYou will most probably find this church at the end of your simple walking route. It is a simple Romanesque church that’s worth atleast walking around in.\n\nContinue a hike through Sant Llorenç del Munt i l’Obac Natural Park\n\nIf you would like to continue your hike, it might be worth following the route through Sant Llorenç del Munt i l’Obac Natural Park. It has two main mountains that are hike-able as well as a lower landscape, it is comparatively quite hike-able for most beginners, depending on the route you want to take. This path is greener and has a very scenic route. We didn’t hike much up here, but did walk around a stream and just valued being in nature.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this day trip idea from Barcelona! Here’s another destination that I’m sure you’ll love and would be an even longer day trip. Mura is perfect if you have about 3-4 hours on your itinerary for a quicky day trip, but of course, can always be extended.\n\nPIN THIS"
