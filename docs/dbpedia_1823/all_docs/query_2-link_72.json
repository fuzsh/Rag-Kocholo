        "text": "Floating Village (P12) was located in the Ukabu province. [1]\n\nDawn of the Empire[]\n\nFloating Village was the westernmost holding of the Shiba and one of their last major settlements in the Phoenix Clans initial campaign to civilize the lands given to them by Emperor Hantei. [2]\n\nGrowing[]\n\nUkabu Mura was one of the largest Shiba cities, and housed dignitaries travelling to the northern Phoenix lands. In time the village had become a cosmopolitan city. [2] Overlooking the banks of the Drowned Merchant River which winded all the way into Lion and Unicorn lands it was very well situated for trade. It was also renowned for it's Geisha houses, where geisha were trained for possible careers in the Imperial City. [3]\n\nNotable Locations[]\n\nThe House of the Evening Star was one of the most profitable geisha house of the Empire. [4] The village housed the largest temple to Toyouke-Omikami, the Fortune of Grain, [5] and also the Shrine of Agasha Kitsuki. [6]\n\nHistory[]\n\nContested Village[]\n\nUkabu Mura had not seen war for centuries, but during the War of Fire and Snow the city took its toll [2] as it began to be contested by the Dragon. [3]\n\nWar of Dark Fire[]\n\nIn 1171 the village was raided by the yobanjin Army of Fire. The shrine that housed the Agasha Kitsuki's Ashes was desecrated, but the ashes remained unnoticed.
