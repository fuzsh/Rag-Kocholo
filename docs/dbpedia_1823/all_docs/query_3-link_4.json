        "text": "Shima Spain Mura (志摩スペイン村, Shima Spain Village, also known as \"Parque Espana\") is a theme park about Spain designed much in the same style as Disneyland. The park features multiple roller coasters, an adventure lagoon ride, a mystery house and various other rides. Furthermore, there are flamenco dance performances and various shopping and dining options around the grounds.\n\nLocated next to the park is the Himawari-no-yu hot spring baths. Note that while the park is quite popular on weekends and during holidays, Spain Mura is generally considerably less busy on weekdays during the off-seasons.\n\nSpain Mura is most easily accessed from Ugata Station on the Kintetsu Shima Line, from where shuttle buses operate to the theme park (15 minutes, 450 yen one way).\n\nFrom Iseshi Station the trip to Ugata Station takes 40 minutes and costs 1340 yen by limited express train or 60 minutes and 820 yen by local train. From Toba, it takes 25 minutes and costs 1040 yen by limited express train or 35 minutes and 520 yen by local train. Direct limited express trains from Nagoya, Osaka and Kyoto make a stop at Ugata Station.\n\nHow to get to and around the Shima Peninsula"
