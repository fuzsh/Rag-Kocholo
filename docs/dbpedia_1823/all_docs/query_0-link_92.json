        "text": "Manresa\n\nSpain\n\nManresa, city, Barcelona provincia (province), in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Catalonia, northeastern Spain. It lies along the Cardoner River. The city—which probably originated as Minorisa, the Roman capital of Jacetani—was important during the Middle Ages. Three bridges span the Cardoner, and on a rock above the oldest bridge stands the yellow Church of Santa María de la Seo (14th and 15th centuries). Below the 17th-century Church of San Ignacio is the cave where St. Ignatius of Loyola meditated. The municipal museum occupies the cloisters of San Ignacio. There is also a conservatory of music in Manresa. The city’s traditional industries include metallurgy and the making of textiles, tires, and glass, while more recent economic activities include food processing and chemical production. Tourism has also grown in importance. Pop. (2007 est.) mun., 73,140.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Amy Tikkanen."
