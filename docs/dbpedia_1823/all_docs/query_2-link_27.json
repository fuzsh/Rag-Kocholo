        "text": "Amerika-mura - or Amemura to the locals - is a warren of narrow streets which is at the heart of youth culture in Osaka, with dozens of shops catering to fans of urban apparel and hip-hop wear. But even if you’re not clothes-shopping, there are plenty of foreigner-friendly bars and restaurants in the area.\n\nAmerika-mura - image © Florentyna Leow\n\nIf you’re a fashionista - or a fashion victim - in your 20s, Amerika Mura (or “Amemura” to the locals) may be right up your alley. With a name that translates to “America Village,” Amemura has been at the heart of youth culture in Osaka since the 1970s.\n\nAmerika-mura - image © Florentyna Leow\n\nEven today, this warren of narrow streets draws teenagers and early-20s fashionistas in flocks for its shops stocked with urban apparel, hip-hop wear, and vintage clothing.\n\nAmerika-mura - image © Florentyna Leow\n\nAmemura is located on the west side of Midosuji, just north of the Dotombori Canal. Centered around Sankaku-koen Park (Triangle Park), a concrete rest area surrounded by retail shops, Amemura is a great place to wander around, watch people, spot unusual outfits, and shop for your own wacky clothes.\n\nAmerika-mura - image © Florentyna Leow\n\nThere are plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants in the area, most of which are welcoming to foreigners. If you’re looking for non-Japanese food, this is also the neighbourhood to visit, as there’s a relatively high density of “international” food in this area - pancakes, burgers, pizza, and third-wave coffee are just some of the options you’ll find in Amemura. Weekends see long queues at the takoyaki shop at one corner of the park - try the lemon and black pepper version - and performances and flea markets for a fun and lively atmosphere.\n\nEnglish name:\n\nAmerikamura\n\nJapanese name:\n\nアメリカ村\n\nEnglish address:\n\nNishi-shinsaibashi, Chuo-ku, Osaka-shi, 542-0086\n\nJapanese address:\n\n〒542-0086 大阪市中央区西心斎橋\n\nOpening hours:\n\nVaries by shop\n\nAdmission:\n\nfree\n\nNearest Transport:\n\nSubway: Directly connected to exit 7 of Shinsaibashi Station on the Osaka Metro Midosuji and Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Lines.\n\nNearest Hotels:\n\n:: Check availability and pricing for hotels near Amerikamura on Booking.com or Agoda.com.\n\nTelephone:\n\nnone\n\nWebsite:\n\nOfficial Website (English)\n\nNear To Here:\n\nAmerikamura is located in Osaka's Minami district.
