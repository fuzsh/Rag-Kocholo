        "text": "Ministry of Natural Resources and Spatial Planning (\n\nGovernment\n\n)\n\n#SDGAction50373\n\nDescription\n\nDescription\n\nThe Transboundary Biosphere Reserve Mura-Drava-Danube (TBR MDD) is among the largest alluvial complexes in Europe, extending along the floodplains of three rivers in Austria, Slovenia, Hungary, Serbia and Croatia. The reserve spans over 700 km of free-flowing rivers, boasting an outstanding natural and cultural heritage of Europe and the world. This biosphere reserve (BR) is rich in rare habitats and it’s the home for many endangered species. However, many of these today threatened due to the declining state of the water and its surrounding floodplain ecosystems.\n\nThe objective of this commitment is the improvement in ecosystem restoration management in the UNESCO Mura River Biosphere Reserve, which is also part of the TBR MDD. The objectives of the latter are common in Slovenia as well as in the remaining four countries.\n\nThe objective of the Slovenian UNESCO Mura River Biosphere Reserve management authority - Ministry of Natural Resources and Spatial Planning of the Republic of Slovenia regarding the key points of the Water Convention is taking measures on transboundary Mura River (including its border section with Austria and Croatia) to ensure ecologically reliable water management, conservation of resources and environmental protection, focusing on restoration of river and floodplain ecosystems, where necessary.\n\nIn the past, Slovenia has advocated for a restored, dynamic and ecologically connected Mura River system in several national and transboundary agendas and documents:\n\n• The \"Declaration concerning common approaches to water management, flood protection, hydropower utilization and nature and biodiversity conservation in the Drava River basin\", signed as a signal for full support at the Drava River Vision Symposium, Maribor, 24 September 2008,\n\n• The Ministerial Declaration on the preparation of the establishment of the ,,Mura–Drava-Danube Transboundary Biosphere Reserve\" (MDD-TBR), signed by the Environment Ministers of all five countries in 2011;\n\n• The \"Assessment of the River and Floodplain Restoration Potential in the Transboundary UNESCO Biosphere Reserve \"Mura-Drava-Danube\" in 2013,\n\n• The Cooperation Agreement among the coop MDD partnership and managing institutions of Protected Areas forming part of the TBR MDD\" (2018) including Action Plan for Habitat Restoration in Natura 2000 Site Mura (SI)and other.\n\n• The establishment of BR along Mura, Drava, Danube in Croatia and Hungary (2012), Serbia (2017), Slovenia (2018), Austria (2019) and the TBR MDD in 2021\n\n• The Common Work Plan for the 5-country BR as defined in the TBR MDD nomination form for UNESCO (2019);\n\n• The Ministerial Declaration to UNESCO on the Support of the Establishment of the \"5-country Biosphere Reserve Mura-Drava-Danube\", signed by the Environment Ministers of all five countries in 2020;\n\n• The \"Danube Declaration\" 2022 -2027 of the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (endorsed at the 4th Ministerial Meeting held on 8/2/2022) and the Danube River Basin Management Plan Update 2021.\n\n• Outputs developed in the lifelineMDD project in 2022: River Restoration Toolbox, Synthesis report on science-based needs for action, River Restoration Strategy.\n\nAs a follow-up to the existing agreements, we, therefore, add this commitment for the implementation of necessary measures to achieve these goals.\n\nExpected Impact\n\nIn line with the above-mentioned documents, we propose our commitment to active managed Mura River Biosphere Reserve and to restored, dynamic and ecologically connected Mura River system, as stated in the “lifelineMDD River Restoration Strategy: A commitment for future restoration works in the 5-country Biosphere Reserve Mura-Drava-Danube (TBR MDD)”.\n\nWe commit to:\n\n- Establish an active management structure of the Mura River Biosphere Reserve;\n\n- To continue operating the Forum for Mura River;\n\n- Continue to work towards the restoration of the Mura, Drava and Danube Rivers and promote the necessity and the social and health benefits of river restoration among the local population and regional stakeholders;\n\n- Support each other in their local work with the exchange of experience, information and know-how in river restoration;\n\n- Seek for integrated win-win solutions in river restoration with local stakeholders;\n\n- Raise European and other external funds as well as national resources for projects aiming at the practical implementation of river restoration;\n\n- Participate in future transboundary river restoration projects;\n\n- Promote and find joint synergetic solutions for difficulties in nature conservation and water management regarding restoration activities;\n\n- Consider state-of-the-art river restoration measures, as well as international knowhow and expertise in local restoration projects;\n\n- Consider the outcomes that were developed in the lifelineMDD project as integrated transboundary strategic framework for future river restoration in TBR MDD;\n\n- Consider the proposed actions and recommendations in the \"River Restoration Toolbox\" and the \"Synthesis report on science-based needs for action\" (outputs of the Interreg DTP lifelineMDD project, annexed to the strategy) as a basis for future ecological restoration activities. The focus shall be on:\n\n• Protecting and restoring river sections, wetlands and floodplains, while also considering negative impacts of current and future climate change;\n\n• Elaborating and implementing management concepts that guarantee sustainable use of biological resources in the future and prevent overexploitation;\n\n• Participation, education, public information, and increased scientific research regarding restoration activities;\n\n• Following detailed, interdisciplinary planning steps, combined with hydraulic and sediment modelling for all cases of river restoration in order to determine the reasonable planning variants, the suitable combinations of measures and finally the successful implementation of the measures;\n\n• Prioritizing restoration areas for short-, mid- and long-term pipeline development;\n\n• Considering the large-scale catchment level for restorations for promotion of a self-dynamic river system;\n\n• Establishing a sediment management concept to provide and remobilize sediments in the Danube, Drava and Mura basins and to improve longitudinal connectivity; activate potential sediment input from the floodplain for sufficient bedload input;\n\n• Considering habitat needs, including habitat heterogeneity and morphological integrity, allowing continuous migration routes (fish, birds), eliminating/mitigating negative consequences/impacts of hydropeaking\n\n• Increasing lateral dynamics and improving morphological conditions to better use and keep the sediment in the system, considering river engineering, hydraulics, flood safety and river morphology;\n\n• \"Thinking big\" in river restoration with: erodible (\"soft\") banks, mechanical widening, initial channels/reconnection of existing channel systems, lowering of the foreland, additional input of sediment, structures to enhance erosion.\n\nPartners\n\n- Ministry of Natural Resources and Spatial Planning\n\n- Institute of the Republic of
