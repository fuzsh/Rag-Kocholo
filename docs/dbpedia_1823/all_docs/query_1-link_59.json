        "text": "President Novák visited the Mura River Region on Tuesday to meet the Hungarian community in Slovenia. The Hungarian Head of State was joined by President of Slovenia Nataša Pirc Musar for her visit to the Mura River Region. At the end of the visit, the two Heads of State held a moderated discussion at the renovated Cultural Centre in Dobronak. The agenda included the situation of national minorities, the topics of the COP28 Climate Summit in Dubai and Katalin Novák's speech there.\n\nKatalin Novák highlighted that as President of Hungary, she considers it her duty to represent all Hungarians, and this also applies to the Hungarian minorities living beyond Hungary’s borders and the Hungarians living in the diaspora. \"Wherever I go in the world, where there is a significant Hungarian minority, I make a point of visiting them and conveying the greetings of the people of Hungary, as we are members of one nation\", she pointed out, adding that in the Mura River Region it was positive to experience that as a national minority, it is possible to live peacefully and mutually support one another with members of the majority community.\n\nKatalin Novák underlined that Hungarian businesses and economic actors enjoy support in Slovenia. In this country, the Hungarian minority is not seen as an adversary, but as a resource that contributes to the economy, the President stressed. Katalin Novák brought up the situation of Hungarians in Transcarpathia, who, in addition to the threat of war, must also fight for upholding their minority rights and Hungarian identity.\n\nWith relation to the climate summit, the President of Hungary recalled that there are those who are trying to dissuade young people from having children, arguing that such an attitude is in the interests of climate protection. However, the family is not the cause, but the solution to the climate crisis, and rather than keeping young people in climate anxiety, they should be encouraged, including to have children. Because who are we to protect the Earth for if not for our children?"
