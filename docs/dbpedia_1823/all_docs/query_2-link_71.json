        "text": "Geography\n\nSvahanus is Mura's largest continent, making up a majority of its landmass. It's so large, in fact, that it contains every type of biome on Mura, except for tundra (in Madaco), clawlands (in Gixgalen), and corrupted plains (in Yao'gil). It's split in half latitudinally by a river called the Svahinati (literally translating to \"Half of Svahanus\"). A large portion of the world's population also lives here, with a higher concentration west of the Svahinati. Although Svahanus is considered a continent, it is actually a supercontinent. The landmass has namely six continental plates, denoted as: West Svahanus, the Svahinati Slip, the Morshinir Slip, Northeastern Svahanus, Southeastern Svahanus, and the Bekiw Shelf. Though geologically distinct, most denizens split the continent merely into two sections, West Svahanus (west of the Svahinati River) and East Svahanus (east of the Svahinati River). The most common terrain is deciduous forests, both tropical near the coasts and temperate inland, located sporadically throughout most west Svahanus and large portions of the east. Following is grasslands, predominantly prairie. Savannah is frequent on the southern end of Lake Bekiw. Less common biomes include chapparal, which covers the northern end of west Svahanus, as well as nearly half of Gul Thac'zil. The plethora of dragons keep the overgrowth in check and the soil fertile. Near the southern and northwestern coasts, and cropping near the large mountain ranges, are taiga forests. These are typically the coldest regions of Svahanus, and receives fairly constant snowfall.\n\nNatural Resources\n\nWhile certainly more common in mountainous regions, Mura's primary resource is iron, copper, and other metals. Even deserts and grasslands have metal ore that is able to be retrieved with only some effort required. With the Celestial Mountains to the west and the Morshinir Vertichai to the east, large deposits of ore are plentiful and expansive. This allowed structures to develop quickly into metal framing, and weapons to be plentiful in war times. Lumber is, of course, also an important resource, and one that is found all across the continent. The plentiful tropical and temperate forests provide various types of trees for wood, which includes oak, birch, palm, kapok, rubber, and redwood. Less common but still sought after are taiga trees, such as fir, pines, cedar, and spruce. Coal and natural gas is in short supply, as there is fairly limited access to it without deep mining.\n\nType\n\nContinent\n\nIncluded Locations\n\nRelated Tradition (Primary)"
