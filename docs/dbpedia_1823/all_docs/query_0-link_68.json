        "text": "Terrassa is Catalonia’s third city. Located in north-eastern Spain, it is part of the second metropolitan crown of Barcelona. The city has a rich cultural and artistic heritage and is dominated by the Sant Llorenç del Munt Natural Park.\n\nTerrassa has among its most unique attractions the Seu d’Ègara, a monumental architectural ensemble that is in consideration to be named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Considered by experts a unique element in the history of European art and also in the world, this architectural ensemble stands out for the monumental singularity and for the mural paintings in its three churches – dating from the 5th to the 8th century.\n\nTerrassa proudly wears the signs of industrialisation, Catalan Modernism and Art Nouveau: the Aymerich, Amat and Jover Mill – now the mNACTEC-Science and Technics of Catalonia Museum – the Masia Freixa and the Alegre de Sagrera House, are all part of the city’s textile industry heritage.\n\nTerrassa has also transformed its textile past and has turned towards innovation, investing in projects that provide transformation even beyond the local level. Recently invited by UNESCO to join the Creative City of Film Network, Terrassa boasts one of the most prominent industrial audiovisual production complexes of southern Europe, Parc Audiovisual of Catalunya, offering facilities, sets and a centre of media production – the Audiovisual Living Lab and the Terrassa Film Office.\n\nTerrassa is Catalonia’s second university city, with a rich offer of 176 official qualifications including aeronautics, cinema and audiovisual, telecommunications, sound, image, photography and multimedia.\n\nCreative industries and culture are a main commitment of Terrassa and its wider urban fabric focusing on opportunities for small and medium enterprises. Visitors can therefore enjoy a broad range of activities in this dynamic city, for example the Jazz Festival, the Modernism Fair, hockey games, golf, dance, music, theatre seasons and Castellers – the human towers recognised as human heritage by UNESCO in 2010."
