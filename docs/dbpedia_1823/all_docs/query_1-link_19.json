In these lands worshipping of the Fortunes was strong, and descendeant of a tribe used to marry with descendants of the same tribe. Koso Mura began to marry between descendents of different original tribes and allowed the establishment of a serie of large Taoist temples, no less than five, one for each of the Elements. This intermarriage led the town to develop much stronger relationships with the descendants of the Yamataru and Morikawa in other parts of the province.
