        "text": "Read More About The San Gimignano Area\n\nChianti is at its most breath-taking in September, as the vines grow heavy with grapes and the leaves turn to golden and russet hues. The rolling green hills and lush valleys are always a sight to behold, a distinctly lovely wonder that has made the landscape of Tuscany famous, and when the endless vineyards of the region are ready to be harvested this beauty is only more impressive and striking still. So, if you are a wine-lover who has always wanted to head out on adventures, sampling the incredible wines of Tuscany and exploring her gorgeous landscape and pretty towns, then we think you should book a escape in Chianti this September!\n\nA while ago our booking team set off for a visit to the Podere Lo Spadino, a new Tuscan country house close to San Gimignano and one of the favorites of our guests!\n\nA visit to this house is a visit to the Montagnani Family. Because we must tell you that this house was born from an idea, a difficult but a strongly desired wish that the owner Maris had since he was young: his idea to build a house entirely with his own strength and own hands.\n\nAccording to several researches Maris made and in analyzing some manuscripts left by his ancestors, the Montagnani Family has lived some centuries on the territory where the province of Florence borders the province of Siena, close to San Gimignano. The characteristic symbols of this area are part of the family's coat of arms which can be found in the medieval Town Hall in Certaldo.\n\nIf you feel like eating the best ice-cream in the world, you're going to need to find a luxury villa in San Gimignano. Located in the central Piazza della Cisterna, known all over the world and visited by a large number of celebrities is the Gelateria Dondoli or Gelateria di Piazza. The gelateria has won countless awards, invents flavour combinations that attract gourmet-lovers to the town on a regular basis and has made it World Champion on two occasions. Arguably, this is one of the best places in the entire world to try some ice-cream and, particularly in a land known for its ice-cream, this is no small claim.\n\nTourists would delight in a visit to the marvellous medieval town of San Gimignano. Even from a distance, visitors will see that this walled hilltop town has something unique to offer! San Gimignano, in Tuscany’s Siena province is nicknamed ‘The Town of Fine Towers’. Today the town has managed to preserve fourteen of what was believed to have been originally 72 towers in total during the late medieval period!\n\nWhy not stay in a gorgeous villa in San Gimignano where you can visit the town itself and other attractions in this picturesque part of Tuscany!\n\nTuscany is famous for her remarkable landscapes and pretty towns and places where you can view both. Perhaps the best spot of all, however, to take in these views is the medieval beauty that is San Gimignano. This magical gem is a place where high rise buildings in the form of tower houses are not a new addition to the lovely skyline at all – in fact, they have a long history in the town. Come see these incredible structures and views for yourself by finding a luxury villa in San Gimignano.\n\nSan Gimignano, known as the Town of Fine Towers, was famously and historically a town of these impressive ancient towers that were built in the Medieval and Renaissance periods by wealthy families and nobility who tacked the structures onto their homes and built them up increasingly higher in order to compete with each other to show off their fortune and power. The towers were very much status symbols of the time, again something that is not unfamiliar as many places around the globe today continue to compete in attempting to build the tallest structures in the world.\n\nSan Gimignano is famous as the Tuscan city of Medieval skyscrapers, a place where nobles competed in building the highest towers. While the town was once full of these extraordinary architectural gems, only a few examples exist today and they are the attraction that most immediately go to see when visiting the city. However, if you have found a luxury villa in San Gimignano and are taking a closer look at all this picturesque and historic gem has to offer then we suggest you also look past the ancient and iconic and see what is happening in the contemporary world of art and design and the here and now because, among those winding Medieval streets, you will find one of the world’s most respected contemporary art galleries.\n\nThe Galleria Continua is very much the definition of a hidden gem, something one would never expect in an old cinema in the historic core of San Gimignano but is definitely a gem nonetheless. Founded in 1990 by three friends, Mario Cristiani, Lorenzo Fiaschi, and Maurizio Rigillo, the gallery has grown in scale and reputation in the thirty years since its inauguration and now also has locations in Les Moulins (just outside Paris), Havana (Cuba), Beijing (China), and Rome. Having showcased works by globally-renowned talents like Ai Weiwei, Ethel Adnan, The Kabakovs, and Michelangelo Pistoletto, it truly is an extraordinary gallery to stumble across in a small town!"
