MURA encompasses approximately 160 acres along the Uncompahgre River northwest of downtown Montrose.\n\nMURA and Colorado Outdoors work in tandem to create public infrastructure, public open space, and zoning required to accommodate the project's mixed-use intent which includes commercial, hospitality, and residential sites. An estimated $83 million is proposed for site work, infrastructure improvements, river restoration, and open space enhancements.\n\nDevelopment Plans\n\nThe master plan for Colorado Outdoors, the development that lies within the MURA's boundaries, includes approximately 670,000 square feet of development; the northern section is comprised of hotel and restaurant sites, with retail spanning Grand Avenue along the east end. Modern, quality housing units round out the southern end, with abundant open space and trail access adjoining the properties.\n\nLeadership\n\nBoard members and the organizations they represent are:\n\nBill Bell, Executive Director\n\nAllison Howe, Chairperson - Montrose Recreation District\n\nStephen Bush - Montrose County School District Representative\n\nBrad Hughes - Montrose County Representative\n\nJim Haugsness - Community At-Large Representative\n\nMontrose City Council\n\nMeeting Agendas, Packets, and Minutes\n\nMeeting materials for the MURA and other city boards are posted regularly on the city's Public Meetings Portal.
