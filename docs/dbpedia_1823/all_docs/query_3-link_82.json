        "text": "About our flag.\n\nThis Mura Flag is made of high quality polyester and has 2 brass grommets that are rust-resistant. This makes them very easy to install and does not require any additional work or special tools. It has double seams and reforced edges for a better resistance.\n\nOrder your Flag from Shopflagworld Store today and proudly display it outdoors. Made in the EU, this flag is of the highest quality and sure to last for years to come.\n\nBefore the first use\n\nWe recommend you to wash your digital printed flag at 30 ° before the first use outdoors.\n\nOur online printed scrapings will not be washed before delivery, which may leave slight residues of the digital printing equipment in the cloth. This can lead in rare cases to a slight leakage of the colors in the first rain.\n\nFor a long life\n\nFlags must be able to escape freely and should not rub on branches, masts, wires or walls. Exposure to the sun and weather influences the flag life. We recommend that you bring in your digital printed flags in bad weather.\n\nEvery 2-3 months the flag should be washed at 30 ° C. Please take care that you do not pull your flag over the floor with the covering, otherwise it can be very easy to damage the seam.\n\nShopflagworld has been in the flag market for over 15 years, our flags are made using premium quality materials and high-end professional printing equipment. Our flags are Waterproof and UV protected.\n\nSuperior Quality Flag Suits All Your Needs.\n\nOur flag is made of the highest-quality flag fabric available in the market, which is highly durable. The weight of our flag’s fabric is 115 GSM. Double stitching fly ends. Brass grommets for flag pole attachment. This makes them very easy to install and does not require any additional work or special tools.\n\nGraphic Care Instructions for Your Flag.\n\nIf you want to clean your flag, use a mild laundry detergent. We recommend that you hand wash your flag because the use of a washing machine on a regular basis may cause damage to the flag fabric.\n\nMachine-washing is not required for synthetic fibers such as polyester and nylon. It is recommended that you use warm water and that you use the gentle cycle on your washing machine.\n\nBulk Buy Discounts for Flag.\n\n​​Do you want to place a large number of orders? We offer special discounts to all of our customers based on the amount of merchandise they purchase.
