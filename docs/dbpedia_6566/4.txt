An old-style Hollywood star who made her name both in film and on television, actress Lara Flynn Boyle cultivated an image that was confident and bold, harkening back to the strong independent women of cinema from yesteryear like Bette Davis, Marlene Dietrich, and Joan Crawford. Much like the stars of old, Boyle also exuded glamour and class even while playing wholesome characters like she did in her first major role as a series regular on "Twin Peaks" (ABC, 1990-91). She managed to shed that good girl persona with a turn as a sultry seductress in the neo-noir "Red Rock West" (1993) before returning to the small screen for David E. Kelley's "The Practice" (ABC, 1997-2004), playing a determined assistant district attorney willing to violate ethics to see justice done. While that role helped turn her into a household name, Boyle continued making interesting choices on the big screen with noted supporting roles in the indie black comedy "Happiness" (1998) and the blockbuster sequel "Men in Black II" (2002). Following two noted returns to television with "Huff" (HBO, 2004-06) and "Las Vegas" (NBC, 2003-08), Boyle remained one of the more dynamic actresses working in Hollywood who never failed to fascinate.
