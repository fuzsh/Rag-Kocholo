        "text": "Would you like to be chased by JT Walsh and Dennis Hopper?\n\nI mean, being chased after one of them is bad enough, but both at the same time? If I was Nicolas Cage then no amount of cash and Lara Flynn Boyle, as nice as both of them are, would persuade me to stay within a thousand miles of Red Rock.\n\nIt's terrific seeing Walsh get as large a role as this. I think this may have been the film where I first saw him or at least started to recognise him. He may have distinguished himself in many character actor roles throughout his sadly abbreviated career, but many of those roles were still too small for a guy of his abilities, particularly in more villainous shoes.\n\nHe didn't need much screen time to dominate a film but given more time, he could show a wider range of his talents. Here, although still a villain, he is essentially asked to play four characters at once - embezzler, sheriff, bartender, scheming husband. And he's great at all of them. It gives him arguably the finest role of his career and it's arguably his finest performance, perhaps as much because he's a slightly less aggressively criminal figure in this.\n\nOn that front, Hopper gets a chance to show off hints of his Blue Velvet psychopathy, and he and Cage are an explosive duo to have on either side of the 'law' here - both of them wildly unpredictable actors capable of overdoing it to comic levels. Here they both keep it in check but there's just enough of those wild sides showing to leave you wondering what they might do next. As much as I am amused by Crazy Cage as pretty much everyone else, he really is an excellent actor when, you know, he just acts.\n\nWith Boyle also in her best ever big screen role, which she plays with ridiculous surety considering she was only about 23 when they shot this, there's no question that the cast elevates the material here. Occasionally Red Rock West drifts into slight contrivance but the story is so tight and has absolutely no flab on it at all that it just keeps moving along and kept me absolutely riveted.\n\nOne of the things I like most about John Dahl's trio of neo-noirs is that they are so unshowy and that they get straight to the point. This is a relatively short film yet it never feels rushed at any point. There are a small number of incidents that occur here and no reason to expand the story any further. I guess the fact that this was initially regarded as a made-for-cable film before it got a theatrical release might have something to do with that. It has to tell its story and tell it fast.\n\nDahl also learns a thing or two from Kill Me Again, which is noticeable here. He decides to work in the dark a bit more - a simple idea, really, but an easily effective one when you're dealing with a crime thriller to create the sense of a bit more danger. He also uses his support cast better, especially when you throw in Timothy Carhart as well, another really good and under-appreciated character actor.\n\nThere are no rough edges at all, and if you throw in a believable ending, what you have is one of the finest examples of the genre ever created."
