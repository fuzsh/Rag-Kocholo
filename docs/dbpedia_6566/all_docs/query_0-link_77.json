        "text": "One of our favorite 90s neo-noirs, John Dahl’s RED ROCK WEST starring Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Boyle will be released by Vinegar Syndrome in a new 4K Blu-Ray Edition on January 30th.\n\nSynopsis: Michael (Nicolas Cage, Wild at Heart), a discharged marine turned drifter, ends up in Red Rock, Wyoming in search of honest work. Wayne (J.T. Walsh, Breakdown), a local bar owner, offers Michael the dishonest work of carrying out a hit on his wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle, The Last Seduction) after mistaking him for the actual hitman, “Lyle, from Dallas”, that he hired to murder his spouse. Before Michael can split town with his downpayment, he runs into the real Lyle (Dennis Hopper, Blue Velvet) and, from there, all hell breaks loose.\n\nDirected and co-written by John Dahl (Kill Me Again), RED ROCK WEST is an endlessly twisty slice of distinctly American neo-noir set in the heartland of the United States. Featuring stellar performances from all three leads and a nearly repellent mean-streak, Dahl’s film is an often forgotten jewel of 90s crime cinema, making its US Blu-ray debut in an all new restoration from Cinématographe.\n\nSpecial Features and Technical Specs:"
