        "text": "Post your movie reviews on any movie you like/dislike. I'll start off with the movie Underworld.\n\nI watched Underworld over the weekend on TBS and I thought it was absolutely great. I think some parts were edited (more gory parts), which is a bit disappointing, but hey, it was still great.\n\nBeckinsale in the tight leather suit helped to make this movie better! ;)\n\nSomething about the plot makes me love it and craving more. Fortunetly I saw Underworld right after the theater release of Underworld: Evolution (new one).\n\nIt's rated R, but I'll find a way in!\n\nNow you guys think of a movie you've seen rescently and tell us about it.\n\nLast Friday AMC put on two old-old-old school horror films, The Mummy(1932) and The Invisible Man(1933). I watched The Invisible Man straight through, and I found it to be compelling and well-done for it's time, although not particularly scary. The acting is from a different era, resembling stage acting more than modern method acting. That means that the characters actually can have civil, polite, informative conversations with each other instead of constantly being at odds. The story is fairly simple, a man turned invisible by science is driven mad by his potion and must be stopped.\n\nThe Good: Solid, old-style acting, interesting story and fairly good-quality special effects.\n\nThe Bad: Occasionally, I felt that the film tried to show off the special effects too much.\n\nThe Unforgivables: The Innkeeper's wife.\n\nI saw Underworld 2 recently.\n\nIt was mediocre. I wouldn't go so far as to say it sucked though.\n\nThey spent way too little time fighting Lycans. Supposedly the movie is based on Vampire vs. Lycans wars, yet for 95% of the movie there are no Lycans in it. If I'm remembering correctly they only have Lycans at the very start and very end of the movie. Major disappointment there. And the silly end of some of the characters was even more disappointing.\n\nAt the start of the movie it was set in medieval times. That was the best scene in the whole movie. They should have left the whole movie in that time instead of fast forwarding to the much more boring and Lycan-free future.\n\nI'd give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.\n\nI saw Boyz In the Hood again last night and it was just as compelling as when I saw it way back when it first came out. It's not flawless - it's sentimental, unsubtle, with dodgy Black Consciousness type rhetoric. But it hits home emotionally with the force of a two-handed hammer.\n\nI don't think I've seen a violent death better represented - the horror, the screaming of love ones, the mess, the waste, the guilt. If that is not how violent death is, it is how it should be - something monstrous and unconscionable.\n\nLaurence Fishburne is great as the role model dad (\"Who diss?\"), but the emotional heart of the film for me is the doomed character played by IceCube (or is it IceT? I forget). Something about his character just appeals to me as rather noble. As a young fat kid trying to fight the much older bullies. Later, standing arms stretched out like Jesus inviting a would-be driveby killing. He never seems nasty or thuggish, and is often understanding and responsible in his own rough way. When his grief-stricken mother screams blame at him - unjustly - for his brother's death, it is far, far more moving than the equivalent scenes between Faramir and Denethor in ROTK. So he is damned by his own mother and goes out to avenge his brother, quietly understanding the consequences for him and why his friend who is escaping the ghetto should not join him on this path to hell. He may be part of the problem, but to me, he's also part lovable kid and part tragic hero.\n\n5 stars out of 5 from me.\n\nJust saw Munich and would highly recommend it. I guess you have to be interested in politics or current affairs to get a lot out of it, but it had a lot more action, characterisation and drama in it than I was expecting. Critics who have damned it for not being exciting enough must have watched too much hyperactive wham-bam conventional Hollywood products. The action is very well done but then ever since seeing the garage lot shoot-out in Sugarland Express, I have been convinced Spielberg is a genius at depicting violence as real and terrifying. The opening depiction of the Munich Olympic kidnapping and its subsequent portrayal through flash-backs are gripping and horrifying. The film has an excellent acting ensemble, with some intriguing characters (if anyone can tell me who or what Louis and his father were, I'd be indebted). Personally, I found it politically neutral, raising but not necessarily answering the question about whether assasinations of terrorist suspects are justified. All sides are depicted as human - the Palestinians assassinated often appear mature, urbane and humane. While some of the Israelis come to doubt their mission, what the film hammers home is the intrinsically awful nature of taking a life, rather than a wider political agenda.\n\nI have rescently re-watched a movie by the name of \"Lagan\". Don't go out trying to find it at Hollywood video or Blockbuster as it's probably not there.\n\nThis is a movie made in India about a group of farmers who have to play and beat an english group of rich men at a game of cricket.\n\nI really enjoyed this movie, even with all the breaking out in song and dance, as some of the songs were quite good."
