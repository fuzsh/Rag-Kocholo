        "text": "Director Gore Verbinski's first film following the success of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a change-of-pace dramedy starring Cage as a Chicago local news weatherman suffering a mid-life crisis who must deal with the disappointment of his dying and far more successful father (Michael Caine) and a failed marriage to Noreen (Hope Davis). But a chance for an upgrade comes in the form of a job interview for a national morning show position in New York. Like several of the actor's movies from the early 2000s, The Weather Man earned praise for Cage's performance even if critics didn't necessarily love the movie as a whole.\n\n\"It works as an intriguingly offbeat character study while offering Nicolas Cage a chance to show why he used to be considered one of the top actors of his generation.\" —Ruthe Stein, San Francisco Chronicle\n\nA teenage Nicolas Cage had only acted on film once before—in the failed 1981 TV pilot The Best of Times alongside Crispin Glover—before landing his big-screen debut in Amy Heckerling's 1982 high school comedy classic as part of a loaded cast that also included Sean Penn, Judge Reinhold, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Phoebe Cates, Anthony Edwards, Forest Whitaker, and fellow first-timer Eric Stoltz. Though most of his performance was cut from the final film, Cage, credited for the final time as Nicolas Coppola, made a quick appearance as a co-worker of Reinhold's Brad Hamilton at All-American Burger. The film's youngest cast member at 17, Cage had actually auditioned for the role that went to Reinhold (as did a young Tom Hanks), but was deemed too weird and too young for the part.\n\n\"A Trojan horse of a teen comedy that balanced lowbrow gags with subtle humor, genuine insight—[screenwriter Cameron] Crowe spent a year undercover as a high-school student—and pathos.\" —Keith Phipps, AV Club\n\nA rare comedy for director Ridley Scott, this 2003 Ted Griffin-scripted film stars Nicolas Cage as con artist Roy Waller, who suffers from panic attacks while engaged in a scheme with his partner, played by Sam Rockwell. A visit to a therapist prompts Roy to explore his past, and he learns that he has a 14-year-old daughter (Alison Lohman), who suddenly wants to become involved in his life. We won't spoil the twists and turns the darkly comedic thriller takes from there, but we will say that the relatively high budget for the film meant it was a money-loser at the box office despite decent reviews.\n\n\"This movie is a model of technique, beautifully crafted, often brilliantly acted by Cage and the others, but it's a bit hollow at the center.\" —Michael Wilmington, Chicago Tribune\n\nA true-story-inspired, globe-trotting thriller from Gattaca director Andrew Niccol, this 2005 film finds Cage playing a Ukrainian-born international arms dealer whose smuggling business also involves his drug-addicted brother (Jared Leto). Ethan Hawke also stars as an Interpol agent on their tail. Some critics liked it more than others, but even the naysayers had mostly good things to say about Cage's performance.\n\n\"Niccol doesn't always get the mix right, and the tone here is inconsistent. But the movie remains compelling, largely because of Cage's dry, deadpan delivery.\" —Jami Bernard, New York Daily News\n\nThe first of two Cage films with \"Vegas\" in the title, Honeymoon is the sole positively reviewed film in Cage's first down period, which stretched from the late 1980s into the mid-'90s (and was marked by such forgettable duds as Vampire's Kiss, Fire Birds, and Guarding Tess). Directed by Blazing Saddles screenwriter Andrew Bergman, this 1992 rom-com offers a much more comedic take on the Indecent Proposal formula—Vegas actually reached theaters first, but Proposal was based on a 1988 book—that stars Cage as Jack and Sarah Jessica Parker as Betsy, a young couple that heads to Las Vegas to get married, only for Jack to incur a $65,000 debt playing a rigged poker game. His lender is Tommy, a professional poker player played by James Caan, who offers to wipe out Jack's debt if Betsy will spend the weekend alone with him.\n\nIndecent Proposal ultimately grossed about eight times more than Vegas, but the latter had the better reviews (and it wasn't close). The film also brought Cage his second Golden Globe nomination (following Moonstruck).\n\n\"If Honeymoon in Vegas is funny—and it is—it doesn't exactly ring with structural perfection. You wouldn't go to see it again. But with wonderfully bizarre Nicolas Cage scrambling and screaming his way through the proceedings, 'Honeymoon' never attempts anything greater than goofy.\" —Desson Thomson, The Washington Post\n\nCage's third film appearance was his first collaboration with his uncle, director Francis Ford Coppola, though here Cage had only a supporting role in a stylized black-and-white drama based on S.E. Hinton's novel of the same name. Cage's cousin Sofia Coppola also has a small role in the film (at the age of 12), which starred Mickey Rourke and Matt Dillon as Oklahoma brothers on the wrong side of the law. Cage plays Smokey, a friend to Dillon's Rusty James who steals his girlfriend Patty (played by Diane Lane).\n\n\"A triumph of romantic impulse over stylistic indulgence\" —Jay Carr, The Boston Globe\n\nIt could, but it probably won't. Reuniting with his Honeymoon in Vegas director Andrew Bergman, Cage plays Charlie Lang, a New York City cop who ends his diner meal with the realization that he doesn't have enough money to tip his waitress Yvonne (Bridget Fonda). So he promises to give her half of his winnings from a lottery ticket he just purchased. The next day, that ticket pays off to the tune of $4 million, setting off a convoluted chain of events that includes Charlie's divorce (from his wife played by Rosie Perez), a romance with Yvonne, and the loss of his newfound fortune. The film was inspired by (but, as the producers insist for legal reasons, not actually based upon) a similar real-life event in 1984 at a New York pizzeria.\n\n\"Even as a romantic confection it would soar higher, glow brighter, if it had permitted itself some texture, some bite. It's too simply emblematic to muster all the magic it needs, even though it has a pair of utterly winning performances by Nicolas Cage and Bridget Fonda.\" —Jay Carr, The Boston Globe\n\nMatthew Vaughn's cult classic 2010 action-comedy gave Cage one of his few chances to appear in a superhero movie based on a comic book (in this case, Mark Millar's Kick-Ass). The violent film follows a teen (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who aims to become a real-life superhero. (There are no superpowers to be found here.) Cage plays his mentor, Big Daddy, an ex-cop who has already been training his young daughter (Chloí« Grace Moretz) to become Hit-Girl and aid him in bringing down a crime boss played by Mark Strong (who also has his own young assistant, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse). The kids may try to steal the show, but Cage—a fill-in for the originally targeted Brad Pitt—is perfectly cast as a comic book superfan (he is one in real life) and he shines in a fun, over-the-top performance that fits the material perfectly.\n\nKick-Ass did get a sequel three years later, but without Cage and without the good reviews.\n\n\"Irresponsible, morally murky, and batshit insane--in other words, Kick-Ass might be the most fun two hours you'll spend in a movie theater. It delivers the darkly comic laughs (the movie is clearly not taking itself too seriously, so you should do likewise) as well as the jaw-dropping action, but Kick-Ass's real accomplishment is bringing back the winkingly crazy Nic Cage we used to know and love.\" —Nick Starkey, Premiere\n\nCage's second film appearance and first under his current name found him going from bit part in his debut (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) to leading man—a position where he would basically remain for the duration of his career. Coincidentally, the setting is partially the same—L.A.'s San Fernando Valley—though here in Martha Coolidge's Romeo and Juliet-inspired teen rom-com Cage plays a young Hollywood punk who woos the titular Valley High student played by Deborah Foreman. The film developed enough of a cult following over the years—the New Wave soundtrack is especially good, and still worth seeking out—that a remake was produced a few years ago.\n\n\"Valley is very good simply because director Martha Coolidge obviously cares about her two lead characters and is privileged to have a couple of fine young performers, Nicolas Cage and Deborah Foreman, to make the audience care.\" —Variety\n\nRichard Benjamin's 1984 dramedy finds one-time Fast Times co-stars Sean Penn and Nicolas Cage starring as two recently drafted young men in Northern California in the early 1940s who have just six weeks left before shipping out to the war, while Elizabeth McGovern also stars as the former's love interest. The low-key film (just actor-turned-director Benjamin's second time behind the camera following the 1982 classic My Favorite Year) was not a moneymaker at the box office but did earn decent reviews from critics who praised the performances of all three leads.\n\n\"Racing With the Moon is a movie like Valley Girl or Baby, It's You, a movie that is interested in teenagers and willing to listen to how they talk and to observe, with great tenderness, the fragility and importance of their first big loves.\" —Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times\n\nCage's first pairing with director Oliver Stone came in this 2006 retelling of the events of September 11, 2001 in New York City. Cage takes the lead as Port Authority Sergeant John McLoughlin, one of the first responders trapped under the rubble of the collapsed towers who is eventually rescued after a heroic effort. The real-life McLoughlin is one of several of the figures depicted in World Trade Center who were involved in the film's production. Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Peí±a, and Maria Bello also star in a film deemed decent but unexceptional by reviewers. But it remains Stone's only positively reviewed movie since 1995.\n\n\"Despite the best efforts of the cast (Cage is especially evocative in a literally confined role), Stone can't disguise the fact that his movie, like his heroes, has come to a kinetic halt, stuck between a narrative rock and an emotional hard place.\" —Rick Groen, The Globe and Mail\n\nComing four decades into the actor's career, this 2022 action-comedy finally gave Cage the role he was born to play: Nick Cage. In fact, Cage plays two different fictionalized versions of himself (in case you were wondering: yes, they do make out with each other) in this wild and extremely meta (no relation) Tom Gormican film that builds its story on the actor's own legend, referencing seemingly every Cage film in the process. (Well, not quite every one—it's not a five-hour film.)\n\nPedro Pascal, Sharon Horgan, Tiffany Haddish, Ike Barinholtz, and Neil Patrick Harris also star in Massive Talent, which finds actor \"Nick Cage\" taking a huge paycheck to appear at the house of a billionaire fan, who turns out to be an international arms dealer. The CIA enlists Cage to spy on him, only for the pair to begin writing a script for a Cage movie (perhaps The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent itself) prior to embarking on the required action-fueled finale, all while the film offers critiques of both Cage and the industry he inhabits. It may not be the highest-scoring film of Cage's career, but it is certainly maximum Cage.\n\n\"If you're a Cage superfan, then you're guaranteed to revel in the bounty of references to his filmography. But even if you're not (though you will become one after this movie), this is an emotional, engaging, funny, riveting film.\" —Aurora Amidon, Paste\n\nWorking with uncle Francis Ford Coppola for the second time in as many years, Cage had a supporting role as mob enforcer Vincent Dwyer, the younger brother to Richard Gere's Dixie Dwyer, in Coppola's 1930s-set film based loosely on true events centering on the legendary Harlem jazz club.\n\nCoppola and producer Robert Evans didn't exactly have a good working relationship (see, e.g., the new Paramount+ miniseries The Offer about the making of The Godfather) and the years-in-the-making, over-budget film was a major bust upon its 1984 release despite decent reviews. Coppola later used his own money to re-cut The Cotton Club, adding 24 previously unseen minutes (and excising numerous scenes from the original release), though the resulting film (released in 2019 as The Cotton Club Encore) actually scored slightly lower with critics.\n\n\"Cotton Club lacks the resonance of The Godfather; it's similar stylistically, but everything is coarsened, caricatured.\" —Jay Scott, The Globe and Mail\n\nDebuting at Cannes in 2024, the latest from director Lorcan Finnegan (Vivarium, Nocebo) is a low-budget thriller starring Nicolas Cage as a man who returns to the Australian beach of his childhood to surf with his son, only to be humiliated and prevented from surfing by a group of locals. This sends Cage's unnamed character into a downward spiral—all the better to highlight Cage's acting chops, according to reviewers.\n\n\"In the end, the film feels too rollicking and self-parodying to be taken seriously, but it strikes just the right tone to make it a fun Midnight movie.\" —Leslie Felperin, The Hollywood Reporter\n\nThe first of just two animated films to make this list (weirdly, both came out within months of each other in 2018, ending the longest streak of duds in Cage's career), this feature film adaptation of the DC Comics-inspired Cartoon Network series allowed Cage to fulfill a lifelong dream: portraying Superman, albeit in voice only. (Cage famously was cast as the hero in Superman Lives, only for that Kevin Smith-scripted, Tim Burton-directed project to be canceled just prior to filming to 1998.) Teen Titans also allowed Cage to work briefly with his 13-year-old son, who voiced a young Bruce Wayne in the movie. That younger Cage's name? Kal-El—better known as Superman's birth name.\n\n\"Smart and stupid in equal measure, this is a palate cleanser after the doom and gloom of Justice League. The Titans could make you fall back in love with the entire DC Universe.\" —Helen O'Hara, Empire\n\nThe second film directed by the Coen brothers remains a fan favorite to this day, and a standout Cage performance is likely one of the reasons for its popularity. The oddball 1987 comedy stars Cage as ex-con \"Hi\" McDunnough, who wants to have children with his new wife, police officer Edwina (Holly Hunter), but cannot. So they hatch a plan to kidnap one of the newly born quintuplets belonging to furniture store magnate Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) and rase him as their own. Needless to say, things don't go to plan (at least at first), but they do result in a minor box office hit that has only grown in stature since its original release.\n\nBut the Coens' exacting style didn't necessarily mesh well with Cage's more improvisational, unhinged nature, and the actor never again worked with the brothers. (The opposite, of course, was true for Raising Arizona co-star John Goodman, who became a Coen brothers regular.) But just try imagining Cage's role played by the actor first considered for the part: Kevin Costner.\n\n\"The Coens abhor sentimentality, but behind the comic-book grotesqueries there's a disarming sweetness. Like 'Blood Simple,' this wild-card comedy knows where it's headed every inch of the way. It's a hoot and a half.\" —David Ansen, Newsweek\n\nPossibly the unlikeliest \"sequel\" (or \"remake\"?) ever made, this pulpy 2009 crime drama is theoretically a follow-up to Abel Ferrara's NC-17-rated arthouse classic from 1992. But this mostly unrelated film comes from a different director (the great Werner Herzog), is set in New Orleans rather than New York, and features a completely new cast, characters, and story. In fact, the only commonalities between the two films are their titles, a producer, and a shared focus on a corrupt police officer—Harvey Keitel in the original, Cage in the second film. New Orleans broke a string of eight consecutive duds for Cage, who gets to deliver a \"sublimely deranged lead performance\" (in the eyes of AV Club critic Scott Tobias) as the titular drug-addicted lieutenant who manages to date a prostitute, steal drugs and money, threaten witnesses, run up a huge gambling debt, and become an informant for a gangster over the course of two hours.\n\n\"Frankly, the story isn't remotely as interesting as Cage. Nothing is. In Ferrara's movie, Keitel emptied himself out. But there's a hellion's joy in Cage's cop.\" —Wesley Morris, The Boston Globe\n\nOne of the more bizarre Cage films—and that's saying something, given the competition—this 2019 midnight movie from reclusive South African director Richard Stanley (perhaps best known for being fired from The Island of Dr. Moreau) is a trippy, visually inventive, humorous, and liberal adaptation of the H.P. Lovecraft story of the same name, and serves as a showcase for Nicolas Cage at his most unhinged. He plays the patriarch of a New England family that gradually begins to lose touch with reality after a colorful (but, as it turns out, sinister) meteorite lands on their alpaca-filled farm.\n\n\"Color Out of Space is full-bore, glorious B-movie Cage: Cranked up to 11, spattered with gore and bellowing about alpacas.\" —Sara Stewart, New York Post\n\nThe third Cage movie to open in 1984 serves as an excellent bookend to the first. While Racing With the Moon found the actor playing a young man about to head off to war with his hometown friend, the Alan Parker-directed Birdy finds Cage and Matthew Modine playing two teenagers returning from action—in this case, the Vietnam War—and heavily traumatized from their experiences. Adapted from William Wharton's novel, the film takes place in 1960s Philadelphia (and earlier, through numerous flashbacks) and made almost no money at the box office. But critics offered praise, and Birdy went on to win a special jury prize at Cannes when (in a move that would be rather unusual today) it was brought to the festival a year after its release.\n\nHow dedicated was Cage to his role as Al Columbato? According to director Parker, Cage wore bandages over his face on and off set during all four weeks of shooting and opted to have two of his teeth pulled to simulate shrapnel damage.\n\n\"Mr. Modine's performance is exceptionally sweet and graceful; Mr. Cage very sympathetically captures Al's urgency and frustration. Together, these actors work miracles with what might have been unplayable.\" —Janet Maslin, The New York Times\n\nA 1995 thriller from Single White Female and Reversal of Fortune director Barbet Schroeder, with a script by novelist Richard Price, Kiss of Death is a remake of the 1947 film noir with its story transplanted to (then-)present day Queens. David Caruso drew the most attention in the solid cast that also included Samuel L. Jackson and Helen Hunt—it was his first major big-screen starring role following his departure from TV's NYPD Blue—but his performance as a reformed ex-con didn't go over well with critics or moviegoers, and Caruso was ultimately nominated for a Razzie. But the rest of the cast and the film itself drew a more positive reception from critics, and Cage was singled out for a strong performance as the asthmatic, psychopathic gangster Little Junior Brown.\n\n\"The movie's streetwise screenwriter, Richard Price, knows characters like this do exist — but only an actor like Cage can bring them off.\" —Glenn Kenny, Entertainment Weekly\n\nThe same year that brought one of Cage's worst films (8MM) also found the prolific star working with legendary director Martin Scorsese for the first time, and the results were (unsurprisingly) much better. Starring alongside then-wife Patricia Arquette, Cage plays a depressed paramedic in a New York City plagued by drug overdoses in Scorsese's harrowing 1999 drama that reunited the director with his Taxi Driver and Raging Bull screenwriter Paul Schrader. In a recent Reddit AMA, Cage ranked his performance here among his three favorites (along with Pig and Leaving Las Vegas).\n\n\"In a role as tailor-made for him as the story is for its writer and director, Nicolas Cage anchors the movie with one of his best performances.\" —Mike Clark, USA Today\n\nFollowing 2009's The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans, Cage would embark on the busiest period of his career, releasing 30 films (some straight to video) from 2010's The Sorcerer's Apprentice to 2018's 211 as he worked to pay off a tax debt and other expenses. Shockingly, only one film during this period received positive reviews: 2014's Joe, an atmospheric arthouse drama from director David Gordon Green (Pineapple Express) adapted from Larry Brown's book of the same name. Cage plays the titular character, a rehabbed ex-con whose encounter with a 15-year-old boy (Tye Sheridan) who comes to him for a job leads to a consequential series of uniformly unpleasant events. Positive reviews didn't prevent the film, which was possibly hampered by the death of co-star Gary Poulter just prior to its release, from losing money at the box office, and it would be a few more years before Cage would even attempt to appear in another potentially decent movie (with a small part in Oliver Stone's Snowden, though that, too, failed to score positive reviews).\n\n\"Cage is getting down and dirty again in Joe, and it's pretty remarkable — the performance more so than the film, and the film's good.\" —Bill Goodykoontz, Arizona Republic\n\nNo less an authority on Nicolas Cage films than Nicolas Cage himself has deemed this 2023 black comedy from A24 his all-time best film, and critics seem to agree following the movie's TIFF unveiling. Sort of a Cage version of Being John Malkovich, this English-language debut from filmmaker Kristoffer Borgli (Sick of Myself) finds Cage playing schlubby college professor Paul Matthews, who suddenly and mysteriously begins appearing in everyone's dreams. And by \"everyone,\" we literally mean everyone on the planet (except, of course, for his wife), making Matthews an instant celebrity. But when those dreams start becoming nightmares, no one wants to be near him. While the cast (including Michael Cera, Julianne Nicholson, and Kate Berlant) is uniformly excellent, critics feel that Cage delivers one of his greatest performances in one of his funniest films to date.\n\n\"Part horror movie and part sideways swipe at cancel culture and social pariahdom, Dream Scenario is the sort of high-concept, surreal comedy that Michel Gondry, Spike Jonze, and Charlie Kaufman used to do on the regular - think Eternal Nicshine of the Spotless Cage.\" - David Fear, Rolling Stone\n\nDirector Francis Ford Coppola had cast his nephew in two previous films, but this 1986 rom-com fantasy is the first time that Cage had a major part in one of them. Of course, the titular role belongs to Kathleen Turner, who plays a woman who is newly estranged from Charlie (Cage), her husband and one-time high school sweetheart, and goes without him to her 25-year high school reunion, where she suffers a fainting spell. She awakens to discover herself back as her high school self in the year 1960, where she gets to see a new side of Charlie as events play out differently than the first time around.\n\nCage delivers an over-the-top performance as the would-be singer Charlie (adopting both false teeth and an unusual high-pitched and nasal voice) and failed to impress producers or co-stars with his on- and off-set antics. But the film was a hit and later inspired a stage musical.\n\n\"The film features good acting from almost everyone, the one notable exception being the annoying Cage who adopts a grating constricted voice for the role.\" —TV Guide\n\nLess of a fear-inducing horror film than early marketing and the filmmography of director Oz Perkins (The Blackcoat's Daughter) would suggest, this 2024 low-budget hit is instead more of a dread-filled serial killer procedural in the mold of The Silence of the Lambs. Cage plays the titular killer—who doesn't seem to murder anyone directly but instead somehow causes others to do his bidding—opposite Maika Monroe as the FBI agent trying to track him down.\n\n\"When it comes to high-wire acting with no net, Nicolas Cage is a rock star and the serial-killing satanic devil he plays here ranks with his bizarro best even when director Oz Perkins lets his plot slide into silliness. No matter—virtuoso Cage lights the spark and then, ka-boom!\" —Peter Travers, ABC News\n\nOne of a string of noir-like thrillers directed by John Dahl in the 1990s (and the last one that Dahl himself wrote), this twisty arthouse sensation stars Cage as an ex-Marine turned drifter who finds himself accidentally entangled in a murder-for-hire scheme in Red Rock, Wyoming, where he has gone seeking work. Lara Flynn Boyle, Dennis Hopper, and J.T. Walsh also star.\n\nRather unusually, Red Rock West skipped theaters in the United States and debuted on HBO in 1993 (after screening at TIFF), where an enterprising San Francisco theater owner saw the film and requested it to be screened in his theater in early 1994. A wildly successful run there led to a theatrical release in additional North American cities, preempting a planned VHS release. Only a few other films in history, including the cult classic Repo Man, followed this home video-to-theaters model.\n\n\"The acting is solid throughout, from Cage's subdued but fuming Michael and Hopper's familiarly psychotic Lyle, to Walsh's weaselly Wayne and Boyle's fatal femme. It is a treasure waiting to be discovered.\" —Richard Harrington, The Washington Post\n\nIt may not quite be John Wick But With a Pig—among other things, it's much smaller in scale and far more dramatic than action-oriented—but this 2021 indie drama features one of Cage's all-time great performances. In fact, many film writers feel that he should have been nominated for an Oscar for his powerful but relatively restrained performance as a chef turned reclusive Oregon truffle hunter who is forced to journey to his former home of Portland in pursuit of his kidnapped foraging pig.\n\nThough he didn't get that Oscar nomination, Cage was saluted as the best actor of 2021 by numerous critic groups. And writer-director Michael Sarnoski's debut film was also honored by multiple organizations and individual critics as one of the year's best movies and for its screenplay.\n\n\"This is primo Nicolas Cage dialogue, inquisitive and soul-deep, the kind of stuff he was born to say. To hear and watch him in this movie is like greeting an old friend. Pig seems to have come out of nowhere, but we're lucky to have it.\" —Stephanie Zacharek, Time\n\nAfter winning an Oscar for his most dramatic role to date in 1995's Leaving Las Vegas, Cage starred in a series of bigger-budget action films. The first two of those, The Rock and Con Air, were box office hits but didn't impress critics. The third, however, received very strong reviews despite boasting one of the wackier premises in recent film history.\n\nLegendary Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo's third Hollywood film and first for which he had creative control, 1997's Face/Off found Cage starring as a terrorist opposite an FBI agent played by John Travolta, who was in the middle of a career revival brought about by Pulp Fiction. Their action-packed cat-and-mouse game features a wildly implausible (but fun!) twist: Each one undergoes surgery to transform themselves into the exact appearance of the other, giving each actor the chance to perform a dual role (and impersonate the other).\n\nThough the film was a hit at the box office, it never received a sequel ... until, maybe, now. Director Adam Wingard (Godzilla vs. Kong, The Guest) is currently developing a new Face/Off film that was once rumored to be a remake but was recently confirmed to be a direct sequel, though casting and plot details have not been announced. Cage recently revealed that he would be up for appearing in the sequel if asked.\n\n\"Face/Off works like a charm right on down the line thanks to brilliant, exhilarating performances from Cage and Travolta, and the many tremendously enjoyable action set-pieces that are Woo's hallmark.\" —Marc Savlov, The Austin Chronicle\n\nA good movie by any measure, 2018's Mandy was welcomed especially warmly because it was an even rarer thing: a good Nicolas Cage movie—in fact, his best film in 16 years, and one that followed a decade of dreary paycheck projects. The trippy, action-driven horror film was (and still is) one of just two films directed by Panos Cosmatos (the other being the inferior Beyond the Black Rainbow), and it stars Cage as a lumberjack who pursues vengeance against his wife's killers. Set to a score by the late Jóhann Jí³hannsson, it's a journey filled with hallucinogenic images, heavy metal, primal screams, and dueling chainsaws. (And oh so much blood.) Critics began singing Mandy's praises when it debuted at Sundance in early 2018, and while the film didn't make an impact at the box office, solid VOD viewership cemented its standing as a cult classic.\n\n\"It's a fully immersive experience that begs to be anchored by someone who's lit from within by blinding neon, but who also, amidst all of the nutty squalls of genre scuzz can still wear his broken heart on his sleeve. And, these days, that list is a short one. In fact, there's really only one name on it. Thankfully, Cosmatos found him.\" —Chris Nashawaty, Entertainment Weekly\n\nThe best-reviewed movie in Cage's first decade of work, Norman Jewison's unconventional 1987 rom-com classic stars Cher as a Brooklyn widow who gets engaged to her current boyfriend (Danny Aiello), only to fall for his estranged, opera-loving younger brother, played by Cage in an endearingly offbeat performance. Moonstruck became a major box office hit and collected six Oscar nominations, winning for Cher's lead performance (she beat out Holly Hunter and her career-defining role in rival rom-com Broadcast News), Olympia Dukakis's supporting performance, and the screenplay by future Pulitzer and Tony winner John Patrick Shanley (Doubt) in his film debut.\n\nCage was only 23 when the film was shot— that's 17 years younger than his opposite, Cher. (And he was still missing those two teeth he had pulled for Birdy.) But Cher pushed Jewison to give Cage the part over numerous other actors considered for the role, including Tom Cruise, Bill Murray, and Ray Liotta. And Cage was rewarded with the first Golden Globe nomination of his career.\n\n\"What makes it a truly wonderful film is that the lines are so incredibly surprising. Bizarre, deranged even, and yet somehow entirely plausible.\" —Helen Sullivan, The Guardian\n\nTied for the title of Cage's best-reviewed live-action film to date is this quirky and highly original 2002 dramedy from the Being John Malkovich team of director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. It's both an adaptation of Susan Orlean's seemingly unadaptable nonfiction best-seller The Orchid Thief and a movie about adapting The Orchid Thief into a movie, with Cage starring both as Kaufman and his much more successful (but completely fictional) twin brother Donald Kaufman. (In a particularly meta touch, Donald—who, we remind you, is completely fictional—is one of the film's credited screenwriters.) Meryl Streep also stars as Orlean, while Chris Cooper plays the titular subject of Orlean's book, a Florida horticulturist and orchid poacher.\n\nCritics obviously loved Adaptation., which came in the middle of a particularly busy period for Cage that saw him star in nine movies in a four-year span. In addition to landing on numerous year-end top 10 lists, the film went on to secure four Oscar nominations, including one for Cage (though he lost to The Pianist's Adrien Brody).\n\n\"It's a testament to Cage's canny performance and Jonze's seamless use of special effects that you believe Charlie and Donald are two entirely different people.\" —Carrie Rickey, The Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nThis beloved 2018 animated take on the iconic superhero—one of the best comic book movies of all time in any format—may not immediately pop into your mind when you hear the phrase \"Nicolas Cage movie.\" But he makes an appearance (at least in voice form) as one of the film's many extradimensional spider-folk: Spider-Man Noir, a black-and-white, 1930s version of the web-slinger. Cage used James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson as inspiration for his vocal performance, which he delivered in \"full Cage\" mode, to use his own words.\n\n\"Fresh, funny and frequently bonkers, Into The Spider-Verse is an astonishing shot of cinematic superhero adrenaline. For such an over-familiar character, somehow, this feels original and entirely new.\" —John Nugent, Empire"
