        "text": "I too enjoyed Joy Ride; I still have the old Fox Roadkill DVD. I haven't seen Unforgettable; I'm downloading it now, but sadly it will go to the end of a long queue. I was amused by the final sentences of Roger Ebert's (RIP) review: \"...at the end I found myself thinking back to Fiorentino's experiment. The first rat couldn't find its way through the maze, and was cornered by the cat. The second rat, after an injection of brain fluid, zipped through the maze. Trying to find my way through this plot, I felt like the first rat.\"\n\nYes, 'Unforgettable' was poorly received. May even have gone 'straight to video' over here in the U.K. But it is pulpy b-movie fun with decent performances - particularly Liotta (and Fiorentino - who disappeared from acting afterwards - is VERY different from her character in 'Last Seduction').\n\nYeah, 'Joyride (aka Roadkill)' is fab. One of the late Paul Walker's best performances and some good quips from the underrated Steve Zahn as his older brother.\n\nVery happy memories of first seeing Red Rock West, have the old R1 DVD from >20 years ago, so picked it up at HMV. Yes, £17.99.\n\nHave had a quick look at first 20 minutes. Dialog is more on-the-nose than I remember, at least at the start, but oh you get sucked in so fast! Haven’t investigated the commentary tracks, but looking forward to doing so.\n\nIncludes nice booklet with essay on the film. And one of those mini posters. What do people do with these things? Too creased to frame and display… Just novelty I guess. Not complaining, adds a little amusement I suppose.\n\nDef don’t need the DVD tho. It’s 2022. Who buys this and says “Ooh, it’s on DVD too, that’s good.” Would rather a single disc and knock £2 off the price.\n\nAnyhow, just on brief inspection:\n\nIt’s HD, and tho I haven’t seen the German BR, I assume this is the best it’s looked on disc. Packaging says aspect ratio is 1.37:1 which is a mistake (thank god), it’s not, it’s 1.85:1. Thin letterbox bars top and bottom. Sounds good, just one audio track, receiver jumped into DTS Neural X. So that’s the good stuff.\n\nPicture-wise it’s an average transfer I’m afraid. Not the worst thing I’ve seen, but not up to the best modern standards. Quite a lot of grain, edge enhancement and sharpening is pretty obvious on a 65” LG C8 OLED with the sharpness at zero (Cage’s profile against a clear blue sky, ouch). Colours? I’d need to compare with a print, but does seem to have a bit of a “video” colour palette to it - muted dusky orange colours, strong blues, greys maybe a bit cool - not sure how accurate it is to the original, maybe that’s what a print looks like too. It doesn’t bug me, but not blowing me away.\n\nFine detail is there eg weave of his jeans, but there’s a layer of noise-reduced noise/grain over everything which smudges it away quite a bit. If this was done to suppress film grain, I’d rather have had the film grain. But of course, film grain and digital compression don’t play nice with each other either, so maybe this was the best compromise possible when the disc was authored.\n\nMost obvious tho is subtle vertical frame jitter, noticeable not only in the titles, but throughout the movie. It’s a bit distracting, guess we’re spoiled by all these movies that are finished digitally and look rock-solid, but there are many transfers of older movies that don’t suffer from this.\n\n(Does this suggest it’s a “telecine” style transfer rather than a digital scan? Likely from a print rather than the negative? I don’t know enough about the process to say.)\n\nSo is it everything I hoped for? Not really. Is it about what I expected. I suppose so. Am I overjoyed to have it? YES.\n\nThis is not meant as a criticism of Plan B, I suppose you have to work with whatever elements are made available to you. Would love to see this film get a better transfer one day, but who knows if that’ll ever happen in our lifetimes (I waited 22 years for this version), so if you like the cast - Cage is so young here, you forget he was a bit of a pinup in the early 90s - and you enjoy sharp, twisty, noir thrillers, I’d buy this one now and enjoy the heck out of it. I will pick great movies with average transfers over perfectly scanned bad movies every time.\n\nHTH."
