        "text": "Cut the Snyder Release – Rebel Moon: Part Two (2024) on Netflix\n\nReleased at the end of 2023, Zack Snyder’s would-be sci-fi epic Rebel Moon: Part One turned out to be such a non-event that I half-expected Netflix to quietly scuttle the sequel without making a fuss or drawing attention to it. Honestly, would anyone have even noticed if it simply never showed up when originally announced?… Read More Cut the Snyder Release – Rebel Moon: Part Two (2024) on Netflix\n\nDon’t Lose Your Head – Fallout Season 1 (2024) on Amazon Prime Video\n\nConsidering how extensively the popular Fallout video game series satirizes American consumerist and media cultures, the fact that its inevitable live-action television adaptation would be produced by retail giant Amazon for distribution on its streaming service seems both fitting and more than a touch ironic. That the first season of the show would actually turn… Read More Don’t Lose Your Head – Fallout Season 1 (2024) on Amazon Prime Video\n\nState of the Badass Art – Aliens (1986) 4K Ultra HD\n\nI’ve watched James Cameron’s Aliens countless times over the years. I own numerous copies of it across multiple home video formats. As far as I’m concerned, Aliens is a nearly perfect movie, as as a sequel or taken on its own. The film takes everything that was great about the original Alien, expands it in… Read More State of the Badass Art – Aliens (1986) 4K Ultra HD\n\nYou Do Not Have Time to Tango – True Lies (1994) 4K Ultra HD\n\nJames Cameron’s 1994 action blockbuster True Lies had been neglected for so long during the home video era that most fans gave up hope for a decent release of it years ago. Remarkably, after literal decades of unfulfilled rumors, what seemed impossible finally happened. Cameron’s production company Lightstorm Entertainment (via its current corporate distributor, Disney)… Read More You Do Not Have Time to Tango – True Lies (1994) 4K Ultra HD\n\nPeople Seem a Little Aggressive Around Here – Road House (2024) on Amazon Prime Video\n\nI can’t say I recall ever hearing anyone beg for a remake of Road House. The original 1989 film is both a product of the time it was made that can’t easily translate to the current day, and is still pretty much perfect for what it set out to be. The movie didn’t need a… Read More People Seem a Little Aggressive Around Here – Road House (2024) on Amazon Prime Video\n\nI Thought You’d Be Bigger – Road House (1989) Vinegar Syndrome 4K Ultra HD\n\nFor a cult film with such an exalted reputation, Road House winds up being surprisingly modest in scope or ambition when you watch it play out. As a young boy who hit his teenage years in the late 1980s, I’d of course seen the movie before, and more than once, but my last viewing was… Read More I Thought You’d Be Bigger – Road House (1989) Vinegar Syndrome 4K Ultra HD\n\nOne Lucky Son of a Bitch – Red Rock West (1993) Blu-ray\n\nEven though David Lynch may not have had anything to do with making it, the 1993 noir thriller Red Rock West features an interesting convergence of actors who had recently worked with the director, albeit not at the same time. With Nicolas Cage (Wild at Heart), Dennis Hopper (Blue Velvet), and Lara Flynn Boyle (Twin… Read More One Lucky Son of a Bitch – Red Rock West (1993) Blu-ray\n\nDistress Signals – Damsel (2024) on Netflix\n\nThe Netflix fantasy adventure film Damsel puts a modern feminist spin on some of the most traditionally sexist tropes of the fairy tale genre. That really shouldn’t be too controversial a thing to do, but because our real world is such a dumpster fire right now, probably will be. Some members of the viewing audience… Read More Distress Signals – Damsel (2024) on Netflix\n\nObligatory Oscar Winners Announcement – 2024 Edition\n\nThe time has come once more for the film industry’s biggest night of self-congratulatory back-patting. Perhaps this year more than ever, I’m just not feeling it. The front-running movie felt preordained to win both the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars ever since the moment the nominations were announced, and quite honestly, I could not… Read More Obligatory Oscar Winners Announcement – 2024 Edition"
