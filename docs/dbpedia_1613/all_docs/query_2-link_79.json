        "text": "An interesting update on #Rosneft's Arctic mega-project #VostokOil. \"State oil company #Rosneft plans to build a terminal for reloading of oil only few kilometres from the Northern Fleet headquarters in Severomorsk.\" \"The projected terminal is to be located in Guba Pitkova, a site on the western shore of the Kola Bay only about ten kilometres from Severomorsk. It is to serve #VostokOil, #Rosneft’s major project currently under development in the remote Arctic region of Taymyr. According to plan, ice-class tankers will shuttle millions of tons from Taymyr to the new terminal facility, where conventional tankers will pick up the load and ship it to export destinations. Not much is known about its configuration, but the terminal could form a pier that stretches into the Kola Bay. #Rosneft subsidiary company PKK Logistic held public hearings in Aleksandrovsk, the local municipality, in spring 2022. Judging from company documents, the terminal will be able to serve 200,000 ton tankers. It will also include a stationary 300,000 ton floating storage vessel.\" Note that Kola Bay is already home to two floating oil storage units (#FSU). One is #Lukoil's 'Kola', which receives oil from the Varandey oil export terminal in the Pechora Sea. The other is #GazpromNeft's 'Umba', which receives oil from the company's Prirazlomnaya Platform in the Pechora Sea and from the Arctic Gates oil export facility just off the east coast of the Yamal Peninsula. The #VostokOil Project will involve exports of oil along the #NorthernSeaRoute (#NSR), both westbound (via this new terminal) and eastbound, presumably via another transshipment terminal. https://lnkd.in/gSz9dPnm\n\n#Northern Sea #Route To Have New Eastern and Western Logistics Terminals #Logistics #terminals in Bilibino and Arkhangelsk, each with the capacity to handle 36,000 tonnes of cargo per annum, will be build by #Russia’s Promstroyarktik LLC , according to the Chukotka’s governor’s office. The project will be carried out with the Far East and Arctic Development Corporation (FEDC) under the Arctic Free Trade Zone, which offers preferential tax treatments. The terminals are scheduled to open in 2026. Bilibino is in Russia’s Chukota region in the Far East, while Arkhangelsk is on the White Sea in the West, 1,250km north of Moscow. They represent the beginning and the end of the Northern Sea Route. They are intended for the transportation of cargo both along the route and will service trucking companies in the Arctic Zone. The warehouse complexes will consist of outdoor and indoor storage where they will receive, ship and transfer #cargo between various multimodal types of onward transport. The first floating nuclear power plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, in Chukotka was launched in 2020 and provides 70 MWe power and heat to the nearby coastal areas. https://lnkd.in/dstdKC5w\n\n🚂🇬🇧 UK's 775m-Long Freight Trains vs 🇲🇷 Mauritania's Epic Iron Ore Train: A Tale of Two Rail Giants The UK's rail network witnessed a remarkable evolution in 2021 with the introduction of the new 775m-long freight trains. Operated by DP World from the ports at Southampton and London Gateway, these trains are a symbol of modern efficiency and environmental responsibility. 🌍🚆 🔍 Let's put this into perspective: Each of these UK trains is the length of over seven football pitches! They carry an additional 12 to 14 containers compared to standard freight trains, significantly enhancing capacity and reducing carbon footprint. 🌱🚂 Now, compare this with the legendary Mauritania iron ore train. In operation since 1963, this train is a staggering 3 kilometers long - that's about 30 football pitches end-to-end! It takes a gruelling 20-hour journey through the Sahara, from the mining centre of Zouérat to the port city of Nouadhibou. 🏜️⏳ 🇲🇷 The Mauritania train, with its sheer scale and endurance, is a testament to traditional industrial might. In contrast, the UK's 🇬🇧 775m trains, although smaller, embody cutting-edge technology and a commitment to sustainability. Both trains are extraordinary in their own rights. The UK's 🇬🇧 innovation in rail transport provides a blueprint for future sustainable logistics, while Mauritania's 🇲🇷 enduring train represents the relentless pursuit of economic development amidst challenging environments. 🌐 These rail titans, while differing in age, length, and purpose, both showcase the remarkable capabilities and diversity of rail transport across the globe. They stand as proud symbols of their respective nations' engineering achievements and contributions to the global economy. 🌟🛤️ This poses the question: How can we adapt our infrastructure 🏗️ and commercial strategies 💼 to ensure that rail freight 🚂 is not just a viable option but the preferred choice for the future of transport ? #RailTransport #UKRailInnovation 🇬🇧 #MauritaniaIndustrialMight 🇲🇷 #SustainableLogistics #Rail #transport #EngineeringExcellence 🛠️"
