Then only the ocean and the North Pole!\n\nTeriberka is the only place in Russia that can be reached by road to see the Arctic Ocean. It's not a quick way, but it's worth it! Are you ready? Then let's go!\n\nDo not forget, the warming tincture is always with us!\n\nAfter reaching Teriberka, we will have lunch at a restaurant overlooking the ocean. We will be served sea fish soup and grilled Murmansk cod steak.\n\nThen we check into a hotel right on the shore of the Barents Sea. With panoramic views of the picturesque cliffs and hills, and the sea bay.\n\nSalty air, silence and a sense of peace will be your constant companions. You will feel the amazing magic of this place!\n\nAfter a short rest in the room, we go for a walk and get acquainted with the old Teriberka, swing on the famous swing, listen to the sound of the waves of the Arctic Ocean.Â\n\nWe will walk through the filming locations of the movie \"Leviathan\" and see a stranded ship.\n\nAfter a walk through Teriberka, a northern sauna will be organized for us.Â We are warming up, relaxing and going to dinner!\n\nThey will be waiting for us at the author's restaurant of Nordic cuisine.

It is impossible to convey in words the atmosphere of a trip across the Arctic Ocean... It's better to see it with your own eyes!\n\nAfter the walk, we go for lunch to one of the best restaurants in Teriberka.Â\n\nWe will be served a morel with northern shrimps and tender venison with baked carrot cream with juniper.\n\nFor dessert â brownies with sugar cranberries, salted caramel and powdered aspen.
