The Siberian Generating Company (SGK), owned by SUEK, is also listed as a key partner of the port.[3] In addition to the Murmansk Commercial Seaport, SUEK also operates the Murmansk Bulk Terminal, which mostly handles fertilizers and mining products such as iron ore.[4]\n\nIn 2015, the Murmansk Commercial Seaport had a throughput capacity of 13 million tonnes and sent most of its exports to UK, Germany, and Israel. In terms of production capacity, the port was the second largest among the ports of CIS and Baltic countries handling coal. In 2010 the seaport transshiped about 9.5 million tonnes of coal.[5] The port's capacity increased since then; the seaport handled 17.5 million tonnes of cargo in 2019,[6] including 16.2 million tonnes of coal.[1] The majority of coal handled at the port comes from SUEK's mines in the Kuzbass region.[7]\n\nIn 2020, shipping activity ground to a halt for several weeks due to a collapsed railway bridge.[8] Nevertheless, traffic volumes remained high - the Murmansk Commercial Seaport handled 16.4 million tonnes of coal in 2020.[4]\n\nIn September 2020, the port announced that it would seek to replace falling volumes of coal cargo with iron ore and fertilizer.[9] In 2022, the port handled 12.6 million tonnes of coal.[10]\n\nProject Details\n\nOwner: Murmansk Commercial Sea Port JSC (MMTP)\n\nParent: Siberian Coal Energy Company JSC (SUEK)\n\nLocation: Kola Bay, Northern Russia\n\nCoal Capacity (Million tonnes per annum): 18 (estimated)\n\nStatus: Operating\n\nType: Exports (UK, Germany, and Israel)\n\nSource of Coal: SUEK AG's Kuzbass mines\n\nArticles and Resources\n\nSources\n\nRelated GEM.wiki articles\n\nGlobal use and production of coal\n\nCoal terminals\n\nCoal reserves\n\nExternal resources"
