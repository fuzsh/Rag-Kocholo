        "text": "By Elizaveta Vereykina\n\nA large oil spill was detected in the Pervomaysky district of Murmansk city – the capital of the Russian Arctic.\n\nThe spill has appeared in the very inner part of the Kola fjord – along the Tuloma River that flows into the Barents Sea, Russian environmental watchdog Rosprirodnadzor reported on July 15 in Vkontakte.\n\n“Water samples have been taken, – the watchdog reported, – Significant excesses of the maximum permissible concentration for the pollutant “petroleum” have been established. The spill is spreading downstream towards the Barents Sea. Along the entire route of the pollution, saturated spots of oil products are observed on the shoreline of the Kola Bay.”\n\nStill searching for those responsible\n\nAuthorities have so far tested water in two locations – around the Kolsky bridge in the Pervomaysky district of Murmansk and around the bridge in the town of Kola in the Murmansk suburbs. The watchdog experts suggest the initial source of both spills is the same and is located further upstream.\n\n“The area of ​​the polluted water was 591 square meters, – the watchdog reported in VKontakte, – The maximum permissible concentration for the pollutant “petroleum products” was found to be 400 times higher.”\n\nDespite the fact that the spill was discovered on 1 July, the authorities are still trying to find those responsible for it and are calling on the public to help:\n\n“We are asking eyewitnesses who have any information about the perpetrators to provide assistance and available supporting materials.”\n\nRelated stories from around the North:\n\nCanada: Cyanide detected in creek after Victoria Gold’s heap leach failure at Eagle gold mine, CBC News"
