        "text": "Murmansk is a city in the far northwest part of Russia (1h 40min flight from St. Petersburg, 2h flight from Moscow), where the polar night lasts three months of the year. Throughout the hard arctic winter, aurora borealis is visible in the outer-city sky. Most striking is the architecture of the city: to escape from the colour starvation during the grey and dark winter-time, citizens paint their panel houses with bright colours. On the street, you can find painted stones and benches. Filming in Murmansk at winter time is challenging but possible.\n\nDespite the low temperatures, the Murmansk port continues to operate. Barents sea does not freeze due to the warm North Atlantic Current. The port of Murmansk is not only the largest trading and fishing northern port of Russia: it also houses Russian Atomflot, the nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet.\n\nMurmansk is a major transportation hub in the polar region. Murmansk railway station is an important part of the Oktyabrskaya Railway. The station building with a dome topped with a spire and a five-pointed star was built in 1954. From there, trains depart to Moscow, St. Petersburg and Sochi.\n\nTeriberka is a village located in the Murmansk Oblast, Russia, on the shores of the Barents Sea. The village was founded in the 16th century as a fishing and hunting settlement by the indigenous Sami people. Throughout the centuries, Teriberka has been occupied by various foreign powers, including the Swedes and the Finns. During the Soviet era, the village became a major centre for fishing and processing of seafood. Today, Teriberka is known for its stunning natural beauty, attracting tourists from all over the world.\n\nFilmspbTV is a professional film production company that specialises in organizing film shoots in the Russian arctic region.
