A state-backed Saudi venture would buy stakes in mining assets worth $15 billion in African countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea and Namibia, which will permit U.S. companies to have rights to buy some of the production, the report added. The U.S. is in a race to catch up with China for supplies of cobalt, lithium and other metals that are used in electric car batteries, laptops and smartphones. In a similar arrangement in July, Saudi Arabian Mining Co (Ma’aden) (1211.SE) and the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) acquired 10% of Brazilian Vale’s base metal unit, while U.S. investment firm Engine No. 1 acquired 3%. The newspaper said the PIF approached Congo in June about investing in cobalt, copper and tantalum in the country via its $3 billion joint venture with Ma’aden called Manara Minerals. Manara is also focusing on iron ore, nickel and lithium. The White House is seeking the financial backing of other sovereign-wealth funds in the region, but talks with Saudi Arabia have progressed the farthest, the Journal added.\n\nNot just supply but rare earth prices demand US act in Arctic\n\nReuters, reporters Amy Lv and Mai Nguyen, “Chinese reare earth prices hit 20 month high on Myanmar supply worry, September 7, 2023, https://wealthgrowthdaily.com/chinese-rare-earth-prices/\n\nBEIJING/HANOI (Reuters) –Chinese rare earth prices jumped to their highest in 20 months, as mining suspension in major producer Myanmar sparked stockpiling ahead of the peak consumption season, analysts said on Thursday. Prices of dysprosium oxide leapt to 2,610 yuan ($356) per kilogramme on Wednesday, the highest since May 2022, latest data provided by Shanghai Metals Market (SMM) on LSEG Eikon showed. Terbium oxide prices rose to 8,600 yuan a kilogramme, a level unseen since July 3. Mines in Myanmar’s Pangwa region in Kachin State, the country’s biggest source of rare earth, have been closed from Monday in preparation for inspections during Sept. 6-7, consultancy SMM said in a report on Thursday. “A local miner said they have not resumed production and are waiting for a notice on the next step from the inspection team,” said Yang Jiawen, an analyst at SMM.\n\nMyanmar mines and exports rare earth minerals\n\nReuters, reporters Amy Lv and Mai Nguyen, “Chinese reare earth prices hit 20 month high on Myanmar supply worry, September 7, 2023, https://wealthgrowthdaily.com/chinese-rare-earth-prices/\n\nRare earth is a prized group of 17 minerals used in consumer electronics and military equipment. Myanmar accounted for 38% of rare earth imports into China in January-July, Chinese trade data showed, while the Southeast Asian country was the fourth biggest source of rare earth mining in 2022, data by the U.S. Geological Survey showed.\n\nChina could have rare earth supply problems\n\nReuters, reporters Amy Lv and Mai Nguyen, “Chinese reare earth prices hit 20 month high on Myanmar supply worry, September 7, 2023, https://wealthgrowthdaily.com/chinese-rare-earth-prices/\n\nWorry of possible supply disruptions amid environmental inspections in late August in Jiangxi province, one of China’s major rare earth production hubs, also added to the price hike, she added. China’s imports of rare earths surged 76% year-on-year to 12,673 metric tons in August, and volumes in the first eight months jumped 54.4% to 118,426 tons, Chinese trade data showed.\n\nArctic has 30% of undiscovered oil and natural gas\n\nBiagioni, 9-5, 23, Matilde Biagioni holds a Master’s degree in International Relations from Roma Tre University and is currently Chief Coordinator of the Asia-Pacific team for the Opinio Juris review., The International Spectator, China’s Push-in Strategy in the Arctic and Its Impact on Regional Governance, https://www.iai.it/en/pubblicazioni/chinas-push-strategy-arctic-and-its-impact-regional-governance\n\nIn parallel, the enormous potential of Arctic resources has fuelled the growing interest of states in the region. The Arctic is home to 13 per cent and 30 per cent of undiscovered oil and natural gas respectively, as well as large amounts of raw materials and mineral resources.[2]\n\nArctic key to China’s energy security\n\nBiagioni, 9-5, 23, Matilde Biagioni holds a Master’s degree in International Relations from Roma Tre University and is currently Chief Coordinator of the Asia-Pacific team for the Opinio Juris review., The International Spectator, China’s Push-in Strategy in the Arctic and Its Impact on Regional Governance, https://www.iai.it/en/pubblicazioni/chinas-push-strategy-arctic-and-its-impact-regional-governance\n\nChina’s dependence on imported oil is currently over 70 per cent and predicted to increase further in the coming years, while imports account for more than 40 per cent of the country’s total natural gas supply.[4] Hence, the Arctic may significantly contribute to Chinese energy security.\n\nArctic resource development encourages China-Russia ties\n\nBiagioni, 9-5, 23, Matilde Biagioni holds a Master’s degree in International Relations from Roma Tre University and is currently Chief Coordinator of the Asia-Pacific team for the Opinio Juris review., The International Spectator, China’s Push-in Strategy in the Arctic and Its Impact on Regional Governance, https://www.iai.it/en/pubblicazioni/chinas-push-strategy-arctic-and-its-impact-regional-governance\n\nTo develop the Polar Silk Road and its push-in into the Arctic affairs, China has developed relations with the Arctic states, above all, Russia, Iceland and Greenland.\n\nFollowing Western sanctions imposed on Russia due to the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Moscow and Beijing have grown closer as strategic allies, and the Arctic has gradually turned into a long-term cooperation region. Russia is a relevant player in the Arctic Council due to its extent and proximity to the Arctic Circle. After 2014, the PRC started to invest in the Yamal project, a joint venture around a liquified natural gas plant located in the North-East of the Yamal Peninsula, in northwest Siberia. In 2016, Chinese banks loaned 12 billion US dollars to the plant, effectively stepping in as a potential lender and covering two-thirds of the project’s external financing demands.[10] China’s National Petroleum Corporation and the Chinese company Silk Road Fund now have a 20 per cent and 9.9 per cent share in the project, respectively.[11] The Yamal plant is paramount because it is one of the Polar Silk Road’s initial projects. It showcases Beijing’s commitment to providing logistical support, such as port building and infrastructure in the Arctic; indeed, Chinese engineers have been involved in the development of infrastructure in the Yamal Peninsula, including a Chinese-made polar drilling rig. Moreover, in April 2023, the Russian and Chinese Coast Guard signed an Arctic cooperation agreement to strengthen maritime law and collaborate on joint exercises in the future.[12] In parallel, pre-existing cooperation between Russia’s and other Arctic states’ coast guards through the Arctic Coast Guard Forum was suspended as a result of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, boosting the role of Beijing as a strategic partner for Moscow.[13]\n\nRussia militarizing the Arctic\n\nKatz, 9-5, 23, Breaking Defense, Admiral sounds alarm amid rising Russian, Chinese movement in high north, https://breakingdefense.com/2023/09/admiral-sounds-alarm-amid-rising-russian-chinese-movement-in-high-north/\n\nNORFOLK, Va. — The melting of the polar ice caps combined with increased Russian ship movements is driving “heightened awareness” of the arctic region among US Navy leadership, who are increasingly concerned about the possibility for geopolitical rivals to make unfounded claims to vital sea lanes and natural resources. “Russia has made a decision to militarize that space,” Adm. Daryl Caudle, commander of US Fleet Forces, told Breaking Defense in an interview here in August. “That’s increased our need to actually go pay attention to what they’re doing, to make sure we’re not ceding that territory, to make sure they’re not … first to market in an area that has normally not been heavily transited.” As the head of US Fleet Forces, Caudle is a top advisor and the maritime component commander to US Northern Command chief Gen. Glen VanHerck, whose area of responsibility includes a large portion of the arctic region. (The Navy considers any geography north of the Arctic Circle as part of the region. Specific parts also fall under the responsibility of US European Command and US Indo-Pacific Command.) During an interview, Caudle said the service has noticed both Russia and China taking more interest in the arctic, particularly Moscow, which is militarizing “their coastline… from coastal defense, cruise missiles, long-range aviation, undersea systems [and] radar systems.” “We’re seeing an enhancement in how they are viewing that part of their northern border, and how they’re actually patrolling” more often, he said. “Because of that we are concerned about what they may or may not be doing.” The admiral explained that with the melting of the ice caps, the arctic is becoming one of the fastest routes to move ships between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, something Caudle said the Navy has observed Russia doing more frequently. Beyond the military’s interest in those routes, civilian mariners will also inevitably begin using it for commerce — and keeping international sea lanes open is a longstanding mission the US Navy maintains.\n\nUkraine war killed Arctic cooperation\n\nBenjamin Valentino Martin and Krista Viksnins, Center for European Policy Analysis, 8-30, 23, Ripples From Putin’s Invasion Reach the Arctic, https://cepa.org/article/ripples-from-putins-invasion-reach-the-arctic/\n\nThe damage done by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is hard to quantify. To stalled grain shipments, world hunger, soaring energy prices, and rampant inflation must be added the baleful effects for one of the most remote and uninhabitable regions of the world, the Arctic. The war has essentially frozen the region’s preeminent governing body, the Arctic Council. For decades, the Council has been a shining star of light-touch, collaborative governance. Driven by its mandate of sustainable development and environmental protection, its work has informed some of the most significant legally binding international agreements and treaties like the International Maritime Organization’s Polar Code and the Arctic section of the annual Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. This work ground to a halt in March 2022, as the other seven Arctic States — the United States, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland — “paused” their cooperation with Russia. In a joint statement in June, the “Arctic 7” announced a “limited resumption of our work in the Arctic Council, in projects that do not involve the participation of the Russian Federation.” However, without data from Russia’s roughly 45% share of the Arctic, the Council’s working groups cannot possibly function at full capacity. “One thing is clear — the Arctic Council will not return to ‘normal,’” says CEPA Fellow Mathieu Boulègue. Having forsaken its traditional “leave politics at the door” policy by excluding Russia, the Council must now evolve to compensate for today’s realities. The Arctic has changed significantly since the Council’s inception in 1996 and according to Boulègue, the traditional “High North — low tension” paradigm in the region has been replaced by a “high-octane” environment of geopolitical competition and crisis.\n\nChina has military capabilities in the Arctic\n\nRob Huebert is a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and associate professor of political science at the University of Calgary, “China is on a relentless mission to control Canada’s Arctic waters”, The Globe and Mail, published August 25, 2023, updated August 27, 2023, https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-china-is-on-a-relentless-mission-to-control-canadas-arctic-waters/\n\nEver since an icebreaker called Xue Long arrived in Tuktoyaktuk, NWT, in 1999, Canadians have been curious about China’s interest in the Canadian Arctic. While some observers view China’s presence in the region as benign, even benefiting Arctic science and research, recent Chinese actions and announcements are pointing to Beijing’s determination to have a military capability in the region that will exceed that of Canada. China has already developed the ability to deploy underwater listening devices that can be used to track American and other allied submarines in the Arctic, and in about two years the country will have deep-diving submersibles that can be used in those waters. So, unlike Canada, they will be able to listen to what is happening under the ice cap and will have the ability to deploy assets there accordingly.\n\nEarlier this year, there was major news-media coverage of a series of Chinese high-altitude balloons (HABs) that flew over North American airspace, as well as Chinese monitoring buoys that floated (or were deployed) into Canadian waters.\n\nChina has underwater listening capabilities\n\nRob Huebert is a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and associate professor of political science at the University of Calgary, “China is on a relentless mission to control Canada’s Arctic waters”, The Globe and Mail, published August 25, 2023, updated August 27, 2023, https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-china-is-on-a-relentless-mission-to-control-canadas-arctic-waters/\n\nWhat has not received as much attention is a research paper, published in 2021, in which Chinese scientists explain their success in developing Arctic-resilient underwater listening systems. The paper says the listening systems are for peaceful purposes, but the actual ramifications of the HABs, buoys and research systems are inescapable. China is refining its means of monitoring the Canadian North.\n\nThis ability to monitor underwater activity is troubling for Canada. First, Canada itself has no such ability to monitor its own regions. Second, it means that any allied submarines in or near these waters can be closely tracked by the Chinese, which is a tremendous strategic benefit considering that a submarine’s main advantage in this situation is its ability to operate undetected. For years, American and British subs have worked carefully to utilize their ability to discreetly patrol Arctic waters. This advantage will soon end.\n\nChina’s new icebreaker will have deep diving submersibles that pose a threat\n\nRob Huebert is a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and associate professor of political science at the University of Calgary, “China is on a relentless mission to control Canada’s Arctic waters”, The Globe and Mail, published August 25, 2023, updated August 27, 2023, https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-china-is-on-a-relentless-mission-to-control-canadas-arctic-waters/\n\nA second major announcement by China this summer is that it is building a third icebreaker. Expected to enter service in 2025, this one will be outfitted with deep-diving submersibles. This development would enable China to interfere with any underwater cables or pipelines if it chooses to do so, since these deep-diving submersibles could likely attach listening devices to communications cables, or simply cut them, without Canada having any knowledge of who has taken such action. Canada has no such deep-diving capability and has never indicated any interest in acquiring such assets.\n\nChina will probably develop a nuclear powered submarine\n\nAs a recent Auditor-General’s report makes clear, Canada may soon lose the capacity to use its own satellites to monitor even surface activities in the Arctic. The potential ramifications are worrisome: For example, the Chinese could copy Russian capabilities and place deep-diving submersibles on nuclear-powered submarines designed to operate in Arctic waters. While there is no public information that China has or is building an equivalent to the Russian Belgorod submarine, which can carry the Losharik deep-diving mini-submarine (which can pick up objects from the sea floor), it is logical to assume China will soon advance to such systems.\n\nChina had its eye on the Arctic but several specific programs fell apart\n\nAndrew Latham is a professor of international relations at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minn., a Senior Fellow at the Institute for Peace and Diplomacy, and a non-resident fellow at Defense Priorities in Washington, D.C, “How China’s Arctic plans went awry”, The Hill, August 23, 2023, https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4166188-how-chinas-arctic-plans-went-awry/\n\nWhat grand future had Beijing planned for itself in the Arctic? Leaving aside the massively overblown claims that China has committed itself to dominating the region, aspiring to become the Arctic superpower, there is little doubt that Beijing has long aspired to become a major player in the high north.\n\nClimate change and the shrinking of the polar ice cap have transformed the Arctic into what China officially classifies as one of the world’s “new strategic frontiers,” a space ripe with new opportunities to extract natural resources (oil, gas, rare earth elements and even fish), to invest in infrastructure and to develop new and more secure shipping routes (the Northern Sea Route and the Transpolar Sea Route).\n\nSo it is perhaps unsurprising that China would have developed an ambitious vision of itself as a “near-Arctic” power, perhaps even a “polar great power,” over the past decade or so. But what was China’s Arctic strategy? Answers can be found in statements such as China’s 2018 White Paper, various speeches delivered by President Xi Jinping and senior Chinese officials with responsibility for Arctic policy, and a number of People’s Liberation Army military publications.\n\nFirst, the plan was to become a polar great power by building on China’s record of scientific diplomacy. While outwardly promoting the pursuit of scientific research for the common good, China’s prominent scientific figures, and high-level members of the Chinese Communist Party, asserted that scientific endeavors are also driven by the desire to assert a “right to speak” about Arctic affairs, to cultivate China’s identity as an Arctic stakeholder, and to ensure access to strategic resources.\n\nSecond, the plan envisioned an intensification of regional economic partnerships. Beijing sought to enhance its access to Arctic economic resources by investing in a wide range of onshore mining, offshore oil exploration and extraction, and infrastructure development projects.\n\nThird, Beijing saw enhanced participation in regional governance initiatives as a key element of its Arctic strategy. It aspired both to play a larger role within existing institutions, like the Arctic Council and various Track II forums, and to create alternative Chinese governance mechanisms — including the “Polar Silk Road,” the China-Russia Arctic Forum and the China-Nordic Arctic Research Center — to complement, or even transcend, existing institutions.\n\nFourth, without sovereign jurisdiction in the region, Chinese leaders pursued cooperation with Russia in the economic and governance fields. Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin released a joint statement mere weeks before Russia attacked Ukraine proclaiming a “no limits” partnership that included “practical cooperation for the sustainable development of the Arctic” and the further opening of bilateral Arctic maritime commerce.\n\nFinally, China’s Arctic strategy potentially involves an expansion of its military footprint in the region. Chinese military texts treat the Arctic as a space of future military competition, noting that “the game of great powers” will “increasingly focus on the struggle over and control of global public spaces” like the Arctic. These texts further argue that China “cannot rule out the possibility of using force” in the inevitable “scramble for new strategic spaces.”\n\nBut recent events have sent those best laid schemes well and truly aglay.\n\nTo be sure, Beijing has enjoyed some measure of success. It became an observer on the Arctic Council; invested heavily in Russian Arctic infrastructure; and made its presence felt in the high north, especially in the field of scientific diplomacy.\n\nBut the harsh reality from Beijing’s perspective is that recent developments, much like Burns’s plow, have left considerable pain in place of once-promised joy. The fate of both China’s Polar Silk Road initiative and its “without limits” partnership with Russia tell perhaps the most important part of the tale.\n\nAlmost all of China’s ambitious plans have come to naught. Notable among these faltering or failed projects are Chinese investments in the Kuannersuit rare earths and uranium mine and the Isua iron-extraction projects in Greenland; the acquisition of TMAC Resources, a mineral exploration and development company in Canada; China’s proposed railway connection between northern Finland and Norway; liquified natural gas investment in Alaska; land acquisitions in Iceland and Norway; the purchase of a gold mine in Nunavut, Canada; a tunnel between Finland and Estonia; and its effort to establish an underwater communications conduit along the Northern Sea Route between Asia and Europe.\n\nChina was shut out in the Arctic when the Arctic Council was suspended\n\nAndrew Latham is a professor of international relations at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minn., a Senior Fellow at the Institute for Peace and Diplomacy, and a non-resident fellow at Defense Priorities in Washington, D.C, “How China’s Arctic plans went awry”, The Hill, August 23, 2023, https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4166188-how-chinas-arctic-plans-went-awry/\n\nAt the same time, the suspension of the Arctic Council since the onset of the Ukraine War has closed an important window into polar affairs for China. And this is just a snapshot of China’s misfires and setbacks associated with the Western members of the Arctic community.\n\nChina hoped to work with Russia but the Ukraine invasion interfered\n\nAndrew Latham is a professor of international relations at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minn., a Senior Fellow at the Institute for Peace and Diplomacy, and a non-resident fellow at Defense Priorities in Washington, D.C, “How China’s Arctic plans went awry”, The Hill, August 23, 2023, https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4166188-how-chinas-arctic-plans-went-awry/\n\nWhile one might have expected China to have had greater success with Russia, this aspect of China’s Arctic strategy has also mostly been a failure. Chinese apprehension about a too-close political and economic relationship with Moscow has been growing steadily since February 2022. Chinese firms have been tentative at best in their engagement with the Arctic liquefied natural gas project in Siberia, and no Chinese cargo vessels transited the Northern Sea Route in 2022, reflecting Beijing’s concerns about Western sanctions. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s “no limits” partner has become more of a hindrance to Beijing than a help.\n\nWhether in the economic, diplomatic or military realms, the combined effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, mounting resistance among Western powers that largely predates that invasion, and China’s own unforeseen economic woes have effectively sent Beijing’s grand Arctic schemes seriously awry.\n\nRussia projects power in the Arctic while diplomatic efforts are non-existent\n\nGunhild Hoogensen Gjorv, professor of Security and Geopolitics, The Arctic University of Norway, “Gigantic Russian flag unveiled in the Arctic Ocean”, The Barents Observer, August 22, 2023, https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/2023/08/gigantic-russian-flag-unveiled-arctic-ocean-its-sign-dominance-and-defiance-uit-professor\n\nA group of scientists from the Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute unveiled a 1,400 square metre white-blue-red Russian flag on the sea ice nearby the drifting polar station “Severny polyus-41”.\n\nA statement on the institute’s website states that the unveiling is part of a project called “All Elements” and was done to celebrate the State Flag Day in Russia on August 22. “The idea of the project is that the Russian state flag is being unveiled in the most extreme climates and in the most significant places of the planet: in the air, in the water, on a volcano and on soil….”, the statement continues. The flag is surrounded by two scientific icebreakers “Severny Polyus” and “Akademik Tryoshnikov”. Photo: Screenshot from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute video Drone footage posted on the institute’s website shows a group of around 20 people unveiling the flag on the floating Arctic sea ice at 83.31°N, 51.48°E, with two scientific icebreakers visible in the background: “Severny Polyus” and “Akademik Tryoshnikov”. “The polar researchers are separated from the mainland by 10 months of drifting in the most difficult climate ever, surrounded by ice and the coldest ocean in the world…. We want them to feel the support. That’s why the huge Russian tricolor flag has been unveiled”, Alexander Makarov, head of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute said. The dimensions of the flag are 48.1 m by 29.6 m, the Institute’s press release further states. “They are not just raising a flag. It’s a massive flag. It’s a sign of dominance. And I suspect it’s a sign of defiance”, The Arctic University of Norway (UiT) Professor on Security and Geopolitics Gunhild Hoogensen Gjørv told The Barents Observer. “The Arctic Council, including relations with Russia, are on pause. There are very few relations between Russia and the other seven Arctic states. The flag is a signal to indicate that they are still big boys on the block”. The professor is also concerned by the fact that Russian scientists are engaged in such political acts: “It says something about the scientific community in Russia – it’s whether a pressure they are put under to have to engage in such a symbolic act or whether the scientific community is very politically active as well. If you have a very highly politicized scientific community, that hinders the possibility for cooperation with Russia”, the professor said.\n\nChina, Russia are showing muscle in Arctic, US cannot compete\n\nRoger Wicker, U. S. Senator from Mississippi, member, Armed Services Committee, member, U. S. Helsinmki Commission and author of the “Securing the Homeland by Increasing our Power on the Seas (SHIPS) Act, “China, Russia on Track to Eclipse U. S. Naval Power”, Weekly Report, August 21, 2023, https://www.wicker.senate.gov/2023/8/wicker-china-russia-on-track-to-eclipse-u-s-naval-power\n\nThis month, eleven Chinese and Russian ships paraded closer than ever to the edge of U.S. waters. When our two foremost foes conjured this show of force near the coast of Alaska, they sent a clear signal. They mean to strengthen their power in the Pacific and Arctic oceans. In response, four U.S. destroyers and a P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft converged on the scene and followed the enemy ships. This was the strongest response we could muster. The Arctic is crucial to our security, but China and Russia are outpacing U.S. capabilities in the Pacific. Their growing power is one example of a broader trend: Our enemies are boosting their military might. To deter them from attacking the United States, we need to increase our strength. We will need to move quickly. Russia and China have turned the Arctic into a contested zone. The area is the front line of America’s ballistic missile defense system, and its waters are among the world’s most efficient shipping lanes. The United States also relies on intelligence gathered in and around Alaska. Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin would like very much to control such a strategic area. This most recent joint exercise by China and Russia is their boldest statement about their Arctic intentions, but the message is nothing new. Chinese citizens have been accused of posing as tourists and intruding onto military installations in Alaska. Nearly a year ago, seven powerful Chinese ships sailed near our waters in the region. As Russia faces resistance in Ukraine, it flexes in the High North. It patrols farther and more often and is doing so with China’s blessing. Xi hopes to influence the region via Putin’s existing strength. Unfortunately, Russia’ Arctic naval power far exceeds our own. They have 36 polar icebreakers – ships built to navigate ice blockades – while the U.S. has just two. This power imbalance could change our ability to protect our interests in the Pacific and Arctic oceans. It also reflects wider changes that demand we update our national security priorities. We have entered a new era of Great Power competition. During the last one, the sheer power of Ronald Reagan’s 600-ship Navy deterred the Soviet Union from attacking us. We have lived off the remains of his buildup for decades, retiring Reagan-era ships but not replacing them.\n\nRussian aggression means violence against women\n\nTRINE JONASSEN, 8-21, 23, High North News, Believes Norway’s Cautiousness Toward Russia to Be Outdated, https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/believes-norways-cautiousness-toward-russia-be-outdated\n\n“It is important to discuss base policy. Especially after (the war crimes, ed.note) in Bucha, when we have seen how Russia acts. Should we then be so scarcely defended in Finnmark? Perhaps we should have a NATO base in Finnmark or at least discuss the base policy?” asks Friis.\n\nUkraine is investigating almost 60 000 possible war crimes. It concerns everything from murder, kidnapping, random bombings to sexual assaults conducted by Russian soldiers.Friis believes that we must take a look at Russia with new eyes and remind them about what the base policy was really about.\n\nArctic oil spill risks increasing\n\nEthan Wong, 8-18, 23, The Arctic This Week Take Five: Week of 14 August, 2023, https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/arctic-week-take-five-week-14-august-2023/\n\nTake 2: Once again, unexpected ice has disrupted vessels sailing through the Northern Sea Route (NSR). Despite warming temperatures and melting sea ice, shipping through the passage remains dangerous, as conditions can change rapidly.. This was starkly demonstrated in 2021 when an early freeze along the NSR left more than 20 ships stuck in sea ice. However, receding sea ice may also come with its own challenges. A recent study found that as ice disappears due to climate change, the Arctic Ocean has been getting foggier, reducing visibility and raising the potential for disastrous accidents, like oil spills. Therefore, with or without ice, the difficult operating conditions can lead to costly delays, undermining the NSR’s main advantage of being shorter than alternative routes. These continued issues, along with harsh weather, logistical challenges, the lack of infrastructure, and environmental concerns, all raise questions about the reliability, safety, and long-term economic viability of the passage. With Russia identifying the NSR as a critical state priority and investing heavily in transforming the route into a competitive maritime corridor, low demand for the passage could have serious consequences. As the Arctic continues to change, the situation of the Primorsky Prospect and NS Arctic serves as yet another warning of the dangers of Arctic shipping, which may further deter interest in the NSR. (Harvard International Review, High North News, Polar Journal)\n\nPollutants in the Arctic don’t break-down\n\nEthan Wong, 8-18, 23, The Arctic This Week Take Five: Week of 14 August, 2023, https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/arctic-week-take-five-week-14-august-2023/\n\nTake 3: Despite its remoteness, pollution is a critical issue for the Arctic due to the long-range transport of pollutants from around the world, like persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and plastics. POPs, toxic chemicals which resist degradation, are especially dangerous to the Arctic ecosystem because they do not break down in the environment. As a result, POPs can persist for immense periods of time and travel vast distances through the wind, water, and food cycles to accumulate in the Arctic. These chemicals can have serious consequences for wildlife and human health, including adverse effects on reproduction, development, and the immune system. Despite these dangers, POPs are widely used in a variety of common products, from packaging to detergents. Similarly, large amounts of plastic debris have made their way to the Arctic, with the region recording some of the highest concentrations of microplastics globally. Scientists have observed plastic particles in numerous species, including seabirds, fish, and even algae, the foundation of the Arctic marine food chain. The Arctic also faces environmental threats from mercury, radioactivity, oil, acidification, and more. However, as the article highlights, AMAP’s research has successfully led to the development of vital regulations and agreements in the past. Drawing on this experience, countries should continue to support and utilize the organization’s scientific-based policy advice to combat the global sources of pollution threatening the Arctic.

The proposal builds on a recent declaration by the Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Danish air forces to establish a unified Nordic air defense. An Arctic air operations center could expand this joint initiative beyond the Nordic region, incorporating the air forces of other NATO members active in the Arctic to improve interoperability, training, and planning. These actions, aimed at enhancing NATO’s Arctic capabilities, also draw attention to the potential for a dedicated Arctic Command. Although there are no official plans to develop an Arctic Command, NATO has worked to bolster its presence in the region in recent years. In response to Russia’s increasing militarization and China’s expanding activity in the region, NATO has conducted several major Arctic exercises, including Cold Response 2022 and Arctic Challenge 2023. It has also identified the deepening partnership between Russia and China as a strategic challenge to the values and interests of the alliance.\n\nArctic is key to global great power competition\n\nBradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP, 8-15, 23, Melting Arctic to Open Up New Trade Routes and Geopolitical Flashpointsm, https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/melting-arctic-to-open-up-new-trade-2260059/\n\nThe Ukraine war has refashioned alliances, isolating Russia from the West and pushing Moscow and Beijing to closer cooperation. Citing national security, the U.S. and allies are securitizing trade policies with China, restricting access to key developing technologies and friend-shoring critical supply chains. In what some foreign policy experts are calling a new Cold War, geopolitical competition between western liberal democracies and the China-Russia authoritarian axis is super-charging a race to shape technology standards, economic rules of the road and political norms of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The Arctic Circle, once the isolated habitat of polar bears, rich marine life and small indigenous communities, is now being drawn into the realm of geopolitics, with melting polar ice caps promising to open its waters to navigation and tensions. New Trade Routes, New Economic Opportunity The Arctic region has been warming four times faster than the rest of the world over the past four decades, according to a 2022 study by Finnish and Norwegian scientists. Scientists are projecting that by 2035, parts of the Arctic will be free of ice during summer months, opening up prospects for commercial shipping to ply these waters and shorten transit time between the U.S., Europe and Asia. Some studies project that Arctic routes could be 30% to 50% shorter than the Suez Canal and Panama Canal routes, with transit time reduced by an estimated 14 to 20 days. Beyond commercial shipping, the new routes could attract cruise ships and adventure tourists. Access not only creates opportunities for the maritime sector, but the region is rich in fossil fuels, critical minerals and marine life. Commercial industries potentially will gain access to billions of dollars of untapped resources. Unlike Antarctica, a land mass, there is no treaty protecting the Arctic from international development. This makes control over the waterways and natural resources ripe for dispute and potential conflict. The race to build infrastructure to support and control navigation has already begun. Northern Sea Route, Northwest Passage and Future Trans-Arctic Shipping Route The Northern Sea Route (NSR) was first opened by the Soviet Union in the 1930s but has not been a reliable transit route due to ice coverage. Climate change is changing that. Russia claims that the NSR lies within its territorial waters, giving it exclusive rights to develop the area and patrol ships. The U.S. and other countries dispute this claim, saying it runs through international waters. Seeing the emerging opportunity, Russia has been refurbishing more than 50 Soviet bases, providing them with strategic ports and sending a political message that the NSR is under Russian sovereignty. Canada claims the Northwest Passage (NWP) is located in internal Canadian waters and subject to Canadian law and sovereignty. The U.S. and Europe disagree, arguing it also is an international strait and subject to freedom of navigation under the Law of the Sea. To date, there are very few ports along the NWP, with Churchill being the only deep-water port with shelter and berthing facilities. There are no deep-water ports along the North Slope of Alaska or throughout the Canadian Archipelago. But this is changing. The U.S. has plans to build its first deep-water Arctic port in Nome, Alaska, and Canada is planning a deep-water port in Qikiqtarjuaq, Nanuvut, which is located at the entrance to the NWP. The Trans-Arctic Route, which cuts straight across the North Pole, avoids the territorial waters of Arctic states and lies in international high seas. Currently, and probably until mid-century, it is only navigable by nuclear icebreakers. But the possibilities are being discussed today, foreseeing thousands of ships a year passing between North America and Asia, with a hub at Alaska’s Dutch Harbor. The ships would not have size restrictions, as the Central Arctic Ocean’s depth is not as limiting as the NSR and NWP. National Security a Top Line Concern The Biden administration released its National Strategy for the Arctic Region in October 2022. It has four pillars: national security, economic development, infrastructure development, and environment. National security is the first priority. In light of Russia’s full invasion of Ukraine, the strategy cites the requirement to protect the homeland and ensure that the Arctic region is peaceful, with guardrails to manage competition and resolve disputes without force or coercion. The strategy also draws attention to China’s efforts to increase its influence in the Arctic, doubling its investments with a focus on critical mineral extraction and using scientific engagements to conduct dual-use research in military or intelligence applications in the Arctic. These worries are not purely theoretical. The military balance in the Arctic is heavily weighted towards Russia. It has more bases than NATO and is upgrading air strips to improve operability. Russia’s icebreaker fleet vastly outnumbers NATO states, even with the addition of Finland. Despite the Ukraine War, Russia is continuing to invest, maintain and exercise its forces in its Northern Region, which is home to many Russian strategic military assets (ballistic missile submarines, strategic test sites, advance radar systems, etc.). The shortest distances for a Russian missile or bomber attack against the U.S. is over the polar cap. China also seeks to become a polar great power. Beijing has declared itself a “near-Arctic state,” claiming rights to freedom of navigation and overflight, scientific research, fishing, and resource development. China’s intelligence-gathering activities became front page news this year with the detection and eventual downing of a Chinese balloon first detected near St. Matthew Island in the Bering Sea. Moscow has historically pushed back against Beijing’s interest in the Arctic to protect its sensitive military assets. However, the war in Ukraine has changed the strategic landscape. In June, Russian and Chinese vessels conducted a joint exercise near Alaska’s Aleutian Islands. The U.S. Coast Guard warned the ships off when they entered U.S.-regulated waters. The U.S. military views this as a test of U.S. readiness. Since then, there have been other Russian-Chinese patrols in the area, and the U.S. has made a show of tracking them.\n\nRecord North Atlantic warming now, further warming could collapse ocean currents\n\nElias Thorson, 8-14, 23, https://www.arctictoday.com/unprecedented-temperatures-in-the-north-atlantic-ocean/, Arctic Today, Unprecedented Temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean,\n\nA recent study by the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), claims that ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic have entered uncharted waters, with July being the warmest on record. According to the C3S, the North Atlantic was 1.05°C above average in July with unusually high temperatures developed in the northwestern Atlantic, with marine heatwaves developing south of Greenland and in the Labrador Sea. Scientists worry that temperature increases could lead to a collapse in ocean currents. Photo: The Copernicus Climate Change Service “We just witnessed global air temperatures and global ocean surface temperatures set new all-time records in July. These records have dire consequences for both people and the planet exposed to ever more frequent and intense extreme events,” said Samantha Burgess, Deputy Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service. “Even if this is only temporary, it shows the urgency for ambitious efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main driver behind these records.” The unprecedented warming is creating serious concern in the scientific community. A study published earlier this month, by Danish scientists Peter and Susanne Ditlevsen estimated that a warming North Atlantic and Greenland ice melt could cause the collapse of the The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation around the middle of the 21st century.\n\nNo strong China-Russia alliance in the Arctic\n\nCameron Wood, 8-14, 23, , With Russia Weakened, China Sets its Sights on Vladivostok, https://intpolicydigest.org/with-russia-weakened-china-sets-its-sights-on-vladivostok/\n\nHowever, while it is easy to view these developments as evidence of a robust Sino-Russian relationship, China’s actions should be viewed contextually. Despite the platitudes and assurances of mutual support, China has been reluctant to give Russia access to advanced missiles, drone technology superior to Iran’s (Russia’s primary supplier of drones), or further expansions of natural gas and pipeline agreements. China’s influence in the Russian Far East also consistently evokes unfavourable sentiments in Russia. According to a survey conducted in 2017 by the Russian Academy of Sciences, over 30% of Russians perceive China’s growing presence as “expansionist.” Additionally, 50% of respondents expressed concerns about China posing a threat to Russia’s territorial integrity, while 30% of participants believed China’s policies could jeopardize their nation’s economic progress. These adverse local perceptions have occasionally led to delays in proposed Chinese investment ventures like the Chinese-funded water bottling facility in the Irkutsk region, scheduled for development, which was halted following local protests in 2019 Additionally, China is stepping up its security and economic footprint in Central Asia in ways that may increasingly be perceived through a competitive lens by Moscow. In 2021, it was announced that China would construct an outpost for police special forces in Tajikistan which is home to Russia’s largest overseas military base and is a member of the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (comparable to NATO for former Soviet states). Economically, China has also replaced Russia as the largest trading partner for Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, reducing Russia’s ability to wield its economic influence in the region. In May, China invited the presidents of these states to a grand foreign policy and diplomatic festival. The invitation specifically failed to include Russia and represented growing Chinese influence within former Soviet states which Russia considers within its sphere of influence. Such a blatant omission of Russian inclusion illuminates the relationship’s growing asymmetries and demonstrates the fragility of the broader friendship. Russia is also wary of China’s Arctic ambitions due to its own significant interests in the region. Around 20% of Russia’s land lies within the Arctic Circle, encompassing 24,000 km of coastline and 2.5 million people. Under Putin, Russia has revitalised its Arctic focus by increasing its military presence and renovating 50 Soviet-era military sites. China, though lacking Arctic territory, aims to be a “near-Arctic state” and in 2018 it proposed a “Polar Silk Road” aligned with its Belt and Road Initiative. Collaborations between China and Russia on Arctic energy and infrastructure projects have also faced challenges. Russia resisted China’s Arctic Council observer status and in 2020 charged a Russian Arctic expert with treason for sharing classified data with China. Considering this, what may seem on the surface to be cooperation between China and Russia in Vladivostok could be viewed more cynically. China has made no secret of wanting the far eastern region around Vladivostok back. Having only been in Russian hands since 1860, when the area was ceded by China to Russia as part of the Treaty of Peking, the region represents 20,000 square miles of previously Chinese territory, which China still calls by its original name ‘Haishenwai.’ The foundations for a realignment of the Russia-Chinese frontier are deep. China and Russia have both complained and occasionally come to blows, over their shared border for centuries. Prior to the Russian Revolution, ethnic Chinese residents constituted more than 40% of the labour force in the region. According to a 1907 census, around 62,000 Chinese residents lived in the far eastern region of Russia, highlighting their significant presence in the area. The actual number was probably higher as many Chinese did seasonal cross-border work as day laborers. At that time ethnic Russians were probably a minority, which helps explain why Stalin chose the inhumane but expedient policy of mass expulsions to China – to guarantee Russian numerical superiority within the region. Today, however, the demographics are shifting, with Russia degrading the region’s societal identity by resettling Ukrainians who have been forcibly removed from their homeland into the area. Additionally, Russia has been draining its eastern defences to replace men and material lost in Ukraine. This extensive border region has never been so lightly defended by either side and it won’t be long before the ethnic Russian population is once again outnumbered by ethnically Chinese Russians. Interstate ‘shared use agreements’ like the sort concerning Vladivostok, are difficult to revoke. If Russia wishes to limit or remove Chinese access to the port in the future, it may struggle to do so absent diplomatic consequences. Beijing certainly is aware of this and likely proposed the agreement with further entrenchment of its influence in the region as its long-term intention. With the official regional demarcation resolution, for a centuries-old border conflict that predates the official existence of both nations, only being signed by the two powers in 2008, it is not unforeseeable that China could move to nullify current agreements and seek that Russia return Vladivostok. Given the changing demographics, such a move could be framed as the simple absorption of ‘residents who speak and think like us,’ a logic that Putin has not been afraid to use in his justification for invading Ukraine. Such a territorial addition could further cement Xi Jinping’s position of strength at the head of the Chinese Communist Party and alleviate some of the pressure to capture Taiwan in the immediate future. In fact, the Chinese claims on Vladivostok and the surrounding area are more historically rooted than the CCP’s more recent claims over Taiwan. However, Vladimir Putin is an ‘expander of territory’ not a relinquisher. Any agreement for the wilful return of such a vital part of Russia’s eastern geopolitical structure is extremely unlikely. But Russia’s vast resources and lightly defended eastern border coupled with Russian military losses in Ukraine means Vladivostok should not be ignored as a potential flash point for future geopolitical tensions.\n\nWestern military posture in the Arctic is inadequate\n\nGray, 8-7, 2023, Alexander B. Gray is a senior fellow in national security affairs at the American Foreign Policy Council. He served as a deputy assistant to the president and as the chief of staff of the White House National Security Council from 2019 to 2021, NATO’s Northern Flank Has Too Many Weak Spots\n\nWhile Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has revealed significant weaknesses in Moscow’s military capacity, it has also shone an unflattering light on aspects of NATO’s strategic posture. It is incumbent upon the United States and its NATO allies to take proactive measures to plug these gaps before they are exploited by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime. Finland’s recent NATO accession and the expected accession of Sweden have boosted the alliance’s capacity in critical competencies, including undersea warfare, signals intelligence, and artillery in the Baltic Sea region. Yet troubling deficiencies remain along NATO’s northern flank, particularly in the Arctic and near-Arctic, that reveal substantial failings by several key alliance members to uphold their obligations in the face of Moscow’s unflagging interest in the High North. Russia has successfully exploited several factors to gain maneuver space in the region. There are multiple Arctic and near-Arctic islands with power-sharing relationships that leave control of national defense to a larger entity—as in the case of Svalbard (Norway), the Faroe Islands (Denmark), and Greenland (Denmark)—while permitting local governments a high degree of autonomy. In each case, Moscow has expanded its influence with far too little resistance by Oslo or Copenhagen. The Faroe Islands, whose defense is Denmark’s responsibility, have remained host to numerous Russian fishing vessels throughout the Ukraine conflict, under a treaty between Russia and the Faroe Islands from the 1970s. Similar Russian vessels have been credibly accused of espionage and even sabotage, including of undersea cables in the North Sea. Copenhagen’s inability to intervene effectively in the matter has left its NATO partners across the alliance’s northern flank vulnerable to asymmetric Russian tactics. Recent Faroese efforts to restrict Russian fishing vessels in the islands’ waters have maintained considerable loopholes permitting Russians to retain access. While the Foreign Policy Act of 2005 permits the Faroese considerable autonomy in foreign affairs-related to issues solely within the jurisdiction of their government, a matter of this sensitivity should involve additional input from Copenhagen and coordination with larger Danish foreign-policy priorities. Greenland has long been a zone of contention between Denmark and both Moscow and Beijing, which prize its potential natural resource wealth and strategic location astride the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom Gap, the strategically critical body of water separating the North Atlantic Ocean from the North Sea and Norwegian Sea. As Greenland’s local autonomy has grown, so has its receptivity to outside influence. Copenhagen’s decreasing authority has provided ample opportunity for great-power competition on the world’s largest island. While Greenland’s progress toward increased autonomy seems all but inevitable, Copenhagen has an opportunity to set the parameters of the foreign-policy relationship for the coming decades by insisting on greater coordination in areas directly impacting its NATO obligations and defense prerogatives. As the relationship between Greenland and Denmark evolves, Copenhagen must draw clear lines in the international realm where its vital interests, and those of its NATO allies, are clearly at stake. The alliance’s northern flank also suffers from the strategic neglect by Canada under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, which is currently spending roughly 1.3 percent of GDP on defense—significantly below NATO’s 2 percent requirement. Ottawa’s aging icebreaker fleet has long been scheduled for replacement, but the government has repeatedly failed to deliver or even specify a date for such replacement. Despite repeated warnings from within the military that Canada lacks the capabilities to contest Moscow’s remilitarization of the Arctic, Ottawa has engaged in fanciful discussions of an Indo-Pacific strategy that leaves the United States and NATO vulnerable in the Western Hemisphere. These challenges require serious solutions across the alliance, beginning with an integrated NATO arctic strategy that builds upon the work done by individual members (such as in the United States’ recent Arctic Strategy) to generate a shared appreciation for the challenge of defending the High North and allocating sufficient resources to do so effectively. This would likely include a unified NATO Arctic Command to appropriately funnel resources across warfare domains; coordinate joint Arctic warfare training; and take appropriate advantage of the capabilities brought to the alliance by the accession of Helsinki and soon Stockholm, including icebreaking and Arctic warfare skills. Additionally, the United States must work with its partners in Copenhagen, Oslo, and Ottawa to encourage a more forward-leaning posture in the High North. Russia cannot be allowed to operate with near impunity in the Faroe Islands or threaten NATO’s strategic communications through its influence in Greenland or Svalbard. China, with its Polar Silk Road initiative, is deeply interested in growing its presence in the region and has preposterously declared itself a “Near Arctic State.” The United States should work both multilaterally through NATO and bilaterally with the Danes, Norwegians, and Canadians to provide the intelligence support necessary to prevent ambiguous legal statuses from threatening the alliance’s northern flank. Many on both sides of the Atlantic are rightly celebrating NATO’s success in rallying to resist Moscow’s aggression in Ukraine, as well as in the accession of Sweden and Finland. Yet there remains much work to be done in securing the alliance’s northern flank and providing the security umbrella envisioned by the North Atlantic Treaty. With NATO’s 75th anniversary approaching next year, now is an opportune moment to reorganize to meet today’s threats.\n\nUS trying to work with Russia through the Arctic Council\n\nPatsy Widakuswara, 8-4, 23, VOA, US Wants Russia Iced Out Everywhere, Except the Arctic, US Wants Russia Iced Out Everywhere, Except the Arctic (voanews.com), https://www.voanews.com/a/us-wants-russia-iced-out-everywhere-except-the-arctic-/7212157.html\n\nThe Biden administration, which has sought to isolate Moscow diplomatically on the world stage, is supporting efforts to re-establish technical cooperation with Russia in one of the world’s most challenging geographical regions – the Arctic. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States has successfully lobbied to boot Moscow out of various international forums, including the U.N. human rights body and international aviation agency. Last year, President Joe Biden went so far as to call for Russia to be kicked out of the Group of 20 major economies, or G20, a proposal that fizzled due to a lack of support. But the polar region is the one place where Washington is not icing Russia out completely. Specifically in the Arctic Council, a forum for the eight Arctic states, including the U.S. and Russia, to address common challenges such as climate change, shipping routes and indigenous people’s rights. “The administration believes the Arctic Council should continue to serve as the premier forum for cooperation among Arctic states, including on sustainability, protecting the environment, addressing the impacts of climate change, scientific research, and on other issues of importance to member countries,” said a senior administration official, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity to discuss security issues. With no end in sight for the war in Ukraine, the administration is now working with other members of the council — Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden — to re-establish some of the ties to Moscow that were fully suspended shortly after Russia’s invasion. As programs ground to a halt last year, Russia remained chair of the council until it handed the baton to Norway in May 2023. Morten Høglund, the council’s chair of the Senior Arctic Officials, said they are aiming to begin work on a technical level. “The Norwegian Chairship of the Arctic Council is in the process of consulting with all Arctic States and Indigenous Permanent Participants to develop guidelines for the resumption of Working Group-level work with all Arctic States, including the Russian Federation,” Høglund told VOA. Russia’s acceptance Russia has indicated it wants to remain in the council. During a press conference following the chairship handover, Nikolay Korchunov, Russia’s Arctic official, said Moscow wants “comprehensive security in the region” and is “absolutely not interested in escalating the tension in the Arctic.” “It can all be sorted out by dialogue, which would strengthen the trust,” Korchunov said. Trust is a tall order for the consensus-based council. With Finland joining NATO in April and Sweden soon to follow, Russian security interests are diametrically opposed to those of the transatlantic allies who now call themselves the Arctic Seven. Amid increasing challenges, though, such as rapidly melting icecaps, loss of biodiversity, and increased needs for disaster response, there’s little choice but to seek room to collaborate. The task is now to find the gaps in the current diplomatic freeze and identify areas where scientific cooperation and other forms of non-governmental dialogue are possible, and to prepare for a post-conflict period, said Pavel Devyatkin, a senior associate at the Arctic Institute. “Practical cooperation can build trust, especially between rivals,” he told VOA. “Though government-level science may be restricted, cooperation at the individual-level is still manageable but has many obstacles such as visa restrictions and closed consulates.” Rationale for cooperation The main rationale is Russia’s sheer size. With a land area of about 17 million square kilometers, it makes up 45% of the geographical Arctic, and its coastline accounts for 53% of the Arctic Ocean coastline. With climate change causing the ice to recede, international shipping is making increasing use of the Northern Sea Route, or NSR, which follows Russia’s coast from the Barents Sea to the Bering Strait. Ships sailing through the NSR need Moscow’s permission and an escort from Russia’s icebreaker fleet, the largest in the world. However, the “most serious loss would be the loss of Russian data,” said Patrick James, professor of International Relations at the University of Southern California. Without Moscow’s participation, he told VOA, climatological research will suffer. This includes research for the council’s Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program that has proven instrumental for global policy. AMAP studies showing the buildup of toxic chemicals in the blood of polar species critical to Indigenous People’s diets helped shape the 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.\n\nChina-Russia Arctic ties are strong\n\nPatsy Widakuswara, 8-4, 23, VOA, US Wants Russia Iced Out Everywhere, Except the Arctic, US Wants Russia Iced Out Everywhere, Except the Arctic (voanews.com), https://www.voanews.com/a/us-wants-russia-iced-out-everywhere-except-the-arctic-/7212157.html\n\nContinued Western sanctions have pushed Moscow to increasingly depend on Beijing as a source of financing for energy projects, such as the Yamal LNG Terminal, and infrastructure plans to develop the Arctic region. “Developing the Northern Sea Route was always a Russian goal,” said Stephanie Pezard, senior political scientist focusing on Arctic Security at RAND Corporation. “And right now, they don’t have any partners to do that, except China.” For Beijing, investing in Russian sea ports will help with access to the Northern Sea Route, she told VOA. China has no Arctic coastline but calls itself a “Near-Arctic Power.” The degree of Russian-Chinese strategic polar partnership is ambiguous, however, said the Arctic Institute’s Devyatkin. “Despite the hype around the Polar Silk Road, there has been no shipping from the Chinese Overseas Shipping Company, or COSCO, along the Northern Sea Route since February 2022,” he said. “It is also unlikely that Russia would allow a permanent Chinese military presence in the Arctic to rival its own defensive complex in the region.” From Beijing’s point of view there is a limit to how much alignment it should seek with Moscow as it tries to promote itself as a responsible stakeholder deserving a voice in Arctic affairs, said Matthew Funaiole, a China Power Project senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nChina-US rivalry in the Arctic not inevitable now\n\nPatsy Widakuswara, 8-4, 23, VOA, US Wants Russia Iced Out Everywhere, Except the Arctic, US Wants Russia Iced Out Everywhere, Except the Arctic (voanews.com), https://www.voanews.com/a/us-wants-russia-iced-out-everywhere-except-the-arctic-/7212157.html\n\nAnd while the polar region is emerging as a space with plenty of structural tensions, Funaiole said it’s too early to conclude it has become another front for U.S.-China rivalry, the primary theater for which remains in the Indo Pacific. “The Arctic is not going to supplant that anytime in the near future,” he told VOA.\n\n136-Russia is using the Northern Sea Route (NSR) to ship to China, which is the only way it can sell oil given the current sanctions\n\nHigh North News, 8-3, 23, https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/russian-crude-oil-now-flowing-china-arctic-ocean#:~:text=With%20the%20onset%20of%20the,Arctic%20during%202023%20and%20beyond.\n\nWith the onset of the summer navigation season on the Northern Sea Route (NSR), Russia has begun sending crude oil shipments to China via the Arctic. After an initial trial voyage in November 2022, energy analysts expect Russia to send regular shipments through the Arctic during 2023 and beyond. With Europe completely out of the picture as a result of sanctions, Russia now diverts parts of its Arctic production to China. Additional shipments are destined for India. Two initial shipments departed from the Primorsk and Ust-Luga oil terminals near St Petersburg on 12 July and 13 July, passing through the Baltic Sea and up the Norwegian coast lines. The two Aframax oil tankers, NS Arctic and Primorsky Prospect, each carrying around 730,000 barrels of crude oil, traveled along the NSR throughout the second half of July and are expected to arrive in Rizhao, China in mid-August. Compared to the traditional route through the Suez Canal, the Arctic shortcut is around 30 percent faster. In November 2022 the Aframax tanker Vasily Dinkov traveled from near Murmansk also to Rizhao in around four weeks. The NSR will be key to diverting the flow of crude oil away from Europe and toward Asia. With the massive Vostok oil project slated to open next year, the amount of crude oil being shipped via the Arctic will increase rapidly. Until recently the NSR had seen less than a handful of oil shipments to Asia over the past decade. The pivot to the East in terms of the flow of exports of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) was always planned by the Russian government, says Matt Sagers who specializes in Russian energy at S&P Global, a research and analysis company. “This process is now being pushed harder with the loss of the European market for Russian oil and the re-orientation of oil exports to “East of Suez”. Use of the Northern [Sea] Route reduced the number of days at sea and therefore the number of tankers (and overall capacity) that is required to move oil eastward. Entire upstream developments, like Vostok Oil, are intended to be evacuated via the route,” explains Sagers. x “According to our records, Russian state-owned tanker company – Sovcomflot (SCF) alone owned over 35 ice class tankers above 70,000 dwt. There is more tonnage in operation, with varied ownership,” says Svetlana Lobaciova, Senior Market Analyst at E.A. Gibson, an international shipbroker.\n\n135-Slow response times means problems with Arctic oil spills linger, crushing local ecosystems\n\nHigh North Times, 8-3, 23, https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/russian-crude-oil-now-flowing-china-arctic-ocean, Russian Crude Oil Now Flowing To China Via Arctic Ocean\n\nIn terms of cleaning up oil spills in ice-covered waters, burning the oil in place has been identified as the most effective and often only option, with serious environmental impacts. Environmental organizations also warn against further fossil fuel exploration in the region. “New fossil fuel production projects in the Arctic pose additional risks to Arctic ecosystems, species and communities that have been already impacted by rising temperatures,” explains Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance, a coalition of 20 non-profit organizations working to protect the Arctic. The region’s remoteness and lack of infrastructure will also increase the response time, prolonging the time the oil remains in the water. “Remote and harsh Arctic conditions means long spill response clean-up times, with accidents ruining local ecosystems for decades,” cautions Prior.\n\n134-China’s oil imports from Russia make its economic recovery possible\n\nHigh North Times, 8-3, 23, https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/russian-crude-oil-now-flowing-china-arctic-ocean, Russian Crude Oil Now Flowing To China Via Arctic Ocean\n\nMeanwhile, China stands to benefit from Russia’s pivot to the East as it continues to expand its energy imports, primarily LNG and crude from the Arctic. In 2022, Russia surpassed Saudi Arabia as China’s largest supplier of oil. In total, China spent $58bn on oil imports from Russia in 2022, a figure that is likely to grow larger this year. In addition, it purchased $8bn of LNG from Russia, primarily from Novatek’s Yamal LNG plant in the Arctic. Last year Russia sent around 35 percent of its oil exports to China, up from 31 percent in 2021. On average, China pays $7 less per barrel for Russian crude oil than it pays for products from other countries. Analysts say that Chinese refineries have been able to use the western ban on Russian crude oil to their advantage in price negotiations with Russian sellers. “As Moscow is no longer able to sell its fossil fuels in Europe, Asia has become a vital partner for Russian energy trade, with China at the head of the line,” explains Marc Lanteigne professor and researcher in politics, security and international relations at the University of Tromsø. “Beijing has also successfully been able to negotiate bargain prices for these shipments, helpful at a time when China is still recovering from its post-Covid economic disruptions,” he continues. While Chinese support of Russia’s energy ambitions has limits – in May President Xi Jinping did not publicly endorse the development of the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline – it appears committed to take receipt of fossil fuels delivered via the NSR. “It is highly likely that Beijing will continue to take advantage of a window of opportunity to import more oil and gas from Russia as European markets remain closed,” concludes Lanteigne.\n\n133-China become a polar power and deploying monitoring devices at the top of the Arctic\n\nRitu Sharma -July 30, 2023, Eurasian Times, China To Deploy ‘Listening Devices’ In The Arctic Ocean To Exert Dominance, Track US, Rival Submarines, https://www.eurasiantimes.com/china-to-deploy-listening-devices-in-the-arctic-ocean-to/\n\nChina has unequivocally stated its intentions to become a “polar great power” by 2030. Despite being 900 miles away from the Arctic circle, Beijing has never shied away from asserting itself as a “near Arctic state,” and now it is gearing towards deploying a network of listening devices in the Arctic Ocean that would very well herald the militarization of the top of the world. The Arctic could see its first ice-free summer by 2030 if current projections hold. And this has made countries interested in the region increase the pace of their commercial, scientific, and military endeavors. A Hong Kong-based news organization South China Morning Post carried out the news about China seeking to deploy acoustic devices in the Arctic after successfully testing and evaluating its underwater listening device The report quotes a study published in the Chinese Journal of Polar Research that says: “The acoustic information collected by the planned large-scale listening network could be used in a wide range of applications, including “subglacial communication, navigation and positioning, target detection and the reconstruction of marine environmental parameters.” “They are for scientific purposes, but all such things have a dual purpose,” an Indian expert of the Arctic region told the EurAsian Times. However, observers of the Arctic region feel that acoustics devices play an important role in understanding climate change in the Arctic as the oceanographic data from the Arctic Ocean, especially from the deep ocean, are scarce. But the data can also be used to track the movement of submarines and understand the marine ecosystem to chart new routes – both under and over the surface. The Polar Research Institute of China is conducting the research: “The system carried several instruments, but the most important was a vector hydrophone with multiple sensors arranged in different orientations to measure both the pressure and particle motion of sound waves.” The world above 66 degrees latitude has remained intractable for most human existence, impeding large-scale commerce. Explorers, speculators, and scientists long believed a trove of rich resources and shipping routes lay hidden beneath the Arctic’s ice and snow. But deadly cold, debilitating darkness and enormous distances have hampered any exploitation of the resources. However, the unknown depths of the Arctic are soon being charted, making their navigation a possibility sooner than later The institute asserts that since the region is sensitive to climate change, sound pressure data can be used to track whales, seals, and other sound-emitting sources. The horizontal and vertical vibration of water particles can help scientists understand marine conditions such as currents, waves, and the sea floor. The Shanghai-based institute is a central government agency that plans and coordinates China’s polar activities. Chinese scientists and engineers installed the “polar subglacial shallow surface acoustic monitoring buoy system” on a chunk of floating ice in a remote area of the Arctic Ocean on August 9, 2021. During the test, the institute used an American communication satellite service. China’s polar listening network would likely shift to Chinese BeiDou satellites for communication. Militarization Of The Top Of The World Countries across the globe are scrambling to cement their foothold in the polar region as global warming is rapidly melting polar ice caps, drastically transforming the environment. Mutual distrust is pushing major world powers to enhance their civil and military engagements in the Arctic. “It is a complex situation. Militarization has increased, but it is by both sides, the West and Russia.” A 10-year Arctic strategy released by the White House in 2022 calls for deterring increased Russian and Chinese activity in the region. Russia makes no bones about its stake in the region. Since 2013, Russia has refurbished and activated hundreds of Soviet-era bases in the region. The US National Strategy for the Arctic Region notes that Moscow is “deploying new coastal and air defense missile systems and upgraded submarines, and increasing military exercises and training operations with a new combatant command equivalent for the Arctic.” The Russian military adventurism in Ukraine has also strained the cooperation between countries and Russia in the region. Russia is far ahead in its goals to make the Arctic navigational. Presently it has 51 icebreakers as compared to the US’ five functioning ones. China has also expressed an interest in building a ‘Polar Silk Road’ in the region. It has doubled its investments in the region ostensibly to focus on critical mineral extraction and expand its scientific activities. But the strategic value of being able to traverse the region year around is not lost on either China or Russia. The latest Chinese plan to do undersea acoustic modeling can also be used for naval navigation, oceanography, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), submarine stealth and navigation, anti-submarine warfare, targeting, and weapons delivery. The data from the devices is directly transmitted to the command center in China via satellites. This can bring more tension to the region, which is fast becoming a contested place for global power plays owing to its strategic location, natural resources, and the potential for new shipping routes. The US maintains more than 22,000 active-duty troops in Alaska and also has a base in Greenland. China has invented the designation “near Arctic country” to seek a greater role in Arctic governance. With no direct access to the Arctic and the West apprehensive of its presence in the region, China has been pushed closer to Russia to ensure it has a seat at the table when the Arctic policy is decided. In December 2022, a US Coast Guard cutter spotted the ships during a routine patrol of the Bering Sea, north of Alaska: a guided missile cruiser and two smaller ships from China, traveling in formation with four ships from Russia. The cutter followed until they split up and dispersed. The ships broke no rules and violated no boundaries. But their appearance so close to the Arctic this past fall raised concern in Washington nonetheless.\n\n132-The Russia Council is suspended\n\nRitu Sharma -July 30, 2023, Eurasian Times, China To Deploy ‘Listening Devices’ In The Arctic Ocean To Exert Dominance, Track US, Rival Submarines, https://www.eurasiantimes.com/china-to-deploy-listening-devices-in-the-arctic-ocean-to/\n\nThe Arctic Council, a governing body of Arctic States and indigenous nations, suspended its meetings last year, refusing to engage with Russia after it attacked Ukraine. A panel of experts that RAND convened for its study noted that Russia could seek to form its own Arctic governing council, with a more central role for its ally, China.\n\n131-Protection of Arctic routes critical to reinforce Europe in a conflict\n\nMilitary Times, 7-29, 23, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myYF-bPfjvs\n\nAll the units operating here in the Arctic region. They need to be very, very robust to cope with this harsh environment. It just prevents any aid from the outside you need to bring everything yourself. The Arctic Region is the gateway to the North Atlantic for NATO and its allies maintaining a strong presence here is vital to protect trade, transport, and communication links between North America and Europe. Historically, this has been an area of low tension but that is changing. Climate change is causing the world’s ice caps to melt at an alarming rate. As this ancient landscape forever changes, what does the future hold for security at the region known as the High North? What’s that? I’ll be joining the Danish Armed Forces in Greenland at sea and in the air to find out the challenges of patrolling this vast area. The geo gap, Greenland, Iceland and UK is hugely important for NATO. It’s what ties the transatlantic bonds together. That’s the way we would get the reinforcement from North America in a conflict scenario in Europe. [Host] No one knows how to operate in the freezing waters off the coast of Greenland, better than the Royal Danish Navy who have been patrolling here for centuries. We’ll be boarding the HDMS Triton one of four Danish ocean frigates patrolling Greenland at any given time under the Joint Arctic Command. Safely onto the ship, I went up to the bridge to meet the commanding officer. Commander Senior Grade Peter Krogh is a veteran of these waters and a former commander of one of NATO’s Naval task forces. Can you give us some idea of just a vastness of this area? It’s extreme distances, so you need to think ahead about the ship’s performance, about the crew skills and about logistics. We start to feel and growing interests from other navies that also wish to explore the northern region. And of course, we want to keep the sovereignty and protect the interests of Denmark and also our allies up here. Therefore, we are very pleased to share our knowledge with others and especially allied navies. I mean, it’s the sea level that’s changing, and it’s the amount of ice that is changing. Let’s take an example here in the Bay of Disko where we are now. People on the shore side, they used to visit the island Disko, and they could go there, buy food, but they haven’t been able to do that for a very long time because the temperature is increasing. So it is very, very easy to see the changes of the climate. As the ice melts, it creates the opportunity for new shipping routes and with it potential risks and threats to Euro-Atlantic security. The availability of new Arctic routes while presenting potential commercial opportunities could also lead to competition between nations and jeopardize the security of the entire region. With Russia stating its intention to be a primary force in the Arctic region and China declaring itself as a near Arctic power, Arctic security has become a priority for the NATO alliance and its allies. Our area of responsibility will be more used by the whole world, trade, the ships, by research, by tourism, so there will be more people in our area and that, of course, gives us a challenge both in the surveillance part but also in the search and rescue part. We need to be capable to handle that so there will be challenges. [Host] The truth is that nobody knows exactly what will happen in the coming years and decades with regards to rising sea levels and the effects they could have on security in the High North, but what we do know is that Greenland’s ice caps are diminishing, and sea levels are rising year on year. In an age when global security is both unpredictable and volatile, it is vital NATO maintains a strong allied presence in a strategically important region.\n\n130-Arctic key to protect Russian nuclear deterrence\n\nBekkeveld & Hilde, 7-28, 23, Jo Inge Bekkevold is a senior China fellow at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies and a former Norwegian diplomat, Foreign Policy, https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/07/28/arctic-nato-russia-china-finland-sweden-norway-northern-europe-defense-security-geopolitics-energy/ Paal Sigurd Hilde is a professor at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies. Twitter: @Paal_S_H\n\nSecond, Putin’s war in Ukraine has likely raised the importance of the European high north and the Arctic region in Moscow’s military strategy. For the foreseeable future, the decimation of Russia’s conventional forces in Ukraine makes Moscow even more reliant on its nuclear deterrence. The largest share of the sea leg of Russia’s strategic nuclear triad is made up of the submarines operating in the Arctic Ocean from their bases on the Kola Peninsula.\n\nMoreover, with Finland and Sweden in NATO, the Baltic Sea has turned into a virtual NATO lake, constraining the operations of Russia’s Baltic Fleet while Putin’s war in Ukraine increases the vulnerability of its Black Sea Fleet. These new vulnerabilities suggest that Moscow will find its Kola Peninsula-based Northern Fleet increasingly important—particularly its bastion defense concept for protecting Russia’s second-strike nuclear capability in the Arctic region.\n\n129-Russia already encircled by Finland’s militarization\n\nBekkeveld & Hilde, 7-28, 23, Jo Inge Bekkevold is a senior China fellow at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies and a former Norwegian diplomat, Foreign Policy, https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/07/28/arctic-nato-russia-china-finland-sweden-norway-northern-europe-defense-security-geopolitics-energy/ Paal Sigurd Hilde is a professor at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies. Twitter: @Paal_S_H\n\nThird, Europe’s northern flank is witnessing an increase in military activity. Russia stated that it expects a militarization of the region following Finland’s and Sweden’s NATO accession. Like Norway, Finland borders Russia’s Kola Peninsula, the strategic significance of which makes Russia sensitive to allied activity nearby. Unlike Norway, which has long put limits on NATO activity near its border with Russia, Finland might show less constraint. It has, for instance, opened its skies for U.S. intelligence flights along its eastern frontier, and the first sortie took place in March 2023. Furthermore, forces from NATO countries are increasingly visible conducting military exercises in Europe’s northern waters. For instance, in June, the U.S. Navy’s newest supercarrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, participated with its air wing in Arctic Challenge, a major exercise across northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland.\n\n128-Ukraine war makes Russia dependent on China and gives China influence in the Arctic\n\nBekkeveld & Hilde, 7-28, 23, Jo Inge Bekkevold is a senior China fellow at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies and a former Norwegian diplomat, Foreign Policy, https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/07/28/arctic-nato-russia-china-finland-sweden-norway-northern-europe-defense-security-geopolitics-energy/ Paal Sigurd Hilde is a professor at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies.

June 2023 Arctic sea ice comparison doesn’t disprove global warming, https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/07/18/arctic-sea-ice-declining-despite-june-comparision-fact-check/70385012007/\n\nA June 17 tweet (direct link, archive link) shows Arctic sea ice extent images from June 16, 2006, and June 16, 2023. The sea ice appears to cover roughly the same area in both images from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. “Not the narrative: June 2023 Arctic sea ice extent about the same as June 2006, despite ~800 billion tons of emissions representing a 41% increase in industrial era CO2,” reads the caption. “Emissions-driven warming is a hoax.” The tweet was shared to Facebook more than 100 times in less than a month, according to Crowdtangle, a social media analytics tool. It was also retweeted more than 6,000 times. Follow us on Facebook!Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks Our rating: False While Arctic sea ice extent − the area covered by a certain amount of floating ice − was similar in June 2006 and 2023, Arctic sea ice is decreasing overall due to global warming. Multiple lines of evidence show that human CO2 emissions are causing global warming. Arctic sea ice decreasing overall despite variability Arctic sea ice is declining overall due to climate change, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. About half of the sea ice cover at the “minimum extent” − the time of year after the summer melt has concluded − has been lost, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. “We have over 43 years of data now, and the signal of decreasing sea ice is very clear,” Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at National Snow and Ice Data Center, previously told USA TODAY. Fact check: Humans are responsible for a significant amount of CO2 in the atmosphere However, seasonal weather and short-term climate variations also influence the size of extent, he told USA TODAY in an email. This means that even though sea ice is declining overall, it is still possible for a more recent year or month to roughly match the extent of past months or years. This is the case for June 2006 and June 2023, which had similar extent sizes throughout the month, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center Charctic Interactive Sea Ice Graph. However, the extents in both June 2006 and June 2003 were both lower than June extents between 1979-2004 as well as some more recent years. Overall, June Arctic sea ice extent has decreased by 3.8% per decade since the late 1970s, according to National Snow and Ice Data Center. Other parts of the year, such as the September minimum extent, have sustained much greater losses. Global warming caused by human greenhouse gas emissions More than a trillion metric tons of CO2 have been released by fossil fuel burning and land use changes since 1850, according to the 2022 Global Carbon Budget. Multiple lines of evidence show this CO2 has warmed the planet, Josh Willis, a NASA climate scientist, previously told USA TODAY. For one, CO2 is a known greenhouse gas, which warms the lower atmosphere by slowing the escape of heat into space. “The amount of warming we see matches what we expect based on the increased CO2 we’ve added,” he said. “The timing of the warming matches the timing of the CO2 increase caused by people.” Additionally, the type of carbon found in fossil fuels can be detected in atmospheric CO2, which confirms the gas was introduced by human behavior. Fact check: Arctic sea ice declining overall, though level varies by year and season The post’s figures for CO2 emissions since 2006 are in the ballpark, but may be somewhat overstated. Carbon Brief reports that humans released around 660 billion metric tons of CO2 between 2006-2022 through fossil fuel burning and land use changes. However, the Carbon Brief data (which is from the Global Carbon Project) also subtracts some emissions that were absorbed by the concrete manufacturing process. The social media user who posted the claim did not immediately respond to questions about the source of the CO2 emissions estimate in the post or which types of emissions are included in the estimate.\n\n125-Russian military advantage in the Arctic; US behind on icebreakers\n\nJ.J. Brannock, 7-18, 23, https://www.thecentersquare.com/national/article_08ba124a-2580-11ee-a528-7f90ab71117d.html The Center Square, Security concerns grow as the U.S. continues to be outmatched in arctic territory\n\n(The Center Square) – The Committee of Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security held a hearing on Tuesday concerning security threats in the Arctic Region. The U.S. is one of eight countries with territory above the arctic circle. Russia also has territory in the area. Historically, both Japan in World War II and the Soviet Union during the Cold War sought U.S. arctic territory for strategic purposes. The U.S. has cited the arctic region as a potential entry point for Russian nuclear missiles and therefore crucial to protect. “For the past decade the Russian military has been building up its capabilities in the arctic, including its fleet of heavy icebreakers,” Chair Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., said at the hearing. Gimenez cited Putin’s continued push for using the Northern Sea Route as an alternative to the Suez Canal to allow faster trade between Europe and Asia. He also mentioned Putin’s progressive noncompliance with other arctic states after the invasion of Ukraine. “The arctic has never been more essential to America’s national security,” said Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich. “Unfortunately, the Coast Guard’s icebreaking capabilities are outmatched by our enemies, and rising threats from China and Russia pose a serious risk to American prosperity and security.” The U.S. currently has only 2 polar ice breaker ships in their fleet. The Russian government has roughly 36 in their arsenal, with an extra 15 being owned by private entities.\n\n124-US needs more icebreakers to compete with Russia\n\nJ.J. Brannock, 7-18, 23, https://www.thecentersquare.com/national/article_08ba124a-2580-11ee-a528-7f90ab71117d.html The Center Square, Security concerns grow as the U.S. continues to be outmatched in arctic territory\n\nChina has also expressed interest in the arctic area in recent years, writing out a 5,500-word arctic strategy in 2018, including entering the territory “for the common interests for all countries, law-based governance, climate change, and sustainable developments.” The Chinese have 2 polar ice breakers despite not owning any territory above the arctic circle. Gimenez said that one of the reasons for China’s interest in the arctic may be for fishing purposes. “They are raping the oceans,” Gimenez said about China’s overfishing activities. “My concern would be that they are trying to do the same in the arctic region.” Thanedar requested Congress to approve “robust funding” for new polar ice cutters and other budget increases for the Coast Guard to help maintain national security in the arctic. One of two large ships funded for the Coast Guard has been delayed repeatedly, from an expected 2024 delivery to a now estimated 2028 at the earliest before being fully operational. Witnesses on the hearing said that the U.S. would need about eight more ships compared to their current two to compete with China and Russia’s growing influence in the area.\n\n123-Russia-US tensions high in the Norway Arctic region\n\nEmily Rauhala, July 17, 2023, Washington Post, An Arctic ‘Great Game’ as NATO allies and Russia face off in far north, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/17/an-arctic-great-game-nato-allies-russia-face-off-far-north/\n\nFor several years now, European and U.S. security and intelligence officials have been keeping a closer eye on the world above the Arctic Circle, knowing that melting polar ice will open new trade routes, propel a race for natural resources and reshape global security. Western officials watched as Russia revived Soviet-era military sites and while China planned a “Polar Silk Road.” Vardo, Norway, is home to the U.S.-funded Globus I, II and III radars. But the war in Ukraine and the dramatic deterioration of Western relations with Moscow have put the frostbitten borderlands between Norway and Russia on heightened alert, while increasing the geostrategic importance of the Arctic. The result is an uptick in military, diplomatic and intelligence interest that could usher in an iteration of the “Great Game,” the 19th-century rivalry between the British and Russian empires for influence in Asia. For Russia, because the war in Ukraine has diminished Moscow’s conventional military forces and hobbled the Russian economy, its Arctic assets have become more critical. “The Arctic has become more important because the nukes are more important,” said Maj. Gen. Lars Sivert Lervik, the chief of the Norwegian army.\n\n122-Arctic Council not working now\n\nEmily Rauhala, July 17, 2023, Washington Post, An Arctic ‘Great Game’ as NATO allies and Russia face off in far north, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/17/an-arctic-great-game-nato-allies-russia-face-off-far-north/\n\nThe Arctic Council — an intergovernmental forum that promotes cooperation — is in disarray because seven of its members refuse to work at a political level with its eighth member, Russia, disrupting collaboration on critical issues such as climate change. In the past year, Norwegian media outlets have reported about drones buzzing airports and oil and gas installations, the expulsion of Russian diplomats as spies, and the case of a man accused of illegal intelligence gathering while posing as a Brazilian guest researcher at a Norwegian university. For NATO allies, “a flashing yellow light turned red, and we need to think more carefully,” said a senior U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss alliance thinking. “Countries need to be sharing more information on destabilizing actions, on things that look strange, and we need to be less naive and more aware.”.\n\n121-Russia could block resupply ships\n\nEmily Rauhala, July 17, 2023, Washington Post, An Arctic ‘Great Game’ as NATO allies and Russia face off in far north, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/17/an-arctic-great-game-nato-allies-russia-face-off-far-north/\n\nWestern officials worry, too, that Russia could block commercial shipping lanes or U.S. Navy ships en route to Europe, particularly at a potential maritime chokepoint called the “Greenland, Iceland, U.K. gap” that separates the Norwegian and North seas from the open Atlantic Ocean. “Russia’s ability to disrupt reinforcement is a real challenge to the alliance,” said one senior Western intelligence official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss security matters. There is also concern that Moscow has mapped critical undersea infrastructure and could engage in sabotage against Europe. Last month, NATO launched a center for protecting undersea pipelines and cables.\n\n120-Collaboration in the Arctic needed to avoid great power war; increasing military presence undermines that\n\nBatool, 7-14, 23, Ms Fizza Batool is a student of International Relations from Kinnaird College for Women. She is particularly interested in geo-economics, geopolitics, area studies, diplomacy, conflict and peace, strategic and defense studies, political economy, and global politics of the environment, Significance of the Arctic Region, https://www.paradigmshift.com.pk/the-arctic-region/\n\nThe phenomenon of the Arctic presents a chance for realism theory analysis. Realism is a wide notion that encompasses everything from classical realism as described by Hans J. Morgenthau (1948) to neorealism as developed by Kenneth N. Waltz (1979). It is believed that the global order is wholly and permanently chaotic. Neo-realists often assert that these influences do not change the vital role that conflict performs in global politics, even though conventions, laws and structures, opinions, and other variables are accepted to influence the conduct of states. Since climate change has presented the Arctic nations and other players with new opportunities and problems, the region has become a focal point of great power conflict. A neo-realist narrative can, hence, help in explaining the dynamics of this rivalry. Neo-realism holds that in an international system that lacks a central authority to enforce laws or norms, nations want to maximize their relative strength and security. State interests in accessing and using the region’s natural resources, supporting their maritime borders, and extending their military presence and influence will be pursued in the Arctic as a result. In the case of the US-China power confrontation in the Arctic, neorealism implies the fact that conflict is an undeniable phenomenon, whereby the developed strategies can supply a dimension to the persistence of conflict which is merely an economic one. Resource wars are an example of the implication of conflict in the region. Neorealism, however, also acknowledges that states may work together under specific circumstances. This implies that to resolve their issues and advance regional stability, governments in the Arctic will also take part in multilateral organizations like the Arctic Council and abide by international law like the UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea). To understand the intricate and dynamic nature of great power conflict in the Arctic, a neo-realist story can be a helpful tool. Thucydides Trap: An Idea American political scientist Graham T. Allison coined the phrase “Thucydides trap” to characterize the propensity for conflict when a growing power poses a danger to replace an established great power as a regional or global hegemon. The phrase is based on a statement made by the ancient Greek historian Thucydides, who said that Sparta’s dread of Athens’ development made the Peloponnesian War between the two cities unavoidable. Allison contends that this pattern has appeared several times throughout history, with war breaking out in 12 of the 16 instances of great power conflict. A possible flashpoint for such a confrontation is the Arctic region because of its abundance of natural resources, strategic locations, and environmental significance. Exploration, exploitation, and navigation in the area now face new potential and problems due to the melting of the polar ice caps brought on by climate change. The eight Arctic Council nations – Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States – are the key players in the region. Moreover, other nations have also expressed interest in the region, including China, India, Japan"
