        "text": "The Stroygazkonsulting in 2014 won the contract on the construction of a 28 km long railway line on the western side of the Kola Bay. The contract was worth 41.5 billion rubles (â‚¬670 million) and included also the building of a bridge across the great Tuloma river. The deal was won in competition with Story-Trest, a company controlled by powerful businessman Gennady Timchenko.\n\nStroygazkonsulting and its owner Ziyad Manasir has made big money over several years thanks to close and successful cooperation with Gazprom. Now, however, new gas contracts have come to an end and the company is in crisis. According to newspaper Vedomosti, Stroygazkonsulting is fighting for survival and negotiations over a takeover by Gazprombank is in the process.\n\nA collaps of Stroygazkonsulting will most likely affect also company projects, among them the Murmansk Transport Hub. The project, which is heavily funded by the federal budget, will provide access to new land for industrial activities on the western shore of the Kola Bay and new terminal facilites for coal and oil are under planning."
