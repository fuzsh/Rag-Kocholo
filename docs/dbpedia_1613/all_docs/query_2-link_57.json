        "text": "A large oil spill was detected in the Pervomaysky district of Murmansk city – the capital of the Russian Arctic. The spill has appeared in the very inner part of the Kola fjord – along the Tuloma River that flows into the Barents Sea, Russian environmental watchdog Rosprirodnadzor reported on July 15 in Vkontakte.\n\n“Water samples have been taken, – the watchdog reported, – Significant excesses of the maximum permissible concentration for the pollutant “petroleum” have been established. The spill is spreading downstream towards the Barents Sea. Along the entire route of the pollution, saturated spots of oil products are observed on the shoreline of the Kola Bay.”\n\nAuthorities have so far tested water in two locations – around the Kolsky bridge in the Pervomaysky district of Murmansk and around the bridge in the town of Kola in the Murmansk suburbs. The watchdog experts suggest the initial source of both spills is the same and is located further upstream.\n\n“The area of ​​the polluted water was 591 square meters, – the watchdog reported in VKontakte, – The maximum permissible concentration for the pollutant “petroleum products” was found to be 400 times higher.”\n\nDespite the fact that the spill was discovered on 1 July, the authorities are still trying to find those responsible for it and are calling on the public to help:\n\n“We are asking eyewitnesses who have any information about the perpetrators to provide assistance and available supporting materials.”\n\nLocated in Kirkenes, Norway, just a few kilometres from the borders to Russia and Finland, the Barents Observer is dedicated to cross-border journalism in Scandinavia, Russia and the wider Arctic."
