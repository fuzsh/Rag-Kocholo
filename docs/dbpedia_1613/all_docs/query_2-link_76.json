        "text": "Parts of the article content might not be accessible, for example, with a screen reader.\n\nA satellite image taken from Kola Bay near the Finnish border has captured an intriguing moment: Russia is readying a nuclear submarine.\n\nOn a missile loading dock, a bridge crane stretches over the sub, but no missiles can be seen in the image.\n\nA submarine can hide in the world’s oceans for three months at a time, while carrying as many as 96 nuclear warheads. It is the most formidable weapon in Russia’s nuclear deterrent arsenal.\n\nHidden in the secluded city of Gadzhiyevo in the Murmansk Oblast, it is concealed from prying eyes, but not from satellite cameras.\n\nWith the help of satellite imagery, this story will provide a peek into Russia’s nuclear weapons bases and an understanding of the role they play in nuclear deterrence.\n\nRussia’s war of aggression in Ukraine has lasted a year, during which time its nuclear threats have become regrettably commonplace.\n\nMost recently in January, ex-president and Russian security council deputy chairman, Dmitry Medvedev, warned the West of nuclear conflict, if Russia were to lose the war in Ukraine.\n\nYle therefore decided to examine what kind of nuclear deterrence lies behind Medvedev’s sabre rattling.\n\nRussia’s nuclear missiles are best concealed in submarines\n\nOne satellite image acquired by Yle shows six submarines moored at a pier.\n\nThe nuclear arsenal of even a single submarine would be enough to cause substantial destruction. Moreover, submarine-launched nuclear weapons are the most difficult to combat.\n\nLoading missiles on a submarine is not necessarily a sign of preparing to use nuclear armaments. Rather it is a routine, if rarely seen, activity.\n\n\"It’s a really good photo. One ship probably won’t spend many days a year at the missile dock,\" says Russia expert Marko Eklund.\n\nEklund has examined the details of the satellite images for this Yle story. He has studied the Russian armed forces for over 20 years and was Finland’s deputy defence attaché in Moscow from 2018 to 2021.\n\nNuclear warheads are not typically stored in submarines standing at docks, but in a nearby weapons depot. The next satellite image will take you there.\n\nThese spanking new facilities play a pivotal role in Russia's arsenal. According to Eklund, the overhaul began in 2014 as part of the development of Russia’s Northern Fleet.\n\nHeavy duty bombers already used in the war in Ukraine\n\nRussian nuclear deterrence is based on three approaches: Strategic nuclear weapons on the ground, sea and in the air – or in practice stored near air bases. These three nuclear deployment methods are known as a triad.\n\nThe heaviest bombers account for between 60 and 70 of Russia’s combat aircraft. Their main operating base in Europe is in Engels, near the Southern Russian city of Saratov.\n\nThe satellite image of Engels base has been closely cropped, so that the area outside the actual field appears black.\n\nMoscow has used Engels in its war against Ukraine. Because of this, Ukraine is believed to have targeted the field twice in December 2022.\n\nSo far, bombers have been used to launch missiles with conventional warheads, but they can also be equipped with nuclear warheads.\n\nA construction site in the satellite image shows Russia’s nuclear armament\n\nRussia has many land-based strategic nuclear missiles spread across dozens of military bases throughout the country.\n\nThe missiles can be launched from silos or vehicles called Transporter Erector Launchers (TELs).\n\nThe closest place to Finland where TELs are deployed is in Vypolzovo, which has been used in this example.\n\nThe location itself is insignificant, because the missiles at Vypolzovo are not meant to be used against Finland or any other country bordering Russia.\n\nLaunched from any location, the missiles would very quickly reach any nuclear-armed nation, if for some reason, Russia were to follow through on its worst threats.\n\nThe Vypolzovo base covers a vast area, so to minimise costs, the satellite image has been closely cropped. Areas of interest outside the core of the base show as black in the image.\n\nStrategic nuclear weapons are also still deployed in silos although they are an easy target while standing still. For this reason, the silos have been spread out over distances of 5–10 kilometres.\n\nThe example selected for this story is located south of the town of Kozelsk, which lies southwest of Moscow.\n\nThe base in Kozelsk is interesting, because on its outskirts it is possible to see how Russia is constantly developing its nuclear deterrence.\n\nA new command centre is being constructed at another missile regiment site near Kozelsk and new nuclear missiles are being deployed there.\n\nIn the pair of images that follows, the picture on the left shows a missile regiment command centre abandoned in 2019. The area has since been completely bulldozed and new structures erected.\n\nThe same regiment also includes nine other old silos, where construction work has not yet begun.\n\nEklund detected a large construction site near one silo.\n\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has upgraded almost its entire nuclear arsenal and has slightly more nuclear weapons than the United States.\n\nResearchers estimate that Russia now has nearly 6,000 nuclear warheads, of which roughly 1,600 are operational.\n\nAlthough nuclear missiles are scattered at bases across Russia, missile launch commands always come from the capital, Moscow. The headquarters of the Strategic Missile Forces are located in the closed city of Vlasikha, in western Moscow.\n\nOutsiders have no business here.\n\n\"After us – silence\" - that’s the motto of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces.\n\nRussia can undoubtedly cause mass destruction with its nuclear weapons in the United States and Europe, as well as much of the rest of the world. It would herald a Third World War.\n\nMost recently, shortly before Christmas 2022, Putin declared that Russia was improving the operational readiness of its nuclear weapons triad.\n\nPutin has also insinuated that Russia might change its nuclear arms doctrine to allow it to use strategic nuclear weapons first.\n\nResearchers have extensively discussed the possibility that Moscow might resort to using nuclear weapons. However, it’s important to note that so far at least, the Kremlin has not changed its principles of nuclear weapons use, opting instead to use them for intimidation and blackmail.\n\nIf at some point, Russia were to ready tactical nuclear weapons for large-scale use, it would likely be visible via satellite imagery, as they would have to be transported from storage to military bases.\n\nHowever there have been no signs of such activity during Russia’s siege in Ukraine.\n\nRussia is also hardly likely to suddenly use strategic nuclear weapons, although some are in a state of immediate operational readiness for revenge strikes. In such a gamble, there would be no winners.\n\nOriginal article in Finnish: Maailmanlopun aseet"
