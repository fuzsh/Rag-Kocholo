        "text": "The Ultimate Way to Explore Arctic scenery in summer Is by Bike !\n\nGiving a chance , will you prefer hiking or biking?\n\nMeet Jack[1], an architect living in Oslo who loves adventures in nature but isn't particularly patient. He wants to be able to travel at his own pace and take in all the beautiful sights, which is why he has made bicycles his preferred mode of travel. With a bike, he can move at his own speed and take breaks whenever he wants, without missing out on any of the stunning scenery. Whether he's exploring the roads and trails of Norway or venturing further afield, Jack knows that a bicycle is the perfect tool for his nature-filled adventures.\n\nIn Norway, everyone has the right to roam freely, thanks to a principle called \"Allemannsretten,\" which means \"everyone's right.\" As long as you respect nature, you can explore any open land and camp wherever you'd like. With this belief in mind, Jack and his friends planned a three-week cycling trip to the polar circle, hoping to leave their youthful courage at the end of the world. It's a journey that combines the freedom of the open road with the majesty of the natural world.\n\nThey rode all the way from Lofoten to Tromsø. This route takes you along the northernmost road in the world, on the westernmost part of the European continent. It's a place that feels like a fairyland and a legend, with breathtaking fjords and towering mountains formed by tectonic movement. Roadways, bridges, and subsea tunnels connect the islands, making it possible to fully appreciate the stunning scenery along the way.\n\nThe Arctic Circle is an area located above 66 degrees latitude. Within Norway, the territory within the polar circle is about 96,225 km2, which is about 2.5 times larger than Taiwan. However, the population in this region is only about 500,000 people.\n\nOne interesting phenomenon in the Arctic Circle is the eternal daylight during the summer months, also known as the midnight sun. This is a great advantage for those who enjoy traveling by bicycle, as you can ride for longer periods of time without the need for artificial light. If you're planning a cycling trip to the Arctic Circle, be sure to experience this unique aspect of the region.\n\nyou'll be glad to know that the mosquitoes there are both giant and slow-moving. They often have trouble finding a good vein to bite, which means you'll have fewer interruptions while cycling. Plus, with the blessing of the midnight sun, you can easily complete a 60-kilometer bike ride each day.\n\nWhen you're feeling tired, you can always stop to camp along the coast. Catch some cod for dinner, jump into the Arctic sea for a refreshing bath, and build a bonfire to dry your clothes. As you lay on the beach, looking out at the spectacular Atlantic Ocean, you can chat with your friends about which fjord was the most beautiful treasure of the day. The North Pole is truly a magical place for a cycling adventure.\n\nNorthern Norway is known for its rich terrain and diverse landforms. The roads often take you through cliffs and along the sea, with significant altitude changes over short distances. One moment you might be high up on a mountain, overlooking an entire village, and the next moment you could be at sea level, greeting a dancing whale. The cycling experience in this region can be physically demanding, but the breathtaking views make it all worth it. Despite any muscle pains, you'll be left with a heart full of wonder and amazement.\n\nThe Arctic Race of Norway[2] is a professional cycling event held every August in the highest latitudes. It's a four-day race, divided into four stages, with a total length of about 800 kilometers. As a part of the UCI European Tour, the race attracts top-level racers from around the world.\n\nThe stunning scenery along the route makes the Arctic Race of Norway a highly anticipated challenge for professional cyclists. This year, the race is celebrating its 10th anniversary, and the route will extend from the Sami town of Kautokeino to the North Cape, the northernmost point of the European road. If you're a fan of cycling, you won't want to miss this exciting event.\n\nThe annual cycling race in Northern Norway has become the most important sporting event in the region, attracting over 50,000 spectators each year. The event has a significant economic impact, bringing in more than 50 million Norwegian kroner. It's a great example of cooperation between society and the government, and it has a far-reaching impact on local businesses and tourism.\n\nIn addition, the event has brought the community together and inspired many spectators to start cycling more frequently. Summer is the best time of year to cycle inside the polar circle, thanks to the midnight sun and cool temperatures. If you're looking for a unique way to experience the beautiful polar circle scenery, cycling might be the perfect activity for you. Even if you're not particularly athletic, you can still enjoy the sights and sounds of the region at a leisurely pace.\n\nPhoto Credit：王湘鄉 Hsiang Hsiang Wang\n\nPhoto Credit：Jack Hughes\n\n[1] Jack Hughes , Iresh man , work as an architect in Oslo Norway"
