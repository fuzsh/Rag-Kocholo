Taken together these works describe the situation in Poland around 1794. Overall the trilogy paints a positive picture of the disparate classes uniting to force through a revolution. The third volume focuses on the actions of the uprising itself.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784351814/?tag=2022091-20\n\nFermenty (Polish Edition)\n\n(Fermenty continues the story of one of Reymont's most fam...)\n\nFermenty continues the story of one of Reymont's most famous characters  Janka Orlowska, the protaganist of Komendiantka. The book takes place mostly in Bukowiec, the village where her father works as a station chief on the Warsaw-Vienna line.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784351784/?tag=2022091-20\n\nZiemia obiecana (Polish Edition)\n\n(Set in Lodz, Ziemia obiecana tells the story of three clo...)\n\nSet in Lodz, Ziemia obiecana tells the story of three close friends and ruthless young industrialists: a Pole, a German, and a Jew struggling to build their own factory in the heartless world of the late 19th century labour exploitation. Reymont's novel vividly paints a portrait of the rapid industrialization of Lodz and its cruel effects on workers and mill owners. \"For that land people were born. And it sucked everything in, crushed it in its powerful jaws, and chewed people and objects, the sky and the earth, in return giving useless millions to a handful of people, and hunger and hardship to the whole throng,\" he wrote.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784350885/?tag=2022091-20\n\nThe Comedienne\n\n( The Comédienne draws on Nobel Prize winner, Wladyslav R...)\n\nThe Comédienne draws on Nobel Prize winner, Wladyslav Reymont's, own experiences as an actor in a struggling provincial theatre at the fin de siecle, at time of massive social upheaval in Europe. Reymont depicts, in a slow burning tragedy, a young provincial Janina, the comédienne of the title, who joins a Warsaw theatre company and struggles toward what was then a very modern notion of personal freedom. A 'Comédienne' also played drama and tragedy and the word in Polish had some connotation of a deceiver. As such, the title in Reymont's day would have implied a somewhat darker novel that we might unwittingly expect today. This edition has been completely re-edited and includes over 500 amendments, corrections and new translations to the orignal text. The introduction by Marianna Rychlowska includes; • Biographical details of the author • Historical context of the book • Literary notes • Historical review of early theatre in Poland • Theatre reportage by Henryk Sienkiewicz These unique insights provide the contemporary reader with much of the commonly understood historical context that was assumed of the original audience.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0987153242/?tag=2022091-20\n\nOstatni Sejm Rzeczypospolitej: Rok 1794 (Polish Edition)\n\n(Ostatni Sejm Rzeczypospolitej is the first volume of a tr...)\n\nOstatni Sejm Rzeczypospolitej is the first volume of a trilogy of works by W?adys?aw Reymont. Taken together these works describe the situation in Poland around 1794. Overall the trilogy paints a positive picture of the disparate classes uniting to force through a revolution. The first volume focuses on the politicking which resulted in the ratification of the Second Partition of Poland.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784351792/?tag=2022091-20\n\nThe Comedienne (Dodo Press)\n\n(Wladyslaw Stanislaw Reymont (1868-1925) was a Polish auth...)\n\nWladyslaw Stanislaw Reymont (1868-1925) was a Polish author, and Nobel laureate. His best known work is the novel Chlopi. In 1894 he began to send his short stories to different magazines, and, encouraged by good reviews, decided to write novels: Komediantka (The Deceiver) (1895) and Fermenty (Ferments) (1896). No longer poor, he would soon satisfy his passion for travel, visiting Berlin, London, Paris and Italy. Then, he spent a few months in Lódz collecting material for a new novel ordered by the Kurier Codzienny (The Daily Courier) from Warsaw. The earnings from this book-Ziemia Obiecana (The Promised Land) (1897)-enabled him to go on his next trip to France where he socialized with other exiled Poles. In 1924 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature over rivals Thomas Mann, Maxim Gorky and Thomas Hardy. Reymont's literary output includes about 30 extensive volumes of prose. There are works of reportage: Pielgrzymka do Jasnej Góry (Pilgrimage to Jasna Góra) (1894), Z ziemi chelmskiej (From the Chelm Lands) (1910), Z konstytucyjnych Dni (From the Days of the Constitution) (1905) and others.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1409960412/?tag=2022091-20\n\nKomediantka (Polish Edition)\n\n(Komediantka is a novel by W?adys?aw Reymont published in ...)\n\nKomediantka is a novel by W?adys?aw Reymont published in 1896. The novels centres on 22 year-old Janka who is facing a key decision: whether to accept a marriage proposal from a man she respects but does not love. Her horizons are broadened by the arrival of a band of travelling theatrical group and he discovers a passion for acting. Her father then forces her to chose between acting and marriage.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784351725/?tag=2022091-20"
