        "text": "Description\n\nOne of Poland s most engrossing twentieth-century epics, by the 1924 winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature In the village of Lipce, scandal, romance and drama crackle in every hearth. Boryna, a widower and the village s wealthiest farmer, has taken the young and beautiful Jagusia as his bride - but she only has eyes for his impetuous son Antek. Over the course of four seasons - Autumn to Summer - the tangled skein of their story unravels, watched eagerly by the other peasants: the gossip Jagustynka, pious Roch, hot-blooded Mateusz, gentle Witek ... Richly lyrical and thrillingly realist, at turns comic, tragic and reflective, Wladyslaw Reymont s magnum opus is a love song to a lasting dream of rural Poland, and to the eternal, timeless matters of the heart.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nWladyslaw Stanislaw Reymont (7 May 1867 - 5 December 1925) was a Polish novelist and the 1924 laureate of the Nobel Prize in Literature. He is best known for his four-volume epic The Peasants (Chlopi), which was original published between 1904 and 1909. Anna Zaranko is a Polish-English translator based in the UK. She has translated Kornel Filipowicz s The Memoir of an Anti-Hero, for which she received the Found in Translation award in 2020."
