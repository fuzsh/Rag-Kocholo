        "text": "AKA Stanislaw Wladyslaw Rejment\n\nBorn: 7-May-1867\n\nBirthplace: Kobielo Wielkie, Russia\n\nDied: 5-Dec-1925\n\nLocation of death: Warsaw, Poland\n\nCause of death: Heart Failure\n\nRemains: Buried, Powazki Cemetery, Warsaw, Poland\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Author\n\nNationality: Poland\n\nExecutive summary: The Peasants\n\nWladyslaw Reymont was a sickly child who loved reading. He was one of nine children in an oppressive, dogmatically Catholic family, and his formal education ended after third grade, when he failed the required test for entrance to secondary school. He trained as a tailor but never finished his apprenticeship, and instead joined a travelling troupe of actors. He worked as a store clerk, telegraph operator, railroad gatekeeper, farm hand, and served as a spiritualist's assistant until he realized that the customers were being duped. He lived for several years in almost complete solitude, occasionally selling stories but just as often contemplating suicide. For obscure reasons, he very slightly modified his surname, possibly because the family name was phonetically similar to a Polish-language insult.\n\nHis early novels Komedjantka (The Comedienne) and its sequel Fermenty (Ferments) earned him enough money to visit the major cities of western Europe, but in 1902 Reymont was severely injured in a train accident. He never fully recovered, but he married his nurse, continued writing popular novels, and the financial settlement with the railroad company left him a relatively wealthy man. He spent two years writing Chlopi (The Peasants), then grew disgusted with it, burned the manuscript and started over. When Chlopi was finally completed -- in four volumes, telling ten months of rural Polish life in vivid peasants' dialect -- it became his best-known work. His starkly cynical novel of urban hell, Ziemia Obiecana (The Promised Land), was filmed by Andrzej Wajda in 1975, and nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nReymont received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1924, but received it by mail, as he was bedridden with heart problems and unable to attend any ceremonies. In his note to the Nobel Committee, Reymont wrote, \"I still have many things to say and desire greatly to make them public, but will death let me?\" He died the following year.\n\nFather: Józef Rejment (church organist)\n\nWife: Aurelia Szacnajder Szabłowska (nurse, m. 1902)\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nPielgrzymka do Jasnej Góry (Pilgrimage to the Mountain of Light) (1895, travelogue)\n\nKomedjantka (The Comedienne) (1896)\n\nFermenty (Ferments) (1897)\n\nZiemia Obiecana (The Promised Land) (1899)\n\nLili (1901)\n\nZ Konstytucyjnych Dni (From the Days of the Constitution) (1905)\n\nChlopi (1909, four volumes)\n\nZ Ziemi Chełmskiej (From the Chełm Lands) (1910, non-fiction)\n\nThe Dreamer (1910)\n\nWampir (The Vampire) (1911)\n\nRok 1794 (The Year 1794) (1918, three volumes)\n\nZa frontem (Beyond the Front) (1919, non-fiction)\n\nBunt (Defiance) (1924)\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
