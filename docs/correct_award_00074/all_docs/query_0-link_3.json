        "text": "Władysław Stanisław Reymont (born May 7, 1867, Kobiele Wielkie, Poland, Russian Empire [now in Poland]—died December 5, 1925, Warsaw, Poland) was a Polish writer and novelist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1924.\n\nReymont never completed his schooling but was at various times in his youth a shop apprentice, a lay brother in a monastery, a railway official, and an actor. His early writing includes Ziemia obiecana (1899; The Promised Land; filmed 1974), a story set in the rapidly expanding industrial town of Łódz and depicting the lives and psychology of the owners of the textile mills there. His two early novels Komediantka (1896; The Comedienne) and Fermenty (1897; “The Ferments”) were based on his own theatrical experience, while his short stories from peasant life show the strong influence of Naturalism. The novel Chłopi, 4 vol. (1904–09; The Peasants; filmed 1973), is a chronicle of peasant life during the four seasons of a year. Written almost entirely in peasant dialect, it has been translated into many languages and won for Reymont the Nobel Prize.\n\nReymont’s later work was less expressive but reflected the variety of his interests, including his view of the spiritualist movement in Wampir (1911; “Vampire”) and his image of Poland at the beginning of the partition process at the end of the 18th century, Rok 1794, 3 vol. (1913–18; “The Year 1794”)."
