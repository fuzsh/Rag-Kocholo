        "text": "September 23, 2022\n\nMany years ago I set myself the goal of reading something by each Nobel Literature laureate. I often diasagreed with the selection committee and eventually gave up that plan, but I did enjoy a dozen or so selections. One writer that I missed in that go-round was Wladyslaw Reymont, the 1924 winner. I'm glad that a GR friend recently suggested I give one of his novels a shot. The Peasants is a tetralogy with the name of a season appended to the general title. I only read The Peasants: Autumn which introduces a dysfunctional family and a local society about to be thrust into the chaos of the border between Russia and Germany.\n\nI read that Reymont undertook this project because he wasn't satisfied with Emile Zola's study of peasant life reflected in the Rougon-Macquart novel, Earth. That intrigued me as an admirer of some of Zola's other novels. I also read that some critics feel The Peasants needs a new translation into English: the most recent dates from 1924. I distinctly noted some pronounced similarity to Zola's style, but Reymont's prose is much more poetic when describing his characters' environment, especially the weather.\n\nI don't know Polish so I'm not competent to evaluate the translation's quality, but it didn't cause me any problems. In fact, the translation issue may be insuperable. Some Polish critics note that Reymont used a regional dialect for narration as well as dialogue. Frankly, I'm afraid I'd find that a little disconcerting, and I'm glad my translator played it straight.\n\nI also found the level of antisemitism disconcerting. A Jewish tavern-keeper is an agent of evil in the plot. But he is only one of several such agents, so I can accept that. It wasn't so easy to accept frequent use of the term, \"Jew\", in a pejorative sense. The novel's setting was destined to be the center of the Holocaust only 15 years later, so the antisemitism was a fact of life in that time and place.\n\nGenerally, I enjoyed the novel very much, and highly recommend it to readers who appreciate writers such as Zola, Thomas Hardy, and Theodore Dreiser. If you're interested, it's long out of print, but the first volume, The Peasants: Autumn, is available without charge at Internet Archive.\n\nJuly 16, 2012\n\nI see on goodreads that not many people have read this book. I picked it up after looking at the list of Nobel Laureates for Literature and this author was commended for Chlopi, or Peasants, which this book is the first of. Seeing strong reviews, I went to my library and took it out. I am very happy to have taken it out since it is, even in translation, very beautiful in both setting and symbolism, tying together humans and the seasons. I strongly recommend anyone who wants a great read in realism. I look forward with great intent to the rest of the books in this series as it has given me high expectations."
