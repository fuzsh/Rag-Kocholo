We would like to talk about the relationships of individual Nobel Prize winners with Warsaw.\n\nWarsaw’s Nobel Prize Winners:\n\nMaria Skłodowska-Curie, who is most connected with the capital of Poland. She was born and raised in Warsaw. Maria won two Nobel Prizes and became the first Professor in the history of the University of Sorbonne. She founded a unique family in which her husband Pierre Curie, her daughter Irene Joliot-Curie, her husband Frederic Joliot-Curie and son-in-law Henri Labouisse also received Nobel prizes in various fields.\n\nWładysław Reymont – actually Stanisław Władysław Rejment. In Warsaw he gained a profession and became a tailor. But thanks to his poetry he received the Nobel Prize for Literature – for the peasant novel “Chłopi”.\n\nHenryk Sienkiewicz – Henryk Adam Aleksander Pius Sienkiewicz, received his education in Warsaw and worked as an editor in Warsaw newspapers. As a result, he was awarded the Nobel Literary Award for lifetime achievement\n\nMenachem Begin – related to the University of Warsaw. He received the Nobel Peace Prize for political activity for peace in the Middle East.\n\nJózef Rotblat – another Nobel laureate associated with Warsaw. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 for organizing an international scholars’ movement for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction called Pegwash.\n\nLech Wałęsa – Co-founder of the Solidarity movement and President of Poland, he also received the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nLeonid Hurwicz – professor at many American universities, distinguished himself in economics. He lived in Warsaw and studied here at the University of Warsaw. In October 2007, Hurwicz shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Eric Maskin and Roger Myerson. They received the awards “for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory”. His theory today plays a major role in many areas economics and political science.\n\nCzesław Miłosz – also associated with Warsaw and the University of Warsaw.
