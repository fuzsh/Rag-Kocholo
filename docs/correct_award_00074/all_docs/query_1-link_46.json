        "text": "Remont won the Nobel prize for his epic novel The Peasants, but here are the opening paragraphs of his novel The Comédienne, published in 1920: Bukowiec, a station on the Dombrowa railroad, lies in a beautiful spot. A winding line was cut among the beech and pine covered hills, and at the most level point, between a mighty hill towering above the woods with its bald and rocky summit, and a long narrow valley, glistening with pools and marshes, was placed the station. This two-story building of rough brick containing the quarters of the station-master and his assistant, a small wooden house at the side for the telegrapher and the minor employees, another similar one near the last switches for the watchman, three switch-houses at various points, and a freight-house were the only signs of human habitation.\n\nSurrounding the station on all sides were the murmuring woods, while above, a strip of blue sky, slashed with gray clouds, extended like a wide-spreading roof.\n\nThe sun was veering toward the south and glowing ever brighter and warmer; the reddish slopes of the rocky hill, with its ragged summit gashed by spring freshets, were bathed in a flood of golden sunlight.\n\nThe calm of a spring afternoon diffused itself over all. The trees stood motionless without a murmur in their boughs. The sharp emerald leaves of the beeches drooped drowsily, as though lulled to sleep by the light, the warmth, and the silence. The twitter of birds sounded at rare intervals from the thickets, and only the cry of the water-fowls on the marshes and the somnolent hum of insects filled the air. Above the blue line of rails stretching in an endless chain of curves and zigzags, the warm air glowed with shifting hues of violet light.\n\n………………………..\n\nby Wladyslaw Stanislaw Reymont,\n\ntranslated by Edmund Obecny\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nSientkiewicz won the Nobel Prize for his novel Quo Vadis (which means “Where are you going?”). The epic is a story about power overcome by faith, about faith, which brought love, about love which changed Rome. It is a tale of early Christian persecution at the hands of the Roman Emperor, Nero. Sienkiewicz wrote his Trilogy for the purpose of “uplifting the hearts” of his countrymen at a time when Poland did not exist as an independent country.\n\nThe novel was made into a movie. Here is the opening paragraph from the book: It was close to noon before Petronius came awake, feeling as drained and listless and detached as always. He was a guest at one of Nero’s banquets the evening before and the orgy dragged on late into the night, and his health hadn’t been all that good anyway for some time. He told himself that waking in the morning was a kind of mental and physical paralysis where neither his mind nor his body was capable of action. but an hour or two spent at his private baths, followed by a thorough kneading of his flesh by skilled slave masseurs, gradually quickened the sluggish flow of blood in his veins, roused him, revitalized him and restored his strength so that he would leave the anointing room as if resurrected, with eyes full of wit and aglow with humor, restored to youth, full of life again, so incomparable in his poise, fastidiousness and brilliance that even Otho couldn’t match his style; he would be truly what everyone said he was: the undisputed arbiter of all that was elegant and tasteful.\n\n…………………………………….\n\ntranslated by W.S.
