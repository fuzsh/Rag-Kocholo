        "text": "Description\n\nReviews\n\nDescription\n\nOne of Poland's most engrossing twentieth-century epics, by the 1924 winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature\n\nIn the village of Lipce, scandal, romance and drama crackle in every hearth. Boryna, a widower and the village's wealthiest farmer, has taken the young and beautiful Jagusia as his bride - but she only has eyes for his impetuous son Antek. Over the course of four seasons - Autumn to Summer - the tangled skein of their story unravels, watched eagerly by the other peasants: the gossip Jagustynka, pious Roch, hot-blooded Mateusz, gentle Witek ... Richly lyrical and thrillingly realist, at turns comic, tragic and reflective, Wladyslaw Reymont's magnum opus is a love song to a lasting dream of rural Poland, and to the eternal, timeless matters of the heart.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nWladyslaw Stanislaw Reymont (7 May 1867 - 5 December 1925) was a Polish novelist and the 1924 laureate of the Nobel Prize in Literature. He is best known for his four-volume epic The Peasants (Chlopi), which was original published between 1904 and 1909. Anna Zaranko is a Polish-English translator based in the UK. She has translated Kornel Filipowicz's The Memoir of an Anti-Hero, for which she received the Found in Translation award in 2020.\n\nReviews\n\nA virtuosic new translation... Reymont seeks to draw the reader into the natural flow of this microcosm of society, as well as the community's rich harmony with nature... We lose ourselves in quotidian affairs that unfold at just enough remove in space or time as to enchant us anew... That [Anna] Zaranko manages to sustain this spell over nearly 1,000 pages testifies to her exceptional talents as a translator * TLS *\n\nBook Information\n\nISBN 9780241568064\n\nAuthor Wladyslaw Reymont\n\nFormat Paperback\n\nPage Count 976\n\nImprint Penguin Classics\n\nPublisher Penguin Books Ltd\n\nWeight(grams) 870g\n\nDimensions(mm) 216mm * 135mm * 53mm\n\nReviews\n\nNo reviews yet Write a Review"
