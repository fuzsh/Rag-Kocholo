        "text": "Wladyslaw Stanislaw Reymont was born 7 May 1867 and died 5 December 1925.\n\nQuotes\n\nIt is only our exactions of life that are terrible. It is only our impossible conceptions of beauty and good and justice that are terrible–because they never are realised, and at the same time they prevent us taking life as it is. That is the real source of all our sorrow and suffering.\n\nI was intoxicated by the romantic poetry of our great writers. I arranged the world according to my private use, looking at it through the poems I had devoured.\n\nEverything must go its own way. One has to plough in order to sow, one has to sow in order to harvest, and what is disturbing has to be weeded out.\n\nWladyslaw Stanislaw Reymont was a Polish novelist and the 1924 laureate of the Nobel Prize in Literature. His best-known work is the award-winning four-volume novel Chlopi (The Peasants).\n\nImage\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wladyslaw_Reymont_1924.jpg\n\nNobel Foundation, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nby Amanda Patterson\n\nPlease click here for our Literary Birthday Calendar\n\nPosted on: 7th May 2017\n\n(3,800 views)"
