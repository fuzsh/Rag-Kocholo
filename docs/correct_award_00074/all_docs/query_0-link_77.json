        "text": "The Polish Book Institute, the Polish Cultural Institute in London, and the Polish Cultural Institute in New York are delighted to announce that Anna Zaranko has been awarded the 2023 Found in Translation Award, for her translation of Wladyslaw Reymont's ‘The Peasants’, which was published by Penguin Classics in 2022.\n\nThe year 2022 saw a remarkable selection of outstanding Polish books, now available in English. The longlist featured a blend of classic and contemporary works, spanning a diverse range of literary genres, from prose to poetry, historical and academic essays, making it an impressive celebration of the richness and diversity of Polish literature.\n\nTranslating a piece that subtly delivers a powerful impact on the reader's mind and heart can be a daunting task, yet Anna Zaranko managed to do just that in her translation of Reymont’s 'The Peasants'. The committee recognized Zaranko for her remarkable ability to convey the energy, drama, and humor of the original work.\n\nMegan Thomas, the co-recipient of the 2021 Found in Translation Award, said: ‘Anna Zaranko's astonishing, enthralling translation plunges readers into a world thrumming with life, gliding with seeming effortlessness between salty gossip and piercing longing, wry observation and exquisite lyricism. In her hands, the novel's 900+ pages fly by--a pure pleasure.’\n\nDirector of the Polish Cultural Institute, dr Marta de Zuniga said: ‘This is Anna Zaranko's second Found in Translation Award, which demonstrates her masterful skills as a translator. We are delighted to have talented individuals like Anna translating the finest Polish literature, ensuring that the quality of the original remains intact.’\n\nAs Ursula Phillips noticed in her review of ‘The Peasants’, one of the notable aspects of the novel is the 'peasant-speak' language created by the author, which does not reflect any dialect spoken in rural Poland. Zaranko's translation approaches this language with a light touch, utilizing colorful informal speech that avoids any reliance on British dialects, while still retaining its northern rhythm at times.\n\nZaranko's approach not only makes the original text accessible to contemporary readers but also helps to maintain its authenticity. As a result, her translation is a remarkable testament to her exceptional skill and expertise in translation, and it stands as a significant achievement in the field of Polish literature in translation.\n\nAbout the book\n\nWladyslaw Reymont's masterpiece is a richly poetic and realistic portrayal of the joys and sorrows of rural life. It is both comic and tragic, introspective, and a tribute to the timeless matters of the heart that persist despite the passage of time. Set in the village of Lipce, the novel brilliantly captures the scandal, romance, and drama. The wealthiest farmer in the village, Boryna, who marries the young and beautiful Jagusia, but she only has eyes for his impetuous son Antek. The tangled skein of their story unravels over the course of four seasons, Autumn to Summer, watched eagerly by the other peasants, including the gossip Jagustynka, pious Roch, hot-blooded Mateusz, and gentle Witek.\n\nReymont wrote and published ‘The Peasants’ between 1904 and 1909. The book's universal theme led to Reymont receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1924, which saw its subsequent translation into several European languages.\n\nAbout the translator\n\nAnna Zaranko was born in England to Polish parents. She took a First Class degree in Russian from the University of Durham and went on to hold two British Council scholarships at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow.
