        "text": "Władysław Reymont is the literary alias of Rejment Władysław. He was a Polish novelist, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in the year 1924. He is best known for his novels, Peasants, (1904-1909), which is divided into four parts bearing the names of the different seasons of the year. It was this novel that gained him the Nobel Prize. He died a year after receiving the Nobel prize. I took this photo, as I found it funny, but I did not know who he was, but then I did some research, I'll see if I can find his books in Spanish!"
