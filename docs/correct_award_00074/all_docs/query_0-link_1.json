        "text": "Life\n\nWładysław Stanisław Reymont was born in Radomsko, Poland. He grew up with his aunt and uncle in Warsaw and passed his exam to become a tailor in 1885. However, he never worked a day as a tailor. Instead, he ran away to work in a travelling provincial theatre. He returned to Warsaw in 1892 when his Correspondence was accepted for publication. After that, he dedicated his life to writing, and travelling.\n\nWork\n\nReymont’s best-known novel is The Promised Land, a social panorama of the city of Lodz, Poland during the industrial revolution. The novel is a dark vision of man, where ethics, noble ideas, and holy feelings turn against those who believe in them. His last work, Revolt (1924), describes a revolt by animals that take over their farm to introduce equality, but this quickly generates to abuse and terror. The novel was banned in communist Poland between 1945 and 1989."
