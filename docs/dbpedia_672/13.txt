Leading lady of 1950s films, usually in gentle roles, Marisa Pavan made her motion picture debut in 1952 in John Fords remake of "What Price Glory?" playing a sweet village girl, and won the Golden Globe Award for best supporting actress and was nominated for an Oscar for her work as the formidable Anna Magnanis teen-age daughter in "The Rose Tattoo" (1955).

She played the role of a Native American woman sweet on Alan Ladd in "Drum Beat" (1954). Pavan was in support of Lana Turner in "Diane" (1956), and was the illegitimate daughter of Gregory Peck in "The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit" (1956).

She was leading lady to Robert Stack in "John Paul Jones" (1959), and Abishag in "Solomon and Sheba" (1959).

Her Hollywood days ended with the dawn of the 60s, but Pavan made an appearance in "LEvenment Le Plus Important Depuis Que Lhomme A Marche Sur La Lune / A Slightly Pregnant Man" (1973), seen mostly by French audiences.

Her twin sister, actress Pier Angeli, committed suicide in 1971.

Pavan was married, divorced, and remarried to French actor Jean-Pierre Aumont.
