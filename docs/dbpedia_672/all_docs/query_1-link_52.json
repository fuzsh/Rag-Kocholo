        "text": "1939–1943: Beginnings and stage roles\n\nedit\n\nPeck did not graduate with his friends because he lacked one course. His college friends were concerned for him and wondered how he would get along without his degree. \"I have all I need from the university\", he told them. Peck dropped the name \"Eldred\" and headed to New York City to study at the Neighborhood Playhouse with the legendary acting teacher Sanford Meisner. He was often broke and sometimes slept in Central Park. He worked at the 1939 World's Fair as a barker, at Rockefeller Center as a tour guide for NBC television, and at Radio City Music Hall.[14] Before 1940, he dabbled in modelling, and worked in exchange for food at the Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, where he appeared in five plays, including Family Portrait and On Earth As It Is.[17]\n\nHis stage career began in 1941, when he played the secretary in a Katharine Cornell production of George Bernard Shaw's play The Doctor's Dilemma. The play opened in San Francisco just one week before the attack on Pearl Harbor.[18] He made his Broadway debut as the lead in Emlyn Williams' The Morning Star in 1942.[14] His second Broadway performance that year was in The Willow and I with Edward Pawley. Peck's acting abilities were in high demand during World War II since he had been exempted from military service because of a back injury suffered while receiving dance and movement lessons from Martha Graham as part of his acting training.[19] Twentieth Century Fox later claimed he had injured his back while rowing at university, but in Peck's words, \"In Hollywood, they didn't think a dance class was macho enough, I guess. I've been trying to straighten out that story for years.\"[20] Peck performed in a total of 50 plays, including three short-lived Broadway productions, 4–5 road tours, and summer theater.[21]\n\n1944–1946: Hollywood breakthrough\n\nedit\n\nAfter gaining stage recognition, Peck was offered his first film role at RKO Radio Pictures, the male lead in the war-romance Days of Glory (1944), directed by Jacques Tourneur, alongside top-billed Tamara Toumanova, a Russian-born ballerina.[14] Peck portrayed the leader of Russian guerrillas resisting the Germans in 1941 who stumble across a beautiful Russian dancer (Toumanova), who had been sent to entertain Russian troops; they protect her by letting her join their group.[14][22] During production of the film, Tourneur \"untrained\" Peck from his theater training where he was used to speaking in a formal manner and projecting his voice to the entire hall.[23] Peck considered his performance in the film as quite amateurish and did not wish to watch the film after it was released.[23] The film lost money at the box office, disappeared from theaters quickly,[24][25] and was largely dismissed by critics.[26][23]\n\nAt the time of the film's release, critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times assessed it as slow-moving and verbose, adding that Peck's acting was stiff.[a] Film historian Barry Monush has written, \"Peck's star power was evident from the word go.\"[14] Following the release of the film, Peck gained the attention of producers, but rather than participate in the studio system, he decided to remain a freelancer with the ability to choose his roles, signing non-exclusive contracts with four studios,[28] including an unusual dual contract with 20th Century Fox and Gone With the Wind producer David O. Selznick.[29]\n\nIn Peck's second movie, The Keys of the Kingdom (1944), he plays an 80-year-old Roman Catholic priest who looks back at his undertakings during over half a century of his determined, self-sacrificing missionary work in China.[30][22] The film shows the character aging from his 20s to 80; Peck was featured in almost every scene.[31] The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor, which was Peck's first nomination.[32] Although the film finished only 27th at the box office in North America for 1944,[33] Jay Carr of Turner Classic Movies refers to it as Peck's breakthrough performance,[34] while writer Patrick McGilligan says that it \"catapulted him to stardom\". At the time of release, Peck's performance was lauded by Variety and The New York Times, despite mixed reviews for the film itself.[b] The Radio Times referred to it as \"a long, talkative and rather undramatic picture\" but admitted that \"its success saved Peck's career\".[37] Craig Butler of AllMovie states \"he gives a commanding performance, full of his usual quiet dignity and intelligence, and spiked with stubbornness and an inner fire that make the character truly come alive.\"[38]\n\nIn The Valley of Decision (1944), a romantic drama about intermingling social classes, Peck plays the eldest son of a wealthy steel mill owner in 1870s Pittsburgh who has a romance with one of his family's maids, portrayed by Greer Garson.[39][40] who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Upon release, reviews from The New York Times and Variety were somewhat positive, with Peck's performance described as commanding.[c] It was North America's highest-grossing movie of 1945.[42]\n\nPeck's next film was the first of two collaborations with director Alfred Hitchcock, the suspense-romance Spellbound (1945), opposite Ingrid Bergman. Peck plays a man who is thought to be the new director of the psychiatric facility where Bergman's character works as a psychoanalyst, while his amnesia and disturbing visions suggest he may be a murderer.[43] Peck and Hitchcock were described as having a cordial but cool relationship.[44] Hitchcock initially hoped that Cary Grant would play the male lead. Peck later stated that he thought he was too young when he first worked with Hitchcock and that the director's on-set indifference to his character's motivation, important to Peck's acting style, shook his confidence.[29] Peck's chemistry clicked with his screen partner Bergman; the actors were romantically linked at the time.\n\nReleased at the end of 1945, Spellbound was a hit, ranking as the third-most successful film of 1946.[42] Spellbound was well received by critics at the time, as was Peck's performance.[d] Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised the film, stating that Peck's performance \"restrained and refined, is precisely the proper counter to Bergman's exquisite role;\"[47] Frank Miller of Turner Classic Movies has written that the movie accelerated the rise of Peck into a Hollywood star and even \"a major sex symbol\".[50] Producer David O. Selznick noted that during preview tests of the movie, the women in the audiences had substantive reactions to the appearance of Peck's name during the opening credits, stating that during his first few scenes the audience had to be shushed to quiet down.[50] Spellbound was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, although it was not in the National Board of Review's top ten films of the year.[32][51]\n\nIn The Yearling (1946),[22] Peck portrays a kind-hearted father, opposite onscreen wife, Jane Wyman, whose son finds and insists on raising a three-day-old fawn in 1870s Florida.[43] Reviews upon release were very positive[e] with Bosley Crowther evaluating it as a film that \"provides a wealth of satisfaction that few films ever attain\".[53] The Yearling was a box office success finishing with the ninth highest box office gross for 1947[42] and landed six Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor. Peck won the Golden Globe for Best Actor for performance.[54] In recent decades, it has continued to receive critical praise[f] with Barry Monush writing that it is \"one of the best-made and most-loved family films of its day\".[14]\n\nPeck took his first \"against type\" role, playing a cruel, amoral cowboy in the Western soap opera Duel in the Sun (1946) with top-billed Jennifer Jones as the provocative temptress-object of Peck's love, anger, and desire.[58][59] Their chemistry is described by film historian David Thomson as \"a constant knife fight of sensuality\".[60] Joseph Cotten starred as Peck's righteous half brother and competitor for the affections of the \"steamy, sexpot\" character of Jones;[61] the movie was resoundingly criticized and even banned in some cities due to its lurid nature.[62][63] The publicity around the eroticism of Duel in the Sun,[64] one of the biggest movie advertising campaigns in history,[65][59] used a new tactic of opening in hundreds of theaters across the U.S. at once,[66] saturating the theaters in cities where it opened,[67] resulting in the film's being the second highest grossing movie of both 1947 and all of the 1940s.[68] Nicknamed \"Lust in the Dust\", the film received mostly negative reviews upon release-[g] Bosley Crowther wrote that \"performances are strangely uneven\",[71] although Jones received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. The opinions of Peck's performance have been polarized.[h]\n\n1947–1949: Career setbacks\n\nedit\n\nIn 1947, Peck co-founded The La Jolla Playhouse at his birthplace with Mel Ferrer and Dorothy McGuire.[73] This summer stock company presented productions in the La Jolla High School Auditorium from 1947 until 1964. In 1983, the La Jolla Playhouse re-opened in a new home at the University of California, San Diego, where it operates today. It has attracted Hollywood film stars on hiatus, both as performers and enthusiastic supporters, since its inception.\n\nPeck's next release was the modest-budget, serious adult drama, The Macomber Affair (1947), in which he portrays an African hunting guide assisting a tourist couple. During the trip, the wife, played by Joan Bennett, becomes enamored with Peck, and the husband gets shot.[74] Peck was very active in the development of the film, including recommending director Zoltan Korda.[75] The film received positive reviews[i] but was mostly overlooked by the public upon its release, which Peck would later say disappointed him.[75]\n\nIn November 1947, Peck's next film, the landmark Gentleman's Agreement, directed by Elia Kazan, was released and was immediately proclaimed as \"Hollywood's first major attack on anti-Semitism\".[77][78] Based on a novel, the film has Peck portraying a New York magazine writer who pretends to be Jewish so he can experience personally the hostility of bigots.[79] It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Peck for Best Actor, winning in the Best Film and Best Director categories. It was the second-highest top-grossing film of 1948.[80] Peck would indicate in his later years that the film was one of his proudest works.[81] Upon release, Gentleman's Agreement was widely praised for both its courageousness and its quality,[j][83] Peck's performance has been described as very convincing by many critics, both upon release and in recent years.[k] In recent decades, critics have expressed differing opinions regarding Peck's portrayal, the quality of the film by modern standard, and the film's effectiveness at addressing anti-semitism,[l] with film writer Matt Bailey writing \"Gentleman's Agreement may have been an important film at one time, but was never a good film,\"[88][m][90][n]\n\nPeck's next three releases were commercial disappointments. The Paradine Case was his second and last film with Hitchcock. When producer David O. Selznick insisted on casting Peck for the movie, Hitchcock was apprehensive, questioning whether Peck could properly portray an English lawyer. In later years, Peck did not speak fondly of the making of the movie. Released in 1947,The Paradine Case was a British-set courtroom drama about a defense lawyer in love with his client.[60] It had an international cast including Charles Laughton, Ethel Barrymore and Alida Valli as the accused.[95] The movie received positive reviews, with many complimenting Peck's performance,[o] but it was panned by the public, only recouping half of the $4.2 million production costs.[97] In recent decades, the film was criticized by most prominent writers, although critic's praised Peck's acting.[p] Writers Paul Condon and Jim Sangster stated that \"Peck is vulnerable yet believable in a role that requires significant delicacy of touch to maintain viewer's loyalty and interest.\"[100]\n\nPeck shared top billing with Anne Baxter in the Western Yellow Sky (1948), named for the ghost town where Peck's group of bank robbers seek refuge and encounters the spunky tomboy Baxter, her grandfather, and their gold.[101] Peck gradually develops an interest in Baxter's character, who in turn seems to rediscover her femininity and develops an interest in him.[102][q] Critics who commented on Peck's performance felt it to be solid,[r][104] but said the plot was slightly unbelievable.[s][103] The film was only moderately commercially successful.[105] A year later, Peck was paired with Ava Gardner for their first of three films together in The Great Sinner (1949), a period drama-romance where a Russian writer, Peck, becomes addicted to gambling while helping Gardner and her father pay back their debts.[106] Peck ended up becoming great friends with Gardner, and would later declare her his favorite co-star.[14] Their friendship lasted the rest of Gardner's life, and upon her death in 1990, Peck took in both her housekeeper and her dog.[107] The film received unfavorable reviews usually describing it as dull,[t] and the public was not interested, rendering it a commercial disappointment.[109] In modern times, the film has received mixed reviews[u][55] but TV Guide says \"this often gripping film\" has strong performances, that \"Peck is powerful\" in his portrayal.[110] Peck initially rejected the film, his last movie under his MGM contract, eventually agreeing to do it as a favor to the studio's production head.[111]\n\nHis second 1949 release, Twelve O'Clock High (1949), was the first of many films in which Peck embodies the brave, effective, yet human, \"fighting man\". Based on true events, Peck portrays the new commander of a “hard luck” U.S. World War II bomber group tasked with instilling discipline and pride into the pilots and crews. He believes the former commander failed because he identified too closely with the men and his overly protective attitude caused the squadron to fail in its mission. Peck succeeds in whipping the command into shape, but finds himself caring deeply for his men and finally breaks down after losing his adjutant on a particularly rough mission over Schweinfurt.[79] The National Board of Review ranked it in their top ten films of the year[51] and it received four Academy Awards nominations, Best Actor for Peck.[32] Peck was later recognized in the New York Film Critics Circle for the role.[54] Twelve O'Clock High was a commercial success, finishing tenth in the 1950 box office rankings.[112] The film received strong reviews upon release.[v][114][115] Recent critics maintain positive opinions.[w][119] Evaluations of Peck's performance were positive,[x] with The New York Times describing \"High and particular praise for Gregory Peck ... Peck does an extraordinarily able job in revealing the hardness and the softness of a general exposed to peril.\"[120] Film historian Peter von Bagh considers Peck's performance \"as Brigadier General Frank Savage to be the most enduring of his life\".[121]\n\n1950–1953: Worldwide recognition\n\nedit\n\nPeck began the 1950s with two Westerns, the first being The Gunfighter (1950), directed by Henry King, who had worked with him previously on Twelve O'Clock High. Peck plays an aging \"Top Gun of the West\" who is now weary of killing and wishes to retire with his alluring but pragmatic wife and his seven-year-old son, both of whom he has not seen for many years.[122][123] Peck and King did much photographic research about the Wild West Era, discovering that most cowboys had facial hair, \"bowl\" haircuts and wore beat-up clothing; Peck subsequently wore a mustache while filming.[124][125] The studio's president called for re-shoots upon seeing the initial footage with the mustache, but backed out due to costs that were inflated by the production manager at King and Peck's persuasion.[125][126] The Gunfighter had disappointing sales at the box office,[127] with $5.6 million in receipts, 47th place for earnings in 1951.[128] 20th Century Fox's studio chief Darryl Zanuck blamed Peck's mustache for the lukewarm reaction from Peck's typical fans, stating that they wanted to see the usual handsome, clean-shaven Peck, not the authentic-cowboy Peck.[125] The Gunfighter received \"solid reviews\" upon release, with particular enthusiasm from some critics,[129][y] with Peck's performance \"bringing him some of his best notices\".[14] The New York Times wrote, \"through Mr. Peck's fine performance, a fair comprehension is conveyed of the loneliness and the isolation of a man with a lurid name ... an arresting and quite exciting film.\"[131] The movie has grown in critical appreciation over the years and \"is now considered one of the all-time classic Westerns\"[z] Critics of recent decades uniformly praise Peck's performance,[aa] with David Parkinson of Radio Times saying \"Peck gives a performance of characteristic dignity and grit.\"[135][132][ab]\n\nPeck's next Western was Only the Valiant (1951), a low-budget movie; Peck disliked the script and would later label the film as the low point of his career.[136] Peck's non-exclusive contract with David O. Selznick permitted Selznick to sell Peck's services to Warner Bros for this movie after running into financial difficulties.[136] The plot of the film is listed as \"an unpopular, strict leader gathers together a rag-tag group of men and leads them on an extremely dangerous mission, turning them into a well-oiled fighting machine by the end and earning respect along the way.\"[137] Peck portrays a U.S. army captain and the mission is to protect an undermanned army fort against the attacking Apaches.[138] Peck's romantic interest was played by Barbara Payton.[139] Variety's review said \"In this cavalry yarn ... great pains have been exerted to provide interesting characters. Peck makes the most of a colorful role.\"[140] It earned a moderate $5.7 million, ranking 35th in sales for the year.[141] This little-remembered picture receives mixed reviews today, although Peck's acting is praised.[ac]\n\nPeck's second 1951 release was the book-to-film adaptation Captain Horatio Hornblower, featuring Peck as the commander of a warship in the British fleet during the Napoleonic Wars who finds romance with Virginia Mayo's character. Peck was attracted to the character, saying, \"I thought Hornblower was an interesting character. I never believe in heroes who are unmitigated and unadulterated heroes, who never know the meaning of fear.\"[145] The role had been originally intended for Errol Flynn, but he was felt to be too old by the time the project came to fruition.[146] Captain Horatio Hornblower was a box office success, finishing ninth for the year in the UK[147] and seventh in the North America.[148] Peck's role in the film was largely praised by reviewers. The Associated Press stated that Peck provided \"the proper dash and authenticity as the remarkable nineteenth-century skipper\"[149] and Variety later wrote \"Peck stands out as a skilled artist, capturing the spirit of the character and atmosphere of the period.\"[150] Modern reviews have given mixed reactions of Peck's performance.[ad] Richard Gilliam of AllMovie argues that it is \"an excellent performance from Gregory Peck\" stating that \"Peck brings his customary aura of intelligence and moral authority to the role,\"[153] while the Radio Times asserts \"Gregory Peck plays Hornblower as a high-principle stuff shirt and thus confounds director Raoul Walsh's efforts to inject some pace.\"[154][ae]\n\nHis third film under Henry King's direction, David and Bathsheba, a Biblical epic, was the top-grossing movie of 1951.[112] The two-hit-movie punch of Horatio and David elevated Peck to the status of Hollywood mega-star.[156] David and Bathsheba tells the story of David (Peck), who slew Goliath as a teenager, and later as the beloved King, becomes infatuated with the married Bathsheba, played by Susan Hayward.[157] Peck's performance in David and Bathsheba was evaluated upon release by The New York Times as \"an authoritative performance,\"[158] and Variety stated \"Peck is a commanding personality ... he shades his character expertly\",[159] In recent years, critics have argued that his \"stiff\" performance is made up for in charisma, but overall, they praised his strength in the role;[160][161][162] Leonard Maltin says the movie has \"only fair performances\".[55] David and Bathsheba opened with positive reviews, including praise for avoiding excessive spectacle[af] while remaining an epic with \"dignified restraint\".[163]\n\nPeck returned to swashbucklers in The World in His Arms (1952), directed by Raoul Walsh, who had also directed Captain Horatio Hornblower. Peck portrays a seal-hunting ship captain in 1850 San Francisco who romances a Russian countess played by Ann Blyth and ends up engaging a rival sealer played by Anthony Quinn in a sailing race to Alaska.[164][165] The film was given positive reviews by both contemporary and modern critics.[ag][167][168] All Movie commented that Peck is \"a superb actor, who brings enormous skill to the part, but who simply lacks the overt derring-do and danger that is part of the role.\"[169] The film was moderately successful, more so in the UK than in North America.[170][171]\n\nHe reunited with previous collaborators King, Hayward, and Gardner in The Snows of Kilimanjaro (1952), an adaptation of a short story by Ernest Hemingway.[172] The film stars Peck as a self-concerned writer looking back on his life, particularly his romance with his first wife (Gardner), while he slowly dies from an accidental wound while on an African hunting expedition with his current wife (Hayward) nursing him.[173] The film was praised for its cinematography and direction.[ah][ai] Most reviews praise Peck's performance, with TV Guide saying the story is \"enacted with power and conviction by Peck,\" although some criticized his \"bland\" expressions.[178] Peck, who at that time was married to Finnish American-born Greta Kukkonen, even made a two-day visit to Helsinki in January 1953, participating in an invited guest premiere of The Snows of Kilimanjaro that premiered in Finland.[179] The Snows of Kilimanjaro was a box office hit and ranked as the fourth-highest-grossing movie of 1952.[42]\n\nPeck's \"first real foray into comedy\" was Roman Holiday (1953), directed by William Wyler.[14] He portrayed American journalist Joe Bradley opposite Audrey Hepburn in her first significant film role, playing a European princess.[180][14][181][182][183] Peck's role in Roman Holiday had originally been offered to Cary Grant, who turned it down because the part appeared to be more of a supporting role to the princess.[180] Peck had the same concern, but he was persuaded by Wyler that the on-site filming in Rome would be an exceptional experience and Peck accepted the part, eventually insisting that Hepburn's name be above the title of the film (just beneath his) in the opening credits.[180] Peck later stated that he'd told his agent, \"I'm smart enough to know this girl's going to win the Oscar in her first picture, and I'm going to look like a damned fool if her name is not up there on top with mine.\"[126]\n\nRoman Holiday was a commercial success, finishing 22nd in the box office in 1953.[112] The film continued to garner money after its release, with \"modern sources noting it earned $10 million total at the box office\".[184] Critics praised Peck's performance; Bosley Crowther stated that \"Peck makes a stalwart and manly escort ... whose eyes belie his restrained exterior,\"[183] while the Hollywood Reporter commented that \"Peck turns in another of his outstanding performances playing the love-smitten reporter with intelligence and good-humored conviction;\"[185][186] The film was met with critical acclaim.[aj][186][188][86][ak][191][192] It was nominated for multiple accolades, including 8 Academy Awards, with Hepburn winning for Best Actress; Peck also scored a BAFTA nomination for Foreign Actor.[42] At the 1955 Golden Globe awards, Peck and Hepburn were named the World Film Favorite Award winners for their respective genders.[42]\n\n1954–1957: Overseas and New York\n\nedit\n\nWith his acclaimed performance in The Gunfighter, Peck was offered the lead role in High Noon (1952) but turned it down because he did not want to become typecast in Westerns.[129] Peck was based in the United Kingdom for about eighteen months between 1953 and 1955; new tax laws had drastically raised the tax rate on high-income earners, but the amount due would be reduced if the payer worked outside the country for extended periods.[193] After Roman Holiday's production in Italy, his three subsequent films were shot and set in London, Germany and Southeast Asia, respectively. Peck starred in The Million Pound Note (1954), based on a Mark Twain short story.[194] Peck enjoyed the film's production as \"it was a good comedy opportunity\" and \"was given probably the most elegant wardrobe he had ever worn in film\".[194] He plays a penniless American seaman in 1903 London who is given a one million pound bank note by two rich, eccentric brothers who wish to ascertain if he can survive for one month without spending any of it.[195][194] The film performed modestly at the box office and received mixed reviews for its production.[194][195][196][al] Adrian Turner of the Radio Times praised it as a \"lovely comedy\" which \"has a lot of charm and gentle humor, owing to Peck's evident delight in the role and the unobtrusive direction\" adding it has a \"witty script\".[198]\n\nPeck portrayed a US army colonel investigating the kidnapping of a young soldier in Night People (1954).[199] He later stated that the role was one of his favorites as his lines were \"tough and crisp and full of wisecracks, and more aggressive than other roles\" he'd played. The film received praise for its production and direction, but did poorly at the box office.[201] Peck flew to Sri Lanka to film The Purple Plain (1954), playing a Canadian bomber pilot with strong emotional problems during the Second World War.[193][202][203] The Purple Plain was panned in the United States but became a hit in the United Kingdom, ranking tenth at the box office in 1954,[204] and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film.[42][193][205] Of his performance, Crowther wrote, \"the extent of Peck's agony is impressively transmitted ... in vivid and unrelenting scenes.\"[206] In recent years, the movie \"has become one of Peck's most respected works,\"[193][55][202] with critic David Thomson rating Peck's performance as excellent.[22] Craig Butler of All Movie says that \"Peck is astonishing, giving the sort of layered, intense yet nuanced performance that deserves major awards\".[207]\n\nIn 1954, Peck was named the third most popular non-British film star in the United Kingdom.[208] Peck did not have a film released in 1955. He made a comeback in the US. with The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1956), where he portrays a married, ex-soldier father of three who is increasingly haunted by his deeds in Italy during the Second World War.[209][210] The film saw Peck reunited with Duel in the Sun co-star Jennifer Jones. During the filming of a scene where their characters argue, Jones clawed his face with her fingernails, prompting Peck to say to the director \"I don't call that acting. I call it personal.\"[211] The movie was successful, finishing eighth in box office gross for the year,[212] despite contemporary and modern reviews being mixed.[211][am][213][216][215][an][218][219] Butler of AllMovie declared that \"the role fits (Gregory Peck) as if it had been tailor-made for him. Peck's particular brilliance lies in the quiet strength that is so much a part of him and the way in which he uses subtle changes in that quietness to signal mammoth emotions. He's given ample opportunity to do so here and the results are enthralling ... an exceptional performance\".[218] Radio Times refers to \"the excellent Peck\" and states that Peck plays \"the appealing flawed hero\".\n\nPeck next starred as Captain Ahab in the 1956 film adaptation of Herman Melville's Moby Dick; he was unsure about his suitability for the part but was persuaded by director John Huston to take the role.[220][221] Peck almost drowned twice during filming in stormy weather off the sea coasts of Ireland, and several other performers and crew members suffered injuries.[222] John Huston was named best director of the year by the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Board of Review for Moby Dick, but did not receive a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director. The movie had the ninth highest box office of the year in North America,[42] but cost $4.5 million to make, more than double the original budget, and was considered a commercial disappointment.[222] In 2003, editor Barry Monush wrote, \"There was, and continues to be, controversy over his casting as Ahab in Moby Dick.\"[14] Upon opening, Variety said: \"Peck often seems understated and much too gentlemanly for a man supposedly consumed by insane fury.\"[223][221]The Hollywood Reporter argued \"Peck plays it ... in a brooding, smoldering vein, but none the less intensely and dynamically.\" In modern times, critics have said Peck is: \"often mesmerizing\";[14] \"stoic\" and \"more than adequate\"; \"[224] and \"lending a deranged dignity\" to the role.[55][22][225][178][226][227] Peck himself later said \"I wasn't mad enough, not crazy enough, not obsessive enough – I should have done more. At the time, I didn't have more in me.\"[228]\n\nFor romantic comedy Designing Woman (1957), Peck was permitted to choose his leading lady, Lauren Bacall, who needed to be busy with work as her husband was gravely ill at the time.[229] The film revolves around a fashion designer and a sports writer on a California vacation. They have a whirlwind romance and marry in haste, despite Peck's character already having a girlfriend back home, only to find upon their return to New York, that they have vastly different lifestyles.[230] The film was mildly successful and entered at 35th for annual gross, but did not break even.[231][232] Upon release, Variety said \"Bacall ... is excellent ... Peck is fine as the confused sportswriter\" saying that all the other actors/actresses give top-notch performances.[233][ao] In recent years, the few reviews from prominent critics or websites are generally positive[ap] with TV Guide exclaiming \"they've made ... the famous stoneface ... Peck, somewhat funny. Bacall gives an especially good performance.\" Designing Woman won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.[235]\n\n1958–1959: Reflections on violence\n\nedit\n\nPeck's next movie, the Western The Bravados (1958), reunited him with director Henry King after a six-year gap.[127] King was widely considered to have produced some of Peck's best work; Peck once said \"King was like an older brother, even a father figure. We communicated without talking anything to death. It was direction by osmosis.\"[126][236][237] In The Bravados, Peck's character spends weeks pursuing four outlaws whom he believes raped and murdered his wife and agonizing over his own morals.[238][239][240] The film was a moderate success, finishing in the top 20 of the box office for 1959.[241][42] In recent years, the film and Peck's performance have received mixed reviews,[aq] with Time Out asserting that \"Peck's \"crisis of conscience ... is worked out in perfunctory religious terms;\"[243] and TV Guide stating that Peck's cowboy's \"moment of truth is a powerful one and he gives it all the value it deserves, although much of his acting up to then had been lackluster\".[244]\n\nIn 1956, Peck made a foray into the film production business, organizing Melville Productions and later, Brentwood Productions.[245] These companies produced five movies over seven years, all starring Peck,[245] including Pork Chop Hill, for which Peck served as the executive producer.[246] The films were observed by some as being more political,[29] although Peck said he tried to avoid any \"overt preachiness\".[126] In 1958, Peck and good friend William Wyler co-produced the Western epic The Big Country (1958) separate from Peck's production company.[247] The project ran into numerous issues. Wyler and Peck were dissatisfied with the script, which underwent almost daily revisions after each day's shooting, causing stress for the performers;[248] the actors would arrive the next day and find their lines and even entire scenes different from what they had prepared.[249] The stellar cast included Jean Simmons, Carrol Baker, Chuck Connors, Charlton Heston and Burl Ives; Ives won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his intense performance. There were disagreements between director Wyler and the performers, resulting in Peck storming off-set when Wyler refused to re-shoot a close-up scene;[248] Peck and Wyler's relationship remained strained for three years after production.[248][249] Peck said in 1974 that he had tried producing and acting simultaneously and felt \"either it can't be done or it's just that I don't do it well\".[237]\n\nThe film itself was a big hit, finishing fourth at the domestic box office in 1958[250] and second in the UK.[251][14][252][253] At the time of release, reviews for The Big Country were mixed regarding the producers' prioritization of characterization versus technical filmmaking; opinions on Peck's performance were also disparate.[ar] In recent decades, critical opinion of The Big Country has generally risen, although there is still disagreement; many prominent critics and publications describe the cinematography as excellent, some laud Peck's performance, and some cite the film as too long.[as][259][260]\n\nPeck's next feature was Pork Chop Hill (1959), based on true events depicted in a book.[261] Peck portrays a lieutenant during the Korean War who is ordered to use his infantry company to take the strategically insignificant Pork Chop Hill, as its capture would strengthen the U.S.'s position in the almost-complete armistice negotiations.[262] As executive producer, Peck recruited Lewis Milestone of All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) to direct. Many critics label it as an anti-war film;[14][263] it has also been stated that \"as shooting progressed it became clear Peck and Milestone had very different artistic visions.\"[264] Peck later said the movie showed \"the futility of settling political arguments by killing young men. We tried not to preach; we let it speak for itself.\"[126] Despite solid reviews, the film did only fair business at the box office.[265] Most critics, both upon Pork Chop Hill's opening[at] and in recent years,[au] agree that it is a gritty, grim and realistic rendering of battle action.[268] Three critics who comment on Peck's performance are laudatory,[av] with Variety saying that Peck's performance is \"completely believable. He comes through as a born leader, and yet it is quite clear that he has moments of doubt and of uncertainty.\"[262]\n\nPeck's second release of 1959 cast him opposite Deborah Kerr in Beloved Infidel, which was based on the memoirs of film columnist Sheilah Graham. The film portrays the romance between Graham (Kerr) and author F. Scott Fitzgerald (Peck) during the last three years of his life, towards the end of which Fitzgerald was often drunk and abusive.[269] Crowther assessed it as \"generally flat and uninteresting\" with a \"postured performance of Gregory Peck ... his grim-faced, monotony as a washout is relieved in a couple of critical scenes by some staggering and bawling as a drunkard, but that is hardly enough.\"[270] Variety said that \"the acting, while excellent and persuasive in parts, is shallow and artificial in others. Problem is primarily with Peck who brings to Fitzgerald the kind of clean-cut looks and youthful appearance that conflict with the image of a has-been novelist.\"[271] Reviews from five prominent scribes in recent decades are similar, saying that Peck was blatantly miscast,[aw] TV Guide it was because of their physical differences, and Craig Butler saying \"Peck was an extremely talented actor, but there is nothing in his personality that matches the qualities associated with Fitzgerald.[22]\n\nPeck starred next in On the Beach (1959) alongside Ava Gardner in their third and final film together.[275] The film is considered to be Hollywood's first major movie about the implications of nuclear warfare. Directed by Stanley Kramer and based on Nevil Shute's best-selling book, it shows the last months of several people in Melbourne, Australia as they await the onset of radioactive fallout from nuclear bombs.[276] Peck portrays a U.S. submarine commander who has brought his crew to Australia from the North Pacific Ocean after nuclear bombs had been detonated in the northern hemisphere, who eventually romances Gardner's character.[276] The film was named in the top ten lists of the National Board of Review and the New York Film Critics Circle[277] and was successful at the North American box office, finishing eighth for the year,[42] but due to its high production cost it lost $700,000.[278] On the Beach was praised by critics.[ax][86][276][ay] In recent decades, critical opinion of On the Beach is mixed: some prominent critics asserting that the script is poor,[az] but some critics saying the acting, especially Peck, and cinematography are excellent, and that, overall, the film is powerful.[ba] Butler of AllMovie writes, \"... problematic is the clichéd, almost soap-operatic relationship between Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner and the somewhat melodramatic handling of other sections of the film ... The cast helps tremendously. Peck has rarely been more stalwart ... Even decades after its release, Beach is a harrowing and devastating experience.\"[283]\n\n1960–1964: Continued success\n\nedit\n\nPeck's first release of 1961 was The Guns of Navarone.[284] A J. Lee Thompson-directed World War II drama, it depicts Peck's six-man commando team, which includes David Niven and Anthony Quinn undertaking a mission to destroy two seemingly impregnable German-controlled artillery guns on Navarone Island.[62] The team of specialists (Peck is the mountain climbing expert) needs to destroy the guns so that British ships can evacuate 2,000 trapped British soldiers across the Aegean Sea.[62][285] During filming Peck said that his team seems to defeat \"the entire German army,\" which approaches parody, concluding that cast members had to \"play their roles with complete conviction\" to make the film convincing.[286][287] The film was the top-grossing movie of 1961,[112] and became \"one of the most popular adventure movies of its day\".[14] It landed seven Academy Award nominations, winning for Best Special Effects; other accolades include the Golden Globe Award for Best Dramatic Movie and the BAFTA for Best British Screenplay.[32][286]\n\nCritics praised The Guns of Navarone, naming it the best picture of the year in Film Daily's annual poll of critics and industry reporters in 1961.[bb] Bosley Crowther opined, \"more emphasis is placed on melodrama than on character or credibility,\" that the characters are \"all such predictable people you're likely to get bored with them before the guns are blown up\", and \"One simply wonders why Foreman ... didn't aim for more complex human drama.\" He goes on to write it is a \"robust action drama\" and \"For anyone given to letting himself be entertained by scenes of explosive action and individual heroic display, there should be entertainment in this picture for there is plenty of it ... Even though the picture runs more than two hours and a half, it moves swiftly and gets where it is going. J.Lee Thompson has directed it with pace.\"[288] The New Yorker's film critic declared, it was \"one of those great bow-wow ... movies that are no less thrilling because they are so preposterous\" confessing he \"was held more or less spellbound all the way through this many-colored rubbish.\" In recent decades, most prominent critics or publications give it positive reviews[bc][291][292] Paul V. Peckly of The New York Herald Tribune wrote, \"Peck may seem at times a trifle wooden and his German accent too obviously American .... but his not too introspective, somewhat baffled manner is manly and fitted to the role he plays.[286][285]\n\nPeck's next film was Cape Fear (1962), produced by Melville Productions. Peck portrays a lawyer whose witness testimony convicted Robert Mitchum's character who, upon being released from prison after serving eight years for sexual assault, threatens to get back at Peck through his wife and daughter, and meticulously terrorizes the family.[293] Peck was anxious to have Mitchum in the role of Cady, but Mitchum declined at first, only relenting after Peck and Thompson delivered a case of bourbon to Mitchum's home.[294] Many cuts were made to the movie to satisfy censorship codes in the US and UK.[294] The film grossed only $5 million at the North American box office, 47th for the year.[295] Crowther and Variety gave Cape Fear solid reviews.[bd] Both expressed satisfaction with Peck's performance, although Variety noted he could have been a little more stressed by the occurrences. Other reviews were mixed due to the movie's disturbing nature, including The New Yorker.[294] In recent decades, reviews have been generally positive.[be][302] Critics commented on Peck's performance, with TV Guide saying \"Peck is careful not to act the fear; he's an interesting foe for Mitchum.\"\n\nAfter Cape Fear, Peck planned to make his directorial debut with They're a Weird Mob but eventually did not make the film.[303]\n\nPeck's next role was in the 1962 film adaptation of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel To Kill a Mockingbird, playing the role of kind and scrupulously honest lawyer-father, Atticus Finch.[304] This performance saw his fifth and final Academy Award nomination, for which he won Best Actor. The film received a further seven nominations including for Best Picture, Director, and Cinematography, also winning Adapted Screenplay and Art Direction. At the Golden Globes, Peck won for Best Actor in a Drama, the film was nominated for Best Film and Director. It was also nominated for Best Film at the BAFTAs.[bf][305] The film was a commercial success as the sixth-highest-grossing film of the year.[295] In 2003, Atticus Finch, as portrayed by Peck, was named the greatest film hero of the past 100 years by the American Film Institute.[306] Peck would later say of To Kill A Mockingbird: \"My favorite film, without any question.\"[86]\n\nWhen producer Alan J. Pakula and director Robert Mulligan approached Peck about taking the role of Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird, Peck agreed to read the book. He stated \"I got started on it and of course I sat up all night and read straight through it ... I called them at about eight o'clock in the morning and said 'When do I start?'\"[307][bg] Peck did eventually request changes so that film deviated somewhat from the book, mainly showing more scenes of Peck in the courtroom than were in the original rough cut, thus shifting the focus away from the children, and more towards Atticus Finch.[bh][bi][307] Peck's performance was praised by critics. Variety wrote that the role was especially challenging for Peck but that he \"not only succeeds, but makes it appear effortless, etching a portrayal of strength, dignity and intelligence.\"[bj] The Hollywood Reporter said \"Peck gives probably the finest performance of his career, understated, casual, effective.\"[314] Time posited \"Peck, though he is generally excellent, lays it on a bit thick at times – he seems to imagine himself the Abe Lincoln of Alabama.\"[315][316] Reviews in recent decades have similarly lauded Peck's performance,[bk] with Film Monthly observing, \"Gregory Peck's performance as lawyer Atticus Finch is just as beautiful, natural, and nuanced as the movie itself.\"[321][14] Both Michael Gebert[42] and Andrew Collins of Radio Times[322] refer to Atticus Finch as the role that defined Peck's career.\n\n1965–2000: Mature years and later work\n\nedit\n\nPeck served as the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1967, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the American Film Institute from 1967 to 1969, Chairman of the Motion Picture and Television Relief Fund in 1971, and National Chairman of the American Cancer Society in 1966. He was a member of the National Council on the Arts from 1964 to 1966.\n\nPeck's rare attempts at villainous roles were not acclaimed. Early on, he played the renegade son in the Western Duel in the Sun, and later in his career, the infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele in The Boys from Brazil. In the 1980s, Peck moved to television, where he starred in the mini-series The Blue and the Gray, playing Abraham Lincoln. He also starred with Christopher Plummer, John Gielgud, and Barbara Bouchet in the television film The Scarlet and the Black, about Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty, a real-life Catholic priest in the Vatican who smuggled Jews and other refugees away from the Nazis during World War II.\n\nPeck, Mitchum, and Martin Balsam all had roles in the 1991 remake of Cape Fear, directed by Martin Scorsese. In the remake, Peck played Max Cady's lawyer. His last prominent film role also came in 1991, in Other People's Money, directed by Norman Jewison and based on the stage play of that name. Peck played a business owner trying to save his company against a hostile takeover bid by a Wall Street liquidator played by Danny DeVito."
