        "text": "Cannulation\n\nPlanning for PA cannulation revolves around vascular access assessment and focused echocardiography. To percutaneously access the femoral vein or IJ vein, surface ultrasound should be used to assess the vessel caliber and patency. Patients who require percutaneous PA cannulation often may have limited vascular access secondary to prior access, in situ cannulas, or central venous thrombosis. Additionally, transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography should be used to assess the tricuspid and pulmonic valve structure and function. The tricuspid annulus diameter should be measured, and the regurgitation should be rated according to the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. Furthermore, assessment of the right atrium (RA), RV, and PA should be analyzed and documented. The presence of pacing wires, tricuspid valve (TV) replacement or rings, clots, or thrombus may prevent successful percutaneous RVAD placement. The patency of the superior vena cava (SVC) and caliber can be assessed with contrast injection venogram or digital subtraction venography at the time of cannulation. If there is narrowing, then SVC syndrome may occur with the larger-caliber DLC resulting in obstructing upper-body venous inflow, and smaller cannulas should be selected.\n\n12\n\nBadu B.\n\nDurham III, L.\n\nJoyce L.D.\n\nJoyce D.L.\n\nIatrogenic superior vena cava syndrome from percutaneous right ventricular assist device.\n\n,\n\n13\n\nVaile J.R.\n\nRame J.E.\n\nAlvarez R.J.\n\nMassey H.T.\n\nTchantchaleishvili V.\n\nVishnevsky A.\n\net al.\n\n3 cases of superior vena cava syndrome following percutaneous right ventricular assist device placement.\n\nOnce ready for cannulation, the patient should be prepared and draped in standard fashion (Video 1). The head should be secured in midline position, and draping should provide access to both sides of the neck and bilateral groins. Occasionally, the left IJ vein can be used for access. We have found that if the IJ vein is not accessible, then the supraclavicular approach to the subclavian vein (SCV) is also a viable option. Although a nontraditional access location, the advantage of the supraclavicular approach to the SVC is that after decannulation, direct manual pressure can be applied in this location as opposed to the traditional infraclavicular approach to the SCV. It should be noted that if an alternative upper-body site for cannulation is used, then the operator may encounter difficulty navigating the turn from the SCV/IJ to right innominate vein confluence or the left innominate vein to SVC confluence. Alternatively, femoral approaches to the PA have also been used.\n\n14\n\nRajdev S.\n\nBenza R.\n\nMisra V.\n\nUse of Tandem Heart as a temporary hemodynamic support option for severe pulmonary artery hypertension complicated by cardiogenic shock.\n\nTandem Life (LivaNova) cannulas from the femoral vein have been used to access the PA; however, in recent years with the advent of newer lower-profile neck cannulas, femoral access to the PA has decreased.\n\n3\n\nAbdelshafy M.\n\nCaliskan K.\n\nGuven G.\n\nElkoumy A.\n\nElsherbini H.\n\nElzomor H.\n\net al.\n\nTemporary right-ventricular assist devices: a systematic review.\n\nFinally, the chest should be prepared for the field in case of catastrophic bleeding due to tamponade or PA injury. Percutaneous or surgical drainage of pericardial bleeding may be necessary in this circumstance.\n\nCannulation distally beyond the SVC requires both fluoroscopy and transesophageal echocardiography. Typically, a free-floating C-arm or fixed C-arm fluoroscopy suite is required for anterior-posterior imaging during percutaneous RVAD placement. After obtaining vascular access, a 7F balloon tipped Arrow (Teleflex) flow-directed catheter is navigated to the right PA. By using this catheter, the RA, RV, PA systolic, PA diastolic, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures can be transduced and recorded. With this same catheter, contrast can also be injected, if necessary, to assess the caliber of the SVC, locate the position of the TV, or locate the PA bifurcation (Figure 1). When ready for cannulation, the catheter is positioned just distal to the overlap of the SVC and PA on fluoroscopy such that the catheter crosses itself on the 2-dimensional image (Figure 2). It is important to note that alternative catheters and techniques may be necessary to traverse the TV if there is a tricuspid ring or replacement in the TV position. If there is difficulty floating a balloon-tipped catheter across the TV, a Judkins right catheter or a multipurpose catheter can be used to engage the TV orifice and then a soft wire such as a GLIDEWIRE can be used to traverse the TV into the RV. If percutaneous RVAD placement is done with an open chest, the sternal retractor may need to be removed for imaging, with manual palpation used as a last resort to redirect a catheter from the RV apex to the RV outflow tract.\n\nOnce the balloon-tipped catheter is in the right PA, a 260-cm extra-stiff Amplatz or 260-cm Lunderquist wire with a 4-cm straight floppy tip (Cook Medical) is advanced through the catheter (Figure 2). Care is taken that the wire is not extended too far distally and thereby injuring the smaller segmental PA vasculature. After serial dilation of the insertion site with a Sorin dilator kit (LivaNova), a PA cannula of choice is passed over the wire and the distal tip is positioned into the right PA. In their case report, Loforte and colleagues\n\n15\n\nLoforte A.\n\nBaiocchi M.\n\nDal Checco E.\n\nGliozzi G.\n\nFiorentino M.\n\nLo Coco V.\n\net al.\n\nPercutaneous pulmonary artery venting via jugular vein while on peripheral extracorporeal life support.\n\ndescribe an alternative method of placing a PA venting cannula. In their method, they first access the IJ vein and place a wire into the RA. They then dilate the skin tract and place the cannula into the RA. They then subsequently float a balloon-tipped Swan-Ganz catheter through the back end of the cannula to the PA. Finally, they use the swan as a rail to the PA.\n\n15\n\nLoforte A.\n\nBaiocchi M.\n\nDal Checco E.\n\nGliozzi G.\n\nFiorentino M.\n\nLo Coco V.\n\net al.\n\nPercutaneous pulmonary artery venting via jugular vein while on peripheral extracorporeal life support.\n\nIt is important to confirm the position of the distal tip of the cannula. Under fluoroscopy, it may be difficult to decipher the subtle edge of the cannula in contrast to the dilator. The inner dilator should be retracted back to the distal edge of the cannula under fluoroscopy to confirm the final position of the cannula. If, inadvertently, the cannula is retracted back to the subpulmonic position it is not advised to blindly advance the cannula into the main PA without a wire or dilator. If the cannula is mispositioned, it will need to be completely removed and the balloon-tipped catheter floated to the right PA once more. Unfortunately, if this occurs, a large dilated skin tract exists and a large sheath introducer may need to be placed at the entry site while refloating the balloon-tipped catheter to abate the venous bleeding at the level of the skin. It is advised that the cannula be initially placed into the right or left PA and then the extracorporeal pump flows maximized. The RV size will decrease with increased offloading and decompression of the RV, and the LV geometry will improve. As the process occurs, there is a tendency of the cannula to migrate back at full-flow RVAD support. Only when full flow is achieved should the cannula be retracted back into the final location in the main PA to ensure that the cannula does not inadvertently migrate subpulmonic. It is important that the cannula should be secured posterior to the ear to the occiput to ensure minimal movement in an awake extubated patient.\n\nEchocardiography should be used in tandem with fluoroscopy for final positioning. Two-dimensional imaging and color Doppler are required to ensure equal blood flow to both right and left PAs. Cannula flow if directed unilaterally may result in lung hyperperfusion, edema, and pulmonary hemorrhage.\n\nCannula Selection\n\nCannula selection depends on the institutional resources available and the cannulation strategy planned. There are 4 main percutaneous cannula options. Cannula diameters range from 17F to 31F and typically should be 50 cm or longer.\n\nThe first 2 options are DLC, which include the Protek Duo cannula made by LivaNova and the Spectrum cannula made by Spectrum Medical. A DLC is a cannula that contains both lumens in a single device. The proximal orifice for these cannulas is located in the RA, and the distal orifice is in the PA. The 2 lumens can be used both as inflow, both as outflow or one as inflow and the other as outflow. The Spectrum cannula is unique because it is designed as a dual-stage DLC with inflow holes extended down to the RV. This increases the chances of fully unloading the RV; however, this requires the full outer diameter of the cannula to traverse the TV. Furthermore, the Spectrum cannula relies solely on the competency of the pulmonary valve (PV) to prevent recirculation, whereas the Protek Duo cannula has both the TV and PV in between the 2 separate orifice zones. The outer diameter of the largest cannula is 31F cannula; however, it is important to remember that the distal PA lumen is effectively 15F and therefore limited to flows less than 3.7 L/min to avoid excessive line pressures above 200 mm Hg and subsequent hemolysis.\n\nA third percutaneous PA cannula type is a single lumen, end-hole Next-Gen Biomedicus (Medtronic) venous cannula. This cannula can be used as inflow to an extracorporeal circuit as venting or as an outflow from the extracorporeal circuit. The advantage of using an independent cannula, as opposed to the DLCs, is having a larger distal PA cannula size for optimal flow (17F-21F) and calibrating the size to the indication for support. If using this cannula in the RVAD configuration, a separate femoral venous inflow cannula is needed. This inflow drainage cannula can be optimally positioned in the mid-RA. One of the limitations of the DLCs in the RVAD configuration is that the inflow orifice can be overlying the SVC or TV depending on the patient's size or RV size, and this may result in repeated suck-down events or valvular injury. This may consequently result in less than desired flow rates. An independent 2-cannula setup will allow for optimal inflow with the cannula positioned in the mid-RA as well as little flow resistance in the outflow limb. Second, because of the smaller overall size of the cannula (17F-21F vs 29F-31F), there is a decreased risk of SVC syndrome.\n\n12\n\nBadu B.\n\nDurham III, L.\n\nJoyce L.D.\n\nJoyce D.L.\n\nIatrogenic superior vena cava syndrome from percutaneous right ventricular assist device.\n\n,\n\n13\n\nVaile J.R.\n\nRame J.E.\n\nAlvarez R.J.\n\nMassey H.T.\n\nTchantchaleishvili V.\n\nVishnevsky A.\n\net al.\n\n3 cases of superior vena cava syndrome following percutaneous right ventricular assist device placement.\n\nThe final cannula option is a single-lumen, long, multi-orifice cannula as drainage from the PA and RV for LV venting. In unique situations such as in CPB or peripheral VA ECMO, LV venting is critical to prevent LV distension and LV ischemia and promote recovery. Placing a percutaneous multi-orifice cannula from the IJ vein to the PA and then splicing this into the inflow circuit for CPB or VA ECMO is feasible. It is important to note that both DLCs (Protek Duo or Spectrum Dual-Lumen), the single lumen end-hole Biomedicus venous cannula, or multi-orifice cannulas can be used as PA and RV drainage. The advantage of using these other cannulas for drainage as opposed to the multi-orifice long single lumen cannula for drainage is that these cannulas can be used in a staged fashion. This means that if the cannulas are used up front during CPB or VA ECMO for venting, they can later be reversed as outflow for RVAD support."
