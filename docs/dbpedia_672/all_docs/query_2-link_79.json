        "text": "On July 18, CrowdStrike, an independent cybersecurity company, released a software update that began impacting IT systems globally. Although this was not a Microsoft incident, given it impacts the ecosystem, here is an update on the steps taken: ‚óæÔ∏èCrowdStrike has recommended a workaround to address this issue - https://lnkd.in/gxNssczM ‚óæÔ∏èCrowdStrike public statement - https://lnkd.in/gGsiDP5Y ‚óæÔ∏èInstructions to remedy the situation on Windows endpoints were posted on the Windows Message Center. ‚óæÔ∏èDeploying hundreds of Microsoft engineers and experts to work directly with customers to restore services. ‚óæÔ∏èCollaborating with other cloud providers and stakeholders, including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS), to share awareness on the state of impact we are each seeing across the industry and inform ongoing conversations with CrowdStrike and customers. ‚óæÔ∏èQuickly posting manual remediation documentation and scripts found here - https://lnkd.in/gA9p6Bg3 ‚óæÔ∏èKeeping customers informed of the latest status on the incident through the Azure Status Dashboard here - https://lnkd.in/gzc8FHJR Since this event began, Microsoft maintained ongoing communication with customers, CrowdStrike and external developers to collect information and expedite solutions. The focus is providing customers with technical guidance and support to safely bring disrupted systems back online. We appreciate the cooperation and collaboration of our entire sector, and we will continue to update with learnings and next steps. üîó Full blog here: https://lnkd.in/gVk89TBE #microsoft #technology\n\nüåüCopilot Partner of the Year üåü I'm interrupting my well deserved holiday to share some wonderful news - Accenture and Avanade have been named as the Copilot Partner of the Year 2024 The last 12-18 months have been an incredible journey, as we deployed Copilot internally across both Accenture and Avanade, and alongside that, helped many of our clients as they either prepared for, deployed, adopted or started to transform work with the power of Copilot Achieving this milestone has been a real team effort - bringing together the internal CIO functions, our Avanade office of the CTO, and many parts of our client-facing organisation - in a way that has allowed us to learn by doing to ourselves, and then with clients. While the list of people who have contributed to our success with Copilot is significant across our global organisation, I wanted to highlight some of the people who have played a key role in making Copilot successful, for us and for our clients Ronald White and Marcianne Jenkins and team from Avanade internal IT services Karen Odegaard, Joshua Adney and Uday Adhikari from Accenture CIO Aaron Reich as CTO, and Chris Lloyd-Jones and Diana Wolfe from our Office of the CTO - huge shout out to Diana as the architect of our research approach for Copilot, that allowed us to gain deep insight into the potential and opportunities it presents, very early on. Veit Siegenheim as our Future of Work line of business leader and Anne MacRae as global Modern Work leader Brian K. Payne and Molly Rupert-Sullivan from Accenture T&O Amy Sparling and Chris Howarth from AMBG Natalie Nasrallah who supported all of our marketing efforts for Copilot throughout the last year Phillip Priestley and Niki Mossman - who worked with me from the start to ensure that we brought the best of our Avanade technology, advisory and change enablement services together, to provide end-to-end solutions to our clients Kevin McDonnell, Stephanie Donahue, Mark Rackley and Paul Bullock - early adopters and Microsoft MVPs who all played a key role Chris Stradling Christy Nelson Matthew Fearon Angela Goodwin Ross Campbell Greg T. Tiffany Songvilay ‚òÅÔ∏è Danny de Vries Dex de Boer Franz Schmid Dr. Uta Renken Claudia Ortolani Bernardine Mason Gina Montgomery Austin Palmer Gary Raife Anna Tait While this last year has been a wild ride, we are still only at the very start of this journey. Looking to the next 12 months (and beyond), as we move from the realms of personal productivity into team and org-wide productivity, into the true reinvention of work and business process re-engineering, I am personally incredibly excited for the possibilities, and can't wait to see where Copilot takes us to next! Copilot extensibility and the agentic framework opens up a whole realm of possibilities! #AICopilot #AvanadeDoWhatMatters #PartnerOfTheYear #Copilot"
