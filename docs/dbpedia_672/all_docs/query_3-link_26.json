Very Good.\n\nAlain Cinquini (1941-2021), photographer\n\nL'Est Républicain - Nov. 04, 2012: [Article on Alain Cinquini] It all started when he came across Yves Montand, Paul Newman and their respective wives. \"I went to ask them to take a picture. Newman didn't want to. Simone Signoret told me that it was good to have asked... Montand understood that I would be there, at the exit of the restaurant, and practically organized a session by showing the mountain to Paul Newman. ...Alain Cinquini takes his first photo of stars; that he does not exhibit for several days. It was on the advice of a friend that he finally made contact with the Gamma agency. The beginning of a great career... In a quarter o a century, Alain Cinquini will take between 80,000 and 100,000 shots of the greatest stars, becoming one of the essential independent photographers in the south of France and Monaco...

Having a good reputation, in this environment, it counts, it opens doors. Item #73-2045"
