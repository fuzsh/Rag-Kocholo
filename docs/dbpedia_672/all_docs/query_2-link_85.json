        "text": "A valuable painting by 15th-century master, Sandro Botticelli, has been recovered at a home in southern Italy.\n\nItalian authorities lost track of the Renaissance masterpiece – believed to be worth £85,000,000 – more than 50 years ago.\n\nSince then, it has been long forgotten.\n\nOriginally donated by the artist to Pope Sixtus IV, it was later housed in a church in the town of Santa Maria la Carità.\n\nThen, a local family was entrusted to keep it at their private residence for generations.\n\nIt is thought Botticelli donated it to the farmhouse in the Gragnano as requested by the Pope. The leader of the Roman Catholic Church was trying to appeal to members of the prominent Medici family who owned property in the area, the Art Newspaper reports.\n\nItalian police seize the Botticelli painting\n\nAfter many thought it had been lost forever, the Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Cultural Heritage traced it to a property in Gragnano, near Naples, last year.\n\nThe local Somma family who had the painting claim they kept it hidden to protect it from art traffickers, the outlet reports.\n\nNello D’Auria, the mayor of Gragnano who mediated in the recovery process, said he was contacted by Michele Somma who was ‘in tears and wanted to share a secret,’ Art Newspaper reports citing Italian outlet Il Messeggero.\n\nHe said: ‘We immediately got to work to return this painting to the experts so they could take care of it and allow it to be enjoyed by the community.’\n\nA depiction of Madonna and a child, the painting has deteriorated, with abrasions and chromatic alterations seen all over.\n\nIt will now require major restoration.\n\nSuperintendent Mariano Nuzzo of the Carabinieri said after receiving the work: ‘It will be entrusted to the care of an Institute of the Ministry of Culture specialised in the sector of restoration of works of art in order to start a study process and valorisation of the painting.’\n\nBotticelli’s most famous works include ‘The Birth of Venus’ and ‘Primavera’, which are displayed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.\n\nAuthorities estimate the lesser-known painting to be one of the Italian master’s last before his death at the age of 64 or 65 at around 1510.\n\nPolice are now probing the rightful ownership of the painting, which has been passed down through generations in the family.\n\nIf the family’s ownership is deemed legitimate, the masterpiece may remain with them but could be displayed in a museum for enhanced security.\n\nIf not, it will be transferred to the state. Despite being listed in the Italian state’s works of public interest, private ownership is permissible, provided the owner ensures the painting’s security, preservation, and care.\n\nBotticelli’s work included a range of mythological and religious themes. His career took him from Florence to Rome after he was summoned by Pope Sixtus IV in 1481 to create frescos on the Sistine Chapel walls.\n\nSome of his frescos in the chapel were destroyed to make room for Michelangelo’s work the following century.\n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.\n\nMORE : Painting stolen from gallery in New York 60 years ago shows up in UK\n\nMORE : Marisa Pavan, Oscar-nominated Italian actress in The Rose Tattoo, dies aged 91\n\nMORE : Inside abandoned £80,000,000,000 ghost city where skyscrapers stand empty"
