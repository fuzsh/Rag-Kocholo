To analyze the relationship between crown form of upper central incisors and papilla filling in periodontally healthy Chinese Han-nationality youth. In the study, 180 periodontally healthy Chinese youth ( 75 males, and 105 females ) aged 20-30 (24.3Â±4.5) years were included. With the standardized upper central incisor photography technique, pictures of 360 upper central incisors were obtained. Each tooth was classified as triangular, ovoid or square by 13 experienced specialist majors in prothodontics independently and the final classification result was decided by most evaluators in order to ensure objectivity. The standardized digital photo was also used to evaluate the gingival papilla filling situation. The papilla filling result was recorded as present or absent according to naked eye observation. The papilla filling rates of different crown forms were analyzed. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 19.0. The proportions of triangle, ovoid and square forms of upper central incisor in Chinese Han-nationality youth were 31.4% (113/360), 37.2% (134/360) and 31.4% (113/360 ), respectively, and no statistical difference was found between the males and females. Average Îº value between each two evaluators was 0.381. Average Îº value was raised up to 0.563 when compared with the final classification result. In the study, 24 upper central incisors without contact were excluded, and the papilla filling rates of triangle, ovoid and square crown were 56.4% (62/110), 69.6% (87/125), 76.2% (77/101) separately. The papilla filling rate of square form was higher (P=0.007). The proportion of clinical crown form of upper central incisor in Chinese Han-nationality youth is obtained. Compared with triangle form, square form is found to favor a gingival papilla that fills the\n\nTorque Control During Intrusion on Upper Central Incisor in Labial and Lingual bracket System - A 3D Finite Element Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nPol, Tejas R; Vandekar, Meghna; Patil, Anuradha; Desai, Sanjana; Shetty, Vikram; Hazarika, Saptarshi\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe aim of present study was to investigate the difference of torque control during intrusive force on upper central incisors with normal, under and high torque in lingual and labial orthodontic systems through 3D finite element analysis. Six 3D models of an upper right central incisor with different torque were designed in Solid Works 2006. Software ANSYS Version 16.0 was used to evaluate intrusive force on upper central incisor model . An intrusive force of 0.15 N was applied to the bracket slot in different torque models and the displacements along a path of nodes in the upper central incisor was assessed. On application of Intrusive force on under torqued upper central incisor in Labial system produce labial crown movement but in Lingual system caused lingual movement in the apical and incisal parts. The same intrusive force in normal-torqued central incisor led to a palatal movement in apical and labial displacement of incisal edge in Lingual system and a palatal displacement in apical area and a labial movement in the incisal edge in Labial systemin. In overtorqued upper central incisor, the labial crown displacement in Labial system is more than Lingual system. In labial and lingual system on application of the same forces in upper central incisor with different inclinations showed different responses. The magnitudes of torque Loss during intrusive loads in incisors with normal, under and over-torque were higher in Labial system than Lingual orthodontic appliances. Key words: FEM, lingual orthodontics, intrusion, torque control, labial bracket systems.\n\nElastic band causing exfoliation of the upper permanent central incisors.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlves, Monica Ghislaine Oliveira; Kitakawa, DÃ¡rcio; Becker, Joao Batista Macedo; BrandÃ£o, Adriana Aigotti Haberbeck; Cabral, Luiz Antonio GuimarÃ£es; Almeida, Janete Dias\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective. This study reports a case in which elastic band use culminated in the loss of the incisors. Case Report. An 11-year-old white girl was seen complaining of pain, with purulent discharge and severe tooth mobility. The bone destruction detected radiographically in the region, despite its single location and absence in posterior quadrants of the maxilla and/or mandible, was similar to that observed in Langerhans cell disease. To our surprise, an elastic band involving the midportion of the roots of the two upper central incisors was found during biopsy. The debris was removed and a metal wire was placed in permanent maxillary right and left incisors. The patient was followed up, but no improvement in tooth mobility was observed. Bone loss increased, and internal resorption and root exposure occurred, which culminated in the extraction of permanent maxillary right and left incisors. Conclusion. The present case highlights the fact that professionals sometimes are confronted by anamnestic reports never seen before.\n\n[A case of restoration using IPS empress (staining technique) for upper central incisors].\n\nPubMed\n\nHata, Utako\n\n2007-07-01\n\nThe patient had esthetically unacceptable upper left central incisor crowns. The case was restored using Empress (staining technique) for the upper central incisors on both sides. In making all-ceramic crowns, it is necessary to reproduce the shape and color near to those of the natural tooth. We should not overlook the importance of diagnostic waxing-up, provisional restoration, tooth preparation, gingival retraction and others, to achieve excellent appearance, function and biocompatibility. It is effective to use the staining technique for an anterior tooth crown in order to obtain esthetically satisfactory results by the papilla being present in such cases as the distance from the base of the contact point to the crest of the bone is 5 mm or less.\n\nExtraction of Maxillary Central Incisors: An Orthodontic-Restorative Treatment\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHedayati, Zohreh; Zare, Maryam; Bahramnia, Fateme\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMalformed central incisors with poor prognosis could be candidates for extraction especially in crowded dental arches. This case report refers to a 12-year-old boy who suffered from malformed upper central incisors associated with severe attrition. Upper lateral incisors were positioned palatally and canines were rotated and positioned in the high buccal area. The patient had class II malocclusion and space deficiency in both dental arches. Due to incisal wear and malformed short maxillary central incisors and the need for root canal therapy with a major crown build-up, these teeth were extracted. The maxillary lateral incisors were substituted. Thus the maxillary canines were substituted for lateral incisors and the first premolars were substituted for canines. In the lower dental arch the first bicuspids were extracted. Composite resin build-up was performed on the maxillary lateral incisors and canines. This allowed for the crowding and the malocclusion to be corrected. Subsequent gingivectomy improved the patient's gingival margins and smile esthetics one month after orthodontic therapy.

Fourth-eight plaster casts of 16 patients from ages 6-13 years were appraised longitudinally. It was found that the overjet remains constant, starting at the eruption of the upper permanent central incisors until eruption of the upper permanent canine teeth, while the overbite increases after eruption of the upper permanent lateral incisors and remains constant with the eruption of the canine teeth.\n\nDental transposition of canine and lateral incisor and impacted central incisor treatment: A case report\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGebert, Tarcisio Jacinto; Palma, VinÃ­cius Canavarros; Borges, Alvaro Henrique; Volpato, Luiz Evaristo Ricci\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIntroduction Dental transposition and impaction are disorders related to ectopic eruption or failure in tooth eruption, which can affect child physical, mental and social development and may be difficult to be clinically solved. Methods We describe a case of transposition between the upper left canine and lateral incisor associated with impaction of the central incisor on the same side, in a 12-year-old patient. Conservative treatment involving surgical-orthodontic correction of transposed teeth and traction of the central incisor was conducted. Conclusion The option of correcting transposition and orthodontic traction by means of the segmented arch technique with devices such as cantilever and TMA rectangular wire loops, although a complex alternative, was proved to be esthetically and functionally effective.

The most common causes of canine impactions are usually the result of one or more factors such as a long path of eruption, tooth size-arch length discrepancies, abnormal position of the tooth bud, prolonged retention or early loss of the deciduous canine, trauma, the presence of an alveolar cleft, ankylosis, cystic or neoplastic formation, dilaceration of the root, supernumerary teeth, and odontomas. Although impaction of the maxillary central incisor is almost as prevalent as impacted canines its etiology is different. The principal factors involved in causing the anomaly are supernumerary teeth, odontomas, and trauma. Case #1: A 10.5-year-old girl in the early mixed dentition stage presented with a chief complaint of the appearance of her anterior teeth. She had a Class I skeletal pattern and a history of trauma to the maxillary central incisors at age five with premature exfoliation. Radiographs revealed an impacted upper right central incisor in the region of the nasal floor, delayed eruption of the maxillary permanent central incisor, and the adjacent lateral incisor was inclined toward the edentulous space. Treatment was done in two stages consisting of surgical exposure and traction of the impacted central incisor and fixed orthodontic treatment. Case #2: An 11.5-year-old girl presented for orthodontic treatment with the chief complaint of an unerupted tooth and the appearance of her upper anterior teeth. She was in the late mixed dentition period with a Class III skeletal pattern along with an anterior cross-bite with some maxillary transverse deficiency. The maxillary right canine and central incisor were absent, but the maxillary right deciduous canine was still present. Treatment included arch expansion followed by\n\nClinical and radiographic evaluation of maxillary central incisors exposure in patients undergoing maxillary advancement\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTrento, Guilherme dos Santos; BernabÃ©, Felipe Bueno Rosettti; da Costa, Delson JoÃ£o; Rebellato, Nelson Luis Barbosa; KlÃ¼ppel, Leandro Eduardo; Scariot, Rafaela\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract Introduction: Patients with dentofacial deformities may undergo orthodontic or orthodontic-surgical treatment. Both modalities can affect esthetics. Objective: This study aims to evaluate clinical and radiographic changes in exposure of maxillary central incisors occurring after orthognathic surgery for maxillary advancement. Methods: A total of 17 patients who underwent orthognathic surgery for maxillary advancement between September, 2010 and July, 2011 were selected. Exposure of maxillary central incisors was evaluated clinically and by lateral cephalograms. Measurements were taken one week before and three months after surgery. Data were paired in terms of sex, age, nasolabial angle, height and thickness of the upper lip, the amount of maxillary advancement, clinical exposure and inclination of maxillary central incisor by statistical tests (CI 95%). Results: After maxillary advancement, incisor clinical exposure had increased even with relaxed lips and under forced smile. Moreover, there was a mean increase of 23.33% revealed by lateral cephalograms. There was an inverse correlation between upper lip thickness and incisors postsurgical exposure revealed by radiographic images (p = 0.002). Conclusions: Significant changes in the exposure of maxillary central incisors occur after maxillary advancement, under the influence of some factors, especially lip thickness.

A frontal close-up smile photo of an adult Caucasian woman was selected. The patient had healthy upper anterior dentition and had no history of orthodontic treatment. Images were altered in order to create six different central incisor vertical positions in 0.5-mm increments. All images were assessed in three different views: full smile, gingival close-up excluding incisal edges, and incisal close-up excluding gingival margins. Images were randomly assembled in an album, which was given to 120 judges: 60 orthodontists and 60 laypersons. Each rater was asked to evaluate the attractiveness of the images using the visual analog scale. The data collected were then statistically analyzed. The highest rated smiles showed two notable characteristics: the central-to-lateral incisal step was 1.5âmm; and the central incisor gingival margins matched the laterals, and both were 0.5âmm below the line of the canine gingival margins. The least attractive smile was the one with no step between the centrals and laterals, and with the central incisor gingival margins 1.0âmm above the canine gingival margins. The results of this study indicate that slightly extruded upper central incisors are more esthetically preferred than intruded. The upper central incisors are the key determinant in evaluating smile esthetics, and thus, the assessment of their ideal vertical positioning is an aspect of paramount importance.

The device was designed to reduce the lateral incisor crossbite and the central incisors' labial rotation. The child was treated for 1 year with this removable appliance. Tooth movement was analyzed using cephalograms and surface data were derived from study models. This device proved to be very durable. The lateral incisor crossbite was corrected, and the inclination of the upper central incisors and the interincisal angle were improved. This appliance exerts light and continuous orthodontic force, without requiring any adjustments of the spring wire. The appliance also facilitated orthodontic treatment in a child with intellectual disability in whom treatment with a standard orthodontic device would be unsuitable.

The maxillary dentures of 18 subjects were duplicated. The central incisors were fixed in a pivoting appliance so that their position could be changed from labial to palatal direction. A mechanical push/pull cable enabled the incisor section to be handled extraorally. Connected to the control was a sound generator producing a sinus wave whose frequency was related to the central incisor angulation. This acoustic signal was recorded on one channel of a digital tape recorder. After calibration of the unit, the denture duplicate was inserted into the subject's mouth, and the signal of the /s/ sounds subsequently produced by the subject was recorded on the second channel during alteration of the inclination angle simultaneously with the generator signal. Spectral analysis was performed using a Kay Speech-Lab 4300B. Labial displacement in particular produced significant changes in spectral characteristics, with the lower boundary frequency of the /s/ sound being raised and the upper boundary frequency being reduced. Maxillary incisor position influences /s/ sound production. Displacement of the maxillary incisors must be considered a cause of immediate changes in /s/ sound distortion. Therefore, denture teeth should be placed in the original tooth position as accurately as possible. Our results also indicate that neuromuscular reactions are more important for initial speech sound distortions than are aerodynamic changes in the anterior speech sound-producing areas.\n\n[Upper lateral incisor with 2 canals].\n\nPubMed\n\nFabra Campos, H\n\n1991-01-01\n\nClinical case summary of the patient with an upper lateral incisor with two root canals. The suspicion that there might be an anatomic anomaly in the root that includes a complex root canal system was made when an advanced radicular groove was detected in the lingual surface or an excessively enlarged cingulum.\n\nReversed palatal perforation by upper incisors in ageing blind mole-rats (Spalax ehrenbergi)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZURI, I.; TERKEL, J.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nBlind mole-rats (Spalax ehrenbergi) are fossorial solitary rodents that present striking morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations to the subterranean environment in which they live. Previous studies have shown that mole-rats are specialised in tooth-digging. The rapid eruption-rate of their incisors has evolved to compensate for their excessive wear by excavation. Males use their incisors more than females for digging and fighting, and their rate of incisor eruption is significantly more rapid than in females. Since mole-rats use their incisors for digging throughout the year, we suggest that continuous mechanical pressure on their oral tissues concentrated at the apical sites of the upper incisors leads to cell and tissue fatigue. We provide evidence for 5 stages of palatal perforation by the upper incisors at their apical sites, with maximum perforation characterising aged males. Interspecies comparisons with 7 other fossorial and semi-fossorial rodent species, and with beavers, which expose their incisors to enormous mechanical pressure, revealed that this palatal perforation is unique to the male mole-rat. We suggest that while the fast eruption rate of incisors in the mole-rat compensates for the rapid wear resulting from digging, evolutionary adaptation to continuous tooth-digging is still ongoing, since the physical pressure of digging at the apical sites of the upper incisors leads to tissue destruction, breakage of the palatal bone and possibly to death, as a result of maxillary inflammation.

Bracket positioning and mesiodistal dental movement simulations were performed and the angulations produced in the dental crown were evaluated, based on computed tomography scan images of 30 UCI and AutoCAD software analysis. Rectangular (Andrews) and rhomboid (MBT) brackets were placed according to the references recommended by Andrews and MBT systems - long axis of the clinical crown (LACC) and incisal edge (IE) respectively. Data showed that the use of LACC as reference for bracket positioning produced 5Â° and 4Â° UCI angulations in Andrews and MBT brackets respectively. The use of IE produced a 1.2Â° mean angulation in UCI for both brackets. When the LACC was used as reference for bracket positioning, the UCI crown angulation corresponded to the angulation built into the brackets, regardless of shape, while the use of IE resulted in natural crown angulation, regardless of bracket shape. This research contributes to guide the orthodontist in relation to the different treatment techniques based on the use of preadjusted brackets.\n\nDo different vertical positions of maxillary central incisors influence smile esthetics perception?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMenezes, Erica Bretas Cabral; Bittencourt, Marcos Alan Vieira; Machado, Andre Wilson\n\n2017-01-01\n\nABSTRACT INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to determine the perception of smile esthetics among orthodontists and layperson, with respect to different maxillary central incisors vertical positions in full-face and close-up smile analyses. METHODS: Frontal photographs of the smiles of two adult women were used. Images were altered to create a symmetrical image with the gingival margin levels of the maxillary canines matching the central incisors and a 1.0-mm central-to-lateral incisal step. Later, the images were altered in order to create six different central incisor vertical positions in 0.5-mm increments. The images were randomly assembled in an album, which was given to 114 judges, 57 orthodontists and 57 laypersons, who were asked to evaluate the attractiveness of the images using the visual analog scale. The data collected were statistically analyzed by means of 1-way analysis of variance with the Tukey post-hoc test and the Student t test. RESULTS: The highest rated smiles showed two notable characteristics: a) the central incisor gingival margins matched or were 0.5 mm below the line of the canine gingival margins and; b) the central-to-lateral incisal step was 1.0 to 1.5 mm. The worst smiles showed two notable characteristics: a) the central incisor gingival margins were 1.0 mm above or 1.5 mm below the canine gingival margins and; b) no step between the centrals and laterals or a 2.5-mm step. CONCLUSION: The vertical position of the maxillary central incisors significantly affected the perception of the smile esthetics, whereas slightly extruded central incisors were more esthetically preferred than intruded.

To compare the variation in size of left and right maxillary central incisors for female patients (using digital calipers of 0.01 mm accuracy). To find out the difference between the maxillary central incisors of men and women. Its clinical applicability if difference exists. A total of 70 dental students of PMNM Dental College and Hospital were selected. Of 70 dental students, 40 male and 30 female were selected. Impressions were made for all subjects, using irreversible hydrocolloid (Algitex, manufacturer DPI, Batch-T-8804) using perforated stock metal trays. The mesiodistal crown width and cervical width were measured for each incisor and recorded separately for left and right teeth. The length was measured for each incisor and recorded separately for left and right maxillary central incisor using digitec height caliper. The mean value of maximum crown length of maxillary left central incisor of male was greater in length compared with maxillary right central incisor. Mean value of maximum crown length for male patient right and left side was greater compared with maximum crown length of female patient. When compared the dimensions of teeth between two sex, male group shows larger values to female group.\n\nEstimating the color of maxillary central incisors based on age and gender\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGozalo-Diaz, David; Johnston, William M.; Wee, Alvin G.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nStatement of problem There is no scientific information regarding the selection of the color of teeth for edentulous patients. Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate linear regression models that may be used to predict color parameters for central incisors of edentulous patients based on some characteristics of dentate subjects. Material and methods A spectroradiometer and an external light source were set in a noncontacting 45/0 degree (45-degree illumination and 0-degree observer) optical configuration to measure the color of subjectsâ vital craniofacial structures (maxillary central incisor, attached gingiva, and facial skin). The subjects (n=120) were stratified into 5 age groups with 4 racial groups and balanced for gender. Linear first-order regression was used to determine the significant factors (Î±=.05) in the prediction model for each color direction of the color of the maxillary central incisor. Age, gender, and color of the other craniofacial structures were studied as potential predictors. Final predictions in each color direction were based only on the statistically significant factors, and then the color differences between observed and predicted CIELAB values for the central incisors were calculated and summarized. Results The statistically significant predictors of age and gender accounted for 36% of the total variability in L*. The statistically significant predictor of age accounted for 16% of the total variability in a*. The statistically significant predictors of age and gender accounted for 21% of the variability in b*. The mean ÎE (SD) between predicted and observed CIELAB values for the central incisor was 5.8 (3.2). Conclusions Age and gender were found to be statistically significant determinants in predicting the natural color of central incisors. Although the precision of these predictions was less than the median color difference found for all pairs of teeth studied, and may be considered an acceptable precision, further\n\n[Three-dimensional finite element analysis of maxillary incisor retraction with step-shaped vertical closing loop].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Sheng; Mai, Li-xiang; Liu, Cong-hua; Wang, Da-wei\n\n2011-07-01\n\nTo investigate the displacement and stress distribution of upper incisors in three-dimensional (3D) space controlled by step-shaped vertical closing loop. The maxillary teeth and alveolar bone of a volunteer with normal occlusion were scanned with 3D spiral CT. Modeling and calculation were only carried out on right upper central incisor, lateral incisor and their alveolar bone in order to simplify the procedures. A 3D finite element model of archwire-brackets-upper incisors and periodontal tissues was developed using Ansys finite element package. Finally, a 3D finite element model of archwire-brackets-upper incisors and periodontal tissues was established based on mirror symmetry principle. The displacement of maxillary incisors and stress distribution in periodontal tissues were analyzed. When step-shaped vertical closing loop was simply drew back 1 mm, the maximum displacement of upper central incisor in labial and lingual direction were 5.29 Ã 10(-2) and 0.71 Ã 10(-2) mm; 10.47 Ã 10(-3) and 10.20 Ã 10(-3) mm in gingival and occlusal direction, 10.26 Ã 10(-3) and 1.63 Ã 10(-3) mm in medial and distal direction; the maximum displacement of upper lateral incisor in labial and lingual direction were 3.31 Ã 10(-2) and 0.41 Ã 10(-2) mm, 10.52 Ã 10(-3) and 5.10 Ã 10(-3) mm in gingival and occlusal direction, 6.29 Ã 10(-3) and 4.64 Ã 10(-3) mm in medial and distal direction, the displacement trend of them were moving lingually and gingivally similar to bodily movement. The stress peach of upper central incisor, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone were 31.35, 2.52 and 4.64 MPa, the stress peach of upper lateral incisor, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone were 19.59, 1.28 and 4.12 Mpa, the stress distribution of them were similar and the periodontal ligament buffered the stress imposed on the tooth.\n\nOrthodontically induced eruption of a horizontally impacted maxillary central incisor.\n\nPubMed\n\nRizzatto, Susana Maria Deon; de Menezes, Luciane Macedo; Allgayer, Susiane; Batista, Eraldo Luiz; Freitas, Maria PerpÃ©tua Mota; Loro, Raphael Carlos Drumond\n\n2013-07-01\n\nThis case report presents the clinical features and periodontal findings in a patient with a horizontally impacted maxillary central incisor that had been exposed and aligned after a closed-eruption surgical technique. By combining 3 treatment stages-maxillary expansion, crown exposure surgery, and induced eruption-the horizontally impacted incisor was successfully moved into proper position. The patient finished treatment with a normal and stable occlusion between the maxillary and mandibular arches, and an adequate width of attached gingiva, even in the area surrounding the crown. The 5-year follow-up of stability and periodontal health demonstrated esthetic and functional outcomes after orthodontically induced tooth eruption. Clinical evaluation showed that the treated central incisor had periodontal clinical variables related to visible plaque, bleeding on probing, width of attached gingiva, and crown length that resembled the contralateral incisor.

The problem can be either mechanical obstruction of eruption or a failure of the eruption mechanism. This case report presents failure of eruption of the maxillary right deciduous central incisor in a 4-year-old girl. The unerupted primary tooth was removed surgically. The histological finding revealed fibroma with reactive giant cells. Periodic follow-up visits were advised to monitor the developing dentition and to ensure enough space for the permanent incisor.

Materials in this study comprised of 33 dental casts. Plaster replicas of the A.S.U. system plaques were used to facilitate standardization in scoring and classify shoveling regarding both upper central and lateral incisors. Dimensions of the dental arch namely, overjet, overbite, arch depth, arch width and irregularity index were measured. The correlation between the shovel shape of the central incisor and the lateral incisor was highly significant. Significantly relations were found between the grades of shoveling and the mesiodistal diameters of upper first molars and lower incisors. Positive correlation was admitted between the shoveling and upper arch depth anterior, and upper arch depth. It may be considered that the grades of shoveling are indirectly related with upper and/or lower anterior crowding. Although crowding is looks like an expression of disharmony between teeth and alveolar arch, it may be caused by multiple etiologic factors interacted directly and/or indirectly.\n\nEvaluation of the mineralization degree of the vestibular surface of the upper central incisors with a 655-nm diode laser in mouth breathers: preliminary results\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPinheiro Ladalardo, Thereza C. C. G.; Cappellette, Mario, Jr.; Zanin, Fatima A. A.; Brugnera, Aldo, Jr.; Anthero de Azevedo, Ramiro; Pignatari, Shirley; Weckx, Luc L. M.\n\n2003-06-01\n\nMouth breathing unbalances the physiological mechanisms of the dental surface hydration by compromising lip closure, and, very often, causing the vestibular positioning of upper incisors. That variance leads to the interruption of the dental demineralization and remineralization feedback, prevailing a demineralized condition of the dental surface which increases caries risk. The laser fluorescence examination allows an early demineralization diagnosis, thus it makes possible through preventive measures to minimize the risk factor - dental mineral structure loss - in the bacterial infection of the demineralized area, and hence, preventing invasive therapeutical procedures. A DIAGNOdent apparatus was used to evaluate the mineralization degree of the upper central incisors in 40 patients - twenty of them with a mouth breathing diagnosis; the remaining twenty were nasal breathers (control group). Age ranging from 6 to 12 years, both male and female. To measure the vestibular surface of the incisors, it was divided into 3 segments: cervical, medial and incisal. The average of the results pertaining to the mouth breathing patients was as follows: tooth 11 cervical third - 5.45, medial third - 7.15, incisal third - 7.95, and tooth 21 - cervical third - 5.95, medial third - 7.25, incisal third - 8.15. The control patients, nasal breathers, presented the following results: tooth 11 cervical third - 1.75, medial third - 2.30, incisal third - 1.85, and tooth 21 - cervical third - 1.80, medial third - 2.20, incisal third - 2.15. The mouth breathing patients showed demineralization in the teeth examined at the initial stage, subclinical, comparing with the control patients, nasal breathers, who did not present any mineral deficit in these teeth.\n\nRestoration of a fractured central incisor.\n\nPubMed\n\nOlson, Bradley J\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe treatment of a traumatically damaged single central incisor poses significant challenges relative to function and esthetics to the restoring clinician. Providing a good long-term prognosis is paramount when determining whether to maintain or extract a structurally compromised tooth. Successful restoration demands timely and thorough risk assessment along with excellent communication with both the patient and the laboratory fabricating the restoration.\n\nOrthodontic movement of a maxillary incisor through the midpalatal suture: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarib, Daniela Gamba; Janson, Guilherme; dos Santos, PatrÃ­cia Bittencourt Dutra; de Oliveira Baldo, Taiana; de Oliveira, Gabriela Ulian; Ishikiriama, SÃ©rgio Kiyoshi\n\n2012-03-01\n\nOrthodontic space closure is a treatment alternative when a maxillary central incisor is missing. The objective of this report was to present an unusual treatment in which a right maxillary central incisor was moved through the midpalatal suture to replace the absent contralateral tooth. The biologic aspects and clinical appearance of the recontoured lateral and central incisors were analyzed. The position of the examined teeth and the appearance of the surrounding soft tissues were satisfactory; however, the upper midline frenulum deviated to the left. The incisor was successfully moved with no obvious detrimental effects as observed on the final radiographs. In the radiographic and tomographic examinations, the midline suture seemed to have followed the tooth movement. The patient expressed satisfaction with the results. It was concluded that orthodontic movement of the central incisor to replace a missing contralateral tooth is a valid treatment option, and the achievement of an esthetic result requires an interdisciplinary approach, including restorative dentistry and periodontics.\n\nEvaluation of root and alveolar bone development of unilateral osseous impacted immature maxillary central incisors after the closed-eruption technique.\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Xiangru; Xie, Xiaoyan; Quan, Junkang; Wang, Xiaozhe; Sun, Xiangyu; Zhang, Chenying; Zheng, Shuguo\n\n2015-10-01\n\nIn this study, we evaluated root and alveolar bone development in unilateral osseous impacted immature maxillary central incisors by cone-beam computed tomography before and after closed-eruption treatment, in comparison with naturally erupted contralateral immature maxillary central incisors. The study included 30 patients, 20 boys and 10 girls, with a mean age of 8.44 Â± 1.20 years (range, 6.5-11.2 years). After treatment, the root lengths of both the impacted maxillary central incisors (10.66 Â± 2.10 mm) and the contralateral maxillary central incisors (11.04 Â± 1.76 mm) were significantly greater than their pretreatment values (6.67 Â± 1.94 and 9.02 Â± 2.13 mm, respectively). The root canal widths of the incisors decreased significantly after treatment. From the posttreatment cone-beam computed tomography images, the ratio of exposed root length to total root length and the thickness of the alveolar bone at 1 mm under the alveolar crest and at the apex were calculated to evaluate alveolar bone development. Impacted immature maxillary central incisors differed significantly from contralateral immature maxillary central incisors in labial exposed root length, labial ratio to total root length, and lingual alveolar crest. Clinical crown height was higher (statistically but not clinically) for the impacted incisors (9.87 mm) than for the contralateral incisors (9.37 mm). Impacted immature incisors grew to the same stage as did erupted contralateral incisors after closed-eruption treatment. Both incisor types had some alveolar bone loss, and thin alveolar bone surrounded the roots. Copyright Â© 2015 American Association of Orthodontists. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A patient was referred to the clinic with fracture of the two maxillary central incisors. Clinical examination revealed that both teeth were fractured in the middle third of the crown and that the fractures involved enamel and dentin with no pulp exposure. The patient had also suffered a lower lip laceration. When the lip was evaluated, a fractured fragment of the maxillary right central incisor was found inside the wound. The missing part of the tooth was replaced via adhesive attachment. Due to the damage of the fractured part of the maxillary left central incisor, direct composite restoration of this tooth was performed. With the advent of adhesive dentistry, the process of fragment reattachment has become simplified and more reliable. This procedure provides improved function, is faster to perform, and provides long-lasting effects, indicating that reattachment of a coronal fragment is a realistic alternative to placement of conventional resin composite restorations.\n\nCombined orthodontic-restorative management of maxillary central incisors lost following traumatic injury: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nFleming, Padhraig S; Seehra, Jadbinder; Dibiase, Andrew T\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA history of traumatic dental injury to the maxillary central incisors during preadolescence or adolescence is common and may result in premature loss. Treatment options include prosthetic implant replacement, autotransplantation, and orthodontic space closure with direct composite recontouring. This case report describes the treatment of an adolescent girl who presented with a crowded Class I malocclusion complicated by a history of trauma to the maxillary central incisors. The treatment plan consisted of orthodontic space closure following loss of both maxillary central incisors and mandibular premolars. This case highlights that orthodontic space closure can be a valuable treatment option in selected Class I crowded and Class II uncrowded malocclusions, producing predictable and efficient results.\n\nInner canthal distance and golden proportion as predictors of maxillary central incisor width in south Indian population.\n\nPubMed\n\nGeorge, Shibu; Bhat, Vinaya\n\n2010-01-01\n\nEven though the constant relation of golden proportion and inner canthal distance (ICD) with the width of the maxillary central incisor (CIW) has been found in European population, it may not be applied to Indian population as we differ from Europeans racially and genetically. Hence, this study was carried out with the objectives of determining if these parameters are applicable to our population also. Three hundred south Indian subjects between 18 and 26 years of age, free from facial and dental deformities were examined. Inner canthus of each eye was used as soft tissue landmark. The maxillary central incisors were measured at the contact point area with the help of digital vernier caliper. The CIW was also calculated using golden proportion ratio to obtain the calculated central incisor width. A comparison was made with measured width. Statistical analyses were done to identify any significant difference using \"Z\" tests. Pearson's Correlation Coefficient test was used to evaluate the measured and the calculated width of the central incisor. ICD and the width of two maxillary incisors were in golden proportion in south Indian population. Also, ICD when multiplied by a decreasing function value of the golden proportion and divided by 2 is a reliable predictor of determining CIW. As in the European population, the ICD and the golden proportion are reliable predictors for determining the width of the maxillary central incisors in the south Indian population also.\n\nBiologic restoration of a traumatized maxillary central incisor in a toddler: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohn, Sheen Ann; Anandaraj, S; George, Sageena\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTrauma to the anterior teeth is relatively common in young children and teenagers. Traumatized anterior teeth require quick functional and aesthetic repair, and poses a challenge to the dental practitioner owing to the lack of co-operation ceded and the longer time invested. Reattachment of tooth fragment should be the first choice to restoring teeth when a usable fragment is available, since it gives a psychological and aesthetic advantage over the conventional technique. With the vast improvement in adhesive technology, reattachment is definitely a predictable treatment option for very young children. This paper describes the treatment of a 2Â½ year old female child who sustained crown-root fracture, extending subgingivally, in primary upper central incisor.\n\nOrthodontic treatment of a patient with unerupted maxillary central and lateral incisors and canine: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nSabuncuoÄlu, Fidan AlakuÅ; Olmez, HÃ¼seyin\n\n2012-05-01\n\nThe aim of this case report was to describe the orthodontic and periodontal management of a patient with three impacted anterior teeth. An 18-year-old female with Class I crowding on a Class I skeletal base presented with the chief complaint of an unaesthetic smile. Clinical examination revealed an impacted upper right permanent canine (13), lateral (12) and central incisor (11), a retained deciduous incisor and moderate crowding in the lower arch. The impacted teeth were surgically exposed (closed exposure) and aligned with fixed appliances. The 12 was extracted due to root resorption and 44 extracted to resolve the lower arch crowding. A fraenectomy and gingival recontouring were required. Orthodontic treatment resulted in improved overjet, overbite and an acceptable facial profile. The patient reported improved self esteem. While impacted anterior teeth are a clinical challenge, their surgical exposure, in combination with fixed appliances, is a conservative treatment plan which is not without complications.\n\nMultidisciplinary Restoration of Traumatized and Displaced Maxillary Central Incisor by Bent Wire System-A Novel Approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nSasalawad, Shilpa S; Jogani, Vivek; Pai, Suryakanth M; Chour, Rashmi C; Balehosur, Deepti V\n\n2016-11-01\n\nManagement of traumatic injuries to teeth is a challenge to dental practice, as it occurs when dentists are least prepared for it. The direction and the force of the object or the fall significantly affects the diagnosis, treatment plan and therefore the outcome of the treatment. These traumatic injuries may present with different clinical situations which demand immediate attention and assessment by the clinician. The maxillary central incisor crown fractures are the most common variant of trauma, because of the anterior and protrusive positioning. This case report describes the novel method to produce expansion of the dental arches to correct the post-traumatic displacement of the central incisor along with aesthetic and functional rehabilitation of Ellis Class IV fracture of permanent maxillary central incisor.\n\nOrthodontic management of a dilacerated central incisor and partially impacted canine with unilateral extraction - A case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nFelicita, A Sumathi\n\n2017-10-01\n\nTo align a dilacerated maxillary central incisor and partially impacted canine with unilateral extraction in a young patient with skeletal deep bite. A 14Â year old male patient reported to the hospital with skeletal deep bite (basal plane angle-17Â°), severe horizontal pattern of growth (Go-Gn to Sn -22Â°), upright maxillary incisors (U1 to NA -26Â°) and retroclined lower incisors (L1 to NB -11Â°). The maxillary left central incisor was dilacerated, and the maxillary left canine was partially impacted. Unilateral extraction of the left maxillary premolar and left mandibular central incisor was done. A canine disimpaction spring was used to align the impacted canine. An anterior bite plane was given to open the bite. Superimposition of lateral cephalogram (T1, T2) revealed bite opening, normal overjet and overbite. There was backward rotation of the mandible and increase in lower anterior facial height. There was no evidence of root resorption or loss of vitality in the dilacerated tooth. Clinically the canine was well aligned in the arch. Orthodontic management of a dilacerated incisor can be done without root resorption or loss of vitality. The partially impacted canine was well aligned in the arch. Unilateral extraction can produce good treatment results.\n\nSignificance of crown shape in the replacement of a central incisor with a single implant-supported crown.\n\nPubMed\n\nGobbato, Luca; Paniz, Gianluca; Mazzocco, Fabio; Chierico, Andrea; Tsukiyama, Teppei; Levi, Paul A; Weisgold, Arnold S\n\n2013-05-01\n\nWhen utilizing a single implant-supported crown to replace a central incisor, understanding the final shape of the implant restoration is an important factor to help achieve a successful esthetic outcome. In today's dentistry, tooth shape is a critical factor when dental implant prostheses are considered in the esthetic zone. The major esthetic goal for this type of restoration is to achieve the closest possible symmetry with the adjacent tooth, both at the soft and at the hard tissue levels. The goal of this study was to objectively analyze the significance of natural crown shape when replacing a central incisor with a single implant-supported crown. In this study, we investigated the shape of the crowns of maxillary central incisors in 60 individuals who presented to our clinics with an untreatable central incisor. The presence of a dental diastema, \"black triangle,\" presence or absence of gingival symmetry, and the presence or absence of dental symmetry were recorded in the pre- and postoperative photographs. Out of 60 patients, 33.3% had triangular-shaped crowns, 16.6% square/tapered, and 50% square-shaped crown form. After treatment was rendered, 65% of the triangular group, 40% of the square/tapered group, and 13.3% of the square group required an additional restoration on the adjacent central incisor in order to fulfill the esthetic needs of the patients. Data analysis revealed that if there is a \"black triangle,\" a diastema, or presence of dental or gingival asymmetry, an additional restoration on the adjacent central incisor is often required in order to fulfill esthetic goals. The additional restoration is highly recommended in situations with a triangular crown shape, while it is suggested in cases of square/tapered and square tooth shapes in the presence of a dental diastema.\n\nEndodontic treatment of a maxillary central incisor with two roots.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaghsoudlou, Amir; Jafarzadeh, Hamid; Forghani, Maryam\n\n2013-03-01\n\nThis clinical report presents a rare case of maxillary central incisor with two separate roots. Unusual morphology of the roots and root canals may exist in any tooth. Recognition of the dental anatomy and its variations is necessary for successful endodontic therapy. It is well known that maxillary incisors are usually single-rooted teeth. The root canals were instrumented with conventional hand files and Gates Glidden and obturated by using the lateral technique. Recall radiograph after 1 year shows the healing process of the preoperative apical periodontitis. Clinicians should be aware of unexpected root canal morphology when performing root canal therapy. The present case demonstrated the importance of accurate preoperative radiograph and adequate access preparation.\n\nManagement of a congenitally missing maxillary central incisor. A case study.\n\nPubMed\n\nTichler, Howard M; Abraham, Jenny E\n\n2007-03-01\n\nWhen a maxillary lateral incisor is missing, often the treatment options can be clearly defined, that is, substitute an adjacent tooth for the missing one; open the space for an implant, a bonded bridge or fixed bridge. When a maxillary central incisor is missing and the space for the tooth is absent, the treatment choices become complicated, especially in a growing child. There must be multi-disciplinary coordination among the restorative dentist, the oral surgeon or periodontist, and the orthodontist to obtain the optimum result. At the initiation of treatment, this information must be relayed and the treatment plan agreed upon by the patient or the parents of the patient.\n\nRehabilitation of the dominance of maxillary central incisors with refractory porcelain veneers requiring minimal tooth preparation.\n\nPubMed\n\nda Cunha, Leonardo Fernandes; Gonzaga, Carla Castiglia; Saab, Rafaella; Mushashe, Amanda Mahammad; Correr, Gisele Maria\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCentral dominance is an important element of an esthetic smile. Color, form, and size have been suggested as tools for assessing the dominance of maxillary teeth. A spectrophotometer can be used to determine the value, hue, and chroma. Correct sizing of restorations according to the central incisor dominance principle improves not only esthetics but also aspects of occlusion, such as anterior guidance. Refractory porcelain systems can effectively restore the color, shape, emergence profile, and incisal translucency. This report illustrates the esthetic and occlusal rehabilitation of the dominance of maxillary central incisors using fabricated minimal thickness refractory porcelain veneers.\n\nBilateral presence of two root canals in maxillary central incisors: A rare case study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKavitha, M; Gokul, Kannan; Ramaprabha, B; Lakshmi, Amudha\n\n2014-04-01\n\nSuccess in root canal treatment is achieved after thorough cleaning and shaping followed by complete obturation of the canal system. Therefore, endodontic therapy requires specific and complete knowledge of the internal and external dental anatomy, and its variations in presentation. The internal anatomy of the maxillary central incisor is well-known and usually presents one root canal system. This case report describes an endodontic treatment of traumatized both maxillary central incisors with two canal systems. Knowledge of dental anatomy is fundamental for proper endodontic practice. When root canal treatment is performed, the clinician should be aware that both external and internal anatomy may be abnormal.\n\nImpaction of Maxillary Central Incisors: Surgical and Orthodontic Treatment--Case Report.\n\nPubMed\n\nKnop, Luegya Amorim Henriques; Shintcovsk, Ricardo Lima; Gandini, Luiz Gonzaga; Parsekian, Lidia; Pinto, Ary Santos\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe aim of this paper is to report two clinical cases, which was performed with surgical exposure and orthodontic traction of a maxillary central incisors. Light forces were used during the orthodontic treatment applied on rigid wires as anchorage. It was noted that teeth presented adequate clinical crown height and gingival contours.\n\nContour changes in human alveolar bone following tooth extraction of the maxillary central incisor.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Bei; Wang, Yao\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to apply cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) to observe contour changes in human alveolar bone after tooth extraction of the maxillary central incisor and to provide original morphological evidence for aesthetic implant treatment in the maxillary anterior area. Forty patients were recruited into the study. Each patient had two CBCT scans (CBCT I and CBCT II), one taken before and one taken three months after tooth extraction of maxillary central incisor (test tooth T). A fixed anatomic reference point was used to orient the starting axial slice of the two scans. On three CBCT I axial slices, which represented the deep, middle, and shallow layers of the socket, labial and palatal alveolar bone widths of T were measured. The number of sagittal slices from the start point to the pulp centre of T was recorded. On three CBCT II axial slices, the pulp centres of extracted T were oriented according to the number of moved sagittal slices recorded in CBCT I. Labial and palatal alveolar bone widths at the oriented sites were measured. On the CBCT I axial slice which represented the middle layer of the socket, sagittal slices were reconstructed. Relevant distances of T on the sagittal slice were measured, as were the alveolar bone width and tooth length of the opposite central incisor. On the CBCT II axial slice, which represented the middle layer of the socket, relevant distances recorded in CBCT I were transferred on the sagittal slice. The height reduction of alveolar bone on labial and palatal sides was measured, as were the alveolar bone width and tooth length of the opposite central incisor at the oriented site. Intraobserver reliability assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) was high. Paired sample t-tests were performed. The alveolar bone width and tooth length of the opposite central incisor showed no statistical differences (P<0.05). The labial alveolar bone widths of T at the deep, middle, and shallow layers all showed\n\nA clinical study to evaluate the correlation between maxillary central incisor tooth form and face form in an Indian population.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoralakunte, Pavankumar R; Budihal, Dhanyakumar H\n\n2012-09-01\n\nA study was performed to examine the correlation between maxillary central incisor tooth form and face form in males and females in an Indian population. The selection of prosthetic teeth for edentulous patients is a primary issue in denture esthetics, especially in the case of maxillary central incisors, which are the most prominent teeth in the arch. Two hundred dental students of Indian origin comprising 79 males and 121 females aged 18-28 years studying at Bapuji Dental College and Hospital were randomly selected as the study subjects. A standardized photographic procedure was used to obtain images of the face and the maxillary central incisors. The outline forms of the face and the maxillary right central incisor tooth were determined using a standardized method. The outline forms obtained were used to classify both face form and tooth form on the basis of visual and William's methods. The means were considered after evaluation by five prosthodontists, and the results were tabulated. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-squared test for association and Z-test for equality of proportions. A correlation greater than 50% was observed between tooth form and face form by the visual method, compared with one of 31.5% by William's method. There was no highly defined correlation between maxillary central incisor tooth form and face form among the male and female Indian subjects studied.\n\nDirect restoration of endodontically treated maxillary central incisors: post or no post at all?\n\nPubMed\n\nvon Stein-Lausnitz, Manja; Bruhnke, M; Rosentritt, M; Sterzenbach, G; Bitter, K; Frankenberger, R; Naumann, M\n\n2018-04-30\n\nThe aim of this ex-vivo study was to evaluate the impact of cavity size and glass-fiber post (GFP) placement on the load capability of endodontically treated maxillary incisors directly restored with resin composite. Ninety-six extracted human maxillary central incisors were endodontically treated and distributed to four groups (nâ=â24): access cavity (A), access cavity and uni-proximal class III cavity (U), access cavity and bi-proximal class III cavity (B), and decoronated tooth (D). Specimens were restored with resin composite, and 12 specimen of each group received an adhesively placed glass-fiber post (P). Prior to linear loading, specimens were exposed to thermo-mechanical loading (TCML). Statistical analysis was performed using log-rank test after TCML, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test to compare load capabilities (F max) . Significantly more failures occurred in group D for specimens without GFP during TCML (pâ=â0.001). F max (mean (SD) in N was (A) 513 (124), (AP) 554 (201), (U) 438 (171), (UP) 537 (232) (B) 483 (219), (BP) 536 (281), D 143 (181), and DP 500 (331), and differed significantly among groups (pâ=â0.003). Pair-wise comparison revealed lower F max values for group D compared to all other groups (pâ<â0.034) except group DP. Endodontically treated maxillary central incisors with cavity sizes up to bi-proximal class III may be successfully directly restored with resin composite. Post placement shows no additional effect except for decoronated endodontically treated incisors. Endodontically treated incisors with access cavities to class III cavities can be successfully restored with resin composite. Post placement for decoronated ETT is recommended.\n\nPrevalence of shovel-shaped incisors in Saudi Arabian dental patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaini, T S; Kharat, D U; Mokeem, S\n\n1990-10-01\n\nThe prevalence of maxillary incisor shoveling was studied radiographically in 990 Saudi patients. According to the radiomorphologic characteristics, a new classification was developed and shovel teeth were categorized. The findings of this study showed 9% shovel-shaped incisors; among those, 4% were central incisors and 5% were lateral incisors. Frequency of dens invaginatus occurrence with the shovel-shaped incisors was also investigated. Eight percent of shovel-shaped incisors showed presence of dens invaginatus. Prevalence was found to be 4% in central shovel-shaped incisors, whereas that in lateral shovel-shaped incisors was 11%.\n\nCamouflage treatment for class III malocclusion combined with traction of an impacted maxillary central incisor.\n\nPubMed\n\nCloss, Luciane Quadrado; Mundstock, Karina Santos; Ribeiro, Darlene Santos; Reston, Eduardo Galia; Silva, AurelÃ­cio Novaes\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis case report describes the treatment of a patient with an unerupted maxillary left central incisor, class III malocclusion with crossbite of the maxillary posterior teeth and lateral open bite. Treatment consisted of rapid maxillary expansion followed by anterior space opening, maxillary protraction and traction of the unerupted teeth with a light force system. Favorable results were obtained in terms of correcting incisor position and class III malocclusion. The results achieved remained stable throughout a 4-year retention period.\n\nMultiple supernumerary teeth associated with an impacted maxillary central incisor: Surgical and orthodontic management\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYeluri, Ramakrishna; Hegde, Manjunath; Baliga, Sudhindra; Munshi, Autar Krishen\n\n2012-01-01\n\nVarious anomalies in the size, shape, number, structure and eruption of the teeth are often observed clinical conditions. Supernumerary teeth can be found in almost any region of the dental arch, and most of the times they are asymptomatic, and are routinely found during radiographic evaluation. The most common cause of impacted maxillary incisors is the presence of the supernumerary teeth. This paper describes a case of multiple supernumerary teeth associated with an impacted permanent maxillary central incisor in an 11-year old child along with its surgical and orthodontic management.

Previous analyses of anthropoid incisor allometry and shape demonstrate that incisor morphology is correlated with preferred foods and that more frugivorous anthropoids have larger and more curved incisors. Although the relationship between incisal crown curvature and preferred foods has been well documented in extant and fossil anthropoids, the functional significance of curvature variation has yet to be conclusively established. Given that an increase in crown curvature will increase maximum linear crown dimensions, and bending resistance is a function of linear crown dimensions, it is hypothesized that incisor crown curvature functons to increase incisor crown resistance to bending forces. This study uses beam theory to calculate the mesiodistal and labiolingual bending strengths of the maxillary and mandibular incisors of hominoid and platyrrhine taxa with differing diets and variable degrees of incisal curvature. Results indicate that bending strength correlates with incisal curvature and that frugivores have elevated incisor bending resistance relative to folivores. Maxillary central incisor bending strengths further discriminate platyrrhine and hominoid hard- and soft-object frugivores suggesting this crown is subjected to elevated occlusal loading relative to other incisors. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that incisor crown curvature functions to increase incisor crown resistance to bending forces but does not preclude the possibility that incisor bending strength is a composite function of multiple dentognathic variables including, but not limited to, incisor crown curvature.

Methods: Thirty class â patients with bimaxillary protrusion that received fixed orthodontic treatment in Department of Stomatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from January 2011 to September 2014 were selected using random number table. All the patients were treated with extraction of four first premolars and retraction of anterior teeth using implant anchorage. Cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans were performed before and after incisor retraction for all patients. The CBCT data of the upper airway were constructed using Mimics 16.0, and the flow field characteristics inside the upper airway were simulated using Ansys 14.0. The changes of volume (V), mean cross-sectional area (mCSA), maximum lateral diameters/maximum anteroposterior diameters (LP/AP) of cross section, the maximum pressure of airflow (P(max)), the minimum pressure of airflow (P(min)) and pressure drop (â³P) of nasopharynx, oropharynx and hypopharynx before and after incisor retraction were measured and compared using paired t test. The correlation between the variation of â³P in the most significant pharyngeal part and the morphological variables after incisor retraction was analyzed using Pearson correlation test. Results: No statistical differences were observed in the morphology and flow field in nasopharynx before and after incisor retraction ( P> 0.05). Before incisor retraction, the oropharyngeal volume and mCSA were (7 580Â±622) mm(3) and (217Â±40) mm(2), respectively, and the hypopharyngeal volume and mCSA were (2 564Â±162) mm(3), and (239Â±43) mm(2), respectively. After incisor retraction, the volumes of oropharynx and hypopharynx were (6 885Â±601) mm(3) and (2 535Â±156) mm(3), respectively, and mCSA of oropharynx and hypopharynx were (197Â±37) mm(2) and (236Â±42) mm(2), respectively\n\nWhere to position osteotomies in genioglossal advancement surgery based on locations of the mental foramen, canine, lateral incisor, central incisor, and genial tubercle.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Joshua S; Lee, Christopher; Rogers, Jason M; Sun, Ho-Hyun; Liu, Yuan F; Elo, Jeffrey A; Inman, Jared C\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe study aimed to provide precise measurements of anterior mandibular structural anatomy and to explore potential osteotomies for genioglossal advancement. Cone beam computed tomography was used to analyze 33 randomly selected patients undergoing surgery for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) between 2014 and 2016 at an academic surgical hospital. The locations of relevant mandibular structures were measured and statistical modeling was performed. Mean horizontal distances from midline to the mental foramina and the roots of the canine, lateral incisor, and central incisor were 22.11Â Â±Â 1.92, 13.56Â Â±Â 3.01, 6.19Â Â±Â 1.58, and 2.04Â Â±Â 0.87Â mm, respectively. Mean vertical distances from the inferior border of the mandible were 15.15Â Â±Â 1.77, 17.11Â Â±Â 3.28, 20.48Â Â±Â 3.10, and 21.81Â Â±Â 3.49Â mm, respectively. The superior border of the genial tubercle was 15.63Â Â±Â 2.75Â mm, and the inferior border was 6.87Â Â±Â 3.29, from the inferior border of the mandible. The angle of decline of the best-fit line through the important structures was about 18Â° from the occlusion plane at the midline. A straight line estimating the mental foramen, canine, lateral incisor, and central incisor tooth roots crosses at a mean of 22.3-22.6Â mm above the inferior border of the mandible at the midline and has an angle of decline of about 18Â°. Potential osteotomies made parallel to and below this line result in tradeoffs between maximizing capture of the genioglossus muscle attachment and risk of dental/neurovascular injury.\n\nMorphological features of the maxillary incisors roots and relationship with neighbouring anatomical structures: possible implications in endodontic surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nTaschieri, S; Weinstein, T; Rosano, G; Del Fabbro, M\n\n2012-05-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the root apex of the upper incisors and neighbouring anatomical structures as well as the morphology of the root-end foramen after apicoectomy. Fifty-seven patients requiring endodontic surgical treatment for a maxillary anterior root were enrolled. A preoperative diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scan was analysed to determine: the distance between the anterior wall of the nasopalatine duct and the central (CI-ND) incisor root 4mm from the apex; and the distance between the floor of the nasal cavity and the tip of either the central (CI-NF) or the lateral (LI-NF) incisor root. After apicoectomy, root-end foramen endoscopic pictures were taken in order to characterize their morphology. Fifty-nine central and 26 lateral incisors were evaluated. The average CI-ND was 4.71 Â± 1.26 (SD) mm. The average CI-NF was 10.62 Â± 2.25 mm. The average LI-NF was 13.05 Â± 2.43 mm. The foramen shape after apicoectomy was ovoid to circular in about 90% of cases in both central and lateral incisors. A sound knowledge of the anatomical relationships at the surgical site is essential for the clinician to perform a safe endodontic surgical procedure.

An accurate analysis of this fresco shows a single incisor tooth is present precisely in the midline. We hypothesize that it may be a case of solitary median maxillary central incisor (SMMCI) and discuss the differential diagnosis with another similar anomaly--the mesiodens.\n\nThe genetics of shovel shape in maxillary central incisors in man.\n\nPubMed\n\nBlanco, R; Chakraborty, R\n\n1976-03-01\n\nFrom dental casts of 94 parent-offspring and 127 full-sib pairs, sampled from two Chilean populations, shovelling indices are computed to measure the degree of shovelling of maxillary central incisors quantitatively. Genetic correlations are computed to determine the role of genetic factors in explaining the variation in this trait. Assuming only hereditary factors to be responsible for the transmission of shovel shape, 68% of total variability is ascribed to the additive effect of genes.\n\nRelationship between crown-root angulation (collum angle) of maxillary central incisors in Class II, division 2 malocclusion and lower lip line.\n\nPubMed\n\nSrinivasan, Bhadrinath; Kailasam, Vignesh; Chitharanjan, Arun; Ramalingam, Arthi\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe present study aimed to measure the magnitude of the collum angle (crown-root angulation) of maxillary central incisors present in Class II, division 2 malocclusion and to relate the changes in its magnitude with variations in the lower lip line. A set of 120 conventional lateral cephalograms were selected and divided into three groups of 40 each based on the type of malocclusion presented: Class II, division 2 (group 1); Class II, division 1 (group 2); and Class I (group 3). The collum angle of the maxillary central incisor was measured, and the lower lip line was recorded. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the mean collum angle was statistically significantly different in the three groups. The mean collum angle was greatest in Class II, division 2 malocclusion (group 1). The mean collum angles were 3.24 Â± 4.69 degrees, 0.95 Â± 1.06 degrees, and 1.05 Â± 1.50 degrees in groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively. In Ï Â² test comparison of the location of the lower lip line (incisal, middle, or apical third of the central incisor) among the three groups, the lower lip line was found to contact the middle third of the central incisor most frequently in Class II, division 2 malocclusion. ANOVA followed by Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) test showed that the mean collum angle is significantly increased when the lower lip is in the middle third (P < .05) of the central incisor. Variations in magnitude of the collum angle with the change in the lower lip line suggest a probable etiologic role of the lower lip line in the development of the collum angle.\n\nTransposition of maxillary canine to central incisor site: aetiology, treatment options and case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nAli, Zohaib; Jaisinghani, Aneel C; Waring, David; Malik, Ovais\n\n2014-09-01\n\nDental transposition is relatively infrequent anomaly of the developing dentition.

When the patient has missing or hopeless teeth other than premolars, it is possible to consider removal of those teeth to use the space to decrease crowding. A 15-year-old girl sought treatment for severe crowding. She had already lost her maxillary right first premolar as a result of caries 1Â year previously and had a hopeless maxillary right central incisor. Her mandibular left first molar still caused discomfort even after endodontic treatment. Extractions of the maxillary right central incisor and mandibular right first premolar and left first molar were chosen to resolve the occlusion problems. Orthodontic mini-implants were placed to translocate the maxillary left central incisor across the midpalatal suture to use the space in the maxillary right quadrant to relieve the crowding. Although a different extraction option was used in each quadrant, the final occlusion was acceptable. After debonding, porcelain crowns were placed on the anterior teeth to improve esthetics. The treatment result remained stable after 2Â years of retention. Copyright Â© 2018 American Association of Orthodontists. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although a chronic dentoalveolar abscess was diagnosed, vitality test signs were positive. Treatment consisted of pulpotomy with calcium hydroxide paste; after 2 1/2 months a permanent root canal filling was placed in the amputated part. Follow-up 2 years postoperatively indicated that the tooth has maintained its vitality. The periapical area is completely healed, and apical closure is evident.\n\nRestoration of an intruded maxillary central incisor with a uniquely designed dowel and core restoration: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nPolat, Zelal SeyfioÄlu; Tacir, Ibrahim Halil\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis article describes the restoration of an intruded root using a custom-made metal dowel and metal-ceramic veneer core restoration. The treatment plan for this patient consisted of restoring the missing esthetics and eliminating psychological trauma by utilizing the root of the intruded maxillary left central incisor to replace both missing central incisor crowns. This treatment will preserve space and bone until the patient is old enough for another prosthodontic restoration to be considered. As the lost fragments were not recovered, we considered this restoration of the intruded root to be the best therapeutic option, considering the effect on the patient's psyche. The patient was satisfied with the final result.\n\nConservative restoration of a traumatically involved central incisor.\n\nPubMed\n\nBassett, Joyce\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThe use of a direct composite material known for excellent polishability, polish retention, and wear resistance is described in this case of a fractured central incisor restoration. The method used enabled the clinician to conserve tooth structure and maintain full control of the outcome while creating an esthetically imperceptible, reliable, and durable restoration for a young male patient. Emphasized in this case are the techniques of layering, contouring, and polishing of a nanocomposite used to maximize esthetics and meet patient expectations. To further ensure imperceptibility, the author recommends first facilitating color shade selection for both body and dentin-especially in two-shade or multiple-shade restorations-by placing the composite in its planned area of the restoration and curing it in its proper thickness to allow a preview and recipe map.\n\nThe influence of varying maxillary lateral incisor dimensions on perceived smile aesthetics.\n\nPubMed\n\nBukhary, S M N; Gill, D S; Tredwin, C J; Moles, D R\n\n2007-12-22\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the influence of varying the dimensions of the maxillary lateral incisors on perceived smile aesthetics. Clinical study. Postgraduate dental teaching hospital. A photograph of a female smile displaying only the lips and teeth was digitally altered. First, the width of the maxillary lateral incisors, in proportion to the central incisor, was altered at 5% intervals to produce six images (52%, 57%, 62% [the 'golden proportion'], 67%, 72% and 77%). In a second group, the length of the lateral incisor was altered at 0.5 mm increments to produce five images with the lateral incisor 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 1.5 mm, 2 mm and 2.5 mm shorter than the adjacent central incisor. The photos were ranked from 'most attractive' to 'least attractive' by 41 hypodontia patients, 46 non-hypodontia 'control' patients and 30 dentists. The 67% followed by the 72% lateral-to-central width proportions were the 'most preferred' by all groups. A maxillary lateral incisor that is 1-1.5 mm shorter than the central incisor was the 'most popular' maxillary lateral incisor length. The very short and very long maxillary lateral incisor was consistently perceived as 'least attractive'. There is no evidence to suggest that the golden proportion should be considered the ideal aesthetic standard when creating space for the replacement of missing lateral incisors.\n\nAutotransplantation of a Strange Positioned Impacted Central Incisor in a surgically Prepared Socket: A Miracle Esthetic Concept.\n\nPubMed\n\nJaiswara, Chandresh; Srivastava, Vinay K; Dhiman, Neeraj\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEsthetics is a prime concern for a young lady. Any anomaly in the anterior tooth may create anxiety and depression. This anxiety and depression may hamper her married life and overall personality. This case report reveals an unerupted right central incisor situated in a strange position, creating space in the maxillary anterior region and giving an unesthetic appearance. Autotransplantation is a method of choice for a strangely positioned impacted central incisor in a new appropriate site. This method offers a new treatment option for some clinical situations if orthodontic approach is not possible. It permits tooth movement to a distant or the opposite side of the same dental arch as well as to the opposite jaw. This procedure also offers potential benefits of reestablishment of normal alveolar process development, esthetics, functions, and arch integrity. This procedure has the potential to become a viable alternative treatment plan for young patients of low socioeconomic status, allowing the reestablish-ment and restoration of a missing tooth and their functions. This article discusses methods of auto-reimplantation of a tooth in a fresh surgically prepared socket, its biological principle, and establishment of functions, esthetics, and phonetics.

They are considered as one of the reliable methods of identification of a person in forensic sciences. The aim of the following study is to establish morphometeric measurements by AutoCad 2009 (Autodesk, Inc) of permanent maxillary central incisors in different age groups of Udaipur population. Hospital-based descriptive cross-sectional study carried out in Udaipur. A study was carried out on 308 subjects of both genders with the age range of 9-68 years. Standardized intra-oral radiographs were made by paralleling technique and processed. The radiographs were scanned and the obtained images were standardized to the actual size of radiographic film. This was followed by measuring them using software AutoCad 2009. F-test, post-hoc test, Pearson's correlation test. For left maxillary central incisor, the total pulp area was found to be of 38.41 Â± 12.88 mm and 14.32 Â± 7.04 mm respectively. For right maxillary central incisor, the total pulp size was 38.39 Â± 14.95 mm and 12.35 Â± 5 mm respectively. Males (32.50, 32.87 mm(2)) had more pulp area when compared with females (28.82, 30.05 mm(2)). There was a decrease in total pulp area with increasing age which may be attributed to secondary dentin formation.\n\n[Finite element analysis of the maxillary central incisor with crown lengthening surgery and post-core restoration in management of crown-root fracture].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhen, Min; Hu, Wen-jie; Rong, Qi-guo\n\n2015-12-18\n\nTo construct the finite element models of maxillary central incisor and the simulations with crown lengthening surgery and post-core restoration in management of different crown-root fracture types, to investigate the stress intensity and distributions of these models mentioned above, and to analyze the indications of crown lengthening from the point of view of mechanics. An extracted maxillary central incisor and alveolar bone plaster model were scanned by Micro-CT and dental impression scanner (3shape D700) respectively. Then the 3D finite element models of the maxillary central incisor and 9 simulations with crown lengthening surgery and post-core restoration were constructed by Mimics 10.0, Geomagic studio 9.0 and ANSYS 14.0 software. The oblique static force (100 N) was applied to the palatal surface (the junctional area of the incisal 1/3 and middle 1/3), at 45 degrees to the longitudinal axis, then the von Mises stress of dentin, periodontal ligament, alveolar bone, post and core, as well as the periodontal ligament area, were calculated. A total of 10 high-precision three-dimensional finite element models of maxillary central incisor were established. The von Mises stress of models: post>dentin>alveolar bone>core>periodontal ligament, and the von Mises stress increased linearly with the augmentation of fracture degree (besides the core). The periodontal ligament area of the crown lengthening was reduced by 12% to 33%. The von Mises stress of periodontal ligament of the B2L2c, B2L3c, B3L1c, B3L2c, B3L3c models exceeded their threshold limit value, respectively. The maxillary central incisors with the labial fracture greater than three-quarter crown length and the palatal fracture deeper than 1 mm below the alveolar crest are not the ideal indications of the crown lengthening surgery.\n\nCorrelation between Visible Length of the Iris and the Length of the Maxillary Central Incisor Using Digital Image Analysis- A Pilot Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRohini; Hemalatha; Chander, Gopi Naveen; Anitha, Kuttae Viswanathan\n\n2017-02-01\n\nComplete denture therapy is one such modality where science and art goes hand in hand. Selection of artificial teeth for completely edentulous patients is not easy in the absence of pre extraction records, because till date concrete guidelines do not exist. The purpose of this study was to determine if a correlation existed between the visible length of the iris and the length of the maxillary central incisor to potentially provide a guide for teeth selection. A total of 20 Indian dental students consented to participate in the pilot study. Standardized digital images of the face revealing the eyes and component of teeth on smiling was captured using a digital camera. The digital measurements of the visible iris length (medial aperture height, tangential to iris) and the length of the maxillary central incisor from the zenith to the incisal edge were analysed using Adobe Photoshop creative cloud software. The data was statistically evaluated and results were tabulated. Karl Pearson's Coefficient of Correlation was utilized to detect if any association existed between the two variables. The mean value of length of central incisor was 10.39 mm and the mean value of the visible length of iris was found to be 12.9 mm. A Pearson correlation analysis revealed an r-value <0.3 indicating minimal association between the two variables with a p-value >0.01 (.322). On inference, the correlation between the visible iris length and that of maxillary central incisor were unable to produce a strong positive statistical association. However, an association factor between the two has been obtained. Deduction of 2.5 mm from the dimension of visible iris length will help in attaining the length of artificial maxillary central incisor tooth.\n\n[Three-dimensional finite element analysis of the upper cervical-defected incisor with labial access or lingual access].\n\nPubMed\n\nSu, Fan; Zhao, Ying; Su, Qin\n\n2013-08-01\n\nTo evaluate the stress distribution of the cervical-defected incisor with labial or lingual endodontic access with finite element analysis (FEA), and to explore the advantage of resistance in labial endodontic access. 3-D finite element models of upper cervical-defected incisor were established using cone-beam CT (CBCT), Mimics Catia, and Ansys software. The subjects were categorized according to the two endodontic accesses and three restorative ways, which were composite resin, glass fiber-reinforced composite resin and glass fiber-reinforced post-crown. All the models were loaded.The von Mises stress values and distribution were recorded and analyzed with Ansys 10.0 software. In this study, direct composite resin restoration showed no significant difference between the labial and lingual access. In glass fiber-reinforced composite resin, labial access could transfer the stress concentration area. It could reduce the incidence of fracture of the cervical lesion but increase the incidence of root fracture. Post-crown restoration could obviously reduce the incidence of fracture of the cervical lesion. When the cervical-defected incisor is restored with composite resin, labial and lingual accesses can be considered. Labial access with glass fiber-reinforced composite resin or post-crown restoration is a good choice.\n\nOrthodontic intrusion of maxillary incisors: a 3D finite element method study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSaga, Armando Yukio; Maruo, Hiroshi; Argenta, Marco AndrÃ©; Maruo, Ivan Toshio; Tanaka, Orlando Motohiro\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective: In orthodontic treatment, intrusion movement of maxillary incisors is often necessary. Therefore, the objective of this investigation is to evaluate the initial distribution patterns and magnitude of compressive stress in the periodontal ligament (PDL) in a simulation of orthodontic intrusion of maxillary incisors, considering the points of force application. Methods: Anatomic 3D models reconstructed from cone-beam computed tomography scans were used to simulate maxillary incisors intrusion loading. The points of force application selected were: centered between central incisors brackets (LOAD 1); bilaterally between the brackets of central and lateral incisors (LOAD 2); bilaterally distal to the brackets of lateral incisors (LOAD 3); bilaterally 7 mm distal to the center of brackets of lateral incisors (LOAD 4). Results and Conclusions: Stress concentrated at the PDL apex region, irrespective of the point of orthodontic force application. The four load models showed distinct contour plots and compressive stress values over the midsagittal reference line. The contour plots of central and lateral incisors were not similar in the same load model. LOAD 3 resulted in more balanced compressive stress distribution.

The samples consisted of 20 adult patients (mean [SD] age, 23.55 [4.30] y) who had CIII/LUI-PM and were treated with rotational MXS and mandibular setback using LeFort I osteotomy and bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy. The lateral cephalograms were obtained 1 week before (T0), 1 week after (T1), and 1 year after surgery (T2). The amounts of surgical movement, relapse, and stability rate of the upper central incisor (UIE), upper first molar (U6MBC), point A (A), incisive canal point, and posterior nasal spine (PNS) in relation to the reference planes were statistically analyzed. During T1 - T0, there were backward and downward movements of UIE and A, backward and upward movements of U6MBC, and upward and slight forward movements of PNS due to rotational MXS. The center of rotation of the maxilla was placed between A and the upper premolar area. During T2 - T1, skeletal landmarks showed clinically insignificant counterclockwise rotational relapse (<0.5 mm). The anteroposterior (AP) and vertical positions of skeletal landmarks were more stable than dental landmarks. The U6MBC was more stable in the vertical aspect than UIE (P < 0.01). Posterior nasal spine showed significantly higher stability rate in both vertical and AP aspects (P < 0.01, respectively), whereas UIE showed a lower value in the vertical aspect (P < 0.05). Rotational MXS procedure in cases with CIII/LUI-PM can be regarded as a stable one, especially in the vertical and AP positions of PNS. Vertical relapse in UIE should be managed with postoperative orthodontic treatment.\n\nMorphometric analysis of pulp size in maxillary permanent central incisors correlated with age: An indirect digital study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRavindra, S.

Miniscrews during incisor intrusion are commonly used in implant orthodontics. Traditionally, effective incisor intrusion has been accomplished with J-hook headgear. In this study, we compared the effect of incisor intrusion, force vector, and amount of root resorption between implant orthodontics and J-hook headgear. Lateral cephalometric radiographs from 8 patients in the implant group and 10 patients in the J-hook headgear group were analyzed for incisor retraction. The estimated force vector was analyzed in the horizontal and vertical directions in both groups. Root resorption was also measured on periapical radiographs. In the implant group, significant reductions in overjet, overbite, maxillary incisor to palatal plane, and maxillary incisor to upper lip were observed after intrusion of the incisors. In the J-hook headgear group, significant reductions in overjet, overbite, maxillary incisor to upper lip, and maxillary incisor to SN plane were observed after intrusion of the incisors. There were significantly greater reductions in overbite, maxillary incisor to palatal plane, and maxillary incisor to upper lip in the implant group than in the J-hook headgear group. Estimated force analysis resulted in significantly more force in the vertical direction and less in the horizontal direction in the implant group. Furthermore, significantly less root resorption was observed in the implant group compared with the J-hook headgear group. The maxillary incisors were effectively intruded by using miniscrews as orthodontic anchorage without patient cooperation. The amount of root resorption was not affected by activating the ligature wire from the miniscrew during incisor intrusion.\n\nThe Dance of Tusks: Rediscovery of Lower Incisors in the Pan-American Proboscidean Cuvieronius hyodon Revises Incisor Evolution in Elephantimorpha\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe incisors of proboscideans (tusks and tushes) are one of the most important feature in conservation, ecology and evolutionary history of these mammals. Although the absence of upper incisors is rare in proboscideans (occurring only in deinotheres), the independent losses of lower incisors are recognized for most of its lineages (dibelodont condition). The presence of lower incisors in the Pan-American gomphothere Cuvieronius hyodon was reported a few times in literature, but it was neglected in systematic studies. We analyzed several specimens of Cuvieronius hyodon from the Americas and recognized that immature individuals had lower incisors during very early post-natal developmental stages. Subsequently, these are lost and lower incisors alveoli close during later developmental stages, before maturity. Moreover, for the first time in a formal cladistic analysis of non-amebelodontine trilophodont gomphotheres, Rhynchotherium and Cuvieronius were recovered as sister-taxa. Among several non-ambiguous synapomorphies, the presence of lower incisors diagnoses this clade. We recognize that the presence of lower incisors in Cuvieronius and Rhynchotherium is an unique case of taxic atavism among the Elephantimorpha, since these structures are lost at the origin of the ingroup. The rediscovery of the lower incisors in Cuvieronius hyodon, their ontogenetic interpretation and the inclusion of this feature in a revised phylogenetic analysis of trilophodont gomphotheres brought a better understanding for the evolutionary history of these proboscideans.

Moreover, for the first time in a formal cladistic analysis of non-amebelodontine trilophodont gomphotheres, Rhynchotherium and Cuvieronius were recovered as sister-taxa. Among several non-ambiguous synapomorphies, the presence of lower incisors diagnoses this clade. We recognize that the presence of lower incisors in Cuvieronius and Rhynchotherium is"
