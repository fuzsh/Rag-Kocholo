I would\n\nrather stay single and carry out\n\nmy ambition.\n\nDo you think it is because I\n\nam so much younger or because\n\nI always want my own way? We\n\ncouldn’t get married yet because\n\ni we haven’t got that kind of mon-\n\ney and, he is afraid we wouldn’t\n\nget along too good as he couldn’t\n\ngive me the nice clothes I like\n\nto buy or a nice home.\n\nHere is something else he does-\n\nn’t like.
