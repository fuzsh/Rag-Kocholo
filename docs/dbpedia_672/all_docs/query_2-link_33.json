        "text": "Ben Shneiderman is a Distinguished University Professor Emeritus in the Department of Computer Science and founding director (1983 to 2000) of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, where he remains a member. He also holds affiliate appointments in the Institute for Systems Research and the College of Information.\n\nShneiderman was elected as as an ACM fellow in 1997 and an AAAS fellow in 2001. He received the ACM SIGCHI Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001.\n\nShneiderman is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He pioneered the highlighted textual link in 1983, and it became part of Hyperties, a precursor to the internet. His move into information visualization spawned Spotfire, known for pharmaceutical drug discovery and genomic data analysis.\n\nShneiderman is a technical advisor for the treemap visualization producer, the Hive Group.\n\nHe is the author of \"Software Psychology: Human Factors in Computer and Information Systems\" (1980) and \"Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction\" (5th ed., 2010, with Catherine Plaisant). He co-authored Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think (1999) with S. Card and J. Mackinlay. His book, \"Leonardo's Laptop: Human Needs and the New Computing Technologies\" (MIT Press), won the IEEE Award for Distinguished Literary Contribution in 2004. His most recent book, \"Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a Connected World (2011),\" was co-authored with D. Hansen and M.A. Smith.\n\nHe received his doctorate in computer science from the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook in 1973."
