        "text": "Exhibition dates: 4th November 2022 – 13th March 2023\n\nCurators: Lesley Harding and Kendrah Morgan\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nSculpture with Colour and Strings\n\n1939/1961\n\nBronze, string\n\n19 x 25 x 18cm\n\nIngram Collection, London, Barbara Hepworth\n\n© Bowness\n\nOut of balance or, how to kill the love for an artist in one easy lesson\n\nI have always had an innate, incendiary love for the work of British artist Barbara Hepworth ever since I first saw her work in books and online, especially the stunning string sculptures full of tensioned negative and positive space. Therefore, I was so excited to visit Heide Museum of Modern Art to see my first Hepworth exhibition in the flesh. The work itself was as superb as I knew it would be, but the installation of it totally ruined my feeling for the art.\n\nUsually when I write about art I follow the maxim if you can’t say anything positive, don’t say anything at all. A good principle to follow. But here I am having to write not about the art but its installation in the gallery spaces which crushed the soul – of the work and of this viewer.\n\nThe salient points are thus:\n\n1/ Stygian gloom in the main gallery, so dark the sculptures were drained of life. Why? They are not going to fade being made of bronze and wood! And the iPhone images in this posting are, as usual, way too bright, about 3 times brighter than it actually was…\n\n2/ Two thirds of the small sculptures were encased in Perspex casting shadows over them which again drained them of any “presence”. Walking around the main gallery I felt like I was all at sea, the Titanic surrounded by sea of floating icebergs, afraid of stepping backwards for fear of knocking into one of the plinths and the sculpture being sunk without trace. There was no room, or light, or “air” to let the sculptures actually breathe…\n\n3/ The small galleries at the end of the main galleries hung with drab, overpowering floor to ceiling curtains. I felt like I was in a cheap multiplex cinema. The sculptures were asymmetrically placed in the spaces so you could not see them in the round there being only a foot or so to walk between the plinth and the curtains. Ridiculous.\n\n4/ And in the second gallery (and this was the worst), poo brown walls which clashed terribly with the work… She lived and worked in St Ives for gods’s sake = light, bright, sea, clouds, energy – not poo brown\n\nThe late Dame Barbara Hepworth was not an average British artist living in St Ives. She never set foot in Australia but her work has surely been murdered here, leaving her rolling in her grave. As an artist friend of mine said on the Art Blart Facebook page: ‘What a missed opportunity’\n\nI sadly concur with that sentiment.\n\nDr Marcus Bunyan\n\nAll installation photographs by Marcus Bunyan.

The first exhibition of her work in Australia, Barbara Hepworth: In Equilibrium brings together more than forty works from prestigious international and national collections, including sculptures in stone, wood, bronze and other metals and a select group of paintings. Introducing Australian audiences to her remarkable oeuvre, the exhibition has been developed in consultation with the Hepworth Estate and has been designed by award-winning architecture firm Studio Bright.\n\nMarried to the painter Ben Nicholson, from 1938 to 1951, Hepworth was a central figure in a network of major international abstract artists and closely linked with the School of Paris. From 1939 she was based in the creative community of St Ives, Cornwall, where she drew much inspiration from the natural environment. An early practitioner of the avant-garde method of direct carving, which dispensed with the tradition of preparatory models or maquettes, she later made large-scale cast and constructed sculptures. Her pioneering practice and technique of piercing the form had an enduring influence on the development of new sculptural vocabularies.\n\nThe exhibition demonstrates the shift in Hepworth’s approach from figurative and naturalistic to increasingly simplified and abstract forms. Though concerned with abstraction, she created work that was predominantly about relationships: between the human figure and the landscape; between forms presented side-by-side; between colour and texture; and between individuals and groups of people.\n\nText from the Heide Museum of Modern Art website\n\nGallery 1 continued…\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nDisc with Strings (Moon) (installation views)\n\n1969\n\nAluminium and string\n\nPrivate collection, Oxford, United Kingdom\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nSculptures with strings wall text\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nOrpheus (Maquette 2) Version II (installation views)\n\n1956, 1959 edition, edition 1/3\n\nBrass and string on wooden base\n\nArt Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney\n\nPurchased 1959\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Barbara Hepworth: In Equilibrium at the Heide Museum of Modern Art, Melbourne showing at front Stringed Figure (Curlew) (Maquette) 1956;

A leading figure of modernist sculpture in Britain in the 20th century, Hepworth is best known for her abstract sculptures and pioneering method of ‘piercing’ the form. Presented at Heide from 5 November 2022 to 13 March 2023, the exhibition Barbara Hepworth: In Equilibrium brings together more than forty works from significant international and national collections, introducing Australian audiences to Hepworth’s enduring oeuvre and remarkable story.\n\nPresented throughout Heide’s main galleries, the exhibition charts the trajectory of Hepworth’s artistic career. From early figurative marble carvings through to large-scale purely abstract forms, the exhibition will feature works on loan from the the collections of Tate Britain, Hepworth Wakefield and the British Council, as well as prominent Australian and New Zealand public collections including the National Gallery of Victoria, Art Gallery of South Australia, Art Gallery of New South Wales, and Te Papa Tongarewa, Museum of New Zealand.\n\nHeide Museum of Modern Art Director Lesley Harding said: “It is with great pleasure that Heide brings together works by one of the most important artists of the 20th century, many never-before-seen here in Australia. The exhibition reflects our commitment to foregrounding modernist women artists, and is the result of extensive research and support from national and international organisations and the Hepworth Estate.”\n\nA key figure of the abstract art movement in Britain, Hepworth’s pioneering practice enriched the language of modern sculpture. While the artist’s early works featured figurative and naturalistic forms, her sculptures would become increasingly simplified and abstract. Highlighted in the exhibition is Hepworth’s significant exploration of the tension between mass and negative space, with sculptures that are ‘pierced’ by large holes. This technique of piercing the form exemplifies Hepworth’s revolutionary contribution to the development of new sculptural vocabularies that influenced not only her contemporaries, but future generations of sculptors.\n\nHeide Museum of Modern Art Head Curator Kendrah Morgan said: “A true pioneer, Barbara Hepworth’s contribution to the evolution of modern art cannot be underestimated. Hepworth’s combination of modernist reductive form and timeless materials produces its own particular magic.”\n\nHeide has enlisted award-winning Melbourne-based architecture practice Studio Bright to design the exhibition, with a focus on connecting the museum’s inside galleries to the surrounding landscape. Central to Hepworth’s practice was the influence of nature, with the artist inspired by the coastal landscape of St Ives in Cornwall, where she lived and worked for much of her career. From the movement of tides to the ancient standing stones of west Cornwall, the artist’s later sculptures are grounded in references to patterns and forms found in nature.\n\nBarbara Hepworth: In Equilibrium brings together more than forty artworks by British artist Barbara Hepworth, in what is a rare chance for Australian audiences to experience a major survey of one of the world’s greatest woman sculptors.\n\nPress release from Heide Museum of Modern Art\n\nGallery two\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Barbara Hepworth: In Equilibrium at the Heide Museum of Modern Art, Melbourne showing at left Sea Form (Porthmeor) 1958; and at right Twin Forms in Echelon 1961\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nSea Form (Porthmeor) (installation views)\n\n1958\n\nBronze on bronze base on wood veneer base\n\nTate, London\n\nPresented by the artist 1967\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nTwin Forms in Echelon (installation views)\n\n1961, edition of 7\n\nBronze\n\nThe State Art Collection, The Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth\n\nPurchased 1979\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nLater Works: Figures in the Landscape wall text\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nForms in Movement (Galliard) (installation view)\n\n1956\n\nCopper and bronze\n\nWairarapa Cultural Collection\n\nAratoi Wairarapa Museum of Art and History, Masterton, New Zealand\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nHead (Ra) (installation views)\n\n1971\n\nBronze on wooden base\n\nArt Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide\n\nGift of Lesley Lynn through the Art Gallery of South Australia Foundation, in memory of her husband Dr Kenneth Lynn 2001\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Barbara Hepworth: In Equilibrium at the Heide Museum of Modern Art, Melbourne showing at centre Twin Forms in Echelon 1961; and at right Maquette (Variation on a Theme) and Figure (Oread) both 1958\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nInstallation views of the exhibition Barbara Hepworth: In Equilibrium at the Heide Museum of Modern Art, Melbourne showing at left Maquette (Variation on a Theme) 1958; and at right Figure (Oread) 1958\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nMaquette (Variation on a Theme) (installation view)\n\n1958\n\nBronze on a wooden base\n\nBritish Council Collection, London\n\nPurchased 1950\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nFigure (Oread) (installation view)\n\n1958\n\nBronze\n\nBritish Council Collection, London\n\nPurchased 1950\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nTwo Figures (Menhirs) (installation views)\n\n1964\n\nSlate on wooden base\n\nTate, London\n\nPurchased 1964\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nInstallation view of the exhibition Barbara Hepworth: In Equilibrium at the Heide Museum of Modern Art, Melbourne showing at left Oval form (Trezion) 1964; and at right Single Form (Chûn Quoit) 1961\n\nPhoto: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nOval form (Trezion) (installation views)\n\n1964\n\nBronze on wooden base\n\nTe Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand, Wellington\n\nPurchased with assistance from the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council of New Zealand, Contemporary Art Society, London, and Lindsay Buick Bequest funds 1964\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nSingle Form (Chûn Quoit) (installation views)\n\n1961\n\nBronze, edition of 7\n\nThe Hepworth Wakefield, Yorkshire\n\nWakefield Council Permanent Art Collection\n\nOn loan from the Hepworth Estate\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nGroup of Three Magic Stones (installation views)\n\n1973\n\nSilver on ebony base\n\nKettle’s Yard, University of Cambridge, Cambridge\n\nBequest of Priaulx Rainier 1986\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975) short biography\n\nBarbara Hepworth, in full Dame Jocelyn Barbara Hepworth, (born January 10, 1903, Wakefield, Yorkshire, England – died May 20, 1975, St. Ives, Cornwall), sculptor whose works were among the earliest abstract sculptures produced in England. Her lyrical forms and feeling for material made her one of the most influential sculptors of the mid-20th century.\n\nFascinated from early childhood with natural forms and textures, Hepworth decided at age 15 to become a sculptor. In 1919 she enrolled in the Leeds School of Art, where she befriended fellow student Henry Moore. Their lifelong friendship and reciprocal influence were important factors in the parallel development of their careers.\n\nHepworth’s earliest works were naturalistic with simplified features. Purely formal elements gradually gained greater importance for her until, by the early 1930s, her sculpture was entirely abstract. Works such as Reclining Figure (1932) resemble rounded biomorphic forms and natural stones; they seem to be the fruit of long weathering instead of the hard work with a chisel they actually represent. In 1933 Hepworth married (her second husband; the first was the sculptor John Skeaping) the English abstract painter Ben Nicholson, under whose influence she began to make severe, geometric pieces with straight edges and immaculate surfaces.\n\nAs Hepworth’s sculpture matured during the late 1930s and ’40s, she concentrated on the problem of the counterplay between mass and space. Pieces such as Wave (1943-1944) became increasingly open, hollowed out, and perforated, so that the interior space is as important as the mass surrounding it. Her practice, increasingly frequent in her mature pieces, of painting the works’ concave interiors further heightened this effect, while she accented and defined the sculptural voids by stretching strings taut across their openings.\n\nDuring the 1950s Hepworth produced an experimental series called Groups, clusters of small anthropomorphic forms in marble so thin that their translucence creates a magical sense of inner life. In the next decade she was commissioned to do a number of sculptures approximately 20 feet (6 metres) high. Among the more successful of her works in this gigantic format is the geometric Four-Square (Walk Through) (1966).\n\n“Barbara Hepworth,” on the Britannica website Last Updated: Jan 6, 2023 [Online] Cited 13/02/2023\n\nDescending walk way\n\nInstallation views of the exhibition Barbara Hepworth: In Equilibrium at the Heide Museum of Modern Art, Melbourne\n\nPhotos: Marcus Bunyan\n\nHeide Museum of Modern Art\n\n7, Templestowe Road\n\nBulleen, Victoria 3105\n\nOpening hours:\n\n(Heide II and Heide III)\n\nTuesday – Sunday 10.00am – 5.00pm\n\nHeide Museum of Modern Art website\n\nLIKE ART BLART ON FACEBOOK\n\nBack to top\n\nExhibition dates: 21st May 2021 – 27th February 2022\n\nBarbara Hepworth (English, 1903-1975)\n\nPierced Hemisphere\n\n1937\n\nWhite marble\n\nThe Hepworth Wakefield (Wakefield Permanent Art Collection)\n\nBarbara Hepworth © Bowness\n\nPhoto: Norman Taylor\n\nAs a bit of a break from photography, something very special this weekend especially for me.

In 1949, she settled down in St Ives, Cornwall, where she stayed until her death. The harmony of the sea, earth and rocks in this remote part of England had a significant impact on her.”\n\n“Barbara Hepworth is one of the most important artists of the 20th century, with a unique artistic vision that demands to be looked at in-depth.

It displays some of Hepworth’s most celebrated sculptures including the modern abstract carving that launched her career in the 1920s and 1930s, her iconic strung sculptures of the 1940s and 1950s, and large scale bronze and carved sculptures from later in her career. Key loans from national public collections are being shown alongside works from private collections that have not been on public display since the 1970s, as well as rarely seen drawings, paintings and fabric designs. It reveals how Hepworth’s wide sphere of interests comprising music, dance, science, space exploration, politics and religion, as well as events in her personal life, influenced her work.\n\nContemporary artists Tacita Dean and Veronica Ryan have been commissioned to create new works which are being presented within the exhibition. Each artist explores themes and ideas that interested Hepworth and that continue to resonate with their own work. Artworks by Bridget Riley from the 1960s are also being presented in dialogue with Hepworth’s work from the same period.\n\nTo coincide with the exhibition, The Hepworth Wakefield’s curator Eleanor Clayton has written a major new biography on the artist, published by Thames & Hudson. Eleanor Clayton said: ‘Barbara Hepworth is one of the most important artists of the 20th century, with a unique artistic vision that demands to be looked at in depth. This exhibition will shine a light on Hepworth’s wide-ranging interests and how they infused her art practice. Deeply spiritual and passionately engaged with political, social and technological debates in the 20th century, Hepworth was obsessed with how the physical encounter with sculpture could impact the viewer and alter their perception of the world.’\n\nSimon Wallis, Director of The Hepworth Wakefield, said: ‘Lockdown continues to be an ongoing challenge for us all, so I’m delighted we’ll be celebrating, post-lockdown, our 10th anniversary with an in-depth exploration of the art and life of Barbara Hepworth, Wakefield’s most famous daughter. With this major exhibition and new book, we’ll continue to build on the legacy and influence of a key pioneer of modern sculpture. Hepworth is a daily inspiration for us at the gallery and we look forward to sharing some of her greatest work with a wide new audience.’\n\nThe exhibition in detail\n\nThe exhibition opens with an introduction to Barbara Hepworth’s work, showing the three sculptural forms she returned to repeatedly throughout her career using a variety of different materials. A detailed look at Hepworth’s childhood in Yorkshire through archive material and photographs includes some of the artist’s earliest- known paintings, carvings and life drawings as she began to explore movement and the human form. A proponent of direct carving, Hepworth combined an acute sensitivity to the organic materials of wood and stone with the development of a radical new abstract language of form.\n\nHepworth’s determination to break free from accepted tradition was enhanced by travelling to Paris in 1932 where she visited the studios of many of the leading European avant-garde artists including Jean Arp, Constantin Brancusi and Pablo Picasso. A large section looks at Hepworth’s development of abstraction in the 1930s including Three Forms (1935) created shortly after she gave birth to triplets, an event she felt invigorated her work towards a bolder language of geometric form. One of the few examples in existence of Hepworth’s first coloured stringed sculptures in plaster, made during World War Two, is being shown alongside the many drawings she created during this period when sculptural materials were scarce. She described these drawings as ‘my sculptures born in the disguise of two dimensions.’\n\nThe exhibition reveals the artist’s creative process, drawing on new research from the recently established Hepworth Research Network (HRN), in collaboration with the Universities of York and Huddersfield, into the ways material factors shaped Hepworth’s sculptures and how they related to her broader conceptual and aesthetic concerns. This includes how starting bronze casting in the 1950s enabled Hepworth to create new forms and how, later in life, she experimented with new materials such as lead crystal and aluminium. On display is The Hepworth Wakefield’s unique collection of 44 surviving prototypes in plaster, aluminium and wood, many of which show the marks of Hepworth’s own hand and tools. These are being shown with a specially commissioned intervention by artist Veronica Ryan, the first artist to undertake a residency in Hepworth’s old studio in St Ives, where the prototypes once stood.\n\nHepworth’s broader interests – such as music, dance, theatre, politics, Greek mythology, and science – influenced her sculptures throughout her life. In the immediate post-war period she became fascinated with the interaction between figures – both in groups in her studio and observed around her, and also in a series of ‘Hospital drawings’, capturing surgeons at work in the early days of the National Health Service. These paintings and drawings capture her belief in the importance of unifying mental and physical existence – the ‘proper coordination between hand and spirit in our daily life’, to create a productive and positive society.\n\nIn 1951 Hepworth met composer Priaulx Rainier, and subsequently made several works inspired by the parallels between musical form and abstract sculpture. This coincided with her first theatrical design, for the 1951 production of Electra at The Old Vic. Archive photographs are being displayed together with Apollo (1951), a metal sculpture that formed part of the stage set, along with costume and set designs for the 1955 opera by Michael Tippett, A Midsummer Marriage, staged in 1955 at the Royal Opera House. This section of the exhibition also explores Hepworth’s passion for dance, and how she captured movement with gestural paintings and sculptures such as Forms in Movement (Galliard) (1956) and Curved Form (Pavan) (1956).\n\nDuring the 1960s, Hepworth was a key cultural figure. She staged major exhibitions, presented work in experimental ways, made large-scale sculptures and explored colour in the patination of bronzes or painted surfaces of her carving. She played an active role in both local and international politics, campaigned for nuclear disarmament and supported pacifist causes. Her political values were encapsulated in the monumental Single Form, commissioned for the United Nations in 1964, of which she declared, ‘The United Nations is our conscience. If it succeeds it is our success. If it fails it is our failure.’ Rare footage of Hepworth’s speaking at the unveiling of this work as been included in the exhibition.\n\nA group of works have been brought together to reveal the influence of the decade of space exploration on Hepworth, from Disc with Strings (Moon) (1969), made the year Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, to Four Hemispheres, inspired by the Telstar satellite. Hepworth noted at the end of the decade, ‘Man’s discovery of flight has radically altered the shape of our sculpture, just as it has altered our thinking.’\n\nThe final section of the exhibition looks at Hepworth’s last years, featuring her experiments with new materials and techniques, which incorporate bold colours and luminescent surfaces, while consistently seeking to use abstract form to express universal human experiences.\n\nBarbara Hepworth is one of the most important artists of the twentieth century, and her organic sculptures have come to exemplify three-dimensional modernist art. Published at a time of increasing interest in her work, this biography moves beyond the traditional narratives of modernism to provide comprehensive insight into Hepworth’s remarkable life, work, and legacy.\n\nPress release from the Hepworth Wakefield website\n\nBarbara Hepworth growing up\n\nc. 1919\n\nCourtesy Bowness\n\nBarbara Hepworth (English, 1903-1975)\n\nMother and Child\n\n1934\n\nPink Ancaster stone\n\nPurchased by Wakefield Corporation in 1951\n\nBarbara Hepworth © Bowness\n\nBarbara Hepworth (English, 1903-1975)\n\nThree Forms\n\n1935\n\nSerravezza marble on marble base\n\n210 × 532 × 343mm, 23 kg\n\nTate.

With such works as Three Forms she reduced her sculpture to the most simple shapes and eradicated almost all colour. She said later that she was ‘absorbed in the relationships in space, in size and texture and weight, as well as the tensions between forms’. While the three elements are slightly imperfect in shape, their sizes and the spaces between them are precisely proportional to each other.

Published at a time of increasing interest in her work, this biography moves beyond the traditional narratives of modernism to provide comprehensive insight into Hepworth’s remarkable life, work, and legacy.\n\nIn her lifetime, Hepworth was reproached for single-mindedness, with critics and commentators framing her work and demeanour as “cool and restrained.” Moreover, most exhibitions of her work in the twentieth century focused on Hepworth’s modernist abstract sculpture of the 1930s and its relation to her male contemporaries, leaving vast swathes of work overlooked, such as her largest and most significant public commission, the sculpture outside the UN building in New York.\n\nThis fully illustrated biography reflects Hepworth’s multifaceted and interdisciplinary approach, shedding new light on her interests in music, dance, poetry, contemporary politics, science, and technology. Author Eleanor Clayton uncovers Hepworth’s engagement with these fields through friends and networks and examines how they show up in Hepworth’s artistic practice, and how the artist synthesised seemingly conflicting disciplines and ideas into one coherent and inspirational philosophy of art and life.\n\nInstallation view of Barbara Hepworth, Orpheus\n\n1956\n\nPhotographed at The Hepworth Wakefield, March 2020\n\nPhoto: Lewis Ronald\n\nBarbara Hepworth (English, 1903-1975)\n\nForms In Movement (Galliard)\n\n1956\n\nCopper\n\n89cm\n\nBarbara Hepworth (English, 1903-1975)\n\nCurved Forms (Pavan)\n\n1956\n\nImpregnated plaster, painted, on an aluminium armature\n\n52 x 80 x 48.5cm\n\nPresented by the artist’s daughters, Rachel Kidd and Sarah Bowness, through the Trustees of the Barbara Hepworth Estate and the Art Fund\n\nBarbara Hepworth © Bowness\n\nPhoto: Mark Heathcote\n\nBarbara Hepworth (English, 1903-1975)\n\nTotem\n\n1960-1962\n\nWakefield Permanent Art Collection\n\nBarbara Hepworth © Bowness\n\nPhoto: Jerry Hardman-Jones\n\nVal Wilmer\n\nBarbara Hepworth in the Palais de la Danse studio, St Ives, at work on the wood carving ‘Hollow Form with White Interior’\n\n1963\n\n© Bowness, Hepworth Estate\n\nBarbara Hepworth at work on the plaster for Oval Form (Trezion)\n\n1963\n\n© Bowness\n\nPhoto: Val Wilmer Barbara Hepworth\n\nBarbara Hepworth with the Gift plaster of Figure for Landscape and a bronze cast of Figure (Archaean)\n\nNovember 1964\n\nBarbara Hepworth © Bowness\n\nPhoto: Lucien Myers\n\nBarbara Hepworth (English, 1903-1975)\n\nGenesis III\n\n1966\n\nBarbara Hepworth © Bowness\n\nPhoto: Jerry Hardman-Jones\n\nBarbara Hepworth (English, 1903-1975)\n\nDisc with Strings (Moon)\n\n1969\n\nFifteen years before Hepworth (1903-1975) made Disc with Strings (Moon), the author William Golding wrote these words:\n\n“Somewhere over the darkened curve of the world the sun and moon were pulling; and the film of water on the earth planet was held, bulging slightly on one side while the solid core turned. The great wave of the tide moved further along the island and the water lifted.”\n\nThough Golding was not writing about the British Isles, his words suggest the kind of large-scale, god-like perspective of earth which mid-century artists like himself and Hepworth were capable of. Disc with Strings (Moon) carries an undertow of planet-sized thinking, and the work is concerned not with reference to human life but, rather, with the fluid, open-ended life of the universe. …\n\nWhen Disc with Strings (Moon) is viewed from the front, the two halves of the concave disc have subtly different colour values. Though the brushed aluminium surface is uniform all over the work, a viewer perceives two different values because the two halves of the sculpture reflect light differently. While the forward-facing half of the disc reflects the light directly into the viewer’s eye, the other canted half reflects light away and therefore appears comparatively darker. When viewed from the other side, the colour values of the two halves are reversed.\n\nThe introduction of string into the sculpture contributes further to this subtle interplay of visual effects. Speaking to the critic Herbert Read in 1952, Hepworth said that “[t]he strings were the tension I felt between myself and the sea, the wind or the hills.” In short, they were a metaphor for her deeply personal response to the elements of nature. In Disc with Strings (Moon), they also seem to register the rippling of waves, passing over the surface of the moon when it appears reflected in the sea.\n\nAnonymous. “InSight No. XII,” on the Piano Nobile website May 13, 2020 [Online] Cited 12/07/2021.\n\nBarbara Hepworth (English, 1903-1975)\n\nFour Hemispheres\n\n1970\n\nGlass lead crystal\n\nBarbara Hepworth (English, 1903-1975)\n\nSun Setting, The Aegean Suite\n\n1971\n\nLithograph on paper\n\nThe Hepworth Wakefield (Wakefield Permanent Art Collection)\n\nBarbara Hepworth © Bowness\n\nBarbara Hepworth (English, 1903-1975)\n\nCone and Sphere\n\n1973\n\nWhite marble\n\nHepworth Estate, on long loan to The Hepworth Wakefield (Wakefield Permanent Art Collection)\n\nBarbara Hepworth © Bowness\n\nPhoto: Mark Heathcote\n\nBarbara Hepworth: Art & Life catalogue cover\n\nThe Hepworth Wakefield\n\nGallery Walk, Wakefield\n\nWest Yorkshire, WF1 5AW\n\nPhone: +44 (0)1924 247360\n\nOpening hours:\n\nTuesday – Sunday 10am – 5pm\n\nThe Hepworth Wakefield website\n\nLIKE ART BLART ON FACEBOOK\n\nBack to top\n\nExhibition dates: 24th June – 25th October 2015\n\nLinbury Galleries\n\nSculptor Barbara Hepworth\n\nA national treasure. An old soul.\n\nMy favourite period of Hepworth’s is the 1940s-1950s, when she found her true voice as an artist. Working with wood, inspired by the landscape, she carved into the space of form / the form of space. She was a master of inner space. The sculptures with string are like harps, they resonate with the energy of life, sea, rock, wind and become … oracles, evidencing some deep inner knowledge. My god, what an artist. Underrated by some but to those that know, a magical voice of becoming.\n\nMarcus\n\nMany thankx to the Tate for allowing me to publish the art works in the posting.

The hollowed-out wood has a spiral formation resembling a shell, a wave or the roll of a hill. Hepworth wanted the taut strings to express ‘the tension I felt between myself and the sea, the wind or the hills’. She moved to Cornwall with her husband Ben Nicholson in 1939, and produced some of her finest sculpture in its wild landscape.\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nOval Sculpture (No. 2)\n\n1943, cast 1958\n\nPlaster on wooden base\n\n293 x 400 x 255mm\n\nTate\n\nPresented by the artist 1967\n\nIn the 1930s Barbara Hepworth and her husband Ben Nicholson were members of the London-based avant-garde. Shortly before the outbreak of war they moved to Cornwall with their children. Running a nursery school and living in cramped conditions reduced Hepworth’s output of sculpture to a minimum. In 1943, the family moved to larger accommodation with studio space. Hepworth’s abstract forms, which seem akin to caves and shells, were affected by the Cornish landscape. Her response to nature was not romantic or mystical but more firmly based on actual observation. Circles and spheres had dominated her work. These were replaced by ovals which gave her sculptures two centres rather than one, complicating their interior form.\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nSculpture with Colour (Deep Blue and Red) (6)\n\n1943\n\n© The Hepworth Estate\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nRed in Tension\n\n1941\n\nPencil and gouache on paper\n\n254 x 355mm\n\nPrivate collection\n\n© Bowness, Hepworth Estate\n\nBarbara Hepworth (British, 1903-1975)\n\nGroup I (Concourse) February 4 1951\n\n1951\n\nSerravezza marble\n\n248 x 505 x 295mm\n\n19 kg\n\nBequeathed by Miss E.M.

Barbara Hepworth (1903-1975) was a leading figure of the international modern art movement in the 1930s, and one of the most successful sculptors in the world during the 1950s and 1960s. This major retrospective opens on 24 June 2015 and will emphasise Hepworth’s often overlooked prominence in the international art world. It will highlight the different contexts and spaces in which Hepworth presented her work, from the studio to the landscape.\n\nThe exhibition will feature over 70 works by Hepworth from major carvings and bronzes to less-familiar works and those by other artists. It opens with Hepworth’s earliest surviving carvings from the 1920s alongside works by predecessors and peers artists from Jacob Epstein to Henry Moore. The selection reveals how her work related to a wider culture of wood and stone carving between the wars when Hepworth studied at Leeds Art School and at the Royal College of Art.\n\nHepworth and her second husband Ben Nicholson made works in dialogue and photographed their studio in Hampstead, London in order to reinforce the idea of a common practice integrated into a way of life. Major carvings like Kneeling Figure, 1932 (rosewood) and Large and Small Form, 1934 (alabaster) will be shown with paintings, prints and drawings by Nicholson, and rarely seen works by Hepworth including textiles, drawings, collages and photograms. Archival photographs will show the two artists and their works in the studio demonstrating their integrated life of art and craft.\n\nIn the later 1930s, Hepworth made more purely abstract work as part of an international movement disseminated through magazines and exhibitions. A display of the majority of Hepworth’s surviving carvings of this period will include Discs in Echelon 1935 (padouk wood) and Single Form 1937 (lignum vitae) which will be seen in conjunction with the journals in which they featured alongside the work of artists such as Alberto Giacometti and Piet Mondrian.\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Hepworth, in St Ives, Cornwall, began making sculptures in wood that expressed her response to her new surroundings. These will be set alongside her two-dimensional work: the abstract works on paper of the early 1940s and her figurative ‘hospital drawings’ of 1947-48, both expressing utopian ideals. A selection of photographs and film will consider the different ways in which Hepworth’s sculpture was presented or imagined – in landscape, in a gallery, in the garden and on stage – and the impact such variant stagings have on the work’s interpretation.\n\nOne room will reunite four large carvings in the sumptuous African hardwood guarea, made in 1954-5, which are probably the highpoint of Hepworth’s carving career. In the post-war period, Hepworth’s sculpture became a prominent part of the international art scene. This will be evoked through a focus on her retrospective at the Kröller-Müller Museum in 1965 and the display of bronzes that inaugurated the Museum’s reconstructed Rietveld Pavilion.\n\nBarbara Hepworth: Sculpture for a Modern World is curated by Penelope Curtis, Director, Tate Britain and Chris Stephens, Lead Curator, Modern British Art and Head of Displays with Assistant Curator Inga Fraser and Sophie Bowness, the artist’s granddaughter. The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue. It will tour to the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo in the Netherlands from November 2015 to April 2016 and to the Arp Museum, Rolandseck in Germany from May to August 2016.\n\nPress release from the Tate Britain website\n\nBarbara Hepworth at Tate Britain\n\nBarbara Hepworth helped to reshape sculpture in post-war Britain, experimenting with abstract forms and piercing holes through her works to play with light and shade. Alastair Sooke takes a look at Tate Britain’s remarkable retrospective which displays magnificent bronzes and intimate, personal carvings.\n\nBarbara Hepworth – Figures in a Landscape (1953) – extract\n\nNarrated by future Poet Laureate Cecil Day Lewis, Figures in a Landscape offers a poetic portrait of sculptor Barbara Hepworth and the otherworldly Cornwall landscapes that inspired her work. Priaulx Rainier’s haunting score beautifully complements the extraordinary works of art, placed in the Cornish spaces that influenced them. Hepworth had been commissioned to design sculptures for the Festival of Britain two years before this film, and remains one of Britain’s most celebrated sculptors – she was made a Dame in 1965. She died during a fire at her St. Ives studio in 1975.\n\n~ Alex Davidson\n\nBarbara Hepworth’s Sculpture Garden | TateShots\n\nBarbara Hepworth first came to live in Cornwall with her husband Ben Nicholson and their young family at the outbreak of war in 1939. She lived and worked in Trewyn studios, now the Hepworth Museum, from 1949 until her death in 1975.\n\nTateShots travelled to St Ives to explore the studio and its gardens, where Hepworth’s sculptures are seen in the environment for which they were created. ‘Finding Trewyn Studio was a sort of magic’, wrote Hepworth; ‘here was a studio, a yard and garden where I could work in open air and space’. The film includes archival footage from an interview with the artist from 1973.\n\nWho is Barbara Hepworth?\n\n3 June 2015\n\nWho is she?\n\nBarbara Hepworth was a British sculptor, who was born in Wakefield, Yorkshire in 1903. She was a leading figure in the international art scene throughout a career spanning five decades.\n\nWho were her peers?\n\nHepworth studied at Leeds school of Art from 1920-1921 alongside fellow Yorkshire-born artist Henry Moore. Both students continued their studies in sculpture at the Royal College of Art in London. Both became leading practitioners of the avant-garde method of Direct Carving (working directly in to the chosen material) avoiding the more traditional process of making preparatory models and maquettes from which a craftsman would produce the finished work.\n\nFrom 1924 Hepworth spent two years in Italy, and in 1925 married her first husband, the artist John Skeaping, in Florence; their marriage was to last until 1931.\n\nFrom 1932, she lived with the painter Ben Nicholson and, for a number of years, the two artists made work in close proximity to each other, developing a way of working that was almost like a collaboration. They spent periods of time travelling throughout Europe, and it was here that Hepworth met Georges Braque and Piet Mondrian, and visited the studios of Picasso, Constantin Brancusi, and Jean Arp and Sophie Taueber-Arp. The experience was a hugely exciting one for Hepworth, for she not only found herself in the studios of some of Europe’s most influential artists, which helped her to approach her own career with renewed vigour and clarity, but also found there mutual respect. The School of Paris had a lasting effect on both Hepworth and Nicholson as they became key figures in an international network of abstract artists.\n\nBy now married and with triplets as well as a son from her first marriage, when war broke out in 1939, Hepworth and Nicholson moved to St Ives. Though she didn’t know it, the seaside town would remain her home for their rest of her life, and after the war she and Nicholson became a hub for a generation of younger emerging British artists such as Peter Lanyon, Roger Hilton and Terry Frost – who was Hepworth’s studio assistant for a time. As she had found, the wild beauty of the surrounding terrain offered a counter to the disruption and destruction of the war. And, like her, those artists made paintings and sculptures inspired by the place and the forces and their experience of nature.\n\nThough concerned with form and abstraction, Hepworth’s art was primarily about relationships: not merely between two forms presented side-by-side, but between the human figure and the landscape, colour and texture, and most importantly between people at an individual and social level.\n\nWhat’s her legacy?\n\nBarbara Hepworth’s name is still intertwined with the history and culture of St Ives and her studio and sculpture Garden remain one of the town’s most popular destinations. In the town where Hepworth was born, as well as housing a rich archive of the artist’s work and serving as a platform for contemporary artists working today, The Hepworth Wakefield also pays lasting homage to an artist who spoke frequently of the effect her surroundings had on her formative years.\n\nThe whole of this Yorkshire background means more to me as the years have passed. I draw on these early experiences not only visually in texture and contour, but humanly. The importance of man in landscape was stressed by the seeming contradiction of the industrial town springing out of the inner beauty of the country.\n\nIn her lifetime, however, she was also a major international figure, showing her work in exhibitions around the globe. As a woman in a largely male-dominated art-world, Hepworth took an active role in the way her work was presented. She was particular about documentation of her works, and collaborated closely with others. She established innovative ways to push the boundaries of her technique and thematic investigations and sustained a career that saw her mount a retrospective at Kröller-Müller Museum in 1965, represent Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1950 and won first prize at the São Paulo Bienal in 1959. She has influenced countless artists, designers, architects and performers such as Linder Sterling, Peter Jensen and Rebecca Warren citing her as an influential figure in their own creative practice.\n\nHepworth is known first and foremost as a sculptor, but she also worked in other mediums – and was very interested in documenting her own work through photography. The landscape around St Ives became part of the way her works were presented in the media; St Ives Bay, Godrevy Lighthouse and The Island all become compositional tools for those documenting her works, creating an additional dialogue between the forms and their surroundings.\n\nFrom 1947-1949, during an illness her daughter suffered, Hepworth produced a series of drawings and paintings based on her time observing doctors and surgeons at St Mary’s hospital in Exeter. Read about their creation in Tate Etc. magazine\n\nWhat do the critics say?\n\nNo militant feminist herself, she asked simply to be treated as a sculptor (never a sculptress), irrespective of sex.\n\n~ Alan Bowness\n\nHepworth was an artist of extraordinary stature whose importance is still to some extent occluded. Over 50 years, from 1925 to her death in 1975, she made more than 600 works of sculpture remarkable in range and emotional force.\n\n~ Fiona McCarthy\n\nIn these works this brave and indefatigable woman transcends the difficulties and ugliness of modern life and evokes a vision of radiant calm perfection.\n\n~ Herbert Read\n\nHepworth in Quotes…\n\n“The sculptor carves because he must. He needs the concrete form of stone and wood for the expression of his idea and experience, and when the idea forms the material is found at once.”\n\n“From the Sculptors point of view one can either be the spectator of the object or the object itself. For a few years I became the object.”\n\n“I think every sculpture must be touched, it’s part of the way you make it and it’s really our first sensibility, it is the sense of feeling, it is first one we have when we’re born. I think every person looking at a sculpture should use his own body. You can’t look at a sculpture if you are going to stand stiff as a ram rod and stare at it, with as sculpture you must walk around it, bend toward it, touch it and walk away from it.”\n\n“I think every person looking at a sculpture should use [their] own body. You can’t look at a sculpture if you’re going to stand stiff as a ramrod and stare at it. With a sculpture you must walk around it [or] bend towards it…”\n\nText from the Tate Britain website.

The plaster was sent to Paris in 1938 for an exhibition and remained there until 1961. In 1963 Hepworth had it cast in an edition of seven. By the mid 1930s Hepworth had turned from carving semi-naturalistic figures and animals to an exploration of pure sculptural forms. She has written that her interest then centred on the relationship between a form and its surrounding space as well as its integral size, texture and weight. But these sculptures almost always retained an organic character.\n\nConstellation of artworks in the Hepworth display\n\nThis constellation forges connections between modern and contemporary works concerned with a sculptural relationship to the artist’s body and to the natural world, revealing a pathway that links geometric abstraction with the surrealist ability to recognise human shapes in natural forms. The phased development of Single Form (Eikon), as it moved through versions in plaster and wood to its final metal incarnation nearly 30 years later, raises questions about the role of sculpture and the importance of materials – concerns that are echoed in the works of Naum Gabo, Marisa Merz and Max Ernst. Louise Bourgeois’ printmaking suite presents a dark vision of biomorphic assimilation and amputation, while the strength and stability of Hepworth’s direct carving method is echoed on an intimate scale by Merz’s knitted nylon works, whose delicate appearance belies their tough industrial materials.\n\nThe geometric abstraction of Hepworth’s monolithic bronze highlights her association with the constructive art championed by Gabo in 1936, which focused on the universal nature of pure forms. She also had connections to the surrealist movement. With its phallic quality and contrasting purified aesthetic, the cast bronze sculpture can relate to both of these important movements; like other works in the constellation powerfully oscillating between abstraction and figuration.\n\nIn a strong statement on her own artistic philosophy, Hepworth proclaimed: ‘I think every person looking at a sculpture should use his own body. You can’t look at a sculpture if you are going to stand stiff as a ram rod and stare at it, with a sculpture you must walk around it, bend toward it, touch it and walk away from it.’ This invitation to engage in a bodily experience of sculpture shares its premise with Bruce Nauman’s cast plaster and fibreglass work, Isa Genzken’s totemic concrete monuments, and Daria Martin’s film In the Palace, which dramatically enlarges to architectural scale an iconic Giacometti sculpture, enabling performers to inhabit its time and space, in an uncanny fusing of materials and people.\n\nText from the Tate Britain website.
