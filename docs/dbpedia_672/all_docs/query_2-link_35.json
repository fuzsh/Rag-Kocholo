        "text": "I am long overdue on this post. A few weeks ago I attended a virtual panel “The Journey to Staff Engineer in Big Tech”, hosted by Taro’s Rahul Pandey, presenting Lee McKeeman, Ryan Peterman, Carly Taylor, M.Sc., and Zach Wilson. I am extremely grateful to have had an hour of this high-caliber cast's time, worth a whole lot more than $0 (staff SWEs can make north of 600k). Below are some of the invaluable insights I gained: 👉 The panel’s diversity of professional background was refreshing. For example, Lee worked for a very long time at small companies, starting his big tech journey much later than Ryan, who did so straight out of college. The one shared characteristic of this diverse panel’s abilities, however, and the one thing that seems to be the focal point of reaching the staff level and beyond, is impact. One’s ability to make a real, tangible impact through their work is paramount. It’s the reason a company invests so much money in you. 👉 In university, the \"grindset false dichotomy\" plagued computer science: you’re either a hyper-competent coder who can pick up a new framework by reading all its docs in two days, or you don’t have a future as a SWE. This is NOT staff level software engineering. An example of this that really spoke to me was given by Ryan. When building a solution for Instagram that cut costs by 94%, what mattered most was convincing others of its viability and leading its execution. This juxtaposition of technical prowess with soft skills like leadership and communication is what set Ryan up for staff. 👉 Future staff engineers are opinionated. They are active in discerning what the right approach to a problem is, and they are loyal to their findings. An engineer's seniors always have things on their plate, and having an opinion will often assist them speed up decision-making, which can go a surprisingly long way. And it is worth being wrong over being opinionless. If you are wrong, the idea will usually fail fast when exposed to others and tested; if you are right, then Houston, we have impact. Everyone has some degree of influence, and taking full advantage of that will be integral to reaching staff level. 👉 The right place at the right time is a big constituent of the impact that causes promotion. A great example: in junior days, Carly was in a particular meeting, and was called on to present some technical to details to an audience of non-technical stakeholders. Her success in this ended up getting her a call from one of the stakeholders, and promoted to staff. To me, the most important part of this was that Carly was prepared; luck = preparation + opportunity. All in all, this panel made one thing loud and clear: becoming staff is more of a mindset shift than it is having a hard skill set. This was eye-opening, and cleared up misconceptions I had. I hope my readers can benefit from this summary; a recording of the event is available here: https://shorturl.at/ctEZ6 #tech #techcommunity #softwareengineering\n\n\"So... what do you do?\" 🤔 We've all been hit with that question, whether it's at networking events, social gatherings, or even in an elevator ride with a potential connection.

Today marks my 1 year Googleversary! 🥳🥳 It seems only yesterday I received the famous noogler hat and was flown out to Atlanta for orientation, yet a whole year has passed since I’ve been at Google! To celebrate I want to share some things I learned during my first year in the workforce: ☀️ You might feel totally lost — and that’s okay During my first rotation I spent the first few weeks just learning different acronyms and understanding what my team even did. I found that this is very common despite your experience because every team functions differently. It’s okay to ask questions. Once it clicks, you’ll be amazed at how much you’ve learned! ☀️ Foster your curiosity — explore all aspects of your industry and invest in growing your skillsets I studied finance and accounting in school, however during my rotational program I have been on two different teams within finance that have allowed me to pick up both technical and soft skills along the way. During the first year at any role I recommend you focus on learning as much as you can and use every resource available. This is the time to explore new areas and find what you enjoy or what is most challenging and you’d like to improve on. ☀️ Have fun! Go to events that your workplace might be hosting and join different groups that seem interesting. Some of my fondest memories are filled with just fun things I did, like taking some time to join a bookclub challenge, attend cooking classes during cultural celebrations or volunteering with my team. It’s a great way to connect with so many people in a casual setting and really get to know their journey and story. Plus often the events are really fun and have great food! The first year flies by so make sure to take the time to really soak it in! And that’s all! I look forward to the next googleversary 😇 and hope these tips help! #firstyearanniversary #workanniversary #googleanniversary #googleversary #firstgen #latinaintech #google #financialanalyst\n\n\"One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it\" - Master Oogway Until my 5th semester, I was convinced a tech career wasn't for me. Coding was not my cup of tea, and I was learning image editing, I even started making YouTube tutorials. (I love to share what I know) But In my 6th semester, Responsibilities hit, & getting a job became a priority. I realised I’d be wasting my potential if I didn’t try. I started preparing and this quote perfectly describes my preparation phase \"I quit every goddamn day, I just never said it out loud.\" - Harvey Specter Slowly and gradually, I started understanding things and kept going, still going cause in IT the learning never stops (This challenges me even more) And this journey just took an incredible turn. I'm happy to announce that I'm officially a Software Engineer at Google. Here's to new beginnings, accepting the unexpected & the power of dedication! Also, I would like to thank my recruiters Saranya M and E. S. for giving me this wonderful opportunity and helping me throughout the process. #Noogler #Google #SoftwareEngineer\n\n🚀 A Journey of Triumph: From Tier-3 College to Google 🚀 Last night, I had the honor of attending an event that left an indelible mark on my heart and soul. Titled \"From Tier-3 College to Google: Unveiling Mohit's Inspiring Journey,\" hosted by SoarX, it was an evening filled with awe-inspiring stories, resilience, and the celebration of human potential. Mohit's journey from a Tier-3 college to the hallowed halls of Google was not just a tale of professional success, but a testament to the power of dreams, determination, and unwavering perseverance. As he took the stage, Mohit exuded a quiet confidence, his eyes reflecting the fire of a thousand dreams ignited within him. With each word he spoke, Mohit peeled back the layers of his past, revealing the challenges and obstacles he faced on his path to success. From battling imposter syndrome to navigating the complexities of a competitive industry, he confronted every setback with courage and resilience. His journey was a testament to the fact that where you start does not dictate where you end up. But what truly moved me was not just Mohit's individual triumph, but the humility with which he shared his story. He spoke of mentors who believed in him when he doubted himself, of friends who lifted him up in moments of despair, and of the unwavering support of his family. Mohit's journey was a reminder that success is not a solitary journey, but a collective effort fueled by the support and encouragement of those around us. As Mohit concluded his speech to thunderous applause, I found myself filled with a sense of hope and possibility. His journey was not just an inspiration, but a call to action for each one of us to dream big, work hard, and never lose sight of our potential. I left the event with a renewed sense of purpose, grateful for the opportunity to witness Mohit's journey unfold before my eyes. Thank you, SoarX, for creating a platform where stories like Mohit's can be shared and celebrated. Here's to embracing our dreams, overcoming our obstacles, and soaring to new heights of success. 🌟 #SoarWithMohit #Inspiration #DreamBig #GiveMyCertificate #community #TechTalk #CareerJourney #Google #Inspiration #ProfessionalDevelopment #SoarX"
