        "text": "Well Kids, I finally finished it! After two and a half months, I have finished my annual Memorial Collage to remember the notable celebrities and news-makers we lost in 2023. As you can see from time stamp in the bottom right corner of the above image, I ‘finished’ the original collage on January 29th. But then as I suspected would happen in my most recent post, I found at least a dozen celebrities I missed, and then I had to add them all into the original, and re-factor into the black and white key. Then I had to re-outline and renumber each image (multiple times when several were missed or accidentally double numbered!). Anyway I can safely say that the collage is well and FULLY complete! Whew!!!\n\nEvery year when I make this, I realize how much I love human faces — so I posted the best picture of each person I could find, (and sometimes more than one depending on their brilliance!)\n\nSome of these people I’ve never heard of, as I’m sure you haven’t also. And there is great pleasure in the learning of these diverse lives. I felt I got to know a lot of these talented people through their biographies. Many lived to be centenarians, and into their 90s. Far too many (as it seems every year) died tragically and too soon; but their light did shine as they lived.\n\nAlthough they have all passed, it is only fair to rediscover them and their legacies. That’s one reason I make these tributes every year; for so many are easily forgotten although they might have been very well known in their time.\n\nMay you find as much joy and inspiration as I have in discovering all these talents. Let me know what you think, and thanks for you patience.\n\nLove survives, Therese\n\nThe KEY below is in Black and White with sections in colored numbers determined by occupation:\n\nGREEN is Athletics, BRIGHT BLUE is Actors and Entertainers I, NAVY BLUE is Actors and Entertainers II, RED is Musicians, YELLOW is News-makers, and PURPLE are the many performers who fall into the STAR TREK FAMILY.

I pray you will have a very happy and healthy new year, and you are all always in my thoughts and prayers!\n\nNot much new with me, although it appears my old desktop computer is giving up the ghost and I will probably be getting a new one or a laptop to replace it! I hope we get this resolved soon, but in the meantime, I just wanted to check in on you!\n\nI have begun my annual Memorial collage for the year, recalling all the newsmakers we lost last year, will probably have that up in a couple of weeks, new computer pending. (I don’t want to save too many images to my current computer without back up or it could be lost!)\n\nI’ve started a new hobby since December! I’m learning how to sculpt Plasticine clay as inspired by Ace of Clay on YouTube. I got some lovely clay modelling tools from my son this Christmas, and I have several ideas which I hope I can execute in time for a display I’ll have up at my local library in June!! In that display I will also include many of my silly collages and some of my photography. I can’t wait!\n\nIn the real world, I am enjoying being a substitute teacher, although I’ll be holding off for a while until the seasonal ailments (flu,covid,RSV, and pneumonia) ease off. I’ll be getting my last vaccination this week to help stave off any illnesses. I strongly urge you to get your vaccines too, and wear a mask in public. Just common sense!\n\n(Spoiler: political commentary, feel free to skip to next paragraph after)\n\nI know this will be a big year for our nation (USA) and the world, and I pray we can achieve stability and peace world-wide. Suffice to say (and you’re welcome to disagree) I DO NOT want Donald Trump back in the White House. He is a danger to our fragile democracy and I have no doubt that a new Trump Administration will become a Trump Autocracy or worse (dictatorship). His cruelty, misogyny, devotion to ‘strong man’ types (Putin, Jong -Un, JinPing and Orban,) is a clear enough indication of his intentions. (see Project 2025) One cannot be a dictator “for one day” and he knows we all know this. But he will continue to charm those who hate all the people he hates, and encourage violence. He will tear families apart again, crush civil rights, and degrade women further while aiding and abetting fellow Authoritarians and Dictators. This is not the America I believe in. I will rejoice the day that we never have to hear of him again. Fine if you disagree. FYI, most immigrants are NOT after YOUR job, unless you want to pick produce in poor conditions, clean toilets, haul trash, or care for the elderly. They take all the jobs that ‘good Americans’ don’t want. And if they can rise above menial labor into decent livable wage positions, it is well deserved! America was built on immigration and most of us are descendants of Immigrants. One must be really desperate in their own country (especially the southern border) to risk death coming here. To shuffle them around like cattle is inhumane. Enough said.\n\nOn lighter topics, I look forward to the next seasons of Lower Decks and Strange New Worlds. And the final (wah!) season of Discovery — hey it wasn’t that bad!! I want to spend more time organizing, getting rid of stuff, spending less, saving more, creating, and losing the elusive weight in my never ending battle.\n\nAs The Keeper says, “May you find your way as pleasant.”\n\nHi Everyone!\n\nI was lucky to attend a wonderful event in October! Adam Nimoy (son of Leonard) appeared at the Olav Shalom Synagogue in Albany NY to discuss the Jewish Connections to Star Trek. Not only did Adam find connections to Judaism through Trek, but also gave a preview of his next book that will be out in January.\n\nAdam was delightfully laid back and his presentation was insightful and humorous as well as reflecting on life with his father; their faith, struggles and joys. While reading passages from his book manuscript, he corrected some last minute typos to our delight. “It’s okay,” he said “it’s not out until January!”\n\nHe also expressed his wishes for peace in Israel/Gaza and all the war-zones around the world. Amen to that.\n\nBefore the talk, there was a delicious brunch with egg and tuna salads, green salad, yogurt with fresh fruit, lots of desserts, and of course, bagels-I had my first lox ever!\n\nAdam gave a list of the 10 episodes he found that suggested the influences of his Jewish faith. Of course there is the Vulcan Greeting, “Live Long and Prosper” and its v-formation based on the Hebrew letter Shin, and it being the first letter in the Hebrew word for Peace, which is “Shalom”. Alas, I should have taken notes, so I can only give a taste of Adam’s comparisons! (Sorry!) I was mostly just enjoying the moment, and it was wonderful.\n\nHere’s some examples; Moses wandering in the dessert was like Captain Kirk and his crew wandering throughout the galaxy. He also made references to Metamorphosis (The Companion as a caring god figure) and Journey to Babel (Nations struggling to reach a common peaceful goal) His favorite episode of TOS was The Menagerie, as he loved that it incorporated his father’s first appearance as Spock into a two-episode arc.\n\nAnd on a personal level, he also cited the story of Jonah and the Whale as it related to his own struggle with pot addiction, and finally being saved. This was very moving. I would add my own example here, the (New Testament) tale of The Prodigal Son in a way reflected the time between Adam and his father when their relationship was strained for a time, and not being in each other’s lives. Yet in time, and thankfully a good length time before Leonard was struck with COPD, he and Adam had reunited in love and a much better, closer father-son relationship, to the end of Leonard’s days.\n\n(I noted that Adam’s talk was being recorded, so I’m hoping that if it is put on line, I’ll be able to share it with you!)\n\nMy friend Bobbie* and I attended this event together, and we both had the chance to meet and greet Adam and have our picture taken with him. (Yay!) Bobbie (who is her town historian) is working very hard on a project to get a commemorative USPS stamp of Leonard in time for the 10th year anniversary of his passing in 2015. (She was active in having the stamp of Edmonia Lewis made for the USPS Black Heritage stamp series most recently). Bobbie showed Adam her thick file, filled with all her work to date in her stamp proposal, with recommendations of insights to Leonard’s patriotism, philanthropy and how his character of Spock is a true American icon, with his brave and caring discipline. Adam said “You know more about my Dad than I know!” Here’s hoping Bobbie succeeds!\n\nI gave Adam a 500 piece puzzle I had made up of the 90th birthday tribute to his Dad. He was surprised and intrigued by the intricate collage I made of his fathers life, and enjoyed seeing even tiny pictures of himself and his sister Julie contained within! I hope he and his family will enjoy the puzzle over the holidays!\n\nBobbie and I both got our pictures taken with him, and we each couldn’t resist throwing in a hug! What a fine mensch! Adam, if you’re reading this, Thank you again, and it was a pleasure!\n\nNOTE: To see the pictures I took from this event, please check out my Instagram page. (I am using my Instagram account here now for my default images since I ran out of room for images here when I returned to my original membership with WordPress)\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/therese.bohn/\n\n*whom I first met when I went to see Leonard Nimoy in NYC 10 years ago\n\nUPDATE: I found the book I referenced in the paragraph A Fashionable Choice, and added the picture too!\n\nThis past weekend, on July 1, the late Princess of Wales, the former Diana Spencer would have turned 62.\n\nI was also born in 1961, and felt a natural affinity toward Diana, perhaps because we were the same age. When she became engaged, I was so excited! After all, there hadn’t been a Princess of Wales in decades. I had not been following the British Royal Family much at all until Diana came on the scene. But she represented all the youthful energy and ambition of my generation, which was probably why she was and still is so loved by so many of her peers, even now. She’d surely bring color to the gray world of royalty.\n\nInfluenced by my older siblings, I had always been an Anglophile. I had cut my teeth on The Beatles, Monty Python, and catching the latest BBC historical melodrama via Masterpiece Theater. The music, movies and assorted Brit celebrities made a romantic impression on me at the time, and I imagined how wonderful a place it was and how I would love to see the real thing. Having this striking young princess enter into that world was the cherry on top of my Anglo-fantasies.\n\nUnlike the other royals, Diana had a natural likeability and a genuine kindness to her that we in the real world could relate to. She hugged children and laughed with ease with her fans. I eagerly followed every word and latest fashion, becoming a mimic fashionista of sorts (ruffled collars and white tights anyone?). I would have loved to have been her friend; a sentiment I’m sure thousands of other young women had as well. Every new fashion was a power statement, since she rarely spoke in public. (I still have scrapbooks)\n\nYet there was always an undercurrent of friction between Diana and her new husband. I was thrilled to see any pictures of them stealing a kiss at a polo match, or occasional loving glance. How wonderful to see their love evolve into a beautiful family of two little boys. But after the birth of Harry, a clear chill was seeping into their castle windows. Charles was becoming more distant, spending more time with his older country friends, Diana on the town with her her own set, shopping and lunches, yet happiest with her beloved boys.\n\nBy the time their separation became public, I found myself agreeing with the commentator who pointed out that “a lot of dreams will die here” (for those who believed the illusion). I was always on Team Diana, of course, although I know she wasn’t perfect. In real life she may not have been the brightest or deepest of them all. But with her initial naivete, anxiety, depressions and occasional paranoia that were all but ignored by The Firm, I identified with that, and I felt for her. In my mind the British Royal family really took advantage of a very impressionable young woman barely out of teens. She fell as hard for the fantasy as we all did, and she tragically paid for it.\n\nWhen she was free of the family, yet cruelly, unceremoniously stripped of her title, I had hoped that she would find solace in a relatively peaceful post-royal life. Rumor had it that she was going to move to America, and possibly becoming an ambassador the the United Nations, which would have been perfect for her. Yet we all know how her story ended much too soon, just as her life was starting to become more emotionally and psychologically satisfying. Alas.\n\nPeople still speculate about her tragic death. Conspiracies still pop our from time to time. To me it was just a terribly awful accident. My only questions was this: Was her safety belt in working condition? Diana was known to always use her safety belt, and her death could have been prevented it only she wore hers that night. Too much water under the bridge to consider it now. If only, though.\n\nIt has been said that one of the last things Diana confided to a friend was a promise never to be fulfilled. “You won’t believe what’s coming next!” she cheekily hinted. Over a quarter of century since her passing we still haven’t a clue what she had in mind. My three speculations:\n\n1) A Choice for Love: Would she have announced that she was to re-marry? Not Dodi-Al-Fayed, her fateful fling, but Dr. Haznat Khan, the heart surgeon who was the true love of her life? This has been a theory visited since her death. Some have claimed that she wanted to marry a Muslim, which would have surely made The Firm very uncomfortable. I honestly don’t think this would have happened so soon after her divorce.\n\n2) A Fashionable Choice: Many Charity related books about Diana’s style came out after her death. One was Diana: The Secrets of her Style by Diane Clehane. It featured a sketch of a very daring gown for her next evening event, an AIDS Benefit, designed by Giorgio Armani. Diana was to have her final fitting for it the week she passed. The gown appears to be an icy blue halter gown with V-neck down to the waist and a twisted back. As you can see, it was very daring, and would have been stunning on her. Was this the coming surprise she hinted at? Since Diana let a lot of her clothes do the talking, this might have been likely, and probably quite startling. This would have been the biggest ‘Get Lost’ dress to the Royal Family she would have worn to date. And she would have been not only breath-taking, but ahead of her time, as usual.\n\n3) A Choice to Leave: Or was she indeed going to dump the Royal Family and move to the States? We may never know. I’d like to think she’d have moved. Perfectly understandable after the hell that all the tabloids put her through. And that now she’d be a happy grandma and best friends to her daughters-in-law.\n\nIt’s funny, I’ve always had some sort of fandom through my life. In the 60’s it was The Beatles, the 70’s Star Trek, the 80’s, Princess Diana. Yet since the 1990 on, my life has revolved around my own reality in my creative and family life. How I wish Diana could have been as happy with her family as I have been blessed with my own husband and two sons these past 30 years.\n\nI watched the Coronation the other month. It was grand and colorful, everything one has come to expect from the British Royal Family. My feelings toward “The Firm” has changed drastically over the years. I think that if the Family wants to continue to carry on for the future, they should run themselves like many other Royal families, that is, stay figureheads, but SUPPORT THEMSELVES. (and for heaven’s sake, pay back the British taxpayers the millions of pounds they paid for the Coronation). Yet the current adventures of the family of Charles III will never enthrall me the way Diana did. I wish Diana’s sons well. Diana’s long gone, but never forgotten. As Captain Kirk said in That Which Survives:\n\n“Beauty Survives”\n\nThe other night I had a moment to watch a little TV, and thought I’d find a movie. Paramount+ had a list of movies leaving at the end of August, and among them was Star Trek: The Motion Picture. I hadn’t seen it in so long I figured it was a good time.\n\nAfter years of easily dismissing it I was surprised and delighted to realize that I not only did I like this movie, but LOVED it! Quite a difference from my initial viewing 43(!) years ago.\n\nIn December of 1979, I was among the hundreds locally who came out to see it on its first night. Comparing what I saw that premiere night, and what I just watched the other night were of two different people in two realities. How the first Star Trek movie would be reacted to was somehow very personal to me. When I came out of the theater that night, I was happily saying to people in line “It’s great!”. But inside I was not too pleased, an opinion that regrettably stayed with me all these years, to the point of never wanting to see it again.\n\nYou see, through my then 18-year old’s eyes, this movie was going to be my redemption, my “I told you so!” to all the people who mocked me for my Trek devotion the whole past decade. But my concern about how non-Trekkies would take it was almost central to my enjoyment of the film. Seeing that attitude now, I admit with slight embarrassment that I was WAY too concerned with physical elements of the movie, than the actual plot. Kind of like not seeing the forest for the trees. My ‘trees’ here were things like:\n\nThe Klingons are bumpy!!\n\nOh, God, is everyone going to like it?\n\nThat’s a bad wig, Spock!\n\nOh, God, the actors look so old!\n\nWhy are those uniforms so bland and awful? Where has all the color gone?\n\nWhy is the dialogue so soft while the music and sound effects are SO LOUD?\n\nWhy is the intro to the Enterprise taking s-o-o-o-o lo-o-o-o-o-ng?\n\nWhy is Spock so wooden?\n\nWhy did Ilia have to be bald?\n\nAre Ilia and Decker going to take over the Enterprise?\n\nWhat’s up with Scotty’s mustache?\n\nMy 61 year old brain can answer all that now …\n\nThe Klingons are what Gene wanted them to be.\n\nMaybe not at the moment, but in time it will age better.\n\nYes, he needed a better long hair wig, but that’s a minor point.\n\nWow, they all look so YOUNG here!!\n\nWell, the uniforms were what they were. very 70’s. Fortunately they were all recycled into a better look in the sequels.\n\nThis was mostly the fault of the poor audio equipment at the theater I watched it at. I remember many people calling out “Turn it up!!”\n\nThe Enterprise intro is a big ‘Welcome back you beautiful ship’ presentation. Still a tad longer than it needed to be, but I get it. That’s what fast forward is for; the same for the long slide into V’Ger’s realm.\n\nHe did seem unnaturally stiff before his space walk, but I understand now that Spock’s search for total logic was turning him inward.\n\nAfter years of seeing new aliens, Ilia’s lack of hair really was no big deal, (and dear Persis was so gorgeous).\n\nOf Course Not!!\n\nIt’s the 70’s, man!\n\nI was too ‘stressed’ with these ‘pressing’ concerns to appreciate the beauty of a story I had been waiting for10 years to culminate into reality! Seeing it now, although I still think it needed better editing to move it along more quickly, I appreciate it so much more. My impressions follow.\n\nFirst of all, this was a beautifully remastered director’s cut of the piece. As your eyes delve into a field of stars, it begins with the graceful and sad, yet soaring overture of Ilia’s Theme by Jerry Goldsmith. Ilia’s theme grew a whole new meaning for me since I had last watched this movie, It really stresses a deep longing, the almost unbearable yearning to find something more that must be out there.\n\nI felt compassion for Ilia this time too instead of seeing her as an ‘other’ or just sexy window dressing. Ilia is tragic because she is swept into the vortex of V’ger before she barely serves on the Enterprise. The small blinks of her real self that flicker from the shell of her V’ger persona are almost heartbreaking. “Deck-Er!” she voices in familiarity as she touches his face. So close yet so far.\n\nSpock too is torn. Feeling a call from V-Ger, he is drawn back to the Enterprise. He cannot focus solely on his devotion to total logic. As he has failed the Ko-li-nahr to rid himself of emotion, so he is now determined to figure out the mystery of V-Ger, even at the risk of his own life to save his fellow crew members. This is a theme that carries through to the sad conclusion of The Wrath of Kahn. After his harrowing space walk into V’Ger, Spock rediscovers and embraces his humanity. The small chuckle he gives recovering in sickbay brings us back to the Spock we knew was still there.\n\nAt it’s core, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is very much true to the formula of the original series; set in outer space, but finding ourselves through personal conflict. It is not heavy on action, but it has suspense, which is always favorable, to me at least.\n\nTechnically, it was a marvel at the time, and a joy to see the Enterprise stream into warp drive with it’s strobe-rainbow effect. The new Enterprise was beautiful sleek upgrade to the original. Remember this was still a model-driven special effect department, and CGI was still in its infancy. The Klingon ship was ruggedly detailed and far more 3-D than ever before. Spock’s voyage into V’Ger and the steep stair set surrounding V’ger were remarkable, although I was concerned that these ‘ancient’ actors at the time would trip and fall!\n\nCostume-wise were hits and misses. The variety of duty uniforms still didn’t make much sense to me. The beige/gold, pale blue/gray palate was probably considered quite futuristic at the time, al though they still had more of a 70’s Space 1999 vibe at the time. But their blandness made the actors blend in more with the cooler tones of the New Enterprise. Thankfully, Khan brought back more color and a less leisure suit look back to the series* and Star Trek: TNG brought back the classic gold/blue/red department shades. Also, the laughable, sporty, short sleeved uniforms here were so terribly preppy before preppy became a thing in the early 80’s. What, were these the Sunday leisure uniforms? They still make me laugh, and for heaven’s sake, grown men should never wear Penguin Suits and Onesies! (TMI! TMI!)\n\nThank heaven we had two glorious and elegant costume moments — Spock’s first entry on the bridge in a luxurious black cape and stove-pipe trousers, and Ilia’s white mini-robe with salmon pink stand up collar.\n\nAll I can say now , is that if you haven’t seen it in a long time, you might just enjoy it as much as i did. It is still a LOT better than Shatner’s ego-fest of Star Trek V!\n\nAnd now All 6 Original STAR TREK Films Beam Down on 4K Blu-ray in September, Plus TMP Director’s Edition & Special Longer Version • TrekCore.com\n\n*The reason for the red and black uniforms of STII was budgetary — the ST:TMP uniforms had to be recycled and the only colors they could be dyed were deep red and black!\n\n(*As I imagine them!)\n\nHave you ever wondered who married Spock?\n\nNote: I write this without any knowledge of Star Trek fan-fiction or any of the official published fiction or comics of the franchise. The following is purely my fertile imaginings.\n\nIn the Star Trek:TNG episode Sarek, Captain Picard mentions that he met Sarek at “his son’s wedding”. But we never know when that wedding was or to whom Spock was married. This opens up a host of possibilities.\n\nI thought, well, who would Spock have married in Picard’s time? Could it be possible that Picard wasn’t referring Spock at all but Sarek’s other son Sybok? Nope. Sybok was already dead in the time of TNG. It couldn’t have been anyone he had known during his time in Starfleet; they would all be deceased by the time Picard was around (save for McCoy) Yet this fact does not rule out that Spock may have married once or more in his many decades before Picard.\n\nSo how many weddings did Spock have? Let’s just say that if Kirk was the Casanova of Starfleet Romances, Spock was the Henry the Eighth of Starfleet Weddings! On to the ceremonies, and may you never mistake the following for canon!\n\nWedding #1 T’Pring — Again!\n\nIn the fourth year of the Enterprise’s voyage, Spock received word that his unconquered rival for T’Pring, Stonn, had died unexpectedly while rock climbing on Capella IV. According to Vulcan tradition, because Spock had survived the Kalifee, he was expected to marry T’Pring as originally planned. Spock agreed, to bring honor to T’Pring and her family and they were married by T’Pau. Jim Kirk was best man, happy that this time it didn’t mean a battle to the death! He didn’t dare kiss the bride, although he did squeeze in an incredibly intense hug! Yet seventy-seven days later, it was revealed that Stonn had not died while rock climbing on Capella IV, but had instead been in clandestine meetings with lawyer Samuel Cogley to arrange a divorce from T’Pring. You see, Stonn had realized not long after his marriage that Spock was right; how “having (was) not so pleasing a thing, after all, as wanting.” T’Pau had their marriage annulled immediately. Spock went back to the Enterprise, much to the delight of the crew. (Especially several potential prospects…) T’Pring later had a brief fling with Captain Kirk, just to see how her chosen rival would have been, but she never spoke of it again.\n\nWedding #2 Christine in the Sistine\n\nSo, when Spock came back to the Enterprise, no one was more thrilled than Nurse Christine Chapel, who had pined for him for ages. With T’Pring out of the way, she managed to convince Spock that their forced kiss on Platonious wasn’t so bad and that it was surely “illogical to protest against our natures”. With the five-year mission ending, Spock succumbed to the logic of the situation, not to mention Christine’s excellent spicy plomeek soup. They took their vows within days after the Enterprise‘s last mission. Logically, Christine Chapel married Spock in the Sistine Chapel, and the good nurse chose green as an accent color, to compliment her husband’s T-Negative blood. Jim Kirk was best man again, feeling some relief that Spock was off the market, if a bit green with envy. (How did Spock land the most beautiful blond on the ship?) Kirk kissed the bride, and almost the groom too, but quickly backed off.\n\nAlas, this union too did not last. The good nurse loved her Vulcan, she really did. But his incessant Vulcan-splaining on every. aspect. of her illogical humanity even wore her down in time. Two years was enough, the divorce was uncontested, and they remained friends. “You can never stop loving someone like Spock” she said, “Our time together will always warm my heart.” She went back Starfleet and became a full-time doctor. She had a fling with Captain Kirk, but later married Dr. McCoy. She’d still send Spock Plomeek Soup every Christmas.\n\nWedding #3 Back to Paradise?\n\nAlthough Spock’s divorce from Christine was a disappointment, he was thankful for Jim Kirk and his other friends through Starfleet who kept in touch. Spock took a five year leave from Starfleet, delighting his father by becoming a professor at the Vulcan Science Academy. Surprisingly, three years into his tenure, his former lover, Leila Kalomi became an fellow professor there, specializing in Botany. After a failed tryst with Elias Sandoval, Leila took the job on Vulcan knowing through Starfleet gossip of Spock’s two marriages. With love for Spock still in her heart for over a decade and their brief, requited romance on Omicron Ceti III still burning in her memory, she convinced him that the third time would be the charm.\n\nThey married two months later on that same planet, in a sentimental wedding ceremony where Spock swung from a tree years earlier. The bride wore creamy lace, with a deactivated bouquet of spore buds. Jim Kirk was again the best man, and he couldn’t wait to kiss the bride. Hmm.\n\nBut then, nearly a year into the marriage, Leila also found out that having was a somewhat less pleasing thing than wanting, for Spock without spores was far less cuddly than Spock with spores. He could spend hours, even days away with his intensive work projects, often working into the weekends. Leila’s loneliness was becoming unbearable, and Pon Farr was still two years away.\n\nAt a Starfleet Conference, she found herself entertained by Captain Kirk, who sang an intense, staccato karaoke version of “Layla” to her at an after party. Maybe it was the Saurian Brandy, maybe it was her increasing isolation from Spock, but rock n’ roll history repeated itself, and she found herself taken in by Starfleet’s hammy Lothario. Wracked with guilt, she told Spock all about the affair as soon as she got back, asking forgiveness but also tearfully suggesting that they divorce. Spock responded:\n\n“Considering the Captain’s proclivity for love addiction, I am not surprised that he seduced you. Your actions were logical, as I am aware that I have been physically neglectful to you. Leila, I need not forgive you.” His eyes lowered. “I hope you can forgive me. I understand your need to be free.” He touched her cheek. “There are times I regret that I am what I am. But in your own way, you have made me…happy”\n\nThey agreed to a friendly divorce, and remained friends. Spock cut his five year stint on Vulcan short and returned to his commission in Starfleet. He attended Leila’s wedding to Lt. Kevin O’Reily only two years later, and wished them well.\n\nWedding #4 With a Song in His Heart\n\nUhura had seen her friend Spock go through three marriages with little success. But she knew a secret to his heart. Had it really been nearly a decade or so since her first flirtation with him on the Enterprise bridge? She had enjoyed their mutual love of music all these years and their musical bond grew ever closer as he taught her to play his treasured Vulcan Lyrette. “Music soothes the Vulcan brain,” she smiled, “and we communicate the language of love! They wed at the foot of the great Kagera Falls in Burundi. Yet romantic as it was, it proved a hindrance to their vows. The gushing falls were so loud they could barely hear themselves.\n\nA week later they received notice from Starfleet that their marriage was annulled as a recording of their vows revealed what they actually said:\n\n“I, Spock, bake you, Nyota, for my waffle shredded fife, to calve and twofold from this lay forward, for wetter, for verse, for snitcher, for borer, in thickness and stealth, until Beth does us tart.”\n\n“I, Nyota, shake you Spock, for my awful bedded custard, to halve and toe-hold from this play forward, for, petter, for purse, for twitcher, for horror, in chicness and in felt, until Seth does Jean Smart.”\n\nAnd so yet another marriage down the drain for Spock. The honeymoon did produce a wonderful result though. Their son… Tuvok.* Kirk swooped in to ‘comfort’ Uhura but she told him to get lost.\n\nWedding #5 Yes They Did!\n\nBy now it was becoming clear to Spock that maybe he was just not cut out for marriage.\n\nJim Kirk had been watching Spock’s nuptial entanglements for nearly 10 years now, and found himself longing to make his friend happy. Well, at least as happy as a Vulcan can be. Kirk took it upon himself to take Spock on a vacation. They settled on the beach-side planet of Aquara. Spock insisted he needed quiet time, and spent hours meditating by the ocean. Kirk rode horses on the beach and chased the bikinis.\n\nOf course this sent tongues wagging. For years the crew wondered if the ‘Space Husbands’ of the Enterprise had any basis in fact. Well… Kirk couldn’t stay distracted from Spock for long. He trekked up the sea cliff where Spock sat, cross-legged and shirtless as the waves dashed below him.\n\n“Spock.” Kirk sighed, “I feel so awful about your marriages. “I’m here for you. Spock. How can I. Help you?”\n\n“I assure you, Captain, I am working my way through this. Indeed, I am contemplating a complete severance from my human side, to embrace my logic–“\n\n“–No Spock, you mustn’t! Look, Marriage may not have agreed with you, but you can’t throw it –all away — because they — didn’t work!”\n\nSpock’s eyebrow raised. “Sir. You are an excellent captain, but from what I’ve seen of your own relationships, I respectively doubt your expertise as a marriage counselor.”\n\nKirk’s eyes pleaded. “We all need someone, Spock. Relationships are our life’s blood”\n\n“You slept with three of my wives.”\n\n“Well…we humans can be illogical and sometimes irrational. Forgive me, but I … had my reasons!”\n\nSpock’s other eyebrow shot up. “Specify.”\n\nKirk bit his lip. “Spock. Didn’t you ever notice how I looked. At. You. on The Enterprise? Or how thankful I was all the times you saved my life? Or how about the time I almost kissed you in the turbolift? Don’t you know–Why? I pursued all of your exes?”\n\n“I presumed it was your insatiable need for intimacy and to support comfort to them.”\n\n“Spock! Can’t you SEE?? You’re… the Bert to my Ernie, the Cher to my Sonny – Dammit, Spock, I had them all because they.Had. YOU! I……LOVE YOU! Please! Give me a chance before you throw it. All. Away! And please call me Jim.”\n\nSpock’s eyebrows almost crawled right off the top of his forehead. Not wanting to disappoint his captain and friend, Spock agreed to a ‘trial marriage’ and them were wed in a Starbase lounge.\n\nA week later, Kirk was promoted to Admiral, and if there was one thing Kirk wanted more than Spock, it was a promotion. Besides, he didn’t want to be a stepfather to Tuvok. The marriage was annulled, and Spock went back to Vulcan yet again, this time to achieve Kolinahr.\n\nWedding # 6 THIS was the Picard one!\n\nYears passed. Of course, Kirk and Spock came together on the new Enterprise to solve the mystery of V’Ger. Spock was devoted to his Enterprise family for the rest of their lives, and remained a devoted father to Tuvok and friend to all his exes.\n\nSpock decided after all his adventures with his Enterprise family had come to end that he would devote the rest of his life to a cause he had longed hoped for; the reunification of Vulcans and Romulans. He started by holding lectures on Vulcan, and as word got out, it attracted many young Vulcans, and one night, afterwards, an unexpected guest.\n\nWhen the hall was nearly empty, a figure in a deep grey cloak approached him.\n\n“May I speak with you?”\n\nThe voice was somewhat familiar, like something out of the past.\n\n“Of course.”\n\nThe figure looked around to see if all the others were gone, and slowly pulled back the cowl. A familiar half-smile greeted him. A good thing he hadn’t been drinking his water, for he would have surely had a spit-take.\n\n“Liviana!” he almost gasped.\n\nThe former Romulan Commander from whom he had helped his captain pilfer the cloaking device years earlier, now stood before him, her eyes crinkling as her smile fully bloomed.\n\n“Hello, Spock.”\n\nSpock cleared his throat. “It is pleasing to see you.”\n\n“The pleasure is mine.” Her eyes shone. “I believe in your endeavor to achieve Unification. May we discuss the logistics of bringing our worlds together?”\n\n“I would be honored.”\n\nWithin months, not only had they worked out a long-term plan to bring Romulans and Vulcans together, but had rediscovered their own personal connection, which truly had become more permanent as Spock had implied with hope those many years ago.\n\nThey married in a holodeck of Roman style gardens, where they were congratulated by Jean-Luc Picard.\n\nThe End.\n\nLike this story?

Hoping you had a fun New Year’s Eve and are enjoying a restful first day of 2022! I bet a lot of you watch football. I don’t, but for some reason, well…\n\nLast week for Christmas I received this marvelous 1:6 Spock Head from a dealer on eBay. I knew I couldn’t afford the entire doll, but I could buy a separate body for him on-line and the whole thing would be a fraction of the price of the original.\n\nSo first, here’s the marvelous head, that looks so much like Nimoy as Spock it’s astonishing; right down to the tiny extra nub of flesh below his right ear!\n\nKnowing I was going to receive this for Christmas (okay, I bought it and my husband paid for it!) I started looking into little civillian clothes for my new wee Spock. I hadn’t bought a body for him yet, but I figured I could just buy Ken doll body for him and stick it on. Little did I know…\n\nI found an adorable vintage football outfit for a Ken Doll from the early 60’s. Even though I don’t do football, I thought this would be fun for Spock to wear, as I looked forward to dressing and displaying him in un-Spockly fashion. This was a bargain for all the pieces as it wasn’t in the original packaging:\n\nOh dear, then it was like a can of Pringles… I had to find a few more outfits. Then I had to find a body to add the head to. I found a cheap GI Joe that looked suitable, and a cool vintage Ken Navy blue velvet blazer, a Ken red shawl neck sweater, a Ken collegiate Letterman cardigan and even Ken pajamas! My Spock would be the best dressed ever!\n\nNot so fast.\n\nFirst, I couldn’t get the head off of the GI Joe, and I didn’t want to ruin it, so he’s back in the box until I sell him. So I delved into the world of 1:6th scale action doll figures, and I found a model that was compatible with the Spock head. So when it arrived, the body had several sets of hands and that could be attached, but the feet weren’t attached either. I got the hands on okay, but the feet were tricky. My husband got them on, but the first time he got them on backward!\n\nSo just in time for today, I thought I’d gear up Spock in the ol’ Ken Football uniform. Well, the rubber shoulder pads worked, and I got the red jersey over it, but alas, these 1:6 models are much more muscular in the arms and legs than any early Ken doll would ever be – and the pants were too small for these legs! And not just that — the socks and cleats (shoes) were too small too!! So all the tops for the figure could fit, but not the pants! I’m already searching for appropriate 1:6 jeans and such. I promised myself this won’t be a new obsession. Well not much.\n\nI guess I’ll be selling back the football outfit on eBay, but at least I got a couple cute pics of Spock ready for the gridiron — at least from the waist up!\n\nI gotta say, the little rubber helmet is just adorable on him. Reminds me of the small role Nimoy had in “Francis Goes to West Point“!\n\nHappy New Year Everyone! Stay safe and well! -Therese xo"
