        "text": "Hi Everyone! It’s been a very busy few months, but I’m back baby!!\n\nMy friend Bobbie Reno has been working hard to get a commemorative stamp of Leonard Nimoy created for the Unites States Postal Service (USPS) and has created a petition to help move the process along. Wouldn’t that be great? Next year it will be a decade since his passing (hard to believe), and Bobbie has been contacting every outlet she can think of to show support and worthiness to the USPS stamp commission. She’s had letters of support from Adam Nimoy, Susan Nimoy, Adam Schiff, and The Elizabeth Peabody House which Leonard supported but by signing the following petition, this could give the project a bit groundswell!\n\nHere’s the petition link:\n\n(Sorry I couldn’t find a shorter link!)\n\nI can’t think of a better tribute to Leonard than a commemorative stamp in time for Star Trek’s 60th Anniversary in 2026! Here’s an excerpt from the petition:\n\nExamples of Leonard Nimoy’s influence and contributions.\n\nOn the iconic TV series and movies, Star Trek, through his legendary role as Mr. Spock, he encouraged people to seek careers as Astronauts and scientists. NASA considered Leonard a friend and colleague. Leonard was a talented fine arts photographer specializing in “conceptual” photographic projects focusing on social topics such as body image perception (“I am troubled by the fact that women in our culture are congratulated most for losing weight.” Leonard Nimoy), spiritual or religious themes and showing of introspective hidden personalities or persona. He earned a master’s degree in fine art photography from UCLA, where he studied under respected photographer, Robert Heineken.\n\nEducation was important in Leonard Nimoy’s life. He earned a master’s degree in education from Antioch University. He spoke frequently at colleges and universities around the Nation encouraging and supporting education programs. The Committee’s criteria for a stamp lists extraordinary and enduring contributions to American society, history, culture, or environment.\n\nIt is our contention that the Committee not just considered Leonard Nimoy’s role as Spock and his association with Star Trek only. Through his iconic role as Spock, Leonard is an ongoing major influence on American culture, sciences, and society; that continued beyond his role by positively influencing causes throughout his life.\n\nWhy is this important? Leonard Nimoy has been and continues to be a positive influence in the lives of many people. He has influenced people to become astronauts, sciences, artists and activists in social causes. Let’s honor him with a USPS Commemorative Stamp for Star Trek’s 60th Anniversary.\n\nPlease sign this today and SHARE it like crazy!\n\nHi Everyone! I hope you all had a wonderful Easter/Spring Break and that you were lucky enough here in the States to see the Total Solar Eclipse! We had perfect weather — the day BEFORE the eclipse— but it was grey and cloudy on the actual day 😦 . However we did experience a temperature drop and moderate darkness during the eclipse which was quite extraordinary!\n\nIn other news, the past couple of weeks I have indulged in my latest hobby, and it is highly gratifying! I’ve been learning to work with polymer clay and it has truly been a rewarding and somewhat life-changing experience! Thanks to watching the polymer master “Ace of Clay” on YouTube, it’s so satisfying to see a germ of an idea I had over a decade ago finally brought to fruition and completed!\n\nSo the project actually started years ago when I was in a craft shop and spotted a cute bag of craft pom-poms that looked like little tribbles with their perfect coloring of beige, brown, and white. I thought, it would make an cute sculpture someday with Kirk engulfed by tribbles! I bought the pom-poms with great ambition.\n\nOf course I wasn’t sure how I’d make the sculpture. I considered a fabric one, with felt to be stuffed and painted with the pom-poms glued on, but the logistics bugged me. What proportions could it be and how to keep it stable? I let the idea stew for a while, and like many of my creative dreams, the pom-poms got put aside and buried among many of my creative dreams piling up in my closet.\n\nIt wasn’t until a month or so ago when I came upon a video by Anthony, the “Ace of Clay” whose polymer clay creations just blew. me. away! I realized that this was my ticket to create my Kirk sculpture, and on March 29th I finally started it! Keep scrolling to see the gallery from start to finish!\n\nI’m very happy with the result and I think it’s okay for my first attempt. Of course I see its imperfections, (to me he looks more like Nicolas Cage that Bill Shatner) but that’s what learning is all about! I cannot describe the marvelous gratification one can have from creating something from scratch. And I am thrilled to add it to my other creative projects (photography and digital collages) — it is just a wonderful tactile, focusing hobby that challenges not only my sculpting skills, but painting too. Good for fine motor skills, and and just basic happiness! (And it only took 20+ years or so to make!) I cannot wait to start new project ! Enjoy the gallery, and watch the captain come to life! (I’ll have to share this with William Shatner!)\n\nWell Kids, I finally finished it! After two and a half months, I have finished my annual Memorial Collage to remember the notable celebrities and news-makers we lost in 2023. As you can see from time stamp in the bottom right corner of the above image, I ‘finished’ the original collage on January 29th. But then as I suspected would happen in my most recent post, I found at least a dozen celebrities I missed, and then I had to add them all into the original, and re-factor into the black and white key. Then I had to re-outline and renumber each image (multiple times when several were missed or accidentally double numbered!). Anyway I can safely say that the collage is well and FULLY complete! Whew!!!\n\nEvery year when I make this, I realize how much I love human faces — so I posted the best picture of each person I could find, (and sometimes more than one depending on their brilliance!)\n\nSome of these people I’ve never heard of, as I’m sure you haven’t also. And there is great pleasure in the learning of these diverse lives. I felt I got to know a lot of these talented people through their biographies. Many lived to be centenarians, and into their 90s. Far too many (as it seems every year) died tragically and too soon; but their light did shine as they lived.\n\nAlthough they have all passed, it is only fair to rediscover them and their legacies. That’s one reason I make these tributes every year; for so many are easily forgotten although they might have been very well known in their time.\n\nMay you find as much joy and inspiration as I have in discovering all these talents. Let me know what you think, and thanks for you patience.\n\nLove survives, Therese\n\nThe KEY below is in Black and White with sections in colored numbers determined by occupation:\n\nGREEN is Athletics, BRIGHT BLUE is Actors and Entertainers I, NAVY BLUE is Actors and Entertainers II, RED is Musicians, YELLOW is News-makers, and PURPLE are the many performers who fall into the STAR TREK FAMILY.

I got my new computer installed two weeks ago and we’re still tweaking a few programs here and there, but I have gotten back to working on my annual salute to all the newsmakers we lost in 2023, and it’s almost done!!\n\nWhen I make this annual collage, I always make sure to find the best pictures I can of each personality I can find. I can hear you now– “That’s fine Therese, but why does it take so long?”\n\nWell, many factors, including the new computer, but especially this: I love faces, and I try to convey their best face in their farewells. This is one reason it almost always takes me so long to finish!! Another matter is once you have all the pictures, then I convert them into .png images so I can layer them into groups of similar professions (Sports, actors, creators, newsmakers, musicians, and of course, the Star Trek family). Some of the more well known/iconic performers get more than one picture (this year Tina Turner, Raquel Welch and Harry Belafonte to name a few) After gathering all the names (spelled right) ages, and brief descriptions of their careers, I arrange each face to their proper group, then make a black and white key where the images are painstakingly outlined and numbered. There are over 265 people in the coming collage!\n\nAh the key!! This is where the most mistakes happen! I may skip a number, or mislabel a person, or worst of all, review the original list and realize I have LEFT OUT one or two important names!! When this happens, I have to redo the original collage, slipping the person into the right section, and then you have to scooch aside the characters around them to make them fit, them start numbering all over again! If I’m lucky, you won’t be able to figure out who was left out! –I found 3 people this year I had to engineer back into the original, and them re-number, but it will all work out.\n\nI hope to post the final collage by this coming Saturday 2/10, so stay tuned and thanks for your patience!! -Therese xo\n\nHi Everyone!\n\nI was lucky to attend a wonderful event in October! Adam Nimoy (son of Leonard) appeared at the Olav Shalom Synagogue in Albany NY to discuss the Jewish Connections to Star Trek. Not only did Adam find connections to Judaism through Trek, but also gave a preview of his next book that will be out in January.\n\nAdam was delightfully laid back and his presentation was insightful and humorous as well as reflecting on life with his father; their faith, struggles and joys. While reading passages from his book manuscript, he corrected some last minute typos to our delight. “It’s okay,” he said “it’s not out until January!”\n\nHe also expressed his wishes for peace in Israel/Gaza and all the war-zones around the world. Amen to that.\n\nBefore the talk, there was a delicious brunch with egg and tuna salads, green salad, yogurt with fresh fruit, lots of desserts, and of course, bagels-I had my first lox ever!\n\nAdam gave a list of the 10 episodes he found that suggested the influences of his Jewish faith. Of course there is the Vulcan Greeting, “Live Long and Prosper” and its v-formation based on the Hebrew letter Shin, and it being the first letter in the Hebrew word for Peace, which is “Shalom”. Alas, I should have taken notes, so I can only give a taste of Adam’s comparisons! (Sorry!) I was mostly just enjoying the moment, and it was wonderful.\n\nHere’s some examples; Moses wandering in the dessert was like Captain Kirk and his crew wandering throughout the galaxy. He also made references to Metamorphosis (The Companion as a caring god figure) and Journey to Babel (Nations struggling to reach a common peaceful goal) His favorite episode of TOS was The Menagerie, as he loved that it incorporated his father’s first appearance as Spock into a two-episode arc.\n\nAnd on a personal level, he also cited the story of Jonah and the Whale as it related to his own struggle with pot addiction, and finally being saved. This was very moving. I would add my own example here, the (New Testament) tale of The Prodigal Son in a way reflected the time between Adam and his father when their relationship was strained for a time, and not being in each other’s lives. Yet in time, and thankfully a good length time before Leonard was struck with COPD, he and Adam had reunited in love and a much better, closer father-son relationship, to the end of Leonard’s days.\n\n(I noted that Adam’s talk was being recorded, so I’m hoping that if it is put on line, I’ll be able to share it with you!)\n\nMy friend Bobbie* and I attended this event together, and we both had the chance to meet and greet Adam and have our picture taken with him. (Yay!) Bobbie (who is her town historian) is working very hard on a project to get a commemorative USPS stamp of Leonard in time for the 10th year anniversary of his passing in 2015. (She was active in having the stamp of Edmonia Lewis made for the USPS Black Heritage stamp series most recently). Bobbie showed Adam her thick file, filled with all her work to date in her stamp proposal, with recommendations of insights to Leonard’s patriotism, philanthropy and how his character of Spock is a true American icon, with his brave and caring discipline. Adam said “You know more about my Dad than I know!” Here’s hoping Bobbie succeeds!\n\nI gave Adam a 500 piece puzzle I had made up of the 90th birthday tribute to his Dad. He was surprised and intrigued by the intricate collage I made of his fathers life, and enjoyed seeing even tiny pictures of himself and his sister Julie contained within! I hope he and his family will enjoy the puzzle over the holidays!\n\nBobbie and I both got our pictures taken with him, and we each couldn’t resist throwing in a hug! What a fine mensch! Adam, if you’re reading this, Thank you again, and it was a pleasure!\n\nNOTE: To see the pictures I took from this event, please check out my Instagram page. (I am using my Instagram account here now for my default images since I ran out of room for images here when I returned to my original membership with WordPress)\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/therese.bohn/\n\n*whom I first met when I went to see Leonard Nimoy in NYC 10 years ago\n\nHi Everyone!\n\nIt’s been an interesting couple of weeks and if you have had problems logging into my site, I humbly apologize!\n\nYou see, the other week I received a note on my Paypal saying I owed $500+ to renew my site here on WordPress for two years. Now it’s a bit confusing, but I thought I had renewed my account here several months ago, but that was just for the domain name. The reason I had this enormous bill was because two years ago I had upgraded my trekkerscrapbook.com site to a commercial site so I could include a “Buy Me a Coffee” link that my readers could click on if they wanted to send a donation of support to the site.\n\nLong story short, I got a hold of WordPress in a panic, letting them know that there was no way I could afford the commercial billing now. The associate was delightfully friendly, patient, and understanding of my dilemma. She let me know that, yes, I would be refunded the big amount and instead my site would go back to looking like it did two years ago, and it would only charge me $48 a year.\n\nWhew!\n\nAlthough I was relieved to be refunded my original amount, I noticed that I had to log back in to get back to doing all the stuff I do here. Fine! I’ll just look up my password…\n\nCould not find my my password list!!! Fortunately I just found it today and here I am. HOWEVER, as well as my site being returned to its previous format (Coraline) it had also be changed to a ‘Private’ site, which is why some of you may not have been able to have access. Well, I just fixed that, and you should all have no problem seeing my site now. So sorry for the mess, and thanks again for your patronage.\n\nAnd as to the donate button, I’d like to thank the two of you who donated! I did have a nice cup of tea! Greatly appreciated!\n\nAnd now back to your regularly scheduled trekkerscrapbook.com. My next post will appear soon about my wonderful visit to Albany last month to see Adam Nimoy!\n\nLove to you all, Therese 🙂"
