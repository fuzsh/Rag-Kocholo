        "text": "Migraineurs show subtle differences in perceptual sensitivity that have been attributed to cortical hyperexcitability. Coutts et al. [Coutts, Cooper, Elwell and Wilkins, 2012, Cephalalgia, in press] found that the haemodynamic response at the offset of aversive visual patterns is more rapid in migraineurs than non-migraineurs. We measured contrast thresholds for aversion to drifting, vibrating and static patterns in migraineurs and headache-free controls. For both migraineurs and controls, drifting and vibrating patterns were more aversive than static patterns. Static patterns are epileptogenic in patients with photosensitive epilepsy; vibrating patterns are more so and drifting patterns less so [Binnie, Findlay and Wilkins, 1985, Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol,61,1-6]. There was therefore no simple relationship between the epileptogenic properties of the pattern and the aversion it evoked, even though, overall, the migraineurs showed greater discomfort than controls. We recorded the haemodynamic response to the patterns (using near-infrared spectroscopy). There were no differences in the amplitude of the haemodynamic response, but there was a steeper response at the offset of the drifting pattern, which was the most aversive. Our findings suggest that this difference between grating patterns (and between migraineurs and controls as shown by Coutts et al.) may reflect the aversion.\n\nHere we report the range and reliability of individual differences in stereo acuity in a large, well-characterised population. We tested 1000 participants aged 16-40 on a novel test of stereo acuity and on the TNO test. Participants had their monocular and binocular visual acuity measured and corrected. They were assessed for strabismus by means of a cover test, and by cards for detecting lateral and vertical phorias presented using a telebinocular. Contrast sensitivity was assessed separately for each eye, as was the magnitude of binocular masking. We report the range and distribution of individual variability for each of our measures, and the correlations between them. We also report test–retest reliabilities measured using a random 10% of our sample.\n\nThis study examined the range and reliability of individual differences in several oculomotor measures. One thousand participants were tested using standard smooth pursuit and pro- and antisaccade paradigms. In the smooth pursuit task, the variables of interest were the root mean square error of eye position, gain (ratio of eye velocity to target velocity), and number and type of intruding saccades. In the saccadic tasks, the variables of interest were accuracy, latency distribution and velocity characteristics. We report the range and distribution of these variables, as well as correlations between them. We also report a number of internal consistency reliability measures for these variables, as well as test–retest reliabilities based on a randomly selected 10% of the sample.\n\nWe demonstrate a reliable perceptual polymorphism for a class of ambiguously rotating stimuli. Twenty participants reported the perceived direction of rotation of structure-from-motion cylinders and silhouettes of a pirouetting dancer presented briefly to the left or right of fixation. Nearly all participants showed a robust directional bias across two testing occasions. This bias was consistent between presentation locations for most participants, but a minority reliably showed an opposite bias in the two hemifields. Biases were highly correlated between the two stimulus types, though we found some evidence that the initial frame of the pirouetting dancer animation could influence perceived direction on a given trial. In a follow-up study, we tested 1000 participants using the structure-from-motion stimulus. We report the distribution of directional biases observed in this sample, as well as their correlation with measures of handedness, ocular dominance and ideational type. We also report test–retest reliabilities based on a randomly selected subset of 100 participants.\n\nVisually ambiguous stimuli are often used to study perceptual learning, but little is known of the neural mechanisms involved. We investigated the substrates of perceptual learning for bistable structure-from-motion stimuli by first inducing a directional bias, then examining whether changing single stimulus parameters affected the efficacy of counter-training to reverse this initial bias. First, we found that a monocularly trained bias was equally resistant to reversal in the trained eye and the untrained eye, suggesting that the site of learning is at, or follows, the site of binocular combination. Secondly, for the majority of subjects, changing the surface features of the cylinders had no effect on the resistance of a trained binocular bias to reversal, indicating little selectivity for surface features in the learning mechanisms. Finally, changing the hemifield to which stimuli were presented enabled bias reversal in over 50% of subjects, suggesting that the learning mechanisms utilise stimulus location cues to some extent. To explain the interindividual differences in our findings, one could postulate either that the learning occurs for different subjects at different levels of analysis, or that the learning occurs at the same level but different subjects give different weight to different features of the scene.\n\nVisual estimation of object stability is an ecologically important judgment that allows observers to predict objects' physical behavior. Previously we have used the 'critical angle' of tilt to measure perceived object stability (VSS 2010; VSS 2011). The current study uses a different paradigm—measuring the critical extent to which an object can \"stick out\" over a precipitous edge before falling off. Observers stereoscopically viewed a rendered scene containing a 3D object placed near a table’s edge. Objects were slanted conical frustums that varied in their slant angle, aspect ratio, and direction of slant (pointing toward/away from the edge). In the stability task, observers adjusted the horizontal position of the object relative to the precipitous edge until it was perceived to be in unstable equilibrium. In the CoM task, they adjusted the height of a small ball probe to indicate perceived CoM. Results exhibited a significant effect of all three variables on stability judgments. Observers underestimated stability for frustums slanting away from the edge, and overestimated stability when slanting toward it, suggesting a bias toward the center of the supporting base. However, performance was close to veridical in the CoM task—providing further evidence of mutual inconsistency between perceived stability and CoM judgments.\n\nSeveral recent studies have shown that deficits of visual temporal processing are associated with poor mathematical skills in school-aged children. Here, we replicate and extend this finding in a large sample (n = 958) of university-educated adults. As part of the PERGENIC study, we measured psychophysical sensitivity to coherent motion (CM) and to Gabors of low spatial and high temporal frequency (GS), as well as obtaining self-report measures of ability in mathematics and science (MS) and arts and literature (AL). We found that participants with low MS were significantly less sensitive than those with high MS for both CM (Cohen’s d = 0.58) and GS (d = 0.38). Furthermore, MS was positively correlated with CM (Spearman’s ρ = .20) and GS (ρ = .14) across the full sample. In contrast, participants with low AL were significantly more sensitive than those with high AL for GS (d = 0.34), though the two groups did not differ on CM; and AL was negatively correlated with both CM (ρ = −.10) and GS (ρ = −.11) across the full sample. We discuss our findings in the context of magnocellular and dorsal stream theories of cognitive developmental disorders."
