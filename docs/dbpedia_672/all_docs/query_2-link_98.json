        "text": "Could you have picked a more bizarre picture of Sara Carbonero, a darker one of Inma Cuesta, or a more exotic one from Romania? What's the game here? T-roll Spaniards and Romanians?\n\nIt can't be Sikeliot/Portuguese Princess/Clementina in that case: maybe it's Joey the Nordicist Neapolitan (isn't that an oxymoron?) with all his old agendas.\n\nIf it's not one of you two it's somebody just as bizarre. I don't care who you are or what kind of games young idiot Italians are playing with young idiot Spaniards on other places on the internet, or young idiot Hungarians, or young idiot Poles or anything else. You all deserve each other. Your type of nonsense won't fly here.\n\nYou people never learn. You all should be on medication.\n\nAnd don't you ever compare me to the people at italicroots or the guy at anthrogenica. I play it straight, always have, and always will. Go back and play with the Neo- Nazis on the sites that are still open. It won't be long until you'll all have to go to the dark net where normal people won't be bothered.\n\nIf you come back in three months for your last hurrah, I'll freaking block you so I don't have to see your inanities on PM.\n\n\"What's the game here?\" That's what I thought myself. What's ironic is that in one thread, he posted photos of some of the more exotic and in many cases, unattractive (not saying exotic looking means unattractive, mind you. Plenty of attractive middle eastern women out there) Italians he could find; whereas here, in this thread, the least exotic and more attractive photo is of Monica Belucci, the Italian.\n\nMy point is that it's hard to figure out his motive. Someone who wants to paint Italians as unattractive or exotic as possible would never post that pic of Monica Bellucci, there must be something unique about the brain structure of anthro forum t-rolls.\n\nJust my 2-cents\n\n@Bicicleur,\n\nAll of these pictures are so called \"glamour\" shots. They're made up in certain ways, dressed in certain ways, told to pose in certain ways and to put on certain expressions. There's a huge contrast between the way they ask these women to look and the way they asked someone like Lina Cavalieri to look, for example. It's \"harder\" I guess you could say? More overtly sexual? That's a symptom of our culture. Generally, people, especially men, must like it or these women wouldn't be so celebrated. Whether these women are like this in real life or are self-absorbed and nasty you'd have to have a personal relationship with them to really know.\n\nClaudia Cardinale is a good example. Look at the first picture versus the second. She was a difficult women to make look \"bitchy\" though.\n\nIt wasn't easy to make her look hard and vampy, however. She was just too \"soft\" and feminine looking, or that smile would break out.\n\nIt works the same with blonde actresses for me, although perhaps you don't think so. Blondes are sometimes perceived as less intimidating, perhaps because it's associated with youth. Anyway, here's Charlize Theron. They absolutely transformed her.\n\nAs for \"Blanco\"...I didn't even look at the pictures on the other thread. I just saw dozens of nightclub photos of dark haired people, and figured it had to be the usual suspect using a sock. He informed me they're Cypriots, and was highly indignant that I could mistake them for Italians. I didn't mistake them for anything. I didn't even look at them. So, yes, it's probably \"Joey\". These clowns down get that I don't care what nationality you are. There will be none of that phenotype t-rolling of other nationalities. Period. End of story.\n\nTalking about T-rolls, there are many ****** in the cinema. Like Ridley Scott, one of the worst directors. He had employed native americans extras as spanish navy soldiers in the first encounter between spaniards and native americans in his movie 1492, Good job for non sense.\n\nThey've been doing it for decades. When I first went to the southwest and stopped at an Indian Reservation, I was stunned that they didn't look like Italians. Only then did I realize that they'd been using Italians as extras on those westerns.\n\nThey put a brown wash on Marisa Pavan (sister of Pier Angeli), a wig, and ta-dah, she was supposed to look Amerindian...\n\nThe real thing:\n\nThey also thought it was a good idea to have Natalie Wood (Russian), play a Puerto Rican...Italian she could play, but Puerto Rican?\n\nMeanwhile, I don't think there's anything hard, or vampy or whatever about Tuba Büyüküstün. I think she's lovely.\n\nI understand that a woman wants to make herself prettier. It improves her self-esteem and makes her feel more feminin. I can sympathise with that.\n\nBut I don't understand what happens when woman dress up and make up to pose for a camera. They get a mass of anonymous admirers to the extend that the women can even make some money out of that. I can only say that I think these admirers are stupid and I'm not one of them.\n\nThe same goes for football players and other celbrities."
