        "text": "Abstract\n\nFor citizen science games (CSGs) to be successful in advancing scientific research, they must effectively train players. Designing tutorials for training can be aided through developing a skill chain of required skills and their dependencies, but skill chain development is an intensive process. In this work, we hypothesized that free recall may be a simpler yet effective method of directly eliciting skill chains. We elicited 23 skill chains from players and developers and augmented our reflexive thematic analysis with 11 semi-structured interviews in order to determine how players and developers conceptualize skill trees and whether free recall can be used as an alternative to more resource-intensive cognitive task analyses. We provide three main contributions: (1) a comparison of skill chain conceptualizations between players and developers and across prior literature; (2) insights to the process of free recall in eliciting CSG skill chains; and (3) a preliminary toolkit of CSG skill-based design recommendations based on our findings. We conclude CSG developers should: give the big picture up front; embrace social learning and paratext use; reinforce the intended structure of knowledge; situate learning within applicable, meaningful contexts; design for discovery and self-reflection; and encourage practice and learning beyond the tutorial. Free recall was ineffective for determining a traditional skill chain but was able to elicit the core gameplay loops, tutorial overviews, and some expert insights.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nLada A Adamic. 2000.

In this ...\n\nWrapped in Story: The Affordances of Narrative for Citizen Science Games\n\nFDG '23: Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games\n\nCitizen science games enable public participation in scientific research, yet these games often struggle to engage wide audiences. As a potential solution, some game developers look to narrative as an experience-enhancing feature. Yet the impacts and ...\n\nUsing a Disjoint Skill Model for Game and Task Difficulty in Human Computation Games\n\nCHI PLAY '19 Extended Abstracts: Extended Abstracts of the Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play Companion Extended Abstracts\n\nPrior research has used player rating systems to balance difficulty in human computation games (HCGs) without having to modify their levels by assigning ratings to levels to indicate level difficulty. Skill chains have also been used to define difficulty ...\n\nInformation & Contributors\n\nInformation\n\nPublished In\n\n1535 pages\n\nEISSN:2573-0142\n\nDOI:10.1145/3490463\n\nEditors:\n\nKathrin Gerling\n\nKU Leuven\n\n,\n\nElisa Mekler\n\nAalto University\n\n,\n\nRegan Mandryk\n\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\n\nIssue’s Table of Contents\n\nCopyright © 2021 ACM.\n\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.
