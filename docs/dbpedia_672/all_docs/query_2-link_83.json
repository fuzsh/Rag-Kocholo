Per una iconologia rifondata; Contributors\n\nIn recent years the study of miraculous images has experienced a substantial re-evaluation of their importance as powerful agents of divine intercession and assistance in Renaissance society. Nonetheless, aspects related to the genesis, devotional use and preferences of these images remain only broadly outlined and geographically constrained. In parallel with the great veneration for miracle-performing Marian and Christological imagery, other saintly figures became the objects of widespread devotion on account of their protective and curative powers, and the images of these saints became cult objects themselves. This volume fills a void in current art historical research and examines how miraculous images and the imagery of healing saints were crucial to the creation of individual, corporate and collective identities in Florence, Siena, Rome, Naples and other lesser researched Italian centres. The essays in this collection address aspects related to the development of hagiographies, iconographies, cult of relics, and devotion of healing saints. Moreover, it considers imagery related to miraculous events also in terms of material culture in the private and public domains. The images will therefore be studied both as aesthetic objects and as cult objects, in order to interrogate the often tense relationship between mechanical vision and cultural visuality. While dealing with specific curative, protective, and miraculous episodes related to the exposition of sacred images, this book unravels questions of patronage, authorship, agency, and tradition.\n\nThe icon of the Madonna Bruna del Carmine is the most famous cult image in Naples. Its immense devotional status has earned it a place on the high altar of the fourteenth-century Carmelite church situated in Piazza Mercato, the bustling hub of Neapolitan social and economic life for more than seven centuries. Venerated as miraculous since the sixteenth century, its prodigious healing powers have continued to inspire the devotion of all social classes. The icon as we see it today is an enigmatic artefact. Its format and iconography testify to medieval origins, while its current appearance dates to 1975 when the overpainting of earlier restorations was removed, and it was almost entirely repainted. This article hypothetically reconstructs the material history of the Madonna Bruna del Carmine and explores the social dynamics that gave rise to its veneration. A close examination of the painting and its restorations allows a better understanding of the icon’s history, style, and iconography. The possible dating to c. 1280 links the icon to the early history of the church and convent of Santa Maria del Carmine in Naples. Founded in 1270, the church was rebuilt at the beginning of the 1300’s but its importance in the city emerged in the second half of the 1400’s when it was incorporated into the city walls, became the seat of public rituals and a destination of civic processions, as well as a privileged site for artisans' city guilds. Textual and visual sources testify to the events that determined the affirmation of the icon as a cult image in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when it became a formidable tool of propaganda and social control."
