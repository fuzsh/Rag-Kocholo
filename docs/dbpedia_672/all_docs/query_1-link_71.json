Three eyes were treated for retinal arterial macroaneurysms and followed by swept-source optical coherence tomography in 2014-2015. En face images of the retina and choroid were obtained by EnView, a swept-source optical coherence tomography program. Retinal arterial macroaneurysms have a typical optical coherence tomography appearance. En face view allows delineation of the macroaneurysm wall, thrombotic components within the dilation, and lumen measurement. Hemorrhage, lipids, and fluids can be precisely described in terms of amount and extent over the macula and depth. This technique is also practical for planning focal laser treatment and determining its effects. En face swept-source optical coherence tomography is a rapid, noninvasive, high-resolution, promising technology, which allows excellent visualization of retinal arterial macroaneurysms and their consequences on surrounding tissues. It could make angiography with intravenous injection redundant in planning and assessing therapy.\n\nSimple and versatile long range swept source for optical coherence tomography applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrÃ¤uer, Bastian; Lippok, Norman; Murdoch, Stuart G.; Vanholsbeeck, FrÃ©dÃ©rique\n\n2015-12-01\n\nWe present a versatile long coherence length swept-source laser design for optical coherence tomography applications. This design consists of a polygonal spinning mirror and an optical gain chip in a modified Littman-Metcalf cavity. A narrowband intra-cavity filter is implemented through multiple passes off a diffraction grating set at grazing incidence. The key advantage of this design is that it can be readily adapted to any wavelength regions for which broadband gain chips are available. We demonstrate this by implementing sources at 1650 nm, 1550 nm, 1310 nm and 1050 nm. In particular, we present a 1310 nm swept source laser with 24 mm coherence length, 95 nm optical bandwidth, 2 kHz maximum sweep frequency and 7.5 mW average output power. These parameters make it a suitable source for the imaging of biological samples.\n\nSPECTRAL DOMAIN VERSUS SWEPT SOURCE OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RETINAL CAPILLARY PLEXUSES IN SICKLE CELL MACULOPATHY.\n\nPubMed\n\nJung, Jesse J; Chen, Michael H; Frambach, Caroline R; Rofagha, Soraya; Lee, Scott S\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTo compare the spectral domain and swept source optical coherence tomography angiography findings in two cases of sickle cell maculopathy. A 53-year-old man and a 24-year-old man both with sickle cell disease (hemoglobin SS) presented with no visual complaints; Humphrey visual field testing demonstrated asymptomatic paracentral scotomas that extended nasally in the involved eyes. Clinical examination and multimodal imaging including spectral domain and swept source optical coherence tomography, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography angiography and swept source optical coherence tomography angiography (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc, Dublin, CA) were performed. Fundus examination of both patients revealed subtle thinning of the macula. En-face swept source optical coherence tomography confirmed the extent of the thinning correlating with the functional paracentral scotomas on Humphrey visual field. Swept source optical coherence tomography B-scan revealed multiple confluent areas of inner nuclear thinning and significant temporal retinal atrophy. En-face 6 Ã 6-mm spectral domain optical coherence tomography angiography of the macula demonstrated greater loss of the deep capillary plexus compared with the superficial capillary plexus. Swept source optical coherence tomography angiography 12 Ã 12-mm imaging captured the same macular findings and loss of both plexuses temporally outside the macula. In these two cases of sickle cell maculopathy, deep capillary plexus ischemia is more extensive within the macula, whereas both the superficial capillary plexus and deep capillary plexus are involved outside the macula likely due to the greater oxygen demands and watershed nature of these areas. Swept source optical coherence tomography angiography clearly demonstrates the angiographic extent of the disease correlating with the Humphrey visual field scotomas and confluent areas of inner nuclear atrophy.\n\nSwept source optical coherence tomography using an all-fiber 1300-nm ring laser source.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoma, Michael A; Hsu, Kevin; Izatt, Joseph A\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe increased sensitivity of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) has driven the development of a new generation of technologies in OCT, including rapidly tunable, broad bandwidth swept laser sources and spectral domain OCT interferometer topologies. In this work, the operation of a turnkey 1300-nm swept laser source is demonstrated. This source has a fiber ring cavity with a semiconductor optical amplifier gain medium. Intracavity mode selection is achieved with an in-fiber tunable fiber Fabry-Perot filter. A novel optoelectronic technique that allows for even sampling of the swept source OCT signal in k space also is described. A differential swept source OCT system is presented, and images of in vivo human cornea and skin are presented. Lastly, the effects of analog-to-digital converter aliasing on image quality in swept source OCT are discussed.\n\nCorneal thickness and elevation measurements using swept-source optical coherence tomography and slit scanning topography in normal and keratoconic eyes.\n\nPubMed\n\nJhanji, Vishal; Yang, Bingzhi; Yu, Marco; Ye, Cong; Leung, Christopher K S\n\n2013-11-01\n\nTo compare corneal thickness and corneal elevation using swept source optical coherence tomography and slit scanning topography. Prospective study. 41 normal and 46 keratoconus subjects. All eyes were imaged using swept source optical coherence tomography and slit scanning tomography during the same visit. Mean corneal thickness and best-fit sphere measurements were compared between the instruments. Agreement of measurements between swept source optical coherence tomography and scanning slit topography was analyzed. Intra-rater reproducibility coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient were evaluated. In normal eyes, central corneal thickness measured by swept source optical coherence tomography was thinner compared with slit scanning topography (pâ<â0.0001) and ultrasound pachymetry (pâ=â<â.0001). Ultrasound pachymetry readings had better 95% limits of agreement with swept source optical coherence tomography than slit scanning topography. In keratoconus eyes, central corneal thickness was thinner on swept source optical coherence tomography than slit scanning topography (pâ=â0.081) and ultrasound pachymetry (pâ=â0.001). There were significant differences between thinnest corneal thickness, and, anterior and posterior best-fit sphere measurements between both instruments (pâ<â0.05 for all). Overall, reproducibility coefficients and intraclass correlation coefficients were significantly better with swept source optical coherence tomography for measurement of central corneal thickness, anterior best-fit sphere and, posterior best-fit sphere (all pâ<â0.001). Corneal thickness and elevation measurements were significantly different between swept source optical coherence tomography and slit scanning topography. With better reproducibility coefficients and intraclass correlation coefficients, swept source optical coherence tomography may provide a reliable alternative for measurement of corneal parameters.

A multicenter, prospective, cross-sectional study of diabetic and nondiabetic subjects using swept-source optical coherence tomography imaging. Choroidal thickness maps, according to the nine Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfields, were obtained using automated software. Mean CT was calculated as the mean value within the ETDRS grid, and central CT as the mean in the central 1 mm. Diabetic eyes were divided into four groups: no diabetic retinopathy (No DR), nonproliferative DR (NPDR), NPDR with diabetic macular edema (NPDR + DME), and proliferative DR (PDR). Multilevel mixed linear models were performed for analyses. The authors included 50 control and 160 diabetic eyes (n = 27 No DR, n = 51 NPDR, n = 61 NPDR + DME, and n = 21 PDR). Mean CT (Ã = -42.9, P = 0.022) and central CT (Ã = -50.2, P = 0.013) were statistically significantly thinner in PDR eyes compared with controls, even after adjusting for confounding factors. Controlling for age, DR eyes presented a significantly decreased central CT than diabetic eyes without retinopathy (Î² = -36.2, P = 0.009). Swept-source optical coherence tomography demonstrates a significant reduction of CT in PDR compared with controls. In the foveal region, the choroid appears to be thinner in DR eyes than in diabetic eyes without retinopathy.\n\nLong axial imaging range using conventional swept source lasers in optical coherence tomography via re-circulation loops\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBradu, Adrian; Jackson, David A.; Podoleanu, Adrian\n\n2018-03-01\n\nTypically, swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) imaging instruments are capable of a longer axial range than their camera based (CB) counterpart. However, there are still various applications that would take advantage for an extended axial range. In this paper, we propose an interferometer configuration that can be used to extend the axial range of the OCT instruments equipped with conventional swept-source lasers up to a few cm. In this configuration, the two arms of the interferometer are equipped with adjustable optical path length rings. The use of semiconductor optical amplifiers in the two rings allows for compensating optical losses hence, multiple paths depth reflectivity profiles (Ascans) can be combined axially. In this way, extremely long overall axial ranges are possible. The use of the recirculation loops produces an effect equivalent to that of extending the coherence length of the swept source laser. Using this approach, the achievable axial imaging range in SS-OCT can reach values well beyond the limit imposed by the coherence length of the laser, to exceed in principle many centimeters. In the present work, we demonstrate axial ranges exceeding 4 cm using a commercial swept source laser and reaching 6 cm using an \"in-house\" swept source laser. When used in a conventional set-up alone, both these lasers can provide less than a few mm axial range.\n\nRepeatability and agreement in optical biometry of a new swept-source optical coherence tomography-based biometer versus partial coherence interferometry and optical low-coherence reflectometry.\n\nPubMed\n\nKunert, Kathleen S; Peter, Monika; Blum, Marcus; Haigis, Wolfgang; Sekundo, Walter; SchÃ¼tze, Juliane; BÃ¼ehren, Tobias\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo estimate the repeatability of biometric parameters obtained with a new swept-source biometer and to compare the agreement with that of partial coherence interferometry (PCI) and optical low-coherence reflectometry (OLCR). Department of Ophthalmology, Helios Hospital Erfurt, Erfurt, Julius-Maximilians University, WÃ¼rzburg, and Philipps University, Marburg, Germany. Prospective comparative multicenter clinical study. Biometry was taken with the use of 3 different biometers: the IOLMaster 700 swept-source biometer, the PCI-based IOLMaster 500, and the OCLR-based Lenstar LS 900. Axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and spherical equivalent (SE) were compared between swept-source and PCI biometry and central corneal thickness (CCT) and lens thickness (LT) between swept-source and OLCR biometry. The repeatability of swept-source biometry was evaluated on the basis of 3 measurements captured for each patient. One hundred twenty cataract eyes were included in the study. The mean difference between swept-source and PCI biometry for AL, ACD, and SE measurements was 4 Î¼m Â± 25 (SD), 17 Â± 122 Î¼m, and -0.001 Â± 0.19 diopter (D), respectively. The mean difference between swept-source and OLCR biometry for LT and CCT measurements was 21 Â± 122 Î¼m and 0.15 Â± 4.51 Î¼m, respectively. Differences between swept-source biometry and the other devices distributed around zero without statistical significance. The standard deviation of repeatability for AL, ACD, LT, CCT, and SE was 8.8 Î¼m, 9.8 Î¼m, 2.3 Î¼m, 19.5 Î¼m, and 0.1 D, respectively. Swept-source biometry showed high repeatability performance for all biometric parameters. The agreement of AL, ACD, and SE between swept-source and PCI biometry as well as that of LT and CCT between swept-source and OLCR biometry was excellent. It remains to be validated whether high repeatability shown by swept-source biometry will result in better postoperative refractive outcomes. Drs. Blum and Sekundo are members of the\n\nVISUALIZATION FROM INTRAOPERATIVE SWEPT-SOURCE MICROSCOPE-INTEGRATED OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY IN VITRECTOMY FOR COMPLICATIONS OF PROLIFERATIVE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY.\n\nPubMed\n\nGabr, Hesham; Chen, Xi; Zevallos-Carrasco, Oscar M; Viehland, Christian; Dandrige, Alexandria; Sarin, Neeru; Mahmoud, Tamer H; Vajzovic, Lejla; Izatt, Joseph A; Toth, Cynthia A\n\n2018-01-10\n\nTo evaluate the use of live volumetric (4D) intraoperative swept-source microscope-integrated optical coherence tomography in vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy complications. In this prospective study, we analyzed a subgroup of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy complications who required vitrectomy and who were imaged by the research swept-source microscope-integrated optical coherence tomography system. In near real time, images were displayed in stereo heads-up display facilitating intraoperative surgeon feedback. Postoperative review included scoring image quality, identifying different diabetic retinopathy-associated pathologies and reviewing the intraoperatively documented surgeon feedback. Twenty eyes were included. Indications for vitrectomy were tractional retinal detachment (16 eyes), combined tractional-rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (2 eyes), and vitreous hemorrhage (2 eyes). Useful, good-quality 2D (B-scans) and 4D images were obtained in 16/20 eyes (80%). In these eyes, multiple diabetic retinopathy complications could be imaged. Swept-source microscope-integrated optical coherence tomography provided surgical guidance, e.g., in identifying dissection planes under fibrovascular membranes, and in determining residual membranes and traction that would benefit from additional peeling. In 4/20 eyes (20%), acceptable images were captured, but they were not useful due to high tractional retinal detachment elevation which was challenging for imaging. Swept-source microscope-integrated optical coherence tomography can provide important guidance during surgery for proliferative diabetic retinopathy complications through intraoperative identification of different complications and facilitation of intraoperative decision making.\n\nSubgingival calculus imaging based on swept-source optical coherence tomography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHsieh, Yao-Sheng; Ho, Yi-Ching; Lee, Shyh-Yuan; Lu, Chih-Wei; Jiang, Cho-Pei; Chuang, Ching-Cheng; Wang, Chun-Yang; Sun, Chia-Wei\n\n2011-07-01\n\nWe characterized and imaged dental calculus using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). The refractive indices of enamel, dentin, cementum, and calculus were measured as 1.625 +/- 0.024, 1.534 +/- 0.029, 1.570 +/- 0.021, and 2.097 +/- 0.094, respectively. Dental calculus leads strong scattering properties, and thus, the region can be identified from enamel with SS-OCT imaging. An extracted human tooth with calculus is covered with gingiva tissue as an in vitro sample for tomographic imaging.\n\nSubgingival calculus imaging based on swept-source optical coherence tomography.\n\nPubMed\n\nHsieh, Yao-Sheng; Ho, Yi-Ching; Lee, Shyh-Yuan; Lu, Chih-Wei; Jiang, Cho-Pei; Chuang, Ching-Cheng; Wang, Chun-Yang; Sun, Chia-Wei\n\n2011-07-01\n\nWe characterized and imaged dental calculus using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).

The swept-source OCT system comprises a superluminescent diode (SLD) as broad-band light source, an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) as frequency tuning device, and a compact, nearly common-path interferometer. Both the amplitude and the phase map of the interference fringe signal are reconstructed. Optical sectioning of the latent fingerprint sample is obtained by selective Fourier filtering and the topography is retrieved from the phase map. Interferometry, selective filtering, low coherence and hence better resolution are some of the advantages of the proposed system over the conventional fingerprint detection techniques. The present technique is non-invasive in nature and does not require any physical or chemical processing. Therefore, the quality of the sample does not alter and hence the same fingerprint can be used for other types of forensic test. Exploitation of low-coherence interferometry for fingerprint detection itself provides an edge over other existing techniques as fingerprints can even be lifted from low-reflecting surfaces. The proposed system is very economical and compact.\n\nVASCULAR ABNORMALITIES IN DIABETIC RETINOPATHY ASSESSED WITH SWEPT-SOURCE OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY WIDEFIELD IMAGING.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchaal, Karen B; Munk, Marion R; Wyssmueller, Iris; Berger, Lieselotte E; Zinkernagel, Martin S; Wolf, Sebastian\n\n2017-11-10\n\nTo detect vascular abnormalities in diabetic retinopathy using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA) widefield images, and to compare the findings with color fundus photographs (CFPs) using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study severity grading. 3 mm Ã 3 mm and 12 mm Ã 12 mm scans were acquired to cover 70Â° to 80Â° of the posterior pole using a 100-kHz SS-OCTA instrument. Two masked graders assessed the presence of vascular abnormalities on SS-OCTA and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study level on CFP. The grading results were then compared. A total of 120 diabetic eyes (60 patients) were imaged with the SS-OCTA instrument. Cohort 1 (91 eyes; SS-OCTA grading only) showed microaneurysms in 91% (n = 83), intraretinal microvascular abnormalities in 79% (n = 72), and neovascularization in 21% (n = 19) of cases. Cohort 2 (52 eyes; CFP grading compared with SS-OCTA) showed microaneurysms on CFP in 90% (n = 47) and on SS-OCTA in 96% (n = 50) of cases. Agreement in intraretinal microvascular abnormality detection was fair (k = 0.2). Swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography detected 50% of intraretinal microvascular abnormality cases (n = 26), which were missed on CFP. Agreement in detecting neovascularization was moderate (k = 0.5). Agreement in detection of diabetic retinopathy features on CFP and SS-OCTA varies depending on the vascular changes examined. Swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography shows a higher detection rate of intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (P = 0.039), compared with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grading.\n\nEN FACE IMAGING OF PACHYCHOROID SPECTRUM DISORDERS WITH SWEPT-SOURCE OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY.\n\nPubMed\n\nDansingani, Kunal K; Balaratnasingam, Chandrakumar; Naysan, Jonathan; Freund, K Bailey\n\n2016-03-01\n\nTo correlate clinical manifestations with choroidal morphology in pachychoroid disorders, including central serous chorioretinopathy, pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy, pachychoroid neovasculopathy, and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, using en face swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT). Patients with pachychoroid spectrum diagnoses were identified nonconsecutively through a review of charts and multimodal imaging. Each eye was categorized as uncomplicated pachychoroid, pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, pachychoroid neovasculopathy, or polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. All patients included in this series then underwent bilateral swept-source OCT. Sixty-six eyes of 33 patients were included. Numbers assigned to diagnostic categories were 8 uncomplicated pachychoroid, 13 pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy, 27 central serous chorioretinopathy, 15 pachychoroid neovasculopathy, and 3 polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. One eye was classified as normal. Swept-source OCT choroidal thickness maps confirmed increased thickness under the areas of pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, type 1 NV (pachychoroid neovasculopathy), or polyps (polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy). En face swept-source OCT showed dilated outer choroidal vessels in all eyes. In several eyes with a chronic disease, focal choriocapillaris atrophy with inward displacement of deep choroidal vessels was noted. Although clinical manifestations of pachychoroid spectrum disorders vary considerably, these entities share morphologic findings in the choroid, including increased thickness and dilated outer choroidal vessels. En face swept-source OCT localizes these changes to disease foci and shows additional findings that may unify our understanding of disease pathogenesis.\n\nSwept source optical coherence microscopy using a 1310 nm VCSEL light source\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAhsen, Osman O.; Tao, Yuankai K.; Potsaid, Benjamin M.; Sheikine, Yuri; Jiang, James; Grulkowski, Ireneusz; Tsai, Tsung-Han; Jayaraman, Vijaysekhar; Kraus, Martin F.; Connolly, James L.; Hornegger, Joachim; Cable, Alex; Fujimoto, James G.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe demonstrate high speed, swept source optical coherence microscopy (OCM) using a MEMS tunable vertical cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) light source. The light source had a sweep rate of 280 kHz, providing a bidirectional axial scan rate of 560 kHz. The sweep bandwidth was 117 nm centered at 1310 nm, corresponding to an axial resolution of 13.1 Âµm in air, corresponding to 8.1 Âµm (9.6 Âµm spectrally shaped) in tissue. Dispersion mismatch from different objectives was compensated numerically, enabling magnification and field of view to be easily changed. OCM images were acquired with transverse resolutions between 0.86 Âµm - 3.42 Âµm using interchangeable 40X, 20X and 10X objectives with ~600 Âµm x 600 Âµm, ~1 mm x 1 mm and ~2 mm x 2 mm field-of-view (FOV), respectively. Parasitic variations in path length with beam scanning were corrected numerically. These features enable swept source OCM to be integrated with a wide range of existing scanning microscopes. Large FOV mosaics were generated by serially acquiring adjacent overlapping microscopic fields and combining them in post-processing. Fresh human colon, thyroid and kidney specimens were imaged ex vivo and compared to matching histology sections, demonstrating the ability of OCM to image tissue specimens.

When combined with optical coherence tomography (OCT), SLO enables real-time aiming and retinal tracking and provides complementary information for post-acquisition volumetric co-registration, bulk motion compensation, and averaging. However, multimodality SLO-OCT systems generally require dedicated light sources, scanners, relay optics, detectors, and additional digitization and synchronization electronics, which increase system complexity. Here, we present a multimodal ophthalmic imaging system using swept-source spectrally encoded scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography (SS-SESLO-OCT) for in vivo human retinal imaging. SESLO reduces the complexity of en face imaging systems by multiplexing spatial positions as a function of wavelength. SESLO image quality benefited from single-mode illumination and multimode collection through a prototype double-clad fiber coupler, which optimized scattered light throughput and reduce speckle contrast while maintaining lateral resolution. Using a shared 1060 nm swept-source, shared scanner and imaging optics, and a shared dual-channel high-speed digitizer, we acquired inherently co-registered en face retinal images and OCT cross-sections simultaneously at 200 frames-per-second.

This technique differs from previously reported buffering techniques in that it employs a fast optical switch, capable of switching in 60 ns, instead of a fused fiber coupler at the end of the buffering stage, and is therefore appreciably more power efficient. The use of the switch also eliminates patient exposure to light that is not used for imaging that occurs at the end of the laser sweep, thereby increasing the system sensitivity. We also describe how careful management of polarization can remove undesirable artifacts due to polarization mode dispersion. In addition, we demonstrate how numerical compensation techniques can be used to modify the signal from a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) clock obtained from the original sweep to recalibrate the buffered sweep, thereby reducing the complexity of systems employing lasers with integrated MZI clocks. Combining these methods, we constructed an SSOCT system employing an Axsun technologies laser with a sweep rate of 100kHz and 6dB imaging range of 5.5mm. The sweep rate was doubled with sweep buffering to 200 kHz, and the imaging depth was extended to 9 mm using coherence revival. We demonstrated the feasibility of this system by acquiring images of the anterior segments and retinas of healthy human volunteers.

Currently, only low resolution microscopy is employed to perform this assessment. Although this method delivers some information on the embryo surface morphology, no specific details are shown related to its inner structure. Using a Master-Slave Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography (SS-OCT), images of bovine embryos from day 7 after fertilization were collected from different depths. The dynamic changes inside the embryos were examined, in detail and in real-time from several depths. To prove our ability to characterize the morphology, a single embryo was imaged over 26 hours. The embryo was deprived of its life support environment, leading to its death. Over this period, clear morphological changes were observed.\n\nSilver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a contrast agent for imaging of animal tissue using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMondal, Indranil; Raj, Shipra; Roy, Poulomi; Poddar, Raju\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe present noninvasive three-dimensional depth-resolved imaging of animal tissue with a swept-source optical coherence tomography system at 1064ânm center wavelength and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a potential contrast agent. A swept-source laser light source is used to enable an imaging rate of 100âkHz (100â000 A-scans s-1). Swept-source optical coherence tomography is a new variant of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) technique, offering unique advantages in terms of sensitivity, reduction of motion artifacts, etc. To enhance the contrast of an OCT image, AgNPs are utilized as an exogeneous contrast agent. AgNPs are synthesized using a modified Tollens method and characterization is done by UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. In vitro imaging of chicken breast tissue, with and without the application of AgNPs, is performed. The effect of AgNPs is studied with different exposure times. A mathematical model is also built to calculate changes in the local scattering coefficient of tissue from OCT images. A quantitative estimation of scattering coefficient and contrast is performed for tissues with and without application of AgNPs. Significant improvement in contrast and increase in scattering coefficient with time is observed.\n\nSwept-source optical coherence tomography of lower limb wound healing with histopathological correlation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarui, Ananya; Banerjee, Provas; Patra, Rusha; Das, Raunak Kumar; Dhara, Santanu; Dutta, Pranab K.; Chatterjee, Jyotirmoy\n\n2011-02-01\n\nDirect noninvasive visualization of wound bed with depth information is important to understand the tissue repair. We correlate skin swept-source-optical coherence tomography (OCT) with histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation on traumatic lower limb wounds under honey dressing to compare and assess the tissue repair features acquired noninvasively and invasively. Analysis of optical biopsy identifies an uppermost brighter band for stratum corneum with region specific thickness (p < 0.0001) and gray-level intensity (p < 0.0001) variation. Below the stratum corneum, variation in optical intensities is remarkable in different regions of the wound bed. Correlation between OCT and microscopic observations are explored especially in respect to progressive growth and maturation of the epithelial and subepithelial components. Characteristic transition of uniform hypolucid band in OCT image for depigmented zone to wavy highly lucid band in the pigmented zone could be directly correlated with the microscopic findings. The transformation of prematured epithelium of depigmented area, with low expression of E-cadherin, to matured epithelium with higher E-cadherin expression in pigmented zone, implicated plausible change in their optical properties as depicted in OCT. This correlated evaluation of multimodal images demonstrates applicability of swept-source-OCT in wound research and importance of integrated approach in validation of new technology.\n\nSwept-source anatomic optical coherence elastography of porcine trachea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBu, Ruofei; Price, Hillel; Mitran, Sorin; Zdanski, Carlton; Oldenburg, Amy L.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nQuantitative endoscopic imaging is at the vanguard of novel techniques in the assessment upper airway obstruction. Anatomic optical coherence tomography (aOCT) has the potential to provide the geometry of the airway lumen with high-resolution and in 4 dimensions. By coupling aOCT with measurements of pressure, optical coherence elastography (OCE) can be performed to characterize airway wall stiffness. This can aid in identifying regions of dynamic collapse as well as informing computational fluid dynamics modeling to aid in surgical decision-making. Toward this end, here we report on an anatomic optical coherence tomography (aOCT) system powered by a wavelength-swept laser source. The system employs a fiber-optic catheter with outer diameter of 0.82 mm deployed via the bore of a commercial, flexible bronchoscope. Helical scans are performed to measure the airway geometry and to quantify the cross-sectional-area (CSA) of the airway. We report on a preliminary validation of aOCT for elastography, in which aOCT-derived CSA was obtained as a function of pressure to estimate airway wall compliance. Experiments performed on a Latex rubber tube resulted in a compliance measurement of 0.68+/-0.02 mm2/cmH2O, with R2=0.98 over the pressure range from 10 to 40 cmH2O. Next, ex vivo porcine trachea was studied, resulting in a measured compliance from 1.06+/-0.12 to 3.34+/-0.44 mm2/cmH2O, (R2>0.81). The linearity of the data confirms the elastic nature of the airway. The compliance values are within the same order-of-magnitude as previous measurements of human upper airways, suggesting that this system is capable of assessing airway wall compliance in future human studies.\n\nSWEPT-SOURCE OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALS INTERNAL LIMITING MEMBRANE PEELING ALTERS DEEP RETINAL VASCULATURE.\n\nPubMed\n\nMichalewska, Zofia; Nawrocki, Jerzy\n\n2018-04-30\n\nTo describe morphology of retinal and choroidal vessels in swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography before and after vitrectomy with the temporal inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique for full-thickness macular holes. Prospective, observational study of 36 eyes of 33 patients with full-thickness macular holes swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography was performed in patients before and 1 month after vitrectomy. Vitrectomy with the temporal inverted ILM flap technique was performed. In this method, ILM is peeled only at one side of the fovea. An ILM flap is created to cover the macular hole. Comparison of retina vasculature in the areas of ILM peeling vs. no ILM peeling at 1 and 3 months after successful vitrectomy was performed. The study demonstrated lower density of vessels in the deep retinal plexus in the area where ILM was peeled as compared to the rest of the fovea. Visual acuity and central retinal thickness 1 month after surgery correlates with fovea avascular zone diameter in deep retinal layers at the same time point (P = 0.001). This study confirmed that ILM peeling might alter blood flow in deep retinal vessels below the peeling area in the early postoperative period. The area of the fovea avascular zone corresponds to functional results at the same time point.\n\nUltrahigh phase-stable swept-source optical coherence tomography as a cardiac imaging platform (Conference Presentation)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLing, Yuye; Hendon, Christine P.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nFunctional extensions to optical coherence tomography (OCT) provide useful imaging contrasts that are complementary to conventional OCT. Our goal is to characterize tissue types within the myocardial due to remodeling and therapy. High-speed imaging is necessary to extract mechanical properties and dynamics of fiber orientation changes in a beating heart. Functional extensions of OCT such as polarization sensitive and optical coherence elastography (OCE) require high phase stability of the system, which is a drawback of current mechanically tuned swept source OCT systems. Here we present a high-speed functional imaging platform, which includes an ultrahigh-phase-stable swept source equipped with KTN deflector from NTT-AT. The swept source does not require mechanical movements during the wavelength sweeping; it is electrically tuned. The inter-sweep phase variance of the system was measured to be less than 300 ps at a path length difference of ~2 mm. The axial resolution of the system is 20 Âµm and the -10 dB fall-off depth is about 3.2 mm. The sample arm has an 8 mmx8 mm field of view with a lateral resolution of approximately 18 Âµm. The sample arm uses a two-axis MEMS mirror, which is programmable and capable of scanning arbitrary patterns at a sampling rate of 50 kHz. Preliminary imaging results showed differences in polarization properties and image penetration in ablated and normal myocardium. In the future, we will conduct dynamic stretching experiments with strips of human myocardial tissue to characterize mechanical properties using OCE. With high speed imaging of 200 kHz and an all-fiber design, we will work towards catheter-based functional imaging.\n\nMethod to calibrate phase fluctuation in polarization-sensitive swept-source optical coherence tomography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLu, Zenghai; Kasaragod, Deepa K.; Matcher, Stephen J.\n\n2011-07-01\n\nWe present a phase fluctuation calibration method for polarization-sensitive swept-source optical coherence tomography (PS-SS-OCT) using continuous polarization modulation. The method uses a low-voltage broadband polarization modulator driven by a synchronized sinusoidal burst waveform rather than an asynchronous waveform, together with the removal of the global phases of the measured Jones matrices by the use of matrix normalization. This makes it possible to average the measured Jones matrices to remove the artifact due to the speckle noise of the signal in the sample without introducing auxiliary optical components into the sample arm. This method was validated on measurements of an equine tendon sample by the PS-SS-OCT system.\n\nDefect inspection of actuator lenses using swept-source optical coherence tomography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, Jaeyul; Shirazi, Muhammad Faizan; Park, Kibeom; Jeon, Mansik; Kim, Jeehyun\n\n2017-12-01\n\nActuator lens industries have gained an enormous interest with the enhancement of various latest communication devices, such as mobile phone and notebooks. The quality of the aforementioned devices can be degraded due to the internal defects of actuator lenses. Therefore, in this study, we implemented swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) system to inspect defects of actuator lenses. Owing to the high-resolution of the SS-OCT system, defected foreign substances between the actuator lenses, defective regions of lenses and surface stains were more clearly distinguished through three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional OCT images. Therefore, the implemented SS-OCT system can be considered as a potential application to defect inspection of actuator lens.\n\nPhase-sensitive optical coherence tomography-based vibrometry using a highly phase-stable akinetic swept laser source\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nApplegate, Brian E.; Park, Jesung; Carbajal, Esteban\n\nPhase-sensitive Optical Coherence Tomography (PhOCT) is an emerging tool for in vivo investigation of the vibratory function of the intact middle and inner ear. PhOCT is able to resolve micron scale tissue morphology in three dimensions as well as measure picometer scale motion at each spatial position. Most PhOCT systems to date have relied upon the phase stability offered by spectrometer detection. On the other hand swept laser source based PhOCT offers a number of advantages including balanced detection, long imaging depths, and high imaging speeds. Unfortunately the inherent phase instability of traditional swept laser sources has necessitated complex usermoreÂ Â» developed hardware/software solutions to restore phase sensitivity. Here we present recent results using a prototype swept laser that overcomes these issues. The akinetic swept laser is electronically tuned and precisely controls sweeps without any mechanical movement, which results in high phase stability. We have developed an optical fiber based PhOCT system around the akinetic laser source that had a 1550 nm center wavelength and a sweep rate of 140 kHz. The stability of the system was measured to be 4.4 pm with a calibrated reflector, thus demonstrating near shot noise limited performance. Using this PhOCT system, we have acquired structural and vibratory measurements of the middle ear in a mouse model, post mortem. The quality of the results suggest that the akinetic laser source is a superior laser source for PhOCT with many advantages that greatly reduces the required complexity of the imaging system.Â«Â less\n\nEndoscopic Full-Field Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography Neuroimaging System\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFelts Almog, Ilan\n\nOptical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has the capability to differentiate brain elements with intrinsic contrast and at a resolution an order-of-magnitude higher than other imaging modalities. This thesis investigates the feasibility of OCT for neuroimaging applied to neurosurgical guidance. We present, to our knowledge, the first Full-Field Swept-Source OCT system operating near a wavelength of 1310 nm, achieving a transverse imaging resolution of 6.5 mum, an axial resolution of 14 mum in tissue and a field of view of 270 mum x 180 mum x 400 mum. Imaging experiments were performed on rat brain tissues ex vivo, human cortical tissue ex vivo, and rats in vivo. A multi-level threshold metric applied on the intensity of the images led to a plausible correlation between the observed density and location in the brain. The proof-of-concept OCT system can be improved and miniaturized for clinical use.\n\nAll fiber optics circular-state swept source polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Hermann; Kao, Meng-Chun; Lai, Chih-Ming; Huang, Jyun-Cin; Kuo, Wen-Chuan\n\n2014-02-01\n\nA swept source (SS)-based circular-state (CS) polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) constructed entirely with polarization-maintaining fiber optics components is proposed with the experimental verification. By means of the proposed calibration scheme, bulk quarter-wave plates can be replaced by fiber optics polarization controllers to, therefore, realize an all-fiber optics CS SSPS-OCT. We also present a numerical dispersion compensation method, which can not only enhance the axial resolution, but also improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the images. We demonstrate that this compact and portable CS SSPS-OCT system with an accuracy comparable to bulk optics systems requires less stringent lens alignment and can possibly serve as a technology to realize PS-OCT instrument for clinical applications (e.g., endoscopy). The largest deviations in the phase retardation (PR) and fast-axis (FA) angle due to sample probe in the linear scanning and a rotation angle smaller than 65 deg were of the same order as those in stationary probe setups. The influence of fiber bending on the measured PR and FA is also investigated. The largest deviations of the PR were 3.5 deg and the measured FA change by ~12 to 21 deg. Finally, in vivo imaging of the human fingertip and nail was successfully demonstrated with a linear scanning probe.\n\nA linearly frequency-swept high-speed-rate multi-wavelength laser for optical coherence tomography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Qiyu; Wang, Zhaoying; Yuan, Quan; Ma, Rui; Du, Tao; Yang, Tianxin\n\n2017-02-01\n\nWe proposed and demonstrated a linearly frequency-swept multi-wavelength laser source for optical coherence tomography (OCT) eliminating the need of wavenumber space resampling in the postprocessing progress. The source consists of a multi-wavelength fiber laser source (MFS) and an optical sweeping loop. In this novel laser source, an equally spaced multi-wavelength laser is swept simultaneously by a certain step each time in the frequency domain in the optical sweeping loop. The sweeping step is determined by radio frequency (RF) signal which can be precisely controlled. Thus the sweeping behavior strictly maintains a linear relationship between time and frequency. We experimentally achieved linear time-frequency sweeping at a sweeping rate of 400 kHz with our laser source.\n\nIncreasing signal-to-noise ratio of swept-source optical coherence tomography by oversampling in k-space\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNagib, Karim; Mezgebo, Biniyam; Thakur, Rahul; Fernando, Namal; Kordi, Behzad; Sherif, Sherif\n\n2018-03-01\n\nOptical coherence tomography systems suffer from noise that could reduce ability to interpret reconstructed images correctly. We describe a method to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of swept-source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) using oversampling in k-space. Due to this oversampling, information redundancy would be introduced in the measured interferogram that could be used to reduce white noise in the reconstructed A-scan. We applied our novel scaled nonuniform discrete Fourier transform to oversampled SS-OCT interferograms to reconstruct images of a salamander egg. The peak-signal-to-noise (PSNR) between the reconstructed images using interferograms sampled at 250MS/s andz50MS/s demonstrate that this oversampling increased the signal-to-noise ratio by 25.22 dB.\n\nULTRAHIGH SPEED SWEPT SOURCE OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY OF RETINAL AND CHORIOCAPILLARIS ALTERATIONS IN DIABETIC PATIENTS WITH AND WITHOUT RETINOPATHY.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, WooJhon; Waheed, Nadia K; Moult, Eric M; Adhi, Mehreen; Lee, ByungKun; De Carlo, Talisa; Jayaraman, Vijaysekhar; Baumal, Caroline R; Duker, Jay S; Fujimoto, James G\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTo investigate the utility of ultrahigh speed, swept source optical coherence tomography angiography in visualizing retinal microvascular and choriocapillaris (CC) changes in diabetic patients. The study was prospective and cross-sectional. A 1,050 nm wavelength, 400 kHz A-scan rate swept source optical coherence tomography prototype was used to perform volumetric optical coherence tomography angiography of the retinal and CC vasculatures in diabetic patients and normal subjects. Sixty-three eyes from 32 normal subjects, 9 eyes from 7 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 29 eyes from 16 patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, and 51 eyes from 28 diabetic patients without retinopathy were imaged. Retinal and CC microvascular abnormalities were observed in all stages of diabetic retinopathy. In nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, optical coherence tomography angiography visualized a variety of vascular abnormalities, including clustered capillaries, dilated capillary segments, tortuous capillaries, regions of capillary dropout, reduced capillary density, abnormal capillary loops, and foveal avascular zone enlargement. In proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinal neovascularization above the inner limiting membrane was visualized. Regions of CC flow impairment in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy were also observed. In 18 of the 51 of eyes from diabetic patients without retinopathy, retinal mircrovascular abnormalities were observed and CC flow impairment was found in 24 of the 51 diabetic eyes without retinopathy. The ability of optical coherence tomography angiography to visualize retinal and CC microvascular abnormalities suggests it may be a useful tool for understanding pathogenesis, evaluating treatment response, and earlier detection of vascular abnormalities in patients with diabetes.\n\nReal-time speckle variance swept-source optical coherence tomography using a graphics processing unit.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Kenneth K C; Mariampillai, Adrian; Yu, Joe X Z; Cadotte, David W; Wilson, Brian C; Standish, Beau A; Yang, Victor X D\n\n2012-07-01\n\nAdvances in swept source laser technology continues to increase the imaging speed of swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) systems. These fast imaging speeds are ideal for microvascular detection schemes, such as speckle variance (SV), where interframe motion can cause severe imaging artifacts and loss of vascular contrast. However, full utilization of the laser scan speed has been hindered by the computationally intensive signal processing required by SS-OCT and SV calculations. Using a commercial graphics processing unit that has been optimized for parallel data processing, we report a complete high-speed SS-OCT platform capable of real-time data acquisition, processing, display, and saving at 108,000 lines per second. Subpixel image registration of structural images was performed in real-time prior to SV calculations in order to reduce decorrelation from stationary structures induced by the bulk tissue motion. The viability of the system was successfully demonstrated in a high bulk tissue motion scenario of human fingernail root imaging where SV images (512 Ã 512 pixels, n = 4) were displayed at 54 frames per second.\n\nA method to calibrate phase fluctuation in polarization-sensitive swept-source optical coherence tomography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLu, Zenghai; Kasaragod, Deepa K.; Matcher, Stephen J.\n\n2011-06-01\n\nA phase fluctuation calibration method is presented for polarization-sensitive swept-source optical coherence tomography (PS-SS-OCT) using continuous polarization modulation. The method consists of the generation of a continuous triggered tone-burst waveform rather than an asynchronous waveform by use of a function generator and the removal of the global phases of the measured Jones matrices by use of matrix normalization. This could remove the use of auxiliary optical components for the phase fluctuation compensation in the system, which reduces the system complexity. Phase fluctuation calibration is necessary to obtain the reference Jones matrix by averaging the measured Jones matrices at sample surfaces. Measurements on an equine tendon sample were made by the PS-SS-OCT system to validate the proposed method.\n\nIn vivo volumetric depth-resolved vasculature imaging of human limbus and sclera with 1 Î¼m swept source phase-variance optical coherence angiography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPoddar, Raju; Zawadzki, Robert J.; CortÃ©s, Dennis E.; Mannis, Mark J.; Werner, John S.\n\n2015-06-01\n\nWe present in vivo volumetric depth-resolved vasculature images of the anterior segment of the human eye acquired with phase-variance based motion contrast using a high-speed (100 kHz, 105 A-scans/s) swept source optical coherence tomography system (SSOCT). High phase stability SSOCT imaging was achieved by using a computationally efficient phase stabilization approach. The human corneo-scleral junction and sclera were imaged with swept source phase-variance optical coherence angiography and compared with slit lamp images from the same eyes of normal subjects. Different features of the rich vascular system in the conjunctiva and episclera were visualized and described. This system can be used as a potential tool for ophthalmological research to determine changes in the outflow system, which may be helpful for identification of abnormalities that lead to glaucoma.\n\nSuprachoroidal layer and suprachoroidal space delineating the outer margin of the choroid in swept-source optical coherence tomography.\n\nPubMed\n\nMichalewska, Zofia; Michalewski, Janusz; Nawrocka, Zofia; Dulczewska-Cichecka, Karolina; Nawrocki, Jerzy\n\n2015-02-01\n\nTo define the morphology of outer choroidal margins in swept-source optical coherence tomography. This is a prospective observational study of 180 eyes: 20 eyes of healthy volunteers, 20 eyes of myopic patients, and 20 eyes from each of the following groups: macular hole, lamellar macular hole, epiretinal membranes, drusen, dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), neovascular AMD, and vitreomacular traction. A single 12-mm wide swept-source optical coherence tomography image for each of the examined eyes consisting of 1,024 A-scans has been created. The main outcome measure selected was to estimate the presence of suprachoroidal layer, as well as to estimate the ability to delineate the outer choroidoscleral boundary using the software available (DRI-OCT) and to determine its shape. Suprachoroidal layer was observed in 5% of healthy emmetropic eyes, in 50% of eyes with full-thickness macular holes, and in 60% of eyes with vitreomacular traction syndrome. It was also present in 50% of eyes with dry AMD and in 20% of eyes with neovascular AMD. The outer margin of the choroid in all eyes of the healthy volunteers and in eyes with macular diseases has been delineated correctly. In all healthy and myopic eyes, we recognized the outer choroidoscleral boundary as having a regular shape following the natural oval contour of the globe. In eyes with epiretinal membranes, macular hole, vitreomacular traction, and AMD, the outer choroidoscleral boundary was irregular; the choroid varied in thickness from point to point. Swept-source optical coherence tomography enables exact visualization of the outer choroidoscleral boundary. Suprachoroidal layer consisting of two bands has been recognized, the upper of which is hyperreflective and the lower of which is hyporeflective. It may be supposed that the lower hyporeflective band corresponds to suprachoroidal space, which was not earlier visualized in vivo in eyes without choroidal effusion. Suprachoroidal layer in myopic and\n\nSwept source optical coherence tomography of objects with arbitrary reflectivity profiles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMezgebo, Biniyam; Nagib, Karim; Fernando, Namal; Kordi, Behzad; Sherif, Sherif\n\n2018-03-01\n\nSwept Source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) has become a well established imaging modality for both medical and industrial diagnostic applications. A cross-sectional SS-OCT image is obtained by applying an inverse discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to axial interferogram measured in the frequency domain (k-space). Fourier inversion of the obtained interferogram typically produces a potentially overlapping conjugate mirror image, whose overlap could be avoided by restricting the object to have its highest reflectivity at its surface. However, this restriction may not be fulfilled when imaging a very thin object that is placed on a highly reflective surface, or imaging an object containing a contrast agent with high reflectivity. In this paper, we show that oversampling of the SS-OCT signal in k-space would overcome the need for such restriction on the object. Our result is demonstrated using SS-OCT images of Axolotl salamander eggs.\n\nMultimodal ophthalmic imaging using swept source spectrally encoded scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMalone, Joseph D.; El-Haddad, Mohamed T.; Tye, Logan A.; Majeau, Lucas; Godbout, Nicolas; Rollins, Andrew M.; Boudoux, Caroline; Tao, Yuankai K.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nScanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) benefit clinical diagnostic imaging in ophthalmology by enabling in vivo noninvasive en face and volumetric visualization of retinal structures, respectively. Spectrally encoding methods enable confocal imaging through fiber optics and reduces system complexity. Previous applications in ophthalmic imaging include spectrally encoded confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SECSLO) and a combined SECSLO-OCT system for image guidance, tracking, and registration. However, spectrally encoded imaging suffers from speckle noise because each spectrally encoded channel is effectively monochromatic. Here, we demonstrate in vivo human retinal imaging using a swept source spectrally encoded scanning laser ophthalmoscope and OCT (SSSESLO- OCT) at 1060 nm. SS-SESLO-OCT uses a shared 100 kHz Axsun swept source, shared scanner and imaging optics, and are detected simultaneously on a shared, dual channel high-speed digitizer. SESLO illumination and detection was performed using the single mode core and multimode inner cladding of a double clad fiber coupler, respectively, to preserve lateral resolution while improving collection efficiency and reducing speckle contrast at the expense of confocality. Concurrent en face SESLO and cross-sectional OCT images were acquired with 1376 x 500 pixels at 200 frames-per-second. Our system design is compact and uses a shared light source, imaging optics, and digitizer, which reduces overall system complexity and ensures inherent co-registration between SESLO and OCT FOVs. En face SESLO images acquired concurrent with OCT cross-sections enables lateral motion tracking and three-dimensional volume registration with broad applications in multivolume OCT averaging, image mosaicking, and intraoperative instrument tracking.\n\nQuantitative evaluation of dental abfraction and attrition using a swept-source optical coherence tomography system.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarcauteanu, Corina; Bradu, Adrian; Sinescu, Cosmin; Topala, Florin Ionel; Negrutiu, Meda Lavinia; Podoleanu, Adrian Gh\n\n2014-02-01\n\nA fast swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) system is employed to acquire volumes of dental tissue, in order to monitor the temporal evolution of dental wear. An imaging method is developed to evaluate the volume of tissue lost in ex vivo artificially induced abfractions and attritions. The minimal volume (measured in air) that our system could measure is 2352 Î¼m3. A volume of 25,000 A-scans is collected in 2.5 s. All these recommend the SS-OCT method as a valuable tool for dynamic evaluation of the abfraction and attrition with remarkable potential for clinical use.\n\nVolumetric cutaneous microangiography of human skin in vivo by VCSEL swept-source optical coherence tomography\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWoo June Choi; Wang, R K\n\n2014-08-31\n\nWe demonstrate volumetric cutaneous microangiography of the human skin in vivo that utilises 1.3-Î¼m high-speed sweptsource optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). The swept source is based on a micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS)-tunable vertical cavity surface emission laser (VCSEL) that is advantageous in terms of long coherence length over 50 mm and 100 nm spectral bandwidth, which enables the visualisation of microstructures within a few mm from the skin surface. We show that the skin microvasculature can be delineated in 3D SS-OCT images using ultrahigh-sensitive optical microangiography (UHS-OMAG) with a correlation mapping mask, providing a contrast enhanced blood perfusion map with capillary flow sensitivity.moreÂ Â» 3D microangiograms of a healthy human finger are shown with distinct cutaneous vessel architectures from different dermal layers and even within hypodermis.

Methods A wide field of view swept source OCT (WFOV SSOCT) system was developed using a commercial swept source laser and a custom sample arm consisting of two indirect ophthalmic lenses. Twenty-seven subjects with peripheral lesions (choroidal melanomas, choroidal nevii, sclerochoroidal calcification, retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy, retinoschisis, and uveitis) were imaged with the WFOV SSOCT. Volumes were taken in primary gaze. Using the optic nerve to fovea distance as a reference measurement, comparisons were made between the lateral field of view (FOV) of the WFOV SSOCT, current generation spectral domain OCT (SDOCT), and widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) of the same eyes. Results Peripheral pathologies were captured with WFOV SSOCT in 26 of the 27 subjects. The one not captured was in the far nasal periphery and was not seen in the primary gaze volume. Posterior pole associated pathologies were captured in all subjects. Current generation SDOCT had a mean lateral FOV of 2.08 Â± 0.21 optic nerve-to-fovea distance units, WFOV SSOCT had a FOV of 4.62 Â± 0.62 units, and SLO had a FOV of 9.35 Â± 1.02 units. Conclusion WFOV OCT can be used to examine both peripheral retinal pathology and the posterior pole within a single volume acquisition. SLO had the greatest FOV, but does not provide depth information. Future studies using widefield OCT systems will help further delineate the role of WFOV OCT to quantitatively assess and monitor peripheral retinal disease in three dimensions.

We present preliminary in vitro measurement results for quantification of the 3D velocity vector of scatterers in a flow phantom. The absolute flow velocity of moving scatterers can be obtained without prior knowledge of flow orientation. In contrast to previous spectral domain (SD-) D-OCT investigations, that already proved the three-channel D-OCT approach to be suitable for in vivo retinal blood flow evaluation, this current work aims for a similar functional approach by means of a differing technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first three-channel D-OCT setup featuring a wavelength tunable laser source. Furthermore, we present a modification of our setup allowing a reduction of the former three active illumination channels to one active illumination channel and two passive channels, which only probe the illuminated sample. This joint aperture (JA) approach provides the advantage of not having to divide beam power among three beams to meet corresponding laser safety limits. The in vitro measurement results regarding the flow phantom show good agreement between theoretically calculated and experimentally obtained flow velocity values.\n\nComparison of ocular biometric measurements between a new swept-source optical coherence tomography and a common optical low coherence reflectometry.\n\nPubMed\n\nGao, Rongrong; Chen, Hao; Savini, Giacomo; Miao, Yaxin; Wang, Xiaorui; Yang, Jing; Zhao, Weiqi; Wang, Qinmei; Huang, Jinhai\n\n2017-05-30\n\nThe purpose of the current study was to compare the measurements between a new optical biometer based on swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT), the OA-2000 (Tomey, Japan), and an optical biometer based on optical low coherence reflectometry (OLCR), the Lenstar (Haag-Streit, Switzerland). Ninety-nine eyes of 99 healthy subjects were included. The axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), aqueous depth (AD), lens thickness (LT), keratometry (K) readings, including flat K (Kf), steep K (Ks), mean K (Km), astigmatism vectors J 0 , J 45 at diameters of 2.5 and 3.0âmm, and white-to-white diameter (WTW) were measured three times each using both biometer in normal eyes by random sequence. Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the SS-OCT and OLCR devices for AL, AD, ACD, LT, with narrow 95% LoA (-0.05 to 0.07âmm, -0.09 to 0.10âmm, -0.10 to 0.09âmm, and -0.06 to 0.22âmm, respectively), and the P values of ACD were both >0.05. The CCT, Kf, Ks, Km, J 0 , J 45 and WTW values provided by the OA-2000 were in good agreement with the Lenstar, and statistically significant differences were detected for some of them but not clinical differences. The agreement was excellent especially for AL.\n\nLongitudinal Evaluation of Cornea With Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography and Scheimpflug Imaging Before and After Lasik\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChan, Tommy C.Y.; Biswas, Sayantan; Yu, Marco; Jhanji, Vishal\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract Swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the latest advancement in anterior segment imaging. There are limited data regarding its performance after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). We compared the reliability of swept-source OCT and Scheimpflug imaging for evaluation of corneal parameters in refractive surgery candidates with myopia or myopic astigmatism. Three consecutive measurements were obtained preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively using swept-source OCT and Scheimpflug imaging. The study parameters included central corneal thickness (CCT), thinnest corneal thickness (TCT), keratometry at steep (Ks) and flat (Kf) axes, mean keratometry (Km), and, anterior and posterior best fit spheres (Ant and Post BFS). The main outcome measures included reliability of measurements before and after LASIK was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and reproducibility coefficients (RC). Association between the mean value of corneal parameters with age, spherical equivalent (SEQ), and residual bed thickness (RBT) and association of variance heterogeneity of corneal parameters and these covariates were analyzed. Twenty-six right eyes of 26 participants (mean age, 32.7âÂ±â6.9 yrs; mean SEQ, â6.27âÂ±â1.67 D) were included. Preoperatively, swept-source OCT demonstrated significantly higher ICC for Ks, CCT, TCT, and Post BFS (Pââ¤â0.016), compared with Scheimpflug imaging. Swept-source OCT demonstrated significantly smaller RC values for CCT, TCT, and Post BFS (Pââ¤â0.001). After LASIK, both devices had significant differences in measurements for all corneal parameters (Pââ¤â0.015). Swept-source OCT demonstrated a significantly higher ICC and smaller RC for all measurements, compared with Scheimpflug imaging (Pââ¤â0.001). Association of variance heterogeneity was only found in pre-LASIK Ant BFS and post-LASIK Post BFS for swept-source OCT, whereas significant association of variance heterogeneity was noted\n\nOptic axis determination by fibre-based polarization-sensitive swept-source optical coherence tomography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLu, Zenghai; Kasaragod, Deepa K.; Matcher, Stephen J.\n\n2011-02-01\n\nWe describe a fibre-based variable-incidence angle (VIA) polarization-sensitive swept-source optical coherence tomography (PS-SS-OCT) system to determine the 3D optical axis of birefringent biological tissues. Single-plane VIA-PS-OCT is also explored which requires measurement of the absolute fast-axis orientation. A state-of-the-art PS-SS-OCT system with some improvements both in hardware and software was used to determine the apparent optical birefringence of equine tendon for a number of different illumination directions. Polar and azimuthal angles of cut equine tendon were produced by the VIA method and compared with the nominal values. A quarter waveplate (QWP) and equine tendon were used as test targets to validate the fast-axis measurements using the system. Polar and azimuthal angles of cut equine tendon broadly agreed with the expected values within about 8% of the nominal values. A theoretical and experimental analysis of the effect of the sample arm fibre on determination of optical axis orientation using a proposed definition based on the orientation of the eigenpolarization ellipse experimentally confirms that this algorithm only works correctly for special settings of the sample arm fibre. A proposed algorithm based on the angle between Stokes vectors on the PoincarÃ© sphere is confirmed to work for all settings of the sample arm fibre. A calibration procedure is proposed to remove the sign ambiguity of the measured orientation and was confirmed experimentally by using the QWP.\n\nOptic axis determination by fiber-based polarization-sensitive swept-source optical coherence tomography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLu, Zenghai; Kasaragod, Deepa K.; Matcher, Stephen J.\n\n2011-03-01\n\nWe describe a fiber-based variable-incidence-angle (VIA) polarization-sensitive swept-source optical coherence tomography (PS-SS-OCT) system to determine the 3-D optical axis of birefringent biological tissues.

Cross-sectional analysis of 156 eyes (107 neovascular age-related macular degeneration and 49 dry AMD) in 98 patients, previously diagnosed by multimodal imaging using fluorescein (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (Heidelberg's Spectralis) in a tertiary retina center, evaluated by SS-OCTA 4.5 mm Ã 4.5 mm and 6 mm Ã 6 mm macular cubes. Main outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of SS-OCTA in AMD. Potential factors influencing CNV detection rate were analyzed. Swept source optical coherence tomography angiography detected CNV in 81 of 107 eyes, resulting in a sensitivity of 75.7%. In 49 eyes with dry AMD, no CNV could be identified (specificity 100%). A statistical significance was calculated for nondetection of treatment-naive CNV by SS-OCTA in pigment epithelial detachment over 400 Î¼m (P = 0.0238). Topcon's SS-OCTA was not able to detect all CNV lesions. Large pigment epithelial detachments were associated with signal loss. Fluorescence angiography still remains the gold standard, but the tested SS-OCTA device can be considered as a feasible additional diagnostic tool in AMD.\n\nMultimodal swept-source spectrally encoded scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography at 400 kHz\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEl-Haddad, Mohamed T.; Joos, Karen M.; Patel, Shriji N.; Tao, Yuankai K.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nMultimodal imaging systems that combine scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have demonstrated the utility of concurrent en face and volumetric imaging for aiming, eye tracking, bulk motion compensation, mosaicking, and contrast enhancement. However, this additional functionality trades off with increased system complexity and cost because both SLO and OCT generally require dedicated light sources, galvanometer scanners, relay and imaging optics, detectors, and control and digitization electronics. We previously demonstrated multimodal ophthalmic imaging using swept-source spectrally encoded SLO and OCT (SS-SESLO-OCT). Here, we present system enhancements and a new optical design that increase our SS-SESLO-OCT data throughput by >7x and field-of-view (FOV) by >4x. A 200 kHz 1060 nm Axsun swept-source was optically buffered to 400 kHz sweep-rate, and SESLO and OCT were simultaneously digitized on dual input channels of a 4 GS/s digitizer at 1.2 GS/s per channel using a custom k-clock. We show in vivo human imaging of the anterior segment out to the limbus and retinal fundus over a >40Â° FOV. In addition, nine overlapping volumetric SS-SESLO-OCT volumes were acquired under video-rate SESLO preview and guidance. In post-processing, all nine SESLO images and en face projections of the corresponding OCT volumes were mosaicked to show widefield multimodal fundus imaging with a >80Â° FOV. Concurrent multimodal SS-SESLO-OCT may have applications in clinical diagnostic imaging by enabling aiming, image registration, and multi-field mosaicking and benefit intraoperative imaging by allowing for real-time surgical feedback, instrument tracking, and overlays of computationally extracted image-based surrogate biomarkers of disease.\n\nWide field and highly sensitive angiography based on optical coherence tomography with akinetic swept source.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Jingjiang; Song, Shaozhen; Wei, Wei; Wang, Ruikang K\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWide-field vascular visualization in bulk tissue that is of uneven surface is challenging due to the relatively short ranging distance and significant sensitivity fall-off for most current optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) systems. We report a long ranging and ultra-wide-field OCTA (UW-OCTA) system based on an akinetic swept laser. The narrow instantaneous linewidth of the swept source with its high phase stability, combined with high-speed detection in the system enable us to achieve long ranging (up to 46 mm) and almost negligible system sensitivity fall-off. To illustrate these advantages, we compare the basic system performances between conventional spectral domain OCTA and UW-OCTA systems and their functional imaging of microvascular networks in living tissues. In addition, we show that the UW-OCTA is capable of different depth-ranging of cerebral blood flow within entire brain in mice, and providing unprecedented blood perfusion map of human finger in vivo . We believe that the UW-OCTA system has promises to augment the existing clinical practice and explore new biomedical applications for OCT imaging.\n\nWide field and highly sensitive angiography based on optical coherence tomography with akinetic swept source\n\nPubMed Central\n\nXu, Jingjiang; Song, Shaozhen; Wei, Wei; Wang, Ruikang K.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWide-field vascular visualization in bulk tissue that is of uneven surface is challenging due to the relatively short ranging distance and significant sensitivity fall-off for most current optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) systems.

We report two cases of XLRS in the same family. The patients presented with bilateral blurred vision. The posterior segment examination showed a spoked-wheel pattern in the macula. SS-OCT cross-sectional images revealed widespread retinal splitting at the level of the inner nuclear layer bilaterally. We diagnosed XLRS. To evaluate the area of retinoschisis, we obtained en face SS-OCT images, which clearly visualized the area of retinoschisis seen as a sunflower-like structure in the macula. We report the findings on en face SS-OCT images from patients with XLRS. The en face images using SS-OCT showed the precise area of retinoschisis compared with the SS-OCT thickness map and are useful for managing patients with XLRS.\n\nScaled nonuniform Fourier transform for image reconstruction in swept source optical coherence tomography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMezgebo, Biniyam; Nagib, Karim; Fernando, Namal; Kordi, Behzad; Sherif, Sherif\n\n2018-02-01\n\nSwept Source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) is an important imaging modality for both medical and industrial diagnostic applications. A cross-sectional SS-OCT image is obtained by applying an inverse discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to axial interferograms measured in the frequency domain (k-space). This inverse DFT is typically implemented as a fast Fourier transform (FFT) that requires the data samples to be equidistant in k-space. As the frequency of light produced by a typical wavelength-swept laser is nonlinear in time, the recorded interferogram samples will not be uniformly spaced in k-space. Many image reconstruction methods have been proposed to overcome this problem. Most such methods rely on oversampling the measured interferogram then use either hardware, e.g., Mach-Zhender interferometer as a frequency clock module, or software, e.g., interpolation in k-space, to obtain equally spaced samples that are suitable for the FFT. To overcome the problem of nonuniform sampling in k-space without any need for interferogram oversampling, an earlier method demonstrated the use of the nonuniform discrete Fourier transform (NDFT) for image reconstruction in SS-OCT. In this paper, we present a more accurate method for SS-OCT image reconstruction from nonuniform samples in k-space using a scaled nonuniform Fourier transform. The result is demonstrated using SS-OCT images of Axolotl salamander eggs.\n\nRobot-assisted three-dimensional registration for cochlear implant surgery using a common-path swept-source optical coherence tomography probe\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGurbani, Saumya S.; Wilkening, Paul; Zhao, Mingtao; Gonenc, Berk; Cheon, Gyeong Woo; Iordachita, Iulian I.; Chien, Wade; Taylor, Russell H.; Niparko, John K.; Kang, Jin U.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nCochlear implantation offers the potential to restore sensitive hearing in patients with severe to profound deafness. However, surgical placement of the electrode array within the cochlea can produce trauma to sensorineural components, particularly if the initial turn of the cochlea is not successfully navigated as the array is advanced. In this work, we present a robot-mounted common-path swept-source optical coherence tomography endoscopic platform for three-dimensional (3-D) optical coherence tomography (OCT) registration and preoperative surgical planning for cochlear implant surgery. The platform is composed of a common-path 600-Î¼m diameter fiber optic rotary probe attached to a five degrees of freedom robot capable of 1 Î¼m precision movement. The system is tested on a dry fixed ex vivo human temporal bone, and we demonstrate the feasibility of a 3-D OCT registration of the cochlea to accurately describe the spatial and angular profiles of the canal formed by the scala tympani into the first cochlear turn.\n\nDetection of Apical Root Cracks Using Spectral Domain and Swept-source Optical Coherence Tomography.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Oliveira, Bruna Paloma; CÃ¢mara, AndrÃ©a Cruz; Duarte, Daniel Amancio; Gomes, Anderson Stevens Leonidas; Heck, Richard John; Antonino, Antonio Celso Dantas; Aguiar, Carlos Menezes\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThis study aimed to evaluate the ability of 2 optical coherence tomographic (OCT) systems to detect apical dentinal microcracks. Twenty extracted human single-rooted mandibular incisors were selected. After root canal preparation with an R40 Reciproc file (VDW, Munich, Germany), the specimens presenting apical microcracks were identified using micro-computed tomographic (micro-CT) scanning as the gold standard. Then, the apical portions of the roots were imaged with spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) and swept-source OCT systems, and the resulting images were blindly evaluated by 3 independent examiners to detect microcracks. The diagnostic performance of each OCT device was calculated, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on the micro-CT images, 12 (60%) roots presented dentinal microcracks in the apical region. The images generated by the OCT systems were able to show microcrack lines at the same location as the corresponding micro-CT cross sections. Although the diagnostic performance of the SD-OCT device was superior, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 OCT devices (PÂ >Â .05). Interexaminer agreement was substantial to almost perfect for the SD-OCT system and moderate to almost perfect for the swept-source OCT system, whereas intraexaminer agreement was substantial to almost perfect for both OCT devices. The detection ability verified for both OCT systems renders them promising tools for the diagnosis of apical microcracks. Copyright Â© 2017 American Association of Endodontists.

Y.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe proposed a sensitivity enhancement method of the interference-based signal detection approach and applied it on a swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) system through all-fiber optical parametric amplifier (FOPA) and parametric balanced detector (BD). The parametric BD was realized by combining the signal and phase conjugated idler band that was newly-generated through FOPA, and specifically by superimposing these two bands at a photodetector. The sensitivity enhancement by FOPA and parametric BD in SS-OCT were demonstrated experimentally. The results show that SS-OCT with FOPA and SS-OCT with parametric BD can provide more than 9 dB and 12 dB sensitivity improvement, respectively, when compared with the conventional SS-OCT in a spectral bandwidth spanning over 76 nm. To further verify and elaborate their sensitivity enhancement, a bio-sample imaging experiment was conducted on loach eyes by conventional SS-OCT setup, SS-OCT with FOPA and parametric BD at different illumination power levels. All these results proved that using FOPA and parametric BD could improve the sensitivity significantly in SS-OCT systems.

One of the project objectives is the development of new fabrication technologies for micro-optics, which makes it compatible to Micro-Opto-Electromechanical System technology (MOEMS). The basic system concept is a wafer-based Mirau interferometer array with an actuated reference mirror, which enables phase shifted interferogram detection and therefore reconstruction of the complex phase information, resulting in a higher measurement range with reduced image artifacts. This paper presents an experimental one-channel on-bench OCT system with bulk optics, which serves as a proof-of-concept setup for the final VIAMOS micro-system. It is based on a Linnik interferometer with a wavelength tuning light source and a camera for parallel A-Scan detection. Phase shifting interferometry techniques (PSI) are used for the suppression of the complex conjugate artifact, whose suppression reaches 36 dB. The sensitivity of the system is constant over the full-field with a mean value of 97 dB. OCT images are presented of a thin membrane microlens and a biological tissue (onion) as a preliminary demonstration.\n\nTuning of successively scanned two monolithic Vernier-tuned lasers and selective data sampling in optical comb swept source optical coherence tomography\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChoi, Dong-hak; Yoshimura, Reiko; Ohbayashi, Kohji\n\n2013-01-01\n\nMonolithic Vernier tuned super-structure grating distributed Bragg reflector (SSG-DBR) lasers are expected to become one of the most promising sources for swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) with a long coherence length, reduced sensitivity roll-off, and potential capability for a very fast A-scan rate. However, previous implementations of the lasers suffer from four main problems: 1) frequencies deviate from the targeted values when scanned, 2) large amounts of noise appear associated with abrupt changes in injection currents, 3) optically aliased noise appears due to a long coherence length, and 4) the narrow wavelength coverage of a single chip limits resolution. We have developed a method of dynamical frequency tuning, a method of selective data sampling to eliminate current switching noise, an interferometer to reduce aliased noise, and an excess-noise-free connection of two serially scanned lasers to enhance resolution to solve these problems. An optical frequency comb SS-OCT system was achieved with a sensitivity of 124 dB and a dynamic range of 55-72 dB that depended on the depth at an A-scan rate of 3.1 kHz with a resolution of 15 Î¼m by discretely scanning two SSG-DBR lasers, i.e., L-band (1.560-1.599 Î¼m) and UL-band (1.598-1.640 Î¼m). A few OCT images with excellent image penetration depth were obtained.

Methods Eighty eyes of 80 patients scheduled to undergo cataract surgery were examined with both biometers. The measurements made using each device were axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), aqueous depth (AQD), lens thickness (LT), mean keratometry (MK), white-to-white distance (WTW), and pupil diameter (PD). Holladay 2 and SRK/T formulas were used to calculate IOL power. Differences in measurement between the two biometers were determined using the paired t-test. Agreement was assessed through intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and BlandâAltman plots. Results Mean patient age was 76.3Â±6.8 years (range 59â89). Using the Lenstar, AL and PD could not be measured in 12.5 and 5.25% of eyes, respectively, while IOLMaster 700 took all measurements in all eyes. The variables CCT, AQD, LT, and MK varied significantly between the two biometers. According to ICCs, correlation between measurements made with both devices was excellent except for WTW and PD. Using the SRK/T formula, IOL power prediction based on the data from the two devices were statistically different, but differences were not clinically significant. Conclusions No clinically relevant differences were detected between the biometers in terms of their measurements and IOL power predictions. Using the IOLMaster 700, it was easier to obtain biometric measurements in eyes with less transparent ocular media or longer AL.

Reliability study. A total of 377 eyes of 210 patients were scanned with the 3 biometers in a random order. For each biometer, the number of unobtainable axial length measurements was recorded and grouped as per the type and severity of cataract based on the Lens Opacities Classification System III by the same experienced ophthalmologist. The Bland-Altman limits-of-agreement (LoA) method was used to assess the agreement in axial length measurements between the 3 biometers. The failure rate was 0 eyes (0%) with the OA-2000, 136 eyes (36.07%) with the IOLMaster, and 51 eyes (13.53%) with the Aladdin. Ï 2 analyses indicated a significant difference in failure rate between all 3 devices (P < .001). Logistic regression analysis highlighted a statistically significant trend of higher failure rates with increasing severity of nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular cataracts. Bland-Altman statistics indicated small mean differences and narrow LoA (OA-2000 vs IOLMasterÂ -0.09 to 0.08Â mm; OA-2000 vs AladdinÂ -0.10 to 0.07Â mm; IOLMaster vs AladdinÂ -0.05 to 0.04Â mm). The OA-2000, a new SSOCT-based biometer, outperformed both the IOLMaster and Aladdin biometers in very advanced cataracts of various morphologies. The use of SSOCT technology may be the reason for the improved performance of the OA-2000 and may lead to this technology becoming the gold standard for the measurement of axial length.

In this paper, we introduce a compact, clinically user-friendly instrument based on swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). A key feature of the system is the realization of two different operation modes. The first operation mode is similar to conventional OCT imaging and provides large field of view (FoV) images (up to 45Â° Ã 30Â°) of the human retina and choroid with standard resolution. The second operation mode enables it to optically zoom into regions of interest with high transverse resolution using adaptive optics (AO). The FoV of this second operation mode (AO-OCT mode) is 3.0Â° Ã 2.8Â° and enables the visualization of individual retinal cells such as cone photoreceptors or choriocapillaris. The OCT engine is based on an akinetic swept source at 1060 nm and provides an A-scan rate of 200 kHz. Structural as well as angiographic information can be retrieved from the retina and choroid in both operational modes. The capabilities of the prototype are demonstrated in healthy and diseased eyes.\n\nCompact akinetic swept source optical coherence tomography angiography at 1060 nm supporting a wide field of view and adaptive optics imaging modes of the posterior eye\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSalas, Matthias; Augustin, Marco; Felberer, Franz; Wartak, Andreas; Laslandes, Marie; Ginner, Laurin; Niederleithner, Michael; Ensher, Jason; Minneman, Michael P.; Leitgeb, Rainer A.; Drexler, Wolfgang; Levecq, Xav"
