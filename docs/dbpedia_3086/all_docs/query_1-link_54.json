        "text": "More Twenty One Pilots\n\nWeâre just a few days away from getting our hands on Twenty One Pilotsâ long-awaited seventh album, Clancy, and for those among us keen to score some extra TÃP merch, the band have just announced a run of Australian pop-up shops.\n\nCoinciding with the albumâs release this Friday (May 24), the first pop-up will be held in the Sydney (Eora) suburb of Pyrmont â on 60 Union Street, to be exact â from 12pm to 6pm. The second will be held in Melbourne (Naarm) the following day (May 25), running from 10pm to 5pm at the Oshi Gallery (386 Smith Street, Collingwood). And last but certainly not least, Brisbaneâs (Meanjin) pop-up will be held at the Fortitude Music Hall this Sunday (May 26), running from 10am to 2pm.\n\nEach pop-up is promised to feature new and exclusive merchandise, music and more â head here for more info on all three events.\n\nThe endeavour will follow a trio of listening parties for Clancy being held along the east coast this Thursday (May 23). Theyâll each take place simultaneously at Co-Co Bananas in Melbourne, Utopia Records in Sydney and Rocking Horse Records in Brisbane. All three sessions will begin at 5pm, and fans who arrive early will receive a limited edition Twenty One Pilots tote bag.\n\nFollowing the albumâs release, Twenty One Pilots will tour Australia throughout November. It marks their first trek Down Under since 2018, with three arena shows on the itinerary.\n\nTwenty One Pilots have thus far shared three singles from Clancy, starting with Overcompensate in February, then Next Semester in March and Backslide last month. The record itself will serve as the final chapter in a series of concept albums that began with 2015âs Blurryface and continued with 2018âs Trench (where the titular character was introduced) and 2021âs Scaled And Icy."
