        "text": "Demi Moore's new film \"The Substance,\" by French director Coralie Fargeat recently premiered at the 77th Festival De Cannes to a standing ovation with applause that was anywhere between a nine and 13-minutes, according to various media outlets including Variety and Deadline.\n\nMoore, 61, during a press conference Monday, talked about playing an aging actress in the film and filming nude scenes.\n\n\"Going into it, it was really spelled out — the level of vulnerability and rawness that was really required to tell the story,\" Moore said, according to Variety and CNN. “And it was a very vulnerable experience and just required a lot of sensitivity and a lot of conversation about what we were trying to accomplish.\"\n\n'The Apprentice': Trump campaign threatens to sue over 'garbage' biopic, director responds\n\nWhat is 'The Substance' about?\n\nFargeat's film with Moore in the lead follows movie star turned TV fitness instructor Elisabeth Sparkle, who finds out that her show's producers are replacing her with a younger and newer model, as per Vanity Fair. In an act of desperation, she takes a \"black market,\" \"cell-replicating substance\" to become a \"younger, better version of herself,\" played by Margaret Qualley, according to IMDb.\n\n\"Have you ever dreamt of a better version of yourself? You. Only better in every way,\" reads the official synopsis of the film on the Cannes website. \"You’ve got to try this new product. It’s called The Substance.\"\n\nThe only catch is that Sparkle will have to share time with the new and younger version of herself, who she names Sue, or else things will go awry.\n\n\"One week for you. One week for the new you,\" the film's synopsis says. \"Seven days each. A perfect balance.\"\n\nHowever, it's never as easy as it looks.\n\n'The Substance' cast\n\nThe main cast of the film, according to Cannes, includes:\n\nDemi Moore as Elisabeth Sparkle\n\nMargaret Qualle as Sue\n\nDennis Quaid as Harvey\n\nOther cast members, as per IMDb, include:\n\nHugo Diego Garcia as Diego\n\nJoseph Balderrama as Craig Silver\n\nOscar Lesage as Troy\n\nGore Abrams as Oliver\n\nMatthew Géczy as Bob Haswell\n\nPhilip Schurer as Mr. Scream\n\nWhere to watch 'The Substance'?\n\nIt might be a while until you get the chance to see \"The Substance\" because movies screened at film festivals are shown with the expectation of selling the movie to a studio or distributor to distribute it.\n\n\"The Substance\" makers have not yet revealed if they are in talks with any distributors regarding the film's future.\n\nContributing: Taijuan Moorman, USA TODAY\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.
