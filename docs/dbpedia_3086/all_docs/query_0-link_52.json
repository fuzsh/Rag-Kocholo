        "text": "As I readied for the last couple of weeks of 2012 I intended to revisit and re-share a tribute to Paramount Pictures that I’d previously posted. The great studio celebrated its centennial this year and its legacy deserves attention from movie fans as so much of what they gave us is awesome. There was one minor problem, however, with my sharing that previous tribute – it didn’t exist, except in my mind. Although I did post an entry to a blogathon in the studio’s honor, Sunset Blvd…It IS Big, it wasn’t an all-out tribute just an entry dedicated to one of the greatest films ever made, a Paramount Picture. So I scrambled a bit and here it is a tribute to Paramount…in earnest and in a fashion I use fairly often as I love those posters!\n\nFollowing is a theatrical poster gallery (for the most part) – a rather random array representing the wonderful films Paramount gave us to enjoy through the years, from the Silent era through the 1950s. I hope you enjoy these as much as I do – they are art. Mostly of the gorgeous variety.\n\n1912\n\nFrom July 12, Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth (The Loves of Queen Elizabeth) – Paramount’s first film.\n\n1914\n\n1916\n\n1919\n\n1920\n\n1921\n\n1922\n\n1923\n\n1924\n\nParamount’s first all-Technicolor feature…\n\n1925\n\n1927\n\nWinner of the first “Best Picture” Academy Award…\n\n1928\n\n1929\n\nParamounts last silent film…\n\n1930\n\nParamount’s first all-Technicolor talkie…\n\n1931\n\n1932\n\n1933\n\n1934\n\n1935\n\n1937\n\n1938\n\n1939\n\nThe Fleischer brothers’ first animated feature film…\n\n1940\n\nFirst of the Road pictures…\n\n1941\n\nThe Fleischer’s final animated feature film…\n\n1942\n\n1943\n\n1944\n\n1945\n\n1946\n\n1948\n\n1949\n\n1950\n\n1951\n\n1952\n\n1953\n\n1954\n\nParamount’s first film released in “VistaVision,” the studio’s wide-screen film format…\n\n1955\n\n1956\n\n1958\n\nThere you have it – an outstanding collection and an extraordinary legacy for which I am thankful to Paramount Pictures – the laughter, the awe, the stars and the stories. The studio started 2012 as the top-ranked U.S. studio 100 years after Adolph Zukor founded Paramount Pictures as Famous Players Film Company in 1912, testament to its continued commitment to excellence in entertainment and to its audience. Congratulations on 100 of quality. We wouldn’t be the same without you."
