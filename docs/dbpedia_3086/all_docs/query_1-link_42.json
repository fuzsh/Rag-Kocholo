The band have also just announced the ‘Clancy World Tour’ and you can get all the details and dates on that right here.\n\nTwenty One Pilots’ Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun are the latest winners of our Rock Sound 25 Icon Award, returning to the cover of the magazine as we continue to celebrate our 25th anniversary."
