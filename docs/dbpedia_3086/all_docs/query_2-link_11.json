        "text": "Now that Shawn Levy has conquered the world with his “Deadpool & Wolverine,” it appears the filmmaker is ready to start really looking at his “Star Wars” film.\n\nREAD MORE: Shawn Levy’s ‘Star Wars’ Film Finally Has A Writer Attached\n\nIn a recent interview on the Happy. Sad. Confused. podcast, Shawn Levy talked about his upcoming “Star Wars” film that is currently in development. The film is currently being written, and while Levy doesn’t want to give anything away, it does sound as if he is going into uncharted territory with his story.\n\n“There’s only so many times that ‘Star Wars’ movies can revisit the same section of the timeline,” said Levy. “I don’t want to do a ‘Star Wars’ film that is redundant to others. Nor am I interested in doing one that has to serve another movie.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’: Shawn Levy Wanted Jordan Peele For The Villain Role In The Film\n\nWe already know that Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy is directing a film that serves as a sequel to “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” We also know that James Mangold is working on a film that takes place in the very early days of the Force. So, it would appear that Levy’s script, however it turns out, is going to tackle perhaps a time period we don’t know too much about.\n\nThat can certainly be an exciting prospect. You could argue that so much of what has been done recently in the ‘Star Wars’ universe has been fan service-y and safe. Lots of appearances from well-known characters, or bringing back characters from other shows. Hell, even “The Acolyte” ended its first season with a beloved character making an appearance. All that to say, “Star Wars” could really use something fresh and new, and perhaps Levy is going to bring that.\n\nObviously, it’s far too early to know when we might see Shawn Levy’s ‘Star Wars’ film. Hell, it could eventually not get made. We’ll just have to wait and see."
