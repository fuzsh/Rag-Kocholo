        "text": "Hollywood isn’t just an incubator of celebrity culture. It’s also home to some of the most durable brand logos in American capitalism. The celluloid trade calls them title screens, and odds are that most every adult consumer can name them by sight: Warner Brothers’ “WB” shield, Cinderella’s Castle of Disney Pictures fame and, of course, MGM’s lion.\n\nThis coterie of famous frames also includes the one with more mystique than the others—Paramount Pictures. That star-encircled, snow-capped mountain peak has marked the opening of movies well before movies even had sound.\n\nAnd while the mountain in question has been modified and stylized to suit the era, it’s remained remarkably constant for the last 105 years—and as well it should, in the view of Paramount archivist Andrea Kalas."
