        "text": "Twenty One Pilots have just released their new album ‘Clancy’ and to celebrate, Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have dropped a set of new music videos to go alongside the record.\n\nThe band premiered the clips in the early hours of this morning (May 24) during a special livestream where they were joined by their longtime collaborator and video director Mark Eshleman. They have now released a music video for 12 of the album’s 13 songs, with a placeholder visual used for the record-closer ‘Paladin Strait’. A full music video for that song will follow in early June.\n\nHave a watch of the brand new ‘Clancy’ music videos below:\n\n‘Midwest Indigo’\n\n‘Routines In The Night’\n\n‘Vignette’\n\n‘The Craving (Jenna’s Version)’\n\n‘Lavish’\n\n‘Navigating’\n\n‘Snap Back’\n\n‘Oldies Station’\n\n‘At The Risk Of Feeling Dumb’\n\n‘Paladin Strait’ (Official Placeholder)\n\nWe recently teamed up with Tyler and Josh to bring you ‘Twenty One Pilots: The Return To London’, a 36-page souvenir photo magazine documenting the band’s super-intimate show at London’s Electric Ballroom.\n\nPlus, in this bundle, you get a digital download of ‘Clancy’ sent right to your phone by tapping the sticker on the cover."
