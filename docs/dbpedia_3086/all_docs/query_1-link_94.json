        "text": "Pazqal Eriq\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n8 min read\n\n·\n\nJun 6, 2024\n\n--\n\nAyra Starr has had the internet in constant conversation about her sophomore album since its release on Friday. From the sampling to interpolations, lyricism and all that is this album, here are my random notes & thoughts on my first week’s listen of The Year I Turned 21. I am eager to say sabianalysis but will let you decide that. Enjoy:\n\nBirds Sing Money:\n\nIt’s such a fitting opening to such a beautiful album. I think it was a way to push that this is an emotional, self definitive and commercial album. From the title, the commercial part came first because “money must be made,” and you will be entertained while feeling things. Over here we call that ‘An Experience’ and this album served that.\n\nAyra is cussing with a tone demanding your ears and if I were you, I would listen. Also, take me seriously when I say this song gives the same vibe as SZA’s ‘SOS’. Sis came out bitch-talking and ready to tell it as it is.\n\nStarting with a Yoruba song sample is perfect because she is about to tell you who she is now, first, she begins with where she is from. Hello??? Storyteller?? Ok, Miss Mamas! I mean, we can’t be too shocked considering the PR strategy for this album has been going down a storytelling path, which, by the way, I have to mention they were in their marketing bag. As Ulomx said, “Ayra this album rollout is mad.”\n\nGoodbye ft Asake:\n\nThis song is partly called ‘Warm up’ because trust and believe it sits nicely in your Afrobeats workout playlist If you don’t have one (side eye).\n\nA female feature would have eaten better on this track, or if it must have been a male feature, then I nominate Oxlade.\n\nAs a sophomore album marketed globally, I like how you can tell that as a brand, this album is a group effort of all the hands responsible for its existence while also embodying everything that is Ayra Starr as the growing pop star we are getting to know and love.\n\nSide-thought but I can’t help but feel like the Asake feature was simply for commercial purposes, which, I believe, is why there seems not to be a lot of attention paid to the coherency of his verse with the rest of the song. I need everyone trying to push the narrative that he ate her up on her song to be Supercalifragilisticexpialidociously fucking for real. Seeing the conversation online would lead us all to agree that even on a commercial basis, the feature worked as it has us all talking about it, right?\n\nCommas:\n\nWhen this album dropped, I tweeted about how we have to analyse why singles sound better on the albums.\n\nI got a few replies with interesting theories but I would love to know what you think.\n\nCommas wasn’t and still isn’t one of my favourite Ayra songs, however, I admire the marketing idea behind it being the lead single because at a time when manifestation and self-love content is at its peak, ‘Commas’ is most definitely the right manifestation song to drop as this, in my opinion, led to the success that it is now.\n\nLowkey, I’m waiting for our Christian mothers to Christianize this song because we know they will. I’m surprised that they haven’t done it even. They need to get on their Zoom and fast too!\n\nWoman Commando:\n\nAs per my previous album reviews, I’m a sucker for a good sample and that is why this song is part of my top ten but not number one.\n\nThrough this song, I realised Ayra wasn’t playing with anyone featured on her album. I can’t say anyone bested anyone on this song, however, a shared opinion with a friend is we would advise taking a different creative approach towards the verse arrangements. Ayra’s second verse should have come last and Coco’s verse, third with that beautiful bridge-like flow I can’t get enough of.\n\nI have a different suggestion but I’m afraid someone will stone me slippers so, I’ll shut up. LMAO\n\nControl:\n\nWhen I first heard this song, my thoughts were “Awwn! The Shakira interpolation is so cute and well done. Gasp! What if Shakira listens to it”. Now? I’m wondering what it would take for a remix with Shakira and not a lazy remix of just adding a verse to the song, it will ruin it. If it must be, then a whole new song must be written on the same beat, with an added extra duet verse. A boy can dream, Can’t he?\n\nThe hypeman’s voice drop was pleasant to hear and many of you are down bad, that is all I’m going to say.\n\nLagos Love Story:\n\nCurrently my favourite song on the album for obvious reasons, and though that could change, it surprises me that it is my favourite because I’m such a sucker for vocals and, in my opinion, this song doesn’t have the best vocal performance of the album. However, I know why I like it and It’s how she pronounces “this wan” in “Shey na this wan una dey enjoy”. Something about the way the entire song is sung makes me feel like the creative process behind it was an enjoyable one.\n\nOne of the most commercially potent songs on the album ’cause think of the number of weddings and engagement parties that will have this song playing on repeat. Ayra gurl, I hope your throat is ready for all the singing cause if I have to find a partner and organise a wedding just to see you sing this live, I will. Trust.\n\nRhythm & Blues:\n\nAccording to a few tweets I saw, this song is seen as a cute addition to the album even though it doesn’t sound like it was made for this particular album but, I beg to differ. This is one of those defending her cause everyone is hounding her moments, however, Rhythm and Blues is a cute song and drags the spot for who has the better rhythm with Commas.\n\nI admit it does sound like a filler song but I like to see it as a commercial break before the second part of such an emotionally well-written album.\n\n21:\n\nThis song is packed with such raw emotions and, I believe, is partly a reply to the scrutiny she has endured being in the public eye from such a young age both as a brand and as an individual.\n\nI want to say this song has the best vocal performance of the album but I don’t agree that there is a best vocal performance because the ‘vibe’ throughout the album is that of comfort in execution, even at certain “High” notes, which I think aids the storytelling of the album.\n\nLHS feat. Giveon:\n\nLet me start by saying how perfect this feature is for this song. I’m unsure if this is a sad song because my waist is whining, should it be doing that?\n\nIt’s no surprise that both their voices synergize so perfectly because I think they have almost the same type of voice but just in masculine and feminine forms.\n\nA verse that tallies with the initial lyrics of the song and not singing off point like there was a collaboration properly done. *Adjusts wig* That being said, I want consecutive albums to showcase how involved she is when it comes to what other artists submit as verses.\n\nBad Vibes feat. Seyi Vibes:\n\nThis is my least favourite song on the album, even though I love how she sings “Hallelujah”. Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against it even though I feel like Bella Shurmurder would have been a more fitting feature vocally but, I see what they were doing with the “Vibes” word so, I’mma let them have it.\n\nUhm…That’s all for this song really, Maybe this should have been a single. What do you think?\n\nOrun:\n\nThe most feel-good song of the album. It’s the kind of track that goes perfectly with a long car drive.\n\nThe Fuji & Juju influences in this song are rich and will not be overlooked by the Owambe owners as they will be there like mad.\n\nOut of all the songs, this one deserves an official video and I have the perfect idea and will share it when the big bucks roll in. Someone tell Ayra to call me, hehe.\n\nJazzy’s Song:\n\nAyra is Don Jazzy’s baby girl because not only does she dedicate a song to him, but his song is also sampled. Correct me if I’m wrong, but has anyone from the Jazzy Music Factory sampled any of his old songs? This is such a beautiful teacher-student moment between them and I felt honored to have witnessed it.\n\nAside from Don Jazzy’s influences that linger here and there, She owned the track in her way, especially lyrically.\n\nThis song shows how much she has grown lyrically, especially when compared to the writing of her debut, ’19 & Dangerous.’\n\nI think what has us the most obsessed with this song is the nostalgia it evokes as you listen.\n\nI have to commend the sampling work again. I hope with my soul that this song never has a remix, It is perfect, let’s leave it that way.\n\n1942 feat. Miler:\n\nOn some, “Ayra starr na my sister and I no go get song for the album? Wetin go come do my steeze”.\n\nIt was a cute sibling feature and I look forward to more work from him because he rode that beat like it’s not his debut rodeo and I’m impressed.\n\nAyra is so real because I feel you, gurl “I don’t wanna lose” fr! While everyone was getting emotional to other songs, This one had me feeling seen and I needed to feel that, gurl.\n\nThe Kids Are Alright:\n\nSeeing as this is a tribute to her father, I have no thoughts or critique just love to give.\n\nSanta:\n\nNgl, I’m kinda confused cause I don’t know if this is on the album or has been a single for a while that was later on added on the album because tell me why it is not available on my Apple Music.\n\nAnyway, I listen to it separately for some reason, I always restart the album immediately when ‘The Kids are Alright’ comes on. I feel that track is the perfect end to the album.\n\nSanta will just have to remain single to me, and a fave single too Don't get it twisted, that is still my girl. When Ayra sings “You draw me like Ogbono,” I move!\n\nThat will be all for my first few thoughts on the album. Anything else I have to say will end up on my Twitter. Have you listened to TYIT21? What is your favourite track off the album and least favourite? I look forward to the beautiful opportunities that this album will bring about for Ayra.\n\nNote: I am a culture writer with similar articles on album reviews. Catch up here and here.
