        "text": "“Twenty Five, Twenty One” has released an elaborate video taking viewers on a tour of their set!\n\nSet in 1998, tvN’s “Twenty Five, Twenty One” tells the story of youth whose dreams were taken from them due to the IMF crisis. Kim Tae Ri stars as Na Hee Do, an aspiring fencer, and Nam Joo Hyuk stars as Baek Yi Jin, whose family was torn apart due to the financial crisis. The two characters first meet at 18 and 22 years old, and they fall in love years later at age 21 and 25.\n\nWJSN’s Bona plays national fencing athlete Go Yu Rim, who is Na Hee Do’s rival. Choi Hyun Wook plays fashion influencer Moon Ji Woong while Lee Joo Myung plays his childhood friend Ji Seung Wan, the class president with the highest grades in the school.\n\nAt the start of the video, Bona, Choi Hyun Wook, and Lee Joo Myung introduce themselves and their characters being entering the set of Ji Seung Wan’s home for the first time. They all immediately express amazement at how luxurious her home is, with Bona commenting, “It’s almost like you’re the president’s daughter.”\n\nBona adds, “Yu Rim’s house doesn’t even have rugs…but there are rugs here.” Choi Hyun Wook quickly chimes in, “Ji Woong doesn’t have a house at all [on set].” Next, they discover Ji Seung Wan’s room where they admire the prop details and show off her numerous certificates of academic achievement.\n\nAfter quickly exploring the kitchen, the trio head back to Ji Seung Wan’s room where Kim Tae Ri and Nam Joo Hyuk are waiting for them. They greet the camera and Kim Tae Ri comments, “I feel extremely flustered to suddenly greet you in someone else’s home.”\n\nThe actors continue playing around with the props in Ji Seung Wan’s room and Bona explains that she also had a “fat computer” when she was younger. Choi Hyun Wook, who was born in 2002 and is the youngest of the bunch, throws everyone off as he comments, “Don’t they not have calculators these days?” The other actors insist that they do and Kim Tae Ri adds, “He’s really a part of the new generation.”\n\nLater, the five actors sit down to answer questions about their personal school experiences. When asked what they did in their leisure time after school, Kim Tae Ri shares, “I went to make hamburgers. I worked part-time.” Nam Joo Hyuk answers, “I went to evening self-study sessions.” When no one believes him, he explains, “I played sports up until middle school and was a regular high school student who did evening self-study sessions.” Bona, who was an idol trainee while in school, adds, “I went to the practice room.” Choi Hyun Wook shares, “I played baseball.”\n\nRegarding the clubs they joined in school, Kim Tae Ri reveals, “When I was in middle school, I was in the cross-stitching club.” Choi Hyun Wook shares, “I was in the movie-watching club.” When Lee Joo Myung shares that her school didn’t have clubs, Nam Joo Hyuk jokes, “Sorry, but what kind of school did you go to?”\n\nThe next question is whether they paid attention to Cyworld Today, a social media platform that was especially popular in Korea in the early 2000s. As a 2002 baby, Choi Hyun Wook claims that he cannot answer the question, and Nam Joo Hyuk, Kim Tae Ri, and Bona all share that they didn’t pay attention. However, Lee Joo Myung steps in to comment, “Anyone who says they didn’t pay attention [to Cyworld] is honestly lying. You don’t want to use it but [you pay attention to] stuff like, ‘How many [people visited] today?'”\n\nAt the end, the actors are given retro games to choose from and they settle on gonggi, a Korean children’s game that is played with small pebbles. After a quick practice round and a heated competition, Lee Joo Myung takes first place and wins a box of old-school Korean snacks.\n\n“Twenty Five, Twenty One” airs every Saturday and Sunday at 9:10 p.m. KST. Although Kim Tae Ri recently tested positive for COVID-19, tvN announced that there would no changes to the broadcast schedule.\n\nCheck out the full video below!\n\nCheck out Lee Joo Myung in “Kairos” here!"
