        "text": "COLUMBUS, OHIO — The word “unlikely” pops up so often when discussing the duo Twenty One Pilots, it should come as no surprise that the band’s early strategy for building itself into a local touring machine was not inviting fans to 99 percent of its shows.\n\nThe thinking, the group’s 29-year-old singer and songwriter Tyler Joseph said, was that other groups were practically begging: “It was just a bombardment of ‘come see us play.’” So Joseph and the drummer Josh Dun played tiny, unpromoted gigs on any nearby bill they could join, leaving strong impressions with their theatrical antics and genre-agnostic songs. Eventually, they’d announce a big hometown show, go all-out — lights, grander stunts, fresh set lists — and tell everyone to be there .\n\nThey did this for two years. Then they played a concert in 2011 where 1,700 fans showed up. So did representatives from 12 record labels.\n\n“In Columbus they were the Beatles,” said Pete Ganbarg, the president of A&R for Atlantic Records. (The band signed to Fueled by Ramen, the then-Atlantic Records Group label known for releasing emo and pop-punk bands like Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco.) “But you go over city limits, and nobody knew who they were.”\n\n[Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.]\n\nJoseph said the duo wasn’t dreaming big then. “We were trying to raise up out of the local scene,” he said. “Then it started to translate regionally. And then I don’t remember anything.”\n\nThe thing about rock bands in 2018 is they don’t do well commercially. Twenty One Pilots are unconventional — their songs stretch into rap, reggae, prog, electro-pop and screamo, often in the same track. Nobody plays guitar. And they do very well.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
