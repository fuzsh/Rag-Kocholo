        "text": "There's a shorter version in the streaming platforms, you might want to check out that one.\n\nOh that cool. Like once it picks up at around the 1 minute mark my head started bopping to it ha. thanks for the heads up\n\nLiking this single A LOT.\n\nSeen these guys a four times live. Two festivals, a stadium show, and once in a TINY ass club. They bring the same energy no matter the venue. They are a WILD live act. Check them out if you havent.\n\nWould love to, especially if this new song is any indication of new material. I'm not the biggest fan of a lot of their older stuff, but this song is rad.\n\nI found their last album to be their worst work yet and all around it just wasn't what I wanted, I did like this song though! I'll give the new album a whirl when it hits\n\nI liked the last album a decent bit, and I really liked the song they dropped during the lockdown, Level of Concern, it was one of my favorites.\n\nThis sounds pretty good, and my kid's gonna be excited to hear it, they're his favorite band ever.\n\nGreat track, but it's like three songs in one. It starts just like that new MCR track with the ramp up, then turns into a classic Trench type TOPs song, until settling into a Scaled and Icy pop style.\n\nIt'll be interesting to hear the rest of the album.\n\nExcited for the new album! Having Paul Meany from Mutemath working on these has really been a huge boon for them.\n\nLate quote and all, but I feel like you can hear Paul's influence all over Overcompensate.\n\n\"Overcompensate\" has been on constant repeat since it dropped and \"Next Semester\" is already joining it.\n\nTyler's vocals feel like a throwback to Vessel. Haven't heard him like that in a long time.\n\nI'm out until the full album now though.\n\nI was gonna go to a listening party, but the one by me said they weren't doing RSVPs, then 3 days before said \"oh uh we ARE doing RSVPs and we're all full!\" Since I pre-ordered the vinyl and my wife and I have tickets to the show we decided to listen, and all I'll say is I'm incredibly happy with it. I don't know if it tops Vessel or Trench for me yet.\n\nThis is very good.\n\nIt already feels like there's a lot to take in upon multiple listens in a way that Scaled and Icy didn't. \"Vignette,\" \"Lavish\" and \"Navigating\" are the first immediate standouts.\n\nThey released music videos for every song on the album too. Gonna make that my second full listen of it.\n\nI got to say, the new album is fantastic. Can't say that I hate SAI, but it took a little longer to digest, the new album though, I love every bit of it. Got tickets for their new tour concerts in Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo next year, can't wait!\n\nI can't stop listening to this, singing it, enjoying it.\n\nEven my wife got so interested in them again she started listening too after I've showed her new music vids and explained a little of the Dema and Trench lore I know.\n\nShit is absolutely fitting in my life now too. Amazing album, 11/10, will play again right now.\n\nWeird how this got bumped. I have been without a phone for a couple days, and turned on the radio this morning. A song came on and it instantly stuck out to me. Because I didn't have my phone, I had to remember the words. All I could really remember is the guy was saying \"Overcompensate\", so I came and googled \"recent song Overcompensate\". And I found this tune by Twenty One Pilots.\n\nI had only ever heard their big early hits and thought they were decent, but I have been listening to their newest album this morning and kinda floored by how good it is. Just a small story about discovering music in a fun way. Love the album and I will be diving deeper into their discography."
