        "text": "The era-ending Twenty One Pilots album Clancy is dragging out its grand finale just a little bit longer, but lead singer Tyler Joseph promises it’s for a good reason. The album, a conclusion to the duo’s multi-album arc that started with Blurryface in 2015, was originally schedule to arrive on May 17. It has now been delayed for one week while he completes music videos for each song with drummer Josh Dun and videographer Mark Eshleman.\n\n“When I first told Josh and Mark and everyone on our team that I wanted to do a music video for every song on the album, Clancy, that’s coming up, I told him it’s because I love the songs and I believe in them enough to pretend to sing in front of a camera to each one,” Joseph shared in a video message. “And that’s what we’re going to do because that’s how I want to present this album.”\n\nHe added: “But because of that, in order to accomplish that, we need a little bit more time. That’s why I’m making this video. We’re going to push the album back by one week to May 24. Isn’t that exciting? A little more time.”\n\nTrending\n\nTwenty One Pilots announced Clancy in February, launching straight into the new era with its lead single and opening track “Overcompensating.” The song arrived with a music video directed by Eshleman, which he co-directed with Joseph. Following the track list in chronological order, the duo released “Next Semester” as the second single. Joseph and Eshleman edited the accompanying Andrew Donoho-directed music video.\n\nLater this week, Twenty One Pilots will reveal the third song on the album, “Backslide,” with a music video directed by Dun."
