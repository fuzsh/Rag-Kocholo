        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, MN (March 27, 2024) – GRAMMY® Award winning duo Twenty One Pilots have announced details of their massive global headline The Clancy World Tour and shared “Next Semester,” a new song from their highly anticipated forthcoming album, Clancy, which will be released May 17th via Fueled By Ramen [album artwork / tracklist below]. Watch the Reel Bear Media directed music video for “Next Semester” HERE.\n\nTwenty One Pilots will celebrate the release of Clancy with The Clancy World Tour, their biggest headline tour ever set to get underway August 15th at Denver, CO’s Ball Arena. Produced by Live Nation, the tour will traverse North America through the fall followed by dates in New Zealand, Australia, Europe and the United Kingdom [see tour itinerary below]. Fans can participate in an official artist presale for tickets beginning April 2nd (US/CA) and April 3rd (UK/EU/AU/NZ) with all remaining tickets available during the\n\ngeneral on sale at 10:00 AM local time on Friday, April 5th. For tickets and complete details for Twenty One Pilots’ The Clancy World Tour visit www.twentyonepilots.com/tour.\n\nLast month, Twenty One Pilots returned with news of Clancy and released the album’s lead single “Overcompensate” alongside an accompanying official music video directed by Reel Bear Media. The track, which has rocketed up the Alternative Radio chart currently sitting Top 5, made a massive impact upon launch as it welcomed listeners back to the band’s immersive world of ‘Trench.’\n\nClancy is currently available for pre-order in a variety of physical formats including: two limited-edition deluxe box sets, four vinyl variants with additional retailer exclusives, an exclusive CD + Journal Book and a Cassette + Photocard Wallet, and much more. For the full suite of Clancy pre-order offerings, visit Twenty One Pilots’ official store.\n\nHaving amassed over 33 billion streams worldwide and over 3 million tickets sold across global headline tours, the Columbus, OH based duo of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have established themselves as one of the most successful bands of the 21st century and redefined the sound of a generation. Co-produced by Joseph and Paul Meany, Clancy marks the final chapter in an ambitious multi-album narrative first introduced in the band's 2015 multi-Platinum breakthrough, Blurryface. Furthermore, Clancy’s forthcoming release on May 17th coincides with the 9th anniversary of Blurryface, which was released exactly nine years prior to the day.\n\nTwenty One Pilots extended the ambitious concept laid out in Blurryface with their 2018 Platinum- certified album TRENCH. Featuring the multi-Platinum and Platinum singles “Chlorine,” “My Blood” and the GRAMMY® Award-nominated “Jumpsuit,” the album graced spots on “Best of” year-end lists by Billboard, KERRANG!, Alternative Press, and Rock Sound—who placed it at #1.\n\nThe duo’s 2021 RIAA Gold certified epic Scaled And Icy debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Top “Rock Albums” and “Alternative Albums” charts while landing at No. 3 on the “Billboard 200,” marking the biggest opening week for a rock album in 2021. The record is highlighted by the #1 Alternative Radio hits “The Outside,” “Saturday,” and “Shy Away,” the latter of which ascended to #1 at the format in just three weeks, placing the duo in an elite group of acts with multiple songs to rise to #1 at the format in three weeks or less including: U2, R.E.M., The Cure, Linkin Park, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Foo Fighters.\n\nSHOW DETAILS\n\nDate: October 12, 2024\n\nVenue: Target Center, 600 N 1st Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55403"
