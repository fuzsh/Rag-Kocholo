        "text": "TICKETS\n\nHow do I purchase tickets for an event?\n\nIf an event is at The Paramount, Neptune or Moore Theatre, advance tickets can be purchased in person at The Paramount Box Office (located at 9th Avenue and Pine Street in downtown Seattle), Monday-Friday from 10 am to 6 pm. Box offices at all 3 venues open 90 minutes prior to show time.\n\nYou can check ticket prices, availability, and purchase tickets by selecting the Get Tickets buttons throughout our website.\n\nPlease note that additional fees apply to online purchases through our official ticketing partner, Ticketmaster, and are not charged when you visit us in person. Our box offices are a walkup service only and do not sell tickets by phone or have access to information on ticket availability by phone.\n\nHow much are tickets and what seats are available?\n\nYou can find ticket prices and seat availability through selecting the Get Tickets buttons on our website or by visiting the box office in person.\n\nOnline, you can check prices and availability by selecting the Get Tickets button for the event in which you are interested in on our various show pages. You can check seat availability by selecting the price and section in which you are interested. You then have the option of canceling or proceeding with the order, once specific seat locations are quoted.\n\nCan you explain online ticket fees?\n\nSTG ticketing fees are comparable to most venues of the same size and complexity. We know that fees often feel exorbitant, however, we are consistently working with our ticketing partner to assure that our fee structure is fair.\n\nSTG online and phone ticketing fees consist of the following:\n\n*$0 fee for mobile delivery\n\n*Per ticket service charge – a portion supports STG's mission to create enriching experiences in the arts, engage diverse communities, and steward historic theatres. A portion of the fee is retained by Ticketmaster for their services.\n\n*Per Order Fee – this covers direct costs of fulfillment (order verification/customer service support)\n\n*Facility Fee – this theatre maintenance fee fully supports the portion of our mission that addresses the health of our three historic theatres. This fee is charged when purchasing in person, by phone, or online.\n\nSTG box office fees:\n\nThe online ticketing fees do not apply to tickets purchased in person at our box offices. The Facility Fee is the only fee charged at the box office. The Paramount Box Office is open Monday-Friday 10 am - 6 pm and 90 minutes prior to every show. The Moore and Neptune Box Offices open 90 minutes prior to every show.\n\nIs there a ticket limit?\n\nFor most events we enforce an 8 ticket limit on full price tickets. Many events have a group discount; learn more on our Group Tickets page. If ticket limits are not adhered to, STG has the right to cancel your entire ticket order and may restrict ticket purchases in the future.\n\nMy order timed out! How can I speed up the online order process?\n\nTicketmaster can register your contact and billing information in advance to streamline the sales process. We recommend that you do this since many high-demand events sell out in minutes.\n\nI chose Mobile Delivery during my Ticketmaster purchase process. What do I do now?\n\nMobile tickets can be scanned right off of your smartphone on the night of the event and do not need to be printed. It is likely that you will need to adjust your screen brightness in order for our ticket scanners to be able to read the barcode on your mobile ticket. As a security measure, barcodes do not populate onto mobile tickets until 72 hours before the performance.\n\nWhat if I lose my tickets?\n\nPlease email or call us with as much notice as possible for us to troubleshoot the issue with your tickets if you bought directly through our walkup box office at the Paramount. If you purchased your tickets through Ticketmaster, you can contact their customer service via your online order under 'fan support'. If it is the day of the show or over a weekend and you are not able to have the issue resolved in advance, please arrive in person 90 minutes before showtime when the box office opens to receive assistance.\n\nTickets for the show I want to see JUST went on sale and there are no tickets available via STGpresents.org. How can that be?\n\nThis could happen for a variety of reasons. The show may be a subscription performance with early sales and/or legitimately be sold out due to high popularity and thus high volume of patron transactions. In other cases, third party ticket sellers may be monopolizing ticket inventory. STG works with Ticketmaster, our official ticket partner, to combat this activity to the best of our ability.\n\nI bought a ticket off a website I thought was yours. How can I tell if the ticket is valid?\n\n.There is no guarantee that a ticket is valid when you purchase it from a third-party website whether that is an individual person reselling their ticket or a ticket broker company. STG only guarantees tickets purchased from our website that links directly to Ticketmaster’s website for the purchase path (listed on the show pages of our website) or at our venue box offices.\n\nWhy shouldn't I buy tickets from brokers or ticket scalpers?\n\nOfficial sources for tickets to events at The Paramount, Moore and Neptune Theatres include our ticketing partner, Ticketmaster (in which our website links to their website for online sales) and the box offices located at the Paramount, Moore and Neptune Theatres. Tickets purchased from sources other than these could be fraudulent, counterfeit, or otherwise unusable for admittance. Tickets may not be resold on the premises, including the exterior area around either theatre.\n\nCan I buy tickets to other venues’ shows at The Paramount Theatre box office?\n\nMoore and Neptune tickets are available for advance purchase at the Paramount during daytime hours (Monday-Friday 10 am to 6 pm). However, tickets to events outside of our three core venues are generally not available for purchase at our box offices. For tickets to other venues, please visit the show page on our website or visit the website of the venue you are interested in.\n\nCan I buy tickets at the door on the day of the event?\n\nYes. If there are still tickets available to purchase on the day of the event at the Paramount, Moore or Neptune Theatres, you may purchase them in person at the box office. Some shows sell very quickly and do not always have tickets available on the day of the show, so we suggest you check availability online prior to making the trip.\n\nThe Paramount, Moore, and Neptune box offices all open 90 minutes prior to every performance.\n\nPlease visit the websites of other venues for their policies on purchasing tickets at the door on the day of the event.\n\nThe show is GA (general admission), but I have a seat / section number on my ticket. What does that mean?\n\nAny seat or section number on your ticket to a general admission event is more for internal tracking purposes and is not related to an actual seat.\n\nCan I upgrade to Club seating?\n\nParamount Club tickets are only available via membership packages. More information here. For active members, all tickets changes must be made during standard business hours as Club staff are not in the office on the weekends.\n\nMoore & Neptune Club tickets are only available via membership packages. More information here.\n\nWhy do some events have the first 10 or 20 rows held for Will Call pick up?\n\nAt the artist's request, the first 10-20 rows of the main floor may be restricted to night-of-show Box Office Will Call pickup only. This is to help prevent reselling and ensure that ticket buyers can access these seats directly from the venue at the original price offered. Restrictions include:\n\n1. The original purchaser must claim the tickets in person on the night of show, starting 90 minutes prior to show time. Please bring your confirmation number, a photo I.D., and the credit card used for purchase.\n\n2. No advance pick up.\n\n3. No name changes.\n\n4. No third parties may pick up the tickets on your behalf (sorry, this includes friends and relatives).\n\nThese restrictions are necessary to ensure that true fans have access to these seats at the original price offered.\n\nCan I get a refund or exchange my tickets?\n\n.Only qualifying series subscription tickets can be exchanged; for STG Performing Arts Series season tickets please contact This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. . For Broadway at The Paramount series tickets please contact Broadway Across America at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. .\n\nAll other tickets are purchased on a no refunds, exchanges, or cancellations basis and are only usable for the day, date and time selected at the time of purchase.\n\nDoes my child need a ticket?\n\n.Unless otherwise noted, everyone requires a ticket regardless of age. This applies to the majority of shows geared toward children and all ages community shows. You are welcome to hold your baby/toddler on your lap, but they still need a purchased ticket to enter. In general, for children under four years of age it can be challenging to remain quiet and seated for the duration of a performance; however, we leave that decision to the parents' discretion for shows that permit all ages. Some of these policies may differ for events that are specifically geared toward children. Ask a ticket agent or check the show page for that event. Some events offer discounts for children, so if you order, be sure to ask. For events geared toward children at The Paramount Theatre, booster seats are available on a first-come, first-served basis. There is not a dedicated crying room at our venues, but you are welcome to take your child out of the theatre into the lobby; return seating is at the ushers' discretion.\n\nWhat is a presale? How do I participate or get a promo code / password?\n\nPresales and promo codes / passwords are distributed by invitation only via the Internet. STG distributes presale information when applicable in our weekly eNews to opt-in subscribers - information below. Other presales are created through other organizations; i.e. fan clubs, radio stations, producers or promoters of a particular show or production, etc. Emails are sent to those meant to participate, providing a password or promotional code to be entered when purchasing tickets, prior to the public on sale date. The theatre does not have access to these passwords distributed by other organizations for their internet presales.\n\nOur weekly STG eNews frequently lists presales for select shows, but we do not have any information beforehand if that will be the case. Join and automatically receive the most recent edition of eNews!\n\nAre there discounts to any shows?\n\nThe availability of discounts is determined by the individual producers and presenters. Discounts, if offered, are not applicable or retroactive to previously sold tickets.\n\nHow do I subscribe or find out more about your current season offerings?\n\nInformation on all shows and subscription options offered in our current season can be found here.\n\nDo you have ‘rush’ tickets for Broadway shows?\n\nEach production that comes to our theatres is unique and offers different prices and discounts, if there are any even available. Generally, the only ‘rush’ tickets offered are for students with valid student ID and are only offered for Broadway events. Typically, it is not determined if a student rush discount is available until shortly before the first performance. Please feel free to email our box office at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. to see if rush tickets are being offered for the current Broadway production.\n\nWhen can I pick up my Will Call tickets?\n\nThe Will Call window opens 90 minutes prior to each show at the Paramount, Moore and Neptune. Be sure to bring photo ID, the credit card that was used to purchase the tickets, and your Ticketmaster order number, as any or all of these may be required for ticket pick up.\n\nCan I leave tickets at Will Call for a friend to pick up?\n\nSorry, for liability reasons we are no longer able to accept third party will call drop offs at the box office window. If you need to change the name on your order, please contact your point of purchase to make arrangements in advance.\n\nIf you are a STG Performing Arts subscriber, you can change the will call name by contacting the subscriptions department at 206.812.1114 or This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. . Changes must be made during the business week within at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled performance.\n\nTHEATRES\n\nWhere can I drop off a patron who may not be able to walk long distances from parking to the venue?\n\nAll theatres have a patron loading and unloading zone in front of the venue.\n\nAre there accessible ADA restrooms located in the theatres?\n\nAll theatres have an ADA-accessible restroom. The ADA-accessible restrooms are located on the main floor of the Paramount and Neptune, and up the ramp from the main lobby at the Moore. If you need assistance in locating the restroom, an usher will be glad to guide you to the nearest facility.\n\nIs there a coat check at The Paramount, Neptune or Moore Theatre?\n\nThere is a coat check available at The Paramount Theatre for Broadway performances only. The coat check at The Paramount is located on the second floor of the theatre. Neither The Moore nor The Neptune has a coat check.\n\nDo you have a bag policy at The Paramount, Moore and Neptune Theatres?\n\nWe ask that you not bring large bags with you, however they will be allowed into the theatre only after a full bag search. Bag searches take more time and will slow ingress into the theatre, so if you do need to bring a large bag with you, please arrive as early as possible to avoid missing any of the show!\n\nAre certain items prohibited inside The Paramount, Moore and Neptune Theatres?\n\nYes. Please visit our Safety & Security page to learn more.\n\nWhat should I wear?\n\nGoing to a show can be a special occasion. For some that may mean a suit/sport jacket or nice dress, and for others it may mean a clean pair of jeans and a polo shirt. This is Seattle, and our audiences tend to be less formal than might be expected in other cities. We would suggest dressing as if you were going out to a nice dinner.\n\nPlease note: shirts, shoes, and pants / shorts / skirts / dresses are required for all genders at all times. No exposed underwear or bikini tops / bottoms allowed.\n\nHow early can I line up?\n\nFor events at The Paramount Theatre, patrons are welcome to start lining up on Pine Street, going east towards Boren, on the theatre's side of the street. For events at The Moore Theatre, the line starts at the front door and goes northwest on 2nd Avenue, around the corner heading northeast on Virginia. Patrons may line up after 6:00 am on the day of the show, if they wish to do so. Please be aware that there will be no staff or security outside the theatres before the show.\n\nWhat if I arrive late?\n\nLate seating policy varies by show. Typically, Broadway events have a door hold and will seat latecomers at appropriate intervals such as applause breaks. For many concerts and casual events, patrons may come and go freely. Some dance and fine arts performances have a strict no-late-seating policy; in those cases, you can expect a notice of the policy on our website show page and in your reminder email.\n\nIs there bar service at The Paramount, Neptune or Moore Theatre? Are the bars always open before a show? For how long?\n\nBars in The Paramount and Moore Theatres are open for most performances one hour prior to the show and close at the start of the performance. They are open during intermissions. The bar at The Neptune Theatre remains open throughout the duration of the performance.\n\nCan you bring bottled water into the buildings? Can you take food or drinks from the bar into the theatre(s)? What food is available for purchase?\n\nNo outside food or drink are allowed at The Paramount, Neptune or Moore Theatres*. Food is available for purchase on a show by show basis – please see our Concessions page for more details. Full service bars are open for most performances.

Please be sure to have ID ready when you approach the bar for purchase.\n\n*Outside food and drink can be brought into the theatre if required due to a disability, medical requirements and/or special needs. Guests with specific/special dietary needs due to disabilities, medical conditions and/or special needs should contact us by emailing This email address is being protected from spambots.

Our ushers would be happy to direct you to The Friends of The Paramount booth in the lobby for more information or rental.\n\nHow can our babysitter reach us?\n\nThere is no paging system at The Paramount, Neptune or Moore Theatres. While cellular phones must be silenced during performances, they are the best way for you to be contacted directly, so please feel free to bring them and to check your messages during a break or intermission.\n\nAn artist’s website says they are playing at your theatre, but you don’t have them on the calendar. Why?\n\nOften, artists release their tour schedules before the booking process has been completed with the venues. The best way to receive advance notice of on sale dates is to join our weekly eNews list. You will get information about upcoming events and more. Subscribe here. Please note, although every effort is made to notify our email subscribers of upcoming on sales, we are not always given enough notice with which to do this, so you may not receive notification in advance of every on sale.\n\nMy band would be a great opener – how can I open for a show at The Paramount, Moore or Neptune?\n\nMost bands tour with their own openers, and we at STG typically have no control over the openers that come through our venues.\n\nDoes STG rent its venues to candidates running for or in elected office?\n\nSeattle Theatre Group® does rent its venues to candidates running for or in public office for campaign events and beyond. As a matter of policy, Seattle Theatre Group® does not endorse candidates and the rental use of our facilities is not an act of endorsement.\n\nCan I purchase an ad in your program(s)?\n\nYes. Advertising in our programs is managed by Encore Media."
