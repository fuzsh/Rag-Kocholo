        "text": "What Is the Empirical Rule?\n\nThe empirical rule, also sometimes called the three-sigma or 68-95-99.7 rule, is a statistical rule which states that in a normal distribution, almost all observed data will fall within three standard deviations (denoted by the Greek letter sigma, or σ) of the mean or average (represented by the Greek letter mu, or µ) of the data.\n\nIn particular, the empirical rule predicts that in normal distributions, 68% of observations will fall within the first standard deviation (µ ± σ), 95% within the first two standard deviations (µ ± 2σ), and 99.7% within the first three standard deviations (µ ± 3σ) of the mean.\n\nUnderstanding the Empirical Rule\n\nThe empirical rule is often used in statistics for forecasting final outcomes. After calculating the standard deviation and before collecting complete data, this rule can be used as a rough estimate of the outcome of the impending data to be collected and analyzed.\n\nThis probability distribution can be used as an evaluation technique since gathering the appropriate data may be time-consuming or even impossible in some cases. Such considerations come into play when a company reviews its quality control measures or evaluates its risk exposure. For instance, the frequently used risk tool value-at-risk (VaR) assumes that the probability of risk events follows a normal distribution.\n\nThe empirical rule is also used as a rough way to test a distribution's \"normality.\" If too many data points fall outside the three standard deviation boundaries, this suggests that the distribution is not normal and may be skewed or follow some other distribution.\n\nThe empirical rule is also known as the three-sigma rule, as \"three-sigma\" refers to a statistical distribution of data within three standard deviations from the mean on a normal distribution (bell curve), as indicated by the figure below.\n\nExample of the Empirical Rule\n\nLet's assume a population of animals in a zoo is known to be normally distributed. Each animal lives to be 13.1 years old on average (mean), and the standard deviation of the lifespan is 1.5 years. If someone wants to know the probability that an animal will live longer than 14.6 years, they could use the empirical rule. Knowing the distribution's mean is 13.1 years old, the following age ranges occur for each standard deviation:\n\nOne standard deviation (µ ± σ): (13.1 - 1.5) to (13.1 + 1.5), or 11.6 to 14.6\n\nTwo standard deviations (µ ± 2σ): 13.1 - (2 x 1.5) to 13.1 + (2 x 1.5), or 10.1 to 16.1\n\nThree standard deviations (µ ± 3σ): 13.1 - (3 x 1.5) to 13.1 + (3 x 1.5), or, 8.6 to 17.6\n\nThe person solving this problem needs to calculate the total probability of the animal living 14.6 years or longer. The empirical rule shows that 68% of the distribution lies within one standard deviation, in this case, from 11.6 to 14.6 years. Thus, the remaining 32% of the distribution lies outside this range. One half lies above 14.6 and the other below 11.6. So, the probability of the animal living for more than 14.6 is 16% (calculated as 32% divided by two).\n\nThe Empirical Rule in Investing\n\nMost market data isn't normally distributed, so the 68-95-99.7 rule doesn't generally apply to investments. However, many analysts use aspects of it—such as standard deviation—to estimate volatility.\n\nYou can calculate the standard deviation of your portfolio, an index, or other investments and use it to assess volatility. Calculating a particular investment's standard deviation is straightforward if you have access to a spreadsheet and your chosen investment's prices or returns.\n\nMarket analysts express standard deviation in percentage form. For example, the daily standard deviation (annualized) for the S&P 500 index (using daily closing prices) from May 2, 2023, to June 2, 2023, is 13.29%.\n\nUsing the spreadsheet, you can paste the returns, prices, or values into it, find the percent change from the previous session, and use the standard deviation function:\n\n= STDEV ( 1, 2, 3, 4, ...) or = STDEV ( A1 : A200 )\n\nTo annualize the standard deviation, multiply it by the square root of the number of trading days in one year—there are usually 252."
