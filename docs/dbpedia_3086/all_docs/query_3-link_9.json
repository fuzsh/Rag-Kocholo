        "text": "1970\n\nFamily Dollar went public in 1970, offering common stock at $14.50 a share. A year later, we opened our 100th store. Within three years, our expansion skyrocketed and we opened our 200th store and our first distribution center in Matthews, N.C.. By the end of 1979, we were trading on the New York Stock Exchange and saw annual sales of over $100 million.\n\n1990s\n\nEarly in the 1990s, K&K Toys was sold to KB Toys, a Melville Corp., and all assets were used to expand dollar stores. We underwent a name change to Dollar Tree Stores in 1994. Then in 1995, we went public on the NASDAQ exchange at $15 a share. The market cap was calculated at $225 million. Between 1996 and 1997, we acquired Dollar Bill$, Inc., a Chicago-based chain of 136 stores, and broke ground on our first Distribution Center and new Store Support Center in Chesapeake, Virginia. At the tail end of the 1990s, we acquired the 98-Cent Clearance Centers in California and the Only $One Stores in New York. In 1999, we opened a second distribution center in Olive Branch, Mississippi.\n\n2000s\n\nIn the 2000s, Dollar Tree made several acquisitions that would prove to be excellent decisions later on. In 2000, we acquired Dollar Express, a Philadelphia-based company, in 2003, we acquired Greenbacks, Inc., a Salt Lake City company, and then in 2006, we acquired 138 Deal$ stores from SUPERVALU INC.\n\nWe opened our first North Dakota store in 2004, putting us in all 48 contiguous states. In 2006, we celebrated our 20th year of retailing at a $1.00 price point and opened our 3,000th store. In 2007, we reached a market cap of $3.29 billion in sales. Finally, in 2008, our organization earned a place on the Fortune 500 list and had the number-one performing stock that year. By the end of the 2000s, Dollar Tree had moved 100 spots on the Fortune 500 list and opened/purchased seven Distribution Centers in California, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Illinois, and Washington.\n\n2022\n\nNow, in 2022, we have completed the rollout of our $1.25 price-point initiative to all Dollar Tree stores chainwide in the U.S. This is Dollar Tree's first price change in over 36 years, allowing us to continue offering all the items our customers know and love, plus hundreds of new items, all at an incredible value."
