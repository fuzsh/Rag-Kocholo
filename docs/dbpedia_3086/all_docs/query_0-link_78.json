        "text": "Paramount Pictures has released a new behind-the-scenes big game tease for John Krasinski's new film, IF. It will be released on May 17th.\n\nThe Super Bowl might be known for football on some level, but for anyone who writes in entertainment news, it means movie trailers and remaining woefully sober for the night. However, even though the new looks for many films won't be out until this weekend, we are starting to get some hints about what could be on the horizon. Paramount Pictures has a new movie from John Krasinski called IF, which has been getting little teases for a while now. While we didn't get the new big game spot released today, we did get a new behind-the-scenes spot that features star Ryan Reynolds potentially getting low-key gaslit by Randall Park. The voice cast is really where this movie shines, but May has a lot of competition against franchise films with familiar IPs. It will be harder for something like IF to find a place at the box office, and we could be heading into another summer where being mediocre will kneecap a production with the best intentions. We'll be getting a new look at IF during the game this weekend.\n\nIf: Summary, Cast List, Release Date\n\nFrom writer and director John Krasinski, IF is about a girl who discovers that she can see everyone's imaginary friends — and what she does with that superpower — as she embarks on a magical adventure to reconnect forgotten IFs with their kids. IF stars Ryan Reynolds, John Krasinski, Cailey Fleming, Fiona Shaw, and the voices of Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Louis Gossett Jr., and Steve Carell alongside many more as the wonderfully unique characters that reflect the incredible power of a child's imagination.\n\nIf, directed and written by John Krasinski, stars Ryan Reynolds, John Krasinski, Cailey Fleming, Fiona Shaw, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Louis Gossett Jr., Alan Kim, Liza Colón-Zayas and Steve Carell. It is executive produced by John J. Kelly and George Dewey and produced by Allyson Seeger, Andrew Form, Reynolds, and Krasinski. It will be released on May 17, 2024."
