        "text": "This upcoming weekend, the 2023 When We Were Young Festival will take place at the Las Vegas Fairgrounds for two sold-out days on Oct. 21 and 22.\n\nFeaturing a lineup of heavy hitters from the Warped Tour era, including headliners Green Day and Blink-182 alongside the Offspring, Sum 41, Good Charlotte and many more, the second iteration of the mega-fest following a fantastic, if weather-disrupting inaugural edition in October 2022 looks to be another nostalgia blast for attendees.\n\nHere’s a trailer for the fest, shared on Monday and set to a snippet of a new Blink-182 song titled, appropriately, “When We Were Young.” The song is included in Blink’s new album, One More Time, which will be released on Friday, Oct. 20 as the first from the band with guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge since 2011:\n\nSet times for the festival were also unveiled on Monday. As expected, it’s goin to be a busy weekend for everybody in attendance, and — just as was the case at very single Warped Tour back in the early 2000s — tough decisions will have to be made to combat schedule overlaps and conflicts.\n\nAmong the noteworthy on-site events at the festival is a collaboration between three of the biggest bands on the bill – The Offspring, Sum 41 and Pierce the Veil — and Broken Promises, which teamed with the bands for special clothing items, as well as a big Broken Promises activation on the festival grounds that will offer on-site tattoos and more.\n\nFans can count on finding exclusive Broken Promises merchandise available only at When We Were Young Festival. Their on site activation will also include a specially curated flash sheet of tattoos and piercings by veteran – owned tattoo collective, Body Art Express. The professional mobile tattoo studio is powered by BodyArtBus, the original and first ever fully licensed mobile tattoo/piercing studio in SoCal. Last year, Broken Promises’ on-site activation for the inaugural year of When We Were Young had the largest activation on site, which included a mini skate ramp.\n\nVisit Broken Promises’ website for more details.\n\nSee also:\n\nWhen We Were Young Festival 2023: Green Day, Blink-182, The Offspring, Good Charlotte, Sum 41, More\n\nSomething Corporate: Watch First Headlining Gig in 20 Years at 10/20 When We Were Young Sideshow via Veeps.com\n\nSum 41 Throws It Back with New Single “Landmines”; Playing When We Were Young in Las Vegas 10/21-22"
