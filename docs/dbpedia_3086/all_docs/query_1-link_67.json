        "text": "DUBAI — December 2, 2023 — Today, a group of eleven leading philanthropic funders signed a call to action that commits to accelerated progress and action on climate adaptation and resilience, seeking to bolster government and private sector action at and after COP28.\n\nCurrent signatories include the African Climate Foundation, Aga Khan Foundation, Arab Foundations Forum, Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, Climate Emergency Collaboration Group, ClimateWorks Foundation, European Climate Foundation, Fundación Avina, Humanity United, the Institute for Climate and Society, Laudes Foundation, Munich Re Foundation, Open Society Foundations, Philanthropy Asia Alliance, Quadrature Climate Foundation, the Robert Bosch Stiftung, Rumah Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation, Shockwave Foundation, and Trafigura Foundation.\n\nIn addition to scaling up climate mitigation, philanthropy must also accelerate work to help countries and communities adapt to the impacts of climate change from unprecedented weather patterns and global warming above 1.5º C that threatens the survival of communities around the world. With 3.6 billion people in developing countries already highly vulnerable to climate change’s worst effects, and climate-related risks continuing to grow, philanthropy needs a step change to increase adaptation and resilience.\n\nThe adaptation finance gap is significant, with low-income countries requiring at least US$215 billion per year this decade while current international public finance flows cover only 10% of these adaptation costs. Philanthropy can act as a critical catalyst to help unlock greater public and private sector funding and investment, champion climate innovation at local and government levels, and drive systems change at the scale needed to support a climate-resilient world.\n\nThe diverse group of philanthropic organizations commits to increasing shared learning and developing coordinated strategies to reduce climate vulnerability. They will:\n\nWork together to increase learning, coordination, investment, and overall impact to advance climate change adaptation and build climate resilience.\n\nDevelop coordinated strategies to scale and improve philanthropic action, guided by the priorities of those most impacted and other relevant interest groups.\n\nChallenge current support delivery norms and assumptions by engaging in new approaches to achieve transformational change that address underlying vulnerabilities.\n\nEngage closely with others outside of philanthropy, including governments, civil society, financial and international institutions, and corporations to create effective alliances that catalyze scalable impact.\n\nTransparently and regularly share progress.\n\nThe coalition plans to measure and track our investments over time, including reporting on collective progress by COP30.\n\n“The African Climate Foundation believes that climate resilience paves the way for economic resilience. Adopting a transformative approach to climate adaptation, the ACF focuses not only on avoiding loss but also on unlocking economic and developmental potential through enhanced climate resilience. Effective structuring of philanthropic funds, private investments, grants and concessional loans is essential to support this climate-economic resilience nexus,” said Saliem Fakir, Executive Director at the African Climate Foundation.\n\n“For over five decades, the Aga Khan Foundation has worked with communities in Asia and Africa to improve their quality of life, promote pluralism, and enhance self-reliance. The people we serve now find themselves among the first and worst affected. AKF has already helped millions adapt their lives and livelihoods to the effects they already feel from global warming; we will continue to stand with them as the climate crisis intensifies in the decades to come. Our commitment to them is steadfast,” said Dr. Matt Reed, CEO of the Aga Khan Foundation (UK) and AKF’s Global Director of Institutional Partnerships.\n\n“The MENA region is warming nearly twice as fast as the rest of the world, and our communities are already suffering through some of the worst impacts of climate change. The climate crisis affects everything from health to education, economic development to social justice, and we can no longer ignore the urgent need for unified climate action. At the Arab Foundations Forum, we are committed to helping our member organizations and wider network find solutions through collaboration, education, and advocacy. We believe the philanthropy sector has a crucial role to play in mitigating the climate challenges we face today and in supporting communities as they adapt to rising temperatures. And the time to act is now,” said Naila Farouky, CEO of the Arab Foundations Forum.\n\n“The realities of the earth’s changing climate demand more from all sectors of society, including philanthropy. Ambitious climate action requires a holistic approach, one that not only stops emissions to limit future warming but also builds resilience and reduces the impacts already faced by those at the frontlines of the climate crisis today. ClimateWorks Foundation is committed to advancing people-centered solutions and supporting philanthropies in their collaborative efforts to deliver better outcomes for people, climate and nature around the world,” said Helen Mountford, CEO and President of ClimateWorks Foundation.\n\n“Climate justice demands not only that we redouble our efforts to cut emissions, but also that we urgently step up funding to help shield those most vulnerable to climate change’s already devastating effects. Adaptation finance is crucial to a fair transition. With its broad membership and high ambition, this coalition can make a real difference,” said Prof Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation.\n\n“For Fundación Avina, a foundation rooted in the global South and dedicated to climate action and systemic transformations, addressing the adaptation agenda is imperative. This focus allows us to proactively respond to the devastating impacts of the climate crisis, particularly on the most vulnerable groups. We are eager to contribute our extensive experience in fostering collective actions at both local and global levels within the climate adaptation arena. Our goal is to ensure that climate finance serves the broader objective of climate justice. Together, we can pave the way for a sustainable and thriving future for all, underpinned by the principles of equity and justice,” said Gabriel Baracatt, CEO of Fundación Avina.\n\n“The climate crisis is not a standalone problem. All of us in the field of philanthropy and human rights must consider how we account for it in our work, since it affects all aspects of society. And those least responsible for the crisis — such as our partners in the Global South — are often the ones to suffer the most,” said Srik Gopal, Managing Partner at Humanity United.\n\n“The frequency and intensity of extreme events underscore the urgency of climate financing on the adaptation agenda. The Institute for Climate and Society and its partners work in a network, in an integrated and tireless manner, with a focus on the real implementation of solutions that strengthen the resilience of populations most vulnerable to climate change, mostly those who have contributed the least to this situation. Advancing adaptation solutions is both crucial and urgent,” said Maria Netto, Executive Director of the Institute for Climate and Society.\n\n“As we embark on the journey of climate adaptation and resilience, Laudes Foundation stands firm in our dedication to advancing just transitions within our focal industries. In the face of the climate crisis, adaptation funding becomes a lifeline, preserving the dignity and well-being of those most deeply impacted. Upholding social equity is our responsibility on this path, as climate action without inclusivity is incomplete. Together, we can pave the way towards a greener, fairer, and more inclusive future for all,” said Leslie Johnston, CEO of Laudes Foundation.\n\n“Climate change is one of the most serious risks the world has to contend with. We have it in our hands to build resilience and support adaptation efforts of affected communities. We need to prepare – and understanding and managing risks is a crucial basis for adaptation. The Munich Re Foundation supports innovative approaches to risk prevention and aims to strengthen the adaptive capabilities of the most vulnerable people to the effects of climate change,” said Renate Bleich, Chair of The Munich Re Foundation.\n\n“Over the past two years, the Open Society Foundations has invested in a range of initiatives and innovative tools to mobilise finance to build resilience for disproportionately impacted climate-vulnerable countries and communities. Supporting such critical efforts — a priority for the most vulnerable — is a matter of social and economic justice. We are glad to be joined in this endeavor by many other philanthropic organizations to scale and speed up efforts. We are confident that this will trigger further investment from donor countries and the private sector,” said Yamide Dagnet, Director for Climate Justice at Open Society Foundations.\n\n“We must work collectively and decisively to accelerate climate action. Since the launch of the Philanthropy Asia Alliance last year, we have been focused on building capabilities to support philanthropic-private-public partnerships, and mobilising capital in impactful ways. We are grateful to be part of this coalition, collaborating with others who are equally committed to scaling up urgent solutions for a better world,” said Lim Seok Hui, CEO of Philanthropy Asia Alliance.\n\n“As climate impacts escalate, the poorest and most vulnerable countries and communities who are least responsible for the causes of climate change are suffering the most. Yet support for these communities to adapt to the impacts of climate change is too little, too late. Recognizing this, Quadrature Climate Foundation is glad to be partnering with others in our commitment to scale support for adaptation, focusing on getting that support to the most vulnerable groups in climate vulnerable regions,” said Jess Ayers, CEO of Quadrature Climate Foundation.\n\n“The Robert Bosch Stiftung is committed to addressing critical issues related to adaptation and resilience. We are dedicated to fostering a just transition and instigating a fundamental paradigm shift in land use practices. Our efforts concentrate on promoting regenerative practices in agriculture and forestry, fostering a climate-friendly food system, and advocating for sustainable policies and frameworks. Furthermore, we prioritize initiatives aimed at ensuring climate action is centered around those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This includes individuals who are compelled to migrate, those who seek to relocate, and those who strive to remain resilient in their current environments,” said Ottilie Bälz, Senior Vice President of Global Issues at the Robert Bosch Stiftung.\n\n“Climate change is already upon us. Regardless of whether we’re a global funder or small family foundation like us, it’s critical that philanthropies of all sizes join forces to accelerate our collective response. Being in Southeast Asia, we witness the urgent need for climate adaptation with hundreds of millions of lives at risk along our region’s coasts. It’s intimidating, but philanthropic capital has a meaningful role to play and this crisis calls for urgent, collaborative efforts to safeguard communities and our shared future,” said Kathlyn Tan, Director at Rumah Foundation.\n\n“The most vulnerable are already feeling the effects of a warming planet and are the least able to weather the resulting floods, fires, heat, and disease; committed to the wellbeing of humanity, our philanthropic dollars can hopefully spur others to act,” said Dr. Rajiv Shah, President of The Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n“Climate change is here and now. Empowering vulnerable communities to counter climate challenges is paramount for sustained socio-economic well-being. Shakti is committed to promoting people and planet-positive solutions that enhance adaptive capacities and fortify climate resilience,” said Vatsala Joseph, Interim CEO of Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation.\n\n“Science tells us that even with climate mitigation efforts, we will face ongoing climate impacts for decades or centuries. Rather than see these impacts only as a source of disruption and loss, we view this catastrophe as a clarion call to build better. At the Shockwave Foundation, we work with our partners to ensure that our future is not merely “less vulnerable” to climate impacts. We strengthen resilience by collaborating with other funders and supporting organizations with impactful, scalable solutions,” said Paul Traina, CEO of the Shockwave Foundation.\n\n“The Trafigura Foundation recently launched its new strategy focusing entirely on climate adaptation. Our mission is to invest in catalytic solutions for resilient communities and ecosystems. Our strategy puts collective action at the centre of all adaptation efforts. As a funder, we see the coalition as a premier platform to increase learning, coordinate approaches, and align with other philanthropies in closing the global adaptation financing gap,” said Dario Soto Abril, Executive Director of the Trafigura Foundation.\n\n# # #\n\nNote to the editor: After the call to action was launched on December 2 with eleven original signatories, ten additional foundations have also signed on.\n\nAbout the Organizations\n\nAbout the African Climate Foundation\n\nThe African Climate Foundation (ACF), established in 2020, is the first African-led strategic grant-maker working at the nexus of climate change and development.\n\nMedia contact: Kelly Easton, kelly@africanclimatefoundation.org\n\nAbout the Aga Khan Foundation\n\nTheAga Khan Foundation is a leading global development organisation working to tackle the root causes of poverty.
