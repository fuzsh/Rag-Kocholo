        "text": "Before there was widespread Internet, before YouTube or Pandora or BandSpace, rock bands existed, all across the country, in their own private Idahos. In the mid-eighties, college radio stations began to grow in influence, and gradually some of these bands found ways to get the sound of their music directly to potential fans. A few—R.E.M., the Replacements, Hüsker Dü—grew in prominence (slowly). Many others made decent music, got some attention, toured the country a few times with the help of a network of fans’ couches, and dropped back out of sight.\n\nThis is the story of one of those bands. They made not just decent music but at least one great album, which, as it happens, has just been re-released in a twenty-fifth-anniversary edition. Back in the late eighties, records came to critics and radio people on plain cassette tapes or vinyl LPs. Because none of the myriad avenues available today to spread word of good stuff were around, critics actually had to put the cassette in a player or throw the LP on a turntable and listen to what they sounded like. And because some of the bands made difficult music—imagine hearing Pavement for the first time, say, not to mention Hüsker Dü—you often had to listen, really listen, several times or more, to make sure there wasn’t something there you were missing. (It’s not a precise analogy, but note how today you have to watch three or four episodes of some of the more adventuresome TV shows before you get what their creators are up to.)\n\nThe record I’m talking about was called “You and Your Sister,” and the band was called the Vulgar Boatmen. The sound of the band was in a way vaguely folksy, in another way vaguely country, slightly tangential to the sound of what came to be called alt-country, or Americana. Its sensibility wasn’t quite rural, and it certainly wasn’t urban—though elements of soul and gospel flecked the record as well. The sound in general was what you’d call “organic”—you could basically hear the guitars being strummed, the drums occasionally snapped, the almost-resigned naturalness of the lead singer’s voice, the plaintiveness of the melodies. And yet there was something droney, almost hypnotic, about a few of the songs, both musically and lyrically, a touch reminiscent of the electronic “shoegazer” bands of the time.\n\nWords floated up from the lovely music. “It’s a business trip.” “Not a second to wait.” “You need a decision.” Themes welled up, too, surging through virtually every song. This or that family member. Women’s names, like Margaret and Mary Jane and Katie. Driving. (Lots of driving.) Radio. Love. Despite the abstractions in the lyrics, there were real people in the songs, living and breathing in a real and defined world. I want to say yearning, but that’s a word that is too often used to describe schlock, so I’ll say the sound and meaning of regret and loss instead.\n\nYou started to get taken by the sound, then the melodies, and then the import of those sentence fragments. It all seemed to be deliberate. It was one of those records where you notice something and think, “Well, if they knew what they were doing there, that would be interesting, because that was really good.”\n\nFor example, there’s the title song. It takes a while to unpack. It begins with a simple, slightly herky-jerky acoustic guitar line, delivered plainly, almost amateurishly. Then the song proper begins. The song never says precisely, but it seems to be about two women. You can’t tell if the singer’s in love with the “you” in the title or the sister. “She laughs / When something’s not funny / She really looks like your father.” There’s something lazily sensual about the song, but it’s really not sexual. I said “women” above, but the reference to the father seems to peg the song as one about kids of one sort or another, full of naïveté and wonder.\n\nThe line “She laughs” sits plain on a page, but as sung, it’s drawn out, two full measures, four beats to each word. It turns the act into a moment of bliss. The chorus goes, “You and your sister / Not a moment to wait.” And that guitar line keeps coming back. Where at first it is unaccompanied and dominant, in time, when the choruses roll around, it’s subordinated to other guitars. At the end of the song, it’s still going strong, but buried in the music. Its steady diminution seems deliberate, seems to suggest something—the course of life? A relationship?—though you really couldn’t say for certain what.\n\nThat’s what you hear the first time through. The next time through you get hung up on the words “You and your sister.” Back then, to a certain breed of obsessive fan, those words had some resonance. It’s the name of an exquisite, somewhat obscure track by a songwriter named Chris Bell. He and Alex Chilton were the creative forces behind Big Star, which recorded three albums in the early nineteen-seventies. Big Star trafficked in shuddering emotions and fragile, sweet melodies, without being too precious about it. It was one of those bands, like the Velvet Underground, that didn’t get much notice during their heyday, but that later generations of fans, and future rock stars, found moving, and unshakeable. “You and Your Sister” is from a Chris Bell solo album that wasn’t released until many years after his too-early death, in a car accident. Lines like “They say my love for you ain’t real” and “Your sister says that I’m no good” reverberate. As in the Boatmen’s “You and Your Sister,” there are intimations of a relationship, but also lots of obstacles, and in the end you’re not sure if the relationship exists anywhere but the mind of the singer, and you begin to think that that is what the song is actually about. Not love, per se, but the search for it.\n\nThat’s why, in the Boatmen song, the singer says, over and over again, “You and your sister / Not a second to wait.” It sounds urgent written out, but on the record it’s a bit fatalistic and ambivalent. You think about all that, and wonder what’s going on with the “you”—the woman, if it is a woman, or girl—and the sister, and then there’s an acoustic guitar break, and the diffident drumming is suddenly accompanied by handclaps—except it’s not handclaps plural, but a single set of hands clapping, not quite softly and not quite diffidently, but not all that forcefully either. They sound a bit forlorn, too. The solitary set of hands clapping sets off another synapse in your memory; after a while you find yourself thinking about Buddy Holly and soon after that you think of “Everyday,” because the single handclaps connect right back to that Holly song. The key line of “Everyday” is “Love like yours will surely come my way”—another intimation not of love but of unattained love.\n\nThe song ends with a minutes-long outro, where the singer moans, “You you you and your sister,” over and over again. It becomes almost an incantation. There’s no resolution.\n\nThen comes the song “Margaret Says.” This one starts out with another solo acoustic guitar line, but it’s much quieter, and halting. There’s another woman (or girl) here, somehow coquettish: “She whispers right in my ear / Something very contrite, something very sincere.” It sounds like they’re going to be getting married.\n\nI’m supposed to be thinking\n\nEverything’s all right\n\nI’m supposed to be thinking about the rest of my life\n\nAll these steps I’m taking\n\nPictures of my family\n\nThat’s what Margaret says\n\nWhen she talks to me\n\nWe have, again, musical diffidence, a certain fatalism in the singing, but it’s not born of arrogance, just naturalism. Again there’s something silky and loving in the sound of the voice. Again we have a woman or girl, mentions of family, gentle but not-quite-tied-together lyrics. The abstractions go on, until this:\n\nShe asks me a word\n\nI don’t know right away\n\nShe says it’s hard to pronounce, but easy to say.\n\nThat makes Margaret sound more like a girl, perhaps a daughter, than a lover. At the end of the song, there’s a musical coda, the opening guitar comes back, strong this time, and the setting changes:\n\nGet into my car\n\nTake the Germantown Road\n\nWDIA\n\nLove comes and goes\n\nAn intense rush of emotion accompanies those lines, but again you have to unpack some things. WDIA is a seminal blues station in Memphis. “Love Comes and Goes” (I had to look it up—back then it was harder) is a blues track recorded by Arthur Conley and apparently co-written by Otis Redding. “There ain’t no such thing as everlasting love,” the Conley song goes. Here again the overtones in the two songs are at subtle cross-purposes. Ray's singing about love, but he's also singing about other love songs that tell him love won't always be around. The surface emotions are intense and authentic, the subtext below ambivalent, uncertain.\n\nAbout half the songs on “You and Your Sister” are like that—indelible, lovely, emotionally fraught, delivered with a laconic naturalness but with intellectual landmines. In some folks’ hands, such references are sarcastic, hip, or droll. Here they bring you into the singer’s head. By rights, they should break the listener’s emotional connection to the song, but they bring you deeper into the meaning rather than disrupt it.\n\nThe Boatmen never went anywhere, for a number of reasons. It wasn’t a typical rock band. The name is a pun on a Russian folk tune about the “Volga Boatmen.” The band originated at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and one of the principals was Walter Salas-Humara, who left early on and went on to form another much-noticed, little-bought indie band of the period, the Silos. A professor, Robert Ray, took an interest in the band. “I never met anyone like him,” Salas-Humara recalls in “Drive Somewhere,” a low-budget documentary about the band. Ray, a professor of media studies, had grown up in Memphis, where, as a kid, he had seen Elvis Presley during the Sun era. He knew everything about movies and music and had an almost unbelievable academic background. (Educated at Princeton as an undergrad, he had a law degree from Virginia, an M.B.A. from Harvard, and a Ph.D. in comparative literature from Indiana. Besides all that, he looked like a third Everly brother.) He ultimately joined the band, bringing along songs that he had been working on long-distance with a fellow-student back in Indiana, Dale Lawrence. Ray had the band in Gainesville, but it didn’t tour; Lawrence reconstituted a Boatmen touring outfit out of his band Right to Left, in Indianapolis. To record, Lawrence traveled to Florida to work with Ray at his home studio.\n\n“You and Your Sister” got a few positive notices, and heavy radio airplay on Chicago’s WXRT, a not-insignificant deal at the time. The dichotomy of the two ensembles was a good hook, after a fashion, for articles on the band when the Indiana group toured. But there was a downside as well; in a way, fans who saw the band on tour weren't getting the real Boatmen, with Ray doing lead vocals. The industry didn’t help. In the years immediately after “You and Your Sister” was released, a lot went on in music; Nirvana happened, for one. The good news was that in the post-“Nevermind” era, radio’s ears were open to different sounds; the bad news was that, a few places like WXRT aside, it remained pretty deaf to anything related to country or rurality. The band’s critical corner was in the end limited, the alt-country thing never really went anywhere, and the Boatmen weren’t a part of that in any case. The band released two more albums and appeared on Jools Holland’s program, in the U.K., but never developed commercial momentum. A disastrous, almost Kafkaesque experience with a major label, well detailed in the “Drive Somewhere” documentary, did the band in.\n\nBut the music stayed with some. Comparisons ranged from Buddy Holly and Ricky Nelson to the Feelies. Once in a while people took to the Internet to say that “You and Your Sister,” or the band’s second release, “Please Panic,” was one of the best albums they’d ever heard. The writer Jonathan Lethem named his novel “You Don’t Love Me Yet” after a lilting number (sort of an inside-out version of “Needles and Pins”) from “Panic.” Ira Robbins, the editor of “The Trouser Press Record Guide,” raved about the band. Greil Marcus wrote liner notes for a compilation album, “Wide Awake.”"
