        "text": "Alpha Brands, a trailblazer in the cannabis industry, proudly announces the launch of Twenty One Cannabis, a dynamic new brand set to elevate the THCa experience. Scheduled for release on 4/20 (April 20, 2024), Twenty One Cannabis promises an expertly curated journey into the world of THCa with its unwavering commitment to quality.\n\n\"Launching Twenty One Cannabis marks a significant moment for us, as we introduce some of the highest quality THCa flower and oil available on the market,\" said Lindsey Goldstein, Chief Marketing Officer at Alpha Brands. \"Our commitment to excellence drives every step of our process, ensuring that our customers receive only the best, most refined products. We are thrilled to offer a dispensary-grade line that not only meets but exceeds expectations, setting a new standard in cannabis quality.\"\n\nInspired by the 21 carbons found in THCa, Twenty One Cannabis offers a fun and playful casino-themed branding, inviting consumers to roll the dice on their next adventure while guaranteeing that the quality of their THCa is a sure bet.\n\nAt the heart of Twenty One Cannabis lies a meticulous sourcing process, where THCa flower is carefully handpicked from premier cultivators across the United States. Hailing from the cannabis havens of Colorado, Arizona, California, and Oregon, each bud undergoes rigorous inspection to ensure only the finest flower makes it into Twenty One Cannabis products. The brand's oil is crafted by an expert pharmacist and PhD chemist with over 20 years of combined experience in the cannabis industry.\n\nTHCa is the raw form of THC, the psychoactive compound found in cannabis. While THCa exists naturally in the plant, it only becomes THC when heated. Essentially, THCa is the calm precursor waiting for activation, while THC is the compound responsible for the sought-after high we experience.\n\nWith a focus on both exotic and premium strains, Twenty One Cannabis curates products for high quality and potency, ensuring an unparalleled experience for consumers. From meticulously selected flower, to expertly crafted pre-rolls, icy cones, and disposables, each product is designed to deliver an exceptional THCa experience.\n\n\"Our mission at Twenty One Cannabis is simple: to provide consumers with the finest THCa products available,\" added Goldstein. \"From our exotic strains to our premium selections, we guarantee an experience that exceeds expectations and elevates the senses.\"\n\nFor media inquiries, please contact Annie Gallagher, Marketing Manager for Alpha Brands, at annie@arvidalabs.com.\n\nFor more information about Twenty One Cannabis and to stay updated on the latest news and promotions, visit www.twentyonecannabis.com.\n\nAbout Twenty One Cannabis:\n\nIntroduced by industry trailblazer Alpha Brands, Twenty One Cannabis offers high quality THCa products including exotic flower, liquid diamonds, and prerolls.
