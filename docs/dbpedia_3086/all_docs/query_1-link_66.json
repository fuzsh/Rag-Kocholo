        "text": "Have you ever encountered a tormenting farewell with someone whom you have never wished to get apart from? It’s painful because never has the parting crossed your mind at all; because this person is so dear that you want to keep him inside your pocket for a lifetime. It could have been forever, but, instead, it became another lesson. This drama is the kind of harrowing heartbreak that started off beautifully but then completely shattered your heart to pieces.\n\nIf I recall it correctly, the last time a drama was soo hyped on Reddit discussion threads was Hometown Cha Cha Cha (2021). The last episode’s thread has even reached 8k comments and more than 1k upvotes by now, signifying the hot buzzes resulted from a dumbfounding ending that could have been better for everyone. Nevertheless, Twenty Five Twenty One (2022) has been one of the strongest 2022 Kdramas so far that brings comfort and joy amidst difficult times. Just Like Hong Banjang’s character, Na Hee Do and Baek Yi Jin will remain iconic for how the characters make us feel. As walloping as the heartaches and controversies surrounding the drama were, all the lovely warmth of their love was just as grand to remember.\n\nTWENTY FIVE TWENTY ONE / 스물다섯 스물하나 (2022)\n\nSet in 1998, Na Hee Do (Kim Tae RI) was an aspiring fencing athlete who wanted to become a suitable rival of her role model, a fencing gold medalist Go Yu Rim (Bona). As an 18-year-old high schooler, Hee Do sparked so brightly with passionate spirit and did everything she could to hold onto her dreams. Baek Yi Jin (Nam Joo Hyuk) was only 22 when his family’s business declared bankruptcy and his dreams fell apart all at once. Amidst his exhausting misery, Hee Do’s existence breathed fresh air to Yi Jin’s miserable life and painted a smile on his somber face. In a time when dreams seemed too far away, the two worked extra miles and became each other’s support system to accomplish a dream and rebuild a better life. Four years later at the age of 25 and 21, Yi Jin and Hee Do experienced what a genuine love is all about.\n\nINITIAL IMPRESSION\n\nIt didn’t take long to enjoy the drama since all the characters manage to penetrate your mind right off the bat. They were all high school students with relatable traits that you might find around your school. It’s easy to root for the happiness of Hee Do and all other characters just like wishing the best for your long-time childhood friends.\n\nNa Hee Do (Kim Tae Ri) is passionate about fencing and wants to become the best in her league. Just like any other ambitious teenager her age, Hee Do believes in her dream and runs towards it at full speed. Her brazen determination, persevering idealism and sometimes brassy attitude are what compose her soulful character. Hee Do is far from a strategic thinker and not good at academics, but at that age, her soulful passion alone is already an enduring anchor to drive her actions.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that Kim Tae Ri is in her 30s when Na Hee Do’s subtle gestures scream a 15-year-old little girl. Somebody on Reddit even mentioned that Hee Do’s tomboyish walk resembles the average movements of young athletes. From comedic reliefs to emotional scenes, Kim Tae Ri nailed them all like an acting prodigy. Her adorable baby face is also a plus, y’all.\n\nBaek Yi Jin (Nam Joo Hyuk) used to be a rich, lively and charming young adult who had everything on the palm of his hands until IMF occurred and turned his life upside down. He had to give up on his dream, quit college and lived separately from his family. Yi Jin worked multiple part-time jobs and applied for full-time positions here and there. He tripped down several times but still managed to get back on his feet for the sake of his family. Financial difficulties crushed him so much that he had to mature faster than everyone his age, but Yi Jin gradually adapted himself to all circumstances given.\n\nThis drama is so far my most favorite Nam Joo Hyuk’s acting performance along with Start Up (2020) (albeit I despise Nam Do San’s character so much). Nam Joo Hyuk’s face is a work of art that looks finer as he ages. Baek Yi Jin’s character is so nuanced given all the hardships he had experienced, and Nam Joo Hyuk successfully depicted all of Yi Jin’s polished feelings and emotions. There is no reason not to love him as an actor, isn’t it?\n\nGo Yu Rim (Bona) carries so many burdens and ambitions on her fencing career mainly to ease the financial struggles of her family. Most of the times, she acts tough on purpose to hide her fragile heart like a little hedgehog. She put Hee Do off (and us as viewers, I guess) at first due to her own inferiority that constantly fed her fear, but once the tension dissolved, Yu Rim became one of the sweetest best friends you could ever have.\n\nI watched Bona’s acting for the first time when she played a main character in Girls’ Generation (2017). She was already a great actress there so it didn’t occur to me that Bona is originally an idol from WJSN. Here Go Yu Rim’s character was convincing enough for the viewers to have a love-hate relationship with her, and Bona is just a perfect fit as Yu Rim.\n\nMoon Ji Woong (Choi Hyun Wook) is number-two Yu Rim’s biggest fan after Hee Do. Despite his slightly narcissistic and free-spirited personality, Ji Woong is a good-natured kid and behaves well with other people. Not having good grades didn’t turn him into a delinquent. Instead, it made Ji Woong sharpen his determination and work towards his own goals unbothered.\n\nChoi Hyun Wook is a new face in Kdramaland, and I believe that he will hit big in the future as long as he has eyes on picking good projects. His acting performance was decent enough and it’s easy to get captivated by his good looks. Also the fact that Hyun Wook is a ’02 liner but got paired with co-stars born in the 90s in this drama, but still managed to look like they’re the same age is just too fascinating to realize.\n\nJi Seung Wan (Lee Joo Myoung) is without doubt a smart cookie at her school given her top grades and her being the class president. Her idealism and strong sense of justice clearly show when she witnesses injustice, even though it has nothing to do with her. Seung Wan has been friends with Ji Woong since they wore diapers, and I love their adorable bickering and dynamic relationship, and that the two stay purely friends without any ulterior motives.\n\nLee Joo Myoung has starred in several dramas before, but it’s only now that I got to discover her acting performance. She definitely brought Seung Wan’s bland savageness to life and put it in the spotlight.\n\nSTUFFS I LIKED\n\nBeautiful times, passionate youth (but also a devastating time for some)\n\n“People must be losing something, but it has nothing to with me; it’s adult stuff. I’m just 18, too young to lose anything. The stuff I have can’t be lost. For example, my dream and admiration.” Thanks to the drama, I managed to encounter another youth that will never come to me twice. There is so much joy and happiness in making the most of your youth, and the youthful atmosphere is a pill of endorphin for a content soul. “It’s time for some fun. Let’s waste out time and energy a little. After all, we have so much youth to spare.”\n\n[SPOILER ALERT] Yi Jin, who once enjoyed the luxury of his youth, was now down in the dumps after money problems bit his back. To people whom his father owed much debt to and who threw a frustrated tantrum at him, Yi Jin was trembling in fear as he stuttered to promise that he would never be happy again. It’s painful to see how children subconsciously bear the burdens of their parents on their shoulders, but a more painful sight to witness a dreadful suffocation as they are chained with their parents’ responsibilities. [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nAs time goes by, it’s evident that life often brings us to unexpected places, people and circumstances. Baek Yi Jin struggled hard at the intersection of his adulthood and ended up working a job he’d never dreamed of before. Once his youth reached a dead-end alley, he came into a realization that life is full of twists. “I don’t think not living your dream means you’ve failed at life. And I don’t think living your dream means you’ve succeeded either. I simply want to do well at my job right now.”\n\nNa Hee Do’s unbending determination\n\nWhile Na Hee Do’s character was portrayed as a childish teenager, Kim Tae Ri is also a naturally-great actress that brings the character to life. Beyond Hee Do’s comedic scenes, there were also her strongly-determined ambitions that drove her clumsy but steady steps.\n\nEP1. [SPOILER ALERT] When Hee Do insisted on enrolling to Tae Yang High School in order to continue fencing but her mom disapproved the idea, she began a bad strategy to have her forced transfer from her old school. From getting into a fight with schoolmates, attempting to join a gang fight to going to a night club to have her arrested by the cop, Hee Do went ahead fearlessly. Yi Jin caught her in the act and gave her a good scolding. Regardless, he gave her credit where it’s due. “About protecting your dream, despite the wrong plan, you had the right idea.” [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nEP3. Hee Do and her unstoppable efforts are what made her giant steps in the fencing career. [SPOILER ALERT] Since she wanted to be qualified for the national team, Hee Do came to Coach Yang Chan Mi (Kim Hye Eun) and asked for guidance in training. When Yu Rim asked Coach Yang whether she played favorites by seemingly giving one-on-one training to Hee Do only, Coach Yang said that a teacher will gladly teach a student who seeks further guidance, and nobody but Hee Do has ever come to her for it. Hee Do, on the other hand, did everything that was asked and tried her best without doubting her coach’s capability to sharpen her skills. [END OF SPOILERS] One shouldn’t care about pride whatsoever when it comes to pursuing personal goals and ambitions, for that’s what matters.\n\nEP7. Hee Do stood unbending even when people underestimated her. Despite the fact that her mom was against her fencing and the NTC (National training Center) coach favored Yu Rim more, Hee Do never broke down even once. Only she knows the weight of burdens she carries. Thus, Hee Do ultimately broke down in tears upon hearing words of affirmation from a kind grandpa in a restaurant, just when she needed it the most. “You must have been so hurt. Life throws you some nasty curveballs, doesn’t it? You have been through a lot. You were amazing during the match yesterday. Congratulations on winning the gold medal. It must have taken such hard work to make it there. You must have cried so much in secret and suffered so much pain.”\n\nHeroine Seung Wan\n\nJi Seung Wan is fierce and abrasive about her idea of justice and changing the world for better. As an unproblematic student who always gets the best grades, lives with a harmonious family and eats home-cooked meals everyday, life gets mundanely dull for her. She keeps looking for fun things to do, be it hobbies or troubles. [SPOILER ALERT] After witnessing a teacher’s repeated assaults towards his students, Seung Wan wanted to stand up for them and make a change. In the end, even the police didn’t do anything that Seung Wan ended up quitting school on her will because she couldn’t write a letter of apology and bow down to the teacher. Her mother was deprived that a precious year of her daughter’s hard work at school went to drain, but she chose to understand and gave Seung Wan a big hug. “You have to learn how to be flexible. You can’t live in this world if you only know how to break.” [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nGrowing up means seeing the greys in life and learning how to slightly abandon idealism in order to survive, even if it’s definitely wrong to your eyes. Not many people have the guts and perseverance like Park Sae Ro Yi in Itaewon Class (2020); flexibility is just a given in the social world. In the same way, it’s also okay to call it quits when things go beyond control. To give up is also a challenge; there is actual strength in quitting as well.\n\nUnending comedic reliefs\n\nI had a really really good laugh thanks to this drama. Be it Hee Do, Yi Jin or other characters, they all made a good synergy in exercising our stomach. [SPOILER ALERT] About Hee Do drawing a page of Full House comic book that her mom tore off but she misspelled a word; Yi Jin insisting on a three-legged race with Hee Do in the middle of the night because she broke a slipper instead of giving her a piggyback ride; Ji Woong’s purposely-narcissistic remarks that make other people laugh; to Seung Wan’s savageness towards Yi Jin as a new tenant before she realized that Yi Jin is her senior at the school’s broadcasting club. [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nAlso, don’t get me started on this meme-able sight of Yi Jin, Hee Do and her Cutie Pie Jung Ho Jin (Choi Tae Joon). [SPOILER ALERT] Reuniting after half a year, Hee Do introduced a boyfriend of 3 days to Yi Jin and forced him to hold his wild laughter in front of the their silly lovey-dovey acts. [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nSTUFFS THAT IRKED ME\n\nGo Yu Rim’s insecurities\n\nWhen a hedgehog is scared, it tends to hide its body in a prickly coat of erect spines and hurt anybody that comes closer. It sums up Yu Rim’s attitude towards Hee Do all along. [SPOILER ALERT] When they were small, little Hee Do won over little Yu Rim in a junior sport competition and it subconsciously grew Yu Rim’s fear. Years later at 18, they met again and Yu Rim instantly recognized Hee Do. Knowing Hee Do’s potential to become the top dog in the field, Yu Rim felt threatened by her sudden emerging improvements that she would rather loathe her than admit Hee Do’s improving skills. At some point, it’s infuriating enough to watch somebody who is unable to root for another person’s happiness out of petty jealousy.\n\nEP7. [MAJOR SPOILER ALERT] I boiled down with rage during the Asian Games competition when the referee finally announced Hee Do’s victory but Yu Rim appealed to the ref and cried in the podium, claiming it a bad call and that she should have won the gold medal. What Yu Rim did was turning Hee Do’s hard work into ashes and crashing the honor of the gold medal itself. Even if Yu Rim thought that way, it’s not right for her to treat Hee Do as a robber of the gold medal and victimize herself pitifully in front of the media. [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nSurely enough, Yu Rim’s character was just naturally redeemed as the story progressed. The conflict went beyond her inferiority complex, but it also touched upon money problems within Yu Rim’s family that triggered an evil domino effect. Regardless, I like that Yu Rim knew how to back down and apologize for her past wrongdoings. She made up with Hee Do in the end and crafted a splendid friendship with her afterwards. They ended up becoming a person who shares everything with for each other, including tears and burdens.\n\nI don’t think it’s considered grooming but it did feel a bit meh (the paragraphs below contain major spoilers, FYI)\n\nLet me give a word or two to address the grooming controversy surrounding the drama. Please also note that my opinion is entirely subjective and doesn’t hold any ground in determining what’s right or wrong. Some people called it grooming for the fact that Hee Do got together with Yi Jin before she turned legal, hence still considered a minor. It didn’t help that Yi Jin looked way more mature than his age and Hee Do still behaved like a junior high school student at that time. Also, the fact that Yi Jin as a grown-up still hung out with high school students alludes people to think of him as a freak that doesn’t have any friend his age.\n\nFrankly speaking, I take all the online comments with a grain of salt. It was a bit meh that Yi Jin, who once said that kids should date kids, and adults should date adults, went back on his words and confessed to Hee Do when she was still considered a minor. Not that 19 (Korean age) was a super young age, but Hee Do had always been on the childish side. It would have been better if the story took place a few years later when Hee Do already took off her school uniform and matured a bit. Regardless, I don’t think it should blow up out of proportion and stir so much controversy in the first place. Hadn’t Yi Jin’s family gone bankrupt, he would have still been in college. Four years isn’t a big age gap and Yi Jin was barely turning into an adult. But then, it may also romanticize grooming and trigger unhealthy relationships out there, so I understand the sentiment somehow. I was just kind of upset because such a great drama was basically tainted because of a controversy that could’ve been prevented beforehand. In my personal opinion, it’s not a big deal and Baek Yi Jin had never sexualized her in any way as an adult that could potentially lead to grooming.\n\nHee Do’s mom\n\nAfter Hee Do’s late father passed away because of his illness, Hee Do has always felt distant with her mother because of her indifferent way of loving her. Shin Jae Kyung (Seo Eun Kyung) is a news anchor at UBS broadcasting station. At the workplace, she is an excellent main anchor and a respectable senior in the industry. However, she has failed Hee Do’s trust several times and let her down. Jae Kyung always puts her work before anything else, including her own family. Behind her astounding professionalism, there are Hee Do’s heartaches. It was then revealed that Jae Kyung had to accelerate in her career in order to become a single breadwinner in the family, even if it cost her precious time with Hee Do. On the positive note, Hee Do managed to live in privilege and pursue a relatively expensive sport without an ounce of worries about money. [SPOILER ALERT] I think the writer might have warned us the viewers with foreshadowing Hee Do-Yi Jin’s relationship from Jae Kyung’s past working experience. Hee Do and her mom had always been entangled in a lonely connection that reeks waiting, apologies and disappointments. Knowing that Yi Jin threw himself to the same field of work, the repetition of such connections couldn’t be hindered at all. [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nWhy can’t a reporter and an athlete be together when Kdramaland has couples of North Korean-South Korean, human-goblin and human-gumiho (also lots of major spoilers too)\n\nI’m too devastated to argue about this heavy topic, but let me sum up some meaningful elements I read on Reddit. If we were to compare the relationship between Yi Jin-Hee Do and Ji Woong-Yu Rim and why one failed when the other worked out, it’s that Yi Jin and Hee Do came from different background. Yi Jin was a struggling grown-up prioritizing his life and Hee Do was a young teenager with all the sources to pursue her wild dream. The gaps in age, life experiences and privileges were highlighted over and over again from the beginning. Given the circumstances, Yi Jin becomes someone who is reluctant to share his pain even if Hee Do is willing to do so. Another thing to jot down is that Hee Do’s mother was never emotionally available for her ever since she lost her late father. If Hee Do ultimately made a decision to call it off with Yi Jin, it’s because she wanted to choose herself over their love. None of them was going to sacrifice a career track for the sake of each other; both were at the point where their careers were on the ascendant but their love failed to bridge the emotional gap. Hee Do didn’t want to feel any lonelier, so she mustered the courage to bid a farewell.\n\nOn the other hand, Ji Woong and Yu Rim didn’t have any deep-rooted trauma and issues like them, so it’s way more convenient for them to hold onto each other while still focusing on the individual goals and growth of each. They shared an equal amount of efforts to be with each other and were willing to make adjustments here and there to make the relationship work until the end. Them having the same age was also a plus point in terms of synchronizing mutual thoughts together.\n\nStill, what upsets us as viewers the most was the fact that there were so many what-ifs of better scenarios in honor of this supposedly wholesome relationship. If only Hee Do received her diary faster and read Yi Jin’s handwritten reply, would it have been possible for them to reunite and get together? If only Yi Jin could learn to share his pains with Hee Do and make her less lonely, would it have been plausible to erase the breakup scenario? If only Hee Do didn’t try breaking up with Yi Jin in her mind when they were separated, would they still have been together?\n\nI believe they would. Yi Jin and his constant love for Hee Do had never flinched for once. He never let Hee Do go until she made the final decision. Cancelling the couple’s plan was also Hee Do’s idea that he followed through, but he still grabbed onto the remaining chance to alter Hee Do’s mind afterwards. It had never occurred to him that Hee Do would call it off since she was his only source of strength and happiness, and Yi Jin only wished to be understood. If only Hee Do could bear with Yi Jin’s self-agony for a while and Yi Jin could make better efforts in communicating with Hee Do during their LDR, I believe that they would have been together and Kim Min Chae (Choi Myung Bin) would have been Baek Min Chae, period.\n\nGiven the ending, the present timeline and Kim Min Chae’s existence brought nothing to the table and only ended up becoming a husband-hunting war to boost the TV rating, I guess. Present Hee Do didn’t have any trace of Hee Do portrayed by Kim Tae Ri, which made it difficult for the viewers to connect with her. The message of fleeting youth could have been delivered just the same with the 2009 timeline, when Yi Jin had become a news anchor and Hee Do was still an athlete but had gotten married already. From the picture alone, it’s obvious that love still lingered and it’s impossible for them to get over each other.\n\nEven when they had to part ways for real at the bus stop as Yi Jin was leaving for the US, it’s so crystal clear that love had never left their heart. Hee Do still ached so much for Yi Jin, and Yi Jin himself never agreed to the breakup. This particular scene hurt so much because, look, their love was just as passionate and moving as it used to when you put them together. It’s only the damn time that got in the way and triggered pains that could’ve been anticipated.\n\nLOVELINES ALERT\n\nNa Hee Do & Baek Yi Jin\n\nFrom complete strangers to passionate lovers, there is something abundant about Hee Do and Yi Jin’s exceptional relationship. It’s nothing superficial; they met and naturally got along without any hidden agenda, they become each other’s most precious person when things are good and even bad. Their unconditional support for each other before love penetrated was a rare gem of connection you can hardly find these days. Relying on coincidence by coincidence without frequent communication, but still managed to become the greatest source of strength to get up for each other was the reason why it should be obvious for Hee Do to be part of Yi Jin’s life, and vice versa.\n\nGiven Hee Do’s immature behavior, Yi Jin looks like a real adult beside her despite only having 4 years of age gap. [SPOILER ALERT] When he caught her going to a night club just for the sake of transferring school, Yi Jin taught her a true life lesson. “Do you know why the law protects minors? Because your imaginations are limited. What did you imagine would happen here? Do you think things would’ve unfolded the way you imagined? Not a chance. If you come to places like this, things you don’t need to experience, shouldn’t experience, that you’re better off not experiencing happen. Because when people do something bad, the imagination of adults and that of minors are worlds apart.” [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nWhenever Hee Do did something ridiculous, Yi Jin would laugh at her and gain some strength. “I like the fact that you’re so reckless. Looking at you reminds me of myself. You’re like me at 18.” On the other hand, Hee Do sees him as someone whom she wants to support and receives support from. She defined their relationship as two people who pursue happiness together, and I find it so admirable. If love means finding little happiness amidst a horrendous circumstance, then Yi Jin was totally whipped already when he could smile a bit despite his sorrowful-looking eyes. All because of Hee Do’s innocent thoughts that he finds adorable. About them doing three-legged race due to her broken slipper, somebody on Reddit mentioned how it symbolizes an equal footing in their relationship. Yi Jin isn’t going to carry Hee Do during tough times. Instead, he is going to be with her through it all and be vulnerable with her. Nobody is lifting or being lifted up, and it’s how a relationship is supposed to be.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT] Just a day before the National Fencing Team Tryouts, Hee Do sought support from Yi Jin and received it. When she asked him why, Yi Jin’s genuine answer touched my heart too. “Because you give me hope. And I keep getting greedy. When you try hard, it makes me want to try hard too. When you accomplish something, you make me want to accomplish something too. You make other people do well, not just yourself.“ [END OF SPOILERS] It’s just a little bittersweet that Hee Do reminds Yi Jin of the youth he was unceremoniously robbed of. She is a light that leads him to the right directions and places.\n\nUnder any circumstances, Yi Jin has always looked after Hee Do in any way possible. When she refused to go home because of the Asian Games controversy, Yi Jin used up his wish for Hee Do to return home. It’s just an enormous way to deliver his genuine affection. When her ankle was slightly injured after recording a video of doing a simultaneous touch with Yu Rim, Yi Jin was willing to throw everything under the bus and scolded his senior just because the thought of hurting Hee Do hurt him more.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT] Controversy aside, Yi Jin is a grown-up who understands his feelings well, unlike Hee Do, who is still unable to get a grasp of what she feels towards him. While Hee Do hadn’t found the correct term to define their relationship, Yi Jin had decided it to be love. When confronted with Hee Do’s ex Cutie Pie, Yi Jin emphasized his stance as someone who would give the world to Hee Do. “I feel her time is more precious than mine, so I don’t want her to waste a single moment on no good experiences. She deserves to have only the greatest experiences. And that is something I can do for her. Did you say she doesn’t know what she is doing? She doesn’t need to. Because I know.” [END OF SPOILERS] Basically Yi Jin was just telling him that Hee Do is too earnest and precious for anyone not to take her seriously.\n\nIt’s not an exaggeration when I say that Hee Do is Yi Jin’s everything, then and now. He loves her in every way and accepts her as she is. On hindsight, Yi Jin had naturally been drawn to become her shield and protect her at any cost. It’s just the nature of his character to protect people who live in his heart, be it his younger brother or Hee Do. His eyes had always been dripping with sweet honey just with the thought of her inside his mind. And heart.\n\nEP13. [SPOILER ALERT] Yi Jin’s profession as a reporter requires him to keep a proper distance with his subject, in this case was Hee Do. He tried his best to protect her from any wound and put his feelings on hold as much as he could. This is just an example of how his love is beyond romantic feelings. Yi Jin managed to resist Hee Do’s romantic advances like her initiating a kiss on him, but all bets were off when she was hurting. It’s only possible to keep a distance if he was the only one struggling, but now that Hee Do was weeping in pain, Yi Jin couldn’t help but concede and finally returned her kiss. [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nI don’t really want to write Baek Yi Jin’s pitiful life in a separate section because it would break my heart even more, so allow me to talk about his mental struggles a bit, which strongly correlate to his relationship with Hee Do. [SPOILER ALERT] About Yu Rim changing her nationality and joining Russian national fencing team due to financial struggles, as well as the horrible 9/11 tragedy, Yi Jin had always been trapped in a martyr complex and self-tortured himself in any way possible. When he felt like hurting Yu Rim after reporting her “betrayal”, Yi Jin decided to change department so that he didn’t have to deal with the risk of disappointing people he’s fond of. When he directly witnessed the aftereffects of 9/11 in the US, he chose to apply to become a NYC correspondent. His life got much darker and jaded Yi Jin was gradually dependent on alcohol and cigarettes to cope up with his PTSD, nights of sleep deprivation and cold nightmares. He also had some avoidant traits and the tendencies to shoulder all burdens just by himself. Consequently, it’s only legitimate that Hee Do felt ignored, left hanging with vague communications that didn’t convey any burden to share with her. Him becoming a NYC correspondent was also a one-sided decision that paid no respect to Hee Do’s stance as part of his life that shouldn’t be kept in the dark about his major life plans.\n\nOnce Hee Do was finally exhausted of Yi Jin’s endless apologies that sounded like broken records, and that their love no longer brought her strength, she made up her mind to conclude what was once her everything. It’s because Yi Jin was gradually becoming like her mom, a person she used to loathe because of putting her career over everything. “I’m still sending you my support. But the more I do, the farther apart we grow. My support isn’t reaching him anymore.” How ironic considering that they used to find abundant comfort from each other through a repeated voicemail in the public payphone, but the easier access of communication later didn’t necessarily ease their love.\n\nYi Jin’s circumstances were indeed depressing and ugly, but at some point he was overbearingly-consumed with the situation that he began dismissing Hee Do’s unwavering support. The 9/11 tragedy had fundamentally changed him in a way that was irreversible. It might have also been his nature of wanting to positively impact the world, since he used to dream about working for NASA in the US and participated in two important clubs at high school. Yi Jin himself refused to go numb with pain and chose to nurture his empathy even if it cost his precious intertwined fate with Hee Do.\n\nThe process was beautiful, but the result was exceptionally painful. I couldn’t get over their breakup scene where they seemed to purposely hurt each other with words sharper than a knife out of exhaustion and deep frustrations, but at least it’s got perfect wording of closure to describe just how meaningful one for the other back then, up to the present time.\n\n“You comforted me just by being present. I grew up alone and I was lonely, but you held me in a warm embrace. At times when I didn’t believe in myself, I believed in you who believed me. That made things possible. At times, the world seemed complete because we were together. I learned what love is, thanks to you. Now I know what a breakup is. Thankyou, and I have loved you with all my heart. Goodbye, Baek Yi Jin.”\n\n“You helped me get back on my feet during the hardest times of my life. If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t be where I am now. You made me smile. With you, I felt like I was on top of the world even when I had nothing. I now know what perfect happiness is. You will have no idea how much your love has brightened up my life. Thankyou for everything. Goodbye, Na Hee Do.”\n\n[END OF SPOILERS]\n\nGo Yu Rim & Moon Ji Woong\n\nContrary to our main OTP’s relationship, Ji Woong and Yu Rim really look like those innocent schoolmates who have a crush on each other. If it weren’t for Yu Rim’s hostility towards Hee Do in the first half of the drama, I would have regarded this pairing merely as a cute high school romance. Regardless, Ji Woong is always nice and sincere when it comes to Yu Rim, and it shows. [SPOILER ALERT] When Yu Rim was down because of the Asian Games controversy, Ji Woong made her a gold medal to cheer her up. It’s a gold medal she didn’t need to earn, and it made Ji Woong’s gold medal more special. Later when Ji Woong managed to apprehend his own feelings better, he asked Yu Rim’s permission to confess to her. Ji Woong wanted to make sure that the feelings are mutual before making a real move so that it wouldn’t become a burden for Yu Rim in case she didn’t like him back, and that thought alone is just too sweet to handle. [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nIt’s also noteworthy that a guy like Ji Woong is one of a kind. He didn’t surrender to difficult circumstances and had been preparing so that they don’t drift apart. [SPOILER ALERT] Yu Rim actually wanted to push him away when she was about to leave for Russia and avoided making promises, but he reassured her that there are still ways to overcome their long-distance problems. [END OF SPOILERS] Ji Woong worked hard for the relationship to keep going, and he finally earned it as he should have. “Even if all you can give me is misery, I’m up for it. It’s fine as long as we’re in it together.”\n\nSPECIAL SHOUTOUT: Ji Woong & Seung Wan’s friendship\n\nHaving an opposite-gender friendship without any potential love line idea is a rare commodity in Kdramaland. Never has it been hinted that one of them has feelings for the other. Ji Woong sticks with her because their moms have been friends since forever and his mom finds Seung Wan trustworthy, and Seung Wan hangs out with him because Ji Woong lets her have so much fun between her utterly boring life. This kind of friendship that looks after each other with the sufficient amount of affection is just too adorable.\n\nSPECIAL SHOUTOUT: Yi Jin & Yu Rim’s connection\n\nI was quite relieved that the relationship between Yi Jin and Yu Rim was nothing like having romantic feelings for each other in the past and got entangled again. It wasn’t so shallow either; Yi JIn’s family financially supported her fencing, and Yu Rim looked up to Yi Jin as an older brother. She once mistook him as the first love, to which Yi Jin corrected that her first love was the idea of him riding a cool sport car during his glory days in the past. The conversations between them were just as convenient despite some tensions at times. Again, it’s Yi Jin’s nature to become an older brother to spread his wings and protect those beneath him, in this case it’s Yu Rim who was 4 years younger.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nYouth dramas always make me look back and reminisce all memories with a smile. Twenty Five Twenty One (2022) has been a wholesome journey of reminiscence despite the heartbreaking ending. I would also love to clown myself that the drama ended in EP14; EP15 and EP16 were awfully-painful to re-watch and review so I wouldn’t go to great lengths and put my heart into despair only to witness their love crumbling down like that again. Please don’t convince me otherwise cause I won’t.\n\nWhen we were young and ignorant, we were stomped by failures over failures. It’s normal to give up when things go astray, but Hee Do has a better way to cope up with any circumstance she encounters. “It feels better when I turn my tragedy into a comedy. I lost in so many matches, but I couldn’t let everyday be tragic just because I lost every time. Laughing makes it easier to forget. You have to forget to move on.”\n\nOne of the greatest ways to send support to somebody is to let her know her positive qualities she might not be aware of. Yi Jin understands her better than she herself does, and he conveyed his faith in her capabilities. “You are by far the most experienced fencer when it comes to losing. Those losses were blocks to build yourself stairs leading up. Think about it, now you’ve got the highest staircase. Take your time to climb it and take whatever you want.”\n\nTalent means nothing without hard work and practice. Even when people told Hee Do to quit fencing because she wasn’t making progress, she didn’t because she has faith in what her late father said. To her daughter, Hee Do passed down the message. “Do you think your skills improve consistently? They don’t. Your skills don’t improve consistently but in steps. And usually when people hit a wall, they want to give up. Once they get past this corner, they will improve exponentially, but they don’t realize it. Why so? Because they think the stagnancy will last forever.”\n\nLikewise, skills may improve or even decrease depending on the amount of effort you invested at the beginning. Ji Woong, who always ranked last at school, was asked if he was embarrassed for his poor grades. He didn’t, because he didn’t even study for it. “Not trying but hoping to do well is more embarrassing in my opinion.”\n\n“Sometimes, saying that we can do something can be more discouraging. We haven’t learned about a world in which you don’t have to do well and can fail. Still, let’s do the most we can. Let’s do our best. But I still hope that even if we fail, we will be strong enough to get back up again.”\n\nGRADE\n\n9,5/10\n\n(Just so you know, if it weren’t for the uproar resulted from the controversy and supposedly disappointing ending, I would give it 13/10 without hesitation)\n\nLastly, I am also fond of Kim Se Jeong’s version of Twenty Five Twenty One song (originally sung by Jaurim)."
