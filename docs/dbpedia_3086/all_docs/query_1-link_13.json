        "text": "Long before Twenty One Pilots developed a cult following, the Columbus, Ohio natives were determined to not be put into a box. From their first EP, 2009's Johnny Boy, they've blended elements of emo, rap, alt-pop, electronica, incorporating hardcore and hip-hop into their shows. \"No one knew where to put us,\" drummer Josh Dun told USA Today in 2014. \"But we've approached live shows as a way to build something from nothing.\"\n\nIn the decade since, the band's sheer determination and eclectic onstage personality have made them one of the biggest rock groups of their generation. They're equally as spontaneous and intriguing in their music, building an entire world through dynamic soundscapes and visuals — and their new album, Clancy, ties all of it together.\n\nAs the band revealed in a press release upon announcing the album in March, Clancy \"marks the final chapter in an ambitious multi-album narrative\" that began with Blurryface in 2015. But it certainly doesn't feel like an ending; Clancy further expands on the theatrical style and eclectic sound they've showcased from the start, offering both a resolution and an evolution.\n\nWhile the makings of the signature Twenty One Pilots aesthetic began with its original formation as a trio — lead singer Tyler Joseph and his friends Nick Thomas and Chris Salih — it truly took shape when Dun replaced Thomas and Salih in 2011. Dun and Joseph had a common goal to re-formulate the way songs and shows were crafted; the drummer utilized samples and backing tapes at their gigs, helping the band dive deeper into their alternative style by fusing everything from reggae to pop together.\n\nAs a newly formed duo, Twenty One Pilots issued their album Regional at Best in 2011 — their last release before they signed to a major label (though, as they told Huffpost in 2013, they since consider the record a \"glorified mixtape\"). After significant social media buzz and selling out a show at Newport Music Hall in Columbus, the duo was courted by a dozen record labels, which set the stage for their big break.\n\n\"We went from no one in the industry caring to all of the sudden it was the hot thing for every label, independent and major, to be interested in some way,\" Joseph told Columbus Monthly in 2012 upon signing to Fueled by Ramen, which the singer said they were drawn to because they were able to retain \"creative control\" — a factor that would become increasingly more important with each release.\n\nTheir 2013 album Vessel — which featured a combination of new and re-recorded songs from Regional At Best —spawned the band's first charting single, \"Holding On to You,\" a rap-meets-pop track that oscillates from sensitive indie ballad to energetic anthem. Not only had they begun making a mark commercially, but it seemed to be the album that Twenty One Pilots felt they were hitting their stride creatively, too: \"I know some people might not like this, but I kind of view Vessel as our first record,\" Joseph told Kerrang!at the time.\n\nThough the character \"Clancy\" first came about with 2018's Trench, Twenty One Pilots actually introduced the world that Clancy would eventually live in with 2015's Blurryface, which focused on a titular character who embodies depression and anxiety. \"It's a guy who kind of represents all the things that I as an individual, but also everyone around me, are insecure about,\" Joseph said of his alter-ego in a 2015 interview with MTV.\n\nTo convey the \"feeling of suffocation\" caused by insecurities from what he creates, Joseph began wearing black paint on his neck and hands in music videos and on stage to represent the \"Blurryface\" character. As Joseph told the Recording Academy in 2015, the \"common thread\" of all of the songs on Blurryface was that Joseph's alter-ego would be defeated, and each song wrestled with the dichotomy between darkness and optimism.\n\nWhile Vessel kickstarted the band's commercial success, Blurryface saw their popularity explode and resulted in the band's best-selling single, the eerie rap-rock anthem \"Stressed Out.\" The commercial success of Blurryface helped their hot streak continue into 2016 with the release of \"Heathens.\" While the song served as the first single from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, its haunting production fits right into the world the pair had begun building with Blurryface. Their acclaim continued to grow, with Twenty One Pilots earning their first GRAMMY in 2017 for \"Stressed Out\" in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance Category — and, in line with their affinity for stunts, dropping their pants as they accepted their award.\n\nAhead of the release of their 2018 concept album Trench, the lore surrounding \"Clancy\" really began. Twenty One Pilots began leaving clues for fans on a website known as DMAORG, which featured black-and-white images and letters from \"Clancy,\" who ultimately became the protagonist of the album. Twenty One Pilots fans (often referred to as the\"Skeleton Clique\") began clamoring to deduce puzzling clues and posting their theories about the narrative's endgame online.\n\nWith Trench, they found more characters and a deeper narrative. The overall album depicts \"a world where nine dictatorial bishops keep the inhabitants (Tyler included) of a fictional place named Dema from escaping its controlling clutches, with the help of the Banditos — a rebel organization (featuring Josh).\" On a larger scale, the album grapples with mental illness, suicide and an expansion on Joseph's insecurities from Blurryface.\n\nBut Trench isn't one cohesive story; rather, it's a series of songs with clues embedded within. For instance, in \"Morph,\" the character Nico is introduced, who is also the subject of \"Nico and The Niners.\" From there, fans gleaned that Nico was one of nine bishops controlling the citizens of Dema, and those nine bishops were represented by each of the songs on Blurryface. The bombastic \"Pet Cheetah\" references that the house has vultures on the roof which alludes to it — and Joseph's home — being Dema.\n\nAs with Blurryface, visuals became an integral part of the album cycle. This time, they used them to illustrate life in the dystopian Dema, which personifies depression through the trilogy of music videos for \"Levitate,\" \"Nico and The Niners\" and \"Jumpsuit.\" While Joseph's black-painted neck and hands signaled the Blurryface era, dark green clothing marked with yellow tape signaled the Trench era. During this time, the \"Clancy\" character remained shrouded in mystery — though through videos and letters shared by the band, fans theorized that it is an opposing force to \"Blurryface.\"\n\nBy the time Twenty One Pilots' 2021 album, Scaled and Icy, came around, fans quickly noticed that it paid homage to \"Clancy\" as an anagram for \"Clancy is dead,\" while also acknowledging the COVID-19 pandemic as a shortened phrase for \"scaled back and isolated.\" While Twenty One Pilots could have leaned into the harrowing events of lockdown, they instead chose to focus on what has driven the band itself, the power of imagination — something that has been behind much of the band's work since Blurryface.\n\nWith the album came three singles — the propulsive \"Shy Away,\" the heartwrenching banger \"Choker\" and the funk-pop-tinged \"Saturday — which were recorded when the duo was working virtually during the pandemic. Unlike the past two projects which grappled with this doomed slant, Scaled and Icy pivoted toward a sunnier sound, signaling a shift in the narrative. But it didn't mean the dark world of Blurryface and Trench were completely in the past; upon Scaled and Icy's release, Joseph revealed to Apple Music that there would be \"one more record\" and \"an explanation and book end\" before moving onto another story.\n\nThree years following the release of Scaled and Icy, fans began receiving letters from the \"Sacred Municipality of Dema\" — a reference to the fictional city featured on Trench, signaling what appeared to be a new era diving deeper into the band's lore. Since the previous record featured an anagram about \"Clancy\" in its title, it seemed natural that the next album would be named after the character.\n\n\"'Clancy' is our protagonist in this story we've been telling, stretched out over the last several records. 'Clancy' is the type of character who, for a long time, didn't know if he was a leader or not, didn't want to take that responsibility,\" Joseph told BBC Radio earlier this year.\n\nAs the singer had hinted in the Scaled and Icy era, Clancy brings fans back to the darker narrative that began with Blurryfacet. After Joseph's character escapes Dema a handful of times, joins a rebellion, then is captured again, he finally has the same abilities as the bishops and aims to free the people of Dema. The album attempts to answer a few conceptual questions along the way.\n\nClancy's blistering first single, \"Overcompensate\" is inherently hopeful, and answers the long-lingering question fans have been wondering: Who is \"Clancy\"? According to the psych-funk number, it's been Joseph all along (\"If you can't see, I am Clancy/ Prodigal son, done running, come up with Josh Dun.\") As Joseph further explained to BBC Radio, \"[With] 'Overcompensate', there's a bit of a confidence and swagger in it that the character needed to embody in order to take on the new role in the story we've been telling, and Clancy is gonna rise up as that person.\"\n\nBut much of the album focuses less on the literal lore, instead tackling the overarching themes of its counterparts: Joseph's struggles with mental health. Despite the darker, anxious nature of the album's lyrics, the majority of Clancy has a self-assured breeziness to it, jumping off of the upbeat Scaled and Icy sound.\n\nOn the ballad-like closer, \"Paladin Strait\" — named after a fictional body of water off the coast of Dema —Twenty One Pilots really digs into the narrative of \"Clancy\" the character in a literal way again. What's revealed is the final battle between \"Clancy\" and \"Blurryface\" with no apparent winner — alluding to the idea that there is not necessarily a triumph over depression. In the final line, the band offers a callback to a lyric from Blurryface: \"So few, so proud, so emotional/ Hello, Clancy.\"\n\nWhile the ending may remain ambiguous, it may not be a coincidence that Twenty One Pilots postponed Clancy's release date by a week (from May 17 to May 24) in order to finish filming music videos for each of the tracks, all of which were unveiled upon the album's release. So, there's still hope that fans will find out definitively what happened to \"Clancy\" — or maybe it means his story isn't completely finished.\n\nHow Andrew Watt Became Rock's Big Producer: His Work With Paul McCartney, Ozzy Osbourne, Pearl Jam, & More\n\nAs a month that welcomes rising temperatures and blooming flowers, May will also bring a flurry of new albums. In its first week, Dua Lipa will put forth her third LP and inject the world with a good dose of Radical Optimism. She will be joined by Sia and her tenth album, Reasonable Woman, and by R&B newcomer 4Batz, who will debut with the mixtape U Made Me St4r.\n\nOn May 17, it's Billie Eilish's turn to drop the much-awaited Hit Me Hard and Soft, as well as the return of Cage the Elephant with Neon Pill, and former One Direction member Zayn experimenting with new sounds on Room Under the Stairs.\n\nLater on, Twenty One Pilots drop their final concept album, Clancy, and Sam Tompkins and Tems will both make their studio album debuts with hi my name is insecure and Born in the Wild, respectively. The month will close off with Pakistani singer Arooj Aftab's Night Reign, but before that, there's plenty of other releases to explore.\n\nGRAMMY.com compiled a list with 15 must-listen albums dropping in May 2024 so that you can take a stroll at this month's burgeoning, diverse garden.\n\nDua Lipa - Radical Optimism\n\nRelease date: May 3\n\n\"A couple years ago, a friend introduced me to the term 'radical optimism',\" said Dua Lipa in a press statement about her upcoming third album, out May 3. \"It struck me — the idea of going through chaos gracefully and feeling like you can weather any storm.\"\n\nThis perspective on life inspired the British-Albanian singer both personally and musically. Radical Optimism comes brimming with the \"pure joy and happiness of having clarity in situations that once seemed impossible to face.\" With 11 tracks and production by Danny L Harle and Kevin Parker, the record spins psychedelia and Britpop into a \"tribute to UK rave culture,\" as Lipa described it in an interview for Rolling Stone.\n\nRead more: Dua Lipa Danced The Night Away with \"Training Season\" & \"Houdini\" | 2024 GRAMMYs Performance\n\nA preview of the sounds she will approach in the successor of 2020's Future Nostalgia can be seen through singles \"Houdini,\" \"Training Session,\" and \"Illusion.\" Starting June, Lipa will perform a string of concerts in Europe and headline Glastonbury Festival in the U.K.\n\nKamasi Washington - Fearless Movement\n\nRelease date: May 3\n\nIt's been six years since jazz virtuoso Kamasi Washington released his latest album, 2016's Heaven and Earth. Hence, his return is highly anticipated: Fearless Movement will come out on May 3, and is described in a press release as Washington's first \"dance album.\"\n\n\"It's not literal,\" he explained. \"Dance is movement and expression, and in a way it's the same thing as music — expressing your spirit through your body. That's what this album is pushing.\"\n\nFearless Movement was also inspired by the here-and-now, and the changes that Washington went through since the birth of his first child. \"Being a father means the horizon of your life all of a sudden shows up,\" he shared. \"My mortality became more apparent to me, but also my immortality — realizing that my daughter is going to live on and see things that I'm never going to see. I had to become comfortable with this, and that affected the music that I was making.\"\n\nWashington's daughter also earned songwriting credits in \"Asha The First,\" after coming up with a melody while playing on the piano. In addition to her, the LP also features appearances from André 3000 on the flute, Terrace Martin, Thundercat, Patrice Quinn, George Clinton, BJ The Chicago Kid, and more.\n\nSoon after the release, Washington will kick off a North American tour throughout June, and then head over to Europe and the U.K. in October and November.\n\nCharlotte Day Wilson - Cyan Blue\n\nRelease date: May 3\n\nFollowing her acclaimed 2021 debut LP, Alpha, Canadian multihyphenate Charlotte Day Wilson dives into Cyan Blue for her sophomore release. \"You passed through me like a light, but part of you would always remain,\" she shared about the record on Instagram. \"Imprinted, stacked, a palimpsest of love and pain that left me with a world of blue. These are the stories and the palette I was given to paint them with.\"\n\nRead more: Press Play At Home: Watch Charlotte Day Wilson Perform A Lithe Version Of \"I Can Only Whisper\"\n\nDay Wilson has a gift for turning intimate reflections into timeless artwork, and this album sees her experimenting with a more carefree approach. \"Before, I was extremely intentional about creating music with a strong foundation, a bed of artistic integrity…\" she shared in a press release. \"But that was a bit stifling, like, ‘Let me just make a great piece of art that will stand the test of time, no pressure.' Now, I think I'm getting out of this frozen state of needing everything to be perfect. I'm more interested in capturing feelings in the moment as they happen and leaving them in that moment.\"\n\nCyan Blue will feature 13 tracks, including singles \"I Don't Love You\" and \"Canopy.\" For those lucky to experience Day Wilson's inimitable voice live, she will be touring North America from May through July.\n\nMdou Moctar - Funeral for Justice\n\nRelease date: May 3\n\n\"This album is really different for me,\" shares Mdou Moctar, the band's namesake, singer, and guitarist, in a press release about their upcoming release, Funeral for Justice. \"Now the problems of terrorist violence are more serious in Africa. When the U.S. and Europe came here, they said they're going to help us, but what we see is really different. They never help us to find a solution.\"\n\nFuneral For Justice doesn't hold back on examining the struggles of Niger and of the Tuareg people (of which Moctar, guitarist Ahmoudou Madassane and drummer Souleymane Ibrahim belong.) Recorded during the two years that the band spent touring after the release of 2021's acclaimed Afrique Victime, it is described as \"louder, faster, and more wild,\" with fiery guitar solos and \"passionately political\" lyrics that permeate nine meteoric tracks.\n\n\"Mdou Moctar has been a strong anti-colonial band ever since I've been a part of it,\" adds bassist and producer Mikey Coltun. \"France came in, f****d up the country, then said ‘you're free.' And they're not.\" So far, the band shared lead single \"Funeral for Justice\" and the mesmerizing \"Imouhar\" — an elegy to their Tamasheq language, which is at risk of dying out. \"People here are just using French,\" said Moctar. \"They're starting to forget their own language. We feel like in a hundred years no one will speak good Tamasheq, and that's so scary for us.\"\n\nAfter performing at Coachella in April, the band is set to tour the U.S. in June and Europe and the U.K. in August. The run includes several festival appearances, like Bonnaroo, Green River, and Glastonbury.\n\n4Batz - U Made Me A St4r\n\nRelease date: May 3\n\nViral R&B and hip hop singer 4Batz initially announced his debut mixtape, U Made Me A St4r, for April, but the release was postponed for a month. \"Been making some of the best s**t of my life the last couple weeks,\" he shared on Instagram. \"So ima push the mixtape to 5.3.24 so it can be perfect for yall.\"\n\nThe contrast between 4Batz's tough appearance and high-pitched love songs propelled him to the stars. He garnered the attention of artists like Kanye West, Robin Thicke, and Drake — who ultimately signed him to his record label OVO in order to release this mixtape. Drake also featured on a remix of 4Batz's 2023 hit, \"act ii: date @ 8.\"\n\nAlthough there's not much info on the tracklist or any upcoming activities, the Dallas-born singer is excited by the mystery: \"I'm really in love with this EP,\" he told Billboard in a recent interview. This EP's gon' break the f**kin' internet, world, all this s**t.\"\n\nSia - Reasonable Woman\n\nRelease date: May 3\n\nSince the release of lead single \"Gimme Love\" in September 2023, fans have been eagerly awaiting for Australian superstar Sia's new album. Titled Reasonable Woman and set to drop on May 3, this is her 10th studio release overall, and her first proper pop solo LP since 2016's This Is Acting.\n\nAnticipation only grew as Sia shared a number of lofty singles in past months, including the Kylie Minogue collaboration \"Dance Alone,\" \"Incredible\" featuring Labrinth, and the recent \"Fame Won't Love You,\" with Paris Hilton. Through the LP's 15 tracks, the singer collaborated further with Chaka Khan, Tierra Whack, Missy Elliott, Kaliii and Jimmy Jolliff.\n\nBehind the scenes, Reasonable Woman also held a star-studded list of producers, engineers, and writers, such as Greg Kurstin, Jesse Shatkin, Benny Blanco, Bülow, Cashmere Cat, Mark \"Spike\" Stent, Rosalía and more.\n\nBillie Eilish - Hit Me Hard and Soft\n\nRelease date: May 17\n\nIn April, when a series of billboards and posters with lyric snippets and Billie Eilish's signature \"blosh\" logo appeared in major global cities, fans knew that her anticipated third LP would be announced soon. A few days later, the GRAMMY and Oscar-winning artist shared a video teaser for Hit Me Hard and Soft, set to release on May 17.\n\nEilish took it to Instagram to disclose her excitement, and that she is \"not doing singles i wanna give it to you all at once.\" As usual, the record was written by herself and brother, producer, and musical collaborator Finneas O'Connell. According to a press release, Hit Me Hard and Soft includes ten tracks, and \"does exactly as the title suggests; hits you hard and soft both lyrically and sonically, while bending genres and defying trends along the way.\" The album launch also focuses on sustainability by using \"the most sustainable practices available\" with a page on her website dedicated to ecological production details.\n\nIn an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe, the musician teased title track \"Hit Me Hard and Soft\" and b-side \"Chihiro,\" which references the main character in Studio Ghibli's 2001 animation, Spirited Away. \"I feel like every time you put anything out, it feels like your nudes leaked a little bit, and I think this [album], specifically, is like that,\" Eilish added. \"Something that Finneas and I said to a couple of people when we were starting to play it for people was that we kind of made the album that if somebody had said, you know, ‘I want you to make an album, and no one is gonna hear it'... We pretty much, with exceptions, made that album. We made an album without really any — or much — thought of other people.\"\n\nOf Montreal - Lady on the Cusp\n\nRelease date: May 17\n\nLady on the Cusp is the 19th album from of Montreal, the band project of multi-instrumentalist and singer Kevin Barnes. Inspired by a relocation from Athens, GA — where Barnes lived for nearly three decades — to Vermont together with his partner, songwriter Christina Schneider (aka Locate S,1), Lady is shaped by his reflections on that experience.\n\nAccording to a press statement, the album is a \"reintroduction\" to of Montreal, comprising 10 \"funny and sad, sexy and brooding, playful and serious\" tracks. This carefree approach can be seen on lead single \"Yung Hearts Bleed Free,\" which was influenced by Leos Carax's 1984 film Boy Meets Girl and by Bootsy's Rubber Band, as well as on the laid back \"Rude Girl on Rotation.\"\n\nTwo weeks after dropping the album, of Montreal will embark on a major tour across the U.S., starting in Athens, GA, and wrapping it up on July 2 in Asheville, NC.\n\nCage the Elephant - Neon Pill\n\nRelease date: May 17\n\nAfter winning Best Rock Album at the 2020 GRAMMYs for Social Cues, Cage the Elephant went through a rough patch. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, lead vocalist Matt Shultz weathered a mental health crisis, and the band lost several close family members and friends, including Matt and Brad Shultz's father.\n\nFive years later, the alt-rock sextet is ready to reemerge with their sixth studio album, Neon Pill, out May 17. \"To me, Neon Pill is the first record where we were consistently uninfluenced, and I mean that in a positive way,\" said Matt in a statement. \"Everything is undoubtedly expressed through having settled into finding our own voice. We've always drawn inspiration from artists we love, and at times we've even emulated some of them to a certain degree. With this album, having gone through so much, life had almost forced us into becoming more and more comfortable with ourselves… We just found a uniqueness in simply existing.\"\n\nProduced by John Hill, the record spans 12 tracks that \"alchemized a season of tragedy and turbulence\" into a whirlwind of riffs and emotions. A preview of Neon Pill can be seen through the title track and singles \"Out Loud\" and \"Good Time.\" To celebrate their return, the band will tour North America throughout the summer, including performances at Bonnaroo, Hangout Music Festival, and Oceans Calling.\n\nZayn - Room Under the Stairs\n\nRelease date: May 17\n\nFor his fourth full-length album, Room Under the Stairs, British singer and One Direction alum Zayn enlisted an unforeseen co-producer: Dave Cobb. Known for his work with Chris Stapleton, Brandi Carlile, Bruce Springsteen, and Lady Gaga, Cobb is responsible for aiding Zayn to step into a new musical direction.\n\nSwiping his signature moody R&B, Zayn dives into country and adult contemporary for the upcoming release, as can be seen in debuted singles \"What I Am\" and \"Alienated.\" In an interview for the Call Her Daddy podcast last year, the singer shared, \"I'm doing a record I don't think people are really gonna expect. It's a different sound for me. And it's got some more narrative going on, like real-life experiences and stuff. My daughter's mentioned in there a couple of times\".\n\n\"I think the intention behind this album fully is for the listener to get more insight on me personally as a human being,\" Zayn explained in a teaser video. The 15-track collection follows up 2021's Nobody Is Listening, and was written over the course of several years at Zayn's home in rural Pennsylvania. \"That's why it's raw,\" he added. \"It's just me writing this. I didn't want anybody else to be in between me and the music and the music and the people listening to it.\"\n\nTwenty One Pilots - Clancy\n\nRelease date: May 17\n\nOn May 17, 2015, Twenty One Pilots released their breakthrough LP, Blurryface. The record also marked the beginning of an intricate concept album series — which is due to come to a conclusion almost a decade later, on May 17 of this year.\n\nTitled Clancy, the final piece of the puzzle states that \"a new chapter begins,\" while making several references to the GRAMMY-winning duo's past works. On lead single \"Overcompensate,\" for example, they mirror the outro of \"Levitate\" and rehash lyrics from \"Bandito,\" both tracks off their 2018 LP, Trench. Clancy was produced by frontman Tyler Joseph and Paul Meany, and contains 13 tracks.\n\nMost recently, TOP shared the single \"Next Semester,\" alongside dates for an extensive world tour that will cross North America, Australia, New Zealand, The U.K., and Europe.\n\nSam Tompkins - hi, my name is insecure\n\nRelease date: May 24\n\n\"I really like being in the company of my friends,\" shared rising British singer Sam Tompkins in a press statement. \"But if you take me out of my comfort zone, and have me hang out at a party or an event or whatever, I just go inside myself and I find any excuse to get out of it.\"\n\nThat statement helps explain why Tompkins titled his anticipated debut album hi, my name is insecure, set to drop on May 24. Despite a genuine talent to produce stirring songs, the Brighton native still struggles with social anxiety and depression — themes that appear often in his lyrics, and contribute to his global resonance.\n\nTompkins is \"championing authenticity without taking himself too seriously,\" and that might be why his work is so relevant. A tracklist for the LP has yet to be revealed, but Tompkins's sensitive writing can be seen in a slew of singles, including \"phones in heaven,\" \"someone else,\" and \"see me.\"\n\nTems - Born in the Wild\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nNigerian singer Tems earned the eyes and the ears of international media with her Afrobeats-infused R&B. First raising attention with her feature in Wizkid's 2020 single \"Essence,\" she later built up a devoted fandom through two EPs: 2020's For Broken Ears and 2021's If Orange Was a Place. In 2022, she was credited as a featured artist in Future's \"Wait For U,\" which led her to win a GRAMMY for Best Melodic Rap Performance.\n\nThis month, Tems will finally release her long-awaited debut album, Born in the Wild. The official announcement came with a teaser video for the title track, disclosed one day after her Coachella set in April. \"It's all over the news, all over the news, I know this/ Under the sun, struggling to find my focus/ When I was young, younger then/ I was always running away,\" she sings, reflecting on her childhood in Lagos. \"I grew up in the wilderness/ Didn't know much about openness.\"\n\nBorn in the Wild follows Tems' 2023 singles, \"Me & U\" and \"Not an Angel.\" The singer has yet to reveal further info about the record, as well as a definite release date.\n\nKameron Marlowe - Keepin' the Lights On\n\nRelease date: May 31\n\nPowerhouse country singer Kameron Marlowe is gearing up to release his sophomore effort, Keepin' the Lights On, at the end of May. \"The namesake of the album came from a conversation with my dad over the holidays about how he's always thanking the man upstairs for keeping it all together, especially when times get tough,\" he shared in a statement.\n\n\"For me, this record is a reminder of hard work, dedication and keeping the promises that we make,\" he continued. Featuring 16 tracks, including previously released singles \"Quit You,\" \"Strangers\" with Ella Langley, and \"Tennessee Don't Mind,\" Marlowe stated that the LP \"explores everything from loss to love, depression to joy, and overcoming the voices in your head telling you you're not good enough.\"\n\n\"It's still crazy to me that people are listening to a small town boy from Kannapolis, North Carolina, but here I am releasing my second album. I can't wait for y'all to hear it,\" he added. Marlowe is currently on his Strangers 2024 North American tour, where he plays some of his new tracks.\n\nArooj Aftab - Night Reign\n\nRelease date: May 31\n\nJust like the night, Pakistani singer Arooj Aftab's voice is deep and mysterious. Unsurprisingly, the night is also her \"biggest source of inspiration,\" as she shared in a recent press release about her upcoming record, Night Reign, out May 31.\n\nFollowing 2021's Vulture Prince (from which single \"Mohabbat\" won Best Global Music Performance at the 2022 GRAMMYs), the album is a nine-song compilation about how \"some nights are for falling in love, some are for solitude and introspection, some are to be annoyed at a forced social gathering — and so go the stories of Night Reign.\" The list of collaborators include the soulful Cautious Clay, musical ensemble Chocolate Genius, jazz artist James Francies, and more.\n\nAftab shared the single \"Raat Ki Rani\" as a preview of the album, and announced a North America, U.K., and Europe tour throughout the rest of the year. She will also support Khruangbin for a run of fall shows in Washington, DC, St. Louis, MO, and New Orleans, LA.\n\nInside Neil Young & Crazy Horse's 'F##IN' UP': Where All Nine Songs Came From"
