        "text": "Appropriately enough for a band with the word “confessional” in its name, Dashboard Confessional started with singer-songwriter Chris Carrabba alone, pouring his heart out. The first Dashboard Confessional album, 2000’s The Swiss Army Romance, was a solo side project for Carrabba, who was the singer for hard rock/emo band Further Seems Forever. The sparse acoustic sound of Dashboard Confessional’s early releases ended up defining the emo genre as much as the heavier sounds of bands like FSF, though, thanks especially to 2002 hit single “Screaming Infidelities.” Once Carrabba left FSF, Dashboard became a full-time job.\n\nDashboard Confessional has released six studio albums with various lineups, all built around Carrabba’s emotionally vulnerable songwriting. Although it’s been eight years since the last full Dashboard album, Carrabba recently told Billboard that he has at least 40 songs ready for another album, and the band teased fans with a four-song covers EP in January. For Carrabba, it’s still all about baring his soul in his music. “I have something to say, not just a nice thing to sing,” he told Billboard about the new songs. Plenty of people are still listening.\n\nThe Pearl at Palms, 8 p.m. July 15, starting at $55 plus tax and fee, must be accompanied by 21+. 702.944.3200"
