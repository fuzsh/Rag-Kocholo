        "text": "Dashboard Confessional was conceived while Carrabba was still fronting Further Seems Forever (the first time). The name comes from the song “The Sharp Hint of New Tears” and the lyrics “on the way home/this car hears my confessions”. The Swiss Army Romance was DC’s debut, released in 2000 and featuring the aforementioned song and the original, guitar-only version of “Screaming Infidelities”, which, when re-released on 2001’s The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most ended up winning a surprise MTV2 Award at 2002’s MTV VMAs. The latter release featured a full backing band, and by 2003’s follow-up A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar Carrabba was joined permanently by John Lefler (guitar/keys) Scott Schoenbeck (bass) and Mike Marsh (drums).\n\nThree albums later, it was hiatus time for the group in 2010. In that time, Carrabba reunited with Further Seems Forever (who had a different vocalist on every album) and started a folk-based project called Twin Forks. He’s still in both acts, but now it looks like we might finally get a new Dashboard album.\n\nAlthough The Get Up Kids’ 1999 landmark Something To Write Home About really got the label going, it was the success of Dashboard Confessional (among others) that sent Vagrant Records to new heights. The label was the spot for emo, indie rock and punk. A long time ago I remember reading co-founder (and Carrabba’s manager) Rich Egan recalling seeing Carrabba perform early on as something like “he was sitting with an acoustic guitar at a hardcore show, and I thought that was the most punk thing ever”. I wish I could find the quote, but yeah – it was a compliment anyway!\n\nI’ve always liked Dashboard Confessional because they’re just good, but I also have some…affection?…for Chris Carrabba because several people think I look like him – I always joke that he’s my “twin brother from another mother”. I don’t know, you be the judge – here’s me:\n\nAnd see the display pic above again for Carrabba. Overall, I can see it. He does have way more hair than me because 1) I just got a haircut and 2) I’m thinning on top anyway (yay!) but in the face, I do get it. We’re far from twinsies and Carrabba is way dreamier, though. Just a couple of good ol’ Italian boys right!?"
