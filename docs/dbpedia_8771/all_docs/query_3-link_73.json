        "text": "Dashboard Confessional\n\nBirmingham Carling Academy 2\n\n21st January 2008\n\nHaving the chance to see an acoustic performance of Chris Carrabba’s alias of Dashboard Confessional is a real treat, especially as in recent times Dashboard’s offering have been more electric. Luckily with the turn back to the more stripped down sound on latest album The Shade of Poison Tree, Carrabba has returned to his acoustic sound and the UK.\n\nSupport comes from British band The Tournaments, who recently supported Lucero and played the much smaller Bar Academy here last month. They’re an okay band, but seem lost somewhere in between the harsh British indie and the more melodic American kind. They clearly have some fans here who are clapping along to their nostalgic longing sounding song, but the majority of people are clearly just waiting for Carrabba, who makes an appearance wandering around the crowd.\n\nCarrabba opens the show with Swiss Army Romance, a song from his first album, which is usually is just Chris and his guitar, but the enthusiastic audience provide almost another instrument in their backing vocals. In fact the whole show becomes a sing-a-long and Carrabba himself comments that this is the best way to hear his songs, they’re better than they ever could be on their own. After ‘Vindication’ the fan interaction prompts Carrabba to admit he fell in love with the audience a bit and pleeds to extend sleep well. There is clear fan interaction and banter with the audience in a manner that shows real connection between the man and his fans.\n\nCarrabba comments on how loved and how special it is to be able to be on stage, it’s oddly difficult to hear someone gush about his feelings in such a manner outside of his songs – some times it seems almost too over the top to be real, yet there’s the belief that Chris Carrabba really is just this honest. Telling the audience that during ‘she pulled you in she bit your lip’ the song dragged him back into the moment he wrote it. And he even admits that many of the songs are about girls and when someone questions him on the life of a rockstar he questions the audience if they were doing his job would they have a few girls or a lot. It really feels like the audience are treated as friends rather than fans, he even suggests that we should visit his hometown.\n\nChris admits he’s going to play “enough songs to make your head spin” and deftly runs through most fan favourites and covers a Counting Crows song ‘Angels of the Silence.’ The audience is informed that he never intended to play this song, but that this guy was his hero and he wanted us to hear it. It’s a fantastic song that fits in so well with Dashboard’s repertoire. We’re also treated to new song ‘Get Me Right’; an interesting song which talks of feeling lost from religion and needing a maker, something which is previously an untouched subject in a sea of songs about women and relationships. However newer album ‘Poison Tree’ has started this diversity, including ‘Golddigger’ which Carrabba sings live and if ‘Get Me Right’ is an indication, the branching out will be found in the next album. Ending the set with ‘Hands Down’ he admits that he has no idea why it is this song has connected with so many people, but he’s glad it has. It really is a perfect way to end a wonderful show.\n\nDashboard Confessional’s music has always been heartbreakingly honest and seeing Chris Carrabba sing live with nothing more than his voice and a guitar, he appears to embody this. Occasionally his honestly seems so over the top a cynic would suggest its insincere, but the fans lap it up. He plays all the favourites fantastically well and the sing-a-long element just adds to the atmosphere of the show. Seeing Dashboard Confessional in such an intimate environment really is a treat."
