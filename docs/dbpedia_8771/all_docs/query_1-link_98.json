        "text": "Dashboard Confessional’s Chris Carrabba has announced a new album, the first one from Dashboard in 4 years, in All The Truth That I Can Tell, set for release February 25th. The album has been teased with a new video showing Carrabba, band mates and studio friends working on the new album. As the black and white footage rolls, Carrabba explains where the album title comes from, closing with “I was never meant to find all the truth I spent so long searching for. These songs are the truth that found me and it’s all the truth that I can tell.”\n\nTo go along with the album teaser video, Dashboard Confessional has also shared the first new song; Here’s To Moving On. “I think in this song I find myself understanding what brought me to the mat and what it takes to get up off the mat,” says Chris Carrabba. “Sometimes what brought you to the mat are outside forces and sometimes it’s you, yourself. Or it can be all those things. But it does seem the only thing that gets you up off the mat isn’t outside forces – it’s always you.”"
