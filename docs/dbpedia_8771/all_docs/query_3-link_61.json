        "text": "I never understood the lyrics in my youth of the 80s, but I did always hear the singer emphasize “that we could fix…”\n\nJust read the lyrics and still aren’t sure what it’s about– I liked The Fixx though, some good sounds…\n\nThe Fixx– \"Lose Face\"\n\nForbidden Image\n\nDo you care to think on\n\nOne trouble shooter\n\nThat we could fix on\n\nThis fevered globe\n\nWas always meant to be\n\nA home from home\n\nBut who's looking after…\n\nThe Professionals (Steve Jones & Paul Cook) - \"Join The Professionals\"\n\nAs a bonus 1 here's the movie version with Jones, Cook & Paul Simonon from the Clash as the Looters doing the same song with Ray Winstone as singer.\n\nBonus 2 is when the Fabulous Stains steal the song to the shock of the Looters. Paul Simonon never looked better. Diane Lane looked pretty good too. Jones has the best lines and delivery in the movie that made me love punk as a kid in the Michigan I loathed so much.\n\nThe England I moved to to be part of THAT is long gone, just a couple of scummy frauds with Mohawks over Camden Lock who will take a picture with tourists for a fiver."
