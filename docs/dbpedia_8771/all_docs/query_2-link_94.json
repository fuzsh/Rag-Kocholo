        "text": "PITTSBURGH -- Guitars hold the secrets to songs, says Chris Carrabba.\n\nLuckily for music fans, Carrabba knows how to unlock those secrets, for both his popular emo-rock band Dashboard Confessional and his lesser-known but highly satisfying folk/Americana group Twin Forks, which makes its Pittsburgh debut Thursday at The Club at Stage AE.\n\nTo publicize Twin Forks' sure-to-be foot-stomping show in Pittsburgh, Carrabba granted one of his characteristically freewheeling and fun phone interviews discussing, among other things, an inspirational experience he had in the backseat of a two-door Camry.\n\nCarrabba also shared the story of how last year he literally found the light in Pittsburgh.\n\nWe spoke a year ago, and I remember asking 'What's up with Twin Forks?' and 'When is Twin Forks going to play Pittsburgh?' Well, I'm glad you finally are.\n\nI have two bands on purpose, independent of the other.\n\nAnd there's a new Twin Forks album in the works. What can you tell us about that?\n\nIt's very story driven. A collection of vignettes almost. I'm starting to see now as I put the record together how broad the story is. I thought at first it was just little snapshots of different stories. There's more connective tissue than I thought. Sonically, it's got a lot of logical evolution from our first record.\n\nThe way things go, you write one record in isolation and nobody knows you're doing it. Then a few more people know you're doing it. I've struggled with this a bit. Do I gravitate to the songs that I think the people like live? Or that I like live, and that's why the people like live because that's what I decided to play in front of them? But it seems to be the record has really been shaped by our live performances. It's hard to articulate what a sound is. Or how a record has evolved. Or what to expect. I just know it feels like the best part of our live shows feel.\n\nYou mentioned your need to have two bands. Is there an overlap in the songwriting between Dashboard and Twin Forks? Is there a different inspiration or a different well that you pull from?\n\nThere's a different well. There's a different inspiration. There are occasional overlaps where my band members might say, 'You know you just wrote a Dashboard song.' Or vice versa. The other band might say, 'I think you just wrote a Twin Forks song here, buddy.' But for the most part that's a rare occurrence. I think I sit down and -- I know this sounds silly -- but which guitar I pick up (makes a difference). There's a specific Martin guitar I have that holds all the secrets to Twin Forks songs. And so if I pick it up, I must know what kind of mood I'm going to be in. They have songs hidden in them, these guitars. It's true and it's our job to find them. It's as simple as that.\n\nTalk about the tour. You're here in Pittsburgh playing the Club at Stage AE, a room that holds about 400. Is there any kind of mental adjustment for you, going from arenas to a cozy club like that?\n\nNaw, that's the best. A mental adjustment isn't necessary for that. It holds all the excitement in and of itself, the room. The size of the room. And also: Can we bring 400 people out? I hope so. It sure would be fun. I know which band is which. I know that we're a young band that hasn't done the kind of work that Dashboard has done. And we're at the beginning of our career, and maybe the beginning is taking longer because I have to split my time. But it still feels like the beginning. And if I'm totally frank with you, I think there's something special about small rooms. That's why I go back and do them with Dashboard, too. And then you carry that thing back to the arenas and amphitheaters -- and at this point I sound like a broken record because I've said that before -- but it is true. I've noticed this. I got hip to that real early. I never stayed too long from the clubs or theaters.\n\nYou played this particular venue in 2015 with Dashboard, joined by Third Eye Blind, and afterward you did a performance backstage for about 30 fans. What are those post-concert performances like for you?\n\nIt's extending the thrill ride is what it is. I would love to be one of those guys after the show who just can't wait to go out and see all the bars in town and talk to every girl they can and try to maximize the night and all that. Though the thing is, I've never found something. The highlight of my night has happened already, when I've gotten to play for people that I love. My thing is I like to explore the city before the show. Kind of carry out whatever exploration I get out with me onto the stage. And that's the pinnacle of the night. And so when I do those after-shows it's just a bit of extending. That's my version of hitting up the town.\n\nTwin Forks' music really suits you. One of the songs, \"Scraping Up The Pieces,\" has a Chuck Ragan (folk-punk) kind of thing going on.\n\nThat's a huge compliment. Chuck took me under his wing early on and taught me so much about music. He took my very first band out on shows. We stay in touch. (Ragan's punk band) Hot Water Music took out my first band, and Dashboard took out Hot Water, by then it had been a number of years. I remember writing the Twin Forks stuff and as it started to congeal realizing this is a band I'm doing here. This is a new band. I remember thinking, 'Wow, I bet we could play with Chuck.' And our first show actually was with Chuck.\n\nThe imagery in Twin Forks songs is something special. What's that line in \"Something We Just Know\" about being in the backseat of the two-door Camry with someone and, \"just one heart beating between us\"?\n\nThank you for that. You know I like that song, too.\n\nIs there a story behind that?\n\nI think the story behind that is pretty evident. (laughs).\n\nI guess I'm asking; Was it really a Camry?\n\n(With playful indignation) Yes, it was really a Camry. I think it was a Camry. Memory is a tricky thing, though, right? I mean ... there's been a number of girls, you know what I mean? It wasn't my car. That much I do know. That's why I have to think so hard. It was her car. I'm almost certain it was a two-door Camry.\n\nHow about your cover of Guy Clark's \"The Cape.\" Is that something that's popping up in your setlists? I heard it on your Twitter page.\n\nFunny you mentioned that, I was just telling (his publicist) \"Maybe we should do 'The Cape.'\" We have a lot of songs, a lot of covers recorded. \"The Cape\" is a special one to me. Guy Clark was a big influence. I'm a lyricist guy. And a melody guy. And he was just one of the kings of that. And what strikes me as so wonderful about \"The Cape\" is as a listener I heard it as a kid. The first time I heard that song was like sometime in the mid-'90s, and I was listening to a live performance where it was Steve Earle and Townes Van Zandt along with him. I remember thinking to myself these songs are affecting me right now. And then years later as a grown-up it struck me \"The Cape\" is meant to hit you at different points of your life and be an important song. And he talks about that pretty literally. \"All grown up\" is the beginning line of the second verse. So I love that song. I remember when I was recording it someone suggested \"Hey, you should consider changing the imagery in the part where the kid wraps a flour sack around his neck to look like a cape.' They suggested, \"Why don't you say 'towel' or something instead.\" But no, if he meant flour sack, then that's what he meant. That's what I'm going to say because this guy got it all right. I'm not getting into his way.\n\nYeah, be a purist on that.\n\nI think so. On the other end of it, when people cover my songs and take liberties I'm fine with that. I figure I wrote it the way I wanted. It's good enough for me. If you want to change it a little bit that's good enough for you. I'm fine with it.\n\nThat raises the question what are some of the covers of Dashboard songs you enjoy the most?\n\nI don't know. The obscure ones I like the best. You hear the bigger songs covered more often. Occasionally you stumble across something that's released as a rarity or perhaps never got as popular, and it's kind of touching. You realize maybe I wrote that one to appeal to a songwriter somewhere, which is pretty validating.\n\nAre you going to tuck any Dashboard songs into your Twin Forks set?\n\nWe never plan to, but I also never plan a set either. So I don't know.\n\nOn Twitter you also recently introduced your opening act, Social Animals. What can you tell us about them?\n\nWe've also got Dan Layus coming out with us, and we've been friends for ages. Social Animals came my way via three friends of mine -- two younger women enamored with their music, and a guy I work with who was thinking of working with them. And I began listening to them I started realizing OK I'm not just listening to it because my friends are listening to it, I'm waking up thinking, 'OK I have to hear the songs.' Dedric, the singer, was just here yesterday cutting a vocal in my basement. That's an important thing with Twin Forks, as with Dashboard, the friendships we make and sustain are among the most important reasons to be in a band. And to keep that going is imperative.\n\nYou always seem to have cool adventures in Pittsburgh, like the time you met a guitar store luthier, or the time you rode your bike along the North Shore. What did you do the last time you were here, and what do you hope to do this time?\n\nThat bike ride stuck with me. You know, I think about it all the time, it was such a beautiful, beautiful ride. And I did met this great luthier who showed me all this stuff, and you know I geek out on all that and also anybody who has serious pride in their job. I find that completely contagious. Especially if it's a craft.\n\nI remember before I went to that luthier, I swung by a bike shop and bought some stuff to fix my bike. They get beat up on the road. But one of the things I bought was just a light. I left without realizing I left it there on the counter after paying for it. No way to get in touch with the owner because I didn't remember the shop's name. I figured it was just a light, you know, wasn't meant to be, and then I hoped he'd just give it away to somebody. I remember showing up at the venue a year later, and there was a dude standing outside who said, 'Hey, Chris, I saw you were coming into town, here's your light.' A year later. And it wasn't like we had some big, giant conversation. He had asked me what I was in town for, and I said, \"Oh, I have a band Dashboard Confessional playing in town.\" He just remembered the band's name and saw that we were coming and brought the light over. That was fantastic. I loved it.\n\nAnything else you want people to know before coming out to the Pittsburgh show?\n\nI would say that we like to visit with everybody, so come and say \"Hi\" to all of us. We're nervous because it's been awhile since we played in front of people. It's amazing how when people just come up and say hello you get so much more comfortable to play to them. So help us out, and come say hi.\n\nIf You Go\n\nWhat: Twin Forks on concert\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Thursday\n\nWhere: The Club at Stage AE\n\nTickets: $18 in advance; $20 at the door\n\nInformation: promowestlive.com"
