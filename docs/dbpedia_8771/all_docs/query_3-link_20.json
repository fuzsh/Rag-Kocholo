        "text": "CHRIS: Well, I knew I had something special with Dashboard. I definitely knew it was something special. I didn't know it would become something popular. It did, and that surprised the hell out of me! I'd been in several bands before, one of the bands I was in as I started Dashboard was pretty successful (Further Seems Forever) in the indie world, and I thought that was like the pinnacle and I felt really satisfied with how far we'd gotten, and thinking maybe if that was as far as I ever got in a career in music I would've been happy with that. But Dashboard gave me something else, it was something that I had only done once before and that was when I was invited into this community of bands that I grew up around - it was a real inclusive kind of place and Dashboard just became less about the band and more about the community of us connected through these songs.\n\nCHRIS: Well there were a batch of us that were working together, we just played shows constantly together, we were building something that was unrelated to the music business, I guess, as we had no idea that we could be on labels or that we could have lengthy careers, but we did believe in each other, like Saves the Day and The Get Up Kids to name a couple. And some bands at the time made it further than us, some bands didn't make it as far as us, but we'd carved out our little corner of the music scene. And I think it was really based on...well, I really enjoy a good rockstar, you know? But there's often a definitive line of demarcation between the audience and the band. And...well, I'm not a rockstar, just a guy who writes songs and I wanted to connect with people not by being bigger than life but by choosing in every way to remain on the same plane as everyone else. And be approachable, be inviting - I wanted people to sing along, I wanted people to feel like it was fine to sing along, and I wanted the bands I played with to feel like we were in this together and I certainly was invited by bands much bigger than me to be a part of their thing. And all of this stuff that we did, none of it would've happened if any of us had been anything less than fearless, I think. Maybe the level to which we embraced this idea might constitute some foolishness I think, but then a surprising thing happened and that was that it word got out and around and people started to kind of believe in this idea that a band could be not just the people in the band and you're listening to it in isolation but maybe you could be a part of it in a bigger way than you might otherwise think you'd be able to.\n\nCHRIS: (laughs) I guess so! But if we were wrong...we would've definitely been fools (laughs). We were right, thank goodness, and thank goodness for our fans. I don't know very many other music scenes where the commonality between the bands is the relationship that they have with their audience. There's a lot of things that success can be based on and measured by, but the most obvious ones, the things that seem to be most broadly appealing to somebody who picks up a guitar for the first time or finds the cool leather jacket and imagines wearing it somewhere and being cooler than they are (laughs). I just figured, I was only gonna be as cool as I am, and that's it. So maybe I ought to just be me, you know?\n\nCHRIS: Well this time I'm most looking forward to the fact that I'm doing it with my bandmates, last time I was just solo. And I like that I'm lucky that I get to experience the variation between one and the next, that I get to experience the music just with an acoustic guitar and then other times to get the power of the whole band that also happen to believe in the songs as much as I do, which is unusual to some extent. That, and also reconnecting with our fan-base there. You know, you're not easy to get to from here (laughs). And if long gaps go on between when we've been there and when we get there I think people could mistakenly think that we don't care about that, and that is one of the reasons we've announced these shows so close to when we're playing. I was looking at the calendar saying \"if we don't go now, it'll be another year again before we can go\". I'm excited because of the response we've got from the audience there about us coming back, I'm really eager to start the trip!"
