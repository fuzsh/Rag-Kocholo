        "text": "Lead singer of Dashboard Confessional, Further Seems Forever and most recently Twin Forks, Chris Carrabba has established himself as a musician, singer and songwriter. Carrabba has gained a huge following and fan based over the years, beginning with the success of Dashboard Confessional.\n\nDashboard Confessional, Carrabba’s most successful and well known group began as a side project, “I started (Dashboard) as a side project from the band I was in. I was going through something really tough at the time and since I don’t write in a journal, this is what I did with it. It was a good way to get it out of my system. I never thought anyone would hear these songs, but I played some for my friends and one of them who owned a little label talked me into recording. The name Dashboard Confessional comes from the song “The Sharp Hint of New Tears” from the album The Swiss Army Romance. The lyric “On the way home this car hears my confessions” brought the bands name and Chris’ “Dashboard Confessional.” In 2002, he was asked to perform on MTV Unplugged, which launched the bands fame. Later that year, the music video for “Screaming Infidelities” won an MTV Video Music award.\n\nWith the release of A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar in 2003, the band’s success sky rocketed and that fall they toured with Brand New. Many of the songs from this album were used on the hit TV series One Tree Hill, which made “Hands Down” the most popular song off the album. The following summer, Spider- Man 2 was released with the bands hit “Vindicated.” The next 7 years, Dashboard Confessional released three albums, Dusk and Summer (2005), The Shade of Poison Trees (2007) and Alter the Ending (2009). In 2010, the band re-released The Swiss Army Romance on it’s 10th anniversary and announced a tour for the anniversary album (which I had the pleasure of attending).\n\nChris Carrabba’s most recent work is his new Americana/folk rock band Twin Forks, who just released their EP Twin Forks September 2013 and began touring in the beginning of October (which I also had the pleasure of seeing live). Twin Forks’ style of music greatly differs from Chris Carrabba’s previous work and is influenced by country, folk and roots music, with both male and female vocals, as well as many different instruments. The most popular song “Back to You” from the EP was featured on The CW’s show Reign. Within this year, the band released their full-length debut album in February."
