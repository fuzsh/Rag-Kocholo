        "text": "17. Alice Merton Previews New Album 'Mint'\n\n37:44| |Season 3, Ep. 17\n\nYou know \"No Roots\" but do you know what's coming next? The English-born, German-raised artist chats with host Chris Payne about the forthcoming jams on her debut album 'Mint' (due Jan. 2019). She also details the quick ascent of her debut single -- all good advice for up-and-coming artists looking to do the same.\n\n16. The Get Up Kids Talk Upcoming 2019 Album\n\n38:17| |Season 3, Ep. 16\n\nThe Get Up Kids' Matt Pryor and Jim Suptic chat about all sorts of things, most notably the new LP they're working on for Polyvinyl Records with Peter Katis. Also, plenty of behind-the-scenes reminiscing from the glory days of '90s emo. Here's a link to Jim's charity event we talked about: https://thundergong.org/\n\n15. Join Meg Myers On Her 'Spiritual Journey'\n\n32:53| |Season 3, Ep. 15\n\nIt took her almost a decade to get her debut album out, but soon after 2015's 'Sorry,' Meg Myers was dropped by Atlantic Records. The alt-rock artist explains how she found her artistic identity, a new label (300 Entertainment), and took control of her mental health. Her new album 'Take Me to the Disco' is out tomorrow (July 20)!\n\n14. nothing,nowhere.'s SoundCloud Rap & Emo Alchemy\n\n48:04| |Season 3, Ep. 14\n\nJoe Mulherin -- aka nothing,nowhere. -- makes striking, visceral music combining impassioned, emo-inspired vocals over trap beats and hazy guitars. We chat with him and his producer JayVee about working with Chris Carrabb and Travis Barker, battling anxiety and depression, being inspired by Juice WRLD, meeting a bear in the Vermont wilderness, and much more.\n\n12. Quizzing the Wonder Years on Their Oldest Set Lists (And More!)\n\n41:18| |Season 3, Ep. 12\n\nWe asked Dan Campbell and Matt Brasch to name the songs and other random details from Wonder Years shows in 2010, and their responses were kinda incredible. Also, hear us discuss the most emotional moments of their new album 'Sister Cities' and what lies ahead as the band members stare down real adulthood.\n\n12. You Thought You Knew James Bay?\n\n46:26| |Season 3, Ep. 12\n\nWe talked the talk with James Bay, delving into why he'll never make the same record twice, what it's like backstage at \"SNL,\" his love of Maroon 5's \"Songs About Jane,\" and the random guy who filmed in performing in a pub one night, and wound up getting him signed by Republic.\n\n11. Shinedown's Past, Present & Future\n\n42:54| |Season 3, Ep. 11\n\nIT'S ABOUT TO GET HEAVY. Frontman Brent Smith and bassist Eric Bass get deep and personal about Shinedown's new album, their insane streak of top-five radio hits, and what it means to be one of their era's most successful rock bands. They also dropped news about their future at Atlantic Records and upcoming albums.\n\n10. Underoath Loses Religion on Fiery Comeback Album\n\n44:55| |Season 3, Ep. 10\n\nVocalist Spencer Chamberlain and drummer-vocalist Aaron Gillespie were remarkably frank and open, discussing the Florida-based rock band's decision to regroup after a two-year hiatus, dropping its long held \"Christian\" label, getting over addictions and judgements, and crafting this year's excellent \"Erase Me\" -- their first LP since 2010."
