        "text": "Dashboard Confessional has set its first concert since Chris Carrabba was involved in a motorcycle accident over the summer.\n\nThe “Lonely Hearts & Lovers” live concert will stream virtually on Valentine’s Day and will feature a never-before-seen version of the band performing a 19-song set pulled from its catalog that was recently filmed inside Nashville’s Riverside Revival Church.\n\n“Nearly a year ago, our 20 year celebration came to a halt when everyone’s lives were changed by COVID. Then, I was in an accident that left me worried that I would never be able to play music again. I received so much kindness from people I know and people I don’t know,” Carrabba, 45, said in a statement.\n\n“The kindness that I received from friends, family, and total strangers was incredible. Over the last 20 years, you have given me so much, and I am just so grateful. I can’t explain what it felt like to get back in the room with my bandmates and play music again. This year has been hard for everyone and we all are missing each other more than ever. I know we can’t be together until it is safe for everyone to do so, but I miss hearing your voices, and seeing your faces. I’d be so pleased to see you…”\n\nTickets are $15 and will be available via the band’s website.\n\nAfter his accident, the “Vindicated” rocker said his injuries were “severe but not life threatening.”\n\n“I am determined to make a full recovery, but I have surgeries and months of rehab to come.”"
