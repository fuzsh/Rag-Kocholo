Born in West Hartford, Connecticut, Carraba was once the lead voice of rock bands such as Further Seems Forever and the Vacant Andys. Having received his first guitar from his uncle, Chris took only a mild interest in his musical talent preferring to skateboard. Until he recorded his first solo album (named \"The Swiss army romance\"), for the enjoyment of family and friends, but his work soon made the music circles resulting in its eventual release and Dashboard Confessional had been discovered. Chris combines heart felt lyrics with poetic wording and backs both with a warm acoustic sound from his guitar. With songs on the soundtrack for \"Spider-man2\" & \"Shrek2\", Chris is finding a new media for his work."
