        "text": "Dashboard Confessional is an American emo band from Boca Raton, Florida, led by singer-songwriter Chris Carrabba. The band was formed in 1999 as a side project of Carrabba's from his band Further Seems Forever.\n\n​\n\nDashboard Confessional's music is characterized by its emotionally intense lyrics and Carrabba's heartfelt delivery. The band's name comes from a lyric in their song \"The Sharp Hint of New Tears,\" which references driving and crying at the dashboard of a car.\n\n​\n\nThe band gained a substantial fan base with their debut album \"The Swiss Army Romance\" in 2000. Their second album, \"The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most\" in 2001, included their breakthrough single \"Screaming Infidelities,\" which won an MTV2 award.\n\n​\n\nOver the years, the band has released several successful albums, including \"A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar\" in 2003, which debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. In 2006, their album \"Dusk and Summer\" debuted at number one.\n\n​\n\nDashboard Confessional's music has evolved over time, with later albums incorporating full-band sound. Despite lineup changes, Carrabba has remained the constant driving force behind Dashboard Confessional's music and lyrics, making the band a significant figure in the emo music scene.\n\n​\n\nAfter a hiatus, Dashboard Confessional returned in 2018 with their album \"Crooked Shadows\", and in 2020, released their first-ever career-spanning compilation, \"The Best Ones of the Best Ones.\" Carrabba's earnest lyricism and emotive delivery continue to resonate with fans, securing Dashboard Confessional's place in the emo music genre."
