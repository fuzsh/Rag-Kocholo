        "text": "Chris Carrabba has been doing it since 1998.\n\nBelting out heart-wrenching ballads of pain, love and joy, that is. Making girls swoon with his boyish good looks. And last but not least, owning the stage. Take your pick, Dashboard Confessional knows how to put on a damn good show and they did just that last night.\n\nWith the release of their latest album, Alter The Ending, the Boca Raton natives are in the midst of a two-month international tour that brought them to the Bradley Center at Ramapo College in New Jersey last night. Dashboard Confessional was greeted by over 1,400 ecstatic fans, according to Ali, an 8th semester senior at Ramapo.\n\n“Dashboard played a few new songs from their new album, like Belle of the Boulevard, but still played lots of older classics,” said Ali. Like many college-age students, Ali has been a fan of Dashboard Confessional since early albums such as The Swiss Army Romance, The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most and A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar. Lead singer, Chris Carrabba, knows that although the band’s new music is great, the majority of Ramapo students came to see him cry the words to Screaming Infidelities.\n\n“Well As for now I’m gonna hear the saddest songs\n\nAnd sit alone and wonder\n\nHow you’re making out\n\nBut as for me, I wish that I was anywhere with anyone\n\nMaking out.” Screaming Infidelities.\n\nThe Original King of Emo, a.k.a. Chris Carrabba never holds back with expressing his deepest emotions in Dashboard’s song lyrics. Most of them about heartbreak and despair, but Carrabba’s middle name is Ender so he can’t help but love to paint his nails black. Alone. In the dark.\n\nThat last part was kind of a joke, Dashboard actually has a couple uplifting songs among many emo-gems.\n\nTo go along with his image of a wounded but determined soul, Carrabba never fails to dress to impress. Word on the street is that he’s a bit of a diva and demanded Starbucks and dry-cleaning from the Ramapo Concert Series staff. Move over Beyonce!\n\nDonned in a classy collared white button-down and black vest, Chris Carrabba rocked out with a great seat-list and great hair, as usual.\n\n“Dashboard’s energy was still as high as it always has been at their concerts. Things haven’t changed much, Carrabba’s hair is still goofy,” said Ali.\n\nAli and I saw Dashboard for the first time together in 2003 in New Jersey and many times since. Carrabba’s voice is one of those that must be experienced in person. Despite his petite 5 foot 5 inch frame, Carrabba is capable of producing some dynamic sounds. The band played crowd-favorites such as Thick As Thieves, Vindicated, Screaming Infidelities and closed with Hands Down at Ramapo last night.\n\nCarrabba is known for being a very interactive performer and talks to the audience a lot in between songs at shows. Last night, he revealed the inspiration behind song Thick As Thieves to fans, according to Ali.\n\n“The song is about his crazy ex-girlfriend who all of a sudden started stealing stuff,” said Ali.\n\nAccording to Carrabba, the klepto stole Snickers bars and then upgraded to MAC make-up and eventually cars. I guess Interscope Records isn’t paying Chris enough to buy his lady a new lipstick."
