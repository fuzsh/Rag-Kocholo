        "text": "I remember in high school I was sitting at lunch one day and a friend of mine, who shall remain nameless, sat down at the table looking very upset. We all ignored him for awhile until he finally spoke up. “Hey guys, do you ever go home after school and lock yourself in your room and listen to Dashboard and just cry?” We all waited a second for him to start laughing, hoping that he was joking, but by the look on his face we could tell that he wasn’t. This was my first venture into the world of “Emo.”\n\nStarting in the early 2000’s a giant whine was spreading across the country. Pop-punk mentalities were being mixed with the nasal voiced angst of the next generation. This movement came to be called “Emo,” and its face was one Chris Carrabba. Carrabba fronted the one man band named Dashboard Confessional. He sang songs with titles such as “Screaming Infidelities” and “Vindicated” with lyrics such as, “As for now I’m gonna hear the saddest songs, /and sit alone and wonder, how you’re making out. / and as for me I wish that I was anywhere, with anyone, making out.”\n\nDespite the sappy sentimentalism of the music, it took off. “Emo,” originally derived from a subgenre of the hardcore scene called “emotional hardcore,” seemed to be attracting hordes of disaffected youths much like the punk and Goth movements had earlier. However, like all subcultures, there was a backlash, and Carrabba and his band bore the brunt of it.\n\nNow, I am no emo defender, but Chris Carrabba and his cronies are more rock and roll then most of his critics will ever be.\n\nIn order to justify that statement, I must first give a working definition of what it means to be “rock and roll.” There are two bands that come to mind: The Rolling Stones and Guns and Roses. Not only was their music great, but the mythos of the band elevated their stature. The drinking, drugs and whoring somehow elevated these musicians to demigod status. However, I do not think this alone makes them “rock and roll.” That starts at the very beginning.\n\nWhat truly defines a band or artist as “rock and roll” stems directly from why they started playing music in the first place. Regardless of their reasons, if “to get laid” isn’t in their top two, than their rock and roll credibility takes a serious hit.\n\nHonestly, think about it. Most people start their bands in high school. After “we just love playing music and performing,” what other reason is there to dedicate hours of your day mastering chord progressions if not for the promise of copious amounts of vagina. No band makes a lot of money while they are still in high school, and economics teaches us that no one does anything for an extended period of time unless it maximizes utility. The utility of forming a band in high school is attention, and more specifically, the attention of females.\n\nCarrabba has mastered this better than anyone since Gene Simmons. I don’t honestly think that Simmons wants to parade around in black and white makeup with fireworks around him because he just loves the music. There is no excuse for a grown man to act that way unless he gets something out of it. Likewise, there is no reason for Carrabba to sing these over-the-top, emotional songs, and this is where Carrabba’s true genius shines.\n\nLike Gene Simmons, Carrabba has tapped into something generational. Simmons’ antics were seen as dangerous and tempting, and for whatever reason this has long been attractive to women. Likewise, Carrabba has tapped into the image of the sensitive, sweet guy that has become desirable in the last 15-20 years. By taking this generational ideal to its extreme level, Carrabba not only gets plenty of ladies, but he also reaches that demigod status I mentioned earlier.\n\nAdolescents, specifically early adolescents (12-15), seek out extremes. Everything in their lives is changing and chaotic so they lock on to things that are constant and homogenous. Every niche, whether it is Trekkies, jocks or those guys who play Dungeons and Dragons, initiates its newest members at these ages. Things like anime and music provide a pseudo-identity to those who are lost in the confusion of adolescence. This is how polarizing figures like Carrabba come to be.\n\nTo most, he is a self-important hack, but to his followers he represents everything they wish they could be. For all its “sticking it to the man,” rock stardom is really about being the coolest guy in the room. Jack White, Mick Jagger and David Bowie may cast themselves as outsiders, but that goes out the window anytime you have a crowd of 50,000 people yelling your name.\n\nCarrabba, like his predecessors, has managed to pull off being a popular outsider. While they may not admit it, I believe most teenagers wish they could do the same. Being popular in high school simply means that you are allowed to date the most attractive people. By being a popular outsider, like Carrabba, you would be able to date whoever you want without having to sacrifice some part of your identity. Not only would it be socially acceptable to be yourself, but you would be rewarded for it.\n\nEmo and its practitioners, like Carrabba, are simply another way for teenagers to identify themselves. Yes, the music is horrible and insidious, but its motivations are rock and roll. Sure, they probably love the music they make, but I guarantee they like getting laid even more."
