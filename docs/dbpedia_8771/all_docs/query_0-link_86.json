        "text": "Dashboard Confessional didn’t define a genre because of a television singing competition or millions of YouTube views.\n\nThe band’s rise to success and building a name that became synonymous with the rise of emo in the early 2000s came via basement shows and word of mouth.\n\n“This is a band that broke because every person that listened to it and liked it decided they needed to make somebody else like it,” singer, guitarist and songwriter Chris Carrabba said in a recent telephone interview.\n\nCarrabba started Dashboard Confessional as a solo acoustic side project to his plugged-in Florida rock band Further Seems Forever, and in 2000 released “The Swiss Army Romance.” With songs such as “Screaming Infidelities” and “The Sharp Hint of New Tears,” Carrabba delivered raw, heartfelt lyrics with his soft, pleasing tenor that crescendoed into imploring howls. With fans screaming along to every word, it became acceptable to have sleeves of tattoos and real feelings and even shed tears.\n\nStarting with 2001’s “The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most,” Dashboard Confessional began to evolve from Carrabba and an acoustic guitar into a full band. An “MTV Unplugged” special followed, and its accompanying album sold more than 1 million copies.\n\nBy the end of 2006, Dashboard Confessional had sold out Madison Square Garden in New York, audiences echoing every word along the way.\n\n“We’re a different breed, a unique breed. I’m proud of that, although I’d love to have a hit song. Anybody that ever wrote a song wishes they had a hit song,” Carrabba said. “You want to connect with as many people as possible. I’ve done it in a different kind of way that’s possibly, definitely rarer and definitely somehow I’m more in awe of – the fact that it’s their doing, ‘they’ being the audience.”\n\nBy the end of a full touring cycle in 2012 and a few international dates in 2013, the decade-plus of constant touring started to take a toll on the band.\n\n“What we go out there with, well, it’s honesty. And I think fatigue can rob you of honesty. We were fatigued and at the end of the last band tour we did, we all looked at each other and agreed that we needed a recharge,” Carrabba said.\n\nStepping away from Dashboard Confessional, Carrabba started up his Lumineers-esque folk band Twin Forks, which released its debut album in February 2014 – and has another on the way – but when punk-leaning event Riot Fest asked Dashboard Confessional to play its flagship Chicago festival last September, it was a litmus test for the future of the band.\n\nAfter that well-received set, Dashboard Confessional is back on the road, co-headlining a summer tour with Third Eye Blind that stops at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on today. The band heads back to Southern California on Oct. 3, for the reboot of the Taste of Chaos festival at San Manuel Amphitheater in Devore.\n\n“I don’t know what I was searching for with this tour. I didn’t know. I do know now: It was that I want to do this, forever,” Carrabba said.\n\nThe set has included songs from across the band’s catalog, with a new appreciation for how people consume music.\n\n“I think in the days when we were touring constantly, which is an understatement, it was about the record we had right then, plus the catalog. People listen to music differently now. They make their own records; they make their own playlists out of records they like,” he said.\n\nCarrabba said on the tour he’s realized that fans live with the music in a different way. Originally, the band’s fans listened to the albums in their entirety, but as the culture has changed, he has adapted to become reactive on the stage, throwing in a song if someone screams out a particular title.\n\n“Some nights yes, you go right back, it’s like a time machine. Other nights you can really understand why it resonates with that person or people in the crowd,” he said. “There’s always that zero-in factor that you have, or that I have anyway, that emotional undercurrent. I get swept up in it. It’s not mine, it’s theirs.”\n\nAnd for Carrabba, he still loves every bit of it.\n\n“I get to stand up there and sing and play guitar – which I love to sing and play guitar. I get to jump around like an idiot – I love to jump around like an idiot. I get to sing too loud. I get to scream. I get to sing soft and gentle,” he said. “I get to have this incredible, absolutely paramount experience with this audience that is devoted to the moment they’re in, which is not usual.”"
