        "text": "Interview with Chris Carrabba | By John B. Moore | Photos by Rebecca Reed\n\nChris Carrabba could easily sell out 1,000-plus seat venues on his name alone. As a founding member of Further Seems Forever and Dashboard Confessional, he has spent the past decade building up a legion of fans.\n\nBut when it came time for his latest project, the folk band Twin Forks, to hit the road he asked promoters not to mention his better-known bands. Nor did they want to mention drummer Ben Homola’s group Bad Books or Suzie Zeldin’s band The Narrative. The group is also rounded out by bassist Jonathan Clark.\n\nThe foursome wanted to succeed or fail simply on the merits of Twin Forks, even if that meant playing for a couple hundred people each night versus jumping up to the larger clubs. Based on the reception the just-released five-song EP has received, it’s definitely the former. Several years in the making, balancing schedules and forging new relationships, the band is moving ahead with plans for more tours and a full- length is already set for release at the beginning of the year with more music to follow.\n\nCarrabba, just days after injuring his hand while on the road and having to cancel a show in Denver, pulled over the van somewhere in Middle America to talk about the new group, learning how to play the guitar in a new way and going back to his earliest musical influences when they use the musical toys for toddlers their parents gave them.\n\ntwinforksmusic.com | www.facebook.com/TwinForksMusic\n\nI heard you had to cancel a show or two to recover. Has your hand had a chance to heal?\n\nYeah, we really don’t want to cancel any shows, but luckily it happened on a day off and we had a day off after the show we had to cancel, so we’re inching our way back.\n\nOk, let’s start off by talking about how Twin Forks came about. Your voice actually fits very nicely into this type of music.\n\nThank you. It’s not for lack of trying. My earliest influences are people like Paul Simon and Bob Dylan and some country singer songwriters that are essentially folk musicians like Townes Van Zandt. So I guess it came to me because I sort of worked backwards, from Further to Dashboard and to Twin Forks, with so much solo stuff in between. I worked through my influences backwards. In Dashboard I was trying to avoid the trappings of the music I grew up listening to, really out of respect. I was trying to do something that wasn’t a carbon copy of that… I finally realized it was time to embrace that, which means I had to go through the difficult process of learning things like the finger picking style of guitar playing which I had only dabbled in.\n\nHow did you go about learning the style? Was it a matter of taking lessons, watching videos online?\n\nI just sat and practiced it. There’s a great instructor who writes books and videos. I don’t do such a great job with videos. I am much more comfortable with books. This instructor’s name is Mark Hanson and I think I bought every book he’s every written and then I bought it again for anyone I know who plays guitar. It was a great way to break out of my writing style. I think it’s got to come from a unique place every time and after so many records from so many bands, you have to change the rules a bit… Once I figured out the style I wanted to play, it was about putting together the people that I thought would make it joyous. I wanted people that I thought were phenomenal musicians, but that didn’t know each other. I was sort of the links between these people.\n\nSo you were the connection between the other three?\n\nYes, and I was aware that not only were these stellar, stellar musicians, but that they also had this attitude that it’s about having fun. Despite being in so many bands and being as good as they are its still paramount to them that they have a blast. These are guys like me – and I use that term loosely as Suzie obviously is not a guy – who are completely enamored with writing, recording and playing like its always new. We spend so much time in my garage just discovering new things. They are not all from the same place. Jonathan and I live in South Florida, but I’m from Connecticut and he’s from South Carolina. Ben’s from the West Coast of Florida and Suzie’s from New York. So we all got together and as I suspected really hit it off well. We called our meeting place, the glorified garage where we recorded; we called the Twin Forks because it was in the center part of the lane… (Long pause) I just found an ominous lone cowboy boot on the side of the road.\n\nYou should pick it up; that’s got to be good luck.\n\nI’m a little afraid. What if there’s a foot in there. Then we’ve got a Fargo situation on our hands…. So that’s where we came up with our name. Initially we called ourselves Twin Falls, which are all over the country. But we were only Twin Falls for like three shows before we found out there was an active band called Twin Falls. So then it seemed natural to just name ourselves Twin Forks. We used to joke that we created our own little small town in that garage called Twin Forks. That’s kind of the way the band came together and the spirit of what we do together.\n\nYou obviously have had different experiences writing with different bands. Is it difficult when you first start playing together to get a sense of how everyone works?\n\nIt does sometimes take a while to pick up but at the beginning it’s always a blast, a riot. When it works, within minutes there’s a song that wasn’t there before. There’s a thematic direction that starts to take hold when the band works and it’s obviously not there when it doesn’t work. I guess I’ve been really lucky in the bands that I’ve been in, as it seems like all of them have been very fruitful right away and original in the way we honed our identities as a band.\n\nOne thing that surprised me the most about this EP is that it doesn’t sound like a band’s first release. It sounds like a group that’s been playing together for a while.\n\nThank you. That was the gamble. We really rolled the dice on that: if I put these people together than hopefully they will connect with each other the way I connect with them individually, both personally and musically.\n\nWas it difficult at all getting schedules to line up to both write and eventually record?\n\nYeah, especially between Ben and I, because of Bad Books and the hundred other bands Ben is in. I had Further and some other stuff. Suzie was a little more available because her band (The Narrative) was taking a break and Jonathan is a producer so he’s generally in the same place. We know where to find him. It wasn’t terribly difficult to get everybody together but it was a slower gestation period than some bands have because of me mostly. I haven’t been doing Dashboard very much in the States, but I did get an opportunity to tour Australia a couple years ago and that’s just when we were getting the project started and I had to leave for a few months and then I came back and did a Swiss Army Romance anniversary tour and that was another three months, then the Further record and we went out and supported it… Even though Dashboard is not active in terms of putting out new records, there still was a lot to do. But it also gave (Twin Forks) time to keep the music exciting. As soon as I got home I was champing at the bit to get to the garage and write a song that we could record.\n\nSo you guys are currently on tour, the EP is out. Have you thought about putting out more music with the group?\n\nYeah, so the beauty is we recorded many, many songs, including a full- length that comes out in January. As a record collector, I’m a lover of B-sides, so we recorded a lot of songs. My grandfather used to say to me, if I didn’t do well on a test, “the world needs ditch diggers.” It’s a very motivating thing, so that’s the way I look at songs; the world needs B-sides. We’ve got lots of those. We’ve got countless covers recorded. We’re at the point now where the record’s been out for three weeks, we played to a packed room the other day in Salt Lake City and are still mystified that people know who we are. We have the advantage of having been in previous bands, but we are asking the promoters to just bill it as Twin Forks, not Dashboard or Bad Books. We believe in it and think it will succeed, but it deserves to succeed or fail on the merit of what it is. We could just push the names of our other bands and instead of just playing to a few hundred people, be playing to a few thousand people, but that’s not what we want to do. We’re passionate about this.\n\nPurchase the Twin Forks EP on iTunes here:\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/ep/id690322737"
