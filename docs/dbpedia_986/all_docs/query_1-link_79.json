        "meta_description": "Though fairly few Irish folk songs deal with the Great Famine and while the authenticity of those that remain cannot always be guaranteed, they nonetheless constitute valuable contemporary sources on the Famine from the perspective of ordinary people. The insights they provide as to the way they reacted to government measures, hunger, evictions and emigration are a useful complement to scholarly histories which sometimes neglect the human dimension of the Famine.",

        "text": "‘Those in power write the history, those who suffer write the songs.’ Frank Harte (1933-2005), sleeve notes for 1798: the First Year of Liberty\n\nMíle bliain agus ocht de chéadta,\n\nDhá fhichead gan bhréig is sé ina cheann\n\nO’thuirling an Slanaitheoir i gcolainn daonna.\n\nGo dtáinig Iénscrios ar fhataí an domhain.\n\nSin é an dáta is ní fath gan ábhar.\n\nA mbeidh cuimhne is trácht air i gcaitheamh an tsaoil,\n\nMar níor tháinig uireasa dhá mhéad ar a cháilíocht\n\nIs mó na ganntan is easpa an bhídh\n\nOne thousand years first and these eight hundred,\n\nTwo score most truly and six besides,\n\nSince the Saviour took on him our human nature,\n\n’Till the potatoes through the world died;\n\n2 ‘Na Fataí Bána’ (‘The White Potatoes’), by Peatsaí Ó Callanáin, literary translation by Thomas CHAP (...)\n\nThat is the date and we’ll long remember,\n\nFor ’twill be talked of for many a day,\n\nFor no disaster before was heard of\n\nWhich took like that all our food away.\n\nA musical context\n\n3Ireland has had an exceptional musical reputation for centuries, and a refined instrument, the harp, has served as its national symbol since at least the thirteenth century. Even in the poorer classes, music was an important part of Irish everyday life, as evidenced by the accounts left to us by numerous witnesses, mostly from the eighteenth century onwards:\n\n4 Arthur YOUNG, Arthur Young’s Tour of Ireland (1776-1779), ed. A. W. Hutton, London: G. Bell & Sons, (...)\n\nAll the poor people, both men and women, learn to dance, and are exceedingly fond of the amusement. A ragged lad, without shoes or stockings, has been seen in a mud barn, leading up a girl in the same trim for a minuet: the love of dancing and musick are almost universal amongst them.\n\n5It was probably this highly ornamented style of singing that Frederick Douglass, the African-American slave turned abolitionist, heard when he toured Ireland for two months in 1845, later writing about it in his memoirs, and comparing them to his childhood memories:\n\n6 Frederick Douglass, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave: My Bondage, My (...)\n\nI have never heard any songs like those anywhere since I left slavery, except when in Ireland. There I heard the same wailing notes, and was much affected by them. It was during the famine of 1845-6 […]. Nowhere outside of dear old Ireland, in the days of want and famine, have I heard sounds so mournful.\n\n6The second and most popular type of folk singing today in Ireland, however, is a genre called ‘ballad singing’: it is a slightly later development which was extremely popular all over Europe and appeared in urban Ireland during the 17th century, probably under the influence of Scottish settlers, mostly in the northern part of the island. It is generally sung in English and tells a story on the classic themes of love, money, drinking, emigration, but also on more political themes:\n\n7 Gordon H. Gerould, The Ballad of Tradition [1932], New York: Galaxy Books, 1957, p. 3.\n\nThe ballad as it exists is not a ballad save when it is in oral circulation […]. Defined in the simplest terms, the ballad is a folk-song that tells a story. […] What we have come to call a ballad is always a narrative, is always sung to a rounded melody and is always learned from the lips of others rather than by reading.\n\n8Only a handful of folk songs can however be traced back to the demographic and cultural catastrophe brought about by the Great Famine, and it seems sensible to infer that the subject was generally avoided for decades among poorer people as it brought back too many sorrowful memories – who would like to be asked to sing a song about an event that decimated or drove to emigration 3 million people of your own country?\n\nSongs in the Irish language\n\n11It features ten verses, and is mostly an appeal to mercy from God: ‘A Dhia na Glóire fóir agus freagair sinn’ (‘O God of glory protect us and answer us’), initially substantiating the belief expressed by many that the famine was a divine intervention, as openly stated by C.E. Trevelyan, the assistant secretary to HM Treasury, and in effect the general administrator of relief programmes in Ireland during that period:\n\n12 Letter of Charles Trevelyan to Thomas Spring-Rice (Lord Mounteagle), 9 October 1846.\n\nI hope I am not guilty of irreverence in thinking that, this being altogether beyond the power of man, the cure has been applied by the direct stroke of an all-wise Providence […]. God grant that we may rightly perform our part, and not turn into a curse what was intended for a blessing.\n\n13But nowhere is this criticism more bitterly expressed than in ‘Johnny Seoighe’, a satirical song in the refined allusive poetic tradition of Ireland, which can only be fully understood if one hears the accompanying scéal, the story traditionally told by the singer before singing: on Christmas Eve, the author (probably Tomás Shiúnach from Carna, in Connemara) and his family walked all the way to the workhouse only to find they couldn’t be accepted there for lack of space. They then asked the famine relief officer, Johnny Joyce (Seoighe, in Irish), for help and food, which was denied, and his wife and children subsequently died on the way back home from hunger and exhaustion. One can hardly imagine the grief that led to those subtly sarcastic and angry lines:\n\nIs a Johnny Seoighe, tuig mo ghlórtha\n\n'S mé ag tíocht le dóchas faoi do dhéin\n\nMar is tú an Réalt Eolais is deise lóchrann\n\nAs mo shúil ag teampall Dé […]\n\nTá mé bruite dóite sciúrtha feannta\n\nLiobraithe gearrtha le neart den tsiúil\n\nGus a mhister Joyce tá an workhouse lán\n\nis ní ghlacfar ann isteach níos mó\n\nJohnny Joyce hear my voice\n\nI come to you full of hope\n\nAs you are the most beautiful Star of Knowledge\n\nA beacon in the temple of God […]\n\nI am burnt, battered and stripped\n\nSoaked and cut with so much walking.\n\nAnd Mister Joyce the workhouse is full\n\n14 Available on Trian’s eponymous first album (Flying Fish, 1992). It has also been included on a ‘Cel (...)\n\nAnd no one is taken in any more.\n\n18 George Petrie, The Ancient Music of Ireland, Vol. 1, Dublin: Society for the Preservation and Publi (...)\n\nThe green pastoral plains, the fruitful valleys, as well as the wild hillsides and the dreary bogs, has equally ceased to be animate with human life. The ‘land of song’ was no longer tuneful; or if a human sound met the traveller’s ear, it was only that of the feeble and despairing wail for the dead. This awful unwonted silence, which during the famine and subsequent years, almost everywhere prevailed, struck more fearfully on their imaginations, as many Irish gentlemen informed me, and gave them a deeper feeling of the desolation with which the country had been visited, than other circumstances which had forced itself upon their attention.\n\n16Gradually, Ireland’s countryside ceased to be a vibrant source of music and dancing, especially in the Irish-speaking areas, the Gaeltachtaí, the poorer parts of Ireland. A traditional song from County Kerry recalls the sudden changes in the atmosphere of the countryside:\n\nNí bheidh in Éirinn ach daoine aosta\n\nI mbun stoic ag aoireacht cois fallaí i ndrúcht;\n\nNí bheidh pósadh in aon bhall ná suim ina dhéanamh,\n\nAch ‘tabhair dom an spré’ agus ‘rghad anonn’.\n\n19 Quoted by Ó Gráda, Black ’47 and Beyond, op. cit., p. 226.\n\nOnly the elderly will remain in Ireland\n\nMinding livestock by the walls in the dew;\n\nThere will be no marriages, nor interest in them,\n\nBut ‘give me the dowry’ and ‘I’ll head off’\n\nSongs in the English language\n\n20While Irish folk songs tended to reflect on events supposedly known by all in the community, ballads in English were more inclined to describe a similar event chronologically and systematically. The trend was not completely new, however, especially in urban centres like Dublin or Cork, where the ballads in English coming from London had slowly grown in popularity since the 17th century.\n\n21Used by Theobald Wolf Tone and the United Irishmen at the end of the 18th century, street ballads grew further in popularity after the Napoleonic wars (1803-1815) and, in Ireland, thanks to early nationalist militants seeking to advance their claims of independence. Charles Gavan Duffy, founder and editor of the newspaper The Nation, in particular, asked his readers to compose new ballads in the political vein between 1842 and 1845. Among the 800 new songs that were printed in the newspaper, some of them (‘A Nation Once Again’, ‘The West’s Awake’, …) can still be heard today in certain circles. They should however be considered as representative of the views of the urban nationalist political elite rather than the expression of the people, and often convey what has been termed ‘social distance’:\n\n23 Desmond KENNY, ‘The Ballads of The Nation’, Cahiers du Centre d’Etudes Irlandaises, N° 3, Rennes: P (...)\n\nmany of the Ballads [of The Nation] are in the imperative, such as ‘Bide your Time’ and ‘Be Patient’, or a ballad would have a moral to it, such as ‘Aid Yourself and God will Aid You’. Here, The Nation is talking down to, rather than singing with the people, and we are conscious of its implicit feeling of superiority.\n\n22The mid-19th century understandably witnessed a genre mixing both the Irish and English languages, referred to as ‘macaronic’ songs, where English generally prevails over Irish Gaelic, which was sometimes used in a veiled and subversive way, and more recently as a sprinkling of ‘Irishness’ in parlour songs.\n\n25 ‘The Shamrock Shore’, available on the album Molloy Brady Peoples, Mulligan, 1978.\n\nAll by those cursed tyrants we are forced for to obey\n\nSome haughty landlords for to please\n\nOur houses and our lands they’ll seize\n\nTo put fifty farms into one and take us all away\n\nRegardless of the widow’s cries\n\nThe mother’s tears and the orphan’s sighs\n\n24Probably the most famous eviction song, however, is ‘Lough Sheelin’ (or ‘Lough Sheelin Side’), named after the lake bordering the counties of Cavan, Meath and Westmeath. It recounts the mass eviction of small cottiers and their families in Tonagh, Co. Meath, a hundred kilometres north-west of Dublin. Differing versions of this anonymous song abound today, but all describe how 700 people were thrown out of their houses on a cold day:\n\n26 Available on the charity album CD Araglen Album, sung by Con G. Leddy, 2002. And online <youtu.be/NuvAZfluKF8> [retrieved</youtu> (...)\n\nBut our good dreams were too good to last\n\nThe landlord came our home to blast\n\nAnd he no mercy on us did show\n\nAs he turned us out in the blinding snow\n\nNo one dare open for us their door\n\nOr else his vengeance would reach them sure;\n\nMy Eileen fainted in my arms and died\n\nAs the snow lay deep on the mountainside.\n\n25Strikingly, this is more than likely the very eviction that was witnessed by a young priest who, years later, as Bishop Thomas Nulty, described in a long pastoral letter to the clergy of his diocese of Meath the consequences of the landlords’ desire to reorganise the use of their land:\n\n27 Pastoral letter dated 20th February, 1871, by Dr. Thomas Nulty, Bishop of Meath, Report from the Se (...)\n\nSeven hundred human beings were driven from their homes in one day and set adrift on the world, to gratify the caprice of one who, before God and man, probably deserved less consideration than the last and least of them. […] The horrid scenes I then witnessed, I must remember all my life long. The wailing of women – the screams, the terror, the consternation of children – the speechless agony of honest industrious men – wrung tears of grief from all who saw them. I saw officers and men of a large police force, who were obliged to attend on the occasion, cry like children at beholding the cruel sufferings of the very people whom they would be obliged to butcher had they offered the least resistance. The landed proprietors in a circle all around – and for many miles in every direction – warned their tenantry, with threats of their direct vengeance, against the humanity of extending to any of them the hospitality of a single night’s shelter. […] and in little more than three years, nearly a fourth of them lay quietly in their graves.\n\n26Indeed, many small farmers, evicted from their plot of land, denied visible help by their neighbours, and unable to pay for a passage to England or America, died of hunger or, even more often, of scurvy, typhus or relapsing fever.\n\n29 Available on Joe Heaney’s album Road from Connemara, 2000.\n\nMy father died, I closed his eyes outside our cabin door;\n\nThe landlord and the sheriff too were there the day before.\n\nAnd then my loving mother, and sisters three also,\n\nWere forced to go with broken hearts from the Glen of Aherlow.\n\nEmigration\n\n31 See Séamus HEANEY, ‘The Sense of Place’, p. 132 in Preoccupations, Selected Prose, 1968-1978, Londo (...)\n\nIt is this feeling, assenting, equable marriage between the geographical country and the country of the mind, whether that country of the mind takes its tone unconsciously from a shared oral inherited culture, or from a consciously savoured literary culture, or from both, it is this marriage that constitutes the sense of place in its richest possible manifestation.\n\n33 Lord Stanley, Compensation to Tenants (Ireland) Bill, House of Lords debate, June 9th 1845, Hansard(...)\n\nif there be anything like compulsion in the emigration, it becomes an act of tyranny and oppression; and, under the most favourable circumstances, the warm attachment of the Irish peasant to the locality in which he was born and brought up will always make the best and most carefully conducted system of emigration, a matter of painful sacrifice on the part of the emigrant, involving to a large and painful extent his personal and domestic feelings.\n\n35 Available on Déanta’s album Whisper of a Secret, 1997. The song was written by Thomas Madigan (1797 (...)\n\nSad, sad is my fate in this weary exile\n\nDark, dark is the night cloud o’er lone Shanakyle\n\nWhere the murdered sleep silently pile upon pile\n\nIn the coffinless graves of poor Éireann\n\n31If you ask any Irish person today what the most famous Famine song is, it is very likely you will hear the name of a small town in Co. Cork: Skibbereen. Between 1845 and 1850, 9,000 men, women and children were buried in the nearby common graveyard at Abbeystrewery during the Great Famine. The song was probably written by Patrick Carpenter, and is a bitter and vengeful reminder of those days in the form of a discussion between a son and his father:\n\nFather, dear, I often hear you speak of Erin’s Isle.\n\nIt seems so bright and beautiful, so rich and rare the soil.\n\nYou say it is a bounteous land wherein a prince might dwell.\n\nThen why did you abandon it? The reason to me tell. […]\n\nIt’s well I do remember the year of forty-eight,\n\nWhen we arose with Erin’s boys to fight against our fate;\n\nI was hunted through the mountains as a traitor to the Queen,\n\nAnd that’s another reason that I left Old Skibbereen.\n\n33Starting from the period of the Great Famine, departures were generally celebrated during an evening of praying, music, story telling and dancing, called the ‘American wake’. Leaving the country was generally regarded on a par with death, as very few exiles ever returned home:\n\n37 ‘Thousands are Sailing’, available on Déanta’s first album, op. cit.\n\nThe night before leaving they are bidding goodbye\n\nAnd it’s early next morning their heart gives a sigh\n\nThey do kiss their mothers and then they do say\n\nFare thee well, dearest father, we must now go away\n\nTheir friends and relations, their neighbours also\n\nWhen the trunks they are packed up all ready to go\n\nThe tears from their eyes they fall down like the rain\n\nAnd the horses are prancing going off for the train.\n\n34The following extract by English sociologist and novelist Harriet Martineau confirms the poignancy of such scenes, as witnessed in Castlebar, Co. Mayo in 1852, where the keening for the departed took place:\n\n38 Harriet Martineau, Letters from Ireland, London: John Chapman, 1852, p. 140.\n\nAll eyes were fixed on the neighbours who were going away for ever. The last embraces were terrible to see; but worse were the kissings and the claspings of the hands during the long minutes that remained after the woman and children had taken their seats. [...] there it was, the pain and the passion: and the shrill united cry, when the car moved on, rings in our ears, and long will ring when we hear of emigration.\n\n35The dangers of the crossing on the cheap ‘coffin ships’ are also vividly documented in many songs, as in the following extracts, where typhus is illustrated:\n\n39 ‘Erin’s Lovely Home’, available on Karan Casey’s album Ships in the Forest, 2008.\n\nWe were scarcely seven days at sea when the fever, it plagued our crew\n\nThey were falling like the autumn leaves bidding friends and life adieu\n\nNow the raging waves sweep o’er their graves amidst the ocean foam\n\nTheir friends may mourn, but they'll never return to Erin’s lovely home\n\nMy loving sisters, they both took ill, their lives, they were taken away\n\nAnd oh it grieved my heart full sore to cast them in the sea\n\nDown in the deep now they do sleep, they never more will roam\n\nIn heaven I’ll meet with my sisters sweet from Erin’s lovely home\n\nConclusion\n\n41If many of the poignant songs mentioned in this study are rarely sung or heard in unfamiliar settings, one should probably blame the sadness associated with the memories, the implication of local names in many personal stories, and the weight of the Roman Catholic Church. In turn, this amputation of a common memorial legacy led to the feeling that the Irish peasantry had been robbed of its last possessions: the sense of belonging, leading to the worst of sanctions – exile. In oral tradition however, the popular aphorism still remembers that ‘even the birds were silent with grief’ during the Great Famine."
