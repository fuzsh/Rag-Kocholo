It is sufficiently full, however, to warrant publication, and has been prepared with the same care as if it were the final word in our alumni history to date. The shortcomings of this volume will be healed by the next, and to that end this will be of particular service by indicating the goal sought, and by defining in terms of actual example the sort of data needed, thus making it possible for those so inclined to co-operate with us in carrying this work to its finale. In addition, it is the most significant contribution, thus far, to the task of gathering up and focussing the strength which springs from the power and love and devotion of 11,000 living alumni. Now attention will move and rivet itself upon the larger aspects of the work of the General Alumni Association.\n\nSeveral days are yet to elapse before the first two years of the Central Alumni Office come to an end. At the beginning of that time we had a class-room table and a typewriter; we had access to a card roster in the University Registrar's office which purported to be no more than a list of names of all matriculates from 1795 to date (with the complete collegiate record for the period subsequent to 1912). For those who entered previous to 1912 the degrees were entered on those limited records, but no effort had been made to include the complete term of attendance of matriculates--merely the date of admission. We also had available the Philanthropic and Dialectic Literary Society rosters of the early days, together with the catalogue published in 1889, compiled largely by Mrs. Cornelia Spencer, LL.D. This catalogue was subsequently (about 1900) checked and enlarged by James C. Taylor. Since the date of Mr. Taylor's work nothing of record has been preserved in Chapel Hill that could be of service to us in setting up the Central Alumni Office and editing this Alumni History, save the notes that have appeared from time to time under necrology in The Alumni Review. Hundreds of alumni listed as alive had died; and the mail addresses of more than 6,000 of the living were unknown.\n\nWe wish this recitation of facts to render no one an injustice. But just credit and appreciation can be accorded those who have\n\nPage viii\n\nlabored so valiantly in the University's service without allowing to continue the false idea that the building of an alumni office and the compilation of essential University data have been going on systematically over many years. This false idea has been abroad among our alumni and has been the one thing which has throttled our efforts. We, of course, were ignoring what men believed to be true, with the consequent result that our appeals were frequently considered unfair, unnecessary, and in some instances, even insincere. The atmosphere in this connection I feel can now be cleared with fairness to all by the propulsion of this single question: When did the alumni provide the office and the money for the execution of this task?\n\nThis volume we now offer then has no exact predecessor in the one hundred and thirty years of University history, although marked second edition. The work published in 1889 is a precursor, for in that very year resolutions were passed by assembled alumni calling for the preparation, publication and distribution of a complete alumni history. Similar resolutions have appeared with monotonous regularity since that time. Indeed, the work of Mr. Taylor was attempted in consequence of this oft repeated desire, but unfortunately was not carried to completion.\n\nAs already stated, this history is offered without apology although with the frank intent to publish again in four or five years, or at such time as the idea of an alumni history as here indicated, can be carried to successful execution. Roughly, seventy-five per cent of the material given here has been collected, and all of it compiled in less than two years, although we have had the concurrent task of building up an office and equipment. The data regarding the living men has come from approximately 7,000 different sources. A large portion of the data on the deceased ones (prior to 1900) had been previously secured and chronicled by Mr. Taylor. The additions we have made to information regarding the deceased have come from approximately 1,000 sources.\n\nWe have endeavored at all times to be fair and just to the 15,000 different individuals. It isn't a single running story, with a single responsibility, but the glamor and pathos of 15,000 individual lives--from the position of the Highest to the lowliest in our land--all out on dress parade. Every precaution has been taken to guarantee factual exactness at an expense of time and energy scarcely conceivable to one inexperienced in this particular character of work. We have consistently minimized the amount of data given when the possibility of error, by inclusion, appeared.\n\nPage ix\n\nTo have done otherwise would have violated the motive which has controlled us in the production of the work, for we want it to be more than the recitation of individual successes and failures to grace or shame us, more than a book to be pushed into the most unused corner of a bookshelf to be lost sight of for the present and reclaimed only to become an heirloom. We want it to help bind into a conscious whole the component parts of that entity--the University of North Carolina. And that entity is not alone in Chapel Hill, as some of us are wont to think; it is not alone in the days of one's student life which the rosy mists of memory have enshrouded in romance and glory; neither is it alone in the past, nor will it be alone in the future. It is not alone the great men who have been its students; the indifferent and the weak are its own in their peculiar way. It is all the men it has sent forth whose lives have been broadened, deepened, and sweetened by her instruction, inspiration and conception of broad purpose. And it has a future to be shapened, in part, at least!\n\nThis book should help us to see more clearly our relationship to the institution, and the institution's relationship to the Commonwealth which gave it birth, has nourished it, and now, after a century and a half of trial, is more deeply committed to the program of public education than to any other single endeavor,--a commitment of so long standing and so oft demonstrated wisdom that it has risen to full stature, becoming a devotion. The University was conceived by this Commonwealth for the preservation and development of a democratically organized society, and those of us who are living and doing today are little worthy of the heritage which is ours unless the University of North Carolina be ever kept true to the conception which founded it, and adequate to the demands of a growing civilization.\n\nThe field for constructive service is open. Never was the need for enlightened, responsible citizenry more urgent than at this hour of the world's history. With a red horizon stretched across wide and needy lands where efforts at a democratic organization of society out-distanced the wisdom and responsibility of their average man; with the diversity in our own American life becoming ever more accentuated on account of our varying natural conditions and the developments of the last half century the need for fulfilling the dream of our fathers--of finding public security in an educated citizenry--becomes the more urgent.\n\nAnd when all of us are thoroughly cognizant of the heritage which is ours as Carolina men, and are conscious of our responsible connection with the University, it shall be the purpose of the General\n\nPage x\n\nAlumni Association to keep in each of its members an ever quickened interest in the opportunities which are ours, as a group, because of common ties, and attachments.\n\nWe conceive this History to be a vital step in the work of building this dynamic group consciousness among University of North Carolina alumni so that together we may the more effectively \"consult the security of the future.\" The institution has a record of which we are justly proud, but our love is equally commiseration for the handicaps under which it has labored, as it is devotion to the contribution in men and thought which it has made. Today as a body of strong men, able to do, we must acknowledge, when we stand four-square to all the winds that blow, that alma mater has been nourished at times upon crumbs from the Master's table when it should have been fed upon nectar from the lap of the Gods. The challenge of our future as an organized body of alumni is what increased contribution can we make to the strength and security of the future of America through the wisest development and use of the University of North Carolina?\n\nDANIEL LINDSEY GRANT, Editor.\n\nAugust, 1924.\n\nPage xi\n\nAppreciation\n\nA large number of people have made substantial contributions to this work. Even though the roll cannot be called here and an exact allotment of credit made, I wish to thank all of them, even impersonally, and acknowledge our debt to them.\n\nAn acknowledgement is made elsewhere of large credit due James C. Taylor, of Morganton. There should be added the names of Walter Murphy, '92, and Edgar Ralph Rankin, '13.\n\nParticular attention should be drawn to the work of C. Percy Powell, '21, who has been general assistant in the Central Alumni Office, and has devotedly given himself to the preparation of the work.\n\nPage xiii\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAlphabetical Roster of all matriculates, carrying individual histories 1\n\nSupplement to Alphabetical Roster, carrying material added while main section was in process of preparation . . . . . 705\n\nRoster of Student Body of 1923-1924, excluding those who won degrees at Commencement of 1924 . . . . . 709\n\nRoster of Students' Army Training Corps, University unit, fall of 1918 . . . . . 740\n\nRoster of those receiving honorary degrees from the University, 1799-1924 . . . . . 748\n\nRoster showing geographical distribution of living alumni . . . 755\n\nClass rosters from the time of the re-opening of the University in 1875 . . . . . 853\n\nPresent University Organization and Faculty . . . . . 933\n\nRoster of University Trustees--with terms of office . . . . . 938\n\nPage xv\n\nBasis of Editing This Volume\n\nClarity, conciseness, and completeness have been the dominant considerations in establishing the type, size and page arrangement of the data; and also in editing the material for this arrangement. It has been necessary to get a large amount of information into very small space without limiting the range of the data included. This necessitated the context with small type; and facility in reading matter thus printed required the use of the minimum number of capital letters.\n\nIt has been our purpose to include (a) the full name; (b) the current address (indicating also the permanent address if the present address is temporary); (c) the complete college record with degrees; (d) date and place of birth; (e) names of parents; (f) the name of wife (or husband) and place and date of marriage, if married; (g) the outstanding achievements during undergraduate days; (h) a complete chronological statement of the career including professional, business or civil activities, military service, writings, etc.; (i) affiliations with fraternal, civic and religious organizations.\n\nWhen no state is given, North Carolina is understood unless clearly indicated otherwise by the context. The portion of the academic career which pertains to the University of North Carolina is given without the mention of the institution's name; degrees received, as years spent at other institutions are given along with the name of such institution.\n\nIn the case of the alumni of the earlier days whose places of residence were numerous and widely scattered, the effort has been to give the place of origin and the last established place of residence. It is hoped that this will give us a wide source for reference when this work is published, in order to obtain additional data needed.\n\nExplanation\n\nA star (*) preceding name indicates that the party is dead, even though the date of decease is not stated.\n\nA single dagger (â€ ) indicates alumni with whom we have established no contact during the two years of duration of this office. Such parties may, or may not be dead.\n\nA double dagger (â€¡) indicates those with whom we have established mail contact during the past two years, but whose mail now fails of delivery at the address given.\n\nIn such instances we are assuming that first-class mail which is not returned to us is delivered, and we are assuming also that first-class mail which is returned to us has been addressed improperly. This basis is not absolute because we have established, in our own experience, wide discrepancies in postal service, but is the only basis on which we could give the information for the catalogue.\n\nThe abbreviations used are as follows:\n\nacad.--academy\n\nadj.--adjutant\n\nadv.--advertiser\n\nadv.--advertising\n\nadv.--advertisement\n\nagri.--agriculture\n\nAm.--American\n\nA.
