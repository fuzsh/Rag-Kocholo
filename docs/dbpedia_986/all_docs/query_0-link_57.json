In railway circles everywhere the publication of the technical results of the tests made in 1913 of brake performances on modern steam railroad passenger trains carried out by the Pennsylvania R R . and the Westinghouse Air Brake Co. will be marked as an event of the utmost importance in the progress of the art of train control. Many years have passed since trials have been carried out on such an elaborate scale. They are the formal scientific exposition of the stage reached in the combination of pneumatic power and electricity, and probably will be regarded with the same classic authority as that which at­ taches to the Galton-Westinghouse brake trials made on the London Brighton & South Coast R y. in England during 1878, thirty-six years ago. Those trials constituted the first scientific investigation of the action of brake shoes in retarding the motion of railway vehicles, though considerable knowledge had been obtained by earlier trials of continuous brakes such as those made on the Midland R y. near Newark in England in 1875. In that year the best brake performance recorded was by a train of fifteen four-wheeled carriages averaging a weight of 21,000 lbs. apiece, fitted with a primitive form of the Westinghouse automatic brake, which was brought to a standstill in eighteen seconds from a speed of 52 miles per hour. In the test three years later the experimental van, weighing 18,200 lbs., and fitted with two brake shoes per wheel, was stopped from the same speed in eleven and a half seconds. No. 2540. The present tests have proved that the improved air brake apparatus, operating pneumatically, short­ ens the time of obtaining maximum emergency brake cylinder pressure on the train on the whole from 8 seconds with the present standard apparatus to 3.5 seconds, and with electric control in combination, this is again shortened to 2.25 seconds. Under the quicker and more powerful pneumatic emergency application, the stop at sixty miles \"per hour has been shortened from over 1,600 feet to about 1,400 feet, and the simultaneous action of the electro-pneumatic brake has still further shortened the stop to less than 1,200 feet. Moreover, the simultaneous application of the most powerful re­ tarding forces by the electro-pneumatic brake has entirely eliminated violent slack action at all speeds. Last year’s tests were immediately the outcome of the resolutions adopted at a meeting of railway officials and the Master Car-Builders’ Committee on Train Brake and Signal Equipment held at Pitts­ burgh in 1909. Emergency Brake Tests carried on shortly before by the Lake Shore & Michigan South­ ern Ry. near Toledo had shown that the construc­ tion and use of modern heavy rolling stock was out­ running the proportionate increased braking power. It was resolved, therefore, that the air brakes pro­ vided for the heavier passenger cars then building should be of such design, proportion and capacity as to enable trains of the heaviest passenger cars in use to be stopped in practically the same distance after the application of the brakes as was then the case with the existing lighter cars. It was further recom­ mended that brake constructors and railway en­ gineers should design the brakes to accord with the theoretically desirable stop in a space of 1,200 feet after the application of the brakes from a speed of sixty miles per hour. Summed up, the test of 1913 demonstrated con­ clusively that a train of twelve steel passenger cars and modern locomotive, weighing nearly 1,000 tons, and about 1,000 feet long, running at a speed of sixty miles per hour, can be stopped by an emergency application in its own length. This is more than the suggested rule calls for, and leaves a satisfactory margin of reserve power. Such a result was believed to have been obtained by the constructors of the present Westinghouse brake in its improved form as developed from the original invention of Mr. George Westinghouse, but positive proof had not been possible until given by these tests. The electro­ pneumatic brake is about fifteen years old, but in its present perfected design for commercial equipment of high-speed steam and electric passenger trains has been in operation hardly more than fifteen RAILWAY AND INDUSTRIAL SECTION. 4 months. The recent tests made by the Pennsyl­ vania R R . with trains fitted with the standard air­ brake equipment without electric control and with the improved air-brake equipment electro-pneumatic type, carried out at Absecon, N. J., coupled with the laboratory experiments and tests of brake shoes by the American Brake Shoe & Foundry Co. at Mali wall, N. J., are described in the paper presented by Mr. S. W. Dudley, assistant chief engineer of the Westinghouse Air Brake Co. before the American Society of Mechanical Engineers at its New York February meeting. This paper and its predecessor, that on the air brake as related to progress in loco­ motion, presented at the Franklin Institute, Phila­ delphia, N ov. 1910, give a comprehensive technical and general account of the development of the quick-action high-speed automatic brake from its original to its most recent form. The tests, constituting a scientific study of the brake as a whole, besides affording definite knowledge for general practice in application of the brake in ordinary service and in emergency, furnished import­ ant new data upon the action of the apparatus under certain specific conditions. Much more is now known, in consequence, of the laws which govern the maximum brake cylinder force, the efficiency of the brake rigging, brake-shoe friction, and the effects of temperature in the relation of brake shoe to wheel and of wheel to rail. In regard to the lastnamed point it was found that the available rail ad­ hesion— which is the fundamental factor to be con­ sidered in the use of the brake— varies through wide limits, namely-from 15% in the case of a frosty rail early in the morning to 30% for a clean, dry rail at mid-day. Wheel-sliding, again, it was ascer­ tained, depends more on the rail and weather con­ ditions than on the per cent breaking power. The Absecon tests last year, numbering 691 in all, 160 observations being taken , on each regular test, were carried out between Feb. 10 and May 22. The train used was 1,040 feet long and made up of a Pacific type locomotive and tender weighing about 200 tons and twelve steel passenger cars of about 61 tons each. The tests were made on a straight piece of line of the Atlantic City Division of the West Jersey & Sea Shore H R., 25 miles long, terminating at Absecon station. On the measured test track for a distance of 5,000 feet south of the zero point and for some distance preceding, circuit breakers were placed connected with clock and chronograph in a cabin so as to record the speed of the train before and during the stop. Special in­ struments had been devised for taking records of the friction of the rail, wheel-sliding, retardation of the train, and slack action between cars, as well as for a number of minor observations. Telephones placed at intervals on five of the cars made it easy to give and receive instructions and reports. The organiza­ tion staff consisted of forty-four observers of experi­ enced officials and employees of the Westinghouse Air Brake Co. and the Pennsylvania under the direc­ tion of M r. C. D . Young, engineer of tests, Pennsyl­ vania R R ., in consultation with Mr. S. W . Dudley and Mr. P. H. Donovan, Westinghouse engineers. ECONOMIC TRACK IMPROVEMENT ON TRUNK RAILROADS. It is becoming more and more evident that the steam railroads in order to increase their net earn­ ings must depend on the results of their operation obtained from greater efficiency and economy, using the latter term in its broad sense. Neither present conditions nor the immediate prospect favor count­ ing upon the execution of ambitious schemes which [V O L . X C V 4 I I. may, or may not, in the long run bring adequate returns for the outlay of new capital, and yet must in the mean time cause severe additional burdens in the shape of fixed charges. Whether treasuries can be refilled by increases in rates, even if the ap­ plications now before the Inter-State Commerce Commission be granted as reasonable and as a matter of common justice to the carriers for work performed, is problematical. Realization of this by railroad managers accounts in great measure for the fact that there has been no extraordinary development in large railway engineering works during.the past year. Nevertheless, there has been much steady progress made in economic track improvement work calculated to give the public better service at less cost by quickening the movement of freight at trans­ fer and terminal points. Nature was unkind last March in retarding and delaying efforts in this direction, but the floods and other physical disas­ ters which dislocated traffic by washouts and called for immediate repairs at great expense, pointed the moral, and suggested practical ways of relocating and grading the permanent way. Improvement of terminal and transfer facilities, especially in regard to the handling and distribution of freight, is, without doubt, the crying need of the American railroads to-day. Its importance is far from being understood by the public. Still less are appreciated the difficulties attendant upon the adaptation of freight yards in crowded centres of urban life. Strategical ability of a high order is required from the chief engineers of the train lines seeking in conjunction with superintendents and traffic managers to reduce and avoid congestion in the terminals of the great cities of the United States. Fortunately, the American railway field offers a splendid training ground for their officers in princi­ ples of long-range operation. The saving an hour or two in the making up of freight trains at strategic points two or three hundred miles from New York may mean the saving of a day in the environs of New York or Chicago. An improved outlay of tracks, aided by the telephonic despatches from far distant headquarters, is bringing about by a scien­ tific method the speeding up of freight movement corresponding to what has been done in passenger movement, but with less notice. The case of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, with its system between Buffalo and New York interposed between its great competitive neighbors, the Penn­ sylvania, on one hand, and the New York Central on the other, presents a good instance of the strate­ gical handling of this freight terminal improvement problem. The new freight yard at Manchester, with a modern constructed type of transfer platform, is expected to quicken greatly the operation of trans­ ferring east and west-bounci freight for their par­ ticular destinations. Tests have lately been made of the new system that has been devised to avoid waste of traction or haulage, the object being to find out what is the amount of actual saving by the improved methods of transfer. The new electric platform motor trucks, of which a large number will be employed, will play an important part in this improvement. In connection with this Manchester freight yard half way between Rochester and Geneva, which is admirably suited for halting Western freight coming from the Buffalo territory, consolidating it into cars and building up solid trains to be routed to New York, New England points or to northern and southerly districts, a new track connection is F e b ., 1914.] RAILWAY AND INDUSTRIAL SECTION. 5 peculiarly interesting.

One special advantage of the new yard at |there is considerable excuse for its existence. During 6 [Vol . RAILWAY AND INDUSTRIAL SECTION the last few years the English railroad companies have struggled against the increased expenditures resulting from the general rise in wages and prices. By much painstaking they have reduced capital expenditures which was incurred formerly with too great a readi­ ness, so that English railways cost $225,300 per mile as compared with $128,745 in Germany. Since 1900, by better economical operation, the mean train re­ ceipts have been increased from $1 43 to $1 91 per mile. Their efforts to eliminate waste and unprofit­ able expense due to excessive competition between themselves have clashed with popular notions, and Parliament has refused to sanction agreements and amalgamations proposed for dividing traffic into zones served by two or more companies. It has grudgingly consented to an increase in rates to offset the burdens placed upon the railroads by compulsory increase in wages and the expenses incurred in carry­ ing on operations of any sort when a general railway and transportation strike paralyzed national business. With some reason the companies complained that the promises made to them by the Government of Mr. Asquith had not been fully kept, and that there was an absolute breach of faith when the bill which proposed to reward their patriotic action in regard to conciliation was limited in its operation to five years. It is no new story, and England is not the only country where the government has obtained concessions from railroad companies by promising offsets which the responsible Ministers subsequently declared they cannot get the Legislature and the public to endorse. The bureaucratic habits of the German people and the prevalent semi-military atmosphere make Government ownership and operation in Germany much more feasible than it would be in England or the United States, and under the monarchical and autocratic system a better standard of efficiency is obtained in the State railways of Prussia and in other German countries than in France. However, M . Colson, the reporting correspondent in France to the International Railway Congress, in a bulletin recently published reveals the fa ct, that though the German rail­ roads should be much more economically worked, it is not only in France that the expensive character of State operation makes itself apparent. The experience of France confirms him in his opinion that State in­ dustries are incompatible with a democratic and parliamentary regime. When conducted under the Government administration subject to political in­ fluences the tendency must inevitably be towards unnecessary expense and inefficiency. Under a pa­ ternalistic or socialistic system where the spur of competition is eliminated the efficiency can only be maintained by a rigorous bureaucratic administra­ tion and with a degree of acquiescence on the part of the public that is little removed from servitude. R A IL R O A D A N D IN D U S T R IA L XCVIII. In the three years 1909-1912 M . Colson shows that the working expenses of the French railways have been abnormally increased by the extension of State working in consequence of the nationalization of the French Western Railway. While the increase in the expenses of the whole of the private companies in two years was 11%, the increase for the two railway systems operated by the State exceeded 26%. This was caused by the addition to the pay of the em­ ployees due to the pressure exerted through political channels by the labor unions, and this addition was badly distributed and in scarcely any case was com­ pensated for by better efficiency and operation. The French instances show how quickly increases the deficit which results from nationalization and the reckless expenditure which almost inevitably ac­ companies it. The extent to which the railways with a State guaranty are drawing upon the Government for fresh capital is becoming a matter of grave importance, as the treasury is obliged to resort to all sorts of expedients to avoid an abnormal drop in securities which the public considers guaranteed by the State. The upkeep of the status of these shares is an in­ creasing strain upon the Budget, and it is more and more difficult for the Government to raise funds when so much is called from all sides for other objects. In 1912— an exceptionally good year— the condition of the companies uncontrolled by the State was slightly improved, but that of the State railways became worse, and much anxiety is expressed as to what will happen when a slump succeeds the period of prosperity. But an object lesson even more striking is to be found in the case of the Government railways of Western Australia. That State in 1902 followed the example of the Eastern States of Australia in placing its railways under the control of a railway commis­ sioner in order to free them from political influence. This object has been very inadequately obtained, since we find the Commissioner of Railways, John T. Short, protesting in an unusually candid manner against the political pressure brought to bear through the Labor vote and through local interests urging increased expense while demanding lower freights and reduced fares. The Commissioner’s report for the year ending last June shows the State railway to be orf the verge of bankruptcy, owing to the rise in expenses exceeding the increased earnings in gross. It cost £74 to earn every £100 and under existing conditions the Commissioner looks in vain for im­ provement. Wage concessions have cut deeply into the depleted earnings and the complaint of the State Commissioner only echoes the comment of a French statesman on the similar strike in France, that no perceptible benefit has ensued in better service or in the greater contentment of the workmen.
