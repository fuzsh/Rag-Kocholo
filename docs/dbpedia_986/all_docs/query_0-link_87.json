        "text": "Can you find? The sea was colonial New Zealand’s highway which is why Timaru’s architecture and heritage goes hand in hand with our port. The story begins when George Rhodes used our headland to land stores and materials. He built Timaru’s first house in 1851, it only had three walls! This 20 foot hut stood by the beach (centre of these photos) to service his boat landing for his sheep farm at Levels. George Rhodes married Elizabeth Wood in 1854 at Lyttelton. She had come from England in 1850, on one of the first four ships. Later George and Elizabeth travelled across the plains from Lyttelton to Timaru with Sarah McQueen, a family friend, also from England. Elizabeth’s first child, died 1859 August 9, at Timaru, George William Wood, son of George Rhodes, Esqs, aged 4 years.\n\n1890, Mrs Arthur Perry, mother by her first marriage of Mr. Rhodes, M.H R., and three brothers and a sister. Mrs. Geo. Rhodes came to Timaru in 1854 and was the second white woman in the district. She leaves also five children by her second marriage. The cause of Death was heart complaint. Learn more\n\nHe employed the Whaler Samuel Williams who came back to Timaru with his wife Anne and daughter Rebecca and just like that Timaru had it’s first permanent immigrant residents. Their child was the first European baby (William Williams) and was born in this house in 1856 and slept in a gin crate. A small lean-to was added to accommodate two bunks as Timaru’s first hotel. 1860, Nov. 16, at Timaru, Ann, the wife of Mr. Samuel Williams, of the Timaru Hotel died aged 35 years. The first Timaru Herald was published in his kitchen. Sam had the first publican’s license, and he was even the first to have his pub burn down because someone didn’t like the price charged for beer... bad call as the arsonist was sentenced to death! George and Elizabeth Rhodes moved to Levels, where their next house had four timber slab walls, a clay floor and a thatched roof. In 1855 some sheep were stolen from the Levels station, by James Mackenzie.\n\nLearn more about their geniology here\n\nAbout 1857 they say, George Rhodes gave the cottage to Sam Williams, an adventurous young American whaler, who had been given the good-natured nickname ‘Yankee Sam’. Sam was born around1817, his birthplace unknown. As an infant, he lived in Canada and later as a boy travelled to the United States. He is thought to have drifted to Australia with a number of other enterprising youths. By 1840 he left Australia to lead a whaling party out of the port of Sydney. Later Sam turned up at Island Bay, Banks Peninsula, New Zealand, where he began whaling for the Rhodes brothers in 1848. In 1851, Sam left New Zealand, heading back to Australia again this time to the gold fields of Ballarat, where they say he married Anne Manry sometime around 1854. The goldfields didn’t hold much luck for Sam and he returned to New Zealand in 1856. Once more he took up employment with the Rhodes Brothers. This time he worked on Levels Station. Finally, he moved his family into the cottage on the beach in 1857. It was in this same year Archdeacon Henry William Harper remembered riding through South Canterbury on his first journey south from Christchurch. He recalled Sam and his family in a cottage near the beach. Archdeacon Harper could remember the old whaler showing him some of the remaining try-pots left abandoned on the beach. He wrote in his diary. “I spent a pleasant hour with Sam, listening to many colourful yarns of the old days”. Permanent settlers, aside from the large runholders, were slowly getting established in South Canterbury, exposing a need for accommodation in Timaru. Sam and his wife converted the little daub cottage into a general store and offered shelter to travellers. After the addition of a lean-to, the Provincial Government, in 1858 presented Sam with the first publican’s licence ever held in Timaru.

Who would have thought that what had started as a stone store could become a first class theatre? Richard Turnbull was a pioneer merchant and politician. He converted his original stone store into a hall for entertainment and it became the venue for many public meetings. In 1872 J L Hall and Australia actor who had been staging shows in Dunedin brought a troupe to Timaru. He leased the hall for five years before commissioning Maurice Deval (architect and engineer) in 1877 to draw up plans for its conversion into a theatre.\n\nThe original blue stone façade was removed around 1911 by William Gunn The reconstruction contract was awarded to architect Henry White. He also designed the St James Theatre in Wellington. The auditorium is all that remains from Whites building.\n\nIt was renovated for new owner, Moss Jonas in 1882. H E White redeveloped the auditorium in 1911 with an Edwardian auditorium and detailed plaster work. Jonas (1839-1907) used to sell shoelaces on the streets of London. He established a furniture and crockery and auction room business. He was Mayor 1886-1811. HE and his wife Emma had five children. He is buried in the Jewish section of the cemetery.\n\n1877 Richard Turnbull's Hall was converted into \"Theatre Royal\" Opened 16 July 1877\n\n1883 The Theatre rebuilt with substantial improvements\n\n1911 New auditorium and stage was built and foyer modified including a fly tower and dressing rooms.\n\n1961 Purchased from the Gunn family by the Timaru City Council\n\n1963 Theatre was renovated, foyer re-constructed\n\n1993 Major strengthening, auditorium restoration and new foyer design\n\nWoollcombe St is named after Belfield Woollcombe (1816-1891) who was the first government representative to live in Timaru.

Rumour has it Timaru’s Theatre Royal has a ghost. A story that has circulated over the years is that a “lad” fell to his death from the theatre’s fly floor many years ago and his spirit lives on at the theatre.\n\nWhite, Henry Eli (1876-1952)\n\nWhite was the son of a Dunedin building contractor and spent his early years learning a wide range of trades including bricklaying, plumbing, carpentry, joinery and painting. His first major project was in 1908, a tunnel on the Waipori River hydro-electric scheme. He developed a fascination with theatre design and educated himself in its principles while also attending Art School night classes. With the contract to build His Majesty's Theatre, Wellington, for (Sir) Benjamin Fuller in 1912, White moved his thriving practice to that city where he also built the Midland Hotel. White's reputation as a popular and innovative theatre designer grew to the extent that he became one of the most prominent in Australasia. He was to design over 130 theatres as well as a number of commercial buildings. Among his most notable designs were (builder of) The Press Building, Christchurch (1908), architect of His Majesty's Theatre, Wellington (1912), now the St James, and at the time the largest theatre in Australasia, the now demolished Midland Hotel, Wellington, (1916) The Strand, Christchurch (1917), the Tivoli, Brisbane, and his masterpiece, the State Theatre in Sydney. Much loved by audiences for its excessive Art Deco ornamentation, its interior made lavish use of marble, gold and ivory decoration, and featured paintings, sculpture and exotic objects (such as the 'Fujiyama cameo', removed during the Second World War). The Depression marked the end of White's architectural career. He won a competition to design a college at Auckland, but plans were shelved; he closed his office and lost money through farming in New Zealand. By 1937 he had returned to Sydney. Although a cement manufacturing project near Bathurst fell through, dolomite was discovered on the site and during the Second World War his company supplied it for windows and light bulbs made in Australia. White spent much time sailing and big-game fishing. Survived by his wife and two sons, he died on 3 March 1952 at Kings Cross, Sydney, and was cremated with Anglican rites. He had reputedly earned over £1 million in architectural fees, but was not an astute businessman; his estate was sworn for probate at £1147.

This was the town house of George and Elizabeth Rhodes on Corner of George and Latter Streets in Timaru. George Rhodes and his brothers profited from the growth of Timaru by selling their sections of land in the town center. They also contributed to community life: St Mary's Church (Anglican) at Timaru was built between 1860 and 1861 on land given by them, and George was one of the first wardens. George was also a justice of the peace and a member of local committees and institutions. George's life was productive but brief. He died of typhoid fever at Purau on 18 June 1864 at the young age of 47. In Timaru, street names such as George Street and Elizabeth Street honor the Rhodes family still. The Levels was sold but, determined not to leave the region she had such happy memories of, Elizabeth and her five young children lived in their town home \"Linwood House\" which stood behind the present Council chambers. In 1867 Elizabeth married Arthur Perry, a charming young barrister from Tasmania who had commenced a law practice in Timaru. They remained at Linwood until 1873 when they purchased Beverley from Henry Le Cren. A large house on 8 hectares of land at the junction of Wai-iti Rd and the Great North Road, now Highway 1. It was to become a garden of note in the district.\n\nDr Edward Butler (1834-1870) also lived at Lynwood House. He is mentioned in a Strathallan diary as having lived in a one roomed house. His dispensary burnt down in the 1868 fire. He is burred at Timaru cemetery with his son beside him who was born 1864 but only lived 3 months.\n\nTimaru Herald - 7 October 1899 Latter Street presents several sorts of busy-ness just now.

There is also a lovely camelia name for her in the garden. This was gifted to the city by the citizens of Timaru to celebrate the centennial of Women's Suffrage and there is a remarkable story of why and how Kate Sheppard achieve her goal of getting NZ women the vote. The gardeb was officially opened by Dame Miriam Dell on July 3rd 1993. The plantings follow a purple and white theme - the official suffrage colour.

Ornate glass and steel shopping arcades were a feature of many 19th-century cities, but they were less common in towns. Timaru’s Royal Arcade is a fine example, and a sign of the town’s ‘big city’ aspirations. Cast iron columns above allow for maximum glazing of shop fronts.\n\nIt was developed by mayor (1888-1891) David Mitchell Ross (commission agent and notary public) between 1887-1907. six months after he finished his term as mayor he and his partner Sims were adjusted bankrupt. Apparently his books had not been balanced for 12 years. He was later trialed for fraud in 1892 and sentenced to nine months hard labor and did not return to Timaru. \"Judge Ward said for the last twelve years Ross had been a perfect pest to the district, and he wondered how anyone trusted him coming from Dunedin with such a record as he did\" - Poverty Bay Herald, 3 September 1892, Page 2. He is burred in Timaru with his wife Jane 1889 and a month later his mother Mary died.\n\nThe stone work was entrusted to Mr McBride ; the bricklaying to Mr Emil Hall ; the plastering to Messrs Oldrey and Guthrie ; the joiner's work to Messrs Tooth and Pearson ; the painting to Mr Murdoch ; the plumbing to Mr Forbes, and the signwriting to Mr Dickenson, all of whom carried out, their duties in a manner that has given the greatest satisfaction.\n\nThe arcade was redesigned in 1886. In 1996 a roof was added and the redesigned Royal Arcade was opened on the 31st May 1996 by Mayor Wynne Raymond.\n\nAt 17-19 in the Royal Arcade you will find The Arcade Chambers were built in 1907 designed by Architect Wet & Hall and built by Petrie & Mac Dougall in natural brick and plaster mouldings. features arched pediment, pilasters, window detailing and cartouche. This was erected for Charles Bowker in the English renaissance order, and known as the \"Bowker Building'. Charles started his career in Timaru as a manager at Clarkson and Turnbull's drapery, the site of today's Oxford Building. He later worked as a land broker and financial agent building a block of shops in the south of Stafford Street. He donated the band rotunda at Alexander Square, and one of his eight children George, donated 16 acres of land in 1934 to make an entry from Otipua Rd to Centennial Park. The gift and the centenary are acknowledged at the Bowker Gateway, built in 1940 to acknowledge the gift of land linking Centennial Park to Otipua Road opposite Church Street. A condition of this gift was that no buildings could be built in this area to obscure the views.\n\n​Dunedin based architect James Hislop designed the anchor building at the Stafford Street end of the Royal Arcade. Located on the southeast corner, the building was erected for the builders' merchants Priest & Holdgate. Priest and Holgate had an ironmonger's store on the southern corner of the arcade. They used a rail with a small truck operated by Priest & Holdgate from their Sophia Street boundary right though the shop to Stafford St to move heavy hardware stock. An item of much intrigue is the underground railway line linking this building with the original railway station for the transport of goods. During the construction of the Priest and Holdgate new building and the extension to the Timaru Herald building in 1906 various problems were encountered. As the Arcade was built over a filled in gully, the foundations for each building had to be sunk 20 feet, and the workmen struck the roots of the peach trees from the original orchard on the site. They also struck the concrete foundations of an old blacksmith’s shop. Learn more here The business later passed into the hands of Briscoes in the 1950’s.

In 2010 the firm celebrated their 80th anniversary.\n\nWilliam Ferrier (1855-1922) moved from Oamaru to Timaru in 1881 and had his photography and painting studio in the Fife Building opposite the Theatre Royal in 1881 and then later shifted to the Royal Arcade. He helped establish Timaru’s Arts Society, which gave the foundation artworks of the Aigantighe Art Galleries collection. His photographs and paintings are a valuable recourse providing a pictorial history of the time he was living in Timaru. His grandson was the modernist painter Colin McCahon. He died at his home 76 Grey Road in 1922. He had eight children with his wife Eva Beatrice Cunningham who died at Pukiti Bay Waiheke Island. His grave is an almost unmarked plot bearing on W.F - Timaru Cemetery, Stories Behind the Grave\n\nDid you know? When a smell was investigated they found rotting stumps of an old orchard below arcade. In the old map below you can see a stream running through Sophia Street across Stafford Street to the sea\n\nThis hardware shop was entered from the corner of Stafford Street and the Royal Arcade. On January 1st, 1867, Mr Edward Reece sent Mr Priest to Timaru from Christchurch. Edward had a hardware business in Christchurch and it was his intention to open a branch of his hardware store in Timaru and Mr Priest was to be the manager of this new branch. At the same time, Mr Holdgate was working for Clarkson and Turnbull, owners of another large general store in Timaru. However, it was a further six years before Messrs Priest and Holdgate got together. In September 1873, they started off in a partnership with their own hardware business known as Priest and Holdgate. Their business boomed in the ensuing years, it is said that Priest and Holdgate had become recognised as one of the most important hardware firms outside of the principle cities of New Zealand. Referred to as ironmongers, as all hardware businesses were in those early days, the firm catered for a large section of the community including, farmers, blacksmiths, carpenters, engineers, as well as the general public. But their speciality was Agricultural equipment. Some of their branches, included the world renowned McCormick Reaper and Binder. As well as other McCormick products, they also sold products by Andrews and Beaven and P and D. Duncan, along with a host of others. One of their agencies was the world famous Stirling bicycle, but their favourite agency was for the Planet Jr. garden tools, they say that these were recommended for all seasons and were a blessing to all who had gardens. In other words, they did everything in the garden but plant the seed. Learn more\n\nThe first Timaru Holdgate to serve overseas in WW1 was Earnest Arthur George Holdgate. He was born in Timaru in 1875, the fourth son to Edward and Betty Holdgate. Edward and Betty had emigrated from Glossop, England, to settle in Timaru in 1863 sailing on the ‘Victory’, one of the first ships to bring emigrants to South Canterbury. Edward Holdgate and William Priest started the well known hardware shop Priest and Holdgate located in the Royal Arcade on Stafford Street. Earnest Holdgate was educated at Timaru Main School. In time Earnest and several of his brothers worked in the family business and Earnest learnt the trades of locksmith, gunsmith and sheet metal worker. In 1893 Earnest joined the local Timaru Volunteer Rifle Company and was described as quite a marksmen often winning shooting competitions. This must have served him well in the ensuing conflict, and he obtained the rank of Captain shortly after enlisting with the South Canterbury Infantry Regiment in December 1914. He duly embarked with the Canterbury Infantry Battalion to Egypt on HMNZT Willochra departing NZ on 17 April 1915. Being a keen family member and participant in affairs of the Banks Street Methodist Church he was given a large church sendoff and was presented him with a fine pair of field glasses in leather case. After a short spell in Egypt he arrived on Gallipoli with the 4th Canterbury reinforcements on 8th June 1915. From Canterbury Regiment Records it appears the 4ths were then put into the trenches at the dangerous location of Quinns Post where they replaced Australian troops. On 10th July 1915 Earnest was wounded in the arm/shoulder by gun shot/shrapnel. The wound was said to be severe entailing bone damage and initially he was shipped to Malta for treatment, and then went on the hospital ship Dover Castle to England where he was admitted on 15th October to the Endsleigh Palace Hospital in London. By early March 1916 he was considered fit for light duties, and by end of March became fit for general services, embarked to Egypt on 24th March, later rejoined his old unit at Rouen in France where he was taken on strength with the Canterbury C Company 4th Rifles. He resumed his rank of Captain by 5th June 1916. According to unit records the Canterbury’s participated in the Somme battles near Flers and when located possibly in the Goose Alley trench system Earnest received a second wounding – a gunshot wound to the knee on 25th September 1916. By 11th November he is recorded as 2 being admitted to the NZ General Hospital at Brokenhurst in England for treatment, was finally placed on the NZ ill health roll by 21st November, and was returned to NZ on the hospital ship Marama arriving in Auckland on 5th March 1917. Family stories were that during his time in England on various leave he managed to get in touch with old family connections in the Glossop-Manchester area. A photo shows him in a line-up of officers about to be presented to King George V. By 25th April 1917 he was struck off strength and by June was discharged, but continued his military duties with the Territorial Army at Burnham Camp where he was promoted to the rank of Major. In the post-war era he worked in the family firm Priest and Holdgate until it passed into the hands of Briscoes in the 1950’s. He remained interested in fishing, shooting, tennis, gardening and music and continued his association with the Banks Street Wesleyan Church where he continued his Sunday school teaching and organist duties as before the war. He remained unmarried, lived with his widowed sister Ethel in Timaru, and died at the grand old age of 89 years in 29th February, 1964. He is buried in the Timaru Cemetery. John Radcliff was cousin to William, he worked over the road d as a salesmen his fathers furnishing company J Radcliffe at the corner of Stafford and Beswick Streets Timaru. Harold enlisted on 11th August 1914 and sailed for Egypt on the 16th October 1914 with the Canterbury Infantry Battalion. He was killed in action sometime in the first days of the landings at Gallipoli (25th -30th April 1915) and his whereabouts is unknown. He is listed as one of those killed at the landings from the Canterbury Infantry Battalion, and his name is engraved on the Lone Pine Memorial at Lone Pine Cemetery (Gallipoli).

In 1868 the Herald office, next to the Excelsior Hotel), burns down along with 38 other wooden buildings on, or neighboring, Great Southern Rd, now Stafford St. Staff tried to save what was possible from the burning building. While some were tasked with carrying out cases of type and taking down presses, others threw paper from the windows onto the street. Before much was done in this way the men had the fire falling upon them through the roof, and were compelled to desist.

I imagine it was assembled in suitable order and passed on to the linotype operators to type for printing. This was not a simple procedure. The linotype machines were monstrous machines and if seen today would seem like something out of this world. They had an extremely hot area in which lead was placed to melt. The operator would type his article on a keyboard which was then transferred to \"lead slugs\" and assembled in order as columns for the paper. One interesting point to note is that the letters on the \"lead slugs\" were back-to-front so that when the pages were assembled for printing the words were of course around the correct way.

It has historical, social and aesthetic significance or value. It features granite from Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, also used for the pillars in St Mary's Church and headstones at the Timaru Cemetery.\n\nIn recognition of the ‘self-sacrificing bravery and daring of scores of men involved in rescue efforts’, it was decided that a monument should be erected to testify such heroism. The citizens of Timaru were very active in contributing funds for the monument. Designs by Engineer T Roberts were prepared and accepted in 1883 and the first part of the memorial, a pedestal, was erected shortly afterwards by local stonemason, S McBride. In July 1885 the granite obelisk arrived from Scotland aboard the ship the Allegiance that carried 700 tons of cargo including machinery for the South Canterbury Refrigerating Works. and the remainder of the memorial was completed the following month. The Memorial has an octagonal base five metres at the bottom, rising by six steps of cut bluestone, with a square pedestal of polished dolerite, just over 2 metres high and 1.5 metres square with paneled sides, molded base and a cornice. Above rises an obelisk of polished red Aberdeen granite, six metres high (the apex being nearly ten metres above the ground level). Let into three of panels on the sides of the pedestal are brass plates bearing the inscriptions explaining the shipwreck event of May 1882, list the names of the nine dead, those who survived, and the captains of the two ships. The siting of the memorial was controversial. A number of people at the time of its construction thought that the ‘wrecks monument’ ought to have been established at the cemetery, rather than at its conspicuous place in the town. - heritage.org.nz/2045\n\n1882 Dickie, John, 1869-1942.

Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand. /records/692723\n\nThe Benvenue Disaster\n\nWith the increase in sea trade came an increase in danger and disaster. The sea in this part of the New Zealand coastline was treacherous, with strong swells and sudden, unpredictable changes in the weather. The swells threatened ships anchored offshore, and by the time the Harbour Board was first formed in 1877 more than twenty ships had wrecked around the Timaru Coastline.\n\nNot only did the wrecks threaten lives, cargo and rising insurance premiums, they also hurt Timaru's reputation as a viable export hub. There was a lot of intense debate on whether Timaru should have a port and if it did how it would proceed. There was also a difficult choice on where to anchor ships. They were safer out at sea when a gale picked up, but this made loading and unloading more inefficient\n\nConstruction eventually began in 1878 on a breakwater, with 630 ton/400 cubic yards of concrete poured in situ. This original breakwater still stands today, though has been extended and modified over the years.\n\nWhen disaster struck on May 14 1882, many people reaffirmed their support for the harbour. Nine lives were lost when the Ben Venue and the City of Perth both ran aground in heavy sea swells. All the ships’ cargo was lost in the disaster too, drastically damaging the local industry. The City of Perth was carrying over 5000 sacks of wheat, while the Ben Venue had over 500 tons of coal onboard. While anchored in the bay, huge rollers unexpectedly hit and knocked out anchors on both ships. The Ben Venue drifted first, with the City of Perth running aground and smashing into the Ben Venue shortly after.\n\nThousands of people had gathered on the shore and watched helpless as the devastation unfolded. Both ships had successfully evacuated with everyone ashore, but regrettably the harbourmaster, Captain Alexander Mills, made the call to attempt to salvage the City of Perth. Once aboard they quickly realized this was a fruitless endeavor. After launching their own lifeboats these too capsized, throwing 40 men into the water.\n\nIt wasn’t until the next day that they were able to ascertain how many lives had been lost. Captain Mills was among those who perished, dying from exposure the following day. He had saved many lives over the years that he was harbourmaster and he left behind his wife Margaret (nee Sinclair), four sons, and three daughters.\n\nThe calamity of the shipwrecks led to improvements to the breakwater and port safety. Services and parades have been held at the memorial at key anniversaries, notably thirty years after the event in 1912 and the fiftieth anniversary in 1932.\n\nWrecks monument on the corner of Sophia and Perth Streets, Timaru.

In the late 1990s Peter Robson built two sets of wheels for the self launching life boat Alexandra carriage. The lifeboat was at Caroline Bay from 1932 when it was placed there for the 50th anniversary of \"Black Sunday. It then went to the Landing Services Building and then to a store at the Botanic Gardens.\n\nIt is one of only two of its type in the world and is worth six or seven figures. It can self-right if it capsizes in the sea.\n\nOn 18 June 1862 the Canterbury Provincial Secretary wrote to London to order a double-ended 33-foot boat with a six-foot beam, complete with launching carriage and provision for six pulling oars and a steersman. The lifeboat came out to Canterbury on the \"Huntress\" in 1863. She was used on \"Black Sunday\", 14 May 1882, when the \"City of Perth\" and the \"Benvenue\" were wrecked. During the rescue attempts the Alexandra capsized four times and nine lives were lost. Previous to this she hadn't been used for thirteen years. The first report of a rescue boat being on stand-by at Timaru came from \"The Lyttelton Times\" which reported in October 1861 that \"the lifeboat, stationed at Le Crens,\" could not be launched except by taking it a mile away. and arrived in Timaru in 1864. It was called 'Alexandra' and the highlight of its long service record was the rescue in 1882 of 43 passengers when two big sailing ships, the City of Perth and the Benvenue, were wrecked. The rescue boat made several rescues, then rolled four times with the loss of ten lives, including seven members of the rescue boat crew. The spirit of courage and selflessness which the 'Alexandra's' crew showed in that storm goes on to this day as rescue boats crewed by volunteers from the far south to the far north of New Zealand risk there lives.

Te Papa (C.014373) A 60ft high brick tower construction began in 1872 but it only operated for a short time, as it was demolished in 1888. In 1865 William and James Parr build a flour mill powered by a over-shot water wheel. The mill was the second to be built in South Canterbury and was operated by the Parrs and subsequent owners until 1905. The wheel is the oldest mill reminant on its original site and was retored in 1988.\n\nDisastrous Floods The great storm of 1868 was a violent storm that swept across much of New Zealand between 1–6 February 1868, wrecking 12 ships – including the Star of Tasmania and Water Nymph at Oamaru – and causing extensive flooding. About 40 lives were known lost and at the time an estimated £500,000 to £1 million worth of damage was caused. The storm is currently thought to have been an extratropical cyclone, which peaked in New Zealand over the period between the 3rd and 4th. In total 2,585 tons of shipping was lost, which was nearly half the tonnage lost during the full year. The flooding in the south of the South Island was the worst until 1945.\n\nThe mill was erected a short time ago near the banks of the Opihi River, and not far from the Point accommodation house which is distant from it about two miles. The mill was owned by two brothers, James and William Parr, who have lately resided in a weatherboard house, close to the mill. In the same house with them there lived a man, who, we believe, was their overseer. At a short distance from the Parrs’ house there stood another house in which resided a man named Salter, his wife, and family of four children. Between ten and eleven o’clock on Monday night Salter observed water on the floor of his house and that it was rapidly rising. He ran over to the Parrs, and found them in bed. He told them that water was then from a boot to eighteen inches deep in their house, and warned them of the danger of remaining inside. They replied they had known higher floods than that was, and told Salter there was no real risk, and advised him to go back to bed. Not long after Salter had regained his house, the water suddenly rose and with a frightful rush swept clean away both houses. The poor man saw his wife and children in the roaring torrent but was powerless to save them. Salter clung to a portion of the debris of his house, and was carried some distance along with the flood, and was picked off yesterday morning by a horseman who managed to reach him after the water had greatly subsided. Our informant who visited the scene of the fatal catastrophe yesterday morning stated that not a vestige of either houses remains, and beyond the bare patch of ground where the houses stood, there is no other sign that human habitations ever existed there. From the fact of Parr’s house being so utterly demolished, and the marks in the mill showing that at least five feet of water stood there when the flood was at its highest, we fear that little hopes can be entertained of the unfortunate men having escaped with their lives. All hope though must not be quite abandoned as it is quite possible the men may have clung to a portion of the wrecked house, and got washed down among the farmstead below, and so have escaped.\n\nFurther information of the damage done by the late disastrous floods on these plains discloses a terrible state of things, and the loss of property in sheep and crops will be, we fear, when an accurate estimate can be arrived at, very heavy indeed. We have since our report on Wednesday visited the scene of desolation at Parr’s mill, from whence, at a distance of about a quarter of a mile, are the remains of the houses of the Parrs and Salter. The houses stood close together, and within a very few yards of the mill, when on that stormy Monday night the flood swept over then, first carrying away the Parr’s house, and almost immediately afterwards that of Salter’s. The two Parr brothers had just time to seize upon a portion of the side of the house, when they were carried away in the surging torrent. One of them thus describes the scene: - “We were carried swiftly along, and in the darkness of the night, and in the roar of the surging waters all around us, we could not tell where we were, and at one time we thought we had drifted to sea. We could see nothing on every side but water, and we had given ourselves up for lost. When the few weather boards on which we clung struck the ground, we jumped down and waited there, surrounded by water, till help came the following morning.” They suppose it to have been about one am on Tuesday morning when they started on their perilous voyage, and the spot from where they were rescued – a distance of fully four miles – was reached, according to the men, in an incredibly short space of time, such was the rapidity of the torrent. It appears that during the passage down, their raft struck against a farm cottage belonging to a family of the name of Moore, and severely damaged it. Of the Parrs’ neighbours, the Salter family, a sad tale has to be told. Salter, finding the water in his cottage rising higher and higher, placed his wife and four children on the top of the table in hopes the water would not reach them. Suddenly the house burst asunder, and in the noise and confusion of the falling roof, and masses of timber floating about and knocking against him, the poor man could do nothing to save his family. Wife and children were swept away, and Salter himself clung to a small portion of the woodwork, and was drifted on to a dry patch of ground from whence he was taken off the next morning. Mrs Salter’s body was picked up on the plain on Wednesday morning about three miles from the Mill, and the body of one of the children was recovered the same day. Another body was recovered on Thursday afternoon somewhere on Gaffney’s farm near to the main road. The other two bodies have not yet been found. About one and a half miles below the mill there are five or six farm buildings, the inhabitants of which were all washed out, and had to seek refuge at the Levels station. At this locality the loss has not been very excessive, as only one farm stood near to where the main body of water came. On this farm though, belonging to Mr Hoare, a good breadth of corn has been very seriously damaged, and all the fences near to the river have been washed away. Huge gaps have been made in the fences higher up on the plain, but the crops there have escaped serious injury. Following the course of the flood torrent from these farms to the next farm buildings where Parr’s farm is situated, we found melancholy evidences of the ravages which the water had made. Every here and there were dotted dead sheep, portions of clothing, bedding, timber, torn up bushes, parts of houses, and all kinds of rubbish. At Parr’s farm the signs of destruction were even more visible – fences torn away for considerable distances, trees uprooted, and mixed with all the rubbish were sides and roofs of houses, dead animals, pieces of timber, etc. Lower down than Parr’s farm, nearer the river, the flood water was greatest and did very considerable damage, some of the farmers whose homesteads lay in the immediate course of the stream having lost their all – their houses being destroyed, and their crops, on which they depended for a subsistence, being so damaged as to be not worth reaping. One farmer had a large quantity of wheat and oats in stock. Almost every stock has been washed away and scattered over the plain. On that farm alone (the Hoares’) the loss is estimated at £500. Lower down the plain and near to the high road, a like destruction has visited the farmers, no house having escaped being flooded and crops if not actually swept away, so damaged as to be worthless. The scene here on Monday night, or rather at daybreak on Tuesday morning was truly awful. One farmer (Barrett) finding the water rapidly rising in his house, placed his wife and family on the top of a large loaded waggon standing near his house, about one am, and there patiently waited till dawn. When daylight came, Barrett saw nothing round him but one vast sheet of surging water, so deep that his waggon, he says, must have floated if it had not been kept down by its load of a ton of coal. The water round the waggon was over 4ft deep, and floating or rather whirling past, were numbers of sheep, pigs, timber and all kinds of rubbish. A great many of the sheep were dead, but some were still struggling for life as they were carried past the waggon. Fortunately Barrett saved his bedding and blankets, and his wife and children were kept pretty warm in their uncomfortable position, but they could not provide or cook any food. They remained on the top of the waggon till half past two pm on Wednesday when the water suddenly flowed off. Half an hour before the water left them it stood two feet about the waggon, but by half past two o’clock the land was comparatively dry, the water having gone off in a sudden rush. Probably the shingle bank bordering the sea was then broken through which would account for the sudden withdrawal of the water. In this neighbourhood three houses have fallen, one belonging to James Brosnin, and two to John Brosnin. Barrett has lost heavily in his crop, about £200 worth, and the Brosnin’s are also considerable sufferers. One farmer had a fine lot of standing wheat of about two acres swept bodily away, together with the land it grew upon. On Tuesday morning as soon as Mr Rooke, a farmer residing near the Washdyke heard of these families being flooded out, he took his trap to render assistance. He found in the middle of the plains water from three to four feet in depth, which he had to pass through before reaching the houses. All who sought Mr Rooke’s house were, of course, most hospitably treated, but we must say that 37 souls in all, the number present, is a somewhat severe tax on any man’s hospitality. On Wednesday afternoon they were enabled to return to their respective homes. The main road, from Gaffneys farm to Patterson’s hotel, presented a sad appearance on Thursday afternoon, some of the post and wire fences had been washed bodily from their places, and had been carried by the water across the road – entwined with the fences were all sorts of rubbish, posts, rails, and timber which had been brought down from the farms higher up, and we also observed a pair of harrows which had been brought down in a mass of rubbish from a farm a mile and a half from the road. On and bordering the road were dead sheep, sheaves of corn, and boxes and chests which had been washed out of farm homes. The gully by Young’s farm was, even on Thursday afternoon, heavily flooded, as the water was passing over the bridge there, to a depth of about eighteen inches. The road, from the gully to Patterson’s is not much damaged although the water was standing on parts of it to the depth of two or three feet on Tuesday. The Patterson family were completely washed out of the hotel on Monday night, and had to take refuge at Young’s farm house, which was comparatively free of water. Lower down the plains towards the sea, we hear that the Messrs Rhodes’ have suffered very severely in sheep in the seadown paddock, and also have lost a large stockyards, and a great quantity of fencing. Fully 80 chains of fencing, are, we hear, requisite to be done before the paddocks can again be available. The beach at the mouth of the Opihi, and for a considerable distance both north and south presents a melancholy sight. Dead sheep, hay, sheaves of oats, and wheat, heaps of fencing material, and a vast amount of firewood all lie in inextricable confusion and among the rubbish we observed the body of a large bull and a steer, the latter having a large piece of timber athwart his neck. The bull belongs to the Levels station, and is, we believe, a valuable animal. Learn more\n\n1-7 Strathallan St\n\nLN:2055 C:2\n\n1901\n\nArchitect James Turnbull\n\nBuilder Baird\n\nD. C. Turnbull and Co was one of the first large companies to emerge n the area. In 1901 they built their premises close to one of the landing services for the port and rail wagons were once able to be directed into the warehouse by a turntable and access tunnel built in the cliffs. The tunnel still exists although it is now closed off and it seems that went some distance underground further than The Terrace and near Stafford Street. Today you can see the large brick store and their buildings on the land between The Terrace, Strathallan St, the cliff which remains as offices today. The building was designed by D.C. Turnbull's brother, architect James Stuart Turnbull who also designed the Aigantighe, Chalmers Church and shops on Stafford Street.\n\nMiles & Co Ltd acquired merchant Henry Le Cren’s business in 1867. They were considered one of the best wool and stock businesses in NZ. In 1901 the building was purchased by grain and seed merchant firm David Clarkson Turnbull and two-storied offices with show-room were added. They were engaged in the wool, grain, and frozen meat trade and had their own sailing vessel to carry consignments into any inter-colonial port.\n\nIn 1904 Timaru Port was the third in New Zealand for agricultural exports.\n\nSignificant elements include pilasters, window details, dentilled cornice and parapet.\n\nMany years ago, Guinness and Le Cren were founded on the Pyne, Gould, Guinness site in 1891. A tunnel and track once continued on under The Terrace, what is now Wright, Stephenon and Company's property, and ended behind the buildings that were occupied by Pyne Gould Guinness Limited now Community House on 27-29 Strathallan Street. The track and tunnel were in use more than half a century ago with horses pulling railway wagons along the siding and through the tunnel. It is substantial, nine feet across and arching to 8ft 6in formed from bricks. but were blocked off in the city center by a brick wall in the 1920s. The east side of the tunnel was used as an air-raid shelter and is now a storeroom for bales of straw. Learn more\n\nDid you know?

The ship was two weeks early and caught our towns folk off guard, so the new locals had to sleep in the wool shed until their homes were built. More arrived including six boatmen and their families from Deal, UK. A cob cottage still stands on 20 Avenue Road where one lived. Their skill was critical at the time for landing boats. But it was dangerous and became the first to be buried in the Timaru cemetery.\n\nThe Terrace used to be called Le Crens Terrace. The Harbour Board lighthouse stood at the rear of section 7 from 1878 until it was replaced by a navigation light above Dashing Rocks in 1970. Blackett's Lighthouse was relocated to Cnr of Te Weka St and Benvenue Ave and then further down the road at the top of the cliff.\n\nA newer iron lighthouse was constructed on site in 1903 by the Timaru harbour board. It was built to overcome the ineffectiveness of the harbour light. The lighthouse originally resided on Somes Island North of the Wellington Harbour in 1866. The Lighthouse had a sole keeper, who lived on station until 1930 when a gas operated light was installed. The lighthouse sits proudly at Tūhawaiki Point, nicknamed Jacks point after the Maori Ngai Tahu chief Hone Tūhawaiki who drowned there when his whaleboat capsized. - maritimenz.govt.nz/Tuhawaiki-Point\n\nA traction engine with four wagons loaded with wool bales posed outside Miles & Co Limited, Strathallan Street, Timaru, post 1895.

When the 1880’s grain market was yielding low returns, William Evans and investors set up the Atlas Roller Flour & Oatmeal Milling Company in 1888 on Station St. This followed the Timaru Milling Company which set up NZ’s first roller mill in 1882. Architects Black & Dunning designed a 3 story office in 1909 in a Edwardian with Flemish baroque influence style.

Thomson's and the Old bank Hotel 1913. Mr. Foster was born in Deal, Kent, England, in 1856, and accompanied his parents to Lyttelton, when he was three years of age. He was educated in Timaru. His father, who was one of the Deal boatmen, came out to work the surfboats at Timaru, and died in 1900, at the age of seventy-six. His widow still survives. Mr. P. Foster was apprenticed to the building trade, and found employment as a journeyman in Timaru till 1882, when he went to Australia and worked in connection with buildings in Melbourne till 1894, when he returned to his native town, and established his present business. The premises in Stafford Street consist of a substantial brick workshop, standing on a quarter of an acre of freehold land. Mr. Foster has erected a good many buildings in the district, and had the contract for re-instating the High School's woodwork, which was destroyed by fire. He served for three years as a volunteer in the old battery of Artillery, and as a Freemason he is connected with Lodge Caledonian, N.Z.C. Mr. Foster was married, in January, 1882, to a daughter of the late Mr. H. Thornton, builder and contractor, Timaru, and has one son and three daughters. His grave is at the Timaru Cemetery General Row 29 Plot 203. Learn more\n\nPhilip Jarvis Foster, was a replacement boatman for the Timaru Landing servicemen. They lived in a cob house in Arthur St. opposite Sutter St. It was his task to run down to the foreshore and light the tar signal barrel as necessary. He was also a sailmaker and later made tents and horse covers. After the harbour works had destroyed the boating industry Mr Foster carried on the business of sail and tentmaker until incapacitated by failing health about two years ago. He was a highly respected and valued member of the Wesleyan congregation. He leaves a widow and numerous grown up family of children and grandchildren.\n\nTimaru Herald, 12 April 1910, Page 6\n\nThe Atlas Chambers in Beswick street, erected to the order of the Atlas Milling Company, are now wearing completion, and are already adding to the appearance of this business portion of the town, a large central up-towering gable standing out in impressive prominence. As a building it has more than one worthy feature; it is of fire-proof construction, the floors and partitions being of ferro-concrete. Light and ventilation, were insisted on, and the instructions regarding these matters, as others, have been faithfully and capably carried out. To gain the desired end the building has been set back in line with, the C.F.C.A's. fine block, and this arrangement has proved specially beneficial on the ground floor. The chambers are entered through a pretty and well-proportioned porch, which turns to the right, and a flight of stone steps descends to the base floor, which is intended for either a cafe or a restaurant, measuring 26ft. by 80ft. The light admitted from front and back and by a large lantern light in the centre comes into the room in generous fashion, while a protecting area on the street has a handsomely wrought hand-rail. Ascending from the basement one goes up four marble steps into the vestibule of the main building and is admitted by swing doors to a. corridor, featured by nice dados of figured rimu. The ground floor has been divided into a suit of offices, with strong rooms. Here again first attention has been paid to lighting facilities, all the partitions having lead-light screens, placed 9 ft. from the floor, and giving an effect, pleasing and novel. The stair-case well is in the centre of the building, from it is an artistic stair-case, set off by square-turned newels, and chastely finished handrails and bannisters in kauri and rimu. The top floor has been so planned that it can be divided into single apartments or into one suite of fine offices and a studio. The style of the building is the modern English renaissance architecture, faced with Oamaru stone and red brick, and having carved ornaments nicely distributed. The details, which have a Spanish tendency, have been worked out on the most refined lines, and the facade of the building has large and neatly-planned windows, relieved with hood-moulds, prominent cornices, an effective centre gable, and small Ionic columns supported on an outstanding pediment. Messrs Dunning and Black, were the architects, and Mr P.

Newspapers reported that there ‘was a large crowd present and the day was generally observed as a holiday’. First sod and ‘last spike’ ceremonies, celebrating the commencement and completion of railway projects, were major social and community events in the later 19th century.

In the above photo the Mayoress of Timaru, Mrs Cain, turns the 'first sod' of the Temuka-Timaru railway at a ceremony on 4 October 1871. By 1879 this railway was one of the great achievements of the Vogel rail-building programme would stretch all the way from Christchurch to Invercargill. Construction of the Fairlie branch (also known as the Eversley Branch) began in 1874. It closed in 1968, but a portion remains open in Pleasant Point as the Pleasant Point Museum and Railway. 1878 the first express trains Christchurch-Dunedin covered 370km in 11 hours. By 1880, New Zealand Railways (NZR) was operating more than 1,900km of track, and carrying almost three million passengers and 830,000 tons of freight a year.\n\n\"To give an idea of the work m the railway at Timaru, we have only to state that before the site of the railway station was brought to the required level, a very large quantity of the cliff had to be excavated, the depth in some places being thirty feet ; and where excavation was not necessary the site was reclaimed from the sea. For the purpose of reclamation, a protective wall was built along the edge of the sea. This is 378 feet long, 24 feet in height on the slope, and constructed of 15 inch stone pitching in cement.\" - read papers past here\n\nOne of the first engine's to vist Timaru: Learm more here\n\nTimaru being reached in February 1876 during the Construction of \"The Great South Railway\".

These included the Mayors of Ashburton, Hokitika and Greymouth. The Commissioner of Railways [ie, the General Manager] for the South Island, Mr W. Conyers, having determined to keep to the set timetable, had allowed only a 30 minute stop instead of the 45 minutes expected; \"The feelings of the disappointed ones may be better imagined than described\". Departure from Timaru took place at twenty minutes to eleven, accompanied by another artillery salute and an even larger crowd of spectators \"cheering with hearty goodwill\". - http://the-lothians.blogspot.com/2016/04/\n\nCanterbury Railways: Full Steam Ahead The Provincial Railways of Canterbury, 1863-76, read a thesis by Alastair Adrian Cross here\n\nTimaru Railway Station.

The brick buildings constructed in 1888 and 1897 have architectural significance, being designed by well-known Dunedin architect, James Hislop. They have technological value in their early utilisation of roller mills rather than traditional mill stones.\n\nIrishman, William Evans, arrived in New Zealand in 1861 to take part in the Otago gold rush. In 1874 he came to Timaru and selected a site for a grain store, commencing business as a timber, coal and wheat merchant. He actively promoted the Atlast Flour Mill which in 1888 became the Evans Atlas Roller Flour and Oatmeal Milling Company. He had for many years been a member of the Timaru Harbour Board, and was a director of the Timaru Gas Company. Evans Street is named after him.\n\nThe store he built ‘on the beach facing the railway yard’ was a large concrete structure. In 1888 a large five storeyed brick mill building, the Atlas Mill, was erected for Evans’ ‘in front of’ his existing concrete store. The largest section of the mill building contained engine room and offices on the ground floor and the milling machinery on the four floors above. Another section contained the wheat cleaning plant; the third section was the boiler house, with dust chamber above. A loose grain elevator lifted grain into a storage bin holding 1000 sacks. Steel rolls were used instead of traditional mill stones – and they processed the wheat, refining it to take the bran out of the flour. The state-of-the-art roller milling machinery was for a 40-ton per day mill, the first bag of flour bearing the ‘Atlas’ brand being produced in January 1889. Goodman Fielder manufactured pasta products from the complex for a number of years. After the Timaru Milling Company closed in 2005, new owners Turnbull Holdings Ltd, began a programme of strengthening the buildings.\n\nTurnbull St is named after Richard Turnbull (1826-1890) who founded Clarkson & Turnbull. He was a member of the first Timaru Borough Council, on the Harbour Board and later a Member of Parliament. He built Timaru's first hall on the site of the present Theatre Royal. One of his sons was an architect. Another founded the grain and shipping firm D.C Turnbull & Co.\n\nUndated photograph of construction work adjacent to Evans Atlas Flour Mill, Timaru (circa 1950?)

In 1882, the Timaru Milling Company Ltd opened the first, and also the largest, roller mill in New Zealand. The main brick building of the plant is six stories in height and still stands on Mill Street. The onset of World War II meant that the New Zealand Government were looking for local suppliers of international products to sustain New Zealanders during this period of unrest. The Timaru Milling Company was issued with a licence to manufacture pasta in 1941 and the small scale production of Diamond pasta began. Diamond was New Zealand’s first pasta brand and at the time pasta was still a relatively exotic product. It wasn’t until the 1970s that the popularity of pasta began to grow in New Zealand.\n\nA mounted photograph entitled \"Evans' Atlas Roller Flour Milling Company, Timaru, N.Z\", circa 1892. Shows the grain storage area to the south of the mill (in the background) prior to the second grain store being built in 1897. The grain is shown stored in a long open fronted shed which is almost full with sacks of grain. Several men are standing in front of the shed and to the right is the Evans' Atlas building. In front of the building is the locomotive 'A' 68 linked to wagons also loaded with grain. South Canterbury Museum 2775\n\n1939 Roundhill, Bernard, 1911-2005.
