        "text": "[1] The first meeting of the reconstructed Rainbow Circle was held at the Rainbow Tavern, Fleet St., at 7 p.m. on Wed: 7 November 1894.\n\nMr William Clarke was in the chair.\n\nAfter dinner the following business was transacted:\n\nResolved: That the Committee have power to invite two visitors to the Dinners, provided that the visitors are capable of contributing to the discussion.—Moved by Rev Percy Dearmer, seconded by J.A. Hobson and carried unanimously.\n\n72 On 2nd November 1903 Robertson lost an action for libel he had brought against the proprietors and publishers of the Leeds and Yorkshire Mercury. An article had been published accusing him not only of being a rabid little Englander but of dealing with ‘matters unmentionable in polite society’ when editor of the Free Review, and he was pronounced unsuitable to represent Tynesiders as their prospective Liberal candidate. Cp. Daily News. 3.11.1903.\n\n167 Of particular interest are the following: in Canada, the Arbitration Act of 1888 (Nova Scotia) and the Industrial Disputes Investigation Act (1907), known also as the Lemieux Act; in Australia, the Industrial Arbitration Act of New South Wales (1901) and the Law of Arbitration and Conciliation (1904); in New Zealand, the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act (1894), discussed by Reeves in Meeting 30 and by Harley in Meeting 94.\n\n243 Joint standing industrial councils were proposed in 1917 by a subcommittee of the Committee on Reconstruction, chaired by the Liberal M.P. J. Whitley. The councils that were formed consisted of representatives of employers and of trade unions and submitted recommendations on issues such as terms of employment and the prevention of differences between the two sides of industry.\n\n247 The annual programme announced a talk by H. Golding for this meeting entitled ‘The Ethics of Insurance’. Golding never gave that address to the Rainbow Circle, but delivered what presumably was the same talk to the Pearl Office Guild, a discussion group of the Pearl Insurance Company (cp. The Pearl Gazette, vol. ii, no. 11 (09 1923Google Scholar). It was published as ‘The Social Value of Insurance’ in The Insurance Gem (09, 1923), 4–5.Google Scholar\n\n259 Copies of Parsons' accompanying letter as well as the letter to MacDonald exist in the files of the Sir Richard Stapley Educational Trust and read as follows:\n\n18 Feb. 1924.\n\nRainbow Circle\n\nDear\n\nBy direction of the Circle I send you herewith a copy of a letter recently addressed to the Prime Minister, who has expressed his pleasure in accepting the invitation. Will you be so good as to note that the date fixed is Wednesday 27th February.*\n\nYrs: sincerely,\n\nAmbrose Parsons\n\nHon. Sec.\n\n* The meeting in fact took place a week later.\n\n260 The National Savings Committee was formed in 1916 as part of the National Savings Movement, to encourage wise saving and spending, to undertake propaganda work on behalf of thrift and to advise on and approve financial details of schemes for the investment societies. It launched national savings certificates. T.L. Gilmour was on the committee from the outset. Cp. The National Savings Movement. Its Origins, Aims and Development (London, 1931).Google Scholar"
