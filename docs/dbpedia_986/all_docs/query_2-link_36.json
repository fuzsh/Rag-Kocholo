        "text": "Invasion History\n\nFirst Non-native North American Tidal Record: 2000\n\nFirst Non-native West Coast Tidal Record: 2000\n\nFirst Non-native East/Gulf Coast Tidal Record:\n\nGeneral Invasion History:\n\nUndaria pinnatifida is native to the Northwest Pacific, from Vladivostok, Russia (Golikov et al. 1976), southward on the coasts of Japan, Korea, China, and Hong Kong (Huang 2001; Guiry and Guiry 2016). In its native range, it is widely cultivated as a food plant (Floc'h et al. 1996; Silva et al. 2002). It has been widely introduced around the globe, including Atlantic France where it is cultured as food (1st record 1983, Floc'h et al. 1996); the Mediterranean coast of France where it was introduced accidentally with Pacific Oysters from Japan (1st record 1971, Verlaque 2001); and several other regions, including New Zealand (1st record 1987, Hay and Luckens 1987); Australia (1st record 1988, Valentine 2003); Argentina (1st record 1992, Casas et al. 2004); and California (1st record 2000, Silva et al. 2002). Its occurrence in small yacht harbors, marinas, and fishing ports as well as commercial shipping harbors suggests that hull fouling is the most frequent vector (Hay 1990; Fletcher and Farrell 1999). Ballast water transport of spores is also possible – Undaria pinnatifida's spores survive up to 14 days in light, however their survival in darkness is not known.\n\nNorth American Invasion History:\n\nInvasion History on the West Coast:\n\nUndaria pinnatifida was first found on the West coast of North America at Cabrillo Beach, Los Angeles, California in 2000 (Silva et al. 2002). In the same year, it was found in Santa Barbara Harbor and in Channel Islands Harbor and Port Hueneme, Oxnard (Silva et al. 2002). In 2001, it was found on floating docks in Monterey Bay (Silva et al. 2002). Attempts were made to control the alga, by divers physically removing fronds (Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary 2009). However, in June 2009, U. pinnatifida was detected at Pillar Point in Half Moon Bay and the San Francisco Marina and South Beach Harbor in San Francisco Bay (Zabin et al. 2009). By 2012, it was seen at additional locations in the Bay, including Fort Mason, Pier 39, Fisherman’s Wharf, and along the Hyde Street pier in San Francisco (Fimrite 2012). The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center's Tiburon group has been sponsoring monitoring and removal efforts. Undaria pinnatifida has continued to spread to new harbors and bays in California, including San Diego Bay in 2004 (Miller 2009, cited by Kaplanis et al. 2016); Morro Bay in 2009; Oceanside Harbor in 2013; Mission Bay in 2014; and Santa Cruz Harbor in 2014 (Kaplanis et al. 2016).\n\nInvasion History Elsewhere in the World:\n\nThe first documented introduction of Undaria pinnatifida was discovered in the Thau Lagoon, Sete, France, on the Mediterranean Sea, an estuary extensively used for oyster culture (Grizel 1991; Verlaque 2001). In the Mediterranean Sea, U. pinnatifida has become established in the Lagoon of Venice (Adriatic Sea) (Occhipinti Ambrogi 2000), and the Gulf of Taranto, Italy (Cecere et al. 2000). On the Atlantic Cost, U. pinnatifida was deliberately planted for attempted cultivation near the Isle de Groix, the Isle of Ushant, and St. Malo (Brittany) in 1983, by IFREMER (French Institute for Exploration of the Seas), and persisted around cultivation sites after cultivation was abandoned (Castric-Fey et al. 1993; Floc'h et al. 1996). From the Brittany peninsula, U. pinnatifida spread north and south in a spotty fashion. It became established in Galicia, Spain, on the Atlantic Coast by 1988 (Fletcher and Farrell 1999; Peteiro 2008), but was not reported from the Bay of Biscay (Gijón, Asturias, Spain) until 1995 (Peteiro 2008). In 2007, it was discovered in Northern Portugal (Araujo et al. 2009). To the north, it was first found in Port Hamble on the Isle of Wight, England, on the English Channel in 1994 (Fletcher and Farrell 1999), and spread east to the Zeebrugge, Belgium, on the North Sea, and Yeserke, Netherlands, on the Oosterschelde Estuary in 1999 (Wolff 2005; Kerckhof et al. 2007). In harbor surveys in the English Channel in 2004, it occurred from Brighton in the East to Torquay (Cornwall) in the west (Arenas et al. 2006). In 2012, it was found in Belfast Lough, Northern Ireland, where it is now established, and was considered likely to spread northward (Minchin and Nunn 2014).\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, U. pinnatifida was first discovered in 1987 in Wellington Harbor, New Zealand (Hay and Luckens 1987), on the North Island. By 2004, it occurred in Waitemata Harbor (Russell et al. 2008), near the north end of the North Island, and at Stewart Island, at the south end of the South Island (Nelson 1999). In 2006, U. pinnatifida was discovered on the mooring ropes of a fishing boat off the Sub-Antarctic Snares Islands (48.03°S). Eradication was considered, but found to be not feasible (Invasive Species Specialist Group 2009; Global Invasive Species Program 2009). In another group of New Zealand Sub-Antarctic Islands, the Chatham Islands, the kelp was successfully eradicated from a sunken ship hull 2 km offshore, using heat treatment (Wotton et al. 2004). In 1988, this seaweed was found in Triabunna, Tasmania (Valentine 2003), and has become widespread on the east coast of the island (Valentine and Johnson 2005). In 1996, it was first discovered on continental Australia, at Point Wilson in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria (Currie et al. 1999; Lewis 1999). We are not aware of continental Australian records outside of Port Phillip Bay. Undaria pinnatifida has also invaded the Southwest Atlantic. In 1992, it was found in Gulfo Nuevo, Patagonia, Argentina (Casas et al. 2004). By 2000, it had colonized most of the Gulf (Casas et al. 2008), and in 2005 it was found in Ria Deseado in southern Patagonia (47.75°S) (Martin and Cuevas 2006). Currently, in Patagonia, it ranges from 38 to 48°S (Casas et al. 2004; Pereyra et al. 2014; Raffo et al. 2014; Schwindt et al. 2014).\n\nGeneral Impacts\n\nIn its native range in the Northwest Pacific, Undaria pinnatifida is a widely harvested and cultivated sea vegetable. It has invaded coastal waters in Europe, North America, South America, and New Zealand. It has been listed by the Invasive Species Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) as one of the '100 worst invasive species.' (Invasive Species Specialist Group 2016). However, both negative and positive ecological impacts have been reported from invaded areas (Petrocelli and Cecere 2015). Epstein and Smale (2017) argue that U. pinnatifida may not be a driver of environmental change, and can be managed as a potentially valuable species, creating new habitat and fisheries. However, they acknowledge that these outcomes depend on environmental context and that effective policies will depend on local research (Epstein and Smale 2017).\n\nEconomic Impacts\n\nUndaria pinnatifida (Wakame) is a commercially valuable food species, intensively cultivated in Asian waters. It is not regarded as a pest or invasive species in its native range. Global harvests since 2000 are 1.5-2 million tons per year (Pickering et al. 2007; Food and Agriculture Organization 2016). At least one attempt was made to cultivate it in Atlantic France (Floc'h et al. 1993). Web searches indicate that fresh Wakame is imported to the U.S. and is available in Asian markets, but we do not know whether the plants are viable or potentially could be planted by individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, U. pinnatifida also fouls equipment used in aquaculture. Undaria pinnatifida has proliferated on mussel aquaculture farms in New Zealand, with subsequent spread to adjacent reefs (James and Shears 2016). It grows densely in marinas and docking areas (Fletcher and Farrell 1999; Farrell and Fletcher 2006; Sfriso and Facca 2013). In New Zealand, a risk assessment exercise concluded that U. pinnatifida posted moderate impacts to boating and aquaculture, but major risks to aesthetics and diving in high-value protected marine areas (Campbell and Hewitt 2013). Experimental and full-scale attempts to control this seaweed have been made in the Venice Lagoon, New Zealand, Tasmania, and California, intended to protect natural communities and fisheries. These involved divers in hand removal (Hewitt et al. 2005; Anderson 2006) or mechanical eradication (Curiel et al. 2001). In New Zealand, from 1997 to 2009, large-scale eradication efforts were conducted to protect areas of high natural value (e.g. Stewart Island) and donor port areas (e.g. Bluff Harbour), to prevent spread to Sub-Antarctic islands. This included removal of sporophytes from vessels, piers, and other artificial structures (Hewitt et al. 2005; Forrest and Hopkins 2013). A successful eradication in the Chatham Islands, on the hull of a sunken ship, involving using divers to place boxes with heat elements and flatme torches against the hull, was successful, at a cost of ~$ 3 million NZ dollars (Wotton et al. 2004). Since the gametophyte and early sporophyte stages are microscopic, control by hand monitoring will require continuous monitoring and removal efforts (Curiel et al. 2001; Hewitt et al. 2005). In New Zealand, the cost of the control efforts and the continued spread of U. pinnatifida led to the abandonment of the control program (Forrest and Hopkins 2013).\n\nEcological Impacts\n\nCompetition- The invasion of U. pinnatifida in the Venice Lagoon is believed to have decreased abundance of native understory seaweeds (Curiel et al. 1998; Curiel et al. 2001). However, Raffo et al. (2009) did not find evidence of competition between native Macrocystis pyrifera and U. pinnatifida when examining growth and density of the two species in Cracker Bay, Patagonia. However, this could be due to examining an earlier phase of invasion (Raffo et al. 2009).\n\nHabitat Change- Reported impacts of U. pinnatifida on habitat quality vary regionally among different ecosystems, and have been rated as positive, negative, or neutral (Petrocelli and Cecere 2015). In habitats dominated by native kelps, U. pinnatifida is smaller than some native kelps and can be seasonal, dying off after reproducing, which results in a regular loss of habitat cover (Arnold et al. 2015). Suarez et al. (2017) found that morphology of seaweeds was the major factor affecting diversity of epibiota, in comparisons of U. pinnatida versus native species, with more structuarly complex species favoring higher diversity. In Wellington Harbor, New Zealand, the invasion of U. pinnatifida altered invertebrate communities and increased sediment deposition (Battershill et al. 1998, cited by Schaffelke and Hewitt 2007). In Patagonia, the diversity of fauna associated with the holdfast of U. pinnatifida was decreased, compared to that of the native kelp Macocystis pyrifera (Raffo et al. 2009). In reef areas, off northern Patagonia, reefs with a low degree of relief, which were invaded by Undaria, had a low diversity of fishes compared to similar uninvaded reefs. Reefs with higher relief were not noticeably affected by an Undaria invasion, because Undaria tended to colonize only the lower portions of the reefs, leaving many refuge areas unaltered (Irigoyen et al. 2011a).\n\nHowever, impacts of Undaria pinnatifida on seaweed diversity or benthic invertebrate assemblages were not detected in a rigorously designed survey (BACI, before-after-control-impact) in Lyttleton Harbor, New Zealand, possibly because canopy-forming species, providing similar structure were already present (Forrest et al. 2002). Experimental plots covered by Undaria had higher algal biodiversity and greater abundance of several invertebrates than sites from which Undaria was removed (Irigoyen et al. 2011b). Similarly, in the Mar Piccolo, Italy, the invasion of U. pinnatifida improved habitat quality in a heavily polluted lagoon with little attached vegetation, providing habitat or epifauna and spawning habitat for squid (Cecere et al. 2000).\n\nFood/Prey- The effects of U. pinnatifida on grazers and food webs has been studied only in a few localities. Experimental studies in Tasmania, New Zealand, and Patagonia indicate that it is avoided by some grazers, but grazed heavily by others (Valentine and Johnson 2005; Teso et al. 2009; South et al. 2015). In southern New Zealand, U. pinnatifida, during its peak of abundance, doubled the biomass and primary productivity of the lower intertidal community (South et al. 2015). Experiments in England also support mixed preferences by grazers, and the absence of 'enemy release' due to reduced grazing or relaxation of chemical defenses (Mabey et al. 2022).\n\nRegional Impacts\n\nNZ-IVNoneEcological ImpactHabitat Change In Wellington Harbor, the invasion of U. pinnatifida altered invertebrate communities and increased sediment deposition (Battershill et al. 1998, cited by Schaffelke and Hewitt 2007). However, impacts of U. pinnatifida on seaweed diversity or benthic invertebrate assemblages were not detected in a rigorously designed survey (BACI, before-after-control-impact) in Lyttleton Harbor, New Zealand, possibly because canopy-forming species, providing similar structure were already present (Forrest et al. 2002). MED-VIINoneEcological ImpactCompetition The invasion of Undaria pinnatifida in the Venice Lagoon is believed to have decreased diversity and abundance of native understory seaweeds, through competition for substrate (Curiel et al. 1998) SA-INoneEcological ImpactCompetition In Gutto, Gulfo Nuevo, Patagonia, the invasion of U. pinnatifida decreased diversity of native seaweeds (Casas et al. 2004). However, Raffo et al. (2009) did not find evidence of competition between native Macrocystis pyrifera and U. pinnatifida, when examining growth and density of the two species in Cracker Bay, Patagonia. This could be due to examining an earlier phase of invasion, however (Raffo et al. 2009). Undaria pinnatifida in Patagonia frequently settles on Styela clava, and potentially could interfere with the growth of the tunicate. However, this has not been experimentally studied (Pereyra et al. 2017). AUS-IXNoneEcological ImpactCompetition Invasion of Undaria pinnatifida, in Tasmania, decreased diversity of native seaweeds. There was partial recovery, but with changed community composition after experimental removal of U. pinnatifida (Valentine and Johnson 2003). Experimental removal of the native seaweed canopy, simulating sea urchin herbivory, resulted in rapid increases of U. pinnatifida, rising form 7% of cover in controls to 35% in cleared blocks (Edgar et al. 2004). SA-INoneEcological ImpactHabitat Change The diversity of fauna associated with the holdfast of U. pinnatifida was decreased, compared to that of the native kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, in Cracker Bay, Patagonia (Raffo et al. 2009).

Reefs with higher relief were not noticeably affected by the Undaria invasion, because Undaria tended to colonize only the lower portions of the reefs, leaving many refuge areas unaltered (Irigoyen et al. 2011a). Experimental plots covered by Undaria had higher algal biodiversity, and abundance of several invertebrates than sites from which Undaria was removed (Irigoyen et al. 2011b). Exudates of Undaria affect the optical properties of seawater and stimulate microbia growth (Lozada et al. 2021). NEA-IIINoneEcological ImpactHabitat Change Unlike two of the major native kelps (Laminaria ochroleuca, Saccharina latissima), U. pinnatifida dies off seasonally, as does another native kelp, Saccorhiza polyschides. Undaria pinnatifida supports a less diverse epizoic community than the perennial kelps so its spread may decrease biodiversity (Arnold et al. 2015) NEA-IVNoneEconomic ImpactFisheries Undaria pinnatifida was harvested for the food industry (4 tons of algae collected from algoculture in Brittany in 2008) (Stiger-Pouvreau and Thouzeau 2015). NZ-IVNoneEconomic ImpactFisheries Undaria pinnatifida has proliferated on Greenshell Mussel (Perna canaliculata) aquaculture farms, with subsequent spread to adjacent reefs (James and Shears 2016). NZ-VINoneEcological ImpactFood/Prey Undaria pinnatifida has been spreading in seaweed beds in southern New Zealand. It was consumed by 3 of 4 species of native grazers (an amphipod and 2 gastropods), at rates comparable to native seaweeds, but not by an isopod (Batedotea elongata). It is considered to have the potential to alter local foodwebs (Jimenez et al. 2015). In a community study, U. pinnatifida had only transient effects on community composition, but resulted in an overall doubling of biomass and primary production during its peak abundance (South et al. 2015). NEA-IIINoneEconomic ImpactShipping/Boating Dense fouling of pontoons occurred in marinas in Torquay, England. However, over a period of 7 years, U. pinnatifida did not colonize adjacent shorelines or breakwaters. NZ-IVNoneEconomic ImpactShipping/Boating A risk-assessment panel concluded that U. pinnatifida had moderate impacts on moorings and boating in New Zealand as a result of fouling (Campbell and Hewitt 2013). P080Monterey BayEconomic ImpactAesthetic A 10-year program to control Undaria pinnatifida through hand removal by divers in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary has an allocation of $160,000. The motivation is to slow the spread of U. pinnatifida and protect native kelp communities (Anderson 2006; Davidson et al. 2015). NEP-VNorthern California to Mid Channel IslandsEconomic ImpactAesthetic A 10-year program to control Undaria pinnatifida through hand removal by divers in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary has an allocation of $160,000. The motivation is to slow the spread of U. pinnatifida and protect native kelp communities. Evidence for negative impacts in California is unclear, but the native kelp community is highly valued (Anderson 2006; Davidson et al. 2015). NZ-VNoneEconomic ImpactAesthetic A successful effort was made to eradicate U. pinnatifida from the hull of a sunken trawler in the Chatham Islands using heat treatments by divers. The overall cost of this effort was ~3 million $NZ. The marine kelp and reef communities of the Chatham islands are considered to be of high fisheries, ecological, and tourist value (Wotton et al. 2004). MED-VIINoneEconomic ImpactAesthetic In eutrophic portions of the Venice Lagoon, Undaria pinnatifida forms large floating masses (Sfriso and Facca 2013). A photograph on the AlgaeBase website, shows large masses surrounding moored gondolas, probably unattractive to tourists (Guiry and Guiry 2016). Experimental mechanical removal of Undaria pinnatifida from plots in the Venice Lagoon was more effective in July, after the reproductive period, than in March, when the seaweeds were fertile. The July removal allowed other algae to colonize the cleared area and delayed recolonization for about 2 years. However, the experiment showed that effective eradication would have to be done at a very large scale (Curiel et al. 2001). NZ-VINoneEconomic ImpactAesthetic A risk-assessment panel concluded that U. pinnatifida had major aesthetic impacts on diving in protected marine areas in New Zealand. One of the areas targeted was Bluff Harbour, a departure point for ships going to Fjordland, Stewart Island, other Sub-Antarctic Island (Hewitt et al. 2005). The control program included removal of sporophytes from vessel hulls, pilings, and other artificial structures, and wrapping pilings to kill the plants by shading and anoxia. After 2009, the program was abandoned because of coast and the continued spread of the seaweed (Forrest and Hopkins 2013). MED-IVNoneEcological ImpactHabitat Change The invasion of Undaria pinnatifida in the Mar Piccolo, Taranto, Italy, improved habitat quality in a heavily polluted lagoon with little attached vegetation, providing habitat or epifauna and spawning habitat for squid (Cecere et al. 2000). MED-VIINoneEconomic ImpactShipping/Boating Undaria pinnatifida in the Venice Lagoon interferes with navigation of small boats (Sfrizo and Facca 2013). SA-INoneEcological ImpactFood/Prey In Puerto Madryn, Patagonia, experimental studies found that the sea urchins Arbacia dufresnii and Pseudechinus magellanicus grazed lightly on Undaria pinnatifida, while the gastropod Tegula patagonica fed on the kelp's epibiota. However, P. magellanicus was not seen feeding on this kelp in the field (Teso et al. 2009). AUS-IXNoneEcological ImpactFood/Prey In Tasmania, the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma grazed significantly on Undaria pinnatifida sporophytes, but did not prevent the establishment of a canopy. Experimental manipulations indicated that urchin grazing was not responsible for the dominance of Undarua over native algae (Valentine and Johnson 2005). NZ-IVNoneEcological ImpactCompetition\n\nUndaria pinnatifida showed greater photsynthesis (quantum yield) than native New Zealand Kelps at high temperatures (20 and 25 C, 6 and 12 PSU) (Bollen et al. 2016). Removal experiments indicated that when light and nutrients are not limiting, U. pinnatifida invaded undisturbed and cleared plots at about equal rates. The introduced kelp does not appear to be impeded by naitve algae, at least at this site near Wellingotn, New Zealand (Morelissen et al. 2016). After a marine heatwave, U. pinnatifida largely replaced dominant native kelps of the genus Durvillea. Undaria initially colonized a wide range of the intertidal zone, but died out in the upper intertidal, and was replaced by smaller brown seaweeds, and persisted only in the lower intertidal zone (Monite and Thomsen 2023)\n\nNZ-VINoneEcological ImpactCompetition Undaria pinnatifida showed greater photsynthesis (quantum yield) than native New Zealand Kelps at high temperatures (20 and 25 C, 6 and 12 PSU) (Bollen et al. 2016). NEA-IIINoneEcological ImpactCompetition The invasion of Undaria pinnatifida, in Plymouth Sound, is partially inhibited by the presence on native kelp canopies, and favored by disturbance, but U. pnnatifida is capable of establishing itself in intact native communties (De Leij et al. 2017). Removal experiments showed small reductuins in growthperennial native kelps (Laminaria digitata and Saccharina latissima), but 3-6X increase in biomass for the annual kelp Saccorhiza polyschides (Epstein et al. 2019). AUS-VIIINoneEcological ImpactHabitat Change Planted patches of Undaria pinnatifida attracted native rocky-reef fishes in areas where native seaweeds had been grazed off by sea urchins. The authors suggest that Undaria may be beneficial in places where naitve flora cannot persist (Barrett et al. 2019). NEP-VIPt.
