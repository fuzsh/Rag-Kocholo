That night, O'Connell attended an event in the May Street Music Hall, while some Belfast locals outside pelted each other with stones and others smashed windows. One stone went through the window at the Kern's Hotel, where O'Connell was staying, and shattered the great chandelier inside.

In July, the Belfast Newsletter reported that the town's hospitals were overflowing and that some of the emaciated were stretched out on the streets, dead or dying.[53]\n\n1849 - The Belfast Harbour commissioners, members of the council, gentry, merchants and the 13th Regiment officially opened the Victoria Channel on 10 July aboard the royal steamer Prince of Wales.

They were received jubilantly by the people of Belfast with fanfare and decorations adorning the streets. The royal family moved up High Street amidst rapturous cheers and well-wishing. On the same street, a 32-foot high arch had been built with a misspelled rendering of Irish Gaelic greeting \"Céad Míle Fáilte\" (a hundred thousand welcomes) written on it. In the White Linen Hall, the Queen viewed an exhibition of Belfast's industrial goods. Belfast was recovering from a cholera epidemic at the time of the Royal visit, and many credited Victoria and Albert with lifting the spirits of the town during a difficult period.

A funeral for a victim of police gunfire turned into a loyalist parade that unexpectedly went up through Donegall Square in the heart of Belfast. Police barely held as a barrier between the Protestants marching through Belfast's main streets and the irate Catholics who were massing at Castle Place. Continuous gunfire resounded throughout the city until a deluge of summer rain dispersed most of the crowd.[55]\n\n1869 - Gustav Schwab creates the White Star Line and orders all of his ocean vessels from Harland & Wolff, setting the firm on the path to becoming the biggest ship building company in the world.[55]\n\n1870 - Construction of Belfast Castle on Cave Hill is complete.[54]\n\n1871 – Ormeau Park opens.[57]\n\n1872 - During the summer, about 30,000 nationalists held a demonstration at Hannahstown in Belfast, campaigning for the release of Fenian prisoners, which led to another series of riots between Catholics and Protestants.[58]\n\n1874 - Home Rule became mainstream in Irish politics.

In the same year, following The Twelfth Orange Institution parades, clashes took place between Catholics and Protestants, and also between Loyalists and police. Thirteen people were killed in a weekend of serious rioting which continued sporadically until mid-September with an official death toll of 31 people. (For more information see: 1886 Belfast riots)[citation needed]\n\n1888 – Queen Victoria grants city status to Belfast which was Ireland's largest city at the time as well as the third most important port (behind London and Liverpool) in the United Kingdom and the leader in world trade.

Belfast was also the world's leading manufacturer of \"fizzy drinks\" (soft drinks).[63] The city of Belfast is 75% Protestant, however, the whole island of Ireland is 75% Catholic.[65]\n\n1901 – Population of Belfast is estimated to be 349,180.[34]\n\n1906 – Belfast City Hall and Victoria Park open.[66][67]\n\n1907 - The city saw a bitter strike by dock workers organised by radical trade unionist Jim Larkin. The dispute saw 10,000 workers on strike and a mutiny by the police, who refused to disperse the striker's pickets. Eventually the British Army had to be deployed to restore order. The strike was a rare instance of non-sectarian mobilisation in Ulster at the time.[68]\n\n1910 - Irish Unionists chose Edward Carson, a lawyer and former Conservative Party MP for Trinity College Dublin, as their leader. In September. Unionists led by Carson raise a militia, the Ulster Volunteers (or Ulster Volunteer Force), to resist Home Rule by force if necessary. The Ulster Unionist Council secretly requested a price quotation from a German arms manufacturer for 20,000 rifles and a million rounds of ammunition.[citation needed]\n\n1911 - Carson and the UCC voted for the first disbursement of funds to be used in the acquisition of arms.[citation needed]\n\n1912 – The RMS Titanic leaves Belfast on 2 April and heads for Southampton.[69] Prime Minister H. H. Asquith introduced the Home Rule Bill in the Commons on 11 April. The Third Home Rule Bill was proposed by the Liberal government and would have granted limited autonomy to an all-Ireland Irish Parliament.[citation needed] The Titanic sinks on 15 April on the way to New York after colliding with an iceberg with over 1,500 lives lost.[70] The Ulster Covenant is signed on 28 September by Edward Carson and other Unionists collecting almost 500,000 signatures in opposition to the Third Home Rule Bill.[71]\n\n1914 - A shipment of 24,000 rifles with five million rounds of ammunition, or 216 tonnes, arrived in Ireland in April. Alarmed by the events up north, the almost-defunct Irish Republican Brotherhood was revitalised as a direct response to the actions of the UV.<[citation needed] John Redmond suspected that the Irish Volunteers were secretly being controlled by the IRB from within and moved to take over the militia, but failed. Observing the success of the Ulster Volunteers in arming, the Irish Volunteers also contacted gun manufacturers in Germany to purchase arms.[citation needed] King George V, fearing civil war, became involved and sponsored peace talks in Ulster, which eventually broke down.[citation needed] The Great War begins on 3 August when Germany invades Belgium.[72] The men of the UV and Irish Volunteers both by and large joined the British Army.[citation needed] Carson offers the UV militia to General Herbert Kitchener, commander of the British armed forces. Kitchener agrees and keeps the UV command structure together as the 36th Ulster Division (Kitchener also refused to make a separate division for the Irish nationalists).[citation needed] Redmond urged the Irish Volunteers to fight and defend Ireland as well as the more abstract ideals of freedom and religious equality. By this, he meant joining forces with the British and fighting for the king. Eoin MacNeill refused to fight for the British overseas, and led a minority of 11,000 to form their own militia with the name \"Irish Volunteers\" in the split. The majority group, led by Redmond, re-branded as the National Volunteers.[citation needed] The Third Home Rule Bill passes on 18 September. Asquith attempts to avoid civil war in Ireland by introducing several measures proposing that island be partitioned. Unionists demanded that the six north-eastern counties of Ireland (four of which had Protestant majorities) be excluded from Home Rule.[73]\n\n1916 - At least 210,000 Irishmen had enlist; 1/3 of the UV joined and, though Ulster supplied more than half of the Irish recruits, 57% of those who came from Ireland were Catholic. In Belfast, Catholics were more likely to join the military than Protestants. Nearly 28,000 of those who joined to fight in France never returned to Ireland.[citation needed] The Battle of the Somme from 1 July to 18 November claims the lives of many Ulstermen including those from Belfast.[71] Britain suffered over 54,000 casualties; the Ulster Division alone had 5,700 killed or wounded (over 10% of the total losses).[74] The UUC mandates that their goal in September to have the six northeast counties of Ulster be an exclusion zone from Home Rule.[citation needed]\n\n1918 - World War I ends in an armistice on 11 November.[75] Sinn Féin win a majority of seats in general election on 14 December in Ireland, with 14 Unionist and 14 Sinn Fein/Irish Nationalist seats returned in the Province of Ulster (see List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election). SF goes on to abstain from both the new Dublin Parliament and the House of Commons in London. SF forms the alternative Dáil Éireann, which would eventually become the governing body of the future Republic of Ireland.[citation needed]\n\n1919 - From January, guerrilla fighting between security forces and the Irish Republican Army (IRA) increased, eventually escalating into the Anglo-Irish War.[76]\n\n1920 - Rioting breaks out in Belfast on 21 July, starting in the shipyards and spreading to residential areas. The violence was partly in response to the IRA killing in Cork of northern Royal Irish Constabulary police officer Gerald Smyth, and also because of competition for jobs due to the high unemployment rate.[77] Protestant Loyalists marched on the Harland and Wolff shipyards in Belfast and forced over 11,000 Catholic and left-wing Protestant workers from their jobs. This sectarian action is often referred to as the Belfast Pogrom. The sectarian rioting that followed resulted in about 20 deaths in just three days. Both Catholics and Protestants were expelled from their homes by the other side, sometimes by fire. The further IRA assassination of an RIC Detective Swanzy in nearby Lisburn on 22 August prompted another round of clashes, in which 33 people died in 10 days.[citation needed] Amidst political unrest, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 entered the statute book, officially creating Northern Ireland on 23 December.[citation needed]\n\n1921 - Elections on 24 May give Unionists a landslide victory with 40 seats, while Sinn Féin and other Irish Nationalists won only six seats each. James Craig became the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.[78][79] King George V offered to open Northern Ireland's parliament on 22 June 1921 in hopes that it would bring peace negotiations.[citation needed] Belfast suffers a day of violence known at the time as 'Belfast's Bloody Sunday'. An IRA ambush of an armoured police truck on Raglan Street killed one RIC man, injured two more and destroyed their armoured car. This sparked ferocious fighting in west Belfast on the following day, Sunday 10 July, in which 16 civilians (eleven Catholics and five Protestants) died and 161 houses were destroyed. Gun battles raged all day along the sectarian 'boundary' between the Falls and Shankill Roads; rival gunmen used rifles, machine guns and hand grenades. Four more would die over the following two days.[citation needed] After a truce leading to peace talk between Republicans and the British Government, the Anglo-Irish War ends on 11 July with a treaty.[80] The second spike in violence happened from 29 August to 1 September, in which twenty people were killed. The third eruption was in November, when more than thirty died in response to the IRA bombing city trams taking Protestant workers to the shipyards, killing seven people.\n\n1922 – Belfast becomes the capital of Northern Ireland.[34] After the Anglo-Irish Treaty confirms the partition of Ireland into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State, Michael Collins, a leader in the Republican movement and commander of the IRA, covertly sends arms and aid to the northern IRA with the aim both of defending the Catholic population there and sabotaging the government of Northern Ireland in hopes of its collapse. Loyalists recognised the IRA's tactic of subversion and openly attacked Catholic neighbourhoods, which were somewhat defended by IRA gunmen. Roughly thirty people were killed in Belfast in February 1922, sixty in March and another 30 in April. Recurring cycles of violence continued until the summer of 1922. In response to this most recent conflict, the First Dáil imposed a boycott on goods produced in Belfast from 6 August, which proved to be ineffective. The McMahon Murders of 26 March, and the Arnon Street Massacre of a week later, in which uniformed police shot a total of twelve Catholic civilians dead in reprisal for the killings of policemen, were two of the worst incidents.[81] On 29 April, King George V grants the Ulster Special Constabulary the title of Royal Ulster Constabulary. On 22 May, the IRA assassinated unionist politician William Twaddell, in Belfast. Immediately afterwards, the Special Powers Act was passed in an effort to stop the chaos. Internment (arrest and imprisonment without trial) was introduced, and over 350 IRA men were arrested in Belfast, crippling its organisation there.[citation needed] May saw seventy-five people killed in Belfast, and another 30 died there in June. Several thousand Catholics fled the violence and sought refuge in Glasgow and Dublin. However, after this crisis, the violence declined rapidly. Only six people died in July and August and the final conflict-related killing took place in October 1922. The Republican movements splits after the public votes in the Treaty via referendum resulting in the Irish Civil War beginning on 28 June.[82] In July, legislation was rushed through to abolish proportional representation in local government elections. Violence in Northern Ireland subsides with the introduction of internment and the South being distracted by the civil war. Around 90% of the 465 deaths in Belfast were civilian on civilian.[83] The Irish Free State is established on 6 December per the Anglo-Irish Treaty.[84]\n\n1923 - The death toll in Northern Ireland between July 1920 and July 1922 was 557 men, women and children; 303 were Catholics, 172 Protestants and 82 members of the security forces.[85] In Belfast, 236 people had been killed in the first months of 1922 but there was not a single sectarian murder in the city between 1923 and 1933 Northern Ireland was reputed to have one of the lowest crime rates in Europe during this period.[86]\n\n1924 – Musgrave Park opens.[87]\n\n1925 - James Craig calls a snap election in April to demonstrate Unionist solidarity against the Boundary Commission, using the now famous catchphrase \"not an inch\".[citation needed] A leaked report published in the Morning Post newspaper on 7 November details the conclusions of the commission. Parts of Donegal and Monaghan were conceded to Northern Ireland, with only the town of Crossmaglen going to the Free State; the population of NI would ultimately be reduced by only 1.8%. James Cosgrave and Craig (the latter had hitherto refused to participate in the commission) rushed to London to meet with the new Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, where they agreed to suppress the Boundary Commission and keep the border as it was. Craig returns to a hero's welcome in Belfast in December.[88]\n\n1928 - Ten nationalists sat in the Northern Ireland Commons receiving no acclaim for their willingness to cooperate and returning to their seats. The only bill the Nationalists got through from 1928 to 1972 was the Wild Birds Protection Act.\n\n1929 - James Craig (who had been awarded a peerage and was now Lord Craigavon) abolishes proportional representation in parliamentary elections. Though the impact was most felt by smaller parties, Nationalists considered this another harsh measure to oppress the minority. The 1929 Stock Market Crash in New York had wide-reaching effects around the world in places like Northern Ireland. Economic interests in the province, particularly large industries like shipbuilding, were hit hard.[citation needed]\n\n1931 - Speaking in the Commons, Joseph Devlin castigates the Unionist party for snubbing the willingness of Nationalists to cooperate, favoring \"old party lines\" and treating one-third of the population as political pariahs.[citation needed] Harland & Wolff did not launch a single ship between December 1931 and May 1934.[citation needed]\n\n1932 - Sectarian tensions increased, to the alarm of the Unionist community, as Éamon de Valera (a staunch Republican leader and Easter Rising veteran) assumed the premiership of Free State Ireland. When the Church of Ireland announced plans to commemorate the coming of Saint Patrick to Ireland, a Catholic cardinal commented publicly that \"the Protestant church in Ireland, and the same is true anywhere else, is not only not the rightful representative of the early Irish church, but it is not even a part of the Church of Christ.\" This brought Protestant outrage, pushing tensions to the breaking point and Loyalists responded in June 1932 by attacking Catholic pilgrims returning to Belfast on public transport from the Eucharistic Congress in Dublin. Denouncements of Catholicism grew louder as the Loyalist summer marching season came closer. The situation was made worse by the fact that many of Northern Ireland's unemployed were in a state of privation and some were starving.[citation needed] On 30 September 1932, MPs in Northern Ireland's House of Commons shouted in protest over the 78,000 unemployed and their lack of food. One MP threw the mace on the floor and accused the House of hypocrisy. On 3 October 1932, 60,000 unemployed Catholics and Protestants marched together in solidarity to a torch-lit rally at the Custom House. The bands who marched alongside the protesters were careful not play any sectarian songs, and instead opted to perform the popular tune \"Yes, We Have No Bananas\". On 11 October, crowds formed up on Templemore Avenue in east Belfast and began to march. The police, drawing their batons, were given the order to charge and stormed into the crowds; some marchers were beaten, many fled. Rioting broke out on the Lower Falls Road and police, armed with rifles, fired and mortally wounded one Catholic and one Protestant. News spread to the nearby Shankill Road, a traditionally loyalist area, where a woman in a shawl was quoted by a reporter from The Irish Press as shouting \"they're kicking the shite out of the Peelers [police] up the Falls! Are you's going to let them down!?\" Shankill Protestants ran the few blocks to aid the mostly Catholic rioters against the police in a rare episode of non-sectarian unity. Shocked, the Government conceded to their demands and increased aid to the unemployed of Northern Ireland, pacifying the population. The new Stormont Parliament buildings are opened on 16 November in a ceremony that included King George V.[citation needed]\n\n1933 - By January, the volume of international trade was only one-third of what it had been before the Crash.[citation needed]\n\n1934 – Belfast Zoo opens to the public.[89]\n\n1935 - The Workman, Clark and Company shipyard closes down permanently.[citation needed] There was another summer of tension as the Church of Ireland Bishop of Down appealed to the public to forget the \"unhappy past\" and endeavor to work together. In response, at the Belmont Field, Orange Order Grand Master Sir Joseph Davidson asked rhetorically \"are we to forget that the flag of Empire is described as foreign flag? And our beloved King insulted by Mr. De Valera? Are we to forget that the aim of these people is to establish an all-Ireland, Roman Catholic state in which Protestantism is to be crushed out of existence?\" That night, as the observers at Belmont Field returned to Belfast, fierce fighting broke out on York Street, which raged for days. When calm returned eight Protestants and five Catholics had been killed and 2,000 Catholics had been driven from their homes.[citation needed]\n\n1937 - Éamon de Valera unveils his constitution in 1937, Articles 2 and 3 stated that the government in Dublin had the right to exercise jurisdiction over the entire island of Ireland. The constitution also recognised the validity of the Protestant Church and others, however, it gave special status to the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland.[90]\n\n1938 - Craigavon calls for a general election to show his contempt for the Irish Constitution, with the Unionists winning a crushing majority over Nationalists and others. By February, nearly a third of industrial workers were unemployed. Eyewitnesses recall seeing barefoot children at the Albertbridge pens in Belfast hoping to get unwanted, unsterilised milk before the cattle were shipped to England. Belfast Corporation would only build 2,000 council houses between the World Wars and many were built with inferior materials amidst accusations of corruption. Malnutrition was also a major issue for families both in the Free State and Northern Ireland, with a 9.6% infant mortality rate in Belfast, compared with 5.9% in Sheffield, England. Maternity was more dangerous in Northern Ireland than in England or the Free State, with maternal mortality rising by a fifth between 1922 and 1938. Tuberculosis was also a concern, killing many young people in Belfast and other areas.[citation needed]\n\n1939 - Nazi Germany invades Poland on 1 September triggering World War Two.[91]\n\n1941 - The Belfast Blitz occurred on Easter Tuesday, 15 April. Two hundred German Luftwaffe bombers attacked the city, pounding working class areas of Belfast around the shipyards and north Belfast, in particular, the New Lodge and Antrim Road areas. About a thousand people died and many more were injured. Of Belfast's housing stock, 52% was destroyed. Outside London, this was the greatest loss of life in a single raid during the war. Roughly 100,000 of the population of 415,000 became homeless.[92] Belfast was targeted due to its concentration of heavy shipbuilding and aerospace industries. Ironically, during the same period the local economy made a recovery as the war economy saw great demand for the products of these industries. The British government had thought that Northern Ireland would be safe from German bombing because of its distance from German positions, and so had done very little to prepare Belfast for air raids. Few bomb shelters were built and the few anti-aircraft guns the city possessed had been sent to England.[93]\n\n1951 – The population of Belfast is estimated to be 443,671.[34]\n\n1957 – The Ulster Society of Women Artists is established.[94]\n\n1962 – The Belfast International Arts Festival is established.[95]\n\n1969 - Riots break out from 12–16 August.[96] In response, the British Army is deployed to Northern Ireland on 14 August as a peace-keeping force beginning Operation Banner.[97] Peace walls are erected by the army throughout the country between Republican and Loyalist communities, the largest is in Belfast between the Falls Road and Shankill Road areas.[98] The Provisional IRA split from the Official IRA in December.[99]\n\n1970 – Fighting breaks out between the IRA and the British Army after the army searches for weapons in the Falls Road area with the armed forces imposing the Falls Curfew.[100] The Ulster Defence Regiment is established and made up of local men.
