        "text": "To the west, thousands of lakes speckle the island of Ireland, made up of the Republic of Ireland (covering the majority of the island to the south) and Northern Ireland (top eastern corner). The largest lake in the region is Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland.\n\nBrown rugged cliffs along the island’s west coast frame its plush green interior.\n\nIreland enjoys a mild climate, which is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean (to the left) and the presence of the Gulf Stream. Southwesterly winds from the Atlantic result in high rainfall figures in the northwest, west and southwest of the country.\n\nIn the lower-right corner, the river Seine flows through Paris (seen here as a grey area) and snakes toward the English Channel.\n\nFollowing mainland Europe’s coastline north, we can see the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta followed by part of the intertidal Wadden Sea in the extreme top-right corner.\n\nThe green and tan-tinted swirls in the seas and channels are due to sediments being transported in the water. Sediment is particularly concentrated around Britain’s southeastern coast, carried by the River Thames through London and into the North Sea.\n\nThis image was acquired by Envisat’s Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on 28 March 2012."
