Over the past twenty years he has developed the four research strands democratization studies, EU-China relations, citizen diplomacy and academic freedom. His applied social and political science research bridges theory and practice and aims to inform western China policy.\n\nDr Fulda's forthcoming book Germany and China: How Entanglement Undermines Freedom, Prosperity and Security (Bloomsbury, 2024) has been widely praised:\n\n\"China matters to Germany, Europe and the world. Getting our policy towards a resurgent China right is important to Germany, Europe and other democracies. Andreas Fulda has raised serious questions about the German establishment's engagement with China in this book. It should be required reading for policy makers and others interested in how we should engage China.\" - Steve Tsang, Director of the SOAS China Institute\n\n\"Andreas Fulda masterfully dissects a series of Germany's pathological self-deceptions which hamper effective foreign policy, trade, and security. Exercising an impressive degree of self-reflection and impartiality, Fulda shows how a moralized, dysfunctional style of debate helped sustain obsolete policy images. The book thus offers the rare feat of not only a meticulously researched problem analysis, but also an applied example of how a robust implementation of transparency in political debates may be implemented.\" - Pascal Jürgens, Professor of computational communication science, Trier University\n\n\"Germany and China: How Entanglement Undermines Freedom, Prosperity and Security is a tour de force. Grounded in 25 years of research and on-the-ground experience, Andreas Fulda's third book provides an ominous critique of Germany's economic and psychological dependence on China, and the subsequent threat posed to Germany's national security. Fulda contextualises his epic account in a rich socio-political history of Germany and China relations, offering both a philosophical and pragmatic critique.\" - Dr Jane Richards is a lecturer in law at The University of Leeds. She did her PhD in human rights law at The University of Hong Kong, during Hong Kong's 2019-2020 anti-extradition protests\n\n\"In this highly readable monograph, Andreas Fulda scrutinises, and debunks, some of the most consequential flaws in German academic and policy thinking about the People's Republic. Xi Jinping's unmistakably clear intent to make China the next superpower requires no less than a strategic view on this country, underpinned by serious China expertise. Fulda's account, thus, betrays the power-related frictions that conventional German approaches will need to undergo. The author's research achieves this ambitious goal rather superbly.\" - Maximilian Terhalle, Visiting Professor, London School of Economics\n\n\"This book carries important lessons for democracies in general. It shows the risks of developing deep economic interdependencies with autocratic regimes - how they may lead to highly destructive material and psychological dependencies, opening-up for malign foreign influence. As such, Fulda's new book provides a critical contribution and a must read for European policymakers and business managers at large now struggling with 'de-risking' their China relations and developing greater autocracy competence in the wake of Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine.\" - Mikael Wigell, Research Director at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs\n\n\"Fulda discusses the ideas and policy decisions that led to the current level of dependency and vulnerability. It is required reading for anybody who wants to know how we got there, how politicians, scientists, diplomats and lobbyists created the German ideology of 'rapprochement through interweaving'. Fulda also offers a way out of the policy of voluntary entanglement. His book is a landmark on the way to a new strategic culture vis-à-vis China.\" - Jörg Lau, Foreign Affairs Editor at DIE ZEIT\n\n\"Fulda provides ample evidence that deficits and failures at the political level have an impact on numerous other domains and can thus, in their entirety, turn into a substantial threat to a country's economic sustainability and social cohesion. But Fulda does not stop at simply pointing the finger at failures in his home country. He also makes a number of helpful and constructive suggestions that I hope will receive the attention they deserve.\" - Alicia Hennig, Interim Professor for General Business Studies at the International Institute Zittau, TU Dresden\n\n\"Combing his expertise as a consultant in Germany's development agency, a political scientist and China scholar, Andreas Fulda analyses China studies' formation and underlying trends. Analyzing his positionality in these debates and contextualizing the discourses, Fulda makes a significant step for our area to foster our self-reflexivity and need to explore our positionalities for future research and discussions. At a time when the whole academic cooperation with China is adjusted, Fulda's work is required reading for all China scholars.\" - Sascha Klotzbücher, Associate Professor, Department of East Asian Studies, Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia\n\n\"Armed with a vast expertise in the history of ideas and International Relations, Andreas Fulda has debunked the myth of the impartiality behind the claim of objectivity in academia by calling out some of his peers and putting them in front of their responsibilities as scientists. No, he argues, Human Rights are not negotiable and yes, it is the role of experts to display clear coordinates. It does not make them lesser scientists. Fulda argues that bowing to Chinese coercion is only displaying provocative weakness which in turn invites more aggressive demands by the Chinese Communist Party.\" - Nathalie Vogel, Research Fellow at the Center for Intermarium Studies at the Institute of World Politics in Washington DC.\n\n\"Foreign relations with China are one of Germany's sore spots. Germany is officially committed to democracy and human rights. Yet successive governments have been mostly motivated by economic interests, resulting in increasing entanglement with the Chinese authoritarian regime. Efforts to develop a more principled approach to autocratic China have been unsuccessful. This has resulted in a problematic continuity of German China policy, as Andreas Fulda meticulously shows in his analysis. Hopefully, his book will help break this continuity.\" - Heiner Roetz, Professor Emeritus of Sinology at the University of Bochum\n\n\"Andreas Fulda lays bare the flawed logic that has guided the policies of successive German governments towards China over decades. In the case of Russia, the same approach built around 'change through trade' proved disastrous. It blinded the political and business elites to the real nature of change taking place in Russia and the increasingly aggressive intent of its leadership. A similarly naïve and over-optimistic approach to dealing with China has created a set of serious vulnerabilities for Germany. This book is a wake-up call for German politicians and business leaders who instinctively want to avoid confrontation with China.\" - John Lough, Associate Fellow Russia & Eurasia Programme, Chatham House and author of 'Germany's Russia Problem' (Manchester University Press, 2021).\n\n\"Fulda's book will be particularly useful to those who, like me, have praised Germany's economic prowess without truly grasping the geopolitical compromises that facilitated it. Though it might be an uncomfortable read for those who preside in the corridors of power in Berlin, it contains within it much that could inform policy as Germany assesses the geopolitical landscape. If, as Fulda asserts, Germany's mercantilist China policy prioritised economic gains at the cost of industrial competitiveness and democratic resilience, this book represents a long-overdue reckoning.\" - Martin Thorley, Asia Pacific Senior Analyst for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC). His book, 'All That Glistens: Chinese Party-State Influence in Britain', is published with Hurst\n\n\"Andreas Fulda's new work is brilliantly timed, as Germany - and the wider democratic world - casts around, since the Ukraine invasion, for lessons from their 'rude awakening' from 20 years' mostly unconditional, economically-driven engagement with the totalitarian powers of Russia and China. Based on more than 20 years' interdisciplinary research, Fulda's book seeks to provide not a new theory of international relations but more usefully, analytical tools combining theory and practice. It succinctly proposes replacing Germany's mercantilist China policy - also common worldwide - and its associated, ineffectual, Faustian bargain, with a realistic policy of 'constrainment'.\" - Rowan Callick, who has been China Correspondent for both Australian national newspapers, has written three books on contemporary China, and is an industry fellow at Griffith University's Asia Institute\n\n\"Andreas Fulda's new book explores the legacy of failed assumptions in German China policy and hones in on recent public debates challenging these narratives. Based on the political cybernetics of Karl Deutsch, he frames his research in terms of learning capabilities of the German foreign policy system and process. The failures and timidity of German China policy and the recent progress of the debate are well documented, thoroughly researched, dialogically discussed, and presented in a nuanced way.\" - Horst Fabian, Civil Society Ambassador Europe-China and independent researcher focusing on the linkages between China / Cuba, democratization and sustainable development\n\nHis previous monograph The Struggle for Democracy in Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Sharp Power and its Discontents (Routledge, 2020) has been lauded by esteemed colleagues.\n\n\"Filled with rich theoretical insights and fascinating on-the-ground stories, this wonderfully-written and absorbing book tells the story of how activists in mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong think and strategize-sometimes opportunistically and at other times with deliberate intent-to advance democracy in their respective societies. The result is a compelling analysis of how and why some efforts have succeeded while others have failed, and the lessons future democracy activists should take away from both.\" - Elizabeth Economy, C.V. Starr senior fellow and director for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution\n\n\"Andreas Fulda's book is a powerful longitudinal comparison of three Chinese entities that live under very different political systems, mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and a convincing advocacy for democratization. Fulda well understands the magnitude of the obstacles that so far have prevented the People's Republic from democratizing: the Chinese Communist Party's Soviet or Leninist culture, the economic privileges accumulated by the Party's Nomenklatura and its inclination to rule by bribery and by fear in order to protect them. Nonetheless, Taiwan and Hong Kong's own trajectories and well as the maturation of mainland China's democratic movement over the years have demonstrated that future political change is possible in the People's Republic as well.\" - Jean-Pierre Cabestan, Professor of Political Science, Hong Kong Baptist University\n\n\"In this fresh and courageous book, Fulda pulls at the roots of his subject - democracy in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan - like a gardener tackling a by-now gnarly field, and finds hope, even a plan of action: Fill the gap between theory and practice by learning from Chinese democracy practitioners, plant into democracy theory ideas of change drawn from development studies, cultivate a humanizing pedagogy that rejects domination by propaganda and power, and move away from the internalized compliance with Communist Party discourse that is by now widespread in western academia. An inspiring read packed with ideas.\" - Didi Kirsten Tatlow is a former MERICS Visiting Academic Fellow. She reported from China for her hometown newspaper, the South China Morning Post of Hong Kong, the International Herald Tribune (now the global edition of The New York Times,) and The New York Times, from 2003 to 2017\n\nDr Fulda's edited book Civil Society Contributions to Policy Innovation in the PR China (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015) has been praised by both leading academics and prominent foundation representatives.\n\n\"Emerging out of the EU-China Civil Society Dialogue Programme this book brings together several empirical studies of how civil society organizations contribute to policy change and innovation. The case studies of environmental health and disability groups are particularly illuminating. A fine collection of studies that are an essential read for students of social change in China.\" - Professor Jude Howell, The London School of Economics\n\n\"Civil Society Contributions to Policy Innovations in the PR China is the one and only compass any academic or practitioner will need in order to navigate the sometimes treacherous waters of Chinese civil society with skill and confidence. Dr Andreas Fulda's nuanced and culturally sensitive perspective on Chinese civil society provides an invaluable account of a complex and rapidly changing field.\" - Dr Flora Sapio\n\n\"This book explores the ways in which civil society actors contribute to policy innovation in China. Sector-specific chapters are interspersed with notes from the field adding important nuance. New analyses of the emergence of government procurement of social services and social enterprise contribute to an overall understanding of how civil society is evolving in the Chinese context.\" - Elizabeth D. Knup, Representative/China, The Ford Foundation\n\nIn his published PhD thesis (Springer, 2009) he critiqued Germany's foreign and development policy towards China and examined new approaches for civil society assistance.\n\nIn her book review Professor Bettina Gransow (Free University Berlin) praised Dr Fulda's monograph for \"not only being provocative but also inspiring.\"\n\nThe German Stiftung Asienhaus remarked that \"this book is not only a good read for anyone interested in state- and civil society-led German development cooperation, but also for all those who who deal with the possibilities and limitations of external actors engaging with civil society actors in China.\"\n\nSince 2002 he has extensively published in peer-reviewed academic journals ranging from Diplomacy & Statecraft, PS: Political Science & Politics, International Journal of Human Rights, Journal of Church and State, Journal of Contemporary China, Journal of Current Chinese Affairs, China: An International Journal, Journal of the British Association for Chinese Studies, Critical Asian Studies, International Quarterly for Asian Studies, to ASIEN.\n\nDr Fulda is member of various academic networks and learned societies, e.g. the Citizen Diplomacy Research Group (CDRG), British Association for Chinese Studies (BACS), European Association of Taiwan Studies (EATS), Hong Kong Studies Association (HKSA), and Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Asienkunde (DGA).
