        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n166 9 Charlie Chaplin’s war: a British radical in tumultuous times Richard Carr Foreshadowing the Beatles, during the First World War the actor, director and film impresario Charlie Chaplin would have been justified to claim that he was ‘bigger than Jesus’. This was demonstrably true in Chaplin’s homeland of Great Britain where the wartime cinema going audience of up to 20 million people dwarfed the 2 million or so observant souls then taking Anglican Communion.1 God may not quite have been dead, but people were certainly turning to other, more amusing forms of inspiration during this era of global conflict. As such, just as politicians were wrestling with how far the clamour for democratic reform should be accommodated, a popular class-centric filmmaker like Chaplin was a figure of much discussion in the corridors of power – not least because, his broader implications aside, MPs were often as amused by Chaplin as their constituents. By way of example, in 1915 the Liberal MP Thomas Lough told the House of Commons of a recent trip to the cinema to watch an early comedy: ‘what can be more extraordinary than the film [career] of Charlie Chaplin,’ he noted presaging many such comments, ‘which has turned out to be worth an empire’s ransom.’2 Other politicians, not least the Chancellor of the Exchequer Reginald McKenna, wondered what financial benefits Chaplin’s regular and lucrative outputs could bring to the British Treasury.3 During the war people may have read of the battlefields at home, but they increasingly watched Chaplin on the local cinema screen. All this is not merely interesting trivia. Charlie Chaplin’s Great War has wider significance for two reasons – set out in greater detail in a new biography by the present author, which this article both summarises and extends.4 First, there was the contentious issue that Chaplin did not fight in a conflict in which hundreds of thousands of his countrymen died, and indeed grew staggeringly wealthy while others toiled at the front. His war therefore intersected with high profile debates about conscription, Charlie Chaplin’s war 167 and the appropriate balance between the power of the state and the preservation of individual liberty in times of national emergency. To paraphrase Peter Mandelson in a rather different context, people were not ‘intensely relaxed’ about this South London lad growing ‘filthy rich’ as many of his generation paid the ultimate sacrifice. Chaplin’s lack of uniformed service had a set of consequences this chapter will tease out, and served to cement the man as a ‘political’ figure: a status that would never go away. Through Chaplin we can therefore recapitulate an important set of discussions over life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Second, on a related note, Chaplin’s own weltanschauung was profoundly shaped by the conflict in ways that demand further elucidation. Chaplin was broadly a left-wing thinker sympathetic to schemes to alleviate the plight of the poor. After all, the Little Tramp was a fundamentally sympathetic character whose escapades involved numerous class based undertones – most frequently the notion that he was ‘not good enough’ for the women he pursued. Through Chaplin we can therefore explore cross-class dynamics during the conflict, and the evolution of attitudes towards the poor. The important point is that this evolution was not as linear as we might think. Given his radicalism, one might expect to map Chaplin’s views onto those of the Labour Party – gradually moving towards the idea of the ‘big state’ as the solution for the country’s ills. Most famously, in Clause IV of Labour’s 1918 constitution the party would commit to secure for the workers ‘the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange’. This was taken by some – certainly the party’s opponents – to be promising the nationalisation of vast tranches of the British economy. Thus when Chaplin’s friend Winston Churchill later described him as someone who would make ‘a good Labour Member [of Parliament]’, he had Chaplin’s economics, as well as his opposition to British rule in India, in mind. The future chairman of that party Harold Laski likewise saw Chaplin as essentially a Labour man, as did many. Certainly, the war’s general role in shifting attitudes towards greater state intervention can scarcely be queried. The conflict formed a crucial staging post in W. H. Greenleaf’s Rise of Collectivism; whereby the hivemind of British bureaucracy increasingly conceived replicating itself as the decent, progressive..."
