        "text": "Christmas is my favorite Hoilday. Christmas 2020 was an interesting one. It started a few weeks before when I kept bragging to Jeffrey that I had done a great job at getting him gifts that year that I was winning Christmas this year. A few days before Christmas Jeffrey tells me that we are going to hve to open stocking last. Well I didn't like the thought of that. Tradition is we always opened stocking up first. Well I started getting emotional, I mean how dare he mess with tradition. Fast forward to Christmas day and we open all of our gifts and move on to stocking. We take turns taking a gift out of the stocking and open it. I notice that he is getting to the bottom of his stocking and he is just opening all this gifts and not giving me a chance to open anything.... I only have one gift left. I see him get up and move behind me to throw the trash away . I fight to get the gift out, begin opening it. I see the Kays box and go omg is this my ring (I knew was saving up) I open the box and there is a note that sayws I win. I lift up the paper only to see no ring. I turn to him and he is on one knee with the ring in his hand. I of course said yes.... and also still think I won Christmas that year and all others to follow as I get to be with this wonderful man for the rest of my life."
