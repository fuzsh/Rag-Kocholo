        "text": "Executive Summary\n\nThirty years ago, the British and Irish governments issued the Downing Street Declaration, which asserted that the UK has no “selfish strategic” interest in Northern Ireland. The Declaration was one of the key building blocks in the Northern Ireland peace process, leading to the ceasefire in 1994 with the IRA and, ultimately, the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. As part of the peace process, the UK drew down its remaining active military presence in Northern Ireland, concluding Operation Banner in 2007.\n\nNo ‘selfish strategic’ interest does not, however, mean no ‘strategic’ interest. The political unity of the Union dictates that, by definition, Northern Irish and British strategic interests are one and the same. The UK therefore cannot have selfish interests in Northern Ireland, but its strategic interests are inviolable.\n\nAlthough reducing the Army presence was central to the peace process, it was the closure of RAF and Royal Navy bases – a gradual process initiated after 1945 – which significantly weakened the UK’s strategic position in Northern Ireland. Without a naval and air forward presence to the left of the Irish Sea, the UK’s capacity to police the Western Approaches, and deploy further towards the Greenland- Iceland-UK (GIUK), is limited. This poses direct challenges to the whole British defensive system.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland’s (ROI) avowed neutrality, chronically insufficient Defence Forces, and porous security state render it an unreliable strategic ally. The UK’s northwestern exposure is compounded by the lack of assistance from the ROI. For decades, Irish defence spending has fallen well below 1% of GDP, producing a Defence Forces which is under-equipped, under-sized and under-staffed. In any case, commitment to its policy of neutrality precludes the ROI from engaging seriously with the UK on security issues, either bilaterally or as part of NATO.\n\nIn an age of growing geopolitical threats, this gap in the UK’s northwestern defences now directly endangers its national security. Negotiated amidst intractable political violence in Ireland, and in the post-Cold War period of relative peace, the full implications of the military draw-down in Northern Ireland were concealed. The return of an aggressive Russia, actively waging war in Europe, has placed renewed strategic importance on the UK’s north and northwestern flanks.\n\nAs Russia’s maritime doctrine shifted in 2022 to prioritise the Arctic and Atlantic, it is incumbent upon the UK to fortify its northwestern naval and air patrol presence. Major transatlantic undersea fibre-optic cables run through the Western Approaches, upon which the digital security of the UK and its partners – including the ROI – depend. Meanwhile, Russia has advanced its sub-surface capabilities and – as the recent uptick in reported sightings illustrates – is exploring ways to target western critical undersea infrastructure around the UK, and further north. To coordinate our collective response with our partners, we must respond in turn with a greater Royal Navy and RAF presence in the region.\n\nAs well as proving a menace in the maritime domain, Russia – alongside China and Iran – seeks to degrade the UK and its allies through unconventional means. Cyber warfare, institutional espionage, and educational and economic infiltration are all subthreshold methods employed by these authoritarian regimes to destabilise the West.\n\nThe combination of ROI’s flimsy security and intelligence apparatus, unwillingness to acknowledge these threats, and soft border with Northern Ireland poses a grave back-door security risk to the UK. Adversaries are certain to target the ROI, due to its close integration into transatlantic economic and digital systems, membership of the EU, and self-imposed exclusion from multilateral security frameworks. There is already strong evidence of a subversive and illegal Russian, Chinese and Iranian presence across Irish society and sensitive institutions.\n\nAlthough the ROI has embarked on a reform of its Defence Forces and security apparatus in recent years, the outcome is destined to fall short of requirements, due to a persistent lack of financial and political commitment. The entire Defence Forces, and security and intelligence apparatus, is being built almost from scratch. With defence spending to increase by only 50% by 2028, and the stubborn shibboleth of neutrality still acting as a brake on ambition, the ROI is not set to become a capable security partner any time soon.\n\nAs it stands, Sinn Féin is expected to win the ROI’s next election in 2025, a party which will be no friend to British interests. Sinn Féin’s long history of Anglophobia, and conflict with the British state and security services – as well as its opposition to NATO, Russian sympathies, and general anti-Western sympathies – will obstruct any meaningful recalibration of security arrangements with the UK. If Sinn Féin wins in 2025, the UK is therefore looking at many more years of an uncooperative, and likely hostile, neighbour in the face of growing external threats.\n\nNorthern Ireland is therefore the key to addressing the UK’s security concerns. Resurrecting the RAF and Royal Navy presence in Northern Ireland will bolster our forward presence for maritime patrol operations around our coastline, as well as into the GIUK Gap and beyond. In light of Russian aggression, recent government strategic documents have flagged our stretched naval and air capabilities in the north. Northern Ireland can therefore strengthen our strategic options in the region, whilst alleviating the burden on other bases, such as HMNB Clyde and RAF Lossiemouth.\n\nShifting the paradigm of British-Irish relations – by breaking the longstanding link between a British Northern Ireland military presence, and Ireland’s historically fraught past – will enable the UK to create the environment for an equitable and effective security relationship between the ROI and the UK. The ROI is at severe risk of being compromised from within by hostile actors, perils which were illustrated by the massive Russian cyber-attack on the Irish health service in 2021. Geographical proximity, and the soft border, mean that Irish vulnerabilities are British vulnerabilities. Having signalled its renewed strategic focus on Northern Ireland, the UK can make known its interests – and willingness to assist, in an equitable manner – in the ROI’s security problems.\n\nNext chapter\n\nForeword\n\nBy Rt Hon Sir Michael Fallon KCB, former UK Secretary of State for Defence, and Rt Hon Lord Robertson of Port Ellen KT, former Secretary General of NATO and former Secretary of State for Defence\n\nPolicy Exchange has a record of bringing neglected topics of national importance to the fore. British-Irish security is one such issue.\n\nAs Defence Secretaries in different governments at different times, we know that little attention was paid to the security of the island of Ireland in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War.\n\nWe therefore welcome this new report from Policy Exchange, which powerfully reasserts the strategic importance of Ireland, and especially Northern Ireland, to the UK’s national security.\n\nRe-setting the importance of the Western Approaches is all the more urgent in the sharpening Euro-Atlantic geopolitical climate. Russia poses an acute maritime menace to both our countries as it targets the undersea fibre-optic cables, pipelines and interconnectors which underpin our critical digital and energy systems.\n\nRussian intelligence ships and warships have been identified off the Irish coast and close to key transatlantic cables. The growing Russian, Iranian and Chinese presence in the Republic poses a backdoor threat to the United Kingdom itself.\n\nEuropean security is also vulnerable. Threequarters of the most critical Atlantic cables pass through or close to Ireland’s borders; the Republic hosts a third of Europe’s data companies. As an EU member and a hub of the international financial and technology sectors Ireland is an attractive target for those who might want to attack our economic and political systems: already we have seen cyber and pipeline attacks in the Baltic and on Europe’s eastern frontier.\n\nIreland is now finally reviewing its defence posture. Sweden and Finland have already decided that neutrality is no longer sustainable against Russian aggression.\n\nThe Republic plays very little part in European defence co-operation; its forces, especially maritime, need rapid strengthening to be capable of defending against today’s threats.\n\nThe UK should certainly encourage this, building on the initial UK-Ireland Defence Agreement signed in 2015. But the current threats to our own security are growing and urgent. What the government should do immediately is to rediscover the vital strategic importance of Northern Ireland, and fortify this weak spot in our own security.\n\nNext chapter\n\nIntroduction\n\nThirty years ago, the British and Irish governments issued the Downing Street Declaration. In the Declaration, then Prime Minister John Major asserted that the British government has “no selfish strategic” interest in Northern Ireland, an excerpt borrowed from a speech made in 1990 by Northern Ireland Secretary, Peter Brooke. Over the ensuing years, the UK acted accordingly, finalising the military withdrawal from Northern Ireland by 2007. The UK was eventually left with its smallest military force on the island of Ireland in modern history. The Declaration laid the groundwork for the Good Friday Agreement five years later, bringing to an end the bloody 30-year period of the Troubles. Few would argue that this was an unworthy cause.\n\nIn many ways, the Declaration was a masterful example of strategic ambiguity, designed so as simultaneously to attenuate nationalist concerns over British imperialistic motivations in Northern Ireland, and to enshrine the political unity of the UK.\n\nHowever, the British military draw-down which ensued was in fact based on a fundamental misinterpretation of the Declaration. Grammar matters after all, even down to a comma. No selfish strategic interest does not mean no strategic interest. In fact, the UK quite obviously has a strategic interest in Northern Ireland by territorial definition, and per the contours of geopolitical rivalry.\n\nThat these interests are unselfish speaks to the essence of the Union – that the interests of the island of Great Britain and the territories of Northern Ireland are indissolubly intertwined. Furthermore, as has been demonstrated throughout the course of history, the security of the British Isles as a whole converges in the face of external threats. Thus – whether through lack of attention to detail, or the desire to bring an end to political unrest despite long term costs – the total withdrawal of our strategic forward presence on the western side of the Irish sea has weakened the Union strategically and politically.\n\nWhilst the peaceful post-Cold War years hid the implications of this decision, the return of major conflict to Europe has unearthed the deteriorating security environment the UK now faces. Two factors interact to generate this environment: a neighbour in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) which is uncooperative from a security perspective towards the Union and its partners; and the lack of British forward presence in Northern Ireland, which would otherwise go some ways towards compensating for Irish intransigence. Today, Russia’s war on Ukraine, China’s determination to challenge the US-led world order, and subversive Iranian activity across Europe all combine to form the most serious threat landscape that the UK has faced since 1991 at least. In this context, the island of Ireland constitutes the weak spot of British national security. This paper argues that only a paradigm shift in security arrangements on the island of Ireland can remedy this situation.\n\nThe ROI has consistently refused to contribute sufficiently to the collective security it shares with its partners. Despite the ROI’s crucial position at the transatlantic gateway to Europe, persistent under-investment in the military and security instruments has left it unable to protect itself at sea, by air, and from cyber and subversive infiltration. Whilst the UK and the ROI both play crucial roles in the flow of goods, capital and digital information which powers western prosperity and security in the 21st century, the contrast in their respective commitment to defending these systems is stark.\n\nPartly as a response to the new geopolitical environment, the ROI has embarked upon a reform of its military and security apparatus. By 2028, the government aims to restructure and bolster the Irish Defence Forces and security apparatus to respond better to the full array of the modern threat landscape. As part of the process, defence spending is on a slow trajectory towards a 50% increase between 2022 and 2028.\n\nHowever, the task of building a national security system from near-scratch, paired with budgetary constraints and a political culture fundamentally opposed to serious strategic thought, breeds pessimism regarding the prospects of enhanced ROI security any time soon. As a result, it will continue to be a critical weak point across the Atlantic and within Europe. With polls predicting a Sinn Féin victory in the next general election, Irish security engagement with the UK and transatlantic alliance is likely to be jeopardised until the end of the decade. Sinn Féin’s enduring Anglophobia, and ambivalence towards transatlantic and European security, means that an Irish government it leads will be no friend to British strategic interests.\n\nThis paper therefore calls upon the UK to rediscover its strategic interests in Northern Ireland, in order to improve the untenable security situation on our northwestern flank. As it stands, the ROI displays sheer ambivalence towards its own security, and that of its partners. The inadequacy of the Irish Naval Service and Air Corps jeopardises the security of the Western Approaches to the British Isles, just when Russia has recalibrated its strategic doctrine and maritime capabilities to target our northern flank. Transatlantic undersea fibre-optic cables and European undersea energy infrastructure – so crucial to our collective prosperity and security – also traverse this maritime region, recreating its critical strategic importance of the 20th century. As long as the ROI cannot contribute to the defence of this zone, the UK must take this responsibility upon itself for its own security. This requires us to resurrect our naval and air forward presence in Northern Ireland.\n\nMeanwhile, the ROI’s security porousness – and soft border separating it from British territories – opens the UK up to hostile subversion through the back-door. As long as the ROI has almost no cyber resilience nor robust counterintelligence apparatus to speak of, its systemic importance to the global economic order, and direct link to the UK, will remain an enormous liability. Institutional and societal penetration in the ROI by hostile states is also probable, given its weak security state and close transatlantic and European ties. Whilst the UK cannot solve these chronic internal issues on the ROI’s behalf, the seismic shock caused by shifting Northern Irish policy should impress upon Dublin that the UK will no longer tread with caution around issues affecting its national security. Afterwards, forceful British diplomatic efforts should prompt the ROI to begin contributing its fair share to the preservation of the order which benefits us all.\n\nChapter I presents the history of the strategic relationship of the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, in order to reveal how external aggressors have always attempted to undermine the former through the latter. As Irish nationalism gathered momentum, eventually culminating in independence, Ireland’s global posture has consistently been informed by its desire to distance itself from the UK.\n\nChapter II analyses the contemporary strategic landscape facing the UK and the ROI. It is demonstrated that the ROI is an open target for attempts by Russia, China and Iran to subvert the transatlantic-European global system. The ROI’s vulnerabilities directly affect British security, as geographical proximity means that hostile intrusion into one’s sea and air space is a mutual danger. Equally, close bilateral economic and political ties ensure that cyber-attacks and espionage on one may compromise the security of the other.\n\nChapter III portrays the extent of the ROI’s historical and contemporary unreliability as a security partner. A selectively interpreted neutrality policy, woeful military and state security apparatus – the result of decades of under-investment – and the looming spectre of a Sinn Féin government next year all merge to constitute an entirely deficient partner in the face of modern threats.\n\nFinally, Chapter IV proposes a roadmap for resurrecting the UK’s strategic presence in Northern Ireland. The Russian menace demands the restoration of a Northern Irish forward deployment platform near the Western Approaches and oceanic peripheries (west to the Greenland-Iceland-UK [GIUK] Gap, and north towards the High North). The UK’s diplomatic engagement with Ireland must resolutely maintain the position that such actions fall within the boundaries of the Downing Street Declaration, and are necessitated by the ROI’s inaction.\n\nIt is high time for the UK to acknowledge that the security arrangement on the island of Ireland runs counter to its interests. The Republic of Ireland is simply not a reliable partner in the current geopolitical environment, which places renewed importance on Northern Ireland’s role in British defence. By breaking the longstanding linkage between a British military presence in Northern Ireland, and fraught historical tensions, the UK would signal to the ROI that it will no longer shy away from the measures necessary to protect its national security. The longer term goal will be to create the environment for formulating a stronger, more equitable British-Irish security relationship, which is based on rational strategic interests, rather than deep-rooted political tensions.\n\nIn a clear example of Churchill’s dictum that, “at the summit, true strategy and politics are one”, preserving the strategic unity of the Union is an inextricable component of British grand strategy. In doing so, the strategic indivisibility of Great Britain and Northern Ireland – which, despite subsequent interpretations, the Downing Street Declaration did enshrine – must be rediscovered.\n\nNext chapter\n\nChapter I: The Historical Basis of a Troubled British-Irish Strategic Relationship\n\n1.1: Introduction\n\nHistory demonstrates the fundamental importance of a strategic presence on the island of Ireland to British – and Irish – security throughout any period of geopolitical disruption. In fact, the two islands’ security conditions have aligned so closely in the face of external threats that the strategic reality can be characterised as one of British-Irish interconnectedness, despite political friction and contemporary and historical ROI intransigence. As Irish nationalism emerged towards the end of the 18th century, calls for an independent political space, based on a distinct Irish character, began to strain this British-Irish strategic unity. In the end, political imperatives triumphed over strategic ones in 1938, when the UK forfeited its key naval bases on Ireland. This mistake – which could have cost the Allies victory in the Second World War – was only atoned for by the establishment of a strong naval and air presence in Northern Ireland.\n\nThroughout the Cold War, the ROI’s continual desire to distinguish itself politically and strategically from the UK spilled over into its relationship with NATO, creating a gap in the Atlantic Alliance for Soviet exploitation. Again, the UK compensated for the Free Irish State’s strategic intransigence by building up its military presence in Northern Ireland. The underlying contradiction between strategy and politics reached its culmination point with the Troubles, however, which finally led the UK to withdraw its remaining active military presence on Ireland. As the modern geopolitical situation deteriorates, the untenable nature of the UK’s strategic position – lacking a forward presence in Northern Ireland to compensate for an uncooperative and poorly-equipped Ireland – has been laid bare.\n\n1.2: The British-Irish Strategic Relationship – Historical Foundations\n\nThe indivisible histories of the people of Great Britain and Ireland The close cultural, political, economic and social ties between the people of Great Britain and Ireland have extremely deep roots. Indeed, the histories of the two islands are so intertwined as to be inseparable.\n\nWhilst Ireland has been of crucial strategic importance to Britain since the 16th century, mercantile contact between the two islands long predates that. In early history, coastal settlements were by far the most viable locations for major human population centres, since maritime trade was of much greater efficiency than any land-based alternative. This generated extensive cultural, economic, political, and strategic contact – both competitive and violent, and mutually beneficial – from the 11th century onwards. The Anglo-Norman Invasion of Ireland combined with longstanding economic contact between Great Britain and Ulster, Leinster, and Munster, to link British and Irish political fortunes closely.\n\nClose people-to-people relations ensured that the Irish featured in all of the major developmental phases of British modern history. Ireland contributed Jonathan Swift, Edmund Burke and George Berkeley to the English Enlightenment; Samuel Greg – pioneer of the factory system – to the Industrial Revolution; and over 100,000 Irish men and women served in the British Army during the Second World War. The insoluble links between the two islands were always clearly understood.\n\nIn the 1790s, Irish nationalism emerged with the founding of the Society of United Irishmen, which took inspiration from the tenets of the French Revolution. Irish nationalism was therefore preconditioned on the rise of other nationalist movements in the modern era, rather than any unified identity distinct from Great Britain in historical, cultural, economic or political terms. Instead, much like in Great Britain and feudal Europe, the origins of an Irish polity are found in the shifting alliances between local lords competing for territories and resources. Indeed, although there is no natural geographical demarcation line between different parts of Ireland, the island itself has always been fragmented along distinct cultural and social lines. Maritime contact between the Irish east coast and the British west coast both fostered close cultural and social ties between these opposing sides of the Irish Sea, and reinforced the cultural divisions between southwestern, eastern, and northeastern Ireland. This complex history partly explains the difference in affinity felt by the Irish towards the Union, a contributing factor to the politically febrile period running from 1790 until the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.\n\nThroughout the course of modern history, external rivals sought to activate Ireland as a strategic pressure point against England. Ireland presented a potential launchpad for any invasion of Britain, considering the relative ease of access an invasion force has to the British west coast through the Irish Sea, despite its notoriously choppy waters. As international trade expanded and the power of the modern state developed, the role of Ireland in the British Isles’ defence system became readily apparent.\n\nDuring the Wars of the Spanish and Austrian Succession, France sponsored anti-English political coalitions in Ireland, while the Jacobites attempted two more uprisings – in 1715 and 1745 – which received support from Irish Catholic aristocrats. France again turned to Ireland as a lever against British power in 1796-1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars. The French Directory executed two invasion attempts, hoping to land a sizeable invasion force in Ireland that would at minimum tie down British resources and divert attention from the Continent, and at best enable an invasion of England.\n\nAlthough both French invasion attempts failed, the shifting European strategic situation necessitated a wholesale re-evaluation of British-Irish political relations. The 1800 Acts of Union, which created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland as a modern political entity, were meant to formalise Ireland’s political linkages to Great Britain, thereby solidifying the strategic unity of the British Isles against a persistent, expanding Continental threat. The result was a state, recognisable today, with a distinctly multinational character. Although the Acts of Union ameliorated potential political disruption, the strategic situation nevertheless necessitated a comprehensive defence network that included Ireland, which the UK built out over the next half-decade, until Nelson’s victory at Trafalgar broke French naval power and reduced the odds of an invasion.\n\nPost-Napoleonic Britain, until the mid-19th century, was in an extraordinarily secure strategic position. The Congress of Vienna had created a reasonably stable balance of power between the major Continental actors, while also providing conservative forces in Europe an incentive to avoid war, and by extension war’s domestic stresses, in light of the growth of liberalism. The British strategic picture rested upon one core proposition: the identity of European littoral sea control and global sea control. There was no power beyond Europe, whether in Eurasia or the Americas, that could legitimately challenge British naval dominance. Moreover, the UK held a number of crucial naval installations in the Mediterranean that, when coupled with British bases in the Channel and on the Irish coast, ensured British control of the European littoral.\n\nThe Irish role in the balance of power established by the Concert of Europe is poorly appreciated historically. The Channel prevented the Russian Navy’s from breaking out into the open ocean from its Baltic base, thereby necessitating that Russia maintain cordial relations with the UK, or risk economic collapse and invasion – threat the UK nearly made good on during the Crimean War. However, France’s long Atlantic coastline provided ample trade nodes and naval basing for a French fleet beyond the English Channel. By operating naval forces from the Irish southern and western coasts, the Royal Navy could ensure its ability to blockade all French trade during wartime, thereby reducing the likelihood of Anglo-French enmity through a coherent strategic threat.\n\nAs French ambitions for European dominance re-emerged, France once again attempted to compromise the UK’s strategic position via Ireland. France sought to instigate a subversion campaign during periods of renewed tension with the UK in the late 1800s. Moreover, the rise of steam propulsion and concurrent advances in naval technology reinforced the need for access to Irish naval bases, since modern steam-powered warships, despite their speed advantage over tall ships, had to remain close to coaling stations during combat operations. The Irish coast provided an ideal set of bases for British naval operations in the north-eastern Atlantic, thereby defending British trade and serving homeland defence.\n\nNevertheless, continued tension between the strategic British-Irish relationship and the political character of Ireland threatened to undermine the British Isles’ defence system – upon which Ireland’s external security rested as much as any other UK constituent nation. The strategic goal of Home Rule, from the viewpoint of homeland defence and geostrategy, was to placate growing Irish desires for a distinct political and cultural character, whilst maintaining the UK’s ability to include Ireland in its strategic posture. However, the long-term political effect of Home Rule was to fuel Irish nationalism. This continued tension would eventually push the strategic relationship between the UK and Ireland to breaking point, with deleterious consequences during the World Wars and Cold War.\n\n1.3: The British-Irish Strategic Relationship – 20th Century Disruptions\n\nPrior to the First World War, Ireland was central to British defence planning. Ireland had its own Irish Command Scheme, which was plugged into the UK’s Home Defence strategic framework. The Irish component of British Home Defence was founded upon three ports – Spike Island and Berehaven in the south, and Lough Swilly in the north – which were integrated into a UK-wide coastal defence system.\n\nThe UK’s three Irish Treaty ports. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_Ports_%28Ireland%29\n\nDuring the First World War, British strategy was centred upon the blockade of Germany, considering the Kaiserreich’s inability, in light of its geographical position, to access the open ocean and engage in international trade. Initial British policy rested upon the misguided view that Germany would unravel rapidly due to the commercial and financial disruption of the British blockade, leading to a rapid Allied victory. This viewpoint was far from the mark, but the British blockade remained central to Allied strategy. The ability to defend and deploy from the three Irish ports was central to this strategy.\n\nAlthough it took longer than anticipated, the British blockade became the most effective weapon against the Central Powers, because it could slowly but surely grind down German war-making capacity by starving it of resources. Berlin never overcame this problem. It sought to break British naval power by drawing the Royal Navy into a naval battle on favourable conditions multiple times. But the only time the Grand Fleet and High Seas Fleet engaged in combat, at Jutland in 1916, the Germans took enormous damage – less than the British received, but far more in relative terms for a smaller Navy less capable of repairs.\n\nGermany’s ultimate response was the initiation of unrestricted submarine warfare, which ultimately birthed the Anglo-American Special Relationship. British-American cooperation was founded upon the issue of Irish defence, once the US had entered the war in 1917 following German commercial pressure. US destroyers based in Ireland helped police the Western Approaches, serving in a truly integrated command, which along with the convoy system helped master the U-Boat threat by 1918. Absent a unified British-Irish strategic space, the U-Boat campaign may well have succeeded in crippling the UK and forcing London out of the war, as it would have left it incapable of defending the Western Approaches. Clearly, the UK’s strategic position in Ireland was a crucial element of its broader defence system.\n\nThe Western Approaches to the British Isles\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Approaches\n\nThe Western Approaches refer to the oceanic entry paths from the Eastern Atlantic into the British Isles. Their strategic importance is perennial: they are integral to Britain’s sea lines of communication, transatlantic maritime pathways, and northward deployment into the GIUK Gap and beyond. Today, major undersea cables run along the seabed, carrying digital data across the Atlantic.\n\nAs an island nation, the sea has always mattered to Britain. Indeed, naval historian and doyen of maritime strategy, Halford Mackinder, understood better than anyone the function that sea power plays in British grand strategy, and consequently, its sustained prosperity. Through the lens of his geopolitical analysis, the Western Approaches are one of three vital maritime components of the British Isles. The ability to control these regions, he argued, determined the strength of Britain’s strategic position. Indeed, throughout history, the Western Approaches have always been essential to Britain’s ability to assert sea control and sea denial around its shores, and further west into the Atlantic.\n\nViewed in this framework, Ireland’s oceanic exposure – as the first land mass reached from the Atlantic – and proximity to Great Britain, accounts for its strategic inseparability from the whole British Isles. It is via the Irish Sea that the Great British midriff plugs into the Atlantic, north-westerly via the North Channel, and south-westerly via St George’s Channel.\n\nAs this chapter shows, whenever threatened externally, Britain’s security – and indeed that of Ireland –has always rested on its ability to control and deploy in the waters around Ireland. Thus, in the words of the Royal Navy’s Director of Naval Intelligence in 1932, “Ireland is a vital part of our home defences”. With no naval base in Northern Ireland, and a ROI with no serious navy to speak of, the UK’s homeland defence is severely weakened around the Western Approaches today.\n\nUnsurprisingly, like all of the UK’s Continental adversaries, Germany sought to reactivate the Irish problem for the UK. German intelligence had extensive contacts with the Irish Republican movement, and was a supporter of the Easter Rising. Although the Rising failed to eject British forces from Ireland or tie down significant numbers of British troops, it nevertheless demonstrated the chronic vulnerability the Irish political situation posed to UK strategy and the defence of the British Isles.\n\nThe Interwar Period was defined by an unravelling of British strategy towards Ireland, with dangerous consequences once the Nazi threat matured. After 1919, British defence planning rested upon the Ten-Year Rule, the assumption that no major threat would emerge and cause a great power struggle for the next decade. Nevertheless, the British-Irish War of 1919-1921, combined with the memory of German disruption in Ireland and the U-Boat threat, impressed upon British strategists the need to maintain some strategic coherence in the British homeland defence system, even absent British-Irish political unit. Like Irish Home Rule, the Irish Free State was constructed as a compromise measure, acquiescing to Irish nationalistic calls for an independent political identity, while preserving a military presence on the island, which was critical to the security of the UK. Northern Ireland therefore remained an indivisible part of the Union for cultural and economic reasons, but also for strategic motivations, since it provided the UK direct access to some basing in Ireland, despite revised political arrangements. Indeed, it is here that Northern Ireland’s unique strategic importance emerges: absent guaranteed access to all of Ireland, the UK required some unrestricted access to meet basic strategic needs for homeland defence.\n\nThe most critical element of the independence negotiations was the Treaty Ports system, under which the UK retained control over its three Irish deep-water ports: Berehaven, Spike Island and Lough Swilly. British negotiators insisted upon the Treaty Ports for strategic reasons throughout the negotiations, despite periods of Irish intransigence. The Treaty Ports were as relevant to the Irish Free State as to the UK; absent integration into the British defence system, the newly-independent Irish Free State would be unable to defend itself against any predatory European power.\n\nHowever, British strategic myopia and continual political tensions with the Irish Free State eventually led to the unravelling of this arrangement by 1938. After the First World War, British defence planning fragmented, as each military service pursued an independent strategic policy. The result of this inter-service competition for funding was ultimately a diminished naval presence on Ireland.\n\nMoreover, in the early-1930s, Irish politics took a distinctly Anglophobic turn with the accession of Eamon de Valera to the Irish premiership. De Valera rapidly revised the British-Irish relationship, abrogating or violating multiple clauses in the 1921 British-Irish Treaty. He then initiated an enormously self-damaging trade war against the UK, hoping to industrialise Ireland. However, during negotiations to end the trade war in 1938, diplomatic pressure led the UK to consent to surrendering the Treaty Ports in order to settle the economic dispute. Given the lopsided damage Ireland incurred through the trade war, sacrificing the ports amounted to an enormous strategic miscalculation by the British. For the first time in modern history, the UK had abdicated its ability to maintain security in the Western Approaches.\n\nThe implications of this decision became clear only two years later, when the UK found itself alone against a Europe under near-total German domination. With the Fall of France, German U-Boats gained direct access to the Atlantic, and thereby could pressure the Western Approaches, jeopardising British supplies. During the First Happy Time, in the second half of 1940, German U-Boats sank nearly 1.5 million tons of supplies carried by 282 merchant ships. Combined with the German air assault on the UK, and obvious preparations for cross-channel invasion, the British strategic situation seemed increasingly dire.\n\nHad the UK retained access to the Treaty Ports, it could have deployed Royal Navy destroyers to Ireland. These would have been able to screen convoys in the Western Approaches, particularly if the UK had also built out airfields in each Treaty Port. In the event, the UK struggled to implement a coherent system of trade protection, even with the reinstitution of convoys. London repeatedly petitioned Dublin to abandon neutrality and, at the least, accept British redeployment to the Treaty Ports. De Valera refused, privately stating that he was convinced of German ascendance. In the event, the UK had to expend enormous resources building out air and naval bases in Northern Ireland, while rerouting convoys away from the Western Approaches farther north. Had the UK not preserved Northern Ireland’s place in the Union, there would have been no practicable mechanism for the protection of the Western Approaches.\n\nAs with the First World War, American assistance in fortifying naval bases on Ireland came to the UK’s rescue. In a move which would prove decisive in the Battle of the Atlantic, the US clandestinely deployed several hundred “advisors” to HMS Ferret, the British shore establishment at its new naval base at Londonderry, Northern Ireland. The UK ultimately survived the U-Boat threat with an empowered Coastal Command, and enormous expenditure into developing maritime patrol and convoy escorting capabilities at and around Londonderry, enabling its forces eventually to cover the “Mid-Atlantic Gap”. It was only due to American resources and British-American ingenuity that American supplies, and later, American ground forces, reached the UK for the Liberation of France. Indeed, the Anglo-American Special Relationship was again founded upon cooperation in Northern Ireland, necessitated by Dublin’s political hostility to London.\n\nThroughout the war, German intelligence assessments indicate that Berlin was well aware of the stresses Irish neutrality caused to the Allies. Even once the U-Boat threat was mastered, the Irish coastal “dead zone”, as German analysts termed it, restricted Allied strategic options. Allied intelligence officers, meanwhile, were extraordinarily nervous that well-established German intelligence activity in Ireland would tip off the Wehrmacht as to Operation OVERLORD’s objective of landing at the Normandy beaches. Indeed, this was far from paranoia, for the Irish handed critical intelligence to Germany before the Allied assault on Arnhem, allowing the Germans to pre-empt, and ultimately withstand, the attack.\n\nThe above demonstrates just how critical sustaining a military presence on Ireland, and particularly in Northern Ireland, is for the UK’s security in the face of external threats. Major-power conflict is always a close-run thing. Had the UK not been quite as adaptable, and had the US not been capable of applying its full industrial capabilities against the German threat, the vulnerability of the Western Approaches may well have knocked the UK out of the war. Military presence near the Western Approaches was therefore the understated lynchpin of Allied strategy in the Second World War – just as in the First – without which Germany might well have won.\n\n1.4: The Strategic Problem from the Cold War Until Today\n\nThe British-Irish strategic relationship, which after 1937 became the UK-ROI strategic relationship, evolved following the end of the Second World War, but its baseline characteristics, and the strategic difficulties which defined it, remained largely identical. This further attenuated the strategic element of Unionism, despite its burial in the historical record.\n\nThroughout the Cold War, the ROI occupied a curious position. The UK and US both immediately invited the ROI to join NATO upon its founding in 1949. This was spurred as the Western Approaches question remained extremely live in the aftermath of the Second World War for two reasons. Firstly, any NATO defence strategy would involve an enormous amount of follow-on forces transiting to Europe to counter a Soviet offensive, passing through the Western Approaches for a combat power build in the UK and, if possible, France. Secondly, the proliferation of strategic bombers and nuclear weapons raised the risk of a Soviet attack following that same route.\n\nHowever, due to its policy of neutrality – codified in the 1937 Constitution – the ROI neither joined NATO nor permitted a major NATO presence, despite its ideal positioning as the backstop to a broader European defence system. Throughout the Cold War, Ireland consented to NATO accession only if Northern Ireland joined the Republic. The issue was, Ireland would provide no prior guarantees of either NATO membership or NATO access before this point. Hence the UK, and by extension the US, had no incentive to encourage serious talks on Irish unification, and thereby surrender NATO’s last remaining potential basing locations in Ireland, at the cost of breaking the Union. Moreover, even if the ROI joined NATO, there was almost no likelihood that it would abide by its 2% of GDP defence spending threshold, which would therefore necessitate even more Allied assets to secure its air and maritime space.\n\nFrom the late 1940s to the early 1970s, the UK therefore met its strategic requirements in Ireland by maintain its air and naval bases, and developing an early warning build-up in Northern Ireland. Londonderry remained the primary naval and air deployment base for Allied defence in the Greenland-Iceland-UK Gap (GIUK Gap). RAF Bishopscourt, established in 1943, became the base for the transatlantic military radar system, critical to UK and allied nuclear early warning on its northwestern flank. The British government therefore attempted to maintain its military presence in Northern Ireland – so critical to transatlantic air and maritime defence – in a manner which did not exacerbate political tensions with the ROI.\n\nHowever, with the emergence of Irish paramilitary violence against British police and military personnel in Northern Ireland, this compromise strategic relationship became untenable. With the start of the Troubles in 1969, the political relationship between the ROI and the UK deteriorated rapidly. In response, the British Armed Forces launched Operation Banner in Northern Ireland. Operating from 1969 until 2007, with over 300,000 soldiers seeing service, Operation Banner holds the record for the UK’s longest continuous deployment.\n\nThus, just as the UK entered a prolonged period of economic malaise, and was reducing its defence commitments around the world, the Army became embroiled in counterinsurgency in Northern Ireland. As Operation Banner was getting underway, the UK finally drew down all deployments East of Suez, fully handing over Middle Eastern strategic responsibilities to the US in 1971. It also greatly curtailed its military presence in the Mediterranean, restricting itself to a ground-centric mission in central Europe.\n\nDriven by these economic factors, and the mounting pressure against its military presence in Northern Ireland, the UK began to close bases deemed unessential to maintaining stability. It was thus mostly naval and air bases which were shut down: Londonderry in 1970, RAF Ballykelly in 1971, and Bishopscourt by 1992. With the closure of these facilities, this was the first time since the 17th century that the UK was left without a military presence on its Irish maritime flank. As the Troubles escalated, Northern Ireland became a mission exclusively for the Army, while an understanding of Ireland’s role in British and Allied strategic defence receded from view. Thus, even though it was the Army’s presence which would be treated officially in the Good Friday Agreement, the RAF and Royal Navy’s presence in Northern Ireland – which long predated the Troubles – was a secondary casualty.\n\nThe official reasons given for this naval and air draw-down appear intentionally muddied. The UK and NATO justified the closure of Bishopscourt on the grounds that new, longer-range radar technology removed the need for a station in Northern Ireland. However, other diplomatic and military officials at the time explained the closures as an olive branch to Sinn Féin in order to quell unrest. An unnamed official from the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs argued that the closure of Bishopscourt “was important to reassure Sinn Féin who had always assumed that this was the reason why Britain was still in Ireland”, demonstrating again Sinn Fein’s fundamental misunderstanding of British strategic interests. Meanwhile, the last captain of Sea Eagle at Londonderry, Admiral Sir Antony Morton, stated that the start of the Troubles “created a pressure that made it impossible to sustain an international allied training centre… in Londonderry”.\n\nThe Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, and subsequent period of the Cold War Peace Dividend, concealed the strategic implications of the UK’s military draw-down in Northern Ireland. As a result, the strategic imperative to British and transatlantic security of maintaining an Irish presence played second fiddle to desires to end the violence in Northern Ireland. Central to the ultimate resolution of the Troubles through the Good Friday Agreement, the Downing Street Declaration of 1993 stated that the UK has “no selfish strategic” interest in Irish affairs. As has been demonstrated, construing this as a rejection of any British interests in Northern Ireland pays no regard to the vital role played by Irish military bases throughout British modern history – nor to the indivisible unity of the Union.\n\nThe upshot of the troubled strategic relationship between the UK and ROI is that any security alignment has been disavowed. Neither has the means to satisfactorily police the Western Approaches and Eastern Atlantic – the UK due to its lack of military presence, the ROI due to the chronic deficiencies of its Defence Forces, and political comfort with depending on the security umbrella provided by others. With the return of Russia as a direct threat to European and transatlantic security, there is a real prospect that the dormant risks, engendered by the strategic myopia exhibited by the UK from the 1970s onwards, will finally emerge to endanger our national security.\n\nNext chapter\n\nIreland Chapter II: The Current Threat Landscape\n\n2.1: Introduction\n\nAs shown, the ability to deploy and surveil the Western Approaches and Eastern Atlantic has been fundamental to the UK’s enduring security. Although the period of relative geopolitical peace between 1991 and 2021 obfuscated the implications of surrendering the Northern Irish bases, a resurgent Russian threat to Europe and the transatlantic alliance leaves the UK exposed to the fruits of its strategic negligence. In an era when technological advance provides hostile actors sophisticated means of waging unconventional warfare, the threat landscape has deteriorated significantly since the Cold War. Russia now possesses the means and intent to launch physical and cyber-attacks on the critical undersea infrastructure which connects our digital and energy systems to our surrounding partners. This places renewed importance on the UK’s ability to police its territorial waters, and to work with its allies towards wider defence around the North and Baltic Sea, the GIUK Gap and, increasingly, the High North.\n\nMeanwhile, alongside Russia, China and Iran are also engaging in cyber and espionage tactics with the strategic objective of disrupting the informational, digital and financial systems upon which Europe and the transatlantic alliance rely. Whilst all countries struggle to build the necessary resilience into their cyberspace and intelligence networks, the ROI’s chronic deficiencies in these domains (Chapter III) single it out as the weak link in transatlantic-European systems.\n\nIn light of these multi-fronted assaults on Western security and prosperity, the UK must rediscover the fundamental role that Northern Ireland plays in its grand strategy. This chapter presents the threat landscape facing the UK, assesses the strategic ambitions and operational methodology of the three authoritarian aggressors, and exposes the extent to which the ROI’s chronic blindness towards its own security, and continuous hostility towards its only rational security allies, endangers that of its partners.\n\n2.2: The British Isles within Eurasian Competition\n\nThe outbreak of the Ukraine War, and rising systemic hostilities with China, illustrate that the enduring security of the incumbent global system, so amenable to interests of the UK and the ROI, is being threatened across multiple theatres. Competition with Russia in the Euro-Atlantic, and China in the Indo-Pacific, are not isolated challenges, but are heavily interlinked in an ongoing battle across Eurasia to preserve the US-led world order against revisionist authoritarian states. This geopolitical landscape is characterised by a complex array of threats: from the conventional warfare seen in Ukraine; to physical, yet below threshold, damage to critical infrastructure; to subversive tactics, such as cyber-attacks and the cognitive warfare of disinformation campaigns. Whilst the specific nature of these threats differs across the two Eurasian theatres, they are nonetheless linked by their broad tactical and operational similarities, the defensive responses they demand, and the mutual strategic ambition to challenge the US-led order.\n\nThe critical importance of approaching British national security through this broad geographical lens was successfully identified by the UK government’s Integrated Review Refresh in 2023. Whilst correctly asserting the Euro-Atlantic as the priority region for protecting our security and prosperity, the Refresh confirmed the concomitant exigencies of engaging – and, where necessary, competing – with China in the Indo-Pacific. In doing so, the government correctly diagnosed the Eurasian threat environment, in which attention and resources must be prioritised – but nonetheless, shared – to uphold the US-led world order on two fronts.\n\nFrom the perspective of strategic prioritisation, a British grand strategy has therefore been formulated on the basis of an eastwards shift, whereby we engage closely with Continental European allies and partners in the face of the Russian threat, whilst tilting overall strategic gravity to the Indo-Pacific to support the US in its contestation with China. This rationale has informed the UK’s latest flurry of diplomatic and military initiatives, from last year’s UK-France Summit, to the bilateral strategic partnership with Norway, to the Hiroshima Accord signed with Japan, and the AUKUS pact with Australia and the US. The ambition is to construct a constellation of alliances and partnerships in the face of Russian and Chinese threats, in which national resources are allocated so as to combine with those of our allies, to achieve our strategic objectives across Eurasia.\n\nThis is the landscape in which both the UK and the ROI are positioned. Acting as the geographical and strategic ‘gateway to Europe’, the UK and Ireland constitute the main highway for transatlantic goods, ships and digital communications. As demonstrated in the previous chapter, the decisive importance of maintaining free maritime and air access around British-Irish coastlines and oceanic approaches has been exhibited throughout history. Although the region did not exhibit its strategically vital nature overtly during Europe’s period of relative peace between the end of the Cold War and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this does not mean that it dissipated. In fact, peacetime developments have brought further strategic importance to waters surrounding the UK and the ROI, through the exponential build-up of critical maritime infrastructure, which carries energy and digital data across the Atlantic and Europe.\n\nFollowing the end of the Cold War, Western European states sought to maintain Continental security by establishing a mutually beneficial, integrated economic system, insured by the NATO security umbrella. From 1993, the newly-formed EU welcomed post-Soviet central and eastern European states rapidly, forming a formidable economic bloc. The EU swiftly became the most interconnected economic unit on the globe, as intra-regional trade has consistently accounted for two-thirds of the bloc’s total trade. Whilst the EU promoted political union and some measures to achieve collective defence and foreign policy, its fundamental principle remained that encouraging buy-in to mutual economic security would sustain the continent’s stability. This was similarly reflected in its post-Cold War approach to the Russian Federation, which established strong energy ties with the former adversary to create symbiotic interest in peaceful relations. A two-tiered, interconnected, transatlantic-European security system therefore characterised the period 1991-2021, whereby the continent’s stability was to be guaranteed by its economic integration, with the NATO security framework acting as insurance of the last accord.\n\nWith interconnection comes interdependence, as each state has come to rely on the critical infrastructure which undergirds their social, economic, political and military systems. Returning to the global threat landscape, targeting these infrastructural sites presents a strategically invaluable opportunity to cause system-wide disruption, whose consequences will reverberate across borders. This systemic potential is obviously attractive to the ambitions of our adversaries: whether China – which seeks wholesale revision of the US-led world order, Russia – which wishes to subvert the incumbent European framework, and displace the US as the primordial power within it – or the Islamic Republic of Iran – whose survival strategy entails imposing destabilising costs on western nations to weaken their resolve in sustaining economic and diplomatic pressure on the regime.\n\nThus, whether it is an undersea fibre-optic cable connecting the US and the UK, or a gas pipeline running from Norway to Germany, each component of these intercontinental systems represents a target through which to damage all constituents. The overarching security landscape, and all national security within it, has thus transitioned away from the protection of critical national infrastructure to that of critical infrastructure of international relevance. The UK and ROI’s position at the epicentre of transatlantic movement and communications makes them both vital to the overall stability of the entire system.\n\nThe two states of the British Isles therefore comprise primary targets for adversaries seeking to undermine the transatlantic-European alliance by compromising its vital energy and communication systems. As island nations, the UK and ROI both rely upon undersea pipelines for their energy supplies. Furthermore, both are net energy importers. The UK imports 50% of its gas, with 77% crossing the North Sea from Norway. Ireland is even more dependent on the international energy market, importing 100% of its oil and 71% of gas. The closely aligned strategic interest that the UK and ROI have in the security of these channels is underscored by the fact that 75% of the ROI’s gas currently flows from the UK via two pipelines. This figure was as high as 95% before 2016, in which year the ROI’s Corrib gas field began to supply the nation. The Corrib field is relatively small, and is set to go out of operation in 2030, at which point the ROI will become entirely dependent on the UK again, barring further developments. Thus, for the foreseeable future, UK-ROI energy security is dependent on the security of undersea maritime infrastructure crossing the North Sea.\n\nEU natural gas pipeline network, 2022. Source: https://memgraph.com/blog/gas-pipelines-in-europe\n\nEven more important to wider transatlantic-Europe security is the UK-ROI function as a major node of the northern hemisphere’s undersea fibre-optic cable network. Three-quarters of all northern hemisphere undersea cables run through the ROI’s territorial waters alone.\n\nSource: https://www.submarinecablemap.com/\n\nThis undersea network constitutes the digital connective tissue upon which the social, economic, political, and military systems of the transatlantic community depend. Its fundamental importance to the security of all states, therefore, cannot be overstated and, as a result, nor can that of the UK-ROI node within the wider system. This affords adversaries the opportunity to infiltrate, or outright damage, the digital channels which service the entirety of the transatlantic-European economic and security systems. Furthermore, the porous international legal framework governing undersea activities, provided by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), places responsibility firmly on countries themselves to deter hostile acts. However, policing and protecting these cables rigorously requires highly sophisticated technological and operational capabilities. This renders cables exceedingly vulnerable both above and below the conflict threshold.\n\nCrucially to the Eurasian competition landscape, whilst geography dictates that Russia alone can access this infrastructure in the Euro-Atlantic for physical explorative and exploitative purposes, cyber sabotage can originate from anywhere. It is therefore a genuine and plausible target in the entirety of the Eurasian battleground, whether by state actors (China and Iran), or non-state groups.\n\n2.3: The UK’s Exposure on its Northwestern Flank\n\nChapter I provided the historical context for the UK’s current lack of military presence in Northern Ireland. This limits its deployment capacity through the Western Approaches towards the GIUK Gap and North Atlantic. As Russia has returned as a threat to European and transatlantic security, and climate change promises to increase accessibility to and from the High North, the full strategic implications of the Royal Navy and RAF draw-down from the 1970s is becoming clear.\n\nSource: https://t-intell.com/2021/03/30/echoes-of-the-cold-war-why-bears-like-the-g-i-u-k-gap/\n\nThe UK’s nearest deployment platforms to the North Atlantic and High North are currently HM Naval Base Clyde, and RAF Lossiemouth. With four Typhoon Squadrons, nine P-8A maritime patrol aircraft, and the new fleet of E-7 Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning aircraft all hosted at Lossiemouth, the UK’s northern Quick Reaction Alert is well established. This enables the UK to patrol the area up to the High North, which it does alongside regional allies in order to deter Russian airborne aggression. Meanwhile, the UK Air Surveillance and Control System is fully integrated into NATO’s Control and Reporting Centres. Through the node of RAF Boulmer in North Yorkshire, this gives the UK high level radar coverage spanning from the Western Atlantic to 3,000 miles across Eastern Europe.\n\nWhilst the gap created by the RAF draw-down in Northern Ireland has therefore been mostly mitigated, British naval capacities on the left of the Western Approaches remain limited. Maritime patrol of these waters, and by extension the Eastern Atlantic, depend on rapid naval deployment to interdict hostile intrusion. As shown, major transatlantic undersea cables pass through this region en route to the UK and the European Continent. The Derry naval base was perfectly located for maritime policing deployment, which has become a renewed imperative due to the array of threats Russia poses in the maritime domain.\n\nIn 2022, Russia shifted the Arctic to its top priority region with its new Maritime Doctrine. As the Baltic and Atlantic place in second and third, this shows the threat trajectory which the UK faces to the north and west. Whilst the next section details the specific Russian activities in this domain, the general implications for our northwestern defence system were articulated by the International Relations and Defence Committee’s recent report on British strategy in the Arctic. As the UK and its allies respond to Russia’s strategic shift, the strain on attention and resources is set to intensify. Minister of State for the Armed Forces James Heappey acknowledged that existing maritime patrol capabilities in the region may no longer suffice, as our current fleet of P-8 aircraft was structured to meet Russia’s aims before its strategic recalibration. Also last year, the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee released a report titled Defence in Scotland, which expressed the repeated concerns of experts that bases in Scotland are likely to be over-stretched by growing capability demands.\n\nThis trend is only set to increase, as Russia’s freedom to manoeuvre from the north towards Atlantic and GIUK Gap will improve as warming temperatures continue to melt the Arctic ice. The report notes that the central Arctic Ocean will be mostly free of ice in the summer by 2040-2045, a development which is already turning the previously uncontested region into a new frontier of geopolitical competition. Thus, this combination of political and environmental forces is set to – indeed, already has – alter the baseline defensive needs of the UK on its northern and western flanks. With an uncooperative and unequipped Ireland (Chapter III), there is a renewed compulsion for the UK to refocus on Northern Ireland as a central element of its homeland and regional defence system.\n\nWithin this strategic context, the following sections outline the specific nature of the threats posed to British-Irish security – and as a corollary, to European and transatlantic – primarily from Russia, but also China and Iran.\n\n2.4: The Russian Threat\n\nThe grand strategy informing Russia’s global activities under President Vladimir Putin is its desire to re-wire the post-Cold War European security system, in order to displace the US as the region’s great power. This ambition has ideological and political-economic rationales.\n\nThe former stems from Putin’s guiding faith that his nation’s geopolitical, economic, and cultural DNA grants it unalterable, enduring great power status, a belief he has articulated many times over the decades. Ever since the initiation of Peter the Great’s nation-building quest 300 years ago, and Catherine the Great’s great southwards expansion, the centre of gravity of Russia’s great power credentials has always been Europe. It is in this continental theatre that Russia has lost and regained its relative power repeatedly in the intervening years, until – in the eyes of its current President – the West brought about its last national humiliation in 1991. He is now hellbent on restoring Russia’s former status, which guides his competition and contestation with the West across the globe. The kernel of this revisionist doctrine is, of course, Europe, attested to by Russia’s persistent, and ultimately futile, efforts to sever the Baltic states from the transatlantic alliance, and its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTo serve this overall ambition, Putin has structured the post-1991 political-economy of the Russian Federation, to enable his authoritarian control over national resources to channel them in their entirety towards his geopolitical aims. Having assumed power in 2000, the President dismembered the Russian oligarchy, stripped them of their assets, and awarded them to a parallel new elite. This has engendered centralised control over all production and resources, but also an absence of free market dynamics which is anathema to the economic model established by the EU. Whilst acquiescing to the energy ties established by Russian gas exports to Europe, the Russian Federation’s wider economy remains insulated from the global economic system, maintaining Putin’s capacity to channel national resources towards great power competition. The implementation of western sanctions against Russia following the 2014 invasion of Crimea, and ongoing Ukraine War, further calcified the political-economic divergence between Russia and the West, a situation determined by the President’s revisionist ambitions.\n\nAs this grand strategy has intentionally – and resultantly, through reactive measures – created deepening systemic bifurcation between Russia and the West, this in turn gives Moscow tactical options within the subthreshold context, aimed at degrading the transatlantic-European economic and security networks. Before assessing these, it is crucial to emphasise the ROI’s particular susceptibility to these threats as a vulnerable entry point to these systems. Firstly, its geographical isolation from Europe, and vast oceanic exposure to the north and west, gives ready access and manoeuvrability to adversaries approaching by sea and land. Secondly, the ROI’s paradoxical position as a non-NATO member, yet one which is structurally integral to transatlantic sea and air movement and digital communications, affords Russia the opportunity to target these systems within the ROI’s territory, safe from triggering NATO’s collective security mechanism. This particular strategic vulnerability has been heightened by Finland and Sweden’s (imminent) accession. This has turned the ROI into the northwestern outlier in NATO’s European territories, increasing the probability of the Kremlin targeting it as a means of destabilising the alliance through the back-door.\n\nThe Russian threat to the ROI falls into two categories: conventional conflict and unconventional pressure. Whilst the former is at least hypothetically possible, due to Russia’s possession of aircraft and naval forces capable of reaching Irish territory, it is parenthetical in the isolated context of the ROI; Russian territorial expansionism is part of a much broader set of issues that the NATO bloc as a whole must confront. In any case, Russia’s military is locked into the brutal Ukraine War, and so there is no conceivable strategic objective for invading Ireland at present, which would justify the necessary transportation of naval equipment, forces and materiel to the Federation’s Northern Fleet bases, from which to embark upon the long-winded route through the High North and Eastern Atlantic. Therefore, the Commission on the Irish Defence Forces (see Chapter III) assessment for the year 2030 and beyond – that the risk of conventional military attack is low – is correct.\n\nInstead, Russia poses a range of unconventional threats which would involve infiltration, and physical and cyber-attacks, on the ROI’s critical infrastructure, national IT systems, institutions, and intelligence-based national security agencies. All of these, considering the UK’s geography, are equally relevant to British interests. Hostile activity may all occur – and per the below, evidence suggests that the ROI has already experienced them – below the conflict threshold, owing to difficulties in attributing blame, and porous legal governance of these domains. Through utilising such tactical variety, Moscow seeks to spread the attention and resources of security apparatus thin, so as to impose greater costs and increase the chance of success in any one area. It bears repeating that such measures would endanger both national security, and that of the European and transatlantic systems in which Ireland resides.\n\n2.4.1: Critical maritime infrastructure\n\nThe most acute vulnerability the ROI has in the Russian context is to the critical maritime infrastructure located in its territorial waters. There are two factors behind the primordial status of this threat: the ROI’s sheer vulnerability, and Moscow’s significant capabilities and intent in this domain.\n\nFirstly, as mentioned, three-quarters of northern hemisphere undersea cables travel through the ROI’s waters. Four transatlantic cables land on the ROI’s shores, and 12 connect the ROI to the UK, in most cases before extending onwards to the European continent. Aside from the general importance of cables to a state’s social, political, economic and military systems, the ROI’s finance and tech-dominated economy renders its economic model even more dependent on these undersea networks. Indeed, the government’s strategy for economic growth is predicated entirely on digital data transfers along undersea cables, folded into the ambition to make Ireland the central digital hub in the East-West corridor. Technology allows adversaries to sabotage these cables – both with rudimentary physical damage, and cyber-attacks – and to tap them with listening devices, enabling data to be collected and decoded. Due to the interconnected nature of the global financial system and tech sector, disruption to Irish infrastructure would have massive knock-on effects for other states integrated in the international free market and US-led order.\n\nSimilarly, Russia can disrupt transatlantic-European energy channels by targeting Irish critical undersea infrastructure. Whilst the country currently relies on gas pipelines for its non-renewable energy, the government’s 2021 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act commits to generating 5 GW of electricity from offshore wind farms by 2030. This is therefore set to sustain the island’s dependence on maritime infrastructure beyond 2050. Whilst positive from an environmental perspective, this new critical maritime infrastructure will place further strain on Ireland’s maritime defences, and proffer additional targets to Russia.\n\nSecondly, the strategy of targeting critical maritime infrastructure to weaken adversaries’ military-economic capabilities is enshrined in the Russian Federation’s military doctrine. Indeed, it makes no secret of its intent to wage hybrid warfare on the West in this way: its SODCIT operation is designed to degrade enemies materially and psychologically by destroying critical national and international infrastructure. By developing the capability to strike western military-economic targets – such as undersea cables – Russia seeks strategic advantages which do not carry a direct risk to life, thus reducing the risk of unintended escalation. To reiterate, the impact of incidents involving undersea cables and energy flows does not remain localised. This structural paradox enables precision strikes on specific targets to cause serious, systemic damage.\n\nRussia has systematically funnelled its resources, and structured its naval-intelligence institutions, in order to execute this threat. The GUGI (the Deep-Sea Research Group) is the Kremlin’s cross-agency unit run by the Russian Ministry of Defence and the GRU, which pools the nation’s most experienced and capable naval officers, and is tasked with both protecting Russian waters and engaging in offensive missions against NATO assets. Russia has been developing its technical and operational capabilities to these ends for decades, and is now equipped with formidable sub-surface autonomous and manned vehicles for exploring, infiltrating and attacking deep-sea targets. It has been noted that the GUGI’s responsibilities have expanded significantly recently, as it is tasked with both offensive and defensive capabilities, from the Arctic down to the Atlantic. Capability overstretch therefore presents the UK and its partners with an opportunity to launch pressurising expeditionary missions towards Russia, to force the GUGI to expend more attention and resources on its defensive tasks.\n\nThe uptick in Russian activity around critical maritime infrastructure since the beginning of the Ukraine War indicates the alarming trajectory of this increasing threat. On over 70 reported occasions, Moscow has exhibited its intention and capacity to access and manoeuvre freely in both the shallow waters of the Baltic and North Sea, as well as at greater depths in the Arctic and Atlantic. Indeed, the British Royal Navy spotted the GUGI’s special purpose intelligence-collection ship, Yantar, near a major fibre-optic cable in the Irish Sea in August 2021. The ship then progressed uncontested into the English Channel in September. In 2022, two Russian submarines were tracked travelling south towards the North Sea from the Arctic. Last year, the Royal Navy found a group of sub-surface vessels – this time accompanied by a surface ship – operating in the English Channel. The increasingly unsustainable nature of the ROI’s undefended seas was perhaps again revealed at the end of last year, when a report claimed that, six months ago, the Royal Navy had intervened to chase off a Russian submarine sitting outside Cork Harbour, which had been completely undetected by the Irish.\n\nFrom a strategic perspective, it is unsurprising that Russia is now signalling its undersea capabilities more openly. As its conventional land capabilities are consumed in Ukraine, it is looking for other ways of achieving asymmetric advantage. As the weaker power in the conflict, the Kremlin must bide its time and find alternative courses of action to impose greater relative cost on the West. As witnessed by the state of tension which accompanies each sighting of Russian activity, the undersea domain is one such option. Russia can therefore operationalise its existing capabilities and expertise to spread panic, divert resources and, if desired, attack the systems which underpin western security and prosperity. The upshot is that the Russian threat to Irish critical maritime infrastructure is likely to increase in frequency and severity.\n\n2.4.2: Air incursion\n\nAs with the maritime domain, the ROI is entirely air blind, owing to its lack of a primary air radar, which leaves it without the ability to identify hostile incursions into its airspace. Even if it did have such a monitoring system, the Air Corps does not own the aircraft to intercept and challenge intruders. This renders its air space entirely undefended by national means.\n\nIn recent years, it was publicised that the British RAF may have had a secret deal in place since 1952 to intercept hostile actors flying in Irish air space. Whilst the Irish government has rejected the veracity of this arrangement, numerous reports – including from members of the Irish Air Corps – suggest it does indeed exist. The point is that, if it does not exist, Irish air space is entirely unprotected. If it does, the UK is offering covert assistance at great cost to accommodate the ROI’s reluctance to police its own air space.\n\nLeaving aside question marks over the existence of the deal, the ability of Russian aircraft to manoeuvre in the interstice of transatlantic air space, undetected and unchallenged, would evade American and European early warning systems for longer, thereby reducing the time to launch an interceptive response. This would allow Russian aircraft to get much closer to transatlantic sovereign air spaces unopposed than if they flew south via NATO air policing in the Nordic region.\n\nCrucially, the ROI’s lack of radar system does not just render its sovereign air space unguarded – which extends 12 miles from the coastline – but its Flight Information Region (FIR), which is a must larger area.\n\nIreland’s sovereign air space and FIR. Source: https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/why-do-british-fighter-jets-protect-irish-airspace/\n\nIt is assumed that, if the RAF deal exists, it grants the UK permission to launch Typhoon fighter jets to intercept unidentified aircraft, both in the ROI’s FIR and its sovereign air space. If these aircraft were headed westwards towards the UK, the de facto extension of British air space to the ROI would result in mutually-strengthened air defences. Thus, whilst Russia is unlikely to strike the ROI anytime soon, the latter’s air blindness hampers the transatlantic-European defences in this domain, by offering Russia an alternative flight path to get closer to the UK and the Continent whilst evading early warning systems. However, the speed of contemporary aircraft means that lengthier identification and interception response times gives Russia a potentially critical tactical advantage, when approaching from the exposed west of the ROI.\n\n2.4.3: Cyber warfare and attacks on national infrastructure and institutions\n\nRussia also poses an enormous cyber espionage threat, given its ability to conduct attacks targeting national IT infrastructure, social institutions, and governmental intelligence and security agencies. As in the case of critical infrastructure, the Federation is institutionally, operationally, and strategically configured to focus on activity in this domain, and has developed leading expertise over decades. State-sponsored cyber terrorism – combining ransomware and Advanced Persistent Threat attacks – against the West is orchestrated by the FSB, the SVR, the GRU’s Unit 26165, and the GRU’s Main Centre of Special Technologies (Unit 74455).\n\nAs with critical maritime infrastructure, cyber tactics are operational below the threshold of war, making them immediate concerns. Furthermore, they have the same two-fold implications for Irish and European security. The overarching strategic calculus behind infiltration of, and assault on, national infrastructure and institutions – beyond the immediate damage caused – is similar to that of terrorism: to elicit social and institutional paranoia at the prospect of seemingly arbitrary attack and, in doing so, to exert external control over political decision-making processes. In targeting a vulnerable ROI, therefore, Russia would agitate Europe with high degrees of deniability, and so at low risk of escalation.\n\nRussia’s cyber activities in Ukraine illustrate the potential of its capabilities and intentions in this domain. In 2022 alone, Ukraine suffered more than 2,000 cyber-attacks originating from Russia, 40% of which were targeted at critical infrastructure. This was not a novel tactic, as Russia’s invasion of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 was accompanied by a massive suspected cyber-attack, which hit over 200,000 internet users in western Ukraine. That said, Ukraine has largely been successful in withstanding Russian cyber warfare as the war has progressed, in part due to NATO’s dedicated cyber threat response cell. This illustrates the importance of multilateral defensive cooperation in this domain – in which the ROI does not sufficiently engage.\n\nRussia has already flexed its subthreshold cyber capabilities against the ROI’s critical national IT systems. In 2021, the Health Service Executive (HSE) suffered a major ransomware attack, causing all its national IT systems to shut down. The perpetrator was later identified as the Russian-based criminal gang, Wizard Spider, whose links to the GRU are well-established, and which has pledged allegiance to the Russian government openly. Last year, the ROI’s National Cyber Security Centre reported that it had stopped 60 attempted cyber incidents, and had neutralised a further 500 as they were tapping for active vulnerabilities. As with the HSE crisis, Russia’s capacity to infiltrate the ROI’s most critical national institutions may well have been evinced again last July, when the infamous Russian cybercriminal group, CL0p, claimed it had accessed 143 gigabytes of ComReg’s data, Ireland’s communications regulator.\n\nAside from the patent threat to Irish national security, which in and of itself distresses the stability of the European order, these incidents signal to other states Russia’s obvious cyber warfare pedigree. As well as inducing panic, this has the strategic effect of forcing nations to invest in, and focus on, bolstering their digital security and intelligence apparatus, thereby imposing costs which divert resources from more conventional defence.\n\n2.4.4: Espionage and subversive presence\n\nAs well as accessing remote infiltration, reports abound of Russian presence in sensitive European academic and government institutions for seemingly malign purposes. In recent years, Russian agents – both civilians and intelligence officials – have been uncovered operating all over Europe, including in London, Norway’s University of Tromsø, the ICC in the Netherlands, the British Embassy in Berlin, and even NATO’s Brussels HQ. A Swedish report released in 2021, which assessed ten years of espionage convictions in Europe, found that the overwhelming majority involved Russian infiltration, and that the frequency of cases involving Russia had increased significantly. The report concludes that Moscow is targeting sensitive governmental, diplomatic and educational institutions as part of its subthreshold unconventional warfare strategy, as a means of collecting intelligence which could be used to degrade European security in the future. . Moscow’s routine use of its embassies for espionage in other states is well known.\n\nGiven the ROI’s status as an EU member state, its porous cyber security infrastructure, and critical position in international infrastructural networks, it is certain that Russia is conducting similar espionage operations here. Indeed, indicators exist in the public domain to support these concerns Last year, it was uncovered that ROI citizen Marina Sologub, who faces deportation by Australia under the charge of being a Russian spy, had previously worked in the Irish Dáil, and had established good relationships with Irish politicians. She denies the charges and, according to the most recent reports, is fighting her deportation.\n\nMoreover, for many years, concerns have circulated around the intentions behind the inordinately large Russian diplomatic outfit in Dublin, which had 30 members of staff in 2022. This compared strikingly with Russia’s diplomatic presence at the time in other European nations with which it has closer civil, trade and cultural ties: 22 in the UK, 10 in Poland, 12 in Germany, and 19 in France. Only the Russian embassy in the US is better staffed (37). It was subsequently reported that the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, working with An Garda Síochána, had expelled four Russian diplomats, with six others leaving. That said, the same report cited security sources which stated that illegal Russia networks operating within the ROI remain “almost impossible to detect once embedded”.\n\nRussia’s concerted infiltration campaign in the ROI was also evinced the controversy over Russia’s attempts to enlarge its embassy in Dublin. In 2015, the Russian government was granted planning permission from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to expand its Irish embassy significantly, with several new accommodation blocks, and an underground operational “nerve centre”. At the time, a former MI6 officer pointed to Ireland as the perfect European location for Russian officials “hunkering down” to assist in the Ukraine War. It was only after the size of the embassy came under media scrutiny that, in March 2020, the Irish government revoked the planning permission, for the reason that it was “likely to be harmful to the security and defence of the State”.\n\nVisualisation of the intended expansion, with requested new builds coloured yellow. Source: https://www.rte.ie/news/primetime/2022/0310/1285699-russian-embassy-orwell-road-irish-government/\n\nRussia also seems to be targeting institutions and locations involved in the ROI’s maritime field. In 2020, it was confirmed that GRU intelligence agents had been mapping Ireland’s transatlantic and European cables. There is also concern regarding Russian presence in Irish academic institutions with maritime and oceanographic faculties. The infamous case of GRU officer Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov points to the potential for Russian infiltration of Irish universities. Cherkasov, who was uncovered and sentenced in 2022 after applying for a position at the ICC, spent five years studying at Trinity College Dublin, which has a sizeable Geology department.\n\nRecently, the US informed the ROI that Russia might attempt to interfere in its upcoming local and general elections. Dublin received a cable articulating the undisclosed reasons behind these concerns, which are reportedly based on an American assessment of 11 elections in nine countries in the years 2020-2022. The Irish government implicitly conceded the veracity of these fears, when Justice Minister Helen McEntee – asked about the reports regarding the American cable – replied that there is “always a risk” of foreign interference in Irish elections. Considering Sinn Fein’s obvious hostility to a productive security relationship with the UK and NATO, and its broader unwillingness to confront any real strategic questions that face the ROI, Russia would clearly stand to gain by implementing its well-known interference methods in the ROI’s upcoming election.\n\nMoreover, the ROI is an obvious porous spot for Russian evasion of high-technology sanctions. The UK is already aware of attempts by hostile actors to partner with British universities to steal advanced weapons technology. There is evidence that Russia has targeted the ROI for similar purposes, including the prevalence of ROI-produced parts in Russian weapons since at least mid-2022. Absent any desire to improve its counterintelligence capabilities, the ROI will remain a hotspot for Russian technological disruption.\n\nAs with the critical infrastructure and cyber threats, espionage is employed to subvert both the ROI’s national security, and that of the wider European order. By successfully, and publicly, compromising sensitive institutions, Russia may also be seeking to frustrate Ireland’s future integration into the EU’s burgeoning security and intelligence system, by underscoring its status as an exposed and unreliable partner in this domain. Again, this demonstrates how Ireland’s paradoxical position – relatively unintegrated and isolated from the transatlantic-European framework, yet integral to its economic and security systems – renders it a probable target in Russia’s struggle with the West.\n\n2.5: The Chinese Threat\n\n2.5.1: Chinese strategic designs on the UK and the ROI\n\nWhereas Russian grand strategy is fundamentally limited to subverting the European order, China’s purview is global. The PRC’s overarching ambition is to dislodge the US as the global great power by 2049.\n\nUnlike the Russian menace in Europe, the geographical fulcrum of Sino-American competition is China’s Eastern Pacific neighbourhood. The position and role of the British Isles within this Eurasian competition is therefore distinct from that with Russia, in that the islands are separated from the area of contest by over 7,000km. China is therefore unlikely to send submersible vessels into British and ROI waters to map and target critical maritime infrastructure anytime soon.\n\nNonetheless, the same strategic logic applies to the UK and the ROI’s function in transatlantic informational and security systems, which China can similarly exploit to pressurise the US-led order. The UK has identified China as a “systemic challenge” to British interests and values, both in the Integrated Review Refresh and other contexts. On British soil, China employs an array of subversive methods, such as IP theft, institutional and political infiltration, and the co-optation and intimidation of Chinese citizens. Given the weakness of the ROI’s security state, and its position at the epicentre of the transatlantic alliance, it follows that China would stand to gain similarly from engaging in the same unconventional destabilising activities in the ROI. As with Russia, China may well therefore look to exploit the ROI’s vulnerabilities in sensitive informational areas, through cyber warfare and espionage, as a means of infiltrating and degrading the transatlantic order.\n\nIt is first important to assess the function of the UK and the ROI in China’s overarching strategic ambitions, so that the specific threats it poses to the two can be fully understood. Whilst Russia’s rivalry with Europe is of top-tier strategic importance due to Moscow’s quest to re-write the continent’s security landscape, Sino-European competition plays a subsidiary role to China’s overarching contest with the US.\n\nThe British parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee’s (ISC) recent report on China is the most articulate government-level analysis of the UK’s Chinese threat. Its description of how the UK fits into China’s grand strategy is worth citing in full:\n\nThe UK may not be the top priority for China when it comes to espionage and interference, but it is nevertheless of significant interest, mainly given our close relationship with the United States (US): China sees almost all of its global activity in the context of its struggle with the US. The UK is also of interest given its membership of international bodies of significance to China and the perception of the UK as an opinion-former – which plays into China’s strategy to reshape international systems in its favour. These factors would appear to place the UK just below China’s top priority targets, as it seeks to build support for its current ‘core interests’: to mute international criticism and to gain economically.\n\nChinese interest in the UK thus has three bases: its role and importance in the transatlantic alliance; its global influence as a member of major multilateral organisations; and the economic benefit of ties with the world’s sixth largest economy. Beijing currently pursues a sophisticated strategy towards the UK, and the EU, which combines these pillars with the ultimate aim of weakening the US: by establishing close economic, diplomatic and institutional links, it hopes to acquire leverage to engender non-alignment amongst the transatlantic alliance. Following Brexit, China views the UK as a particularly amenable target within the European context, and as a result more investment has been funnelled from the former to the latter than into all other European economies since 2000.\n\n2.5.2: Economic penetration\n\nWhilst the ROI does not possess the UK’s global standing, it shares a strong relationship with the US due to the history of migration between the two countries. Ireland’s function in the global economy as a financial and tech hub, which receives vast quantities of FDI from western partners, also renders it a likely target of China’s influence-building strategy of building stakes in worldwide economies.\n\nThe ROI’s status as a tax haven has attracted major western companies – including Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, IBM, Microsoft, and Apple – to establish their European headquarters there. As well as being a regional tech hub, most major banks also have a large presence on the island, such as Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Revolut and Citigroup, to name a few. Lured by a low corporate tax regime in place since the 1990s, the finance and tech sectors have placed the ROI high up the leaderboard of global FDI recipients, coming in at eighth in 2022, a disproportionately high ranking relative to the ROI’s geographical and economic size. That same year, Ireland received over $550bn of American FDI, placing it fourth highest.\n\nMore recently, ROI-Chinese trade relations have been on an upwards trajectory, with bilateral trade volume rising from €3.7bn in 2014 to €25.3bn in 2022. It is important that this growth in inbound Chinese FDI has occurred during President Xi Jinping’s tenure, which has pursued investment as a means of tapping into other countries’ intellectual and technological reserves. Indeed, the British ISC report notes that foreign investment affords the CCP the means through which to acquire technology, gain insight into complex manufacturing and supply chain systems, and generally observe the industrial and financial systems of other countries.\n\nIn addition to this economic penetration, another effect of fostering these ties is that it can skew the ROI’s perceptions of China, and consequently engender a low threat perception. The Irish State Defence Commission hinted at such a sentiment, as it acknowledged the long-term implications of China’s hybrid capabilities for the EU’s security, yet also noted the economic opportunities it presents. As the economic benefits of growing ties with China increase, the Irish government’s stance in Sino-American competition is unclear. The Commission on the Defence Forces states that, “as the United States becomes increasingly focused on China as a strategic challenger, Europe may no longer be able to rely on American military support to handle regional conflicts and crises”. Last November, Micheál Martin visited Beijing, and pledged to renew the political, cultural, and economic connections between the nations. This trip was largely perceived as a bridge-building mission, following his previous comments that the ROI and private sector must remain clear-eyed about China’s wider strategic objectives, which had elicited criticism in Beijing.\n\nIt would appear, therefore, that the ROI’s political and security class is maintaining an ambivalent stance amidst Sino-American competition, as would be appropriate given its track record in modern great power competitions. As the following subsection illustrates, this lack of clarity regarding China’s overall ambition to undermine the US-led order will leave the ROI insufficiently vigilant to Chinese attempts to infiltrate and subvert its society and institutions.\n\n2.5.3: Chinese espionage and infiltration\n\nAs the ISC report, and one published last May by the Special Committee on the Canada-People’s Republic of China Relationship (the Canadian Report), expose in exhaustive detail how Beijing is implementing subversive and unconventional capabilities in the West. Cross-examination of the British and Canadian reports exhibit a remarkable consistency across the spectrum of Chinese activity in both countries. Both are experiencing a whole-of-state infiltration of their political, economic and social domains via cyber and human espionage: from agents planted in political contexts to interfere and gather information; to civilians and cyber groups conducting IP theft in academic institutions and businesses; to the tapping of, and cyber-attacks on, critical infrastructure and sensitive government institutions; to media and electoral interference. Through significant investment in western higher education, Beijing is also charged with exerting pressure and intimidation on these institutions to influence their stance on China. In doing so, it hopes to alter its perception amongst young, educated westerners on a generational scale.\n\nThat the UK and Canada have published the most detailed assessment of domestic Chinese interference certainly does not mean they are the only states being targeted. Indeed, there are markers available in the public domain which indicate that the CCP at least has the potential to engage in similar activities in Ireland.\n\nThe latest census on the size of the ethnic Chinese community in the ROI estimated the total figure at 60,000, making it the largest or second largest minority ethnic community in the country. In-keeping with the CCP’s growing interest in the ROI over the last decade, it purchased more land to expand its Dublin embassy significantly in 2014.\n\nAs with the UK, the influx of Chinese students, and Chinese investment, into Irish universities has accelerated in recent years. Chinese students now comprise the third largest body of international students in Irish universities (3,970). Irish universities have also embarked upon concerted attempts to appeal to Chinese investment, including Trinity College Dublin. As of 2016, there were 13 Confucius Institutes and Classrooms in the ROI’s educational institutions (and there is no evidence that any of these have been closed), including two Institutes at University College Dublin, and one at University College Cork. Confucius Institutes have come under scrutiny for their potential role in intimidating students and stifling academic debate, and are run by the CCP’s Central Propaganda Department-affiliated Hanban organisation.\n\nReports of verified Chinese cyber-attacks on the ROI remain scarce, but this may well say more about the capacity of the latter’s security services to identify such activity, rather than the former’s lack of intent. That China already has the means and intent to conduct cyber penetration of western government institutions, infrastructure and businesses is already well-known and well documented. Like Russia, Chinese cyber and infiltration operations are performed by a combination of state and state-backed actors, as the Chinese Ministry of State Security teams up with cyber groups – such as APT10 – to compromise and degrade western IT systems. In 2022, the ROI forced a Chinese police service station in Dublin to close down, organisations which have been accused of harassing Chinese dissidents, as well as serving as overseas listening posts.\n\nThus, just as the UK’s close relationship with the US and Europe mark it out as an attractive target for infiltration, the ROI’s deep integration in global financial and technology systems, and membership of the EU, present Beijing with the same opportunity. Indeed, this threat alignment spurred the CEO of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (UK NCSC), Lindy Cameron, to urge greater British-Irish cyberspace cooperation in 2021 to resist the Chinese threat. Whilst China’s hostility towards the ROI may not be as overt as that of Russia, the CCP’s increasing presence and engagement in Irish society follows similar patterns in other western countries. This heavily suggests that China is seeking to leverage ties with Ireland in its wider efforts to infiltrate and subvert western systems.\n\n2.6: The Iranian Threat\n\nThe predominant destabilising impact of the Islamic Republic of Iran is, of course, felt around the Middle East, where its domestic interference in other states, proxy warfare, and ballistic and nuclear programmes cause most trepidation. Nonetheless, as Policy Exchange’s recent report on the Iranian threat to the UK reveals in detail, part of the regime’s strategy for survival involves subversive activity across Europe. This involves funding and orchestrating terrorist attacks on foreign soil, cyber warfare and espionage targeted at critical national IT systems, developing illicit financial channels, threatening and endangering overseas dissidents, and disinformation campaigns designed to weaken social cohesion. The overall contribution of this foreign interference to the regime’s grand strategy for survival is twofold: to facilitate illicit financing of the Islamic Republic’s nefarious activities; and to foment domestic unrest and political discord in the West, thereby deterr"
