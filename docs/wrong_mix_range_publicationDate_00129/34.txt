Description

Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions is a satirical novella by the English schoolmaster Edwin Abbott. Abbott, first published in 1884 by Seeley & Co. of London. Written pseudonymously by "A Square", the book used the fictional two-dimensional world of Flatland to comment on the hierarchy of Victorian culture, but the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions.
