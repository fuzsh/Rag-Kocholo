This feature sparks curiosity in students and serves as the context for three-dimensional learning and hands-on activities.\n\nDrive Learning with Hands-On Activities and Labs\n\nStudents actively “do science” through hands-on science activities and labs; they think critically about their observations, practice gathering evidence, and defend their claims.\n\nInspire Students to Consider a Career in STEM\n\nSTEM is integrated into every unit, emphasizing engineering design as well as scientific literacy. Take it Further features careers in science and engineering to show students the real-world applications of what they’re learning.\n\nTeacher Experience\n\nThree-Dimensional Learning Made Simple\n\nThis science curriculum uses the 5E Instructional Model and each lesson has unique interrelated 3D Learning Objectives that ensure 100% coverage of the NGSS. The HMH NGSS trace tool allows teachers to quickly view what students should already know and what they need to learn next.\n\nLet Students Show What They Know\n\nFlexible assessment tools are available in various formats, including formal, performance-based, and technology-enhanced assessments, to evaluate student learning according to NGSS.\n\nAppropriate Component Configurations\n\nHMH Science Dimensions provides a consistent pedagogical approach from kindergarten through high school, with component configurations across grade bands that ensure ease of implementation and standards alignment.\n\nComponents of HMH Science Dimensions\n\nGrades K–5\n\nSingle-grade elementary editions feature complete print and digital curricula, including write-in textbooks and Interactive Online Student and Teacher Editions with built-in professional development support.\n\nGrades 6–8\n\nAt the middle school level, 12 topical modules (write-in texts plus full digital editions) covering Life, Earth & Space, Physical Science, and Engineering can be matched to a district’s curriculum.\n\nDimensiones de las Ciencias\n\nComponents include interactive write-in Spanish worktexts for Grades K–8 (including a hardcover Spanish text for Biology), Spanish assessment guides for Grades K–8, and a Spanish Teacher Edition for Grades K–5.\n\nBiology\n\nA complete print and digital curriculum that offers the flexibility of a consumable or non-consumable Student Text, both including the same content and utilizing innovative design to reinforce student-centric learning.\n\nChemistry\n\nA complete print and digital curriculum with a hardcover Student Text that utilizes innovative design to reinforce student-centric learning.\n\nEarth & Space Science\n\nAcomplete print and digital curriculum with a hardcover Student Text that utilizes innovative design to reinforce student-centric learning.\n\nPhysics\n\nA complete print and digital curriculum that offers the flexibility of a consumable or non-consumable Student Text, both including the same content and utilizing innovative design to reinforce student-centric learning.\n\nThe Power of Connected Teaching and Learning\n\nEd, the HMH learning platform, combines the best of technology, HMH Science Dimensions content, and instruction to personalize the teaching and learning experience.\n\nImmersive Digital Curriculum\n\nSupport for Teaching and Learning\n\nAt-Home and Offline Support\n\nImmersive Digital Curriculum\n\nOnline lessons are enriched above and beyond print lessons. Students can view videos and animations, interact with instructional images and text, enter responses, pursue intellectual interests by choosing lesson paths, and enjoy simulation-based learning.\n\nSupport for Teaching and Learning\n\nVia Ed, educators can manage classes and assignments and schedule virtual classroom sessions. They can quickly access content, search program resources, and create customized lessons and assessments. Class and student performance data in the Assessment and Standards Reports inform grouping and support instructional decisions.\n\nAt-Home and Offline Support\n\nEd’s connected experience supports both in-person and online learning. HMH Go extends the classroom by allowing students to download their HMH Science Dimensions digital resources for later offline use.\n\nProfessional Learning for HMH Science Dimensions\n\nGuided Implementation\n\nWith unlimited HMH Science Dimensions support, teachers will be up and running in 30 days and have continued access to essential resources all year long.\n\nCoaching Membership\n\nPartner with an HMH instructional coach for ongoing professional learning to enhance teaching and learning practices and maximize student outcomes with HMH Science Dimensions.\n\nLeadership Advisory\n\nDrive transformation and navigate an HMH Science Dimensions implementation with the Advisory Services team at the International Center for Leadership in Education.\n\nTeacher’s Corner\n\nYearlong teacher support through live events, articles, and on-demand videos provide educators with help whenever needed.\n\nSimplify the transition to next-generation science.\n\nInsights & Resources\n\nArticles\n\nResearch\n\nWebinars\n\nTeaching about failure in an engineering context can help students better understand how this becomes a learning opportunity.\n\nDr. Cary Sneider\n\nStudents use evidence notebooks to record observations and predictions, make sketches, and note questions that they have.\n\nMichael DiSpezio\n\nUnderstanding the connections between science, engineering, and technology are important to monitoring planets and other parts of our solar system.\n\nDr. Mike Passow\n\nHMH Science Dimensions®: Research Evidence Base\n\nReport Type: Research Evidence Base\n\nGrade Level: Elementary, Middle, High\n\nDemonstrates a Rationale\n\nScience Curriculum\n\nScience Dimensions: Efficacy Study, Grades 7 and 8 (2017–2018)\n\nReport Type: Efficacy Study, Study Conducted by Third Party\n\nGrade Level: Middle\n\nRegion: Midwest, Northeast\n\nDistrict Urbanicity: Suburban, Rural\n\nDemonstrates a Rationale\n\nScience Curriculum\n\nScience Dimensions: Efficacy Study, Grades 4 and 5\n\nReport Type: Efficacy Study, Study Conducted by Third Party\n\nGrade Level: Elementary\n\nDistrict Urbanicity: Suburban, Rural\n\nDemonstrates a Rationale\n\nScience Curriculum\n\nWebinar\n\nKaley Douglas\n\nWatch Now\n\nWebinar\n\nBernadine Okoro\n\nWatch Now\n\nWebinar\n\nMarjorie Frank\n\nWatch Now\n\nSubscribe to Learn More about HMH Science Dimensions.\n\nFirst Name This field is required.\n\nLast Name This field is required.\n\nEmail Address This field is required.
