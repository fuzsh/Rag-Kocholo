With his devoted servant Passepartout at his side, Fogg sets off on an adventurous journey filled with amazing encounters and wild mishaps. Pursued all the way by the bumbling Detective Fix, who believes the two travelers are bank robbers on the run, Fogg and Passepartout must use every means of transportation known to 19th-century man - including a hot-air balloon, a locomotive, and an elephant - to win the bet.\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nA straightforward adventure/exploration story\n\nBy Darwin8u on 02-03-13\n\nThe Prince and the Pauper\n\nBy: Mark Twain\n\nNarrated by: Steve West\n\nLength: 7 hrs and 25 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 156\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 131\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 131\n\nThey look alike, but they live in very different worlds. Tom Canty, impoverished and abused by his father, is fascinated with royalty. Edward Tudor, heir to the throne of England, is kind and generous but wants to run free and play in the river - just once. How insubstantial their differences truly are becomes clear when a chance encounter leads to an exchange of clothing - and roles. The pauper finds himself caught up in the pomp and folly of the royal court, and the prince wanders horror-stricken through the lower strata of English society.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nWonderful author, terrific narrator, splendid book\n\nBy Rahni on 10-01-17\n\nLe Morte d'Arthur\n\nThe Death of Arthur\n\nBy: Sir Thomas Malory\n\nNarrated by: Bill Homewood\n\nLength: 38 hrs and 4 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 38\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 29\n\nStory\n\n5 out of 5 stars 29\n\nOf all the legends of Western civilization, perhaps the glorious adventures of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are the best known.

Tozer was a man of remarkable knowledge, an avid reader of Christians and philosophers from throughout the ages. But he meditated on the Bible, making him - like John Wesley - \"a man of one Book and a student of many\". Combine this knowledge with his acclaimed writing style and you have works like this one, high thoughts of God brought low - yet no less moving - for the common listener. When you set out to study Christ, you want to behold his splendor the best you can. That's why writers like A. W. Tozer are excellent guides.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nTozer never disappoints .

The fine qualities of his writings have ensured that his books are still popular and useful. This volume has become a classic work and is known and loved by many throughout the world. In days when evangelical preachers are accused of being either superficial or dull, we have here a great example of one who was neither of these things. As Bishop Ryle applies his texts, the listener will find his soul examined.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nHeavenly Inspiration.\n\nBy slug69 on 10-08-12\n\nThe Root of the Righteous\n\nBy: A. W.

C. Ryle's most effective tracts on the leading truths of Christianity, which are, as he says, \"necessary to salvation.\" In including in such a series Inspiration, Election, and Perseverance, he allows that good Christians have disagreed and will still disagree about them, but he inserts them nevertheless on account of the immense importance of the first and the extraordinary neglect into which the last two have fallen. Ryle's racy style, plainspokenness, and good taste are sure to secure your affection and hold your attention.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nAmazing\n\nBy dcp on 07-17-20\n\nEnjoying God\n\nFinding Hope in the Attributes of God\n\nBy: R.

The year is 1526. It is the age of Henry VIII and his tragic Anne Boleyn, of Martin Luther and Thomas More. The times are treacherous. The Catholic Church controls almost every aspect of English life, including access to the very Word of God.
