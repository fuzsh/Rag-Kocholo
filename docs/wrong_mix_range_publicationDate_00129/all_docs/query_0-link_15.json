        "text": "Wittgenstein & Hemingway, #2 Limitationism, Philosophy, and Illustration through Fiction\n\n(Part One can be found at Hemingway & Wittgenstein #1 The Wound and the Bow, Absence and Insight)\n\nThe Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus famously ends\n\n6.54 My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them -- as steps -- to climb up beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.)\n\nHe must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright.\n\n'7 What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.'\n\nIn the preface of the Tractatus, written long after the main text was finished, Wittgenstein emphasizes the importance of his ending to his whole work.\n\nThe whole sense of the book might be summed up in the following words: what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence.\n\nThus the aim of the books is to draw a limit to thought, or rather -- not to thought, but the expression of thoughts: for in order to be able to draw a limit to thought, who should have to find both sides of the limit thinkable (i.e. we should have to be able to think what cannot be thought).\n\nIt will therefore only be in language that the limit can be drawn and what lies on the other side of the limit will simply be non-sense.\n\nThus in the Tractatus there is a sense, in which the work begins and ends at the same place.\n\nThere is every indication that Wittgenstein himself gave a 'mystical' interpretation to these words, or, to put it in another way, what was beyond the limit of expression of thought could be 'felt' or 'experienced' but not expressed in language. Wittgenstein believed that there might be something 'beyond' the limit of thought, but he also thought that he could show that in order to define the limit of anything, (i.e. what is beyond the bounds of any system of expression) you would have to get to the 'other side' of those boundaries, which is impossible when the boundaries themselves cannot be thought from within the system of expression.\n\nThis mode of argument is actually easily understood by reference to a popular book often given to young math students. I am thinking of Edwin Abbott's Flatland: A Romance in Many Dimensions (Read Flatland at this link). In that wonderful geometrical satire the narrator is a two-dimensional square who is unable to think or understand the third dimension. In fact Square is unable to even perceive three-dimensional objects. Three-dimensional objects are like gods to him. Square is able to have un-expressible experiences of what is beyond his normal two dimensions but those experiences can not be translated into thoughts expressible in either formal or the everday language of the Flatlanders. Of particular interest here is Chapter 16, How the Stranger Vainly Endeavoured To Reveal to Me in Words the Mysteries of Spaceland. In this chapter a Sphere 'enters' Flatland and tries to explain the world of Spaceland to the two-dimensional Square. The notions that the Sphere tries to explain to the Square are of course incomprehensible to the Square. But in the very next chapter the Square is able to experience Spaceland, without comprehending it, or being able to explain it adequately to himself or as it turns out to his fellow citizens of Flatland. One of the problems that all of Wittgenstein's philosophy is trying to put into rigorous form are the same notions that Edwin Abbott is trying to illustrate through narrative in Flatland. (The difference between illustration and a more or less formal system of expression is important, thus I wish the reader to keep in mind the fact that I am using Flatland as illustration and not as formal expression of the limitationist claim.)\n\nGiven that human thought is limited, and given that we can only think from within these limits, there is no way that we can think both sides of the limit. Readers of this web log will recognize this as another expression of the limitationist thesis of human knowledge. But they may also recognize another theme that has been a constant in my journals, the theme of the paradox of boundaries that haunt all aspects of human thought, for example as expressed in my little note The Edge of the Universe: Lucretius, Einstein, the Limits of Knowledge. (Also see Evolution, 'Self-Transcendent Belief Systems' where I give Chomsky's definition of the limitationist claim. It is important to note how often these paradoxes repeat in the history of human thought. A partial list would include variations on 'the Liars Paradox,' paradoxes of human choice, and of notions of intentionality and reference. The more important examples I think come fromt the history of mathematics and science. Russell's Paradox in set theory, the notion of limit in calculus, the use of the idea of 'absolute space' in physics, etc.) Part of my proposition is that much of what we call 'modernism' and 'post-modernism' in philosophy, literature, and criticism is simply a more or less self-conscious probing of these paradoxes of boundaries and limits. It is also my thesis that these paradoxes are not in fact 'unexplainable' it is just that from within whatever system we meet up with these paradoxes they can't be explained with the tools of that system. Sometimes there is simply a limit that we reach which is the boundary of expressible thought of the system. The problem comes when that system is human thought itself.\n\nHuman thought is expressible in many forms, natural language, formal systems of logic and mathematics, or various kinds of artistic expression. The boundaries of the expression of thought in language and mathematics are simply the limits of those systems. Knowledge is one form of experience but it is not the only form of experience. (Not all experience is knowledge but all knowledge is a form of experience.) To put it simplistically, knowledge is a limited form of experience, which is distinguishable from other forms of experience because it is expressible in a more or less formal system. In this case I am using the term 'formal system' very loosely. When compared with most expressions in the world of mammals (for instance cries of alarm like the signals for 'snake' and 'hawk' among some primates) human natural language is a formal system. But a natural language is not as rigorous as mathematics or Fregean systems of formal language or attempts at rigor within physics, which to some extent, tend toward the definitional quality of a formal language. But something more complicated happens in literature and art because the boundaries of the work of art must be evaluated in several ways. For my purposes in these philosophical reflections the two most important ways to evaluate a work of art are the 'frame' of the work given to it by the artist and the 'experience' of the work by the viewer or reader.\n\nThe great narrators of the modernist tradition such as Hemingway in his short stories and Nabokov in his great works, Lolita, Pale Fire, and, Ada, or Ardor : A Family Chronicle often reveal the frame while hiding the frame's intricacies. There is the obvious frame of the novel itself but there is also the frame that is delimited from within. In effect what we see as readers of these works is the two-dimensional frame but not the three and four-dimensional frame that the author constructed in the story. The frame becomes an absence within the work that the good reader can only experience, yet is unable to define by remaining within the limits of the whole of the work of art. Writers such as Nabokov deliberately constructed their novels so that the reader could experience the internal frame without seeing it, unless the novel was reassembled from without after many re-readings. In many ways Nabokov's strictly philosophical reasons for doing this was to put both the characters he invented and the reader that pays good attention to the novel in the same position that Wittgenstein believed that human beings were in relation to human thought. (For a good attempt at an explanation of how Nabokov's fiction work I would suggest Nabokov's Pale Fire: The Magic of Artistic Discovery by Brian Boyd. I only wish that Mr. Boyd would write a short essay on what Nabokov was trying to do in Pale Fire, In the end, we don't know how works of art 'work' as experience, how they give us a new sense of 'experience,' but what I take as the most important aspect of art is this experiential side to the work, that the work gives us that is beyond what can be formally expressed.\n\nWhat Wittgenstein was trying to do through out his philosophical career is show the limits of language or, what in his later philosophy he called more broadly, language-games. He concentrated on the thinkable aspects of 'propositions about the world' (in the early philosophy) and language-games (in the late philosophy). He was not trying to show the limits of what could be 'experienced' as a whole. Thinking is only a small portion of 'experience as a whole.' What he was trying to show was the limits of what was 'thinkable' from within a system,. He was not trying to show the limits of what could be experienced as a human being. In respect to what may be called Wittgenstein's 'art' he in fact trying to illustrate something very similar to what both Nabokov and Hemingway were trying to illustrate -- he was illustrating what could not be expressed.\n\nWittgenstein himself tried to show this to his first readers: I quote his letter to a friend and potential publisher of Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus written in November 1919, not long after Wittgenstein's return from a prisoner of war camp.\n\n\"In reality... the point of the book is ethical. I once wanted to give a few words in the forward which now actually are not in it, which, however, I'll write to you now because they might be a key for you: I wanted to write that my work consists of two parts: of the one which is here, and of everything which I have not written. And precisely this second part is the important one. For the Ethical is delimited from within, as it were, by my book; and I'm convinced that, strictly speaking, it can ONLY be delimited in this way. In brief, I think: All of that which many are bubbling today, I have defined in my book by remaining silent about it.\" (Quoted in Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius by Ray Monk p. 178.\n\nFrom what I said above, the reader may guess that I believe that the best illustration of Wittgenstein's way of 'delimiting from within' among modern novelists can be found in the works of Vladimir Nabokov. But Nabokov is as intricate and as complicated as Wittgenstein himself, more so in fact. Thus by way of illustration I prefer to use first Edwin Abbott but more prominently Ernest Hemingway. I also think that there is something psychologically similar between the nortoriously introverted Wittgenstein and the raucously extroverted Hemingway. The psychological similarity between the two, I hope, will point the way toward how we can think historically about the ideas and the wounds that provided the historical experience which made the ideas accessible as a certain tendency of thought among writers, both novelists and philosophers.\n\nFor now I would like to leave the reader with two quotes from Hemingway and a final note on 'the dangers of illustration.'\n\nIn Death in the Afternoon, Hemingway outlined his \"theory of omission\".\" He states:\n\n\"If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of the iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. The writer who omits things because he does not know them only makes hollow places in his writing.\"\n\nIn A Farewell to Arms Hemingway writes of his character's relation to language and specifically of his relation to certain hollow words.\n\nI was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and sacrifice and the expression in vain. We had heard them, sometimes standing in the rain almost out of earshot, so that only the shouted words came through, and had read them, on proclamations that were slapped up by billposters over other proclamations, now for a long time, and I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it. There were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places had dignity. Certain numbers were the same way and certain dates and these with the names of the places were all you could say and have them mean anything. Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene besides the concrete names of villages, the numbers of roads, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates. Gino was a patriot, so he said things that separated us sometimes, but he was also a fine boy and I understood his being a patriot. He was born one. He left with Peduzzi in the car to go back to Gorizia.\n\nFinally, by using Hemingway, Nabokov and Abbott in reference to Wittgenstein, I am simply trying to illustrate something about the 'limitationist' thesis of human knowledge, that I will try to define more rigorously later. But when ever illustrating something or drawing a picture of something we both produce a deficit and a surplus. Bertrand Russell, when writing about the structure of the atom and the theories upon which atomic structure is based said something that we should keep in mind.\n\n\"The theory of atomic structure... like everything else in theoretical physics, is capable of expression in mathematical formulae; but like many things in theoretical physics it is also capable of expression in the form of an imaginative picture.... When we consider the nature of the evidence upon which the above theory of the atom is based, we can see that the attempt to make a picture of what goes on has led us to be far more concrete than we have any right to be. If we want to assert only what we have good reason to believe, we shall have to abandon the attempt to be concrete...\" (In Bertrand Russell, An Outline of Philosophy p. 83.)\n\nWhat we run up against, once again, when we try to provide an illustration for something, which can only be said with utmost accuracy more formally, is the difference between knowledge as a limited experience, and all that we are able to experience beyond our more or less formal systems of knowledge. It is the same limitation that Abbott's Square runs up against in the difference between the attempt to understand, in formal language, the difference between the two dimensional world and the three dimensional world. The Square in Flatland has three possibilities: He can experience the three dimensional world or describe it accurately in the formal language of his two-dimensional concepts. The other alternative is to try to draw a picture or make an illustration of the three dimensional world with his two dimensional tools. This will end up being an attempt to bring his experience of three dimensional Spaceworld into the two dimensional world of Flatland. But in making this attempt the illustration will loose something in preciseness and accuracy and also loose something of the Square's original experience of Spaceworld. On the other hand the mere attempt to make an illustration will also gain something for the world of Flatland. The 'stronger' the artisitic attempt the more the more the potential surplus of experiential gain will be through the use of the imagination. The Square's attempt to make an illustration will itself become an experience with its own rules and imaginative possibilities, an experience that was not there in the first place, an experience not only for the Square, but also for others in Flatland.\n\nJerry Monaco\n\nNew York\n\n23 March 2005\n\nShandean Postscripts to Politics, Philosophy & Culture\n\nHopeful Monsters: Poetry, Fiction, Memories by Jerry Monaco\n\nTechnorati Profile for Shandean Postscripts\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons License."
