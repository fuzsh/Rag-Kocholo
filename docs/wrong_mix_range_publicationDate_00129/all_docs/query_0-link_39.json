        "text": "The Metamorphosis\n\nBy Franz Kafka, Stanley Corngold (translator),\n\nFrom my list on seeing the world how it’s never been seen before.\n\nBy Luke Coulter Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nGrowing up in Ireland with a lot of Pink Floyd records, an active imagination, and no TV, I was almost destined to have a seemingly endless number of questions about the universe, our existence, and the purpose of it all. Finding that much could be learned from the tip of a pen (including that blue flavor is the best one) I began to read and make shapes and draw words of my own. Then, questioning the reasons I had questions, and seeking what could not be found, I found the answer to a single one—that there is far more to this world than we can ever see, and we indeed, are not alone.\n\nLuke's book list on seeing the world how it’s never been seen before\n\nWhy did Luke love this book?\n\nHis physicality transformed, Gregor awakes no longer a man, but instead, a giant grotesque creature.\n\nAs I read this masterpiece, I too understood how it is, to appear not how I desire. To sound different, to look different, to appear different than the paragon of myself I have created in my mind. And to strive to be more than this body I inhabit can give. But is this not the condition of us all?\n\nA truly brilliant Kafka, this book created a world that is my own, yet unreal, and my reality yet a waking dream.\n\nBy Franz Kafka, Stanley Corngold (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n7 authors picked The Metamorphosis as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 13, 14, 15, and 16.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin.”\n\nWith this startling, bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first sentence, Kafka begins his masterpiece, The Metamorphosis. It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetlelike insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing—though absurdly comic—meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century…\n\nPreview\n\nSurvivor\n\nBy Chuck Palahniuk,\n\nFrom my list on darkly humorous fiction stocking fillers.\n\nBy Guy Portman Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a dark fiction author. As far back as anyone can remember I have been an introverted creature, with a rapacious appetite for knowledge, a dark sense of humour, and an insatiable appetite for books. Having written eight darkly humorous works of fiction and read dozens of titles that fall into this genre, I believe that I am the ideal person to provide you with recommendations for darkly humorous fiction stocking fillers this Christmas. Think of me as the Santa of darkly humorous fiction. My titles include theNecropolis Series. Their protagonist is Dyson Devereux – a cultured council worker and compulsive murderer with sardonic tendencies.\n\nGuy's book list on darkly humorous fiction stocking fillers\n\nWhy did Guy love this book?\n\nTender Branson, the last survivor of the Creedish Church cult, has hijacked an airplane, which is flying on autopilot. His mission now is to dictate his life story onto its black box before the plane crashes.\n\nSurvivor is an innovative and erudite social commentary, brimming with satirical observations. Amongst the targets for its irreverent dark humour are death, The Bible, and suicide hotlines. In this reader’s opinion, Survivor is a work of undoubted genius, and one of the author’s best novels.\n\nBy Chuck Palahniuk,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Survivor as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTender Branson-last surviving member of the Creedish Death Cult-is dictating his life story into the recorder of Flight 2039, cruising on autopilot at 39,000 feet somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. He is all alone in the airplane, which will crash shortly into the vast Australian outback.

As far back as anyone can remember I have been an introverted creature, with a rapacious appetite for knowledge, a dark sense of humour, and an insatiable appetite for books. Having written eight darkly humorous works of fiction and read dozens of titles that fall into this genre, I believe that I am the ideal person to provide you with recommendations for darkly humorous fiction stocking fillers this Christmas. Think of me as the Santa of darkly humorous fiction. My titles include theNecropolis Series. Their protagonist is Dyson Devereux – a cultured council worker and compulsive murderer with sardonic tendencies.\n\nGuy's book list on darkly humorous fiction stocking fillers\n\nWhy did Guy love this book?\n\nSkagboys is the prequel to Trainspotting. Its colourful cast of characters hails from the Edinburgh port suburb of Leith. The book is set in the 1980s against a backdrop of HIV, Thatcherism, and the rise of dance music. The extensive employment of Scottish vernacular makes traversing this tome (548 pages) challenging but rewarding.\n\nI was mesmerised by the lurid descriptions, dark humour, diverse prose, and the memorable, amoral characters. Skagboys will appeal to all fans of darkly humorous fiction and transgressive fiction.\n\nBy Irvine Welsh,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Skagboys as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nMark Renton has it all: he's good-looking, young, with a pretty girlfriend and a place at university. But there's no room for him in the 1980s. Thatcher's government is destroying working-class communities across Britain, and the post-war certainties of full employment, educational opportunity and a welfare state are gone. When his family starts to fracture, Mark's life swings out of control and he succumbs to the defeatism which has taken hold in Edinburgh's grimmer areas. The way out is heroin.\n\nIt's no better for his friends. Spud Murphy is paid off from his job, Tommy Lawrence feels himself being sucked…\n\nPreview\n\nKnockemstiff\n\nBy Donald Ray Pollock,\n\nFrom my list on darkly humorous fiction stocking fillers.\n\nBy Guy Portman Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a dark fiction author. As far back as anyone can remember I have been an introverted creature, with a rapacious appetite for knowledge, a dark sense of humour, and an insatiable appetite for books. Having written eight darkly humorous works of fiction and read dozens of titles that fall into this genre, I believe that I am the ideal person to provide you with recommendations for darkly humorous fiction stocking fillers this Christmas.

Their protagonist is Dyson Devereux – a cultured council worker and compulsive murderer with sardonic tendencies.\n\nGuy's book list on darkly humorous fiction stocking fillers\n\nWhy did Guy love this book?\n\nThese interlinked short stories are set in ‘The Holler’; an impoverished part of Knockemstiff, an Ohioan backwater. The book’s lengthy timeline (mid-60s – late 90s) allows the reader to revisit the same people at different stages in their lives. This compelling aspect lends the compilation a cohesion that is so often lacking in short story collections.\n\nThe grubby setting, visceral prose, and dark humour are a potent combination. I would not hesitate in recommending these authentic tales of the underclass.\n\nBy Donald Ray Pollock,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Knockemstiff as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBlunt, brutal, but infused with a deep sympathy, Knockemstiff is a pitch-dark and hilarious collection of stories set in a tiny town in Southern Ohio.\n\nThe youth of Knockemstiff grow up in the malignant shadow of their parents; raised on abuse, alcohol, drugs and cigarettes, they are stunted in every possible way: emotionally, mentally, sometimes physically. They talk a lot about escape but they never so much as cross the county line.\n\nPreview\n\nTale of Kasaya\n\nBy Eva Kasaya,\n\nFrom my list on astonishing idealism and survival in East Africa.\n\nBy Harriet Levin Millan Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhen I first met Michael Majok Kuch and he asked me if I was interested in writing his life story, I knew nothing about South Sudan. Over the next several years, we met weekly. I’d interview him, write a chapter, research it, and then show it to him for his approval. I read everything I could find on South Sudan and the adjacent countries. In fact, I became so obsessed with Michael's culture that once I read Francis Mading Deng's Dinka Folktales, Mike’s sister arranged a meeting between Francis Mading Deng and me. These books prepared me for writing How Fast Can You Run, helping other “Lost Boys” of Sudan reunite with their mothers.\n\nHarriet's book list on astonishing idealism and survival in East Africa\n\nWhy did Harriet love this book?\n\nI was fortunate to have met Eva Kasaya at a writing retreat in Kenya shortly after she wrote this book. Part novel, part biography, Tale of Kasaya is the astonishing story of Eva Kasaya’s journey from a 13-year-old village girl in rural Kenya to a published author in Nairobi. Kasaya, who leaves her family’s farm for a job as a domestic worker in the city recounts the horrific situation some domestic workers undergo. Sexually assaulted, she overcomes her trauma and finds solace in the written word. A beautifully written book that deserves to be a classic.\n\nBy Eva Kasaya,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Tale of Kasaya as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nSpeaking with Vampires\n\nBy Luise White,\n\nFrom my list on (real-life) monsters.\n\nBy Benjamin Radford Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by monsters. Growing up I saw television shows and read books about famous ones like Bigfoot and Nessie, and always wanted to search for them and discover the truth. That led me to a degree in psychology to learn about human cognition and perception, and a career in folklore to understand how legends and rumors spread. But I also wanted field experience, and spent time at Loch Ness, in Canadian woods said to house Sasquatch, to the Amazon, Sahara, and the jungles of Central America looking for the chupacabra. Along the way became an author, writing books including Tracking the Chupacabra, Lake Monster Mysteries, Big—If True, and Investigating Ghosts.\n\nBenjamin's book list on (real-life) monsters\n\nWhy did Benjamin love this book?\n\nAmong all the world’s monsters one perennial favorite is vampires.\n\nYes, I know they’ve been done to death (or would that be undeath?) but there’s a rich history of vampires beyond Dracula, Nosferatu, Lestat, and their legions. I’m talking about “real” vampires—or at least those people believed to be real vampires.\n\nThis is the subject of Luise White’s book Speaking with Vampires: Rumor and History in Colonial Africa. White is an anthropologist and folklorist who investigated rumors of vampires throughout East Africa. She found that many Africans told similar stories of real, actual vampires that sucked the blood out of Africans.\n\nWhat I love about this book is how White takes a scholarly approach to the rumors of (alleged) real-life vampires, sometimes from their victims. Along the way we learn about colonialism, racism, and the cultural contexts in which these rumors flourish.\n\nBy Luise White,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Speaking with Vampires as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nDuring the colonial period, Africans told each other terrifying rumors that Africans who worked for white colonists captured unwary residents and took their blood. In colonial Tanganyika, for example, Africans were said to be captured by these agents of colonialism and hung upside down, their throats cut so their blood drained into huge buckets. In Kampala, the police were said to abduct Africans and keep them in pits, where their blood was sucked. Luise White presents and interprets vampire stories from East and Central Africa as a way of understanding the world as the storytellers did. Using gossip and rumor…\n\nPreview\n\nToo Close to the Sun\n\nBy Sara Wheeler,\n\nFrom my list on memoirs and biographies for the mature reader.\n\nBy Stevie Turner Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have always had an interest in reading factual information about other people’s lives. I am a realist, and prefer reading non-fiction that is true. I am especially interested in reading inspirational stories from people that have overcome adversity, illness, or discrimination.\n\nStevie's book list on memoirs and biographies for the mature reader\n\nWhy did Stevie love this book?\n\nI enjoyed Too Close to the Sun by Sara Wheeler. This book focused on the free spirit and playboy that was Denys George Finch Hatton, portrayed by Robert Redford in the film Out of Africa. Denys was from an upper-class family and lived an unconventional life according to his own rules. He is buried in the Ngong Hills, Nairobi, where he loved to spend his time hunting. He is a perfect example of doing what you want to do and not having to worry about money.\n\nBy Sara Wheeler,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Too Close to the Sun as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nConservationist, scholar, soldier, white hunter and fabled lover - Denys Finch Hatton was an aristocrat of leonine nonchalance. After a dazzling career at Eton and Oxford, he sailed in 1910 for British East Africa - still then the land of the pioneer. Sara Wheeler reveals the truth behind his love affairs with the glamorous aviatrix Beryl Markham, and - famously - with Karen Blixen, a romance immortalised in her memoir Out of Africa.\n\n'No one who ever met him', his Times obituary concluded, 'whether man or woman, old or young, white or black, failed to come under his spell'.\n\nPreview\n\nA Primate's Memoir\n\nBy Robert M. Sapolsky,\n\nWhy did Anthony love this book?\n\nFunny and wise in equal measure, A Primate’s Memoir is a window on baboon social dynamics with plenty of forays into the world of safari tourism that he observes from askance. Sapolsky has since gone on to become one of the science world’s keenest observers of human behaviour, and his portrayals of baboon and human interactions are priceless.\n\nBy Robert M. Sapolsky,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked A Primate's Memoir as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn the tradition of Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey, Robert Sapolsky, a foremost science writer and recipient of a MacArthur Genius Grant, tells the mesmerizing story of his twenty-one years in remote Kenya with a troop of Savannah baboons.\n\n“I had never planned to become a savanna baboon when I grew up; instead, I had always assumed I would become a mountain gorilla,” writes Robert Sapolsky in this witty and riveting chronicle of a scientist’s coming-of-age in remote Africa.\n\nAn exhilarating account of Sapolsky’s twenty-one-year study of a troop of rambunctious baboons in Kenya, A Primate’s Memoir interweaves serious scientific…\n\nPreview\n\nThe End of the Game\n\nBy Peter Beard,\n\nWhy did Errol love this book?\n\nPeter Beard settled in Kenya in the late 1950s and became obsessed with the plight of wildlife in Africa. The book is full of evocative photos that he took over a period of some 20 years – some of them absolutely tragic. It is not a book for the faint-hearted; but it tells with truth the stories of explorers, entrepreneurs, big game hunters, and missionaries.\n\nIt has been published in several editions and formats. The copy I have is a large paperback that dates from 1989, but there are editions that were produced before that time and many that have been published since.\n\nThis book is certainly not an attempt to be gently persuasive, and the author’s position can be summed up in these words that he wrote:\n\nWhen I first escaped to East Africa in August 1955…it was one of the heaviest wildlife areas…in the world…No one then could…\n\nBy Peter Beard,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The End of the Game as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis book describes the origins, history, and prospects of big game in Africa.Researched, photographed, and compiled over 20 years, Peter Beard's \"End of the Game\" tells the tale of the enterprisers, explorers, missionaries, and big-game hunters whose quests for adventure and \"progress\" were to change the face of Africa in the 20th century. This landmark volume is assembled from hundreds of historical photographs and writings, starting with the building of the Mombasa Railroad (\"The Lunatic Line\") and the opening-up of darkest Africa. The stories behind the heroic figures in Beard's work - Theodore Roosevelt, Frederick Courtney Selous, Karen Blixen (Isak…\n\nPreview"
