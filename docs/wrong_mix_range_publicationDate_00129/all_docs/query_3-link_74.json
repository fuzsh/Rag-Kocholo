        "text": "We’ve all heard the statistics about how hard it is to make it as an artist: only 17% of artists earn their living exclusively from selling art, there is high competition for art jobs, and the cost of art school can be prohibitive. But we don’t think those statistics accurately reflect the opportunities that exist today. The art industry is thriving and is a great place for dedicated, creative people to find meaningful work.\n\nWe’re here to help you navigate this sometimes difficult road from aspiring artist to successful professional. Not all artists are cut from the same mold and there are many different paths that can lead to rewarding careers depending on your personal interests, talents, and skills.\n\nArt is an expansive field with many sub-categories, each with its own unique demands and opportunities. Some artists are better suited to traditional fine art methods while others thrive in digital or graphic arts; some find fulfillment primarily as teachers, educators, curators, writers, producers, etc. Still, others prefer careers primarily behind the scenes in administrative positions. Below is a list of some of the most popular careers in art.\n\nThe field of Craft and Fine Art attracts those who enjoy the process of creating tangible objects. From glassblowers to graphic designers, crafters and fine artists love working with their hands so they can discover and create beauty in everyday life. Craft and Fine Art is all about the creation of art. This can take many forms, like pottery, painting, sculpture, leatherworking, etc. There is a wide range of crafts and fine arts that fall under this career path, and there are numerous paths you can take to get into the field.\n\nThe culinary world is a diverse and expansive one with highly skilled professionals. Opportunities for culinary professionals are vast with a range of career paths from line cooks in a restaurant to chefs at the helm of their own kitchens. What makes for a successful culinary professional? A passion for cooking and creativity, an exceptional work ethic, and enjoyment of meeting challenges are just some of the qualities that make for success.\n\nDigital artists use a wide range of computer software to create graphics, animation, and special effects for websites, videos, computer games, and other electronic media. They come from a variety of backgrounds in Art & Design fields such as illustration, graphic design, painting, photography, animation, video production, and music.\n\nThe demand for digital artists is growing exponentially as the world continues to become more technology-driven. Digital art is now being incorporated into web design, graphic design, motion graphics, product design, video games, and much more.\n\nIf you dream of a life in the theater, there are many career options available to help make that happen. From acting and directing to stagehands and set designers, there is a diverse range of jobs available to those dedicated to the arts. If you’re a performer at heart, there is an abundance of opportunities working on stage, television, movies, and even the internet. If you prefer to work behind the scenes or in front of a camera instead of on stage, there are also plenty of opportunities to do that, too.\n\nThe fashion industry is a vast, exciting place to work. It includes everything from the clothing that people wear, down to the stitching of each thread. And while most people know that it takes designers and models to make the world of fashion possible, there are many different types of careers in this field that require different backgrounds and skillsets.\n\nMost people who work in fashion are involved in the actual designing of clothing, but there are many careers in this industry that have nothing to do with actual clothing design.
