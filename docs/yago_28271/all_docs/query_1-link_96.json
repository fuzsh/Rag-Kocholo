        "text": "Can established brands still be challengers? Or is this easy to say but hard to do within big organisations with lots of red tape? Covid-19 had a number of businesses acting like start-ups, but many have since largely returned to their old ways. Did many, or any, maintain a challenger mindset? Or learn anything insightful from how they operated during early pandemic years? Are any still acting agile as a result? If so, how? Our network replied… Thank you, Cherry Ye (Msc), Rasika Narang, Catrin Kite, Stephanie Thomas, Aimee Luther, Adam Knott, Laura Tannenbaum, Eve Lily Young, Suzana Lay, Diu Hoang\n\nFor this podcast, we had a guest host, regular contributor to the magazine, author and co-founder of Genius Steals, Faris Yakob, take control. His guest was VP of Creative at Liquid Death, Andy Pearson. They discuss Liquid Death’s creative process and how not getting bogged down in details helps creatively, as long as everyone agrees that what they’re doing is a good idea and can be brought to life.\n\nIn this podcast our Editor Mike Piggott chats to regular MediaCat Magazine contributor, Emily Fairhead-keen, Senior Strategy Partner at Wavemaker who, in her career, has also worked at MediaCom, Vizeum and Starcom MediaVest. They talk about an award-winning paper Emily wrote in 2015 (and subsequent MediaCat article), where she made the argument that brands need to be more superhuman and godlike. They also discuss brands and showmanship, fairies and superman, oversharing and mystery, how it’s OK for brands not to jump on trends, and how Jeremy Bullmore once offered her a cup of tea.\n\nWorldwide digital advertising spend is increasing every year, but ad blocking is also on the rise. So with our July theme of ‘Fame and Attention’ we thought we’d ask our network, from a marketing and strategic point of view, how should brands best capture our attention. Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Wander Bruijel (Born Ugly), Bex B. (Golley Slater), Oliver Kerr-D'Souza (Wake The Bear), Layla Soufi (VIOOH), Ben Foster (The Kite Factory), Anton Jerges (We Are Collider), Heather Stewart (Household), Craig Miles (SuperHeroes AMS | NYC | SGP), Peter Wilson (Iris), Jenny Stanley (Appetite Creative), David Juul Ledstrup (Kubbco - Creative Agency), Anna Cremin (Pearl & Dean), Tom Bellamy (SocialChain), Jack Colchester (Wonderhood Studios) and Maor Ofek (SIDE ST)"
