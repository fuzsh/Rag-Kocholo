        "text": "Guy Stuart Ritchie (born 10 September 1968) is an English screenwriter and film maker who directed Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, RocknRolla, Revolver and Sherlock Holmes.\n\nRitchie was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, the second of two children born to Amber (n√©e Parkinson) and Captain John Vivian Ritchie (b. 1928), former Seaforth Highlanders serviceman and advertising executive. John Vivian's father, was Major Stewart Ritchie, who died in France, in 1940, during World War Two. John Ritchie's mother was Doris Margaretta McLaughlin (b. 1896), daughter of Vivian Guy McLaughlin (b. 1865) and Edith Martineau (b. 1866). Most of Guy's family on the McLaughlin and Martineau lines were appointed Reverends, Barons or Knighted at some point. The peerage started with the Very Rev. Hubert McLaughlin (b. 1805), father of famous nurse Louisa McLaughlin and ancestor of Patrick McLaughlin who was the first in his direct family to be given the according title, as he was born into a blue collar family and worked hard to find nobility. Ritchie's mother, Amber, would later go on to marry a baronet herself.\n\nRitchie, who is dyslexic, was expelled from Stanbridge Earls School, one of the most prominent institutions specialising in dyslexia in the UK, at the age of 15. He has stated that drug use was the reason for the expulsion; his father has said that it was because his son was caught \"cutting class and entertaining a girl in his room.\" He also attended Sibford School."
