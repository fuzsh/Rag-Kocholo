        "text": "I love Guy Ritchie’s style of editing (or edit-directing) and wonder why there isn’t more of it out there? I do not recall seeing another film with the same maximal visual post-manipulation style.\n\nDoes anyone know of any movies or music videos out there with the same style? Or if there is an editor or two that consistently dabbles in this style? Please let me know.\n\nI would love to discuss this. Thanks for any input anyone may have.\n\nI’m sure Guy’s editors Niven Howie, Jon Harris, et al would LOVE to hear you call it “the GUY RITCHIE style…”\n\nLOL\n\nI know what you mean. Well, his is pretty unique. People try to imitate it, but they are all flash and no substance. CRANK was one where I noticed they tried that a little.\n\nShane\n\nGETTING ORGANIZED WITH FINAL CUT PRO DVD…don’t miss it.\n\nRead my blog, Little Frog in High Def\n\nWell that’s the thing- they are individual editors, but the style evolves (somewhat consistently) in each of Guy Ritchie’s film, so it is rightfully his, even if we have to call it edit-directing. Also there are in-camera effects that we cannot ignore, and the editors are not responsible for that.\n\nI wonder why there are not more imitators, is it because of the degree of difficulty in capturing that style? Does one have to have a feel for it?\n\nThanks..\n\nYou should check out the films of Tony Scott. He’s the master of this fancy stuff. Domino and Man on Fire are like watching a thunderstorm of cuts and SFX. Great fun for the popcorn crowd, usually looked down upon by the film snobs.\n\nIt’s all related to the cinematography, of course. A high shutter speed, hand held shooting style showing an action-packed scene lends itself to more stylized cuts. Check out Hot Fuzz and BBC’s Top Gear for ultimate whiz-bang pazazz.\n\nPeople often say “great editing” when I incorporate these things, but that’s usually because it’s the only time you can “see” the editing. No one ever says “great editing” when they laugh or feel anxious. Not fair!!\n\ni would say it’s because no one wants too. there aren’t that many movies made in this genre, the ones im thinking of right now are Ocean’s 11,12,13. I really think this is his niche, i saw a bmw commercial he did (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1dYv_gKTA8) and it is exactly his style. He is truly talented, writing and directing all of his movies.\n\nSome contents or functionalities here are not available due to your cookie preferences!\n\nThis happens because the functionality/content marked as “Google Youtube” uses cookies that you choosed to keep disabled.

Separate elements that make up a whole? A genre? Could he be said to have started a movement like French New Wave? I doubt it; on the surface, he’s obviously influenced by Scorsese and Tarantino so can he really lay claim to a style or genre himself?\n\nWhat if it there were a romantic comedy done in his style? Would you be able to say it looks like a Guy Ritchie movie? Maybe, maybe not.\n\nIt’s difficult because we recognize his style on the surface but when you begin to analyze and quantify the elements that make up his movies what do you actually get? Not much that’s new."
