        "text": "He turned Will Smith into a cerulean genie for the 2019 live-action “Aladdin” and twice reimagined Sherlock Holmes as a swashbuckling rogue, to hefty box-office returns. As a filmmaker, though, Guy Ritchie has long been synonymous with sprawling ensemble pictures like “Snatch,” “The Gentlemen” and “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels”: laddish, kinetic crime capers larded with movie stars, bloodied knuckles and inscrutable Cockney accents. (The latest of such outings, an antic international spy lark called “Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre” featuring Jason Statham, Hugh Grant and Aubrey Plaza, arrived to middling fanfare this past March.)\n\nSo why is “Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant,” a somber-looking Afghanistan war drama about an American sergeant (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his Afghan interpreter (Dar Salim), the first of the director’s 15 features to formally bear his name? The answer, according to its U.S. distributor, MGM, turns out to be fairly prosaic: Another company had already asserted rights to the title. (“Lee Daniels’ The Butler,” produced by the Weinstein Company, faced a similar challenge in court from Warner Brothers in 2013 and lost, precipitating a hasty last-minute change.)\n\nBut this kind of déjà vu is hardly new: Broad-strokes monikers like “Crash,” “Heat\" and “Rush” have all done double duty over the last few decades; “Twilight” is the name of both a poorly received 1998 neo-noir starring Paul Newman and Susan Sarandon and the 2008 teen-vampire juggernaut that launched four fanged, lugubrious sequels, as well as a cult 1990 mystery by the Hungarian filmmaker György Fehér. (Ritchie might have called his latest‌ ‌ “The Interpreter” instead, had that appellation not already been claimed by a 2005 Sydney Pollack political thriller starring Nicole Kidman; so back, alas, to the drawing board.)\n\nIf the back story of “The Covenant” wanders into the weeds of copyright law, “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio,” which won the Academy Award for best animated feature last month, makes an easier case for its qualifier: Without it, the movie could hardly be set apart from both the 1940 Disney classic still widely seen as definitive and an uncanny remake led by Tom Hanks — it currently sits at a grim 29 percent approval rating on the critical-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes — released less than two months before.\n\nIn a larger sense, though, the inclusion of del Toro’s name also serves as shorthand and a promise, portending not only the age-old tale of a wooden boy made real but the particular vision of its maker — a lush, prolific fantasist famed for the distinctive visual style and dazzling gothic grotesqueries of films like “Pan’s Labyrinth” (2006) and the best picture-winning “The Shape of Water” (2017). That del Toro actually split directing duties for “his” “Pinocchio” with Mark Gustafson seems almost a footnote. Though Gustafson, an industry journeyman with a wide range of writing and animation credits (“Fantastic Mr. Fox,\" the original California Raisins), shared both the stage and the statuette with del Toro at this year’s Oscars ceremony, it’s the latter’s renown, by most Hollywood metrics, that matters.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
