Our monthly briefings are 'FREE' Want to join our mailing list ‚ùì ‚úâlee@supportsolutions.co.uk #briefings #industryinsight #industryknowledge\n\nDo you want someone to post your death on social media? In the newspaper? Email? How do you want to share the news? No preference? If you want it announced on your social media, does someone have access to your personal pages so they can share on your behalf? #eol #death\n\nNeed a little humor in your marketing? Check out Randy Glasbergen for assistance with that. And who hasn‚Äôt started a new job in the hole? This is all standard practice. üòÇüòÇüòÇ #humor #marketing #thinkbigger This is 100% Human Generated Content digging out of the hole that AI put you in.\n\nHow do you keep in touch with your clients or prospective clients? Do you rely solely on social media? Have you considered a regular newsletter or mailer to provide updates on your business and the products/services you can offer? #mailer #mailers #newsletters #clientcontact #clientcommunication\n\nLove it or hate it, social media is a crucial part of the advertising process today. Many prospective clients spend a long time scrolling social media while waiting. Some clients may be more willing to trust law firms with a visible and appropriate social media presence. RizeUp Media showcases how law firms who use social media to their advantage may find more work. https://lnkd.in/gsNiRFk5\n\nWhether your community association is already involved in social media or not, it is important to consider creating a social media policy for communications related to your board. Hear some tips from Dawn and Gabby on the importance of social media policies from Part 3 of our Communications 101 webinar series. #CommunityAssociations #AssociationLaw\n\nTwo of my favorite social media follows are Merriam-Webster and the National Parks Service, not because I'm a word nerd (I totally am) or because I'm outdoorsy (I'm absolutely not). It's because they leverage humor in a way that I find engaging, refreshing, and often unexpected. And because I keep coming back for the laughs, I'm also walking away with increased awareness of their brands, knowledge I often find valuable (or at least interesting), and I might even take an action I wouldn't have otherwise (like taking advantage of Free National Parks day). What could the power of humor do for your brand? Check out our latest blog post."
