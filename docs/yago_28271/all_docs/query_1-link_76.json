        "text": "As for the action sequences, there are plenty throughout the film’s two hour plus runtime. Fortunately, they’re very well directed and staged, each of them intense and visceral in equal measure. The camera work is never too chaotic or inconsistent, always nicely framed with handheld footage used at pivotal moments to enhance the action beats. The climactic action sequence in particular is a standout, sure to deliver the pulse-pounding thrills audiences have come to expect from Ritchie’s more action-heavy films.\n\nWhile the action set pieces and direction are certainly strong, the performances and character work are what help the film stand apart from many in its genre. The central performances from Gyllenhaal and Salim are phenomenal, the former a quiet, restrained powder keg that eventually blows when trying to help Ahmed from his U.S. home and the latter a warm, assured presence throughout. Salim delivers the goods, especially during his harrowing journey in trying to return Kinley to his military base. Ahmed is a man who wants retribution for the murder of his son, but a genuinely good man at his core with the will of five men combined who is still capable of breaking under immense physical and emotional duress. Gyllenhaal continues his run of stellar performances, knowing exactly when to dial his dramatic energy up and when to bring it down. The two are electric together and they’re worth seeing the film for alone.\n\nThe film gives an entirely new meaning to the phrase '“no man left behind”, delivering a story that shows the lengths these two men are willing to go in order to help one another. There’s a standout scene in which Kinley describes his debt to Ahmed as the feeling of a hook inside of him that he can feel constantly. Not only does Gyllenhaal perfectly perform the scene, but it drives home how powerful this covenant is between the two men. The film never hits the audience over the head with this message, letting the story and characters speak for themselves in order to do so. As a result, the film’s overall message and emotional impact land with a punch rather than a thud.\n\nHowever, the film isn’t perfect by any means. The script doesn’t provide any favors early on, with clunky dialogue and thinly drawn characters plaguing the first quarter of the film. Also, while the film is action-packed, the pacing is sluggish at best. The film is barely over two hours, but feels considerably longer due to a lack of momentum and energy. This is an issue that also plagued Wrath of Man, a lack of narrative energy hindering the story. Another pass in the editing room could’ve injected the film with the pacing it needed in order to truly stick its landing.\n\nWhile The Covenant isn’t Ritchie’s best film, it’s a refreshing departure for the stylish director that puts character and story far above visual style and panache. The two standout performances from Gyllenhaal and Salim, combined with some terrific action sequences and character work, make this film a worthwhile watch for fans of the director. It may not break the mold, but this is a story that is sure to inspire and entertain.\n\nGrade: [B+]"
