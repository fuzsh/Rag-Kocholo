        "text": "Guy Ritchie is an accomplished filmmaker who balances the art of telling cinematic character driven stories featuring humor, intricate plots, memorable dialogue, fresh visuals and unforgettable characters.\n\nRitchie is currently in post-production on Disney’s live- action feature film, “Aladdin,” which opens in theaters in 2019. Ritchie brings his dynamic directing style to this fresh adaptation starring Will Smith as the Genie, Mena Massoud as Aladdin, Naomi Scott as Princess Jasmine, Marwan Kenzari as Jafar.\n\nThe filmmaker will next begin production later this year on the feature film, “Toff Guys” which explores the collision between old money European wealth and the modern marijuana industrial complex with new gang entrants swarming. The film is financed by Miramax and Rocket Science.\n\nPrior to “Aladdin,” Ritchie directed the epic fantasy action adventure, “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,” which was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in 2017. Starring Charlie Hunman in the title role, the film is an iconoclastic take on the classic Excalibur myth, tracing Arthur’s journey from the streets to the throne. The screenplay is by Joby Harold and Ritchie & Lionel Wigram, story by David Dobkin and Harold. Ritchie also serves as producer with Wigram, Akiva Goldsman, Harold, Tory Tunnell, and Steve Clark-Hall. The cast also includes Jude Law, Astrid Berges-Frisbey, Djimon Hounsou, Aidan Gillen, and Eric Bana.\n\nOther recent credits include “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” which was released by Warner Bros. As well as producing the film, the screenplay was co-written by Ritchie and fellow producer Lionel Wigram. The film starred Henry Cavill as CIA Napoleon Solo and Armie Hammer as KGB agent Illya Kuryakin as the unlikely duo who become partners to stop a mysterious criminal organization. The film also featured Alicia Vikander, Elizabeth Debicki, Jared Harris and Hugh Grant.\n\nAdditional directing efforts for Ritchie include the acclaimed blockbusters, “Sherlock Holmes” and “Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.” Starring Robert Downey Jr. as the famed detective and Jude Law as his trusted colleague, Ritchie brought a fresh perspective to the legendary detective based on an original story/comic book by Lionel Wigram, inspired by the classic tales of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Released by Warner Bros., the films were produced by Joel Silver, Wigram, Susan Downey and Dan Lin.\n\nPrior to “Sherlock Holmes,” Ritchie wrote and directed “RocknRolla.” Among the film’s accolades, Ritchie won the Best British Film Award at the 2009 Empire Awards, and the film was selected to premiere at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. The action comedy takes a dangerous ride into high crime and low life in contemporary London, where real estate has supplanted drugs as the biggest market, and criminals are its most enthusiastic entrepreneurs. The stellar cast featured Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson, Thandie Newton, Mark Strong, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Toby Kebbell, Jeremy Piven and Chris “Ludacrs” Bridges. The film was produced by Joel Silver, Susan Downey, Steve Clark-Hall and Ritchie.\n\nRitchie began his career in Britain’s film industry in 1993 as a runner on Wardour Street, working his way up to a director of music videos and commercials. In 1995, he wrote and directed his first short film, “The Hard Case,” about four cockney guys raising money to enter a card game, which formed the basis for his first feature film.\n\nRitchie made his writing and directing feature film debut with “Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.” Made on a modest budget of $1 million and breathing new life into the genre, the film premiered at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival going on to become one of the UK’s biggest hits and remains a favorite. The film spotlighted Ritchie’s knack for casting and discovering talent launching the careers of several actors including Jason Statham. The film revolves around a young con man who loses £500,000 to a powerful crime lord in a rigged game of three-card brag. In order to pay off his debts, he and his friends decide to rob a small- time gang who happen to be operating out of the flat next door. The London Film Critics Circle named Ritchie the British Screenwriter of the Year for the film, which also received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best British Film.\n\nThis was followed by the 2000 hit “Snatch,” written and directed by Ritchie which won him the Empire Award for Best British Director. Set in the London criminal underworld, the film featured an ensemble cast of Jason Statham, Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones, Benicio del Toro and Brad Pitt as One Punch Mickey, an Irish Gypsy bare-knuckle boxer with The Last Supper tattooed on his back and a love for his mother though you can’t understand a word he says to her – or much of anything else he says.\n\nFollowing “Snatch” in 2002, Ritchie co-wrote and directed “Swept Away,” a remake of the 1974 Italian classic Travolti da un insolito destino nell’azzurro mare d’agost. Filmed in Sardinia and Malta, the locations white sands and rich colors of the surrounding sea provided a change of pace for Ritchie. The romantic comedy starred Madonna, Adriano Giannini, Bruce Greenwood, Elizabeth Banks and Jeanne Tripplehorn.\n\nRitchie continued to explore new challenges as a filmmaker with “Revolver,” an edgy film set in the world of fast- talking, sharp-suited criminals with a psychological twist that challenges if the greatest conman of all is the one trapped inside your mind. The film featured an all-star cast including Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore, Mark Strong and André Benjamin."
