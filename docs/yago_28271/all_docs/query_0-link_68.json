        "text": "Guy Ritchie came to film his war movie ‘The Covenant’, just three months after the tragic events on the’ Rust’ set, which changed how filmmakers approach using weapons on set.\n\nWhile filming the movie ‘Rust’, the cinematographer Halyna Hutchins passed away in an accident involving Alec Baldwin, who allegedly fired what he thought was a prop gun but turned out to be loaded.\n\nHe was charged with two counts of manslaughter, but the charges were dropped, and a new cinematographer was hired despite the sad news.\n\nGuy Ritchie’s approach to weapons on set\n\nBoth Ritchie and Jake Gyllenhaal, who’s no stranger to using guns on set, were both relieved to use a new system that involves Airsoft guns in ‘The Covenant’, which seem realistic but cannot pose a threat to any crew member.\n\n“We haven’t used a real weapon since then. So there were no real weapons. It’s the first shoot that we had, which I have to tell you, it’s a tremendous relief for all of us.”\n\n“They’re as good as, they look as good as real weapons, they do all the functions as a real weapon. You get a gas discharge. It all seems as authentic as it can be, but as Jake said, it’s Airsoft though. No one can get into any trouble.”\n\nHow he always felt about firearms\n\nThough Guy Ritchie has directed a number of films that use firearms, from his British gangster films, to ‘The Man from U.N.C.L.E.’ and the recent ‘Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre’, he claims that he always had some hesitations in using real ones."
