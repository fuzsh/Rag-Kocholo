        "text": "719\n\nOver the last decade, it’s been increasingly clear that Guy Ritchie has attempted to add more strings to his directorial bow with offerings from a range of genres. These include recent titles like Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, Aladdin, and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.\n\nThe latest release from the 54-year-old is Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant, an explosive action epic set in Afghanistan. This is one of the biggest breaks from Ritchie’s distinctive style so far, and it has gone down well with critics.\n\nRitchie Famous for London Gangster Offerings\n\nMany people are aware of Ritchie thanks to his early London-set gangster movies. He began his career with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in 1998, and followed this up in 2000 with Snatch. Both these pictures were met with critical acclaim and were lauded in the way that they redefined the British gangster genre.\n\nThe impact that Ritchie’s first two movies had on the industry can’t be overstated. He turned actors like Jason Statham, Stephen Graham, and Vinnie Jones into household names, and inspired many other films like Green Street and The Football Factory. It even spilled over into the world of gaming, with The Getaway and The Getaway: Black Monday clearly inspired by Ritchie’s work.\n\nThis influence is still apparent in offerings like The Stash, which is currently one of the top slots designed to attract bingo online players. In the game, players team up with a hardened band of London gangsters for a diamond heist. It can be found alongside bingo rooms, which also have themes associated with diamonds and gold.\n\nEven Ritchie realized, however, that he couldn’t stick to London gangster movies forever. He attempted to follow Lock, Stock and Snatch with Revolver and RocknRolla in 2005 and 2008 respectively, but both were flops in comparison to the first two films. This is why the English director has recently decided to broaden his horizons with different genres.\n\nAction Flick Set Mainly in Afghanistan\n\nGuy Ritchie’s The Covenant takes place thousands of miles away from the English capital and features an American actor in the lead. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Sgt. John Kinley, a soldier in Afghanistan. When on patrol, his unit is attacked by the Taliban. Kinley survives thanks to help from a local named Ahmed, who was serving as an interpreter. Kinley returns home and later discovers that Ahmed is being pursued by the Taliban. He then vows to return to Afghanistan to save him.\n\nThe picture was released in late April and received a positive response from critics. The cast and action scenes earned a lot of praise, and some publications noted how Ritchie managed to keep it grounded in reality in a straightforward tale. Some also noted how this is one of the biggest leaps away from Ritchie’s traditional directorial style.\n\nAfter initially making a name for himself as a master of the gangster genre, Ritchie may have found his new niche with war films. His latest offering could be up there with some of the best pictures he’s ever released, and it’s well worth a watch."
