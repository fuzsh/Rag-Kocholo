        "text": "Movie info\n\nBMW Films asked Guy Ritchie to direct a short movie as part of The Hire. Guy cast his wife Madonna as 'the star', though she was not mentioned in the credits.\n\nMovie synopsis\n\nThe Hire is a series of short movies, each in which the driver (Clive Owen) encounters some unexpected obstacles that put his abilities to the test. In Star, a superstar (Madonna) unexpectedly demands him to drive her to her venue. He calmly undergoes her humiliating behaviour, until he decides to take her demands a bit too literal...\n\nProduction info\n\nDirected by: Guy Ritchie\n\nWritten by: Guy Ritchie & Joe Sweet\n\nProduced by: Robyn Boardman, Nicole Dionne, David Fincher, Aristides McGarry, Tony McGarry\n\nProduction company: BMW Films\n\nRelease info\n\nReleased as: Star (part of The Hire)\n\nReleased online: June 2001\n\nRuntime: 7 minutes\n\nGenre: Action/Comedy/Short\n\nOfficial site: BMW Films\n\nTrivia\n\nSeveral collaborators of this project were not new to working with Madonna: Toru Tanaka Jr., who plays the bodyguard, also appears as Oddjob in Madonna's Die Another Day video. Funnily, he is the son of Harold Sakata, who played the original role of Oddjob in 1964's Goldfinger. Sophia Crawford, who is Madonna's stunt double in Star, was also a stand-in during the fencing scenes in Die Another Day. Michael Beattie, here in the role of the manager Glen, plays Todd in Swept Away. Madonna's costume was designed by Arianne Philips, who made the Geisha outfit for the Drowned World Tour that same year.\n\nAwards\n\n2001 Video Premiere Awards:\n\nAward for 'Best Internet Video Premiere'\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThere is no official soundtrack for this shortfilm. Only two songs are used in it: Song 2 (Blur) and The Ride of the Valkyries (Richard Wagner)"
