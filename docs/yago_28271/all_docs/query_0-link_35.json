        "text": "Guy Ritchie’s back with another signature mix of dapper and unsavory criminals who get into all sorts of drug-dealing mischief in a new Netflix series.\n\nMeanwhile over on HBO and Max, Kate Winslet reigns supreme in a moldy political satire, “The Regime.” If you need some good laughs, John Cena provides plenty, and even steals the show from Zac Efron and company, in Amazon Prime’s “Ricky Stanicky.”\n\nHere’s our roundup.\n\n“The Gentlemen”: Netflix’s eight-part series showcases the best qualities of filmmaker Guy Ritchie. That said, if you’re not a fan of his comedic crime capers, odds are “The Gentlemen” won’t sway you, no matter how good it is. For fans, “Gentlemen” grabs you lock, stock and smoking barrel. Inspired by Ritchie’s same-titled 2019 film with Matthew McConaughey and numerous headliners, it features a grab bag of kooky bad boys and one bad girl in cahoots for a pot-growing business that’s thriving underneath a royal estate.\n\nFormer soldier and duke Eddie Horniman (Theo James, brilliantly cast) returns to those posh digs once dad dies and carries on the partnership even though brother Freddy (a very funny Daniel Ings) threatens to muck it up. The even-keeled but fierce Susie (Kaya Scodelario, mastering the art of the deadpan look) and her incarcerated pops Bobby (Ray “Sexy Beast” Winstone) are the brains behind the operation. Ritchie directs the first two episodes and all his staples are there — double crosses, suave attire, handsome interiors, bursts of violence and quirky secondary characters (my fave: the stoned-out-of-his gourd cannabis expert Henry Collins, played by Max Beesley.). It’s cheeky, irresistible and undemanding from start to finish. Hopefully, there will be a Season 2. Details: 3 stars out of 4; all episodes drop March 7.\n\n“Cabrini”: Alejandro Gomez Monteverde, director of “Sound of Freedom,” follows up his faith-based hit with a better film, a beautifully rendered portrait of Italian nun Francesca Cabrini — canonized as the patron saint of immigrants in 1946, the first American given that honor. Cabrini suffered ill health throughout much of her life but that never stopped the trailblazer who refused to take no for an answer, even from Vatican City. Cabrini was instrumental in helping New York’s young, poor and unhoused. She and other sisters emigrated in 1889 to the city where they tended to orphans and later helped establish hospitals around the globe. Cabrini (played with conviction and distinction by Cristiana Dell’Anna of the series “Gomorrah”) was made of tough stock and she butted heads with men in power (she stood up to Pope Leo XIII, played by Giancarlo Giannini, and New York Archbishop Corrigan, played by David Morse) during an era when women’s opinions got ignored, and she was ridiculed for being a “smelly” Italian.\n\nHer story holds universal appeal, as it chronicles her trying to fix a broken system, which leads to run-ins with cops and other authority figures including an underhanded Mayor Gould (John Lithgow, putting some shadiness into the part), who proves to be her Achilles Heel. His looks to be a composite of characters – something the filmmakers are upfront about. Screenwriters Rod Bass and Monteverde’s epic does run around 2 hours and 20 minutes, but it’s a testament to their storytelling abilities, and Monteverde’s passion about the immigrant issue (he, himself is an immigrant), that “Cabrini” never feels padded. There are portions that could have been trimmed or cut entirely, but Gorka Gómez Andreu’s staggering cinematography is worth savoring. For the most part, “Cabrini” raises the bar on quality faith-based entertainment. Details: 3 stars; in theaters March 8.\n\n“Ricky Stanicky”: Wrestler/actor John Cena continues to prove he’s a natural at comedy, and in Peter Farrelly’s juvenile, hilarious R-rated comedy, he’s landed the role that best showcases his range of talents. “The Peacemaker” star is a scream as “Rock Hard” Rod, a trainwreck of a Florida celebrity impersonator who’s profane act can’t be described in a “family newspaper.” (Trust us, it’s funny, very funny). A trio of boy-man childhood friends (played by Zac Efron, Andrew Santino and Jermaine Flower) hire Rod to play their fictional friend Ricky Stanicky, whom they’ve blamed for their obnoxious behavior for more than 20 years. Hot mess Rod takes his role seriously, very seriously, and he impresses in the role of his life, outsmarting everyone in the room and winning them over with his “do-gooder” charms. Even Efron and Santino’s boss, played by William H. Macy, can’t resist him. “Ricky Stanicky” works best when Cena is hamming it up and dragging the film along for the ride. It’s less effective near its overly contrived finale. But Cena’s performance is a revelation — he’s the real deal as both actor and comedian. Details: 3 stars; drops March 7 in theaters and on Amazon Prime.\n\n“The Regime”: It’s a shame, given the talent thrown at this HBO acidic six part stand-alone series, that it falls short. The well-acted satire from showrunner Will Tracy (who co-wrote the excellent “The Menu” and belted out a few scripts on “Succession”) aims its poison darts at the right target — despotic world leaders. But “The Regime” hammers on and on at the same note until it becomes more of a chore to watch instead of the clever takedown of vile and vain leaders it wants to be. Thank goodness there’s Kate Winslet, channeling the worst behavior of an array of narcissistic world rulers, to delver a grand performance as a crackpot Central European leader of a small country whose over-inflated sense of self is matched only by her delusions about how much her people love her. She enlists the help of self-flagellating, disgraced soldier Herbert Zubak (Matthias Schoenaerts, a powderkeg), who’s an unhinged brute who maneuvers his way into her political and personal life, which causes problems with her always-in-turmoil cabinet, her placating husband (Guillaume Gallienne), her fragile son and her grim palace manager (Andrea Riseborough, given not enough to do). There are some clever moments but most of “The Regime” is forgettable. Details: 1½ stars; first episode is available on MAX, with new episodes dropping every Sunday.\n\nFind of the week\n\n“Down Low”: A couple weeks back, the raunchy queer black comedy “Drive-Away Dolls” dropped an axle and stalled at the box office. The problem was that it just wasn’t very funny. But another raunchy queer black comedy, “Down Low,” is funny, very funny at times, and just as vulgar as “Drive-Away.” The difference here is that it has a good screenplay and two central performances — from Zachary Quinto as a repressed closeted gay man, and from Lukas Gage as a free-spirited Los Angeles masseuse — that are not just funny, but unexpectedly touching. The ludicrous plot hinges on Gary (Quinto) getting a “My Fair Lady” gay makeover for the sex-app set with the help of Cameron (Gage) after a massage with a potential bonus of extra benefits. Gage co-wrote this bit of lunacy that sags just in the final third before it races to a dark, but oddly comforting finale. The easily offended should avoid it, but if you’re looking for a decent black comedy with a queer tempo, “Down Low” hits just enough comedic highs, including some cheeky supporting work from Judith Light and Simon Rex. Details: 3 stars; available now on Netflix."
