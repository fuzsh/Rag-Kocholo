        "text": "Guy Ritchie hit upon a successful formula when directing his first two films, bringing his unique sense\n\nof style and panache to the crime thriller genre, but then blotted his copybook when he attempted new\n\nthings in his following two movies. The husband of mega-popstar Madonna cast his famous wife in\n\none his biggest commercial and critical flops, but has since tried to get his career back on track after\n\ndivorcing her in late 2008.\n\nGuy Stuart Ritchie was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England, to successful marketing executive\n\nJohn Vivian Ritchie and Amber Parkinson. His parents divorced when he was five, and his mother\n\nwould later marry Sir Michael Leighton, a baronet. Ritchie spent a fair amount of his childhood at the\n\nLeighton estate, although his mother and Sir Michael would divorce seven years later. Ritchie was\n\nborn with severe dyslexia, and at 15 was expelled from Stanbridge Earls School, a specialist school\n\nfor dyslexics. He worked as a labourer before getting into the film industry at age 25. He began as a\n\nfilm runner (an odd jobber on film and TV sets) before trying his hand at directing music videos, doing\n\nâ20 videos back to back, really crappy ones with sort of German rave bandsâ. This gave him some\n\nvaluable experience behind the camera, and he moved on to doing commercials. With the muchneeded grounding, he went on to direct a 20 minute short, âThe Hard Caseâ (1995), which aired on\n\nChannel 4. As it did so, it caught the attention of Trudie Styler, the wife of singer Sting, and she\n\ninvested money into what would become Ritchieâs first feature full-length film, âLock, Stock and Two\n\nSmoking Barrelsâ (1998). âLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrelsâ introduced Guy Ritchie to the world\n\nin the most remarkable and emphatic manner. A rip-roaring peek at the London underworld, it was in\n\nequal parts a caper romp, a heist flick, and with Ritchieâs pen at its best, it utilised the quickfire wit and\n\npithy dialogue of Cockney Londoners. Colourful characters, a convoluted plot, stylised violence and an\n\nemphasis on dialogue led comparisons to be drawn between Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino. Indeed,\n\nâLockâ¦â is as seminal to Ritchieâs career as âReservoir Dogsâ (1992) or âPulp Fictionâ (1994) was to\n\nTarantinoâs. A largely unknown cast as leading characters helped Ritchie keep a lid on things, and\n\nâLockâ¦â is credited with kick-starting Jason Stathamâs career â he has now forged a career in\n\nHollywood playing action-type characters with a tendency to shoot off at the mouth. With footballer\n\nVinnie Jones (a fatherly thug), comedian Rob Brydon (as an unfortunate traffic warden) and Sting (an\n\nunfatherly pub landlord) being the best known names among the cast, âLockâ¦â was a surprise hit at\n\nthe box office.\n\nRitchie was the hottest new director in Britain after the release of âLockâ¦â and there was a clamour for\n\nmore of the same rambunctious rollicking roller-coaster Ritchie rides. Finally, it was Sony that backed\n\nRitchieâs sophomore effort, âSnatchâ (2000), which followed very much in the vein of âLockâ¦â. Where\n\nâLockâ¦â was centred around a card game gone awry, âSnatchâ made bareknuckle boxing and\n\ndiamonds the premise on which the fantastical and outrageous antics of the characters were based.\n\nRitchie re-called Jason Statham, Alan Ford, and Vinnie Jones from âLockâ¦â, but âSnatchâ featured\n\nHollywood big names like Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina and Benicio Del Toro. The casting of Pitt especially,\n\nas a gypsy bareknuckle boxer, was the cause of much hilarity, as Pitt was forced to learn an\n\nincomprehensible Pikey accent; he pulled it off with uncustomary aplomb. The public loved âSnatchâ,\n\nalthough the critics complained that Ritchie followed the âLockâ¦â formula so slavishly that they were\n\nessentially identical movies with different actors. Ritchie wed pop singer, âMaterial Girlâ and seemingly\n\nbionic lady Madonna, she of the conical brassieres in the eighties, on 22 December 2000, after their\n\nson Rocco was born on 11 August 2000. Soon after, Ritchie directed Madonna in a commercial for\n\nGerman car-maker BMW, a series of advertisements called âThe Hireâ. With BMW cars used for the\n\nfirst time in the Pierce Brosnan/James Bond movies âGoldenEyeâ (1995), âTomorrow Never Diesâ\n\n(1997) and âThe World Is Not Enoughâ (1999), BMW were keen to cash in on their image as a car for\n\nthe young and sporty, but with the cool edge of danger."
