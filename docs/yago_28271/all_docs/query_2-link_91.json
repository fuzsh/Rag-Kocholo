        "text": "\"I got a lot of expensive equipment moving very fast...\" There's nothing like an interview with Guy Ritchie. This is the third time I've spoken with him and it is always an amusing experience, thankfully this time I captured it all on camera. Last week I interviewed Guy Ritchie, director of Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the sequel to his \"reboot\" of the classic Arthur Conan Doyle character Sherlock Holmes in 2009. Our chat ranges from the franchise being like a bouncing boulder, to growing up with Conan Doyle's Holmes, to working with the \"volcano of creativity\" Downey Jr. This is a good one, you've got to see it!\n\nMy interview with Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows director Guy Ritchie, shot on my Flip cam:\n\nI loved his first Sherlock Holmes and enjoyed A Game of Shadows quite a bit, as including Moriarty really mixes things up - he's a sinister genius. And the sequence I mentioned near the end as being my favorite, the bombardment in the forest, is indeed my favorite and is awesome, one of those you-need-to-see on the big screen kind of scenes. I left the rest of the video untouched as I feel it truly represents how entertaining and funny Guy is in person, which goes to show in his movies as well, as there's always subtle (or sometimes not-so-subtle) humor in them. Thank you to Warner Bros and Michele for arranging. Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows hits theaters this weekend, starting December 16th. There's a game afoot."
