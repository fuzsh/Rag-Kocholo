        "text": "Action! - A British Romp: Action Guy and The Ritchie Binders\n\nA short film starring Madonna and Clive Owen with a decent dose of action, humour, soundtrack, and possibly a tiny personal vendetta; although, the latter is most likely just my imagination.\n\nMadonna probably delivers her best performance, which isn't saying much, as basically a (realistic?) version of her. Owen does a fine job as this driver for a need for speed who takes no s**t from any star.\n\nThe film's mainly one-song soundtrack with the occasional interruption does a good job of injecting a nice dose of energy into the already exciting and enjoyable action set piece. The ending is rather predictable, but that doesn't make it any less funny.\n\nAll in all, a thrilling and entertaining short film that manages to pack a lot of amusement into its nine minutes.\n\nTODAY SCHEDULE\n\nShe Said\n\nTurn It Up\n\nStar\n\nSwept Away\n\n\"But the real heart-stopper that this woman has in her galaxy of talents is her voice. A billion-dollar voice.\"\n\nServing as the fourth chapter in the BMW branded series The Hire, a set of promotional shorts from various filmmakers, including Wong Kar-wai, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Ang Lee, and Tony Scott, Star marks the beginning of a turbulent period in Guy Ritchie's career. The projects surrounding the rise and fall of the British writer/director's marriage to singer Madonna are easily the most misguided and conceited of his filmography, epitomized by the dreadful likes of Swept Away and Revolver, two of the worst flicks I've ever seen.\n\nStar is a commercialized precursor to those aforementioned failures, the debut collaboration between husband and…\n\nAnother brick in my YouTube Watch Later wall, one of those BMW Driver shorts, this one directed by Guy Ritchie. The main attraction is Madonna having fun playing an obnoxious pop superstar who is systematically automotively humiliated by Clive Owen's Driver, and, by extension, the director, who was also her husband at the time, with a punchline that is too bizarre for me to spoil here. Ritchie finds time for not just one but two hacky needledrop choices in just eight minutes, although maybe that Blur song wasn't quite as overused in 2001 as it went on to be later.\n\nAnother short film as produced by BMW for their \"The Hire\" series. This time it's Guy Ritchie's contribution. Not so much of a plot to this one and it's essentially a one gag film but that gag is very funny and entertaining.\n\nRitchie incorporates his usual style and music into the mix and you can really get that same vibe from Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels also in this film. I find it funny of the concept Ritchie chose to do this film on as he is essentially mocking and torturing his then wife Madonna and the artificial and egotistical lifestyle of superstars living in the fame. Owen's Driver is more charismatic in this film and actually shows some life in his character (laughed out loud to the look on his face when the car goes airborne). I also laughed when the film literally changes gears and the mayhem ensues."
