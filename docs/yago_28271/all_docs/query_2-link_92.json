Having a unique style even if it’s shite, is still more than the vast majority of directors.\n\nEverything afterwards has been very meh, he recently directed the Will Smith Aladdin film.\n\nFeb 3, 2023\n\n#15\n\nRaoul\n\nAdmin\n\nJoined\n\nAug 14, 1999\n\nMessages\n\n132,402\n\nLocation\n\nHollywood CA\n\nFair play to Guy for taking a chance on this.

The Gentleman was a cartoon, albeit a really fun and enjoyable one.\n\nHe’s an odd director. I still can’t work out whether he’s any good, or I just enjoy some of his movies. He’s very creative, but it’s generally a bit shock and awe with zero nuance.\n\nFeb 3, 2023\n\n#17\n\nRedDevilQuebecois\n\nNew Member\n\nJoined\n\nMay 27, 2021\n\nMessages\n\n8,256\n\nAnyway, we will see how this one pans out. However, I have a feeling I will really enjoy this this movie because it touches a theme that came back to the surface around the time when Kabul fell: Afghan interpreters and the many risks they (and their families) took to help the West against the Taliban for 2 decades.\n\nFeb 3, 2023\n\n#18\n\nMurder on Zidanes Floor\n\nYou'd better not kill Giroud\n\nJoined\n\nJun 11, 2015\n\nMessages\n\n30,478\n\nLooks awful, Ritchie hasn't done a good movie since Sherlock Holmes #1\n\nFeb 3, 2023\n\n#19\n\ncrossy1686\n\ncareer ending\n\nJoined\n\nJun 5, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n32,467\n\nLocation\n\nManchester/Stockholm\n\nJake Gyllenhaal is a terrible actor and an equally boring person.

He didn’t kick on from those Snatch days of being the British Tarantino. I tuned out from him after that pretentious Revolver movie he made, where he tried hard to be Snatch fused with Memento-like storytelling and some David Lynch-like visuals.\n\nApr 20, 2023\n\n#28\n\n2 man midfield\n\nLast Man Standing finalist 2021/22\n\nJoined\n\nSep 4, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n46,742\n\nLocation\n\n?\n\nOperation fortune was better than I thought but nothing amazing.

But I would ask someone who saw, for instance, Rock N Rolla, how it was, and no one ever said anything good about his later films.\n\nEDIT: he's not the only one. There are a lot of filmmakers out there who I will skip. Every time I've been suckered into watching a film by a person whose work I despise (e.g. Spike Lee, Spielberg, Tarantino) because \"the new one is so good you'll love it\", and invariably whatever it was I hated about the person's style is turned up to 11.\n\nApr 21, 2023\n\n#34\n\nVolumiza\n\nThe alright \"V\", B-Boy cypher cat\n\nJoined\n\nJul 13, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n13,826\n\nLocation\n\nSomewhere in the middle\n\nI hated what he did with Sherlock Holmes so much that I promised myself I'd never put myself through one of his films again.\n\nMay be worth breaking that promise to watch The Gentlemen.
