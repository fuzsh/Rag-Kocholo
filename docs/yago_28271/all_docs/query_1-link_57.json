        "text": "Weekend projections: Civil War stays top on slow weekend\n\nApril 21st, 2024\n\nCivil War will top the box office chart this weekend, holding off solid openings from Abigail and The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, with all three films landing close to our model’s Friday-morning forecast. More...\n\nWeekend predictions: Civil War, Abigail and Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare tussling for top spot\n\nApril 19th, 2024\n\nOur forecasting model is predicting essentially a three-way tie at the top of the box office chart this weekend, with Civil War the marginal favorite to beat Abigail and The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare in the battle for top spot. The legs of each film will be essential in determining which one comes out the winner, with Abigail looking the most likely of the newcomers to challenge Civil War. Spy x Family Code: White, meanwhile, looks like it will be back in the pack. More...\n\nTheater counts: Civil War to become widest release\n\nApril 18th, 2024\n\nThe dystopian action-thriller Civil War will almost certainly become the widest release in theaters this weekend. We don’t have an official theater count from A24, but after its strong opening last weekend, it’s safe to assume it’ll be playing in about the same number of theaters as last time, maybe slightly more. Abigail is the widest new release, and is joined by The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare and Spy x Family Code: White as new options for theatergoers. More...\n\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare trailer\n\nJanuary 30th, 2024\n\nAction comedy starring Henry Cavill, directed by Guy Ritchie opens in theaters April 19 ... Full Movie Details.\n\nThe story of the first-ever special forces organization formed during WWII by UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill and a small group of military officials including author Ian Fleming. The top-secret combat unit, composed of a motley crew of rogues and mavericks, goes on a daring mission against the Nazis using entirely unconventional and utterly “ungentlemanly” fighting techniques. Ultimately their audacious approach changed the course of the war and laid the foundation for the British SAS and modern Black Ops warfare. More...\n\nTheater counts: Super Mario once again widest release as four new features arrive in theaters\n\nApril 20th, 2023\n\nCurrently enjoying a 15-day domestic haul of over $371 million, The Super Mario Bros. Movie again stands alone as this week’s widest release. Last weekend, the film scored the best second weekend ever for an animated movie. Only dropping 21 cinemas this week, the blockbuster film is still widely available in 4,350 locations. While Mario shouldn’t have any problems leading the box office, like last week, it contends with a flurry of newcomers making their big screen debuts. More...\n\nTheater counts: Super Mario fends off six newcomers to remain widest release\n\nApril 13th, 2023\n\nSporting an eight-day domestic total of $250 million, The Super Mario Bros. Movie once again finds itself as the widest release as it heads into its second weekend, adding 28 locations for a total of 4,371 cinemas. The animated adventure opened last Wednesday and took in an impressive $204.6 million in its first five days. Mario and friends shouldn’t have any trouble staying on top at the box office despite the arrival of six wide releases making their theatrical debuts. More...\n\nWeekend projections: Creed III smashes its way to $58-million-plus opening\n\nMarch 5th, 2023\n\nCreed III is off to a flying start in theaters this weekend, with United Artists projecting it will earn $58.658 million by the end of today. That’s easily the best 3-day opening for the Creed franchise (and also for a Rocky movie), and even tops the $56 million accumulated over five days by Creed II during the Thanksgiving Holiday in 2018. More...\n\nWeekend predictions: $40 million on the cards for Creed III\n\nMarch 3rd, 2023\n\nCreed III looks likely to have the best opening weekend for a film in the Creed franchise, which (not adjusted for inflation) would also give it the best opening for a Rocky movie too, at least based on its excellent $5.45 million in previews, and our model’s expectations. Operation Fortune: Ruse de guerre looks like an also-ran, unfortunately. Meanwhile, Ant-Man and Cocaine Bear keep things interesting as our model picks apart this weekend’s box office prospects. More...\n\nTheater counts: Creed III punches its way into 4,007 theaters\n\nMarch 2nd, 2023\n\nThe third installment of the Creed franchise, and ninth overall film in the Rocky film series, Creed III enters the fray this week as the widest release, and the only film showing in over 4,000 locations. 4,007 of them, to be precise. The sports drama, starring Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed, is also Jordan’s directorial debut. The opening count is a Rocky franchise record.\n\nAlso opening in wide release is the action-comedy Operation Fortune: Ruse de guerre. Starting out in 2,168 locations, the movie features an all-star ensemble cast including Jason Statham, Hugh Grant, Aubrey Plaza, Cary Elwes, Josh Hartnett and Bugzy Malone. Directed by Guy Ritchie, the movie follows super spy Orson Fortune (played by Statham) and his team of top operatives as they recruit Hollywood’s biggest movie star to help them on an undercover mission to stop a billionaire arms broker (played by Grant) from selling a deadly new weapons technology that threatens to disrupt the world order. More...\n\nOperation Fortune: Ruse de guerre trailer\n\nFebruary 27th, 2023\n\nGuy Ritchie’s crime caper, starring Jason Statham and Hugh Grant opens in theaters Friday, March 3 ... Full Movie Details.\n\nSuper spy Orson Fortune and his team of top operatives recruit Hollywood’s biggest movie star, Danny Francesco, to help them on an undercover mission to stop billionaire arms broker Greg Simmonds from selling a deadly new weapons technology that threatens to disrupt the world order. More...\n\nTheater counts: Quantumania repeats as widest release and two newcomers arrive\n\nFebruary 23rd, 2023\n\nIt’s likely no big surprise to see last week’s juggernaut release retain its spot as the widest release this week. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania debuted in 4,345 locations and went on to collect an impressive $106 million in its opening weekend and currently enjoys a six-day domestic total of $131.33 million. The latest Marvel feature retains its opening theater count, once again making it the only film currently playing in over 4,000 movie houses. More...\n\nWeekend estimates: Wrath of Man posts solid $8.1 million opening\n\nMay 9th, 2021\n\nWrath of Man will pull off an easy win at the box office this weekend, according to Sunday morning’s projection from United Artists. It’s easily outperforming our model’s prediction with $8.1 million expected for the full weekend. Its strength probably had an adverse effect on the numbers for Demon Slayer, Mortal Kombat, and Godzilla vs. Kong, all of which failed to live up to expectations. With Here Today also struggling, we’re looking at a slightly down week at the box office. More...\n\nWeekend predictions: Wrath of Man and Here Today take a shot at leading duo\n\nMay 7th, 2021\n\nTwo new wide releases, Wrath of Man and Here Today, enter the fray this weekend, and will be hoping to capitalize on the rapidly-declining audiences for Mortal Kombat and Demon Slayer to take them to the top of the chart. While Here Today has the least overlap with the other films audience-wise, our model thinks Wrath of Man will fair the better of the two on debut.\n\nHere’s what the model has to say about each movie… More...\n\nTheater counts: Mortal Kombat faces Wrath of Man\n\nMay 6th, 2021\n\nThis week looks to pick up slightly from last week as two wide releases hit the big screen. Making its way into theaters this weekend is the Guy Ritchie-directed action film Wrath of Man, starring Jason Statham, which opens in 2,875 theaters. The other wide release making its debut is Here Today. The Sony Pictures comedy directed by and starring Billy Crystal, and co-starring Tiffany Haddish, opens in 1,200 theaters. Mortal Kombat, Demon Slayer The Movie: Mugen Train and Godzilla vs. Kong still stood atop the charts last week, despite the release of Separation, but Wrath of Man will change that this week. More...\n\nWrath of Man trailer\n\nMarch 29th, 2021\n\nGuy Ritchie thriller starring Jason Statham opens in theaters on May 7. Full movie details…\n\nH, a cold and mysterious character, works at a cash truck company responsible for moving hundreds of millions of dollars around Los Angeles each week. He surprises his coworkers during a heist in which he unexpectedly unleashes precision skills. The crew is left wondering who he is and where he came from. Soon, the marksman’s ultimate motive becomes clear as he takes dramatic and irrevocable steps to settle a score. More...\n\nDVD and Blu-ray Releases: Bad Boys and The Gentlemen New on Disc\n\nApril 21st, 2020\n\nIt’s a tough week for new releases on physical disc, although not because of the quality of the new releases. In fact, there are several new releases that I’m interested in. However, Amazon is having issues that’s making it hard to research this column. The biggest release on this week’s list is Bad Boys For Life, but I’m still waiting for the screener for that movie. Guy Ritchie’s The Gentlemen is also a welcome new major release.\n\nThe review DVD for Looking for Alaska did arrive, but not until Monday, so the review will have to wait. That said, it has some of the best reviews on this week’s list, and solid extras, which is enough to be the only real contender for Pick of the Week. More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: The Box Office will have a Gentle Weekend\n\nJanuary 23rd, 2020\n\nIt is a post-holiday weekend and the weekend before the Super Bowl. Needless to say, there are no prime releases coming out in theaters. The Gentlemen is the widest release of the week a should open in the top five, even if it doesn’t compete for top spot. The Turning is a low-budget horror movie, and we’ve already had one of those struggle at the box office this year. There’s little hope this one will be better. Finally, there’s The Last Full Measure, which is only opening nationwide, not even semi-wide. It’s not even going to make the top ten, so we will talk about that film with the other limited releases. This leaves Bad Boys for Life as the only real contender for first place this weekend. The question is more about how far it falls from last weekend. As for this weekend last year, we were in a similar situation with the two new releases, The Kid Who Would Be King and Serenity, failing to make any real impact, leaving Glass in first place for the second weekend in a row. The Upside was the only other film to earn more than $10 million that weekend, while this weekend we will have four, perhaps even five films above $10 million. 2020 should walk away with an easy win. More...\n\n2020 Preview: January\n\nJanuary 1st, 2020\n\nIt’s the year 2020, the year where we find out how many times you can say, “Well, hindsight is 20/20.” before you get punched. On the positive side, while December wasn’t a great month, it was good enough to help 2019 end on a positive note, a positive note that should continue into January. There are no real potential monster hits coming out this month, but there are three films that have a real shot at $100 million domestically. These are, in alphabetical order, 1917, which will rely on Awards Season to get to the century mark. Bad Boys for Life will have a much, much easier time getting to $100 million, assuming people still care about the franchise 17 years later. Finally, Dolittle is looking like a disaster with a really troubled production; however, a $100 million run isn’t out of the question and if it can get there, it will at least save face. As for last January, Glass was the biggest hit of the month in terms of raw dollars, but The Upside was more impressive, as it is one the biggest hits in STX Entertainment’s history. We need two of the three potential $100 million hits to reach that mark to keep pace with last year, but we also have one more weekend to get there. More...\n\nThe Gentlemen Trailer\n\nOctober 18th, 2019\n\nGuy Ritchie crime caper with an ensemble cast led by Matthew McConaughey, Henry Golding, and Hugh Grant opens January 24 ... Full Movie Details. More...\n\nFeatured Blu-ray and DVD Review: Aladdin Double-Shot\n\nSeptember 9th, 2019\n\nThis week, the live action Aladdin comes out on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD for the first time, while the original animated Aladdin gets a Blu-ray re-release and debuts on 4K Ultra HD. I’ve previously reviewed the 1992 animated film and I consider it a classic. How does the new remake live up to the original? And is the re-release of the original worth picking up? More...\n\n2017 Preview: May\n\nMay 1st, 2017\n\nApril is over and thank god for that. The Fate of the Furious is currently the only film that was better than a midlevel hit, while Going in Style might end up being the second-biggest release of the month. On the low end, there were seven films on last month’s list that didn’t even manage to open in truly wide release (2,000 or more theaters). Fortunately, May looks a lot brighter. Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 should dominate the chart and get the month off to a fast start. Furthermore, every week there’s at least one film with a reasonable chance of earning $100 million domestically. Additionally, last May wasn’t particularly strong, so that should help 2017 overall. Granted, Captain America: Civil War earned more than $400 million, so the month got off to a fast start, but films struggled the rest of the way. The second-biggest film was X-Men: Apocalypse at just $155 million, while only one other movie, The Angry Birds Movie, earned more than $100 million. Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 should at least be competitive with Captain America: Civil War, allowing 2017 to win thanks to its superior depth.
