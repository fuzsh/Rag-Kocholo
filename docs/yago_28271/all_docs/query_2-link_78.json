        "text": "Neil Marshall seems to want what Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino had in the early aughts. For his latest outing, the once-promising English filmmaker behind horror films like “Dog Soldiers” and “The Descent” scales back his interest in frights for a more straightforward tale of fights, but fails to land nearly every punch he throws. Rather than build on the template his aforementioned peers built on themselves, Marshall does nothing for the ensemble crime thriller genre other than play the hits, which would’ve been bearable had he actually done so on key and with some care or nuance.\n\nRight from the get-go, “Duchess” unveils itself as paint-by-numbers contrivance with an in media res sequence that drops us into the middle of a scene between main character, Scarlett (Charlotte Kirk), and an unseemly goon trying to get his rocks off. A fight ensues, blood is spurt, the goon goes out the window, Scarlett goes downstairs with a shotgun to finish the job, then BOOM, we flash back to the ACTUAL beginning of the story. And by flash, I literally mean a full rewind that features shots from the entire story leading up to that point. Subtlety has never been a feature of Marshall’s oeuvre, but at this point, it just feels like he doesn’t even care.\n\nEvery character receives a freeze-frame as they’re introduced, followed by their name being superimposed beside them. Are their names or who they are important? Not necessarily. Does it factor into the narrative at all? Nope. But Marshall has committed to the bit and clearly feels some way about acknowledging everyone’s presence, so freeze-frames and superimposed titles it is. Every choice in the film seems to follow this logic, whether it’s the comically bad cutaways of henchmen beating people up or staging and lighting every romantic scene in the style of either a Lifetime movie or a soft-core porn.\n\nBut much like the film in question, I’m getting ahead of myself. “Duchess” follows a Cinderella figure of sorts, a cockney-spewing Londoner named Scarlett who’s got light fingers and a mean right hook. When she’s not pick-pocketing the well-to-do for her pimp, she’s in the boxing ring, sharpening her brawling skills, a result of trauma she faced from her father (Colm Meaney) in her childhood. Thankfully, Scarlett is swept up by her Prince Charming, Rob (Philip Winchester), a man she affectionately refers to as “a proper fucking gangster.” Rob is in the diamond trade and, at the time of meeting Scarlett, is in possession of his largest score yet. An uncut diamond that could net him $15 million…assuming he can transport it and live to tell the tale.\n\nWhile he faces some challenges, namely the threats of a rich socialite named Charlie (Stephanie Beacham), who also happens to enjoy pulling people’s tongues through a hole cut in their throats, Rob eventually finds a way back to his diamond-cutting business on the Spanish Island of Tenerife. But he’s not only carrying a big rock, he’s also got his new lover Scarlett, now referred to as Duchess by those who pledge their fealty to Rob. And Scarlett truly does feel like she’s living the royal life. Beautiful home, stunning beaches, her very own Spanish servant she can make into her best friend. What more could a girl want? It’s at this moment, over halfway through the movie, that the story chooses to spin in a new direction. It’s not that wide of a spin, but jarring enough to make one wonder why the shift occurs at the point it does.\n\nIn addition to playing Scarlett/Duchess, Kirk is also credited as a screenwriter on the film, with Marshall and Simon Farr receiving recognition as well. Kirk and Marshall have been romantic partners since 2018 and collaborated previously on “The Reckoning” and “The Lair.” While, generally speaking, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with working with the ones you love, it’s hard not to look upon their pairing and the films it has produced without wondering if either is afraid of critiquing the other’s ideas. If not, then perhaps they both just enjoy shoveling out drek with the same amount of glee, but no matter what, between performance and execution, neither Marshall nor Kirk seem to have a firm grasp on the story they’re trying to tell.\n\nShooting action is by no means an easy feat, but Marshall’s staging offers little-to-no excitement, often framing scenarios from a mix of centralized points, then cutting them together, neglecting the fact that every shot looks exactly the same. In terms of dialogue, every line, whether it be shared between characters or through voiceover, feels indistinct, like it could come from the mouth of any badass chick or nondescript gangster. What’s worse is that everytime you start to build an interest in the story, the narrative pivots, seemingly bored with what it was covering before and forcefully creating new beats to lead us in a new, overly-manufactured direction.\n\nWhile overall, “Duchess” proves a lazy trifle, on a scene-by-scene basis, it does offer some unintentional enjoyment. For instance, the scene that follows Rob and Scarlett consummating their love sees Rob bare-chested as he shares the sob story of how his brother died saving him shortly after his 18th birthday. Though Marshall clearly wants to endear us to the character in this moment, one can’t help but focus on Rob’s gleaming, muscled torso, wondering, Was he waxed and oiled directly before they called, “Action!” or am I crazy? Another moment that features Scarlett thrusting a hot iron onto someone’s dick is also under consideration for most efficient torture method put to screen, an accolade I will give credit to the film for achieving.\n\nAdditionally, performances from Beacham as Charlie and Meaney as Scarlett’s prison-bound father do provide “Duchess” with enough bona fide talent to subdue questions over whether this is an actual feature film and not some student project thrown together after watching “Snatch” or “Kill Bill” too many times. It may not meet the standards of these films, let alone make a mark of its own, but you can’t fault “Duchess” for at least trying.\n\nGrade: D\n\n“Duchess” will be available on VOD on Friday, August 9 from Saban Films."
