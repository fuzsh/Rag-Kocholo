Guy Ritchie directed a film in 1995 titled The Hard Case. His first truly successful feature was Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in 1998. Recalling Quentin Tarantino, The Sting and The Italian Job in equal measure, the film was widely praised for its wit. It also introduced actor Jason Statham to worldwide audiences, and set former football player Vinnie Jones onto a new career as a film actor.

His second release, Snatch in 2000, was another caper comedy, this time backed by a major studio. Its cast featured such Hollywood big names as Brad Pitt, Benicio del Toro, and Dennis Farina. Reviews were also strong for this film.
