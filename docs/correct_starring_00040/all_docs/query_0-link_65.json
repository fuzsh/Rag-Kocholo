        "text": "THE BLIND SIDE\n\nI'm wary to give it a thumbs-up, because I have the strong suspicion that the screenplay takes a real-life tragedy-turned-happy-ending, bleaches it, sanitizes it, Disneyfies it and sells it as the heart-warming story we see on the screen, which, make no mistake, is very engaging and affirming. There is some attempt to acknowledge the boosterism and ulterior-motivated issues underlying the facts, and it is this aspect that ultimately redeems it and makes it worthwhile. - Pat Crandall, 58, West Beaches\n\n2012\n\nMy expectation of \"2012\" was that it would be a mindless disaster film, but I was surprised by the movie actually having a well-written story. The movie was good, but after two hours and 40 minutes, you start to get tired of the movie. I would recommend this film for several reasons: This is the only action film with a plot, and it is a lot of fun watching stuff get blown up, hit by a tsunami, splitting into two pieces or getting hit by meteors. - Michael Ansbacher, 14, Mandarin\n\n2012\n\nIf you like special effects and a lot of action, \"2012\" is the film that will keep you glued to your seat. Although some of the scenes are unrealistic to say the least, the complex action sequences are beyond entertaining and realistically visual. John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Danny Glover and Woody Harrelson add an exciting dialogue to the crazy effects. - Jeff Godbold, 28, St. Johns County\n\nLAW ABIDING CITIZEN\n\nGerard Butler plays a character who lost everything when he lost his wife and daughter in the opening scene. Butler goes on a mission to avenge the death of his family, and murders everyone who had a role in the case of his family. \"Law Abiding Citizen,\" is worth admission, just don't expect it to be nominated for best film. - Jacob Hunter, 23, Southside\n\nTHIS IS IT\n\nI am so glad I had the opportunity to see the new Michael Jackson musical/documentary. Overall, I thought this film was superb. It gives every fan of the King of Pop some type of closure after his unexpected death almost six months ago. I've also had the chance to take a look at what went on behind the scenes of his [planned] London comeback tour. I was somewhat dancing in my chair during some of the songs. I could see this movie two, three, four or even 10 times if I have to because I loved it so much. If I could recommend any movie to my friends, it's this one. - ERIC WILLIAMS, 36, St. Marys, Ga.\n\nTHIS IS IT\n\nSay what you want about Michael Jackson's lifestyle, but one thing that can't be denied is his outstanding music and dancing abilities. This movie shows Jackson's latest tour at 50 years old would have been one to see and remember. Jackson's phenomenal entertaining skills and showmanship have never been stronger on stage. The true \"king of pop\" deserves the recognition in remembrance of his life and music. - JESSICA ROBBINS, 22, Orange Park\n\nTHE BOX\n\nOn the surface this movie raises important ethical questions. I was even able to look past Cameron Diaz's \"Southern\" accent and put myself in her position. That is, until things started getting weird. Beneath the surface, this movie reminded me of something by M. Night Shyamalan, but with less creativity. Despite the over-the-top effects and over-reaching plot, I left the theater seriously questioning humanity. - RON MAURNO, 22, Southside\n\n2012\n\nIf you need a reason to go green, this movie would be a wake-up to the effects that we are causing on the planet Earth. Roland Emmerich used special effects to take this modern day Noah's ark to another level. - KAHALA ADAMS, 36, East Jacksonville\n\nTHE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS\n\nA journalist (Ewan McGregor), in an attempt to win back his wife's affection, travels to cover the war in Iraq. He runs into an erratic man (George Clooney) who tells of the New Earth Army he is a part of where soldiers use their minds instead of weapons to battle. This comedy could have been more entertaining. I was fighting to stay awake. - SHAENA SILVESTRI, 22, Jacksonville Beach\n\nPRECIOUS"
