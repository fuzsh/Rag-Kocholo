        "text": "Danny Glover (born July 22, 1947, San Francisco, California, U.S.) is an American actor, producer, and social activist who played a diverse range of characters but was perhaps best known for starring as a cautious veteran detective in the action blockbuster Lethal Weapon (1987) and its three sequels (1989, 1992, and 1998).\n\nGlover studied acting at San Francisco State College and trained at the Black Actors Workshop of the American Conservatory Theater. His stage work included South African dramatist Athol Fugard’s plays Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and “Master Harold”…and the Boys. In 1979 Glover made his film debut, appearing as an inmate in Escape from Alcatraz. That year he also began acting on television, and in 1981 he had a recurring role in the police drama Hill Street Blues. More high-profile parts followed, and he notably played heroes in Places in the Heart (1984) and Silverado (1985). He showed his versatility by taking on more villainous roles in Witness (1985), a crime drama starring Harrison Ford, and The Color Purple (1985). In the latter film his performance as the abusive husband of the main character (played by Whoopi Goldberg) earned him widespread acclaim.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nIn 1987 Glover starred with Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon, playing Roger Murtaugh. The film was a huge box-office hit and launched a successful franchise. During this time he continued to appear on the small screen, and in 1987 he portrayed South African leader Nelson Mandela in a television biography, Mandela (1987). He also had major roles in the miniseries Chiefs (1983) and Lonesome Dove (1989), and he appeared in the TV movie Freedom Song (2000).\n\nIn the 1990s Glover acted in such films as To Sleep with Anger (1990), Predator 2 (1990), Bopha! (1993), and Beloved (1998). His numerous and varied later movies included Wes Anderson’s The Royal Tenenbaums (2001); Saw (2004), a popular horror movie that led to numerous sequels; Dreamgirls (2006), a musical inspired by the girl groups of the 1960s; Shooter (2007), a thriller about a plot to kill the U.S. president; and John Sayles’s Honeydripper (2007). In the sci-fi thriller 2012 (2009) Glover played a U.S. president confronting a global catastrophe. He subsequently appeared in Death at a Funeral (2010), Tula: The Revolt (2013), Waffle Street (2015), Mr. Pig (2016), and Jumanji: The Next Level (2019). Glover made his feature-film directorial debut with Just a Dream in 2002."
