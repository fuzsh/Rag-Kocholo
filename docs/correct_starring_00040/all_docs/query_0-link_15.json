        "text": "Dead Man's Curveball\n\nAfter the hitting coach of Santa Barbara's minor league baseball team mysteriously drops dead, the team's manager hires Psych to investigate by having Shawn go undercover as the new hitting instructor and having Gus stepping in as the team mascot, the Seabird. Guest Stars: Danny Glover, Wade Boggs (as himself), and Michael Trucco.\n\nMy Name Is Alias\n\nDarnell's absentee father arrives in Camden claiming he needs to make amends with his son. Earl and Randy smell trouble and go to warn Joy and Darnell. Unfortunately, trouble follows them there and the family reunion results in Darnell and his dad going on one last super-secret, undercover operation. Nadine Velazquez also stars.\n\nThe Van Gogh Job\n\nOn the trail of a lost Van Gogh, the team learns the painting was the center of a World War II love story between a black soldier and the white heiress he was forced to leave behind.\n\nNobody's Baby\n\nRay attends to Claire (Erin Cottrell), a surrogate mother who goes into premature labor after being involved in a car accident. Claire refuses a cesarean section even though the unborn baby is in fetal distress, forcing the doctors to make an emotional decision. Pratt deals with his feelings from the past and the possibility of embracing the family of his future after he encounters his estranged father, Charlie (recurring guest star Danny Glover - \"Lethal Weapon\" films, \"The Royal Tenenbaums\"). Despite Kovac's objections, Sam finds a new apartment and starts to pack. Sam Jones III (\"Smallville\") guest stars as Pratt's half-brother, Chas."
