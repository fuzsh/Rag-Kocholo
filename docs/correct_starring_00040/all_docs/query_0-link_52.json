        "text": "In 2012, Danny Trejo (Breaking Bad, Machete Kills) starred in a low budget, direct-to-video action flick titled Bad Ass, and it overcame absurdity to make enough cash to warrant a sequel.\n\nThe first trailer for Bad Asses shows off its primary hook: veteran action star Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon) teaming up with Trejo to open up an old-ass can of butt-whooping.\n\nTrejo plays retired street hero Frank Vega, who vaguely resembles the “Epic Beard Man” meme that went viral across the Internet. This time he is tasked with protecting his neighborhood from any number of “threatening predicaments.” While the trailer can be remarked as a poor representation, this could end up being another genuinely good buddy comedy. If Bad Asses can successfully utilize Trejo and Glover’s skills and transcend its ridiculous plot, movie fans can get behind this film with a few chortles.\n\nYou can watch the trailer below:\n\n//www.youtube.com/embed/Dn3MFWKCGwo\n\nDirected by Craig Moss (The 41-Year-Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It), the film is being released straight to DVD sometime in 2014."
