        "text": "Independent film can always be counted on to get together some truly unique assemblies of talent, and the dark indie comedy Killing Winston Jones is no exception. Variety has word that Richard Dreyfuss, Danny Glover, Jon Heder (Napoleon Dynamite) and Danny Masterson (\"That 70's Show\") will star in the new film set up as the first feature from Radioactive Giant, a shingle set up by first-time producers Albert Sandoval and Daemon Hillin. In addition, Avatar and \"Bones\" star Joel David Moore will direct the film from a script by newcomer Justin T. Winters with production starting next Monday in Georgia.\n\nThe story follows a sixth-grade English teacher (Masterson) who's on a mission to get the newly constructed junior high gymnasium named after his father (Dreyfuss), despite the fact that being dead is one of the requirements. This action apparently leads to a bitter contest over the naming rights with his old rival (Glover). We're not sure how Heder comes into play, but just seeing these guys on screen together is intriguing in itself. I'd imagine this is one of those wrongful death with a series of unfortunate mishaps kind of dark comedies judging by content and title, and we look forward to seeing this at a festival or something."
