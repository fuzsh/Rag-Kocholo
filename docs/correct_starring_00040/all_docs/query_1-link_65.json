        "text": "‘Phffft’ (1954)\n\nOne of the better uses of onomatopoeia in a movie title, true, but its dismissive tone reads like the movie was named by a passive-aggressive teenager.\n\nRead more Attack of the B Movies! 50 of the Best Schlocky Titles of All Time\n\n‘Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx’ (1970)\n\nThe title seems more like a statement of fact as opposed to a clue to the narrative of the Gene Wilder comedy.\n\n‘Blackenstein’ (1974)\n\nThe blaxploitation horror film, loosely inspired by Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, was meant to cash in on the success of Blacula.\n\n‘Zardoz’ (1974)\n\nJohn Boorman’s 1974 sci-fi flick is named after a homicidal floating stone head that travels across the postapocalyptic landscape of a futuristic Earth. But, most importantly, Zardoz gave us post-Bond Sean Connery in a linen Speedo, thigh-high boots and a braid.\n\nRead more Hollywood's 100 Favorite Films — in Just Four Minutes (Video)\n\n‘Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo’ (1984)\n\nThe predecessor to the 1984 break-dancing film was simply titled Breakin’, mercifully free of any \"Boogaloos.\"\n\n‘Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes’ (1984)\n\nThere is something to be said for brevity and, whatever that may be, the people who came up with this title never had it said to them.\n\nRead more Best of 2014: Hollywood's A-List Reveal Their Favorites\n\n‘C.H.U.D.’ (1984)\n\nThe title of the horror flick stands for “cannibalistic humanoid underground dweller,” which sounds far more interesting than the nonsense acronym.\n\n‘Leonard Part 6’ (1987)\n\nThe parody spy movie stars Bill Cosby as a CIA agent turned restaurateur who battles a vegetarian trying to take over the world with magical meat given to him by a gypsy, but you wouldn’t have guessed it by the title. No word on what magical foodstuffs were used in parts 1 through 5, given that the movies don't actually exist.\n\n‘Drop Dead Fred’ (1991)\n\n\"Drop Dead Fred\" is the full name of the childhood imaginary friend of an emotionally repressed housewife played by actress Phoebe Cates.\n\nRead more Hollywood's Favorite Thrillers: 19 Movies That Will Terrify You\n\n‘F.A.R.T: The Movie’ (1991)\n\nThe crude title belongs to a movie that is about exactly what you would expect it to be about.\n\n‘V.I. Warshawski’ (1991)\n\nKathleen Turner stars as a private eye with an impossible-to-pronounce last name.\n\n‘Operation Dumbo Drop’ (1995)\n\nThe movie is not the sequel to the Disney animated classic, wherein Dumbo mysteriously loses his power of flight at a very inopportune moment, but it sure sounds like it.\n\nRead more Hollywood Stars' Favorite Surfing Locations Revealed\n\n‘To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar’ (1995)\n\nWesley Snipes, Patrick Swayze and John Leguizamo play New York City drag queens who road trip to Hollywood to appear in the Miss Drag Queen of America Pageant. The title is taken from a photo that they carry in their car signed by actress Julie Newmar, who played Catwoman in the 1960s Batman television show.\n\n‘The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain’ (1995)\n\nIt reads more like a haiku and less like the title of a Hugh Grant World War I movie.\n\n‘Santa With Muscles’ (1996)\n\nAt first, the title sounds oxymoronic until you find out that Hulk Hogan plays a guy who gets amnesia and think he is Santa Claus, at which point the title make sense but the movie doesn’t.\n\nRead more From 'Blade Runner' to 'Star Wars': Hollywood's Favorite Sci-Fi Films\n\n‘8 Heads in a Duffel Bag’ (1997)\n\nJoe Pesci plays a mobster who is charged with transporting a duffel bag full of severed heads to his boss. Perhaps a bit too on-the-nose.\n\n‘Teaching Mrs. Tingle’ (1999)\n\nThe title for the teacher-student dramedy, starring Helen Mirren and Katie Holmes, sounds like a lesser-known Dr. Seuss book.\n\n‘eXistenZ’ (1999)\n\nIt is one thing to have a title that is a made-up word, but it is another to throw randomized capitalization in the mix.\n\nRead more Hollywood's Favorite Films: 7 Musicals to Get Your Toes Tapping\n\n‘?Dude, Where’s My Car?’ (2000)\n\nThe title of this Seann William Scott–Ashton Kutcher buddy comedy where he misplaces his car is appropriate, but that doesn’t mean it’s good.\n\n‘Freddy Got Fingered’ (2001)\n\nOf the crudely titled film, critic Roger Ebert wrote: “This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels.”\n\n‘Riding in Cars With Boys’ (2001)\n\nThis banal title for the coming-of-age tale starring Drew Barrymore doesn’t exactly fill moviegoers with excitement and anticipation.\n\nRead more 'SNL' 40 Red Carpet: Past Stars, Current Cast Recall Favorite Moments, Working With \"Childhood Heroes\"\n\n‘Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones’ (2002)\n\n‘Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever’ (2002)\n\nThe comically titled action-thriller stars Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu as FBI agents, Ecks and Sever.\n\nRead more Hollywood Vaccination Fail: Why L.A. Schoolkids Are Getting Sick\n\n‘From Justin to Kelly’ (2003)\n\nThe musical starred American Idol Season 1 winner and runner-up, Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini, and it has the title to prove it!\n\n‘Gigli’ (2003)\n\nThe Kevin Smith movie, made at the height of the Bennifer craze, boasts a title that reads like an Italian dessert.\n\nRead more Hollywood's Favorite Thrillers: 19 Movies That Will Terrify You\n\n‘I ? Huckabee’ (2004)\n\nDavid O. Russell may be one of the few directors brave enough to use an emoji in the title of his movie.\n\n‘Dreamer: Inspired By a True Story’ (2005)\n\nLike Secretariat and Seabiscuit, Dreamer is a racehorse that had to overcome incredible adversity to become a champion. Unlike Secretariat and Seabiscuit, Dreamer had owners that had very little imagination when it came to naming their horse.\n\n‘Herbie: Fully Loaded’ (2005)\n\nThe movie starred Lindsay Lohan, Michael Keaton and Matt Dillon and was the first Herbie film to be released since 198 —- that incarnation was titled Herbie Goes Bananas. So, the Herbie property has always had a hard time with titles.\n\nRead more Hollywood's Vaccine Wars: L.A.’s \"Entitled\" Westsiders Behind City’s Epidemic\n\n‘The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl’ (2005)\n\nThe Robert Rodriguez action-adventure starred a young Taylor Lautner who played a who that had the powers of a shark and was a part of a superhero duo whose other half was a girl that could spew lava from her hands. A prospective sequel, titled Barracuda Lad and Earthquake Lady, was ultimately shelved.\n\n‘?Who’s Your Caddy’ (2007)\n\nThe title for the movie, which stars Big Boi as a rap mogul/golf enthusiast, is a pun that only a Dad could love.\n\n‘You Don’t Mess With the Zohan’ (2008)\n\nThe title makes moviegoers not want to mess with the Adam Sandler comedy, where he plays an Israeli commando-turned-NYC hairstylist.\n\n‘Surfer, Dude’ (2008)\n\nThis cheesy title belongs to a Matthew McConaughey flick where he plays a surfer who contemplates riding virtual waves when the Malibu swell seems permanently out to sea.\n\nRead more Hollywood's 100 Favorite Films List: Surprising Facts and Stats\n\n‘Quantum of Solace’ (2008)\n\nThe title of the Bond film may sound like a line of dialogue out of The Theory of Everything, but it is defined as the precise measurement of comfort and emotion needed between two lovers.\n\n‘The Hottie & the Nottie’ (2008)\n\nHonestly, what could the moviegoing public expect from the title of a Paris Hilton comedic vehicle?\n\nRead more Adulterers' Favorite Place to Meet and Cheat in Hollywood Is … Comfort Inn?!\n\n‘Love Guru’ (2008)\n\nSNL expat Mike Myers plays a self-help expert who grew up in an Indian ashram and has since returned to America to impart his wisdom on his hordes of followers.\n\nRead more 'SNL' 40 Red Carpet: Past Stars, Current Cast Recall Favorite Moments, Working With \"Childhood Heroes\"\n\n‘Cirque du Freak: The Vampire’s Assistant’ (2009)\n\nThe film title reads like a long-forgotten Cirque du Soliel show that was trying to capitalize on the Twilight craze but received a very short run.\n\n‘The Men Who Stare at Goats’ (2009)\n\nThe George Clooney movie follows a journalist who uncovers the U.S. military's attempt to employ paranormal powers in combat missions. For the moviegoers who are unaware of the film’s plot, they may be led to believe that their movie-watching experience will consist of them staring at men who are, in turn, staring at goats.\n\n‘Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole’ (2010)\n\nIt is the one of the better titles given to a movie about legendary warrior owls, but, to be fair, there isn’t a whole lot of competition in the very narrow category of avian armadas.\n\n‘We Bought a Zoo’ (2011)\n\nIt’s an apt title for a movie where Matt Damon literally buys a zoo, but it also leaves little to the imagination.\n\n‘No’ (2012)\n\nThe incredibly succinct title belongs to the Oscar-nominated Gael Garcia Bernal movie about an ad executive who comes up with a campaign to defeat Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.\n\nRead more Best of 2014: Hollywood's A-List Reveal Their Favorites\n\n‘Rise of the Guardians’ (2012)\n\nThere is a sense of import in this title that usually isn’t reserved for an animated kids movie that prominently features a sword-wielding, tatted-up, Russian-accented Santa Claus.\n\n‘John Carter’ (2012)\n\nJudging solely by the ambiguous title, John Carter star Taylor Kitsch could be playing a Civil War veteran who mysteriously wakes up on the surface of Mars or a CPA from Wichita. Who’s to say?\n\n‘It Follows’ (2014)\n\nThe dubious nature of the critically acclaimed horror film is existential-crisis-inducing, leaving moviegoers to think things like: What is this “it” or who is this “it”? Is the “it” in all of us? Are we the “it”?\n\nRead more Hollywood's 100 Favorite Films\n\n‘Edge of Tomorrow’ (2014)\n\nThe movie where Tom Cruise plays a soldier who is charged with fighting an invincible alien army over and over again sounds like a throwaway title for a CBS soap opera. It was adapted from the Japanese novel All You Need Is Kill, which was arguably a better title. The movie was marketed with the tagline Live. Die. Repeat., which sounds like threatening instructions on the back of a shampoo bottle.\n\n‘Focus’ (2015)\n\nMany moviegoers complained that the title and print campaign for Will Smith and Margot Robbie's con man movie was too vague.\n\nRead more Hollywood's 100 Favorite Films\n\n‘Bad Ass 3: Bad Asses on the Bayou’ (2015)\n\nThis is the third installment of the Bad Ass franchise, where Danny Trejo and Danny Glover play vigilantes who leave Los Angeles. In the threequel the duo travel to Louisiana to rescue a kidnapped friend, meaning the Bad Ass title has transcended multiple films and state lines.\n\n‘Aloha’ (2015)\n\nBased on the title, you wouldn't guess that this Cameron Crowe movie is about a celebrated military contractor (Bradley Cooper) who returns to the site of his greatest career triumphs — the U.S. Space program in Honolulu –— and reconnects with a long-ago love (Rachel McAdams) while unexpectedly falling for the hard-charging Air Force watchdog (Emma Stone) assigned to him. This is actually the third title for the film, which was formerly called both Deep Tiki and Volcano Romance.\n\nRead more From 'Blade Runner' to 'Star Wars': Hollywood's Favorite Sci-Fi Films"
