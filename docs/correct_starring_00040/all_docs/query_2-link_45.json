Perhaps the strangest thing about 2012 is that the bad parts of the film are among the most enjoyable, b...\n\nAntz\n\nIn the Magic Kingdom, they must be getting nervous. For years, Disney has had a death grip on the animated market, but, as we enter the latter years of the 1990s, the corporation that gave us Bambi and Snow White is finding their dominance cha...\n\nBe Kind Rewind\n\nDespite some solid laughs and a feel-good ending, Michael Gondry's Be Kind Rewind exists far from the mainstream and its appeal will be limited to those who embrace the kind of awkward quirkiness that defines the production. This comedy/fantasy/dra...\n\nBeloved\n\nBeloved, Jonathan Demme's much-anticipated adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel, is a powerful and disturbing motion picture that is likely to leave many movie-goers unsettled as they file out of the theater.

Since the answer is \"yes,\" this says something about the fle...\n\nDreamgirls\n\nDreamgirls is a wonderful entertainment: a musical that, while not skimping on the music, delivers a multi-layered storyline featuring complex characters. The average Hollywood musical focuses on spectacle and, while there's some of that to be fou...\n\nHoneydripper\n\nJohn Sayles is one of the last true independent American filmmakers. Honeydripper is his 16th feature and he has made all of them on his own terms without studio interference. (He sells them to distributors once they are in the can.) To date, his...\n\nJumanji: The Next Level\n\nPerhaps there are interesting directions in which the filmmakers could have taken the Jumanji series â after all, the 2017 reboot, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, was vast improvement over the mid-1990s original.
