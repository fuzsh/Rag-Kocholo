Thandie Newton, Danny Glover and Oliver Platt have all joined the film about parallel universes, doppelgangers and a race to prevent a world-ending event that was predicted by the Mayans.\n\nGlover is in line to play the president, with Newton as his daughter and Platt as his chief of staff (hey, nice promotion from The West Wing). John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor are already on board.\n\nThe film is set to start shooting next month, with a July 2009 release planned.\n\nJust so you know, whilst we may receive a commission or other compensation from the links on this website, we never allow this to influence product selections - read why you should trust us"
