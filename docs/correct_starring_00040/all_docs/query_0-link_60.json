        "text": "Writer, director, producer and Lake Alfred native Jeremiah Hatfield and a crew of locals began filming a movie last month that starred local talent and brought famed actor Danny Glover to Polk County.\n\nThe movie was filmed in multiple locations in central Florida including the MacKay House, Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse, Camp Mack River Resort, Ron's Tackle Box, and L.A. Bar and Grill.\n\nHatfield said the almost century old MacKay House in Lake Alfred was the perfect spot for filming Short Bus Productions' new mystery thriller: \"The Lighthouse.\" The shoot was homecoming too.\n\n\"It was really cool to be home,\" said Shane Hartline, 25, a Lake Wales native who moved to Los Angeles to become an actor. \"This was an amazing experience, and it's cool to shoot this big film in our small town.\"\n\nFilming for the spine-chilling, mystery, thriller ended Sept. 5.\n\nHatfield, 35, is known for writing and directing the television series \"Reality Rednecks\" and began writing The Lighthouse nine years ago. Hatfield collaborated with Samuel Morris to write the haunting tale where a curious group of friends seek a legendary lighthouse that possesses an ominous past. Death and suspicion arise upon the group, and they soon realize that things are not always what they seem.\n\nStarring an array of notable actors such as Glover and Byron Cherry, this film also features some fairly fresh faces such as Hartline, Kurt Angle, Gabriella Stone, and Hatfield.\n\nAlthough Hartline vaguely knew Hatfield before he received the role of Tripp, he was introduced to this opportunity by his friend Andrew Martinet. When Hatfield met Hartline, it was obvious that he had to have a role in this movie.\n\n\"Working with such an experienced actor such as Danny Glover was a rare opportunity,\" Hartline said. The cast \"became close friends and pulled it together for the intense scenes.\"\n\nHartline hopes that the audience sees brilliancy in what he calls a gritty, classic thriller.\n\n\"It has a big twist, and it's not what you expect. It feels very real,\" Hartline said.\n\n\"The Lighthouse\" cast and crew worked long hours for six days and nights at the MacKay House, a favorite spot for weddings in Lake Alfred. The Lake Alfred Fire Department was on scene for the filming.\n\nThe L.A. Bar and Grill and Ron's Tackle Box, both in Lake Alfred, also make appearances in the film. Hatfield thought the bar had an appealing rawness and animated employees. Ron's Tackle Box in Lake Alfred was portrayed as a decrepit convenient store.\n\nThe film also features Camp Mack River Resort in Lake Wales, where Mack's owners, employees, guests, and even the surrounding neighbors helped in filming -- some neighbors even lent a car to the production.\n\nBut for the lighthouse, filmmakers had to look outside land-locked Polk. Instead, they used the lighthouse at The Ponce de Leon Inlet -- the tallest lighthouse in Florida. It was the eerie lighthouse in the film and the scene of the only cable fall in history to take place in a lighthouse, Hatfield said.\n\nThe film is the second feature film shot in Polk County in the last few years, but won't be the last, Hatfield said.\n\n\"I couldn't have asked for better,\" Hatfield said. \"The whole crew was wonderful. They were the biggest blessing. I will definitely film in Central Florida again.\"\n\nA release date for \"The Lighthouse\" has not yet been chosen yet."
