        "text": "(born 1947). American actor, producer, and social activist Danny Glover played both heroes and villains throughout a film career that called for versatility. He was perhaps best known for starring opposite Mel Gibson as a cautious veteran detective in the action blockbuster Lethal Weapon (1987) and its three sequels (1989, 1992, and 1998). Glover appeared in many independent films as well as major Hollywood pictures, taking roles in dramas, comedies, action flicks, and horror films. He also made a number of appearances on television shows and acted on the stage.\n\nGlover was born on July 22, 1947, in San Francisco, California. He studied acting at San Francisco State College and trained at the Black Actors Workshop of the American Conservatory Theater. His stage work included South African dramatist Athol Fugard’s plays Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and “Master Harold”… and the Boys. Glover played heroes in several films, including Places in the Heart (1984), Silverado (1985), Lethal Weapon, and Bat-21 (1988). He played villains in Witness (1985) and The Color Purple (1985), in which he gave an acclaimed performance as “Mr.” He also portrayed South African leader Nelson Mandela in a television biography, Mandela (1987), and had major roles in the television miniseries Chiefs (1983) and Lonesome Dove (1989). Glover appeared in the television movie Freedom Song in 1990.\n\nIn the 1990s Glover acted in such films as To Sleep with Anger (1990), Predator 2 (1990), Bopha! (1993), and Beloved (1998). His numerous and varied later films included The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), Saw (2004), Dreamgirls (2006), Poor Boy’s Game (2007), Shooter (2007), Honeydripper (2007), 2012 (2009), Death at a Funeral (2010), Tula: The Revolt (2013), Waffle Street (2015), and Mr. Pig (2016). Glover made his directorial debut with Just a Dream in 2002."
