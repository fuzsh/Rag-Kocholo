        "text": "GAINESVILLE, Fla. — Actor and activist Danny Glover will be the keynote speaker on Jan. 25 as part of the UF MLK Celebration 2012 at the University of Florida.\n\n“A Night with Danny Glover” will take place at 7 p.m. in the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. Through an informal conversation, Glover will share his experiences that embody the ideals of the Rev.

Following the community service, the volunteers will gather to reflect on the work and how it relates to King’s values. Dave Kratzer, interim vice president for student affairs, will speak. At noon, a march starts at Bo Diddley Community Plaza in downtown Gainesville and continues to the MLK Multipurpose Center near Waldo Road.\n\nA panel conversation at 11:45 a.m. Jan. 17 will provide students with information on how they can leave a legacy through student involvement on campus.
