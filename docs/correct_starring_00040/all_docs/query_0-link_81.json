The actor dropped his debut feature, “Abel,” in 2010 and it was followed by biopic “Cesar Chavez” in 2014. And this year, he hit the Sundance Film Festival with his latest and quirkiest, “Mr. Pig,” and first international trailer has landed for the dramedy.\n\nREAD MORE: 15 Great Directorial Debuts By Actors\n\nDanny Glover and Maya Ruldolph are the unlikely leading duo in the story that follows a pig farmer, on the brink of losing everything, who hits the road with this daughter to find a final resting place for his beloved swine, Howie. Here’s the synopsis from Park City:\n\nEubanks (Danny Glover), an old-school pig farmer from Georgia on the brink of losing his family farm, sets off on a road trip with Howard, his beloved and very large pig. As they make their way across the border to Mexico to find “Howie” a new home, Eubanks’ drinking and deteriorating health begin to take a toll, derailing their plans. His estranged daughter, Eunice (Maya Rudolph), is forced to join them on their adventure. Driven by strong convictions and stubbornness in his old ways, Eubanks attempts to make peace through his devotion to Howie and desire to mend his broken relationships."
