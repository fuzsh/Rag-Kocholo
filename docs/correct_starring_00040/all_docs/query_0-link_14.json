        "text": "2012\n\nIf, as is believed in certain fringe circles, the world will come to an end in 2012, at least there will be no more movies like this one made. Perhaps the strangest thing about 2012 is that the bad parts of the film are among the most enjoyable, b...\n\nAntz\n\nIn the Magic Kingdom, they must be getting nervous. For years, Disney has had a death grip on the animated market, but, as we enter the latter years of the 1990s, the corporation that gave us Bambi and Snow White is finding their dominance cha...\n\nBe Kind Rewind\n\nDespite some solid laughs and a feel-good ending, Michael Gondry's Be Kind Rewind exists far from the mainstream and its appeal will be limited to those who embrace the kind of awkward quirkiness that defines the production. This comedy/fantasy/dra...\n\nBeloved\n\nBeloved, Jonathan Demme's much-anticipated adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel, is a powerful and disturbing motion picture that is likely to leave many movie-goers unsettled as they file out of the theater. Although the movie probably runs a litt...\n\nBlindness\n\nIt has been said that one of the greatest fears expressed by human beings is to be suddenly struck blind - plunged into a blankness into which sound but no light can penetrate. Imagine this happening not to one person but to an entire population. ...\n\nDead Don't Die, The\n\nIn The Dead Don’t Die, we get a glimpse of The Zombie Apocalypse according to hipster director Jim Jarmusch and, as one might expect, it doesn’t resemble what we have come to expect based on the movies of George A. Romero or the TV series ...\n\nDeath at a Funeral\n\nDeath at a Funeral addresses the question of whether a British comedy featuring a bunch of white guys can translate into an American setting with a group of (primarily) black characters. Since the answer is \"yes,\" this says something about the fle...\n\nDreamgirls\n\nDreamgirls is a wonderful entertainment: a musical that, while not skimping on the music, delivers a multi-layered storyline featuring complex characters. The average Hollywood musical focuses on spectacle and, while there's some of that to be fou...\n\nHoneydripper\n\nJohn Sayles is one of the last true independent American filmmakers. Honeydripper is his 16th feature and he has made all of them on his own terms without studio interference. (He sells them to distributors once they are in the can.) To date, his...\n\nJumanji: The Next Level\n\nPerhaps there are interesting directions in which the filmmakers could have taken the Jumanji series – after all, the 2017 reboot, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, was vast improvement over the mid-1990s original.
