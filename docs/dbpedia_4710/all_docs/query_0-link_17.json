        "text": "This release contains: 1 Related Document\n\nSouthwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) announced today that its Flight Dispatchers, represented by the Transport Workers Union (TWU 550), have voted in favor of a new four-year contract. The agreement was ratified by 95 percent of Southwest's Dispatchers and replaces the group's previous contract well ahead of the November (2015) amendable date. The new collective bargaining agreement provides pay increases, as well as opportunities for bonuses tied to Company and Employee performance.\n\n\"I would like to thank our highly-skilled team of Dispatchers, along with their TWU representatives, for their continued partnership,\" said Matt Hafner, Southwest Airlines Vice President Network Operations Control. \"I am thrilled to have a new agreement that rewards our Employees and remains true to our legacy of being the number one low-cost carrier in the country.\"\n\nTWU 550 President Mike Connor said, \"The Company values our Dispatchers, as evidenced by this agreement. This group works around the clock to support the operation and plays a vital role in getting our passengers to their destinations safely and efficiently. We are committed to Southwest and are enthusiastic about the future of our Company.\"\n\nFAA-licensed Dispatchers are directly responsible for the conduct of safe and efficient flight operations and the dispatch, clearance, and movement of all Company aircraft. Their new agreement supports the Company's mission of providing its Employees a stable work environment and Southwest's core vision of being the World's Most Loved, Most Flown, and Most Profitable Airline.\n\nABOUT SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.\n\nIn its 44th year of service, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) continues to differentiate itself from other air carriers with exemplary Customer Service delivered by more than 47,000 Employees to more than 100 million Customers annually. Southwest operates more than 3,600 flights a day, serving 94 destinations across the United States and six additional countries. Southwest service to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, begins on June 7, 2015. Service to Belize City, Belize, begins October 15, 2015 and Liberia, Costa Rica, on November 1, 2015, both routes are subject to foreign government approval.\n\nBased on the U.S. Department of Transportation's most recent data, Southwest Airlines is the nation's largest carrier in terms of originating domestic passengers boarded. The Company operates the largest fleet of Boeing aircraft in the world, the majority of which are equipped with satellite-based WiFi providing gate-to-gate connectivity while over the United States. That connectivity enables Customers to use their personal devices to access streaming music provided by Beats Music or to view video on-demand movies and television shows, as well as nearly 20 channels of free, live TV compliments of our valued partners. Southwest is the only major U.S. airline to offer bags fly free® to everyone (first and second checked pieces of luggage, size and weight limits apply, some airlines may allow free checked bags on select routes or for qualified circumstances), and there are no change fees, though fare differences might apply. In 2014, the airline proudly unveiled a bold new look: Heart. The new aircraft livery, airport experience, and logo, showcase the dedication of Southwest Employees to connect Customers with what's important in their lives.\n\nFrom its first flights on June 18, 1971, Southwest Airlines launched an era of unprecedented affordability in air travel described by the U.S. Department of Transportation as \"The Southwest Effect,\" a lowering of fares and increase in passenger traffic whenever the carrier enters new markets. With 42 consecutive years of profitability, Southwest is one of the most honored airlines in the world, known for a triple bottom line approach that contributes to the carrier's performance and productivity, the importance of its People and the communities they serve, and an overall commitment to efficiency and the planet.
