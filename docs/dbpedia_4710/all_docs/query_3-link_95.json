        "text": "Business travelers account for 12% of airline passengers, but they are about twice as profitable as other passengers because they tend to spend more for better accommodations or last-minute travel plans.\n\nAside from the cost of tickets, airlines also collect additional fees from passengers that help to add to their profit margins.\n\nHow Airlines Make Money\n\nAirlines receive nearly 60% of their revenue from passengers directly (the other 40% comes from selling frequent flyer miles to credit card companies and other travel partners like hotels and car rental agencies). That revenue includes the cost of airfare, fees, and other travel expenses the airlines charge.\n\nBut of that 60% of passenger consumer revenue, the big money comes from business travelers—as opposed to those flying for leisure or personal reasons—in percentages that far outweigh the number of travelers. Business travelers account for 12% of all airline passengers, but they tend to buy more expensive seats, buy last-minute tickets, and are typically twice as profitable as other passengers. In fact, on some flights, business passengers represent 75% of an airline's revenues.\n\nCorporate Comforts\n\nCorporate travel policies used to emphasize saving money. However, (pre-pandemic, anyway), given the hassle-prone nature of air travel, managers often showed concern about employee comfort, convenience, and productivity—as it was counterproductive if an employee arrived too tired or stressed-out to do their job. So, businesses were often willing to pay more to book last-minute flights or non-stops options, though typically not seats in an elite section of the aircraft.\n\nFor senior executives or employees that are subject to special corporate travel policy consideration, first-class and business-class tickets cost considerably more than coach tickets. This premium pricing typically brings passengers better service and higher-quality amenities than economy ticket offerings. Business and premium consumer spending on these goods and services encourage competition among airlines for the most lucrative passengers. Many airlines, in order to lure new passengers, introduce innovative services or refit aircraft for more first-class legroom.\n\nBusiness travelers and high-end travelers also bring substantial revenue to airlines by purchasing additional services and using frequent flyer and other incentive programs.\n\nIncreasing Business Travel Focus\n\nAs a result of being able to bank larger revenues from business travelers, many airlines are now focusing attention on corporate trade. For example, Southwest Airlines—once known for its low frills and low fares—has begun to target business travel with a growing in-house department. The airline has also undertaken other efforts, including working with companies' travel managers to offer discounted fares or match a passenger’s status with other frequent flyer programs. In 2021, Southwest announced additional plans to target business travelers and expand that segment of its revenue.\n\nFrequent Flyer Programs and Airline Revenues\n\nFrequent flyer mileage programs are increasingly valuable to airlines, as business travelers and other first-class passengers link their credit cards to the programs and allow their consumption and spending behaviors to be tracked. High-income consumers have significant levels of disposable income to spend on a broad range of goods and services. Many businesses gather or purchase consumer spending data for use in developing a marketing strategy and product research and development.\n\nThe data airlines gather on high-end consumers using frequent flyer miles programs is extensive and tremendously profitable. Some frequent flyer programs are now considered worth many times the value of the airlines that own them, in fact. For most airlines, these incentive programs are an essential source of revenue and profitability that allow them to offer better pricing on tickets and more routes.\n\nMany companies benefit from this data and are willing to pay for programs that are inexpensive for the airline to operate. Not all miles or travel points earned by consumers are actually used due to lack of travel redemption or expiration (which is termed \"breakage\"), further lowering program costs and profit contribution.\n\nThe Bottom Line"
