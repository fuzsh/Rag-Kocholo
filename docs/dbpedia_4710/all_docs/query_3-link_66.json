The wands light up when it's dark.\n\nHow to apply\n\nIf you see an open Ramp Agent position posted, you can apply on careers.southwestair.com. If there are no open Ramp Agent positions posted, that means we're not interviewing for that job at this time.\n\nYou can only apply for a job at Southwest Airlines through this site. Fees don't fly here—we’ll never ask for a form of payment for your application or training."
