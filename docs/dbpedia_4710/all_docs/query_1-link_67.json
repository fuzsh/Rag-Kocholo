        "text": "BURBANK, Calif. (KCRA) - A nurse from California said she was forced off her Southwest Airlines flight and discriminated against for a genetic disorder that causes non-cancerous tumors to grow on her body.\n\nNurse Brianna Solari was set to board a Southwest flight around noon Thursday at the Hollywood-Burbank Airport. She has a genetic disorder known as neurofibromatosis that causes non-cancerous tumors to grow in the nervous system and skin.\n\n“I lack an enzyme, which is neurofibromin, which is a tumor suppressor. So, tumors grow along nerves and can be tiny, little pinpoint tumors, or they can be enormous. Some of them can be very disfiguring,” she said.\n\nSolari flew to Los Angeles for a surgery Wednesday to reduce tumors on her body. The next day, when she boarded her flight home to Sacramento, she says the flight crew approached her.\n\n“I exited the airplane, and they said, ‘Well, there’s been some concerns. Do you have any medical conditions, diseases?’ And I said, ‘No, I had surgery.’ That’s really none of their business what’s going on… And they said, ‘OK,’ so then he got on the telephone with somebody,” Solari said.\n\nThat somebody was a doctor contracted by the airline who allegedly refused to speak to her. She says she wanted to explain her condition to the doctor, but employees prevented her from doing so.\n\nSolari’s flight ultimately took off without her. She said she felt “humiliated, embarrassed [and] ashamed” by the incident.\n\n“It was already difficult enough with this condition because I did have some visible tumors on my face and my arms, and people would comment,” she said.\n\nAfter Solari obtained a letter from her surgeon clearing her to fly, Southwest booked her on a new flight.\n\n“It’s really hard to quantify what it’s like to be singled out for a medical condition and for how you look, something that I really can’t help. I did try to cover up as best I could,” she said.\n\nIn an attempt to remedy the situation, Southwest gave Solari a $500 flight voucher and a $45 meal voucher, but the nurse says she plans to take legal action against the airline.\n\n“I don’t think I’ll ever fly them again. I think this could have been handled much more professionally. They should have waited until they had all of the information before making a decision that ultimately impacted my day, my flight, my traveling and my overall perspective on Southwest,” Solari said.\n\nShe calls the incident “discrimination” that violated her medical privacy.\n\n“This is absolutely discrimination. … I just said I had surgery, and that should be it. They shouldn’t be prying into my private medical information,” she said."
