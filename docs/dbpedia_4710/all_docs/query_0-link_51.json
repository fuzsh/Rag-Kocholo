A wave of mergers and acquisitions during the 2000s and 2010s resulted in a consolidated airline industry in the United States that winnowed the number of major operators.

        "text": "In 2009, Delta employed approximately 53,000 staff, but the workforce increased to over 80,000 at the beginning of 2010. The change coincides with the airline’s merger with Northwest Airlines, which was announced in 2008 as both carriers were experiencing steep revenue losses during the economic downturn in the US At the close of 2009, the FAA awarded a single operating certificate to Delta and Northwest, and the Northwest brand was discontinued in 2010. Check out our rundown of the merger to find out more.\n\n3United Airlines\n\nNot far behind Delta is United Airlines, with 98,831 employees. This includes 82,153 full-time and 16,678 part-time personnel. Like American and Delta, United’s historical workforce numbers shed light on significant events in the company’s history. The airline employed close to 102,000 people in early 2001, but there was an immediate decline of about 20,000 following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. United filed for bankruptcy in December 2002; it operated approximately 20% of all domestic flights at that time.\n\n4Southwest Airlines\n\nLow-cost carrier Southwest Airlines comes in fourth on the list with 72,007 employees. The airline employs 70,590 full-time and 1,417 part-time staff. Its workforce increased from about 39,000 in the first quarter of 2012 to nearly 47,000 in April 2012. The expansion can be attributed to the airline’s acquisition of AirTran in 2011.\n\nBy acquiring AirTran, Southwest gained 21 cities to its network, seven of which were in international markets. The airline worked to integrate AirTran’s operations in Atlanta, Georgia, such that business ran similarly to its focus cities in the rest of the country. This strategic acquisition helped position the carrier as one of the largest airlines with staying power in the US market.\n\n5JetBlue\n\nJetBlue rounds out our list with 23,603 employees, 19,272 full-time, and 4,331 on a part-time basis. JetBlue’s story differs from the other operators on the list because it is comparably newer to the industry. The airline burst onto the scene under the name “NewAir” in 2000 with a staff of 450. Headquartered in New York, it entered service with East Coast routes.\n\nNewAir aimed to provide another low-fare option for travelers, but with an advanced experience to set the airline apart from existing budget carriers. This included offering inflight entertainment like satellite radio and television at every seat.\n\nJetBlue was one of the few US airlines to earn a profit even after the decrease in air travel demand following September 11, 2001. The carrier’s employment numbers have steadily grown since it began operating, including during the lengthy economic recession that started in 2008.\n\nEmployment data for this list was pulled from the US Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics and was current as of June 2023. US cargo and passenger airlines added nearly 2,000 jobs in June, an increase of about eight % over the same period in pre-pandemic 2019. Close to 802,000 total employees were working in the airline industry as of June 2023.\n\nThis list focuses on passenger airlines, but the operator with the largest staff is Federal Express, with 251,096 total personnel."
