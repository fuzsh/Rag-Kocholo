        "text": "Airline donated travel for special Honor Flight in commemoration of the 70th Anniversary of V.E. Day and participates in the #GoSilent social media campaign in honor of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice\n\nSouthwest Airlines® (NYSE: LUV) proudly sponsors Honor Flight Network and donated more than $20,000 in air travel for nearly 50 Lone Eagle Veterans and their guardians to participate in a special Honor Flight and V.E. Day 70th Anniversary commemoration event in Washington, D.C. The event in early May included a massive flyover of WWII aircraft and a ceremony at the WWII Memorial, during which Southwest provided refreshments and snacks to Veterans in attendance. The Veterans also spent the day visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Air Force Memorial, as well as the Arlington National Cemetery for the Changing of the Guard.\n\n\"Memorial Day is a day for us all to take time to remember our fallen soldiers and pay tribute to those who have sacrificed their lives while protecting our freedom,\" said Linda Rutherford, Vice President Communication and Outreach for Southwest Airlines. \"The 70th anniversary of V.E. Day celebration was an opportunity for all of us at Southwest Airlines to recognize the selfless service of our WWII Veterans to our country. Through our national partnership with Honor Flight Network, we feel fortunate to provide travel to so many men and women who bravely served our country and connect them with the memorials that honor their fellow soldiers who lost their lives in battle.\"\n\nSouthwest has been a longtime supporter of Honor Flight Network, donating more than $3 million in travel to chapters across the United States since 2009 to support its mission to provide Veterans with honor and closure by organizing trips to Washington, D.C., to visit memorials built to recognize their service to the nation. This special donation helps Lone Eagles, Veterans who do not have a local chapter to assist them in visiting the memorials.\n\n\"The Honor Flight Network is humbly appreciative of the partnership that has been forged with Southwest Airlines since 2009. For our nation's Veterans from the WWII, Korean, and Vietnam Wars and terminally-ill Veterans alike, the opportunity given by Southwest Airlines is life-changing,\" said Jim McLaughlin, Chairman of Honor Flight Network.\n\nSouthwest also pays tribute this Memorial Day to those who have lost their lives while serving in the armed forces by joining Community Partner, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), in their #GoSilent social media campaign, which asks every American to pledge to stop what they're doing at 12:01pm EDT, and join them for a national moment of silence to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice. Southwest will participate by pledging a moment of silence on social media and encouraging others to do the same. #GoSilent will coincide with IAVA laying a wreath before the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery, a ceremony on the USS Intrepid in New York City, and participating Memorial Day events across the country.\n\nSouthwest is dedicated to those who have served and are serving in the military and is committed to employing, supporting, and honoring those who have sacrificed to ensure the nation's freedom.\n\nIn addition to Southwest being named by Victory Media, publisher of G.I. Jobs and Military Spouse, a Top 100 Military-Friendly Employer for the sixth consecutive year, CivilianJobs.com recently named Southwest as a winner of the 2015 Most Valuable Employers for Military.\n\nABOUT SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.\n\nIn its 44th year of service, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) continues to differentiate itself from other air carriers with exemplary Customer Service delivered by more than 47,000 Employees to more than 100 million Customers annually.
