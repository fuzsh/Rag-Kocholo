        "text": "Dear Sisters and Brothers:\n\nIAM District 142 was contacted by Southwest Airlines leadership regarding paid parking for our members who work at a station or crew base. The company has announced that paid parking for those employees will be available beginning September 1, 2023.\n\nThe company shared the following details with the union:\n\nNo action is needed for many Employees. Those who currently pay out of pocket (either directly to the airport or via payroll deduction) will no longer have to incur that expense.\n\nFor the cost to be fully covered, Employees will need to park at the designated Employee parking facility, as determined by each Station or Crew Base.\n\nCommuting Pilots, Flight Attendants, and Tech Ops Employees who don’t have access to designated Employee parking will submit an expense report via Concur (expense reporting tool) for reimbursement up to $60 per month.\n\nThis new offering will only be available for Employee parking, not for ridesharing or public transit. Southwest has a separate process for work transportation.\n\nEach Station will manage the relationship with their local parking vendor(s) and automate the billing process for Employee parking. Vendors will invoice Southwest and parking costs will be managed by Station/Base Leadership.\n\nAdditional workgroup-specific information and FAQs will be provided by the company in department news this week (GO News, Inflight Info on the Go, On the Radar, and Tech Ops News). Your union will also pass along any new updates we get from the company.\n\nYour union fought hard to help get this provision implemented for our members and we are pleased to see it now become a reality. If you have any questions or concerns please reach out to your shop stewards or general chairs. With best wishes we remain\n\nSincerely and fraternally,\n\nJohn M. Coveny, Jr.\n\nPresident/Directing General Chair\n\nDOWNLOAD/PRINT PDF VERSION OF THIS BULLETIN"
