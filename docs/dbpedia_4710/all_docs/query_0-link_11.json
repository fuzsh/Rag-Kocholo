        "text": "Carrier celebrates milestone of 180 daily departures to 50 nonstop destinations from Dallas Love Field\n\nThe People of Southwest Airlines® (NYSE: LUV) today began operating the carrier's most robust schedule ever offered at Dallas Love Field, with 180 daily departures to 50 nonstop destinations across the United States. New flights now bring Customers nonstop service options between Dallas Love Field and Boston (Logan); Detroit; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Charlotte; Charleston, S.C.; Raleigh-Durham; Omaha; and Salt Lake City.\n\n\"Southwest is offering something no other airline can offer from Dallas Love Field: an unmatched number of cities available on a nonstop basis,\" said Bob Jordan, Southwest Airlines' Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. \"With these flights, we're bringing more seats, more low fares, and the time-saving itineraries our Customers want without nickel and diming them.\"\n\nIn October 2014, most federal flight restrictions at Dallas Love Field lifted, allowing Southwest the opportunity to expand nonstop service at its hometown airport and bring new low-fare competition between the Dallas metro area and major destinations across the country. Before the restrictions were repealed, Southwest served 16 destinations with nonstop service.\n\nThe carrier today also began the first nonstop flights between Columbus, Ohio and Oakland (San Francisco Bay Area) and between Columbus and Boston (Logan). In addition, the carrier is adding a third daily flight between Columbus and Atlanta. At Washington, D.C. (Reagan National), Southwest is inaugurating new nonstop service between the nation's capital and Ft. Lauderdale/Hollywood International. On the west coast, Southwest is adding new nonstop service between Orange County/Santa Ana and Portland, Oregon.\n\nCustomers may book any of these new flights at Southwest.com or by phone at 800-I-FLY-SWA.\n\nABOUT SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.\n\nIn its 45th year of service, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) continues to differentiate itself from other air carriers with exemplary Customer Service delivered by more than 47,000 Employees to more than 100 million Customers annually. Southwest operates more than 3,600 flights a day, serving 95 destinations across the United States and six additional countries. Southwest service to Belize City, Belize, begins Oct. 15, 2015, and to Liberia, Costa Rica begins Nov. 1, 2015; both routes are subject to foreign government approval.\n\nBased on the U.S. Department of Transportation's most recent data, Southwest Airlines is the nation's largest carrier in terms of originating domestic passengers boarded. The Company operates the largest fleet of Boeing aircraft in the world, the majority of which are equipped with satellite-based WiFi providing gate-to-gate connectivity while over the United States. That connectivity enables Customers to use their personal devices to access streaming music provided by Apple Music or to view video on-demand movies and television shows, as well as nearly 20 channels of free, live TV compliments of our valued Partners. Southwest is the only major U.S. airline to offer bags fly free® to everyone (first and second checked pieces of luggage, size and weight limits apply, some airlines may allow free checked bags on select routes or for qualified circumstances), and there are no change fees, though fare differences might apply. In 2014, the airline proudly unveiled a bold new look: Heart. The new aircraft livery, airport experience, and logo, showcase the dedication of Southwest Employees to connect Customers with what's important in their lives.\n\nFrom its first flights on June 18, 1971, Southwest Airlines launched an era of unprecedented affordability in air travel described by the U.S. Department of Transportation as \"The Southwest Effect,\" a lowering of fares and increase in passenger traffic whenever the carrier enters new markets. With 42 consecutive years of profitability, Southwest is one of the most honored airlines in the world, known for a triple bottom line approach that contributes to the carrier's performance and productivity, the importance of its People and the communities they serve, and an overall commitment to efficiency and the planet.
