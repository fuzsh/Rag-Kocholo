        "text": "Facing growing pressure from employees, the top executives of US Airways said yesterday that they would not recommend breaking up the carrier when the airline's board meets next week.\n\nThe statement from Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman of US Airways, and Rakesh Gangwal, the chief executive, comes in the aftermath a decision by UAL's United Airlines to withdraw from its proposed $4.3 billion takeover of the airline.\n\nSince news of United's intentions came out last week, analysts and other industry experts have speculated that Mr. Wolf and Mr. Gangwal had few options but to sell parts of US Airways to rival carriers.\n\nWhen Mr. Gangwal met with the leaders of the airline's major unions on Friday, they told him that they would fight a dismantling of the airline and scolded him for not communicating better with the carrier's 47,000 employees during a difficult period.\n\nThat appears to have struck a chord. ''The uncertainty regarding a potential breakup weighs heavily on our employees,'' Mr. Wolf and Mr. Gangwal said yesterday, ''and we feel it is important to address this issue now.'' The two executives also acknowledged that they had received calls from competitors ''expressing interest in parts of the company.''\n\nHaving ruled out a breakup, yesterday's statement still leaves the question of what US Airways will do now. A US Airways spokesman declined to comment. But for months, Mr. Wolf and Mr. Gangwal have argued that the airline's survival is in doubt because it is neither a large carrier with an extensive route network like United nor a low-cost operator like its growing competitor, Southwest Airlines.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
