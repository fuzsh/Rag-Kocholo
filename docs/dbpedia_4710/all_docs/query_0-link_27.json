        "text": "It’s no secret that US airlines are dealing with staffing shortages. 47,000 people left their airline positions voluntarily during the start of the pandemic. Some flight attendants even feel that they are already at a “breaking point”. To address the problem, carriers are doing their best to hire new employees. However, airlines need more than flight attendants and pilots to make their passengers happy. US airlines also need to fill entry-level jobs like baggage handlers, cabin cleaners, aircraft fuelers, and more.\n\nSouthwest Airlines Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said that “Ground ops is where we’re finding the greatest competition for workers”. He added that “The fact that we can hire one or two is encouraging, but you still can’t grow any faster than the slowest group”.\n\nTransport Workers Union international vice president Gary Peterson said that all carriers are having a difficult time hiring new employees including entry-level jobs.\n\nHe said that “Airlines used to be a place where people flocked to work because their pay was good, the benefits were good. Today there are so many other options”.\n\nWhy Entry-Level Jobs are Hard to Fill\n\nNowadays, low-skill jobs are in demand from warehousing to distribution operations. Then, there are also airline-specific problems that could deter people from applying. Some candidates had to wait for weeks before they can begin a job. Then, some job positions will require year-round outdoor work.\n\nAndy Decker who is the CEO for Hofman USA, which is a recruiting company for airlines and contractors, thinks that “There are great jobs at the airlines, but there are great jobs available in all industries right now”.\n\nSome companies today are offering higher wages to attract the right people. CVS Health Corp, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, and Best Buy Co offered improved wages to get the right workers.\n\nThomas Rajan, vice president of global talent at American airlines said that “You need this aggressive ground game to go where candidates are”. He characterized the situation as “a battle” given the tough competition that they are dealing with."
