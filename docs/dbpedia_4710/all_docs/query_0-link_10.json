        "text": "~GSD&M to lead integrated marketing efforts for the airline’s loyalty program~\n\n~Marketing elements will carry out the brand’s focus on putting people first~\n\nAustin, TX—September 8, 2015 –GSD&M has been selected by Southwest Airlines as the strategic and creative lead for its Rapid Rewards® loyalty program. The full-service advertising agency will launch its first work for the program this coming fall, touting its perks such as no blackout dates, points not expiring, unlimited reward seats, and user-friendly experience.\n\nGSD&M has been Southwest Airlines’ agency of record for nearly 35 years. The relationship had expanded in recent years to include multicultural duties in addition to helping the brand reveal a new identity in September 2014. The partnership now continues to grow with the agency leading support efforts for the Rapid Rewards program.\n\n“GSD&M’s big ideas can make a positive impact on our loyalty program and what our brand truly stands for—both now and in the future,” said Jonathan Clarkson, Southwest’s Director of Rapid Rewards and Partnership Development. “We plan to benefit from GSD&M’s extensive knowledge and understanding of our business across all ideas, platforms and programs. For these reasons and more, GSD&M is a great choice for leading promotional efforts on Rapid Rewards.”\n\n“Providing strategic and creative direction for the Rapid Rewards program is a huge opportunity to work across multiple disciplines—brand, CRM/DR and multicultural,” said GSD&M president Marianne Malina. “We love this brand and the difference it makes in the marketplace. Programs like Rapid Rewards allow us to scream our differences in a fun and inspiring way.”\n\nAbout Rapid Rewards\n\nOriginally launched in 1987, Rapid Rewards Members earn points by flying or through qualifying purchases with our Partners. Members can redeem their points for every seat, every day, on every flight with absolutely no blackout dates or seat restrictions, and points won’t expire with any earning activity in a 24-month time period. Points are earned for every dollar spent on Southwest® flights. The amount of points earned is based on the fare and fare product purchased, and number of Rapid Rewards Points that are needed to redeem for flights varies based on destination, time, day of travel, demand, fare class, point redemption rate, and other factors. Rapid Rewards Points are also earned by spending with a variety of Rapid Rewards Partners. Rapid Rewards Credit Cardmembers can redeem their points for expanded international travel, gift cards, hotels, car rentals, merchandise, and more. Learn more about the program by visiting the Rapid Rewards website.\n\nAbout Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nIn its 45th year of service, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) continues to differentiate itself from other air carriers with exemplary Customer Service delivered by more than 47,000 Employees to more than 100 million Customers annually. Southwest operates more than 3,600 flights a day, serving 95 destinations across the United States and six additional countries. Southwest service to Belize City, Belize, begins Oct. 15, 2015. Subject to foreign government approval, service to Liberia, Costa Rica, begins Nov. 1, 2015.\n\nBased on the U.S. Department of Transportation’s most recent data, Southwest Airlines is the nation’s largest carrier in terms of originating domestic passengers boarded. The Company operates the largest fleet of Boeing aircraft in the world, the majority of which are equipped with satellite-based WiFi, providing gate-to-gate connectivity while over the United States. That connectivity enables Customers to use their personal devices to access streaming music provided by Apple Music or to view video on-demand movies and television shows as well as nearly 20 channels of free, live tv compliments of our valued Partners. Southwest is the only major U.S. airline to offer bags fly free® to everyone (First and second checked bags. Weight and size limits apply. Some airlines may allow free checked bags on select routes or for qualified circumstances), and there are no change fees, though fare differences might apply. In 2014, the airline proudly unveiled a bold new look: Heart. The new aircraft livery, airport experience, and logo, showcase the dedication of Southwest Employees to connect Customers with what’s important in their lives.\n\nFrom its first flights on June 18, 1971, Southwest Airlines launched an era of unprecedented affordability in air travel described by the U.S. Department of Transportation as “The Southwest Effect,” a lowering of fares and increase in Customer traffic whenever the carrier enters new markets. With 42 consecutive years of profitability, Southwest is one of the most honored airlines in the world, known for a triple bottom line approach that contributes to the carrier’s performance and productivity, the importance of its People and the communities they serve, and an overall commitment to efficiency and the planet.
