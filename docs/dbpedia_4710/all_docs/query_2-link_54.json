        "text": "As it prepares to enter its 50th year in business super-successful Southwest Airlines LUV is gearing up to do two things in January that it never has done before: post a huge annual loss and lay off workers.\n\nThe Dallas-based carrier – the largest in the nation based on the number of passengers boarded annually – lost a little bit of money way back in 1971, its first year in business, but has been profitable every year since. Now, however, that remarkable streak is guaranteed to end when Southwest reports its 2020 results in January. It already has lost nearly $2.2 billion through the first nine months of this year and continues to burn through cash at a rate of about $11 million a day in the current quarter. Thus, excluding likely year end accounting adjustments, the airline is on course to lose around $3 billion for all of 2020. That represents a previously unimaginable $5 billion negative swing from the $2.3 billion profit it earned in 2019.\n\nThat, of course, is the result of the near-collapse of air travel demand this year driven by the Covid-19 pandemic. And now, one way or another, the impact of that staggering change in fortunes soon will be felt by Southwest’s employees.\n\nAnd make no mistake about it, that’s the very clear message that Southwest’s management wants all of its unionized workers to comprehend. That’s because for the first time in the company’s history, it’s employees appear to have no way to escape the economic fallout of an industry-wide calamity like they’ve done so many times before.\n\nOn Friday, Southwest issued so-called WARN letters to 42 members of a small group of materials handlers and inventory clerks represented by the Teamsters Union. Congress several years ago required large companies to issue Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notifications in most cases at least 60 days before they are subject to being laid off.\n\nRecently the 322 members of that Teamsters-represented work group voted not to enter into pay concession talks with management. So, in response management sent the WARN letters telling those 42 materials handlers and inventory clerks that could be out of jobs as soon as Jan. 5 - unless their union agrees to management’s demand for 10% pay cuts for all members of their work group.\n\nSouthwest’s threat of layoff most decidedly is not about those 42 materials handlers. In fact, the savings from laying off just those 42 workers would be infinitesimal in view of the $22.5 billion in revenue Southwest raked in last year, and the nearly $3 billion operating profits it earned. But the mere threat of such seemingly modest layoffs are huge threat aimed at all 48,000 or so of the airline’s unionized workers.\n\nManagement is making it very clear now that every one of them now has a tough choice to make as to how they want to feel the impact of Covid-19 on their pocketbooks and lives. This time, management effectively is telling Southwest’s entire workforce, there will be no escape from the economic pain.\n\nIt’s an unusual position for Southwest employees to be in. Layoffs are a common thing at nearly all other airlines, and have been since carriers unionized in the post-World War II era. And we’ve seen that already this year. But there’s never been one layoff at Southwest until, possibly, this coming January.\n\nU.S. airline employment peaked at around 460,000 jobs in March, just before the pandemic forced carriers shrink their operations dramatically in the face of a near-total collapse in air travel demand. Now, Airlines For America, the industry’s trade group, says total employment in the industry will be around 370,000 by Dec. 1. Most carriers have offered financial incentives to get some workers to retire early or quit. But once restrictions against laying workers that were tied to Congress’ first $50 billion aid package to airlines expired on Sept. 30, carriers collectively laid off more than 50,000 employees.\n\nSouthwest’s management carefully has avoided saying exactly how many jobs would be cut if layoffs do become necessary. Nor have they detailed how the layoffs would be distributed across the airline’s many different workgroups. Some groups could see a much higher percentage of their members lose their jobs than others. The assumption has been that 10% of each work group would be let go, if necessary. But management could choose to make the cuts unevenly. As a result, every union member at Southwest likely is now trying to calculate what’s best for themselves individually and collectively.\n\nThat will make reaching a consensus among them very difficult.\n\nSuch increased uncertainty among the ranks is something airline managers clearly are trying to stoke. They believe – one assumes sincerely - that 10% pay cuts for everyone for one year, really is a better outcome overall, than layoffs of 10% or more of the workforce. But management also has preferred outcome for financial reasons as well.\n\nAt least in the short term pay cuts likely would be cheaper and more productive for the airline than laying off 5,000 to 10,000 employees. Laying off employees can be expensive up front because those being let go would receive some severance plus any pay and benefits owed to them immediately rather than over time. Insurance issues can get complicated and costly in the wake of layoffs, too. And as the carrier begins to grow again, all those it calls back to work from furlough will have to be re-trained and considerable expense. Conversely, pay cuts inherently would lower the airline’s monthly operating costs across a full year (management is promising that workers’ pay will snap back to 100% after a year or when the company reaches break even again if that happens first).\n\nHowever, for many, maybe even most employees keeping 100% of their pay is a better outcome than some percentage of their work cohort losing their jobs. High seniority workers, for example, have nothing to fear in terms of being laid off, so maintaining their full pay, understandably, will be their strong preference. That may sound heartless, but it makes sense from the perspective of senior employees. They are in peak earnings years and are focused in many cases on building their retirement savings. And because Southwest currently is operating only around 65% of its “normal” schedule, even the most senior employees have seen their pay reduced significantly. Over staffing means that instead of working the maximum number of hours allowable each month, many of them now are working at or just above the minimum number of hours a month that they are guaranteed to work.\n\nNew employees, on the other hand, likely are trying to determine how high up the seniority list the layoffs will reach and whether they might escape that fate. And the very newest workers in each job category probably are already starting to scout about for jobs they will need if the layoffs happen.\n\nStuck in the middle are unions leaders who historically are loath to ever negotiate pay concessions. The political nature of their positions makes it a near-certain career-killer for union bosses to lead their members into accepting such concessions. Accepting layoffs is not a good thing, either. But at least in that case union leaders can claim to have fought to the bloody end for their members rather than having caved into management demands for pay cuts.\n\nThat’s why Southwest’s management is now trying to paint the decision facing union leaders and their members at Southwest in the starkest terms possible. CEO Gary Kelly said last month in a video message to employees that the carrier is at least 20% over-staffed vis-à-vis its now reduced fleet of planes, shrunken flight schedule, and much smaller revenue. “Our ship is taking on water,” he said.\n\nKelly further explained that pay and benefits represent more than half of Southwest’s operating costs, and that even a 10% pay cut for all employees, will save the airline only about $500 million next year. And that’s not enough to make the airline profitable again in these remarkably negative market conditions.\n\nThus, even with pay cuts or layoffs - or some of both - Southwest’s costs will continue to be too high for the level of passenger traffic and revenue the airline now is seeing and expects to see through most or all of 2021. Thus, further ways of cutting costs and increasing revenue would still have to be found in the months ahead.\n\nBut that extra effort, Kelly said, will be worth it if the carrier can preserve all employees’ jobs through the end of 2021, as he has promised to do in exchange for the 10% pay cuts. By then, management hopes that travel demand will have recovered enough to be able to keep all workers on the payroll and restore their pay to 100% of what it currently is.\n\nThis past summer Southwest trimmed about 4,200 jobs from its payroll by offering relatively modest financial incentives to entice some workers to retire early or quit. Kelly himself also is working without pay through the end of this year (though he still is eligible for compensation in the form of Southwest stock). Southwest’s senior management team also have all had their pay cut by 20%.\n\nOne thing could save Southwest from needing either the 10% pay concessions it seeks, or the threatened layoffs.\n\nEarlier this fall Kelly told workers that if the federal government comes through with a second round of financial support for the industry like the $50 billion package Congress authorized in March in order to keep airlines from laying off workers, the airline would continue to carry more workers than it needs through at least the end of 2021.\n\nBitter political wrangling both in Congress and between House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi and the Trump White House kept such a measure from being passed prior to last week’s election. And it’s far from clear now how such a bill could get the necessary votes for approval during a lame duck session of Congress. That could be especially problematic with President Trump, a strong supporter of a second round of airline aid, pursuing various legal challenges to election results that appear to have gone in favor of former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nSo, assuming no further aid is coming from Washington, Southwest now has only two options left: get its unions to agree to management’s request for 10% pay concessions or lay off thousands of workers in January. Currently management is negotiating with all of its unionized work groups – except the materials handlers and inventory clerks – in hopes of getting those temporary pay cuts, or other concessions that could deliver similar cost savings. Still, to no one’s surprise, leaders of most of those groups already have said publicly that they remain very much opposed to pay cuts.\n\nThat means that unless Congress comes through soon with more financial aid for airlines the pressure will continue to ratchet up on Southwest’s employees and, especially on their union leaders as January draws near. And the only thing one can say with certainty about that situation is that that’s not how any of them - or their counterparts in management - want to spend their holidays."
