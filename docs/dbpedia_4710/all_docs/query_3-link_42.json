        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nSouthwest Airlines has been able to overcome various troublesome trials, such as the ten events of \"doughocracy\". In an effort to maintain their high company rankings, Southwest plans to implement an activity that involves cutting employee benefits. However, this decision may lead to a decline in morale and the potential for labor strikes. By reducing the quality of their product, Southwest leaves room for other competitors to surpass their level of quality, which is incongruent with their position as an industry leader. This decision goes against their core competencies and only seeks to improve their bottom line. Although other category leaders, like JetBlue, have attempted to compete with Southwest by offering a quality of service that matches the price of fare, they have found it increasingly difficult to compete. Customers are more likely to return to Southwest due to their history of positive experiences. It is hard for customers to switch from an airline that has consistently provided a positive experience. High exit barriers eliminate customers as a significant threat, and by winning long-term customers, Southwest ensures that competitive threats do not affect their current position as an industry leader. Static barriers in the airline industry are mainly represented by large capital requirements and government regulations, both of which are not a problem for Southwest. The erosion of brand identification and differentiation is also a low threat within Southwest's industry. This concept can be directly related to the SWOT analysis, where Southwest's most prevalent strength over any competitor is their reputation as a low-cost airline that does not compromise on quality. This reputation has become deeply ingrained, making it difficult for competitors to displace long-time customers with the simple notion of better quality. Southwest proves their commitment to this reputation through the use of promotions and punishments, which reinforce the company's strategy. However, this approach may not be suitable for JetBlue or any other airline. The customer base that they wish to attract from Southwest may have taken incentives to try a competitor's airline at a lower price and does not have a strong sense of brand loyalty. On the other hand, long-time Southwest customers view incentive price raises from another airline as a threat to losing quality. This specific instance of pricing tactics gives Southwest an absolute advantage, as these other airlines will have to spend extra capital in an attempt to win or retain customers who are looking for a price comparable to that of Southwest. JetBlue's target customer is not the exact target of the promotions made by Southwest.\n\n2. Fleet and Route Network\n\nSWA operates an all Boeing 737 fleet in order to achieve lower costs through simplicity. Having such a simplified fleet also enables the company to train their mechanics and pilots to be best at what they do by specializing in just one aircraft model. Furthermore, an all 737 fleet helps Southwest achieve better inventory management since one type of plane means one type of parts and training, which results in lower overhead for the company. Also, SWA pilots know that they will only have to fly 737s and new hires always know what to expect. Over time, the Boeing 737 has been the best economic choice for Southwest Airlines. The airline has introduced five different models since its purchase 30 years ago, each with newer technology and better fuel. Economists believe that the 737s have saved SWA over $1 billion in maintenance costs since there is no need to retrain maintenance workers and stock up on new parts for different aircraft models. The decision to stick with the same airplane for many years has really helped Southwest Airlines maintain the same company business model over time, which has been successful. During the oil crisis of the early 21st century, Southwest made the right choice not to follow its competitors and change aircraft models with claims that the new models were more fuel efficient. Instead of spending billions of dollars on new planes, they enhanced the fuel efficiency of their current fleet by changing engine design and lighter materials inside the plane. This effort was made between 2002 and 2007 to re-wing and update the interior of all 372 of SWA's 737-700 models, which was successful and saved the company millions of dollars compared to buying newer planes. Today, Southwest has just over 600 of these 737 aircraft but plans to begin retiring the older 737-300 models within the next several years. By sending away the older planes and taking deliveries of new aircraft, Southwest Airlines will be able to keep the average age of its fleet to around 10 years, ensuring its passengers a safe and comfortable ride for many years to come.\n\n2.1. Southwest Airlines\n\nFleet and Route Network Southwest Airlines operates only Boeing 737 aircraft and maintains the largest fleet of 737s in the world. With an average age of nine years, each plane averages five short-haul trips each day. Southwest has widely become known for their \"point-to-point\" service, flying passengers between two destinations with no connecting flights or transfer of planes. This is how Southwest is able to keep the famous quick turnaround times. Southwest Airlines operates more than 3,400 flights a day coast-to-coast to 72 cities and is the largest carrier of domestic passengers in the United States. Southwest has received blanket route authority to the Caribbean and is soon to make its mark. With the airline's code-share partnership with ATA Airlines, Southwest customers who own an ATA Travel Reward or are members of ATA's iMilage program are able to fly to an array of international destinations. This is a great opportunity for Southwest customers to have access to ATA's international market. Southwest most recently completed the acquisition of AirTran Airways, adding more potential international destinations in the future. Southwest has always been known as a domestic carrier, remaining loyal to its home-based operation and suggesting it has no interest in an international market. Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly has suggested that the airline is expected to have a two to four-year process in rebranding AirTran to Southwest.\n\n2.2. JetBlue Airways\n\nFirst established in 1999, JetBlue began its first flight on the 11th of February 2000. They've long been overshadowed by the strength of the other US-based low-cost carriers, but have held their own with a devoted fan base and wait until the CTi TV deal. The CTi TV is LiveTV's second contract to provide satellite TV for JetBlue flights. The first, DirecTV, provided the free service from 2000 to 2008. JetBlue's first route was to Buffalo and Fort Lauderdale, and despite adding more destinations, the airline has maintained a significant number of flights to Florida. This has been one reason that they've had difficulty turning a profit, as Florida is a very competitive market for flights. Other reasons for profitability and economic downturns are discussed further. Their most recent strategic move has been to add flights between Los Angeles and various destinations. This has been enabled by an increase in the number of planes they have that are capable of long-haul flights, and likely an attempt to capture a different dimension of the market. This move was in response to the increasing competition between Southwest and other carriers at LAX.\n\n3. Customer Service and Amenities\n\nThe last area of differentiation that we will look at is customer service and amenities. In the airline industry, many have said that taking care of the customers is the most important variable in building a brand. Having loyal customers that appreciate the level of service received provides the competitive edge that is necessary to survive in a commoditized industry. Amenities that are provided by an airline are becoming increasingly important to customers when it comes time to choose between airlines, especially for frequent fliers. In terms of customer service, Southwest has traditionally been a leader in the industry. This stems from the servant leadership mentality that the company practices. This mentality is very simple. Happy employees make for happy customers. Southwest has been noted as having an employee-centric mentality that focuses on the fact that the employees are number one. They believe that if they treat their employees right, the employees will treat their customers right in turn. This concept is known as the inverted business pyramid. At the top are the employees, and at the bottom rests the customers. This method has proven successful in the airline industry. This is evidenced by Southwest being named the number one airline in customer satisfaction by the Department of Transportation from May 1996 to June 2001. The company is still near the top in terms of overall customer satisfaction. This excellent level of customer service is provided without the luxury of reserved seating and first class as well. This shows that you do not have to spend a lot on frills to make the customers happy. Many have speculated that if Southwest were to institute a system of reserved seating or even first class, they would lose some of their customer service edge. This would change the way in which the employees interact with each other and with the customers. This could, in turn, change the level of customer service that the customer receives. Higher-paying customers may feel that they are entitled to more than they were receiving previously. This all starts a slippery slope for the company, and Southwest is aware of this.\n\n3.1. Southwest Airlines\n\nCustomer Service and Amenities 3.1. Southwest Airlines Southwest Airlines has always been known for its measures taken to satisfy customers. Their claim to \"low fares\" has made them famous with customers. The treatment of customers is reflected in the employees. Employees are always at their best, radiating enthusiasm, and putting customer satisfaction first. On most Southwest flights, you will find the flight attendants serving up some kind of humorous sketch or making light of the typically so serious safety procedures. Passengers will find it not unusual for attendants to crack jokes over the intercom. Employees generally are empowered to make decisions and do what they think is right, with giving the customer the benefit of the doubt. Southwest does not offer the typical services that other airlines offer. They do not have First Class or assigned seating. What they lack in these services, they make up with the promptness of the flights. The idea of assigned seating has proven to slow down the loading and unloading of aircraft. With open seating, customers board the plane much quicker and more efficiently. Also, with no meals served, there are no tray tables on the back of the seats. This is some more added time saved with the cleaning of the aircraft. If Southwest is known for one thing in customer service, it would have to be flexibility. Southwest has a liberal rebooking policy, allowing people to change flights and apply the full value of the original ticket towards a future flight with no added fees. This is virtually unheard of in the airline industry today. They even help to eliminate worries about making that next purchase by allowing cancellation of a reservation with the money being applied to a future flight for up to one year from the original purchase. These flexible initiatives have made customers very satisfied with Southwest.\n\n3.2. JetBlue Airways\n\nIn regard to customer service, JetBlue has excelled among low-cost carriers in the United States. According to air traveler consumer reports, customer satisfaction for JetBlue was second only to Southwest, a major accomplishment for an airline that has only been in operation since 2000. JetBlue differentiated itself by offering TV entertainment at every seat and satellite radio. They also offer a very comfortable seat pitch compared to the industry averages. JetBlue also offers its own terminal at JFK International Airport, further securing a competitive advantage in the battle with other carriers. A significant advantage that Southwest has over JetBlue is that they have a policy of no fees. No fees to change a ticket and no cancellation fees are unprecedented services that offer a lot of flexibility to Southwest customers. While JetBlue does not have the same policies regarding ticket changes, the company has recently reduced fees for heavy bags and increased the weight limit on free checked baggage from 50 to 70 pounds, giving customers additional value. The most significant feature that Southwest offers is its renowned customer service. This is a result of maintaining high employee morale, and other companies should note that it is very difficult to fake friendliness. With its classy relaxed style and caring customer approach, Southwest is a role model for many other companies outside the airline industry. As a young airline, JetBlue has provided resounding evidence that the key to its success is not only to keep customers satisfied but also to create a very comfortable working environment for its own people. This proved true in a JD Power and Associates survey, which rated JetBlue highest among low-cost carriers in customer satisfaction, a remarkable feat after only four years in operation. Although JetBlue has a way to go before it can surpass Southwest and its longstanding reputation for customer satisfaction, JetBlue has set a solid foundation and is showing great promise for the future.\n\n3.3. Comparison of Customer Service\n\nJetBlue stands out for its friendly flight attendants, in-flight entertainment, and complimentary snacks and beverages. Their overall goal is to make their passengers comfortable and the stress of traveling dissipate. Each flight is equipped with DirecTV, and they offer 36 channels of programming. As of now, only the first 3 rows of the airplane have satellite radio. They also provide \"SIRIUS Backseat TV.\" This service enables passengers to watch cartoons and other family-friendly shows. Snacks include the traditional air travel options and Terra Blues potato chips. Beverages include assorted sodas, juices, and complimentary coffee and tea. Customers over the age of 21 flying to/from destinations not in the Caribbean can enjoy a complimentary alcoholic beverage. Southwest flight attendants, known for their special brand of sass and personality, are committed to serving passengers with a smile and sometimes even a song. There have been numerous accounts of flight attendants on SWA flights singing safety instructions, telling jokes over the intercom, and some have even gone as far as doing stand-up! Passengers often find this makes up for the fact that Southwest planes lack the \"comforts\" of most other airlines. Southwest flights lack first-class seating, reserved seats, in-flight meals, and in-flight movies. What they do offer are the lowest prices and a fun-filled environment. Passengers can choose their own seats, and those who are boarding the plane last will often get a chance to sit in an empty \"premium\" seat. This is due to Southwest flight's \"open seating.\" Often times flight attendants will play games with passengers and have even been known to hold trivia contests with the whole plane, offering free drinks to the winners.\n\n4. Financial Performance and Market Position\n\nDuring fiscal 2004, Southwest had a slight increase in earnings for the first time in nine years. Southwest earned a net income of $313 million, an increase of $52 million from 2003. This is newsworthy based on the fact that many U.S. airlines are currently operating at a loss. Southwest's increase in earnings shows that they are financially healthy and capable of remaining lucrative well into the future. According to Southwest's President and CEO Gary Kelly, \"2004 was an excellent year despite fuel costs reaching an all-time high for us. These record results are proof that our low fare model remains solid and Southwest continues to be a winner in a troubled industry.\" Another indicator of a company's performance is its return on invested capital (ROIC). ROIC is an accounting-based performance measure of the return generated by a firm on invested capital. Southwest's 2004 annual ROIC was 11.6 percent, effectively matching 2003's rate. This shows that Southwest is maintaining an adequate rate of return on the funds invested into their company. In 2003, JetBlue was the only major U.S. airline to produce a net profit. Unfortunately for them, fiscal 2004 wasn't as successful. Although JetBlue's revenue increased by 48.5 percent, gross profit decreased from $681.8 million to $660 million. This was primarily due to the fact that JetBlue's operating expenses increased by $616.4 million. The majority of this jump was in JetBlue's aircraft fuel expenses, which tripled from fiscal 2003. This was expected due to the rapid increase in flights, but JetBlue plans to slow growth to just 18 percent. This will help to stabilize fuel expenses and, in turn, increase net income. Even with this drop, JetBlue finished the year with a net income of $47 million and as of December 31, 2004, had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $945 million and short-term investments of $95 million. This is a substantial feat given the major U.S. airlines' inability to produce profit. According to David Neeleman, JetBlue's CEO and Director, \"Despite the extremely challenging fuel price environment, we did produce $47 million in net income and continue to generate strong positive cash flow and earnings. This was an extraordinary achievement.\" This is a strong indicator of JetBlue's financial stability and propitiousness in future endeavors.\n\n4.1. Southwest Airlines\n\nIn 1971, Southwest Airlines started with three planes serving Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. Today, it operates more than 500 Boeing 737 aircraft in 60 cities. It has the lowest cost base in the U.S. airline industry and also consistently offers the lowest and simplest fares. Southwest has the best cumulative consumer satisfaction record in the airline industry. As of year-end 2003, Southwest completed 31 consecutive years of profitability. Southwest is the only company to achieve the Triple Crown for a ranking of first in best stock performance, best market performance, and best people – for 10 years in a row. This is clearly indicative of its work and leadership in the market. An excerpt from The Industry Standard states that \"Southwest has an unpretentious culture: the feel of an upstart that not only works hard and is cost-conscious but also is having fun doing it. Southwest's culture and strategy are a reflection of its CEO, James Parker. Management is fiercely focused on short- and long-term profitability at the department level and has created a clear understanding of how each action on the part of individual employees can impact bottom-line performance. Also, there is a valiant effort to balance pressure with support so as to boost employee productivity and commitment.\" Jim Parker became the CEO of Southwest Airlines in 2001. In the following year, when the rest of the airline industry was flashing warning lights for potential bankruptcies, layoffs, and increased government regulation, Southwest remained bullish in comparison. Officially, it was undecided whether 9/11 was the real turning point in Southwest's market position, which had been trending in a favorable direction previous to 2001. Nevertheless, Southwest used its hedge on fuel derivatives to save $45 million in the market where its competitors lost billions. During the bull market in aviation, Southwest took a countercyclical investment strategy and increased capacity by 13% in 2002. This was achieved by deferring delivery of new aircraft and increasing utilization of existing aircraft. By increasing frequency on certain routes, Southwest also isolated some markets where it had competition and prepared to go head-to-head. Because of Southwest's optimism and market aggressiveness during tough times for the industry, it can be inferred that its relative position is better now than it was in 2001.\n\n4.2. JetBlue Airways\n\nJetBlue is the youngest of the four airlines mentioned, having been established in 1999. This year, JetBlue has been a reasonably good year for JetBlue. The weak economy actually helped JetBlue as they were able to add service from Long Beach and Oakland, and they were able to increase frequency on existing routes. They feel they are now the largest carrier in Boston, and JFK has become a different place for them and their customers. They have just moved from Terminal 6 to Terminal 5 at JFK, and they feel that the new terminal is much better suited for their business model. They have been able to add larger planes to routes that have needed them, increased frequencies at several airports, and streamlined flight times at JFK to help with connections. They feel they have made large steps on the operational side of the business this year and are happy with how the company is progressing. JetBlue had some financial setbacks last year in 2013 and managed to recover quite well. They had to make a forecast plan to reduce expenses and increase revenue by a certain amount. They executed the forecast plan almost perfectly by exceeding the cost reduction targets they had and meeting the revenue numbers they had forecasted. This allowed JetBlue to climb out of a current hole and drag themselves back to achieve adjusted net income of 230 million, exceeding the target on plan. They now have to focus on the year ahead and forecast a plan to increase revenue and reduce costs even more than they did last year. This past success with the plan has given JetBlue confidence they can achieve a similar or better outcome in the future."
