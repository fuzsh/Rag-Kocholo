        "text": "Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI)\n\nSouthwest Airlines® recognizes, respects, and values differences. By fostering a Culture that embraces and utilizes unique skills, talents, and backgrounds, we create competitive advantages in Teamwork and innovation that contribute to our overall success.\n\nThe Vision of DEI at Southwest® is to cultivate a Culture of Belonging where all our People can thrive. Our focus is to fuel ongoing momentum to operationalize DEI in our processes and practices to achieve systemic and sustainable change.\n\nAt Southwest Airlines, our Heart represents our identity. It’s more than the symbol of our brand. It’s who we are. We’re a Company of People. People representing diversity of culture, background, experiences, and viewpoints. Each of our Employees bring their own talents, creativity, and individuality. And together, we make Southwest the incredible Company it is. Our People are the Heart of Southwest Airlines.\n\nInclusion has always been at the Heart of Southwest. Our Company was founded on the principle of putting People first, and we’ve never wavered from that commitment. That means all People. We’re committed to being a place where Employees feel welcomed and encouraged to bring their whole selves to work without fear of hate, racism, discrimination, harassment, intolerance, disrespect, or injustice. We understand that in order for every Employee at Southwest to thrive, we must foster an environment of impartiality, fairness, representation, and balance.\n\nWe're committed to listening to our People—Employees and Customers—and doing our part to drive meaningful change, both inside and outside the Company. We’re also dedicated to working alongside our suppliers and community partners to champion DEI in the communities we serve. Like many other companies, we’re on a journey and we recognize that there is always more we can do to make our work environment even better, even more accepting. We’re committed to enhancing our DEI efforts with a particular focus in the areas of Talent, Culture and Values, Brand and Reputation, and Communication. In order to reach our goals and aspirations, we must allow for vulnerability, engage in courageous conversations, and listen to our Employees, Customers, and Communities.\n\nGrounded in The Southwest Way, it takes every single one of us to build a Culture of Belonging. We must embrace and live out our Values, every day, in every way.\n\nWe each succeed when we bring our best selves to work. We succeed when we embrace civility and treat each other with respect and Hospitality. Southwest succeeds when we stay agile and focused on being excellent in all we do. It takes every single one of us.\n\nOur commitment to DEI is reflected in the practices and Teams that turn that commitment to innovation and positive change, including diversity among Leadership and management; evolving our hiring and development practices; and creating robust community partnerships. In 2020, we set the following goals:\n\nHiring & Development Practices: Evolving hiring and development practices to support broadening our talent pipelines, including posting all new, open Leadership positions (Vice President and below) and requiring diverse Candidate slates for each role.\n\nSenior Leadership Diversity: Measuring progress in increasing diversity in Senior Leadership (as compared to July 2020)\n\nSenior Management Committee Diversity: Doubling the percentage of racial diversity and increasing gender diversity in our Senior Management Committee by 2025 (as compared to July 2020).\n\nCommunity Partners: Engaging a breadth of community partners to leverage relationships in sourcing talent for our candidate pipelines.\n\nJoining us in this effort, the Southwest Airlines Board of Directors committed to increase diverse representation on the Board by 2025 (as compared to 2020).\n\nInitiatives to fulfill our goals are driven by the DEI Department, which also has established a cross-functional Executive Steering Committee, and working Team. Additional information and our latest updates on progress for these goals can be found in the Southwest Airlines One Report.\n\nOur Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are formed through the efforts of Employees organized around a specific dimension of diversity or identity. These groups promote our commitment to Belonging and adhere to our Southwest's Values.\n\nOur ERGs are open to any Employee who supports the group's mission, regardless of whether the Employee shares in the common dimension of diversity or identity.\n\nWe currently have 7 Employee Resource Groups at Southwest Airlines:\n\nAble@SWA: Employees with Disabilities & Allies\n\nB.E.A.T.@SWA (Black Excellence Advancing Together): Black Employees & Allies\n\nCorazón@SWA: Hispanic & Latinx Employees & Allies\n\nMilitary@SWA: Military Employees & Allies\n\nOut @ Proud@SWA; LGBTQ+ Employees & Allies\n\nR.A.P.I.D.@SWA (Resilient Asian & Pacific Islander Descendants): AAPI Employees & Allies\n\nWomen@SWA: Women Employees & Allies"
