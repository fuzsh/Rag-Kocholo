        "text": "DALLAS, May 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Southwest Airlines and the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) 550, which represents the Company's Meteorologists, announce they have reached a tentative agreement on the group's first-ever contract. Terms of the four-year deal include adjusted wage-scale step increases, as well as opportunities for bonuses that are linked to individual and Company performances.\n\n\"Hats-off to TWU 550 for working so hard, and so quickly, to strike a fair balance between the needs of their members and the needs of the Company,\" said Senior Director Labor Relations Gerry Anderson.\n\n\"It is an exciting time for TWU Local 550 as this is our first foray into organizing,\" said TWU 550 President Mike Connor. \"For our Company to embrace our Meteorologists as a collective bargaining unit tied to the Dispatchers opens a new frontier of collaboration in planning our flights safely and efficiently with more concise weather knowledge. Our Meteorologists will be able to proactively and directly interact with the Dispatchers. This will prove to be a major asset to our Customers, our Company, and our operations, especially with our new direction into International service.\"\n\nThe agreement carries an amendable date of June 1, 2019, and is subject to membership ratification.\n\nABOUT SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. In its 44th year of service, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) continues to differentiate itself from other air carriers with exemplary Customer Service delivered by more than 47,000 Employees to more than 100 million Customers annually. Southwest operates more than 3,600 flights a day, serving 94 destinations across the United States and six additional countries. Southwest service to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, begins in June 2015; and subject to government approvals, service to Belize City, Belize, begins in October 2015.\n\nBased on the U.S. Department of Transportation's most recent data, Southwest Airlines is the nation's largest carrier in terms of originating domestic passengers boarded. The Company operates the largest fleet of Boeing aircraft in the world, the majority of which are equipped with satellite-based WiFi providing gate-to-gate connectivity while over the United States. That connectivity enables Customers to use their personal devices to access streaming music provided by Beats Music or to view video on-demand movies and television shows, as well as nearly 20 channels of free, live TV compliments of our valued Partners. Southwest is the only major U.S. airline to offer bags fly free® (first and second checked pieces of luggage, size and weight limits apply) to everyone, and there are no change fees, though fare differences might apply. In 2014, the airline proudly unveiled a bold new look: Heart. The new aircraft livery, airport experience, and logo, showcase the dedication of Southwest Employees to connect Customers with what's important in their lives.\n\nFrom its first flights on June 18, 1971, Southwest Airlines launched an era of unprecedented affordability in air travel described by the U.S. Department of Transportation as \"The Southwest Effect,\" a lowering of fares and increase in passenger traffic whenever the carrier enters new markets. With 42 consecutive years of profitability, Southwest is one of the most honored airlines in the world, known for a triple bottom line approach that contributes to the carrier's performance and productivity, the importance of its People and the communities they serve, and an overall commitment to efficiency and the planet.
