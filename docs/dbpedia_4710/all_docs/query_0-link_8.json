        "text": "This release contains: 1 Related Document\n\nSouthwest Airlines and the Transport Workers Union (TWU) 550, representing the carrier's 250 Flight Dispatchers, announce they have come to terms on a new four-year extension agreement. This agreement extends TWU's current contract that becomes amendable in November. The tentative agreement provides adjusted wage-scale step increases, as well as continued opportunities for bonuses that are tied to individual and Company performances.\n\n\"I am extremely proud of both negotiation teams and their commitment to find an agreement that adequately rewards our hardworking Employees and supports Southwest's long-term success,\" said Matt Hafner, Southwest Airlines Vice President Network Operations Control. \"I applaud all parties for the time and effort they dedicated to this important task.\"\n\nTWU 550 President Mike Connor said, \"I am pleased that the Company, once again, has recognized the contribution our Dispatchers make each day. Having this extension done prior to our amendable date allows for our Dispatchers to remain focused on the task of ensuring Southwest Airlines passengers and aircraft move safely and efficiently. As Dispatchers and Employees of Southwest, we are invested in and enthusiastic about the future of our Company.\"\n\nFAA-licensed Dispatchers are directly responsible for the conduct of safe and efficient flight operations and the dispatch, clearance, and movement of all Company aircraft. Dispatchers are often referred to as the heart of the organization, working around the clock to keep the airline running seamlessly and safely on time.\n\nABOUT SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.\n\nIn its 44th year of service, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) continues to differentiate itself from other air carriers with exemplary Customer Service delivered by more than 47,000 Employees to more than 100 million Customers annually. Southwest operates more than 3,600 flights a day, serving 94 destinations across the United States and six additional countries. Southwest service to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, begins in June 2015; and subject to government approvals, service to Belize City, Belize, begins in October 2015.\n\nBased on the U.S. Department of Transportation's most recent data, Southwest Airlines is the nation's largest carrier in terms of originating domestic passengers boarded. The Company operates the largest fleet of Boeing aircraft in the world, the majority of which are equipped with satellite-based WiFi providing gate-to-gate connectivity while over the United States. That connectivity enables Customers to use their personal devices to access streaming music provided by Beats Music or to view video on-demand movies and television shows, as well as nearly 20 channels of free, live TV compliments of our valued Partners. Southwest is the only major U.S. airline to offer bags fly free® (first and second checked pieces of luggage, size and weight limits apply) to everyone, and there are no change fees, though fare differences might apply. In 2014, the airline proudly unveiled a bold new look: Heart. The new aircraft livery, airport experience, and logo, showcase the dedication of Southwest Employees to connect Customers with what's important in their lives.\n\nFrom its first flights on June 18, 1971, Southwest Airlines launched an era of unprecedented affordability in air travel described by the U.S. Department of Transportation as \"The Southwest Effect,\" a lowering of fares and increase in passenger traffic whenever the carrier enters new markets. With 42 consecutive years of profitability, Southwest is one of the most honored airlines in the world, known for a triple bottom line approach that contributes to the carrier's performance and productivity, the importance of its People and the communities they serve, and an overall commitment to efficiency and the planet.
