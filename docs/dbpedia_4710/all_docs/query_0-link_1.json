        "text": "Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) announced today that it has reached a tentative agreement with its Flight Attendants. Terms of the deal were not released, but the airline said they include wage increases, bonus opportunities, and work-rule adjustments.\n\n\"I applaud the efforts of everyone who worked so hard to craft an agreement that rewards our Flight Attendants for their excellence,\" said Mike Van de Ven, Southwest Airlines Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. \"This tentative agreement not only provides additional money, it also supports Southwest's low-cost structure and positions the Company to be competitive in the years to come.\"\n\nSouthwest Airlines Vice President of Cabin Services Mike Hafner said, \"We have the finest Flight Attendants in the industry. Each day and on every flight, our Flight Attendants bring Southwest's Purpose to life for our Customers—connecting them to what's important in their lives through friendly, reliable, and low-cost air travel.\"\n\nSouthwest Airlines Flight Attendants, represented by Transport Workers Union (TWU) 556, will be presented with the details of the agreement in the coming weeks, and members will have the opportunity to vote on ratification. The current contract became amendable May 31, 2013. If approved, the new agreement will run through May 2019.\n\nABOUT SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.\n\nIn its 45th year of service, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) continues to differentiate itself from other air carriers with exemplary Customer Service delivered by more than 47,000 Employees to more than 100 million Customers annually. Southwest operates more than 3,600 flights a day, serving 95 destinations across the United States and six additional countries. Southwest service to Belize City, Belize, begins October 15, 2015, and Liberia, Costa Rica, on November 1, 2015, both routes are subject to foreign government approval.\n\nBased on the U.S. Department of Transportation's most recent data, Southwest Airlines is the nation's largest carrier in terms of originating domestic passengers boarded. The Company operates the largest fleet of Boeing aircraft in the world, the majority of which are equipped with satellite-based WiFi providing gate-to-gate connectivity while over the United States. That connectivity enables Customers to use their personal devices to access streaming music provided by Beats Music or to view video on-demand movies and television shows, as well as nearly 20 channels of free, live TV compliments of our valued Partners. Southwest is the only major U.S. airline to offer bags fly free® to everyone (first and second checked pieces of luggage, size and weight limits apply, some airlines may allow free checked bags on select routes or for qualified circumstances), and there are no change fees, though fare differences might apply. In 2014, the airline proudly unveiled a bold new look: Heart. The new aircraft livery, airport experience, and logo, showcase the dedication of Southwest Employees to connect Customers with what's important in their lives.\n\nFrom its first flights on June 18, 1971, Southwest Airlines launched an era of unprecedented affordability in air travel described by the U.S. Department of Transportation as \"The Southwest Effect,\" a lowering of fares and increase in passenger traffic whenever the carrier enters new markets. With 42 consecutive years of profitability, Southwest is one of the most honored airlines in the world, known for a triple bottom line approach that contributes to the carrier's performance and productivity, the importance of its People and the communities they serve, and an overall commitment to efficiency and the planet.
