        "text": "Decides to assign seats and offer premium seating options to meet evolving Customer preferences and increase revenue opportunities\n\nIntroduces redeye flights for sale to further optimize the network and increase aircraft utilization\n\nDedicates Southwest Officer Ryan Green to lead new efforts as Executive Vice President Commercial Transformation\n\nDALLAS, July 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- As the next step in a continuing strategic transformation, Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) (the \"Company\") is announcing several new initiatives designed to elevate the Customer experience, improve financial performance, and drive Shareholder value. As part of its ongoing focus on product evolution, the airline is moving forward with plans to assign seats, offer premium seating options, redesign the boarding model, and introduce redeye flying.\n\nSouthwest continually reviews Customer expectations. During its quarterly financial results in April, the airline shared that it was studying product preferences and expectations, including onboard seating. In addition to meeting Customer demand, the new amenities are expected to produce additional revenue and strengthen financial performance. Southwest will provide more details on its comprehensive plan to deliver transformational commercial initiatives, improved operational efficiency and capital allocation discipline during its Investor Day in late September.\n\nAssigned and Premium Seating\n\nAfter listening carefully to Customers and conducting extensive research, Southwest decided it will assign seats and offer premium seating options on all flights. The airline has been known for its unique open seating model for more than 50 years, but preferences have evolved with more Customers taking longer flights where a seat assignment is preferred. Additionally, Southwest conducted robust operational testing that included live and over 8 million simulation-based boarding trials. The airline is confident that these Customer enhancements will meet expectations and not compromise the airline's operational efficiency.\n\nThe research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest Customers, and 86% of potential Customers, prefer an assigned seat. When a Customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change. By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future Customers.\n\nIn addition to assigning seats, Southwest will offer a premium, extended legroom portion of the cabin that research shows many Customers strongly prefer. While specific cabin layout details are still in design, Southwest expects roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom, in line with that offered by industry peers on narrowbody aircraft.\n\nThe decision to update the seating and boarding model is part of Southwest's ongoing modernization efforts. During the past two years, Southwest has enhanced its onboard offerings with improvements such as faster WiFi, in-seat power, and larger overhead bins. Work is well underway on a refreshed cabin design, including new, more comfortable RECARO seats. The addition of assigned and premium seating will give Customers more choice and is expected to further enhance the all-in value Southwest Airlines is known for.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the Company,\" said Bob Jordan, President, CEO, & Vice Chairman of the Board. \"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice—at the right time—for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders. We are excited to incorporate Customer and Employee feedback to design a unique experience that only Southwest can deliver. We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on Customer expectations – and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance.\"\n\nRedeye Flights Now for Sale\n\nSouthwest also announced it is adding 24-hour operation capabilities with the introduction of overnight, redeye flights. Booking on initial routes is available today through Southwest.com, with the first overnight flights landing on Valentine's Day 2025 in five initial nonstop markets: Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. Southwest plans to phase in additional redeye flying in the carrier's coming schedules as part of its multi-year transformation to a 24-hour operation. Redeye flying, coupled with continued reductions in turn-time through new technologies and procedures, is expected to provide incremental revenue and cost savings, enabling Southwest to fund nearly all new capacity over the next three years without incremental aircraft capital deployment.\n\nNew EVP Commercial Transformation\n\nGiven the significance of the changes, Ryan Green, previously Executive Vice President, & Chief Commercial Officer, will take on the new role of Executive Vice President Commercial Transformation, leading development and rollout of these and other commercial initiatives already underway. Green has deep knowledge of Customer trends and currently leads the work on cabin transformation. He previously directed efforts to transform Southwest Airlines' Rapid Rewards® loyalty program and the digital Customer experience. He reports to President, CEO, & Vice Chairman of the Board Bob Jordan in this new role.\n\n\"I'm eager to lead this next step in our transformation to serve our Customers with an even better Southwest. In addition to meeting the evolving needs of Customers and fostering more loyalty, these changes are expected to generate additional revenue as we capitalize on greater demand for Southwest Airlines and offer Customers the ability to purchase premium seating options,\" Green said. \"Together, these strategic initiatives play an integral role in the airline's comprehensive strategy to meet Customer needs and enhance Shareholder value, while maintaining the unique Culture, Hospitality, and flexibility that make Southwest – Southwest.\"\n\nThe Company will share further details about product designs, cabin layout, timing, and incremental financial value at its Investor Day in late September. The move to assigned and premium seating will be significant. In addition to incorporating new technologies and procedures for a seamless transition, the new cabin layout will require approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration. Southwest expects to make bookings available in 2025.\n\nGary Kelly, Executive Chairman of the Board, said, \"The Board fully supports these efforts to usher in a new era for Southwest Airlines, and we have the ultimate confidence in Bob and our Leadership Team to design and deliver an experience that is unique and true to our Southwest Legacy.\"\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
