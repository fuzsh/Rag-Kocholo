Have an account? .\n\nSouthwest Airlines is ditching its signature unassigned seating policy.\n\nSouthwest, the US's largest domestic carrier, celebrates its customer- and employee-focused mission.\n\nThe airline found success using unconventional marketing and operational strategies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouthwest Airlines is the US's largest domestic carrier, serving over 100 destinations across the country.\n\nThe carrier has been in operation since 1971 and just celebrated its 53rd anniversary in June 2024.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the Southwest experience is that the airline does not assign seats, instead, each passenger is provided a boarding group number. Once on board the aircraft, they are allowed to sit in any open seat.\n\nIn September, that's all going to change as the airline rolls out new seating policies that may largely match competitors' paid seat assignments and premium options.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, Southwest announced plans to scrap the unassigned seat policy and also sell premium seating options.\n\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest Customers, and 86% of potential Customers, prefer an assigned seat,\" the airline said in a press announcement.\n\nSource: Southwest is ditching its unassigned seat policy for the first time\n\nThe airline is under pressure to generate additional revenue after activist investor Elliott Investment Management revealed a $1.9 billion stake in June. The group is pushing for changes at the airline to increase profitability and share price.\n\nSource: An activist investor with a new $1.9 billion stake in Southwest is calling for big changes at the airline\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouthwest started as a small carrier based in Texas and only operated intra-state routes between three cities: San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas.\n\nThe airline, which was originally called Air Southwest, was dreamt up by Rollin King and Herb Kelleher on a cocktail napkin in 1966.\n\nKing mapped the network he envisioned, making a triangle between the three key cities. He explained to Kelleher that operating solely in Texas would make the company exempt from the Civil Aeronautics Board's federal regulations, which controlled fares, routes, and schedules.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom 1938 to 1978, the airline industry was federally regulated under the CAB as means to ensure major carriers like United and Pan Am were profitable. Fares were sky-high and only business travelers and deep-pocket leisure customers could afford the luxury of flight. The downside was that a lot of the time, planes flew half-empty.\n\nSource: Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum\n\nBecause Air Southwest was certified under the state's aviation regulator, the Texas Aeronautics Commission, it was not bound to federal rules — a clever loophole King unapologetically copied from California carrier Pacific Southwest Airlines.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe loophole allowed Air Southwest to fly freely in Texas and undercut competitors' fares, offering more customers the option to fly instead of drive in the large state. The business model was game-changing and a threat to legacy airlines.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nIn 1967, three airlines operating under federal rules, Braniff, Trans-Texas Airways, and Continental Airlines, took legal action against Air Southwest, saying it does not have the right to fly in Texas.\n\nSource: Companies History\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit took three years to resolve, and in 1970, the Texas Supreme Court ruled Air Southwest could fly in the state. The three airlines then took the case to the US Supreme Court, which declined to review it.\n\nSource: Companies History\n\nAir Southwest's right to fly in Texas was finalized in December of 1970. The carrier officially changed its name to Southwest Airlines in 1971 and commenced operations on June 18 of the same year.\n\nSource: Companies History\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe carrier launched with two routes from Dallas Love Field to Houston and San Antonio using three new Boeing 737-200 aircraft. Flights between Houston and San Antonio commenced in November 1971.\n\nPart of Southwest's immense success was due to Kelleher's focus on unconventional marketing and unique corporate culture.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelleher used Pacific Southwest Airways' idea of \"Long Legs And Short Nights\" for hostesses, as they were called at the time, keeping with the theme of hiring attractive women to work Southwest flights.\n\nSource: Companies History\n\nThe airline's first flight attendants were described as long-legged dancers and were handpicked by a committee that included the same individual who picked the hostess on Hugh Hefner's Playboy jet.\n\nSource: Companies History\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelleher dressed the flight attendants in a bright orange top, orange hot pants, a white belt around the hips, and white side-laced go-go boots. He also pushed for a laid-back, casual inflight experience and only hired female hostesses who were fun, engaging, and had a sense of humor.\n\nSource: Texas Monthly\n\nSouthwest also provided a winter version of the uniform, which included orange and white striped hot pants, a blazer, a white top, and an ascot.\n\nSource: Texas Monthly\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelleher continued the playboy theme by creating a \"love\" culture at Southwest. The carrier was called the \"love airline,” automatic ticket dispensers were \"love machines,\" inflight snacks were \"love bites,\" and drinks were \"love potions.\"\n\nSource: Texas Monthly\n\nThe airline also crafted its own special inflight cocktails, which were free for passengers. A few were appropriately named Kentucky Matchmaker, the Pucker Potion, and the Lucky Lindsay.\n\nSource: Texas Monthly\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe even went on to create ads centered around humor and attractive women. In the context of the 1970s, using attractive female flight attendants to gain customers was an industry norm.\n\nSource: Texas Monthly\n\nIn 1972, Southwest made a game-changing, innovative marketing move. The company introduced the \"two-tier\" fare system, which established two separate price points aimed at different types of travelers.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fares were the regularly priced \"Executive Class Service\" at $26 one-way and the \"Pleasure Class\" at $13 one-way or $25 roundtrip. \"Pleasure Class\" fares were available after 6:59 p.m. on weekdays and all day Saturday and Sunday.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nThe two-tier structure was a wild success, with Southwest increasing its average passenger load from 17 before the move to 75 after.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1973, the company launched a $13 one-way \"half-fare\" sale on all flights to San Antonio. Southwest's rival, Braniff, responded with its own \"get acquainted sale\" with $13 fares between Dallas and Houston. This was the start of the $13 Fare War.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nSouthwest knew $13 fares on its only profitable route would run it straight into bankruptcy, so King quickly came up with a marketing campaign that would put Southwest on top. \"Nobody's going to shoot Southwest out of the sky for a lousy $13,\" read the bold ad.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouthwest matched Braniff's fare between Dallas and Houston, which was met with praise and respect from customers. As part of the campaign, the airline also offered a free fifth of liquor for passengers who paid the full $26 fare.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nBusiness travelers loved the promotion, and lucky for Southwest, three-fourths of its customers opted to pay full price and pocket the free booze. The airline soon became a fan favorite among many Texas business communities, and Braniff was fuming.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the end of 1973, Southwest finally turned its first profit and would continue to profit for 47 years until the coronavirus pandemic ended the streak. Meanwhile, Braniff lost the battle and the war, ceasing operations in 1982.\n\nSource: Southwest, Braniff International Airways Boutique\n\nSouthwest's early challenges did not end with Braniff. In 1964, the Civil Aeronautics Board demanded the city of Dallas build an airport to serve the entire Dallas/Fort Worth area. In 1968, every air carrier operating out of Love Field agreed to move to DFW when it opened in 1974.\n\nSource: Encyclopedia.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Southwest was not a part of that agreement and filed suit that it would not move from Love Field when the new airport opened. The airline claimed there was no legal reason to end commercial traffic at Love Field and that the company made no written agreement to move its operations.\n\nSource: Encyclopedia.com\n\nThe city and the DFW Airport Board sued Southwest, saying the CAB rule applied to the airline even if it was made before Southwest was officially founded. However, Southwest argued that its intra-state flights fell outside the jurisdiction of the CAB, so it did not have to leave Love Field.\n\nSource: Encyclopedia.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA federal district court agreed with Southwest and ruled that it could operate out of the airport as long as it remained open. When DFW opened in 1974, every airline except Southwest left Love Field.\n\nSource: Encyclopedia.com\n\nSouthwest continued to grow through the 70s, acquiring 10 aircraft and carrying its five-millionth customer by the end of 1977.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy 1976, Southwest Airlines had been profitable for three years and proven that government regulation was not necessary for airlines to be successful. Deregulation was a top priority for Jimmy Carter's administration, and it passed the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, effectively abolishing the Civil Aeronautics Board.\n\nSource: National Review\n\nFinally, Southwest Airlines was free to operate interstate flights and the airline began to thrive. Meanwhile, major carriers like Eastern Airlines, Trans World Airlines, and Pan Am spread themselves too thin as they tried to rapidly expand.\n\nSource: US Centennial of Flight Commission\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike major carriers, Southwest maintained a simple strategy for success after deregulation, like only operating one aircraft type, cleaning the aircraft before landing to allow for a quicker turn, and focusing on humor in marketing.\n\nSource: USA Today\n\nAnd its strategy worked. Southwest was prospering while other airlines like Pan Am and TWA collapsed. However, it was not long before the Wright Amendment put another wrench in the company's plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe law, known as the Wright Amendment, was signed in early 1980 and amended the International Air Transportation Act of 1979. It restricted flying out of Love Field to cities in Texas and the surrounding states of Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and New Mexico. The law was meant to keep Southwest from expanding operations out of Dallas.\n\nSource: The Dallas Morning News\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt only applied to carriers that operated aircraft with more than 56 seats, which Southwest did. So, the airline had to rely on short-haul flights in the five-state area to bolster Love Field operations.\n\nSource: The Dallas Morning News\n\nIn 1997, Kansas, Alabama, and Mississippi were added to the list of reachable states. In 2005, Missouri was also added.\n\nSource: The Dallas Morning News\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, in 2004, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly launched efforts to repeal the Wright Amendment, using the slogans \"Set Love Free\" and \"Wright is Wrong\" in the campaign.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nIn 2006, an agreement was made between Southwest, American Airlines, Dallas, and Forth Worth to phase out the law. They agreed that in eight years, the amendment would be gone, but until then, carriers could fly to any US destination out of Love Field as long as at least one stop was made in any of the nine states under the Wright Amendment.\n\nSource: Southwest, The Dallas Morning News\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn October 13, 2014, at exactly 12:01 a.m., a countdown clock at Southwest's Headquarters in Dallas hit zero, officially ending the Wright Amendment. A few minutes after, the airline's first scheduled flight outside of the nine Wright states took off from Love Field to Denver.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nThe deal also capped the number of gates at Love Field to 20, and the airport still only has 20 to this day.\n\nSource: The Dallas Morning News\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the Wright Amendment restricted expansion out of Love Field, Southwest was still able to bolster its network out of other Texas cities in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the airline expanded north into cities like Tulsa, Oklahoma City, and Kansas City, and west to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, and California. The airline moved east in the late 1980s with flights to Nashville and into the Midwest with flights to Chicago Midway and Detroit.\n\nSource: Southwest\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 1990s, the network expanded further east to cities like Baltimore, Cleveland, Columbus, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Providence, Islip, and Raleigh-Durham.
