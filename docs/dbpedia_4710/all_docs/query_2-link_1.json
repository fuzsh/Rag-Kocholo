        "text": "Culture and Employee Experience\n\nSouthwest® is known for its Hospitality and legendary Culture, where People come first. We care for our People and communities, and our People care for each other.\n\nOur Culture is a source of pride and is at the Heart of who we are. We encourage and value Employees’ unique perspectives, skills, and experiences. Each Employee is responsible for nurturing our Culture of caring, regardless of tenure or position. Our People are encouraged to be themselves and bring their unique perspectives, skills, and experiences to work with them in their day-to-day jobs. Employees are treated with the same concern, respect, and caring attitude within our organization that they are expected to share externally with every Southwest Customer.\n\nThis philosophy is part of our DNA and reflects the life and Leadership of Colleen Barrett, the original architect of Southwest’s Culture. To learn more about the foundational expectation to put People first and take care of one another, along with resources for building a strong organizational Culture, visit the Colleen C. Barrett Institute for Cultural Excellence & Customer Service.\n\nCareers with Heart\n\nSouthwest empowers Employees to create their own careers that fit the goals—and lifestyle—they want. We’re committed to quality training and development that drives progress and change, better retention, and sets Employees up for success. Attracting prospective Candidates to Southwest and retaining our current People is at the forefront of everything we do. We strive to offer Candidates the best hiring experience we can, and part of that focus is transparency and Hospitality at every step. We’re recognized often as a great place to work and a great employer for women, veterans, diversity, and recent college graduates."
