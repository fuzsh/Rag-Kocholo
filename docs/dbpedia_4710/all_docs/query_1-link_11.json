(We’re Cohearts, after all!)\n\nOur unique Southwest® Culture is woven into all aspects of our business, from how we treat each other to how we provide Next-Level Hospitality to our Customers. All Employees are responsible for preserving and invigorating our Culture, regardless of position or tenure, which strengthens our Culture of caring. It’s a source of pride among Employees and at the Heart of who we are.\n\n\"Every day that I drive to work, I can't believe that I work here because it doesn't feel like work. It feels like you're contributing to a bigger cause.\"\n\nCelebrating is something we’re known for—we love celebrating together in the good times and supporting each other during difficult times. We make it a priority to celebrate special milestones throughout Employees’ Southwest careers. Employees also enjoy annual Companywide celebrations such as Spirit Parties, Chili Cookoffs, and the Southwest Rallies. In addition to the Companywide events, Employees enjoy participating in celebrations hosted locally with their Teams.\n\nWe’re a Company of People, focused on serving People—including Employees, Customers, and communities. People are, and always have been, the heartbeat of Southwest Airlines, and we work to advance and protect the things that are important in their lives including celebrating diversity, equity, and inclusion and supporting our communities through our outreach efforts. Our focus on People includes giving the same concern, respect, and care to each one of our People, whoever they are.\n\nWe take pride in being the airline with Heart, which includes respecting our Planet. We’ve set a goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and we've released a 10-year environmental sustainability plan to make progress this decade. See all the ways we show Heart for the Planet, from operational efficiencies and policies to community support."
