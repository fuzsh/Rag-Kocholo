By fostering a Culture that cares for and embraces diversity, we recognize that every experience, perspective, and background makes an incredible impact on our Company. We encourage bringing your authentic self to work and celebrating what makes you unique! We're committed to integrating neurodivergent friendly practices into all stages of our hiring process, starting the day you find out about your dream career and continuing until your retirement, and beyond. After all, we wouldn’t be Southwest without our People, who are the Heart of it all.\n\nWe created our diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) commitment because we're listening and taking meaningful action toward building allyship together. We know change is a journey that requires intentional action, honest dialogue, and open hearts and minds. Over time, data can begin to tell the story of how we are changing—it'll be a story that we'll write together."
