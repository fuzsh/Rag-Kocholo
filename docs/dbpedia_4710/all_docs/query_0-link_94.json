The document describes a communication audit conducted of Southwest Airlines. A survey of 20 employees was administered to evaluate how well information flows within the organization. While employees felt positively about sending information and open channels of communication, many were dissatisfied or neutral about receiving information in a timely manner and from the proper sources. The top challenges identified were receiving information, timeliness of information, and information sources. Recommendations include disseminating information more widely and with suspense dates to ensure timeliness, as well as encouraging open communication with supervisors.",
