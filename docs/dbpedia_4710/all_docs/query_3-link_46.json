        "text": "Topline\n\nSouthwest Airlines said Thursday it will cut 2,000 jobs and cease operations at four airports, partly to address “significant challenges” caused by delays in Boeing aircraft deliveries, as the world’s largest operator of 737 Max airplanes seeks to stem steep first-quarter losses.\n\nKey Facts\n\nBig Number\n\n57%. That’s the dropoff in Max 8 aircraft deliveries Southwest Airlines expects in 2024, down from 46 Boeing jets previously in plan some weeks ago to just 20. Southwest plans to offset the shortfall by retiring only 35 aircraft this year to support its fleet against the previous expectation of 49 aircraft. The reduction will put the number of aircraft in Southwest fleet at roughly 802 by the end of this year—all of which are variants of the Boeing 737.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nSouthwest shares were down 9% to $26.70 on Thursday following the first-quarter loss, cost-cutting measures and decisions to cease service at four airports.\n\nKey Background"
