        "text": "Lindy Grant’s long awaited and magisterial (although here one particularly laments the lack of a genderappropriate adjective) book offers us a biography of Blanche of Castile, the Iberian princess famously chosen by her grandmother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, to marry the son of Philip II of France, Lord Louis, the future Louis VIII. Despite widespread acknowledgement of the importance of Blanche on many fronts, especially as dowager queen and regent for her son, Louis IX, Grant’s is the first substantive study of her since Elie Berger’s 1895 Histoire de Blanche de Castille, Reine de France. Grant’s book is very much a biography, in the best traditional sense, untroubled by considerations of, for example, postcolonial criticism. As such it invites comparison with the sprawling biography by Jacques Le Goff of Blanche’s son, the 1996 Saint-Louis. But here key differences emerge as well, for as William Chester Jordan has recently noted, Le Goff, hyper-prolific in the article format, was les...\n\nIn her now classic 1968 essay, “A Study of Medieval Queenship: Capetian France, 987–1237,” Marion Facinger traced the dwindling presence of the queen of France in official documents after an apogee of power for Capetian royal wives, beginning with the reign of Adelaide of Maurienne (r. 1115–37). Facinger concluded that over time, French queens became private individuals, distanced from the king’s official curia. Queenly influence on government was possible only through a queen’s personal relations with her husband, which themselves were contained by his visits to her household, or an occasional invitation by the king to his wife or mother to offer advice, lend her support or, perhaps, serve as regent in his absence. Dowager queens were lords only in their personal domains and even there, they did not enjoy the military privileges usually pertaining to such authority. They spent their retirements in good works, occasionally receiving summons to court to offer an opinion or lend glamor to a state occasion.1\n\nIn my studies of the Third Crusade there has been the occasional but recurring mention of an English princess, whose name is given variously as Giovanna della Inglese, Jehanne, or Joanna Plantagenet. Although her life became inextricably bound with the significant people and events of her era, she remains a shadowy figure who seems to pass through the chronicles without much further notice. As this conference presented the opportunity to speak of women in the medieval world, particularly the Norman world, I decided to set aside my usual books on war and take up the campaign to give light and life to this little-known Queen of Sicily."
