Or maybe her relentless will would have been enough, no idea. I guess she would have been more supportive of her daughter, what Juana inherited Castile from Isabel, not from Ferdinand. She would have faced a harder challenge to take possesion of the aragonese crown due the aforementioned questions about women there....\n\nFound this info on the relationships between Juana & Isabel as well as about Isabel & Philipp\n\nIn the period 1497-1500, Juana's elder siblings, Juan and Isabel, and Isabel's baby son, all died, leaving Juana as heiress of Spain, Mexico, Peru and the Caribbean islands. Therefor, Juana and Philip were requested to visit Spain. After the birth of another daughter in 1501, they finally set out, leaving their children behind in Flanders. They met the French King in Blois, and didn't arrive in Spain until early 1502. In Burgos they watched a bull fight. On arrival in Toledo, Juana threw herself in her father's arms, and hugged and kissed him. Queen Isabella I (to the right) , however, was too devout and too self-disciplined to feel much sympathy for either her overwrought daughter or her pleasure-loving son-in-law. Due to her mother's chilly treatment, Juana's nervousness increased. Cheerful Philip found the grim court life in Spain both tedious and trying. The sequence of religious services seemed endless, and the summer heat blazed like a furnace. To his abhorrence, the Spaniards either kept their women hidden or used formidable chaperones. Philip got the measles, too. Once he was recovered he wanted to leave as soon as possible, but Juana was pregnant again. After a violent quarrel in December 1502, Philip left Juana behind. When she learned of it, she went berserk. Juana wanted to ride after him immediately, but her mother had her locked up in castle La Mota (below). Juana lapsed into brooding silences, knowing that Philip, back in Flanders, would surround himself with buxom beauties.\n\nThe Spanish Sovereigns hoped that Juana's wild moods and lamentations were due to her pregnancy, but after little Ferdinand's birth in March 1503, Juana grew more frenzied than ever. She yelled at the servants and cursed the clerics. She wanted to return to her husband as soon as possible, but she couldn't leave, because hostilities had broken out between Spain and France. Queen Isabella I, fearing Philip's influence, insisted that Juana remained in Spain for a time in order to prepare for Queenship. On a cold November night Juana fled, half-clad, from the castle. When the city gate closed before her, she threw herself against the iron bars, while screaming and hurling abuses until exhaustion overtook her. She fought off all efforts to protect her against the bitter wind. She even threatened the bishop with death and torture for keeping her locked up. When her mother arrived, Juana insulted her with foul language.\n\nJuana wasn't, it seems, really mad. As seen in that Kellan Sullivan has kindly provided, she was more overly emotional and jealous rather than insane. Wanting your husband to stop cheating and to leave your mother's grip is not an emotion anyone can say is crazy. She also was never really called any form of \"mad\" in communications until it was convenient for her husband and later father, then her son. In this situation, we might actually see a much more liberated Juana, if just because her mother will try and have her be a worthy successor. That probably won't go the way Isabella wants, bear in mind that Juana is still somewhat rash and prone to tantrums (not signs of madness, but of an overindulgent upbringing), but it will actively increase Juana as a political figure in her own right and actually might lead to her remarrying if she so chooses to, as being in a more independent and significant position after her husband's death (if not butterflied) and thus not so fixed on her obsession with him.\n\nTo our eyes, she wasn't mad. To her husband and father she was. It was a way to get rid of her. They used the familiar background and the madness of her grandmother.\n\nThe question is. Would Isabel allow his son-in-law to do so?\n\nNope. Isabella might not have been thrilled that her least malleable daughter ended up her heir, but she certainly liked her more than said daughter's arrogant and narcissistic husband. The Queen of Castille wasn't a woman to suffer a man like that without good reason, and if her daughter outranks him, which she will as Queen of Aragon, then Isabella is not going to let him try and weasel his way to Regent for a man Juana. Isabella herself went through melancholy periods, so she'd most likely use herself as an example of how it won't be a problem.\n\nIn what basis are we assuming Isabel was the dominant party of the couple? Were a talking about a society where gender equality was not exactly a main issue. As it stands, Ferdinand was the commander of the pro-Isabel armies during the castilian civil war. He played a great role designing the marriage-alliances system that created fhe Habsburg inheritance, not by chance Machiaveli's \"The Prince\" had Ferdinand in mind. After Isabel died Ferdinand played the temporally the role of.Regent of Castile, and was a heavy weight in castilian politics until his death.

She would have faced a harder challenge to take possesion of the aragonese crown due the aforementioned questions about women there....\n\nYes, the Castillians and Aragonese were male-dominated. However; it should be noted that in 1469, the 18-year-old Isabel was able to negotiate a VERY favorable marriage treaty with John II of Aragon in which not only were she and John II's only son Ferdinand to be each considered the SOLE monarch of their respective inherited nations but that Ferdinand himself was to live in Castille with her NOT the usual deal of a princess having to move to her pre-arranged husband's domain. Not only that but they were to each maintain personal control of whatever territory each state individually conquered (which would impact two continents for well over a century after their deaths with Castille alone being the ruler of the New World with only Castillians legally able to venture there ). And keep in mind that she did these negotiations in secret while her half-brother Henry IV (the King of Castille) was trying to marry her off to his Portuguese brother-in-law and up to the very moment the marriage happened and was consummated, there was a real risk of capture, imprisonment to both her and her bridegroom who had had to sneak into Castille disguised as a shepherd. Even after her death and he was the de facto ruler of Castille via exploiting their detained daughter and minor grandson's sovereignty, the Castillian Cortes still termed him 'the Catalan'. Yes, he had quite a few mistresses and known nonmarital offspring (and Isabel, having seen for herself what befell hedonistic women at her half-brother's court, was shrewd enough to not have a whisper of scandal before or after her marriage) but that doesn't mean that Ferdinand had any real ruling power while living in his wife's kingdom (and it was a bit tricky for him to rule Aragon long-distance only visiting his actual kingdom a few times before his 1st wife's death).\n\nIn this scenario, I can't see Juana being an effective ruler of Aragon (and/or Castile upon Isabella's death). In OTL, if Juana were as practical as her mother, she would have tolerated Philip's infidelities and ruled Castile as queen regent with strictly delegated powers given to her husband. In TTL, Juana would likely allow Philip to rule Aragon ( and eventually Castile) with very little restrictions from her. Isabella would be put in a position of trying to prepare Castile for the rule of a couple who clearly not suited for to be effective rulers. In a twisted sort of way, OTL's Charles V (and his numerous realms) was fortunate to have not been raised by his parents. In TTL, Charles might still be formidable enough a ruler to clean up his parents' mess in Spain. Philip would likely make Charles the regent of the Netherlands in TTL. In TTL, Philip's difficulties in Spain would likely affect his ability to deal with what would be inevitable conflicts with France."
