        "text": "Notes for Ferdinand II of Aragon\n\nFerdinand II (Aragonese: Ferrando; Catalan: Ferran; Basque: Errando; Spanish: Fernando; 10 March 1452 â 23 January 1516) was King of Aragon from 1479 until his death in 1516. As the husband of Queen Isabella I of Castile, he was also King of Castile from 1475 to 1504 (as Ferdinand V). He reigned jointly with Isabella over a dynastically unifiedSpain; together they are known as the Catholic Monarchs. Ferdinand is considered the de facto first king of Spain, and was described as such during his reign, even though, legally, Castile and Aragon remained two separate kingdoms until they were formally united by the Nueva Planta decrees issued between 1707 and 1716.\n\nThe Crown of Aragon that Ferdinand inherited in 1479 included the kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia, and Sicily, as well as the Principality of Catalonia. His marriage to Isabella is regarded as the \"cornerstone in the foundation of the Spanish monarchy\". They played a major role in the European colonization of the Americas, sponsoring the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492. That year the couple defeated Granada, the last Muslim state in Western Europe, thus completing the centuries-long Reconquista.\n\nFollowing Isabella's death in 1504, the couple's daughter Joanna became queen of the Crown of Castile. That year, after a war with France, Ferdinand conquered the Kingdom of Naples. In 1507 he became regent of Castile on behalf of Joanna, who was alleged to be mentally unstable. In 1506, as part of a treaty with France, Ferdinand married Germaine of Foix, with whom he had no surviving children. In 1512 he conquered the Kingdom of Navarre, ruling all the territories comprising modern-day Spain until his death in 1516. He was nominally succeeded by his daughter Joanna, but power was soon assumed by her son Charles I (later Holy Roman Emperor Charles V).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon\n\nWith his wife Isabella I the Catholic (whom he married 19 October 1469), King Ferdinand had seven children:\n\n1 Isabella (1470â1498), Princess of Asturias (1497â1498). She married first Afonso, Prince of Portugal, then after his death married his uncle Prince Manuel, the future King Emanuel I of Portugal. She died in childbirth delivering her son Miguel da Paz, Crown Prince of both Portugal and Spain who, in turn, died in infancy.\n\n2 A son miscarried on 31 May 1475 in Cebreros3 John (1478â1497), Prince of Asturias (1478â1497). He married Margaret of Habsburg (daughter of Emperor Maximilian I). He died of tuberculosis and his posthumous child with Margaret was stillborn.\n\n4 Joanna I (1479â1555), Princess of Asturias (1500â1504), Queen of Castile (1504â1555), Queen of Aragon (1516â1555). She married Philip I (Philip the handsome) (son of Emperor Maximilian I); and was the mother of King Charles I of Spain (also known as Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor). Ferdinand made her out to be mentally unstable and she was incarcerated by him, and then by her son, in Tordesillas for over 50 years. Her grandson, Philip II of Spain, was crowned in 1556.\n\n5 Maria (1482â1517). She married King Emanuel I of Portugal, the widower of her elder sister Isabella, and was the mother of King John III of Portugal and of the Cardinal-King, Henry I of Portugal.\n\n6 A stillborn daughter, twin of Maria. Born 1 July 1482 at dawn.\n\n7 Catalina (1485â1536), later known as Catherine of Aragon, queen of England. She married first Arthur, Prince of Wales, son of and heir to King Henry VII of England and, after Prince Arthur's death, she married his brother Henry, Duke of York, who also became Prince of Wales and then King Henry VIII. She thus became Queen of England and was the mother of Queen Mary I.\n\nWith his second wife, Germaine of Foix, niece of Louis XII of France (whom he married on 19 October 1505 in Blois, Kingdom of France), King Ferdinand had one son:\n\nâ¢ John, Prince of Girona, who died hours after being born on 3 May 1509.\n\nHe also left several illegitimate children, two of them were born before his marriage to Isabella:\n\nWith Aldonza Ruiz de Iborre y Alemany, a Catalan noblewoman of Cervera, he had:\n\nâ¢ Alonso de AragÃ³n (1469â1520). Archbishop of Zaragoza and Viceroy of Aragon.\n\nWith Joana Nicolaua:\n\nâ¢ Juana de AragÃ³n (1469 â bef. 1522). She married Bernardino FernÃ¡ndez de Velasco, 1st Duke of FrÃ­as.\n\nWith Toda de Larrea:\n\nâ¢ MarÃ­a Esperanza de AragÃ³n (? â 1543). Abbess of Santa MarÃ­a la Real de Las Huelgas.\n\nWith Beatriz Pereira:\n\nâ¢ (? â 1550). Nun at Madrigal de las Altas Torres."
