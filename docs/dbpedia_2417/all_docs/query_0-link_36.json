        "text": "Napoleon commissioned the first practical submarine, designed by the American inventor Robert Fulton. Testing of this craft, the Nautilus, was successfully carried out in France in 1800–1801, when Fulton and three mechanics descended to a depth of 25 feet.\n\nThis bound manuscript provides explanatory text for Fulton’s illustrations of the construction and propulsion of the submarine.\n\nIn 1807 the famous Clermont, Fulton’s first commercially viable steamship, sailed from New York to Albany, and proved to a nation of farmers and craftsmen that the U.S. could compete technologically with Europe.\n\nModern data processing began with the inventions of American engineer, Herman Hollerith. In 1881 Hollerith began designing a machine to tabulate census data more efficiently than by traditional hand methods. The U.S. Census Bureau had taken eight years to complete the 1880 census, and it was feared that the 1890 census would take even longer.\n\nHollerith’s great breakthrough was his use of electricity to read, count, and sort punched cards whose holes represented data gathered by the census-takers. His machines were used for the 1890 census and accomplished in one year what would have taken nearly ten years of hand tabulating. Hollerith’s company later developed into the International Business Machines Corporation, known as IBM.\n\nThough now he is renowned as an experimentalist, Benjamin Franklin’s formulation of a general theory of electrical “action” won him an international reputation in pure science in his own day. Writing to Dutch physician and scientist Jan Ingenhousz, Franklin responds to a number of his friend’s questions about electricity and the Leyden jar, an early form of electrical condenser.\n\nIn a document that is more a draft scientific report than a letter, it appears that Franklin wrote his answers first using dark ink, leaving room (but clearly not enough) for the questions, which he wrote in red ink.\n\nTens of thousands of technical drawings such as this one were necessary to create the great water and transportation systems that were both a part of and spurred the rapid growth of nineteenth- century America. The old Croton aqueduct, completed in 1842 under the direction of civil engineer John Jervis, provided New York City with its first dependable source of drinking water. Without the aqueduct, the city could never have grown as it did. The aqueduct ran a thirty-two mile downhill course from the Croton Reservoir in Westchester County to High Bridge, across the Harlem River, and from there to a great receiving reservoir on the current site of the New York Public Library at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue and a great public fountain in front of City Hall, between lower Broadway and Park Row.\n\nOn February 20, 1864, Mahlon Loomis wrote in his journal: “I have been for years trying to study out a process by which telegraphic communications may be made across the ocean without any wires, and also from point to point on the earth, dispensing with wires.” Two and a half years later, Loomis would do this very thing between two mountaintops in Loudoun County, Virginia.\n\nIn October 1866 Mahlon Loomis (1826–1886), an American dentist and amateur inventor, successfully demonstrated what he called “wireless telegraphy.” Loomis was able to make a meter connected to one kite cause another one to move, marking the first known instance of wireless aerial communication. He accomplished this eight years before Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of the radio, was born.\n\nShown here are one of Loomis’s early speculative sketches illustrating the possibility of transoceanic wireless communication, his journal and photographs of the inventor, and his telegraph apparatus.\n\nIn 1954, George Gamow made what has been called “perhaps the last example of amateurism in scientific work on a grand scale.” Less than a year after James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the molecular structure of DNA, Gamow, a professional physicist and amateur biologist, proposed the first definite coding scheme for DNA. In this letter to his colleague, Lithuanian-American microbiologist, Martynas Ycas, Gamow discusses this idea in typical Gamow fashion—couching his contribution with wit and flair.\n\nThis Danish reprint of Russian-American physicist George Gamow’s 1954 Nature article illustrates his diamond-shaped holes in the double helix of DNA and the coding scheme for protein synthesis that he proposed in 1953. Although the physicist Gamow had made errors in his sequencing suggestion, Francis Crick later stated that Gamow’s idea was provocative and led him to consider immediately the all-important coding problem.\n\nIn the late 1880s, German immigrant Emile Berliner (1851–1929), working in Washington, D.C., created a new medium for sound recording and playback, the flat disc “Gramophone.” While Thomas Edison’s 1877 phonograph was “a wonderful invention,” in the words of a contemporary Scientific American, in its original tinfoil form it was impractical for common use. Edison soon devoted his energy to development of the incandescent light. But about the same time that Berliner was creating the gramophone, Alexander Graham Bell’s Volta Laboratory and Edison’s laboratory resumed work on development of the phonograph. (The word, “phonograph,” was Edison’s trade name for his device, which played cylinders rather than discs. The cylinder invention patented by Bell’s Volta Laboratory was called the “graphophone.”)\n\nAccording to its donor, Mrs. Isabelle S. Sayers, this Gramophone machine of the mid-1890s was owned by Thomas Edison himself. While Edison probably saw little threat to his phonograph in this crude machine, discs would far outsell cylinders by 1910. Berliner’s January 1895 List of Plates, shown next to the Gramaphone, describes the typical range of music and speech that could be heard on cylinders as well as discs at that time.\n\nThe disc on the Gramophone seen here is the first recording of John Philip Sousa’s “Stars and Stripes Forever,” recorded for Berliner only thirteen days after the premiere of the march. Generous descendants of Berliner’s have entrusted the Library with preservation of more than five hundred published and unpublished Berliner discs along with the inventor’s laboratory notebooks, business and legal papers, and personal scrapbooks.\n\nBerliner’s discs were the first sound recordings that could be mass-produced by creating master recordings from which molds were made. From each mold, hundreds of discs were pressed. Recording masters and Gramophone machines were made in Berliner’s Washington, D.C. laboratory, two blocks from the White House. Fire destroyed that laboratory in 1897. Later, Berliner’s company evolved into the Victor Talking Machine Company.\n\nThe prolific American inventor Lee De Forest (1873–1961) is one of several pioneers of radio development. De Forest experimented with receiving long-distance radio signals and in 1907 patented an electronic device named the audion. Until this time, the radion was considered little more than “wireless telagraphy,” since it sent Morse code (dots and dashes) instead of conveying actual sound. De Forest’s new three-electrode (triode) vacuum tube boosted radio waves as they were received and made possible what was then called “wireless telephony,” which allowed the human voice, music, or any broadcast signal to be heard loud and clear. Shown here are examples of De Forest’s schematic diagrams and notes scribbled hurriedly on hotel stationery around 1915.\n\nJohn McAllister, Jr. was the first patron to be photographed “as a Matter of business” at Robert Cornelius’s studio, the first commercial daguerreian gallery in the country. In his letter reminiscing about the May 6, 1840 sitting, McAllister wrote “I called at the Room...in order to inform Mr. C. that I would be there very early on the next morning. ‘Well,’ said he ‘I have all ready and if you will sit down I will take it now.’ To this I readily agreed.”\n\nThe daguerreotype is a direct-positive process, creating a highly detailed, unique image on a sheet of copper coated with silver. The process was labor intensive and required great care in processing. The plates, manufactured in standard sizes, had first to be cleaned and polished to a mirrored finish. Next, the plate was sensitized with iodine until it took on a yellow-rose appearance. The plate was then transferred to the camera and exposed to light. Later the plate was developed over hot mercury until an image appeared, which was fixed in a salt solution and then toned with gold chloride.\n\nThe awe-inspiring scenery of Niagara Falls has attracted tourists since the early 1800s. Platt Babbitt established the first photographic studio at the falls in 1853 and gained exclusive rights to operate at would later be called “Prospect Point.” Babbitt’s images were taken exclusively from a fixed vantage point with the only variables being the atmospheric conditions and the various visitors who wandered in front of the camera. By the end of the nineteenth century, Niagara Falls had become the most photographed site in the nation. By the mid-1850s, the daguerreotype had largely been replaced by the ambrotype, which photographers like Babbitt found to be a faster and less expensive process.\n\nThomas A. Edison began thinking about the development of motion pictures in 1888 after studying the successful motion-sequence still photographic experiments of Eadweard Muybridge and Ãtienne-Jules Marey. By early 1889, Edison had conceived the ambitious notion that it must be possible to record motion as perceived by the human eye and play it back in real time. His idea was to go beyond his predecessors, who had adapted the existing photographic equipment of the day to record brief sequences of motion, and invent an entirely new technology to do “for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear.”\n\nTo turn his new invention into reality, Edison assigned responsibility for day-to-day development to one of his best assistants, a young Englishman named W. K. L. Dickson. By June of 1891, Dickson produced a series of successful experimental motion pictures that were shown to visiting groups at the Edison laboratory in New Jersey.\n\nOver the next two years Dickson worked to perfect the two basic machines required for successful motion pictures: a device to record moving images, which he and Edison called the Kinetograph; and a machine to view the results, which they called the Kinetoscope. A major problem that slowed Dickson’s work in the beginning was the nonexistence in the commercial marketplace of another essential invention—motion picture film stock. After Eastman Kodak began supplying quantities of reliable film stock in the fall of 1893, the road to commercial development of the movies was opened.\n\nThe Edison Kinetoscopic Record of a Sneeze is one of a series of short films made by Dickson in January 1894 for advertising purposes. The star is Fred Ott, an Edison employee known to his fellow workers in the laboratory for his comic sneezing and other gags. This item was received in the Library of Congress on January 9, 1894, as a copyright deposit from W. K. L. Dickson and is the earliest surviving copyrighted motion picture.\n\nAmerican lithographic companies were quick to secure motion picture accounts, banking on the success of this new medium. These early stock advertisements often depicted audiences watching a projected image in a music hall or vaudeville theater, where in fact the first films were presented beginning on April 23, 1896 in New York City, with the presentation of six short films, two of them hand-tinted.\n\nIncluded in the debut were Robert Paul’s “Rough Sea at Dover” taken in England; a scene from the theatrical production of “A Milk Flag,” a tableau vivant featuring Uncle Sam, John Bull, Venezuela and the Monroe Doctrine; and two dance films.\n\nThe first poster design pictures a generic film scene of a marching army—a popular short subject of the time—and allots space in the top border for film exhibitors like the American Entertainment Company to advertise. The second poster is an advertisement for Edison’s marvel, the Vitascope. Although the Vitascope was invented by C. Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat, Thomas Edison was enlisted to supply the film and to manufacture the projector under his imprimatur.\n\nMary Pickford (1892–1979), born Gladys Marie Smith, was queen of the American screen from 1909 to 1933. Together with D.W. Griffith, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie Chaplin, she established United Artists in 1919, and later, became one of the thirty-six founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Her career encompassed approximately 236 films, including Through the Back Door (1921), which was co-directed by her brother, Jack Pickford. Mary Pickford wrote the script for the film, which is remembered for one of the best comic sequences of her career—a scene in which she plays a Belgian refugee maid who decides to scrub the floor by attaching brushes to her feet.\n\nIn the late 1880s Thomas Edison predicted that he would invent a new technology to record motion and do “for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear.” He set his assistant, Englishman W.K.L. Dickson, to develop separate devices to record moving image (the “Kinetograph”) and play them back (the “Kinetoscope”). When reliable film stock became available in 1893, commercial development of movies took off. Popular stage performers came to the Edison labs to be filmed, including Eugene Sandow, “The Modern Hercules,” whose display of muscles, gymnastics, and flesh was popular with variety show audiences of the day.\n\nOn April 23, 1896, the Vitascope movie projector made its debut at Koster and Bial’s Music Hall in Herald Square, New York City. The vaudeville circuit was a fitting venue because it not only provided a ready audience but also a source for film subjects including Annabelle, the “butterfly dancer” and the theatrical production of “A Milk White Flag.” During the premiere, film was projected onto a screen set within an gilt frame to create literally a “moving picture” for an amazed audience. This is an example of Koster and Bial’s stock poster that was designed to be overprinted with information about a specific attraction.\n\nOn April 23, 1896, the Vitascope movie projector made its debut at Koster and Bial’s Music Hall in Herald Square, New York City.\n\nThe vaudeville circuit was a fitting venue for the first public projection of moving image, because it not only provided a ready audience but also a source for film subjects including Annabelle, the “butterfly dancer” and scenes from theatrical productions like the popular A Milk White Flag.\n\nCast members were invited to Thomas Edison’s studio in West Orange, New Jersey, to recreate a scene.\n\nThe two posters on display here promoted the 1896 stage production.\n\nWilma Flintstone and Betty Rubble appear about to apply those popular foot-breaks in this animation cel. “Yabba dabba do!” and “Wilma!” became part of the American lexicon thanks to The Flintstones, the animated version of the popular television sitcom The Honeymooners. It rolled onto TV screens on September 30, 1960, and ran for six seasons. Hanna-Barbera Productions had a breakthrough in their popular animated show that resulted in other networks being willing to take a risk to produce cartoons for adults. The Flintstones have remained a mainstay of syndicated American television since 1966, a testimony to the show’s success.\n\nProviding Americans with unprecedented mobility to visit family and friends or tour the countryside, automobiles wholly transformed leisure. These vehicles quickly became symbols of modernity, especially in the graphic arts.\n\nEdward Penfield was an artist famous for the posters he designed for magazines, including Harper’s and Collier’s, and later as a successful commercial illustrator. Penfield, like his contemporary, French artist Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, brought the bold outlines and simple compositions found in Japanese art to his graphic design.\n\nThese drawings are from the Cabinet of American Illustration, a collection of 4,000 original works by the nation’s best illustrators. The last drawing is from the Library’s extensive poster collection housed in the Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress.\n\nRaymond Loewy, one of the principal inventors of modern industrial design, redefined the look of everything from logos to locomotives. For many years Loewy served as the principal designer for the Studebaker Corporation, and in 1961 they called upon him to design a new automobile to save the company. These twelve sketches were sent from Loewy’s Paris office to help in the effort, which resulted in the “Avanti,” a rare instance in which the merits of a product caused it to survive the failure of the company which produced it.\n\nLoewy’s relationship with the Pennsylvania Railroad began in the early 1930s, when he approached railway president Martin W. Clement and voiced his desire to design locomotives. The T-1 design was the last steam engine the Pennsylvania Railroad used before switching to diesel-powered engines.\n\nDrawing on his extensive experience in the design and operation of the automobile, Loewy succinctly sketched the basic elements of this “safety car” design for Cornell University, in order to arrive at a design solution that was both attractive and secure.\n\nIrish-born engineer and surveyor, Christopher Colles produced what is considered the first road map or guide book of the U.S. It uses a format familiar to modern travelers with each plate consisting of two to three strip maps arranged side by side, covering approximately 12 miles. Colles began this work in 1789, but brought the project to an end in 1792 after obtaining relatively few subscriptions. But in that time, he compiled an atlas covering approximately 1,000 miles from Albany to Williamsburg, and is invaluable today for understanding the developing road network in the new nation.\n\n“The love of the great outdoors grows with each new automobile,” states May Southworth in her book, The Motorist’s Luncheon Book. The trouble with the countryside in the early days of the automobile was a lack of eateries. To meet this need, writers such as May Southworth and Linda Hull Larned of One Hundred ‘Picnic’ Suggestions wrote recipe books specifically for the motorist. They included tips on how to heat one’s meal by placing it over the internal combustion engine and how to keep ants away from the picnic site.\n\nOne year after the first railroad to carry general traffic opened in England, American architect and engineer William Strickland published this plan for a steam engine, which could pull twenty -seven wagons loaded with ninety-four tons at four miles per hour on a level grade. The engraving was issued, together with others about gas lighting, road and bridge building, and a range of other technologies to “awaken and animate the citizens of Pennsylvania, to promote and adopt those great and certain sources of national wealth and prosperity.” Railroads would become the primary transportation system for the United States and remain so until the construction of interstate highways in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nBy 1886 the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy had forged an operating system of 4,000 miles of rail track connecting Chicago to the Pacific coast via the Burlington Route. Earnings from passenger service increased, due in part to growing interest in train travel. The CB&Q Passenger Department’s publication program of promotional literature and tourist guidebooks capitalized on contemporary fascination with the Orient. This travel advertisement utilizes traditional Japanese themes to tempt travelers to choose a California excursion as the initial link to the Far East. The reference to the Mikado’s uncle may have been inspired by the popular Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Mikado, which premiered in London in 1885.\n\nIn 1900, Wilbur Wright wrote to his father expressing the hope of “achieving fame and fortune” from his and brother Orville’s experiments in flight. Three years later, the brothers accomplished their first successful flight. As part of their systematic practice of photographing every prototype and test of their various flying machines, the Wrights persuaded an attendant from a nearby lifesaving station to snap Orville in full flight. After making three longer flights that day, the Wrights sent this telegram to their father, instructing him to “inform press.” In his diary, seen here, Orville kept a thorough account of their experiments. This entry details their second successful flight.\n\nOrville and Wilbur Wright (1871–1948) requested a patent application for a “flying machine” nine months before their successful flight in December 1903, which Orville recorded in his diary. The craft soared to an altitude of 10 feet, traveled 120 feet, and landed 12 seconds after takeoff. After making two longer flights that day, the Wrights sent this telegram to their father, instructing him to “inform press.”\n\nEarlier, in 1900, Wilbur Wright wrote to French aviation pioneer Octave Chanute (1832–1910) and expressed the belief that “flight is possible to man...[and] I feel that it will soon cost me an increased amount of money if not my life”.\n\nThe papers of Wilbur (1867–1912) and Orville (1871–1948) Wright were given to the Library in 1949 by the executors of Orville Wright’s estate. Over the years the Library has received additional materials through gifts and transfers, and altogether the collection comprises diaries and notebooks, family papers, general correspondence, subject files, scrapbooks, and over 1,100 photographic images, including 300 original glass plate negatives.\n\nAlfred Easton Poor received his early training in architecture at the University of Pennsylvania under famed architect Paul Cret. This dramatic nighttime rendering is an excellent example of Poor’s skill and is one of a set of presentation drawings submitted by the architect and his partner, William Perry Rodgers, to the 1930 competition for the Wright Brothers National Memorial.\n\nTheir wing-shaped monument, completed in 1932, features a beacon rising sixty feet above the ninety-foot sand dune in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, where the first flight of a power-driven airplane on December 17, 1903, took place.\n\nThis brochure was prepared by the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and contains all the plane’s pertinent drawings and data. The large aircraft had a range nearly three times that of Sikorsky’s earlier clipper plane and handled superlatively on its maiden flight. It was the first plane put into regular service by Pan American Airways in August 1934, and carried 42 passengers in unparalleled luxury.\n\nSikorsky’s majestic “flying boat” was used by Pan American Airways between the world wars on many of its pioneering international routes across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Pan American used this aircraft to make its first Newfoundland to Ireland flight in 1937, and soon after linked America to Asia."
