        "text": "Thomas Walpole, a British merchant, banker, and politician, was born October 6, 1727, the third child and second son of Horatio Walpole of Wolterton (1678-1757) and Mary Magdalen Lombard Walpole (1695-1783). He was educated at Eton, and in 1750 married Elizabeth Vanneck, the eldest daughter of Sir Joshua Vanneck, a wealthy dealer in diamonds and tobacco. The couple had five children before Elizabeth Walpole’s death at age 27 in 1760: Thomas (1753–1755), Thomas (1755-1840), Catherine (1756–1816), Lambert (1757–1798) and Elizabeth (1759-1842).\n\nWalpole was a Member of Parliament for Sudbury (1754–1761), Ashburton (1761-1768), and King’s Lynn (1768-1784), and amassed a fortune while in partnership with his father-in-law between 1750 and 1766; he was also a director of the East India Company from 1753 to 1754. In 1766 he formed a banking firm with Robert Ellison and in 1769 began a partnership with Samuel Wharton and Benjamin Franklin, among others, as the Grand Ohio Company (also known as the Vandalia Company or the Walpole Company) which sought to buy from the Crown a large tract of land in America to open for development.\n\nA cascade of financial reversals began for Walpole in the early 1770s, including instability in the French tobacco monopoly that affected his contracts, the American Revolution which halted his American real estate prospects, and a series of credit and banking collapses that eventually ensnared the Edinburgh banking firm of William Alexander, whose paper was held by Walpole and Ellison. In 1780 Walpole moved to Paris and remained there for nearly ten years negotiating settlements and attempting to regain control of Alexander’s estates in Grenada and Tobago which he had received as security. While there, with the backing of French finance minister Jacques Necker, he also endeavored to perform diplomatic work with the Americans and the French but did not meet with much success.\n\nBy 1782 Walpole was forced to sell his fine art and book collections, and in 1785, his homes at Carshalton in Surrey and in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. In 1787 Walpole married Jeanne Marguerite Bataille de Montval, the Countess de Villegagnon (1730–1821) and was able to return with her to England in October 1789 supported by a small pension offered by the Bank of England. He bought a Tudor-era house (known since as Walpole House) on Chiswick Mall along the Thames River, where he died on March 21, 1803.\n\nA comprehensive biographical profile of Thomas Walpole, written by his great-grandson Henry Spencer Vade-Walpole (1837–1913) and detailing his financial affairs, was published in The Genealogical Magazine, vol. 2, for January 1899 (p. 390-396) and February 1899 (p. 433-435). See also the biographical essays in Series V, Box 8, folders 11–15.\n\nThomas Walpole, a lawyer and diplomat, was the eldest son of Thomas and Elizabeth Vanneck Walpole. He was born on May 23, 1755, educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge. Walpole was appointed by Charles James Fox as the British minister to the Court of Bavaria, where he served from 1783 to 1797. During that time, he was also engaged in helping his father work through his financial entanglements and regularly traveled to Paris and England in his interest.\n\nSoon after the death of his father in 1803, Walpole married Margaret Perceval (1769–1854), a sister of Prime Minister Spencer Perceval and the eighth and youngest daughter of John Perceval, Earl of Egmont, and his second wife Catherine Compton, Baroness Arden. The couple had seven children, Catherine (1804–1876), Thomas (1805–1881), Spencer (1806–1898), Sophia (1807–1900), Robert (1808–1876), John (1810–1892), and Charles (1813–1899), who were raised at Stagbury, near Banstead in Surrey, in a home Walpole had purchased in 1797. He died at Stagbury on November 3, 1840.\n\nLambert Theodore Walpole was born in London on December 28, 1757, to Thomas Walpole and Elizabeth Vanneck, and was named for his maternal great-uncle Lambert Vanneck. On April 11, 1780, he married Margaretta Charlotte Clive (1763–1814), the daughter of Robert Clive, Baron Clive; the couple had two children, Frances Margaretta Walpole (1788–1886) and Charlotte Louisa Walpole (1790–1887).\n\nWalpole was educated at Lochee's Military Academy in Chelsea and entered the army as an ensign in 1775. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1778, lieutenant colonel in 1794, and full colonel on January 1, 1798. Walpole and his troop of foot soldiers died at the Battle of Toberanierin, on June 4, 1798, when they were ambushed by United Irish rebels. Their bodies were buried where they fell, but were subsequently disinterred and reinterred in the graveyard at the second Church of Ireland in Market Square at the center of Gorey, County Wexford, where a memorial tablet for Walpole was placed inside the church. The tablet was moved to the newly built Christ Church in 1861 when the Market Square church was demolished; the bodies remain in the Market Square Graveyard.\n\nSir Spencer Walpole, British historian, was the eldest son of Spencer Horatio Walpole and Isabella Perceval. He was born in London on February 2, 1839. After attending Eton, he began a career in civil service as a clerk in the War Office that culminated in appointments to Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man (1882–1893) and secretary to the Post Office (1893–1899). In 1867 he married Marion Jane Murray (1841–1912), the daughter of Sir John Digby Murray and Frances Bold. The couple had a son, Spencer Digby (1869–1871), and a daughter, Maud Constance (1870–1947), who married Francis Caldwell Holland in 1897.\n\nIn addition to being the family historian, Walpole was the author of several books including two-volume biographies of his grandfather Spencer Perceval (1874) and Lord John Russell (1889), histories of England,and Some Unpublished Letters of Horace Walpole (London, New York, and Bombay: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1902), based on the correspondence in the Thomas Walpole Family Papers. Walpole died at Hartfield Grove, East Sussex, on July 7, 1907."
