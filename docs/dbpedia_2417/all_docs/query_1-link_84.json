        "text": "There are many more newspapers that were published in Alaska and elsewhere than were either indexed or digitized. Microfilmed issues of other newspapers are held in many libraries across the country.\n\nThe Library of Congress has published a comprehensive finding guide to newspapers held in US library collections. It is called the Directory of U.S. Newspapers in American Libraries. According to the Library of Congress:\n\n\"The Directory of U.S. Newspapers in American Libraries is a searchable index of newspapers published in the United States since 1690. This directory can help identify what titles exist for a specific place and time, and how to access them. The Library of Congress does not hold all titles included in this Directory.\"\n\nThe Alaska State Library holds and has produced indexing resources for historical Alaska newspapers. This resource is intended to list these resources, along with other free, publicly available indexes and Alaskan newspaper archives. We're not linking to resources requiring a paid subscription.\n\nIf you don’t see your community listed below, try searching the Alaska Library Catalog with [(community name) newspapers indexes]. Indexes may be available at other libraries for check-out and inter-library loan.\n\nThe printed indexes are available in the Ready/Genealogy section of the Reading Richard Foster Room of the Alaska State Library and/or in the Research Center or in the Historical Collections vault as noted. Click on the title of a print index to see its catalog record as some indexes are available in other libraries in Alaska.\n\nThis finding guide is arranged by community. Digital resources are noted first, then printed indexes are listed below in bold letters and are followed by the newspaper titles indexed within each if not mentioned in the title.\n\nDIGITAL RESOURCES\n\nAlaska Historical Newspapers on Chronicling America (full text keyword search)\n\nThe Alaska State Library participates in the National Digital Newspaper Program, which posts digitized newspapers on Chronicling America. As of June 2023, there were 127 Alaskan newspapers with content on this site.\n\nCurrently digitized newspapers can be searched separately or as a group by keyword or browsed by issue by visiting Chronicling America or by scanning the QR code below with your phone or tablet:\n\nAlaska Newspapers Index (citation only keyword search)\n\nThe Alaska Newspapers Index is a searchable database. It provides citation access to the following newspapers in Juneau, Fairbanks (searchable as a group), Tanana (searchable as a group), and Yukon:\n\nAlaska Citizen - 4/1912-1/1920\n\nChena Herald - 6/1904-9/1905\n\nFairbanks Daily News - 11/1904-5/1975\n\nFairbanks Daily News Miner - 3/23/1909\n\nFairbanks Daily Times - 7/1904-12/1916\n\nFairbanks Weekly News - 9/1903-5/1908\n\nHot Springs Echo - 4/1907-10/1912\n\nJuneau Empire - 12/1990-8/1999\n\nNenana News - 9/1916-5/1972\n\nNorthern Light - 2/1906-9/1907\n\nRampart Miner - 9/1901-8/1902\n\nTanana Daily Miner - 8/12/1906\n\nTanana Daily Star - 7/1910-4/1915\n\nTanana Leader - 7/1909-8/1910\n\nTanana Tribune - 9/1907-9/1909\n\nYukon Press - 11/1905-3/1906\n\nPRINTED INDEXES\n\nALASKA NEWSPAPER INDEX\n\nOctober 1966-December 1972\n\nREADY REFERENCE AI21.A4 1966-1972 (2 blue binders)\n\nHISTORICAL COLLECTIONS READING ROOM AI21.A4 1966-1972 (2 black binders)\n\nANCHORAGE DAILY NEWS\n\nANCHORAGE DAILY TIMES\n\nFAIRBANKS DAILY NEWS-MINER\n\nJUNEAU ALASKA EMPIRE\n\nTUNDRA TIMES (Fairbanks)\n\nJanuary 1973\n\nREADY REFERENCE AI21.A4 1973 v. 1 (red binder)\n\nANCHORAGE DAILY NEWS\n\nANCHORAGE TIMES\n\nFAIRBANKS DAILY NEWS-MINER\n\nSOUTHEAST ALASKA EMPIRE (Juneau)\n\nOctober – December 1973\n\nREADY REFERENCE AI21.A4 1973 v. 2 (red binder)\n\nFAIRBANKS DAILY NEWS-MINER\n\nDAILY SENTINEL (Sitka)\n\nSOUTHEAST ALASKA EMPIRE (Juneau)\n\n1973-1976\n\nREADY REFERENCE AI21.A4 1973-1976 (red binder)\n\nSOUTHEAST ALASKA EMPIRE (Juneau)\n\nFAIRBANKS DAILY NEWS-MINER\n\nDAILY SENTINEL (Sitka)\n\n1982-1983\n\nREADY REFERENCE AI3.A42 (8 fiche-black binder)\n\nFAIRBANKS DAILY NEWS-MINER\n\n1982-1984\n\nREADY REFERENCE AI3.A42\n\nANCHORAGE DAILY NEWS\n\n1983 (incomplete)\n\nREADY REFERENCE AI 3 .A42\n\nJUNEAU EMPIRE\n\nOBITUARIES FROM ALASKA WEEKLY AND ALASKA SPORTSMAN, 1901-1966\n\nHISTORICAL COLLECTIONS VERTICAL FILE F903.O34 VF\n\nALASKA FISHING NEWS\n\nALASKA SPORTSMAN\n\nALASKA WEEKLY\n\nCORDOVA DAILY ALASKAN\n\nCHITINA LEADER\n\nCORDOVA WEEKLY TIMES\n\nDAILY ALASKA DISPATCH\n\nFAIRBANKS DAILY TIMES\n\nFAIRBANKS WEEKLY TIMES\n\nFAIRBANKS SUNDAY TIMES\n\nJUNEAU EMPIRE (AND ITS PREDECESSORS)\n\nKETCHIKAN CHRONICLE\n\nKETCHIKAN WEEKLY MINER\n\nKETCHIKAN DAILY NEWS\n\nMINING JOURNAL\n\nPACIFIC FISHERMAN\n\nWRANGELL SENTINEL\n\nYUKON VALLEY NEWS\n\nSUBJECT GUIDE FOR THE JUNEAU EMPIRE, FAIRBANKS DAILY NEWS-MINER, AND THE ANCHORAGE DAILY NEWS (SELECTIVE ISSUES), January – June 1982\n\nHISTORICAL COLLECTIONS PN4897.A43 S92\n\nA PILOT INDEX OF THE TUNDRA TIMES, Vol.1, No.1 to Vol.1, No.12 (Statewide coverage of Alaska Native issues)\n\nOctober 1, 1962 - March 18, 1963\n\nREADY REFERENCE PN4897.A4 J37 1974\n\nHISTORICAL COLLECTIONS PN4897.A4 J37 1974\n\nTUNDRA TIMES, 1-80 TO 11-82 : [AN INDEX] [MICROFORM], January 1980 – November 1982\n\nHISTORICAL MICROFICHE PN4897.A4 T86\n\nALASKA WEEKLY (SEATTLE), 1923-1948; INDEX BY DATE WITH SUBJECT GUIDE.\n\n1923-1948\n\nREADY REFERENCE PN4897.A4 D42 1979 (black binder)\n\nHISTORICAL COLLECTIONS READING ROOM PN4897.A4 D42 1979\n\nALASKA WEEKLY (Seattle), Oct. 23, 1897-Jan. 27, 1900\n\nALASKA MINER (Juneau), January 1898-January 17, 1900\n\nALASKA MINING RECORD (Juneau), 1927-1928\n\nCORDOVA DAILY TIMES biographies, 1920-Oct. 1925\n\nTHE PATHFINDER (Pioneers of Alaska journal) biographies\n\nALASKA CLIPPINGS FROM THE SEATTLE TIMES [STANTON H.
