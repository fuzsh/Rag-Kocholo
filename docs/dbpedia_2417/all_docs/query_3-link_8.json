        "text": "Alexander Albert Holle was an aero inventor. On one patent he was described as \"a subject of the Queen of the Netherlands\" and \"residing at Bisham Lodge, Speer Road, Thames Ditton, in the county of Surrey, England.\" He was probably the founder of the Varioplane Company of London, England, to which he assigned patents.\n\nHe had many patents -- 48 listed at google patents. (https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Alexander+Albert+Holle). He must have been an engineer.\n\nOne interesting idea was of aerofoils which were rigid at the front edge but flexible and deformable at the rear edge to give the pilot some control over camber as well as angle of incidence. See Patent US-1917-1225711. This book discusses this or a related patent in substance: [1]\n\nFamily tree info is here: https://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stamboom-tolsma/I37811.php. according to that he was born in Indonesia and lived 1872-1955 and married Caroline Phebe Lankester in 1898 in Britain.\n\nDoes this refer to a South African patent or an English one?
