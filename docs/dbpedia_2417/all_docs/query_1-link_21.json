        "text": "A LAUREL CROWNED DEFEAT.\n\nI. \",\n\nPauline Detmar was -a dismal failure.\n\nIf her bewildered llttlte brain had In\n\ndulged a misgiving to the contrary, it\n\nwas ruthlessly dispelled as she followed\n\nMrs. Colonel Raget ancj the Miss Raget\n\nwith her retinue of gallants from the\n\nball room of the Patriarchs.\n\n\"Social successes are born, not made,\"\n\nremarked Mrs. Raget stententiously as\n\nthe family carriage rolled down the\n\navenue.\n\nMiss Raget, the \"superb,\" to quote\n\nthe society column, yawoied acquies\n\ncence.\n\n\"Men are such a stupid lot,\" said tha\n\nbelle of two seasons.\n\nWhen Pauline had been dismissed\n\nR-ith an osculaiory Rood night, mother '\n\nmd daughter sat down in their night\n\nJresses, after the manner of woman\n\nkind, to talk it over.\n\n\"She was by all odds the loveliest ;\n\ntirl,\" said Miss Raget, tossing her pink\n\nMUln slipper to the farthest end of, the I\n\nroom.\n\n\"Unquestionably,\" said the Colonel's,\n\ntvife. \"And manners so refreshingly\n\nartless and winsome—the manners of j\n\nIter mother. Lueretia was s thoroughly i\n\nivell-bred woman.\"\n\n\"And yet?\" said the \"superb.\"\n\n\"Pauline fell flat, hopelessly flat. Off\n\nlike a rocket, down like a stick.\"\n\nMrs. Raget sighed. \"Not a man !\n\nsought her for a second dance after j\n\nmidnight.\"\n\nMrs. Colonel Raget's supremacy in\n\nthe \"smart set\" was invincible. Not\n\nDnly had she successfully launched the\n\ninnumerable daughters of her own\n\nhousehold on the capricious upper crust\n\nof the social wave and piloted each to\n\nsnug harbors in the way of well ap\n\npointed establishments and presentable\n\nfigure heads that served all the pur\n\nposes of husbands, but she was the\n\nadored social sponsor of scores of pret\n\nty women, who owed to her manipu\n\nlations their titles of Madam. While\n\nMrs. Raget's tactics elicited admiration,\n\nthey eluded analysis. This lady was\n\ncredited with being able to determine,\n\ntwenty minutes after a girl crossed a\n\nball room for the first time, whether\n\nshe was destined for success or failure.\n\nSo unerring was her judgment in this\n\npivotal matter, that she Is said to have\n\nsent home on the occasion of her debut\n\nno less a personage than the fourth\n\nMiss Ttaget: and never was the latter\n\npermitted, during her maidenhood, to\n\nmake a second appearance at a Patri\n\narch. Hut for once in her long reign,\n\nMrs. Raget had miscalculated.\n\nThe Louis XIV. pendulum chimed\n\nthree.\n\n\"Well?\" said the \"superb.''\n\nAgain the Colonel's wife sighed.\n\n\"There's no alternative. We must\n\nsend her home.\"\n\nTI.\n\nThe place was a stuffy gable cham\n\nber in a third-rate hotel at a popular\n\nVirginia summer resort. In all the\n\nloveliness of its Parisian artful arlless\n\nness it lay—the gown in which un am\n\nbitious mother bad dreamed that her\n\nbeloved would find the Aladdin's lamp\n\nthat would restore them to the station\n\nthey once held in the gay world. Tt\n\nwas the first time the gown had been\n\ntaken from its box since Pauline's\n\nsummary departure from the Raget\n\nmansion. Mother and daughter gazed\n\nat the airy, illusive creation which Mrs.\n\nRaget's generosity bad provided, but\n\nonly with the detached interest of vis\n\nitors to a museum: it did not appeal to\n\nthem us a personal possession. Nothing\n\ncould be more out of touch with the\n\nlife they had been leading in the shab\n\nby little hostelry in which they were\n\ngrateful to have found shelter for the\n\nsummer months. —trusting, like the\n\nsparrows, to Providence for a winter\n\nnest. But as her eyes rested on the La\n\nFrance roses encircling the low bodice,\n\nthe mother re-lived in fancy the tri\n\numphs of her youth, quenched all too\n\nquickly by widowhood and poverty. A\n\nlast desperate effort to save the cdd\n\nhomestead had emboldened her to\n\nmake her way to the Metro),oils and\n\nseek the advice of a discarded suitor,\n\nColonel Raget, who in the interval had\n\ngrown rich beyond the dream of ava\n\nrice. In her calculations she had over\n\nlooked the Colonel's wife, —for she who\n\nhad attained that enviable dignity was\n\nan obscure, unconsidered factor in the.\n\nbellehood of Lucretia Detmar. Had the\n\nwidow been less guileless, she might\n\nhave divined in Mrs. Colonel Raget's\n\nadmiration of Pauline's beauty, to\n\nwhich her attention had been called by\n\nLIDA ROSE McCABE\n\nthe Colonel, and her offer to launch the\n\ngirl at the Raget expense in the \"smart\n\nset,\" a hint o.\" malicious self satis\n\nfaction, rather than n sincere desire to\n\nbetter their fortunes.\n\nBut unsuspecting Lurretin was grate\n\nful then, and grateful she remained,\n\ndespite Pauline's failure to meet expec\n\ntations and Mrs. Raget's inability to\n\naccount for It.\n\n\"She was beautiful as a dream,\"\n\nwrote the Colonel's wife, \"but times\n\nand standard have changed, my dear\n\nLucretla. There's no counting on the\n\nvagaries of the modern wife-hunter.\"\n\n\"You must have looked lovely, dear\n\nest,\" said the mother, venturing to\n\nshake out the rosy ruffles. \"How I\n\nshould love to have seen you.\"\n\nBut Pauline heard not. For her, the\n\nstuffy room, the sultry August day, the\n\nairy, fairy gown, had vanished. She\n\nwas again at the Patriarch's—not in the\n\nmazea of the dance, but in the gold and\n\nwhite, hushed stillness of the dressing\n\nroom, whither many a debutant, solici\n\ntous to escape being catalogued among\n\nthe wall flowers, had preceded her un\n\nder the nameless pretexts known to\n\nfeminine art. It was in an interval of\n\nthe lancers. Her partner—a pompous\n\ngrey-beard who had sized her up as he\n\nwould a filly at Tattersalls—had left\n\nher to exchange banalities with a\n\nneighboring grand dame. Unconscious\n\nly Pauline turned, she knew nut why,\n\ninto the dressing room, there to en\n\ncounter a phase of life in the \"smart\n\nset\" little known or suspected beyond\n\nits precincts.\n\nIn various attitudes of weariness\n\nweariness of the heart, rather than the\n\nbody—were varied types of maidenhood,\n\ndaintily, richly gowned, not a few be\n\njewelled, the eyes of each \"drinking\n\ntheir tears of mortification\" as they\n\nnervously toyed with unfilled dance\n\ncards, or concealed them in their\n\nbodices. Pauline's \"sweet asking eyes\"\n\npassed from one to the other, to rest\n\n~n the motherly Dinah talking In low\n\ntones to a pal\", weary little woman,\n\nwho wrote rapidly while she questioned\n\nIncessantly. The weary little woman\n\nwas a reporter. It was the toilettes of\n\nthe unhappy girls that the uniting\n\nmaid was describing, with interpola\n\ntions as to their wealth and sceiul pros\n\npects. All were daughters of wealth,\n\nthe off-spring of families of social emi\n\nnence: and yet—Pauline shuddered as\n\nshe turned from their ill-disguised\n\nwretchedness to meet Dinah's sym\n\npathetic smile.\n\nThe reporter had disappeared.\n\n\"I'm so sorry for that little woman,\"\n\nsaid the maid. \"She's worked to\n\ndeath.\"\n\nPauline lifted her delicate eyebrows\n\nquestlonlngly.\n\n\"She's six balls to report tonight. Her\n\nbaby's sick, and she's so nervous she\n\ngets names and costumes mixed. She's\n\ngoina home now—it's midnight, miss\n\nto nurse the baby before she takes in\n\nthe fourth ball. 'Twill be three o'clock\n\nbefore she's abed. T always help her\n\nwhen I can. You see, miss, I knew her\n\nwhen she was the greatest belle In New\n\nYork. Lor' bless you, honey, there's\n\nno beauty on that floor tonight could\n\n' hold a candle to that little woman ln\n\ni her day -before her pa lost his mll-\n\nI lions and her husband broke her heart\n\n. and left her to shift for herself and the\n\nbabes.\"\n\nDazed, bewildered. Pauline went back\n\njto the ball room. How spiritless, how\n\nabsent minded the grey-beard found\n\ni her! And so, the ball rolled on, and\n\nMrs. Raget was piqued to account for\n\nher miscalculation.\n\n111.\n\nRecalling those dejected faces in the\n\ngold and white dressing room, Pauline\n\nwas grateful to Mrs. Raget for sending\n\nher back to her mountain home. Gone\n\nforever was her girlish dream of social\n\nconquest. She had boxed It with the\n\nball gown, and both were quite forgot\n\nten unCII he said, \"I shall never be\n\nquite satisfied, Miss Detmar, until I see\n\nyou In a ball gown.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" said the mother\n\nwhen the girl told her. \"There's the\n\nhop at the fort to which a Detmar 1*\n\nalways welcome. For once In your life,\n\nmy dear # you have not the excuse of\n\nFlora McThinsey.\" and forthwith the\n\nbox was uncovered.\n\nThey were making a little journey\n\nround the world, he told her —he and\n\nhis companion, the grizzly little man\n\nwith the keen eyes and the musical\n\nlaugh. The latter would some day de\n\nscribe what they saw in lucid prose,\n\nwhile he, Gerald Montant, was an ar\n\ntist ln search of types—types of Amer\n\nican beauty. Hers was a face nearer\n\nhis ideal than any he had yet met. Cer\n\ntainly there was nothing at the last\n\nPatriarch's that appealed so strongly to\n\nj his pencil. But Montant checked him\n\nself. The absurdity of speaking of the\n\nPatriarch's—that undiscovered, un\n\ndreamed of country—to this lonely\n\nmountain pink paling under his genial\n\nglance. That his name, known ln two\n\ncontinents, which he himself pro\n\nnounced not without self-consciousness,\n\nmade no visible Impression upon her,\n\nwas a positive delight. It was the fin-\n\n\"Eyes for No One Else.\"\n\nishing stroke of her conquest. Learn\n\ning of their poverty, it came about that\n\nMontant. with consummate tact, pre\n\nvailed upon the mother to permit Pau\n\nline to pose daily for a consideration.\n\nA new world was thus opened to Pau\n\nline, and her sympathetic soul ripened\n\nfast, as her eyes, under Montant's di\n\nrection, began to perceive beauty in na\n\nture's homeliest aspects. In her in\n\nterest in the world beautiful, as his art\n\nrevealed it to her. all sense of her own\n\npersonality was lost, until one day he\n\nexpressed a desire to see her in a ball\n\ngown.\n\nWith sudden consciousness that his\n\ninterest was not altogether impersonal\n\ncame a yearning to nibble again, if only\n\nat the fringe of the polite world. Of\n\ncourse, he would be nt the hop at the\n\nFort.—the cynosure of all eyes, with his\n\nApollo head and his air of medieval\n\nknight errantry. And he was there;\n\nit's related, moreover, that he had eyes\n\ntor none of tho beautiful women who\n\ngraced that auspicious occasion, after\n\nthe model made her debut in the Raget\n\ngown.\n\n\"You would be surprised,\" wrote\n\nMontant about this time to a chum of\n\nthe Latin Quarter, \"to see how desper\n\nately infatuated I am—l, a globe-trot\n\nter of forty odd years seasoning—with\n\nthe liveliest child in all the wide world.\n\nHut when you see my salon picture,\n\n'After the Hall,' perhaps you will un\n\nderstand.\"\n\nThat little journey round the world\n\nended at London, where there was\n\nmuch curiosity in certain circles to see\n\nMontant's American wife. Always a\n\nclever draughtsman, a strong, original\n\nI rolorist. his rise as a fashionable por\n\ntrait painter practically dates from his\n\nI marriage. Settling down at Mayfatr,\n\ni his skill was richly supplemented by\n\nPauline's beauty and sympathy and\n\n1 Lucretla Dctmar'a diplomacy, which\n\n! soon made him known at Marlborough\n\nHouse. From Mayfair to Newport is\n\nrapid transit. To sit to Montant was\n\nthe acme of pood form when Pauline\n\nmade her Becor.ddebut at a Patriarch's!\n\n|As the beaux monde encircled her, vy\n\n. ing for a smile, a word, a dance, Pau\n\nline recalled the revelation that had\n\ncome to her that night In the white and\n\n; gold dressing room.

Tet he Is not one whit more\n\nInteresting than his son, Bolton Hall,\n\nalbeit the latter Is not nearly so well\n\nknown as his eloquent, godly father.\n\nBolton Hall is a lawyer by profession,\n\nand diligent and prosperous therein.\n\nBut he Is far more enthusiastic as a\n\nsingle tax agitator and as an active of\n\nficial in the Longshoremen's Union\n\nthan In the trying of court cases and\n\nthe drawing of legal documents; and\n\nhis office in lower Broadway is recog\n\nnized as one of the centers both by\n\nthose who accept the tenets of the late\n\nHenry George, and those who load and\n\nunload ocean-going ships.\n\nBolton Hall's position with regard to\n\nthe Longshoremen's Union, of which\n\nhe has for some years been treasurer,\n\nis unique In the true meaning of\n\nthe term. Other men of means, or\n\nthose engaged in professional life,\n\nhave essayed to give practical help\n\nto labor organizations ln many In\n\nstances. Hut. so far as I know,\n\nBolton Hall is the only man not orig\n\ninally a wage earner. In this country\n\nat least, who has beer, able to win the\n\nentire confidence of organized body of\n\nworkingmen. This he has secured to\n\nsuch an extent that he has not only\n\nbeen put in complete control of the\n\nLongshoremen's finances, hut is con\n\nsulted with regard to all matters of\n\nvital Importance.\n\nA MAN OF THE PEOPLE.\n\nOf course this state of affairs could\n\n| not have been brought about had not\n\n; Mr. Hall been able enter thoroughly\n\ni into their point of view and sympathize\n\nfully with their aspirations. Most men\n\nlof Mr. Hall's social, professional and\n\n'[ finnnoinl standing find it impossible to\n\n[ see things as the wage earners see\n\n(them, or to understand their hopes and\n\n. fears; and it is not surprising that this\n\nils so. Nor is it to be wondered at that\n\n'■ wnrkingmen perceive the truth at onr-e\n\nwhen one who lacks real know ledge\n\nand sympathy \"stoops\" to assist them.\n\nAt the very beginning of Mr. Hall's ef\n\nforts ln the longshoremen's behalf, they\n\nsaw clearly that he did not feel that he\n\nwas getting down to a lower level than\n\n' his own in seeking to befriend them,\n\nand they were overjoyed to have the\n\nI help of a thoroughly practical man of\n\naffairs In conducting the money de\n\npartment of their organization.\n\nHis object in helping to promulgate\n\nsingle tax notions is based on exactly\n\ni the same impulses as his work In be\n\nhalf of the longshoremen. It would be\n\nimpossible for the most pronounced op\n\nponent of the George theories to listen\n\nfor five minutes to Mr. Hall's argu\n\nments thereon without being convinced\n\nthat he honestly believes their adoption\n\nwould be productive of great good to\n\nthe people. His sincerity is beyond all\n\ni question, and his words have undoubt\n\nedly won the adherence of thousands.\n\n| PREACHING THE SINGLE TAX.\n\nMr. Hall's chief method of spreading\n\nwhat he considers tho true economic\n\ngospel would have met with much op\n\nposition a few yenrs age and is not al\n\nways received with cordiality to-day.\n\nHe was the originator of the scheme\n\nfor the delivery of single tax addresses\n\n|in the churches on Sunday mornings,\n\nand he has himself preached many ser\n\nmons on the land question,—though 1\n\nbelieve he is not an ordained minister.\n\nA large number of Mr. Hall's sermons\n\nhave been delivered In Canada, where\n\nthe newspapers have almost invariably\n\ngiven much space to reporting them,\n\n' But he hns also spoken from many pul\n\npits in the I'nited States, including that\n\nof the King street branch of the Fifth\n\nAvenue Presbyterian church. Of course\n\nihe preached there by the permission ol\n\nhis father, and I understand that this\n\nwas one of the minor points of criticism\n\nraised by those who have not been\n\nwholly satisfied with Dr. Hall of late,\n\nthough the New York newspapers do\n\nnot seem to have heard about It\n\nBolton Hall believes In extending the\n\ncircle of single tax believers by every\n\npossible means, Including even what\n\nmay be termed the \"hurrah boys\"\n\nmethod, and he was a strong factor ln\n\nthe Delaware campaign of a year or\n\ntwo ago, during which there were some\n\narrests of Single Taxers because of the\n\nnoise with which they carried on their\n\nwork. He is confident that the doc\n\ntrine will eventually prevail, though he\n\nadmits that such populous centres as\n\nNew York will probably be much hard\n\ner to bring into line than the less com\n\npact communities of the Weßt and\n\nSouth.\n\nA PARKHURST STORY.\n\nI heard a story the other day about\n\nthe Rev. Dr. Parkhurst, concerning\n\nwhom little h 3 been heard since his\n\nreturn from abroad, but who may soon\n\nagain take his place in publicity's white\n\nlight. This story may or may not have\n\nbeen printed; if It has, It Is old enough\n\nto be new. Briefly told, it runs about\n\nlike this:\n\nThe Lexow Committee's Inquiry was\n\non and Dr. Parhurst, W. Travers Je\n\nrome,—nephew of the late Larry Je\n\nrome and related to Lady Randolph\n\nChurchill—were listening to certain\n\nrevelations, made by George Appo, a\n\nreformed bunco steerer and green goods\n\nman, with regard to various phases of\n\npolice protection. They were ln the of\n\nfice of John W. Goff, now Recorder.\n\n\\Then Appo had told his tale Goff\n\nturned to his desk, Jerome picked up ,\n\na newspaper, and Dr. Parkhurst sat\n\nstill, thinking on what he had lust\n\nheard. The silence was broken by Ap\n\npo.\n\n! \"I beg your pardon. Dr. Parkhurst,\"\n\n! said the bunco man, \"but could you let\n\nIme have two tens for a live? I'm out\n\nlof change.\"\n\n\"Why—why certainly. Mr. Appo,\" re\n\ni plied the minister, after a moment's\n\nhesitation. \"To be pure. Here you are\n\n—two tens for a five.\"\n\nThe little proceeding had attracted\n\nthe attention of Messrs. Goff and Je\n\nrome, but they snid not a word, though\n\ntheir lookii were so peculiar that the\n\ngood doctor smelled the rat in a minute.\n\nMeanwhile Appo had spilled out of the\n\nroom, though not beyond the precincts\n\n:of the outer office. There Dr. Parkhurst\n\nfound the clever rogue.\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Appo,\" the doctor inquired\n\nanxiously, \"didn't I Just give you two\n\ni tens for a five Just now—for a five,\n\nmind?\"\n\n\"Why certainly,\" replied Appo, grin\n\nning and returning the money, \"and\n\nwasn't that what I asked you for?\"\n\nDr. Parkhurst Joined as heartily as\n\n; any one in the laugh that followed.\n\nI Copyright, 1898, by Bacheller Syndicate.\n\n\" Two Tens for a Five.\"\n\nNEW WATER ROUTE TO HUDSON'S BAY\n\nCol. T. C. Scoble Gives Interesting Details\n\nAbout an Enterprise Destined to Have\n\na Marked Effect on Commerce.\n\nThe return of the British man-of-war\n\n\"Diana\" from n cruise In and about\n\nHudson's Bay has caused the final ap\n\nproval of the project of the Manitoba\n\n& Hudson's Bay Navigation Company.\n\nThis project is nothing less than mak\n\ning a commercial waterway from Win\n\nnipeg in Manitoba direct to the At\n\nlantic.\n\nOf all persons who have been Inter\n\nested in bringing this matter to the\n\nposition It now occupies, the efforts of\n\nnone have been more notable than\n\nMap of New Route to Hudson's Bay.\n\nthose of Col. T. C. Scoble. None, there\n\nfore, can describe better than he the\n\nscope and purpose of an enterprise\n\nwhich, It Is believed, is destined to have\n\na marked effect upon the commerce of\n\nthe Dominion of Canada and incident\n\nally of the t'nlted States; and the fol\n\nlowing article, prepared by him, will be\n\nread with no little Interest, being the\n\nfirst absolutely truthful and accurate\n\nstatement regarding the project yet\n\ngiven:\n\n\"The proposition to connect Winnipeg\n\nwith Hudson's Bay by the Improve\n\nment of the existing waterways is\n\nneither novel nor chimerical. The Red\n\nRiver of the north, flowing for 600\n\nmiles, from south of the International\n\nboundary to Its northern outlet on\n\nLake Winnipeg, presents, with the\n\nlake, a navigable stretch of nearly a\n\nthousand miles, broken only by the\n\nrapids on the Red River.--* hiatus of\n\nnot more than ten miles altogether.\n\n\"The Nelson, or Sen River, as the\n\neastern branch Is called.

Thence north-easterly\n\nto Hudson's Bay there exist navigable\n\nstretches of 330 miles, only broken by\n\nsurmountable obstacles embraced In a\n\ntotal distance of less than 50 miles.\n\nThe existing open channels are both\n\nwide and deep, and the banks are uni\n\nformly of sufficient height to admit of\n\nincreasing the depth of water by means\n\nof dams, where this is necessary, in or\n\nder to group the rapids for canals and\n\nlocks to overcome the descent.\n\n\"It is not proposed that a greater\n\ndepth than seven feet of water shall be\n\nat present provided, as that would be\n\nsufficient to float barges of 300 tons\n\ncapacity, such as have recently been\n\nconstructed at Cleveland for use on the\n\nupper lakes and Erie Canal. These\n\nbarges are of whaleback pattern, and\n\nare said to draw five feet six inches of\n\n[ water, loaded.\n\n\"The canal Is strictly a popular high\n\nway upon which all vessels have a right\n\nof way, the loads upon which are regu\n\nlated by government in proportion to\n\ncost and capacity. No combination can\n\ncontrol the cost and transporation over\n\nIts length, which depends upon individ\n\nual vessel owners, and Is regulated al\n\ntogether by the number of vessels com\n\npeting for the traffic. Unlike a railway,\n\ntherefore. It cannot be operated for the\n\nsole benefit of stockholders.\n\n\"Not only Is it in itself an enormous\n\nfactor in transporation, bringing; goods\n\nat the lowest cost of transport, but by\n\nIts very existence it exercises an imme\n\ndiate and dominant Influence upon\n\nrailway charges, which must bear com\n\nparison with its rates. Canals do not\n\nobviate the necessity for railroads,\n\nbut rather the contrary, as has been\n\nproved In numberless Instances both\n\nIn the United States and In Europe.\n\nWhere canals have first existed,\n\nrailways are soon built paralleling\n\ntheir route, competing for the traffic\n\nthat the existence of the canal has\n\ncreated. It may be said, therefore, that\n\ncanals create railways rather than de\n\nstroy their usefulness.\n\n\"For over one hundred years the traf\n\nfic of the Hudson Bay Company be\n\ntween Norway House and Tork Fac\n\ntory was carried on In flat-bottomed\n\nboats capable of carrying a load of\n\nfour or five tons, with a crew of nine\n\nmen. These boats draw from three feet\n\nto three feet, six inches of water when\n\nloaded, and are provided with a mast\n\nand square sails, like lighters, as well\n\nas with oars. When going up a rapid\n\ncurrent, a line Is attached to the boat\n\nwhich is pulled or tracked up by four\n\nmen walking on the shore, while the\n\nremainder of the crew pole the boat.\n\nThese are locally known as Tork boats.\n\n\"After leaving the Sea River about\n\nthree miles below Sea River Falls, on the\n\ndownward Journey by the loaded boats,\n\nwhich are unloaded and tracked up\n\nwhen going against the current, a small\n\nriver emptying from Hare Lake is en\n\ntered and followed for about thirty\n\nmiles in an easterly direction until the\n\nwaterway comes to an abrupt termina\n\ntion at the height of land known local\n\nly as the Painted Stone Portage, twen\n\nty-nine yards in width and with a sum\n\n' mlt of about four feet midway between\n\nthe eastern and western channel.\n\n\"It Is a curious fact that the exist\n\nence of a wide and deep channel on\n\neach side of such a narrow elevation\n\nhas not hitherto attracted much re\n\nmark, although It presents the singular\n\nphenomenon of two full grown rivers or\n\nwaterways, one with a current setting\n\neastward and the other with a current\n\nsetting westward, each apparently\n\nwithout reason for existence from any\n\ndrainage area, the head waters of both\n\nof which are practically at the same\n\nlevel. - -\n\n\"The western channel of the Echl\n\nmanilsh (signifying In Cree \"the river\n\nthat runs both ways\") la followed\n\nthrough the alternate wide and narrow\n\nchannels for 20 miles until Robinson's\n\nPortage is reached, which is three\n\nquarters of a mile In width, with a de\n\nscent to Franklin's Lake of about 45\n\nfeet; thence for R0 miles the route con\n\ntinues through a rocky gorge with a\n\nwall from 70 to 80 feet high, past sev\n\neral rapids, across Pine Lake and\n\nWindy Lake, to the channel leading In\n\nto Oxford Lake, where four rapids and\n\none fall of Aye feet obstruct the pas\n\nsage; thence across Oxford and Back\n\nLake by Trout River to Knee Lake,\n\nfrom which point the route lies through\n\nJack River, with five rapids, Swampy\n\nLake, Hill River, Steel River, and Haze\n\nRiver to York Factory. In the down\n\nward Journey It Is necessary to haul tho\n\nboat over three portages only: vis.: at\n\nthe Painted Stone, 29 yards, at Robin\n\nson's Portage, 1.315 yards, and at Trout\n\nRiver Fall, 24 yards, respectively. In\n\nthe upward Journey there are twenty\n\none deml-charges or tracking places,\n\nwhere a portage of forty yards must he\n\nmade at Island Portage. The distance\n\nover this route from Lake Winnipeg to\n\nYork Factory Is stated to be 372 geo\n\ngraphical miles.\n\n\"There are only 51 miles altogether In\n\nthe whole of that distance, requiring\n\nany Improvement to make it navigable\n\nfrom the city of Winnipeg to the Hudson\n\nBay. Ido not think all of that requires\n\ncanalllng. This Includes all the portions\n\nwhere obstructions have to be removed,\n\nsuch as blasting shoals and removing\n\nboulders. Of course, that opens up an\n\nentirely new field.\"\n\nCopyright, 1898, by Bacheller Syndicate.\n\nThe Corsican Vendetta.\n\nThe Corsloan Was no confidence l«i\n\nlegal Justice, and generally takes the\n\nlaw In his own hands. An insult is Of\n\nfered, or a polMloal dispute arises; whait\n\nis eosner than the discharge of a gun or\n\na stab with a dagger? The result Is a\n\nmock trial; the assassin Is acquitted\n\nbecause of insufficient evidence, but ha\n\nfrs often shot to death as he leaves the\n\ncourtroom. If not, a cross Is generally\n\ndrawn upon the door of his house. The\n\ncross is a threat of death, and the\n\nthreatened one need expect no quarter.\n\nThe vendetta netther sleeps nor knows\n\nWhere *t may stop. It Is not confined to\n\ntwo persons. The quarrels of indi\n\nviduals are taken up by whole famlUe*.\n\nEven collateral branches are not ex\n\nempt, and women must take their\n\nchances with them. Indeed, revenge Is\n\nmore artistically complete when the\n\nMow fells upon the beautiful and gift\n\ned. Threatened persons remain shut up\n\nfor months, or even years, In their\n\nhouses, built, as all Corstcan houses\n\nare, like a fortress. The ground floor\n\nIs occupied by the stalble; and the first\n\nfloor Is reached by an external ladder,\n\noverlooked by a loophole, from which\n\na cannon/ball or a heavy stone can be\n\ndropped on the head of an unwelcome\n\nvisitor. If the voluntary prisoner wish\n\nes to go out for a moment to breathe\n\nthe fresh air on the threshold, a scout\n\ngoes bp Pone and reconnoitres. And this\n\ndeath in life continues unttl they meet\n\ntheir doom or the vendetta if formally\n\nclosed by a written treaty between the\n\nparties.\n\nFed Their Young.\n\nA Pennsylvania farmer whole cutting\n\nwood saw two foxes remaining near a\n\nfallen tree. Upon approaching the tree\n\nhe discovered a targe limb with a cav\n\nity, ln which were two half-grown\n\nfoxes. Neither was able to walk and\n\nevidently had never been out of their\n\nplace of imprisonment. It seems prob\n\nable that the foxes crawled into tha\n\nhole ln the limb when very young and\n\nremained there until they had grown,\n\nso that escape was Impossible. They\n\nhad been fed by the old foxes through\n\nj a very small aperture in the limb."
