        "text": "William Nicholas Hobbs (1896)\n\nWilliam Nicholas Hobbs was one of ten students who graduated from the KCVC in 1896. In Dykstra's review of veterinary pioneers in Kansas (1953), he notes that Dr. W.N. Hobbs was a charter member in 1904 of the KVMA, as was his brother, Dr. Charles Wesley Hobbs (Western Veterinary College, Kansas City, Missouri, 1901). According to Blackmar (1912) in Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Dr. W. N. Hobbs was one of the leading veterinary surgeons of the State of Kansas and a member of a pioneer family of Smith County. The Hobbs family moved from Pike County, Illinois, to Kansas in 1872 and staked a claim in Smith County in the spring of 1872 where they lived in an 18x20 foot log house. The roof was made of poles covered with the bark of cottonwood trees, which was covered with sod and earth, and made a very comfortable pioneer home. There were eight children in the Hobbs family and three of them became veterinarians: Dr. William N. Hobbs (KCVC 1896), Dr. Charles Wesley Hobbs (WVC 1901), and Dr. Daniel H. Hobbs. The Hobbs children began their education in a subscription school in a primitive sod school house in Smith County. They were taught by Miss Nancy Dinwiddie. At that time the school year consisted of a term of only three months, but young Hobbs and his brothers were anxious to obtain an education and improved themselves by self-study, in addition to attending school. Early in life he became interested in the study of medicine, and he and his brother, began reading along medical lines by themselves. Later, they took up the study of veterinary medicine, and when mere boys were considered very capable practical veterinarians and were frequently called to attend sick horses and stock in the neighborhood, and in this way got a great deal of practical experience in early life. In 1894, William Hobbs entered the KCVC, and graduated in the class of 1896 with the degree of Doctor of Veterinary Science. He then located in Holton, Kansas, where he opened a veterinary hospital. He remained in Holton until 1908, when he disposed of his business and moved to Lebanon in Smith County, forming a partnership with his brother, Dr. Daniel H. Hobbs, in the practice of veterinary surgery. From 1911 until 1913 he was also professor of surgery, dentistry and obstetrics at the St. Joseph Veterinary College in St. Joseph, Missouri. In 1911-12 he was president of the KVMA, serving two terms. In 1912 he was appointed by the Kansas Livestock Sanitary Commission to study the horse plague, which swept over the State of Kansas in that year. In 1913 he went to Omaha as manager of the Hawkeye Serum Company and in July 1913 disposed of his interests there, and came to Topeka and established the Topeka Serum Company, which he conducted in partnership with his brother, Dr. Daniel H. Hobbs.\n\nJames C. Keeley (1896)\n\nJames C. Keeley was born in Dungarvan, County of Waterford, Ireland, on February 4, 1868.
