Often the individual's name is not included so the parent's names may need to be known. Record types include certificates, registers, and reports.\n\nBefore 1898\n\nNo governmental agencies in Utah were required by law to record births prior to 1898. Though not required to do so, Salt Lake City and Ogden began registering births in 1890 and Park City began registering births in 1892.\n\n1898-1905\n\nCounty clerks became responsible for recording births beginning in 1898.\n\n1905-1924\n\nIn 1905, the Utah Department of Health assumed responsibility for creating birth certificates for all individuals who were born in Utah. The Soundex birth certificate index is a useful tool created in 1934 in that it is an index of all births in Utah up until that point.\n\nDelayed Birth Certificates\n\nPeople who were born before statewide birth registration and people whose births were not registered within the legal time limit lacked birth certificates. Informally around 1916 and codified into Utah law in 1941, delayed birth certificates are issued a year or more after the birth, and provide all the same rights as a birth certificate. The earliest birth in Utah in this series is from 1862.\n\n1925-present\n\nBirth certificates are private for 100 years from the date of birth (Utah Code 26B-8-125 “Inspection of vital records”). To access a more recent birth record, contact the Utah Office of Vital Records and Statistics or most local health districts for a certified copy.\n\nUtah Office of Vital Records and Statistics\n\nPO Box 141012\n\nSalt Lake City UT 84114-1012\n\nPhone Number 801-538-6105\n\nEmail [email protected]\n\nPage Last Updated August 10, 2023.\n\nYou might also like...\n\nDeath Records Research Guide\n\nHow to research vital records related to death.\n\nMarriage Records Research Guide\n\nHow to research vital records related to marriage."
