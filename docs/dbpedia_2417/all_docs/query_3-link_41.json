        "text": "20 years of experience - Holle Goat Milk Formula\n\nParents have been using our Holle milk formulas made from goat milk for their babies for over 20 years. This makes us not only one of the first suppliers of this cow’s-milk alternative, but we have also relied on organic goat milk from the very beginning. This year, we became the first manufacturer to offer infant goat milk formula in Demeter quality.\n\n‘More than 20 years ago, Holle looked into possibilities for parents who didn’t want to give their babies formulas based on cow’s milk. Goat milk presents itself as a natural alternative. Goat milk is extremely easy to digest and has a long tradition as a source of nutrition for babies and children all over the world. We therefore started to develop formulas made from goat milk, which we launched onto the market as special baby food based on goat milk in 2001. Back then, the authorities had not yet approved goat milk as a source of animal protein. This changed in 2014. Holle, however, had already satisfied thousands of parents in Europe with the product long before.’\n\nUdo Fischer\n\nManaging Director and Head of Marketing, Communications and Business Development\n\nHolle Goat Milk promotion\n\nFor more baaaaaa\n\nBut where does Holle Goat Milk actually come from? And why is it more sustainable?\n\nOur goat milk comes from Demeter farms in the Black Forest and the Sauerland region. We have been campaigning for the use of goat milk in the Black Forest since 2012 and thereby promoting the transition to Demeter farming. This preserves small-scale farms and ensures long-term profitability through stable pricing structures. In addition, goat farming generally makes an important contribution to the climate: in dairy farming, it produces fewer CO2 emissions than dairy cows.\n\nThe goat milk obtained from these farms is used for Holle infant milk made from goat milk. We offer our farmers long-term contracts. And demand is steadily increasing.\n\n\"2025, we aim to be working with around 20 partner farms throughout the Black Forest, which will mean a total of up to 4,000 goats\", states Klaus Brutschin, producer advisor at Holle."
