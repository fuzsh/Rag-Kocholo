        "text": "The National Orchestral Assocation (NOA) was founded in 1930 by Leon Barzin to give student musicians an opportunity to gain experience. A New York Times article of December 7, 1930 defined the purposes of the N.O.A. as, \"To furnish the American orchestral instrumentalist with the same practical opportunities in training and routine which have been open to the European-born players; to supply this training as post-graduate work which the directors of the organization assert is minimized in American conservatories; to prepare players in the reading of standard orchestral literature and to equip them for symphonic posts; to afford young soloists experience before audiences, to play works by young composers, to give apprentice conductors necessary baton technique and directing routine and also to train a nucleus of concertgoers\". An important function of the N.O.A. was its role in commissioning and performing many new compositions.\n\nBarzin served as conductor of the National Orchestral Associaton until 1958, when John Barnett became his successor, himself a graduate of the N.O.A. conductor training program. After a twelve year absence, Barzin once again assumed the position of musical director of the National Orchestral Association, but instead of assuming the conducting resposibilites as well, decided that the organization would be led by Americans who were part of the organization's new conductor's training program.\n\nBy 1948, former members of the orchestra were members of thirty seven leading American orchestras.\n\nBarzin's final appearance with the National Orchestral Association occurred on April 6, 1976 at Carnegie Hall.\n\nThe collection consists of recordings of concerts and rehearsals of the National Orchestral Association between the years 1938 and 1968. The collection also includes intermission features with various soloists.\n\nSome of the soloists included in the collection are: Abram Chasins; Emanuel Feuermann ; Nathan Milstein; Ossy Renardy; Artur Schnabel; Rudolf Serkin; Joseph Szigeti, and Rosalyn Tureck.\n\nSome of the composers represented in this collection are: Johannes Brahms; Aaron Copland; Henry Cowell; Norman Dello Joio; David Diamond; Anis Fuleihan; Morton Gould; Roy Harris; Edouard Lalo; Edward MacDowell; Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart; Joseph Reicha; William Schuman, and Lamar Stringfield.\n\nMany of the performances included in the collection were portions of the WNYC American Music Festival.\n\nAlso included in the collection are the premiere performances of Chameleon variations, by William Laurence Bergsma and Concerto for piano and orchestra by Ezra Laderman.\n\nThe National Orchestral Association collection of rehearsal and concert recordings [sound recording] is arranged in three series:\n\nThis series consists of concerts performed by the National Orchestral Association from 1938 through 1968.\n\nIncluded in this series are the such performers as: Webster Aitken; Claudio Arrau; Abram Chasins; Dessoff Choir; Emanuel Feuermann; William Kroll; Nathan Milstein; Courtlandt Palmer; William Primrose; Artur Schnabel; Elisabeth Schumann; Rudolf Serkin; Patricia Travers, and Rosalyn Tureck.\n\nSome of the guest conductors included in the series are: John Barnett; Leonard Bernstein; Charles Blackman; Hugo Fiorato, and Newell Jenkins.\n\nWorks by such composers as: Isaac Albinez; Johann Sebastian Bach; Nicolai Berezowski; Aaron Copland; Henry Cowell; Paul Creston; Ingolf Dahl; Edward Elgar; Anis Fuleihan; Roy Harris; Kent Kennan; Edward MacDowell; Giacomo Puccini, and William Schuman are included in this series.\n\nAlso included here are various intermission features with many composers, as well as the New York Premiere of Chameleon variations by William Bergsma.\n\nThis series includes rehearsals by the National Orchestral Association. Many of these recordings were broadcast as part of WNYC's American Music Festival. It includes many instances where the composer was present at the time of the rehearsal. In some cases, the composer also conducted or performed his or her own works.\n\nSome of the composers included in this series are: Alviin Brehm; John Alden Carpenter; Domenico Cimarosa; Henry Cowell; Paul Creston; Norman Dello Joio; Domenico Dragonetti; John Duke; David Ferdinand; Isadore Freed; Morton Gould; Edvard Grieg; Paul Hindemith and Henri Wieniawski.\n\nSome of the performers featured in this series are: Clarence Adler; Julius Baker; Philippe Entrement; Milton Katims; Lillian Kallir; Samuel Rhodes; Oscar Shumsky and Zvi Zeitlin.\n\nThis series consistes of an intermission talk with Barnett Buman."
