        "text": "RESULTS\n\nBetween August 2010 and December 2018, 66 MITOHEP participants meeting study entry criteria were enrolled. One participant each was found after enrollment to have bi-allelic pathogenic variants in the genes NBAS and LARS1, which do not cause primary MH and were excluded from this analysis. Between April 2000 and February 2014, 29 participants classified as having definitive or probable MH were enrolled into the PALFSG, 7 of whom were also subsequently enrolled in MITOHEP. Thus, 86 unique participants, to our knowledge the largest single group of patients with MH reported to date, were available for analysis.\n\nParticipant characteristics by clinical presentation group\n\nBaseline characteristics at the time of study enrollment, including demographics, medical history, extrahepatic involvement, and physical examination findings, were compared in Table . Participants with an ALF (n = 37) presentation were notably younger at study enrollment than those with a chronic presentation [median 0.8 y. (range, 0.0, 9.4) vs 3.4 y. (0.2, 18.6), p < 0.001]. Although neurodevelopmental delays were common throughout the cohort, participants in the Chronic group were more likely to be affected at study enrollment (81.3% vs 40.0%, p < 0.001), likely reflecting the challenge of proper assessment of the very young in addition to the anticipated multisystem progression of the disease. Ascites was more common in those with ALF (88.2% vs 6.1%, p < 0.001).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nALF (N = 37)Chronic (N = 40)Post-transplant (N = 9) p; ALF vs ChronicVariableNa n (%) or median (range)Na n (%) or median (range)Na n (%) or median (range)Demographics Age at enrollment (y)370.8 (0.0, 9.4)393.4 (0.2, 18.6)94.8 (0.3, 17.2)< 0.001 Sex (F)3713 (35.1)3514 (40.0)91 (11.1)0.670 Race36—33—8—0.138 White—24 (66.7)—29 (87.9)—4 (50.0)— Black—5 (13.9)—1 (3.0)—1 (12.5)— Asian—5 (13.9)—3 (9.1)—0— Multiracial—2 (5.6)—0—2 (25.0)— Other—0—0—1 (12.5)— Hispanic ethnicity366 (16.7)357 (20.0)93 (33.3)0.717Medical history Delayed development3012 (40.0)3226 (81.3)86 (75.0)< 0.001 Poor weight gain1910 (52.6)3019 (63.3)—NA0.458 Learning disability142 (14.3)3311 (33.3)84 (50.0)0.182 Seizure disorder368 (22.2)3112 (38.7)82 (25.0)0.141 Neurological or neuromuscular disorder149 (64.3)3222 (68.8)87 (87.5)0.766 Gastrointestinal problem147 (50.0)3426 (76.5)97 (77.8)0.072 Hematologic disorder1411 (78.6)3522 (62.9)96 (66.7)0.289Physical examination Length/height z-score24−1.64 (−3.58, 2.71)30−1.23 (−4.75, 0.93)8−1.16 (−4.19, −0.32)0.741 Weight z-score37−1.73 (−4.85, 1.51)30−1.07 (−4.45, 3.20)9−0.91 (−2.84, 0.68)0.217 Weight-for-height z-score250.21 (−3.43, 4.93)21−0.35 (−2.99, 2.00)61.51 (0.39, 2.17)0.834 Head circumference z-score11−1.53 (−4.05, −0.16)12−1.48 (−4.06, 1.02)2−0.87 (−2.45, 0.72)0.854 Ascites3430 (88.2)332 (6.1)—NA< 0.001 Splenomegaly328 (25.0)313 (9.7)NA0.109\n\nBiochemical testing\n\nBiochemical laboratory assessments at study enrollment (Table ) showed that, compared with the Chronic cohort, participants with ALF had significantly higher median levels of markers of hepatocellular injury (AST 231 vs 75 U/L, p = 0.003; ALT 154 vs 73 U/L, p = 0.005; direct/conjugated bilirubin 4.7 vs 0.3 mg/dL; p = 0.005) and of synthetic liver dysfunction (INR 2.8 vs 1.2, p < 0.001). Creatinine was similar between groups and was on average within the normal range, suggesting a low incidence of kidney involvement at the time of study enrollment. As is common in mitochondrial disease, elevated serum lactate levels were found in both the ALF and Chronic cohorts (4.2 vs 2.8 mmol/L, p = 0.3) as was elevation of the lactate to pyruvate (L:P) molar ratio (21 vs 25, p = 0.66). Abnormal acylcarnitine profiles, although overall uncommon, were more frequently noted in the Chronic group (37.5% vs 6.3%, p = 0.004), likely reflecting secondary effects on FAO rather than primary deficiencies.17\n\nTABLE 2\n\nALF (N = 37)Chronic (N = 40)Post-transplant (N = 9)VariableNn (%) or median (range)Nn (%) or median (range)Nn (%) or median (range) p; ALF vs ChronicTotal bilirubin (mg/dL)377.4 (0.7, 29.4)330.6 (0.2, 18.6)—NA<0.001Direct/conjugated bilirubin (mg/dL)324.7 (0.2, 23.6)160.3 (0.0, 14.3)—NA0.005AST (U/L)37231 (24, 7300)3375 (15, 958)—NA0.003ALT (U/L)36154 (22, 5724)3373 (17, 936)—NA0.005GGTP (U/L)2890 (23, 392)2296 (12, 678)—NA0.604PT (s)2830.1 (13.2, 69.0)2614.1 (10.3, 40.3)—NA<0.001INR312.8 (1.0, 7.2)261.2 (0.9, 4.0)—NA<0.001≤2318 (25.8)2622 (84.6)—NA<0.001>23123 (74.2)264 (15.4)—NA<0.001Hemoglobin (g/dL)379.6 (4.4, 14.3)3211.9 (6.9, 15.7)115.1 (15.1, 15.1)0.009White blood cell count (1000/mm3)3711 (2, 34)329 (3, 22)17 (7, 7)0.354Platelet count (1000/mm3)37147 (36, 378)32208 (54, 577)1192 (192, 192)0.012Creatinine (mg/dL)360.3 (0.1, 3.3)300.3 (0.1, 1.0)11.0 (1.0, 1.0)0.841BUN (mg/dL)355.0 (2.0, 66.0)3112.0 (3.0, 19.0)122.0 (22.0, 22.0)0.003Glucose (mg/dL)3492 (5, 173)3389 (53, 298)185 (85, 85)0.754Sodium (mmol/L)37136 (130, 155)33139 (132, 174)1144 (144, 144)0.018Lactate (mmol/L)334.2 (1.0, 21.3)252.8 (1.0, 54.0)51.6 (1.0, 15.8)0.300Pyruvate (mmol/L)170.2 (0.1, 1.0)210.1 (0.1, 0.6)40.1 (0.1, 0.4)0.071Lactate:pyruvate ratio1721 (1, 126)2025 (8, 105)417 (6, 41)0.659Abnormal acylcarnitine profile322 (6.3)249 (37.5)41 (25.0)0.004\n\nEnzymatic measurement, molecular analysis, and phenotype correlation\n\nOverall, 90% (36/40) of the Chronic participants had undergone comprehensive respiratory enzymatic (on liver or muscle tissue or skin fibroblasts) or genetic testing compared with only 43.2% (16/37) of those with ALF. (Table ) However, when testing was obtained, participants with ALF were more likely to have the specific molecular or enzymatic etiology identified (13/16, 81.3%) than those in the Chronic group (22/36, 61.1%). Of those with identified molecular etiologies, the presence of mutations in genes associated with MDS (POLG, MPV17, DGUOK, POLG2, and TYMP) was more common in the ALF than Chronic group [77% (10/13) vs 41% (9/22), respectively]. All participants with a mtDNA deletion or point mutation (n = 6) presented with a chronic phenotype: 4 had large single deletions in mtDNA in the region associated with Pearson Marrow-Pancreas syndrome, 1 had a 6 kb deletion in mtDNA, and 1 participant had a point mutation in the mitochondrial gene ATP6.\n\nTABLE 3\n\nALF (N = 37)Chronic (N = 40)Post-transplant (N = 9)VariableNn (%) or median (range)Nn (%) or median (range)Nn (%) or median (range)Clinical genetic/enzymatic testing1613 (81)3634 (94)88 (100)TGP167 (44)3613 (36)82 (25)WES167 (44)3612 (33)80Genetic/enzymatic testing done3716 (43)4036 (90)98 (89)Genetic/enzymatic diagnosis1613 (81)3622 (61)88 (100) POLG —5 (31)—4 (11)—1 (13) POLG2 ———1 (3)——MDS DGUOK —4 (25)———1 (13) MPV17 —1 (6)—4 (11)—— TYMP; MNGIE —————1 (13) TRMU —1 (6)—2 (6)—3 (38)Mitochondrial RNA translation defect CARS2 ———1 (3)—— PDHA1 —1 (6)———— MTFMT ———1 (3)—— mtDNA mutation ATP6———1 (3)——MtDNA deletion syndrome 6kb deletion mtDNA———1 (3)—— single mtDNA deletion———4 (11)—— mtDNA depletion, IV deficiency or combined I + IV deficiency—————1 (13)Mitochondrial d/o by enzymatic testing or FAOd Complex I deficiency———2 (6)—— Complex I, IV, V deficiency———1 (3)—— Complex IV enzymatic deficiency—————1 (13) LCHAD —1 (6)————Genetic grouping mtDNA depletion syndrome3710 (27)409 (23)93 (33) Mitochondrial RNA Translation defect—2 (5)—4 (10)—3 (33) mtDNA deletion syndrome———6 (15)—— Mitochondrial d/o by enzymatic testing or FAOd—1 (3)—3 (8)—2 (22) Negative WES/TGP testing—2 (5)—11 (28)—— Negative clinical testing, no WES/TGP—1 (3)—3 (8)—— No genetic testing—21 (57)—4 (10)—1 (11)\n\nFor the entire cohort (n = 86), DNA was sequenced in 60 participants and a genetic diagnosis was established in 38 participants (63%). (Table , Figure , Supplemental Tables S1 and S2, http://links.lww.com/HC9/A279) nDNA mutations in 3 genes causing MDS (POLG, DGUOK, and MPV17) and 1 causing a mitochondrial RNA translation defect (TRMU) accounted for the majority (n = 26), whereas disease-causing variants in 6 additional genes (POLG2, TYMP, CARS2, PDHA1, MTFMT, and LCHAD) were only detected in individual participants. (Table ) The genetic variants are discussed in more detail in Supplemental Material. In patients without a genetic or enzymatic diagnosis, despite DNA sequencing (n = 17), 18% presented before the 1 year of life and 82% were characterized as Chronic.

Two clusters emerged with notable findings. Although an ALF phenotype seemed to influence cluster distinction (78% of ALF vs 47% of Chronic participants in Cluster 1, Figure ), additional biochemical and physical parameters were not able to distinguish subcategories of MH disorders (mtDNA depletion vs RNA translation vs mtDNA deletion vs Enzymatic/FAO disorder). This was despite several supervised descriptive findings including serum total bilirubin levels, which while highly variable among patients with a genetic diagnosis of MH were most elevated in patients with MPV17 deficiency (> 9 mg/dL in all patients). (Supplemental Table S2, http://links.lww.com/HC9/A279) Interestingly, cluster 2 contained the majority of patients who despite comprehensive genetic investigation, did not have an identifiable genetic defect contributing to their phenotype.\n\nSurvival\n\nTransplant-free survival among participants enrolled with native liver is shown in Figure (excluding n = 15 participants with no follow-up). By 2 years after enrollment, only 40% remained alive with native liver (SNL). Survival outcomes are listed for patients with a molecular diagnosis (Table ) and for those with a negative genetic workup or without comprehensive genetic testing (Supplemental Tables S3 and S4, http://links.lww.com/HC9/A279). Notably, those in the ALF group had significantly lower transplant-free survival compared with those in the Chronic group at 2 years after enrollment (16% vs 65%, p < 0.001; Figure B).\n\nSeveral biochemical variables predicted clinical outcomes (p < 0.05) in both the ALF and Chronic groups (Table ), including total bilirubin, AST, and ALT. Interestingly, higher aminotransferase levels in the Chronic group were strongly predictive of death or LT [AST log2 HR 2.51 (95% CI: 1.44–4.38) and ALT log2 HR 2.68 (95% CI: 1.31–5.50)], whereas in the ALF cohort, higher aminotransferase levels predicted better SNL [AST log2 HR, 0.73 (95% CI: 0.55–0.98) and ALT log2 HR, 0.77 (95% CI: 0.60–1.00)]. L:P ratio alone predicted death/transplant in the ALF cohort [log2 HR, 2.83 (95% CI: 1.17–6.82), p = 0.020] whereas higher platelet count [log2 HR, 0.30 (95% CI: 0.14–0.67), p = 0.003] and hemoglobin levels [HR, 0.53 (95% CI: 0.36–0.79) per g/dL, p = 0.002] was predictive of transplant-free survival in the Chronic disease group. Clinically, although ascites was rarely reported in the Chronic disease cohort, its presence was associated strongly with poor transplant-free survival [HR, 11.31 (95% CI: 1.85–69.10), p = 0.009]. Finally, poor nutritional status reflected by low length/height z-scores was also predictive of worse survival in the Chronic [z-score HR, 0.55 (95% CI: 0.32–0.95), p = 0.031] but not the ALF group.\n\nTABLE 5\n\nALFChronicVariableHR (95% CI) p HR (95% CI) p Age at enrollment (y), log20.85 (0.69–1.05)0.1240.73 (0.53–1.01)0.055Sex (Female vs Male)0.32 (0.11–0.95) 0.039 1.81 (0.52–6.27)0.351White vs Non-White1.14 (0.50–2.61)0.7540.39 (0.08–2.01)0.260Hispanic vs Non-Hispanic1.33 (0.39–4.52)0.6430.75 (0.16–3.55)0.712Delayed development0.35 (0.11–1.08)0.0692.42 (0.31–19.15)0.402Poor weight gain0.65 (0.18–2.38)0.5201.68 (0.32–8.72)0.539Learning disability0.84 (0.10–6.97)0.8710.39 (0.08–1.87)0.241Seizure disorder0.91 (0.36–2.31)0.8511.60 (0.45–5.71)0.471Length/height z-score1.01 (0.70–1.46)0.9460.55 (0.32–0.95) 0.031 Weight z-score1.05 (0.75–1.47)0.7960.69 (0.46–1.05)0.080Head circumference z-score0.89 (0.26–3.02)0.8480.78 (0.42–1.46)0.437Ascites1.40 (0.33–5.97)0.65111.31 (1.85–69.10) 0.009 Splenomegaly0.63 (0.24–1.70)0.3671.39 (0.17–11.70)0.759Total bilirubin (mg/dL), log21.37 (1.02–1.83) 0.036 1.87 (1.34–2.62) <0.001 Direct/conjugated bilirubin (mg/dL), log21.18 (0.88–1.58)0.2681.39 (1.00–1.92) 0.049 AST (U/L), log20.73 (0.55–0.98) 0.035 2.51 (1.44–4.38) 0.001 ALT (U/L), log20.77 (0.60–1.00) 0.049 2.68 (1.31–5.50) 0.007 GGTP (U/L), log20.70 (0.41–1.19)0.1911.22 (0.70–2.12)0.493PT (s), log21.50 (0.73–3.08)0.265——INR, log21.18 (0.58–2.41)0.651——INR >2 vs ≤21.44 (0.48–4.31)0.520——Hemoglobin (g/dL)1.07 (0.90–1.27)0.4260.53 (0.36–0.79) 0.002 White blood cell count (1000/mm3), log20.85 (0.56–1.29)0.4440.84 (0.31–2.27)0.732Platelet count (1000/mm3), log20.75 (0.49–1.15)0.1840.30 (0.14–0.67) 0.003 Creatinine (mg/dL), log20.75 (0.48–1.16)0.1900.44 (0.18–1.10)0.079BUN (mg/dL), log20.86 (0.62–1.20)0.3890.54 (0.21–1.41)0.209Glucose (per 20 mg/dL)0.86 (0.70–1.06)0.1580.96 (0.71–1.30)0.814Sodium (mmol/L), log2————Lactate (mmol/L), log21.15 (0.74–1.78)0.5291.43 (0.82–2.51)0.209Pyruvate (mmol/L), log20.31 (0.09–1.05)0.0612.09 (0.57–7.72)0.268Lactate:pyruvate ratio, log22.83 (1.17–6.82) 0.020 2.06 (0.61–7.01)0.245Abnormal acylcarnitine profile2.58 (0.58–11.57)0.2160.38 (0.04–3.38)0.383\n\nLiver transplant and other outcomes\n\nEighteen participants (21%) underwent LT in our cohort, 9 before enrollment and another 9 after enrollment. For the 9 enrolled after transplantation, the median age at transplant was 8 months and 8 were males. Developmental delay was common at enrollment (75%), and participants were proportionally short and underweight with decreased head circumference measurements (Table ). Median L:P ratios trended to be lower than participants enrolled with native liver (17 vs 22, NS) (Table ). Genetic testing identified a genetic basis in the majority of those transplanted before enrollment, with TRMU being the most commonly affected gene (Table ). Among the total 18 participants who underwent transplantation, with over 33.6 patient-years of follow-up after transplant, 3 deaths were reported (1 participant with POLG-related MH and 2 participants without genetic testing). Among the 15 survivors, those with a diagnosis of DGUOK or TRMU deficiency accounted for 7 cases.\n\nIn a subset of post-LT participants with available data, 10 participants had 26.3 patient years of follow-up for assessment. Extrahepatic involvement occurred in 6/10, with the development of new systemic manifestations including developmental delays (n = 6), learning disabilities (n = 2), and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 1).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nMH encompasses a growing list of heterogeneous disorders where liver complications may drive significant morbidity and mortality. Our data on the largest cohort of patients with suspected MH suggest that although phenotypic presentation can span a continuum from ALF to chronic hepatic disease, routine biomarkers, and clinical features do not uniformly differentiate between subcategories of MH. Still, unique differences can be seen between the ALF and chronic cohorts and liver transplantation seems to provide a therapeutic benefit to certain subpopulations. MH as a cause of ALF in children is uncommon, reported in <3% of PALFSG participants.8 However, MHs are responsible for ALF in ~20% of infants younger than 2 years old, representing one of the most frequent etiologies in this age group.18 In our cohort, 43% of participants (37/86) presented with an ALF phenotype, which was accompanied by high mortality. Those presenting with ALF were significantly younger than the Chronic cohort, possibly reflecting more extensive perturbations of hepatocyte mitochondrial function leading to liver failure at a younger age. Notably, the clinical scenario in which a young child presents with severe hepatic dysfunction suspicious for MD presents unique challenges as LT remains a controversial intervention given the potential for post-LT extrahepatic disease progression. However, several genetic causes of MH, including TRMU and DGUOK, have now been suggested to carry less risk.19,20 Therefore, knowing the patient’s genotype is crucial for optimal shared decision-making regarding LT and opportunities for survival. Our data support this notion. Furthermore, while severe, multisystemic involvement is considered a contraindication for LT in MH,21 our findings demonstrate that extrahepatic disease is rarely present at the time of presentation with ALF. Thus, expanded clinical use of more contemporary, ultra-rapid next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis is needed to reduce diagnostic delay, improve diagnostic certainty, and optimize prognostic accuracy where LT decisions may be needed. Alternatively, we found that an etiology for MH was due to abnormalities in four genes (POLG, DGUOK, MPV17, and TRMU) that accounted for the majority of cases. In the context of ALF, targeted sequencing should be considered if it accelerates genetic evaluation.\n\nThe role of LT in MD is evolving. Reports describing the use of LT as a bulk enzyme replacement therapy in otherwise fatal MD, such as ethylmalonic encephalopathy and mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy syndrome, underscore its potential in selected disorders.22 To our knowledge, our cohort of 18 LT recipients is the largest series reported to date. Our outcome study reaffirms that LT among patients with TRMU and DGUOK deficiency without considerable extrahepatic involvement may be beneficial. Moreover, while the absence of extrahepatic involvement does not exclude multisystem disease progression after transplant,21 our data show that severe, progressive multisystem disease was uncommon during short-term follow-up in the selective group that underwent transplantation. However, we advocate that more data, including detailed longer-term follow-up studies in patients with molecularly phenotyped MH, are needed before more definitively determining which subgroup of patients with MH should be offered LT. This is underscored by our cohort of TRMU deficiency (n = 5 with follow-up), all of whom survived, but only one with native liver, which may be interpreted to suggest LT as potential therapy to promote survival. However, in other reports (n = 19), survival with native liver was 68% at 5 years.23,24 Many of these patients received N-acetyl cysteine and L-cysteine, which were subsequently recommended by the authors to improve survival.23 In addition, the missense mutation G379C, which was highly prevalent among our cohort, was not detected in the other reports, raising the possibility of genotype-phenotype correlations. Ultimately, while some of the more severe phenotypes of MH (such as valproate-associated liver failure caused by POLG mutations or Navajo neurohepatopathy caused by MPV17 mutations) may still be considered relative contraindications to LT, an improved understanding of the relationship between specific genetic variants to post-transplant outcomes is needed to better inform transplant decision making and identify those in whom LT may be beneficial.\n\nHistorically, tissue enzymology or genetic testing supplemented history, physical examination, and other biochemical marker findings to maximize diagnostic certainty and inform medical decisions in MH. Indeed, this was the case during the early period of MITOHEP, in which enrollment criteria cast a broad net and did not require a known genetic defect for enrollment. More recently, rapid genotype testing and gene chip technologies have transformed the field of diagnostics. These advances are enabling ever more accurate and timely diagnoses 25,26 while simultaneously eliminating the need for more invasive testing such as respiratory chain enzyme and mtDNA depletion assessment on biopsies of affected tissues. In our cohort, the disparity in performing comprehensive enzymatic/genetic testing (90% in Chronic vs 43.2% in ALF) likely reflected the clinical course where ALF precluded biopsy or prohibited time for genetic testing results. Yet, in those in whom genetic or enzymatic testing was performed, it is remarkable that confirmatory defects were more common in the ALF cohort compared with the participants with Chronic (81.3% vs 61.1%). Similar to other reports,20,27 MDS was more commonly found with an ALF presentation (63% vs 25%). Still, we do note the large-scale mtDNA deletions and pathogenic point mutations present in 27% (6 of 22, Table ) of those with chronic liver disease and a genetic or enzymatic diagnosis. This underscores that mtDNA sequencing ought to be considered in addition to more traditional nDNA investigations, particularly in patients with a more indolent phenotype, as these patients are at risk of developing complications associated with Pearson marrow-pancreas and Kearns-Sayre syndromes and early diagnosis is critical for anticipatory guidance.28,29 The overall diagnostic yield of comprehensive genetic and enzymatic testing from participants enrolled before transplantation was 67% (35/52), underscoring the need for future investigative efforts to identify additional genetic diseases that result in a phenotype consistent with a MH.\n\nThe importance of this effort is accentuated by the findings of our cluster analysis. Cluster 1 retained both the majority of patients with an identified genetic diagnosis and those with an ALF presentation. Notably, the largest subset of cluster 2 was those who met MITOHEP study enrollment criteria, yet despite comprehensive genetic testing (both WES and TGP) did not have underlying genetic etiology identified. Various scenarios could explain this finding. The first suggests a lack of stringency as previous examinations of the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing have noted a range from 15% to 50%.30–32 Subsequently, efforts to periodically re-examine historical exome data has led to new discovery31 with general recommendations to periodically re-evaluate patients lacking an identified genetic etiology as diagnostic testing advances.33 Alternatively, there exists yet unrecognized genetic etiologies that could be uncovered with even more comprehensive testing such as whole genome sequencing.34–36 A multiomics approach combining whole genome sequencing with transcriptomics using RNASeq and proteomics could be considered. This combination has resulted in a 10%–30% increase in the diagnostic rate of MD.34,37–39 Furthermore, environmental40 or epigenetic41 factors may be at play, responsible for acquired mitochondrial dysfunction manifesting with liver disease. Indeed, any combination of the above could contribute to a phenotype consistent with MH but without an as yet identifiable genetic underpinning. Importantly, however, we need to consider the possibility that patients in cluster 2 represent “phenocopies” of MH where non-MDs may mimic symptoms suggestive of MH.33 Our own experience with NBAS and LARS1 reflects this possibility as the patients were enrolled with a MH phenotype, but later had testing that uncovered an alternative genetic etiology for their symptoms.\n\nBiochemical parameter analysis yielded several notable findings. The prognostic effect of aminotransferase elevations in the ALF and Chronic groups is of interest with higher AST and ALT associated with poor outcomes in participants with the chronic presentation. In contrast, in the ALF cohort, higher aminotransferase levels were associated with a decreased risk of transplant or death, supporting what has been reported in larger PALFSG cohorts.42 It is hypothesized that higher aminotransferases in ALF may indicate more residual viable hepatocyte mass and reflect a better chance of liver regeneration and recovery. Regarding diagnostic testing, elevations in lactate and the L:P ratio have historically been viewed as sensitive markers for mitochondrial disease. In our cohort, lactate and the L:P ratio were elevated but were not significantly different between ALF and Chronic phenotypes and neither group had median L:P ratios greater than the consensus benchmark for MD of 25.43,44 Lactate levels in the ALF group trended higher, which may be more reflective of systemic illness severity as recent work from the PALFSG has demonstrated that lactate elevations are common in ALF of all causes and not specific to MH.44 Although recently identified biomarkers for mitochondrial disease, such as the plasma cytokine growth factors FGF-21 and GDF-15, have demonstrated promise in certain clinical presentations such as myopathy,45–48 they have shown overall poor specificity when used in general.49 Still, their diagnostic use in the setting of liver disease is currently unexplored.\n\nWe acknowledge several biases and limitations in this study. First, although MITOHEP enrollment criteria were established almost 15 years ago, we recognize that a universally accepted clinical definition of MH remains elusive, and a gold standard is lacking. Indeed, some authors have suggested that a diagnosis requires an identified genetic etiology.33 Our study involved a wider group of participants with an applicable phenotype to enable future discovery of new etiologies, and efforts are underway in ChiLDReN in this regard. We also recognize an enrollment bias, particularly in those participants after LT as patients who may have received a LT and died were not able to be enrolled. Therefore, our post-LT cohort may reflect a population more amenable to transplant. Finally, we recognize the inherent bias in including only children whose families agreed to participate in the prospective study, potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings.\n\nIn conclusion, we present data from the largest prospective, multicenter study of the clinical presentation and outcomes of patients presenting with suspected MH. We observed that a relatively large percentage of participants underwent liver transplantation despite the controversy around this therapy for MH. Furthermore, cluster analysis revealed a group of patients meeting enrollment criteria but without an identified genetic or enzymatic diagnosis after comprehensive investigations, highlighting opportunities for further investigation. Most notably, major differences were found in etiology, systemic involvement, and outcomes of those presenting with ALF compared with the more common Chronic phenotype."
