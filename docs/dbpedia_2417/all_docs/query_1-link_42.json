        "text": "Information on Britton Cemetery:\n\nThe community of Britton, Texas, is split between Tarrant and Ellis Counties. The town was situated on the Texas and New Orleans Railroad. State Highway 34 went through Britton until the new Highway 287 was constructed about four miles west of town in the 1940s.\n\nF. S. Windle built the first and only elevator, encouraging farmers to grow small grain crops. George Magee donated land for a cemetery as well as the Methodist Church. G. W. Maynard donated land for the Baptist Church and built the first store. Garrett Maynard was the first postmaster in 1895.\n\nBritton Cemetery is located in Britton, Texas, on the Ellis County side of town.
