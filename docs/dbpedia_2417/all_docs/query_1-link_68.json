Spain transferred possession of Cuba, the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico to the United States.\n\nThe U.S. subsequently made Cuba a “protectorate,” limiting Cuban independence.\n\nIn the Philippines, the U.S. replaced Spain as colonial ruler, despite the fact that rebel leader Emilio Aguinaldo had written a Declaration of Independence modeled after the U.S. declaration of 1776.\n\nAndrew Carnegie, the steel titan, offered to pay the U.S. government $20 million not to keep the Philippines.\n\nIn February 1899, fighting broke out between occupying U.S. soldiers and Filipino soldiers, the beginning of a long and brutal war to crush Filipino aspirations for independence.\n\nWhereas the U.S. war against Spain lasted four months (late April-August 1898), the U.S.-Filipino War lasted more than four years.\n\nAttempting to avoid the charge of imperialism, President William McKinley described the U.S. mission in the Philippines as one of “benevolent assimilation.”\n\nThe U.S.-Filipino War resulted in the death of an estimated 200,000 Filipinos, mostly civilians, and 4,200 American soldiers.\n\nA U.S. Senate inquiry in early 1902 revealed that U.S. commanders authorized torture practices, such as the “water cure,” and ordered the killing of Filipino civilians and prisoners.\n\nAmong the critics of the U.S.-Filipino War was Mark Twain, a vice president of the Anti-Imperialist League, who denounced the war as an unjust attempt to “subjugate the people of the Philippines.”\n\nThe U.S. finally granted independence to the Philippines in 1946.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nThe War of 1898, commonly known in the United States as the Spanish-American War, marked a new chapter in U.S. foreign policy. For a quarter century prior to the war, Americans had debated the idea of acquiring overseas possessions. The war against Spain, fought in Cuba and the Philippines in the summer of 1898, opened the door to expansionist ambitions. Over the next seven years, the United States annexed the Hawaiian Islands, took possession of the Philippines, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Eastern Samoa, joined other imperial powers in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion in China, made Cuba a “protectorate” of the United States, fomented a revolt in the Colombian province of Panama in order to obtain a ten-mile-wide canal zone, and declared that the U.S. would henceforth exercise “international police power” over the Western Hemisphere, militarily intervening in nations deemed guilty of “chronic wrongdoing.”\n\nThe great irony of the War of 1898 is that many Americans supported U.S. intervention in Cuba not for the purpose of taking possession of Cuba or the Philippines, but for anti-imperialist and humanitarian purposes. U.S. imperial ambitions were initially muted. The Cuban Revolution, which began in 1895, elicited sympathy among Americans for the cause of Cuba Libre. The brutal Spanish response to it, which included relocating civilians into fortified towns (reconcentration) where they died by the thousands from disease or starvation, evoked outrage and prompted calls for U.S. intervention. The mysterious explosion of the U.S. battleship Maine in the Havana harbor in February 1898, erroneously blamed on Spain, was a catalyst to war but not the determining factor.\n\nPresident William McKinley, in his war message to Congress on April 11, 1898, cited as the main causes for war against Spain the “enormous losses to American trade and commerce” and the need “to put an end to the barbarities, bloodshed, starvation, and horrible miseries now existing there [in Cuba].”[1] Only after the Spanish surrendered did the McKinley administration reveal its hand and claim the spoils of war. In the peace treaty that ended the war, signed on December 10, 1898, with no Cuban or Filipino representatives present, Spain transferred possession of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States.\n\nIn the aftermath of the War of 1898, U.S. troops continued to occupy Cuba until significant concessions were made, including the right to militarily intervene in Cuba at any time, to approve foreign treaties, and to establish a naval base at Guantánamo. According to the historian Piero Gleijeses, “U.S. intervention hastened Spain’s departure and robbed the Cubans of their independence. It was as if France, having intervened in the American war of independence, had demanded a naval base on Long Island and the right to send in troops whenever it deemed it necessary. Had this happened, the U.S. people would hardly be grateful to the French for hastening the departure of the British.”[2] And so it was in Cuba. The Cuban patriots who had fought for independence for three and a half years were obliged to accept their nation’s status as a “protectorate” of the United States.\n\nIn the Philippines, the McKinley administration demanded full control over the archipelago of 7,100 islands, refusing to recognize the independent Filipino government established under rebel leader Emilio Aguinaldo. Less than two months after the peace treaty was signed, the U.S. was at war with its former Filipino allies, suppressing rather than upholding their freedom. This second war, the U.S.-Filipino War, also known as the Philippine-American War or the Philippine Insurrection, claimed the lives of 200,000 Filipino civilians.\n\nWas the War of 1898 a necessary and just war?\n\nCertainly, it was not a war for self-defense, the traditional grounds for establishing a war’s legitimacy. Spain posed no threat to the United States and indeed desperately sought to avoid war.\n\nCan the war be justified on humanitarian grounds, a more controversial standard, as put forth by President McKinley? This justification has some merit, as U.S. intervention in Cuba did seal the defeat of the Spanish and put an end to the miseries attending the Cuban Revolutionary War, but it is problematic on two counts.\n\nFirst, it is not clear that war was the only or best option for ending the humanitarian crisis in Cuba, assuming this was a true motive. As a starting point, the McKinley administration could have negotiated with both sides for the provision of food and medical aid to the civilian population, much as the United Nations does today in war-torn regions. To end the fighting, the administration could have continued its diplomatic pressure on Spain, which had already produced significant results, including a new autonomy plan for Cuba and an end to the Spanish policy of reconcentration. To increase the pressure short of putting boots on the ground, the administration could have instituted a naval blockade until Madrid yielded to Cuban demands for independence.\n\nThe second and more fundamental problem is that neither humanitarian concerns nor public sympathy for Cuba Libre outweighed U.S. imperial motives, which became evident in the aftermath of the war. According to the foremost American historian on Cuba, Louis A. Pérez, U.S. leaders throughout the 19th century had opposed Cuban independence, based in part on their desire to annex Cuba to the United States and in part on their belief that the mixed race Cuban population was incapable of running its own affairs. In early March 1898, President McKinley’s minister to Spain, Stewart Woodford, wrote to Washington, “I do not believe that the population is today fit for self-government.” He characterized the Cuban insurgency as “confined almost entirely to negroes,” with “few whites in the rebel forces.” Cuban independence, he cautioned, “would mean and involve continuous disorder and practical anarchy…. Peace can hardly be assured by the insurgents through and under an independent government.” Woodford recommended that the U.S. annex the island, but neither the Cuban leadership nor the U.S. Congress would have accepted this outcome. In lieu of annexation, President McKinley and his successor, Theodore Roosevelt, found ways to exert U.S. control over the island without annexing it.[3] In the end, Pérez writes,\n\nThe United States emerged from the war as a colonial power, seizing the far-flung remnants of the Spanish empire in the Pacific and Caribbean with remarkable efficiency of effort and economy of means. Whether or not empire was the object may matter less than that it was the outcome, as the United States acquired territories in the time-honored fashion of war and conquest … Successively the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico were seized. But it was Cuba that mattered most and, indeed, what the war was mostly about.[4]\n\nThe War of 1898 and the U.S.-Filipino War are traditionally paired together because the outcome of the first led to the second. The Treaty of Paris enabled the United States to take possession of the Philippines despite the fact that Filipino rebels had been fighting for independence since August 1896. As in Cuba, the U.S. informally allied with the rebels in defeating the Spanish, then claimed victory alone and took control. In the case of the Philippines, the U.S. insisted on replacing Spain as colonial master. This was the simple reason for the U.S.-Filipino War that broke out in February 1899.\n\nWas the U.S.-Filipino War a necessary and just war?\n\nUndoubtedly it was not. In denying the Filipinos the right to form their own government the war was fundamentally unjust in its purpose. U.S. conduct in the war was also reprehensible, similar to the savage U.S. wars against Native Americans in the West and unlike the brief war against Spain. The U.S. treated Spanish soldiers respectfully and even paid for their return to Spain. The U.S. war against the Filipinos, in contrast, was characterized by racism, torture, wanton violence, atrocities, massacres, and an egregious reconcentration policy similar to that of the Spanish in Cuba.\n\nThe McKinley and Roosevelt administrations did their utmost to obfuscate the central motive of the U.S.-Filipino War – the quest for empire – as it contradicted American democratic principles and freedom-loving rhetoric. On December 21, 1898, prior to the outbreak of war, President McKinley declared that “the mission of the United States is one of benevolent assimilation, substituting the mild sway of justice and right for arbitrary rule.” Should the Filipinos reject American rule, however, he warned that the U.S. would maintain “the strong arm of authority to repress disturbance and to overcome all obstacles to the bestowal of the blessings of good and stable government upon the people of the Philippine Islands under the free flag of the United States.”[5]\n\nThe suppression of Filipino freedom, as such, was carried out in the name of extending American freedom, as if placing the American flag on a foreign territory made it free and democratic. This conflation of national hegemony with democratic principles became a model for rationalizing future U.S. foreign policies. Indeed, in the second half of the 20th century the conflation became axiomatic, with Washington supporting dictatorial and repressive regimes in the name of protecting the “free world.”\n\nThe U.S. war in the Philippines continued for three and a half years before President Theodore Roosevelt declared it over in July 1902, even though fighting continued in outlying islands for another decade. To keep the brutal nature of the war hidden from the American public, the McKinley and Roosevelt administrations engaged in censorship, official denial, media spin, glittering generalities, and intimidation of war critics. Many citizens nonetheless challenged the fiction of “benevolent assimilation” and denounced the imperial war as un-American and unjust. Some joined the Anti-Imperialist League, formed in June 1898 in opposition to overseas expansionism and colonial conquests.\n\nThe famous writer Mark Twain, a vice-president of the League, told the New York Herald upon his return from Europe in October 1900:\n\nI have read carefully the treaty of Paris, and I have seen that we do not intend to free, but to subjugate the people of the Philippines. We have gone there to conquer, not to redeem…. It should, it seems to me, be our pleasure and duty to make those people free, and let them deal with their own domestic questions in their own way. And so I am an anti-imperialist. I am opposed to having the eagle put its talons on any other land.[6]\n\nIn Congress, Senator George Hoar of Massachusetts attempted to head off the war by introducing a bill to recognize Filipino independence. Had it passed, the war would not have happened. Indeed, Filipino rebel leader Emilio Aguinaldo wanted desperately to continue the friendly, informal alliance he had with Americans during their mutual fight against Spain in 1898. He was even willing to allow the U.S. a military base in the Philippines. Had the McKinley administration offered even the limited independence of a “protectorate” status, as was done in Cuba, the Filipino “insurrection” would not have taken place.\n\nThe fact that the U.S. finally granted independence to the Philippines in 1946, after forty-eight years of colonial rule, raises the question of why the U.S. fought to make the Philippines a colony in the first place. The answer to this question requires some understanding of the imperial mindset of the era. Few people at the time could foresee the demise of imperialism and its racist underpinnings – the “white man’s burden” – in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nII. From continental to overseas expansion\n\nOver the course of the nineteenth century, the United States expanded westward across the North American landmass. This was not a uniform process. The U.S. acquired new territory through negotiation, intimidation, purchase, aggression, and the removal of Native Americans to reservations. Expansion was intertwined with notions of Anglo Saxon racial superiority and a sense of “entitlement justifying Anglo dominance over other, supposedly lesser peoples,” including American Indians and African and native-born slaves.[7] Continued expansion, and the violence that accompanied it, are central not only to nineteenth American history, but to U.S. national identity as well.\n\nThose who favored overseas expansion, such as Theodore Roosevelt, believed that Anglo Americans had the right to dispossess Native Americans of their lands. According to the historian Walter L. Williams, “Roosevelt’s basic claim was that Indians did not own their homelands, and thus had no right to oppose white expansion.” The denial of land ownership rights was later extended to the denial of the right of self-governance. The U.S. moved from making treaties with independent “domestic nations” to exerting complete control over them. “By the end of the century,” writes Williams, “the federal government held virtually unlimited power over American Indians.” Indian tribal lands were essentially colonies of the United States and Native Americans born on reservations had no citizenship rights.\n\nAmerican westward expansion established the basis for obtaining overseas possessions in three ways: it created the legal framework for acquiring and administering colonial possessions; it established in the public mind an exception to the principle that “all men are created equal” and have the right to self-government; and it fostered acceptance of “uncivilized” methods of warfare against “savages,” in which no prisoners were taken and noncombatants were massacred. Roosevelt deemed such warfare “justifiable revenge” for enemy atrocities.[8]\n\nBy 1850, the United States had completed its “manifest destiny” by expanding from the Atlantic to the Pacific. With the exception of filibusters – lawless adventurers intent on taking over territory and expanding slavery into the Caribbean and Latin America – the nation largely focused on the growing discord between the North and South over the issue of slavery. After the Civil War, U.S. policymakers were absorbed in the process of Reconstruction of the South. One conspicuous exception was Secretary of State William Seward, who entertained the expansion of territory and acquisition of overseas markets from Canada to China. In 1867, Seward promised an audience in Boston, “Give me…fifty, forty, thirty more years of life, and I will give you possession of the American continent and control of the world.”[9] He succeeded in purchasing the Russian territory of Alaska and annexing the Midway Islands. Under President Ulysses S. Grant, the U.S. tried to purchase the Dominican Republic in 1870, but the Senate defeated this attempt to incorporate non-whites into the union. The next generation of policymakers would be more receptive to expansionist designs.\n\nWhat drove U.S. overseas expansion?\n\nHistorians have associated the U.S. drive for overseas expansion in the late 19th century with a number of factors. Without attempting to prioritize them, these include:\n\nthe closing of the frontier\n\nthe search for new markets and resources abroad\n\nthe quest to make the U.S. a great international power\n\na desire to spread American influence across the globe\n\na belief in Anglo-Saxon superiority\n\na tradition of “manly honor”\n\ndomestic politics\n\nThe closing of the frontier was announced in the U.S. Census of 1890. The Indian wars in the West had ended and the frontier was regarded as “settled.” The historian Frederick Jackson Turner contemplated the meaning of this change in an academic paper, “The Significance of the Frontier in History,” delivered in 1893. Emphasizing the importance of western expansion in the formation of the American character, Turner speculated that Americans would continue to seek expansion, extending “American influence to outlying islands and adjoining countries,” and demanding a “vigorous foreign policy.”[10]\n\nThe second industrial revolution in the United States laid the material groundwork for the American pursuit of empire, providing both the means for overseas enterprises and a need for more consumer markets. Between the end of the Civil War and the War of 1898, the United States was transformed from an agrarian and rural nation to an increasingly industrialized and urban one. The economic depression of 1893 reinforced the idea that the U.S. needed new markets abroad. While populists and socialists proposed to solve the crisis of overproduction by redistributing income and wealth to citizens at home, politicians such as Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana called for the acquisition of overseas markets. In April 1897, he declared, “American factories are making more than the American people can use; American soil is producing more than they can consume. Fate has written our policy for us; the trade of the world must and shall be ours.”[11]\n\nTo obtain and protect new foreign markets as well as expand American power and influence, Admiral Alfred T. Mahan called for the creation of a larger navy and a network of naval bases and seaports. His influential book, The Influence of Sea Power upon History (1890), found a receptive audience among other American expansionists, most notably, future president Theodore Roosevelt and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts. Both Roosevelt and Lodge believed that great nations must acquire overseas territory and, without a large navy, this would be impossible. Senator Lodge, in extolling his “large policy,” rattled off the territorial acquisitions necessary to transform the United States: Hawaii, Cuba, Puerto Rico and a trans-isthmian canal across Nicaragua. He warned his colleagues that time was running out, as other nations were obtaining colonies and spheres of influence: “The great nations are rapidly absorbing for their future expansion and their present defense all the waste places of earth…. As one of the great nations of the world, the United States must not fall out of the line of march.”[12]\n\nEuropean imperialism was at its height in the late 19th century, facilitated by coal-powered ships, railroads, more lethal weaponry, and advances in medical science (disease prevention). A conference held in Berlin in November 1884 set the stage for the “Scramble for Africa.” By 1900, 95% of the continent had been carved up into European colonies, with Great Britain and France leading the way. On the Asian continent, Britain ruled the vast Indian subcontinent, France claimed Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia today), the Netherlands controlled Indonesia, Russia expanded to the Pacific, and Japan, the only non-European imperialist nation, dominated Korea. In the Pacific, the imperial powers were racing to take possession of various island groups, with the U.S. laying claim to the Hawaiian Islands and eastern Samoa. Great Britain and France rationalized their conquest and control over other lands and peoples in the language of racial and cultural superiority, declaring it their duty to civilize the “lesser nations” and uplift the “lower races.” This was also true of the Japanese, who considered themselves superior to other Asian peoples, not unlike the way Anglo Americans deemed themselves superior to Latin Americans.\n\nThe construction of a multi-ocean U.S. naval fleet in the 1880s and the formal acquisition of Eastern Samoa in June 1889 encouraged American imperial dreams and ambitions. Imperialist voices became bolder and more numerous. U.S. diplomat Henry Sanford, writing in The Forum (June 1890), contended, “The scramble in Africa for ‘protectorates’ and possessions, and for the extension of ‘spheres of influence’ and action, by the commercial powers of Europe, is the event of the century…. Are we to avail ourselves of the opportunity at our hand, or shall nations reputed less enterprising than we alone reap benefits from it?”[13] Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Tracy declared in 1891 that in order to gain “a pre-eminent rank among nations, colonies are of the greatest help.”[14] General Thomas Jordan, a veteran of both the Mexican War and Civil War, published an article in The Forum (July 1891), titled “Why We Need Cuba,” which called for immediate annexation of the island. Rear Admiral S. B. Luce, the first president of the Naval War College, writing in the North American Review (December 1891), expressed the lofty sentiment that “the course of empire” obliged the United States to contribute “her share to the further extension of civilization, to the spreading of the gospel, and conveying to less favored nations the most enlightened views of civil government.” Luce also believed that war was “one of the great agencies by which human progress is effected.”[15]\n\nThe quest for empire in the late 19th century was undergirded by Social Darwinist theories of superior and inferior races. Both Europeans and Anglo Americans deemed it their duty to “civilize” the “lesser races,” which meant in practice ruling over them. Supporters of imperialism also created racial hierarchies in which the Anglo-Saxon race (for the British and U.S. imperialists) appeared at the top.\n\nIn the U.S., the proponents of empire incorporated racist views into the quasi-religious concept of “manifest destiny,” a phrase coined in 1845 to justify U.S. expansion across the North American continent. Congregationalist minister Josiah Strong, in his 1885 book, Our Country, proclaimed that Americans were a “Chosen People” destined to rule the earth. “Is it manifest,” he asked rhetorically, “that the Anglo-Saxon holds in his hands the destinies of mankind for ages to come? Is it evident that the United States is to be the home of this race, the principal seat of his power, the great center of his influence?” That same year, the historian John Fiske wrote an essay in Harper’s New Monthly Magazine titled “Manifest Destiny,” predicting that the U.S. would surpass “in power and dimensions any empire that has yet existed,” and that this empire would stretch “from pole to pole” in the 20th century.[16]\n\nThe rhetoric of empire-building was laced with references to “manly honor” and “national manhood.” As the historian Kristin Hoganson writes, “honor appealed to men frustrated by the restraints of an ever more corporate economy and the commercial values of the era. It also proved enticing to those who were disturbed by changing gender roles, for honor served as the keystone of a chivalric edifice that enshrined men’s public authority and women’s domesticity.” Progressive-minded women at the time were challenging prevailing gender norms regarding a woman’s role in society as well as demanding the vote. By 1900, four western states had established full woman suffrage. Hoganson argues that the advocacy of empire-building and war served to demonstrate masculine virility and reinforce the “manly ideal of politics.”[17]\n\nFor Theodore Roosevelt, the manly ideal in politics included readiness for war. Indeed, Roosevelt viewed war as a crucible that forged one’s manhood and strengthened the nation. As he privately noted, “I should welcome almost any war, for this country needs one.” In May 1897, he told Naval Academy graduates that “the minute that a race loses its hard fighting virtues … it has lost its proud right to stand as the equal of the best…. Cowardice in a race, as in an individual, is the unpardonable sin.”[18]\n\nIn 1892, imperialists gained valuable political leadership when the Republican Party adopted overseas expansionism as part of its campaign platform, euphemistically described as “the achievement of the manifest destiny of the Republic in its broadest sense.”[19] Two years earlier, the party had lost its majority in the House of Representatives, dropping 85 seats. The party’s standard campaign tactic of “waving the bloody shirt” – identifying the Republican Party as the party of unity and patriotism, and the Democratic Party as the party of secession and treason – had run its course. Republican leaders sought to revive their political fortunes in part by rallying Americans to the cause of overseas expansion. Such efforts were interwoven with a rising tide of nationalism in the 1890s, including the formation of patriotic societies, flag rituals, and Americanization programs for new immigrants. The strategy appears to have worked, as the party added 45 seats in the House in 1892, and 111 in 1894, giving it a solid majority in Congress in the last years of the 19th century.\n\nThe great debate over American empire\n\nAmericans generally supported the expansion of U.S. trade and influence in the world, but not all were prepared to follow in the footsteps of Old World empires in acquiring colonies. Although the U.S. had expanded across the North American continent, this “settler colonialism” diverged from formal imperialism by the fact that the “settlers” forced indigenous peoples to move to reservations – a kind of ethnic cleansing of the land.[20] Becoming a formal imperial power along European lines would mean ruling over other peoples without their consent, thus rekindling the original contradiction of the Declaration of Independence, which was to proclaim “all men are created equal” while denying citizenship rights to African Americans and Native Americans.\n\nNumerous opponents of imperialism viewed the quest for empire as contrary to the American ideals of freedom and democracy, “a flagrant violation of fundamental principles upon which the government of the United States was based,” in the words of the historian E. Berkeley Tompkins. “They emphasized that the United States had stood as the champion of liberty, democracy, equality, and self-government throughout the world and that imperialism, by its very nature, was a denial of the universal validity of these tenets.”[21]\n\nSenator George Hoar, speaking in Worcester, Massachusetts, on November 1, 1898, warned that becoming an imperialist power would transform the United States “from a republic founded on the Declaration of Independence … the hope of the poor, the refuge of the oppressed – into a vulgar, commonplace empire founded upon physical force, controlling subject races and vassal states, in which inevitably one class must forever rule and other classes must forever obey.”[22] Anti-imperialists also opposed empire building on practical grounds, asserting that its presumed benefits were overstated and its costs were significantly understated. Acquiring overseas possessions, they argued, would involve the U.S. in foreign wars, entangle the U.S. in European affairs, divert attention from domestic reforms, and foster large standing armies, high taxes, military secrecy, press censorship, and excessive executive power.\n\nRacism cut both ways in the debate over empire. It was a foundational assumption among expansionists, as control over “lesser races” was deemed necessary and proper. It was also part of the anti-imperialist lexicon, evident in debates over the annexation of the Dominican Republic, the Hawaiian Islands, and the Philippines, when anti-imperialists decried attempts to incorporate “alien races” into the United States. One of the most outspoken opponents of imperialism, Carl Schurz, former U.S. senator from Missouri and chief editorial writer for Harper’s Weekly, believed that “tropical people” were a poor fit for assimilation into the U.S. as they “had nothing in common with Americans.”[23] Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor declared that the federation had worked for years to exclude “Orientals” from the United States and that the proposed annexation of Hawaii would “obliterate the beneficent legislation [Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882] and threaten an inundation of Mongolians to overwhelm the free laborers of our county.”[24] Such fears were later quelled by the Supreme Court, which ruled in the Insular Cases of 1901 that the U.S. could rule over unincorporated territories, such as the Philippines and Puerto Rico, without granting citizenship rights to their inhabitants. The legal structure for administering colonial possessions was thus secured.\n\nThe debate over empire intensified in the wake of an American takeover of Hawaii in January 1893. With the aid of the U.S. minister to Hawaii, John Stevens, and U.S. Marines from a nearby cruiser, a group of prominent American landowners known as the “missionary boys” ousted the hereditary ruler, Queen Lili’uokalani. No blood was shed, as the queen chose to avoid violence by temporarily stepping down; she placed her hopes for reinstatement in an appeal to Washington. Stevens immediately extended U.S. recognition to the new government and declared Hawaii to be a protectorate of the United States. The takeover created a storm of controversy in Washington.\n\nIncoming Democratic President Grover Cleveland was hesitant to approve the request for annexation. The queen had been a friend of the U.S. and Stevens had no authorization to depose her. Cleveland ordered an investigation headed by James H. Blount. After months of taking testimony from both sides, Blount surprised observers by concluding: (1) Americans in Hawaii had acted wrongly in deposing Queen Lili’uokalani; (2) the American minister to Hawaii, John Stevens, had acted without authorization in ordering American troops to back the coup; and (3) the queen should be reinstated to her throne. American leaders in Hawaii, however, ignored President Cleveland’s request to step down and instead declared Hawaii to be an independent republic. Anti-imperialists in Congress prevented Lodge and company from annexing the islands until the War of 1898, when possession of the islands was deemed necessary for U.S. naval operations in the Philippines and Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe U.S. quest for Cuba\n\nTurning to Cuba, American policymakers had long been fascinated with the island, a Spanish colony since the days of Columbus. In 1823, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams compared Cuba to a ripe apple that, once severed from Spain, would inevitably “gravitate only towards the North American Union.”[25] In 1848, the Polk administration tried to buy the island for $100 million. Six years later, the Pierce administration raised the purchase offer to $130 million, with no more success. Yet U.S. leaders could live with Spanish control over the island. What they could not accept was the transfer of Cuba to another imperial power or, most tellingly, Cuban independence, as either would jeopardize U.S. plans for eventual annexation. As Louis Pérez notes, “Only the possibility of transfer of Cuba to a potentially hostile foreign country seemed to trouble the United States more than the prospect of Cuban independence. Cuba was far too important to be turned over to the Cubans.”[26]\n\nThe long-running desire among U.S. leaders to acquire Cuba was underpinned by the racist-tinged belief that Cubans were incapable of self-government and that any attempt by the mixed population to run their own affairs would end in anarchy, insurrection, and a race war. Hence, a “capable” nation such as the U.S. should be in charge. That view continued to guide U.S. policy as Cuba erupted in a War for Independence in 1895. Neither President Grover Cleveland (1893-97) nor President William McKinley (1897-1901) believed that Cubans were fit for self-government. Countering popular American support for Cuba Libre, Cleveland’s Secretary of State, Richard Olney, wrote to the Spanish ambassador to the U.S., Enrique Depuy de Lôme, on April 4, 1896, expressing his “gravest apprehension” that “once Spain were withdrawn from the island, the sole bond of union between the different factions of the insurgents would disappear” and “a war of the races would be precipitated.”[27]\n\nBoth the Cleveland and McKinley administrations were concerned with the protection of private American investments and property holdings in Cuba. The latter had increased dramatically in recent decades, with sugar plantations and mining interests passing from Spanish and Cuban hands to American ownership. Trade had also shifted toward the U.S. By 1894, nearly 90% of Cuban exports went to the United States, as compared to only 6% to Spain.[28] President McKinley cited the disruption of trade and the protection of private American interests in Cuba as reasons for U.S. military intervention in Cuba.\n\nThe question of whether or not the U.S. should militarily intervene in Cuba did not break down according to imperialist and anti-imperialist orientations. Some individuals in each group supported intervention and others did not. Among expansionists, Theodore Roosevelt was most eager for war with Spain – and the spoils of war. Much of the U.S. business community, however, was inclined to use diplomatic pressure and economic leverage to achieve expansionist goals. Among anti-imperialists, relatively few called for U.S. military intervention in Cuba initially. What they wanted, in line with Cuban rebel leaders, was official U.S. recognition of the Cuban belligerency (and thus the provisional rebel government), which in turn would allow Americans to legally transfer arms and aid to the rebels. In the run-up to the War of 1898, the distinction between imperialists and anti-imperialists became blurred, as both groups insisted that the Spanish must leave Cuba. Their differences became clear after the Spanish departed: the imperialists sought greater control over Cuba, while the anti-imperialists supported a free and independent government in Cuba.\n\nIII. The Cuban War for Independence\n\nCuba, ninety miles from the U.S. mainland, erupted in revolution against Spanish rule in February 1895. The origins of this revolution began decades earlier in the Ten Years War (1868-1878). In the Pact of Zanjón that ended that war, Spain promised greater autonomy, including Cuban representation in Madrid, greater freedom of the press and assembly, and a timetable for the abolition of slavery. The latter was achieved in 1886, but not all Cubans were satisfied with the limited reforms. The revolutionary poet, José Martí, who had spent several decades in exile, demanded complete independence. Martí organized the Cuban Revolutionary Party in 1892. He raised money from Cuban émigrés in the U.S. and elsewhere, and recruited generals Máximo Gómez and Antonio Maceo to lead the military initiative. Gómez and Maceo were well known leaders of the earlier revolution. Gómez was born in the Dominican Republic and served in the Spanish military before joining the first Cuban insurgency in 1868. Maceo, a mulatto known as the “Bronze Titan,” was capable of attracting former slaves to the cause. Martí envisioned not only political independence from Spain, but also a social and economic transformation that would redistribute property and create economic opportunity for the masses. Such ideas attracted poor farmers and workers, and worried elite planters, some of whom appealed to the U.S. for annexation.\n\nMartí, having lived in New York for many years, was well aware of America’s expansionist history and wanted no U.S. troops on Cuban soil, fearing that the U.S. would take advantage. Martí and his fellow revolutionaries hoped for a quick victory, but the war turned into a long, protracted guerrilla struggle. Martí himself clandestinely returned to Cuba in April 1895 to join the fight. He was killed by Spanish troops at the battle of Dos Ríos on May 19.\n\nThe day before, Martí wrote a letter to his friend, Manuel Mercado, reiterating his belief that the United States posed a danger to the Cuban Revolution: “I am in daily danger of giving my life for my country and duty, for I understand that duty and have the courage to carry it out – the duty of preventing the United States from spreading through the Antilles as Cuba gains its independence, and from overpowering with that additional strength our lands of America. All I have done so far, and all I will do, is for this purpose.” The Cuban people, he added, must “block with our blood … the annexation of the peoples of America to the turbulent and brutal North that despises them … I lived in the monster and know its entrails – and my sling is that of David.”[29] Martí is celebrated in Cuba today as the founding father of the country.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis\n\nThe Cuban independence movement (Ejército Libertador de Cuba) was launched in the remote village of Baire, on the eastern end of the island, on February 24, 1895. The Spanish government was not concerned at first, as antigovernment agitation was common in this underdeveloped region. By the end of the year, however, the revolution had spread across the island, reaching the lucrative sugar plantations in the middle and western provinces. The Spanish government responded with force. Between 1895 and 1898, according to the historian John Lawrence Tone, “Spain transported more than 190,000 men to the island, the largest army ever assembled up to that time to fight a colonial war overseas.” The Cuban Liberation Army, on the other hand, recruited no more than 40,000 troops, and “rarely had more than a few thousand men under arms at any given moment.” This five-to-one Spanish advantage was augmented by “60,000 Cubans who served on the Spanish side in various auxiliary capacities.”\n\nThis substantial Spanish military advantage was offset by the rebels’ strategy of avoiding pitched battles, for the most part, and engaging in economic warfare, which included destroying property and preventing food from reaching Spanish-held cities. Spanish forces were spread thin in an effort to protect outlying plantations and small towns, thus leaving them vulnerable to attack. The first major battle took place on May 13, 1895, when Antonio Maceo and 2,400 men attacked a Spanish column of 400 infantry and 100 cavalry near the town of Jobito in the eastern province of Santiago de Cuba. Although the Cubans suffered heavy losses, they emerged victorious. Their victory, in turn, inspired hundreds more to join the rebellion.[30]\n\nThe rebel strategy of economic warfare under Máximo Gómez was merciless in its application. Gómez “banned farmers from transporting and selling food, livestock, tobacco, and other basic commodities in Spanish-controlled territories, which in July 1895 still included most of Cuba,” writes Tone. Those who disobeyed his command were to be treated as traitors. Martí, before his untimely death, expressed misgivings about Gomez’s harsh strategy. “Martí had argued for preserving the property of sympathetic planters, partly so that the insurgents could tax them, but also to avoid utterly alienating people whom the emerging republic would need in the coming years. Martí had also wanted to avoid the widespread suffering that would surely follow the wholesale destruction of the economy, and he worried that a scorched-earth strategy would alienate public opinion overseas.” After Martí’s death, some civilian politicians in the revolutionary government similarly called for a more lenient policy toward the civilian population; and some military commanders, including Maceo, evaded Gómez’s policies, which infuriated the commanding general. Gómez responded with an order on October 4, 1895, declaring that any Cuban who worked for the Spanish in any capacity would “be judged in a summary verbal trial followed by immediate execution of the sentence.” Cuban civilians, as such, were forced to choose between living in rebel-held communities and Spanish-held towns. In either case, survival was not assured.[31]\n\nThe influx of impoverished civilians, mainly women and children, into Spanish-held towns and cities placed a burden on Spanish authorities, as Gómez expected. Captain-General Arsenio Martínez-Campos recognized his “unavoidable duty” to provide relief despite a dearth of resources at hand. He appropriated land for cultivation near garrisoned towns and asked his officers and soldiers to donate their labor and a portion of their wages to help the refugees. Few did so, however, as they were short of food and money themselves. Many were also sick. Indeed, Spanish soldiers suffered greatly in the tropical climate of Cuba. “Fewer than 4,000 Spanish soldiers died in combat with the insurgents,” notes Tone, whereas, “41,288 Spanish servicemen died from dysentery, malaria, pneumonia, typhus, yellow fever, and other diseases in Cuba. Put another way, disease killed 22 percent of the military personnel sent to Cuba, accounting for 93 percent of Spanish fatalities.” Cuban insurrectos fighting in the bush also succumbed to disease in large numbers. Tone estimates that “nearly 30 percent perished from illnesses.” Unaware that certain mosquitoes were carriers of malaria and yellow fever, little was done to protect soldiers and civilians from summer infestations.[32]\n\nIntent on routing the rebels, the Spanish government in Madrid made a fateful decision to put its resources into winning the war rather than relieving the growing humanitarian crisis. Instead of sending food and resources, Madrid sent Captain-General Valeriano Weyler to replace Martínez-Campos and institute the policy of “reconcentration.” Less than five feet tall, Weyler was a veteran of Spanish counterinsurgency campaigns in the Dominican Republic and the Philippines. As captain general of the Philippines from 1888 to 1891, he had instituted a reconcentration policy designed to isolate the civilian population from guerrillas. Madrid approved a similar policy for Cuba prior to Weyler’s arrival in Havana on February 2, 1896. Weyler issued his first reconcentration order on February 16, which applied only to the eastern provinces. On October 21, he imposed the policy on the western province of Pinar del Rio; and in January 1897, on the provinces of Havana, Mantanzas, and Santa Clara.\n\nThe strategy mirrored the rebel strategy of laying waste to the countryside in order to deprive the enemy of food and support, except that the Spanish were more thorough in applying it. Spanish soldiers rounded up and relocated civilians, destroyed their livestock and property, took families of known insurgents hostage, and shot rebel captives. The civilian refugees arrived in Spanish-held towns with little more than the clothes on their backs and many soon died of disease or starvation. In the Santa Clara province, located in the middle of Cuba, which became the front line of the war in 1897, 140,000 people were relocated, of which 53,000 died, or 38 percent.[33]\n\nThe tragic results of the reconcentration policy had been foreseen by the previous captain-general, who refused to implement it. On July 25, 1895, Martínez-Campos wrote a letter to the leader of the Spanish Conservative Party, Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, humbly declaring, “I cannot, as the representative of a civilized nation, be the first to give the example of cruelty and intransigence…. I could reconcentrate families from the countryside to the towns” but this would result in “horrible misery and hunger.” Weyler was aware of the consequences of his reconcentration policy, but he viewed the expected civilian deaths as acceptable collateral damage in the quest for victory. In all, the Cuban War of Independence took the lives of an estimated 170,000 persons, some ten percent of the population.[34]\n\nThe destitute and starving women and children in Spanish-held towns made front-page news in the United States. The stories were sensationalized, to be sure, but the “yellow press” could hardly exaggerate the extent of the calamity that had befallen Cuba. Weyler became the personification of evil: “a brute, the devastator of haciendas, the destroyer of families, and the outrager of women,” as presented by the New York Journal.[35] Weyler himself contributed to this negative impression by instituting a news blackout from the Spanish side, thereby leaving U.S. reporters to obtain their news from Cuban rebel leaders, who abundantly supplied it. Horatio Rubens, Tomas Estrada Palma, and other representatives of the provisional Cuban government held regular briefings in New York City, where they reported imagined rebel victories and real Spanish atrocities. Some American journalists, such as Grover Flint and George Bronson Rea, accompanied Cuban military leaders Máximo Gómez, Antonio Maceo, or Calixto García in the field, smuggling war stories past Spanish censorship.[36]\n\nThe main storyline, however, was the humanitarian crisis. American photographers captured the images of emaciated Cubans for American audiences at home, eliciting disbelief, indignation, and calls for U.S. intervention. Two newspaper titans, William Randolph Hearst of the New York Journal and Joseph Pulitzer of the New York World, exploited developments in Cuba to increase the circulation of their papers. The “yellow press,” as these sensationalizing newspapers were called, portrayed the Cuban people as a desperate woman in need of a dashing hero: Uncle Sam. If the U.S. failed to rescue the damsel in distress, this would reflect badly upon the nation’s manly honor.\n\nPresident Grover Cleveland, however, was disinclined to intervene in Cuba, particularly on behalf of Cuba Libre. He issued a proclamation of neutrality on June 12, 1895, and furthermore enforced U.S. neutrality laws that prohibited the transfer of private aid to Cuban insurgents, a policy that indirectly aided Spain. President William McKinley, inaugurated on March 4, 1897, similarly enforced neutrality laws, capturing private American ships on their way to Cuba loaded with arms and aid to the rebels. According to Pérez, “Both the Cleveland and McKinley administrations acted vigorously against Cuban efforts to support and supply the insurgency from the United States…. Between 1895 and 1896 U.S. authorities intercepted over half of the Cuban expeditions fitted in the United States. Of the seventy expeditions organized from the United States during the Cuban insurrection, only one-third reached the island.”[37]\n\nPrelude to U.S. military intervention in Cuba\n\nGeneral Weyler’s harsh strategy achieved a measure of military success between the spring of 1896 and the fall of 1897. Spanish troops expelled the rebels from the western provinces and killed Maceo and Máximo Gómez’s son, Poncho, on December 17, 1896. In April 1897 Gómez wrote to the new American president, William McKinley, and asked for assistance, although not for U.S. troops. He needed ammunition and food in order to sustain his soldiers and the revolution. McKinley offered no assistance. Instead he put more pressure on the Spanish government to bring the war to a conclusion.\n\nU.S. minister to Spain Stewart L. Woodford met with Spanish officials on September 18, 1897, and gave Madrid until November 1 to re-establish peace on the island, implying that the U.S. would take over if Spain failed. On October 4, a new Liberal government came to power in Madrid and immediately took steps to appease the U.S. The Spanish government ended the brutal reconcentration policy, replaced General Weyler, and devised a new autonomy plan for Cuba set to take effect on January 1, 1898. Spanish forces soon began pulling back to the cities, allowing the beleaguered rebel forces to regain strength and retain control over the eastern provinces. In January 1898, Gómez predicted, “This war cannot last more than a year. This is the first time I have ever put a limit it to it.”[38]\n\nThe rebel leadership, intent on complete independence, vociferously rejected the Spanish autonomy plan. Although McKinley was aware that the rebels opposed the plan, having been informed by Estrada Palma, he endorsed it anyway, as he deemed it the better alternative to recognizing the provisional rebel government. In his annual message to Congress on December 6, 1897, McKinley acknowledged that many Americans were supportive of Cuban independence and that both houses of Congress had voted for resolutions “justifying the recognition of a state of belligerency in Cuba,” but he nonetheless rejected recognition of the rebel government on the grounds that the Cuban rebels did not have the “essential qualifications” to govern their own country.[39] That same month, McKinley ordered American warships to the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea for naval maneuvers. The president was preparing for war, although not for the purpose of Cuba Libre.\n\nMadrid’s autonomy plan was also rejected by conservative Spanish officers in Cuba. They viewed it as a step toward independence, a back-handed and back-stabbing policy that negated their heroic efforts to preserve the Spanish empire. On January 12, 1898, some of these officers led a mob that destroyed three pro-autonomy newspapers in Havana, amid shouts of “Down with Autonomy” and “Viva Weyler.” The U.S. Consul in Havana, Fitzhugh Lee, cabled Washington to send a U.S. warship in case such disorders threatened American interests on the island. The U.S.S. Maine arrived in the Havana harbor on January 25. On February 15, at approximately 9:40 pm, the U.S.S. Maine suddenly exploded and sank, taking the lives of 266 sailors and officers. Theodore Roosevelt, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, immediately blamed Spain, as did the Hearst and Pulitzer newspapers in New York. The Madrid government denied responsibility. In Havana, Spanish soldiers provided aid to the wounded Americans. President McKinley convened a naval court of inquiry to investigate the cause of the explosion.\n\nSix weeks later, on March 28, the court reported its findings: the explosion had been caused by an external submerged mine, implying Spanish responsibility. This determination was reached, it should be noted, in spite of the fact that between 1895 and 1898, thirteen other American ships had fires associated with internal spontaneous combustion in coal bunkers. In 1977, a U.S. naval commission reopened the investigation and reversed the earlier judgment, declaring that the explosion was, “without a doubt,” internal.[40]\n\nYet the damage was done. Senator George Hoar of Massachusetts complained, “Every congressman has two or three newspapers in his district, most of them printed in red ink, shouting for blood.”[41] Earlier Spanish efforts to appease the U.S. were forgotten as saber-rattling jingoists shouted, “Remember the Maine, to hell with Spain!” Antagonism toward the Spanish government was furthermore stoked by the publication of a letter, written by Spanish ambassador Enrique Dupuy de Lôme, that had been captured by Cuban rebels and given to the New York Herald. The Hearst paper published the letter on February 9 under the headline, “Worst Insult to the United States in its History.” In this personal letter to a friend, de Lôme had criticized President McKinley as “weak and catering to the rabble … a low politician,” insinuating that McKinley was playing to the militant patriots known as “jingoes” for votes. Spain immediately issued an apology and de Lôme resigned. McKinley did not make much of the letter, but the American public seized on it as another example of Spanish perfidy.\n\nPresident McKinley was moving in the direction of war but not fast enough for Theodore Roosevelt, who famously quipped that McKinley “had no more backbone than a chocolate éclair.” The pro-intervention press also goaded McKinley by questioning his manhood. An editorial in the Atlanta Constitution declared that the nation needed a “man” to run the White House. Representative William Sulzer of New York wrote, “If a man like [Andrew] Jackson were at the helm of the ship of state there would be no more delay, nor more hesitation, no more apologies.”[42] Roosevelt not only openly clamored for war, but as Assistant Secretary of the Navy he also prepared for war in February 1898 by cabling the head of the American Asiatic Squadron, Commodore George Dewey, and instructing him to move his fleet from Hong Kong to Manila Bay. Hence, when war was declared against Spain in April, the first battle was fought in the Philippines rather than in Cuba.\n\nAlthough many of the nation’s most influential newspapers demanded war with Spain following the sinking of the Maine, a significant minority dissented. The latter argued that war with Spain would exact a heavy toll in terms of lives lost and treasure expended, and that the U.S. would reap few rewards in the end. The Boston Herald warned, “To enlist the flower of our youth to go to Cuba would be to send it to destruction.”[43] Some editors predicted a long war, overestimating the competency of Spanish forces and underestimating the capability of the rebels to aid U.S. forces. Business journals warned that a war with Spain would damage the nation’s economy and drain the government’s financial reserves. In a study of thirty-three U.S. newspapers, the historian Piero Gleijeses found that eight “advocated war or measures that would lead to war before the Maine blew up; twelve joined the pro-war ranks in the wake of the explosion; thirteen strongly opposed the war until hostilities began.”[44] In short, forty percent of newspapers in this sampling remained opposed to war until the war actually started.\n\nWhile waiting for the results of the Maine investigation, President McKinley sent Senator Redfield Proctor, Republican of Vermont, to assess the situation in Cuba. Proctor returned convinced that U.S. intervention was necessary. On March 17, 1898, after meeting with the president, he addressed Congress:\n\nI went to Cuba with a strong conviction that the picture had been overdrawn. I could not believe that out of a population of one million six hundred thousand, two hundred thousand had died within these Spanish forts…My inquiries were entirely outside of sensational sources…What I saw I cannot tell so that others can see it. It must be seen with one’s own eyes to be realized…To me the strongest appeal is not the barbarity practiced by Weyler, nor the loss of the Maine…but the spectacle of a million and a half people, the entire native population of Cuba, struggling for freedom and deliverance from the worst misgovernment of which I ever had knowledge.[45]\n\nProctor thus highlighted the cause of Cuba Libre as the first and foremost reason for U.S. intervention in Cuba. Previous to this, both the Democratic and Republican parties had expressed support for Cuban independence but without calling for U.S. military intervention. The Republican Party platform, adopted in June 1896, stated, “We watch with deep and abiding interest the heroic battle of the Cuban patriots against cruelty and oppression, and our best hopes go out for the full success of their determined contest for liberty… we believe that the Government of the United States should actively use its influence and good offices to restore peace and give independence to the island.” The Democratic Party platform, adopted in July 1896, similarly stated, “We extend our sympathy to the people of Cuba in their heroic struggle for liberty and independence.”[46]\n\nYet support for Cuba Libre was not the motive that impelled the McKinley administration to action. The president aligned with public sentiment against Spain but refused to recognize or support the Cuban provisional government and Cuban independence. McKinley deceived senators and congressmen on this account, telling them that he was negotiating for the independence of Cuba, while searching for ways to avoid this option and exert U.S. control. One way was to buy the island from Spain. On March 17, the same day that Senator Proctor gave his heartfelt speech on behalf of Cuban liberation, U.S. Ambassador to Spain Woodford wrote a letter to McKinley advocating that the U.S. purchase the island:\n\nI am thus, reluctantly, slowly, but entirely a convert to the early American ownership and occupation of the Island. If we recognize independence, we may turn the Island over to part of its inhabitants against the judgment of many of its most educated and wealthy residents…. If we have war we must finally occupy and ultimately own the Island. If today we could purchase [Cuba] at a reasonable price we should avoid the horrors and the expense of war.[47]\n\nThe following day, Woodford advanced an offer through a third party to buy Cuba, arguing that the island would soon be lost to the revolutionaries if Spain did not sell it to the U.S. now. He told the Spanish colonial minister, Segismundo Moret, “Some way must be found by which Spain can part with Cuba without loss of self-respect and with certainty of American control.”[48] As with previous U.S. proposals to buy Cuba, the Spanish government did not accept it. Three weeks later, the U.S. State Department recommended its next best choice for exerting U.S. control over Cuba: “neutral intervention.” A department memorandum on April 7 stated, “It would make a notable difference in our conduct of hostilities in Cuba if we were to operate in territory transiently ours by conquest, instead of operating in the territory of a recognized sovereign with whom we maintain alliance.”[49]\n\nThe U.S. would gain the right to control Cuba if Spain surrendered to the U.S. rather than to the rebels.\n\nIn plain language, the U.S. would obtain the right to control Cuba if Spain surrendered to the U.S. rather than to the revolutionaries; and as long as the U.S. did not officially recognize the rebels or their provisional government, the rebels could be left out of the bargain. This, then, became the McKinley administration’s plan.\n\nOn April 11, 1898, President McKinley presented his war message to Congress. He highlighted as the main reasons for war American economic interests in Cuba and the humanitarian crisis. He avoided commentary on the ultimate political disposition of Cuba, voicing neither support for Cuban independence nor acknowledging any intention to exert U.S. control over the island, except to establish “a stable government, capable of maintaining order.”[50]\n\nAmerican supporters of Cuba Libre were not pleased with McKinley’s speech. “The President’s Cuban Message Disappointing to Those Who Want Cuba Freed,” ran a New York Times headline on April 12. An editorial in the Washington Post that same day called attention to the president’s duplicity in regard to Cuban independence: “Whatever else might have been in the President’s mind, it was supposed that the ultimate aim of his policy was the freeing of Cuba, but the message gave no corroboration of this fact. On the contrary, independence was not mentioned except for the purpose of arguing that it ought not to be recognized.” Senator Marion Butler, a Populist from North Carolina, summed up McKinley’s message succinctly: “If I can understand the message it means that the President is opposed to Cuban independence now and forever.” According to the historian Philip Foner, “Congress was besieged with telegrams urging immediate recognition of the island’s independence…. Many Congressmen were also infuriated because in his review of Administration policy, McKinley revealed that at no time had the government asked Spain for Cuban independence. Yet the President had previously led Congress to believe that negotiations had failed over this question.”[51]\n\nAdvocates of Cuba Libre in Congress introduced resolutions in both houses of Congress calling for immediate recognition of Cuban independence. Speaking for the resolution in the House, Representative Hugh Dinsmore, Democrat of Arkansas, said, “We talk about liberty. Then let us give the Cubans liberty. We talk about freedom. Let us give to them the right to establish a government which they think will be a free government, and which does not reserve to us, the Government of the United States, the right to say, after it is established, ‘Ah, this is not a “stable” government; we cannot turn it over to you yet; we must look after this thing.’” With McKinley’s Republican supporters in the majority, however, the resolution was voted down 190 to 154. A similar resolution in the Senate, the Turpie Amendment, was defeated by a vote of 51 to 37 on April 16. Speaking on behalf of the latter amendment, Senator John W. Daniel, Democrat of Virginia, charged that the administration had chosen to intervene at this time, not because of the humanitarian crisis, but because it wanted to prevent the Cuban revolutionary forces from establishing an independent republic.\n\nThis argument has since been taken up by a number of historians, including Louis Pérez and Philip Foner. As Foner writes, “The war to liberate Cuba was thus a war to prevent its independence, eliminate Spain from Cuba and the Philippines, and open the door for the economic and political domination of both islands by the United States.”[52]\n\nWith the American public and many senators still favoring Cuba Libre, Congress approved a compromise measure known as the Teller Amendment. Senator Henry Teller, Republican of Colorado, had formerly advocated U.S. annexation of Cuba but changed his mind as he watched the Cuban Revolution unfold. His amendment stated that the U.S. “hereby disclaims any disposition of intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said island except for pacification thereof, and asserts its determination, when that is accomplished, to leave the government and control of the island to its people.” The last line seemed to many an ironclad guarantee of independence, but it was predicated on the successful “pacification” of Cuba as judged by Washington. McKinley had previously indicated his intention to veto any joint resolution recognizing Cuban independence, but the Teller Amendment was vague enough to allow for multiple interpretations, and so he accepted it. As Pérez writes:\n\nThe McKinley administration had vigorously opposed any recognition of Cuban independence but in the end understood the necessity of yielding to congressional demands. Acquiescence to the Teller Amendment, however, did not signal acceptance of the proposition of Cuban independence. On the contrary, the administration never wavered in its determination to resist, restrict, or otherwise reduce the possibility of Cuban independence …”[53]\n\nWith the Teller Amendment attached, Congress passed McKinley’s war resolution by votes of 42 to 35 in the Senate and 311 to 6 in the House. The president signed the bill on April 20, and the U.S. officially declared war against Spain on April 25. The Cuban provisional government along with General Máximo Gómez accepted the Teller Amendment as an adequate statement of support for Cuban independence. Hence, the Cuban leadership promised the McKinley administration full cooperation in the war effort. Oddly, both the Cuban rebels and American expansionists would later regret the Teller Amendment, the former because the U.S. equivocated on its promise of independence; the latter because the amendment interfered with their plans for U.S. dominion over Cuba. Soon after the vote, Senator Albert Beveridge bemoaned that the amendment had been passed “in a moment of impulsive but mistaken generosity.” He predicted correctly that “it would not be kept.”[54]\n\nFor many American citizens, the Teller Amendment assured them that the war would be fought for a just cause – to end Spanish tyranny and establish Cuban independence. According to Pérez:\n\nThe United States entered into war amid great excitement. It was a popular war, it has been affirmed often. That the public imagination could persuade itself that the call to arms represented a summons to deliver an oppressed New World people from the clutches of an Old World tyranny served to consecrate the virtue of the U.S. purpose. Off to war Americans went in defense of Cuba Libre, they believed, a lofty and selfless undertaking, in a spirit of exalted purposefulness, confident in their mission of liberation.[55]\n\nIV. The War of 1898\n\nThe War of 1898 was a short war. U.S. soldiers first arrived on Cuban soil on June 10. By the end of the month, some 18,000 regular and volunteer troops had come ashore at points along the southeastern coast of Cuba, all without a shot being fired. Battles were subsequently fought in the San Juan Heights on June 24 and July 1. The latter included the famous charge of Col. Theodore Roosevelt and his “Rough Riders” up Kettle Hill (near San Juan Hill). U.S. and Cuban forces then initiated a siege of Santiago de Cuba, the main city in the eastern province. The siege was aided on July 3 by U.S. naval forces, which sunk six Spanish warships in the Santiago harbor and made it impossible for the Spanish to reinforce or resupply their troops by sea. Cuban troops, meanwhile, prevented resupply by land. U.S. warships also blockaded Havana and other major ports, cutting off support from Spain. On July 16, the Spanish surrendered the city of Santiago de Cuba. Ten days later, seeing no possibility for victory, Madrid requested a suspension of all hostilities. On August 12, U.S. and Spanish officials signed an armistice, with no Cuban representatives present. This omission of Cuban representatives was repeated in the Paris peace negotiations that took place during the fall, allowing the U.S. to claim the rights of conquest – an ancient tradition of war.[56]\n\nOn July 27, 1898, one day after Madrid requested a suspension of hostilities, the U.S. ambassador to Great Britain, John Hay, wrote to Theodore Roosevelt, exulting, “it has been a splendid little war, begun with the highest motives, carried on with magnificent intelligence and spirit, favored by that fortune which favors the brave.”[57] From the American perspective, the brave soldiers who won this war were not the Cubans but the Americans. The role of the Cuban rebels was downplayed by the U.S. military command, the press, and administration officials – a necessary tactic if the U.S. was to assume the rights of conquest. This narrow American perspective was later written into U.S. historical accounts, such that the war was named “the Spanish American War,” as if the Cuban rebels had nothing to do with it.\n\nThe Cuban rebels played a decisive if largely unacknowledged role in the War of 1898. During the previous three years, they had effectively weakened Spanish resistance. Their guerrilla tactics had disrupted transportation and communication lines and driven Spanish units into garrisoned cities and forts, where soldiers suffered from illness and starvation. The U.S. decision to land troops on the southeastern coast reflected the fact that Cuban troops controlled the region outside the main cities. Under the leadership of General Demetrio Castillo Duany, Cuban troops secured the landing site at Daiquirí, east of Santiago de Cuba, allowing General William Shafter’s forces to land unopposed. Cubans subsequently offered their services as scouts, guides, and interpreters. They made two key contributions to battle victories in the San Juan Heights, bottling up a large Spanish garrison at Guantánamo and delaying a Spanish relief column, which arrived two days after the last battle.\n\nIt was nonetheless true that many American soldiers who volunteered for the fight did so out of noble motives. Carl Sandburg, later a famous poet, joined the Sixth Infantry Regiment of Illinois. Many years later he reflected, “I read about the … people of Cuba who wanted independence…. I was going along with millions of other Americans who were about ready for a war to throw the Spanish government out of Cuba and let the people of Cuba have their republic.” Many others felt similarly that they were acting “in the cause of humanity to expel the Spanish from Cuba.”[58]\n\nA remarkable shift occurred in American public attitudes during and after this brief war. By December 10, 1898, when the Treaty of Paris was signed, the cause of Cuba Libre had been almost entirely eclipsed by imperial concerns, in keeping with the McKinley administration’s view of the situation. An editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer on August 6, 1898, presaged the change in thinking:\n\nIt is true that the Congressional resolutions [Teller Amendment] … set forth that we, as a nation had no designs upon Cuba, and that our sole object was to free it. But these resolutions went further. They also declared it to be our intention to see to it that a stable government should be formed.[59]\n\nThe mandate to create a “stable government” became a euphemism for demanding that Cuban leaders comply with American demands. Those demands had yet to be laid out precisely in August 1898, but they generally concerned establishing a government in Cuba amenable to U.S. economic interests, securing U.S. control over Cuban foreign policy, permitting a U.S. naval base on the island, and making sure that the “right” people – propertied white Cubans – were in charge of the Cuban government. Unbeknown to the Cuban rebels at the outset of the war, such demands would be forced on them afterward, under the threat of permanent American occupation. On August 12, 1898, the editors of the New York Times speculated on what might happen if Cubans were unwilling or unable to form a “stable government”:\n\nThe pledge we made [in the Teller Amendment] by no means binds us to withdraw at once, nor does full and faithful compliance with its spirit and letter forbid us to become permanent possessors of Cuba if the Cubans prove to be altogether incapable of self-government. A higher obligation than the pledge of the resolution of Congress would then constrain us to continue our government over the island.[60]\n\nThe idea of conqueror’s rights was reinforced by U.S. military operations on the ground. Any town, city, or region secured by American soldiers, even with the aid of Cuban rebels, was placed under U.S. jurisdiction. In the aftermath of the joint Cuban and American campaign in the province of Santiago de Cuba, for example, Major General William Shafter declared on August 11, “The soil occupied by the army of the United States was part of the Union and would remain so until the Union through its proper offices should declare otherwise.” General Shafter furthermore banned Cuban soldiers from entering the city of Santiago, informing General Calixto Garcia, “This war is between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Spain.”[61]\n\nA “splendid little war” in Cuba?\n\nThe historian John Lawrence Tone, in War and Genocide in Cuba, 1895-1898 (2006), headlined his chapter on the U.S. military intervention in Cuba, “The Splendid Disaster.” Certainly, the war was a disaster for the Spanish, who were already in a starving condition, wracked by disease, and at their weakest in the far eastern province of Santiago de Cuba. For the Cuban Liberation Army, the results were unpalatable, to say the least, as the United States took charge and compromised Cuban independence in the aftermath of the war.\n\nFor the United States, the war was almost a disaster, in marked contrast to Secretary of State Hay’s comment. The main enemy was disease. Within weeks of their arrival, thousands of U.S. soldiers were laid low or struck down by yellow fever, malaria, typhoid, and dysentery. General Shafter contemplated withdrawal if the war could not be quickly won. “I estimated that the troops would have immunity for two or three weeks,” he reflected, “and to be successful with my force it was to be a dash or nothing.” Of the 2,446 U.S. personnel who died in the war, only 385 were killed in action, while 2,061 died from disease and other causes.[62]\n\nThe medical crisis in Cuba was exacerbated by the “inexperience, incompetence, and inefficiency” of U.S. Army operations, according to Louis Pérez. “Chronic shortages of almost everything, including the most essential military equipment, medical supplies, clothing, and food, beset the swollen ranks of the army.” Theodore Roosevelt, who served as lieutenant colonel in the First Cavalry Regiment, cabled to Washington on July 3, “we must have help – thousands of men, batteries and food and ammunition.” Although U.S. troops had taken the San Juan Heights only two days earlier, Roosevelt despaired, “We are within measurable distance of a terrible military disaster.” On July 7, he wrote again to Washington, “The mismanagement has been beyond belief. The lack of transportation, food and artillery has brought us to the very verge of disaster.” According to the American military historian Graham A. Cosmas, “The War Department had neither the time nor the planning agency to work out in detail the strategy of the campaign, to study the terrain of the area, and to determine the transportation requirements of an army that was to fight under those [tropical] conditions.”[63] General Shafter, weighing over 300 pounds, suffered from heat exhaustion during battles and had to be carried from place to place on a makeshift wooden litter.[64]\n\nThe Spanish surrendered just in time. “On July 6,” writes Pérez, “only three days after General Shafter commenced negotiations with the Spanish command for the surrender of Santiago de Cuba, the dreaded quarantine flag was raised ominously behind U.S. lines: yellow fever had struck. The longer the Spanish army command refused to surrender, the greater the likelihood that a yellow fever epidemic would ravage U.S. military forces.” The Spanish, however, were also in bad shape. “Conditions behind Spanish lines in Santiago de Cuba were at least as desperate as they were behind U.S. lines,” notes Pérez. “Spanish troops also lacked adequate medicine and food supplies and were simultaneously wracked by sickness and disease.” Spanish General Arsenio Linares wrote to Madrid: “The defenders are not just beginning a campaign, full of enthusiasm and energy; they have been fighting for three years with the climate, privations and fatigue; and now that the most critical time has arrived their courage and physical strength are exhausted, and there are no means for building them up again.” Another Spanish officer, Captain Victor M. Concas y Palau, acknowledged the role of the Cuban rebels in wearing down the Spanish:\n\nDespite the unwillingness of the Americans to acknowledge the aid received from the insurrectos, in fact, this assistance was so decisive that without the Cubans they would not have achieved their objectives in so short a period of time. In effect, on the very day of their landing, Santiago de Cuba was cut off from all supplies it received from the countryside, producing widespread hunger; all communications were cut off; forests, roads, and foothills: all were covered by Cubans, and even the west coast of the harbor itself was unsafe, as the American army was relieved of this arduous service.[65]\n\nThe rebel contribution to the Spanish defeat was not obvious to American officers and soldiers. This was partly due to U.S. policy and partly to circumstances. General García offered to place his troops under U.S. command, but General Shafter declined, lest this be interpreted as official U.S. recognition of the Cuban Liberation Army. Shafter rather hoped that the Cuban soldiers would serve as “porters, orderlies, messengers, and day laborers, working behind U.S. lines,” according to Pérez. García refused, protesting, “My men are soldiers, not laborers.” Shafter’s army fought the major battles in the San Juan Heights without immediate assistance of Cuban rebels. Their absence convinced many Americans that the Cubans were not serious about their struggle for independence. A New York Times war correspondent reported, “The Cubans did little or no fighting. The insurgent army, therefore, has borne no testimony to its desire for a free Cuba.”[66]\n\nYet the quick American victory in Cuba owed much to the Cuban rebels, particularly General García’s 3,000 men in the eastern province of Santiago de Cuba. On May 1, 1898, U.S. Army Lieutenant Andrew Rowan met with General García in the town of Bayamo to seek his guidance and cooperation with regard to the impending American invasion. The rebels subsequently secured the beaches prior to the American landing, the point at which American troops were most vulnerable. At the Spanish base at Guantánamo, General Antonio Pareja and 7,000 Spanish soldiers awaited orders to fight, but the orders never came. The rebels had captured couriers and cut off communication by land, while American warships had cut the underwater telegraph cables in Guantánamo Bay.\n\nThe Spanish command in Havana attempted to reinforce its troops in the region by sending a relief column of nearly 3,500 soldiers under Colonel Federico Escario. The soldiers “departed Manzanillo on June 22,” writes Tone, “but it took the column thirteen days to make the 200-mile trip. Escario’s bedraggled troops arrived in Santiago on July 3, too late to make any difference and lacking the necessary supplies to provide any relief.” The Cuban insurgents “harassed the Spanish the whole way, forcing them to halt and form up for defense on several occasions…. Escario lost twenty men killed and seventy wounded on the march.”[67] The rebels were nevertheless unable to prevent Escario’s forces from entering Santiago de Cuba, and this “sent Shafter into a rage,” according to Tone:\n\nHaving heard for years about epic battles won by the Cubans, Americans expressed astonishment when they saw that the insurgents did not fight well in a regular war of fixed positions. Experts at ambush and harassing actions, the Cubans had no experience with large-scale siege operations or battles…. The Americans behaved as if the easy entry of Escario into Santiago were an indictment of Cuban honor and courage.[68]\n\nMisunderstandings between American and Cuban troops existed on a number of levels. Differences in language, of course, made communication difficult. Many Americans were repelled by the very look of the rebels, a large number of whom were black or mixed race and all of whom were ragged, hungry, and weary. These were the revolutionaries that the U.S. press had hailed as liberators in the mold of the American Patriots of 1776 but who now appeared more like the black and mulatto Haitian revolutionaries a generation later (which the Jefferson administration shunned). Theodore Roosevelt recalled that the Cuban rebels were “almost all blacks and mulattos and were clothed in rags. I think that 80 percent of them are the worst specimens of humanity I ever saw.”\n\nThe Cubans, for their part, resented American haughtiness. They viewed the Americans as their guests, not their saviors and certainly not their conquerors. Cuban resentment, in turn, was interpreted by Americans as ingratitude. “Do they admire us?” asked Thomas R. Dawley, correspondent for Harper’s Weekly. “You would expect them to be filled with gratitude towards us who are about to redress their wrongs. But that is not so.” Other reporters were similarly struck by the “sour and sullen” attitude of the rebels. One reporter described the Cubans as “vain and jealous,” and another, as “conceited.”[69] Such prejudicial views of Cubans were conveyed to the American public amidst reports of great American victories and heroic tales of battle.\n\nAmong the 15,000 U.S. soldiers who participated in the battles of San Juan Heights were 2,000 African Americans, organized into four black regiments. They fought not only to defeat the Spanish but also to prove their equality to white soldiers. Their courage on the battlefield won them twenty-six Certificates of Merit along with praise from white military officers and news reporters; yet even more praise was heaped on their white officers. According to the historian Willard B. Gatewood, Jr.:\n\nNotwithstanding their praise of the black regiments, few white Americans were willing to grant the one concession most desired by Negro soldiers – the opportunity to become commissioned officers in their own regiments. Even those whites so generous in their praise of the role played by black troops in Cuba almost without exception credited their performance to the discipline and leadership provided by their white officers. The persistence of the idea that Negroes made good soldiers only if commanded by white officers was a source of profound frustration for men who had gone to Cuba with high hopes of winning respect and honor for their race. Black veterans of the Santiago campaign were quick to point out that they were without white “commissioned officers half of the time” and performed efficiently under the command of their own black noncommissioned officers.[70]\n\nImperial American attitudes combined with misunderstandings and racial prejudices reinforced the notion that Cubans were incapable of creating a “stable government” on their own. This had been the view of President McKinley all along, but it now saturated the press and public opinion. “The scale of public opinion in the United States turned against the Cubans,” writes Pérez. “In press dispatches and army field reports, Cubans were portrayed as unworthy allies, undeserving of the sacrifices made on their behalf, whereupon it became easy to disparage, dismiss, or deny altogether their contribution in the final months of their war for independence.”[71]\n\nAmerican political control over Cuba began with the Spanish surrender of Santiago on July 17. General Shafter would not allow General García to be present at the surrender; nor would he allow rebel troops to enter the city, claiming that they would rob and murder residents. Adding insult to injury, Shafter retained Spanish officials to administer the city. García resigned his commission in protest, saying, “I will never accept that our country be considered as a conquered territory.”\n\nThe U.S. press marched in step with this usurpation of governing power by the United States. The New York Times editorialized on July 19 that the “sacrifices of treasure and life that we have made clearly entitle us to fix the conditions under which” a new government will be formed.[72]\n\nAftermath of war: U.S. occupation of Cuba and the Platt Amendment\n\nIn the Treaty of Paris signed on December 10, 1898, the United States acquired Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam, all presumably legitimated by the presence of U.S. troops on these islands at the end of the fighting. The Teller Amendment circumscribed historic U.S. ambitions to take possession of Cuba, but it did not rule out some measure of control and domination. Secretary of War Elihu Root initially believed this could best be accomplished by establishing a Cuban government run by “conservative and thoughtful” elites rather than the “ignorant and incompetent” masses. The white, propertied, business class in Cuba would presumably protect private American economic interests on the island and follow Washington’s lead.[73] On April 18, 1900, General Leonard Wood, head of the U.S. military government in Cuba, issued an order setting the date for municipal elections on June 16. The order called for “Scrutinizing Centers” to be set up to establish voter eligibility before the election. According to Louis Pérez:\n\nAll voters were required to be Cuban males over the age of twenty and in possession of one of the following: real or personal property worth $250, or an ability to read and write, or honorable service in the Liberation Army. All Cuban women and two-thirds of all adult Cuban men were excluded from the franchise. Suffrage restrictions reduced the Cuban electorate to 105,000 males, approximately 5 percent of the total population.[74]\n\nDespite the narrow electorate, the results of the election proved disappointing to American leaders, as a majority of the newly elected Cuban officials were independentistas, committed to independence and thus likely to challenge U.S. prerogatives. General Wood lamented, “The men whom I had hoped to see take leadership have been forced into the background … the class to whom we must look for the stable government in Cuba are not as yet sufficiently well represented to give us that security and confidence we desire.” Secretary of War Root went back to the drawing board and formulated a new plan, one that would enable the U.S. to exert a “restraining influence” on Cuba “for many years to come, even if it does not eventually become necessary for this government to take direct and absolute control of Cuban affairs.”[75]\n\nIn January 1901, Root proposed to Secretary of State John Hay that a set of provisions be imposed on Cuba that would secure U.S. interests for the indefinite future. These provisions included the right of the United States to (1) militarily intervene in Cuban affairs; (2) prevent Cuba from entering “into any treaty or engagement with any foreign power” of which the U.S. disapproved; (3) acquire Cuban lands and naval stations; and (4) continue the laws and policies enacted by the existing military government in Cuba. These provisions were subsequently incorporated into the Platt Amendment, named after its sponsor, Senator Orville Platt of Connecticut, and attached to the Army Appropriations Act. In Platt’s view, these impositions would assure “a stable republican government” that would maintain domestic order and enhance U.S. security in the region. “We cannot tolerate a condition in which life and property shall be insecure,” he said. Congress approved the Platt Amendment in February 1901, adding provisions that restricted the Cuban government’s ability to take on debt. Article VIII of the amendment stipulated that its tenets be incorporated into the new Cuban constitution.[76]\n\nNews of the Platt Amendment requirements sparked anti-U.S. demonstrations across Cuba. Root deemed Cubans ungrateful. “If they continue to exhibit ingratitude and entire lack of appreciation of the expenditure of blood and treasure of the United States to secure their freedom from Spain, the public sentiment of this country will be more unfavorable to them,” he said. The McKinley administration applied pressure by declaring that U.S. troops would continue to occupy Cuba until the amendment was incorporated into the new Cuban constitution. In early June 1901, after much acrimonious debate, the Cuban constitutional convention accepted the Platt Amendment by a margin of one vote, attaching it to the constitution as an appendix.[77]\n\nThe U.S. military occupation of Cuba came to an end on May 20, 1902, but U.S. influence did not. The Platt Amendment helped to secure new and old private American investments in Cuba. “By 1905,” writes Pérez, “some 13,000 North Americans had acquired title to land in Cuba, and these purchases had passed over the $50 million mark. An estimated 60 percent of all rural property in Cuba was owned by individuals and corporations from the United States, with another 15 percent controlled by resident Spaniards. Cubans were reduced to ownership of 25 percent of the land.” Americans also dominated the sugar and tobacco industries and owned most of the iron mines in the eastern provinces.[78] Labor and political unrest on the island led U.S. military forces to occupy Cuba from 1906 to 1909, and again in the eastern province from 1917 to 1923. In 1934, after three decades of resentment, the U.S. repealed most of the provisions in the Platt Amendment (in keeping with President Franklin Roosevelt’s announcement of a Good Neighbor Policy toward Latin America), but kept the naval base at Guantánamo. U.S. economic interests continued to dominate the island until the Cuban Revolution of 1959.\n\nV. The spoils of war and the Treaty of Paris debate\n\nThe war of 1898 offered a unique opportunity for America’s empire builders to acquire overseas territories. Having grudgingly accepted the Teller Amendment with respect to Cuba, President McKinley moved decisively to obtain control over other territories. In December 1897, he urged Congress to approve the annexation of Hawaii, declaring that “we need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California. It is Manifest Destiny.”[79] With the deep water port at Honolulu needed for the war in the Philippines, Congress approved the annexation in mid-1898.\n\nOn May 10, two weeks after war was declared against Spain, the McKinley administration issued orders to Captain Henry Glass, commander of the U.S.S. Charleston, to capture Guam on the way to Manila Bay. On June 20, Spanish authorities surrendered the island, allowing the U.S. to claim it in the Treaty of Paris.\n\nOn May 12, a squadron of twelve U.S. warships commanded by Rear Admiral William T. Sampson bombarded Spanish fortifications in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Due to rough seas, many of the projectiles struck the city, destroying homes and a 16th century church, as civilians fled in terror. The U.S. then blockaded the San Juan harbor and on July 25, General Nelson A. Miles and 3,300 U.S. soldiers landed at Guánica and took over the island. Like Guam, Puerto Rico was formally transferred to the U.S. in the Treaty of Paris.\n\nIn the Philippines, after establishing U.S. naval supremacy in Manila harbor, the first U.S. troops arrived on June 1, 1898. Eleven days later, Filipino rebel leader Emilio Aguinaldo issued the Philippine Declaration of Independence, modeled after the U.S. declaration, and established a provisional government. On October 28, however, President McKinley instructed U.S. negotiators in Paris to insist “upon the cession of the whole of the Philippines,” thus denying Filipinos the right to independent government. In the Treaty of Paris, the United States obtained full sovereignty over the archipelago and its eight million inhabitants, to the bitter disappointment of the Filipino freedom fighters (see Section VI).\n\nSuch were the imperial achievements of the United States during the War of 1898. Yet American claims on Spanish territories still had to be validated, as two-thirds approval of the Senate was required for ratification of the Treaty of Paris. This then became the focus of the debate over imperialism in the fall and winter of 1898-99. Imperialists held to the assumed rights of conquest while anti-imperialists held to the idea that the Philippines as well as Cuba should have their independence. Of course, imperialists such as Lodge and Roosevelt did not describe themselves as such. “Advocates of annexation of the Philippines,” writes Jim Zwick, “called themselves ‘expansionists,’ not ‘imperialists,’ and they derided their opponents for being satisfied with ‘little America’ while they sought a ‘greater America.’”[80]\n\nThe debate proved frustrating to anti-imperialists, as President McKinley refused to acknowledge that the U.S. was engaged in imperialism or that his administration harbored any imperial intentions. He claimed that the responsibilities of empire had been thrust upon the nation by “the hand of almighty God” and “destiny,” suddenly and without fault or malicious intent on the part of the United States. It was thus the nation’s “duty” to “establish liberty and justice and good government in our new possessions.” To many Americans, the responsibilities of empire did seem to arrive without warning, as the spirit of Cuba Libre had prevailed before the war and President McKinley had not revealed his plans for its aftermath.\n\nIn mid-October 1898, McKinley toured the Midwest on the campaign trail, asking each audience, “Shall we deny ourselves what the rest of the world so freely and so justly accords to us?” The audience would typically roar back, “No!” McKinley would then respond, “Now then we will do our duty.”[81] In Chariton, Iowa, he told an audience, “Territory sometimes comes to us when we go to war in a holy cause, and whenever it does the banner of liberty will float over it and bring, I trust, blessings and benefits to all people.” Theodore Roosevelt, running for governor of New York, presented a similar message before adoring audiences: “The guns of our warships have awakened us to new duties. We are face to face with our destiny, and we must meet it with a high and resolute courage.”[82]\n\nAnti-imperialist organizing was well underway by this time. The first meeting of what would become the national Anti-Imperialist League took place in Boston on June 15, 1898, three days after Aguinaldo declared Philippine independence. The leaders of the group were among the most prominent and educated New Englanders, including four university presidents and a dozen leading scholars. The first president was George S. Boutwell, age 80, former Massachusetts governor, senator and representative, and U.S. Treasury secretary under President Ulysses S. Grant. Among the numerous vice-presidents of the League were steel titan Andrew Carnegie, former president Grover Cleveland, labor leader Samuel Gompers, former Senator Carl Schurz, and the African American religious leader, the Reverend William H. Scott of Boston. During the summer and fall months, organizers formed chapters in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, and other cities. They arranged speaking events, produced and distributed leaflets, issued press releases, recruited members, and initiated a mass petition campaign against extending U.S. sovereignty over the Philippines. By February 1899, the executive committee estimated its national membership to be “considerably over 25,000.”[83]\n\nThe founding document of the Anti-Imperialist League, “Address to the People of the United States,” published on November 19, 1898, laid out three major arguments in opposition to imperialism: first, the United States is founded on the principle that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed and that this principle must be applied in foreign affairs as well as in domestic institutions; second, the U.S. Constitution contains no provision for holding colonies and creating a subject class of citizens; and third, those who fought “the heroic struggles for liberty of the people in the Spanish islands” should not be deprived of independence and rights.[84] The issue of imperialism was not just about foreign policy; it was about national identity and the very character of the nation. For some anti-imperialists, notably Samuel Gompers and Senator “Pitchfork Ben” Tillman of South Carolina, opposition to the annexation of the Philippines was based on racial exclusion. The Anti-Imperialist League as a whole, however, took a more principled stance, insisting that “all men, of whatever race or color, are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”[85]\n\nRudyard Kipling’s poem, “The White Man’s Burden: The United States and the Philippine Islands,” published in the February 1899 issue of McClure’s magazine, elicited a strong, negative reaction in the African American community. Kipling described the “white man’s burden” as a duty of the Anglo-Saxon race to control and civilize non-white “sullen peoples, half-devil and half-child.” A black correspondent from the Savannah Tribune denounced the poem as “an imperialistic cry” to “oppress weaker races and rob them of the rights and liberties God has given them.” Calvin Chase of the Washington Bee pointed out that the real burden fell on colored people “encumbered by the prejudice” of whites. Although African Americans were generally sympathetic to the plight of non-white races, many were hesitant to take a position against imperialism, lest they be deemed unpatriotic. Among those who did take a stand, not all were enthused with the Anti-Imperialist League, given its inclusion of prominent racists. In 1899 black Democrats led by William T. Scott organized the multi-issue National Negro Anti-Expansion, Anti-Imperialist, Anti-Trust and Anti-Lynching League. “The black Democrats,” Willard Gatewood writes, “maintained that if Negro citizens were willing to support the Republican party in its suppression of liberty ‘in our so-called possessions,’ then they had little justification in complaining ‘of the same thing being done in any part of our own land.’” Prominent intellectuals such as W. E. B. DuBois similarly connected the struggle against imperialism to the fight against segregation in the United States.[86]\n\nThe fact that the imperialist agenda was tied to the peace treaty complicated matters for the anti-imperialists. William Jennings Bryan, former House member from Nebraska and Democratic Party presidential aspirant, declared himself an anti-imperialist but decided to support the treaty, arguing that rejection of it would leave the U.S. at war with Spain and that another treaty granting Filipino independence could be enacted later. Most Democrats rejected these contentions, as there was no possibility of renewed warfare with Spain, and many thought it better to amend the treaty than to give the imperialists a free hand under it. Senator George Vest of Missouri introduced a resolution aimed at preventing the federal government from acquiring any “territory to be held and governed permanently as colonies.” He argued that “the colonial system” was incompatible with the American democratic system “because it uproots and eliminates the basis of all republican institutions.”[87] Other resolutions of a similar nature followed, introduced by Augustus Bacon of Georgia, William Sullivan of Mississippi, William Lindsay of Kentucky, William Allen of Nebraska, William Mason of Illinois, and George Hoar of Massachusetts. Senator Bacon’s resolution mimicked the Teller Amendment in declaring that “when a stable and independent government shall have been duly erected,” the U.S. would “leave the government and control "
