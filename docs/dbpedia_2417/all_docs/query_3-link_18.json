        "text": "Martin Fiebig (7 May 1891 – 23 October 1947) was a German general of Luftwaffe, serving during World War II. He was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (German language: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.\n\nEarly life and World War I[]\n\nMartin Fiebig was born on 7 May 1891 in Rösnitz, Upper Silesia. He served in World War I, and was promoted to Oberleutnant on 18 June 1915. From August 1914 to 1915, he served in the 18th Infantry Regiment. Sometime during 1915, he was transferred from the infantry to become a pilot. From 1915 to 1 August 1918, he was a pilot and Squadron-Leader in the 3rd Bomber Wing.\n\nWorld War II[]\n\nHe commanded Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4 or Bomber Wing 4) in the Battle of the Netherlands, but was shot down and captured by the Dutch on the 10 May 1940, during the initial attack on Rotterdam-Waalhaven airfield. Fiebig commanded the attack of II./KG 4 leading his Stabsschwarm and was one of the two first planes shot after dropping its marker bombs. Most of the first squadron that followed the Colonel's bomber were shot down too by Dutch fighters and AAA. Colonel Fiebig was lucky to escape being expedited by the Dutch to the UK, a fate that around 1,250 of his fellow Luftwaffe and army comrades in captivity couldn't escape.\n\nHe later commanded the wing in the Battle of Belgium, the Battle of France, and the Battle of Britain. In 1941 he took part of the German invasion of Yugoslavia and subsequent Bombing of Belgrade. During Battle of Stalingrad, he was commander of the VIII Fliegerkrops in the Stalingrad sector.\n\nFiebig was executed in Belgrade for war crimes.\n\nAwards[]\n\nIron Cross (1914) 2nd and 1st Class\n\nClasp to the Iron Cross (1939)\n\n2nd Class (18 September 1939)[1]\n\n1st class (3 May 1940)[1]\n\nKnight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves\n\nKnight's Cross on 8 May 1940 as Oberst and commander of KG 4 \"General Wever\"\n\n168th Oak Leaves on 23 December 1942 as Generalleutnant and commanding general of the VIII.
