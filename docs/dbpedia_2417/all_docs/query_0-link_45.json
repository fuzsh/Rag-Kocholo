        "text": "Charles Bennett Deane was an alumnus of Wake Forest College (1923), a lawyer from Rockingham, North Carolina, and U.S. Congressional representative.

Deane in Ansonville Township, Anson County, North Carolina. At an early age, Deane moved with his family to the Pee Dee Mill Village in Rockingham, Richmond County, North Carolina His early education was at the Pee Dee Academy in Rockingham, and as a youth he worked in the Pee Dee (Textile) Mill. As a teen Deane left his hometown of Rockingham to attend Trinity Park School in Durham, N.C. He graduated from Trinity Park School in 1920 and he then enrolled at Wake Forest College. Deane earned an LL.B law degree (1923), after which he returned to his hometown and worked at Farmer's Bank and Trust until 1926. On October 15, 1927, Deane married Agnes Walker Cree, also from Rockingham, N.C.\n\nDeane began his lifelong role as a devoted politician in 1926. He served in a variety of county, state, and federal government roles, including Register of Deeds for Richmond County, N.C. (1926-1934), U.S. Congressional Directory compiler (1935-1939), Richmond County Democratic Executive Committee chair (1932-1946), Attorney for the US Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division (1938-1939), and U.S. Congressman, 8th Congressional District serving as a member of the Appropriations Committee for National Defense (1946-1957).\n\nIn addition to Deane's political involvement, he was also a devoted community and church leader. He served as Trustee of Wake Forest College (awarded Omicron Delta Kappa National Leadership Honor Society 1951), Board of Trustees chair of Meredith College, Board of Deacons chair for his First Baptist Church (Rockingham, N.C)., and Director of American Red Cross (Rockingham Chapter). Deane also served as Recording Secretary for the N.C. Baptist State Convention of North Carolina for 25 years).\n\nAs a U.S. Congressman, Deane's refusal to sign the Southern Manifesto against school desegregation (1955) cost Deane his seat in Congress. Deane felt strongly that \"racial segregation was unchristian.\" He died on November 25, 1969.\n\nCollection Overview\n\nHis papers contain his Baptist files, 1938-1958; Congressional papers, 1948-1957; Meredith college trustee files, 1947-1958; personal papers, 1865, 1918-1923 and 1938-1970; speech files, 1931-1964; and his Wake Forest College/Wake Forest University files, 1929-1969.\n\nCollection Inventory\n\nBiography\n\nBiographical Information box 1 folder 1\n\nBaptist Papers\n\nCorrespondence\n\nAdams-Ayscue box 1 folder 2\n\nBates-Branch folder 3\n\nBrantley-Butler folder 4\n\nCalvary Baptist Church-Crouch folder 5\n\nDailey-Duncan folder 6\n\nEdwards and Broughton-Everhart folder 7\n\nFerguson-Fox folder 8\n\nGaddy-Grant folder 9\n\nGreene-Guenther folder 10\n\nHand-Hornback folder 11\n\nHuggins-Hyler folder 12\n\nJackson-Jones folder 13\n\nKelley-Knight folder 14\n\nLaney-Lucas folder 15\n\nMcCall-Mixon folder 16\n\nMoore-Myers folder 17\n\nNapier-Noffsinger folder 18\n\nOldham-Owens folder 19\n\nParker-Pruitt folder 20\n\nReaves-Russell folder 21\n\nScarborough-Sullivan folder 22\n\nTeague-Turner folder 23\n\nUpchurch, Ernest-Upchurch, Percy folder 24\n\nValentine-Vipperman folder 25\n\nWagoner-Wood folder 26\n\nYates-Yow folder 27\n\nSubject Files\n\nNorth Carolina Baptist Hospital\n\nFederal Aid for Extension folder 28\n\nFederal Aid for Extension folder 29\n\nGeneral Correspondence folder 30\n\nMiscellaneous folder 31\n\nNew Wing.
