        "text": "How North East tech businesses develop new products and processes, then bring them to commercial fruition, was the main topic of discussion at a recent Insider Media North East Roundtable. We heard from a group of tech business leaders who are making huge strides in this hugely competitive and fast-moving sector. We also learned how they were managing the funding landscape, how they dealt with IP issues, and some of the opportunities they were exploiting that will see them grow in 2024 and beyond. What is clear is that there is a highly motivated, supremely skilled and expert eco-system of tech businesses in the North East that is making the region a hub for collaboration and creative excellence, one which is fast gaining commercial clout and permeating way beyond the boundaries of the North East. A report of the Roundtable can be read in the link below. The Roundtable was sponsored by Invest Newcastle Maven Capital Partners Ryecroft Glenton and Square One Law and was held at The North East Technology Park - NETPark - which is home to a number of superb tech businesses - in the ORBIT Innovation Space of Durham University. Thanks to all who took part for making excellent contributions to this stimulating and thought-provoking event.

Not only is it the second largest metro area in the UK, it’s also the number one regional tech cluster: more than 65,000 people are employed in tech roles at 12,500 businesses. In fact, more software developers, programmers and software architects are based in Birmingham than anywhere else in the nation. Birmingham is also home to corporate giants such as Jaguar, Cadbury and Unliver, yet 89% of the companies in the region are micro-businesses with fewer than ten employees. In 2023, Birmingham startups raised $1.7 billion in capital, after raising $190 million in 2022 and $420 million in 2021. Here’s a look at six of the hottest tech companies in the region: https://lnkd.in/ga9-EqHs Companies featured (in no particular order): Orlo | Grid Edge | 3DVieweronline | Graide | Dynamic Mobile Billing and Conigital Group\n\nHigh-growth companies: what do you need to unleash your full potential?
