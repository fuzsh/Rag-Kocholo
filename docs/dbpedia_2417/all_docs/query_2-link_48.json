        "text": "The Sister Study (3) recruited a cohort of 50,884 women (2003–2009), each of whom had at least one sister who was diagnosed with breast cancer. Participants provided written informed consent and the study was overseen by the Institutional Review Board of the NIH (Bethesda, MD). This analysis uses a case–cohort sample of 6,008 women, including 2,808 incident cases and a randomly selected subcohort of 3,200 women (of whom 222 developed breast cancer during follow-up), through September 2017, data release 7.1. Of the 6,008 women, 5,926 women remained after excluding women with all iron measures missing (n = 56), uncertain event status (n = 9), follow-up time <1 month (n = 14), or unknown event timing (n = 3).\n\nCases were identified as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive incident breast cancer. Tumor hormone status was based on medical records and self-report, in that order of availability (4).\n\nWe used R (5) software with the survival package (6) to fit Cox models with age as the primary time scale to estimate breast cancer HRs for serum iron biomarkers, using the Prentice case–cohort method (7). Iron variables were analyzed as both continuous and divided into quartiles in separate models. We adjusted for baseline smoking, alcohol, education, hormone replacement therapy, age at menarche, age at first birth, oral contraceptive use, body mass index (BMI), menopause status, and a product term between the last two variables. This product term allowed the association with BMI to change after menopause.\n\nSensitivity and/or post hoc analyses included: (i) restricting the analyses to the first 4 years of follow-up, as more proximate to the baseline iron measures; (ii) restricting by excluding the first 2 years of follow-up, to avoid iron sequestration responses to early carcinogenesis; (iii) estimating breast cancer HRs for particularly low values of ferritin or high values of transferrin saturation, often used as cut-off points for iron deficiency or overload, respectively; (iv) assessing etiologic heterogeneity related to iron levels for invasive versus DCIS, tumor subtypes, and stage, based on case-only logistic analyses; (v) stratifying Cox models based on race/ethnicity and BMI; and (iv) stratifying on pre- and postmenopausal status.\n\nSample characteristics are shown in Table 1. Cases were more educated and less likely to have experienced early menopause than noncases.\n\nTable 1.\n\n. . Case–cohort . Variable . Total . Subcohort (no cases) . Cases .

The post hoc analyses (Supplementary Tables S1–S8) largely aligned with the primary findings. Case-only analyses did not provide evidence for an association between higher iron levels and cancer subtype or stage (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). However, analyses by BMI subgroups suggested overall decreased risk for the lowest quartile compared with others (Supplementary Table S2). If we compare the lowest with the grouped top three quartiles, the adjusted HRs (95% CI) were 0.72 (0.56–0.92) for iron and 0.84 (0.66–1.09) for ferritin among women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 (Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, stratified analyses for the premenopausal group indicated decreased risk for those with low iron stores (Supplementary Table S4). Comparing the lowest quartile with the top three quartiles, the adjusted HRs (95% CI) were 0.70 (0.51–0.97) for iron, 0.73 (0.54–0.99) for ferritin, 0.71 (0.52–0.96) for transferrin saturation, and 0.64 (0.47–0.88) for the first PC (Supplementary Table S4). Iron stores tend to increase postmenopausally, but there was also evidence for protection for those who still had low ferritin postmenopausally (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6)."
