        "text": "Though the characters of sangtarash/but-tarash are purely fictional\n\nthere are many things which are common in both the movies .\n\nIn Shahjehan we find a but-tarash coming all the way from Iran\n\nShirazi ( Jairaj )and in the ensuing competition for Roohi ( Nasreen )\n\nhe creates a mujassima of Roohi . Unfortunately it was turned down since\n\nit was un-islamic . The poet Sohail ( KL Saigal ) wins but in a strange\n\nbid to save the life of Roohi being hit by an arrow he himself gets\n\nkilled .\n\nMeanwhile not withstanding the defeat Shirazi presents a\n\nminiature model of Tajmahal and wins both the hearts of Shahjehan and\n\nRoohi . Shirazi and Roohi get married .\n\nShahjehan had also a role\n\nsimilar to Suraiya in M-e-A . 2 songs were picturised on her singing\n\nwith rabab in hand with Azurie dancing .\n\n1.jab usne gesoo bikhraye and\n\n2.jawani ke daman ko rangeen banale ( both in Shamshad's voice )\n\nIMO Naushad scored an excellent music in both the movies .\n\nI would give a 5 star rating and add one more if there is a provision .\n\nWas K ASif inspired by his senior AR Kardar ?\n\n- kp\n\n--\n\nPosted via Mailgate.ORG Server - http://www.Mailgate.ORG\n\n\n\nInteresting parallels no doubt. But there are significant\n\ndifferences. Shirazi is one of the two principal\n\nmale characters in \"ShahjahaaN\", whereas M. Kumar has only\n\na peripheral role in \"M-e-A\", as the \"saNg~taraash\".\n\nJairaj in \"ShahjahaaN\" was more of an architect, than a\n\nmere sculptor. Even Saigal \"builds\" a paradise on earth :\n\n\"Kar leejiye chal kar meri jannat ke nazaare..\"\n\nThe two songs mentioned by you were filmed on Bengali\n\nactress Salochana Chatterjee, who (even then) was a bit\n\non the plus side. She acted in many Hindi movies e.g.\n\n\"Paras\", where she was Rehman's lady-love. I also\n\nremember her in \"Baazuband\", where she was the erring\n\nBalraj Sahni's long-suffering wife.\n\nI would definitely give Naushad's music a much higher\n\nrating in \"ShahjahaaN\". Somehow I have always felt that\n\nthe music in \"M-e-A\" was not of the standard one expected\n\nfrom a music genius like Naushad.\n\nAfzal\n\nIn article <B-ydnZVn1rV...@comcast.com>, Satish...@comcast.net says...\n\n\n\nI'm with you this far.\n\nand even Sohni\n\n>Mahiwal.\n\n>Satish Kalra\n\nWhat?

But for most 1940s films, film titles are used as\n\nsource of information when it comes to mentioning assistants\n\nwhenever it was possible for him and his team to have access\n\nto a film's print.
