        "text": "Anmol Ghadi - 1946\n\nAnmol Ghadi (1946) a social movie directed by Mehboob Khan confirmed the fame of the director. The film was a musical hit and was the highest grossing film of the year 1946. The subject was purely romantic and provided much space for music which was exploited to greater length by the renowned musician Naushad.\n\nMehboob Khan had three biggest singing stars of India viz. Noorjehan, Suraiya and Surendra Nath. Noorjehan, also known by the name Malika-e-Tarannum (the queen of melody), rendered some of the best songs of the film. Awaz De Kahan Hai, Mere Bachpan Ke Saathi, and Jawan Hai Mohabbat Haseen Hai Zamana were some of them."
