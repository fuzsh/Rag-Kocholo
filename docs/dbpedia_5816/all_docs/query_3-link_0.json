Twins Priceless moment) is a 1946 Indian drama film directed by Mehboob Khan, starring Surendra, Suraiya, Noor Jehan and Zahur Raja.\n\nThe film was a musical hit and is still remembered for its music by Naushad, with hits like \"Aawaaz De Kahaan Hai\", \"Jawaan Hai Mohabbat Haseen Hai Zamana\" and \"Mere Bachpan Ke Saathi Mujhe Bhool Na Jaana\". The film also featured playback singer, Mohammed Rafi's first notable song, \"Tera Khilauna Toota Balak\",[2] and became the highest-grossing film at the Indian box office in 1946.[1]\n\nThe film was an inspiration for the 2001 Telugu movie Manasantha Nuvve. The Telugu movie was remade in Hindi as Jeena Sirf Merre Liye (2002), in Kannada as Manasella Neene (2002), in Tamil as Thithikudhe (2003), in Bengali as Moner Majhe Tumi (2003) and in Odia as Nei Jaa Re Megha Mate (2008).\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nChander and Lata were good childhood friends in Jahanabad, Lata was the daughter of a rich family, whereas Chander was the son of a poor, widowed mother. Lata's parents did not like Lata being friends with Chander. Lata's family gets transferred to Bombay. At the time of departure, Lata gifts her watch to Chander as a memento.\n\nThey grow up. Chander goes to Bombay to search for Lata. Chander's rich friend Prakash opens a musical instruments shop for Chander, where Chander can earn his livelihood by repairing musical instruments. Prakash's mother does not like Prakash spending money on Chander. Lata has become a writer, her work is published under the nickname of \"Renu\" aka \"Renuka Devi\"; Chander becomes a fan of her work. Basanti is Lata's friend. In one of her novels, Lata writes the story of the Childhood friendship of Chander and Lata. Chander reads it and writes a letter to Renu (Lata) to find out how she knows of this story and if she knows Lata she can help him find her. Reading that letter, Basanti forces Lata to call Chander to meet, plotting that Basanti will meet Chander as well as Lata. Basanti meets Chander there and falls in love with him. Chander was carrying the watch gifted by Lata to him all the time, which he loses when Basanti meets him and Basanti locates it. Seeing the watch, Lata recognizes it and recognizes Chander. Basanti feels hurt and blames Lata that she had known that Basanti was in love with Chander, and even then Lata did not tell her that Chander is the same guy who Lata herself was in love with. Lata later tells her that she herself was not aware of it.\n\nLata's parents contact Prakash for marrying Lata. When Chander learns of it, under the lifetime of obligations to Prakash, he sacrifices his love for Lata in favour of Prakash. Chander's mother dies. Prakash marries Lata; Chander walks off into the sunset, followed by Basanti.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nCast in order of the opening credits\n\nNoorjehan as Lata/Renuka Devi[2][3]\n\nSurendra as Chandrabhan[2]\n\nZahur Raja as Prakash[2]\n\nSuraiya as Basanti\n\nLeela Misra as Chandrabhan's mother[2]\n\nAnwari Begum\n\nBhudo Advani as Mohan\n\nMurad as Deputy[2]\n\nBibibai\n\nAmirbanu as Prakash's mother\n\nN.
