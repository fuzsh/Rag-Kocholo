JAWAN HAIN MOHABBAT HASIN HAI ZAMANA - Noor Jehan - Lyrics: Tanvir\n\nNaqvi\n\n02. AWAZ DE KAHAN HAI - Noor Jehan & Surendra - Lyrics: Tanvir Naqvi\n\n03. MERE BACHPAN KE SAATHI - Noor Jehan - Lyrics: Tanvir Naqvi\n\n04. KYUN YAAD AA RAHE HAIN - Surendra - Lyrics: Tanvir Naqvi\n\n05. AAJA MERI BARBAD MOHABBAT KE SAHARE - Noor Jehan - Lyrics: Tanvir\n\nNaqvi\n\n06. SOCHA THA KYA, KYA HO GAYA - Suraiya - Lyrics: Tanvir Naqvi\n\n07.

Rafi - Lyrics: Tanvir Naqvi\n\nANOKHI ADA [1948] - Music: Naushad ::\n\n01. BHOOLNE WALE YAAD NA AA - Mukesh - Lyrics: Shakeel Badayuni\n\n02. DIL KO LAGA KE HUM NE - Umadevi - Lyrics: Shakeel Badayuni\n\n03. JALE NA KYUN PARWANA - Surendra - Lyrics: Anjum Pilibhiti\n\n04. NAZAR MIL GAYEE - Shamshad Begum - Lyrics: Shakeel Badayuni\n\n05. BHOOL GAYE KYON - Mukesh & Shamshad Begum - Lyrics: Shakeel\n\nBadayuni\n\n06. KYON UNHE DIL DIYA - Surendra & Shamshad Begum - Lyrics: Shakeel\n\nBadayuni\n\n07.

MANZIL KI DHUM MEIN - Mukesh - Lyrics: Shakeel Badayuni\n\nSo, which is the 13th song of Anmol Ghadi?\n\nPleasant Times!\n\nKizzy\n\nm***@yahoo.com\n\nANOKHI ADA\n\n===========\n\nThe CD is missing two items:, which were released on LP and also\n\non a 78 rpm record\n\nTitle Music\n\nDance Music\n\nFurthermore on LP the Title Music is only: 1:30 minutes (probably\n\nedited\n\nby HMV), while the 78 rpm version is 2:53 minutes\n\nAlso the song: Yeh Pyar Ki Baaten / Mukesh - only 2 paras are there\n\non the LP, again a cut by HMV). The 78 rpm version has 3 paras.\n\nI am almost certain that the LP (and so also the tape / CD) are from\n\nthe 78 rpm records.\n\nComments from members, who have seen this film in recent past are\n\nwelcomed (I saw it about 40 years ago, when only 78 rpm versions\n\nwere played on the radio)\n\nANMOL GHADI\n\n============\n\nThe LP has the same 12 songs, as listed for the CD. That is to say\n\nthat the Dance Music (available at Prof. Singh's site) is missing.\n\nIt seems that the LP source is SoundTrack.\n\n4 ½ songs by Noor Jehan (78 rpm version) were released earlier\n\non a LP / Noor Jehan - The ½ song is - Aawaz De Kahan Hai, wherein\n\npara rendered by Surendra was chopped off mama.\n\nMy analysis is based on:\n\nAawaz De Kahan Hai 3:09 min / LP,\n\n3:29 min / CD\n\n- Surendra - Vintage\n\nAaja Meri Barbaad 3:11 / LP\n\n2:43 / 78\n\nrpm - LP / Noor\n\nMere Bachpan Ke 3:08 / LP\n\n2:55 / 78\n\nrpm - LP / Noor\n\nAgain, Like Anokhi Ada, I saw the film about 40 years ago, so\n\ncomments from members are welcomed\n\nSudhir"
