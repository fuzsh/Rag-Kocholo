As children, the poor Chander (Surendra) and the wealthy Lata (Nurjehan) were sweethearts until Lata's moved to Bombay. Years later, Chander's love remains unabated. When his rich friend Prakash (Zahur Raja) lands in a job selling musical instruments in Bombay, Chander moves only to learn that Lata -- now a renowned poet who goes by the nom de pen Renu -- is engaged to Prakash. At the same time, Lata's friend Basanti (Suraiya) falls completely for the protagonist. Does he remain true to his childhood love or does he love the one he is with?"
