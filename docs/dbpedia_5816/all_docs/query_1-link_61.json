        "text": "BY VIKAS DATTA\n\nAt the start of her singing career, she needed to stand on a stool to be able to reach the microphone but then she went on in her comparatively short career to become the last of Bollywood’s three singing superstars. In her heyday, Suraiya was so popular that she had to stop attending her film premieres to forestall the frenzy her presence evoked.\n\nYet, at the peak of her career as an actress and singer — where in one role, she brought Ghalib’s ghazals to life for the modern generation and was complimented for it by no less than Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Suraiya gradually withdrew from the limelight and just in her early 30s, turned her back on the tinsel world forever.\n\nOnce needing a Bombay Police detachment outside her home given the crowds her fame attracted, she, after abandoning films, spent the remaining four decades of her life in semi-seclusion, depriving the world of an angelic screen presence, whose slight air of naivete only added to her charm, and a voice, with an undernote of hesitation and tentativeness, that sounded as melodious as gently tinkling bells.\n\nBorn in Lahore in June in 1929, Suraiya Jamal Sheikh was just six when she began singing for All India Radio in Mumbai, where her parents had moved when she was a year old and had Raj Kapoor and Madan Mohan as her co-artistes.\n\nWhen she was 7, Suraiya acted in her first film — produced by Nargis’s mother Jaddanbai — and at the age of 13, she attracted the attention of the likes of music maestro Naushad, who picked her to sing for “Rattan”, which went on to become a super-hit, Devika Rani, and even the immortal K.L. Saigal.\n\nSuraiya went to hold her own against Noor Jahan in “Anmol Ghadi” and while handpicked by Saigal for some of his last films, steadfastly refused to sing duets with him, believing she was no match for him as a singer.\n\nIt is not known why Suraiya began withdrawing herself from films since the early 1950s and entirely abandoned a promising career at the age of 33. She cited health reasons, especially her low blood pressure, but her turbulent relationship with Dilip Kumar, her aborted romance with Dev Anand, and other such matters are also bandied about as reasons.\n\nWhatever may be the reason, let us focus on some of her melodious songs, which she mostly sang for herself in her screen appearances — 338 odd songs in 67 films between 1936 and 1963.\n\n“Man, leta hi angdai” (“Anmol Ghadi”) was a landmark film for more reasons than one — it being the only one to feature both the female singing superstars of the then Indian cinema, Noor Jehan and Suraiya, together.\n\n“Paapi papiha re pi pi na bol bairi” (“Parwana”) was one where Suraiya stood strong against Saigal, her fellow singing superstar. Listening to this classical music-based piece we can only wonder why Suraiya thought she was no match for Saigal.\n\n“Tu mera chaand main teri chandni” (“Dillagi”) was a hit in its time, and among them who watched it multiple times was a young Punjabi lad who later confessed that he watched it dozens of times, but still could not get enough of Suraiya — we know him as Dharmendra.\n\n“Aah ko chahiye umr asar hone tak” (“Mirza Ghalib”) resurrected the memory of the famous Urdu poet and Suraiya’s rendition of his ghazals showed their rhythmic and lyrical cadence. At the film’s premiere in New Delhi, Prime Minister Nehru singled her out for special praise, telling her “Ladki, tumne Ghalib ki rooh ko zinda kar diya.” The duet “Dil-e-Nadan”, sung by Suraiya and Talat Mehmood, stands the test of time, but it is this ghazal that shows the stuff that Ghalib — and Suraiya — were made of.\n\n“Ye kaisi ajab daastan ho gayi hai”: This song from “Rustom Sohrab” (1963) was Suraiya’s swan song and could serve as a epitaph for her career, especially when she sings “Bujha do bujha do, bujhaa do sitaaron ki shamme bujha do … Yahaan raushni mehman ho gayi hai”."
