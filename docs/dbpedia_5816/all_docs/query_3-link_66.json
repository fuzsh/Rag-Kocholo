The last movie Milkha saw a black and white classic Anmol Ghadi (1946) starring Suraiya and Noor Jehan. Ever since he has stayed away from movies. After years he will be finally watch a movie that too based on his own life. It would be indeed a special experience for him to watch Bhaag Milkha Bhaag on 70 mm after so many years. \"He (Singh) is very excited about watching the film when it releases this July. He wants to catch it with his family and close friends. Although his wife, son and daughter are movie buffs, Singh has been the complete opposite all his life. In over five decades, he hasn't watched a film even on television,\" says a source close to the former athlete. Ask Singh about it and he says, \"I loved watching films from Raj Kapoor's days. In fact, some of my best memories of films come from that era. I would love to see Bhaag Milkha Bhaag on the big screen in the theatre.\" The biopic is directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and features Farhan Akhtar, who plays Singh. The actor underwent rigorous training for over a year to acquire an athletic built. The film, which also stars Sonam Kapoor, will hit the theatres on July 12."
