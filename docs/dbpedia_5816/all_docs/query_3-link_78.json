        "text": "The last time Milkha Singh went to a theatre was in 1960 to catch the Suraiya and Noor Jehan-starrer Anmol Ghadi (1946). Since then, the former Olympian hasn’t watched a movie on the big screen. This will probably make the experience of watching Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, a biopic on him, all the more special for him.\n\n“He (Singh) is very excited about watching the film when it releases this July. He want to catch it with his family and close friends. Although his wife, son and daughter are movie buffs, Singh has been the complete opposite all his life. In over five decades, he hasn’t watched a film even on television,” says a source close to the former athlete. Ask Singh about it and he says, “I loved watching films from Raj Kapoor’s days.\n\nIn fact, some of my best memories of films come from that era. I would love to see Bhaag Milkha Bhaag on the big screen in the theatre.”\n\nThe biopic is directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and features Farhan Akhtar, who plays Singh. The actor underwent rigorous training for over a year to acquire an athletic built. The film, which also stars Sonam Kapoor, will hit the theatres on July 12."
