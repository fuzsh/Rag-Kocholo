        "text": "The duo is recreating an old melody Jawan Hai Mohabbat Haseen Hai Zamana from the film Anmol Ghadi (1946). The song was originally crooned by Pakistani singer Noor Jehan. The song will be for a private album which will be released by Saregama.\n\nConfirming the news, Bickram Ghosh said, “Yes we are recreating the cult song and many others. We are collaborating with George Brooks for the album and intend to team up with a few more. The album also features American musician Greg Smith, UK percussionist Pete Lockett and many others.”\n\nBickram also revealed that the duo would also be interested in roping Indian musicians like Ustad Amjad Ali Khan. “We have not spoken to him (Amjad Ali Khan) as yet but we intend to feature a lot of other artistes of this stature,” added Bickram. Both are remaking the songs from the era of 1940’s, 50’s and one or two from 60’s. The songs have been selected by Sonu and Bickram.\n\nCurrently Sonu Nigam is prepping up for his singing reality show Indian Idol Season 7. The promos have already been aired on the channel and auditions have begun. Interestingly, Sonu will be joining Farah Khan and Anu Malik on the judge panel after 10 years. The trio had last judged Season 2 of the show.\n\nWith so much on his platter already, looks like Sonu is a busy man!\n\nThumbnail Image Source: bro4u & geetmanjusha"
