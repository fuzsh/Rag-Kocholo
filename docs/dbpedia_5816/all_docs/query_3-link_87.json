        "text": "By\n\nSharada Iyer\n\nMusic and songs have always been an integral part of our films right from the silent era when a bunch of musicians used to sit behind the screens and play music to give the right emotion to the scene. With the arrival of the talkies, songs became an inseparable part of our cinema and it was but natural to choose such artistes who could not only act but also sing their own songs.\n\nThere were many stars of 1930’s and 1940’s who laid the foundation of our Hindi film industry with their invaluable contribution in the field of acting as well as singing. One such cinematic icon of yesteryear was actor-singer Surendranath or Surendra as he was popularly referred to.\n\nWho can forget the evergreen duet ‘Aawaz de kahan hai, duniya meri jawan hai…’ composed by music director Naushad for the Mehboob Khan directed 1946 super-hit film Anmol Ghadi ? Sung in the voices of Noorjehan and Surendra even today the song remains as fresh in the hearts of movie-lovers as it was when it was first heard 72 years back:\n\nFamous duet with Noorjehan in Anmol Ghadi\n\nThe same film had this superb solo in Surendra’s voice ‘Kyun yaad aa rahe hain guzare hue zamaane…’ which touches a poignant note even today in the listener’s heart. This could possibly be rated as his best solo.\n\nAnmol Ghadi 1946\n\nNaushad also gave him some super songs in the love triangle Anokhi Ada which came in 1948– two years after Anmol Ghadi. Starring Surendra, Naseem Bano and Prem Adib the movie was once again directed by Mehboob Khan. The songs of this film also became very popular. Surendra played a character with slight negative shades as he becomes possessive of his love for Naseem Bano knowing that she has lost her memory and had loved another man before her accident.\n\nHere are two lovely songs from the film:\n\nAnokhi Ada 1948\n\nANOKHI ADA\n\nEARLY DAYS\n\nSurendranath was discovered by director Mehboob Khan and he made his debut in an action film titled Deccan Queen in 1936 which was the latter’s second directorial venture. It so happened that Ardeshir Irani who had made the first talkie ‘Alam Ara’ decided to start another new company Sagar Movietone as a subsidiary company to his already existing Imperial Film Company in partnership with two of his associates and Mehboob Khan was transferred to the new setup as the head of production.\n\nSagar Movietone was at that stage on the lookout for a singing star to offset New Theatres Calcutta’s singing sensation Kundan Lal Saigal who had become a national rage after the release of Devdas in 1935. With this in mind Mehboob Khan signed the tall and handsome Surendra Nath who could also sing well. In fact in this film Surendranath was given a song ‘Birha ki aag lagi more man mein…’ whose tune was an exact copy of Saigal’s super-hit song ‘Balam aayo baso mere man mein…’ from his 1935 film Devdas. People loved the song and Surendra was noticed immediately.\n\nDeccan Queen\n\nHere is the original from ‘Devdas’ in Saigal’s voice:\n\nThe commercial success of Deccan Queen established Surendra as a ‘singing star’ of immense potential. His second film Manmohan also met with success and some even started referring to him as Bombay’s Saigal! The story of Manmohan was on the lines of Devdas where two childhood friends get separated when they grow up as she is forced to go back to the man she had been engaged to in childhood and he takes to alcohol. The film starred singer-actress Bibbo as the heroine.\n\nThe film had a chart-buster duet ‘Tumne mujhko prem sikhaya…’ and the music arranger was young Anil Biswas who had not yet started out on his own! The film ran for 50 weeks at Bombay’s Imperial cinema.\n\nIn 1937 director Mehboob Khan pitted ‘singing star’ Surendra against ‘natural actor’ Motilal in the romantic thriller ‘Jagirdar’ which also involved a murder. In the film Surendra played Motilal’s father.\n\nIn 1940 in Mehboob Khan’s Alibaba , Surendra played a double role –that of Ali Baba as well as his son. The heroines were Sardar Akhtar and Waheedanbai (actress Nimmi’s mother).\n\nMehboob Khan directed Surendra in eight films which also included the 1940 classic Aurat which was the precursor to Mehboob Khan’s own magnum opus Mother India. Based on the same story of the sacrifices made by an Indian peasant woman and the unimaginable hardships faced by her, Mehboob Khan made a few minor changes and remade his own Aurat seventeen years later in 1957.\n\nIn Aurat, Surendranath played the role of the elder son which was played by Rajendra Kumar in Mother India. The film when released in 1940 was considered a milestone in Hindi cinema and even today the director’s brilliance comes through in every frame. Even though it was Mother India that attained a cult status in later years due to international recognition and more publicity there is no denying that the 1940 original Aurat was more realistic and natural.\n\nAURAT 1940\n\nPlays the role of elder son which years later was Rajendra Kumar in Mother India\n\nSURENDRA’S HIT MELODIES\n\nAs Surendranath got to be paired with all the top female singing stars of his time, he had many hits to his credit. There were several duets with the then reigning stars like Noorjehan, Suraiya, Bibbo, Khurshid, Naseem Bano, etc. Here are links to a few of his hit songs.\n\nGRAMOPHONE SINGER (1938)\n\nELAAN (1940)\n\nGHARIB (1942)\n\n1857 with Suraiyya in 1943\n\nEven though the audio and video of the links is not clear, it is still worth listening because of the melodious tune and rendition:\n\nLAL HAVELI with Noorjehan in 1943\n\nMAJHDHAR (1947)-Duet with Khurshid\n\nA rare fast-paced duet from the film MERI KAHANI 1948\n\nMERI KAHANI 1948\n\nDUKHIYARI\n\nAS A CHARACTER ARTISTE IN LATER YEARS\n\nWith the advent of playback singing in our cinema, the era of singing stars slowly came to an end. Soon Surendranath also started accepting character roles and for the next two decades acted in small roles in many films like Dil Deke Dekho, Hariyali Aur Raasta, Daag, 36 Ghante, Geet Gaya Pathron Ne, Johar-Mehmood in Goa, Saraswatichandra, etc.\n\nThe most notable among them being the Vijay Bhatt directed super-hit musical of 1953-Baiju Bawra. Surendranath played ‘Tansen’ in the film and was noticed for the same. He was fortunate to lip-sync to a noted classical singer like Ustad Amir Khan.\n\nWatch the extraordinary face-off between Tansen played by Surendranath and Baiju Bawra played by Bharat Bhushan:\n\nHe reprised the role of ‘Tansen’ once again in K Asif’s Mughal-e-Azam and this time he had classical exponent Bade Ghulam Ali Khan sing for him Though there were only a couple of shots director K Asif and music director Naushad felt that only an accomplished singer like Surendra would do justice to the lip-syncing of the song.\n\nHis other popular films include Milan (1967) where he played Nutan’s father:\n\nHe was Sharmila Tagore’s father in Waqt and also ends up rescuing the young Sunil Dutt after the earthquake shatters Balraj’s Sahni’s family.\n\nIn 1968 he played father to twin girls Rupa and Deepa played by Sharmila Tagore who has a double role in the film An Evening In Paris.\n\nWhile Gawaiyah in 1954 was his last film as a singing actor, Abhi Toh Jee Lein released in 1977 was his last film as an actor after which he retired from films and started his own advertising company and made commercials. Today his son Kailash Surendranath (best known for producing the original version of ‘Mile sur mera tumhara…’ in 1988 for Doordarshan) is a well known ad-director having his own company.\n\nBorn and educated in Punjab Surendranath was a lawyer and came to Bombay to try his luck on the recommendation of a distributor friend of his. Destiny played its hand when he was handpicked by director Mehboob Khan for Sagar Movietone’s Deccan Queen and there was no looking back. On his family’s insistence, his qualifications appeared in the titles along with his name-‘Surendranatn B.A. LLB’ . He passed away in 1987 at the age of 76 leaving behind a body of work which forms an important part of the early musicals of our cinematic history.\n\nLIVE PERFORMANCE in 1982 :\n\nThere was a music concert held in 1982 when Noorjehan returned to India after 35 years. Many cine artistes and singers were part of the function. When Noorjehan was called on stage to sing, she chose the famous duet from Anmol Ghadi – ‘Awaaz de kahan hai…’ but instead of calling Surendranath also on stage to render alongside her, she chose to sing his lines also. Probably this hurt him because he mentioned about this incident in an interview with Tabassum.\n\nLater Surendranath came on stage and sang a few lines of his hit solo song ‘Kyun yaad aa rahe hain…’\n\nNot many pause to remember Surendranath’s contribution today. This blog is but a small attempt to revive old memories and to take the readers on a trip down memory lane…\n\n(Note: All images have been taken from the internet)"
