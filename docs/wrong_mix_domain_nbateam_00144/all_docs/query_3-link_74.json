        "text": "The 1995-96 Kentucky Wildcats men’s basketball team was a special one. They went 34 – 2 overall and won the national championship. It was also a team loaded with players who are beloved even to this day, including new Wildcats head coach Mark Pope.\n\nThat team had a perfect balance of shooting, leadership, athletes, and intelligence to make a long run. Led by coach Rick Pitino, they were well-coached, and played with determination.\n\nThe Wildcats ran through their schedule that year, losing only to Massachusetts early in the year and then Mississippi State in the SEC Tournament championship. In the NCAA Tournament, they didn’t play a close game until the Final Four rematch with UMass. Then, they beat Syracuse in the championship game to take the title.\n\nIn the years after the championship, the players from that roster went in many different directions. Where are they all now? Let’s take a look at each of them, and where life took them after the 1996 championship.\n\nMark Pope\n\nThe championship season was Mark Pope’s final one at Kentucky. He was drafted by the Indiana Pacers and played a few seasons, but went into the coaching ranks after that. As a coach, had a successful run at BYU, and is now the head coach of the Kentucky Wildcat, having come full circle. He’ll try to bring another banner to Lexington.\n\nDerek Anderson\n\nDerek Anderson was one of the most explosive players on the Kentucky teams of that time period. He averaged over 17 points per game the year following the championship and was drafted with the 13th pick of the NBA Draft. He played for 11 injury plagued seasons. Anderson recently wrote a book, Stamina, and does motivational speaking as well.\n\nAntoine Walker\n\nForward Antoine Walker averaged over 15 points per game for the ’96 Cats. He was picked sixth overall in the NBA Draft and went on to have a pretty successful career as a professional. After retiring in 2012, he overcame some personal difficulties, but worked for the SEC Network as an analyst for college basketball and started a charitable foundation.\n\nTony Delk\n\nTony Delk is one of the all-time Kentucky greats. He was one of the leaders on that championship team, and averaged almost 18 points per game that year. He was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets and played in the NBA for a decade. After that, he spent some time as an assistant coach at Kentucky. He also founded the Tony Delk Basketball Academy.\n\nWayne Turner\n\nPoint guard Wayne Turner was at Kentucky for two national championships. He went undrafted after college, though, and played for many years in other leagues. He also served as an assistant coach for a period at Louisville under Rick Pitino. More recently, he has taken a head coaching job for a girl’s high school basketball team.\n\nAllen Edwards\n\nAllen Edwards was on both of the mid-90s Kentucky championship teams. He wasn’t a huge contributor stat-wise for the championship team, but gave them some important minutes. He began coaching in 2003, and was the head coach at Wyoming for four years. Currently, he’s an assistant at Massachusetts.\n\nWalter McCarty\n\nWalter McCarty did a little bit of everything for Kentucky. He played in the NBA for 11 seasons, mostly for the Boston Celtics, before entering the coaching ranks. Like some of the others on that Kentucky team, he was an assistant under Pitino for a bit before finally getting a head coaching job at Evansville. He is now coaching overseas after a scandal.\n\nJeff Sheppard\n\nJeff Sheppard was also a member of both of the Kentucky championship teams. He spent a few seasons in the NBA and overseas, but retired in 2001. He is the Vice President for Business Development at Wazoo Sports, and has had some other ventures in the private sector. He spends a lot of time now watching and managing his son Reed’s career.\n\nNazr Mohammed\n\nCenter Nazr Mohammed was a Freshman on the championship team, and didn’t play a lot. After leaving Kentucky, he was a first round pick in the NBA, and played for nearly two decades. He started a charitable foundation, and is currently working in the Oklahoma City Thunder’s organization.\n\nRon Mercer\n\nRon Mercer was a highly rated recruit who played for two seasons at Kentucky. He was drafted sixth overall by the Celtics, played for nine seasons in the NBA. Since his retirement, Mercer has stayed out of the public eye for the most part, though he has ran some basketball camps and done some public speaking.\n\nAnthony Epps\n\nPoint guard Anthony Epps averaged nearly seven points and five assists as Kentucky won the title. He went undrafted, and mostly stayed out of public life. He has a daughter who also played for the Wildcats and is currently in the WNBA. Epps is a high school basketball coach for both girls and boys teams.\n\nCameron Mills\n\nCameron Mills didn’t play much on the championship team, but would become more involved in the following two years. The sharp-shooter didn’t have a career in basketball, instead choosing to go into ministry. More recently, he has become a member of the UK Sports Network team, announcing games and doing interviews.\n\nJared Prickett\n\nForward Jared Prickett was injured for most of the 1995-96 season, and was red-shirted. He would go on to be a popular player with Wildcats fans. He played a season internationally, but didn’t stay in the pro game. Currently, he is passing on his love for the game by coaching kids at various levels."
