        "text": "NBA Championship(s): Boston Celtics (1957, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Holy Cross Crusaders (1947)\n\nWhat do we need to say about Bob Cousy that hasn't been said before? Well, as a freshman on Holy Cross, Cousy was part of an interesting subbing process that kept him off the court for large chunks of time. Interestingly, for all that \"Mr. Basketball\" accomplished, it may come as a surprise that in capturing the NCAA title, Cousy went a pitiful 2/13 from the field and only managed to put up four points. Guess the \"Houdini of the Hardwood\" nickname can also account for his ability to pull a win out of a hat even when his game is struggling.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Boston Celtics (1957, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Kentucky Wildcats (1951)\n\nAs we mentioned before with Cliff Hagan, Frank Ramsey was another player on Kentucky that suffered because of the point-shaving scandal but like Lou Tsioropoulos, Ramsey went to the Celtics and enjoyed the good 'ol years where Boston won chip after chip after chip. In the end, Ramsey ended up with seven titles, averaging 13.4 points per game in his career.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Boston Celtics (1957, 1959)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Kentucky Wildcats (1951)\n\nAlong with a guy we already discussed in Cliff Hagan, Lou Tsioropoulos also suffered from the Kentucky point-shaving scandal that limited those two guys to only one championship. But don't feel bad for Tsioropoulos because after leaving college, he joined the Boston Celtics and added two NBA titles to his name, thanks to Bill Russell and Bob Cousy. And yeah, Tsioropoulos helped whenever he could with his little 7.7 career average. Was that mean-spirited? Sorry. We're not sorry.\n\nNBA Championship(s): St. Louis Hawks (1958)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Kentucky Wildcats (1951)\n\nCliff Hagan has one NCAA and one NBA championship, but the former could've been two. That's because in 1952, a point shaving scandal rocked the program and forced the school to forfeit the ensuing season, which happened to be Hagan's senior year. After graduating from Kentucky, Hagan played the following year and posted a career-high 24 points per game and helped lead the Wildcats to a tourney bid. Unfortunately, the NCAA disallowed Hagan from playing in the Tournament since a rule stipulated that graduates couldn't participate. The 'Cats eventually pulled their bid altogether and you can't help but wonder, what if.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Minneapolis Lakers (1954) & Boston Celtics (1963, 1964)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Kansas Jayhawks (1952)\n\nBeing one of the guys on this list to win an NBA and NCAA title is one thing, but Clyde Lovellette did something even more impressive and rare. During his senior year at Kansas, Lovellette led the nation in scoring with 28.4 points per game and helped his team win the National Championship in 1952. Do you know how many people other than Clyde have accomplished that? Done guessing? Zero. How could you not be impressed by that?\n\nNBA Championship(s): Philadelphia Warriors (1956)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): La Salle Explorers (1954)\n\nAt La Salle, Tom Gola was the man, homie. Born and raised in Philadelphia, Gola didn't move too far from home when he joined La Salle, which is located in Philly. By not venturing too far away from his hometown, Gola's legend grew when he led the Explorers to a NCAA championship while snatching Tournament MVP and National Player of the Year honors in 1954. After averaging 20.9 points and 19.0 rebounds per game throughout his collegiate career, it wasn't crazy to think that Gola would be able to translate that success to the next level, however, he never became the star that he was for La Salle in the NBA. In the end, Gola averaged 11.3 PPG and 7.8 RPG in the league. Not bad but a far departure from his college stats.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Boston Celtics (1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): San Francisco Dons (1955, 1956)\n\nNow, before you go dismissing K.C. Jones' accomplishments with the Celtics and San Francisco because he was Bill Russell's teammate on both squads, think again. Might we add that Jones also went on to win two titles as Boston's head coach in 1984 and 1986. That's 10 chips total, folks. Funny thing is, that's still less than Bill Russell.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Boston Celtics (1957, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1968, 1969)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): San Francisco Dons (1955, 1956)\n\nSimply put, Bill Russell knew how to win it all. From his 11 NBA titles to the five MVP awards to his two NCAA titles, Russell's awards can go on and on, but we assume you already get the point by now, right?\n\nNBA Championship(s): New York Knicks (1973)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Ohio State Buckeyes (1960)\n\nIn 1960, Jerry Lucas single-handedly led Ohio State to their National Championship. Behind Lucas' 26.3 points and 16.4 rebounds per game, the Buckeyes were able to easily defeat everyone they faced by at least 15 points or more. In the NBA, Lucas continued to post phenomenal numbers, but oddly, his stats never translated to titles. It wasn't until Lucas posted the second-worst numbers (9.9 PPG and 7.2 RPG) in his 11-year career that he was finally able to get an NBA title as a member of the Knicks.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Boston Celtics (1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1974, 1976)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Ohio State Buckeyes (1960)\n\nJohn Havlicek has the type of resume that puts many other former NBA players to shame. From his eight NBA championships to his 13 All-Star selections, the accolades go on and on. But, the fact that Havlicek is one of 40 players to win an NBA and NCAA title just adds another dimension to his illustrious career. Long live Hondo.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Boston Celtics (1968)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Cincinnati Bearcats (1961, 1962)\n\nEven though Tom Thacker amassed an unimpressive 6.2 points and 2.6 rebounds per game, somehow, he was still able to not only win an NCAA and NBA championship, he also grabbed an ABA title in 1971 as a member of the Indiana Pacers.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Boston Celtics (1965, 1966)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Cincinnati Bearcats (1962)\n\nWith Celtics teammates like Bill Russell and John Havlicek, it's not surprising to see Ron Bonham's name on this list. While capturing the titles with Boston were light work, he showed some real skill as a member of the Cincinnati Bearcats. Bonham averaged 19.6 points per game throughout his collegiate career and even improving with each season by posting 21.0 and 24.4 PPG in his junior and senior year, respectively.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Los Angeles Lakers (1972)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): UCLA Bruins (1964, 1965)\n\nAs a member of the wildly successful UCLA Bruins program under John Wooden, Gail Goodrich was able to get two NCAA titles alongside another member of this list, Keith Erickson. But there was a difference between Goodrich and Erickson. Namely, Goodrich was able to take his game to the pros and succeed. Averaging 19.6 points per game throughout his NBA career, Goodrich eventually had his No. 25 jersey retired by the Lakers, then by UCLA and in 1996, he was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Los Angeles Lakers (1972)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): UCLA Bruins (1964, 1965)\n\nKeith Erickson wasn't a standout player during his time on the UCLA Bruins basketball team, but legendary coach John Wooden was still able to get the best out of every one of his players, and Erickson helped the Bruins win two consecutive NCAA titles in 1964 and 1965. Not bad when you consider that Erickson had to balance basketball with a baseball scholarship as well as playing on the school's volleyball team. Not surprisingly, coach Wooden called Erickson the finest athlete he ever coached.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Milwaukee Bucks (1971) & Los Angeles Lakers (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1988)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): UCLA Bruins (1967, 1968, 1969)\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar simply knew how to win. Personal awards, championships, whatever. While in the NBA, Abdul-Jabbar collected 19 All-Star selections, two scoring titles, and six NBA championships. With UCLA, Kareem was a three-time NCAA Champion, NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player and National Player of the Year. DJ Khaled's \"All I Do Is Win\" is the soundtrack to Lew Alcindor's life.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Milwaukee Bucks (1971)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): UCLA Bruins (1967, 1968)\n\nIt sure must've been nice to have Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as a teammate. In fact, we're hoping that Lucius Allen gave Abdul-Jabbar a \"Thank You\" card, a couple free meals, something. From his time with UCLA to his playing days with the Bucks, Allen stood back and let Kareem cook on a nightly basis and dude simply reaped the rewards, which included two NCAA championships and one NBA title. Then, when Lucius moved onto the Lakers in 1974, the man formerly known as Lew Alcindor followed suit in 1975. Unfortunately, they were never able to capture a chip together LA LA Land, but after Allen's playing days were done in 1979, Abdul-Jabbar went on to capture five more titles. Man, dude must've been kicking himself for not sticking around a little while longer.\n\nNBA Championship(s): New York Knicks (1973)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): UCLA Bruins (1970, 1971, 1972)\n\nSports is all about streaks. When you're hot, it's hard to be stopped. Simple as that. And from 1970 to 1973, there were few people who saw as much success at both the collegiate and professional level as Henry Bibby. For three years with UCLA, Bibby helped capture three NCAA titles and then he entered the NBA Draft where he was a part of the Knicks '73 championship team. Who cares that he averaged a dismal 4.2 points per game? A win's a win, right?\n\nNBA Championship(s): Golden State Warriors (1975) & Los Angeles Lakers (1980, 1982, 1985)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): UCLA Bruins (1972, 1973)\n\nDuring his sophomore and junior years at UCLA, Jamaal \"SIlk\" Wilkes played alongside Bill Walton and won the National title in two consecutive years. Unfortunately, UCLA fell short of a championship in his senior season, coming in third place. However, throughout his collegiate career, Wilkes did post some impressive numbers which included 15.0 points and 7.4 rebounds per game while shooting 51 percent from the field. His winning ways as a member of the Bruins eventually went with him when he turned pro because Wilkes did manage to win four chips.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Portland Trail Blazers (1977) & Boston Celtics (1986)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): UCLA Bruins (1972, 1973)\n\nYeah, Bill Walton won two titles in the NBA, but let's talk about his time at UCLA. As a member of the Bruins, Walton played a huge role in helping his team attain back-to-back 30-0 records and two consecutive National Championships. In fact, Walton nearly forgot what it was like to lose because from his junior year of high school to the middle of his senior year at UCLA, Walton didn't lose a single game.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Boston Celtics (1984)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Indiana Hoosiers (1976)\n\nThe name Quinn Buckner may not sound familiar, unless you're a diehard basketball fan, but the guy is a rare breed. Buckner has won an NCAA and NBA title, obviously, but did you know that he's won a chip at the high school level and captured gold in the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal as a member of the U.S. Men's Basketball team? Only three other people have done that: Magic Johnson, Jerry Lucas and Clyde Lovellette.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Los Angeles Lakers (1980)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Marquette Golden Eagles (1977)\n\nNow, we're a little more than halfway through the list and at this moment, you may be unimpressed by the feat of a player winning an NBA and NCAA championship. Then let's introduce you to Alfred Lee, who is believed to be the only person to win the aforementioned chips, as well as a 1985 title in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN) which is the primary Puerto Rican men's basketball league. Not too many folks can brag about that.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Los Angeles Lakers (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1988)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Michigan State Spartans (1979)\n\nPrior to all the Lakers/Celtics rivalry in the NBA Finals that occurred throughout the 1980s, there was also the 1979 NCAA Championship Game between Magic Johnson and Michigan State versus Larry Bird and Indiana State that started it all. During that game, Bird and Johnson both led their teams in scoring, 19 and 24, respectively. But it was Magic's squad that came out on top, defeating the Sycamores, 75-64, and accomplishing something that Bird was never able to do in his collegiate career. So, Magic won?\n\nNBA Championship(s): Chicago Bulls (1993)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Louisville Cardinals (1980)\n\nRodney McCray wasn't an offensive juggernaut but his play on the defensive end was what primarily got him his NCAA and NBA titles. While on Louisville, McCray played alongside Darrell Griffith, Derek Smith, and Scooter McCray, who all managed to play their part and win the National Championship in 1980. After bouncing from the Rockets to the Kings to the Mavericks, Rodney spent his last season in the NBA with Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and the Bulls where he finally got his first NBA title.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Detroit Pistons (1989, 1990)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Indiana Hoosiers (1981)\n\nIt took a little while and a couple growing pains for Isiah Thomas to pan out with Indiana but after his freshman year, Thomas' stellar play led them to the Sweet Sixteen in 1980 and then a National Championship the following year. After winning it all with the Hoosiers, Zeke went on to become the second overall pick in the '81 Draft. Again, it took some time for Isiah to reach the promised land, but after two incredible performances which included scoring 25 points on an injured ankle in the '89 FInals, and then averaging 27.6 points, 7.0 assists and 5.2 rebounds per game in the '90 Finals, Detroit was able to capture the Larry O'Brien trophy in back-to-back seasons by beating the Lakers and Blazers, respectively.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Los Angeles Lakers (1985, 1987, 1988)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): North Carolina Tar Heels (1982)\n\nJames Worthy was an excellent player. He has a a spot on the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and a place on the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team to show for it. But, you know what doesn't hurt? Calling equally, if not better players your teammates. You see, in his only NCAA title with North Carolina, Worthy played alongside Michael Jordan and Sam Perkins, and he had Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as a member of the Lakers. Like we said, Worthy was good but he did have some good help around him. *ducks*\n\nNBA Championship(s): Chicago Bulls (1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): North Carolina Tar Heels (1982)\n\nMichael Jordan is arguably the best player to ever play the game of basketball, so is it all that shocking to see him on this list? In addition to having NBA titles, Jordan also helped his North Carolina teammates reach the NCAA mountain top in 1982 by hitting the game winner against Patrick Ewing and his Hoyas. Just one of the many, many awards to put on that shelf.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Los Angeles Lakers (1987, 1988)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Louisville Cardinals (1986)\n\nDuring Louisville's lone championship victory in 1986, Billy Thompson was impressive. With 14.9 points and 7.8 rebounds per game, Thompson looked like an NBA-ready forward which would explain why he was selected in the first round by the Warriors in the '86 Draft. But, in a last-minute move, he was sent to the Lakers where he was fortunate enough to win two consecutive titles as a member of the franchise. However, there was a small problem. Those years were mostly spent injury-laden with Thompson only playing a total of 800 minutes on the court. But hey, it doesn't matter how you get the chip, as long as you get 'em.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Los Angeles Lakers (1988)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Louisville Cardinals (1986)\n\nThroughout his collegiate career with Louisville, Milt Wagner posted mediocre averages that included 12.7 points, 3.0 assists and 2.5 rebounds per game. Hardly the work of someone that could single-handily win a National Championship, no? Well, you'd be right. That's because if it weren't for his Cardinals and Lakers teammate, Billy Thompson, Wagner would probably not be on this list. Oh, and in case you're wondering, Milt averaged 3.8 PPG while on Los Angeles' 1988 title-winning team. We hope he thanked Billy Thompson.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Los Angeles Lakers (2000)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Michigan Wolverines (1989)\n\nWith 184 points in the 1989 NCAA Tournament, Glen Rice still holds the record for the most points in tourney history till this day. Those numbers won him that year's NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player and led the Michigan Wolverines to a championship win over Seton Hall in the Final. While in the NBA, Rice was the catalyst in getting the Heat, who were founded in 1988, into their first playoff series against the Bulls in 1992. However, it wasn't until Rice became a role player with the Los Angeles Lakers that he won his first and only NBA championship with Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, in 2000. Following that title run, Rice moved onto the Houston Rockets while the Lakers went on to win two more titles in consecutive years. Yeah, maybe he should've tried to stick around a little while longer.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Detroit Pistons (2004)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Arkansas Razorbacks (1994)\n\nIt may be surprising to hear that Corliss Williamson owns a ton of hardware, but it's true. In addition to his NBA and NCAA Championships, Corliss has won an AAU title, 1994 Final Four Most Outstanding Player award, SEC Player of the Year twice (1994 and 1995) and Sixth Man of the Year in 2002. Plus, we didn't mention how he came in second for Most Improved Player following his 1997-98 season where he posted 17.7 points and 5.6 rebounds per game with the Kings.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Miami Heat (2006)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Kentucky Wildcats (1996)\n\nBefore he became a member of this regrettable list, Antoine Walker was a player who found much success in the collegiate and professional level. As a freshman at Kentucky, Walker was named SEC Tournament MVP. Then, in his final year as a member of the Wildcats, Antoine helped his team get the NCAA Tournament title. Following that run, Walker moved onto the 1996 Draft where it took him 10 years to become one of 40 players to win both the Tourney and NBA titles. And in only 14 years, he filed for bankruptcy after amassing $12.7 million in debt. Started from the bottom, now you're...back at the bottom. #thingsDrakewillneversay #fingerscrossed\n\nNBA Championship(s): Miami Heat (2006)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Kentucky Wildcats (1996)\n\nSometimes, championships are earned and other times, they just fall into your lap...literally. For one season (2006), Derek Anderson averaged his second-least amount of minutes at 20.2 per game with the Heat, but still managed to get his first and only NBA title as he mostly sat and watched Dwyane Wade and Shaquille O'Neal take care of business, and defeat the Mavericks in six games. Collecting a check by mostly sitting on the bench and winning a chip. Does it get any better than that?\n\nNBA Championship(s): San Antonio Spurs (2005)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Kentucky Wildcats (1996, 1998)\n\nNever one to stand out in the stat sheet, Nazr Mohammed found success as a solid presence in the middle on his team's championship runs. As a member of the Kentucky Wildcats in 1996, Mohammed tipped the scales at 315 pounds and saw little playing time as the Cats went on to win it all. When Mohammed finally did get into playing shape, he controlled the paint with Jamaal Magloire and, after finishing 2nd the following year, the Wildcats won again in '98. In 2005, Mohammed played a platoon role at center alongside Radoslav Nesterovic as the Spurs edged by the Detroit Pistons in seven games.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Dallas Mavericks (2011)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Arizona Wildcats (1997)\n\nWith a squad full of \"Where Are They Now?\" members, like Mike Bibby, Michael Dickerson, and Miles Simon, Jason Terry and the Arizona Wildcats captured the NCAA title in 1997. And with successful offensive numbers with the Hawks, Terry wasn't able to get that elusive NBA title until his 7th season with the Mavericks when he beat LeBron James and the Heat in the 2011 Finals. No worries, though, Bron Bron eventually got his revenge on Jet.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Detroit Pistons (2004)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Connecticut Huskies (1999)\n\nAfter winning the Big East Player of the Year award in 1998, Richard Hamilton followed that stellar season with near identical numbers in 1998-99 (21.5 PPG, 4 APG, 4 RPG), however, this time he was sporting some additional hardware: an NCAA championship title. Meanwhile, it took Rip five years to finally add an NBA chip to his resume when the Pistons trounced the Lakers and their makeshift \"Dream Team\" with Kobe Bryant, Karl Malone and Gary Payton, in five games.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Miami Heat (2012)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Duke Blue Devils (2001)\n\nShane Battier has been a lucky man. Well, most of the time. Throughout his basketball career, Battier has aligned himself with successful teams like Miami and the Big 3 of LeBron, Wade and Bosh to winning programs like Duke and coach Mike Krzyzewski. Not surprisingly, he has gotten his hands on a couple championships. A man with brains, but you could already see that by taking one look at that weird looking skull of his.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Dallas Mavericks (2011)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Florida Gators (2006, 2007)\n\nGiven the tendency for players to implement the one-and-done rule these days, it was remarkable to see all the guys from the 2006 Florida Gators championship team return the next season. With NBA-ready players like Joakim Noah and Al Horford, the Gators won back-to-back chips but it has only been fellow teammate Corey Brewer, the 2007 Tournament's Most Outstanding Player, who has won both an NCAA and NBA title.\n\nNBA Championship(s): Miami Heat (2012)\n\nNCAA Championship(s): Kansas Jayhawks (2008)\n\nMario Chalmers may get plenty of heat (no pun intended) from LeBron James, but the guy knows how to win. And, it doesn't hurt that in the clutch, Chalmers isn't too bad either. Down by three in the 2008 NCAA Championship game against Memphis, Mario hit a pivotal three-pointer that sent the game into overtime and eventually helped Kansas secure the win and the title. Then, in 2012, Chalmers came through again by scoring 25 points out of nowhere to give the Heat a commanding 3-1 lead in the 2012 NBA Finals."
