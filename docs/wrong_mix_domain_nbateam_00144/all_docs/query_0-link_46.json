        "text": "Basketballghana.com can confirm American born Ghanaian Guard Alhaji Mohammed has announced his retirement from professional basketball.\n\nHe made the announcement during his 40th birthday celebration with a poem in a style similar to former Los Angeles Lakers Great Kobe Bryant.\n\nMohammed played for several teams across nine teams mostly in Europe and the Middle East after graduating from the University of Louisville in 2004.\n\nThe 6 foot 4 inch Mohammed played both Shooting Guard and Point Guard positions in his playing career for the likes of Paderborn Baskets in Germany and Limoges in France.\n\nHe is the younger brother of former NBA Champion Nazr Mohammed who won the NBA title during his time at San Antonio Spurs. Mohammed participated at the SEED Academy: Ghana Basketball Academy held in Ghana two years ago.\n\nAlhaji Mohammed was inducted into the Limoges Hall of Fame after a splendid two year stay at the club where he averaged 18 and 16 points respectively and alluded to this after getting inducted into the team’s Hall of Fame. (Click highlighted text to read story)\n\nFirst, a Happy Birthday to me with a letter to my first love-\n\n“Dear Basketball, Thank you for the last 16 years. Thank you for the 9 countries that became my home away from home. Thank you to all my old teammates and old coaches who believed in me.\n\nI’ve lied to myself every day thinking our time together would never end, so never took the time to walk away from you the right way.\n\nIt’s been one hell of a ride and career.\n\nI come into this this new year, at peace, knowing that the professional basketball chapter of my life is complete.\n\nMost importantly – Thank you, basketball, for saving my life.\n\n#11 #13”.\n\nBy Yaw Adjei-Mintah\n\n@YawMintYM on Twitter"
