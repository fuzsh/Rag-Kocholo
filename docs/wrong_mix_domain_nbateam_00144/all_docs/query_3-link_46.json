        "text": "By: Maxwell Clark⏐Writer⏐Twitter: @ClarkieCaps\n\nPhoto from The University of Notre Dame Athletics\n\nIrish fans have it good because there's the game within the game here. Do Markus and Booth hang around for YEARS? This is an Irish team where the long-term investment could be extremely rewarding. It all comes down to – How long will they be in South Bend?\n\nSir Mohammed – SF (National Rank: 54 – 247 Sports) Myers Park - Charlotte, NC\n\nSon of Nazr Mohammed – this is a bouncy athlete who scores in various ways. Mohammed embraces contact and finishes through it; he can get to the fadeaway or kick the ball out once he's driven and made his move. I noticed that he stays very grounded and in control throughout this process, similar to how a Kawhi Leonard does. I see some point-forward ability with easy one-handed passes thrown forward heading down the court. Fluid jump shot – and it's nice to BEGIN college with this. I could argue that he has some Markus Burton in his game with his play style. Mohammed has a strong frame that could quickly develop into an NBA frame. He will be on my NBA Draft Big Board.\n\nTake a look at Mohammed's game -\n\nCole Certa – SG (National Rank: 74 – 247 Sports) IMG Academy - Bradenton, FL\n\nCerta is a lanky wing with proven RELENTLESS shooting ability. This man effortlessly gets his shot off, even if it's with a fade, stepback, or pump fake – and the range is unlimited. He brings this to the paint, where he can hold up even with his slight frame. The wingspan is used to his advantage on the defensive end with his ability to block shots. The classic line \"there are levels to this\" will show with Certa – he's a top 100 recruit ready to ball out. He gets to the basket, has the floater, has the finishing ability, and wants to be the setup guy (throws lobs). The size the other two recruits offer will be NEEDED, so their path to minutes is more straightforward – but based on what I've seen from Certa, he BETTER be in the lineup.\n\nTake a look at Certa's game -\n\nGarrett Sundra - PF (National Rank: 124 – 247 Sports) Paul VI Catholic - Fairfax, VA\n\nSundra is an athletic four and another exciting piece to add to this Notre Dame team. Good touch around the rim --\"67% from the field in summer EYBL run\" (Light It Up Sports – Youtube). Mature player defensively who understands zones and knows where to be. He possesses an underrated passing ability that will be put on display by Division 1 level shooters around him. These prospects are all different but very skilled and should play well together. Mohammed/Burton's ability to get to the basket should set up Certa and Sundra. Hopefully, Booth will be around because his ability to hit shots from anywhere is ideal for spacing.\n\nNotre Dame has a lot to build on with the currently enrolled projects, and these kids staying around to fuse with this new class will lead to many more wins for Notre Dame. Coach Shrewsberry will have his next test of managing depth (hopefully after the portal is hit hard). I'm sure he's thrilled about having a solid class of reinforcements this early into his time at Notre Dame."
