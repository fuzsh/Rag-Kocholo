        "text": "LeBron James is now 25 years old, entering the prime of his career, and he's surrounded by his best supporting cast ever in Cleveland since he entered the league in the 2003-04 season.\n\nThrow in the fact that King James will be a free agent in the off-season, and it's now or never for the Cavaliers.\n\nThe No. 1 Cavs open the playoffs against a struggling No. 8 Chicago Bulls team that managed to squeak into the post-season thanks to the woeful play of the Toronto Raptors down the stretch.\n\n\"They have LeBron. But other than LeBron, they have a lot of really skilled players,\" Bulls coach Vinny Del Negro said. \"They're deep. They're big. Shaq coming back causes more problems, obviously. We know what Mo Williams is capable of doing.\"\n\nThe good news for Chicago is that guard Derrick Rose seems to be hitting his stride and centre Joakim Noah is finally healthy.\n\n\"You don't go into the series thinking you're going to lose,\" Noah said.\n\nThe task of guarding James will fall on the six-foot-nine shoulders of Luol Deng, the Bulls' tower on defence.\n\nRemember, last season, the Bulls pushed the Boston Celtics to seven games in the first round.\n\nNo. 2 Orlando vs. No. 7 Charlotte\n\nThe Orlando Magic finished the season with 59 wins, just two fewer than Cleveland. The Magic present the biggest obstacle for the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe Dwight Howard-led Magic face the Charlotte Bobcats in the first round.\n\nHoward (a.k.a. Superman) led the NBA in field-goal percentage (.612), rebounding (13.2 per game) and blocked shots (2.8 per game) this season.\n\nThe Magic retooled the supporting cast in the off-season, after falling to the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2009 NBA finals. Hedo Turkoglu was out; Vince Carter was in.\n\nCarter's offensive numbers have taken a hit since joining Orlando (16.6 PPG), but he's never been surrounded with such depth. Carter no longer needs to be the No. 1 scorer on the floor.\n\nThe Bobcats will have their hands full when it comes to defending Howard, and plan to foul the Magic centre early and often.\n\nTheo Ratliff, Tyson Chandler, Nazr Mohammed and DeSagana Diop are all likely to see a turn at the No. 5 position — add that up and that's 24 fouls to use if Charlotte wants to be physical.\n\nNo. 3 Atlanta vs. No. 6 Milwaukee\n\nUnlike last season, when a battered and bruised Atlanta team fell to the Cavs in a second-round sweep, the Hawks are 100 per cent healthy this time around.\n\nAtlanta rested most of their regulars in the final regular season game, allowing Al Horford, Joe Johnson and Jamal Crawford to nurse any nagging aches and pains prior to the start of the first-round series against Milwaukee.\n\nThe Bucks, meanwhile, will have to make do without their starting centre Andrew Bogut, who is out for the playoffs after suffering a serious arm injury.\n\n\"It definitely helps us,\" Hawks forward Williams said. \"That's super-unfortunate for them. I'm wishing the best for Andrew in his recovery. But we've got to do our best to take advantage of it.\"\n\nThe Bucks were one of the hottest teams in the league, surging into a playoff spot with a stretch of 15 wins in 17 games capped by a 98-95 victory over the Hawks on March 22.\n\nBut without Bogut, they lack a strong defensive presence underneath the basket.\n\nNo. 4 Boston vs. No. 5 Miami\n\nThe last time the Boston Celtics had a healthy Kevin Garnett in their lineup for the playoffs, they won the 2008 NBA championship.\n\nAlthough anything is possible, it would take a minor miracle for the Celtics to get out of the Eastern Conference, even though their big three — Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen — along with guard Rajon Rondo are all healthy.\n\nThe first challenge will be the Miami Heat, led by soon-to-be-free-agent Dwyane Wade, who averaged 33.7 points, 8.7 rebounds, five assists and two steals in three games against the Celtics this season. But Boston won all three regular season meetings between the clubs.\n\nWestern Conference\n\nThe NBA's Western Conference is a real powerhouse — the eighth-place Oklahoma City Thunder had as many wins as the fourth-seed Celtics did in the East — and the defending champion L.A. Lakers managed to dominate such a formidable field for the entire season, finishing with 57 wins.\n\nAlthough Cleveland and Orlando finished with better records than L.A., the Lakers earn the title as the favourite to win it all given their strength in a tougher conference.\n\nAlready, the trash talking has started between Lakers head coach Phil Jackson and Kevin Durant, the star of their first-round opponents, Oklahoma City.\n\nJackson suggested that referees were giving Durant special treatment (read: Kobe-like treatment), and he was getting more than his fair share of free-throw attempts.\n\nIf the Thunder have any chance at a first-round upset, Durant, who led the league in scoring with 30.1 PPG, will need to shoot the lights out against the Lakers.\n\nBut there is hope for the underdog Thunder. The Lakers are a hurting bunch right now, with Andrew Bynum (Achilles tendon) Sasha Vujacic (ankle), Luke Walton (back) and Jordan Farmar (hamstring) nursing injuries.\n\nNo. 2 Dallas vs. No. 7 San Antonio\n\nTwo months ago, Brendan Haywood, Caron Butler and DeShawn Stevenson were enduring a season gone horribly wrong in Washington.\n\nThen Dallas rescued them in a trade at the All-Star break.\n\nThe Mavericks went from winning 62 per cent of their games before the deal to winning 77 per cent after.\n\nNow that the playoffs are here, the giddy ex-Wizards should provide another boost.\n\nThe Mavericks open the first round at home Sunday night against the San Antonio Spurs, who were forced to shake things up when Tony Parker broke a bone in his right hand in March.\n\nThey played so well with George Hill starting at point guard that Parker came off the bench all six games after he returned.\n\nNo. 3 Phoenix vs. No. 6 Portland\n\nThe Phoenix Suns enter the playoffs having won 14 of their last 16 games, the team's best stretch drive since guard Steve Nash returned to the desert in 2004.\n\nNash, who is averaging 16.5 PPG and 11.0 APG, isn't the only Sun who has been shining lately. Forward Amare Stoudemire is playing the best basketball of his career, averaging 26.6 PPG since the all-star break.\n\nMeanwhile, Phoenix's opponent, the Portland Trail Blazers are limping into the first round.\n\nGuard Brandon Roy has been ruled out of the series after having knee surgery on Friday. Portland's leading scorer will be replaced by Rudy Fernandez.\n\nNo. 4 Denver vs. No. 5 Utah\n\nForward Andrei Kirilenko will miss Utah's first-round playoff series against Denver after aggravating his strained left calf during a workout Thursday, making it harder for the Jazz to guard Nuggets all-star Carmelo Anthony.\n\nThe Nuggets will surely search for ways to exploit his absence, but having Anthony fire up more shots isn't the response acting coach Adrian Dantley wants.\n\n\"I think 'Melo shoots enough shots already,\" said Dantley, who went 11-8 in place of George Karl, who is recovering from treatment for throat cancer.\n\nDenver forward Kenyon Martin should also benefit from the absence of Kirilenko, since the lanky Russian is a challenge on both ends of the floor. Although Martin (9.4 RPG) has been having one of his best seasons in years, he also missed 18 games this season with a bad left knee.\n\nThe Jazz should have Carlos Boozer back in the lineup for the start of the series, which will shore up their defence somewhat."
