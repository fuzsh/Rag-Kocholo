        "text": "LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh make it look easy. The Miami Heat were christened July 8, 2010, when James announced the formation of Heat President Pat Riley's super team. It took a year, but the Heat delivered.\n\nMiami has faced seven teams in the playoffs the last two seasons, beating all but one and the Boston Celtics twice. The Heat have evolved since they dropped the 2010 NBA Finals to the Dallas Mavericks, adding key support while their three stars grow comfortable together.\n\nThe Heat are not invincible. They have lost at least one game in each of their eight playoff series the last two seasons. The Celtics took them to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals last season. The star-less Indiana Pacers gave them a scare with Bosh sidelined by injury.\n\nWinning a championship in June wasn't easy for the Heat. They faced injury and unpredictability from stars and role players alike. But Riley bolstered the roster again this offseason, adding former All-Stars Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis while bringing back most of the contributors from the title run. The Heat have the shooters in place to stretch the floor and open the lane for their stars while building on the elite defensive identity coach Erik Spoelstra developed last season.\n\nSo who can top the champions? USA TODAY Sports evaluates how the contenders match up:\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\nOnly two teams in the last 23 seasons have won a title the season after losing in the Finals: the Los Angeles Lakers in 2009 and the Heat last season. But the Thunder might be primed to join the fray.\n\nOklahoma City did not fall apart in its loss to Miami. Nor did the Thunder appear physically overmatched. They lost for all of the reasons a good, young team loses: immature mistakes, lacking aggressiveness, bad calls and sporadic shooting.\n\nThe Thunder made a move toward even more youth this offseason, cutting loose veterans Derek Fisher, Nazr Mohammed and Royal Ivey. Those decisions show general manager Sam Presti's confidence in a group that went to the Western Conference finals in 2011 and the NBA Finals last season. They also show Presti's confidence in Kevin Durant, James' top challenger for the title of best player in the world. Durant has plenty of help in Russell Westbrook, James Harden and others, but this is his team to guide.\n\nDurant has a deep competitive streak, manifested not in teeth-baring facial tics but dominant play in key moments. He came up big too late too often against Miami, forcing Oklahoma City into deep holes before kicking into high gear. Coach Scott Brooks will be responsible for reining in Westbrook, getting more consistent performances from Harden and figuring out which big-men rotations work best. But Durant self-motivates, measuring himself against James and the Heat, be it during the Finals, Team USA practices or their offseason workouts.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nThe Heat can't guard Dwight Howard. They likely will start Bosh at center, and their best hope at guarding the Lakers' new star might be offensively inept Joel Anthony.\n\nThe Lakers' myriad offseason moves were made with the intent of returning the team to contender status, but there was a stylistic wink to the Heat mixed in. The Lakers added the only player in the league the Heat can't match up against properly.\n\nLos Angeles' offseason moves didn't end with Howard; Steve Nash provides an elite playmaker, and the bench is deeper and more versatile this season. But Howard makes the team most dangerous to the Heat. He is too big and strong for James or Bosh and too talented to ignore. Should these teams meet in the Finals — no guarantee because the Thunder boast defensive-minded big men capable of slowing Howard and a growing reputation as a thorn in Jerry Buss' side — Spoelstra must find a solution, through double-teams or post-fronting or fouling.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the Lakers would cakewalk to the title. Assigned to James would be Metta World Peace, but his erratic play and behavior make him a surreal choice to defend the best player in the world. James and Wade are capable of switching off on Kobe Bryant, containing the shot-happy Lakers star with physical, athletic and aggressive defense. A Lakers-Heat Finals matchup would be ABC's ratings dream, but it would also match clashing styles in a basketball science experiment.\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nThe Bulls are the best bet to knock off the Heat in the Eastern Conference playoffs. But that hope hangs on Derrick Rose's recovery. The 2010-11 NBA MVP will miss at least a few months of the regular season as his knee heals, and a return at less than 100% won't help the Bulls' chances. Chicago has the firepower to make the playoffs without Rose but wouldn't stand a chance against Miami.\n\nEven with Rose, the Bulls will need help. Carlos Boozer has struggled in the postseason, but pairing him and Joakim Noah down low is Chicago's biggest advantage on Miami. Coach Tom Thibodeau will have to decide whether to use Rose on Wade or play Kirk Hinrich at shooting guard, because his better offensive options there — Richard Hamilton, Marco Belinelli and Nate Robinson — are weak defenders.\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nThe Heat have eliminated the Celtics the last two seasons, and last spring's seven-game series and Allen's defection have created bad blood. The Celtics aren't as talented as the Heat, but they match up very well against them. Losing Allen might even help, as he couldn't defend Wade and forced point guard Rajon Rondo into difficult defensive assignments.\n\nBoston will be younger this season, and players such as free agent Courtney Lee and Avery Bradley, who missed the playoffs last season, should help on the wings. But Bosh will be back for the Heat, who struggled to defend Kevin Garnett last spring until Bosh returned to the lineup full time in Game 6.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\nThe Spurs have posted the West's best record the last two seasons, but they haven't had much of a crack at the Heat. Miami won last season's lone matchup, and they split two games in 2010-11.\n\nThe Spurs use a deep rotation and a devastatingly efficient offensive attack based on balance and passing. They couldn't hang with the Heat in individual battles, but coach Gregg Popovich is the best in the business, and his team follows orders well. Still, the Heat can grind the pace of games because of their isolation sets and staunch defense, and the Spurs would struggle against them in the halfcourt.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers\n\nThe Clippers' stars are hurting. They're always hurting. Blake Griffin and Chris Paul limped through the playoffs and last season, were injured in U.S. Olympic practices. during the summer. But the Clippers have built around those stars as well as any team in the NBA with veterans — Chauncey Billups, Caron Butler, Grant Hill and Jamal Crawford — and young players — DeAndre Jordan, Eric Bledsoe and Trey Thompkins.\n\nHealth derailed this team last season, but the roster was improved and deepened in the offseason. The Clippers can throw more solid defenders and experienced players at the Heat's Big Three than any other team, which makes them a serious threat — if they can stay on the court.\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\nThe Pacers gave the Heat a scare in the second round last season, thanks largely to Bosh's abdominal strain. The six-game series featured several flagrant fouls and raised spirits as critics suggested the Pacers were in the Heat's heads. Psychobabble aside, Indiana has a balanced lineup that stayed mostly intact this offseason.\n\nThe Pacers could use Rose's injury to usurp the Bulls atop the Central Division and grab a high seed, leading to a potential East finals meeting with Miami. Roy Hibbert might be the best 7-footer in the East, and Paul George and Danny Granger are versatile wings capable of matching up with Wade and James.\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nThe only team to beat these Heat in a playoff series has taken a few hits the last two offseasons. But the Mavericks have Dirk Nowitzki, perhaps the most dangerous scorer in the NBA, when he returns from knee rehabilitation.\n\nChris Kaman can defend the paint better than last season's Dallas center rotation, and O.J. Mayo could blossom in a starting role. Shawn Marion remains one of the best defensive answers the league has for James.\n\nThe Mavericks have gone from champions to dark horses, but they are capable of getting on a roll at any time."
