        "text": "In 2016, veteran center Nazr Mohammed signed with the Thunder and filled a final roster spot. This time around, he’s back in a front office role.\n\nIn a piece on The Players’ Tribune on Monday, Mohammed officially announced that he accepted a position as a professional evaluation scout (identification and intelligence) for the Thunder. Mohammed, 40, started his role in late November, when The Oklahoman reported that the Thunder created a new initiative for former players to help create education for off-court careers.\n\nMohammed, the first former player to participate in the curriculum, has a relationship with Thunder general manager Sam Presti that goes back to San Antonio. Mohammed played for the Spurs two seasons (2004-05, 2005-06) and Presti was the assistant general manager in 2005 when the Spurs won the NBA Championship.\n\nThat relationship was influential in Mohammed pursuing a front-office position, and influential in him joining the Thunder in 2010, then again in 2016. Mohammed played 92 career regular-season games in Oklahoma City, averaging 3.7 points and 3.2 rebounds per game.\n\nIn The Players’ Tribune piece (you can read here), Mohammed said one of his goals is to become an NBA general manager.\n\n“This is a great opportunity to learn all the aspects of the business and become a well-rounded basketball executive,” Mohammed wrote.\n\n“When you see me at an arena from here on out, you’ll know what I’m up to.”\n\nAfter a year off from the NBA, Mohammed didn't just jump back into the game. He savored his retirement, attending his kids' events and driving them back and forth in the family's home city of Charlotte. But Mohammed came to the realization \"there's only so much time you can idle.\"\n\n\"There's only so much golf you can play,\" Mohammed said. \"I know, because I’ve tried. I brought my handicap down with dedicated practice, but that brought only so much fulfillment. Basketball will always be my first love. Everyone I knew was still on the grind — working at their craft. The only people golfing in the middle of the day were 25 years older than me. It lit a fire under me. I needed to get back to the grind. Because the grind is what I do best.\""
