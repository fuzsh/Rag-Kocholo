        "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. — If you think a front-office soap opera and the specter of LeBron James having him fired on a whim will rattle Frank Vogel, the improbable new head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, you’ve probably never heard his backstory.\n\nAll it took for Vogel to give up his playing career at Division III Juniata College, load everything he owned into a rickety Ford Fiesta and clickity-clack his way from Huntingdon, Pa., to the University of Kentucky in the summer of 1994 was a total rejection from Rick Pitino. Vogel wanted to become a coach, and the kid from South Jersey could not imagine a better cradle for that career than at the mecca of college basketball, studying under a man who’d previously been the coach of the New York Knicks. First, he wrote Pitino a pile of letters asking if he could walk on as a Wildcat or be a student manager or, hell, clean toilets if that’s what it took to be in the same gym with a future Hall of Famer. Pitino never replied.\n\n“He probably never read them,” says Tony Russell, a student manager at Kentucky in the mid-1990s. “Those letters probably got thrown straight in the trash by his secretary. That’s just the reality of it. Everyone was writing letters back then asking how they could be part of our program.” Steve Prohm, now the coach at Iowa State, had also written a bunch of letters around that time and been ignored. “But that’s the difference between Frank and everybody else,” says Russell. “He just wouldn’t give up. Whenever I tell his story, I demonstrate a karate kick. He was not welcome — he was turned away over and over — but he did more than just keep knocking on the door. He kicked it down.”\n\nWhen the letter-writing campaign failed, Vogel orchestrated a bump-in with Pitino and UK assistant Jim O’Brien at the famous Five-Star camp in New York. He made his pitch with the same kind of confidence he’d demonstrated as a kid on the David Letterman Show in 1986, when he spun a basketball on the end of a toothbrush that was in his mouth. It didn’t matter that he had no experience and was talking to two men who both would become the coach of the Boston Celtics. “I can help you,” he swore.\n\n“Sorry,” they told him, “we don’t need any help.”\n\nThe blow-off had been exceedingly polite, though, and that might’ve been a mistake. Vogel didn’t need much encouragement.\n\n“They said something like, ‘If you’re ever in Lexington, stop by and say hello,’” Russell says. “It was a friendly way of saying, ‘Shoo, kid.’ Well, that’s not how Frank took it. That was like a silver lining to him. Frank took that as, If I’m welcome to stop by, I’m going to pack up, transfer from school and show up at Kentucky. So he drove tiny, two-door hatchback Fiesta – he and Mark Pope had the two crappiest cars in our program – all the way from New Jersey that summer. He hadn’t even enrolled as a student and didn’t have a place to live. He just thought, They said stop by, so if I show up, they’ll let me in the door.”\n\nAnd then one day, Vogel did just show up, unannounced, outside Memorial Coliseum. His grand plan was to wait for Pitino and O’Brien to arrive. Or Bill Keightley, the legendary equipment manager. And beg them all for a job. Any job. Again. And again and again and again. Until one of them got sick enough of seeing him that they either called the police or put him to work.\n\n“Frank didn’t take no for an answer,” Russell says. “Before organized practices started in the fall, the student managers helped facilitate pick-up games. Frank would show up and try to play in those games. It was ridiculous. They were technically open gyms — by NCAA rules, they weren’t supposed to be organized events for our team — but they were essentially private games for our players only and maybe Rex Chapman and other alumni. You couldn’t tell Frank that he didn’t belong. He showed up with just crazy ambition, like, Why can’t I? We all thought he was out of his mind. I guess he kind of was.”\n\nKeightley, who had told Vogel repeatedly the Wildcats didn’t need any more student managers for the 1994-95 season, was the first to surrender in that war of persistence.\n\n“Frank showed up every day,” says Dave Bolen, another student manager at the time, “until finally Mr. Keightley was like, OK, come on; we’ll find something for you to do.”\n\nThe rest really is history. In short order, O’Brien and Pitino also found plenty for Vogel to do. In a matter of months, he went from stalker status to a trusted member of the Kentucky basketball family.\n\n“At first, the players were like, Who is this guy out in the parking lot?” former Kentucky All-American Scott Padgett recalls, howling with laughter at how preposterous the story still sounds. “Next thing you know, he’s one of our managers. Within a year, he became Jim O’Brien’s video slave, breaking down film and cutting up edits. And then they say, ‘Hey, we need you to play point guard on this JV team we put together for no other reason than to get Nazr Mohammed some minutes so he can be ready for next year.’ He said yes to that in a heartbeat. So it didn’t take long for him to have a hand in everything we did. That’s what I remember about Frank: He was busy at all times. He didn’t have a social life. He was there to work, to learn how to be a coach. He knew the road wasn’t paved for him, that he had to clear the path.”\n\nThere was a little luck involved too. From the moment he arrived, Vogel had been trying to charm O’Brien (“I’m a Jersey guy, you’re a Philly guy, we know the same people!”), the assistant Pitino trusted most to scout opponents. And during the 1995-96 national championship season, Vogel caught a big break. Kentucky had bought a digital video editing system called Avid that no one in the program, not even the full-time video coordinator, knew how to use. This was at a time when student managers would drive for hours to swap VHS tapes of game footage with other programs.\n\n“O’Brien asked Frank, ‘Do you know anything about this?’ Frank knew nothing about computers, much less this system. But of course he said, ‘Yeah, sure, I can help,’” Russell remembers with a snort. “So then he had to teach himself how to use it and how to edit video. And he did. That was his opening. He started helping with all the film work, anything the coaches needed to see or wanted to show the team, and that turned out to be his ticket to success beyond all reasonable expectation.”\n\nWhen Pitino and O’Brien left for the Celtics in 1997, they took Vogel with them as video coordinator. He worked under O’Brien as an assistant coach in Boston, Philadelphia and Indiana, where he earned his first NBA head-coaching shot as his mentor’s replacement with the Pacers in 2011. None of that happens without a series of absolutely audacious moves — and a tireless pursuit of knowledge that followed each of them — a quarter-century ago.\n\nCameron Mills, a former walk-on famous for the Shot Heard Round the Bluegrass against Duke in the 1998 Elite Eight, was Vogel’s roommate at Kentucky and still marvels at how little sleep he required. Vogel practiced with that junior varsity squad at 6 every morning, then went to class during the day and juggled student manager and video editing duties deep into the night. He carried around a notebook in which he scribbled motivational quotes as he came across them. He decorated his walls in the Wildcat Lodge with posters spouting more of the same. Several of his old friends remember one in particular:\n\nEvery morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning, a lion wakes up. It knows it must outrun the slowest gazelle or it will starve to death. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a lion or gazelle – when the sun comes up, you’d better be running.\n\nOh, and there were the movies. Whenever Vogel finally did drift off to sleep, he did so with “Hoosiers” playing in the background.\n\n“He so loved basketball and so wanted to coach, he put that on every night before his head hit the pillow,” Mills says. “You know how some people fall asleep to the sound of rain? Frank Vogel fell asleep to ‘Hoosiers.’ Every night.”\n\nHe also wore out his VHS tapes of the “Rocky” films, which made perfect sense to his new friends in Lexington.\n\n“Frank always wanted to watch an underdog who overcomes everything to get to do what he loves,” Bolen says. “Because that’s his story in a nutshell.”\n\nMills was getting a haircut when his phone started blowing up with text messages that Vogel had been hired by the Lakers on May 11. He was surprised. Confused. Vogel had been fired by both the Pacers and the Orlando Magic in his first two head-coaching stints. Now he was headed to one of the NBA’s most prestigious franchises?\n\n“As an assistant coach?” Mills first thought. No, the big whistle. “I was so excited, I started telling everyone. I was telling my hairdresser, who could not care less. But to see a guy work his butt off 20 years ago for one goal, just to be a coach, and know all the hours of discipline that took, all the sacrifices and risks that took, and now he’s coaching Showtime and LeBron James? We’re all just ecstatic.”\n\nWe includes Pitino, the man who brushed a kid aside more than once all those years ago. For a man with one of the most impressive coaching trees in basketball, Vogel might now be the biggest branch.\n\n“He started at the bottom and worked his way up the ladder of success,” Pitino wrote The Athletic in a text message from Greece, where he is coaching a professional team. “He did it learning every nuance of scouting, game-planning and teaching all aspects of the game. He understands how to get the most out of people by treating them professionally, with dignity and respect. I’ve run out of superlatives when describing Frank’s accomplishments. Humble and hardworking, he deserves nothing but the best out of basketball.”\n\nThat’s not how most would describe the dysfunction Vogel is inheriting with the Lakers, but perhaps his crooked path to Tinseltown has prepared him for whatever is coming. When you’ve had to abandon that broken-down Ford Fiesta on the side of the road halfway between Lexington and Boston on your way to your first NBA job, what’s a little front-office drama and an overbearing superstar?\n\n“All the noise around their franchise, I don’t think Frank cares and I don’t think he’ll be affected by it,” Russell says. “I think everybody will latch onto him and his personality. He’s one of those people that when you’re around him, his energy rubs off on you. Hopefully, for the Lakers, it will cut through some of that negativity and drama they’ve got going on. If anybody can succeed out there, absolutely it would be Frank Vogel.”\n\n(Photo of Frank Vogel, left, and Tony Russell: Courtesy of Tony Russell)"
