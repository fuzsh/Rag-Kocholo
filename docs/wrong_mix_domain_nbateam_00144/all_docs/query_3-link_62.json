        "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. \"” Tyler Ulis enjoyed a comfortable childhood in Lima, Ohio, guided by his mother and stepdad.\n\nThough barely taller than Muggsy Bogues, he showed promise on the basketball court. Eventually, he figured, he might get a scholarship offer from Michigan State, where he cheered on cousin Travis Walton at nearly every home game.\n\n\"œMy dream school,\" Ulis said.\n\nBut Ulis wanted more. He moved in with his father so he could attend Marian Catholic in Chicago Heights.\n\n\"œBetter competition,\" Ulis explained. \"œLima is a small city. Chicago is a big city with a lot of publicity. We had guys like Jahlil (Okafor), Paul White, Jalen Brunson \"¦ it helped me get better.\"\n\nAs he grew to a listed 5-foot-9 \"” on his tippy toes \"” Ulis hit the jackpot, rising from mid-major prospect to being courted by Northwestern, DePaul and Iowa to an offer from Spartans coach Tom Izzo, whom Ulis said he \"œloved.\"\n\nBut, again, Ulis wanted more.\n\nMore was Kentucky, the best of the best, a program with a fan base that would pack a gym in Siberia and a coach, John Calipari, who floods the NBA with high-end talent.\n\n\"œComing here,\" Ulis said, \"œI felt like I could be the best player I could be. Cal has had guards like John Wall, Derrick Rose and (Eric) Bledsoe. Going against Andrew (Harrison) every day is helping me grow a lot as a player.\"\n\nUlis has been terrific for the 27-0 Wildcats. Teammate Karl-Anthony Towns called him \"œa showtime player.\"\n\n\"œHe knows how to make the ball go from side to side. He can score. He is the whole package,\" Towns said. \"œThat\"™s why everyone loves him, not just because of his size but because of what he can do with it.\"\n\nUlis is making Calipari look wise for extending a Chicago-Kentucky connection that stretches to the Rick Pitino era (1989-97) and Mount Carmel\"™s Antoine Walker.\n\n\"œI broke ground,\" recalled Walker, a three-time NBA All-Star who\"™s now an analyst for 120 Sports. \"œI got there first, and then Nazr (Mohammed) came down to visit.\"\n\nThe success of versatile forward Jamal Mashburn, who developed into the No. 4 pick in the NBA draft, helped sell Walker.\n\nMohammed, who attended Kenwood, turned down Georgetown because he knew he would have to transform his 300-plus-pound frame to thrive in Pitino\"™s full-court press.\n\n\"œAs stupid as I was,\" joked Mohammed, now a backup center on the Bulls, \"œI thought I wanted the challenge.\"\n\nOn his visit to Lexington, Kentucky beat Georgia 80-59, but Pitino was so furious at his team for defensive lapses, he closed the locker room to recruits and wrote \"œ12:01\" on a greaseboard. That meant the players would have to return to practice one minute after midnight, to comply with NCAA rules.\n\nEveryone figured Mohammed would be turned off by the extreme behavior, but he committed anyway and played before, as he called them, \"œ24,000 screaming fans in blue and white.\"\n\n\"œThere\"™s no better place to play college basketball than Rupp Arena,\" Mohammed said.\n\nAnd there was no better team in 1996 than Kentucky.\n\n\"œGood things happen when Chicago guys go to Lexington,\" Mohammed said. \"œMe and Antoine won a championship down there.\"\n\nSo did Anthony Davis in 2012, his first season out of Chicago\"™s Perspectives Charter.\n\nRose went to the NCAA title game in 2008 playing for Calipari at Memphis. The Simeon graduate said he chose Memphis in part because he would be joining a team of quality veterans and in part because of his coach.\n\n\"œCal was great for me,\" he said. \"œIf he was at Kentucky, there\"™s a good chance I would have gone to Kentucky.\"\n\nAs for Calipari\"™s mining of Chicago, Rose responded: \"œWith all that great talent, you would have to be crazy as a college coach not to make that connection. Jahlil will probably be the No. 1 pick (in the NBA draft), and last year you had Jabari (Parker).\"\n\nSaid Calipari: \"œChicago players have a fight and a will to win. They have all been solid kids and great teammates. We haven\"™t gotten everyone we have gone after, but the ones we did get were fun to coach.\"\n\nSt. Rita\"™s Charles Matthews is next, giving Kentucky the potential for an all-Chicago backcourt next season. Ulis and Matthews also teamed up for the MeanStreets AAU program.\n\n\"œI watched them together and thought: Tyler is the perfect kind of guard for Charles because Charles can just do his thing,\" Calipari said. \"œIf you\"™re making (Matthews) do too much, he\"™s not ready for that yet offensively.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Matthews has slid in the recruiting rankings to 57th nationally in the 247Sports.com composite. That\"™s second in the state behind the Villanova-bound Brunson but low enough that some question whether he can cut it at Kentucky.\n\n\"œI don\"™t care where people have people ranked,\" Calipari said. \"œIt\"™s who I like and who I want to coach.\"\n\nAsked what he saw in Matthews, Calipari replied: \"œI loved his competitiveness and his fight. I loved how he is a multiple-position guy. Last summer, they tried to play him at point guard. That\"™s not what he is. He\"™s a playmaker off the ball. He\"™s a slasher. He\"™s a finisher. I loved his body and his ability to defend.\"\n\nSaid Ulis: \"œI can\"™t wait till he gets here. He is a great defensive player. Offensively, he can jump, he\"™s athletic and he can score the ball.\"\n\nWalker, the man who started it all, visited the Wildcats in December. Although he played for Pitino, who coaches at rival Louisville, Walker said he got some \"œquality time\" with Calipari \"” and talked Chicago hoops with Ulis.\n\n\"œI saw him play in high school,\" Walker said. \"œHe\"™s small, but he has a future (in the NBA). He reminds me of Maurice Cheeks, a smaller version.\"\n\n\"”\"”\"”\n\nÂ©2015 Chicago Tribune\n\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC\n\n_____\n\nTopics: t000003277,t000003183,t000003278,t000032883,t000040464,t000032881,g000216305,g000065560,g000065650,g000362661,g000066164"
