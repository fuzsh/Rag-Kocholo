Despite the rigors of three decades on the hardwood, Nazr’s body has held up. Off the court, the Chicago native has been training for a broadcasting career and has other aspirations.\n\nWith a stockpile of frontcourt players, the Bulls, barring a trade, are likely no longer an option for Mohammed. But if Nazr has to go elsewhere, he’ll be quite selective."
