        "text": "Nazr Mohammed expects straight A’s from his three kids, so it was only fair that he be transparent with his grades this semester.\n\n“It was a chance for me to brag,” Mohammed said, “and tell them that not only do we expect it from them, but we believe in walking the walk.”\n\nMohammed planned to walk across the stage at Rupp Arena this weekend and collect his diploma. Twenty-five years after enrolling at the University of Kentucky, the former Thunder center has graduated with a degree in liberal arts and a business minor.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic postponed commencement ceremonies, so Mohammed celebrated at home with his wife, his daughters — 17 and 10 — and his 14-year-old son.\n\n“I showed them all my grades,” Mohammed said with a proud laugh.\n\nHis “A” average met the family standard.\n\nAfter winning national championships in 1996 and 1998, Mohammed left Kentucky following his junior season. He was picked 29th overall in the 1998 draft, and then began an 18-year NBA career.\n\nMohammed played for eight teams, but his stops in San Antonio and Oklahoma City were most memorable. He won a championship with the Spurs in 2005, and played for another in 2012 with the Thunder. He retired in 2016 after a brief second stint in OKC.\n\nMohammed now works in the Thunder front office as a scout.\n\n“The last thing he needs is a degree,” said Katie Eiserman, associate athletic director for development at Kentucky, “but on his resume he really wanted to check that box.”\n\nHis kids were one inspiration, but there was another.\n\n“I consider myself part of the University of Kentucky family and I consider myself alumni,” Mohammed said. “And technically I wasn't, not being a graduate. I always kind of felt that it was hanging over my head.”\n\nMohammed and Eisermann connected in college as two transplants from Chicago.\n\nEiserman, a year younger than Mohammed, played volleyball for the Wildcats.\n\n“He just busted his tail, and I remember respecting him so much because I was a little bit of a gym rat back then, too,” Eiserman said. “He was never a limelight guy, which is just amazing. He's always Nazr. That's why I appreciated him.”\n\nWhen Mohammed was considering a return to school, he contacted Eiserman. He lacked just 18 credit hours, and Eiserman told him about a new online program.\n\nMohammed lives in Charlotte, N.C., and travels frequently for his job, so returning to campus wasn’t a viable option. And Eiserman would needle him that he couldn’t have a North Carolina school on his resume.\n\nMohammed committed to the program, and completed his last exam Wednesday.\n\n“It's something that I didn't think would mean so much to me until now that I'm actually finishing up,” Mohammed said.\n\nBut maybe he’s not quite finished.\n\nEiserman said Mohammed is already considering more classes.\n\n“Hey, Dr. Mohammed,” she joked. “We were just trying to get one degree here, dude. Now you're gonna get two? I'm just so proud of him.”\n\nMohammed has been overwhelmed by congratulatory messages. He wrote an essay in the Players’ Tribune about his journey back to school.\n\nAnd on Saturday, graduation day, he shared a clip of his name being read as a graduate of Kentucky’s College of Arts & Sciences.\n\n“I like to not be seen as a stereotypical athlete,” Mohammed said. “Just the perception of a lot of us guys who have left school early is that education doesn't mean anything to us, that all we wanted to do was play basketball. It's so far from the truth.”"
