        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nCharlotte Bobcats centres Nazr Mohammed and Tyson Chandler have returned to practice following injuries.\n\nA team spokesman says both players will be listed as game-time decisions for Friday’s game against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nMohammed has missed the past five games with severe back spasms. Chandler has sat out seven straight games with left foot and ankle pain. The injuries have left recently acquired Theo Ratliff as Charlotte’s starting centre.\n\nBig man DeSagana Diop was limited in practice Thursday as he works his way back from a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee."
