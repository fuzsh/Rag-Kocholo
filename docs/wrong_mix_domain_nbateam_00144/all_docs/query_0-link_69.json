        "text": "Breaking News\n\nTUESDAY’S GAMES\n\nLakers 101, Mavericks 81: Kobe Bryant had 23 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in his 19th career triple-double, and host Los Angeles beat Dallas in a key game for the two teams struggling to get into the Western Conference playoff picture.\n\nDwight Howard had 24 points and 12 rebounds while hitting seven fourth-quarter free throws for the Lakers, who had lost four of six before jumping to a big early lead on Dallas and hanging on to it throughout the second half.\n\nWith former coach Phil Jackson in attendance for Shaquille O’Neal’s jersey retirement, Bryant put on a virtuoso performance while playing more than 47 minutes. With the win, Los Angeles moved back into an eighth-place tie in the West with the Utah Jazz, which holds the tiebreaker edge on the Lakers.\n\nMavericks owner Mark Cuban says he would consider drafting Baylor All-American Brittney Griner. Cuban told reporters before the game that if Griner is the best player available, “I will take her.” Griner, 6-foot-8, finished her college career as the NCAA leader in blocked shots and the second-leading scorer in women’s college basketball history.\n\nWizards 90, Bulls 86: John Wall had 27 points, nine assists and eight rebounds, Emeka Okafor scored the go-ahead dunk in the final minute and Washington won its eighth straight home game, beating Chicago.\n\nCarlos Boozer had 19 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Bulls.\n\nOne of the Bulls’ biggest challenges was having enough players to finish the game. Taj Gibson left in the first half with a left knee injury and did not return, and Kirk Hinrich was tossed with 3:19 to play for picking up two technicals after teammate Nazr Mohammed was called for basket interference while tipping in a rebound.\n\nNotes: Former NBA player and Atlanta native Javaris Crittenton was indicted on charges of murder and gang activity. The Fulton County District Attorney’s office said Crittenton, 25, and his cousin, Douglas Gamble, were charged in a 12-count indictment in the death of an Atlanta woman and the attempted murder of another man in August 2011.\n\nGreg Willard, a longtime NBA referee who worked more than 1,600 games before he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, has died. He was 54.\n\n— ASSOCIATED PRESS"
