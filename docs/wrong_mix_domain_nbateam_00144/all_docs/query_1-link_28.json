When I got to the Oklahoma City Thunder, it was so separated. You had Eric Maynor, Russell Westbrook and James Harden… and Daequan Cook. They had their little clique and they kicked it with each other. Then you had KD who as just by himself. He didn’t even hang with them.”\n\nJoe Mussatto: More OKC staffing news: Former Thunder point guard Eric Maynor is moving from the Blue staff to the Thunder staff as a player development coach. And another former Thunder, Anthony Morrow, is taking a one-year position as lifestyle services and engagement associate.\n\nBrandon Rahbar: Former OKC backup point guard Eric Maynor has been hired as a Player Development Coach with the Thunder. From Royal Ivey to Nick Collison to Maynor, OKC has a history of hiring past players to their staff. Still waiting on the Mitch McGary as the Player Munchies Coach hire. pic.twitter.com/AsAV8ZBI0s"
