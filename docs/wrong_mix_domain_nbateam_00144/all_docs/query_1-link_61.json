        "text": "Series heads east for next — games\n\nPHILADELPHIA - The NBA Finals have moved a long way from Los Angeles to a city where fans are obnoxious, not pretentious, a city where it's considered appropriate to boo your own grandmother if she forgets to call you on your birthday.\n\nIt's a city where they once booed Santa Claus, a city where fans came up to Milwaukee coach George Karl in the lobby of his hotel last week and heckled him and his players right to their faces.\n\n\"I think it's been misnamed. It was called the 'City of Brotherly Love,' wasn't it? I haven't felt a lot of that love from Philadelphia over the last few years,\" Lakers coach Phil Jackson said.\n\nThe Finals are tied at one game apiece after the Lakers defeated the 76ers 98-89 Friday night.\n\nBoth teams spent yesterday traveling across the countr getting some rest before the series resumes tonight at 7:30 for Game 3.\n\n\"I think both games have been phenomenal games for our league, and I'm just proud of our team making this a competitive series,\" 76ers coach Larry Brown said.\n\nNo two NBA cities could be much more dissimilar than Los Angeles and Philadelphia, a continent apart and a world away from each other.\n\nWhile the Lakers give the best seat in the house to Jack Nicholson, the 76ers prefer to usher the big shots to luxury boxes and save the best seats for their most loyal regulars.\n\nLos Angeles has the gorgeous and famous Laker Girls Philadelphia has, for some unknown reason, a rabbit mascot named Hip-Hop with a dwarf sidekick known as Lil' G.\n\nIn L.A., they call it smog. In Philly, they call it pollution.\n\nIn Los Angeles, they burn cars when they win championships. In Philadelphia, they only burn cars on days that end in the letter \"y\" - and then they leave the carcass out in public view for the next few months.\n\nOne city was home to last year's Republican National Convention. The other played host to the Democrats. Last we checked, those two parties recently had a closely contested series, too. Believe it went into overtime.\n\nThe Lakers made their most recent trip to Philadelphia in February following the All-Star break and lost by 15 points, 112-97, after playing an overtime game against New Jersey the previous night. It was the third of four East Coast road trips the Lakers made during the regular season, and it came at the peak of their disharmon dysfunction.\n\nMuch has changed, not the least of which is Philadelphia's addition of Dikembe Mutombo. The last time the Lakers were in town, Shaquille O'Neal's primary defender was the now-departed Nazr Mohammed.\n\nSince the NBA switched to a 2-3-2 format in 1985, no team has swept the middle three games at home.\n\nThe Lakers spent a week in Indianapolis at this time last year, losing twice and winning once in overtime as O'Neal complained about the cramped quarters in his hotel room. They then finished off the Pacers in Game 6 at the Staples Center.\n\nTo win a second straight title, they need to play the same kind of game they did Friday night and get big numbers from O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and a third player. In Game 2, that third threat was Derek Fisher.\n\nFisher clung to Allen Iverson's jersey like lint throughout Game 2, grabbing him and entangling his arms with Iverson's in an effort to frustrate Philadelphia's best player.\n\nThat frustration was evident in the second minute of Game 2, when Iverson jabbed an elbow at Fisher a step or two past midcourt and was hit with an offensive foul.\n\nThe winner of Game — will seize the momentum and hang onto it a little longer because there will be two days off before Game 4 Wednesday.\n\nGame 5 is Friday night, by which time O'Neal will have had a chance to view the Liberty Bell, Jackson will have had a chance to tour Independence Hall and Bryant will have been able to return to his old stomping grounds in Lower Merion.\n\nBarring a three-game sweep by either team, the series will return to Los Angeles, where the LAPD has vowed not to allow a repeat of last June's post-championship rampage. They promise to be as tough as Philly cops."
