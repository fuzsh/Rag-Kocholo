        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Andrew Bynum had 17 points and 14 rebounds, Lamar Odom scored 19 points and Phil Jackson became the winningest coach in Lakers history in Los Angeles’ 99-97 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats on Wednesday night.\n\nPau Gasol and Ron Artest scored 14 points apiece for the Lakers, who returned from an eight-game trip to improve the NBA’s best home record to 24-3 with their eighth consecutive victory at Staples Center.\n\nStephen Jackson scored 30 points for the Bobcats, who played without injured All-Star Gerald Wallace in the finale of a six-game trip.\n\nThe Bobcats had won three straight road games against the Lakers, but couldn’t capitalize on a season-low five-point performance by Kobe Bryant, who appeared to injure his left foot when Odom stepped on it late in the first half.\n\nBryant returned to play extensively in the second half, but sat out another key late stretch and didn’t score in the fourth quarter of his first single-digit scoring game of the season.\n\nJackson passed Pat Riley with his 534th win with the Lakers. The Hall of Famer won 545 games and six titles in nine seasons with the Chicago Bulls before winning four more rings in his first nine seasons with the Lakers, rising to fifth on the NBA’s career coaching victories list by passing Charlotte’s Larry Brown earlier this season.\n\nJackson is the winningest playoff coach in NBA history, and the only coach to win more than 70 percent of his regular-season games.\n\nNeither team took a lead larger than seven points in the first three quarters, with the Bobcats constantly staying close to the Lakers on big baskets from Stephen Jackson. Nazr Mohammed’s fallaway jumper with 1:38 to play trimmed Los Angeles’ lead to 93-92, but Pau Gasol responded with a quick hook shot before blocking Jackson’s driving layup.\n\nAfter Odom tipped home Artest’s layup, Bryant missed a 3-pointer with 20 seconds left to give the Bobcats a final chance to tie. But Jordan Farmar forced a turnover on Jackson’s inbounds pass from midcourt and made a fast-break dunk on a pass from Gasol with 4.5 seconds left.\n\nFlip Murray made a 3-pointer with 1.2 seconds left to trim the final margin.\n\nThe Lakers hadn’t been home since beating Orlando on Jan. 18. The defending champions went just 5-3 on their East Coast trip, staying atop the Western Conference but struggling against the demands of a schedule that includes four more games in the next seven days.\n\nWallace, the first All-Star in Bobcats history, strained his left hamstring late in their loss at Portland on Monday night. He skipped Wednesday’s shootaround, but wasn’t ruled out until game time, with Stephen Graham starting in his place.\n\nBryant’s eventful night began with a standing ovation from a pregame ceremony in which Lakers great Jerry West presented him with a game ball in recognition of Bryant’s ascension to the top of the Lakers’ career scoring list. Bryant passed West on Monday night during the Lakers’ loss at Memphis.\n\nBryant went to the locker room with 12.5 seconds left in the first half after Odom stepped on his left foot while both players reached for a loose ball. Bryant wasn’t moving easily even before that on his balky left ankle, struggling with his shot and failing to score until a few minutes before the injury.\n\nNOTES: Los Angeles improved to 5-6 against Charlotte in the Bobcats’ brief history. The Boston Celtics are the only other NBA franchise with a winning record against the Lakers. … The Bobcats will be back at Staples Center in 17 days to face the Clippers. … Lakers G Derek Fisher made the 1,000th 3-pointer of his career. … Courtside fans included Taylor Lautner, television host Olivia Munn and Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine."
