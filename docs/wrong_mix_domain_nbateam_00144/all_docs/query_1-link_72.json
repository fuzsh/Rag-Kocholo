        "text": "CHICAGO (AP) — Playing in Chicago as a visitor for the first time, Michael Jordan had a career-high nine turnovers and went just 7-for-21 from the floor as his new team, the Washington Wizards, beat the poor-shooting Bulls 77-69 Saturday.\n\nThe Wizards ended a four-game losing slide and got victory No. 19 — matching their total from all of last season.\n\nJordan had 16 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, two steals and two blocks. Chris Whitney led Washington with 20 points.\n\nRon Artest and Ron Mercer each scored 14 for the Bulls.\n\nChicago, the team Jordan led to six NBA championships, threatened the league record for lowest field-goal percentage. The Bulls shot 24.7 percent, just shy of the NBA low of 22.9 by Milwaukee against Minneapolis on Nov. 6, 1954.\n\nThe Bulls did set a franchise record for worst shooting percentage in a half, managing just 16.7 percent in the first half.\n\nThe fans cheered every move Jordan made early — even when he fouled Artest. When Jordan made his first basket, a 15-foot jumper over Kevin Ollie with 7:38 left in the first quarter, the fans yelled as though it were a game-winner.\n\nIt's been 3? years since Jordan walked away from the Bulls. He vowed never to play for a coach other than Phil Jackson and swore the Bulls' uniform was the only one he'd wear.\n\nBut there he was Saturday, in the blue-and-black of the Wizards right down to his Air Jordans.\n\nLakers 98, Spurs 81\n\nSAN ANTONIO — Kobe Bryant scored 17 of his 28 points in the second half to lead the Shaq-less Lakers.\n\nIt was the teams' first game since last season's Western Conference finals, when the Lakers swept the Spurs in four games en route to their second straight NBA title.\n\nOn Saturday, the Lakers broke open what had been a closely played contest by overwhelming the Spurs in the fourth quarter. They outscored the Spurs 29-18 and outrebounded them 12-4.\n\nLos Angeles went 2-1 during Shaquille O'Neal's three-game suspension for a fight against the Bulls last weekend. The Lakers' center can return Tuesday against Denver.\n\nStanislav Medvedenko scored 12 points, and Derek Fisher 11 for the Lakers. Each Los Angeles player who saw action scored at least five points.\n\nCharles Smith, starting for the injured Tony Parker, led San Antonio with 21 points, and Tim Duncan had 20 points and 15 rebounds.\n\nBucks 116, Hawks 107\n\nATLANTA — Ray Allen scored 31 points and the Milwaukee Bucks extended their winning streak to a season-high seven games with a 116-107 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night.\n\nSam Cassell, Jason Caffey and Anthony Mason added 17 apiece for the Bucks, who handed the Hawks their sixth straight loss. Milwaukee, which beat Orlando on Friday night, has now swept its past three back-to-backs.\n\nThe Bucks, who trailed by 15 at the end of the first quarter, won for the 11th time after trailing by more than 10 points. They shot 52 percent and finished with their highest point total since scoring 119 in the opener against Utah.\n\nJason Terry led Atlanta with 24 points, and Nazr Mohammed had 22 and a season-high 19 rebounds — his third straight double-double — for Atlanta.\n\nThe Hawks tied the game at 92 on two free throws by Jason Terry, but Milwaukee seized control with a 13-2 run. Caffey started the surge with two free throws and added an alley-oop dunk. Cassell scored six straight points to finish off the outburst, giving the Bucks a 105-97 lead.\n\nAtlanta, which led for most of the first three quarters, took its last lead on Dion Glover's layup early in the fourth. But Allen hit a 3-pointer to put Milwaukee back in front.\n\nMohammed dominated the first half, getting 16 points and 11 rebounds. He had been in a slump, averaging just 6.2 points in the previous 12 games."
