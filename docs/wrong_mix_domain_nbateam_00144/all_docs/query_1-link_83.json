        "text": "At the beginning of the video the Oklahoma City Thunder play before their starting lineups are announced, there's a message on the scoreboard.\n\nRESILIENCY. IT DEFINES OUR TEAM.\n\nThat was especially true during the Thunder's comeback from an 18-point deficit Wednesday night to beat the San Antonio Spurs and clinch a spot in the NBA finals. But that's only the final step in a remarkable turnaround.\n\nIt was only three seasons ago that Oklahoma City's new team was 3-29 and just hoping to avoid the worst record in NBA history.\n\nBack when Scott Brooks was hired as coach around Thanksgiving 2008, his first task was trying to get the team to be competitive in the fourth quarter. Now, opponents can't seem to put the Thunder away when it comes to crunch time.\n\n\"Even back then, we weren't losing games. I was telling the guys we were learning how to win games, and there's a big difference between that because we had guys that worked every day and it gave me hope that when we were down they were still practicing, still working hard,\" Brooks said.\n\nAll that hard work paid off with the franchise's first shot at the title since 1996 as the Seattle SuperSonics. The team's only NBA title came in 1979 back in Seattle.\n\nThe Thunder will host Game 1 of the finals Tuesday night, against either Boston or Miami.\n\n\"I'm not as excited as I thought I'd be,\" said Nick Collison, the only holdover who played in Seattle except for Kevin Durant.\n\n\"I think we all know we have more work to do.\"\n\nOklahoma City has gotten this far with a youthful core featuring homegrown first-round draft picks Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Serge Ibaka that has blended with a trio of veterans who already have championship rings -- Kendrick Perkins, Derek Fisher and Nazr Mohammed.\n\nTo get to the finals, Oklahoma City had to go through the only three teams to win the West since 1998 -- Dallas in the first round, the Los Angeles Lakers in the conference semifinals and then San Antonio.\n\n\"It's almost like a Hollywood script for OKC in a sense. ... Those three teams represent 10 of the last 13 championships, and now they're going to go to the finals and play either Boston or Miami, and that'll be 11 of the last 13 championships,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said.\n\n\"I don't know if anybody has ever had a run or gone through a playoff playing those kinds of teams. It's just incredible, and I think it's pretty cool for them.\"\n\nThe Thunder have made a steady progression since rallying to finish 23-59 that first season in Oklahoma City. After adding Harden and Ibaka the club made the playoffs and lost in the first round to the eventual champion Lakers.\n\nLast year, the Mavericks knocked out Oklahoma City in the West finals before going on to win it all.\n\n\"We've been through a lot, not just this year but first getting here, moving to Oklahoma City and losing and then the way we lost in the playoffs,\" said Durant, who has won the past three league scoring titles. \"We've been through a lot. We don't call each other family just to say it. We really believe in that.\""
