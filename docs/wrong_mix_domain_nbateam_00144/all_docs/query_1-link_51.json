        "text": "Today’s post is a very light one in nature but heavy in bytes and was sponsored by a perspective “I’ve spent way too much time searching for something which should be easy to find”. It’s also a timely topic: list of ALL NBA championship titles by players, coaches, both, rings won with different teams etc. Here are examples why this subject IMHO should be covered better: List at Wikipedia and List at NBAUniverse.com.\n\nWhy exactly 5 titles was the cut off? Nobody could be interested in players with 3 rings? Four championships wasn’t good enough to qualify or what? Am I the only one who cares about this? ;-)\n\nUPDATED after 2012 playoffs!\n\nBut let’s start with coaches because this topic is actually covered [well, there wasn’t that many of them ;-)]\n\nso I’ve only added information about coaches who won both as coaches AND as players.\n\n[All data in this post comes from http://www.basketball-reference.com]\n\nAnd now into main event… list of ALL players who were on the roster of NBA champion including information about Year and Team [in some cases multiple teams]. FYI: for convenience list was sorted by rings, then alphabetically by name and finally by championships on a single team.\n\nI should also mention this is a pretty long list ;-)\n\nBTW, please keep in mind that some small errors are possible especially regarding players who were traded mid-season."
