        "text": "One NCAA Champ Produced Nine NBA Players, and One UNC Title Team Had 12 Future Pros\n\nBy David Glenn\n\n(Part Four of a Six-Part NCAA/NBA Draft Series leading up to the June 23 NBA Draft, following Part One, Part Two and Part Three)\n\nAround the same time as this initial research, 26 years ago, made clear the powerful connection between signing and developing NBA-caliber talent and winning NCAA championships, two college teams came along and stood out in truly unprecedent ways.\n\nThe 1993 North Carolina Tar Heels, led by Hall of Fame coach Dean Smith, ultimately sent all 13 of their scholarship players into the professional basketball ranks. (Five played in the NBA, one served as an assistant coach for 17 seasons in The League, and seven competed professionally in various other domestic and/or foreign leagues.) Dating to the first NCAA champion in 1939, that had never happened previously, and because international basketball records aren’t always comprehensive, it’s not clear if or how often it’s happened since then.\n\nThe 1996 Kentucky Wildcats, led by Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino, had a whopping nine future NBA players on their roster when they won it all. (No other NCAA champion has ever had more than seven, and several had only one or two.) Six of those UK players became first-round NBA picks, a number matched only by Connecticut’s 2004 national championship team.\n\nKentucky was so loaded in 1996 (see the details below) that the player who ended up with the longest NBA career, freshman center and future first-round NBA selection Nazr Mohammed, averaged only five minutes per game that season. The Wildcats finished 34-2, 16-0 in the SEC regular season, and won their six NCAA Tournament games by an average of 21.5 points.\n\nThe 1996 Wildcats’ top five scorers, Tony Delk, Antoine Walker, Walter McCarty, Derek Anderson and Ron Mercer, each spent at least eight seasons in the NBA. Walker became a three-time all-star.\n\nThe 1993 Tar Heels made history in different ways. They, too, dominated during their championship season, with a 34-4 record, a 14-2 conference mark and a first-place finish in the ACC. They won their six NCAA Tournament games by an average of 15.7 points, although their Elite Eight win over Cincinnati went to overtime, and their 77-71 championship game victory over Michigan was famously in doubt until the final 11 seconds.\n\nWhile the 1993 UNC team actually had much less of an “NBA factor” (see below) than, say, Carolina’s absolutely star-studded title teams of 1982, 2005 or 2009, it somehow managed to send every single scholarship player into the professional basketball ranks.\n\nOnly two players from the 1993 team, center Eric Montross and forward George Lynch, became NBA draft picks and had significant careers at that level. (Both were first-round selections.) While their NBA stays were brief, backup centers Kevin Salvadori and Matt Wenstrom and starting point guard Derrick Phelps also spent some time in The League before playing more extensively in the minor leagues and/or internationally.\n\nForward Pat Sullivan, now UNC’s director of recruiting, spent 17 seasons in the NBA as an assistant coach before joining Hubert Davis’ staff in Chapel Hill last May.\n\nAmazingly, the other seven scholarship players ultimately joined the pro basketball ranks, too, playing in dozens of leagues scattered literally all over the world.\n\nGuard Donald Williams, the Most Outstanding Player of the 1993 NCAA Tournament, played professionally in Austria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, and the Philippines, in addition to stints with the Harlem Globetrotters, the International Basketball League and what is now called the NBA’s G League.\n\nGuard Henrik Rodl, who started 26 games in 1992-93 before yielding more minutes to Williams late in the season, became a superstar in his native Germany, winning seven German League championships and earning league MVP honors during an 11-year career with ALBA Berlin, which retired his number.\n\nStarting small forward Brian Reese played in England, Finland, France, Iceland and Taiwan. Guard Dante Calabria played in France, Greece, Italy and Spain. Guard Scott Cherry played one season in Cyprus. Guard Larry Davis, who finished his college career at South Carolina, played professionally in Belgium, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Israel, South Korea, Spain and Venezuela. Forward Ed Geth played in Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Sweden.\n\nThe 1993 Tar Heels also ultimately produced 11 basketball coaches. In addition to Sullivan, Calabria, Cherry, Davis, Geth, Lynch, Phelps, Reese, Rodl, Salvadori and Williams all became coaches (high school, college and/or pro) after their playing careers, and most remain in that profession today.\n\nMontross, of course, has been UNC basketball’s radio color commentator since 2005, when Mick Mixon left the Tar Heels to become the play-by-play voice of the NFL’s Carolina Panthers.\n\nTOP-30 NBA PICKS ON NCAA CHAMPIONS (1990-99)\n\n(For detailed information on the NCAA champions from 1980-89, please click here)\n\n(For detailed information on the NCAA champions from 1970-79, please click here)\n\n(For detailed information on the NCAA champions from 1955-69, please click here)\n\n1999 UConn\n\nHead Coach: Jim Calhoun\n\nStarters Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (1): junior G Richard Hamilton (#7)\n\nBackups Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (0): none\n\nNBA Players/Games (3/1,557): Hamilton (1,051), junior C Jake Voskuhl (456), sophomore PG Khalid El-Amin (50)\n\n1998 Kentucky\n\nHead Coach: Tubby Smith\n\nStarters Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (2): junior F Scott Padgett (#28), junior C Nazr Mohammed (#29)\n\nBackups Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (2): freshman C Michael Bradley (#17), sophomore C Jamaal Magloire (#19)\n\nNBA Players/Games (6/2,496): Mohammed (1,093), Magloire (726), Padgett (478), Bradley (174), senior G Jeff Sheppard (22), junior G Wayne Turner (3)\n\n1997 Arizona\n\nHead Coach: Lute Olson\n\nStarters Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (3): freshman PG Mike Bibby (#2), sophomore G Jason Terry (#10), junior F Michael Dickerson (#14)\n\nBackups Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (0): none\n\nNBA Players/Games (5/2,869): Terry (1,534), Bibby (1,106), Dickerson (216), sophomore C AJ Bramlett (8), junior G Miles Simon (5)\n\n1996 Kentucky\n\nHead Coach: Rick Pitino\n\nStarters Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (5): freshman F Ron Mercer (#6), sophomore F Antoine Walker (#6), junior F Derek Anderson (#13), senior G Tony Delk (#16), senior F Walter McCarty (#19)\n\nBackups Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (1): freshman C Nazr Mohammed (#29)\n\nNBA Players/Games (9/4,560): Mohammed (1,093), Walker (957), Anderson (639), McCarty (639), Delk (598), Mercer (443), senior C Mark Pope (166), junior G Jeff Sheppard (22), freshman PG Wayne Turner (3)\n\n1995 UCLA\n\nHead Coach: Jim Harrick\n\nStarters Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (2): senior F Ed O’Bannon (#9), senior C George Zidek (#22)\n\nBackups Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (0): none\n\nNBA Players/Games (6/655): senior PG Tyus Edney (232), Zidek (135), Ed O’Bannon (128), freshman F Toby Bailey (78), sophomore F Charles O’Bannon (52), freshman F JR Henderson (30)\n\n1994 Arkansas\n\nHead Coach: Nolan Richardson\n\nStarters Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (1): sophomore F Corliss Williamson (#13)\n\nBackups Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (0): none\n\nNBA Players/Games (3/994): Williamson (888), junior PG Corey Beck (94), junior G Clint McDaniel (12)\n\n1993 North Carolina\n\nHead Coach: Dean Smith\n\nStarters Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (2): junior C Eric Montross (#9), senior F George Lynch (#12)\n\nBackups Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (0): none\n\nNBA Players/Games (5/1,370): Lynch (836), Montross (481), junior C Kevin Salvadori (39), senior C Matt Wenstrom (11), junior PG Derrick Phelps (3)\n\n1992 Duke\n\nHead Coach: Mike Krzyzewski\n\nStarters Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (3): sophomore F Grant Hill (#3), senior C Christian Laettner (#3), junior PG Bobby Hurley (#7)\n\nBackups Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (2): freshman F Cherokee Parks (#12), sophomore F Antonio Lang* (#29)\n\nNBA Players/Games (6/2,939): Hill (1,065), Laettner (913), Parks (479), Hurley (270), Lang (144), senior F Brian Davis (68)\n\n1991 Duke\n\nHead Coach: Mike Krzyzewski\n\nStarters Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (3): freshman F Grant Hill (#3), junior C Christian Laettner (#3), sophomore PG Bobby Hurley (#7)\n\nBackups Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (1): freshman F Antonio Lang* (#29)\n\nNBA Players/Games (5/2,460): Hill (1,065), Laettner (913), Hurley (270), Lang (144), junior F Brian Davis (68)\n\n1990 UNLV\n\nHead Coach: Jerry Tarkanian\n\nStarters Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (3): junior F Larry Johnson (#1), junior F Stacey Augmon (#9), junior PG Greg Anthony (#12)\n\nBackups Who Became Top-30 NBA Picks (0): none\n\nNBA Players/Seasons (3/2,710): Augmon (1,078), Anthony (859), Johnson (773)\n\n*-not a “first-round” pick (NBA draft didn’t have 30 picks/round until 2004)\n\nNext Time: Much more on this NCAA champion/NBA draft connection.
