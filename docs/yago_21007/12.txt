Kevin & Perry Official is a truly unique act which has been inspired by the classic feature film ‘Kevin & Perry Go Large’. This act features professional entertainers Dean Taylor and Lea Jenkins who have been mimicking and cosplaying the iconic duo from the cult movie for over two decades. In the movie, Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke travel to Ibiza to become world-famous DJs. The soundtrack, humour and performances have since become iconic across generations. Having perfected their hilarious act down to the dancing, Ibiza atmosphere they create and their uncanny resemblance, Dean and Lea have fast become a popular double-act.

In 2021 the pair were videoed at the Hardwick Live festival and have since gone viral, with well over 11 million people watching their hilarious dancing. The video has been featured in the likes of The Independent, Mirror, Daily Star, NME, Mixmag, The Sun, DJMag and LADBible. Kathy Burke herself even commented on the video saying “If I wasn’t so much older and wider I'd swear this was me! Lovely stuff.”

Since their viral video, the duo has performed at sold out shows at Amnesia, Ibiza, alongside fellow DJs Judge Jules and Set Fontaine celebrating their 20th anniversary. At their events they get the party started by blasting out house, R&B, garage, tech house, filthy pop and acid house mashups to leave their audience questioning if they are in Ibiza.

Dean and Lea are not afraid to get stuck in – often joining the crowd for meet and greets, selfies and videos to create a night everyone will remember. If you are a fan of the nostalgic Kevin & Perry Go Large, looking for entertainers who perfectly capture the essence of the movie within their DJ sets and performances, look no further than Kevin and Perry Official to hire at your next corporate event, 90s or 00s themed weekend or party.
