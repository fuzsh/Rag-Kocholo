Midlands-based fans of Kevin & Perry Go Large have the chance to enjoy the movie ‘in concert’ this month.

Released in the year 2000 and starring Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke, the film is being screened in a big top tent, with the soundtrack provided live by the Silver Screen Symphony Orchestra.

Kevin & Perry impersonators will be in attendance at the show, there are free glow sticks with every ticket, and 1990s fancy dress is positively encouraged.
