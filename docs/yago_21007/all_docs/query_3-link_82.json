        "text": "The British comedy Kevin And Perry Go Large is back at the top of the UK chart after pinching the number one slot from last weekend's chart topper Scream 3. However, box office revenues across most of the country plummeted over the weekend (May 5-7) as the first of the UK's warm weather kept punters out of the cinema. The aggregate total for this weekend's top 15 films was $6.5m - half that of the previous weekend.\n\nThe worst effected of the new releases - which also suffered from scathing press reviews - were the three British films Janice Beard: 45wpm, House! and Circus. Man On The Moon starring Jim Carrey did a little better grossing $440,000 (£264,226) from 231 screens placing it at number 6 in the chart.\n\nPathe's bingo comedy House! starring Scottish actress Kelly MacDonald, took a disappointing $100,000 (£58,810) from 197 sites while Circus, starring fellow Scotsman John Hannah, also opening on 197 sites, scooped a three-day gross of $275,000 (£164,067) but still only registered a screen average of $1,380. Playing on a limited 24 screens, Janice Beard: 45wpm - from the lottery-funded franchise The Film Consortium - was the biggest loser, failing to reach $8,000 (£5,000)."
