        "text": "The 20th anniversary of Kevin & Perry Go Large will be celebrated with a huge knees-up in Ibiza this year.\n\nPlans for the celebrations were originally put on hold due to the pandemic, but now two special events have been confirmed to take place at Amnesia where the film was shot.\n\nThe iconic film starring comedians Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke sees two wannabe DJs travel to Ibiza with the aim to share their musical talents — but also lose their virginity.\n\nRead this next: Viral Kevin and Perry lookalikes praised by Kathy Burke\n\nThe parties will see the likes of DJ Seb Fontaine, who featured in the original movie, as well Judge Jules who curated the original soundtrack.\n\nSeb Fontaine said: “Every time I watch [the film] gives me goose-bumps. Working with them on the club scenes was fantastic and it was actually me DJing with Kevin and Perry on fake decks.\n\n“One of those nights you just never forget and I can’t wait for the 20th Anniversary celebrations back at Amnesia Ibiza this summer.”\n\nJudge Jules explained: “What’s astonished me about Kevin and Perry is that its appeal spans the generations. Each track from its soundtrack is familiar to everyone between the ages of 13 and 50.\n\nRead this next: Amnesia announces 2022 opening party\n\n“Having been involved in the movie’s soundtrack, and having been in Ibiza when it was filmed 20 years ago, I could never have imagined that K&P would have such enduring musical and cultural significance.\n\n“There have been a number of films covering Ibiza club culture, but none has come close to Kevin and Perry, in terms of its everlasting popularity. Going back to where it all started for the 20th Anniversary in Amnesia will be a special occasion indeed.”\n\nThe first event will be on June 6 with second release tickets available here and the party will also take place on September 27 with early bird tickets available here.\n\nFind out more about the event on their Facebook page."
