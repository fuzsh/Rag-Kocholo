        "text": "Get your bucket hats at the ready, because a massive Kevin and Perry party is taking place in Ibiza this summer.\n\nIt’s over 20 years since Kevin and Perry went on holiday to the sunkissed island set on losing their virginity and rampaging in all the best clubs, all while under the watchful eye of Kevin’s exasperated parents.\n\nThe iconic film, still a cult classic two decades later, is now set to be celebrated in the place where it all happened: the party town of Ibiza.\n\nA massive celebration will take place in revered club Amnesia – the set of the iconic final scene of the film.\n\nThe 20th anniversary party will feature the sights and sounds that made Kevin and Perry Go Large a favourite amongst clubbers.\n\nPerforming in the famous venue will be the DJ who played during the actual filming Seb Fontaine, the curator of the iconic soundtrack Judge Jules, and Follow Me track producer and DJ, Lange.\n\nThe party was first set to take place in 2020, marking 20 years since the film’s release, but was delayed for two summers thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic (So unfair!) – now it is confirmed to be back and bigger than ever.\n\nDance legend Jules, once voted the best DJ in the world, said: ‘What’s astonished me about Kevin and Perry is that its appeal spans the generations. Each track from its soundtrack is familiar to everyone between the ages of 13 and 50.\n\n‘Having been involved in the movie’s soundtrack, and having been in Ibiza when it was filmed 20 years ago, I could never have imagined that K&P would have such enduring musical and cultural significance.\n\n‘There have been a number of films covering Ibiza club culture, but none has come close to Kevin and Perry, in terms of its everlasting popularity. Going back to where it all started for the 20th Anniversary in Amnesia will be a special occasion indeed.’\n\nEchoing the sentiments was Seb, who said he still gets ‘goosebumps’ when he watches the film, and working with Kevin and Perry was ‘one of those nights you just never forget’.\n\n‘I can’t wait for the 20th Anniversary celebrations back at Amnesia Ibiza this summer.’\n\nAmnesia will host two separate events for the anniversary: Monday June 6 and Tuesday September 27, from 11pm to 6am, and is guaranteed to be a hit with clubbers and Kevin and Perry fans alike.\n\nTickets for the Kevin & Perry celebration start from €33 and are available from Ibiza Spotlight.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Harry Enfield, Tracy-Ann Oberman and Kara Tointon in photos from The Windsors West End play show it’s as subtle as never"
