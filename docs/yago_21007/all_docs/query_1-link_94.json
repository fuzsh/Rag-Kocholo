        "text": "There have been a tonne of movies out there that see British comedy television characters lift off to the big screen adventures. Ali G, The Inbetweeners, and Ms Brown’s Boys are all hilarious and successful on the small screen but have had a tepid responses on the big one. Perhaps the pressure to fill the cinemas creates and imbalance: the writers and performers feel they have to go a larger distance to appease cinema goers and their own fans. The result, with all these examples, is complete and utter trash with so much toilet humour that’ll make your body convulse in revolting manners.\n\nHarry Enfields’ classic and acclaimed character Kevin assaulted out eyeballs by conceiving this tragic onscreen debacle.\n\nKevin & Perry Go Large revolves around the titular characters – Kevin and his haphazard friend Perry (played by Kathy Burke) – and their misadventures through adolescence. In particular, losing their virginity. Now the laughing stock at school, Kevin and Perry decide to convince the former’s parents to go on holiday to Spain. The parents and the teens have two different ideas of what the holiday should be: Kevin and his dim-witted friends want to attend to coolest clubs and music scene whilst the parents want to do a traditional tourist holiday. And therefore, hijinks ensure.\n\nWhy is it Bad?\n\nWell, it’s just gross – in every form of the word. There’s shit, vomit, pubic hair, sex, and puss that populate the screen in such a putrid manner. The movie is unkind to your site and churns offensively in your stomach, whirring around as good taste and common sense slowly drain from your body. The film has moments of pure disgust including swallowing someone else’s poopadoop and a long sequence of spot popping (because ha-ha-ha teenagers have all body spots.) Your toes will curl, your blood will leave, and the soul of maturity will sickeningly quiver out of you, leaving you forever.\n\nWhy is it Good?\n\nWhen I was twelve, when this movie came out on home entertainment, I thought it was one of the most hilarious things I had ever witnessed and after talking about my idea to cover this, my friend and I couldn’t stop guffawing. The absurdity of the premise: two adults pretending to be moody teens and gallivanting over Ibiza trying to be superstar DJs is so over the top and ridiculous that you can’t help but love it a little. There are some great funny moments too include an unwarranted sex tape, two suitcases having sex, and Rhys Ifans drinking vodka through his eye. Yeah, they may not sound like comedy events of all time, but they’ll tickle you. There’s also the catchiest song of all time… All I Want To Do Is Do It. It’s so flippin catchy….\n\nOn top of that, there is an underdog element and a romantic element nestled in between the bosoms of the here that you can’t help but warm too, like warm vomit cascading down your face (oops, spoiler alert.) With an alarming 0% on Rotten Tomatoes and a complete disdain for toilet humour, I’m not completely sure as to why I am suggesting it to you. Perhaps to appease the 12 year old girl in me that tittered away at an eyeball floating in vodka or a shit floating in the sea… Nostalgia can do strange things."
