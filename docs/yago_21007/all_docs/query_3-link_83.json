        "text": "Comedy duo Kevin and Perry (played by Dean Taylor and Lea) will be DJing at Buzz Bingo in Morecambe, on Marine Road.\n\nThey will be playing Ibiza classics, and the host will be a comedian on number-calling duties.\n\nAlong with the Ibiza classics, DJ Jim Slipp will be playing hits from the 80s, 90s and today.\n\nTickets are currently on General Release, which is £11.25. The final Release will be £15.65.\n\nThe original Kevin and Perry Go Large starred Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke, with references to Ibiza's rave culture. It developed the character of Kevin, who originally starred as a truculent teenager in the TV show Harry Enfield and Chums.\n\nThe film has since received a cult following due to its soundtrack, which managed to appeal across the generations. The film featured music from artists such as Fatboy Slim, Underworld, Ayla, and Groove Armada."
