        "text": "My major project is based on the dangers of gambling addiction in online games, targeted at children. I intend to create a digital advertising campaign that evidences the dangers of predatory gambling mechanisms. I wish to focus on targeting parents, unaware of what the consequences of these gambling mechanisms could be.\n\nCurrent graphic based campaigns\n\nReflect Us – (Pentegram)\n\n”Branding for a nonpartisan coalition working to increase the number of women elected to public office in the U.S.”\n\nI like the duotone images used here and the way that the colours of the U.S flag have been used to brand the campaign. The bold imagery and fonts would be something that would work well within my campaign. I am trying to raise awareness as Paula Scher has done with her work here for Pentagram.\n\nThe fact that this campaign is about a problem and that it’s highlighting the lack of women in congress means it has to be clear and concise. I think the way Pentagram has chosen to boldly display this campaign stands out well and the branding runs through the whole project. I surmise that Pentagram have used gritty news style print images with duo tones because they go back to propaganda posters. This type of design therefore communicates its message by being branded like political campaigns previous and ones current.\n\nWhen the fun stops stop\n\nThis campaign is visually bold and bright and emphasises awareness with its black and yellow design. It is known that due to contrast, black and yellow’s ratio is high and so is white and black. This is something I haven taken note of and why I will more than likely use these colours to deliver an attentive message.\n\nI need to create a campaign that has a visual impact but a strong link to gambling in games. Shocking people with awareness and certain messages will work towards making them feel responsible for their children and as though they need to be the ones to control their gambling in games habit.\n\nSome people wouldn’t agree with this campaign nowadays! but it’s impact for me is bang on point with its message, images, colour and font.\n\nWho is my target audience?\n\nOne way of tackling this issue is to create a campaign that targets parents. I am targeting parents because they don’t want their children to become addicted to gambling in online games and they don’t want to rack up debts on their credit cards. I want the campaign to be graphically appealing to the public and have a clear message that makes them think ‘I didn’t know that’. The awareness needs to reach a captive audience and communicate effectively straight away. The campaign could show iconic characters in a situation where they have become gambling addicts. Today parents will easily recognise characters from the 90’s due to the demographic. A 40-50 year old will have been in their 20’s and 30’s in the 90’s so therefore they would be aware of certain icons in the gaming world. I could have a character who is looking to save children from games with gambling elements. The knowledge that children as young as 2 have in regards to using a device like a tablet, is actually quite scary if these gambling mechanisms are being targeted at children.\n\n”The Gambling Commission bans bookmakers and casinos from providing ‘facilities for gambling in such a way as to appeal particularly to children’: but this rule does not, for some reason, apply to online games.”\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-4961232/Gambling-firms-targeting-children-bad-drug-pushers.\n\nThere is actually a game that pokes fun at what is know as DLC, downloadable content called DLC Quest. The game makes people pay for pretty much everything, even saying hello to another character.\n\n”What happens when DLC practices go too far? An indie developer makes a game that mocks the industry and its foibles, that’s what! Defeat the bad guy, save the world and get the girl! But first you’ll need to find coins to buy DLC to enable animation, sound and even pausing. Thankfully this is just satire and all the DLC is purchased with in-game coins. But consider it a cautionary tale for the future”…\n\nhttp://goingloudstudios.com/games/dlc-quest/\n\nMaking people pay for everything in a game is just ridiculous and this satire based game is no different. It is a great example of how to poke fun at games that overstep the boundaries when it comes to in game purchases.\n\nDevelopment of brand style ideas\n\nAs I developed this campaign I started to look at the style of games and how I could use characters to spread awareness in relation to gambling in online games. I thought that to target parents I would have make a graphically visual campaign possibly featuring characters from the 80’s and 90’s as they would be recognisable to their era as well as being relatable to young people. As the campaign is to highlight gambling in games I think that the fonts and colours I use all need to coincide with a style that relates to the gaming industry, as well as various other awareness campaigns.\n\nFrom attending a lecture from Ian Anderson, the graphic designer who started the agency ‘The Designers Republic’, I drew inspiration from his artwork and design style, pieces such as the graphics for ‘Wipeout’ and the digital looking fonts and graphical art characters.\n\nI learnt that the font above is called ‘Decima Mono Pro’. I intend to use this across my campaign with a bold logo to relate to gaming.\n\nDecima Mono Pro font – Aphex Twin tour dates (The Designers Republic)\n\nDecima Mono Pro font – A bunch of fives zine (The Designers Republic)\n\nDecima Mono pro font – event flyer – (The Designers Republic)\n\nFrom looking into the designers republic, I noticed that their style uses a lot of asian fonts, mainly Japanese due to the various clients they have worked for and Japanese restaurants like NY Sushi.\n\nFrom taking an interest in the designers republic style, I went into looking at Japanese gaming posters and typographic design.\n\nI want to emulate styles of Japanese typography found in games design and urban areas. I believe they would work well combined with English worded fonts to create a campaign that is visually appealing across East and West. The gaming industry after all has many players worldwide and Japan is an innovator in the industry with companies such as Nintendo and Sony.\n\nCampaign Design Development\n\nI’ve decided to go with the name ‘Gambling in Games Awareness’ and believe it is the simplest way to say what the campaign is all about. ‘GIGA’ would work well as a solid logo and I want it to be bold and resemble something like ‘SEGA’, using fonts which are relatable to the gaming industry.\n\nLogo\n\nAs this is an awareness campaign about gambling in games I had an idea of using eyes to watch over people and protect them from the predatory gambling mechanisms in online games.\n\nI developed ‘GIGA’ from a bold font called ‘Segoe Black Italic’. I started to develop a 3D logo to give it impact.\n\nI came up with an idea to use some kind of hero character to be a mascot/spokesperson for the campaign. As you can see the eyes are G’s to stand for gambling in games with the incorporation of his nose.\n\nThis character is someone who is there to protect children, I thought that turning him into some sort of martial arts expert would work well to resemble some kind of hero character.\n\nFor me there is no better martial arts expert than Bruce Lee. I have chosen to parody his style as he was in the 1979 film ‘Game of Death’ with his iconic black and yellow suit. As I have mentioned in my blog, certain awareness campaigns use black and yellow to create visual impact just like ‘when the fun stops stop’. I think this would work well throughout the brands identity. To differentiate the character, I gave him a red bandanna to suit the nature of the character and give him that ‘Karate Kid’ style parody.\n\nAfter some thinking I decided that the character would be called ‘Dan’, this derived from the martial arts ranking system;\n\nThe dan (段) ranking system is used by many Japanese organizations and Korean martial arts to indicate the level of one’s ability within a certain subject matter. As a ranking system, it was originally used at a go school during the Edo period.[1] It is now also used in modern fine arts and martial arts.\n\nThe system was applied to martial arts in Japan by Kanō Jigorō (1860–1938),[2] the founder of judo, in 1883, and later introduced to other East Asian countries.[3] In the modern Japanese martial arts, holders of dan ranks often wear a black belt; those of higher rank may also wear red-and-white and red belts. Dan ranks are also given for strategic board games such as go, Japanese chess (shōgi), and renju, as well as for cultural arts such as flower arrangement (ikebana), Japanese calligraphy (shodō) and tea ceremony (sadō). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_(rank)\n\nAs the system shows the 1st Dan’s colour theory is black and yellow. Without realising this and just looking towards Bruce Lee’s yellow suit, this ties in being the top of the tree when it comes to his martial arts ability. I imagine this is why the design of Bruce Lee’s suit was black and yellow as he was the best at what he did.\n\nAfter working on the Dan character I wasn’t too fussed on having the ‘GIG’ as his eyes. I thought he would work better with some cartoon based eyes that would give him more visual appeal as a character. Alongside a prominent logo I feel it will still have an impact as a brand identity.\n\nI used the pen tool in adobe illustrator to re – design the eyes and create a fully vectored mascot. I drew the eyes by creating black and white shapes and layering them, tracing over a pack of cartoon eyes found on google.\n\nI redesigned them to be symmetrical and slightly different in order to avoid any sort of copy right, if it got that far!\n\nI chose to leave the logo as a flat design as I planned on working on Japanese typography to represent the ‘GIGA’ logo, with a kanji based font. Google provides a translator which presents the symbolic representation of letters and can be copied into illustrator to edit.\n\nI decided to stick with the yellow colour developed from sampling an image of Bruce Lee’s yellow suit and used for ‘Dan’. I think as a brand, using these two colours with have visual impact along with possibly white in the body copy for the campaigns awareness messages.\n\nAfter designing some more traditional based vectors, I wanted to emulate the style mentioned in my development, modern based ‘sans serif’Japanese fonts that are used in games.\n\nI found a site ;https://www.branah.com/japanese\n\nThis translates letters into Japanese Kana. From here I copied straight into illustrator in order to edit.\n\nI wanted to create shadow as well to make the letters pop and resemble Japanese game cover art.\n\nI settled on a black shadow with a white foreground and to make the text look hand drawn and stand out on branding elements, I used a black stroke.\n\nFrom earlier in the blog I mentioned the influence of the Ian Anderson talk I went to and the use of a font named ‘Decima Mono Pro’. I decided to combine this with the two logos to state the full name of the campaign ‘gambling in games awareness’. I used lower case and tightened up the letters with kerning.\n\nFinal Logo\n\nFrom creating the campaigns mascot ‘Dan’ I started to think of ways to extend the brands reach. Below are notes I made which is the make up of an initial brief. I put in there about creating parody games characters who have fallen into a downward spiral of addiction. These characters need to be targeted at parents, so I decided to use popular games characters of the 80’s and 90’s to appeal to my target audience. These characters are furthermore iconic, so they are known across all generations with the products they have produced and still do today. The characters are parody versions and in no way have been created to to discourage their reputation. What the campaign could be saying is, they come from a time where gambling in games didn’t exist, but in the modern day this is what they have to deal with if they have gambling in their gaming world. This part of the campaign is to represent what comes from a gambling addiction. It is to show the consequences of gambling through relevant sources. The link is to show what happens if you have gambling in games and how the spread of addiction could be something that affects children over a period of time.\n\nAs the above note shows, I decided to parody 4 characters, Mario, Pikachu, Donkey Kong and Sonic. They each have an effect of gambling addiction and have been hand drawn with the help of my brother Jamie. We worked together on the pencil sketches and I put to him the idea for each characters situation. From this I scanned the items in and created each character for the campaign through the use on pen tooled shapes, in adobe illustrator.\n\nI used various research sites to communicate the consequences of compulsive addiction and what can arise from gambling. One statement from; https://www.problemgambling.ca/ was the basis for some of the posters outcomes.\n\n”Problem Gambling can have a serious impact on the physical, emotional, and financial health of individuals who gamble, as well as their families.”\n\nMario (finance troubles, loss of home etc)\n\nYoshi (his pet on the street while homeless!)\n\nDonkey Kong (Isolation and loss of social circles)\n\nPikachu (suffering from alcoholism)\n\nI found a statement that I will go on to use;\n\n”Alcohol Concern Cymru and the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) in Wales claim alcohol and gambling issues can be dealt with side-by-side.\n\nThe report says one in six respondents to a survey who sought help for alcohol misuse admitted they had also experienced problems with gambling.”\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-21529290\n\nSonic (resorting to stealing through addiction, feeding the habit)\n\nVector Outcomes\n\nAll the characters took some long hard patience, each one was drawn over the top of the scanned image with the pen tool. I sampled colours of each character by finding images and working out combinations for shading purposes.\n\nI started to think about placing the characters into real life photos but chose not to in the end. With the right photos, this idea could work as an extension to the campaign.\n\nFrom this point I decided that the campaign could have the potential to turn the mascot ‘Dan’ into an actual game whereby he takes down the elements of gambling in his gaming world. I came up with a few characters which represented elements of gambling such as a roulette table, playing card, dice and a bandit machine. The boss would be at the end of the game and his name is ‘Lootros’ as he is a loot box, one of the more formidable elements of gambling in current online games. He therefore has these gambling henchmen who you have to battle through stages to get to a final level to take out ‘Lootros’ and remove gambling in Dan’s gaming world for good.\n\n(I developed the Loot Box boss without any initial pencil drawing.)\n\nThe last thing before creating the posters was to create a mark for people to follow through to the campaigns website; http://www.giga.com\n\nAt this point I came up with an initial brief for the project;\n\nGambling in Games Awareness\n\nProject Outcomes\n\nCaptive Adverts\n\nPosters\n\nLarge billboard adverts\n\nBus advert mock ups.\n\nWebsite\n\nSocial media posts\n\nExhibition stands (to feature at events and in public places, with representatives from the campaign giving out information on (G.I.G.A)\n\nMagazine spreads\n\nBrand extension – Game\n\nEvaluation\n\nThis campaign was designed to highlight the problem of gambling mechanisms being targeted at children in online games. Although there is no legal definition that puts things like ‘loot boxes’ into a gambling category, the campaign provides facts and information from academics and people in the gaming industry, who have spoken out on the dangers. I spent a long time going through case studies from the UK gambling commission, health experts, U.S State representatives and scientific research on the release of dopamine based on anticipation. All this information presented me with a clearly defined problem, where the industry has learnt just how much money they can make out of online transactions, targeting vulnerable people and children. It seems to be that these companies now only have an interest in money, not creating experiences for people to enjoy. If children are now gambling in online games, where could this addictive lifestyle lead them? That is what this campaign is targeting parents for, it is saying to them ‘look what could happen’ if an addiction to gambling in games, spirals out of control.\n\nIn my development blog, regarding target audience I said;\n\n‘‘I want the campaign to be graphically appealing to the public and have a clear message that makes them think ‘I didn’t know that’. The awareness needs to reach a captive audience and communicate effectively straight away.’’\n\nI consider this part, the most important feature when creating an awareness campaign. The first focal point of ‘gambling in games awareness’ is that it has to effectively communicate a message about children gambling in games. I investigated visual acuity and found that yellow and black combinations work best in delivering the right contrast;\n\n‘’Yellow background works best in visual crowded environments, for architectural and psychological factors yellow is often used. Yellow with black lettering sends out a clear information message.’’\n\nhttp://designworkplan.com/design/signage-and-color-contrast.htm\n\nAfter some reflection during the end of the project, I discussed with my tutor the projects all round message and whether that had been clearly defined. I mention this now, as the first point of capturing the audience’s attention is what was missing from the campaign. I created some slogans that would be used to clearly define that this campaign was targeting parents and the public, on the realisation of children gambling in online games. I created; ‘attention! – do you know that children are gambling in online games’ and ‘what could result from children developing a gambling addiction in online games’. Both these designs emphasise the relation of children and gambling by making those parts big and various contrasts of black and white, set on a yellow background.\n\nThe yellow colour was developed to have maximum impact across the campaigns whole identity. From this I created a mascot type character named ‘Dan’ who carries the campaigns yellow colour across his outfit. Dan is used as a spokesperson and informant to parents, but also as a hero character to children. The yellow came from the suit worn by Bruce Lee in a martial arts film, combined with black it was perfect for the connection to colour theory in relation to contrast. I also found out that the martial arts scale of ‘The Dan’ uses a combination of yellow and back for its top rank. All this links together to give the campaign a strong identity through it’s visual appeal and meaning. It is also the reason why Dan’s statement is; ‘Dan is at the top of his game when it comes to protecting children from gambling mechanisms, used in online games.’\n\nAfter creating Dan, I thought about the concept of using parody characters such as ‘Mario’ to deliver further messages about where a gambling addiction could lead. I used a selection of academic responses that related the images to the potential outcomes of a gambling addict. To deliver a successful creative outcome, I collaborated with my brother to pencil draw these characters in scenes which envisage what could arise from a gambling addiction. Once the drawings were complete, they were scanned into adobe Illustrator. From there I used the pen tool to make the characters visually effective and vector shapes, so they could be used across a wide range of media platforms and billboard advertisements.\n\nEach character used dates to the 80’s or 90’s. The relevance being that parents would recognise them from their youth and the fact they are iconic and still are very much part of the gaming world, so would children and the public. In no way have I designed these characters to reflect any problems in the games which they come from. If anything, they are from a time where gambling in games didn’t exist, so creating them like this in the modern day reflects the current state of the online gaming industry. Overall, they are there due to their iconic status and to be visually effective across all demographics.\n\nI wanted the campaign to reflect the gaming industry in all its design styles, so I chose a certain font that has a digital look, ‘Decima Mono Pro’. This was used to state ‘gambling in games awareness’ in the logo. The logo mark ‘GIGA’ was created from ‘Segoe Black Italic’ to have a bold, strong presence and stand out across all media platforms. So that all body copy in the campaign stood out clearly, everything regarding a message was created with ‘Segoe Bold’ or ‘Black Italic’ and inserted as white text in a black box or vice versa.\n\nFrom my blog you can see that I was influenced by Japanese design in the gaming industry. I designed ‘GIGA’ using Japanese Kana symbols, giving them a 3D look to make them pronounced and relatable to Japanese gaming art. For the game I made the Kana symbol for ‘Dan’ to coincide with the design for ‘GIGA’.\n\nMy intention for this campaign is that it delivers to a captive audience. I want the artefacts to feature across all advertising platforms and it is the reason I have created an extensive campaign. I think the message has been clearly defined, regarding the dangers to children from gambling in online games and the artefact demonstrates the cultural relationship between the gaming industry and the target audience. I have made mock designs of posters, billboards, an exhibition stand, website, magazine spreads and social media posts, all to show how the campaign could be effective in delivering its message.\n\nFurthermore, the campaign has potential to take certain characteristics to be developed into a game to teach children about the dangers of gambling in games. Dan will go through stages of the game, removing characters that are designed to look like certain elements associated with gambling i.e. a playing card fruit machine, dice and a poker chip. These characters come from a boss who is designed to look like a ‘loot box’, the most formidable element of gambling in current online games. As Dan battles the boss’s henchmen, he will get to a final level to take on ‘Lootros’ (the boss) and remove gambling in online games for good.\n\nIn conclusion I believe the campaign would be effective in delivering a clear message about the dangers of gambling in games to parents and the public. I would say that if I had developed my idea a little sooner, I would have liked to give the campaign some form of digital animation. I think Dan would work well if he was developed into a fully animated character and this would also be effective in capturing my audience further. If the option was there for investment, the potential for ‘gambling in games awareness’ could cover aspects of animation and look towards the creation of a game. This will educate people and make the gaming industry take note and hopefully reconsider certain developer’s stances, on targeting elements of gambling at children.\n\nEventually I want my career trajectory to be that I become a freelance designer. Being my own boss and in control of the clients and the work I produce, would be the ideal scenario for me and what I want to achieve as a designer. Right now an agency will provide me with the right credentials to further my career, working among a group of experienced designers, preparing me with the knowledge to enable me to make it as a freelancer. I intend to work in an agency for a couple of years before I think about the next step to freelance. This doesn’t mean that I won’t take on any freelance opportunities that come my way, as a strong portfolio will be beneficial regarding a job or placement. Development of my website and creating social networking will further enable me to be more visually appealing for employment.\n\nLIST\n\nBroaden my skills by taking on placements to get a broad range of Sheffield’s design agencies.\n\nApply for jobs in Sheffield.\n\nRearrange my personal website joesleney.com to be current on whats trending. Would be great to have freelance work available on there and evidence of external work away from University.\n\nNetwork more with LinkedIn to develop relationships with industry professionals.\n\nLook to understand Sheffield’s design hub and to keep up with current trends and economic growth affecting the design industry in Sheffield and elsewhere.\n\nSend examples of my work to companies in regards to feedback but with the intention of a placement or more.\n\nTake on freelance design work to strengthen portfolio.\n\nDevelop digital skills such as adobe software, HTML emails, animation, website design and coding\n\nIn becoming a professional designer we all need to create contacts with industries and get our name out there. We make ourselves business cards to firstly enable someone to contact you, you then have a website they can view your work on. If the idea is to become a freelance designer, you have to create a social network for your work especially. Your website needs to be up and running, with constant content filtering through the site so that it keeps your online presence fresh. Networking is also crucial in order to build up a portfolio of clients. From watching a friend of mine, I have seen what it takes to be a freelance designer. Only so much of it depends on your creative flair and skill. Being able to communicate broadly among clients with integrity and professionalism is the backbone. Building relationships, but also maintaining them is key for a good reputation. All of the above applies in exactly the same way to getting a job within an agency. If you are a good designer with a creative online presence and your a good communicator, then you are more likely to obtain a design role. A way into getting freelance work can be as simple as creating a website and Facebook page. My friend found his first work through a Facebook friend, tagging him in a post looking for a graphic designer. From then on, he has maintained constant work with a client who has been able to open up a network of jobs due to his creative marketing skills, via the people he knows. It is a lot of who you know in freelance design and who can provide you with that next job, but also your own drive and intuition.\n\nBeing freelance you have to be a ‘yes man’ in regard to work opportunities. Sometimes a client may be looking for a logo and the next minute they want a website. Having more creative qualities such as web design may be quite a learning curve for some, but it is a necessity in today’s industry for businesses to have an online presence. I believe you have to keep pushing your learning always in design, as there will always be something you don’t know already. Throughout my degree I have tried to apply up to date styles and techniques to all of my work and learn new things through tutorials. Keeping myself refreshed with the current design trends and taking the advice of my tutors, has enabled me to have a greater understand of what design can be and what it should look like to suit it’s context.\n\nRight now I feel that an agency would be the best place for me to build my skills and learn how a company puts projects together. What I am yet to do is go on any work experience, but I intend to do this as the year progresses and get my foot in the door. I think that if I can hone my design skills further and learn new things at an agency, then over the next couple of years I feel I may be ready to go freelance. That’s not to say that if I get any offers for freelance work through a Facebook page or friends, that I won’t take it. Saying yes may lead to the next opportunity and will only further contribute to developing as a graphic designer.\n\nIn Sheffield there are a number of agencies who are highly acclaimed. A few of them are;\n\nSide by Side\n\nPeter and Paul\n\n93 Feet\n\nEat Sleep Think\n\nVIVID\n\nI intend to contact certain agencies and inform them of my intention to gain experience at an agency in Sheffield. There is a wide variety to choose from and apply to in Sheffield and it shows this city is becoming one of the UK’s biggest design hubs.\n\nWork Experience\n\nJust before the third year started I worked at an agency ‘Objective Creative’ for a couple of days, to see how they put together jobs. It was a good insight into how a busy agency has to deal with such a fast paced environment, working to tight deadlines. I’ll be doing some more placement there as the year goes by, hopefully to develop my skills alongside some other placements. I believe it is important to link with a number of agencies if possible, but finding a start anywhere over the next few months is the goal. This is so I can continually develop as a designer, building relationships and developing as a professional.\n\nLecture from Sacha Ferrier\n\nI found his lecture full of great tips on how to really stamp your foot in the door if you want to make it in the creative industry. Straight away talking about branding yourself and how to network relationships online and in person.\n\n”Every good creative will need a business card and an identity that reflects not just the business but your personality and creative style.” Sacha told of how he had been through about 5 different cards over the last 4 or 5 years, trying to find his identity and what he is all about.\n\nHe spoke of how it is important to create a professional profile in all that you do, from interacting with clients to how you should look smart to give a good impression. All simple things but ways to advertise yourself in a positive manner.\n\n‘Tips on self promotion’\n\n”Interact with online forums, Ask questions, get open ended discussions going and comment on posts, share articles, present a clear understanding of what you do, be friendly, self promote, separate your personal online social connections with your professional ones.”\n\nCurrent design trends\n\nlouder and brighter colours\n\nduotones\n\nbold typography\n\nGoogle fonts has now become one of the best places for a versatile range of serif and sans serif fonts and its all free.\n\nOpen Sans\n\nI applied for a position at Brand New Idea for some agency experience, hopefully to get a bit more knowledge of the industry and to reference to future employers. The email basically just says how i had heard about the position through my tutor and my interest in the role and what it would involve. He replied about having a chat but I haven’t heard back about doing some work placement just yet.\n\nAs of 18th November I have applied for a position working at learn direct in their apprenticeship department making graphic contributions to marketing and advertising packages.\n\nI had just before created a LinkdIn profile in order to expand my reach and also to utilise the jobs section on there. The position for Learn Direct was applied through LinkdIn so having a reply back has been beneficial to my development.\n\nThe site enables you to put up qualifications and your CV in order to show your recognised achievements and to make it easy to be able to interact with job opportunities and generally people and design.\n\nThe brief to the job opportunity at Learn Direct is below. It requires a graphical assessment task to show the benefits of using the internet to enable level 2 apprentices to learn from the information.\n\njunior-graphic-designer-task-01\n\nLearn Direct\n\nI applied for a job at Learn Direct which also challenged your design skills as they set a brief to interpret some content on the worldwide web. I looked into the type of graphics that Learn Direct usually produce. I wanted to create some infographics that were clear enough to be applied to an online LMS system.\n\nLearn Direct Brief\n\nPersonal Website\n\nI have currently been changing the layout of my website to make it look more visually appealing for potential employers to see. I have taken the portfolio and changed the imagery from set to the right, to centered with the brief description above. This allows the images to be larger and on a scroll, so it is easily viewed. The reason for doing this is that it fits in better with current design based websites and looks more professional to suit the graphic design industry.\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nThese changes have been applied to all projects.\n\nAnimated graphics\n\nAnimation is becoming more integrated with graphic design every week. We are all influenced by moving image, it grabs our eye and takes us back to the cartoons we loved as children. Even a bit of moving typography can put that slight spin on a word that makes it stand out. That as well as flat logo vector design works really well together in delivering information to us in a more quirky way. When you watch adverts on television you can really tell which companies have invested in their design style, by how their message is interpreted and presented though animation and effects. The convergent elements of design are something that every designer needs to take note of. I will continue to develop digital skills to appeal to Sheffield’s agencies.\n\nAnimation really helps to deliver a message that is entertaining and makes you want to watch how it flows.\n\nOne stand out project was that of the Winter Olympics in Pyeonchang. I think the combination of animation and brand style captures current trends and emphasises the best elements of convergent design. For my benefit as a professional, the more digital elements I can educate myself with the more opportunities I will have in the design industry.\n\n(created by Interbrand)\n\nDixon Baxi also created a digital campaign for eurosport that has so many different elements such as interactive elements, animation and a bold style that is straight out of 2018, current and attractive. This is a one of the nicest projects I’ve seen and has many different elements that gives the brand a distinctive style.\n\nhttp://dixonbaxi.com/work/eurosport-pyeongchang-2018/\n\nWhats going on in Sheffield\n\n”A new digital report, commissioned by The University of Sheffield and Creative Sheffield, has revealed that there are currently 21,000 people employed in creative and digital jobs in the city.”\n\nSheffield’s creative and digital industries “underestimated”, report reveals\n\nIn Sheffield we are now becoming quite the beacon for design which is good as I’m not too keen on moving away from this place, just yet!\n\n”Digital companies in Sheffield are experiencing fast growth, with turnover increasing by 38% annually. The top 25 technology companies in the city and surrounding region also bring in £2bn a year.”\n\n”There is high employability in the sector, with the majority of companies surveyed expecting to recruit new workers in the next year.”\n\n”Of all the services and skills offered by those surveyed, digital design and development was the most common, followed by marketing, branding and content, video and moving image, and graphics and animation.”\n\nIt looks to be good news for getting a job, as we are now in early 2018 so according to those figures this might be the perfect time to get applying and put myself out there.\n\nDigital Experience\n\nA quick one about getting a job in the design industry. When applying for jobs there is a lot of focus on digital experience, maybe not as a specific requirement all the time but as advantageous. One particular extra string to the bow could be learning how to develop websites and learn coding, but also to learn how to produce HTML emails. Websites such as ‘Mail Chimp’ give you an almost ‘WordPress’ based functionality in giving you all the tools and resources to make HTML emails easy. Even having a basic understanding of this type of work is only beneficial in adding to my graphics portfolio. It is something that all businesses are going to use when marketing to their clients, providing interactive elements, images and links.\n\nFrom this I decided to sign up for ‘Mail Chimp’ as I think it could be firstly advantageous to learn the software and secondly I could use that skill to then target potential followers, such as through a Freelance Facebook page.\n\nI went ahead and created a test email with a few random pictures of a chicken and the ‘Peter and Paul’ design agency! Very random but a very easy system to create a fully functional interactive email.\n\nThe Strines Inn\n\nI currently work part time in a country pub in Sheffield. We have some fairly dated menu’s there so I recommended bringing them up to date and removing such fonts as comic sans from their childrens menu. I used a combination of fonts, ‘Baskerville’ in creating the logo and titles and various forms of Aileron for the descriptions.\n\nBefore\n\nThe logo has been replaced with a more distinctive mark using ‘Baskerville Semi Bold’ and I have removed all the blue writing from the menus as well. The menu items are now laid out with a Sans Serif font using Aileron, to bring it more up to date than just using traditional Serif fonts throughout.\n\nComic Sans! not good at all! with two types of blue used in the descriptions.\n\nFirst Draft.\n\nmenu (clean)\n\nOn the second draft I added a note about how chips are available when it’s quiet. They are popular chips but we can’t always provide them to customers when we are really busy. This is down to not having space in the fryers and the fact that main meals come first as they make us more money. When were quiet though, not a problem, order as many chips as you want! Sounds very petty but you have to work there to understand the demand for our chips especially in the Summer!\n\nmenu (clean) 2\n\nPlacement opportunity – ‘Eat Sleep Think’\n\nemail;\n\nHi Ben, my names Joe Sleney and I’m currently completing my third year, graphics top up degree at Hillsborough College. Paul Clarkson has mentioned this today as I didn’t make it in last week due to the weather. I was wondering if there might be an opportunity to come down and show you some examples of my work and to hopefully have a crack at some placement with potential for something further. Paul mentioned that you are planning on taking people on for a placement, then you will come see our show and possibly take on somebody for employment. I’m available at any time, I do a bit of bar work on a Tuesday which can be rescheduled for completing some placement, but that is no problem at all. Attached I’ve added a link to my website which has all the projects from from first two years as well as a project called ‘What’s Radical’, which is the first project from this degree year which I achieved a first for.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, thanks\n\nJoe\n\nwww.joesleney.com\n\nI forgot to put a bit about my skills in so I sent a follow up email;\n\nHi I just wanted to follow up with the application regarding a work opportunity. I just wanted to add that I have now become proficient across Indesign, Illustrator and Photoshop. In the second year I also completed a WordPress site, which I have sent you. I would say that HTML and coding is generally something I would like to improve on, but I’m a quick learner and I do work competently on my own regarding design software and the WordPress format of building a site. I would say that my skills lie heavily with branding and I believe that the high marks I’ve had across these last 3 years has been down to the depth and clarity in each of my projects. I’m a great communicator and confident individual but I know where to take criticism and where to collaborate and change ideas, which has worked well for me over my time as a Graphics student, thanks again and I apologise that this wasn’t all attached as one.\n\nJoe Sleney\n\nIn regard to the above it is a bit of a shame that I sent this email without adding the content that I left out. However I apologised in the second email and will hopefully still be considered for the role.\n\nSpear recruitment application\n\nAchieving a role in the design industry\n\nThroughout our foundation degree and the top up year I’ve been fortunate to have been presented with different intern opportunities and advice on how to get some experience. The good thing about being on this course is that our tutors have great links with the graphics industry, so they are able to present us with various opportunities via the contacts they have. I feel that throughout the year I have made the effort to try and achieve internships especially. We are very fortunate that Sheffield’s design industry is currently booming and there seem to be a fair amount of jobs available. What I can do is keep at it, keep developing my graphics skills and applying with the work booklets I created last year, along with my business cards and the ROOM brochure created for a contemporary furniture project. What I will do is put together a piece of work to signify some of the more stand out projects I have done, including my final degree year work.\n\nI sent out these to a couple of agencies in Sheffield. One great learning curve was that you should always make sure you pay the right postage for a parcel! and don’t send a hand written note to acclaimed agencies when your a graphics student! I basically sent out the package below with a business card to Jaywing and Peter and Paul, I got a response from Jaywing. I were a bit gutted that they said I’ve got some nice work as well, that little bit more attention to detail and professionalism could have potentially got me an interview with one of Sheffield’s best companies. In future I would design a cover letter to send with my work and then personally sign it, instead of using a bit of scrap paper. I believed that was just to say what I were sending, but when your a designer, the more creative flair you have the more it shows to professionals. ‘Key tip’- don’t be slack!\n\nHi Joe,\n\nThanks for your package. Here’s some helpful tips…\n\n• Put some effort into your notes/letters. A scrap of paper won’t and didn’t win any favours, you’ve clearly spent a bit of time and effort putting your little folio book, business card, website and mock-up together, the little scribble on the scrap of paper lets it down. You’ve got in touch looking for a design role, you’ve some nice work too. Prove you are a good designer in everything you do, don’t cut corners, design a letter, sign it for a personal touch, or at the very least, write a nice note on a nice piece of paper with your branding on.\n\n• Pay the full amount for postage, it’s cost us money to have your package delivered, not cool. Invest in some large letter stamps.\n\n• Who have you emailed the CV to? A little look on LinkedIn and you could have found a name to address the whole package to, CV included.\n\nIt’s a harsh world, being blunt, first impressions matter and help get a foot in the door.\n\nHope this is helpful, good luck.\n\nRegards,\n\nTOM SMITH\n\nHead of Design | JAYWING\n\nNew Website build\n\nI chose to rework my website with a new WordPress theme. I had come to realise that within the Kalium theme I were using last, there were many different interactive elements that were holding me back. The functionality of the site wasn’t right and certain buttons didn’t direct you to the right area. I decided that building a new site in Enfold was easier than the fixes it needed. All these changes were done in order to give my site a more professional look to draw in potential employers. I also took out certain projects that need a re – work such as the Desperado’s brief, same again to present work which I feel is up to scratch.\n\nSite development\n\nEvaluation\n\nOver the course of the last three years, it has been a fast introduction to design, which has educated me on how to conduct myself as a professional. I have tried to immerse myself in graphic design culture and develop my skills graphically through creative software, but also conceptually. A project needs to have meaning and depth, relative to a target audience, but most of all be visually appealing. For me personally, educating myself on how to brand a project and get a message across has been the biggest learning curve over the course.\n\nI stated that I wanted to broaden my skills by taking on some potential placement opportunities. I didn’t manage to do this but what I did was apply for various roles as its an important part of getting my foot in the door. Any kind of experience through placement is good for my CV and I will continue to do this as well as applying directly for jobs. Throughout the blog there is evidence of how I have tried to obtain placement as well as applying for full time design roles. A good positive to take was the ‘Learn Direct’ job I applied for. They set a brief which the interviewers said I hit and created a project visually appealing for it’s audience. Although I didn’t get the job, the positive note is that I got an interview due to my creative skills and what I produced.\n\nIn the second year I created a personal portfolio website to set me up for the creative industry and to showcase my work. I wanted to develop my digital skills across various fields, one being web design. The previous sites functionality was an issue and visually it’s layout was outdated. I created a new site using the Enfold WordPress theme, teaching myself further skills that will contribute to my professional development. The site now has a cleaner design more suited to the industry. It is therefore better presented to agencies at interview, but as it’s a freelance site I can also gain work in that regard.\n\nIn becoming a professional designer, I have stated in this blog how important it is to constantly keep refreshing yourself with the convergent and trending elements of design. Interactive styles such as animation and web-based graphics are new and current, also they’re a big advantage when applying for a job. The more skills I have will enable me to justify why I can be an asset to an agencies team. I will continue to work on my social networking to bring in freelance opportunities, as in the meantime it will be good for my portfolio and to present at interviews.\n\nI created a LinkedIn site which is a great tool to get my work out into the public and create new relationships in the industry. What I need to do is start networking while I am seeking employment, putting out posts of my degree work and the freelance work I’ve done. Along with my website and a broad range of work, the better chance I will have at creating new opportunities.\n\nIt has been a big advantage having tutors with connections as they have been able to point potential placement and opportunities our way. Once I have left University that is all up to me, it becomes my responsibility to network among design agencies, or to create a freelance client portfolio.\n\nIt takes a lot of elements to make it as a designer and the education behind my development will be a working progress. I have chosen to go down the route of working in an agency before I fully focus on freelance. The two can work together though, as any side work will contribute to my portfolio and to employers considering me for work.\n\nThe design industry in Sheffield is currently booming and from evidence stated by ‘design week’ digital companies in Sheffield are experiencing fast growth, with turnover increasing by 38% annually.\n\n”There is high employability in the sector, with the majority of companies surveyed expecting to recruit new workers in the next year.”\n\n”Of all the services and skills offered by those surveyed, digital design and development was the most common, followed by marketing, branding and content, video and moving image, and graphics and animation.”\n\nSheffield’s creative and digital industries “underestimated”, report reveals\n\nIt is now a good time to be involved in the creative industry in Sheffield and from the above there are many different skills that agencies are looking for. The convergent elements of design show in this report and that is important for my own progression. I need to keep developing my digital skills and as the article states, animation and moving image are trending attributes that entice employers. I have begun to experiment with moving image/typography this year and that is displayed on my websites homepage, so whoever opens the page will see an animated effect.\n\nI have also started to pick up freelance work through the pub I currently work in. I created some new menu’s which is shown on the blog and from that I have been given the opportunity to develop a new website. From this I want to build on freelance opportunities and promote to other pubs and businesses regarding rebranding and web design. Any opportunity is a good one and as I look to get agency experience, picking up extra work will help to build a good reputation and bring in some extra money.\n\nOverall this course has helped me to progress as a designer and has given me a broad set of skills to be successful. As I mentioned at the start, the best thing about this course is that it has educated me not only on design skills, but on the whole elements of being a professional. Going forward I will continue to broaden my creative software skills, network with agencies and designers, go on placement and take on freelance opportunities when available. My continued development along with keeping up with industry trends will therefore hold me in good stead for the future.\n\nlecture 19/09/17\n\nWe went through a range of material in regard to representation and how things are perceived as a whole.\n\nRepresentation is an essential part of process by which meaning is produced and exchanged between members of a culture. It involves the use of language, of signs and images which stand for or represent things.\n\nWe looked at a few images firstly, a dove which is seen as a representation of peace and serenity, it dates back to Greek and Roman times. In the bible it talks of Noah sending out a dove which returned with an olive branch after the great flood which spells life and growth on land.\n\nAnother being a red rose which with its powerful association to love but at the same time anger, its a passionate thing whichever regard its used. It can also be a symbol of courage through its relation to blood or in this respect bloodshed on a battlefield and therefore having the courage of a warrior.\n\nIt has a lot to do with a cultural overview. What we perceive comes from a collection of ideas and beliefs that are shared and exchanged.\n\n”Meanings can only be shared through our common access to language”\n\nI had a look into a paper by Stuart Hall which looks into representation and the significant practices. The above statement comes from that paper and he believes language is central to meaning and culture. He goes onto saying that language is one of the media through which thoughts, ideas and feelings are represented as a culture.\n\nWe all use language so the signs and visuals we see are usually that to our popular surroundings and in our own accents. These principles don’t however affect many different representations we have for things such as signage. We generally use green as our go to colour, its friendly! Red on the other hand is dangerous so it therefore must be used if there is a danger. Traffic signals are an easy way to look at how we all have a general collective understanding of moderate representations as they are almost too simple to not understand.\n\nColour theory plays an important part in representation as it is visuals in its simplest form and we all have an understanding of how colours are used across our day to day lives. For me I would say colour goes beyond even a cultural following and consists every single person as we all view certain aspects of colour to the normal things in life.\n\nMadonna and child\n\nIn the media you see photographers using the Madonna to represent that caring nature of a mother towards her child. You could say in a sense modern media uses this symbolism to represent a lot of turmoil usually and the fact that a mother will always do whats best for her child.\n\nWhat culture is, is a collective of shared opinions and ideas, its whats popular on a certain level. It is a way for a group to be assigned to something and almost is what creates stereotypes. Like if someone was to say ”the youth culture is not what it was in my day they just sit on their phones!” might be a representation of how someone has been perceived to them visually in person or through media like television. It is true that the more you see a collective of similar individuals doing the same thing, the more you tend to assign people to this viewpoint even without knowing anything about them.\n\nI believe how people are represented can have a detrimental effect in some aspects. A teenager might wear jogging bottoms and a cap but that doesn’t mean he’s a street dweller, a hooded top shouldn’t be scary but if a group is represented in a bad light this way, over and over then it is easy to expect a bad situation even if that situation may never exist.\n\nThe point is there is always going to be diversity in any culture and there is always going to be different people who may see themselves as part of the same culture but also share different beliefs in how a subject is represented.\n\nI did a project in the first year that looked at the culture of rave music in the UK and how it grew through the late 80’s and early 90’s. The way that this cultural following went from a fun new music to be shone in such a bad light, mainly down to how the police perceived its following. The media were able to represent this culture to the public in a bad way by making everyone look like drug takers and trouble causes when all they wanted to do was party. This mis- representation was down to them not being able to contain the following and just couldn’t deal with how quickly the scene grew in a time of skint 80’s early 90’s Britain, and an understaffed police force the government just couldn’t afford to police.\n\nThis is where you really have to have a reliable media network who truly speak the truth and represent the people in a fair way. It can get dangerous when people are branded for doing things that they know they don’t stand for. The government in this situation started to heavily increase penalties for holding illegal raves more and more, really just trying to stop people from even bothering holding them.\n\nHowever when you have such a cultural movement like this there is no way it’s ever going to be stopped and when people stand for this in heavy numbers it’s impossible to detain.\n\nI moved onto look at the culture in grime music and the same sort of view appeared to still be there today. This time again hooded tops and the association to crime was the reasoning for the police to deem grime events dangerous and often shuts them down. It goes to show that everything you do represents who you are but people who share interests in the same clothes doesn’t mean they have the same beliefs in everything they do just because they wear the same clothes.\n\nIt appears that this still goes on today’ taken from; https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/06/grenfell-police-gentrification-britain-black-music-urban-london\n\nAt the end of last month the general manager of Trapeze Bar in London, Jordan Wells, wrote to the organisers of a fundraiser for the victims of Grenfell Tower fire explaining that their choice of music for the event – bashment and trap – was “crap”, and he did not want to “attract a poor quality demographic” to his venue. A week later Wells has lost his job, but to many of us this incident was just another example of a black music event being shut down, following a trend over recent years.\n\nThe Metropolitan police’s infamous 696 risk assessment form acts as a bureaucratic barrier for UK grime, bashment, dancehall, drill, trap and rap. In it, event promoters and venues are asked to provide real names, stage names, phone numbers and addresses of all artists and DJs due to perform. It used to ask organisers to state the ethnicity of the target audience. That question was removed from the London form in 2009, but it has survived in similar forms created by other police forces across the country.\n\nAs you can see even though people were trying to organise an event for Grenfell, a good deed, the artists they wanted to play to that community were ridiculed by the event organiser due to the type of people it would attract. This is how uninformed people ruin an occasion by believing certain stereotypes about individuals and also their cultural following.\n\nThe revised 696 form used to ask what ethnicity would be attending each event so representation of cultures has to be strongly mediated in the correct sense and not focus on minor similarities between people who are part of the same culture.\n\nIt is tarnishing a group with the same brush, just not cricket!\n\nlecture 25/09/17\n\nWe revisited our previous lecture on representation and why the director of ‘American Beauty’ Sam Mendes would want to make that film, what does he want to get across to the audience?\n\nThe film is an insight into someones life in which there not satisfied with their seemingly perfect suburban American dream. From my point of view it always is going to depend on the directors narrative of that American dream and how he perceives it. It has a strong cultural overview and representation of how that dream is pretty much a good job, nice home and a nice wife! He shows in that film how one mans perception of this lifestyle crumbles as he seeks a little more out of life knowing he’s going to die.\n\nFrom the start there are little clues through representation that show how the constraints of this life are getting this man down. Things like cutting the red roses show how shes cutting the life supply, on the other hand for Spacey red represents sex and lust as he fantasises about his daughters friend.\n\nIt was discussed that there are two types of genre’s in American film, one that depicts the full glory of the American dream such as say ‘father of the bride’ with it’s perfect day set up! and the other being like the above ‘American Beauty’, which shows the breakdown in that represented American dream. I would agree with that and it made me think of Taxi driver which is not a film about the American dream its anything but, and more a dissatisfaction with returning from Vietnam and struggling with being potentially just a nobody. I think everyone in America aspires to be someone and the idea of it being a place where anyone can make it runs through their culture.\n\nGoing back to ‘American beauty’ the meaning behind challenging that American dream point of view is to me something that doesn’t just derive from the directors point of view but his own influence and what that dream is. As a Hollywood director you can imagine his life has all the quirks and creativity to fulfill a more real American dream. I think the idea of working behind a computer all day is on a wide scale something the majority of us don’t fancy doing all our lives. That’s another point, Spacey is portrayed in a sense behind the bars of his data on screen just to look imprisoned by his job.\n\nThe film has lots of representations of the american dream and the majority of us in the modern day don’t have that outlook on life and especially in the UK. To me it’s more of a kind of 50’s perspective of how life should be but it does still hold the frustrations in us all with dealing with just that too normal a life.\n\nItems represent their own type of cultural status. We all feel the need to possess the items which we need but more so the items in which companies make us want. If you have a product that reaches everyone on a wide scale then you are onto a winner. If you have something that represents a cultural following then even more so.\n\nConsumerism is something that runs in a tangent with cultural representation of whats current and the latest trend. A company like Apple have managed to hit the target market and covered every aspect that adheres to our needs, something nice to look at and that works and does everything you want it to. The iPhone is something that advertising has made the consumer feel they need when in reality something a tenth of it’s value will do what you need it to.\n\nThese companies use techniques to make it seem like the most needed product known to man and if you don’t have one your not part of the click! They have to be stand out year on year but now the fact that other brands have caught up on the technology side, having apple is still a lot cooler than having a Samsung!\n\nMeaning\n\nMeaning is a product of social intercourse including mediated messages via different forms of media. Representational meanings stand for the society that produces them and can be symbolic as well as mythological.\n\nFor example ”she is an English rose”\n\nThe meaning behind that is saying she is delicate like a flower and as beautiful in some aspect. So you have ways which we use certain signs to convey another message about something.\n\n”Meaning is not something that can be taken for granted, it is manufactured out of historically shifting systems of code, conventions and signs.”(Stuart Hall)\n\nWe looked at everyday items such as something as basic as a baseball cap and that itself derives many different forms of meaning from what it is attached to and even how it is presented. The item comes from American culture and has a cool nature aspect to it through sport and how it is used across a more rebellious type of fashion more associated with youth culture.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, baseball caps became a hot fashion item, propelled in large part when it became associated with hip hop music artists such as Ice Cube and Easy-E. Like Coca-Cola and McDonalds, the baseball cap became a symbol of America. Those who feared American hegemony wouldn’t get near one, but those who wanted to identify with American popular culture, began their wardrobe with a baseball cap on his or her head and sneakers on the feet.\n\nhttp://www.hatsandcaps.co.uk/history-of-the-baseball-cap-athe_baseball_cap/\n\nThe cap went from its origins in the early 1900’s as a way to represent your local team to something that took on different forms of meaning by the brands or people they became associated to them.\n\nWhen you look into someone like NWA their meaning represented their life growing up and their confrontations with police and the harsh realities of growing up in Compton. The fact that they represented a stand against the establishment and their lyrics were provocative meant that they were under the spotlight all the time from the media and people who were against certain profanities.\n\nThe baseball cap then takes on a new meaning where you have the youth wanting to be part of this rebellious youth culture and people against it viewing anyone who wears one as some sort of gangster.\n\nIt is in this respect that you can see how people assign themselves to certain items or signs can paint them with the cultural aspects that surround the sign.\n\nThe mis – representation of integrity\n\nI followed the Presidential election quite closely and it was generally a battle between what was presented as a strong America vs the new liberal left which pretty much slammed down a range of supporters for just being assigned to the opposition as did Hilary Clinton. It was extremely hard to fall for either party due to Hillary’s corruption and Trumps very loose tongue. What for me is clear that Hilary was found to be so corrupt underneath it all that it let in Donald Trump as the only other candidate who proposed a lot of good in the change of creating jobs and taking a lot of Americans out of poverty. You saw Hilary’s corruption and how she lost her way calling the supporters of Trump deplorable’s, that only worked in his favour.\n\nWhen you have someone who says he is against the banking system and wants to give back to the people, you have a very strong force in unsatisfied and poor Americans who want a slice of the pie. Whether Donald Trump has integrity in his presidency or not, people who believed the good parts of his campaign can’t be made to feel bad because of everything people assume he represents.\n\nIt’s a difficult subject but if someone promises to bring back a workforce to your town to enable you to provide for your family, does that mean you deserve to be treated in the above way, presuming you must be some sort of Nazi or racist? So how things are represented by an outlet such as the media needs to be non biased and not tarnish people for doing things they believe are morally right for them, without it harming others.\n\nThe meaning and signs behind these changes however can be diluted and what people really are voting for is not something racist, it’s something that they believe will benefit their family. The problem then is the figures you have representing Brexit like Nigel Farage and people who only focused on immigration, more so to stir up social justice types. Then the real reasons become blocked by these figures who have nothing in common with the logical solutions to what really represents people.\n\nYou have to look so deeply into the real issues and why border control is a good thing, but people generally see people fleeing war zones and want to help which is a good thing but not something that is solving problems with people here, who have a right to vote and change things to suit their own agendas.\n\nSigns are inevitably a powerful thing in political agendas and especially the less informed don’t give themselves time to look into the deeper issues. Therefore if you have bad signs/people representing something the opposition will be drawn in picking up on things that can be presented as morally wrong.\n\nFor example no one wants to stop people creating a life wherever they go in the world but whilst the poor in this country are poor with limited jobs and very low paid jobs due to European laws then there is a deeper issue and a justified one as well.\n\nMy final point is that if you have influential figures representing a cause for the wrong reasons, you have a lot of people who support the cause for different meanings yet again tarnished with the same brush when really it is a very different opinion they hold all within the same cultural following.\n\nReason for the above (essay idea)\n\nI think talking about representation really made me think how people are represented by how they carry themselves and the words they use. If you have a following of people misrepresented by the media you have the people who are reading those stories believing what is written when it could be an unjustified and false bit of information. It’s the skimming of reliable information that makes even people like scientists and academics being questioned about proven research.\n\nA look into how eastern European workforce has a negative influence on the British workforce.\n\nEddie Dempsey the leader of RMT represents the train Unions among others, gives an insight into how this affects British jobs. (Eddie wears the flat cap!)\n\nA lot of this comes down to how it benefits big companies who continue to make more and more money through things like zero contract hours. This is what people are going up against in the face of being morally good. A lot of the other panelists are supporting freedom of movement whilst having no factual benefits or the strains of this act and how it is really affecting those who work in these various industries.\n\nIt is hard to really pin point the subject matter I’m looking for and what graphical outcome I could portray. I’m thinking some source of political media framework that gives an equal overlook into peoples reasoning and facts that enables them to present themselves with integrity.\n\nEssay proposal\n\nwhat leads people to become radicalised (Proposal)\n\nWhats Bart Simpson, a radical dude!? It clearly doesn’t mean he’s off to fight with ISIS, he just goes against the grain of societies rules, but within constraints!\n\nThis article was deemed a radical solution!\n\nRadical psychoanalysis\n\nSigmund Freud believed that on the inside humans held violent and aggressive forces within, suppressed by the normalities of society. His nephew Edward Bernay’s recieved his writings on psychoanalysis and with the way that democracy was presented by Roosevelt’s government, saw two and two. He wondered whether he could control the masses with psycho analytical techniques from his Uncle Freud in a time of peace. He was able to witness how American had presented their propaganda war effort to gain involvement into the first world war. The slogan was to bring democracy to Europe.\n\nEwen (1996), pp. 162–163. “During the war years, Bernays joined the army of publicists rallied under the banner of the CPI and concentrated on propaganda efforts aimed at Latin American business interests. Within this vast campaign of “psychological warfare”, as he described it, Bernays—like others of his generation—began to develop an expanded sense of publicity and its practical uses.”\n\nBernay’s was the first person to take his Uncle’s ideas about human behaviour and apply them to manipulate the masses. He spent a number of years in the office of public relations making people want things they didn’t need by using their unconscious desires. He also had helped radicalise war efforts and army intervention throughout South America during the 50’s and 60’s working for companies who wanted to continue their influence in certain areas once a political change was made.\n\nAfter the U.S. entered the War, the Committee on Public Information hired Bernays to work for its Bureau of Latin-American Affairs, based in an office in New York. Bernays, along with Lieutenant F. E. Ackerman, focused on building support for war, domestically and abroad, focusing especially businesses operating in Latin America. Bernays referred to this work as “psychological warfare“.\n\nOne example of his non – violent radical style was a campaign to make women smoke during the Easter day parade in 1929. The way that he staged it shows his influence and how he knew how to use psychoanalysis’s viewpoints to deliver an effective campaign. He was told by A.A Brill that he needed to find a way to connect cigarettes to challenge male power then women would smoke.\n\nHe paid a group of rich debutantes to light up cigarettes during the parade in an emphatic style, he had photographers taking pictures and he had the perfect slogan ‘torches of freedom’ to tell the press and use language to appeal to women’s suppressed desire for equality. Clearly there was no benefit for women to smoke but because it was presented in such a way, to be free was something not a lot of people don’t want to be involved in. The inner desire had been achieved, linked to the statue of liberty, shes holding up a torch, all of this comes together, emotion, memory and a rational phrase.\n\nESSAY\n\nJoe Sleney -What leads people to become radicalised\n\nHow we engage with the web\n\nWhat are the different uses/types of websites?\n\nPersonal Websites\n\nThe use of a personal website would be to profile and characterise what your about and what your product is. It’s a way for someone like an individual, a freelance designer for example who wants to gain his clientel. This can come in the form of a blog or portfolio website and something that me as a graphic designer will be looking towards.\n\nPhoto Sharing Websites\n\nSomething like flikr or photobucket is a way for people to solely upload images to an area. The benefit would be to get a portfolio of photography work out to whatever audience you wish, whether its for your own personal project or to pass onto someone as reference for work.\n\nWriters / Authors Websites\n\nJK Rowling’s website is very minimal and just gives a basic profile of who she is without being too Harry Potter over the top! There’s a few script fonts here and there with almost scribe and drawings set out on the page. It’s what you would expect of a writer and most from who I look like try and keep it minimal just with references to their work and current news. There really not concerned with any graphical elements as being a writer is all in the words so some sites even look incredibly outdated like Stephen King’s\n\nCommunity Building Website’s\n\nThe obvious ones are Facebook and Twitter and they can be good for being able to connect to a large number of different audiences. In the beginning of twitter it was a great way to be in contact with friends and seeing what there upto. It became a minefield of media posts eventually as it is today and that took the personal connection element away. You now have people willy nilly sharing social justice posts and it’s become disengaged from what it was all about originally.\n\nRant over but twitter is one of my favourites as you generally only see posts by the people you follow but it’s true they have become a platform of media however good news and more relevant to current issues from what you want or choose to see.\n\nThere both good platforms to bring people together and it’s a way for people to get their opinions, work and relevant matters out into the wide world.\n\nMobile Device Websites\n\nResponsive websites work in regard to all sites but when it comes to the smallest viewer possible it’s probably going to be a phone. So these particular sites need to work in regards to the context they display and scale.\n\nScale and content is vital as you’ve got to get all the most relevant information on as possible and try not to be cluttered with too much information. You tend to have a menu with a breakdown of the site with the newest information shown on the home page.\n\nSomething like google maps is generally in today’s society always going to be used on the go usually on a mobile whilst trying to find somewhere, maybe just on foot or whilst driving. It therefore needs to be clear and easily accessible in putting in the destination and finding the route your looking for quickly.\n\nA purchasing site will need all the basics in product displaying as well as some way of being able to enter payment details.\n\nBlogs\n\nBlogs are just like the ones were using here with WordPress. They are there to get your voice out and containing research projects and portfolio’s. They are there to work alongside projects and it’s the best way to record all your findings in one place.\n\nInformational Website’s\n\nAs it says on the time they are there to provide information in a clear and understanding way. Something like the BBC is the most popular website used in the UK so it has to be functional in every possible way, easily navigable and non complicated in order for everyone to be able to simply use. You have your catagories like sport, news, weather, i player etc all as headers and your only 3 clicks from any bit of info you need to know. The articles appear in blog format for the latest news so you can scroll pretty much on a timeline to keep up with current affairs.\n\nOnline Business Brochure/Catalogue\n\nTake Argos for example, they have a website by which it is set out into various catagories, making it easier to find the product your looking for. Same with a lot of websites you get it appearing with the current deals and discounts in a kind of blog formation. Needs to be clear and concise and yet again be able to be used by the masses.\n\nDirectory Website’s\n\nI like what Yell have done in having a nice big picture on there home screen straight away and it’s a simple search engine to find the business your looking for, google can pretty much do this sort of job for you but when your searching for specific business in certain areas they can be really helpful.\n\nE-commerce Websites\n\nE commerce is vital in modern day society as it allows the instant movement of trade and goods between two destinations. It is the ability to create an online basket of goods just like that which a catalogue site such as littlwoods would have. There is an everyday need for this to make shopping be able to exist from home and the transactions done on a daily basis between businesses.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a website?\n\n.To hit your customer clientel in a digital sense.\n\nIts less expensive than printed media and having to fork out the costs that come with producing leaflets and flyers.\n\nAdvertising is a good way of boosting your profit and companies who can attract big clients will generally be the ones highest up in their field ranking.\n\nYou have the satisfaction that your have a product a customer can refer to. A fully functional site that is kept up to day is an easy reference point to be able to pass onto people who want to know about your product, therefore increasing your custom.\n\nIt is a fresh reference point and if you can keep your range up to date you become trustworthy in the clients eyes and if they can see that the effort is being made to satisfy their online needs of you, then you will keep them interested in visiting again.\n\nThere is always an option to link your site with that of others and if you fit into someones field, for example you make kitchen equipment, you may have someone like IKEA linking to you for something like knives and forks if it were specialist enough. Lots of companies will do this as it works like SEO in bumping up company profile and then profits.\n\nIt gives you the c chance to develop a wide range of clientel. Online you can appeal to the whole world and if you can get someone who buys into your services everyday it’s a good way of keeping them on board by regularly reinventing and developing your site.\n\nWhat is SEO and why is it important to businesses?\n\nSEO or Search Engine Optimisation is the name given to activity that attempts to improve search engine rankings.\n\nIn search results Google TM displays links to pages it considers relevant and authoritative. Authority is mostly measured by analysing the number and quality of links from other web pages.\n\nIn simple terms your web pages have the potential to rank in Google TM so long as other web pages link to them.\n\nhttps://www.redevolution.com/what-is-seo\n\nSEO is important to businesses because it is a way for them to appear as close to the top of the pecking order as possible. If you have a company that sells balloons for example, there is also going to be others more than likely with balloon in their business name. If you can do the right SEO you can link your site to other popular sites in that field and the more hits it gets through link the the higher your company name will appear in google so it can be very important in that sense.\n\nWhat makes an effective/ineffective website?\n\nBeing an effective site it firstly has to be functional to it’s need. If your trying to sell something then E commerce is going to be needed on a daily basis, if it’s just information like a blog then it has to be clear and easily readable.\n\nYou have to attract your target audience, trying to bring in new custom regardless of whether you sell something or not, it has to have a function that people are looking for. Something like the BBC is a great example as they are a current news channel, everyone looks to it for the latest news in local or worldwide aspects. It’s function is to be easily navigable giving you topic categories in order to make everything within 3 clicks.\n\nIt needs to be clean and tidy no matter what sort of promotion or product your selling. No one likes mess and your website has to be concise and portray a message about what your about and being messy, no one is going to want to look further. This comes down to layout, typography, the colours you use etc. It needs to be readable and well organised as a priority.\n\nBeing ineffective will of course be the opposite, if people are forever trying to find something out about your business they wont look far until they look to the next competitor.\n\nWhat are the ways by which we access the web today?\n\nWe have come a long way in such a short space of time since dial up internet was around with it’s beyond annoying sounds of trying to connect. We now have a multi range of products by which you can access the internet.\n\nYou have your general laptops, computers where at home your internet can run fast enough to download a whole film in less than 5 minutes. I’ve had a phone where in say 2000 having the old internet games on a phone was unbelievable, but now it’s almost unthinkable how far it’s gone. You now have phones that you can run your life from, tablets for whilst your sat around chilling or on the way to a destination, smart TV’s, internet cafes. The list goes on but there your main ways of access for viewing sites and so forth.\n\nWhat are the strengths/limitations of modern web devices?\n\nThe main strength now is that you have access with high speed internet on the go with most devices being mobile. It allows for transactions to be done on the move speeding up the general economy massively, as more can generally be done even with just having a phone in your pocket. It means that everyone has access to many markets on the move so it can be easy to if need be, send a friend a quick loan when there in trouble, buy an item for a birthday present etc. Whatever it is even if it’s not a purchase it’s a world of information that people can constantly have access to for a small price. For what you can learn from the internet it’s a wealth of knowledge and if used right can help for learning resources in a wide variety, pretty much everything about anything!\n\nIf say you use a phone for watching lots of media then your limited by your screen size of course and fatigue with your eyes can’t be good, as well as trying to hold your phone in a particular position for too long. It really comes down to what your using your device for, screen size is of course the major issue with mobile devices but they serve a purpose for being go between that and a desktop computer or your smart TV.\n\nI wouldn’t class it as a limitation because I wouldn’t treat them for trying to do too much. You need to realise what the device is and accept it for what it is. It’s main function firstly to be a mobile phone so it’s there to help you out with the odd bit of info, a quick selfie, check on Facebook etc and that’s always more than enough while being in between a PC.\n\nElements of a website\n\nThe first website I’ve decided to look into is Stone Island. It’s one of them where like Burberry they had that street dweller appeal and it was cool for the rude boys to wear and potentially end it’s credibility. The products however remain as a wanted item from anybody due to the quality of garments they put out and their website captures that quality element in what their products are all about.\n\nSTONE ISLAND\n\nA culture of research, experimentation, function and use are the matrices that have always defined Stone Island: the sportswear brand established in 1982 in Ravarino, in the Modena area, by the genius that is Massimo Osti, Art Director and Bolognese intellectual.\n\nWithin just one year Carlo Rivetti came onto the scene. Having bought, with the GFT, 50% of Osti’s company in 1983, he took over the whole of the company in 1993, with his sister Cristina, promising the continuity that over the years had reinforced the DNA of the brand.\n\nDestined to become a symbol of extreme research in fibres and textiles, applied to an innovative design, it is known as the brand that’s redefined the common understanding of sportswear. Having immediately become a cult phenomenon, still today it maintains its position as a contemporary point of reference for younger generations.\n\nStone Island’s strength lies in its unique capacity to work on the finished garment, via continuous experimentation with dyes and treatments created in the Sportswear Company’s colour laboratory. A department capable of combining advanced technology, experience and human capacity, that over the years has developed more than 60,000 different dye recipes.\n\nhttp://www.stoneisland.com/experience/en/the-brand/brand-philosophy/\n\nThe layout is simple in design and has that contemporary feel about it without being too designed. I love that there is some pen tooling going on in the first screen shot I’ve displayed, which gives it an edge and a visual appeal to me, something I’ve used in my work prior.\n\nI love full page websites but this one is centered however that works well for this site as it follows from the main photo into sections and categories of their apparel.\n\nWidespread sites for me show clarity and a lot of the time the quality of photo really makes for a good opening page. It can make it look a bit too much like an app sometimes so I think I would leave out using it too often and maybe only for the landing page on my own site.\n\nBit off topic! The Stone Island site doesn’t use full page photography until you delve into the inner meaning behind their brand and you find that as a company they strive for quality and have thousands of colour and texture arrangements for their products which shows how they really are kind of a bespoke design company where they have a lot of flair and and extremely competent in creating colourful iconic designs.\n\nI found a new article and video which comes more with branding and the other project I’m currently working on ‘Graphics and the branding language’ but the company present themselves with a new contemporary style and are really starting to show what there about and it is far from any kind of cheap football wear.\n\nLAB AND LIFE, STONE ISLAND’S TWO SOULS.\n\nLAB is the constant, scrutinising and boundless investigation into the transformation and enhancement of fibres and fabrics, which brings discoveries of new materials and production techniques that have never previously been used in the clothing industry. From here, many projects are born: – Jackets constructed in nylon monofilament, deriving from the water filtering technology, – highly reflective or thermo-sensitive fabrics, changing colour with the variation of temperature – featherweight polyester cloth vacuum- coated with a 100% stainless steel film used in aviation technology to protect the on-board computers – non-woven materials, Kevlar® and polyester felt, these are some examples of materials conceived by Stone Island philosophy.\n\nLIFE is the lived experience, the identity, the perceived status of anyone who wears Stone Island. It’s the strong and recognisable aesthetic that originates from the study of uniforms and work clothes, recreated with new needs in mind, to define a project where the function of the garment is never just aesthetic.\n\nhttp://www.stoneisland.com/experience/en/the-brand/brand-philosophy/\n\nI do like how they layout their product ranges, the example below is of their denim range.\n\nThe colours used in general for type descriptions, headers, their logo etc are black with a white background. I would say that when it’s a website with a colourful product range, this is the best way to be able to display clearly what their items are whilst also looking contemporary and stylish. The range is clearly set out which makes it easy to navigate around, the header and footer are simple in black and white which is the norm for these types of specialist brands but it works and their photography speaks for itself and includes some video content which shows their advertising reels.\n\nTheir shop is also black and white and simple to navigate around. For me the continuation of black and white is a bit plain but it’s fully functional and exactly whats needed.\n\nThey simply have their social media at the top with their login/register tab and shopping bag, the footer displays details on their flagship store, newsletter, site FAQ’s, customer care, shipping and returns. The site works well and generally communicates that simplicity in design but elaborates with bold photography to do the talking and speak for itself. I would like to change it up to include more colour but I don’t feel it even needs that. I like how they have some hand drawn elements in there with a new junior range but i don’t think that has to be child relative and this theme could be used to brighten up backdrops of certain areas in their site like their product catalogue, that is being picky but I believe a contemporary brand can be revitalised a bit with more colour just like their range of clothing.\n\nI personally like they’re product range layouts and how easy it is to navigate so that would be my main things to take from the stone island site and work to structure my work clearly in catagories like they have done their product ranges.\n\nThe BBC\n\nThe BBC has to be about as functional as it can be and it works well in regards to being easily navigable. Everything you need to know is near enough within three clicks and with such a wide variety of news that is a job well done. They use a simple centered layout with the main feature story appearing bigger than the rest, nothing new but it will work by assigning the most current news articles in order to be relevant to the latest story.\n\nIts not generally the most pretty decorated site however it serves it’s purpose, the theme throughout the iplayer, music section, sport, etc is that centered alignment but I think it works and makes it easy to pick up the latest story with the clear text and images they use.\n\nThe headers open up to their relevant fields such as sport will give u it’s own dedicated page but then you can go into your relevant sport etc etc. Either way it’s very simple to get around and decorative enough through the sample pictures and videos of each story.\n\nThere appears to be no real interactive elements to the site apart from a bit of coulour and lines where hovering over hearers and of course the video element. The site is however all about reading or watching news, music etc so it communicates their services well and works to be easily read.\n\nFor me I don’t think it could be made much clearer, I personally would want it featuring a different range of pages where by the layout may be slightly altered to make it not as cluttered, maybe using some bigger images here and there. There is nothing too glamorous about news the best part of the time though so it can’t be design based at the end of the day which is it’s only downfall but that isn’t what they’re trying to portray, just functionality.\n\nNational Geographic\n\nUnlike the BBC, National Geographic doesn’t have to have so much going on, the site isn’t generally as cluttered. It’s actually a lot more visually appealing to me, I do like full screen pictures from time to time as it gives more significance to the topic it covers.\n\nI like the way the menu bar works as it appears from the side and each topic then branches off into the next segment clearly.\n\nSelf promotion online\n\nWhen promoting online the main outlets people go to first is you social media. You have Facebook, Instagram and twitter for example, these platforms are great for reaching a large audience. The best thing about social media is that it is free and say your a self promoting new start up it’s going to be something all your friends see at least.\n\nWhat then happens is that you will have certain friends who might do you a bit of a favour and share your promotional article, this will then reach an even further field. In this instance it is always upto the people and rely’s upon people sharing and people caring to look into your business.\n\nWhat you can also do now is buy advertising slots that will appear as a suggested post on peoples feed. This really isn’t my cup of tea and I tend to just scroll straight past them but it’s a new form of promotion and a good way to be seen by someone further a field who also has no direct link back to you.\n\nIt always depends on the product and placement of your adverts need to be in the right areas to reach the right audiences. One other way is to think about the 3 big local listings services, google places allows it to be found more easily on Google searches and it shows up on Google Maps. Another is Yahoo local and Bing which are both free of charge.\n\nAs a designer the best promotion is always going to be word of mouth, doing a good job for someone who then holds you in respect for the future or someone else they know. The best place to start as a designer is to create a personal website as this is the best place to have all your work in one form. What you then do is promote with other advertisements to draw people to your website and your collection of work. A nice website that is functional and displays your work orderly will then give any possibly employees an idea of your capabilities.\n\nYou can then further SEO your website in order to get it up in the ratings and to the top of the list in your particular field. Keeping your webpage simple and choosing the right name will be a good way to keeping you up there because if you choose something complicated or related to another company they may also be doing all they can to stay at the top.\n\nMethods of web design\n\nThere are various different platforms that enable you to create online content. Various programmes like WordPress have enabled users to be able to have more assistance and tools in building a site that has a professional feel.\n\nThe great thing about WordPress is that there is an array of various themes that give you customisations that all have various different plugins and arrangements in their look and use. What WordPress has done is move away from programmes like Muse and made it a lot more simpler for the average user to get to grips with it’s software. What they have done is given the option for people to work with custom templates where you can basically just drop in your work and it arranges it to the look of the theme. For people who want to manipulate the software further the coding with CSS and html still available in the background, so you can further fix problems yourself or add certain elements that may not be part of you theme.\n\nAs a graphic designer I must have a form of accessible work so the best thing for me to do is to have a website in order to show clients all my work in one place. Whether it’s WordPress or any other web making programme a website is one of the best forms of promoting yourself. Start by handing someone a business card and if you’ve just got a Facebook on there or some kind of social media contact, it doesn’t for one look as professional as your own branded webpage.\n\nProgrammes other than WordPress include Dreamweaver which enables you to build fluid layouts for web, tablets and mobile devices. It is a platform that needs the more experienced web builder to use and although it has elements of help and tutorials available it doesn’t come close to what WordPress offers the average user.\n\nWhen you look at Dreamweaver you can see how generally it is inundated with coding elements, something you get in WordPress but the Visual composer basically writes the coding for you making it far superior and taking that more complicated element away.\n\nMuse is a programme part of the adobe software and works just like photoshop and others where you build up your website in certain layers. What you can do is design for example buttons in photoshop and set them that way before bringing into muse. This is one thing it’s really good for because it gives you the ability to have a lot for customisation options. If you have an understanding of photoshop you can create icons and images that use html coding.\n\nOne thing I have come across is how you can actually create a template in Muse and then upload to a certain plugin that works with WordPress. This video explains how you go from creating images in Photoshop to uploading them as interactive buttons in WordPress.\n\nAll in all there are a lot of available software when it comes to building web content. WordPress really is the daddy to put it! in regards to the way it has started to give graphic designers that extra platform to add to their CV. What programmes like Dreamweaver do is give the people who are fully custom to general coding the ability to create all the back end from scratch. Unless you know what you’re doing this is some of the most time consuming work possible and you have to be a real geek to get along with it.\n\nMuse would work really well especially as a designer who is used to using Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign, due to the ability it gives you to have customisation in creating your own buttons whilst WordPress is set themes that do all that bit for you, giving you certain options across each theme.\n\nWebsites and their functionality\n\nWhen looking through websites today there seems to be in certain areas, trends that which were only a couple of years ago were innovative are now becoming quite stagnant. Having a menu at the top with a logo in one corner the menu the other seems to be the general workings of a site. For a lot of companies like the BBC or any other media outlet, they are there to provide you headlines, articles and subject catagories. At the end of the day if a site serves it’s audience then it works. As technology moves forward the way that we access the internet will probably work in a much more interactive way that gives you that almost pleasing to the eye feel. What I want to see is us using our hands to pull open articles when it comes to someone like the BBC! it will give it more appeal to someone like me who wants everything to work like virtual reality!\n\nA lot of sites have to be like this at the minute, especially if it’s a site used for ecommerce as you generally have all your catagories stewed across the top, you hover over and it drops down into sub catagories. It all works and for a lot of people that is enough, your not going online to be entertained constantly, your going there to make purchases in the easiest possible ways!\n\nA lot of these brand eCommerce sites and big stockists like John Lewis can be image driven and need to be that way to display the clothes they’re selling. A lot of the sides aren’t full page, they’re generally within a 1000 pixel block. The JD sports site does this with a boxed central area, at the moment this shows all the sale offers as it is just after Christmas. Generally these will be the sections were all the new gear will be shown, but whatever is the more popular at the time.\n\nThe second page then opens up into still a boxed section but a bigger one so that it can accommodate things like the brands included, sizing etc.\n\nSite Styles I like\n\nI found a fantastic design agency called Uprising based in Italy, who have gone above and beyond what you could expect from an interactive website. Whilst scrolling through the site you are introduced so so many videos and interactive text it’s untrue. It’s one of my most favourites and the detail that’s gone into creative interactively fronted projects gives it so much depth, especially with it being video and sound driven.\n\nhttp://www.weareuprising.com/menu\n\nEvery image on their landing page is pretty much 3D and interactive, when you hover over the shapes for the menu and the about section, you get these shapes breaking up into pieces. It works so well and is so entertaining making your way through their projects and that’s what a design agency should do, keep you engaged with their work through elements that aren’t just a standard click and scroll.\n\nAs you go into their projects the about screen flickers and smashes into pieces like I managed to just catch below.\n\nWhat Uprising are is generally a web development agency and some of their clients include the likes of Armani and Fendi. They are master in HTML5 coding and from exploring their site you can see how good they are at making their websites hands on and interactive.\n\nA lot of sites seem to run wit the s"
