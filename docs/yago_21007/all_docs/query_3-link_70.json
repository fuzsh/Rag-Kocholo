        "text": "EASTENDERS star Steve McFadden has become part of the furniture in Albert Square that fans may have forgotten his cameo in comedy Kevin and Perry Go Large.\n\nThe actor - who has played hardman Phil Mitchell for 31 years - starred in the coming of age film based on the Harry Enfield sketch Kevin the Teenager back n 2000.\n\nBut EastEnders fans may not remember that legendary soap star Steve played a minor role in the hit film.\n\nThe spin-off focuses on two desperate teenagers who travel to Ibiza to expose their musical talent to a wider audience and, more importantly, to lose their virginity.\n\nDespite having adult supervision along for the ride, the pair soon cross paths with a world famous DJ and spot the girls of their dreams.\n\nThe boys meet Eye Ball Paul, played by Rhys Ifans, who plays their track in a club and kickstarts their career.\n\nKevin and Perry try to to enter popular nightclub Amnesia - while their parents debate whether to join them.\n\nThe youngster head inside to party as Kevin's dad asks an unimpressed security guard how much the tickets are.\n\nEagle-eyed fans will notice that Steve plays the bouncer, who responds: \"No concessions for senior citizens.\"\n\nFans were thrilled to see Steve, who joined EastEnders in 1990, make an appearance in a slightly different role.\n\nBut over in Albert Square, things have turned into a nightmare for Phil who is being hunted by police for Vincent Hubbard's murder.\n\nViewers know he didn’t kill Vincent, Aidan Maguire did, but the Fox’s don’t care and have conspired to have him arrested.\n\nLast week, Phil discovered the plot and planned to snatch son Raymond and flee for another life.\n\nBut as Sharon desperately tried to appeal to Phil’s better nature - it looked like she was getting through to him.\n\nHowever when Jack and Denise arrived with Kat it all kicked off.\n\nDenise screamed at Phil to get away from Raymond - who was happily sat in his car seat - while Jack asked him if a murder charge wasn’t enough.\n\nThat tipped Phil over the edge and he ran around and got into the car and began to drive off.\n\nDenise eventually ran over to the side of the car to bang on it where Raymond was sitting.\n\nBut none of them stood in the way to block Phil from driving off and going on the run."
