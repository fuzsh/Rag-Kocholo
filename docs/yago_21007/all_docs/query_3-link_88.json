        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n23 Aug 2021, 15:31\n\nA couple of absolute legends have received praise from Kathy Burke for their recreation of Kevin and Perry, and deservedly so!\n\nSo uncanny was their resemblance to the iconic comedy characters, that when a video emerged from Hardwick Live showing two festival-goers dancing, it took a second (and even a third) look for many people to realise that it wasn’t actually a clip of Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke’s Kevin and Perry.\n\nBurke’s Perry Carter was the best friend of surly Kevin The Teenager in Harry Enfield’s massively popular sketch show in the 1990s. Perry’s highlights from the show include how polite he always was to Kevin’s mum (“Yes Mrs Patterson”), and how he went to Manchester for the weekend and came back looking and sounding like Liam Gallagher.\n\nThe teenage characters were so popular that a feature film about them, entitled Kevin and Perry Go Large, was released in 2000. Burke and Enfield starred in the titular roles.\n\nWriting on Twitter today (August 23), Burke said of the doppelgangers: “If I wasn’t so much older and wider I’d swear this was me! Lovely stuff.”\n\nOther Twitter users loved the fancy dress too. One person wrote: “You could have told me this was Harry Enfield and Kathy Burke and I would have believed you. Amazing effort!”\n\nAnother added: “I thought it was them too! Got the mannerisms down and everything.”\n\nSomeone else said: “Going to be lost on so many people but absolute genius.”\n\nElsewhere, somebody suggested: “All the young folk in the video probably have no idea what’s going on.”\n\nConsidering that Hardwick Live saw acts such as Nile Rodgers & CHIC and Rag 'n' Bone Man putting in great performances, it’s quite a testament to how good these two impersonators were that they seem to have come away as the stars of the festival!"
