Putting out an EP on 7” vinyl is something we haven’t had the opportunity to do for a long time, so having two new songs to offer up on such a classic format is fun for us as vinyl enthusiasts. Both ‘At Sickness’ and ‘The Sacrifice’ were initially written and recorded for our Blood, Hair, and Eyeballs album and leaving them off the record wasn’t an easy decision. It was done merely in the interest of the full-length’s running time, which we wanted to keep under 40 minutes. We’re psyched that these two numbers are being released and will be available on their own special format, no less.”\n\nHaving just completed a run of nightly singalongs with some of the largest and most enthusiastic European crowds they’ve ever drawn, Skiba, bassist/vocalist Dan Andriano and drummer Atom Willard have been working the road nonstop since the January 26, 2024 release of Blood, Hair, and Eyeballs — the 10th Alkaline Trio album and first on Rise Records. The new songs have been meshing seamlessly with classics and deep cuts from landmark Trio works including Agony & Irony, Crimson, Good Mourning, From Here to Infirmary, Maybe I’ll Catch Fire, Goddamnit and more, with the band in top form night after night.

Self-portrait. London, 1963. Pigmented inkjet print. Collection of the artist. © 1963 Paul McCartney under exclusive license to MPL Archive LLP\n\nNearly 60 years after The Beatles performed their final concert at Candlestick Park, Beatlemania is back in the Bay. Organized by the National Portrait Gallery, London, and presented exclusively in California at the de Young museum, Paul McCartney Photographs 1963–1964: Eyes of the Storm will present more than 250 personal photos by Paul McCartney, video clips, and archival materials, that offer a behind-the-scenes look into the meteoric rise of the world’s most celebrated band.\n\n“In Eyes of the Storm, recently unearthed photographs by Paul McCartney provide a rare time capsule of The Beatles’ world at the moment of their extraordinary rise to fame,” remarked Thomas P. Campbell, Director and CEO of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. “Well known as one of the world’s most famous musical stars, it is a revelation to discover McCartney’s proficiency as a photographer, documenting everything from the band’s quieter moments and friendships to the ‘Beatlemania’ of the time. We’re honored to present this exhibition here in San Francisco, where The Beatles left an indelible mark on our city’s musical and cultural history.”\n\nEyes of the Storm captures a period from December 1963 through February 1964 when The Beatles performed in concert halls across England and toured in the United States. McCartney’s images reveal the intensity of life on tour, as The Beatles were whisked from concerts to hotels, trailed by enthusiastic fans from New York to Miami. Photographs of screaming crowds and paparazzi illustrate the sheer magnitude of the group’s superstardom. In stark contrast, behind-closed-doors images captured by McCartney highlight the humor and individuality of the band members on their days off. Eyes of the Storm invites visitors to witness The Beatles’ journey to stardom, from local venues in Liverpool to the Ed Sullivan Show and worldwide acclaim. McCartney’s photographs of the four band members existed as unprinted negatives and contact sheets for 60 years. Rediscovered in the artist’s personal archive in 2020, these images offer new insight into the band, their fans, and the early 1960s, as seen through the eyes of Paul McCartney.\n\n“In this exhibition, we glimpse McCartney both behind and in front of the lens, as he bears witness to a pivotal cultural moment through the camera with a keen artistic eye,” said organizing curator Sally Martin Katz. “From portraiture to landscapes and documentary shots, McCartney demonstrates a deep understanding of the formal styles prevalent in early 1960s photography. Throughout the exhibition, nods to New Wave, documentary filmmaking, and photojournalism underscore McCartney’s multifaceted approach to capturing the spirit of the time.”\n\nOpening March 1, 2025 at the de Young museum, Paul McCartney Photographs 1963–64: Eyes of the Storm will run through July 6.\n\nAbout Paul McCartney\n\nBorn in Liverpool, England, Paul McCartney rose to prominence as a founding member of The Beatles. Throughout his lifetime, McCartney has played a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of popular music and culture.\n\nExhibition Organization Paul McCartney Photographs 1963–1964: Eyes of the Storm is organized by the National Portrait Gallery, London, in collaboration with Paul McCartney. It is curated by Paul McCartney with Sarah Brown for MPL Communications and Rosie Broadley for the National Portrait Gallery, London. The presentation at the de Young museum is organized by coordinating curator Sally Martin Katz.\n\nPresenting Sponsor\n\nJohn A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn\n\nLead Sponsor\n\nMichael Taylor Trust\n\nMajor Support\n\nLisa and Douglas Goldman Fund\n\nGenerous Support\n\nNick and Sandra Javaras\n\nAdditional support is provided by Jan and Bob Newman.\n\nAbout the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco\n\nThe Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, comprising the de Young in Golden Gate Park and the Legion of Honor in Lincoln Park, is the largest public arts institution in San Francisco.\n\nThe de Young museum originated from the 1894 California Midwinter International Exposition in Golden Gate Park. The present copper-clad landmark building, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, opened in 2005. Reflecting an active conversation among cultures, perspectives, and time periods, the collections on view include American painting, sculpture, and decorative arts from the 17th to the 21st centuries; arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas; costume and textile arts; and international modern and contemporary art.\n\nThe Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco are located on land unceded by the Ramaytush Ohlone, who are the original inhabitants of what is now the San Francisco Peninsula. The greater Bay Area is also the ancestral territory of other Ohlone peoples, as well as the Miwok, Yokuts, and Patwin. We acknowledge, recognize, and honor the Indigenous ancestors, elders, and descendants whose nations and communities have lived in the Bay Area over many generations and continue to do so today. We respect the enduring relationships that exist between Indigenous peoples and their homelands. We are committed to partnering with Indigenous communities to raise awareness of their legacy and engage with the history of the region, the impacts of genocide, and the dynamics of settler colonialism that persist today.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nMorgan Braitberg, Publicist, press@famsf.org\n\nPAUL McCARTNEY AND WINGS – ONE HAND CLAPPING\n\nRARE FILM & BONUS FEATURES COMING TO CINEMAS WORLDWIDE FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR LIMITED SCREENINGS BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 26\n\nAN INTIMATE LOOK AT 1974 ABBEY ROAD RECORDING SESSIONS – FEATURING:– PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED IN FULL FOOTAGE OF SOLO ACOUSTIC PERFORMANCE BY PAUL McCARTNEY THE BACKYARD SESSIONS\n\n-A NEW EXCLUSIVE FILMED INTRODUCTION BY PAUL McCARTNEY\n\n-UNSEEN POLAROIDS\n\nTICKETS ON SALE STARTING AUGUST 16 AT ONEHANDCLAPPING.FILM\n\nEXCLUSIVE CLIP FROM BAND ON THE RUN AVAILABLE HERE\n\nDOWNLOAD THE OFFICIAL POSTER HERE\n\nTrafalgar Releasing and Mercury Studios announced today an opportunity for audiences to step back in time to 1974 and witness the magic of Paul McCartney and Wings – One Hand Clapping. A captivating film, filmed on video tape capturing the look and feel of the time, exploring their historic recording session at Abbey Road Studios, will premiere as an exclusive cinema event beginning September 26th. This behind-the-scenes look delves into the making of the acclaimed One Hand Clapping album, featuring rare footage, interviews with the band, insights from the creative team, and more. Relive iconic Wings hits, a reimagined Beatles classic, and captivating performances on the big screen.\n\n“It’s so great to look back on that period and see the little live show we did. We made a pretty good noise actually! It was a great time for the band, we started to have success with Wings, which had been a long time coming.” – Paul McCartney\n\nIn addition to the full film directed by David Litchfield, the event will feature the previously unreleased Backyard Sessions, showcasing Paul McCartney on acoustic guitar performing beloved tracks from his catalog. Highlights include the previously unreleased song “Blackpool” and covers of personal favorites like “Twenty Flight Rock,” the song he played for John Lennon during their first meeting. The screenings also boast an exclusive filmed introduction by Paul McCartney and previously unseen Polaroid photographs from the sessions.\n\nTickets for Paul McCartney and Wings – One Hand Clapping will be available beginning Friday, August 16 at onehandclapping.film. Fans are encouraged to sign up for additional information.\n\n“We are looking forward to bringing the legendary music of Paul McCartney to the big screen and offering fans a front-row seat to his enduring legacy,” said Marc Allenby, CEO, Trafalgar Releasing. “This cinematic experience will transport audiences back to a golden era of rock and roll while captivating new fans with the magic of this iconic band. It’s a must-see event for music lovers of all generations.”\n\n“We are excited to be partnering with MPL on the global debut of Paul McCartney and Wings – One Hand Clapping” said Amy Freshwater, VP of Acquisitions who secured the film alongside Will White, SVP of Content Sales for Mercury Studios. “We are working closely with MPL to release a brand-new project in honour of the 50th anniversary. Mercury Studios are handling all media sales and are delighted to pair with Trafalgar Releasing for the initial theatrical release as we bring this very special treat to audiences worldwide.”\n\nOne Hand Clapping showcased Wings’ new line-up, fresh off their return from Nashville where they recorded the classic single “Junior’s Farm”. Following the sudden departure of Denny Seiwell and Henry McCullough the previous year on the eve of recording the Wings masterpiece, released the year previously, Band on the Run, Paul (vocals, bass, piano, electric piano, Hammond organ, celeste, harmonium, acoustic guitar), Linda (Moog, electric piano, Mellotron, tambourine, backing vocals) and Denny Laine (vocals, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, bass) were now joined by guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton. Additionally joining the band in the studio were orchestral arranger Del Newman and saxophonist Howie Casey, who had previously played with Paul in Hamburg and would go on to join the Wings touring band.\n\nOpening with an instrumental jam that would become the One Hand Clapping theme song, the intimate film features live-in-studio renditions of Wings classics, including “Live and Let Die”, “Band on the Run”, “Jet” and “My Love”. During the film Paul talks about his enjoyment at working in a band, his writing process and how he thought at 14 he might have a future as a cabaret singer. We hear from band members about their experience of being part of Wings and working with Paul. Paul is seen performing side by side with Linda and there are even some impressive Karate displays by drummer Geoff Britton.\n\nOne Hand Clapping serves as a celebration of the enduring legacy of Paul McCartney and Wings. It captured a moment when Wings had found and defined their signature sound – just as Paul had shaped popular culture the decade before with The Beatles, he was doing it once again in the 70s with Wings. This film gives an insight into the inner workings of the band as they work and play together in the studio. Regarding the band in their recent album coverage, Pitchfork said “…the version of Wings that McCartney corralled for the One Hand Clapping sessions exhibited the laser focus and playful spontaneity of a tight knit rock’n’roll band that seemed to have put in their 10,000 hours in just a few weeks.”\n\nThe film, an intimate look at the recording, originally shot on 1970s videotape, has been scanned and restored at 4K. The between song dialogue has been de-mixed using Wingnut’s MAL software and the film features a new Dolby Atmos audio mix by Steve Orchard and Giles Martin.\n\nReleased in June, the album One Hand Clapping (order HERE) opens with an instrumental jam – the One Hand Clapping theme song. The album features live-in-studio renditions of Wings mega-hits “Live and Let Die,” “Band on the Run,” “Jet,” “My Love,” “Hi, Hi, Hi,” “Junior’s Farm,” Paul McCartney’s much loved solo song “Maybe I’m Amazed,” reworked extracts of Beatles’ classics “Let It Be,” “The Long and Winding Road,” and “Lady Madonna,” the Moody Blues’ hit “Go Now” with Denny Laine singing, and a Paul solo piano version of the Harry Akst/Benny Davis Tin Pan Alley classic “Baby Face.”\n\nUpon release, One Hand Clapping hit the Top 10 across Europe and has been critically praised. MOJO called it “Freewheeling and powerful” (4/5), while Uncut declared, “It’s a lovely record: McCartney is typically chipper, the song selection outstanding and the sound fabulous” (8/10). Record Collector added, “McCartney’s ineluctable creativity shines” (4/5), and Classic Pop Magazine enthused, “Macca unleashed deserves a round of applause” (4.5/5).\n\nAbout Mercury Studios\n\nMercury Studios is a full-service production studio, focused on telling compelling stories through the lens of music.\n\nCurrent and recent projects include Oscar and BAFTA award nominated American Symphony, directed by Matthew Heineman for the Obamas’ Higher Ground Productions/Netflix, If These Walls Could Sing, directed by Mary McCartney for Disney+, My Life as a Rolling Stone for the BBC and MGM+, Shania Twain: Not Just A Girl for Netflix, This Town, a six-part series for the BBC from writer, creator, and executive producer Steven Knight, Linda Perry: Let it Die Here, which premiered at Tribeca Film Festival and the recently announced One to One: John & Yoko from Oscar and BAFTA award winning director, Kevin Macdonald.\n\nMercury Studios also produced Sam Smith: Live at the Royal Albert Hall for BBC, Billie Eilish’s Overheated at the O2 London and Lang Lang Plays Disney for Disney+.\n\nEditorially independent, Mercury Studios is powered by Universal Music Group and represents the world’s leading catalogue of music-related content, consisting of thousands of hours of premium music-driven film and television programming.\n\nAbout Trafalgar ReleasingTrafalgar Releasing, the global leader in event cinema distribution, harnesses the power of cinema to bring fans together in more than 15,000 cinemas across 132 countries.

In short order, the fourth album from Michael “Mike D” Diamond, Adam “Adrock” Horovitz and Adam “MCA” Yauch would become a multi-platinum juggernaut that pervaded every aspect of pop culture. Ill Communication‘s charge to global domination was led by “Sabotage” and its unforgettable Spike Jonze/Nathanial Hornblower-directed tribute to ’70s cop shows, as Rolling Stone dubbed the album 1994’s “soundtrack for summer.” Fans and critics alike were equally and instantly floored by hip hop highlights like the opening “Sure Shot,” the classic Jimmy Smith homage “Root Down” and the Q-Tip collaboration “Get It Together,” while a Vibe cover story hailed Beastie Boys as “perhaps the most consistently innovative musicians to emerge out of hip hop.” It was a claim that Ill Communication continues to back up, as the album’s infectious sprawl enthralls multiple generations of listeners. From household name hits to sublime instrumentals (“Sabrosa,” “Ricky’s Theme”) to hardcore punk workouts (“Tough Guy,” “Heart Attack Man”) and realms beyond (“Bodhisattva Vow,” “Shambala”), Ill Communication has never stopped growing in stature and impact.\n\nGrand Royal, Capitol Records and UMe are proud to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Ill Communication with today’s release of two limited edition versions of this Beastie Boys opus:\n\n* A 3LP Deluxe Edition that resurrects a rare version of the album originally released as a limited run in 2009. Long out-of-print and sought after by fans and collectors, the Ill Communication 30th anniversary vinyl edition features lenticular cover art and includes a third LP with 12 bonus tracks (featuring rarities including a live version of “The Maestro” from 1992’s Check Your Head, “Mullet Head,” and ten more remixes, B-sides and assorted oddities), all housed in a rigid slipcase and pressed on 180g vinyl.\n\n* A limited edition cassette of the original album, marking the first time in decades Ill Communication has been made available in the format.\n\nSo fire up the turntable and dust off that Walkman, and join in the celebration of 30 years of Ill Communication with Beastie Boys and the album’s supporting cast of Mario Caldato Jr. (who co-produced the record with the band), Money Mark, Eric Bobo, Amery “AWOL” Smith, Eugene Gore, Q-Tip and Biz Markie. Because you can’t, you won’t and you don’t stop…\n\nBEASTIE BOYS\n\nILL COMMUNICATION\n\n30th Anniversary Tracklists\n\n3LP Deluxe\n\nDisc 1\n\n• Sure Shot (Side A)\n\n• Tough Guy (Side A)\n\n• B-Boys Makin’ With The Freak Freak (Side A)\n\n• Bobo On The Corner (Side A)\n\n• Root Down (Side A)\n\n• Sabotage (Side B)\n\n• Get It Together (Side B)\n\n• Sabrosa (Side B)\n\n• The Update (Side B)\n\n• Futterman’s Rule (Side B)\n\nDisc 2\n\n• Alright Hear This (Side C)\n\n• Eugene’s Lament (Side C)\n\n• Flute Loop (Side C)\n\n• Do It (Side C)\n\n• Ricky’s Theme (Side C)\n\n• Heart Attack Man (Side D)\n\n• The Scoop (Side D)\n\n• Shambala (Side D)\n\n• Bodhisattva Vow (Side D)\n\n• Transitions (Side D)\n\nDisc 3\n\n• Root Down (Free Zone Mix) (Side E)\n\n• Resolution Time (Side E)\n\n• Get It Together (Buck-Wild Remix) (Side E)\n\n• Dope Little Song (Side E)\n\n• Sure Shot (European B-Boy Mix) (Side E)\n\n• Heart Attack Man (Unplugged) (Side E)\n\n• The Vibes (Side F)\n\n• Atwater Basketball Association File No. 172-C (Side F)\n\n• Heart Attack Man (Live) (Side F)\n\n• The Maestro (Live) (Side F)\n\n• Mullet Head (Side F)\n\n• Sure Shot (European B-Boy Instrumental) (Side F)\n\nCassette\n\n• Sure Shot (Side A)\n\n• Tough Guy (Side A)\n\n• B-Boys Makin’ With The Freak Freak (Side A)\n\n• Bobo On The Corner (Side A)\n\n• Root Down (Side A)\n\n• Sabotage (Side A)\n\n• Get It Together (Side A)\n\n• Sabrosa (Side A)\n\n• The Update (Side A)\n\n• Futterman’s Rule (Side A)\n\n• Alright Hear This (Side B)\n\n• Eugene’s Lament (Side B)\n\n• Flute Loop (Side B)\n\n• Do It (Side B)\n\n• Ricky’s Theme (Side B)\n\n• Heart Attack Man (Side B)\n\n• The Scoop (Side B)\n\n• Shambala (Side B)\n\n• Bodhisattva Vow (Side B)\n\n• Transitions (Side B)\n\nVAMPIRE WEEKEND\n\nLatest Episode of Vampire Campfire Podcast Out Now\n\nOnly God Was Above Us Tour Continues\n\nChicago Show To Feature Fun & Amusements\n\n“showcased how skilled a live band Vampire Weekend has become”– Los Angeles Times\n\n“Remarkable, really…”– Austin American Statesman\n\n“Vampire Weekend isn’t getting older, it’s getting better”– Variety\n\n“a nearly two-and-a-half-hour odyssey of pleasurable peculiarities that built and swerved and danced and blossomed, confounding assumptions at nearly every turn… [A] phenomenal run of songs goosed the venue with palpable energy”– Dallas Observer\n\n“showstopping…places them among the live greats, the artists that can maintain careers long after their best material is out in the world.
