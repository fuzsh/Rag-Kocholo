        "text": "By RUSSELL BAILLIE\n\nA quick word ... with Harry Enfield, the British funny man who has taken his teenage sketch comedy characters Kevin and Perry onto the big screen in Kevin and Perry Go Large, in which the slobby, spotty duo head off to the mecca of dance music, Ibiza, to become superstar DJs and to try their best to lose their virginity.\n\nWhat made you say \"we should make a movie of these two\"?\n\nIt was the American tradition of all the kind of Wayne's Worlds and Bill and Teds. When we do them on telly they are very much about me and my parents. I thought it would be nice to break out of that and do a rites-of-passage gross-out-Wayne's World type film. The whole dance and Ibiza thing's huge and I didn't really want to make a film in England because it's so rainy and horrible.\n\nThe dance scene - are you a fan?\n\nOh yeah. I've really got into it and I've been to Ibiza 13 years running so I'm big on the scene really.\n\nWhat was it like filming there?\n\nIt was a kind of skin-of-our-teeth business. Like we're in a club, it's 3 am, we've been allowed an hour and a half. The whole crowd have paid to get in, they're on one and I turn the decks off and go \"right, you lot boo, cheer do all this\" - are they going to kill me or are they going to do what they are told? And they did what they were told. But if they hadn't we wouldn't have had a movie, I think.\n\nIt's a big island and we took care to film where I knew we could rather than in the concentrated English bits - the bits with all the lager louts where we wouldn't have got anything done.\n\nSo the drugs make extras more compliant?\n\nYeah. It might well do.\n\nKevin and Perry do everything but drugs while they're in Ibiza. Why's that?\n\nWell, we briefly touch on it in a negative way. The only people who do drugs then vomit on us. We did have a scene where they took drugs in an earlier draft and they took them and got totally out of their heads and loved each other, but we kind of agonised about it.\n\nAbout three or four people die a year and I couldn't be bothered to get into all that.\n\nI've never taken the stuff in my life but that's because the people my age who take it I think are a bit tragic.\n\nBut as far as I am concerned people on ecstasy are absolutely lovely and I'm sure there's far less people killed in car accidents or knifed to death because of alcohol.\n\nBut a couple of people die a year and everyone goes on about it.\n\nDo teenagers laugh at the movie or do they think,, There's Harry Enfield having a go at us'?\n\nNo, they are the core audience. I think probably every teenager in England went to see it.\n\nYou say Kevin and Perry is based on your relationship with your parents, care to expand on that?\n\nI was kind of 14 and had an encyclopaedic knowledge of punk music and thought I was a total genius and I was forced with live with these ludicrous people who knew nothing about punk and were only interested in things like gardening or did idiotic things like try to talk to me as they took me from one party to another because I couldn't drive yet.\n\nThey were just ghastly dreadful embarrassing old things.\n\nYou've got beyond that since?\n\nYeah. I can tolerate them now.\n\n* Kevin and Perry Go Large is at cinemas now."
