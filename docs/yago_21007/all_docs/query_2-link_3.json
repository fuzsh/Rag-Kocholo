        "text": "Welsh comedian, presenter, actor (born 1958)\n\nFor the British police officer, see Paul Whitehouse (police officer).\n\nPaul Julian Whitehouse[1] (born 20 May 1958) is a Welsh actor, writer, presenter and comedian. He was one of the main stars of the BBC sketch comedy series The Fast Show, and has starred with Harry Enfield in the shows Harry & Paul and Harry Enfield & Chums. He has appeared with Bob Mortimer in the BBC series Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing, and has also acted in films including Corpse Bride (2005), Alice in Wonderland (2010), and The Death of Stalin (2017).\n\nIn a 2005 poll to find The Comedian's Comedian, he was in the top 50 comedy acts voted for by comedians and comedy insiders.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nWhitehouse was born on 20 May 1958, in Stanleytown, Glamorgan, Wales.[2] His father, Harry, worked for the National Coal Board and his mother, Anita (née Jones), was a singer with the Welsh National Opera.[3][a] The family moved to Enfield, Middlesex, when he was four years old,[5] which led to his discovering his talent for mimicry:\n\nAt school I didn't say a word for the first four weeks – I called it my Silent Month. I think it was because everyone was speaking so differently from how it had been in Wales. Then, after four weeks, I came home one day and said, 'Muumm, I wanna go to Sarfend!' For her that was the end because I had lost my lovely Welsh lilt. So I became very conscious of speech and the effects it can have. But when I went back to Wales I would start talking all Welsh, 'like that, you see' before going all Alf Garnett while coming back the other way.[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nWhitehouse attended the University of East Anglia reading for a degree in Development Studies from autumn 1976, where he became friends with Charlie Higson.[6] The pair spent little of their first year studying, instead playing guitar and performing with their punk rock combo, the Right Hand Lovers.[7] Whitehouse dropped out and squatted in a council flat in Hackney, east London and occasionally worked as a plasterer.[8] After Higson graduated in 1980, he moved in with Whitehouse, working by day as a decorator and performing at night and the weekends with his new punk-funk group The Higsons.[9]\n\nThe pair began working as tradesmen on a house shared by comedians Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, which inspired them to start writing comedy. They moved to an estate where in a pub they met Harry Enfield, a neighbour with a stage act,[9] and after he gained a place on Channel 4's Saturday Live, the pair were invited to write for him.[6] Whitehouse created Enfield's character Stavros (a London-based Greek kebab shop owner), and then Loadsamoney (an archetypal Essex boy made good in Margaret Thatcher's 1980s); he also appeared as Enfield's sidekick Lance on Saturday Live. This success turned Whitehouse and Higson's career, and they began to appear on Vic Reeves Big Night Out and extensively for the BBC, with Whitehouse appearing on A Bit of Fry and Laurie as a man with a clinical need to have his bottom fondled, and Paul Merton: The Series, then on Harry Enfield's Television Programme, where he developed numerous characters including DJ Mike Smash of Smashie and Nicey, alongside Enfield as Dave Nice.\n\nTV career\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile watching a preview tape of highlights from Enfield's programme, Whitehouse and Higson were inspired to create a rapid-fire delivery comedy series which would evolve into The Fast Show (when shown in the United States on BBC America, the show was titled Brilliant). Whitehouse's characters included Rowley Birkin QC, Unlucky Alf, Arthur Atkinson, Ron Manager and Ted.\n\nAn online series of The Fast Show commissioned by Fosters led to six weekly episodes launched on 10 November 2011.[10]\n\nIn 2001 and 2002, Whitehouse and Fast Show collaborator Dave Cummings co-wrote two series of the BBC comedy drama Happiness; Whitehouse also performed the lead role as a voice-over actor with a mid-life crisis.[11]\n\nWhitehouse wrote, produced and appeared with Chris Langham in the 2005 comedy drama Help, also for the BBC. In this series he took 25 roles, all patients of Langham's psychotherapist (except one, who is Langham's psychotherapist's psychotherapist). The pair's collaboration resulted in Whitehouse taking the witness stand on 24 July 2007 in the trial of Langham, in regard to the charge of holding explicit images and videos of minors. Langham claimed he downloaded this material as research for a character in the second series of Help, but Whitehouse's testimony only partially corroborated this explanation.[12]\n\nHe appeared in the BBC sketch series Harry & Paul (formerly Ruddy Hell! It's Harry and Paul), starring alongside Harry Enfield.[13] Whitehouse starred alongside Charlie Higson in the BBC2 comedy series Bellamy's People, with the first episode broadcast on 21 January 2010. The comedy evolved from the BBC Radio 4 program Down the Line.[14] The show originally had the working title of Bellamy's Kingdom.\n\nIn October 2014, Harry Enfield and Whitehouse revived the classic characters Frank and George (\"The Self-Righteous Brothers\") from Harry Enfield and Chums, in a sketch for Channel 4's testicular cancer awareness comedy series The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night.[15]\n\nIn 2015 his sitcom Nurse, based on his Radio 4 series of the same name (see below), debuted on BBC2 on 10 March.[16]\n\nIn August 2015, Whitehouse, alongside Enfield, in celebration of their 25-year partnership, presented An Evening With Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse.[17]\n\nIn June and July 2018, Whitehouse appeared with his long-time friend and fellow comedian Bob Mortimer in a BBC2 six-part series, Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing. The two friends, who both suffer from heart conditions, share their thoughts and experiences while fishing at a variety of locations around the UK, often with anecdotes about Paul's health and Bob's misadventures. The fourth series of Gone Fishing began broadcasting in 2021.[18] The fifth series began in September 2022, and returned for a Christmas special in December 2022.[19] The duo returned for a sixth series broadcast on BBC.\n\nRadio\n\n[edit]\n\nWhitehouse and Charlie Higson produced and appeared in a spoof phone-in show Down the Line on BBC Radio 4. The first series was broadcast May–June 2006. A second series was broadcast 16 January – 20 February 2007, during which they won a Sony Radio Academy Award.[20] A third series was broadcast in January 2008, a fourth in January 2011 and a fifth in May 2013. In February 2014, Radio 4 broadcast Nurse, written by Whitehouse and David Cummings and starring Esther Coles in the title role, with Whitehouse playing a variety of characters, including Graham Downs who had previously appeared in Down the Line. The show would become the basis for the 2015 BBC Two TV series Nurse.[21]\n\nTheatre\n\n[edit]\n\nWhitehouse and John Sullivan's son, Jim Sullivan, have written Only Fools and Horses The Musical, which launched on 9 February 2019 at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London.[22] Whitehouse stars as Grandad. In October 2022 he temporarily handed the part over to Les Dennis.[23]\n\nOther work\n\n[edit]\n\nHe also starred alongside Eddie Large and Russ Abbot in episode 4 of Horne & Corden. Comic Relief 2011 contained a new parody video of \"Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind)\" directed by MJ Delaney featuring Whitehouse and other Welsh celebrities lip-syncing to the song.[24] It is available to download via iTunes.\n\nJohnny Depp described Whitehouse as \"the greatest actor of all time\".[25] Depp appeared in the 2000 finale of The Fast Show, and he and Whitehouse have appeared in five films together: Finding Neverland, Corpse Bride, Alice in Wonderland and its sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass, and Mortdecai. The latter has been noted for alluding to Fast Show characters.[26][27]\n\nInfluences\n\n[edit]\n\nWhitehouse's main early influences were the sketches of Les Dennis and Dustin Gee and The Goodies. In 2001, when asked about comedians who had influenced him, Whitehouse said that Monty Python, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore were the main influences from when he was young. He also cited his modern influences as Harry Enfield, of whom he said without meeting he would not have been doing what he does now, and the approach of Reeves and Mortimer who he described as \"far and away the best comedians that we have had in this country for a long while.\"[28]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nWhitehouse married Fiona Wightman in 1992, and the couple had two daughters, Molly and Sophie, before separating in 2000.[11] The couple divorced three years later. Whitehouse supported his ex-wife in a civil action she has pursued against a national newspaper, for accessing her medical records. The publisher later offered unreserved apologies.[29]\n\nHe had a third daughter, Lauren, with costume designer Natalie Rogers.[29]\n\nWhitehouse met Dr Mine Conkbayir, who is of Turkish heritage, when she was aged 23 and 22 years his junior. She was working in a health food shop while studying. The couple have one daughter, Delilah. As of 2024 they have been together 20 years and married for five, but maintain separate homes.[30][31][32][33]\n\nWhitehouse is a fan of Premier League football side Tottenham Hotspur.[5]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 2000 Kevin & Perry Go Large Bouncer 2004 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sir Cadogan Deleted scenes Finding Neverland Stage Manager 2005 Corpse Bride William Van Dort, Mayhew, Paul the Head Waiter Voice only 2009 Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva Otis English version 2010 Alice in Wonderland Thackery Earwicket the March Hare Voice only Burke & Hare Drunk Gentleman 2015 Mortdecai Spinoza 2016 Alice Through the Looking Glass Thackery Earwicket the March Hare Voice only 2017 The Death of Stalin Anastas Mikoyan Ghost Stories Tony Matthews 2018 Chuck Steel: Night of the Trampires Barney, Gussman Voice only King of Thieves Carl Wood 2019 The Personal History of David Copperfield Mr. Peggotty\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Television Role Notes 1990 A Bit of Fry and Laurie Man at the Bottom Fondled in Audience Episode: \"Episode #2.3\" Vic Reeves Big Night Out David Rowells\n\nJean-Paul Gaultier\n\nMr. Popkins Episodes: \"Episode #1.1\"\n\n\"Episode #1.5\"\n\n\"Episode #1.6\" 1990–1992 Harry Enfield's Television Programme Fred Git\n\nLance\n\nMike \"Smashie\" Smash\n\nVincent Also screenwriter 1991 Comic Relief Mike \"Smashie\" Smash TV film Paul Merton: The Series Carver Episode: \"Episode #1.6\" 1992 Bunch of Five Spencer Pendel Episode: \"The Weekenders\" 1993–1995 The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer Jimmy Lea from Slade\n\nHeinrich Himmler 1994 Smashie and Nicey, the End of an Era Mike \"Smashie\" Smash TV film 1994–1997 Harry Enfield & Chums Mister Dead\n\nGeorge Doberman\n\nJulio Geordio\n\nFred Git\n\nLance\n\nMichael Paine Also screenwriter 1994–2000 The Fast Show \"Unlucky\" Alf\n\nArchie\n\nArthur Atkinson\n\nBrilliant Kid\n\nPoutremos Poutra-Poutremos\n\nChris the Crafty Cockney\n\nThe 13th Duke of Wymbourne\n\nLindsey\n\nRon Manager\n\nRowley Birkin QC\n\nTed\n\nVarious roles Also co-creator and screenwriter 1998 Ted & Ralph Ted\n\nRowley Birkin\n\nKevin Brown TV film 1999 You Ain't Seen All These, Right?
