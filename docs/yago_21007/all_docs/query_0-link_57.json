        "text": "Tony\n\nTony (Nicholas Hoult) is a smart kid. He undermines his dad (Harry Enfield) on a daily basis and effortlessly covers up for his little sisterâs (Kaya Scodelario) covert delinquency. So smart he believes he can even get his best mate Sid (Mike Bailey) laid, and make a profit. And Abigailâs (Georgina Moffat) party seems like the perfect place to do both. Inevitably the dope deal goes wrong, and so does Sidâs quest to lose his virginity, no surprise there. But when the stolen car goes into the river and takes the unpaid for drugs with it, Tony and his mates are really in the s**t.\n\nTony and Maxxie\n\nTony is recovering from the massive head injury he sustained at the end of series one. Sid and Michelle are nowhere to be seen, caring for an invalid friend has just been too much for them. So Maxxie is looking after Tony for the day. But Maxxie has his own problems. He desperately wants to leave college and follow his dream to become a dancer, but his Dad Walter (Bill Bailey) is giving him hell about it. Tony wants to go back to college, but his parents (Harry Enfield, Morwenna Banks) wonât agree to that either. Their world has been rocked to its foundations and they just donât know what to do with their son. So Maxxie wants out and Tony wants in and theyâre going to have to help each other. Thatâs if the gay hating, ASBO boys on Maxxieâs estate donât get them first. And all the while Maxxie has a strange feeling that someone else nearby is on his case too ...\n\nChris\n\nChrisâ college career has been a long road full of tribulations; drugs, petty theft, non attendance and resounding failure. So when the CCTV cameras catch him shagging Buck Tooth in the Science corridor, the College Director calls time. Chris is out. And out of his college accommodation as well. Homeless, family-less, Chris is going down hill fast, until Jal steps in with a challenge. Sheâll try to unwind a little so long as he gets his act together and gets some focus. So Chris gets a job, several jobs, in fact every time heâs fired he gets another one, and he moves into the smallest bed-sit in Bristol. So Jalâs got to chill out, and wow when she does sheâs pretty gorgeous, and talented, and cool, and... Could Chris have had his eyes opened wider than any drug could do?\n\nEveryone\n\nItâs the first day of the new term at Roundview College and time to meet a brand new set of sixteen year olds. Best friends Freddie, JJ and Cookâs world collides with Effyâs when Cook pulls off a practical joke at the expense of Jim Stonem. Cook finds a reason to turn up at College â heâs pursuing Effy. Freddie and JJ are equally smitten. Identical twin sisters Katie and Emily prepare for the start of their new 6th form life. Typically, Katie walks over Emily â stealing her outfit and using all the hot water. Katieâs footballer boyfriend Danny drives them to College, giving Katie the entrance sheâs looking for. The Hair and Beauty Girls look on enviously. Effy and Katie clock one another immediately; they are the two most desirable girls there and they both know it."
