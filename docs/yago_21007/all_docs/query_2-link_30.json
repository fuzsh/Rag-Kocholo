        "text": "Spaced series two. What a treat.\n\nFirst, a confession. I was just a bit too old for Spaced. By the time it came out, I was married, with a brand new baby, so the life of twentysomethings sharing a flat and partying felt like a different generation.\n\nGood thing it had all those nerd jokes, then.\n\nSeries two starts with a homage to Woody Allen’s Manhattan which serves to reintroduce the characters in a typically Edgar Wright fast-cutting way.\n\nIt’s been eighteen months, and Tim is still working through his problems with George Lucas and The Phantom Menace.\n\nMike’s been living in Daisy’s room while she’s been away.\n\n“Did you take lots of photos?” “No need for photos. Welcome to the twenty-first century.”\n\nOn her holiday, she met a young man, played by John Simm, who was bringing back ‘sensitive material’.\n\nHe was picked up by two agents, Kevin Eldon\n\nAnd Mark Gatiss, both playing Agent Smith of the Matrix.\n\nEpisode Two, Change, starts with the cast asleep, with the music from Bagpuss playing. Here’s a confession. My youngest daughter is called Emily, and it’s mostly because of Bagpuss.\n\nTim gets fired from his job at the comic shop for yelling at a child wanting to buy a Jar Jar toy. His boss Bilbo sympathises – “I once punched a bloke in the face for saying Hawk the Slayer is rubbish” – but he has to let him go.\n\nKaty Carmichael appears as Twist. Now, I might be wrong about this, but I’m fairly sure I used to know her when she worked in Ed’s Diner in Soho in the early 90s. She was there for a while, and we used to chat, and when she left, I started seeing her (or someone who looked a lot like her) in adverts, and then here in Spaced. Now, I have no real way of knowing it she was the same person I knew, but I like to think she is, and I was happy to see her getting roles.\n\nTim gets a new job at another comic shop. But old boss Bilbo asks him to come back to his shop, so he gets sacked. “Babylon Five’s a big pile of shit!”\n\nThere’s a very brief appearance from Robert Popper, creator of Look Around You and Friday Night Dinner as a bookshop customer.\n\nThe next episode is Mettle. It has a great Robocop opening.\n\nI like the in-jokes in the display, including the catchphrase ‘Fried Gold’.\n\nReece Shearsmith plays a rival in Robot Wars. I met him once, at the premiere of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy movie. We had a nice chat about the League of Gentlemen movie they’d just completed.\n\nDaisy gets a job in a restaurant kitchen, which turns into One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, complete with Joanna Scanlan as their Nurse Ratched.\n\nTalking of Hitchhiker’s, Tim and Mike’s robot has the sound of the guide.\n\nThey compete in Robot Club, and underground version of Robot Wars.\n\nI’ve missed the start of the next episode on this recording. Just a few seconds, though. Clive Russell plays the comics publisher who traumatised Tim last year when he submitted his portfolio. He wants to give him a second chance.\n\nThe great Michael Smiley appears as the bike courier Tyres.\n\nOlivia Williams plays an angry cyclist, in a Sixth Sense homage.\n\nRowena Cooper plays Brian’s mum.\n\nAnother Matrix homage.\n\nAnd a Grange Hill homage.\n\nWe’re missing the next episode – which I looked at quite a while ago, so the next episode here is episode six, Dissolution. Brian is processing some pictures, and in an Omen-like scene, sees lines dividing all the characters.\n\nTim and Sophie (Lucy Akhurst) are a couple, and they’re worried about Marsha getting suspicious, because they originally rented the flat on the basis that Tim and Daisy were a professional couple.\n\nMike is upset that Tim forgot his promotion.\n\nIt all comes to a head at a meal, and Daisy has to admit to Marsha that she and Tim are not really a couple.\n\nIn a flashback, Ricky Gervais plays a call centre worker.\n\nThe cake Tim got for Daisy is lovely.\n\nAnd it’s very decent of George Lucas to let them use the end title music from Empire Strikes Back.\n\nThe Final episode, Leaves, starts with a pastiche of the Royle Family titles.\n\nMarsha has put the house up for sale. Daisy is offered a job in Colwyn Bay. Sophie is moving to Seattle to work for Marvel. So Tim, Mike and Brian have to make one last pointless gesture to get Marsha to change her mind.\n\nBut when they get back to the flat, they find Daisy has left for St Pancras. So Tim has to ride their robot to stop her.\n\nI know people have always wished for a third series of Spaced, but I think this was a lovely ending.\n\nAfter the last episode, and a few adverts, recording stops, and underneath there’s an episode of So Graham Norton.\n\nHe has his regular audience member, Betty, but with a daytime TV twist.\n\nHis first guest is chat show host Ricki Lake.\n\nHis second guest is Boyzone’s Stephen Gateley.\n\nAfter part 2, this recording finishes, and underneath, there’s Aiya Napa – Return to Fantasy Island. Not my cup of tea, as I’m not one for discotheques. Still, the last shot of the programme is of a woman pulling her top up to show her breasts, so at least all my prejudices remain intact.\n\nAfter this, late night on Channel 4 goes even more downmarket with the start of a programme called Digital Sex. I didn’t watch it, but scrolling through it it looks like a downmarket Eurotrash. Yes, such a thing is possible. The tape ends during this programme.\n\nOn the adverts, one thing caught my eye. When movies are playing in cinemas, I always note it with ‘Movie Name in cinemas’. That’s how I’ve always thought of it. But almost all the ads say ‘at cinemas’. I gnore this because I’m contrary and right, but on this tape thre was one ad which used ‘in cinemas’ so I thought I’d give it a special mention. Don’t remember the movie at all, though. iMDb tells me it starred David Boreanaz and Denise Richards.\n\nAdverts:\n\ntrail: Monty Python’s Life of Brian\n\nFord Ka\n\nLloyd’s Bank\n\nLevi’s Engineered Jeans\n\nLove Honour & Obey on video\n\nThe Observer\n\nLloyd’s Bank\n\nDaily Telegraph\n\nLevi’s Engineered Jeans\n\nBrit Awards 2001\n\nNissan\n\nJaffa Cakes\n\nMSN\n\nChatback\n\nJordans Country Crisp\n\nIntel Pentium 4\n\nStandard Life\n\nNissan Almera\n\nFirst Direct\n\nDTI\n\nRenault Clio\n\nNational Lottery\n\nRed Bull\n\nIn Style\n\nMen of Honour in cinemas\n\nThe Marketplace\n\nXFM\n\nVW Polo\n\nEuphoria\n\nGorillaz\n\nLynx 3 Blade Shave\n\nVauxhall Zafira\n\nValentine in cinemas\n\nThe Annual Spring 2001\n\nSpecsavers\n\nSpecial K\n\nMFI\n\nMorgan Stanley Dean Witter\n\nBudweiser\n\nVauxhall Zafira\n\nBudweiser\n\nBritish Midland\n\nNeil Finn – One Nil\n\nO Brother Where Art Thou? on DVD\n\nEuphoria\n\ntrail: Top 10 Pop Princesses\n\ntrail: My Best Friend’s Wedding\n\nVW Polo\n\nCheltenham & Gloucester\n\nXFM\n\nMen of Honour in cinemas\n\nReebok\n\nNational Lottery\n\nSainsbury’s\n\nThe Chillout Session\n\nNew Deal for Lone Parents\n\nThe Independent\n\ntrail: Trigger Happy TV\n\ntrail: Teachers\n\nBacardi Breezer\n\nToyota\n\nBridget Jones’ Diary in cinemas\n\nThe Sun\n\nImodium Plus\n\nNational Lottery\n\nSma\n\nSynergie\n\ntrail: Top Ten X-Rated\n\nMTV Select\n\nComet\n\nAndrex\n\nMorgan Stanley Dean Witter\n\nThe Very Best Euphoric Chillout Mixes Breakdown\n\nTwix\n\nJordans Country Crisp\n\nKFC\n\nMastercard\n\ntrail: Teachers\n\nLloyd’s Bank\n\nAyia Napa Return to Fantasy Island\n\ntrail: Can You Live Without Sex?\n\ntrail: ER\n\nHollow Man on DVD\n\nThe Definitive Monkees\n\nTwix\n\nPringles\n\nFirst on this tape is Crossing Delancey, a romantic comedy starring Amy Irving. She plays Izzy, a woman working at a New York bookshop they have just saved from closing down.\n\nJeroen Krabbe is a writer who clearly likes her.\n\nShe’s not looking for a man, but her grandmother wants to set her up with a nice man she knows, who sells pickles. He’s played by Peter Riegert.\n\nShe also has an ex who occasionally turns up for company, played by John Bedford Lloyd – who I recognised as Jammer from The Abyss.\n\nIt’s nice to see Kathleen Wilhoite play something other than a drug addict. Here she’s Krabbe’s former assistant.\n\nAlso in the cast, David Hyde Pierce, who also works in the bookshop.\n\nThis is a really sweet comedy, quiet, understated, with small-scale relationship drama, and nicely drawn characters. Perhaps there’s no belly laughs here, but Irving is charming, as is Reigert, just as appealing as he was in Local Hero as the man with the pickle shop who’s not quite sophisticated enough for Irving’s literary life.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 20th December 1992 – 21:00\n\nThere’s a trailer for The Fabulous Baker Boys.\n\nThen, an episode of Funny Business. I had thought this was the awful Howard Jacobson programme about comedy, but this is different, a BBC series about comedy. This episode is A Question of Taste and opens with a lovely shot of Television Centre.\n\nI like this series. It tries something different with the documentary form, in this case almost a prototype of W1A. “This particular film, which was my idea, I got from an interview I read with John Cleese in one of the colour supplements.”\n\nI like the classic BBC calendar behind her – every week is numbered, because weekly scheduling is such an ingrained part of work at the BBC.\n\nThe first performer featured is Andrew Dice Clay, someone who never made it in the UK, and who I’ve only really seen in programmes like this, so I’ve probably only seen his most hateful. I think I watched his movie, The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, but I don’t remember much about it. His stand-up just sounds, to me, like a Five Minute Hate with a sequinned jacket.\n\nAnother of the faux documentary makers is Nigel Partridge. “I think it’s fascinating how some of the funniest jokes are ones that you don’t laugh at at all.”\n\nIt’s slightly strange that we have actual interviews being done by the fictional characters. They talk to Roy Chubby Brown.\n\nThey talk to Stephanie Hodge.\n\nThere’s a lovely scene where the team read out a list of rude words to a group of senior citizens, and they’re all like the old ladies from Harry Enfield. “Nigel, are they your sex drops? Nigel, are you married?”\n\nThey talk to Bill Hicks. I still get sad that he died.\n\nThe team have a problem getting John Cleese’s participation.\n\nIt’s not a bad documentary, and someone has uploaded it.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 20th December 1992 – 22:35\n\nThe final episode in the series is next, after a nice Christmas BBC2 logo.\n\nThe final episode is The Fool’s Guide To Movie Comedy starting with Leslie Nielsen.\n\nComedy God Carl Reiner.\n\nThe writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel.\n\nAirplane’s David Zucker\n\nDamon Wayans, off of The Last Boy Scout\n\nWayne’s World director Penelope Spheeris\n\nThe legendary Gene Wilder\n\nBuck Henry, writer of The Graduate\n\nDirector of Big, Penny Marshall\n\nMy uncle, Jonathan Lynn. (Only kidding, I don’t think he’s related to me.)\n\nActor Mike Myers\n\nAnother actor, Charles Grodin.\n\nThis is a really good documentary, better than the previous one because it concentrates on talking to people.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 27th December 1992 – 21:05\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for The Fabulous Baker Boys.\n\nThen, an extended preview of new drama. The dramas featured are The Mushroom Picker, Mr Wroe’s Virgins, Edward II, Dead Romantic, The Long Roads and The Clothes in the Wardrobe.\n\nThis tape starts with the end of an episode of Brookside.\n\nThen Cybill. Zoe brings her boyfriend to stay, and he’s the stupidest boy imaginable.\n\nMaryann has gone to Vegas and is almost going to get married.\n\nAnd we find that the dumb boyfriend was just a decoy, and she’s actually seeing his much smarter older brother.\n\nAfter this, an episode of Father Ted. Dougal has some spine chilling reading material.\n\nFather Jack has a mishap lighting his cigarette.\n\nThat would be an ecumenical matter.\n\nNext, an episode of Roseanne. Roseanne and Jackie are working at the supermarket. Stan Freberg again guests, as the supermarket manager.\n\nThere’s a very brief appearance of Kathryn Joosten, Mrs Landingham off of The West Wing, as a customer.\n\nThere’s an interesting scene with Dan and David, where David is worried about DJ blowing off his homework drawing a cat to go to the movies with Mark, and he says maybe DJ shouldn’t hang around so much with Mark since he’s dumb, and Dan gets angry with him. Dan stands up for the dumb guy who nevertheless works as hard as he can to support his family. He clearly sees Mark as a younger him. While all David does is work part time at a pizza parlour and sit on the sofa making snarky jokes, despite being much smarter than his brother.\n\nStill, it was probably the wake-up call he needed to move out, change his name, study physics to a phd level and move to California.\n\nAfter this, an episode of The Mark Thomas Comedy Product. His film crew spend a day following around the man who was making millions from a video of things caught on CCTV cameras, who didn’t like it at all.\n\nHe also attends a meeting of the far-right Conservative group the Monday Club, and asks questions about whether young offenders should be publicly lashed on the National Lottery programme.\n\nAfter this, recording continues briefly with the start of The Girlie Show, then switches to TFI Friday. There’s music from Cast.\n\nA very short chat with Burt Bacharach.\n\nThere’s the first showing of a Reebok ad featuring a lot of celebs, themed around football, and he talks to Anna Friel, the only woman int he ad. Not that the interview discusses gender imbalance, as he’s more interested in her weight. At the start he actually points at her stomach and says “how are you going to get a baby in there?” It’s so relentlessly “Loaded” magazine.\n\nThere’s a slightly better bit when he asks her about crying on screen, as she’s said she thinks about her father being hurt, so they’ve got a camera crew at her house where her dad enacts some scenes of him hurting himself. This is the kind of stuff I prefer from Evans, not the banal tabloid gossip stuff.\n\nAfter more music from cast, Ronald Fraser appears as “The Lord of Love”, this time without a hat on fire.\n\nGabrielle performs Bacharach’s classic Walk On By.\n\nThere’s another segment of At Home with Chris and Cher. They do the washing up, and wash some of their awards. Cher’s oscar and Chris’s Smash Hits award.\n\nThere’s an interview via satellite with Amanda Donohoe, talking about the Oscars.\n\nNext, Shaun Ryder does Stars in their Eyes.\n\nHe and his band, Black Grape, do the Sex Pistols, Pretty Vacant.\n\nNow, during the song, he swears an awful lot. And the live edition of show goes out at 6pm, way before the watershed, so after the performance Chris Evans has to apologise a lot for the swearing. But here’s the thing. They do the whole Stars in their Eyes thing like the old show used to. They interview him before, as himself, then he goes through the door filled with light and has the blond hair and dark glasses to do the performance. So either the initial interview or the performance was pre-recorded. And if the performance was pre-recorded, presumably they could have muted the swear words for the pre-watershed show. I’d be interested to know the details for this.\n\nFrom the way the apology goes, I think the intro must have been the pre-record and the song was going out live.\n\nNext guest is Richard Wilson. He does some science experiments.\n\nHe also fires a Pringles cannon at the audience.\n\nThen the show closes with another song from Cast.\n\nAfter this, recording continues with an episode of Beavis and Butthead. The best line in this is when they watch Sheena Easton. “She looks like some chick you might see hanging out in K-Mart.” I wonder if this joke was written knowing how Sheena Easton became famous in the first place (she was on a documentary series where ‘members of the public’ are given the chance to do things like present a TV show or, in her case, record a pop song, and this launched her entire career).\n\nThen the tape ends during the start of another Derek Jarman movie, Jubilee.\n\nAdverts:\n\ntrail: And The Beat Goes On\n\ntrail: Gulliver’s Travels\n\nVW Golf\n\nDaily Express\n\nAnchor Butter\n\nUPS\n\nAlton Towers\n\ntrail: Tonight on 4\n\nNational Lottery\n\nMcDonalds\n\nAA\n\nJohnson’s Baby Bath\n\nParis\n\nRevlon Colorstay\n\ntrail: Raising Arizona\n\nMurphy’s\n\nRenault Megane – Tony Gardner\n\ntrail: The Big Breakfast\n\ntrail: Rocket to the Moon\n\nHonda\n\nCasper on video\n\nNicotinell\n\nMcDonalds\n\nDaily Express\n\nYakult\n\nMurphy’s\n\ntrail: Big Mouth\n\ntrail: Gulliver’s Travels\n\nThe Independent\n\nHyundai\n\nMatchmakers\n\nJohnson’s pH 5.5\n\nPlenitude\n\ntrail: And The Beat Goes On\n\nFiat Punto\n\nWeetabix\n\nGary Numan Tubeway Army\n\nClairol Ultress\n\nCarling No 1\n\ntrail: Raising Arizona\n\ntrail: Gulliver’s Travels\n\nDomestos\n\nComfort\n\nSurf\n\nLil-lets\n\nNational Lottery\n\nRover\n\ntrail: Cutting Edge: Special Force\n\ntrail: Tribal Cops\n\nNissan Almera\n\nCreme Eggs\n\nThe Times\n\nPantene\n\nBacardi\n\nEmirates\n\nThe Beatles Anthology 2\n\ntrail: Big Mouth\n\ntrail: Gulliver’s Travels\n\nMurphy’s\n\nThe Equitable Life\n\nWrigley’s Doublemint Gum\n\nRoysters\n\nVW Golf\n\nTrainspotting in cinemas\n\nSpecsavers\n\nMurphy’s\n\ntrail: Raising Arizona\n\nPizza Hut – Murray Walker and Damon Hill\n\nNow 33\n\ntrail: Gulliver’s Travels\n\ntrail: Big Mouth\n\nAlton Towers\n\nWash & Go\n\nTrainspotting in cinemas\n\nHyundai\n\nThe Times\n\nThe Best Rap Album in the World Ever\n\nMountain Dew\n\nNow 33\n\nVauxhall Vectra\n\nHead & Shoulders\n\nStella Artois\n\nDance Wars\n\nSpecial Constabulary\n\nKiss FM\n\ntrail: Raising Arizona\n\nNike\n\nCoca Cola\n\nKronenbourg 1664\n\nThe Times\n\nNational Lottery\n\nChatback\n\nTerry’s Chocolate Orange Siesta\n\nBacardi\n\nRoysters\n\nMcDonalds\n\ntrail: Rocket to the Moon\n\nVauxhall Corsa – Ruby Wax\n\nAlton Towers\n\nCarling No 1\n\nMountain Dew\n\nCadbury’s Dairy Milk – Dexter Fletcher\n\ntrail: NBA Raw\n\nFT\n\nPolaroid\n\nPolo Spearmint\n\nWrangler\n\nRoysters\n\nRenault Megane – Tony Gardner\n\nSpecial Constabulary\n\ntrail: Raising Arizona\n\nThis tape starts with yet another odd coincidence – the end of an episode of The X-Files on BBC1 and it’s an episode we saw on a different tape just two days ago, Syzygy, the one about the satanic cult/astrologically induced madness.\n\nThere’s a trailer for Ruby Wax Meets the Duchess of York.\n\nThen, Harry Enfield and Chums.

And for Crimewatch UK.\n\nThen, an episode of Inside Story. Megan’s Law looks at the laws in America that let local communities know when a sex offender is released into their community.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 4th February 1997 – 22:00\n\nAfter this there’s a trailer for Diary of a Princess and for A Question of Sport.\n\nThen, there’s the start of Sportsnight, with some football. The tape ends during this programme.\n\nFirst on this tape, The X-Files and an episode called Nisei. It opens with an alien autopsy being performed by a group of Japanese doctors in a train car, that’s then invaded by armed men.\n\nMulder gets a videotape of the autopsy from a mail order advert, and when he goes to investigate the source, they find a dead man. More investigations leads Scully to a group of people who recognise her – they’ve all had an abduction experience in the last year.\n\nThe Lone Gunmen are consulted over the tape.\n\nScully recognises a Japanese doctor in a photo, but Mulder says he’s been dead since 1965. Scully has a flashback to her abduction, and remembers seeing the doctor’s face. She then recognises his face as one of the doctors in the alien autopsy video.\n\nWe see him, still alive, boarding a train to Canada that Mulder is following.\n\nMulder wants to get on the train, but Mr X, his secret informant, tells Scully he’ll be in great danger if he does. Naturally, Mulder ignores her warning, and does the whole jumping on the roof of a train thing. TO BE CONTINUED.\n\nThe next episode starts with a lot of army types storming some kind of dormitory which appears to be populated by alien-looking people. They are put into trucks, driven into the country, then unloaded and shot. All this while being watched by a much older alien-looking person.\n\nScully is told by Mr X that if she wants to know about her abduction, and who killed her sister, she’d have to find out about the implant she had put in her neck. She finds a link to a Japanese company – and the same doctor that Mulder is looking for on the train. Which leads her back to the dormitory from the opening, where she finds the few remaining people – leprosy sufferers. The place is supposed to be a research facility.\n\nBut the other people, the ones killed by the soldiers, were brought in much later. They weren’t suffering from leprosy, but they had deformed heads.\n\nMulder finds the Japanese doctor on the train, strangled, and finds another of the alien-looking men locked in a secure train car.\n\nHe’s attacked by the man who killed the doctor. He says he works for the NSA.\n\nScully is found by soldiers, and yet another shady man explains everything to her. The Japanese doctor had been conducting experiments on the lepers, on homeless people, the end result of which was people who look like aliens. Scully remembers that the train car in the autopsy video was where she was taken when she was abducted.\n\nTime almost runs out when Mulder is rescued from the train car by the mysterious Mr X just before the bomb goes off.\n\nSo once again, nothing is resolved. Is it aliens? Is it government scientists conducting shady experiments. Are they just making it up as they go along? All of the above?\n\nWe skip a couple of episodes now, and come to Syzygy. There’s a famous face in the opening, a young Ryan Reynolds as a student, giving a eulogy for a fellow student. They believe there’s a satanic cult murdering children.\n\nTwo girls are afraid that, because the cult are targeting blond virgins, they might be next. They ask Reynolds for a lift home, and have a conversation about virgins being targeted, and how scared they are, and how much safer they would be if they weren’t virgins, so Reynolds pulls the car off the road.\n\nNext morning, he’s found hanged, and the two girls are sitting up at the top of a cliff where the rope was secured.\n\nMulder and Scully are called in to help detective White investigate the case. They talk about the satanic cult rumours, talk about blond virgins, and Scully debunks them. Mulder asks “Do you think she’s a virgin?” and Scully replies “I doubt she’s even a blond.”\n\nAfter Scully has finished poo-pooing the satanic rumours, the coffin catches fire.\n\nThe two girls continue their witchy killings, and the twonsfolk start getting a bit pitchforky. At one point they discover a bag belonging to the local pediatrician, buried on a field containing what they think are the bones of a child. They bang on the doctor’s door, which is alarming to him, as he’s relaxing in a nightie and makeup.\n\nMulder seeks information from the only reliable source in the town: An astrologer who won’t talk to him unless he pays her consulting fee. Yes, that’s how serious this is. She talls him about a once in a lifetime celestial convergence that’s causing everything.\n\nThere’s an impressive sequence when the two girls, having fallen out over a boy, are brought together in the police station, and all of a sudden furniture starts moving and everyone’s guns start discharging randomly. They had fun with this.\n\nIn the end it all resolves itself when Mulder puts the two girls in a cell until after midnight. An unsatisfying end to what was quite an entertaining episode.\n\nThe last episode on this tape is Grotesque. A serial killer is caught, but Mulder believes he’s possessed by an evil spirit, especially when a new victim is discovered, killed after the man is in custody. Kurtwood Smith plays the lead investigator, an agent whom Mulder knew at Quantico, and clearly didn’t get on with.\n\nAnother man is attacked, but he survives, although horribly mutilated. One of Smith’s agents had been bitten by the original killer. I wonder if that’s going to be significant?\n\nNope, he ends up dead, and made into a clay gargoyle.\n\nIt was Kurtwood Smith all along, presumably possessed by the evil spirit. Not a classic episode.\n\nAfter this, recording continues with the start of an episode of Quantum Leap and the tape ends during that.\n\nIn the trailers, there’s a Sky Sports trailer about Newcastle featuring Kevin Keegan saying “I would love it if we beat them”. This is only remarkable because, only a couple of hours ago, Danny Baker tweeted that same image in a tweet about football today. Seriously, if I were remotely superstitious, this kind of thing happening constantly would push me into believing I was some divine being at the nexus of all known realities.\n\nAdverts:\n\ntrail: Murder One\n\nMiller Time\n\nBT\n\nRenault Megane – Tony Gardner\n\ntrail: Pulp Fiction\n\ntrail: Space: Above and Beyond/The Outer Limits\n\nToyota\n\nNizoral\n\nSomerfield\n\nMiller Genuine Draft\n\nBarb Wire in cinemas\n\nToyota Corolla\n\ntrail: Football\n\ntrail: The Commish\n\nDance Zone 7\n\nFairy Ultra\n\nCarte D’Or\n\nCopycat in cinemas\n\nSurf\n\nThe Best … In The World Ever\n\ntrail: Schwarzenegger’s Bank Holiday Season\n\ntrail: Pulp Fiction\n\nPeugeot 306\n\nJeyes Parozone\n\nFruitang\n\nSafeway\n\nCoca Cola\n\nPantene\n\nBoyz of Swing\n\ntrail: Strange Luck\n\ntrail: Space: Above and Beyond\n\nEricsson\n\nThe Sun – Hewitt – My Love for Diana\n\nLost Property\n\nWrigley’s Doublemint Gum\n\nMcDonalds\n\ntrail: The Client\n\ntrail: Space: Above and Beyond\n\nAce Biscuit\n\nSan Marco\n\nStill Tango\n\nBritish Meat\n\nMagnum\n\ntrail: Boxing\n\ntrail: Space: Above and Beyond\n\nRobinson’s Fruit & Barley\n\nNizoral\n\nSpecsavers\n\nRobinson’s Fruit & Barley\n\ntrail: Sky Sports\n\ntrail: Only The Strong\n\nAllied Dunbar\n\nHartley’s Jam\n\nSisters of Swing 2\n\ntrail: Quantum Leap\n\ntrail: Space: Above and Beyond\n\nSky TV Guide\n\nStreet Fighter on video\n\nScrumpy Jack\n\nAriel Futur\n\nToo Good to be True\n\nLadykillers\n\nStreet Fighter on video\n\ntrail: Tomorrow on Sky\n\ntrail: Space: Above and Beyond/The Outer Limits\n\nFord Escort\n\nDiet Irn Bru\n\nKleenex Quilted\n\nHead & Shoulders\n\nViva Europop\n\nFord Escort\n\nFastext\n\ntrail: The Shadow\n\ntrail: The Feds\n\nDr Pepper\n\nOrbit/Extra\n\nSpecial K\n\nTetley\n\nBT\n\ntrail: Surviving The Game\n\nBacardi Breezer\n\nViennetta\n\nBT\n\nAA Insurance\n\ntrail: Unsolved Mysteries\n\ntrail: Space: Above and Beyond/The Outer Limits\n\nFunkmaster Mix\n\nAmerican Express Travellers Cheques\n\nSolero\n\nUp Close & Personal in cinemas\n\nVauxhall\n\nMcVities Digestives\n\nTrue Brit\n\ntrail: The Feds\n\ntrail: Rugby\n\nFord Half & Half\n\nAlanis Morissette – Jagged Little Pill\n\nFuturoscope\n\nLe Shuttle\n\nPersil\n\ntrail: The Shadow\n\ntrail: Demolition Man\n\nPeugeot 106\n\nVodafone – Kyle MacLachlan\n\nBravo\n\nTrebor Extra Strong Mints\n\nBoots Soltan\n\nPeugeot 106\n\ntrail: Boxing/The Shadow\n\ntrail: The X Files\n\nBT\n\nRyvita\n\nUp Close & Personal in cinemas\n\nGillette Sensor Excel for Women\n\ntrail: The Specialist\n\ntrail: It Could Happen To You\n\ntrail: Space: Above and Beyond/The Outer Limits\n\nDiet Irn Bru\n\nRight Guard\n\nChrysler Neon\n\nSomerfield\n\nFrom Dusk Til Dawn in cinemas\n\nNestle Clusters\n\nJohnson’s Suncare\n\nMr Kiplng\n\ntrail: Trial By Jury\n\nWe start this tape with an episode of The Net already in progress. Here’s Professor Luc Soete telling us that the EU should tax the ‘digital economy’. His proposal is a flat rate tax on ‘every piece of electronic data flowing across European computer networks. He calls it the Bit Tax.’ Only a small amount. One cent per megabit. Which would work out at something like £200 for a two hour HD netflix movie.\n\nChris Wise, who works for an architect’s firm building prestigious buildings, is worried how this kind of Bit Tax would affect his business. They ship an enormous amount of data between offices. “We sent about One Gigabyte of information in drawn form from here to Germany and back again” over the course of designing a headquarters for a bank. Imagine that. One gigabyte. Meanwhile, as I type this, I’m uploading two gigabytes of video data to Youtube in the form of this episode. I hope I can afford the Bit Tax on that.\n\nThis all really seems to be an example of policy being decided by people who have never heard of Moore’s Law.\n\nNext, Rupert Goodwins takes us to Comdex in Las Vegas. Is Comdex still going?\n\nHe’s talking about company T-Shirts with ‘horrific slogans on the back’ and this shot goes past. I wish I knew what it was covering up.\n\nFor someone who writes for PC Magazine, Goodwins certainly seems to have the requisite ‘Microsoft are an Evil Empire’ stance. We get a glimpse of Bill Gates at his keynote. Along with a dubious apostrophe.\n\nThe next item is about porn. “It’s impossible to say how much pornography is on the internet, but there’s no question it’s there.” That’s a statement that could be made about absolutely any subject under the sun. Fenella George reports.\n\nPeter Dawe was the founder of Pipex, and after selling it for a fortune he founded Internet Watch, a charity watchdog concerned with online porn.\n\nCliff Stanford of Demon Internet would rather have a self regulating industry than government imposed censorship and restrictions.\n\nAlison Mitchell, presenter of Money Box, talks about the web sites she likes.\n\nThe show rounds off with an interesting interview with writer William Gibson. He’s remarkably astute on most of what he talks about, and he’s honest enough to admit that his original conception of cyberspace from Neuromancer doesn’t bear much similarity with the internet as it was in 1997.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 20th January 1997 – 23:15\n\nRecording switches to the end of Common as Muck followed by a trailer for the next episode. There’s also a trailer for Omnibus.\n\nThen, another unmarked programme, and a nice surprise. It’s Breaking the Code, Hugh Whitemore’s play about Alan Turing, starring Derek Jacobi as Turing.\n\nPrunella Scales plays young Turing’s mother.\n\nAlun Armstrong plays the policeman to whom Turing reported a burglary, which led to his arrest and prosecution for homosexuality.\n\nThis is adapted from Whitemore’s stage play, and the roots are obvious. Long sections of the film are virtually monologues, with Jacobi explaining things like Godel’s incompleteness theorem, and his paper ‘On Computable Numbers’. It appeals to the nerdy side of me. The story of Bletchley Park, and the breaking of the Enigma and Lorenz code machines, is one of the most inspiring stories of clever people thinking deeply about problems and finding ways to solve them. In the case of the Lorenz cipher, which was the replacement for Enigma, and far more complex, the codebreakers at Bletchley Park were able to break the codes without ever having even seen one of the machines they were deciphering. Of course, the fact they had to build the world’s first digital computer, Colossus, in order to break it only adds to my admiration.\n\nThe other side of this drama, of course, is the hounding of Turing for his homosexuality. As this part of the story kicks in, I just start getting angry. There’s a scene, set in 1953, where Turing meets Pat Green, one of his colleagues at Bletchley Park, who had once fallen in love with Turing during the war. Turing tells her about the hormone treatments he’s having to take as a condition of his conviction. “I’m growing breasts.”\n\nThere’s a really interesting exchange in this scene. It’s set in 1953 and Turing talks about his work at Manchester University. “We’ve built a digital computer” he tells her, and the assumption is that this is the first. This play was written in the 80s, so I presume that the building of Colossus as the very first digital computer had not yet been declassified.\n\nI visited Bletchley Park in December for a talk about the reconstruction of Colossus they’ve undertaken. All the original machines were disassembled and destroyed after the war, for security reasons, but a faithful reconstruction of the machine is now working at Bletchley Park. It’s quite impressive to see.\n\nHarold Pinter appears in the final scene as John Smith, a government security officer, quizzing Turing on his holiday plans, and making it clear that he was being watched, and was considered a security risk.\n\nTuring died of poisoning, from an apple laced with poison. It’s assumed he took his own life, probably due to this appalling treatment. There’s a coda, which talks about the naming of a ring road in Manchester after him, which I’m sure was intended to be a positive ending, but a stinky, polluted ring road isn’t really a fitting memorial to the man, so this comes off as just banal.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 5th February 1997 – 22:30\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for Common as Muck, and a trailer for Crimewatch UK. Once again, I’m slightly taken aback to see Jill Dando.\n\nRecording switches, and we have another episode of The Net. Again, the start of the programme is missing, which is annoying. What’s also annoying is that we seem to be missing a few episodes, as this one is a few weeks later.\n\nThe first item looks at Virtual Stonehenge, a project to recreate Stonehenge in VR, and other recreations of historical places and events.\n\nNext, and tying in somewhat to the previous programme, Fenella George looks at the reconstruction of the Mark One computer at Manchester University, the digital computer Alan Turing told Pat George about in the play.\n\nTom Kilburn was the person who wrote the first stored program that was run on the computer.\n\nChris Burton of the Computer Conservation Society, was behind the preservation and reconstruction attempts.\n\nAlso featured was Leo, one of the first business computers, built by the Lyons company.\n\nDr John Pinkerton was the designer of Leo.\n\nThis piece turns into a look at the state of the UK computer industry. Nice to see a clip from Making the Most of the Micro.\n\nAcorn co-founder Herman Hauser is investing in UK technology companies.\n\nThe piece ends with a look at plans to build the National Computer Museum at Bletchley Park, with Tony Sale, the man behind the rebuild of Colossus, which had been completed in the last year.\n\nThe next item sees NTK’s Danny O’Brien look at the new phenomenon of playing old games. Retro gaming.\n\nPeter Cochrane, a futurologist working for BT, talks about leaving a vast store of memories on the net,\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 17th February 1997 – 23:15\n\nThe next episode is the last one in the series. The first item looks at a new wave of satellites with high resolution. Gil Amelio used to be a CEO of Apple.\n\nThese companies want to offer the high resolution satellite images commercially. I forget that this was quite a few years before Google Maps. The predicted offering would see you selecting the area you’re interested in on a map, and then the company would ship you a CD ROM with all the imagery they have in that area.\n\nThe next item is an interview with digital artist Jane Prophet.\n\nThe forthcoming General Election will be the first one since the Web became available, so the programme looks at what will be happening on the web during the election. Including contributions from Simon Waldman of the Guardian New Media Lab.\n\nSomeone has built what they call a Virtual Parliament, supposed to be some kind of cyberspace world where you can interact with avatars of politicians. God, VR in the 90s was uniformly awful, wasn’t it?\n\nThe last contribution is interesting. “A way for our politicians to gauge what public opinion is, like an enormous postbag, but a public postbag, so that everybody can see what everybody else is saying.” I think he’s just described Twitter.\n\nNext, Tom Ray, a biologist, is experimenting in artificial life.\n\nHe’s working on a project to create a large ecosystem of digital lifeforms which can evolve. It sounds like a project I was involved in briefly at the BBC years later called ‘Evo Warriors’ which eventually became the children’s programme Bamzooki.\n\nTrude Mostue, briefly famous as one of the training vets on a BBC documentary series, looks at virtual pets, including the first Tamagotchi in the UK.\n\nThe final piece is about the Net’s own VR community The Mirror. You know what I was saying about all 90s VR looking like shit?\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 24th February 1997 – 23:15\n\nAfter this, recording continues. There’s a trailer for Modern Times. Then Weatherview with John Kettley. There’s a trailer for Open Saturday from the Open University.\n\nThen, The Midnight Hour, hosted by Margaret Thatcher’s former press secretary Bernard Ingham. Tell me again about the BBC’s left wing bias?\n\nThe panel, rather surprisingly, is mostly women, with David Steel as the token man.\n\nLabour is represented by MP Anne Campbell\n\nOn the Conservative side is Dame Angela Rumbold.\n\nAnd the wildcard is Dr Sheila Lawlor, director of Politeia, a think tank which looks at the role of the state in people’s lives.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 25th February 1997 – 00:00\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for Even Further Abroad with Jonathan Meades. Then the start of the Learning Zone when the tape ends.\n\nThis tape opens with the end of Cutting Edge: The Builders are Coming (I think).\n\nThen, there’s some episodes of the surprisingly dull X-Files lite alien conspiracy theory-based show. No, not Roswell High. Not Project UFO. It’s Dark Skies, and it’s all kicking off in this episode. President Kennedy has been assasinated, presumably by an alien-possessed Lee Harvey Oswald. Jackie Kennedy is there.\n\nWe also get to see a flashback to what really happened at Roswell. There was a scheduled meeting with the aliens.\n\nTheir envoy arrives, and communicates with President Truman.\n\nThe alien asks for complete surrender by Earth, but Frank Bach (JT Walsh) thinks the aliens are bluffing. This presumably starts the covert war between Earth and the ‘greys’.\n\nThe episode ends with our hero, John Loengard, fighting an alien possessed sniper in a helicopter, who’s trying to shoot heads of state at Kennedy’s funeral. Which was apparently the aliens’ plan. There’s also a chilling throwaway line “The truth is we’ve got a race of aliens that’s got all our world leaders together so they can crash a 707 into them.” This was five years before September 11th.\n\nIn the next episode, Kimberly has dreams about an astronaut, and says they have to go to Florida to find him. Turns out, he’s real.\n\nHe was abducted at the same time as she was, which is why they’re mentally connected.\n\nKim goes under regression to remember more, and she remembers there was another astronaut there, and he must be the one who was implanted with an alien, so it’s a mad rush to stop the launch of the latest mission. Lots of NASA stock footage in this episode.\n\nThe next episode opens with creepy Stanley Kamel (Dr Lester in Murder One) who seems to be running some kind of hypnosis experiment on students, as he gets a student to cross the road on a red light and get run over.\n\nIt’s Beatlemania in New York, and John and Kim are there looking for alien activity. Perhaps Paul is implanted with an alien, and that’s what started all those Paul is Dead rumours. They have a very ropey sounding Beatles tribute act standing in.\n\ntalking of dodgy impressions, John gets into the band’s sound check, and he meets a sound engineer for the BBC with a very shaky English accent.\n\nAnd they just keep coming, with the Beatles’ manager Brian Epstein.\n\nJohn Lennon himself.\n\nJohn and Kim find the researcher, pretending to do market research on adverts, but secretly showing them subliminal images that definitely do work and aren’t nonsense.\n\nThey foil a plan to induce mass suicide in the audience for the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show.\n\nBefore the next episode, the end of another episode of Cutting Edge.\n\nThe final episode here is Dreamland. John and Kim go to Las Vegas, and meet Howard Hughes, who wants to fight the aliens because they come into his casinos and count cards at blackjack.\n\nThe only interesting thing I’ve found in this dreary programme is that the two main characters spend an inordinately large amount of time worrying about their car. Seriously, it comes up in almost every episode. It’s a surprisingly mundane and real facet of an otherwise rather silly genre show.\n\nAfter the final episode here, recording continues for a bit with Jamaica ER. The tape ends during this.\n\nThere’s some trailers for Brass Eye, a series trailer, one for Technology, and for the infamous Drugs episode.\n\nAdverts:\n\ntrail: Jamaica ER\n\ntrail: Cutting Edge\n\nPeperami\n\nProctocream HC\n\nNytol\n\nSetlers Wind-eze\n\nSurf\n\nKleenex\n\nPatak’s\n\nPoligrip\n\nBupa\n\nPeperami Gobbler\n\ntrail: Last Chance Lottery\n\ntrail: ER\n\nPPP Healthcare\n\nCheltenham & Gloucester\n\nCentrum\n\nStrepsils\n\nFiat Bravo/Brava\n\nCheltenham & Gloucester\n\nFord Ka\n\nUPS\n\nFord Ka\n\nMarmite\n\nWired\n\nFord Ka\n\nIkea\n\nFord Ka\n\ntrail: Cutting Edge: Identical Twins\n\ntrail: NBA\n\nTeletext\n\nEmirates\n\nHSE\n\nClerical Medical\n\nThe Post Office\n\nRenault Megane – Hugh Dennis\n\nClearasil\n\nOptions\n\ntrail: Secret Lives: Princess Margaret\n\ntrail: ER\n\nVauxhall Corsa – Ruby Wax\n\nWired\n\nClerical Medical\n\nSony In Car CD\n\nBlockbuster Video – Mission Impossible\n\nOrange\n\nAllied Dunbar\n\nCrush\n\nCellnet – John Simm\n\nRover\n\ntrail: Brass Eye\n\ntrail: NBA\n\nNissan Almera – Professionals Parody with Phil Cornwell\n\nEurostar\n\nTV Licensing\n\nCanesten Combi\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nNissan\n\ntrail: Brass Eye\n\ntrail: Seriously Funny\n\nBurger King\n\nVolvo\n\nDirect Line\n\nLynx\n\nThe Mirror\n\nVW Golf\n\nPuma Cell\n\nMcDonalds\n\nBaxter’s Soup\n\nAcid Jazz Volume Two\n\nCellnet\n\ntrail: Cutting Edge: The Health Farm\n\ntrail: Here’s Johnny\n\nThe Mirror\n\nFinish\n\nThe Mirror\n\nNurofen\n\nRoC\n\nAndrex\n\nNational Lottery\n\nCarte Noire\n\nFerrero Rocher – Why Ambassador…\n\ntrail: Brass Eye\n\nNBA\n\nIndependence Day on video\n\nAllied Dunbar\n\nGillette Sensor Excel\n\nBT – Rory McGrath, David Schneider\n\nSaab 900\n\nVauxhall Corsa – Ruby Wax\n\nBlockbuster Video – Independence Day\n\nUPS\n\nLe Shuttle\n\nThe Equitable Life\n\nPuma Cell\n\nUPS\n\ntrail: Damage\n\nPeugeot 306\n\nTerritorial Army\n\nPatak’s\n\nFruitini\n\nLurpak\n\ntrail: NBA Raw\n\nFirst, another Cybill, and today she’s rehearsing for a play with Kevin Sorbo.\n\nMaryann has been spying on her neighbors. Elliott Gould isn’t happy about it.\n\nAfter it doesn’t work out with Cybill, young Kevin finds solace in the arms of Zsa Zsa Gabor.\n\nAfter this, there’s the start of an episode of Father Ted, but for some reason, recording switches after a few minutes – a timer recording, I presume. So next is an episode of Roseanne. I feel betrayed by my inept cataloguing.\n\nRoseanne meets Fred Willard in the restaurant.\n\nHe turns out to be Martin Mull’s fiancee, and Roseanne manages to get him to let her organise the wedding, so of course she goes overboard on the bad taste.\n\nMull’s mother is played by June Lockhart off of Lost in Space.\n\nThere’s a lot of famous looking faces that I don’t recognise. In particular, right at the end, after Dan is sniggering at the two men kissing, and Roseanne says “there’s nothing wrong with two people of the same sex kissing” a woman sits behind Roseanne and says hello. I wasn’t quite sure, but I thought she looked like Mariel Hemingway (iMDb confirms this). So I presume she might have been in the news either for a same sex relationship, or a part in a film or something. It seemed like an in-joke. So I did some googling, to find that Hemingway has been in the show before, playing Sandra Bernhard’s girlfriend, and she kissed Roseanne, which explains the audience reaction to her appearance.\n\nAfter this, there’s an episode of The Mark Thomas Comedy Product. In response to a possible drought in Yorkshire, he tries to deliver a tanker of water from Ethiopia. They’ve also recording a pastiche of Do They Know it’s Christmas.\n\nAfter this, there’s the start of an episode of The Girlie Show. Then recording switches, and there’s an episode of TFI Friday. It opens with music from Shed Seven.\n\nRacing driver Martin Brundle is interviewed after a big crash.\n\nJo Brand in the next guest.\n\nMusic from Gene.\n\nAmanda Donohoe is another guest.\n\nMore Shed Seven follows. I was disappointed that their song Going for Gold wasn’t a cover of Hans Zimmer’s iconic theme song to the Henry Kelly Euro-quiz.\n\nThere’s another short segment of At Home with Chris and Cher.\n\nThe next guest is Ian McKellen\n\nMusic from Van Morrison\n\nThere’s an attempt to get an interview by satellite from Las Vegas with boxing promoter Don King, but he’s running late, and a young sound assistant called Shaun is left to tell Chris that ‘Don King is one minute away’ rather too many times.\n\nThe show ends with another song from Van Morrison.\n\nAfter this, there’s a whole episode of Beavis and Butthead. They dig for oil, but the crack a sewer pipe instead, and don’t realise. It’s funny because it’s poop.\n\nFollowing this, recording continues with the start of Derek Jarman’s Sebastiane, his softcore gay porn film about roman soliders, with dialogue in latin. Not my cup of tea, if I’m honest.\n\nThe tape ends during the film.\n\nAdverts:\n\ntrail: Tonight on 4\n\nNissan Primera\n\nCover Girl\n\nFerrero Rocher – Why Ambassador…\n\nSafeway\n\nOrganics\n\nJif\n\ntrail: Honeymoon in Vegas\n\nForever Ella\n\nToyota\n\ntrail: Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey\n\nHonda\n\ntrail: Encounters\n\ntrail: And The Beat Goes On\n\nMurphy’s\n\nI Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter\n\nThe Equitable Life\n\nMurphy’s\n\nI Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter\n\ntrail: Honeymoon in Vegas\n\nFT\n\nUPS\n\nColgate\n\nTampax\n\nHula Hoops\n\ntrail: And The Beat Goes On\n\ntrail: Big Mouth\n\nMcDonalds\n\nToyota\n\nCanesten Combi\n\nAir Canada\n\nGordon’s & Tonic\n\nCadbury’s Roses\n\nMurphy’s\n\ntrail: Calling Bible John\n\nGalaxy\n\nBurger King\n\nPeugeot 406\n\nBT\n\nBacardi Spice\n\nWrangler\n\nArmy Soldier\n\nGalaxy Fruit and Hazelnut\n\ntrail: And The Beat Goes On\n\ntrail: Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey\n\ntrail: Honeymoon in Vegas\n\nVW Golf\n\nLil-lets\n\nLexmark\n\nOK Weekly\n\nShine Four\n\nWorthington Draught – Harry Enfield\n\n100% Pure Groove\n\nMcDonalds\n\nRenault Clio\n\nGeneral Accident\n\nGuinness\n\nAlton Towers\n\ntrail: And The Beat Goes On\n\nCoca Cola\n\nCanesten Combi\n\nFT\n\nCadbury’s Roses\n\nCadbury’s\n\nThe Best Rap Album in the World Ever\n\nWash & Go\n\nJohnson’s pH 5.5\n\nPocahontas on video\n\nBurger King\n\ntrail: Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey\n\nVauxhall Corsa – Ruby Wax\n\nBacardi\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nTerry’s Chocolate Orange Siesta\n\nLemon Tango\n\ntrail: Honeymoon in Vegas\n\nLion Bar\n\nThe Best Rap Album in the World Ever\n\nAlton Towers\n\nFiat Punto\n\nArmy Soldier\n\nCanesten Combi\n\nBacardi Spice\n\nNHS Lotto\n\nOK Weekly\n\nLion Bar\n\ntrail: And The Beat Goes On\n\nRenault Clio\n\nChatback\n\nAlton Towers\n\nWrangler\n\nKit Kat\n\nNational Lottery Instants\n\nFT\n\nGaviscon"
