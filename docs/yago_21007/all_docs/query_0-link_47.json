        "text": "Since the late 1980s when he made his mark on the British sketch comedy show \"Saturday Live,\" Harry Enfield has been a fixture of British comedy. His most memorable characters on that program--created along with his writing partner Paul Whitehouse--were Stavros, a Greek kebab shop owner, and Loadsamoney, who annoyed everyone by bragging about his high income. Loadsamoney went on to become an enterprise unto himself, with a hit single and a sold out tour in 1988. Eventually, the character was killed off when Enfield realized his satire was being overlooked. In 1990, he was granted his own program simply entitled \"Harry Enfield's Television Programme.\" That show lasted two years, after which he appeared on programs like \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\" as a chauffeur, and several comedy specials. In 1994, he was given his own show once again, this one called \"Harry Enfield and Chums.\" The show proved to be popular and saw Enfield creating many other memorable characters, including Tim Nice-But-Dim and Tory Boy. After that show's demise in 1997, Enfield mostly laid low, not being the omnipresence he had been previously. Though he could be seen sporadically, he says he felt that he was outdated and unfunny. However, he returned in full force in 2007 with a recurring stint on the comedy/drama \"Skins\" and a new program of his own called \"Ruddy Hell! It's Harry and Paul.\""
