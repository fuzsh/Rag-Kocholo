        "text": "Get updates throughout the day in our Cannes 2000 special report.\n\nCANNES — MTV Films has hooked up with Viacom sibling Paramount Pictures to pick up the hit Brit teen comedy “Kevin and Perry Go Large” for distribution in North America.\n\nPic, which has already grossed $12 million in the U.K. after three weeks in release, is a spinoff of the BBC TV show “Harry Enfield and Chums.”\n\nIt stars the middle-aged Enfield and actress Kathy Burke as two hormonal teenage boys desperate to lose their virginity on a holiday in Ibiza, the Mediterranean island that becomes the hub of Euro rave culture every summer.\n\nPic trades heavily on jokes about uncontrollable erections and vivid close-ups of pimple squeezing. Enfield has said he deliberately set out to out-gross the Yank hit “American Pie.”\n\nAs well as putting its brand on the theatrical release, MTV will heavily promote the film and the characters on its networks. Although one of the BBC’s highest-rating shows, “Harry Enfield and Chums” has never aired in the U.S.\n\nParamount and MTV, which made the deal prior to the U.K. release, believe the film characters have franchise potential. The studio, which paired successfully with MTV on “Beavis and Butt-head Do America,” has not set a U.S. release date.\n\n“Kevin and Perry Go Large” was financed by Icon Entertainment Intl. and co-produced by Tiger Aspect Pictures with Fragile Films. It was directed by Ed Bye."
