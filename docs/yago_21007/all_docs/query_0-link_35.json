        "text": "Because Kathy Burke is the best British character actress of her generation, a comic marvel, and a down-to-earth hero to millions.\n\nShe has won worldwide acclaim in both comedy and serious drama roles. She has range – in both life and work.\n\nAs an actress, she stunned as a battered wife in Nil by Mouth, appalled as a crass tart in her own sitcom Gimme Gimme Gimme, and amazed as a horny (male) teenager in Harry Enfield’s comedy show. Her cameos often steal the show.\n\nAs a director, Kathy has produced numerous plays to critical acclaim. And as a human being she has inspired, encouraged and cheered millions of ordinary citizens. Who else would Stephen Fry put in “Room Lovely” where everything about the world is good and life-enhancing?"
