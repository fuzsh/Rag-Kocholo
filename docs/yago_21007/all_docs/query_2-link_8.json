In this show he takes 25 different roles, all patients of Langham’s psychotherapist (except one, who is Langham’s psychotherapist’s psychotherapist).\n\nThe pair’s collaboration on this project later resulted in Whitehouse taking the witness stand on 24 July 2007 in the trial of Langham, specifically in regard to the charge of holding explicit images and videos of minors. Langham had claimed he downloaded this material as research for a character included in the second series of Help, but Whitehouse’s testimony did not corroborate this explanation.\n\nWhitehouse is appearing in the BBC sketch show Ruddy Hell! It’s Harry and Paul, starring alongside Harry Enfield once again.\n\nWhitehouse and Charlie Higson produced and appeared in a spoof phone-in show, Down the Line, on BBC Radio 4.
