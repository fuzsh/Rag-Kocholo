        "text": "Struggling with insecurity stemming from her cruel-spirited and fickle friends and her own adolescent awkwardness, 14-year-old Plum worshipfully emulates a glamorous young wife who lives in her 1980s Australian suburb, unaware that the woman hides a personal agenda. By the author of Surrender. Read by Rebecca Macauley. Book available.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nReview:\n\nHartnett's dense, sensory prose captures the misery roiling beneath the surface of Plum's awkward, average existence, while the adolescent sense of drama that suffuses the plot should allow teen readers some purchase on an otherwise difficult, though rewarding, read.\n\n--The Horn Book (starred review) The deliberate pacing, insight into teen angst, and masterful word choice make this a captivating read to savor.\n\n--School Library Journal (starred review) The portrait of Plum is exquisitely written; the third-person point of view is steeped in emotional clairvoyance and expressed in poignantly age-appropriate phraseology.\n\n--Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books (starred review) Hartnett's exquisite prose is soaked in visceral descriptions of consumerism, human weakness, and an ugliness that lies just below the surface of everyday life.\n\n--Publishers Weekly (starred review) Suffused with the helpless shame of being unable to soothe the private sadness of loved ones, this is another strong addition to Hartnett's impressive bibliography.\n\n--Booklist Lush with a melancholy beauty.\n\n--Kirkus Reviews With heavy language, lavish imagery, and a psychological focus, Hartnett's novel is, stylistically, a piece of literary fiction--a genre not often seen in the cannons of young adult literature.\n\n--VOYA\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nSonya Hartnett is the winner of the 2008 Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award, the world's largest award for lifetime achievement in children's and youth literature. She lives in Australia.\n\n\"About this title\" may belong to another edition of this title."
