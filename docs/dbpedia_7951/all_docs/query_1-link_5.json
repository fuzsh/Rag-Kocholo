        "text": "Here is Plum Coyle, on the threshold of adolescence, striving to be new.\n\nHer fourteenth birthday is approaching: her old life and her old body will fall away, and she will become graceful, powerful, at ease. The strength in the objects she stores in a briefcase under her bed - a crystal lamb, a yoyo, an antique watch, a penny - will make sure of it.\n\nOver the next couple of weeks, Plum's life will change. Her beautiful neighbour Maureen will begin to show her how she might fly.\n\nThe older brothers she adores - the charismatic Justin, the enigmatic Cydar - will court catastrophe in worlds that she barely knows exist. And her friends - her worst enemies - will tease and test, smelling weakness. They will try to lead her on and take her down. Who ever forgets what happens when you're fourteen?\n\nButterfly is a gripping, disquieting, beautifully observed novel that confirms Hartnett as one of Australia's finest writers.\n\nAuthor Biography: Sonya Hartnett is the internationally acclaimed author of several novels, including Thursday's Child, winner of the 2002 Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, and Forest, winner of the 2002 Children's Book Council of Australia Book of the Year: Older Readers. In 2003, her adult novel, Of a Boy, won The Age Book of the Year and was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Award. Sonya lives in Melbourne. She has a dog named Shilo and a cat named Idaho."
