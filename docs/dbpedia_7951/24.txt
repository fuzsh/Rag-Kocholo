I’ve been reading Sonya Hartnett lately. She’s from Australia — a Candlewick author — and her prose is just gorgeous. True, her YA is dark and also borders on adult, but that’s a line that I love to flirt with myself. Besides, isn’t “dark and bordering on adult” an exact definition of adolescence? Just finished BUTTERFLY – which came out last August. Several sections veer straight into the adult perspective, but she captures these characters so well that I don’t mind at all. (Cydar is especially fantastic.) Other Hartnett titles I’ve admired: SURRENDER and THE GHOST’S CHILD.
