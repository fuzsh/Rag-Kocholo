        "text": "Please join for a series of six discussions focusing on the poetic work of T.S Eliot, the leading Modernist poet, playwright, editor, and literary critic.\n\nEliot exercised a very strong influence on Anglo-American culture from the 1920s until late in the century and continues to be highly valued today. His diction, style, and versification experiments revitalized English poetry, and in a series of critical essays, he shattered old orthodoxies and erected new ones. In 1948, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nWe are going to live read through Eliot’s most groundbreaking works starting with his early \"The Love Song of Alfred J. Prufrock,\" \"The Waste Land,\" and finally the entirety of \"The Four Quartets\"—the crowning achievement of Eliot’s poetic opus. We will discuss all poems during each of the six sessions, each devoted to one specific work by Eliot."
