        "text": "(1888–1965). “I am an Anglo-Catholic in religion, a classicist in literature, and a royalist in politics.” T.S. Eliot so defined, and even exaggerated, his own conservatism. The ideas of this stimulating poet, playwright, and literary critic were perhaps traditional, but the way in which he expressed them was extremely modern. Eliot was one of the first to reject conventional verse forms and language. His experiments with free expression contributed to his reputation as one of the most influential writers of his time.\n\nThomas Stearns Eliot was born in St. Louis, Mo., on Sept. 26, 1888. He came from a distinguished family that had relocated from New England. He entered Harvard University in 1906, completed his course in three years, and earned a master’s degree the next year. After a year at the Sorbonne in Paris, he returned to Harvard. In 1914 further study led him to Merton College, Oxford, and he decided to stay in England. In London Eliot met and began a close association with American poet Ezra Pound. Eliot worked as a teacher and a bank clerk before becoming an editor at a publishing house in the mid-1920s. Precise and moderate in his habits, he devoted his evenings to study and writing.\n\nIn 1915 the verse magazine Poetry published Eliot’s first notable piece, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. It is considered to be the first masterpiece of modernism in English. In this poem and others collected in Prufrock and Other Observations (1917), Eliot tried to create new verse rhythms based on the rhythms of contemporary speech. In 1919 he published a second collection, Poems.\n\nEliot won international acclaim with the appearance of The Waste Land in 1922. The Waste Land is a long poem that powerfully expresses the disillusionment and disgust of the period after World War I. It is considered by many to be Eliot’s most challenging work.\n\nIn 1927 Eliot became a British subject and was confirmed in the Church of England. His conversion to Anglicanism shaped all his subsequent works. Four Quartets (1936–42; published in book form in 1943), his masterpiece, consists of four poems that address spiritual renewal and the connections of the personal and historical past and present. Four Quartets is considered Eliot’s clearest expression of his Christian beliefs.\n\nEliot was also a prolific reviewer and essayist. His first volume of literary criticism was The Sacred Wood (1920), which discussed the writer’s relationship to the literary tradition. In the 1930s his interests broadened into theology and sociology. Influential later essays include The Idea of a Christian Society (1939) and Notes Towards the Definition of Culture (1948)."
