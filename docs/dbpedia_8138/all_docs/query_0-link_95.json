        "text": "© 2014 Don Yorty. All rights reserved.\n\nT.S. Eliot reads Landscapes\n\n…\n\nI’ve always liked T.S. Eliot’s Landscapes. I think I first read them when I was nineteen. Later on in my twenties, I bought an LP that had the recording of him reading them, a Caedmon recording. Recently I had the LP (which had been packed away for many years under my bed) transferred to a CD so I could put it in my iTunes, and then with a great deal of pleasure, reproduce them for you, some T.S. Eliot I hope you enjoy.\n\nI. New Hampshire\n\nChildren’s voices in the orchard\n\nBetween the blossom- and the fruit-time:\n\nGolden head, crimson head,\n\nBetween the green tip and the root.\n\nBlack wing, brown wing, hover over;\n\nTwenty years and the spring is over;\n\nTo-day grieves and to-morrow grieves,\n\nCover me over, light-in-leaves;\n\nGolden head, black wing,\n\nCling,swing,\n\nSpring,sing,\n\nSwing up into the apple-tree.\n\nII. Virginia\n\nRed river, red river,\n\nSlow flow heat is silence\n\nNo will is still as a river\n\nStill. Will heat move\n\nOnly through the mocking-bird\n\nHeard once? Still hills\n\nWait. Gates wait. Purple trees,\n\nWhite trees, wait, wait,\n\nDelay, decay. Living, living,\n\nNever moving. Ever moving\n\nIron thoughts came with me\n\nAnd go with me:\n\nRed river river river.\n\nIII. Usk\n\nDo not suddenly break the branch, or\n\nHope to find\n\nThe white hart over the white well.\n\nGlance aside, not for lance, do not spell\n\nOld enchantments. Let them sleep.\n\n“Gently dip, but not too deep,”\n\nLift your eyes\n\nWhere the roads dip and where the roads rise\n\nSeek only there\n\nWhere the grey light meets the green air\n\nThe hermit’s chapel, the pilgrim’s prayer.\n\nIV. Rannoch, near Glencoe\n\nHere the crow starves, here the patient stag\n\nBreeds for the the rifle. Between the soft moor\n\nand the soft sky, scarcely room\n\nTo leap or to soar. Substance crumbles, in the thin air\n\nMoon cold or moon hot. The road winds in\n\nListlessness of ancient war,\n\nLangour of broken steel,\n\nClamour of confused wrong, apt\n\nIn silence. Memory is strong\n\nBeyond the bone. Pride snapped,\n\nShadow of pride is long, in the long pass\n\nNo concurrence of bone.\n\nV. Cape Ann\n\nO quick quick quick, quick hear the song sparrow,\n\nSwamp-sparrow, fox-sparrow, vesper-sparrow\n\nAt dawn and dusk. Follow the dance\n\nOf goldfinch at noon. Leave to chance\n\nThe Blackburnian warbler, the shy one. Hail\n\nWith shrill whistle the note of the quail, the bob-white\n\nDodging the bay-bush. Follow the feet\n\nOf the walker, the water-thrush. Follow the flight\n\nOf the dancing arrow, the purple martin. Greet\n\nIn silence the bullbat. All are delectable. Sweet sweet sweet\n\nBut resign this land at the end, resign it\n\nTo its true owner, the tough one, the sea-gull.\n\nThe palaver is finished.\n\n1933-1934"
