        "text": "Thomas Stearns Eliot OM (September 26, 1888 - January 4, 1965) was an American-born English poet, playwright, and literary critic, arguably the most important English-language poet of the 20th century.[3] He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948.[4]\n\nLife[]\n\nOverview[]\n\nBorn in St. Louis, Missouri, Eliot went east for college and was educated at Harvard University. After graduation, he studied philosophy at the Sorbonne for a year, then won a scholarship to Merton College, Oxford in 1914. An expatriate, he became a British citizen at the age of 39.\n\nThe poem that made Eliot's name, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock – begun in 1910 and published in Chicago in 1915 – is regarded as a masterpiece of modernist poetry in English. He followed this with what have become some of the best-known poems in the English language, including Gerontion (1920), The Waste Land (1922), The Hollow Men (1925), Ash Wednesday (1930), and Four Quartets (1945).[5] He is also known for his 7 plays, particularly Murder in the Cathedral (1935).\n\n\"[M]y poetry has obviously more in common with my distinguished contemporaries in America than with anything written in my generation in England,\" he said of his nationality and its role in his work. \"It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good ... if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from America.\" Eliot renounced his citizenship to the United States and said: \"My mind may be American but my heart is British.\"[6]\n\nYouth and education[]\n\nEliot was born into the Eliot family, a bourgeois family[7] originally from New England]], who had moved to St. Louis, Missouri.[5] His father, Henry Ware Eliot (1843–1919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St. Louis. Eliot credits his hometown with seeding his literary vision: \"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the big river [Mississippi], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\"[8] His mother, Charlotte Champe Stearns (1843–1929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children; his parents were both 44 years old when he was born. His 4 sisters were between 11 and 19 years older; his brother was 8 years older. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather Thomas Stearns.\n\nFrom 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended Smith Academy, where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was 14 under the influence of Edward Fitzgerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, a translation of the poetry of Omar Khayyam. He said the results were gloomy and despairing, and he destroyed them. His oldest surviving poem, an untitled lyric, dates from January 1905. The first poem that he showed anyone, \"A Fable For Feasters,\" was written as a school exercise when he was 15, and was published in the Smith Academy Record, and later in The Harvard Advocate, Harvard University's student magazine.[9] He also published 3 short stories in 1905, including \"The Man Who Was King\", which reflects his exploration of Igorot Village while visiting the 1904 World's Fair of St. Louis.\n\nAfter graduation, Eliot attended Milton Academy in Massachusetts for a preparatory year, where he met Scofield Thayer, who would later publish The Waste Land. He studied philosophy at Harvard from 1906 to 1909, earning a B.A. after 3 years instead of the usual 4.[5] Frank Kermode writes that the most important moment of Eliot's undergraduate career was in 1908, when he discovered Arthur Symons's Symbolist Movement in Literature (1899). This introduced him to Jules Laforgue, Arthur Rimbaud, and Paul Verlaine. Without Verlaine, Eliot wrote, he might never have heard of Tristan Corbière and his book Les amours jaunes, a work that affected the course of Eliot's life.[10] The Harvard Advocate published some of his poems, and he became lifelong friends with Conrad Aiken, the American novelist.\n\nAfter working as a philosophy assistant at Harvard 1909-1910, Eliot moved to Paris, where from 1910-1911, he studied philosophy at the Sorbonne. He attended lectures by Henri Bergson and read poetry with Alain-Fournier.[5][10] From 1911 to 1914, he was back at Harvard studying Indian philosophy and Sanskrit.[5][11] Eliot was awarded a scholarship to Merton College, Oxford in 1914. He 1st visited Marburg, Germany, where he planned to take a summer program, but when the First World War broke out, he went to Oxford instead. At the time, so many American students attended Merton that the Junior Common Room proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the Americanization of Oxford\"; it was defeated by 2 votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.[12]\n\nEliot did not settle at Merton, and left after a year. He wrote to Conrad Aiken on New Year's Eve 1914: \"I hate university towns and university people, who are the same everywhere, with pregnant wives, sprawling children, many books and hideous pictures on the walls ... Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead.\"[12] By 1916, he had completed a Ph.D. dissertation for Harvard on Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of F.H. Bradley,[13] but he failed to return for the viva voce exam.[5]\n\nMarriage[]\n\nIn a letter to Aiken late in December 1914, Eliot, aged 26, wrote, \"I am very dependent upon women (I mean female society).\"[14] Less than 4 months later, Thayer introduced Eliot to Vivienne Haigh-Wood, a Cambridge governess. They were married at Hampstead Register Office on June 26, 1915.[15]\n\nAfter a short visit alone to his family in the United States, Eliot returned to London and took several teaching jobs, such as lecturing at Birkbeck College, University of London. Philosopher Bertrand Russell took an interest in Vivienne while the newlyweds stayed in his flat. Some scholars have suggested that she and Russell had an affair, but the allegations were never confirmed.[16] In a private paper written in his 60's, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness. To me, it brought the state of mind out of which came The Waste Land.\"[17] (Their relationship was the subject of a 1984 play Tom and Viv, which in 1994 was adapted as a film.)\n\nTeaching, Lloyds, Faber and Faber[]\n\nAfter leaving Merton, Eliot worked as a schoolteacher, most notably at Highgate School, a private school in London, where he taught French and Latin[5]—his students included the young John Betjeman. Later he taught at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, a state school in Buckinghamshire. To earn extra money, he wrote book reviews and lectured at evening extension courses. In 1917, he took a position at Lloyds Bank in London, working on foreign accounts. On a trip to Paris in August 1920, he met the writer James Joyce and the artist Wyndham Lewis. Eliot said he found Joyce arrogant—Joyce doubted Eliot's ability as a poet at the time—but the two soon became friends, with Eliot's visiting Joyce whenever he was in Paris.[18]\n\nIn 1925, Eliot left Lloyds to join the publishing firm Faber & Gwyer, later Faber & Faber, where he remained for the rest of his career, eventually becoming a director. Wyndham Lewis and Eliot became close friends, a friendship leading to Lewis's well-known painting of Eliot in 1938.\n\nAnglicanism and British citizenship[]\n\nOn June 29, 1927 Eliot converted to Anglicanism from Unitarianism, and in November that year he took British citizenship. He became a warden of his parish church, Saint Stephen's, Gloucester Road, London,[19] and a life member of the Society of King Charles the Martyr.[20] He specifically identified as Anglo-Catholic, proclaiming himself \"classicist in literature, royalist in politics, and anglo-catholic [sic] in religion.\"[21][22] About thirty years later Eliot commented on his religious views that he combined \"a Catholic cast of mind, a Calvinist heritage, and a Puritanical temperament.\"[23]\n\nSeparation and remarriage[]\n\nBy 1932, Eliot had been contemplating a separation from his wife for some time. When Harvard offered him the Charles Eliot Norton professorship for the 1932-1933 academic year, he accepted and left Vivienne in England. Upon his return, he arranged for a formal separation from her, avoiding all but 1 meeting with her between his leaving for America in 1932 and her death in 1947. Vivienne was committed to the Northumberland House mental hospital, Stoke Newington, in 1938, and remained there until she died. Although Eliot was still legally her husband, he never visited her.[24]\n\nFrom 1946 to 1957, Eliot shared a flat with his friend John Davy Hayward, who gathered and archived Eliot's papers, styling himself \"Keeper of the Eliot Archive.\"[25] Hayward also collected Eliot's pre-Prufrock verse, commercially published after Eliot's death as Poems Written in Early Youth. When Eliot and Hayward separated their household in 1957, Hayward retained his collection of Eliot's papers, which he bequeathed to King's College, Cambridge in 1965.\n\nOn January 10, 1957, Eliot at the age of 68 married Esmé Valerie Fletcher, who was 32. In contrast to his first marriage, Eliot knew Fletcher well, as she had been his secretary at Faber and Faber since August 1949. They kept their wedding secret; the ceremony was held in a church at 6.15 a.m. with virtually no one in attendance other than his wife's parents. Since Eliot's death, Valerie has dedicated her time to preserving his legacy; she has edited and annotated The Letters of T. S. Eliot and a facsimile of the draft of The Waste Land. In the early 1960s, by then in failing health, Eliot worked as an editor for the Wesleyan University Press, seeking new poets in Europe for publication.[26]\n\nDeath and honours[]\n\nEliot died of emphysema in London on January 4, 1965. For many years he had had health problems caused by his heavy smoking, and had often been laid low with bronchitis or tachycardia. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. In accordance with Eliot's wishes, his ashes were taken to St Michael's Church in East Coker, the village from which his ancestors had emigrated to America.\n\nA wall plaque commemorates him with a quotation from his poem \"East Coker\": \"In my beginning is my end. In my end is my beginning.\"\n\nIn 1967, on the 2nd anniversary of his death, Eliot was commemorated by the installation of a large stone in the floor of Poets' Corner in London's Westminster Abbey. The stone, cut by designer Reynolds Stone, is inscribed with his life dates, his Order of Merit, and a quotation from his poem \"Little Gidding\": \"the communication / Of the dead is tongued with fire beyond / the language of the living.\"[27]\n\nWriting[]\n\nPoetry[]\n\nFor a poet of his stature, Eliot produced a relatively small amount of poetry and he was aware of this early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"[28]\n\nTypically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets, and then collected them in books. His first collection was Prufrock and Other Observations (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in Ara Vos Prec (London) and Poems: 1920 (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected The Waste Land and the poems in Prufrock and Poems into one volume and added The Hollow Men to form Poems: 1909–1925. From then on, he updated this work as Collected Poems. Exceptions are Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats (1939), a collection of light verse; Poems Written in Early Youth, posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published 1907-1910 in The Harvard Advocate,[29] and Inventions of the March Hare: Poems, 1909-1917, material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.\n\nThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock[]\n\nMain article: The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\n\nIn 1915 Ezra Pound, overseas editor of Poetry magazine, recommended to Harriet Monroe, the magazine's founder, that she publish \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\". Although the character Prufrock seems to be middle-aged, Eliot wrote most of the poem when he was only 22. Its now-famous opening lines, comparing the evening sky to \"a patient etherised upon a table,\" were considered shocking and offensive, especially at a time when Georgian Poetry was hailed for its derivations of the 19th century Romantic Poets. The poem follows the conscious experience of a man, Prufrock (relayed in the \"stream of consciousness\" form characteristic of the Modernists), lamenting his physical and intellectual inertia, the lost opportunities in his life and lack of spiritual progress, with the recurrent theme of carnal love unattained. Critical opinion is divided as to whether the narrator leaves his residence during the course of the narration. The locations described can be interpreted either as actual physical experiences, mental recollections, or as symbolic images from the sub-conscious mind, as, for example, in the refrain \"In the room the women come and go.\" The poem's structure was heavily influenced by Eliot's extensive reading of Dante Alighieri, in the Italian, and refers to a number of literary works, including Hamlet and those of the French Symbolists.\n\nIts reception in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in the Times Literary Supplement on June 21, 1917: \"The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone, even to himself. They certainly have no relation to poetry…\"[30]\n\nThe Waste Land[]\n\nMain article: The Waste Land\n\nIn October 1922 Eliot published The Waste Land in The Criterion. Eliot's dedication to il miglior fabbro (\"the better craftsman\") refers to Ezra Pound's significant hand in editing and reshaping the poem from a longer Eliot manuscript to the shortened version that appears in publication.[31] It was composed during a period of personal difficulty for Eliot—his marriage was failing, and both he and Vivienne were suffering from nervous disorders. The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. That year Eliot lived in Lausanne, Switzerland to take a treatment and to convalesce from a break-down. There he wrote the final section, \"What the Thunder Said,\" which contains frequent references to mountains.[32] Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On November 15, 1922, he wrote to Richard Aldington, saying, \"As for The Waste Land, that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style.\" The poem is known for its obscure nature—its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time.(Citation needed) Despite this, it has become a touchstone of modern literature, a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, James Joyce's Ulysses. Among its best-known phrases are \"April is the cruellest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\"; and \"Shantih shantih shantih,\" the Sanskrit mantra that ends the poem.\n\nThe Hollow Men[]\n\nMain article: The Hollow Men\n\nThe Hollow Men appeared in 1925. For the critic Edmund Wilson, it marked \"the nadir of the phase of despair and desolation given such effective expression in The Waste Land.\"[33] It is Eliot's major poem of the late twenties. Similar to other work, its themes are overlapping and fragmentary: post-war Europe under the Treaty of Versailles (which Eliot despised); the difficulty of hope and religious conversion; and Eliot's failed marriage.[34]\n\nAllen Tate perceived a shift in Eliot's method, writing that, \"The mythologies disappear altogether in The Hollow Men.\" This is a striking claim for a poem as indebted to Dante as anything else in Eliot’s early work, to say little of the modern English mythology—the \"Old Guy Fawkes\" of the Gunpowder Plot—or the colonial and agrarian mythos of Joseph Conrad and James George Frazer, which, at least for reasons of textual history, echo in The Waste Land.[35] The \"continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity\" that is so characteristic of his mythical method remained in fine form.[36] The Hollow Men contains some of Eliot's most famous lines(Citation needed), notably its conclusion:\n\nThis is the way the world ends\n\nThis is the way the world ends\n\nThis is the way the world ends\n\nNot with a bang but a whimper.\n\nAsh Wednesday[]\n\nMain article: Ash Wednesday by T.S. Eliot\n\nAsh Wednesday is the first long poem written by Eliot after his 1927 conversion to Anglicanism. Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when one who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \"conversion poem,\" it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human salvation. The style is different from the poetry that predates his conversion. Ash Wednesday and the poems that followed had a more casual, melodic, and contemplative method.(Citation needed)\n\nMany critics were particularly enthusiastic about it. Edwin Muir maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect,\"[37] though it was not well-received by everyone. The poem's groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular literati.[5]\n\nOld Possum's Book of Practical Cats[]\n\nMain article: Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\n\nIn 1930, Eliot published a book of light verse, Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats (\"Old Possum\" was Ezra Pound's nickname for him). This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer Alan Rawsthorne set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra, in a work entitled Practical Cats. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical, Cats, by Andrew Lloyd Webber, first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on Broadway the following year.\n\nFour Quartets[]\n\nMain article: Four Quartets\n\nEliot regarded Four Quartets as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.[5] It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: Burnt Norton (1936), East Coker (1940), The Dry Salvages (1941) and Little Gidding (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterization, each begins with a rumination on the geographical location of its title, and each meditates on the nature of time in some important respect—theological, historical, physical—and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four classical elements: air, earth, water, and fire.\n\nBurnt Norton asks what it means to consider things that might have been. We see the shell of an abandoned house, and Eliot toys with the idea that all these merely possible realities are present together, invisible to us. All the possible ways people might walk across a courtyard add up to a vast dance we can't see; children who aren't there are hiding in the bushes.\n\nFootfalls echo in the memory\n\nDown the passage which we did not take\n\nTowards the door we never opened\n\nInto the rose-garden.[38]\n\nEast Coker continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope\".\n\nThe Dry Salvages treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"... the past and future/Are conquered, and reconciled\".\n\nLittle Gidding (the element of fire) is the most anthologized of the Quartets. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in The Blitz power the poem, and he imagines meeting Dante during the German bombing. The beginning of the Quartets (\"Houses .../Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of Love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the Quartets end with an affirmation of Julian of Norwich: \"all shall be well and/All manner of thing shall be well\".\n\nThe Four Quartets cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics St. John of the Cross and Julian of Norwich. The \"deeper communion\" sought in East Coker, the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse in order to find healing,\" and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of sanctification.\n\nPlays[]\n\nMain article: Murder in the Cathedral\n\nWith the important exception of his magnum opus Four Quartets, Eliot directed much of his creative energies after Ash Wednesday to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of Elizabethan and Jacobean verse drama; witness his allusions to Webster, Thomas Middleton, William Shakespeare and Thomas Kyd in The Waste Land. In a 1933 lecture he said: \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility. ... He would like to be something of a popular entertainer, and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience, but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"[39]\n\nAfter The Waste Land (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style.\" One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse with a jazz tempo featuring Sweeney, a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Eliot did not finish it. He did publish separately two pieces of what he had written. The two, Fragment of a Prologue (1926) and Fragment of an Agon (1927) were published together in 1932 as Sweeney Agonistes. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.[40]\n\nA pageant play by Eliot called The Rock was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the Diocese of London. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.[40] George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester, had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer E. Martin Browne for the production of The Rock, and later asked Eliot to write another play for the Canterbury Festival in 1935. This one, Murder in the Cathedral, concerning the death of the martyr, Thomas Becket, was more under Eliot's control. After this, he worked on commercial plays for more general audiences: The Family Reunion (1939), The Cocktail Party (1949), The Confidential Clerk, (1953) and The Elder Statesman (1958).\n\nLiterary criticism[]\n\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of literary criticism, strongly influencing the school of New Criticism. While somewhat self-deprecating and minimizing of his work—he once said his criticism was merely a “by-product” of his “private poetry-workshop”[41]—Eliot is considered by some to be one of the greatest literary critics of the 20th century. The critic William Empson once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"[42]\n\nIn his critical essay “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art: “In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.”[41] This essay was a important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a “simultaneous order” of works (i.e. \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem The Waste Land.[43]\n\nAlso important to New Criticism was the idea — as articulated in Eliot’s essay \"Hamlet and His Problems”[44] — of an “objective correlative,” which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences. This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers’ different — but perhaps corollary — interpretations of a work.\n\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his “‘classical’ ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early 17th century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially Shelley; his proposition that good poems constitute \"not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion\"; and his insistence that \"poets…at present must be difficult.’”[45]\n\nEliot’s essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the metaphysical poets. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with—in Eliot's view—wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay \"The Metaphysical Poets,\" along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility,\"[46] which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical.\"[47]\n\nHis 1922 poem The Waste Land[48]also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write “programmatic criticism\"; that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance “historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, The Waste Land likely shows his personal despair about World War I rather than an objective historical understanding of it.[49]\n\nIn 1946 Eliot was a member of a group otherwise composed of senior clergy which produced a report entitled \"Catholicity\" published in 1947 as a contribution to the process which resulted in the Church of England's Report on Doctrine (1948).\n\nIn 1958, the Archbishop of Canterbury appointed Eliot to a commission that produced The Revised Psalter (1963). A harsh critic of Eliot, C.S. Lewis, was also a member of the commission, where their antagonism turned into a friendship.[50]\n\nCritical reception[]\n\nResponses to his poetry[]\n\nThe initial critical response to Eliot's poetry, particularly \"The Waste Land,\" was mixed. Some critics, like Edmund Wilson, Conrad Aiken, and Gilbert Seldes thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets.\"[51] Nevertheless, it should be noted that Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to \"The Waste Land,\" Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\" [52]\n\nOther critics, like Charles Powell, were decidedly negative in their criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible. [53] And the writers of Time magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like \"The Waste Land\".[54] Of course, there were some critics, like John Crowe Ransom, who wrote mostly negative criticisms of Eliot's work but who also had some positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised \"The Waste Land\" for its \"extreme disconnection,\" Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work (like Powell) and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.[55]\n\nAddressing some of the common criticisms directed against \"The Waste Land\" at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight [to be] remarkably disconnected [and] confused ... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\" [56]\n\nAllegations of anti-Semitism[]\n\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of anti-Semitism. This case has been presented most forcefully in a 1996 study by Anthony Julius, T.S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form.[57][58] In \"Gerontion\", Eliot writes, in the voice of the poem's elderly narrator, \"And the Jew squats on the window sill, the owner [of my building],/ Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp.\"[59] Another well-known example appears in the poem, \"Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar.\" In this poem, Eliot wrote, \"The rats are underneath the piles./ The Jew is underneath the lot./ Money in furs.\" [60] Interpreting the line as an indirect comparison of Jews to rats, Julius writes, \"The anti-Semitism is unmistakable. It reaches out like a clear signal to the reader.\" Julius's viewpoint has been supported by literary critics such as Christopher Ricks, George Steiner, and James Fenton.[61]\n\nIn a series of lectures delivered at the University of Virginia in 1933, published under the title After Strange Gods: A Primer of Modern Heresy (1934), Eliot wrote of societal tradition and coherence: \"What is still more important [than cultural homogeneity] is unity of religious background, and reasons of race and religion combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable.\"[62] Eliot never re-published this book nor the lecture.[61]\n\nCraig Raine, in his books In Defence of T.S. Eliot (2001) and T.S. Eliot (2006), has sought to defend Eliot from the charge of anti-Semitism. Reviewing Raine's 2006 book, Paul Dean stated that he was not convinced by Raine's argument though he concluded, \"Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains.\"[61]\n\nRecognition[]\n\nA memorial tablet to Eliot was unveiled by his widow on 4 January 1967 in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey.[63]\n\nAwards[]\n\nOrder of Merit (awarded by King George VI] (United Kingdom, 1948)\n\nNobel Prize for Literature \"for his outstanding, pioneer contribution to present-day poetry\" (Stockholm, 1948)[4]\n\nOfficier de la Legion d'Honneur (1951)\n\nHanseatic Goethe Prize (Hamburg, 1955)\n\nDante Medal (Florence, 1959)\n\nCommandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, (1960)\n\nPresidential Medal of Freedom (1964)\n\n13 honorary doctorates (including Oxford, Cambridge, the Sorbonne, and Harvard)\n\nTony Award in 1950 for Best Play: Broadway production of The Cocktail Party.\n\nTwo posthumous Tony Awards (1983) for his poems used in the musical Cats\n\nEliot College of the University of Kent, England, is named after him\n\nCelebrated on commemorative postage stamps\n\nA star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame\n\nPublications[]\n\nPoetry[]\n\nPrufrock, and Other Observations.
