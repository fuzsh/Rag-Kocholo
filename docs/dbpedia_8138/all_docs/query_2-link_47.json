        "text": "Eliot continued his postgraduate study of Philosophy at Harvard. He travelled to France in 1910 to study at the Sorbonne in Paris. Baudelaire provided an influence in his evocation of sordid settings and urban issues. Eliot showed academic strengths and embarked on his PhD in Philosophy at Harvard.\n\nHe began to write poetry at this time. He had drafted ‘The Love Song of Alfred J Prufrock’ during 1910 and 1911. ‘Portrait of a Lady’, ‘Preludes’ and ‘Rhapsody on a Windy Night’ were also written during this period. Eliot attended Merton College, Oxford in order to complete his doctorate. He visited London and befriended poet Ezra Pound, who supported him in drafting his poetry and later assisted in the publication of Prufrock and other Observations. Eliot’s family were unhappy that he was neglecting his work on Philosophy. Eliot married Vivien Haigh-Wood, an English governess he met through a Harvard acquaintance. Their union was strained by Vivien’s poor physical and mental health and Eliot’s sense of obligation to her. His family disapproved of the marriage and he became estranged from relatives and his homeland.\n\n1915 was also a time of mourning for Eliot, as his close friend Jean Verdenal was killed in the war. The Eliots lived in the financial heart of England’s capital, the City of London, and witnessed bomb strikes. Eliot’s own poor health made him unsuitable for fighting. Eliot faced financial pressure and balanced early writing with caring for his wife and full-time work as a teacher. In 1916 he completed his doctoral dissertation, although he never received his PhD as he did not attend Harvard to defend and submit the work. He then worked in the Foreign Department in Lloyds Bank, where he remained for nine years.\n\nAlongside this employment, Eliot continued to write poetry and maintain literary interests, undertaking work as editor of The Egoist. Eliot wanted to enlist and support the war. He had attempted to join the US Navy, but was rejected on medical grounds. The poems collected in Prufrock and Other Observations combined the individual poetic voice of Prufrock with those of Burbank and Sweeney in the quatrain poems. The quatrains presented character types, heavily influenced by French writers such as Baudelaire. Eliot was deeply affected by the death of his father. It took a heavy toll on his health, as it coincided with the continuing breakdown of his marriage. Eliot tried to remain kind to his wife, although poems such as ‘Hysteria’ (1915) and ‘Ode’ (1918) allowed negative feelings to surface. ‘Gerontion’ is often read as a prelude to ‘The Waste Land’. ‘Gerontion’ could be read as the mind of Europe. The poem travels from the battle of Thermopylae (480 BCE) to the Treaty of Versailles (1919). Eliot recognises his allusions and thoughts as ‘houses within houses’.\n\nEliot saw links between violence and the collapse in common culture. He felt the loss of myth and criticised the loss of shared assumptions based on religion and philosophy. A bout of exhaustion from balancing writing, working and care commitments saw Eliot’s own mental health suffer. He felt himself on the verge of a nervous breakdown and took leave from the bank to recuperate at a sanatorium in Switzerland. Here he continued to work on ‘The Waste Land’, which he had started in 1919. Eliot was both a founder and editor of The Criterion.\n\n‘The Waste Land’ divided critics. Eliot himself felt this was a personal poem rather than a piece of cultural commentary. He described his work as ‘a piece of rhythmic grumbling’. A key feature of the work is parataxis, the juxtaposition of fragments. Eliot also won the Dial Award for his poem ‘The Waste Land’. This collection included the poem ‘The Hollow Men’. There was a movement towards God and the Church in this poem, with a sense that human and sexual love has failed. Eliot made references to Dante’s Divine Comedy, Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar and Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. The poem also incorporated the Gunpowder Plot.\n\nIn 1925, Eliot launched a successful career with the publishers Faber and Faber. He would remain with them throughout his lifetime. On the 29th June 1927, Eliot was confirmed into the Anglican faith. While the Church of England is a Protestant faith, Eliot’s beliefs could be regarded as ‘high’ Anglican; he described himself as an ‘Anglo-Catholic’. In November of the same year, Eliot was also naturalised as a British citizen, renouncing his American citizenship. As a poet, Eliot worked on the poems which come to be known as the Ariel poems between 1927 and 1930. ‘Ash Wednesday’ showed his spiritual struggle. The poem was personal and confessional, looking at the tension between birth and death. Eliot separated from Vivien. He did not want to divorce Vivien; instead, he prepared and filed a ‘Deed of Separation’. The couple now lived apart, with Eliot travelling to America to deliver Norton lectures at Harvard. These were published in 1933 as The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism."
