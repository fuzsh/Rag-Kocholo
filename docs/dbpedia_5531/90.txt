Le Roy Ladurie, Emmanuel. “Histoire et Climat.” Annales: Économies, Sociétés, Civilisations 14, no. 1 (1959): 3–34. doi:10.3406/ahess.1959.2795.

The French historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie has published material on the relation between human history and climate change, among a vast array of other subjects, ever since this article appeared in the history journal Annales in 1959. Within a decade he had completed his pioneering work of medieval and modern European climate history, Histoire du climat depuis l’an mil, translated as Times of Feast, Times of Famine: A History of Climate since the year 1000. Upon turning 80 in 2009, the third volume of his Histoire humaine et comparée du climat was published, taking Le Roy Ladurie’s coverage up to the present.
