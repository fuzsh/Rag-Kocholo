        "text": "In the second year, a system of double majors is offered. 4 choices are offered:\n\nHistory & Philosophy + Education\n\nHistory & Philosophy + Environmental Economics\n\nEducation + Economics\n\nEducation + Law\n\nCourses are mainly taught at PSL's component institutions, in particular Ecole Normale Supérieure - PSL, Dauphine - PSL, and Mines Paris - PSL. Students have access to a course chosen by professors at the Collège de France and to the UROP (Undergraduate research opportunity program).\n\nThe Science track is intended for students interested in the exact sciences (mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science and biology), and who want to study these scientific subjects in more depth before making an informed choice about their studies in the second year.\n\nTeaching takes place at Lycée Henri-IV and, for practicums in Optics, at the Paris Observatory – PSL Meudon site, with courses taught by faculty and teachers of preparatory classes for Grandes Écoles.\n\nDownload the first-year program\n\nThe academic year is made up of a core curriculum (basic mathematics, logic, algorithmics, environmental history, research project and one course chosen from those offered by the other tracks) and one major, either \"Mathematics\" or \"Experimental Sciences\".\n\nExperimental Sciences Major\n\nMultidisciplinary major in chemistry, physics and biology.\n\nMathematics Major\n\n2 possible minors: Economics (joint course with the economics major in the Economy, society and Law track) or physics (joint course with the experimental sciences major)\n\nIt is also possible to choose a cross-curriculum double major: Mathematics + Economics.\n\nCourses take place mainly at Mines Paris - PSL and at ENS - PSL (Jourdan Campus). The Observatoire de Paris - PSL hosts CPES Science students for practicums in optics. Courses in modern languages and economics are the same as for students in the Economy, society and Law track.\n\nAt the end of each semester one week is set aside for students to come together:\n\n- in the first semester, they work together in small groups in artistic workshops (around 20 hours) joining up with schools of art and creation associated with PSL, including FEMIS.\n\n- in the second semester, they participate in a robotics workshop.\n\nDuring the second semester, students also spend 60 hours on their first laboratory research project. The project is supervised by faculty and researchers and an oral presentation must be given before a jury at the end of the year.\n\nExamples of projects: Life sciences: morphogenesis and microscopy - Institut Fresnel (Marseille). Logistic maps and chaos – Department of mathematics, ENS - PSL. Low-voltage electrical machine for an embedded application, ENS Paris-Saclay Laboratoire SATIE. Study and modeling of earthquakes – Department of geology, ENS - PSL. Comparison of data from the Mars mission, Science Laboratory at Mars Climate Database - Dynamic Meteorology Laboratory, Sorbonne University site. Expression of Hr78 in the establishment of cell processes during metamorphosis of the notum in Drosophila - Institut Curie. Electrophoretic characterization and application of quantum dots functionalized with metallophtalocyanines.\n\nDownload the second year program.\n\nIn the third year, students continue with their specialization, choosing one from two, but maintain their spirit of openness by selecting a combination of options from different tracks.\n\nStudents also complete an individual research project, supervised by a faculty member, they must produce a project report and give a presentation at the end of the year.\n\nThe third year is also the time for students to consider the direction they will take \"after CPES\". The Director of the track and faculty members support students with the various procedures and help them prepare their application packages for a Master’s degree (in France or abroad) or for admission to an Engineering school.\n\nMathematics Specialization\n\n4 tracks are offered: Mathematics – Computer Science, Mathematics - Physics, Economics-Finance-Actuarial Science, Advanced Mathematics, combined with the Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics at Dauphine - PSL where classes are held.\n\nStudents in CPES 3 Mathematics enroll in parallel in the Bachelor’s degree course at Dauphine - PSL and, if successful, they obtain two diplomas at the end of the year.\n\nExperimental Sciences Specialization\n\nSpecialist courses for Physics, Chemistry and Biology take place at Mines Paris - PSL, ENS - PSL, ESPCI Paris - PSL, Chimie Paris - PSL and at the Observatoire de Paris - PSL. Every semester, a week is set aside at all 3 PSL engineering schools, to enable students to choose some introductory or advanced courses from a wide choice of subjects. These courses are initially reserved for students from the 3 engineering schools and are taught in different institutions. This provides the opportunity to get to know other schools and mix with all kinds of student.\n\nComputer Science Specialization\n\nThe \"Computer Science\" specialization is combined with the IM2D Track (Computer Science and Mathematics for Decision and Data), part of the Bachelor’s degree in Organizational Computer Science at Dauphine - PSL (where classes are held). Students who choose the Computer Science specialization therefore enroll in parallel in the Bachelor’s degree in Organizational Computer Science and the IM2D track at Dauphine - PSL and, if successful, they obtain two diplomas at the end of the year. The aim of this specialization is to introduce students to the problems of computer and scientific processing of massive data, machine learning, theoretical computer science and scientific analysis of decision problems using formal models.\n\n- Download the third-year program – Mathematics Specialization\n\n- Download the third-year program – Experimental Science Specialization\n\n- Download the third-year program – Computer Science Specialization\n\nIn the third year, compulsory courses take place at Dauphine - PSL. Depending on the choices made in the second year, different specializations are possible: Economics and society, Sociology and political science, and Law and public governance:\n\nEconomics and Society: this specialization has the largest economics component and includes extra mathematics as it is preparing students to go on to the top Master’s degrees in Economics. It also includes social science courses;\n\nSociology and Political Science: this specialization includes a wealth of courses offering an extensive knowledge of the different components of the social sciences, combined with in-depth training in methodology, and notably in field surveys. The variety of options provide a diversity that will ensure a wide range of choices at Master’s degree level;\n\nLaw and Public Governance: this is a demanding legal course giving students a high level of competence in Law, the start of a specialization in Public Law and a decidedly multidisciplinary profile, preparing them for a university program then professional activity linked to or interacting with public or quasi-public spheres.\n\nStudents in Economics and in Sociology and Political Science produce an individual research project supervised by a faculty member, which must then be the subject of an oral presentation. Law students participate in the Clinique juridique de Dauphine - PSL. Finally, the optional Media and Journalism Certificate offered by the Institut Pratique du Journalisme, Dauphine – PSL introduces students to the journalism professions."
