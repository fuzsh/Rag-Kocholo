        "text": "This paper takes as its starting point the fact that Bourdieu's views on sociology as a science have not been sufficiently and adequately understood and discussed. It traces the links between his conception and that of the French tradition of historical epistemology which is critical of positivism. How Bourdieu extends their views, and those of Bachelard especially, beyond the realm of the natural sciences, to the social sciences and sociology in particular, is discussed. In the process he introduces new concepts and methods, such as that of participant objectivation. His perspective reveals a convergence between the natural sciences and the social sciences as human endeavours striving for universal truths. This is reinforced and widened to include the humanities as well as demonstrated by his analysis of the literary field. The paper concludes with the observation that Bourdieu's post-positivist science is a salutary alternative to the postmodern critique of science.\n\nOn the State is a surprising gift, a reverence, and an act of love. It is difficult to imagine a text – not least one of such dense and consequential intellectual substance – that could better manifest and illustrate the ‘spirit’ and ethos of Pierre Bourdieu – his personality, his thought, his practice, and his very awareness of how they operated in the cognitive and social processes of sociological exploration and public communication. Because it showcases Bourdieusian epistemology in practice and in action so to speak, On the State is a beautiful, intelligent tribute to Bourdieu. Simultaneously, by allowing the full (theoretical and praxical) expression of Bourdieu’s reflexive science-in-the-making, the editors have also mediated Bourdieu’s own tribute to sociology – the underdog, the non-glamorous, lowly science, the science of the everyday humble and mundane, here deployed, in all its earthly self-consciousness, on the jealously guarded turf of political philosophers.\n\nThis article locates Bourdieu’s sociology within the lasting controversy concerning the nature of causal explanation and interpretative understanding in the social sciences, with a special focus on the classical problem surrounding the alleged (in)compatibility between these procedures. First, it is argued that Bourdieu’s praxeological and relational perspective on the social universe leads him not only to join the ‘compatibility field’ of the debate, but to sustain, more radically, the identity between explanation and understanding. Second, the article defends the view that this methodological proposal is tied to a distinction often ignored among the commentators of Bourdieu’s oeuvre, namely that between objectivism, a mode of knowledge of the social which he intends to integrate and overcome in his structural praxeology, and determinism, adopted by the author as a fundamental scientific principle and, at the same time, a potentially emancipatory ethicopolitical tool bequeathed by his reflexive sociology. While basically sympathetic to Bourdieu’s perspective, the article concludes in a more critical vein, by defending the need to bridge the gap between the ‘pessimism of the intellect’ that marks his portrayal of the reflexive capabilities of the lay agent, on the one hand, and the ‘optimism of the will’infused in the critical program of reflexive sociology, on the other.\n\nPierre Bourdieu died in Paris on the 23 of January 2002. He left some 40 book-length essays and over 200 articles. Unpublished texts are being brought out en masse, and much more is to come. Even before his death, sociology textbooks presented his genetic structuralism (which he sometimes also called structuralist constructivism in opposition to Bloor’s or Latour’s relativist constructivism ) as “one of the most significant [sociologies] to appear in France after the war.” 2 Despite the fact that textbooks and sociology courses cannot avoid mentioning Bourdieu, and that the public at large is in general favourably inclined towards him, the scientific community is increasingly divided. On one hand, his faithful French-speaking followers maintain that his theory is a genuine “symbolic revolution, a new way to perceive the social world.” 3 On the other hand, we have those he used to call his most “fervent enemies.” J. Verdes-Leroux, one of his earliest followers, contends today that Pi...\n\nBy the late 1990s, Pierre Bourdieu had become the primary public intellectual of major social scientific status at the head of the anti-globalization movement that emerged in France and in other Western European countries. This article discusses how Bourdieu became a leading public intellectual, a role that seems to contrast with his early years as a professional sociologist. It explores what seemed to change in Bourdieu’s activities and outlook as sociologist and what seems to have remained constant. It identifies several institutional conditions that seemed necessary for Bourdieu to be able to play the kind of public intellectual role he did in his later years. Bourdieu’s movement from a peripheral position to a central location in the French intellectual field, the changing character of the field itself, the growing influence of the mass media in French political and cultural life, the failures of the French Socialists in power, a cultural legacy of leading critical intellectuals in France, a unifying national issue of globalization, and the political conjuncture in 1995 all intersected in ways that opened a path for Bourdieu to choose new and more frequent forms of political action. His responses to that combination of factors at different moments reveal both a striking continuity in desire to preserve the autonomy of intellectual life and a change in view and strategy on how best to do that. The article concludes with a brief evaluation of Bourdieu’s public intellectual role."
