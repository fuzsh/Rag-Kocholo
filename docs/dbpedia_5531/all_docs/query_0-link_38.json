Mary Whitney, Claire Shindler, Nancy Stone, and LaRue Brion each typed parts of the manuscript. The latter's skillful management of the Master's Office at Branford College facilitated my completion of the manuscript. At Oxford University Press in New York, the manuscript benefited considerably from the careful editorial attention of Henry Krawitz and from the design work of Jack Harrison. Nancy Lane is a superbly talented and patient editor with whom it has been a great delight to work. Increasingly I have come to think of France's second city, Lyon, as its first. I have frequently enjoyed the hospitality of Yves Lequin, Maurice Garden, and their families, as well as of that transplanted Lyonnais, Roger Chartier. The T.G.V. has made these occasions even more frequent; the seminar at the Centre Pierre Leon at the Universite de Lyon II has been as stimulating as the city's restaurants and bouchons. In Paris, Edward Rohrbach, my friend for many years, Joe'lle Desparmet, and Monsieur and Madame Charles Bonis have welcomed me back each year. In Le Perreux-sur-Marne, Monsieur and Madame Daniel Taylor, Jean-Claude Petilon, and Dany and Diane Taylor have always made me feel at home. I have also appreciated the hospitality of Pierre Delaunay in Chambery.

Joan Scott, Gordon Wright, Jim McClain, and Edward Gargan offered helpful suggestions after reading a draft of the manuscript. Richard Cobb's work has influenced this book, particularly his essays, which evoke a \"sense of place.\" Susanna Barrows and Michael Burns have heard about much of this over countless comptoirs and tables, ranging from Troisgros and La Cremaillere to Le Ralleye, place Stalingrad, in Paris; Au bout du monde, near Chambery; La Bodega, A la galoche d'Aurillac, and the Tout va bien in Amboise (which we ended up calling the Ca va pas). Christopher Johnson and Ted Margadant, inspiring historians and confreres, carefully read the manuscript and offered useful suggestions.

They reflected and accentuated the concentration of capital, the expansion of commerce, and large-scale industrialization. The continued growth of the centralized, bureaucratic state, such fundamental changes in social organization as the development of voluntary associations, the bourgeoisie's rise to political dominance, an emerging factory proletariat, and the political challenge of ordinary people for power were all most clearly associated with urban areas. Recurrent revolutions—1830, 1848-51, and 1870-71—were one of the most telling indicators of these changes. The contest for national power was waged more noticeably in Paris, from which regime after regime fled. The rapid population growth of Paris accompanied the capital's increasing domination of the nation. Louis Chevalier's classic restatement of the \"uprooting hypothesis\" claims that unchecked migration flooded Paris with a second race of people, the marginal \"dangerous and laboring classes,\" who created a mood of criminality, if not outright revolution.1 One would expect Paris to have been the center of rebellion and revolution, though not necessarily for the reasons Chevalier enumerates: Recent work has demonstrated that it was organized workers, not the disorganized, who rebelled.2 But by the end of the century Paris had become more frequently a scene of nationalist demonstrations than left-wing insurgency. The social composition of the capital gradually changed as the rebuilding of Paris by Napoleon III and Eiaron Haussmann accentuated the emerging horizontal geography of class segregation in the Paris region; the \"red belt\" reflected the higher living costs in the center city as well as the location of more industry and workers on the periphery of the city. Limoges, not Paris, was la ville rouge in nineteenth-century France. Of all other cities, only smaller Narbonne was also at the forefront of every wave of\n\nxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nsocial and political conflict. The prominent place of Limoges in the radicalism of 1848 and the Second Republic was but one of the city's revolutionary awakenings; its tradition of militance stretched from 1830 to 1871, and despite the relatively dormant two decades that followed the Commune, it revived with the socialist municipality of the era of the belle epoque (1895-1905), when a convergence of everyday life and political conflict seemed to occur. In that latter year, strikes and violent demonstrations—captured in a series of fascinating photographs—again catapulted Limoges into the headlines. These strikes anticipated the widespread strike activity elsewhere in France during the next two years. Once more Limoges was depicted as la ville rouge. Why Limoges? The city grew rapidly, by French standards, during the century and became a center of industrial activity identified with its famous product, porcelain. But there were other burgeoning industrial towns and cities, urban centers whose changing forms of social organization and political activity encapsulated the dramatic process Agulhon has called \"the descent of politics toward the masses.\"3 Was there something specific about the experience of Limoges that provided continuity between the precocious working-class consciousness of 1848 and 1871 and the militancy of the fin de siecle that combined economic and political action, joining skilled and unskilled workers, men and women? A historian of the Paris Commune has called our attention to the importance of understanding the \"complex sociocultural milieu\" of the individual city, which can be defined by collective acquisitions that are at the same time technical (according to its dominant industries), historical, linguistic, or political—a particular mentality that is revealed at the deepest level of the lower classes and that also, in part, determines the capacity for action of its lower classes. In sum, the past thrusts itself into the present and becomes an important force in the creation of the popular community.4\n\nThus put, the individual city becomes something like the yeast that activates the dough provided by industrialization, the concentration of work, and the presence of an elite of skilled workers. A number of successful recent studies have helped identify those themes that should help us place the nineteenth-century city in the context of the changes that helped shape the twentieth century: the impact of urbanization and largescale industrialization on political life; the emergence of workers as contenders for power; the development of predominantly working-class neighborhoods, often on the periphery of cities; the relationship between city and country; the tensions between municipal governments and the centralized French state; and the interaction among urban form, planning, and political life. These studies—including those by Maurice Agulhon, Adeline Daumard, William Sewell, Jr., Joan W. Scott, Jeanne Gaillard, Ronald Aminzade, David Pinkney, Anthony Sutclifle, Rolande Trempe, and Michael Hanagan—all have focused on specific themes and/or cer-\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\ntain periods of time.5 Yves Lequin's pioneering study of the workers of the Lyonnais (1848-1914) is the most complete account of the regional concomitants of large-scale industrialization and the experience of the proletariat during the last half of the century.6 Yet, surprisingly, we still have no study of a single city encompassing the period from the end of the Old Regime until our century, that great period of economic, social, and political transformation. There is, for example, nothing comparable to the study of eighteenth-century Caen by Jean-Claude Perrot, or that of Lyon during the same period by Maurice Garden.7 Perhaps the emphasis on the economic, social, and political processes themselves has led us to de-emphasize the histories of individual nineteenth-century cities and to forget that no two are exactly alike. Early in the century the French humanistic geographers described the evolution of certain cities, concentrating on the functions of urban centers— administrative, commercial, industrial, military—but leaving out what arguably was the most important function of all for nineteenth-century cities: bringing ordinary people into political life.8 The \"new urban history\" of the late 1960s and early 1970s emphasized quantitative analysis of social mobility but usually ignored political life.9 Conventional labor history—and even some not so conventional works of significance—has relegated the individual city to little more than a stage, setting, or context.10 Other historians, eager to pinpoint the \"modernization\" of rural France by examining the impact of cities on the countryside, have ignored the fact that the conflict between old and new also took place within cities.11 I thus set out to study political life in Limoges (1815-1914) through at least five regimes. After conducting research in the Archives Nationales, the Archives du Ministere de la Guerre, the Bibliotheque Nationale, the Archives Departernentales de la Haute-Vienne, and the attic of the Limoges town hall, I needed an approach that would result in a book that avoided the diffuse nature of a French these, a format that would not be congenial for American publishers. Wanting to write an accessible book that might capture the essential dramas of a nineteenth-century city, I decided to follow several groups of people and neighborhoods throughout the century.12 I have therefore concentrated on the porcelain workers, the vanguard of the workers' movement, together with the butchers (and, to a lesser extent, the laundresses), juxtaposing the newer neighborhoods of the faubourgs with the traditional quarters of the ancient trades. I first became interested in the butchers in 1977. Their story represents, I think, the passing of much of traditional France during the century. The idea of using porcelain workers and butchers to illustrate how Limoges changed came to me when I learned of a brief confrontation, perhaps only seconds long, that occurred during the strikes of 1905, when a number of porcelain workers threatened the butchers' treasured statue of Notre-Dame-laFitie which still stands in the small square in front of the chapel of St. Aurelien\n\nThe chapel of St. Aurelien and the statue of Notre-Dame-la-Pitie\n\non the rue de la Boucherie. This was, as far as I can tell, the last such statue in the secularizing and socialist city. Two ways of looking at the world stood face to face. My inclination in writing history has been to combine the approaches of two kinds of historians Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie once called \"parachutists\" and \"truffle-hunters.\" I have been influenced by the work of Charles Tilly and that of Richard Cobb, who, despite quite different approaches and conclusions, are not so unlikely a combination: Both appreciate the way a city works, shaping the routines of ordinary people.13 I have tried to emphasize the dynamics of social change, as they would have been observed by a parachutist descending very, very slowly from the heavens over France, with the goal of unearthing the delicious truffles of the experience of real people (though, admittedly, those experiences themselves were not always so pleasing). In doing so, I have sought to weave both large-scale economic and social changes and ordinary people into an account that captured something of the texture of urban life. In order to tell a long story of a large city, I have chosen to highlight three critical periods: (1) the end of the Restoration and the Revolution of 1830; (2) the last years of the Second Empire and the \"terrible year\" of 1870-71, with the Franco-Prussian War and the attempt to declare a Commune in Limoges; and (3) the socialist municipality during the belle epoque (1895-1905). In each case I introduced Limoges in terms of a specific year: 1828, when an army officer visited the city for the purpose of accomplishing a reconnaissance militaire, that is, to prepare a plan for the defense of the city based upon a hypothetical attack; 1859, when a scientist from Poitiers visited Limoges at the height of the Second\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\nEmpire and was so impressed with its porcelain industry that he wrote an account of his impressions; and 1900, the turn of the century, when all France celebrated the universal exposition in Paris and all Limoges seemed to reflect upon the remarkable changes that had occurred. Each chapter of what might be called \"thick description,\" in which I have tried to enmesh the significant changes shaping the city, neighborhoods, and workers, is followed by a description and analysis of the succeeding political events. While not excluding the Revolution of 1848, I have concentrated on three other events that represented great moments in Limoges's history and that of France: the Revolution of 1830; the Commune; and the socialist municipality of 1895-1905, ending with the strikes of 1905. Given this strategy, I have had to rely upon some rather \"thin description\" for the intervening periods (especially the 18405 and 1880s), depending upon the next prise, or tranche to keep the reader up to date. I have left aside the interesting glove-making town of St. Junien, thirty kilometers to the west on the Vienne River, whose radicalism was greatly influenced by Limoges. Finally, I also emphasize the form and physical reality of the city, although I do not consider such related topics as the construction industry or patterns of building ownership. The growth of Limoges led to the creation of industrial faubourgs that remained inside the city limits instead of creating separately administered communes populated by workers outside the city. This meant that workers contended for political power within Limoges and not in a series of contiguous but separate communes like those found around Paris. Patterns of residence, street names, and iconography were all closely tied to the political evolution of Limoges. I have tried to integrate these, too, into a holistic study. I spent a considerable amount of time walking the streets of Limoges, convinced that \"the stones of the city\" are also historical artifacts from which the past leaps forward with the same effect as the names inscribed in the census of 1841, or in the rich police reports in the Archives Departementales. My relationship with Limoges has been long and occasionally ambivalent. I first went to the city as a doctoral student. After working in the Archives Nationales, I finally took the train to confront both the Archives Departementales and Limoges. Limoges has always had something of a bad reputation in France, one virtually made official by the use of the verb limoger, meaning to dismiss, fire, or cashier. If someone has been limoge—sent to Limoges—it is thought to be a disgrace. Naturally I was apprehensive about conducting my research in such a spot. Disembarking at the Gare des Benedictins, which immediately gave me a bad impression of the place, I crossed the Champ de Juillet and found a room for eleven francs a night at the Hotel-Restaurant d'Isly. At that time I was playing basketball for a team in Paris and commuted by train on the weekends, an escape to which I greatly looked forward. To save money I took the 11:25 P.M. train back Sundays from the Gare d'Austerlitz (with the help of a carte d'abonne-\n\nxviii\n\nIntroduction\n\nment, which made the trip half price); upon arrival at 3:30 A.M., I spent the rest of the night sleeping in the second-class waiting room to save money. Occasionally the guard would come by to poke me and the smattering of clochards finding some shelter in what was then a very breezy room. At about 5 A.M. trains started coming in, with each arrival marked by recorded bells, and \"Limoges, Limoges, changez ici pour Perigueux,\" or for \"Gueret and Montlucon, via St. Sulpice Lauriere.\" At about 8 A.M. I would sleepily take my bag to the hotel and then trundle up the avenue de la Liberation to the Archives, just below the place Denis Dussoubs on the rue des Combes. The rest of the week I stayed in the hotel, eating dinner in one of several restaurants—all of which were full of businessmen, each with a copy of Le Monde or, more often, France-Soir—at a single table facing the television. My first encounter with Limoges was interesting but not much fun. When I decided to write a book on nineteenth-century Limoges, friends told me that I must be a masochist, that such a state of mind might ultimately push me to a comparative study of Limoges and, say, Mulhouse, Agen, Angouleme, or some other similar place. I dreaded my return visits to Limoges. But a strange thing happened in 1978: I began to life Limoges despite its noted jroideur. I stopped referring to the city as \"horrible Limoges\" or even \"dreary Limoges.\" I looked forward to my return, although my visits were still very solitary. I think it was because I knew Limoges. And after Jean-Claude Peyronnet told me about the restaurant Marceau, I ate copiously and well. The year 1971 was the last time I slept in the railroad station. I finally settled upon the Hotel de Paris, also on the Champ de Juillet, where from the window in room number twenty I could see the sun rise over the Gare des Benedictins. As Cobb would say, it had all become familiar and reassuring once I had my routine down, and there is something to that. But there was more. I had begun to like Limoges at precisely the same time that the city seemed to rediscover and treasure its own past. Red signs went up under the standard Parisian blue and white street signs, proclaiming the street's former name; underneath the sign for the avenue de la Liberation (which reminds locals not of Charles de Gaulle but of the heroic resistance in the region during World War II) appeared another sign announcing that the street had previously been called the avenue de la Revolution, that of 1830. The city rediscovered the shabby houses of the rue de la Boucherie and stripped off some of the pitiful facades that had covered the old beams. It has since become something of a tourist attraction. Several antique shops and restaurants opened onto the street. Aided by an active group of local historians and the Societe archeologique et historique du Limousin, Limoges began to appreciate its past. One day I followed a demonstration organized by the C.G.T. on a route to the prefecture that demonstrators had taken in 1905. It was very exciting. The past came alive again.\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\nNotes 1. Louis Chevalier, Dangerous and Laboring Classes in Paris During the First Half of the Nineteenth Century (New York, 1973). 2.

He had been ordered to prepare a defense of the city in the event of an attack by any enemy of France. Like Arthur Young in 1787, he passed an ancient inn at a point called Maison Rouge, several kilometers above the town. Probably also like Young, the traveler found it an \"execrable\" place, with \"a beggarly account of a larder\" and, in any case, not far enough from Limoges to justify staying there. He continued on the road that the Limousin's most famous Intendant Turgot had made one of the sturdiest in France.1 The route rose and then descended, bordered by chestnut groves, meadows, and ponds, through a ring of hills and into an amphitheater-like setting, with the spires of St. Michel-des-Lions and St. Pierre-de-Queyroix visible in the distance. The infertile soil of the Limousin temporarily seemed more promising as the estate of the wealthy noble Pierre Hippolyte Martin de la Bastide appeared off to the left. As he passed the customs barrier (octroi) at Les Lacheres, small gardens lined the road. Beyond a large crucifix on the route de Paris, a few scattered houses, a former convent which served some sort of official function, a cavalry garrison, and two small porcelain factories represented the growth of a modest and even paved faubourg. The road ended at the circular place Dauphine; there a street led up a hill to the crowded cattle market at the place d'Ame. To the left a less well-kept road sloped down to a muddy field which appeared en pleine campagne.2 Unlike Borel de Bretizel, most of Limoges's visitors had commercial, not military, business in the town in 1828. Many took a room at La Boule d'or, where the carriages stopped just above the place Dauphine (the junior officer's less elegant lodgings awaited him elsewhere), and after resting from the bumpy journey they followed one of two streets that led to the commercial quarters of the city. Their destination might well be the rue Manigne or the rue Bane Leger, the\n\n4\n\nTHE RED CITY: LIMOGES AND THE FRENCH NINETEENTH CENTURY\n\nmost prosperous in the maze of twisting and hilly streets of the center city. Wagons rattling through the town invariably found their paths encumbered, but the traffic suggested that in 1828, despite a year of some economic and political uncertainty, Limoges was an active and prosperous commercial center. The officer's impressions of the southern approach to the city in 1828 were somewhat different, despite the similarities of the meadows, ponds, and chestnut groves on either side of the road. The first view of the city loomed more suddenly, after one passed through a hamlet of little more than ten or twelve buildings housing poor gardeners, weavers, and a few eager innkeepers and shopkeepers anticipating the arrival of weary travelers. As the road curved and ran down a rather steep slope, one beheld the old episcopal city, dominated by the Cathedral of St. Etienne on a hill, and, to the side, the bishop's palace, with manicured gardens sloping down toward the muddy banks of the Vienne River. At night la bonne compagnie could sometimes be seen chatting with the bishop and the prefect of Haute-Vienne.3 An old abbey graced one bend of the river. When the route de Toulouse entered a small faubourg, the soldier might have noticed some tired textile workers stretching their limbs in front of their houses or bargaining with the merchant who brought them work. From the Pont St. Martial several mills and a small textile factory were visible. Hefty washerwomen, dressed in black and sporting white coiffes, knelt at the water's edge and hauled piles of laundry up the steep hill in the shadow of the cathedral, pausing to nod in the direction of small statues of saints occupying niches in the walls of some buildings. On both sides of the river boatmen steered logs downstream to a landing (rameau) which jutted out from both banks, where the timbers gathered until workers loaded them onto the dock of Naveix. A few fished, although, like modern-day fishermen on the Seine, they never seemed to catch anything. Any traveler who had business in the episcopal city-—such as the priest in Balzac's Le Cure du village—walked along the river and up the hill. Throughout most of Limoges's history such travelers would have been entering two separate and fiercely independent walled cities which were often bitter enemies and once fought a war. Limoges was originally Lemovicum, a Gallo-Roman settlement first mentioned in the early second century A.D., near the bridge over the Vienne River where two Roman roads met. A period of decline culminated in the sack of the city by the Visigoths in the sixth century, and the population may not have recovered its earlier size until the early nineteenth century. Those who escaped formed a second settlement at a slightly higher elevation above the river. The new settlement became known as Civitas (Cite) and the bishop of Limoges enjoyed the rights of a sovereign. Sometime in the seventh century another town grew up around the tomb of Saint Martial, who, according to legend, had been martyred after converting some twenty thousand inhabitants of Limousin and Aquitaine to Christianity. This new settlement, known as the \"Chateau\"\n\nLife in a Restoration Town\n\n5\n\nafter the residence of its vicomte, included the abbey of St. Martial, three churches, several chapels, and a small hospice.4 Unlike the ecclesiastical Cite, the Chateau developed rapidly as a center of local commerce and artisanal industry. Its burghers jealously guarded their right of self-government against the encroachments of the vicomte and the abbot, electing twelve of their own consuls. They preferred to think of the Cite as nothing more than their faubourg. The Chateau had numerous public places which served as markets; the Cite had but two open places, both adjacent to the cathedral. The Cite, which encompassed four churches, four convents, and a monastery, grew much more slowly than its rival. In 1371, during the Hundred Years' War, the Prince of Wales destroyed the Cite and massacred three thousand of its inhabitants; the Chateau survived and prospered for having supported the English. Renowned for its enamels and silverwork during the Renaissance and favored by its location, Limoges developed into a major commercial center. At the town's three largest annual fairs Bordeaux wines were traded for iron and textiles from the north; spices and arms from the northeast were exchanged for oil and soap from the Midi; and eau-de-vie, salt, and spices from the west were bartered for hats made in the east. Commercial expansion pushed Limoges beyond the confines of its walled cities. In the seventeenth century several enterprising merchants defied municipal ordinances and set up businesses at major crossroads. A significant concentration of population developed between the two \"cities,\" and a small settlement survived near the ancient Pont St. Martial, where the first limougeauds had gathered many centuries earlier. But most of the life of Limoges went on within the walls of the two cities, whose houses ringed their respective hills. During this time Limoges was known as la ville rouge because of the red tiles of its roofs, the first sign that one is at least approaching the Midi. Some seventeenth- and eighteenth-century visitors stressed the Limousin's poverty and the unhealthy mien of its capital and inhabitants. One visitor found the streets \"quite narrow, with high houses and leaning roofs, which render this town extremely dark and very dirty.\" He estimated the population of Limoges at the end of the seventeenth century at approximately twenty-six hundred households (feux) or about fourteen thousand people.5 A series of eighteenth-century administrators improved the town in some respects. The intendants Aine, Tourny, and Orsay constructed exterior boulevards and gardens which ultimately bore their names. Turgot constructed the boulevards of Montmailler, Pyramide, College, Promenade, and Ste. Catherine, which ringed the Chateau. He ordered the cemetery moved outside the city limits and improved the water system in a town noted for its fountains, imposed restrictions on the disposal of waste and garbage, and regulated the keeping of animals in the city. In response to a report on Limoges by Turgot, a royal decree in 1775 noted some diminution in illness and epidemics thanks to the demolition of several walls, which now permitted \"a\n\n6\n\nTHE RED CITY: LIMOGES AND THE FRENCH NINETEENTH CENTURY\n\nfreer passage of air and sunshine.\" The king authorized further work in Limoges, \"where the population and industries are progressing,\" in the hope that the city \"will become more and more salubrious and at the same time more commodious if one can give its streets greater width and suitable direction.\" Turgot also organized a relatively large police force of thirty-seven and divided Limoges into six quarters, each under the authority of a bourgeois. Turgot used royal subsidies, taxes, loans, and contributions from subjects to widen and improve some streets. When the Chateau and Cite were officially joined in 1791, after the latter once proclaimed its independence at the time of the Revolution, Limoges had become a somewhat healthier town to inhabit than when it had drawn complaints from the royal official one hundred years earlier.6 Yet in 1828 Limoges remained a town with many vestiges of the Middle Ages. The Revolution and Empire brought war, social conflict, some violence, and virtually no urban progress. Limoges was still crowded, dark, and dirty. Its streets presented steep inclines that impeded traffic. Wagons that successfully negotiated the treacherous Pont St. Martial still confronted a formidable hill before reaching the central city. Almost all streets were quite narrow; the steep rue du Clocher, in the heart of the commercial quarter, was in some places no more than five meters wide; visitors to the rue de la Boucherie held their breath as they picked their way among the animal carcasses on a street that was no more than four to seven meters wide. The Annales de la Haute-Vienne, the town's newspaper, admitted that \"Limoges offers an image of disorder, an absence of all rules, policing, and planning.\" Our military observer noted, \"If one can find anything more disgusting than the houses of the countryside, it is the houses of Limoges itself,\" which were fabricated from wood and flimsy plaster, cob-covered with a dirty pebble dash, and capped by the gray tile by then typical of the Limousin.7 They seemed to tilt forward as if to meet above the street. Occasionally one collapsed because of erosion caused by underground water. Some of the houses recently commissioned for wealthier clients on the wider boulevards were more solidly constructed. Most houses lacked the barest sanitary facilities. Sewage still ran down small ditches cut into the middle of streets. Limoges's churches sometimes gave off a deathly stench because corpses were left unattended; in 1825 the prefect complained that the smell in St. Michel was so bad that the services could no longer be followed. Day laborers dumped their refuse randomly in other neighborhoods on the way to work. Their journeys could indeed be hazardous; one official complained in 1810 that \"at any moment one can see water and garbage being thrown from the windows. . . .\"8 The Abbessaille quarter, where laundresses and flotteurs de bois spoke a particularly difficult patois, offered a particularly appalling scene. In the center of the commercial city the butchers' quarter gave off a disgusting and overwhelming smell. And in the entre-deux-villes section a filthy stream into which tanners carelessly tossed animal parts gave off a similar stench.\n\nLIMOGES IN 1785 A. La Cite\n\nB. Le Chateau\n\nC. place Dauphine\n\nD. Cathedral of St. Etienne\n\n8\n\nTHE RED CITY: LIMOGES AND THE FRENCH NINETEENTH CENTURY\n\nThese ancient, crowded quarters were particularly susceptible to fire: The city had suffered six major conflagrations during the eighteenth century, the last in 1790, when the Manigne quarter burned to the ground. Several factors aggravated overcrowding within the city. Limoges's physical expansion during the eighteenth century had been constrained by royal decrees and by the survival of the town walls. The limited space between the two original cities had been quickly filled in. Church property occupied one fifth of the space of the Chateau, and the cathedral, bishop's palace and gardens dominated the Cite. Limoges's population growth during the first half of the nineteenth century, the fourth greatest rate of increase in France, compounded the serious overcrowding within the city limits, stimulating the growth of faubourgs and extending the physical limits of the city. The newer houses in the faubourgs stretching out from the place Dauphine and the place des Carmes were of a more \"rural\" type, with sloping roofs (a house for sale on the route d'Aixe in 1828 included a barn, a meadow, cultivatable land, and a garden).9 Spurred on by commercial and industrial growth, Limoges's population increased by one third in the first decades of the nineteenth century, reaching over 27,000 in 1831. By 1828 all but about 3,000 inhabitants lived in the nucleated settlement of the city, including the faubourgs. Net migration accounted for this population increase, as Limoges usually had an excess of deaths over births. Only during the three years beginning in 1820 were more people born in Limoges than died there. Between 1820 and 1831 the excess of deaths was 811, while the town's population increased by at least 2,078.10 The central city had reached its maximum density during the 1820s. Only the parish of St. Michel continued to grow because of the expansion of Limoges to the north. Excluding two sections whose populations swelled because of the presence of charitable institutions and a prison, the most densely settled quarters were those that had developed between the two old cities: the faubourg Boucherie (socalled because it has served as a crossing point, or bouche) and the area around the Hotel de Ville.11 There was little about Limoges to counteract these unfavorable impressions. Its inhabitants seem to have suffered from feelings of inferiority that visitors found quite justified. Even at its best, Limoges was the kind of city Stendhal claimed was \"peuples avec les ames du sous-prefecture.\"12 Despite the city fathers' attempt to convince the king that Limoges was \"a second Rome,\" the town had neither a public monument nor any imposing statue, aside from numerous minor religious artifacts and cumbersome stone crosses that blocked key intersections. Only one old private residence seemed noteworthy: The Minister of Justice Martignac recalled some pleasant memories of the maison Nivet, where Balzac once stayed; in a somewhat generous understatement, the great novelist termed it \"less grand and imposing than the Louvre and the Palais-Bourbon.\"13 Limoges applied to the king for the designation of bonne ville in 1821 and 1825, a title\n\nLife in a Restoration Town\n\n9\n\nthat could be affixed proudly to the town crest. The petitioners reminded Louis XVIII that the \"miraculous progress\" of commerce and industry in Limoges had increased revenues by 20 percent in the past ten years. However, each time Limoges was politely but firmly informed that the country already had a sufficient number of towns of this rank. As several of these towns were smaller, the municipal council believed Limoges had become \"a humiliating exception.\"14 Its academy had been eliminated in 1814 after a short and undistinguished existence; for a time it seemed that the royal court would be transferred elsewhere, which would have dealt an economic blow and resulted in a considerable loss of prestige. Limoges seemed to be a forgotten town. A local booster despaired that the town's elite merely imported the modes and styles of Paris, and the effect was \"similar to those light wines whose quality is diminished when they are transported.\" Even the dead seemed to suffer from having lived in Limoges, transported to the new cemetery in an awful wagon that resembled a dump cart more than a hearse.15 Yet the city fathers bristled at the idea that Limoges was a ville perdue; they took pride that \"religious tradition [was] conserved with care\" in \"Holy Limoges,\" whose people were known for their Christian charity. There were many signs of religiosity in Limoges in 1828. A large mission cross stood before the Church of St.-Michel-des-Lions; the revivalist missions of the Congregationalists were eagerly followed by the majority of the population. The gates of the city had once been placed under the protection of the Virgin Mary and saints, whose statues had been erected when the walls were torn down in the eighteenth century. Street corner niches sheltered about: two hundred statues of Mary (such as at a corner of the maison Nivet) and a variety of locally popular saints. The manner in which the saints were housed and even clothed indicated the wealth of the particular quarter. Each quarter celebrated the feast days of its patron saints. Notre-Dame-du-Pont, near the port of Naveix on the Vienne, was the object of a particularly lively cult. On the last Sunday of September the procession of the washerwomen (buandieres) was led by a tiny king and queen, children whose parents had purchased their \"titles\" at an auction. Once or twice a year the poor went from door to door asking for \"God's share\" of specially baked cakes. On their day the laundresses returned to their riverside quarter with wine poured into their bottles by their clients. And before the small chapel of St. Aurelien, in the butchers' quarter, stood the statue of Notre-Dame-la-Pitie, which had survived war, fire, and revolution.16 In 1789 Limoges boasted one cathedral, thirteen parish churches, two seminaries, and twenty-three abbeys and convents. One tenth of the town's twentyfour thousand inhabitants were religious personnel. Several churches, abbeys, and nine chapels did not survive the revolutionary period. The religious orders were dispersed by the revolution, and the male orders never returned.17 The Church of St. Martial, originally part of the abbey of the same name and the home of\n\n10\n\nTHE RED CITY: LIMOGES AND THE FRENCH NINETEENTH CENTURY\n\nseveral confraternities, was destroyed. The Convent of Providence became an army barracks, and that of the Cordeliers served as the warehouse of the entrepreneur Pouyat. The ancient abbey of the Benedictins served nicely as the regional prison. Clerics must have cringed when the purchaser of another convent divided up the space among a masonic lodge, a cafe, and a public bath! Yet religious faith seemed to be restored along with the monarchy. Despite the loss of its stained-glass windows and the heads of most of its statues, Limoges's unfinished and rather graceless cathedral was often full, although the wealthy were no longer able to secure their burial in its gloomy reaches. The Annales de la Haute-Vienne advertised brochures describing \"six months of the lives of the Saints of the Diocese of Limoges and all of the Limousin!\" and listed all of the ecclesiastics who had died during the year. Most associational life in the town was religiously inspired. Nowhere outside of the Midi did the religious confraternities have such a public role, where one could witness these long lines of poorly aligned men, processional crosses covered with banderoles made from the richest cloth, lanterns placed on the ends of sticks, this fantastic procession, an almost barbaric sight, this garb recalling the classic costume of magicians emerging from the shadows in China.18 J. J. Juge, a chronicler of his changing town, emphasized that both \"the great and the humble manifested an incredible zeal for their confraternities,\" meeting every Sunday. That of St. Martial was one of the most important; it had been credited with saving the relics of St. Martial from the Revolution. Reconstituted in 1806, membership was then limited to seventy-two men \"of an honest life and without reproach.\" The most exclusive confraternity was that of the Pelerins, whose members had undertaken a pilgrimage to St. Jacques de Compostelle in Galicia or to Rome. But the most visible confraternities were the seven associations of penitents.19 Limoges's penitents emerged in the religious fervor of the seventeenth century. The black penitents were founded by Bernard Bardon de Brun, a charitable limougeaud educated in Paris, who was known as the \"lawyer of the poor.\" He subsequently established the blue penitents, and they were followed by the white (1611), gray (1611), jeuille-morte (initiated by eight priests in 1615), and, later, the purple or red penitents (1661). As in much of France, the Limoges penitents stressed penance, devotion, and charitable works. However, they served an important social function as well; in the eighteenth century their fierce independence sometimes put them at loggerheads with the clergy. Each represented a distinct social group and distinguished itself from the others by the color of its belt, its own chapel, patron saint, feast days, and processions. The white penitents met on the first and third Sunday of each month, on any feast day associated with the Virgin Mary, and on selected other occasions to read the vespers of the Holy Virgin, psalms of penance, and the litanies of the saints. Their statutes re-\n\nLife in a Restoration Town\n\n11\n\nquired the frequent examination of conscience, the forgiveness of their enemies (usually other groups of penitents), works of spiritual and corporal misericorde, assistance at the funerals of their confreres, the study of the works of religion and the commandments, and visits to the sick, the poor, and prisoners. The feuillemorte penitents prayed morning and night and were forbidden to play cards or visit taverns. If temptation got the best of them, they were to present themselves to their rector or prior and hold a cross while flagellating themselves. Just how many actually knocked on their prior's door can never be known. The purple penitents undertook a special act of charity. Founded in 1661 when the black penitents refused to accompany one of their colleagues to his execution, the purple penitents accompanied the condemned man to the scaffold, passed the hat for his family, and offered prayers for his soul. They fell into official disgrace after what was probably their most charitable act, namely, helping a condemned man escape execution in 1743. But soon they were back in force each time the scaffold was erected on the place d'Aine.20 Religious processions brought the penitents and other confraternities together, at least temporarily, to march, usually barefoot, through the narrow streets from church to church. A child dressed in a sheepskin as St. John the Baptist led the white penitents; the purple penitents trotted out an entire troupe of apostles in the middle of their procession. In the eighteenth century most males of any means were members of a confraternity—an estimated twenty-five hundred in I750.21 The penitents survived the Revolution and the loss of several of their chapels, retaining many of the virtues and abuses that had characterized their life under the ancien regime. They fought to retain their traditional independence vis-a-vis the clergy and the municipality. Their pious and charitable function declined; they sought to outdo each other in their recruitment of members, processions, and prosperity. The Imperial Prefect Texier-Olivier reproached those members who left their homes and work to assist in religious ceremonies, burials, and processions, and then followed those good deeds with less ascetic trips to the cabarets of the city. He drew up some regulations intended to put the penitents under the watchful eye of the parish clergy.22 By 1828 the penitents probably had declined in number from the estimated 4,000 in 1804: The blue penitents had 140 to 150 members, the gray about 200, and the elite black penitents about 80. Their processions remained lively, although Bishop Prosper de Tournefort banned their boisterous dramas and ordered his clergy to lock them out of the churches if they became disorderly. But the town's other leading subjects were penitents. Though weakened in number, function, and perhaps even commitment, and occasionally mocked by a new generation who found them anachronistic, they still attested to the role of organized religion in the society, politics, and culture of Limoges.23 The religion of Limoges and the Limousin seemed a far cry from the dogmas\n\n12\n\nTHE RED CITY: LIMOGES AND THE FRENCH NINETEENTH CENTURY\n\nand rituals approved by the bishop. As in rural Haute-Vienne, the clergy often complained that religious practices bordered on superstition, if not idolatry. The cult of the saints and the \"magic fountains\" (including one on the outskirts of Limoges) was quite alive.24 Ordinary people in Limoges were more attached to the routines of organized religion—baptism, marriage, major festivals, and burial— than to dogma. The revivalist religious missions of 1827 and 1828 were \"closely followed by the faithful, rich and poor.\" If Bishop Prosper de Tournefort railed against the excesses of the confraternity and claimed that their behavior would not be tolerated in any other city, he was privately grateful that the appeal of traditional religion in Limoges was still strong. In 1828 the religious calendar dictated virtually all public events of significance. The septennial Ostensions, which had begun in 1519, lasted fifty days in the spring, from Quasimodo Sunday until Trinity Sunday. After the Paternoster at the final mass, a crowd of poor women came forward, as in the Old Regime, hoping for a cure for their sick children. The final processions included several thousand clergy, penitents, and other confraternity members, as well as children dressed as the Virgin Mary, apostles, martyrs, and saints. In September the confraternities marched in procession, together with the clergy, to the site of a former chapel on the plain of Montjovis, northwest of Limoges, the site of a miracle that occurred in 994-25 Other public ceremonies and celebrations were also inextricably linked to the Church. Te Deums and masses marked the birthdays of the king and his patron saint. A solemn funeral mass mourned the anniversary of the execution of Louis XVI on January 21. In 1821 the birth of the enfant du miracle following the assassination of his father, the Due de Berri, was commemorated by masses of thanks, the illumination of the city, artillery salvos (which always ensured a large crowd), gymnastic displays, fireworks, a horse race, a free theater performance, and various balls. A banquet was offered to 250 \"fathers of families, chosen among the most deserving and honest artisans.\" They humbly manifested submission and dependence while their superiors fulfilled the Christian duty of charity.26 One street, more than any other, guarded the traditions of the old Limoges. The rue de la Boucherie, the butchers' quarter, was one of the few neighborhoods still defined by a specific trade, although a corporative work structure and vestiges of a medieval town could be found elsewhere. A Bordeaux resident later recalled his visit to Limoges: I suddenly found myself in a street forming a horseshoe, humid, and closed tightly by relatively tall houses, which tried to hide their decay with a rather offensive whitewash. There I found only the exhalations of sweat and blood, a chaos of buildings, of muffled animal groans, and the hoarse moos of cattle; in the somber interior of the shops, nothing but ropes, hooks, and the dank smell of dead flesh . . . This was the rue de la Boucherie.27\n\nLife in a Restoration Town\n\n13\n\nThe junior army officer, ordered to prepare an imaginary defense of the city, had also wandered into the rue de la Boucherie. Here is how he described its inhabitants: [They] formed a type of corporation . . . and have nothing in common with the rest of the city; their clothes, their habits, the saints who protect them, their church, their language, indeed, everything is unique to them. They delight in the most excessive filth. Under no circumstances will they change their clothes . . . showing up at every gathering and public festival as though they were going off to the most disgusting tasks of their profession . . . even those people not ordinarily repelled stay far away.28\n\nSmall wonder that the butchers had been left alone to organize their own national guard unit. The butcher's community on the rue de la Boucherie was based on ties of trade, neighborhood, family, and religion, having remained virtually unchanged for centuries. It was first mentioned as a corporation in 1322 but was probably constituted in the eleventh or twelfth century; the butchers traced their confraternity back to 930 to 931. A document from 1234 noted two metiers, wholesale and retail. Four elected bayles, or syndics, who arbitrated disputes among butchers, were put under the surveillance of the consuls of the Chateau. An act of 1533 or 1535 confirmed their monopoly on meat slaughtered in the city. Three centuries later that monopoly, although legally ended by the Revolution, remained virtually intact. Unlike any other trade or occupation, the butchers paid their customs, or octroi, taxes on goods brought into the city and their tax for slaughtering animals by subscription, or abonnement, dividing the tax among master butchers of the corporation according to the volume of their business. Waging war on the itinerant sellers of meat, they protected their privileges.29 Only butchers, their families, and domestics lived on the rue de la Boucherie and the several tiny adjoining streets. There were six clans of butchers, as there had been at the end of the seventeenth century: Plainemaison (which dated as far back as 1344), Cibot (1362), Parot (1535), Pouret (1536), Malinvaud (1561), and Juge (1575). In 1828 there were fifty-eight heads of household, almost all of whom owned their own houses. Virtually all marriages were arranged within these families. Those children who did not marry remained in the household; single adults of both sexes were common.30 The Revolution only nominally ended the tradition of primogeniture on the rue de la Boucherie. Younger sons remained in the household, working for their elder brothers; when one married the daughter of another butcher (marriages within the ten branches of the Cibot were particularly common), they set up their household in the home of their father or eldest brother. Widows or daughters without brothers could inherit the family business, but as the butchers had many children, a male offspring was invariably available to assume the patriar-\n\n14\n\nTHE RED CITY: LIMOGES AND THE FRENCH NINETEENTH CENTURY\n\nchal role of his father. The absolute paternal authority passed from father to son was often a weighty charge indeed because of the butchers' legendary large families. One Cibot had twenty-three children and another sent sixteen into the crowded street; there were fourteen Malinvaud offspring in one family and fifteen in another. No one ever bothered to count cousins because almost everyone was related. The patriarch arranged each daughter's dowry and marriage and taught his sons the trade. The sons left the Congregationalists' school—if they went at all—at the age of twelve or thirteen, accompanying their fathers and brothers to the markets of the region. They also helped slaughter animals on the adjoining streets or at the back of the shop. The daughters worked at home under the direction of their mothers, who were responsible for the maintenance of these large households.31 In the nineteenth century as in the sixteenth, butchers went by traditional nicknames, which were necessary to differentiate the various Martials, Leonards, and Jeans; otherwise there would be a good number of butchers named Martial Malinvaud, Leonard Cibot, or Jean Parot in the community of five hundred people. The nicknames had their origins in personal habits, characteristics, or experiences, and, like the family business, were inherited. Martial Pouret dit 1'Abbe was pious; Frangois Cibot dit le Pape was also pious and perhaps bossy; ParotCherant was known for his high prices; Parot-Nez-Plat had a flat nose; Eloi Cibot pere dit Boiteux was lame, and his son inherited the name but presumably not the limp; Malinvaud-Mantoue had once been in the army and fought at the battle of that name in 1797; Cibot dit Maisonneuve had built a new house, or else one of his immediate predecessors had; Plainemaison dit Louis XVIII had once cried out \"Long Live Louis the Eighteenth!\" (which would have been fine except that it was at the height of the First Empire)—his son proudly carried the name long after the king had died. For others we can simply guess at their origins: Jean Pouret dit le Dragon; Barthelemy Pouret dit Jambon; Barthelemy Cibot aine dit Sans-quartier, and so on. When the butchers signed agreements with the town concerning the taxes they would pay, they often signed only their nicknames: Moissieux (the sufficient), Parpaillaud (from volage, fickle, flighty, or inconstant), Missard (qui fldne), Petit Monsieur, and so on.32 The only outsiders on the street (and often the only residents not born in Limoges) were the butchers' domestics. In the tradition of the corporation, they ate their meals with the family and were allowed to participate in the religious processions and festivals. They remained in the quarter until they married (never into the butchers' families), in exchange for their room, board, and a very small wage. A few worked as apprentices in the trade, but without any rights of inheritance or familial recognition in the neighborhood.33 Each night the patriarchs gathered at a corner to discuss—or, rather, to fix— prices, do business, and prepare for the next day's thirty-to-forty-kilometer foray to the markets of the region, such as that in Eymoutiers. Their dogs terrorized\n\nLife in a Restoration Town\n\n15\n\nthe adjoining streets, \"an imposing battalion, like their masters, when united.\"34 The butchers were fervently religious. Among the \"hacked and hanging pieces of meat, the glistening livers and salted hams, and the blue heads of dead cattle ... punctuated with large pools of blood, were niches sheltering pretty statues of saints or rich madonnas with azure coats starred with gold, before which burned religious lamps.\"35 Many of the houses had enclosed statues on the outside walls that were visible from the street. The life of the community centered, as it had for centuries, on the small chapel of St. Aurelien. St. Martial, the patron saint of Limoges, had been sent to the region by Saint Peter to convert the Gauls. Martyred, he was succeeded by St. Aurelien as bishop. Sometime early in their history as a corporation, the butchers chose Aurelien to be their patron saint. A chapel was constructed in either 1453 or 1475 (probably built where another had stood) on the rue Torto, or Torte, a twisting street on which the butchers had settled. The relics of St. Aurelien were lodged in this modest chapel, which had several beautiful vitraux. The upkeep of the chapel of St. Aurelien was the duty and originally the raison d'etre of the confraternity of St. Aurelien. The confraternity could not be distinguished from the corporation in terms of its members and leadership. The members treasured the statue of Notre-Dame-la-Pitie, which stood in the small place before the chapel, about twenty feet from the door. The butchers paid dearly to preserve the chapel during the Revolution. Two of the wealthiest butchers, Barthelemy Cibot and Maurice Malinvaud, purchased it as a bien national for thirty-five hundred francs on the eleventh of Germinal in the year III. Secretly they did so on behalf of the entire corporation of butchers, who also held on to the sacristy and a small adjoining building for another thousand francs. \"Woe to those who would be bold enough to violate the sanctuary that sheltered the venerated relics of St. Aurelien\" served warning to the Jacobin club of Limoges, which included only one butcher, le citoyen Audoin Malinvaud dit le Petit, who, the radicals assumed, gathered information for the butchers' corporation. In 1793 a mob killed the priest Chabrol not far from the rue de la Boucherie, but the chapel, its windows, the statue, the relics, and the corporation and confraternity of the butchers survived Limoges's Jacobins. While the statues of the cathedral were beheaded, the butchers heard mass in the dark in their chapel. Only during the Restoration did the chapel again become the legal property of the confraternity of butchers; the fifty-eight masters signed a notarized agreement to that effect in 1827, pledging to pay fifty centimes a month for its upkeep. Each male child's name continued to be inscribed in the register of the confraternity and two francs a year was paid in his name until he was old enough to pay the cotisation himself.36 Public processions were an integral part of the butchers' community life. They celebrated the feast day of St. Martial with the other confraternities of the city, marking their own fete du boeuf engraisse on February 24. Other feast days particularly dear to the confraternity of butchers were St. Joseph (March 19), St.\n\n16\n\nTHE RED CITY: LIMOGES AND THE FRENCH NINETEENTH CENTURY\n\nAnne (July 26), and, above all, St. Aurelien (on May 10 or the first Sunday after that date), when they finally changed their clothes, appearing in the saint's colors of white and green. They played a central part in the above-mentioned Ostensions, during which the remains of St. Martial and other saints were paraded about town in a procession involving a total of 292 relics in 92 reliquaries and 8 grand chdsses. The confraternity of butchers auctioned off to one of their own the right to carry the most precious relics, an honor that would cost as much as 100 francs. The butchers also escorted the bishop of Limoges, fired off their muskets during the final procession (in one case forcing the court to suspend testimony because of the noise), and entertained the clergy at a series of banquets. The butchers' wives maintained their own confraternity, Notre-Dame-des-Sept-Douleurs, and celebrated the feast day on the third Sunday of September, known locally as Notre-Dame-des-Petits-Ventres, by preparing steaming plates of tripe.37 The years of the Revolution had only further solidified the butchers' devotion to the monarchy and the royal family. The devoted clans still claimed a centuriesold right to escort princes of the blood into Limoges, a tradition that stretched back to the visit of Henry IV. Legend also has it that they once saved the life of this monarch, to whose memory they were particularly attached. When the Due d'Angouleme arrived in 1814 and again in 1815, the butchers greeted him at the town's outskirts in their finest processional garb. The first of these royal encounters proved somewhat embarrassing, as the butchers cried out \"A bas lou rats!\" (\"Down with the tax collectors!\"). The duke misunderstood their patois as \"A bas les rois!\" (\"Down with kings!\"), but the momentary crisis passed after some hurried explanations. In 1828 the Duchesse de Berry, the mother of the enfant du miracle, the Comte de Chambord, visited Limoges. The butchers rode out to meet her and were thus described: Mounted on their ponies, the butchers are identified by their blue outfits with yellow sleeves, the immense plume that crowns their shako, and especially the noisy acclamations with which they fill the air while brandishing swords which seem to have been borrowed from some panoply of the Middle Ages.38\n\nThe butchers, invited to the reception for the duchess, stood with the bishop of Limoges and the prefect, as well as the mayor, Monsieur Martin de la Bastide. The duchess agreed to visit the rue de la Boucherie, a decision she might later have regretted, the piety and loyalty of its inhabitants notwithstanding.39 Yet the relations between the corporation of butchers and Limoges's civil authorities were not always ideal, despite the almost mystical fervor with which the butchers embraced the political and religious ideals of the Restoration. For one thing, there were countless complaints—quite justified—about the appalling filth of the street. The butchers' stalls made the street virtually impassable. The unpaved rue de la Boucherie had only a ditch running down the center for drainage. The narrow streets, such as the rue Huchette and the rue Vigne-de-Fer, that\n\nLife in a Restoration Town\n\n17\n\nradiated from the rue de la Boucherie offered minimal space for killing animals. An ancient decree had proclaimed that slaughtering was to be done on the street so that buyers could see—undoubtedly more than they ever wanted—that they were getting fresh meat.40 Even more vexing for the butchers' neighbors in nearby quarters—especially for anyone walking in the direction in which the wind was blowing—was the utter, inescapable, putrid stench given out by the rue de la Boucherie. Particularly noxious were the older houses, toward the upper end of the street, where there was no division between the store area of the ground floor and the area where the butchers prepared and stored meat, animal parts, and skins. The upper reaches of the houses had space for the hanging of meat—often right over the street. The police only occasionally prosecuted a butcher for allowing chickens to run wild through the streets or for failing to sweep the front of his house at night. The municipal council first considered the construction of a slaughterhouse in 1825. Three years later they were still debating. The noble Martin de la Bastide limited himself to infrequent friendly reminders that tossing dead cows into the Vienne River was not in the best interests of the city. Police investigated complaints that butchers occasionally sold meat at false weights or unloaded spoiled meat on the public, but they took no serious steps. The only municipal decree had been issued in 1825, when the butchers, who had complained that they could not use the famous fountain of Aigoulene for their purposes, were told that during particularly hot weather they were to slaughter only when and where authorized. The butchers were faithful and prosperous political allies of the Bourbons if the need arose. Thirty-four were included on the 1834 list of those eligible to vote by virtue of taxes paid. Their considerable wealth included plots of grazing land in the city's hinterland. Four butchers, led by Cibot aine dit Sans-quartier, paid even more taxes than Dumont St. Priest, a young lawyer who went on to become the procureur general in Limoges.43 The butchers' declared fortunes represented, as everybody knew, but a part of their wealth, which was hoarded or used to purchase expensive chalices and religious trappings for their festivals and not invested in large chunks of the countryside and secondary residences. Imposing change on the rue de la Boucherie had never been easy. When the king sent an agent in the seventeenth century to check up on the butchers, the former was \"mistreated\" and sent on his way. In April 1814 they categorically refused to pay their taxes and recaptured prisoners seized by the tax officials and police. During the Restoration the corporation signed an agreement with the municipal administration. Their abonnement, set at fifty-eight thousand francs in 1816, rose to over sixty-five thousand francs in 1825; whereas the butchers complained that they were paying too much, particularly when meat consumption in the city fell, most limougeauds, particularly the police, believed that the butchers were amassing vast fortunes at the public's expense. The butchers insisted that\n\n18\n\nTHE RED CITY: LIMOGES AND THE FRENCH NINETEENTH CENTURY\n\nany rise in the abonnement would be reflected in the higher price of meat. They bitterly protested the octroi regulations, such as the hours the gates were closed. They opposed even minimal supervision of their corporation by the town authorities; the mayor had the right, dating back to an unknown time, to select the syndics of the corporation from a list of candidates elected by the master butchers.44 The Viraclaud, another old quarter, was largely identified with an equally ageless trade associated with the flesh, namely, prostitution. Hard times, leaving the poor without resources, increased the number of femmes publiques. Prostitution in Limoges was tolerated during the Restoration, although in principle it was limited to thirty local women. Should the number fall below thirty (which it never did), the available spot was to be filled by whichever outside \"applicant\" demonstrated the \"least offensive morals.\" In 1828 twenty-three houses of prostitution were in operation. Some were rooming houses that also accepted full-time lodgers with other occupations. Nine of these \"received all girls who wanted to be prostitutes.\" Forty-five women, despite the legal limit, worked the fourteen \"official\" houses. These houses were found primarily in Viraclaud, near the rue des Combes, particularly the rue Froment. Some were also cabarets, where \"drinkers sing and pass the night away.\" Soldiers were regular customers, including one who, in January 1828, tried to fight his way into a house with sword drawn.45 The policing of prostitution had but two goals in Limoges: to limit the number of prostitutes by sending away women who were not from the city and to prevent public scandal. Such scandals included prostitutes propositioning openly in the streets, attempting to lure minors into their lairs, or loud carousing into the night. In 1816 a fille en service was allowed to enter the municipal jail, where \"elle avail fort connaissance avec un condamne a six ans de reclusion.\" In this case only marriage could lessen the \"scandal\"; the prosecutor allowed them to marry before the prisoner was returned to a more chaste confinement.46 One prostitute was ordered out of town because of her \"conduite peu reservee,\" and when she returned without a passport, she was returned by the gendarmerie to her home in Benevent, in the Creuse.47 Complaints about Limoges's prostitutes were frequent. \"Nothing stops them,\" went one report, \"because they know all of the tricks necessary to reach their goal.\" In April 1827 the residents of the rue Froment bemoaned the \"scenes of disorder\" that troubled their rest night and day. They particularly cited one Verthou, called \"Red Nose,\" who employed six prostitutes in what her angry neighbors called \"her den of thieves.\" The prefect, Baron Coster, adopting a more rigorous policy than his predecessor, ordered some prostitutes returned to their villages and incarcerated those suffering from venereal disease in the depot de mendicite. He received a letter of thanks from one Madame Gossely for having rid Limoges of so many \"public women from outside of the city.\" She had more on her mind than the defense of public virtue; in particular, she was referring to the scandalous Souvaroux sisters from Gueret, who were wreaking havoc in many households, including her own.48\n\nLife in a Restoration Town\n\n19\n\nWho were the prostitutes of Limoges? In November 1824 forty-three femmes publiques were known to be working in the city. Of these twenty originally hailed from Limoges. The others all came from rural Haute-Vienne, the Creuse, the Correze, and one from the Dordogne. Those born outside Limoges were somewhat younger, averaging about twenty-five as compared to nearly thirty for the timougeaudes. Most did not bother to list any other occupation, but four claimed to be seamstresses, three day laborers, two spinners, and one each a tailor, merchant, braider, and ink maker. Those born outside of Limoges had spent an average of 8.4 years in the city. They had come in their late teens or early twenties, perhaps after becoming pregnant in their communes. Marie Tricaud, twentysix in 1824, was born in the small textile town of Felletin, in the Creuse. She arrived in Limoges in 1814, claiming some skill as a seamstress. She had spent most of the time since then in a maison de tolerance on the rue Froment. An \"outsider,\" she was ordered to leave the town and was handed a passport with a fixed itinerary to lead her back to the Creuse. But Marie did not leave, or else she soon returned, as did most of the others. Framcoise Lafond, twenty-one in 1824, had arrived from the Charente in 1821 without any trade. Like many of her fellow prostitutes, she gave no permanent address, continuing to live in the depot de mendicite because she had venereal disease. Louise Ester, the oldest registered prostitute at forty-six, had apparently reached the end of the line. She had come to Limoges from Meymac, in the Correze, in 1808. Since that time her name had turned up in a police register for having \"led a youth to debauchery.\" Now she lived on the rue du Cheval Blanc with what was diagnosed as an incurable case of venereal disease. The doctors refused to see her anymore. Arrested during the cold night of December 18, 1828, for being on the street after 10 P.M., she had nowhere else to go. Here we lose any trace of her, but we must assume that she did not have much time left. Marie Versavaud, called Claris, had arrived in Limoges from Chalus in 1814 at the age of sixteen. She now lived on the rue des Trepasses and was \"sometimes given to madness.\" In 1824 the recently arrived and ambitious Prefect Baron Coster ordered most of the \"outsiders\" to be returned to their own communes. One self-proclaimed day laborer from Negrondes, in the Dordogne, was told to sell her belongings by the end of the month; another was given a reprieve when the banns of her marriage were suddenly posted. Most of those who were not incarcerated returned home, or possibly never left. Several remained under legal surveillance, undoubtedly because they had committed crimes. Others escaped the census because they were sans domicile fixe, worked only part time, or stayed in the city only briefly. Prostitution remained rather effectively limited to several streets. The Restoration government tolerated and, to some extent, even indirectly protected the local talent against outside competition. The municipal government was much more concerned with control of the spread of disease than with prostitution per se, and took steps to force the \"public women\" to be inspected twice monthly by a doctor at the depot\n\n2O\n\nTHE RED CITY: LIMOGES AND THE FRENCH NINETEENTH CENTURY\n\nde mendicite. For example, in September 1818 the femme Adelaide refused to see the doctor, claiming no obligation because she saw her own clients at home. The prefect threatened to put her, together with sixty other women, in the depot de mendicite if she refused to cooperate.49 The police saw prostitution, then, as part of the evil in the world, interfering only when public order or decency seemed gravely menaced. During the first years of the reign of Charles X the number of prostitutes increased along with the growth of the urban population and the small garrison. Local authorities returned to a limited policy of containment, perhaps because the economic crisis and political events came to occupy more of their time. Work left little time, opportunity, or need for the development of literacy. The Haute-Vienne trailed virtually every department throughout most of the century in the percentage of literacy. Even to the departmental General Council it seemed that \"Haute-Vienne lags behind civilization, and the rapid movement that has advanced it in other regions is hardly felt there beyond the walls of the town.\" A military observer's less generous explanation was that \"the intellectual facilities of the Limousins are hardly precocious.\" Prefect de Casteja had found his charges \"little adapted to the culture of reading\" in 1819. Indeed, 123 of the department's 200 communes had no schoolteacher during the Restoration. Only slightly more than half of the men (an estimated 55 percent in 1825-26 as compared to about 31 percent in the year VI) and only a little more than a quarter (about 27 percent in the year VI) of the women were literate.50 Illiteracy and the use of patois were specific characteristics of le peuple, half of whom had migrated from Limoges's backward hinterland. The royal college enrolled about 325 students, of whom 125 were boarders. A small seminary disappeared in the late 1820s. Boys in Limoges could attend any of three schools, two of which were run by the Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul. In addition, Limoges boasted about thirty or forty private school teachers or tutors and a number of charitable institutions for young girls and orphans. But most children of workers entered the work force at a young age and could not attend school. Exceptions included the sons of the artistes en porcelaine, including turners and moulders, whose skills in reading and writing further distanced them from the mass of the working population.51 The 1820s were years of fairly stable prices and gradually rising wages. In 1819 the prefect claimed that \"abundance is everywhere; the worker lives without effort, and three days of work are largely sufficient for the necessary expenses of the week.\" The average worker in the city earned somewhat more than 1.70 francs per day. One local historian has classified the workers according to, on the one hand, those who were \"happy\" (heureux), earning between 2.50 and 8 francs a day (the latter figure attained only by a few artistes en porcelaine), or average workers who took home between 1.75 and 2.50 francs; and, on the other, the \"un-\n\nLife in a Restoration Town\n\n21\n\nhappy\" laborers, who earned less than the daily average wage. The latter included day laborers, dyers, workers in the kaolin mills, and women in any industry. Children brought home only a fraction of the wages of an adult male worker, but this additional income often contributed to the survival of the household.52 Approximately 60 percent of a worker's family budget was set aside for the purchase of food, and the majority of that for bread alone. This was rarely bread of the first quality, usually rye bread. Rents were relatively low, accounting for somewhere between 7 and 12 percent of the budget; another 10 to 12 percent was spent on heat and light. Approximately 7 percent paid for clothes, of which most workers had two sets (winter and summer), made from the coarse cloths produced in the city. Rye bread was a staple, with buckwheat prepared as pancakes {gaieties) cooked in grease or served with milk and chestnuts. The workers' diet included potatoes, lard soups, and cabbage and turnips soaked with rye bread (brejaude). Meat seldom appeared on the workers' tables, although the raising of animals was such an important regional industry that the level of meat consumption may have been higher than in other relatively poor regions. Pore gras sale, for example, was common, but chicken and local fish were less so. Water remained the principal drink, although some of the justly inexpensive local wines produced in Aixe, Verneuil, and Isle (which turned to vinegar after a short time) were consumed. Beer and cider remained luxuries.53 Just what we know about prices and wages, which rose slightly, would suggest that the worker and his family could have survived rather easily in Limoges during the Restoration. However, wage rates, when they can be determined, are not: a reliable indicator of the standard of living because of the perpetual problems-— for the historian as well as for the worker-—of unemployment and underemployment. The porcelain industry, which had the widest scale of wages and paid its skilled workers well, is a good case in point; the industry had its own morte saison, when inventory was taken, and was subject to relatively sudden plunges in demand. The level of wages reflects only payment during the time the worker was employed. Furthermore, most skilled workers in the industry had to pay for their tools and materials, as well as supply the wages of those who assisted them in their task. The turners, molders, and decorators were paid by the piece, but had the cost of the fente—damages to products or breakage that had occurred during the process of production, particularly during baking—subtracted from their wages. This tradition reduced their real wages and was bitterly resisted and, later, contested.54 Furthermore, Limoges's industries and, consequently, its workers were particularly vulnerable to years of crisis. The margin of economic survival remained narrow in the first half of the century. Personal disaster (such as an accident or an untimely pregnancy) could push a person or an entire family across the line between \"getting by\" and misery.55 A harvest failure, which invariably brought a\n\n22\n\nTHE RED CITY: LIMOGES AND THE FRENCH NINETEENTH CENTURY\n\ncommercial and industrial crisis in its wake, could have ruinous consequences. Skilled turners and molders, and even decorators, were vulnerable because a decline in demand left them without work. However, most workers benefited from fairly stable prices during the Restoration. For example, the price of beef was about 80 centimes per kilo from 1820 through 1837; the Price of potatoes, a staple, rose sharply only during the first years of the Restoration and again in 1824, falling back to normal levels in following years. But the threat of agricultural crisis still loomed. Two major crises of the Restoration dramatically drove up the prices of bread, the staple of the poor: one in 1816-17 (and, to a lesser extent, 1818) and another in 1828-29, the effects of which were still being felt in 1830. These crises arrived slightly later and remained longer than in some regions. The price of wheat, 18.25 francs per hectoliter in 1815, rose to 30.50 during the terrible year 1816, before falling back to between 14 and 17 francs from 1821 to 1827. Thus, first-quality bread rose from 33 centimes a kilo in 1815 to 70 centimes briefly in 1817; the price fell to between 27 and 32 centimes between 1821 and early 1828, when prices again rose sharply, although never again to the 1816-17 level.56 An economic slump affected the bulk of the city's population. Workers with virtually no income to spend left shopkeepers with overstocked shelves and artisans without customers. Large numbers of the poor became dependent upon private and (public charity; a flood of impoverished campagnards arrived. The municipal council voted sums for public works projects and sometimes sent people to other regions to buy grain. The bishop and the prefect discussed how the needs of the worthy poor could be met, if at all. Priests drew up lists of the \"deserving\" poor who were known to be religious and might qualify for some charity from the ladies of the city. The death rate rose, as did the number of abandoned children taken in by the kindly but overburdened Sisters of St. Alexis. During hard times some workers returned to the countryside to look for work and live with relatives. How different were their trips to the environs from the excursions of the elite to their country estates! We can catch only glimpses of the culture of poverty in Limoges. Le peuple limousin were considered \"gapers,\" loving impromptu performers, clowns, storytellers, puppets, and charlatans, all of whom were \"always surrounded by a numerous and absolutely attentive crowd.\" Workers, like the peasants of the region, enjoyed cards and drink—the latter sometimes to excess—although in general both were known for their reserve and \"resignation.\" They could be extremely sentimental, as one prefect attested: \"It is not difficult to bring these good people to tears. Upon hearing of a tragic event or listening to a touching ballad or song, even the largest gathering will suddenly burst into tears. Woe to those who conserve dry eyes—it will be said that they are heartless.\"57 Le peuple enjoyed the religious festivals of their city, region, and of their corporation or trade. They en-\n\nLife in a Restoration Town\n\n23\n\njoyed the annual markets and fairs that brought the smallish, long-haired, fiercelooking Limousin peasants, as well as merchants from other regions, to town. Public order was easily maintained in Limoges. Occasionally the police interrupted a charivari: for example, a noisy crowd of three hundred who serenaded a woman who had just been married for the third time—in this case the new groom stormed out of the house and snatched away one of the offending musical instruments; or another involving young men from \"les meilleures maisons de Limoges\" following a theater performance in 1820.58 Only one major incident involving a crowd had posed a threat to public order in the Restoration, when les gens du peuple made their only collective appearance during the Restoration. In 1816 the price of grain rose sharply following a poor harvest. The price of rye reached twenty francs per hectoliter—twice the price it commanded in nearby St. Junien. Costly white bread reached forty-four centimes a kilo, leaping to seventy centimes the following year. The price of potatoes, a staple of the poor, almost doubled. While the municipal administration and the prefect commissioned merchants from the city to go to Orleans to buy grain for the Limoges market, rumors of hoarding spread.59 On June 18, 1816, several wagons filled with grain—purchased at a price the poor could not afford—left Limoges for Montauban. Some distance beyond the Pont St. Martial, they were stopped by a rnob of between three and four hundred people, mostly women. The police intervened and escorted the merchant, who lived in Limoges, to the hamlet of St. Lazare. But there another crowd intercepted his wagons at the cotton-spinning factory of Monsieur Constantin. This time they hurled rocks and damaged the wagon with a pitchfork. One of the women who was arrested explained simply that \"the driver was taking the grain out of the department.\" When news of the arrest of several women spread, a huge crowd gathered in protest at the prefecture; another woman was arrested for loudly making a \"seditious statement.\" The prefect posted a warning against hoarding; the police monitored the bakers' stock, which helped get more grain on the market, and the National Guard patrolled the streets night and day. The price of grain fell briefly, only to climb to record heights during the next year. But by 1828 these events had been long since forgotten. Officials and the town's leading citizens assumed that \"the people are incapable of reflecting wisely,\" but aside from the fear that they could \"be put up to something,\" they were not seen as a threat to public order in Limoges.60 Police duties therefore focused on assisting the octroi employees; watching the swarms of vagrants who descended upon the city in bad times or who arrived alone or in pairs in normal years; noting the arrival of travelers, particularly colporteurs, passing through the city; tracking army deserters; and breaking up drunken brawls between soldiers and civilians, or between rival compagnons. The police commissioners checked the registers of Limoges's hotels and numerous\n\n24\n\nTHE RED CITY: LIMOGES AND THE FRENCH NINETEENTH CENTURY\n\ninns, removed cadavers, and kept an eye on the city's cafes. Their duties also included overseeing \"workers' livrets and arresting prostitutes,\" the two being perceived as needing similar moral supervision. The Ministry of the Interior provided funds for undercover agents au niveau de peuple and occasionally in the prison, where security was notoriously lax and escapes not infrequent. But among the people there were no political plots to sniff out or political opposition to fathom.61 Nor was crime a great problem. Murders were exceptional events which dominated conversations for weeks, particularly when they were savage and gory. In December 1827 a peasant named Jean Doirat, who lived near Bellac, in the commune of St. Symphorien, hacked to death his wife, oldest daughter, and a neighbor with an ax, wounding several other people before he dove into a pond and drowned himself as the fire he had set consumed ten houses in his village. In 1828 there were only two reported murders in the entire department; one was sufficiently brutal to occupy the public's attention for weeks: A peasant woman beat a neighbor to death after he had chased her animals from his property. And early in December 1829 the body of an elderly priest was found some distance from Limoges on the road to Angouleme; he had defended himself bravely against four attackers, shooting one of them before he expired. Even though the killers were captured, many limougeauds remained terrified of the wooded area outside the city, even when another murder in the vicinity turned out to be a crime of passion involving infidelity and jealousy. Murders were rare events, almost as unusual as escaped circus bears killing children, which occurred once in the vicinity of St. Yrieix. Suicides were more common and were discussed in hushed tones: a domestic taking poison after discovering that she was pregnant; or the suicide of Laval dit Poiron, a noted local scoundrel in Limoges who claimed to have been one of the assassins of the Princesse de Lamballe during the Revolution, dealt in stolen merchandise, lived in sin, and sold the boulettes de poudre fulminante to the young anticlerical bourgeois who disrupted the missions in the spring of 1828. Thefts were considerably more common than murders, yet they were rare enough to receive much attention. Those apprehended for such crimes sometimes found themselves exposed and ridiculed at a public square. In 1824, for example, only three were reported in the entire month of September in the department of Haute-Vienne, and only four were recorded the previous April. Three attempted robberies in Limoges in April 1826 created a panic and even caused some people to lock their doors. But in December of that year only one theft in the city was reported. One had to be wary of pickpockets and confidence men at the annual fair of the Innocents (and even more so in May during the fair of St. Loup), particularly of colporteurs, who were suspect. The major theft in December 1828 turned out to be embarrassing for the police: Someone stole 160 francs from the\n\nLife in a Restoration Town\n\n25\n\npolice station during the night. More common were thefts from stores or shops by men \"who appeared to me to be Auvergnat.\"62 Most of the proces-verbaux of the police were citations of those who violated basic municipal regulations: shopkeepers, particularly bakers, who cheated on weight and quality; residents who let their animals run in the street, failed to sweep the frontage of their buildings each day, blocked traffic by leaving their wagons unattended, or dumped garbage in the street; wagon drivers who sped across the narrow bridges, occasionally killing helpless pedestrians; or shopkeepers who ostentatiously worked on Sunday. A part of the small fines resulting from such contraventions—usually one franc—went to the poor. Vagrants and prostitutes—at least those who failed to pass the obligatory medical inspection—were incarcerated at the depot de mendicite. Prisoners convicted of major crimes joined those convicts from four other departments at the maison centrals.63 But executions were rare. The esprit publique section of the daily police report had very little to say. At the end of 1822 the police commissioner reported that not one event of interest had occurred in Limoges. A seventeenth-century tourist once claimed that the people of Limoges were far more concerned with their commerce than with the care of their houses or even their bodies. Prefect de Casteja, arriving in the spring of 1819, thus characterized his administrative charges: \"The inhabitants of this department are distinguished by the shrewdness of their judgment, their calculating and practical minds, and a great aptitude for commercial operations.\"64 At least one lifetime resident found this taste for speculation offensive: While justly proud of the \"brilliant reputation\" of his city's commercial bourgeoisie, he worried that relative newcomers were tarnishing Limoges's once sterling reputation with their \"wild speculations\" and seemingly endless quest for new luxuries.65 In 1816 a \"friend of the king\" had written an anonymous denunciation of Limoges's deputy mayors; he complained that not only were they sans connaissances, but they were so preoccupied with their businesses that they neglected the affairs of Limoges. One of them, the textile merchant Muret de Bord, was recognized for \"infamous public conduct,\" perhaps inspired by his father, who, the secret detractor alleged, had enjoyed 190 mistresses. Some of Limoges's commercial leaders urged stricter codes and regulations to discourage unscrupulous commercial practices, but most prided themselves on the \"thrift, patience, energy, and good faith\" of the group of families and friends who dominated the commerce of the city.66 Limoges's geographic position had favored its development as a thriving commercial center for the exchange of goods from the North, East, and Midi, enriching the branches of the Pouyat and Petiniaud families, among others, who owned considerable property in the communes surrounding the city. Increasing octroi receipts reflected prosperity, jumping from 186,000 francs in 1812 to 220,000\n\n26\n\nTHE RED CITY: LIMOGES AND THE FRENCH NINETEENTH CENTURY\n\nfrancs per year during the period 1819-24, and rising to 252,000 francs in 1827. In 1818 ten merchants and two commercial transport entrepreneurs were among the leading censitaires of the city. Among municipal voters in 1834, sixty-eight wholesale merchants represented by far the second most common occupational category, behind proprietaires. Twenty-eight paid more than 300 francs, nineteen paid between 200 and 300, and twenty-one paid between 100 and 200. Their houses on the rues Manigne and Haute-Vienne were among the most elegant in Limoges.67 But if Limoges lived by commerce, much of it was retail. In 1819 the prefect estimated that at least two thousand of the approximately twenty-five hundred buildings in Limoges housed boutiques, stores, or small workshops on the ground floor. Limoges's merchants sold a wide variety of products, ranging from staples and rugged, locally produced clothing for the poor to colonial products by way of Bordeaux, luxury articles de Paris, and even \"fresh\" oysters available each day (though one may doubt how fresh they could have been after the long, jolting, and dusty journey from the coast). The shops on the rues Haut and Bas Lansecot greeted peasants arriving to buy the products of the urban market. \"There, nothing is spared to seduce them, to tempt the variety of villagers, and bring about the extremely painful separation of the peasant and his money.\"68 Yet in 1819 the prefect de Casteja had been struck by a marked shift in the economy of Limoges. It was not just salon conversations that convinced him that some of the capital which had been used to finance wholesale commerce was now going into the manufacture of Limoges's two most noteworthy products, textiles and porcelain. One could see ever-increasing quantities of wood being hauled up from the Vienne River to fuel the porcelain kilns. The settlements across the river were alive with domestic textile production; several small factories along the Vienne were busier than they had ever been. Country people were coming to Limoges in ever greater numbers in the hope of finding better-paying jobs. Furthermore, Limoges's manufacturers began to send their own representatives to other towns and markets. Thus, the number of wealthy commercial transport entrepreneurs declined from seventeen in 1817 to seven at the time of the Revolution of 1830. Wholesale commerce (particularly of woolens) seemed to be losing out to competitors in the North and Midi. The fall onslaught of Auvergnats \"selling whatever they can in warmer areas\" was thus resented. But, at the same time, the preeminence of the porcelain manufacturers Alluaud, Baignol, and Tharaud, all of whom had begun as skilled turners in the "
