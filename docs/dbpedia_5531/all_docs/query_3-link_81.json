        "text": "Paris Sciences et Lettres University (PSL University or PSL) is a public research university located in central Paris, France. Established in 2010 and formally created as a university in 2019, PSL is a collegiate university with 11 constituent schools, with the oldest one founded in 1530. It offers Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD diplomas for its constituent schools and institutes. PSL provides an education based on research and interdisciplinary instruction, and its 17,000 students have access to a broad range of disciplines in science, engineering, humanities, social sciences, fine art, and performing arts.\n\nPSL is ranked among the top 50 universities globally and the top 5 young universities under 50 years old in the Shanghai (ARWU), THE (Times Higher Education), CWUR, and QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) rankings. PSL has nine component institutions, two associate members, and works closely with three research organizations. The university draws on the scientific strengths of all its institutions to offer its communities unprecedented opportunities in the fields of education, research, valorization, national and international industrial or academic partnerships.\n\nPSL is home to 28 Nobel laureates, 11 Fields Medalists, 3 Abel Prize laureates, 50 César Awards, and 79 Molière Awards. It represents nearly 10% of French research and has more than 150 ERCs since its creation. Its academic community leverages the potential of its 140 laboratories to build nearly twenty interdisciplinary graduate programs and many other major programs involving its institutions.\n\nPSL University is a French institution of higher education and research located in the Latin Quarter of Paris. The idea of the university came about in 2004 when institutions in the Latin Quarter began thinking of how to join forces to boost their international visibility. The French law on research promulgated in 2006 paved the way for new projects such as Paris Universitas, PRES ParisTech, and an early version of the PSL project.\n\nThe new organization combined five institutions of higher education in the Latin Quarter, including Chimie ParisTech, Collège de France, École normale supérieure (Paris), École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la ville de Paris (ESPCI Paris), and Observatoire de Paris. Together, they adopted the status of a scientific cooperation foundation (FCS). The new entity, called \"Paris Sciences et Lettres – Quartier Latin,\" was initially conceived as a scientific alliance.\n\nIn 2011, the five institutions submitted a joint application for the Initiatives for Excellence (IDEX) as part of France's Investing for the Future program (PIA), causing the project to evolve into a new form of French university. This university would have 70% of its students at the Master's and PhD level and offer a Bachelor's program, with an emphasis on equal opportunity students.\n\nPSL University is a French institution of higher education and research located in the Latin Quarter of Paris.

This university would have 70% of its students at the Master's and PhD level and offer a Bachelor's program, with an emphasis on equal opportunity students.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2012, ten new institutions joined the foundation, including Conservatoire National Supérieur d'Art Dramatique, Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris, École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs, École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, La Fémis, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes Foundation for Research, Institut Curie, Institut Louis-Bachelier, MINES ParisTech, and Université Paris-Dauphine. Their arrival reinforced PSL's scientific potential in the fields of engineering, biology, the arts, and management.\n\nIn 2014, four institutions specializing in humanities and social science joined the association: École Française d'Extrême-Orient, École des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), École Nationale des Chartes, and École Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE).\n\nIn 2015, PSL organized itself into a university community (ComUE: PSL Research University). PSL began awarding PhDs at that point.\n\nIn 2017, after a detailed review process, nine institutions agreed to put in place an integrated budget and a multi-year strategy for academic recruitment, as well as to create a number of shared platforms and services. Chimie ParisTech, École Nationale des Chartes, École Normale Supérieure, École Pratique des Hautes Etudes, ESPCI Paris, Institut Curie, Observatoire de Paris, MINES ParisTech, and Université Paris-Dauphine decided to jointly form Université PSL. The agreement approved by their respective boards calls for the schools and institutions that form the university to adopt a unified strategy, to submit to the budgetary authority of the president of the university, to jointly plan their recruitment, and to transfer the whole of their diplomas to PSL.\n\nIn 2019, PSL officially became a university, offering Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD programs, with over 20,000 students and 4,500 faculty members. PSL also has 11 research institutes and 51 research teams, and its students and faculty have received numerous prestigious awards and honors. The university continues to prioritize research excellence, international collaborations, and diversity and inclusivity in its mission."
