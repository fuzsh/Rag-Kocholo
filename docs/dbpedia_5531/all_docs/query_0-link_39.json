The same applies to social or cultural anthropology. In the late sixties and early seventies several prominent anthropologists and social theorists were conﬁdently predicting the end of anthropology. How wrong they were! Anthropology is thriving. If one understands the story told by all the articles in this volume one can appreciate some of the reasons why this might be. It is because of the engrossing and crucial questions anthropologists ask and the way they approach them. The editors of this volume were intrigued when Routledge asked them to edit a volume on ﬁfty key anthropologists. What or who is signiﬁcant? One is reminded of the famous quote attributed to Mao when a French journalist asked him what he thought was the signiﬁcance of the French Revolution and he replied that it was too soon to tell! The issue then is problematic: what exactly constitutes a key thinker in anthropology? When, where, and for whom is such a distinction recognized? When we discussed the notion of ﬁfty key thinkers with colleagues, there was an interesting consensus about the top twenty or thirty individuals. Beyond that point there was less of a consensus, although certain names did recur with frequency despite the fact that we and our colleagues represent a variety of traditions and theoretical orientations. The three editors teach in Canada and the United States, but one of us was born in England, another in what is now Namibia, and a third in the Bronx, New York. In the past three or four decades we have witnessed some convergence of national traditions in anthropology which were formerly more distinct. This is not merely because many anthropologists have moved back and forth across the Atlantic. Rather it may reﬂect the worldwide problems of postcolonialism, gender and class inequalities, globalization in production, consumption, ideology, and religion. These realities aﬀect the way we do our ﬁeldwork and they also aﬀect the way we view our own past and our predecessors. xviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe writers we discuss are now part of a variegated hybrid tradition in anglophone anthropology. We actually selected ﬁfty-one people, because John and Jean Comaroﬀ often work as a team. Twenty-ﬁve of them are American, six are French, one is Swedish, another Norwegian, and the remainder come from or have taught in diﬀerent parts of the British Commonwealth, including ﬁve South Africans, one Indian, a New Zealander, and eleven British. In fact the picture is more complicated. Franz Boas was born in Germany, Bronislaw Malinowski and Paul Radin were born in Poland, and Robert Lowie and Eric Wolf were born in Austria. Victor Turner, A. R. RadcliﬀeBrown, Bronislaw Malinowski, Paul Radin, the Comaroﬀs, Mary Douglas, Fredrik Barth, F. G. Bailey, Rodney Needham, and Claude Lévi-Strauss taught or researched for substantial periods on both sides of the Atlantic and also in other parts of the world. At least eighteen of our group were or are Jewish, although few of them were devout. While only nine of the ﬁfty-one are women, this is a higher number than one would ﬁnd in most disciplines over a similar time frame. We have included six French nationals in our group, because French anthropology has had a major impact on anthropology everywhere in this new century and the last one, and elements of it have been thoroughly incorporated into anglophone anthropology. Our contributors reﬂect a similar range and diversity, coming as they do, apart from the United States and Britain, from Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Switzerland, and South Africa. In debating and discussions about whom one should include in a list of key anthropologists we have opted for a group broadly representative of the diverse movements and currents in the world of socio-cultural anthropology. Certain names are almost synonymous with important theoretical movements, such as Malinowski with functionalism, Lévi-Strauss with structuralism, and Marvin Harris with cultural materialism. Many of them, but not all, taught at major universities where they trained graduate students who became leading ﬁgures in their own right. Some of our group never received the recognition their work deserved during their lifetime. This was especially true of Arnold van Gennep and Zora Neale Hurston. Whatever the case, they have been true to the discipline. Already in 1910 A. C. Haddon, the pioneer English anthropologist, observed that anthropology thrived on controversies because it was an anarchical subject advocating views which frequently challenged both Church and State. The signiﬁcance of some of our key thinkers depends on an ability to forge original ideas that can be used by other scholars. xix\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSometimes their inﬂuence may transcend the bounds of anthropology. This has been true of Hurston in literature, folklore, and Afro-American studies, of Lévi-Strauss and Geertz throughout the Arts and Social Sciences, of Turner in religious and drama studies, of Douglas in religious studies and organizational studies, of Rubin in gender studies, queer and poststructural theory, and of Appadurai in cultural studies. Edward Tylor once wrote that ‘anthropology is a reformer’s science.’ Anthropology indeed has a reputation as a radical discipline, but the scholars included in this collection represent a variety of political perspectives. The centrality of ﬁeldwork has tended to imbue anthropologists with a concern for subject peoples, though they have diﬀered in the way this was expressed. A central problematic for the discipline has been the attempt to deﬁne an appropriate response to ‘otherness’ and subjection. The articles in this book are written for students and teachers of anthropology as well as lay people who wish to understand a little more about social anthropology. For readers wishing to further explore our ﬁfty key anthropologists, as well as the many others who have made important contributions to the discipline, there are several valuable sources including the excellent Biographical Dictionary of Anthropology, edited by Vered Amit, Routledge, New York (2004). Other useful sources include the University of Wisconsin’s series on the History of Anthropology, founded by George Stocking and currently edited by Richard Handler, and the University of Nebraska’s series, Critical Studies in the History of Anthropology, edited by Regna Darnell and Stephen Murray. Regna Darnell also edits the journal Histories of Anthropology Annual, published by the University of Nebraska Press. The quarterly History of Anthropology Newsletter, edited by Henrika Kuklick, contains much useful information and a regularly updated bibliography. Books which can be consulted include Henrika Kuklick’s The Savage Within (1991, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) and her excellent, recently edited A New History of Anthropology (2008, Malden, MA: Wiley Blackwell). Adam Kuper’s readable Anthropology and Anthropologists: The Modern British School has been republished in several revised editions, most recently in 1996 (London: Routledge). Marvin Harris’s Rise of Anthropological Theory is an informative but opinionated classic (1968, NewYork: T. Crowell). Thomas Hylland Eriksen and Finn Sivert Nielsen’s A History of Anthropology is a concise insightful book written from an Scandinavian perspective (2001, London: Pluto). Sydel Silverman’s Totems and Teachers is a collection of longer essays xx\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nby well known scholars about the famous anthropologists who taught them.

He initially came to the United States after attending Elphinstone College in Mumbai, earning his BA from Brandeis University in 1970 and then obtaining his MA (1973) and PhD (1976) from the University of Chicago. As a student at Chicago he worked closely with both anthropologists and historians at the innovative and interdisciplinary Committee on Social Thought. His geographic area of focus from then till now has been South Asia, and during his graduate studies he worked closely with renowned scholars of South Asia including the anthropologist, Bernard Cohn. He went on to teach and do research in Anthropology departments at the University of Pennsylvania, University of Chicago, and Yale University between 1979 and 2003. He then became the Provost and the John Dewey Distinguished Professor of Social Sciences at the New School of Social Research. As of January 2009 he became the Goddard Professor of Media, Culture and Communication at New York University. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the recipient of numerous scholarly fellowships and awards. The personal and intellectual impact of both his experiences as an immigrant and his interdisciplinary training are revealed consistently throughout Appadurai’s fecund intellectual career. His scholarly publications on India have traversed various cultural terrains, including religion, colonialism, agriculture, cuisine, public culture, and urbanization. His earliest intellectual project was to question the tendency to characterize South Asian culture as static rather than exploring the importance of change to this region. His ﬁrst book, Worship and Conﬂict under Colonial Rule: a South Asian Case (1981), a revision of his dissertation, was a ﬁne-grained study of a South Asian Hindu temple, Sri Partasarati Svami Temple, a Sri Vaisnava shrine. Using a speciﬁc place of worship as his ﬁeld-site, Appadurai combined archival and ethnographic methodologies to re-examine assumptions in both anthropology and history as to what deﬁnes ‘traditional’ Hindu worship practices. Appadurai has committed himself to question and re-examine received wisdom regarding the best and most appropriate ways to investigate the material and symbolic organization of social life. This commitment is readily apparent in a special issue of Cultural Anthropology edited by Appadurai called ‘Place and Voice in Anthropological Theory’ (1988). Here Appadurai questioned the tendency of academic disciplines to rely on certain ‘territories of 3\n\nARJUN APPADURAI (1948–)\n\nknowledge’ to demarcate social reality in particular ways, thus shaping conceptual and theoretical frameworks and ultimately the organization of the disciplines themselves. Other essays that reconsider how the geography of South Asia has been anthropologically traversed, relying on certain gateway concepts, include ‘Center and Periphery in Anthropological Theory’ (1986a) and ‘Is Homo Hierarchicus?’ (1986b). His introductory essay in The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective (1986) re-examines the notion of a commodity by considering the process by which value becomes attached to things. Appadurai proposed that commodities themselves, as much as or more than the larger exchange systems within which any individual commodity is embedded, have powerful stories to tell about social organization. These stories can not be well documented unless multiple disciplinary perspectives are embraced. A theory of the social life of things became a powerful tool for analyzing the social and material conditions involved in exchange systems. This essay as well as the edited volume has been widely used in anthropology, history, and other allied disciplines. He has continued to publish essays interrogating the epistemological and ontological foundations of disciplinary knowledge in the social sciences, focusing on the discipline of anthropology and the geographic region of South Asia. Recent examples include ‘The Geography of Canonicity’ (1993), ‘Diversity and Disciplinarity as Cultural Artifacts’ (1996a), and ‘Grassroots Globalization and the Research Imagination’ (2000a). By the late 1980s Appadurai also began to incorporate theories of migration and globalization into his scholarship, further moving his thinking away from the classical anthropological strategy of linking a geographic locale with a bounded community and culture. The ﬂuidity of symbolic and material life, both across time and through space, which had been articulated in The Social Life of Things, moved to the center of his scholarly work. In collaboration with his late wife, the historian Carol Breckenridge, he commenced a new intellectual project on the notion of ‘public culture,’ that was a novel recasting of former, spatially demarcated deﬁnitions of culture, a necessary task given the increasingly economically and culturally connected social realities of modernity. With public culture, groups of people can share values, beliefs, and practices (for example relationships to mass media) but not share a geographic locale. In 1988 they founded the renowned scholarly journal Public Culture which created a forum for scholars interested in pursuing the construction and 4\n\nARJUN APPADURAI (1948–)\n\nmovement of cultural ideas, practices, and formations across national, linguistic, class, race, and gender boundaries. Although Appadurai’s published record on globalization and public culture is notable, he has also been heavily involved in creating intellectual environments for other scholars to further explore interdisciplinary projects on culture and globalization, ﬁrst with the journal, and subsequently as the founding director of the Chicago Humanities Institute at the University of Chicago and as director of the Center for Cities and Globalization at Yale University. The book Modernity at Large, Cultural Dimensions of Globalization, ﬁrst published in 1996, compiled his scholarship on culture and globalization, creating new analytic frameworks for understanding all manner of endeavors, including watching television, playing cricket, and counting people. In this collection, Appadurai addressed debates in social theory as to the possibilities of human agency in the face of social and economic constraints, particularly consumer capitalism, examining closely the role of mass media in creating new globalized arenas for values, practices, and beliefs. His view was generally optimistic: ‘consumption in the contemporary world is often a form of drudgery, part of the capitalist civilizing process. Nevertheless, where there is consumption there is pleasure, and where there is pleasure there is agency’ (1996b: 7). For Appadurai, anthropologists must address the role of consumption in modern societies, deploying the ethnographic gaze to focus on the role of consumption practices in people’s everyday lives. At the same time, his analysis of economic forms of consumption is mediated by his investment in the power of symbols and signs in people’s everyday lives. The essay, ‘Disjuncture and Diﬀerence in the Global Cultural Economy,’ reprinted in Modernity at Large, was particularly inﬂuential because Appadurai, among the ﬁrst anthropologists to problematize the concept of culture in the context of globalization, created a case for future scholarship focusing on what he deﬁned as global cultural ﬂows. He called for scholars to look at what he calls disjunctures in the global system, with a focus on landscapes based not on territories but rather on ‘perspectival constructs.’ These are: ethnoscapes, mediascapes, technoscapes, ﬁnancescapes, and ideoscapes. For example, members of a given ethnic group may form distinctive enclaves or temporary communities throughout the world as immigrants, guest workers, refugees, tourists, and businessmen (global ethnoscapes). The environmental movement spreads to many diﬀerent cultures, adapting to each environment (global ideoscapes). Television and computers have taken over the world, but the technologies and media products have 5\n\nARJUN APPADURAI (1948–)\n\nto some degree been indigenized (global technoscapes and mediascapes). The focus on such constructs, Appadurai argues, allows scholars to identify the emergence of an integration of material and symbolic actions, now global in scope but still culturally inﬂected. His own theoretical perspective works to more fully reconcile the economic system of capitalism into the emerging academic corpus connecting all aspects of globalization by fully engaging material conditions with systems of meaning. Recently Appadurai has extended his commitment to creating communal intellectual spaces to understand globalization by investing in research that involves greater civic engagement. He is the founder of the non-proﬁt PUKAR (Partners for Urban Knowledge, Action, and Research) in Mumbai. He is also the co-founder and co-director of ING (Interdisciplinary Network on Globalization). His current research focuses on the eﬀects of globalization, particularly in the South Asian context, by looking at ethnic violence, urbanization, and new forms of grass-roots activism. The recently published Fear of Small Numbers: An Essay on the Geography of Anger (2006) chieﬂy concentrates on the connection between globalization and contemporary ethnic conﬂicts. Appadurai has always embraced anthropological preoccupations as powerful ways of informing understandings of the human experience. For example, he has recently discussed the importance of the discipline’s long engagement with magic, which he deﬁnes as ‘what people throughout the world do when faced with uncertainty, catastrophic damage, injustice, illness, suﬀering or harm.’ He then calls it a ‘universal feeling that what we see and feel exceeds our knowledge, our understanding and our control,’ a universal feeling that has allowed, for example, Americans to accept certain banking practices that could be seen as magical (Immanent Frame, November 2008). In an interview, Appadurai uses Mary Douglas’s seminal ideas in Purity and Danger to help explain modern tensions between the middle classes in Bombay and their slum-dwelling neighbors (Perspecta34, ‘The Illusion of Permanence,’ June 2003.) Appadurai’s version of navigating ‘traditional’ and ‘modern’ ideas within the discipline of anthropology created exciting new intellectual paths. His ideas helped shape the anthropological research of many scholars and students, leading to contemporary ethnographic inquiries considering movement, imagination, consumption, and media in the contemporary construction of culture. As Appadurai asserts in Modernity at Large, ‘I view locality as primarily relational and contextual rather than as scalar or spatial’ (1996b: 178). His eﬀorts to articulate 6\n\nARJUN APPADURAI (1948–)\n\nand elucidate this alternative deﬁnition of place, geography, and culture, as well as the implications for individuals, communities, and the formation of knowledge, has allowed several generations of anthropologists to cross intellectual boundaries and discover new scholarly frontiers just as many thought that world had, once again, become ﬂat.

BAILEY (1924–) Not many scholars have the audacious foresight to launch their careers with a research program rather than a research project. From 1952 through 1959 Bailey focused on a set of inter-related problems and topics in India resulting in three splendid monographs. In addition he published a further ﬁfteen books and forty scholarly papers, almost all of them concerned with political anthropology. His work can be divided into three categories: the early Indian phase, his theoretical volumes, and his eventual turn towards anthropology at home (Britain and the United States). His Indian monographs should be treated as a trinity, because together they constitute a comprehensive portrait of political activity in one part of the country. The second category also includes three books, but the focus here will be entirely on one of them, Stratagems and Spoils (1969). This is because it was the capstone study in an intellectual movement which provided the discipline with a new perspective. Several of Bailey’s books published in the 1970s and 1980s reﬂect his interest in his own society, especially formal organizations. Morality and Expediency (1977) is representative, because it was his ﬁrst full-scale monograph in the genre, and because it represented anthropology at home: an analytic examination of political interaction in universities. Frederick George Bailey was born into a lower-middle-class family in Liverpool and went to Oxford to study Classics on an Open Scholarship in 1942, but left the following year to join the British Army. After the War he returned to Oxford, leaving with the degrees of MA and BLitt in 1950. He then enrolled for a doctorate 8\n\nFREDERICK G. BAILEY (1924–)\n\nin social anthropology under Max Gluckman at Manchester University and received his PhD in 1955. After teaching at the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies he moved in 1964 to found the anthropology program at the University of Sussex. He accepted a Professorship at the University of California at San Diego in 1971, where as Emeritus Professor he continues to write books at a pace that leaves younger colleagues breathless. Work in India The Indian research program focused ﬁrst on a village, then on a region, and ﬁnally on the modern system of representative democracy. Along the way tribe, caste, the mercantile economy introduced by British colonialism, and the administrative machinery of the modern state were treated as interdependent but contradictory political structures generating signiﬁcant social change. Caste and the Economic Frontier (1957) is a study of Bisipara, a village located in an isolated and poverty-stricken part of Orissa state. Bisipara was home to about 700 Oriya-speaking Hindus whose forebears had settled in the area some 300 years earlier. Bailey’s focus was on the impact of external factors on political activity in the village, particularly the caste system. His rich ethnography enabled him to explain how the encroaching mercantile economy aﬀected the capacity of peasants to retain control and ownership of their land, and how two Untouchable Distiller castes were able to gain suﬃcient wealth to become prominent landowners themselves, which led to their attempts to elevate their positions in the caste hierarchy. Tribe, Caste and Nation (1960) dealt with a village of about 500 people less than an hour’s walk from Bisipara, called Baderi. Both villages were dependent on irrigated rice cultivation for subsistence, but otherwise were quite diﬀerent. Bisipara was a multi-caste settlement. Baderi was dominated by a single caste called Konds, formerly labelled Animists or Tribalists, who spoke the Kui language. Unlike Bisipara, the fulcrum of political action and social change in Baderi was not the village, but instead the dispersed clan system. Presumably that explains why Bailey focused on the wider region. He examined the power struggles between the Aboriginal Konds and the Hindu settlers, and introduced the term ‘bridge-actions’ to capture the manner individuals pursued their interests by mobilizing support across competing political structures such as tribe, caste, and the modern state. 9\n\nFREDERICK G. BAILEY (1924–)\n\nTribe, Caste and Nation is sometimes regarded as the best of the three Indian monographs. This is not only because of the scope of the study, but also because of its methodology and theoretical sophistication. Taking the position that disputes and conﬂicts are ‘diagnostic’ of the causes and directions of social change, Bailey organized the study around 38 such cases. While the analytic focus was on social structure the author’s discussion of antinomies such as static versus dynamic and synchronic versus diachronic advanced the discipline’s capacity to deal with social change. In Politics and Social Change (1963) Bailey focused on the system of representative democracy in the State of Orissa, aiming to discover what impact parliament had on the older political structures of tribe and caste, and what it meant to people in their everyday lives. He began by interviewing about 50 State Assemblymen and then shifted the inquiry to the level of constituencies and villages. Bailey candidly presented this challenging project as an experiment in methodology, testing whether the tools of social anthropology can cope with the complexity of a modern state. Transactionalist theory: politics, power, and self-interest The Indian volumes were a hard act to follow, but Stratagems and Spoils surpassed expectations. Drawing on the work of several prominent predecessors, especially Fredrik Barth, Raymond Firth, Edmund Leach, and Bronislaw Malinowski, Bailey sketched out the nuts and bolts of what became known as the TRANSACTIONAL or interactional model, and sometimes action or agency theory. It opens with a comparison between the Maﬁa and violent interaction among Swat Pathans, arguing that both the Maﬁa and the Swat Pathans arrange their politics in much the same way and claiming that, beneath the veneer of cultural variation, political activity everywhere, whether in advanced Western states or in tribal and peasant societies, exhibits a common set of principles. Bailey distinguishes between normative and pragmatic rules of behavior. Normative rules are general guides to conduct, consisting of public, formal, or ideal rules of society. Pragmatic rules are deviations from the ideal rules; they consist of the tactics and strategies that individuals resort to in order to eﬀectively achieve their goals. While not denying that duty and altruism exist, his message is that human interaction is dominated by pragmatic rules manipulated by choice-making actors capable of rational calculation. In everyday life most of us, guided by self-interest, thread our way between the 10\n\nFREDERICK G. BAILEY (1924–)\n\nnorms, seeking the most advantageous route. This is no less true of politician, who ‘are all caught up in the act of outmanoeuvring one another, of kniﬁng one another in the back, of tripping one another up. … No statesman is eﬀective unless he knows the rules of attack and defence in the political ring’ (Bailey 1969: xi, xii). On one level Stratagems and Spoils is a study of politics and power, but on another level it provides a theoretical perspective for the entire discipline. People are not puppets controlled by the institutional framework; they are active agents locked in competitive struggle. Nor is the social structure uniﬁed and static; it is a dynamic entity, continuously being reshaped by the shifting transactions, alliances, coalitions, competitions, and choices that characterize human interaction. The transactional model pushed the image of the social world so far away from Radcliﬀe-Brownian STRUCTURAL-FUNCTIONALISM as to render a paradigmatic shift. Morality and Expediency is an expanded version of the Louis Henry Morgan Lectures delivered at the University of Rochester in September and October, 1975. Its subject matter is the university as an organization which struggles between the contradictory goals (or ‘myths’ as Bailey labels them) of scholarship, collegiality, and service to society. This book picks up the scent of the self-interested, manipulative actor which permeates Stratagems and Spoils, and pursues it into even darker corners. The focus is on the unprincipled side of human interaction, on ‘institutionalized facades, make-believe and pretence, lies and hypocrisy’ on what ‘every public ﬁgure pretends does not exist’ (Bailey 1977: 2) Bailey distinguishes between public and private interaction. Public arenas are where principles, goals, and slogans ﬂourish, and are the locus of non-rational debate. As principles and beliefs are devoid of criteria of ultimate worth, they can be proclaimed but not demonstrated. The private arena, uncontaminated by the urge to play to an audience, is where things get done. This is because under the protection of privacy, principles can be relaxed and compromise prevails. To the extent that this occurs, the private arena is where rationality takes over. Yet the public arena is not merely an irksome ideological screen. It is there where people persuade each other that the world is orderly and therefore meaningful – what Bailey labels the basic lie, without which we might all go mad. One chapter is devoted to committees. As part of the bureaucracy, they should be guided by rationality and impersonality, not collegiality, since bureaucracies ideally only consider that part of an individual pertinent to the task under consideration. Communities, 11\n\nFREDERICK G. BAILEY (1924–)\n\nin contrast, deal with the full, rounded person. Bailey shows how in reality the community dimension always invades committee deliberations. Through casual remarks and gossip, committee members exchange personal information about the individuals under discussion. Indeed, ‘such committees cannot work eﬀectively unless they use such information, without formally admitting that it exists’ (ibid: 66). Bailey reduces the political faces of his colleagues to ten analytic constructs or ‘masks’ that stand mid-way between role and personality. There is Reason, a ‘technician of the intellect,’ who is unconcerned with ﬁrst principles, believes that every problem has a solution, and questions the sanity of anyone who fails to see things his way (ibid: 128). Another mask is Baron, ‘the man with moustaches, with testicles. … ’ for whom intimidation is the weapon of choice (ibid: 134). Despite the book’s insights into the workings of universities, and other types of formal organizations, it never had the same impact as his previous books, largely because anthropology at home still cannot compete with the discipline’s traditional focus on the (increasingly elusive) exotic ‘Other.’ Not everyone has been enthusiastic about Bailey’s approach to politics or to the wider discipline. A criticism aimed speciﬁcally at the Indian monographs is that social change is assumed to be externally generated. That may be a fair comment with regard to Caste and the Economic Frontier, but misses the mark if the other two books are also the targets. Some have contended that Bailey ignored the politics of the powerful. But his books covered such illustrious ﬁgures as Gandhi and de Gaulle, and in later years Lyndon Johnson and Hitler. Stratagems and Spoils has been criticized for promoting an overly cynical view of the human condition, and for focusing so narrowly on the micro level of interacting individuals that sight is lost of the broader historical and structural forces that arguably shape human conduct. Yet it has been translated into French, Italian, Spanish, and Japanese and praised as the modern successor to Machiavelli’s The Prince. Many anthropologists, indeed, would regard it as the ﬁeld worker’s model par excellence. Bailey excelled in all dimensions of academic life: administration, research, and, not least of all, teaching. At Sussex the graduate program in anthropology, which focused on peasant communities in southern Europe, was almost a one-man show, and he edited several volumes of his students’ work. Little wonder that those who studied under him during that era have remained so loyal. Over the years Bailey has changed his position regarding some of the fundamental issues in anthropology, most obviously the shift 12\n\nGEORGES BALANDIER (1920–)\n\nfrom social structure to the transactional model. In later years Bailey began to treat ideas and their inﬂuence on behavior, as the analytic starting point. In a later book (Treason, Stratagems and Spoils, 2001) rational calculation partly gave way to an emphasis on emotion, spontaneity, and unanticipated consequences, and duty was allowed alongside self-interest. As Bailey’s conception of the actor and the social realm became more complex, it appeared that his faith in underlying order, and thus in science, became less certain. Yet he never gave up on the comparative method, or his fascination with politics, and that has been a good thing. That is why he has made so great a contribution to the anthropological analysis of the political process.\n\nSelected readings Bailey, F. G.

STANLEY R. BARRETT\n\nGEORGES BALANDIER (1920–) In a highly productive administrative, academic, research, and writing career that has spanned over six decades, Balandier has made vital contributions to French anthropology, African Studies, and social theory. It is possible to identify three key, interrelated phases in Balandier’s career. First, in his early anthropology of the colonial situation, he announced his departure from classic ‘timeless’ anthropology and in this work he gave priority to cities, a dynamic colonial present and its historical roots. Second, in the 1960s, he shifted toward political anthropology and ‘social dynamics,’ drawing on general anthropological and sociological theory. Third, since the 1980s, Balandier has focused on the contemporary world, on the sociology of the present, and on the ruptures of modernity and overmodernity (surmodernité). 13\n\nGEORGES BALANDIER (1920–)\n\nBorn in a small town, Balandier grew up in a France rent by antagonistic currents that in neighboring countries gave rise to Nazism, Italian fascism, and the Spanish civil war. A childhood visit to the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition made a strong impression and contributed to a lifelong interest in other societies. Balandier studied philosophy and literature at the Sorbonne as well as ethnology at the Institut d’Ethnologie in Paris before ﬁnding employment at the Musée de l’Homme. During World War II, he left Paris to return to his home region partially to avoid the ‘Service of Obligatory Labour.’ There he served in the French resistance. Back at the Musée de l’Homme after the War he worked under his mentor and friend, Michel Leiris, who introduced him to Sartre and Camus, then at the peak of their inﬂuence. He wrote a ‘furious’ autobiographical novel, Tous Comptes Faits (1947), and in 1946, with the help of Leiris and Denise Paulme, traveled to Dakar, Senegal to join the Institut Français d’Afrique Noire (IFAN). In Dakar, he befriended Senegalese intellectuals like Alioume Diop and Léopold Senghor and collaborated with Paul Mercier on a study of Lébou ﬁshing people near Dakar, who were subjected to colonial domination, cultural mixing, and the proximity of the colonial capital. These experiences led him away from the then dominant atemporal anthropology toward the study of the dynamics of power relations, contestations, and change. After Senegal, Balandier became director of the local IFAN in Guinea-Conakry. As in Dakar, he aroused the suspicions of the colonial establishment by associating with African, pro-independence intellectuals and politicians including Sékou Touré, whose messianic Marxist fervor led Guinea to a precipitate independence and later to what Balandier (2003: 79) called ‘nepotistic predation’ and ‘a sort of tropical totalitarianism.’ He came to realize that up to the moment of the ‘colonial freezing,’ the political history of Africa had been ‘more inventive and thus more diversiﬁed than that of Europe’ (Balandier 1977 :62). In 1948 Balandier was assigned to Brazzaville (Moyen-Congo) to create a sociology section at the Institut d’études centrafricaines. He began to study social and cultural change among Kongo-speakers in Brazzaville and later, among Fang villagers in northern Gabon. He wanted to compare Kongo society, ‘with its long history, hierarchies, former kingdoms, and inequalities’ to the ‘more egalitarian,’ less territorially rooted Fang, ‘who gave form to their modernizing initiatives in the framework of a re-composition of tribes and clans’ (Balandier 1997: 280). As a hierarchical society, pre-colonial Kongo was stratiﬁed with 14\n\nGEORGES BALANDIER (1920–)\n\nnobles, religious experts, warriors, commoners, and slaves. The more egalitarian Fang, with informal bigmen, village heads, and warriors, but no nobles and few slaves, were much less stratiﬁed. Balandier’s emphasis (1977: 231–32) on ‘foreign impositions,’ subterranean autonomy, the ‘religious imagination,’ ‘the birth of peasant nationalism,’ and ‘the critique of the colonial situation,’ departed signiﬁcantly from the then dominant STRUCTURAL-FUNCTIONALIST anthropology. In 1951, he published his seminal article on ‘The Colonial Situation’ that preﬁgured the anthropology of colonialism. This article treated the colonial situation as a complex totality that linked colonizing and colonized societies in an ongoing dynamic of power relations, coercion, conﬂict, ideological mechanisms, and crisis. In 1952, Balandier returned to France, where he prepared two doctoral theses (at the Sorbonne and the Ecole des Hautes Etudes), defended in 1954 and published in 1955 as Sociologie actuelle de l’Afrique noire (Eng. tran. 1970) and Sociologie des Brazzavilles Noires. The ﬁrst developed his comparative study of colonial crises among Congolese Ba-kongo and Gabonese Fang. The second was one of the ﬁrst anthropological studies of an African city as a product of colonialism. Following his thesis defense he was elected to the École Pratique des Hautes Études (EPHE) in Paris where he created the Centre for African Studies, which he directed until 1984. At the EPHE and later at the Sorbonne he trained a generation of prominent Africanist anthropologists, including Claude Meillassoux, Emmanuel Terray, Marc Augé, Jean Copans, and Jean-Loup Amselle. In his long teaching career, he also taught in Africa, the United States, England, Japan, Canada, Mexico, and Iran. Throughout, Balandier retained an intellectual restlessness, a desire to undertake the greatest number of activities, create openings for his students, and to enable them to continually renew their research. In the late 1950s, Balandier turned his attention from the colonial situation to emerging concerns of development, underdevelopment, modernization, urbanization, and industrialization and, with Alfred Sauvy, initiated the concept of the ‘Third World’ (Tiers Monde). His African experiences sensitized him to European depredation of Africa’s and Asia’s human and material wealth and the disorganization, ruptures, and chronic crises brought about through sustained relations with the West. In 1956, he wrote, ‘Asia and Africa were ﬁrst modernized in function of European interests, without possessing the political autonomy aﬀording them the capacity to deﬁne their future. Disequilibrium and predations accumulated, without any solutions beginning to compensate for the destructive impact’ (Balandier 2003: 275). 15\n\nGEORGES BALANDIER (1920–)\n\nIn 1957, Balandier published his most widely read book, Afrique Ambigüe (Eng. tran. 1966), a rich, reﬂexive, philosophical memoir based on his years in post-war Africa. Meanwhile, he continued to explore social dynamics, the sociology of mutations, tradition and modernity, development, dependency, and the social costs of progress. From 1961 to 1966, he taught at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. While continuing to teach sociology and ethnology at the Sorbonne, he served from 1963 to 1973 as director of the department of Human Sciences at the Overseas Research Oﬃce (ORSTOM). He also edited a prominent book and co-edited a number of academic journals, including Présence Africaine, Tiers Monde, Cahiers d’études africaines, Cahiers internationaux de sociologie and the Journal of Modern African Studies. In Anthropologie politique (1967, Eng. tran. 1970), Balandier undertook a systematic overview of the anthropological study of politics. When attempting to deﬁne and formalize ‘politics,’ one must, he argued, consider a broad range of political systems and practices, emphasize power rather than decision-making and employ a dynamic perspective. In Sens et Puissance (Meaning and Power) (1971), Balandier developed his theory of social dynamics, in which society is an evermoving, approximate order in constant formation subjected both to internal and external forces including events, ruptures, crises, and confrontations. In Anthropo-logiques (1974) Balandier extended his analysis of ‘society,’ arguing that society as such does not exist. Societies are aggregates of antagonistic groups: men and women, adults and youths, dominant and dominated, and ‘societies within societies’ that must be regulated. He also spelled out his diﬀerences from the STRUCTURALISM of Claude Lévi-Strauss who had diﬀerentiated between modern societies that were changeable, ‘hot,’ and subject to historical forces, and the ‘cold,’ post-Neolithic societies that were amenable to structural analysis. Balandier argued that that there were no ‘cold’ societies and that all societies were dynamic systems of tensions, more complex than the dualistic class tensions proposed by Marxists (freemen and slaves, patricians and plebeians, lords and serfs, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat). During the 1980s, Balandier turned to a sustained analysis and critique of modernity, ‘overmodernity’ (surmodernité), galloping economism, and the impact of rapid growth of science and technology. In Le détour (1985), he argued that the detour by way of the anthropological study of Others opened the possibility of seeing ourselves as we have become and of identifying the major categories that organize us: the political body, the division of sexes, the techno-imaginary, and 16\n\nGEORGES BALANDIER (1920–)\n\nemerging logics of information and communication. He characterized the late twentieth century as an era of erasures, ruptures, crises, and uncertainties, both product and producer of the conquests of science, economic failures, weakening powers, and institutions. At the same time, destruction and destructuration have given rise to the new and the unprecedented – transitions that have shaken values, hierarchies, laws, justice, and the security of people and goods. In Le désordre: Eloge du mouvement (1988), Balandier continued his comparative examination of the coherences and dysfunctions of modernity by way of tradition. He argued that all societies are confronted by disorder – order and disorder are inseparable; people create order from disorder. Modernity combines movement, heterogeneity, and uncertainty, which heighten awareness of disorder. Current ﬁgures of disorder include brutal events, epidemics and evil, violence and terrorism, weakened politics. He laid out a range of insuﬃcient responses including totalitarian ideologies, exploitation of fear, sacralization of individual action, the cult of money and entrepreneurship, and the quest for religious certainty. The title, Le Dédale: Pour ﬁnir avec le XX siècle (1994), draws on the classical myth of Daedalus, the Minotaur, and the labyrinth. In some versions, Daedalus built the labyrinth so cunningly that he himself was barely able to escape. This myth served as a metaphor to explore the unprecedented paths our era has led us on; paths characterized by expanding powers, ambivalence, blind alleys, and traps. In this world, order dissolves order, growing complexity discourages straightforward logic. We meet new Daedaluses, masters of technical power at the crossroads of the imaginary, who seek the detours of the sacred, and who interrogate exploded democracy. In Le Grande Système (2001), Balandier focused on ‘new, New Worlds,’ worlds that are not territorial but that have emerged through advances in science, technology, and conquering economism. A logical memory links these emerging worlds, that of an expanding, worldwide Grand System that imposes itself, revealing the true face of globalization. Fenêtres sur un nouvel âge: 2006–2007 (2008), argues that rupture is no longer a choice but a product of perpetual movement, pushed ahead by unceasing technological invention, exploited and accelerated by conquering economism and giving birth to the ‘new New Worlds’ where we already live, without knowing what they are or where they are leading us. How, he asks, can one master a disorientation that renders us strangers to ourselves? Although deeply versed in social theory, Balandier is perhaps less well known to Anglophone audiences because of his resistance to grand 17\n\nFREDRIK BARTH (1928–)\n\ntheorizing or, as he puts it, ‘partisan dogmas’ and in-vogue ‘intellectual systems that oﬀer ease of occupation,’ be it Marxism, ‘excessive structuralism,’ or post-structuralism. Indeed for much of his career, Balandier worked in the shadow of Claude Lévi-Strauss, whose work he greatly admired, but which he characterized as ‘an almost decontextualized anthropology … that treats from a distance systems of action and even more systems of historicity.’ In contrast, Balandier characterized his own work as situated ‘at the heart of turbulences’ and attentive to ‘immediate history’ and to ‘crises as revealing moments in societies and cultures’ (Balandier 2003: 9, 25, 70, 60, 62).

JOHN M. CINNAMON\n\nFREDRIK BARTH (1928–) If anthropologists were ranked solely on the basis of the sheer number and variation of their ethnographic projects, Fredrik Barth would have few peers. He has conducted ﬁeldwork in Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Sudan, New Guinea, and Norway. Yet there is much more to his reputation than volume and variation. His monographs are ethnographic gems, reﬂecting a remarkable talent for ﬁeldwork and 18\n\nFREDRIK BARTH (1928–)\n\nlanguage acquisition, and some have made major contributions to theory. Three of Barth’s books are representative: Political Leadership among Swat Pathans (1959), Ethnic Groups and Boundaries (1969), and Ritual and Knowledge among the Baktaman of New Guinea (1975). The ﬁrst laid the groundwork for a new perspective: the TRANSACTIONAL model. The second signiﬁcantly shifted the direction of ethnic studies, both in anthropology and generally. The third monograph is selected because it marked a dramatic new ethnographic setting and problem focus, and dealt with a rare example of a culture virtually untouched by the modern world. Barth was born to Norwegian parents in Germany. His geochemist father eventually took up a position in Chicago. Graduating from the University of Chicago in 1949 with an MA in anthropology, specializing in palaeontology and evolutionism, Barth joined an Iraq-bound research team as a physical anthropologist. While there he discovered that it was living, ‘exotic’ people who interested him. He wrote a PhD dissertation, based on his experiences in Iraq, for the University of Oslo. It was rejected because E. E. Evans-Pritchard, on consultation, judged the duration of the ﬁeldwork insuﬃcient. Ironically, Barth later demonstrated that splendid research can be done in less time. Barth then decided to enrol at the London School of Economics to study under Raymond Firth, but, as Firth was on leave, he had to work with Edmund Leach, who several years earlier had spent ﬁve weeks in Iraqi Kurdistan. When Leach left for Cambridge in 1953, Barth followed. After doing ﬁeldwork in Pakistan and obtaining his PhD in 1957 he returned to Norway and was recruited by the University of Bergen, where the Department of Anthropology that he founded became internationally renowned for its political and ecological perspective. He also taught at the University of Oslo, Harvard, and Emory. Subsequently, Barth and his anthropologist wife, Unni Wikan, joined the Department of Anthropology at Boston University where he concluded his teaching career. On retirement he returned to Oslo as a research fellow at the Ministry of Culture and has held a number of visiting professorships. Fieldwork among Pakistan’s Swat Pathans in 1954 only lasted several months but Barth had studied the Pashto language and was able to soon dispense with interpreters. He was equally quick to realize that Swat political life bore little resemblance to the formal authority structures enshrined in the literature on political anthropology. There was, in fact, no institutionalized leadership in Pathan society. This did 19\n\nFREDRIK BARTH (1928–)\n\nnot mean there were no leaders. Indeed, there was ﬁerce competition among leaders, but those who followed did so voluntarily rather than having allegiance ascribed through birth or group aﬃliation. Barth described the relationship between leaders and followers as a transaction reﬂecting choice. Leaders oﬀered individuals gifts and protection in return for allegiance and a willingness to bear arms. To some degree, leaders had a hold on their followers because the latter were often their tenants and in debt to them. However, the position of leader was tenuous. If a man could not maintain his wealth or defend his honor followers would switch support to a more powerful leader. Pathan society had two kinds of leader. Secular leaders emerged entirely from the Pashtun or landowning caste. Land was accumulated through inheritance, purchase, and conquest, and was the main source of political authority. Yet a successful leader had to have more than land and wealth. He had to be courageous in battle, violent, revengeful, and even mercurial. The other type of leader was the Saints. Their political authority was largely derived from their reputation for morality and holiness and from their service as mediators between feuding Pashtun factions. However, they too were landowners, obtaining land as gifts stemming from their role as mediators. They also inherited and purchased land, and sometimes seized it by force. The Pashtun landowners and the Saints, whose land also gave them political clout, occupied complementary roles. The former engaged in brutal competition; the latter’s mediator role reduced the threat of anarchy intrinsic to such competition. Structural features such as caste and descent groups (called ‘frameworks’ by Barth) limited the range of choices available to the actor, but did not determine political allegiance. Two strands of action theory, and two models of social processes were developed by Barth in his Pathan ethnography: although self-interested, calculating actors exercising choice in a competitive arena capture the essence of political behavior among Pathans (the TRANSACTIONAL MODEL), Barth pushed the analysis further, arguing that the aggregate choices constituted processes which unintentionally generate new structural forms in society (the generative model). To Barth’s regret it was the transactional model which was elaborated by subsequent action theorists such as F. G. Bailey. He later acknowledged that he and others overemphasized the self-interested, choicemaking individual competitor, underplaying the processes which generated structural forms. If Political Leadership among Swat Pathans was a path-breaking study, the same was true of Ethnic Groups and Boundaries, probably 20\n\nFREDRIK BARTH (1928–)\n\nBarth’s best-known work despite being an edited volume. Its goal was to explain how ethnicity persists. Barth distanced himself from notions of cultures as bounded groups, and separated culture from ethnicity, rejecting the long-established assumption that ethnicity is created and maintained by primordial bonds. He argued that rather than being weakened by contact between ethnic groups, ethnicity is actually strengthened, including, critically, the boundaries between ethnic groups. Added to the above was a phenomenological element: ethnicity is self-ascribed and involves identity and meaning. Barth made no attempt to construct a typology of ethnic groups, attempting instead to apply a generative model to the processes that create and maintain ethnic groups. The key to the process was the ethnic boundary and its maintenance, not the internal make-up of an ethnic group. These boundaries, which may or may not be territorial, not only persisted in the face of interethnic contact and interdependence, but were strengthened by it. Indeed, a dramatic reduction of cultural diﬀerences between ethnic groups does not necessarily reduce ethnic identity or the saliency of ethnic boundaries. While ethnic groups take culture into account, there is no one-toone relationship between ethnicity and culture; thus, to trace the history of an ethnic group is not to trace the history of a culture since ethnic groups only select a limited set of features from culture – features useful in reinforcing their boundaries. Despite considerable regional variation, Pathans maintained a self-identity as a distinctive ethnic group with a clear social boundary, because the basis of that identity was a set of key values deemed peculiar to Pathans as a people. Barth gave fresh impetus to ethnic studies, not least of all by explaining how ethnic ties have persisted into the modern world. Inasmuch as he stresses the manner in which ethnicity is negotiated and labeled through interactions with other groups, hints of his earlier transactional analysis are evident. What was novel was the emphasis on self-ascription and identity, and therefore on meaning. This concern with subjectivity and meaningful interaction reﬂects the inﬂuence of the great sociologist, Max Weber. Few anthropologists today employ the term ‘primitive’ outside quotation marks, yet when a previously unknown and unstudied group in New Guinea called the Baktaman made the headlines, the antennae of anthropologists tingled. Enter Barth. Following a brief scouting trip, he took up residence among the Baktaman in January, 1968, remaining for 11 months. This project marked a dramatic shift 21\n\nFREDRIK BARTH (1928–)\n\nin both geographical setting and problem focus. In Ethnic Groups and Boundaries Barth’s emphasis on self-identity and meaning had signaled a partial move away from his previous political and ecological perspective. Ritual and Knowledge among the Baktaman of New Guinea completed the move. His new focus was on ritual, symbolism, knowledge, and communication – especially non-verbal communication. Barth treated ritual as a tradition of knowledge, reﬂecting the worldview of the Baktaman and analyzing ritual as a set of modes of communication and thought. Fieldwork centered on the secret male initiation cult, the gateway to manhood, social recognition, and sacred knowledge. All men had to pass through it to achieve the status of full human beings. Barth discovered there was a paucity of myths or other genres of indigenous interpretive material to help him understand the ritual and that his best hope was to undergo initiation himself. After much negotiation, he was accepted as an initiate and discovered a world rich in symbols with multiple referents. These non-verbal symbols were embedded in the male initiation rite whereby Baktaman expressed and gained knowledge of the world. Barth then pointed out an enormous problem for the investigator: how to capture the essence of and put into words a ritual that can only be understood when one participates in its performance. He contended that Baktaman had no exegetical (explanatory) tradition of their own. Informants’ explanations of the symbolism in the initiation ritual would have been an artiﬁce of the ﬁeldworker, not a faithful expression of Baktaman thought. While recognizing that some cultures possess traditions of exegesis, Barth raised the possibility that native explanations may have been artiﬁcially created and thus contaminated by the questions posed by researchers. Whether Barth is right or wrong, his eﬀorts to avoid imposing an outsider’s explanatory framework on the data display his skill as a ﬁeldworker at its best. Barth depicted his experiences in New Guinea as an ‘anthropological treat.’ Yet the Baktaman were not entirely untouched by the outside world. They initially came into contact with Europeans in 1927 when two adventurers entered their village. Apparently the next contact was with a Patrol Oﬃcer in 1964. But the villagers already possessed considerable knowledge by then about Europeans and their paciﬁcation policy as a result of interaction with their neighbors. By the time Barth had entered their community, there were steel axes and knives, and salt was readily available. Barth lived a simple and frugal existence among the Baktaman, trading salt for local food items. He candidly admitted that he found 22\n\nFREDRIK BARTH (1928–)\n\nthe ﬁeldwork challenging, never achieving linguistic ﬂuency and relying on an interpreter/assistant. Yet because the Baktaman only numbered 183 people, he was able to interact with virtually everyone. Barth usually eschews discussions of general theory, preferring to let his data and interpretations speak for themselves. Yet it would be interesting to hear what he has to say about the concept of culture in the context of the Baktaman community. Does it constitute a distinctive way of life and are culture and ethnicity synonymous? Then, too, we only have Barth’s judgment that the key to Baktaman society is the male initiation cult. Might another ﬁeldworker have seen things diﬀerently, and produced a diﬀerent ethnography? Barth was not the ﬁrst to challenge STRUCTURAL-FUNCTIONALISM, with its rigid social structure resting in a state of equilibrium, and its coercive normative order denying agency and choice to human beings. Leach (1954), had already set the critique in motion, yet Barth nudged it in a new direction, in laying the foundation for the transactional model. Barth almost single-handedly put Scandinavian anthropology on the map. In recent years his inﬂuence there seems to have diminished. He has been charged with ignoring the macro-structural and historical forces that arguably created the rough-and-tumble politics of the Pathans, in an area which is currently a Taliban stronghold. Moreover, his conception of power as a contest between equals conceals the diﬀerential advantage related to class position. It might be added that the only voice heard in his work is that of the authoritative author. That style, along with his overwhelming interest in ‘exotic’ peoples, might suggest that his work is now out of step with contemporary anthropology. Yet even if his various monographs consisted entirely of low-level description, his high reputation would be assured. The fact that they are packed with analysis of general theoretical importance leaves no doubt about his stature in the discipline.\n\nSelected readings Anderson, R.

BARRETT\n\nRUTH FULTON BENEDICT (1887–1948) Ruth Fulton Benedict was one of the founders of the CULTURE AND PERSONALITY school of American anthropology. The books for which she is famous, Patterns of Culture and The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, oﬀer descriptions of contrasting cultures that laid the foundation for an analysis of the links between individual personality and cultural norms. Benedict insisted that the ﬁndings of anthropology reach a wide audience and that anthropologists confront the political issues of the day. Ruth Fulton was born in 1887, in Norwich, New York. Her father died when she was two years old, leaving her mother immersed in mourning. In a life story, Benedict attributed her persistent fascination with dichotomy to the childhood experience of the ‘calm’ of death juxtaposed to wild outbursts of grief. Early on Ruth seemed absorbed in her own world. An eventual diagnosis of deafness explained her withdrawal, but a habit of hesitancy and restraint continued for the rest of her life. Her childhood was nomadic, following her mother’s career as a librarian and a teacher. In 1905 Ruth and Margery, a year younger, entered Vassar College, following in their mother’s footsteps. At Vassar, Ruth discovered the power of writing to integrate her experiences, observations, and emotions. After she graduated, she returned to Buﬀalo, New York, to live with her mother. She took a job as a social worker, and encountered the poor, struggling, and often failed immigrants of an industrial city. Impatient with the little she could accomplish, and hampered by deafness, in 1911 she moved to California to live with Margery and her husband. Ruth taught in a private school in Pasadena, and she met Stanley Rossiter Benedict, a chemist, whom she married in 1914. World War I intensiﬁed her commitment to contributing ‘meaningfully’ to the world. Chemical detective stories, written with Stanley,\n\n24\n\nRUTH FULTON BENEDICT (1887–1948)\n\nfailed to satisfy her and she turned to biography as a contribution in a time of chaos. Benedict drafted essays on three ‘pioneering women’ (Mary Wollstonecraft, Margaret Fuller, and Olive Schreiner), developing a theme that characterized her later anthropology: the impact of social conditions on creativity, self-fulﬁlment, and individual freedom. The biographical studies also extended Benedict’s engagement with feminism. She argued that ‘feminism is not a system but a passionate attitude’ and that her three subjects attained heroic status through the adventure of living. In the portraits, Benedict applied techniques she later used in anthropology, extracting ‘character’ from myriad details and using distance to expose the lineaments of the familiar. When Houghton-Miﬄin rejected the biographical project, Benedict turned to academia. In 1919 she enrolled in courses at the New School for Social Research. Her teachers, Elsie Clews Parsons and Alexander Goldenweiser, opened diﬀerent doors to the discipline, the closely empirical and the broadly theoretical. Parsons encouraged Benedict to pursue a PhD in anthropology and in 1921 introduced her to Franz Boas, head of the anthropology department at Columbia University. Father of American cultural anthropology, Boas became Benedict’s mentor, training her in the CULTURAL RELATIVISM and the liberal tolerance that shaped his anthropological work. In 1923 she completed her dissertation, ‘The Concept of the Guardian Spirit in North America,’ which was based on library research not ﬁeldwork. ‘Guardian Spirit’ marshaled abundant details in an exploration of the ‘diﬀusion’ of traits across a culture area, in the Boasian tradition. At the same time, an inquiry into spirituality suited Benedict’s intuition that non-material aspects of life provided the clues to a culture’s deepest preoccupations. PhD in hand, she began a career in teaching, ﬁrst as Boas’s assistant and then on her own. Over the next 25 years Ruth Benedict trained generations of anthropologists, inspiring students despite her perceived aloofness. She gave special attention to women, encouraging ﬁeldtrips, the pursuit of a career, and conﬁdence in the face of continuing sexism, even in anthropology – a discipline that accepted women relatively early. By 1930, her marriage to Stanley Benedict had ended. In 1923 Benedict met the student whose impact on her anthropology and her life would be profound. Margaret Mead began in psychology, but was soon persuaded to shift to anthropology. Exchanging ideas, manuscripts, and letters, the two developed theoretical approaches to the discipline they shared, and an emphasis 25\n\nRUTH FULTON BENEDICT (1887–1948)\n\non socialization, broadly deﬁned, provided a scheme for comparing cultures in terms of the beneﬁts for individuals. The pliability of the human being, the relativity of presumed human universals, and the boundless capacity for transforming social conditions became central principles in anthropology. In the 1920s the two also wrote poetry, and they drew another poet-anthropologist into their circle, the linguist Edward Sapir. For nearly a decade, Benedict and Sapir debated the value of poetry against the clear illumination of a science. Eventually Benedict replaced the poetry of Anne Singleton (her pseudonym) with anthropological pieces. Articles based on ﬁeldwork (the Serrano in California, the Zuni in the Southwest) alternated with examinations of the concept of culture. By the early 1930s, Benedict contemplated bringing her material into a full-length book. ‘Psychological Types in the Cultures of the Southwest’ (1930) and ‘Conﬁgurations of Culture in North America’ (1932) provided the organizing themes. Data came from her ﬁeldwork, Boas’s Kwakiutl studies, and Reo Fortune’s The Sorcerers of Dobu. She puzzled over conﬁguration and she submitted the manuscript with the word pattern instead. Published by Houghton-Miﬄin in 1934, Patterns of Culture instantly became, and has remained, a classic in anthropology. Benedict’s choice of ‘pattern’ reﬂected a move from earlier pieces, in which she posited a theory of the integration of cultures. Pattern suggested a dynamic, continually emerging arrangement, intrinsic, creative, and adaptive. The word also emphasized the aesthetic dimension of integrity, an outcome in elegance that she transformed into a comparative method. Cultures could be compared according to the degree and the elegance of conﬁguration. She borrowed pattern from art, poetry, and her view of an individual’s life trajectory – and it provided the grounding for a later inquiry into the impact on selffulﬁlment of diverse ‘designs for living.’ Remembered for the phrase ‘culture is personality writ large,’ Patterns argues that every culture selects along an ‘arc of traits,’ choosing from a universal span pieces that at once ﬁt together and create a distinct character: the Apollonian Pueblo Indian, the paranoiac Dobu Islander, and the megalomaniac Kwakiutl. Her own society constituted the fourth character, subject of a stern critique for rampant greed and overweening ego, and intolerance of the individual who lacks those traits. The last chapters of Patterns oﬀer a brilliant analysis of the relativity of ‘abnormality’ and the production of deviance through the imposition of rigid demands on conformity. ‘Abnormality,’ she wrote, is a label applied to ‘those who are not 26\n\nRUTH FULTON BENEDICT (1887–1948)\n\nsupported by the institutions of their civilizations’ (Benedict 1934: 258). She expanded the thesis in a 1934 article, ‘Anthropology and the Abnormal,’ published in The Journal of General Psychology. The growing ﬁeld of social psychology provided support for her inquiry into the personal and social eﬀects of discordance between individual and culture. During the 1930s, Benedict edited the Journal of American Folk-Lore. The appointment recognized her contribution to studies of myth and folklore, and the signiﬁcance of her analysis of the links between imagination and behavior. In 1935, she published a compilation of myths in the two-volume Zuni Mythology. Under her editorship, the Journal achieved prominence, and folklore moved from a marginal to a central place in anthropology. Events of the decade pressed heavily: the Great Depression at home and the rise of fascism in Europe. Benedict responded by applying disciplinary insights to economic and political breakdown, addressing her fellow citizens in a variety of media, from the New York Herald Tribune to the American Anthropologist. In every instance, Benedict mounted a severe critique against the United States. She criticized her country for wasting the resources of its population, for discriminating against particular groups, and for nurturing neuroses in its citizens. Benedict expanded her interpretations of personality and culture with ideas from Karen Horney and Harry Stack Sullivan. ‘Continuities and Discontinuities in Cultural Conditioning’ appeared in Psychiatry in 1938, and conﬁrmed Benedict’s rejection of Freudian theory. Asserting the signiﬁcance of childrearing, she pointed to the failures in the United States: children learned nothing that ﬁt them into an adult world. Discontinuity between childhood and adulthood created a dysfunctional American character. Moreover, Americans treat their methods as natural and thus ‘overlook the possibility of developing social institutions which would lessen the social cost we now pay’ (Benedict 1953 [1938]: 531). Acknowledging custom, she reiterated, permits the ‘conscious direction of the life course.’ The frequently reprinted piece has entered the canon of American childrearing literature. Benedict always admired Boas for his ‘actions in the world of aﬀairs’ (Benedict 1943: 15). In the 1930s she used anthropological techniques to elucidate the rise of fascism in Europe and the evident racism at home. In 1940, she published a short book, Race: Science and Politics. In it, she dismantled scientiﬁc claims of diﬀerent intellectual endowments among racial groups. In a widely distributed pamphlet 27\n\nRUTH FULTON BENEDICT (1887–1948)\n\nversion, Benedict exposed the political uses of a presumed ‘science’ of race. The same year (1940) she delivered a series of lectures at Bryn Mawr College, reprinted in 1970 as ‘Synergy: Some Notes of Ruth Benedict.’ The lectures explored the processes through which harmony between social institutions, religious beliefs, and individual personalities can be achieved without enforcing conformity, suppressing creativity, and arresting change. In 1941 the United States entered the war, and two years later Benedict accepted a position in the Federal Government’s Oﬃce of War Information. Her decision reﬂected her commitment to the role of anthropologist as citizen. Like her colleagues (Mead, Geoﬀrey Gorer), she applied theories of childrearing and adult personality to gauge the behavior of both allied and enemy nations (Thailand, Rumania, Burma). Then, in 1944, she was ‘assigned’ to Japan, ‘our most alien enemy’ (Benedict 1946: 1). She prepared reports for the OWI, drawing on ﬁlms, interviews, and secondary sources in order to get at the character of the Japanese. Two years later, she transformed bureaucratic prose into her last book, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword. The book is a model of national character studies, beautifully written and persuasive. For Benedict, Japan exempliﬁed a ‘high synergy’ society, in which institutions ﬁt together coherently and personality coincides with culture. Benedict indicates the methods by which ‘integrity’ comes about, the details of behavior that reinforce the pattern, and the methods of childrearing that guarantee successful integration of individuals into social institutions. She maintains the crucial tenet of her anthropology: bringing contrasting cultures into illuminating relation, in this case Japan and the US. The contrast was explanatory: one culture was driven by shame, the other by guilt. A book written to help the US understand its enemy established a comparative approach in the discipline premised on the diversity of emotional drives across cultures. Chrysanthemum oﬀers a program for enlightened change in Japan and at home, and the book satisﬁed Benedict’s commitment to contributing ‘meaningfully.’ The American military used the book in peace negotiations with Japan (honoring the Emperor), and millions of readers in the US acquired a compassionate view of the ‘alien.’ Readers in Japan appreciated the book’s penetration into the sources of their culture and, alert to cultural values, acquired the potential to engineer the direction of life after total defeat. As in all her writings, Benedict referred to the terms and conditions of her own culture, exposing the arbitrariness of arrangements and advocating the conscious redesign of pattern. 28\n\nRUTH FULTON BENEDICT (1887–1948)\n\nAfter the war Benedict returned to Columbia University, where she participated in comparative studies of childrearing practices through UNESCO and the Studies of Cultures at a Distance project. In 1946 the American Anthropological Association elected her president, and her farewell speech, a year later, summarized the strands in her anthropology and set a template for the future. Benedict reminded her audience that the goal of social science, and anthropology in particular, is to improve human lives in all societies. Yet, while putting man at the center of studies of society, anthropologists exclude ‘emotion, ethics, rational insight and purpose’ (in Mead 1959: 461). In anthropological writings the person becomes simply a mechanical cog in the social system. To move the person beyond this spiritless position as a research object, Benedict told her audience, anthropologists must follow the great humanists. Philosophy, literary criticism, and literature should guide the discipline in its insights, its principles, and its commitment to diﬀusing interpretations beyond the ivory tower of academia. The ‘common man,’ his concerns, hopes, and creativity, is the subject of and audience for anthropology. Ruth Fulton Benedict died in September 1948, 61 years old. Obituaries testify to her importance in the discipline as scholar and citizen, scientist and writer. She had bequeathed to anthropology her conviction that the only subject worth studying was ‘man’ and the conditions for self-fulﬁlment, freedom, and passionate living. In insisting that any scholar must address the pressing concerns of the day, she showed that CULTURAL RELATIVISM did not absolve the anthropologist from clear-eyed judgments. And last but not least, Ruth Benedict instructed her fellow anthropologists in the importance of writing as an aspect of inquiry and a route to the understanding and tolerance it was anthropology’s duty to implement.
