        "text": "Surrounded by more than 200 years of history, privilege and elitism, Isabelle Florestan took a deep breath and stood up to address the French minister of state.\n\nA fortnight ago this fresh-faced 18-year-old was living with her \"modest\" family on the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion. Now here she was, 6,000 miles from home, studying at the exclusive Henri IV lycée in Paris.\n\nShe had entered the world of would-be presidents and politicians, of tomorrow's thinkers, creators, movers and shakers, and it was, she confessed, a tad frightening. \"My biggest fear is that I will miss my family and that I will not succeed,\" she told visiting education minister Gilles de Robien.\n\n\"Everyone is so proud of me, I don't want to let anyone down.\"\n\nMr de Robien was reassuring. \"You've the capacity to succeed or you wouldn't have been chosen. Now it's a question of work,\" he said with a paternal smile.\n\nThere was a smattering of applause among the students present - 22 girls and eight boys - who radiated pride and gratitude. They had been described as pioneers, a select few handpicked from 170 hopefuls to take part in a historic experiment to inject a \"social mix\" into France's elitist higher education system.\n\nThey were, as one student put it, \"of all colours\" and from all over France. The only things they had in common were academic brilliance and the distinction of being boursiers (grant students). This meant, we were told several times, they were from what were euphemistically described as \"disadvantaged\" or \"modest\" backgrounds that would normally exclude them from dreaming of entering such an august institution.\n\nCelebrated\n\nThe Lycée Henri IV sits on the site of a 6th century abbey in the heart of Paris's famous Latin Quarter; a stone's throw from the Sorbonne and the Panthéon, the resting place of France's great and good. As the academic year began this month clusters of white flowers still clung to the miniature trees in the ancient cloisters as they must have done in autumns past when former president Georges Pompidou taught at Henri IV or when celebrated alumni Jean-Paul Sartre and René Descartes walked the stone pathways.\n\nThis is one of France's most prestigious lycées where classes préparatoires groom students for the fiercely competitive entrance exams to the elite grandes écoles. It is at the heart of a relentlessly selective education system that creams off the cleverest youngsters from the age of 13-14 years old.\n\nStudents who at 18 pass their baccalauréat - the equivalent of A-levels - with above-average marks are encouraged to forget university and take two-year preparatory prépa courses for the grandes écoles, the stepping stones to the country's highest economic, artistic, political and social echelons.\n\nHalf a century ago as many as a third of prépa students at Henri IV were from so-called disadvantaged families. By the 1990s this had fallen to 9%. Alarmed by the figures, the lycée's proviseur, or head, Patrice Corre - himself the son of Auvergne farmers - began pushing for the college to admit students from less privileged families six years ago.\n\nIt took the outbreak of rioting and car burning by disaffected youths that started in Paris's banlieues in November to galvanise Jacques Chirac's right-of-centre government. One month later it announced an experimental prépa class at Henri IV to encourage more egalité in schooling. It also promised the scheme would be extended if successful.\n\nAmid criticisms of dumbing down and political correctness - half of the new students are from the notorious Paris banlieues - an important caveat almost went unnoticed. Despite being selected for exceptional academic achievements, Henri IV's 30 new students are being taught separately from its regular intake. Only if and when they prove themselves worthy will they be permitted to join the real prépa classes. In most cases this will mean an extra year's study. As one education specialist put it: \"Henri IV is not a charity. It wouldn't want this experiment interfering with its success rate.\"\n\nProfessors at Henri IV admit the new students are bright but insist they need to catch up academically and, as importantly, \"culturally\".\n\nPolish\n\nAlthough all French schools are supposed to follow the same curriculum, the best lycées hothouse their pupils by working a trimester ahead, giving them the edge in the prépa selection process.\n\nIt was repeated several times during the backslapping welcoming ceremony that being from \"disadvantaged\" families meant these youngsters lacked the cultural sophistication expected of the average lycéen. In short, they needed a good polish. To this end, the Louvre, the Paris Opera and the Comédie-Française theatre have agreed to offer an extra-curricular arts programme.\n\nAndrew Baume, a Briton who has taught English at Henri IV for 10 years, said: \"The majority of students who succeed in coming here have had their cultural development nurtured by their parents. This course should compensate for circumstances where families have not contributed to this cultural and recreational development.\"\n\nPrivate companies are sponsoring the students' living expenses and fees and giving each a laptop. They have been allocated a personal tutor - usually a former lycéen. \"We want to offer all these youngsters, who have already shown their qualities and maturity, the best conditions for studying so they have the best chance of succeeding in the most difficult entrance exams,\" Mr Corre told the gathering at the ceremony.\n\nAdvocating egalité while highlighting the new students' \"cultural\" deficiencies and \"disadvantaged\" backgrounds raised some hackles among the students. \"They're making it sound like we're all dirt poor, live amid rioting and have never even heard of prépa courses before, which just isn't true,\" said one.\n\nBut Joffrey Collignon, 18, the son of a railway worker from Fontainebleau, near Paris, was unfazed. \"We're in the middle of some political and media hype and we're not all poor, but it's true we're from a different social and cultural milieu to those who have impressive libraries at home and think nothing of flying to New York for the weekend.\n\n\"Because of this I think I might have felt out of my depth in the ordinary prépa class. OK we have to do an extra year but we'll learn a lot in that year, not least of all from each other. Actually, I'm looking forward to going to the opera for the first time.\"\n\nExclusive higher education\n\n· The grandes écoles are elite higher education institutions. There are about 200 in France, most of which are quite small with an intake of fewer than 1,000 pupils\n\n· Established in 1747, they were initially meritocratic but have become dominated by the wealthy and influential\n\n· About 100 lycées and institutions run prépa courses that prepare students for entry to the schools\n\n· France is run largely by graduates of the grandest of grandes écoles, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA). Set up by Charles de Gaulle in 1945 to train technocrats how to run the country, it has educated two of France's past three presidents including Jacques Chirac and seven of its past nine prime ministers\n\n· Half the ministers in the government and most of the country's top civil servants are énarques, or former ENA students\n\n· More than 60% of the chief executives in France's largest 100 companies are graduates of the grandes écoles\n\n· Richard Descoings, director of the Institute of Political Studies in Paris - one of the grandes écoles - has described France's higher education as unfair, unequal and undemocratic\n\n· Students on scientific prépa courses are known as taupins, or moles, because they have so much work they rarely see the light of day"
