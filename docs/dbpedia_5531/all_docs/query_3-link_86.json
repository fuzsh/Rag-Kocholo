        "text": "Paris Sciences & Lettres (PSL) has marked its first appearance in the Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings with the highest ranking of any French institution and listed the eighth best in Europe. Overall it was 38th, placing it among the world’s top 50 universities.\n\nThis first international ranking is an impressive feat for PSL, coming only seven years after its foundation as a collegiate of research and higher education institutions in the Paris area, and three national research organisations.\n\nThe rankings achievement is a strong reflection of its progress since the results are based on peer recognition. An extensive global opinion survey of leading academics stretching across 137 countries assessed the excellence of research and teaching. The survey was conducted between January and March this year and received a total of 10,566 responses.\n\nPSL’s ranking shows that by consolidating institutions within a large university it has been possible to rise to heights that no French institution could have hoped to reach on its own. For example, the École normale supérieure ranked individually in the 61 to 70 bracket, and now, as a member institution of PSL, finds itself among the top 40.\n\n“France has been a relative underperformer in this list in recent years, but PSL’s success reveals the collective prestige of many of the leading institutions in Paris”, affirmed Phil Baty, publisher of the Times Higher Education Ranking.\n\nMarc Mézard, President of PSL, added: “This Times Higher Education ranking shows clear recognition of the progress achieved in developing PSL. Pooling our strengths bears fruit. We see this not only in our research programmes and the new educational tracks we are creating, but also in the innovation coming out of our laboratories. All of this is reflected in the ranking. This performance compels us to stay the course and rise to upcoming challenges with the same success”.\n\nNotes to editor\n\nAbout PSL - https://www.univ-psl.fr/fr\n\nParis Sciences & Lettres (PSL) research university, located in the heart of Paris, provides the ideal academic environment for breeding excellence, creation and innovation, with 4,500 faculty researchers, 181 laboratories, 20,000 students, and some dozen business incubators, fablabs and co-working spaces for student entrepreneurs.
