Professor of developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience of education\n\nGrégoire is Professor of Developmental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience of Education and Director of the Laboratory of Developmental Psychology and Child Education (CNRS).\n\nHe obtained a PhD in 2005 at the Université Paris Sud.\n\nIn 2010, after 4 years of post-doctoral studies at Harvard University, Grégoire Borst joined the LaPsyDÉ.\n\nHis research focuses on the role of high-level cognitive functions (metacognition, planning, resistance to automatisms, emotional regulation) in cognitive and socio-emotional development and school learning in children, adolescents and young adults by combining behavioral and neuroimaging approaches (EEG, NIRS, MRI). Author of more than 70 scientific articles, Grégoire has also published various pedagogical works (i.e. Le cerveau et les apprentissages) as much as books for the general public (i.e. Mon cerveau - Questions/Réponses).\n\nGrégoire works in close collaboration with all those involved in education.\n\nHe is a senior member of the International Bureau of Education (IBE - UNESCO), junior member of the Institut Universitaire de France (IUF), member of the youth committee of the Conseil Supérieur de l'Audiovisuel (CSA), member of the steering committee of the federation of innovative public schools (fespi) - DRDIE Ministère de l'Education Nationale, member of the board of directors and the scientific council of the GIS REEFOR - INSPÉ de Paris, member of the CoNRS - section 26.\n\nArnaud Cachia\n\nProfessor of developmental cognitive neuroscience\n\nArnaud is Professor of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience at Université Paris Descartes (University of Paris), member of the Institut Universitaire de France and researcher in the laboratory of Developmental Psychology and Child Education (CNRS, Sorbonne, Paris). He is also coordinator of the University Diploma (DU) 'Neuroeducation' of the Université Paris Descartes.\n\nArnaud completed his PhD in science on the anatomy and development of the brain at the Frédéric Joliot Hospital Service (CEA, Orsay) from 2000 to 2003 with a research residency at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI, McGill University, Montreal) in 2003. Subsequently he was a postdoctoral fellow and 'INSERM Young Investigator' in the 'Imaging and Psychiatry' Unit (INSERM, Maison des Adolescents, Paris). In 2009 he became a contract investigator at the 'Centre de Psychiatrie et Neurosciences' (INSERM, Hôpital Sainte-Anne, Paris) before joining the Université Paris Descartes in 2011.\n\nArnaud's research aims to decipher the neurodevelopmental bases of cognition. He is interested in the interactions between early constraints (fetal brain development genetic factors) and late neuroplasticity mechanisms in children and adolescents on normal (learning) and pathological (psychiatric disorders) cognitive development. All his work uses a gene-brain-behaviour approach integrating the different levels of the living being.\n\nEstelle Corbière\n\nDancer and teacher, Laban scriptwriter\n\nInitially trained in classical dance as a child, she broadened her practice with jazz and contemporary dance as a teenager. As a professional dancer, her travels opened up other aesthetic horizons for her, such as tap dancing in New York and traditional Indian dance in India.\n\nAt the age of 35, she decided to train in the analysis and writing of Laban movement at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris. After graduating in 2010 she deepened her research on movement with Body-Mind Centering of which she is a certified practitioner, specialising in the motor development of infants. She collaborates with choreographers Olivier Dubois and Bruno Benne, for whom she writes the dance scores. Today, she devotes herself to training and reflection on the place of movement in the development of the individual. Holder of the State Diploma of contemporary dance teacher, she teaches choreographic culture in the conservatories of the city of Paris. A specialist in movement notation, she teaches the analysis and writing of Laban movement at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris, gives conferences in France, and trains various professionals (psychomotricians, architects, occupational therapists, choreographers and dancers, etc.).\n\nShe receives the support of the Ministry of Culture via the Centre National de la Danse, Aide à la recherche et au patrimoine en Danse, for the writing of the scores Révolution (2013) and Tragédie (2014) by Olivier Dubois, and in 2019, for the research project with Isabelle Calabre \"Quadrilles créoles, histoire(s), esthétique et pratiques”.\n\nIt is Estelle who has designed the movement modules that all our students practice daily. She and her choreographers will lead a term of body creativity for each of our class levels. At Union School, we are more than happy to count her among our Experts.\n\nDanièle Dumont\n\nThe goddess of cursive writing in France\n\nFollowing a brief stint teaching in secondary schools and then in nursery schools, Danièle focused on three of her passions: research, writing and teaching.\n\nShe holds a DU in handwriting, in which her dissertation focused on writing with Parkinson's disease. She has also worked as a legal expert. Her experiences have led her to a fuller understanding of the importance of automatic reflexes whilst writing.\n\nIn 2013, she presented her doctoral thesis in language sciences to the René-Descartes University in Paris V, on the writing of Latin cursive lower case letters. Her research led her to create the concept of the “writing gesture”.\n\nHer book, ‘Le geste d'écriture’ - Éditions Hatier, is a bible for teachers. Danièle has also been training writing re-educators - psychomotor therapists, speech therapists and psychologists - for more than 20 years. Thanks to her work, they are now equipped to analyse and understand children's writing difficulties and to remedy them.\n\nDanièle's 'geste d'écriture' is now the reference within the Education Nationale and her method of teaching cursive writing is recognised worldwide.\n\nHer handwriting books, which have been adapted in English, exclusively for Union School, are used by our teachers who are also lucky enough to be trained by Danièle herself.\n\nAt Union School, we are fortunate to have Danièle Dumont as a member of our prestigious College of Experts.\n\nEllen Wynne Michel\n\nHead of Maternelle\n\nTeacher for Reception and Pre-Reception in English and Coordinator for ‘Maternelles’.\n\n\"I'm Ellen and I'm very pleased to be teaching the nursery children of Union School.\n\nI'm a UK trained primary and early years teacher and I have over 30 years of teaching experience in international and bilingual schools. I was Headteacher of a school in Singapore and once back in France, I was a teacher at the European School of Strasbourg.\n\nI'm passionate about education and I'm looking forward to working with young learners and helping each one reach their potential through fun hands-on activities and by stimulating their natural curiosity.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy travel, visiting museums and walking (especially with my dog!). I also like sewing, handcrafts and reading. I'm the mum of three teenage children from whom I've learned a lot about how children's minds grow and develop.\"\n\nWhat Ellen does not say is that she is the wife of a lieutenant-colonel, so she followed her husband wherever his job called. What Ellen does not say is that at the European School in Strasbourg, a marvellous school and a sort of flagship of the French national education system, her role was much broader than that of teaching, which was already immense.\n\nEllen was also in charge of European hours. What Ellen doesn't say is that she has three wonderful children, who have brought her to a deep understanding of autism and ADD. Ellen loves Irish ballads, Ed Sheeran's Supermarket Flowers which she can't listen to without crying, and the first movement of Dvorak's Symphony No. 9, 'From the New World': 'A rousing piece of music but with a deep soul!\n\nWe are very pleased that Ellen has agreed to join Union School. Her wealth of experience and passion for education are all reasons why our nursery students are so fortunate.\n\nMarianne Rieu\n\nTeacher for Year 3 and Year 4 in French\n\n\"Hello everyone, I am Marianne and I teach French in CE1 and CE2. Originally from Bondy, I have been a school teacher for over 10 years.\n\nAfter graduating, I taught for 3 years in Paris and then I went to work in the United States, in Seattle. It was there that I discovered bilingual primary education, which is where I thrive today.\n\nConvinced of the importance and richness of such teaching, I then continued my career in bilingual education in London.\n\nI am delighted to be back in France today and to be part of the Union School team. I look forward to teaching my students to grow and develop in a caring and supportive environment that values the richness and culture of each individual.\n\nOutside of teaching, I enjoy spending time with my family, travelling and discovering new countries, playing sports, or simply reading a good book in the sun. \"\n\nVaidehi Palshikar\n\nTeacher for Reception and Pre-Reception in French\n\n\"Hello! I am Vaidehi and I will be the teacher in PS/MS in French. I have a Masters degree in French Literature, have recently finished my MEd in International Education and have 10 years of teaching experience in international and bilingual schools.\n\nBorn and raised in Bombay, India I started my teaching journey at the Lycée Français Internationale de Bombay where I taught in the nursery alongside The American School of Bombay and the Alliance Française de Bombay where I was a French as a Foreign Language teacher for children and adults. I then, worked for 4 years in France before moving to Ukraine, where I pursued my Masters degree with the University of Dundee, Scotland via distance learning.\n\nI love what I do and am looking forward to creating an equitable and inclusive environment where all learners feel respected and safe. Building strong relationships with children and their families to guide learning and help children achieve their true potential is of utmost importance to me.\n\nIn my free time I love cooking and eating cuisines from around the world. I love to travel, to read, board games and play my guitar. I am a trained Hindustani Classical singer and love music from all over the world! I speak 5 languages and my wish is be able to sing in as many languages as I can! I also dabble in photography and improv theatre. I am so excited to start my journey with Union School this September!\n\nVaidehi is so sunny, empathetic, curious about everything, a good listener, tolerant and gentle. Her journey has led her to adopt ever-enriching points of view as well. After that, you won't be surprised to learn that her choices for our Spotify Playlist included a Hindi song, a very sweet track by a Ukrainian rock band, and ‘Gottingen’ from the French singer Barbara. What a joy to have her join us! How lucky our students are !\n\nSimon Le Garrec\n\nTeacher for Reception and Pre-Reception in French\n\n« Hello! My name is Simon and I am the French teacher in Nursery and Reception alongside Vaidehi, under Ellen’s supervision.\n\nAfter over six years in the United Kingdom working in both the English and International systems, I am excited to come back to my Parisian roots and looking very much forward to work at Union School Paris !\n\nI have been working for three years at Ecole Jeannine Manuel London in Early Years with nursery, reception and year1 with a wonderful environment and amazing projects done. I have also worked at EIFA International in Year 4 and 5 for two years.\n\nBefore becoming a teacher, I used to work in Media after a Bachelor Degree in Arts and Media. Outside of school, I love going to Art exhibitions, doing sports especially basketball, and drawing which I do on a daily basis »\n\nNathalie Boucher\n\nTeacher for Year 1 and Year 2\n\n\"Hello! My name is Natalie, and I am so excited to be starting this innovative and creative project that is Union School. I strongly believe in a creative and inspiring pedagogical approach to foster curiosity in children and develop a love of learning for life.\n\nI have spent the last 10 years working with elementary and nursery pupils, being responsible for a class of up to 30 children. Having worked in international schools for the past 4 years, I have a keen interest and appreciation for exploring new cultures. I have a passion for working with children and could not imagine myself in any other career. My classroom ethos is based upon my belief that it is essential to treat every child as an individual to enable them to succeed and achieve their full potential.\n\nAs a teacher, I strongly encourage collaborative learning strategies to increase participation and make children more engaged and accountable for their own learning. I believe that planning innovative lessons which evoke excitement and curiosity are fundamental for children to be passionate and enthusiastic about their learning journey. I strive to create a safe and warm atmosphere within my classroom to provide a welcoming and open space for both children and parents/guardians.\n\nI pride myself on being an enthusiastic and creative teacher that fosters an inspiring learning environment for all, where children feel full of confidence and are not afraid to take risks in their learning. A ‘growth mind-set’ approach enables children to understand that mistakes are a valuable part of learning, which is crucial for them to succeed in their life after school. I am incredibly excited to become a part of this new community, working together with children and families, to create the happy and fun memories that make primary school what it is!\"\n\nSamantha Nicolakakos\n\nTeacher for Reception and Pre-Reception in English\n\n\"Hello, my name is Samantha Nicolakakos. I am a university honour graduate with a Canadian certified teachers degree in both English and French for all primary and junior subjects.\n\nI am a passionate caring and dedicated teacher who looks at every challenge in the classroom as a learning experience for both myself and my students..\n\nOutside of my work, I enjoy spending my time outdoors and being active. Soccer is one of my favorite sports that I played competitively, starting at 4 years old. I also enjoy snowboarding, biking, going on forest hikes and doing yoga. While I enjoy keeping myself physically active I also have creative interests in the arts, I love music, painting and taking photos.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy being social with friends/ family and learning about different topics related to culture and history. It is important for me as a human being and especially as a teacher to be aware and understanding of the forever changing world around me and the people who live in it.\n\nI am looking forward to getting to know your children as I guide and teach them through a successful school year\"\n\nChelsea Kunkel\n\nPrimary Coordinator - English\n\nTeacher for Year 3 and Year 4 in English\n\n\"Hello everyone! My name is Chelsea, and I am so pleased to be joining the Union School team and community. Born and raised in Ohio, USA, I graduated from The University of Akron with a degree in Education, a second major in History, and a minor in French.\n\nI began my career by working in both American and French public schools before turning to international and bilingual settings, all of which allowed me to teach various curriculums as well as different ages and abilities. Along this path came the opportunity to study the Montessori method in Norway, an experience that forever opened my mind to the extraordinary potential of holistic, child-centered education.\n\nIn my career, I also served as an international school’s Primary Coordinator, a role in which I collaborated on bilingual program design, led innovative projects, and assisted in earning international school accreditation.\n\nI have been very fortunate to work amongst exceptional educators, all of whom have helped mold me into the teacher I am today. I adhere closely to the words of one of my role models, Fred Rogers, who once said, “A great gift from any adult to a child, it seems to me, is to love what you do in front of the child. Attitudes are caught; they’re not taught.\" As a teacher, I aim to empower children through a love of learning and, as Jonathan Kozol put it, “build a little place of ecstasy and poetry and gentle joy.”\n\nI spend my free time raising two beautiful, bilingual children, singing and dancing to musicals, dining and laughing with friends and family, celebrating all the holidays, and reading and watching the latest book-to-movie adaptations. I also enjoy discovering the history of different places and people; I find something magical about walking in the footsteps of those who have come before us.\n\nI am so looking forward to being a part of this project and starting the first year of Union School together! \"\n\nNatalie Amies\n\nCoordinator for SEND and Academic Support\n\nEnglish & Maths Support Teacher and SENDCo\n\n\"My name is Natalie, and I am the English & Maths Support Teacher and SENDCo at Union School.\n\nI am so excited to be part of the innovative, creative and passionate school staff here and I look forward to starting a new chapter altogether as a Union School community!\n\nBrought up in an English-French bilingual household myself, I have always valued the importance of being able to communicate in different languages. Following my degree in English Language and French at the University of Birmingham, I became truly aware that knowing another language is having a new vision on the world around us, enabling us, not only to experience new cultures, but to gain an open-minded approach on different ways of life. Consequently, I taught in Martinique and Switzerland, in both primary and secondary school settings, teaching English as Foreign Language.\n\nI continued pursuing my dream of teaching by completing my PGCE at the University of Exeter, and I will now be entering my seventh year of teaching the British National Curriculum in Primary Schools in the UK and France. More recently, I was appointed as a Lower School Coordinator in an International School where I helped implement a bilingual curriculum and supported the school in achieving international accreditation.\n\nDuring my studies, I worked for a charity 'Challengers' which supports children with disabilities and their families. This incredible opportunity helped to instil my work ethos where I always strive to ensure that each and every child develops holistically, enabling them to have access to future opportunities and a life-long curiosity and love of learning. This is the foundation of my philosophy for child-centered teaching: creative and cross-curricular lessons which are scaffolded accordingly to varying needs and abilities. Carefully planned, personalised and hands-on sessions enable children to independently investigate questions and uncover answers; this helps them to gain confidence in their own abilities and become more autonomous and astute learners!\n\nAdditionally, I strongly believe in a positive mindset for all children: positive reinforcement of achievements, and understanding that mistakes are part of the learning journey, help students to gain perseverance and self-esteem within a happy and fun primary school experience. Outside of school, I love dancing, exploring new places and countryside walks.\n\nI also enjoy art and cooking, so Paris - full of wonderful galleries and delicious restaurants - is the perfect place to be!\n\nI cannot wait to uncover hidden talents, explore new possibilities, and be inspired by all the wonderful children, whom we will have the chance to work alongside every day! \"\n\nTara Baudry\n\nTeacher for Reception and Pre-Reception in English\n\n\"Hello! My name is Tara and I am excited to be joining Union School as one of the Reception English Teachers. I'm an enthusiastic educator with a Bachelors in Psychology and a Masters in Teaching in Urban Settings from the University of Southern California. I also have a Multiple Subjects and Bilingual Authorization Credential. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, I've spent over six years working with diverse children in various settings.\n\nComing from a multicultural and multilingual home, with an Iranian and French heritage, I have always had a deep appreciation for language and culture. This love for diversity and learning inspired me to pursue a career in teaching at an international school, where I can share my passion with my students.\n\nMy teaching philosophy revolves around creating an inclusive classroom environment that meets the unique needs of each student. I believe in providing culturally responsive resources and ensuring that my students are academically, emotionally, and socially prepared for success. I highly value the knowledge, experiences, and strengths that my students bring to the classroom. I strive to build upon and celebrate these qualities, recognizing that every student has something valuable to contribute to our classroom, our school, and society.\n\nOutside of teaching, I enjoy immersing myself in cultural experiences such as visiting museums, attending concerts, watching movies, and traveling. Art, music, and writing poetry are my personal passions, as they allow me to further explore and appreciate different forms of expression. I also enjoy being outside with friends and family.\n\nBy dedicating myself to education and embracing diversity, I aim to make a positive impact on the lives of my students here at Union School, helping them grow into well-rounded individuals who are equipped to navigate our interconnected world.\"\n\nCamille Meckes\n\nTeacher for Year 5 and Year 6\n\n\"My name is Camille, and I teach French in CM1 and CM2 at Union School. Initially, I pursued a scientific education, but the passion for teaching, which I inherited from my parents who are both educators, quickly took hold of me.\n\nI obtained my Master's degree in Teaching/Education and successfully passed the competitive examination for primary school teachers in 2014. I worked for several years with the French Ministry of Education in Burgundy, with the goal of joining an international French school abroad.\n\nAs a result, I taught for five years at the French Lycée in Los Angeles, California. This experience introduced me to bilingual education, and I particularly enjoyed the constant challenge of adapting my methods and meeting the needs of all my students.\n\nI learned to combine excellence, trust, and kindness to create a classroom environment that fosters self-expression, engagement, and individual development. Upon returning to France, I sought to join a school that shares similar values, so that I can share my experience and continue to grow in a bilingual environment that truly inspires me. Thus, I am thrilled to join the Union School team this year!\n\nDuring my free time, I enjoy exploring new places, whether it involves hiking in natural surroundings or leisurely strolling through cities to uncover hidden gems. I have a great love for travel, immersing myself in different cultures, and connecting with local people. One of my most cherished travel memories dates back to the summer of 2020, when I went on a road trip of over three weeks to camp in the national parks of West America.\n\nI am looking forward to getting to know your children as I guide and teach them through a successful school year!\"\n\nJonathan Hartley\n\nTeacher for Year 5 and Year 6 in English\n\n\"Hello, I’m Jonathan and I’m excited to be the English Teacher for Years 5 and 6!\n\nI was born in the USA to a British father and Colombian mother and raised in France, Holland and the UK. I am fortunate to speak four languages!\n\nI have a Masters degree in French and European History from The University of Edinburgh and a PGCE from London Southbank University.\n\nAfter a couple of years teaching in London primary schools, I moved to Paris in 2017. Since then, I have gained a wealth of teaching experience working in international and bilingual schools across the Paris region.\n\nBeing internationally educated myself and coming from a multi-cultural home, I have found that teaching in a bilingual school is the perfect setting for me.\n\nIn the classroom I particularly enjoy building trusting and caring relationships with children, allowing them to grow in self-confidence. I strive to create an inclusive learning environment where all children are seen, accepted and given the opportunity to succeed.\n\nOutside the classroom, I am a keen sportsman and part of a 5-a-side football team. I also enjoy golf, skiing and tennis. I like to travel and discover new places as well as spend time in my family home in Fontainebleau- swimming in the Seine (yes, that’s right!) and having BBQ’s! As part of a local church, I sing and play the cajon.\n\nI’m looking forward to integrating the Union staff team and teaching the older group of children! \"\n\nAnaïs Aidoud\n\nActress, scriptwriter and director - Drama teacher\n\nActress, scriptwriter and director, Anaïs has always kept in mind this sentence from Oscar Wilde \"Folly is the only thing you never regret\". This philosophy pushed her to try her hand at theatre in 2015.\n\nIt was a revelation, Anaïs starred in many plays at the Théâtre de la Pépinière in Opéra and at the Théâtre côté cour in Parmentier. She also worked with great directors such as Philippe Peyran Lacroix and Hélène Zidi before writing tailor-made roles for herself, such as in \"Coup de folie\", a critically acclaimed show that played for two years at the Petit Trévise in Paris and then throughout France.\n\nAnais continues to work on her writing skills by writing sketches for platforms such as Youtube and Dailymotion.\n\nIn 2021, Anais wrote and directed her first short film \"Le tournesol\" with Joey Starr, which won her international awards (best director at the New York Movie Awards and best actress at the Tokyo Cosmopolitan film festival) as well as broadcasts on TV5 Monde and OCS.\n\nTeaching is also a field in which she has accumulated experience for several years, as a theatre teacher at the Paris School of Luxury, as a personal development and theatre coach for institutions, and as a writer and producer of shows for children.\n\nAnaïs wishes to introduce students to theatre and physical expression so that they can flourish in speaking, surpass themselves and develop their creativity.\n\nAt Union School, we are more than happy to welcome Anaïs who, with her imagination, humour, multiple talents and great professionalism, will help our students to blossom.\n\n@anais_aidoud\n\nMorgan Monnerais\n\nSport teacher\n\n\"Hello, my name is Morgan Monnerais and I am the sports teacher for all the classes at Union School.\n\nI had the chance to practise different physical and sports activities very early on (golf, basketball, cross-country...). I realised at a very young age the benefits of sports on physical, mental and intellectual development.\n\nI was then a student at the Saint-Nicolas Passy Buzenval high school. A great deal of time was spent on extra-curricular activities, and I continued to practise several leisure sports, including cross-country and handball.\n\nAt that time, I was selected playmaker of the Minimes team of the club of Rueil, becoming academy champion of cross-country (team and individual) as well as district champion of handball. In 2012, I decided to take the Brevet d’état d’éducateur sportif with the UCPA.\n\nSince then, I have worked as a physical trainer for individuals and also for Energy Kids Academy under the leadership of Lionel Sartoris and Andry Razafitrimo as a sports educator.\n\nToday, I live in Versailles and continue to do a lot of sports: my golf handicap is 12. I am also passionate about nature - many training courses in the high mountains, especially in the Queyras with my guide Nicolas Braud - as well as reading and music.\"\n\nCapucine Salinson\n\nResponsible for raising awareness of ecological issues at the Fondation GoodPlanet\n\nShe imagines, creates and leads relevant and innovative workshops and conferences to change the way people look at things, change their perspective and make them want to act at their own level. Her pedagogy developed over the last 4 years has enabled her to raise awareness among more than 45,000 people from 3 to 93 years old!\n\nHer academic background in environmental policies and her training in permaculture give her the necessary experience to create and run a vegetable garden. Capucine will meet with students twice a month to develop their understanding of ecology in a fun way and allow them to get their hands in the soil."
