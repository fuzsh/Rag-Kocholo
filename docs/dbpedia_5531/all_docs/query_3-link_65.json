        "text": "Last December, the renovated statue of Bayard, the valiant knight, was returned to its place in the courtyard of Collège Stanislas with great applause. More than a sculpture, the private Parisian Catholic school had recovered its guardian figure, whose motto \"without fear and beyond reproach\" inspired the establisment's motto, \"French without fear, Christian beyond reproach\".\n\nThis symbolic choice dates back to 1872, when the clergy had to close ranks after the shameful defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the Paris Commune, which called for the separation of church and state. Louis De Lagarde, one of the founding fathers of the prestigious establishment on Rue du Montparnasse in the 6th arrondissement, where Edmond Rostand and Charles de Gaulle would study, said at the time: \"I wanted to bring about a fruitful and enduring alliance between France's religious and chivalric traditions. (...) We must prepare young people for a true crusade to safeguard religion, defend truth and uphold the fundamental principles of morality and society.\"\n\nOver 150 years later, this grandiloquent call still thrills Stanislas, also known as \"Stan\". \"Ah yes, it hasn't changed! I spent three years there and found myself in a time capsule right in the middle of Paris. It's a sort of fairytale world where couples are always a mom and a dad, and where girls and boys would never, ever think of sleeping together before marriage,\" said Cécile, 24, still irritated by a place she describes as \"wrong about everything.\" Frédéric Gautier, the director, seems almost amused by this kind of diatribe launched against the institution he has been proud to direct since September 2015. \"For me, Catholicism is by nature conservative, in the literal sense. It preserves the deposit of faith. The Church is against homosexual unions and abortion, as far as I know, isn't it? A Catholic school can't say otherwise.\"\n\nAt the beginning of summer, the director welcomed Le Monde to Stanislas, in the former 18th-century mansion where the administration is based. The old-fashioned decor adds to the formality of the place. Following in the footsteps of Father De Lagarde, Gautier presented his establishment – 3,660 students, including 750 boarders, from kindergarten through to preparatory classes – as a classic, traditional sanctuary. \"A school is a place of learning, not militancy,\" he said. \"That's why I refuse to let the wildest societal issues, such as wokeism, become a subject of concern here.\" His priority, he said, is the pursuit of academic excellence."
