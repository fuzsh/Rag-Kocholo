I will thank some specific people below, knowing that I will inevitably miss someone. I can only say thank you to the many whose names do not specifically appear due to a lapse of memory on my part. This book would not have come together without the contribution first of Alex Roland. He saw the potential in the work and helped me to frame my ideas in productive and useful ways. Bill Reddy was always available with sage advice on what it took to succeed in the academic world. Engseng Ho and Laurent Dubois offered superb advice that shaped this project in meaningful ways, particularly in my efforts to understand difficult anthropological theory or the strands that pulled the French colonial empire together. It is almost impossible for me to describe the debt I owe to Bruce Hall. Simultaneously mentor, colleague, and friend, Bruce’s broad knowledge of the literature and history of Africa opened my eyes to a world of possibilities. I will never be able to reciprocate all that Bruce and his family have done for my family and me. I look forward to more collaboration in the years to come. Coming after almost ten years of toil, this book would not exist without the figurative village of assistance. John Martin helped to shape my thought and writing at a time when I felt lost in the intellectual wilderness. Orin Starn introduced me to the fascinating world of anthropology and drove me to go beyond simple critiques of colonial scholarship. Jolie Olcott opened both her home and her wide range of contacts in the academic and publishing worlds, sharpening my research project at an early stage. Dick Kohn brought his unique set of governmental and historical expertise to bear for me in wonderful and inventive ways, including in his cogent and pointed criticism of very early versions of Chapter 1. Colleagues and mentors at the US Air Force Academy pushed me along in my research as well. To Dana Born, Mark Wells, John Abbatiello, John Plating, Derek Varble, and Larry Johnson, I therefore send a sincere thanks. Most important, I must thank Meg Martin, who gave me the time, space, and unflagging support that I needed to bring this to the finish line. Ultimately, no historical research works without the assistance of the amazing professionals who help us find and make sense of sometimes obscure materials. I must thank Heidi Madden at Duke for her incomparable research support as well as the staff of the interlibrary loan office at Perkins library. In France I must thank the archivists and staff at the Archives Nationales, the Muséum d’histoire naturelle, and the Société Historique de la Défense (SHD) in Paris; the Archives Nationales d’outre-mer in Aix-en-Provence; and the Institut Mémoire d’édition contemporaine in Caen, who made research a smoother (and quicker) process than perhaps should be the case. In particular, André Rakoto at the SHD made my work in Paris easier and much more enjoyable.

I would be remiss if I did not also thank Lester Crook, who first saw value in the publishing of my work. At the same time, friends were crucial to my success. I could not have made it without the help, support, and laughs supplied by Jeannine Cole, Emily Margolis, Fahad Bishara, Julia Gaffield, Willeke Sandler, Samanthis Smalls, Wynne Beers, Daniel Bessner, Elizabeth Brake, Eric Brandom, Karlyn Forner, Vanessa Freije, Ketaki Pant, Erin Parish, Sean Parrish, and John Roche. Each knows what he or she has done to help me along. Finally, I must thank my wonderful and ridiculously patient family. My daughters Cara and Katie simply could not wait until the day my book was done so that I could spend more time with them. Kathy’s willingness to serve as a first-line copyeditor, despite my truculence, was amazing. Without their love and support, I could never have completed this work, which too often kept me away from them.\n\nx\n\nIntroduction\n\nPortrayals of an Africa frozen in time justified colonial conquest and rule, particularly after the 1830 invasion of Algiers ushered in a new era of colonial expansion for France. It was the nature of this colonial rule, though, that caused significant debate between those who advocated for a parallel “association” with local African social and political structures and those who pressed for a combined “assimilation” toward an ideal French social condition.1 Association acknowledged difference as assimilation tried to eliminate it, but neither dealt with it effectively. Chinua Achebe described this contrast effectively in 1977: “If Europe, advancing in civilization, could cast a backward glance periodically at Africa trapped in primordial barbarity it could say with faith and feeling: There I go but for the grace of God.” He continued, “Africa is to Europe as the picture is to Dorian Gray—a carrier on to whom the master unloads his physical and moral deformities so that he may go forward, erect and immaculate.”2 It fell to colonial scholars and functionaries to remedy this ugliness and to offer a solution that delivered a strong movement forward for all. They failed. French colonialism lacked any real consent of the governed and was thus an unsustainable political form. The basic “asymmetry” of the relationship doomed it to failure.3 These thinkers expanded the field of possible sources and introduced new concepts, but they continued to view native Africans as sources of information and only rarely as reasoning interlocutors and intelligent interpreters. Scholars laid analytical frames atop what Michel Foucault has described as a new mode of thought, one focused on “identity and difference” instead of the long-dominant search for “resemblance.”4 Seeking to improve and ultimately perfect French colonial rule in North and West Africa, French soldiers, scholars, and administrators engaged in complex conversations with thinkers from the metropolitan center, colonial power structures, and native intellectual communities on the nature of African colonies and subjects. Much as Helen Tilley has found in the British African colonies, French administrators across Africa found wide access through their positions, but also great restriction due to their narrowly defined roles in the uneven colonial power dynamic. Their native interlocutors in many cases used the interaction to stake claims to their own political positions.5 In this process lay the potential for productive intellectual engagement but also the seeds of political destruction. These conversations, conducted across time and space and involving a wide variety of texts and sources in translation, revealed the inherent contradictions of a larger project that required successful dialogue but delivered systems\n\n2\n\nAnthropology, Colonial Policy and the Decline of French Empire in Africa\n\nof exploitation. Conversely, these hybrid networks designed for political domination, instead, generated new descriptions of social construction that would long outlive their original purpose. Much as Charles Tilly has described in early modern Europe, attempts to shape or in any way “homogenize” populations that threatened the political or social essence of a subject people met with resistance of various types.6 It was this intellectual resistance, sometimes delivered through an understanding of historical documents or concepts, that sustained French social and ethnological thinkers as they sought to understand colonial groups. It also offered an opening for non-Europeans to build an alternate intellectual space apart from the colonial state. Important critiques of race-based policy and science emerged in those spaces, within the colonial states themselves and from thinkers from a wide variety of backgrounds.7 Far from passive recipients of metropolitan thought, men and women in the colonies actively shaped metropolitan ideas on basic social structure and interaction as they emerged. In the French science de l’homme, intellectual innovation came not always from academics in stuffy rooms but instead from direct interaction and dialogue with the subjects of study themselves. These efforts ultimately fell under the rubric of “ethnology,” a social science devoted to understanding distinctions between civilizations or races and employing historical, linguistic, and ethnographic tools of analysis.8 From General Louis Faidherbe (1818–1889) in the 1840s to politician Jacques Soustelle (1912–1990) and sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1930–2002) in the 1950s and 1960s, a succession of soldiers, scholars, and administrators cultivated colonial sources to translate indigenous ideas for a metropolitan audience interested primarily in a more efficient form of colonial rule, in this case, the grafted associationist approach. It was this act of translation, though, that undermined the entire effort. French thinkers built their ethnological ideas through interaction with native sources, both living and written, but the simple act of selection artificially narrowed their view and doomed the colonial structures that followed. Building from a place of initial weakness due to limited language skills and local contacts, French explorers and administrators adopted local norms exulting Arabic language forms for diplomacy, trade, and religion.9 Their insular approach, with head down toward the page instead of head up toward the sociopolitical events swirling through Africa and Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, caused them to grasp the wrong conclusions. These limitations were largely hidden from view at the time as these thinkers built intellectual networks wider than those employed by their predecessors, even confronting and countering theories proposed by social scientists such as Emile Durkheim (1858–1917). By 1955, for instance, Soustelle adopted ethnological institutions and principles in an ultimately incomplete and failed effort to govern Algeria with an associationist eye while stamping out the nascent nationalist revolt. At the same time, in the work of Bourdieu and his associates, French Africanist ideas formed the core of a new, empirically grounded, and personally contingent alternative to the dominant structuralist, sociological, and anthropological perspective in France advocated by Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908–2009), among others. James Clifford has framed this thought process in useful terms: “The ethnographic modernist searches for the universal in the local.”10 French Africanist scholars likewise\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nspent significant time examining local histories, origin myths, and migration patterns in hopes of discerning distinct macro-civilizations. From there, they sought to design more effective political structures of rule while simultaneously building a better understanding of basic human social structures. Interestingly, the fourteenth-century North African theorist and polymath Ibn Khaldun (d. 1408) proved an important source and even indirect discussant with the ideas of Faidherbe, Marshal Hubert Lyautey (1854–1934), and French Africanist scholars Maurice Delafosse (1870–1926) and Paul Marty (1881–1936). It was in the collision of ideas along with these intellectual networks and conversations that the real outlines of association as a method of rule emerged, a political structure that by design instrumentalized information to harden further the apparatus of colonial rule. European academics sought to build a social and political associationist state to link Africans to France across what anthropologist Arjun Appadurai has described as the rupture between past and present; modernity thus became an absolute, a singular achievement to which all others could only aspire.11 French Africanist thinkers wanted to lessen the impact that an African transition to European-style modernity would have on “traditional” societies. In this sociopolitical project, French thinkers employed terms such as “evolution,” “civilization,” and “progress” as code for political dependence and justification for colonial rule. They did not seek to eliminate colonialism, a practice that they saw as helpful to Africans in numerous ways. Instead, they desired perfection of that system, building on centuries of European philosophy to arrive at a more refined, benevolent, and dialogic form of rule. This developmental approach never truly shed its assimilationist origins as colonial states continued to replace precolonial structures with new modes of rule and social investigation, creating what Edmund Burke has termed a “colonial archive” of social understanding.12 In the end, these efforts failed due in large part to the unevenness of the transaction between the colonizer and the colonized. Instead, they substituted translation into the language of colonial rule and the use of ethnographic information as grist for the ever-turning mill of exploitation. More willing than many of their peers and predecessors to rely on African sources in building colonial policy, they nonetheless remained trapped in the colonial bind, unknowing or uncaring of the excesses they delivered. In the words of Michel Foucault, “everyone knows that ethnology was born of colonization, but that does not mean it was an imperial science.”13 Indeed, colonial ethnology and the related refinements to the forms of political rule grew from a long tradition stretching back to early modern colonization of the Americas and the difficult debates of the European Enlightenment. From the Spanish Dominican Bartolomé de las Casas (1474–1566) to Montesquieu (1689–1755) and on to nineteenth-century theorists such as Alexis de Tocqueville (1805–1859), Henri de Saint-Simon (1760– 1825), Herbert Spencer (1820–1903), and Auguste Comte (1798–1857), European conceptions of race, lineage, and difference built from limited interaction with nonEuropean populations.14 Tocqueville and his liberal colleagues, both British and French, advocated expansion and subjugation as a necessary part of the modern world and a vital driver of the national political prestige necessary for imperial competition. The resultant “enlightened” imperial structures would then govern their new subjects “naturally.”15 Colonial rule grew from political exigency; civilizing rhetoric masked\n\n4\n\nAnthropology, Colonial Policy and the Decline of French Empire in Africa\n\ninequalities of capability and status. All of that accumulated difference necessitated a grafted political rule that considered native structures as adapted to local circumstance, but only viewable through the limited ethnological lens offered by colonial personnel. Historian C. A. Bayly has found in the British case that colonial agents worked with preexisting native informational structures in developing a localized understanding. In his words, “Colonial officials, missionaries, and businessmen were forced to register the voices of native informants in ideology and heed them in practice even if they despised and misrepresented them.”16 This study works from Bayly’s example, and that of Emmanuelle Sibeud in the French case, in viewing colonial ethnology as growing from locally held ideas and preexisting networks but twisted to maximize colonial value and limit direct attribution to native Africans themselves. French colonial officials did not value African voices above those of other Europeans, but they were forced to make use of data provided by their subjects to describe and reform socioeconomic and political systems in Africa in particular. Understanding the process by which French colonial officials generated ethnological knowledge, and thus the technologies of rule, requires a move beyond the directives of metropolitan government or even colonial governors in African cities.17 A true grasp of these complex interactions requires what Jonathan Wyrtzen has termed a “transactional” approach that avoids a specifically top-down or bottom-up approach.18 Historians must consider the act of collection, translation, and interpretation in order to understand the roots of colonial policy. Anchored in a dialogic understanding of epistemological agency, Gary Wilder provided a useful understanding of the French state as a political and social entity composed of coursing channels of communication that undergirded much colonial science in The French Imperial Nation-State.19 The resultant “political rationality” provides a useful optic for understanding the reconceptualization of the colonial project as a justification of domination within a mutating rubric of civilization and republic. French reformers desired an idealized colonial space, one that incorporated both the universal human rights of early-twentieth-century republicanism and the more heavy-handed developmental approach of the modern, expansive imperial state. Supported by networks of informants, colleagues, and collaborators, the French African sociopolitical apparatus relied heavily on dialogue. The networks supporting those exchanges were rarely neat. The structures of knowledge generation and exchange in French North and West Africa operated not as Foucault’s microphysics of power but as sites for contestation and exchange. Such an understanding reveals the role of mid-level bureaucratic French scholars, in touch with but not privileging local sources as they built analytically informed policy. Tracing interpersonal connections and intellectual choices, however, poses a significant challenge. Each important thinker communicated with thousands of people in his or her lifetime. It is therefore important to isolate these experiences while remaining sensitive to their context, as Thomas Kuhn has suggested.20 Pursuit of a single idea, political association, offers a path through the seemingly infinite connections of any single human life. This approach offers a perspective that transcends national or racial divides, appearing in multiple times, places, and voices. Detailed examination of the lives of the core thinkers who built these ethnological concepts reveals that important ideas emerge from, as sociologist Bruno Latour\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nhas described, a small group of isolated people “so powerful and yet so small, so concentrated and so dilute.”21 Biography, then, offers a methodological window into the origins and effects of colonial ethnology. An understanding of the intertwining lives of these thinkers reveals their enormous political and academic impact as well as their scholarly limitations, collectively and individually. Their lives and experiences were as varied as science itself; generalization risks the loss of nuanced understanding of the causes and effects of these ideas.22 As anthropologist Matei Candea has suggested with respect to Corsica, knowledge exists in the ties between people, places, and stories. The resultant “thick web of relations” stands as the most important object of study for any scholar hoping to describe the ways in which people understand themselves and each other.23 Such an approach also produces difficulties. Describing the appearance and function of these overlapping webs of connection remains problematic; indeed, this requirement has bedeviled most historians of colonial networks. Among the most commonly employed metaphors stand the wheel-spoke and the web.24 The wheel and spoke model locates a significant point, a physical, ideological, or imaginary center around which the other individuals or ideas in the network revolve. Implicit in this idea is the notion of return, with the peripheral players moving between center and exterior regularly. These same players also move between exterior points; thus, the model is dynamic, featuring transit both linearly and centripetally. In the case of efforts by French colonial administrators, soldiers, and scholars to comprehend African social constructions, however, the wheel fails to convey the overlap and interconnection wrought by the colonial state. While it is dynamic, it is also two-dimensional and lacks possibility for growth. A wheel, whether composed of wood, rubber, or aluminum, leaves little room for change. The web, on the other hand, offers an interesting alternative. It can grow almost infinitely; while it has a notional center, that location is not vital to the stability of the structure. Webs, in fact, are most often constructed from the outside to the inside. Ideas or people can move in an almost infinite number of possible directions, increasing the possibility of exchange and offering the explosive opportunities of rapid contact between elements on opposite ends. In the final analysis, though, this model also fails to describe colonial ethnology due to its lack of movement. The web itself rarely stirs (except by the vagaries of external wind), and most items that touch the structure are mired in place. Indeed, the French methods of knowledge production in French Africa, reliant on translation and interpretation, require a more organic description, one that considers human systems as living entities that move and mutate according to the unique logics of the participating individuals. French poststructural theory provides the most appropriate depiction of these types of networks. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, in describing their approach to social and psychological examination as a series of seemingly isolated plateaus connected in almost imperceptible ways, used “rhizome,” a term borrowed from botanical descriptions of root systems. Their application of the term, however, went far beyond the relatively static and hardened nature of tree roots. They wrote, “There are no points or positions in a rhizome, such as those found in a structure, tree, or root. There are only lines.”25 In the case of French African ethnology, soldiers and\n\n6\n\nAnthropology, Colonial Policy and the Decline of French Empire in Africa\n\nadministrators moved along such lines, at times acting as moving nodes that then drew connections to other locations or people in the colonial superstructure. French African intellectual networks made use of what Deleuze and Guattari called “organizations of power” within the rhizome to further both the reach of their understanding and their places in the colonial structure. The ethnological systems thus moved of their own volition, driven not by “the supposed will of an artist or puppeteer” in the centers of power in Paris or Dakar, but rather by “a multiplicity of nerve fibers” both independent and interconnected.26 Representations of human reality grew from the attempted overlaying of the French imperial state, via an associationist model, on scholarship and concepts present in Africa for centuries. French colonial officials did not control these systems; rather, they described the limited results that they understood or to which they had access in often flawed political and ethnological terms. Much like Bayly’s British colonial networks, the systems of intellectual exchange analyzed in this work lay on top of, beneath, and inside of extant African constructions. As Deleuze and Guattari explained, “A rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo … the rhizome is alliance, uniquely alliance.”27 French colonial scholars were firmly “in the middle” of the metropolitan-African relationship. In many cases, particularly for Delafosse and Marty, they served as the interpreters and translators of African history and social construction. They formed alliances with African thinkers and their written chronicles to convey instrumental truth back to the colonial power structure, as these men and women were intimately involved with governance from their positions as conquering soldiers, administrators, advisers, and governors. Unwitting, in many cases, of the real impact of their ideas, these writers, thinkers, and administrators generated networks that would ultimately undo the instruments of colonial rule while revolutionizing European continental social thought. Unraveling this rhizome requires a biographical approach. This study will begin with an examination centered on Louis Faidherbe, a colonial officer for most of his career who served as one of the early governors of the French colony in Senegal and the subject of Chapter 1. Dedicated both to the associationist approach and to the somewhat limited form of anthropology then practiced in metropolitan France, Faidherbe engaged in an exploitative form of study that found little resonance in the academic community. He did, however, have enormous influence on colonial political thought as he passed on his academic methodology to Joseph Gallieni and Hubert Lyautey, future colonial soldiers and governors. The careers of Gallieni, and more importantly Lyautey, ranged from Algeria to Indochina, Madagascar, and ultimately Morocco in reforming the colonial system, events described in the second chapter. In the process, these “proconsuls” instituted a Faidherbe-style political association, one founded on ethnological examination geared toward a policy of “divide and rule” of native social groups. Most notably, these men employed (and exploited) African savants in French Soudan, Madagascar, Algeria, and Morocco in gaining the information necessary to widen these cracks in native social and political structures. These high-ranking military men could only push the associationist approach so far. As the twentieth century progressed through its first decade, French colonial rule matured and required greater academic input to sustain the technologies of rule. Paul\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nMarty, a subordinate of Lyautey, spun the views passed on from Algeria and Morocco back into West Africa, where they met with the similar investigations of Maurice Delafosse, a process described in Chapter 3. More than any other people, these two men selected the political Africa most convenient to colonial rule. Employing vast networks of informants, they obscured those sources through their analysis, delivering a politically convenient view of kinship, race, and Islam as tools of control seemingly grounded in empirical research. Finally finding a foothold in the French academic community, though with limited engagement in the wider Anglophone conversation, Delafosse served as a prime correspondent of Marcel Mauss, preeminent sociologist, and teacher of a new a generation of ethnologists. Chapter 4 focuses on Mauss’ engagement with the theoretical underpinnings of the ideas of his uncle and mentor Emile Durkheim. He broke from the Durkheim school by emphasizing fieldwork, even though he had little experience away from Paris. Mauss’ relativism, informed by colonial ethnographic data, thus reshaped French social theory and pushed it in a new direction, away from the metropole and toward the colonies themselves. Hardly honoring native African sources, he extolled the power of colonial investigation as an important justification for colonial rule itself, generating intellectual and financial capital in a mutually reinforcing relationship with the teetering colonial state in the 1930s and 1940s. Chapter 5 follows this sustainment to its logical political conclusion in the person of Jacques Soustelle, a Mauss student and the governor-general of Algeria in 1955–1956. Built on the ethnological principles espoused by Mauss and the political approach of Lyautey, Soustelle implemented a system of ethnological surveillance, believing that he could mitigate the causes of the nascent revolt through a resolutely internal study of the populace which, much to his later regret, largely ignored international trends and the more corrosive effects of his rule. Thus, he underestimated, and at times dismissed, the young, largely secular elites who had developed a sophisticated rhetoric that refused colonial cooperation in terms appropriated from nationalist, pan-Arab, and pan-Islamic movements. Ultimately frustrated with the lack of Algerian progress, Soustelle fell victim to temptation, permitting his forces to use torture and increased military force in a doomed effort to quell the rebellion. Into that breach stepped a young conscript named Pierre Bourdieu, the subject of Chapter 6, who was deeply contemptuous of his surroundings and became disenchanted with the contradictions of the colonial system. His new sociology stood in direct contrast to the structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss. Bourdieu’s focus on contingency both in information collection and in human social development through the concept of habitus offered an important counterpoint to the long-standing insularity of the French colonial intellectual space. Only through reflexivity could sociologists truly probe their own biases; only through a similar selfexamination could the French state realize its own culpability in the African condition.\n\nNote on terminology, translation, and transcription This is a work, at least in part, about translation. It is thus focused on works in translation as they influenced colonial policy making and the development of French ethnology and sociology as broader social sciences. The sources of that ethnology are important\n\n8\n\nAnthropology, Colonial Policy and the Decline of French Empire in Africa\n\nand called out frequently here, but not exhaustively. Instead, this study follows French thought through its representations in colonial ethnology and the resultant limitations, understanding that future work must further unspool the sources of knowledge among native African thinkers themselves. At the same time, my own choices in translation from the French can be difficult in such a fraught subject. In the case of this study, I have chosen to employ the word “native” to mean those Africans (usually black sub-Saharans, but also at times including residents of Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, or Madagascar) born locally and subject to colonial domination when the specific group described by the French colonial author remains unclear. The term “Africans,” while perhaps preferable to “native” as lacking in pejorative colonial connotation, carried a different meaning in the French colonial world, as French colonial soldiers were collectively and colloquially known by that same moniker. Likewise, the word “Algerian,” particularly in the nineteenth century, often denoted French soldiers in Algeria. Arab or Berber groups in Algeria were generally known as “Muslims,” but that term failed to capture the full range of socioreligious constructions actually in use at the time. The terms “autochthon” and “indigenous” are far too weighted with meaning, as they overlook the swirls of migration across Africa, themselves so important for the ethnologists profiled in this study. “Local,” while perhaps a useful descriptor in some ways, overlooks the important colonial distinctions, especially in Algeria, between French settlers, many of whom were born in Algeria by the late nineteenth century, and Arabs, Berbers, and Jews, to name the three largest non-French appellations. I have done my best to use “African” or more specific terms, such as “Kabyle” or “Peul,” when the context makes it clear that the actors are in fact those people from Africa, not European settlers or soldiers. The spelling and transliteration of literary Arabic words, proper names, and places follows the system used by the International Journal of Middle East Studies. I have avoided the use of diacritics to the greatest extent possible. I have left the original French transcriptions and accent marks, which differ at times from more recent usage, only when changing them would alter the flow of the phrase or change the spelling in the title of a published work. All translations from the French are mine unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes. Any errors that remain are my own.\n\n1\n\nLouis Faidherbe and the Construction of Intellectual Networks\n\nL’honneur: tu l’emportas en tous lieux, Général C’était ton bien sacré, c’était ton ideal, Il te guidait comme une étoile Et tu le gardas là, cet honneur pur et cher, Ainsi qu tu l’avais gardé dans le desert Sous ta rude tente de toile1\n\n—Lille, October 25, 1896\n\nWith the erection of a new statue to a hero of France, poet Charles Manso stepped forward to honor the legendary figure. General Louis-Léon-César Faidherbe had died seven years before, but now stood resurrected in stone. His legacy, however, did not end with carved granite; rather, he stood as the progenitor of a network of colonial information transfer that began in Algeria and extended through Africa and beyond, as far as Indochina and Madagascar, across the vast majority of the French colonial world. His 1854–1865 governorship of Senegal, France’s first sub-Saharan African colony, gained rather informally in the early nineteenth century, earned him a similar colonial statue in Dakar in the early twentieth century.2 An early proponent of an associationist political structure, Faidherbe’s influence also extended into science. In particular, Faidherbe engaged with ethnology and the shortlived discipline of physicalracial anthropology and ushered in an era of intellectually prominent colonial military officers.3 These officers became part of a knowledge-oriented method of colonial governance. In so doing, they fostered an environment of increasing openness featuring opportunities for advancement not only in the military realm but also in academia and politics. By focusing on native contributions to ethnological and civilizational understanding, Faidherbe propagated the associationist emphasis on maintenance and respect of native structures. Implicit in this paradigm was some basic respect for native intellectual capabilities; more than simple savages, Faidherbe saw natives as intelligent interpreters and agents of their own social reality. They were thus worthy of dialogue with the French on this social state of affairs and the way forward in improving their condition. Nonetheless, he rarely credited their contributions as he continued to develop an exploitative colonial state, one that often looked across the French colonial structure and rarely acknowledged events outside its relatively narrow sphere.\n\n10\n\nAnthropology, Colonial Policy and the Decline of French Empire in Africa\n\nFaidherbe did not exist apart from the colonial structure. He was very much a part of French efforts to classify and dominate racialized groups in Africa. From his earliest moments in Algeria, the young officer tried to apply the racial-determinist models of his anthropological peers. He saw his participation in anthropology as a crusade of sorts, an effort to “remedy the bad that compromises the future”4 for Africans trapped in an undeveloped past. A former president of the prestigious Société d’anthropologie de Paris, Faidherbe pointed to the importance of this crusade for “courageous truth.”5 For his contemporaries, Faidherbe’s work “was not confined to military labors” but found in the realms “of science, of letters, of philosophy … new ways to honor [his] nation.”6 From his position as the father of a network of information transfer, of circulation, Faidherbe stood astride the anthropological and military communities, exerting an influence in both “the nation and science.”7 He was not only a “military man and administrator who also found the time to interest himself in science” but an academic noted for his contributions to “historical, linguistic, geographical, and anthropological knowledge.”8 Anthropology, as practiced at the time, did not offer sufficient data to the colonial project in his mind. He thus devoted himself to ethnology, the comparative study of societies (often referred to as races) that employed ethnography as an important tool. This form of study avoided the physical measurements so important to the zoologists and anatomists, who dominated anthropology in the mid-nineteenth century. The French colonial empire offered avenues for military and academic advancement that simply did not exist in Europe. France’s previous effort at colonial expansion from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries had ended in catastrophic failure. Defeated by the British in the Seven Years War, France lost all of its North American colonies, holding on to the islands of Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Saint-Domingue (Haiti) in the Caribbean as the sole talismans of lost preeminence and global rivalry. While the American Revolution offered a brief hope of the end of British overseas domination, in truth France spiraled downward into an inescapable cycle of debt and discontent, culminating in the chaos of the French Revolution after 1789. After losing SaintDomingue to successive revolts in the early nineteenth century, the glory of French overseas civilization seemed past to many observers. Further expansion, inspired in part by the revolutionary fervor of the Napoleonic period, recommenced outside of Europe only in 1830 in Algeria as the dying Bourbon regime of Charles X tried to hold on to domestic legitimacy through foreign conquest, ultimately failing as it was replaced by Louis-Philippe’s new monarchy. Imbued in many cases with utopian expectations of new societies in Africa, the soldiers involved in these conquests sought both to understand and to govern their new territory in Algeria, a campaign initiated in 1830 and contested especially from 1832 to 1847. In seeking such ethnological knowledge, Faidherbe tapped into the existing networks of ethnographic knowledge already resident in Africa to develop his view of conditions on that continent. He thus grew these networks of organic intellectual life, linking them with each other and the metropole through a skilled manipulation of publication outlets, military and colonial communication channels, and scholarly societies. In the process, he hardened colonial political structures and enhanced his own academic reputation, sometimes at the expense of others working in the field. In the conduct of such a study, he looked for inspiration to the bureaux arabes, founded\n\nLouis Faidherbe and Intellectual Networks\n\n11\n\nin 1844 by General Thomas-Robert Bugeaud in Algeria and the forerunner of French structures that culminated in what Martin Thomas has termed the “intelligence states” of the early twentieth century, an approach inherited by Hubert Lyautey in Morocco.9 These military-led offices conducted ethnological investigations of the countryside and aided in communication with native groups at the grassroots level. Accused by some French settlers of Arabophilia, this cadre of native affairs officers, by and large, advocated for a form of “indirect rule” similar to the associationist ideas of Faidherbe. In conquests of West African states, Faidherbe and his subordinates pioneered the use of outposts employing skilled Arabic speakers, immersing in local political norms and communicating in the complex, hybridized exchange between Hausa, Peul, and other languages with Arabic.10 By 1871, however, these officers had lost the battle in Algeria, overcome by civilian settlers and politicians who argued that the maintenance of preexisting “tribal” structures went against the egalitarian spirit of the French Revolution and disadvantaged settlers as a group. The institution nonetheless served as an example for Faidherbe of politically motivated social reform via military ethnological investigation and management.11 Regardless of source, each contact added to the size of the Faidherbe’s vast network of networks, creating connections across and below the surface of the colonial enterprise.\n\nEducation of a reformer Louis Faidherbe grew up in an industrializing town in the north of France. His father served as a sergeant major in a revolutionary national guard regiment and later settled into life as a haberdasher.12 Academically gifted, Faidherbe attended prestigious preparatory schools and ultimately earned a place at the center for “diffusing Cartesianism throughout French society,” the école polytechnique.13 The future soldier entered the school during a transitional period. In the forty years prior to Faidherbe’s arrival, it had been the primary site for discussion of the utopian ideals of Henri SaintSimon and his disciples, Prosper Enfantin and Auguste Comte. In 1826, Enfantin had written to a colleague on the importance of the école to the Saint-Simonian movement, referring to the school as the “channel by which these ideas [of positivism and industrial advancement] reproduce in society; it is the milk that we have sucked from our dear school that will nourish the generations to come.”14 While many of the proponents of these philosophical currents had moved on by Faidherbe’s entrance in the summer of 1838, their influence was still strong in the military at large. In fact, Faidherbe would cross paths with several Saint-Simonians in Algeria in his early career.15 While not imbued with the revolutionary sentiment of some of these theorists, Faidherbe did place great value in firsthand observation, a core idea in Comtean positivism. Faidherbe also imbibed the principles of liberal republicanism that he would try to spread to non-Frenchmen throughout his career.16 Faidherbe graduated in 1840 as one of twenty lieutenants to enter military engineering, one of the most demanding and sought-after fields of specialization.17 In his assignment to colonial service, he followed in the tradition of preceding polytechniciens, who made use of the “versatility” of their academic training to develop and manipulate\n\n12\n\nAnthropology, Colonial Policy and the Decline of French Empire in Africa\n\nscholarly networks in the colonies. For example, prominent alumni founded the Société archéologique de Constantine and the Société historique d’Alger.18 From his time in Algeria forward, Faidherbe participated in many of these organizations founded by fellow école graduates and military officers. Through this involvement, he encountered the long history of North Africa. At first a mystery to the young officer, the area would become central to Faidherbe’s understanding of colonial rule as he gained contacts throughout the region.\n\nEarly colonial experience: Construction of an understanding Following engineering training in France, Faidherbe moved on to his first military assignment in an Algeria still in the throes of violent resistance to French colonial rule, a rebellion led by Abd al-Qadir that would continue until 1847. The years 1844– 1846 saw Faidherbe serving as part of a suppression campaign under the command of General Thomas-Robert Bugeaud. While he and his commander likely had very little direct contact, Faidherbe ultimately developed views similar to those of his military superior. Bugeaud was famed for his willingness to consider what would later become known as the “hearts and minds” of the Arabs, attempting to win them over even as he ordered mass executions of rebel bands and the burning of entire villages. He famously raced into the street, undressed and unshaven, to subdue and arrest a Maltese he saw mercilessly beating an Arab.19 Likewise, Faidherbe, in letters to his mother, contrasted the “majesty,” “gravity,” and “intelligent bearing” of the Arabs he encountered with his understanding that Algeria required a “war of extermination,” as “one dead Arab means two fewer Frenchmen assassinated.”20 Algeria thus presented Faidherbe with the impossible duality of the colonial situation. He could see both the humanist possibilities of a colonialism that considered native methods as useful and valuable in their own right and the terrible brutality required to “pacify” a hostile population. Faidherbe’s subsequent assignment to Guadeloupe pushed him further down the humanist, associationist path. During this period, Faidherbe may have met Victor Schoelcher, famed abolitionist and senator in the new French government; in any case, the officer developed a strong relationship with the crusading reformer, ultimately dedicating his last work (1889) to “Mister Schoelcher, Senator, ex-member of the Provisional Government of 1848 … beloved teacher and old colleague.”21 Whether inspired by this relationship or by the poor conditions on the island, Faidherbe made a rapid transition from unremarkable officer to one with significant insight on native populations. Although listed as having no discernible linguistic skills in 1847, his evaluation of 1848 described his knowledge of languages, which he “studied voluntarily,” indicating that he “knows a little Italian and Spanish.” He also impressed his superior with his learning in “geology and natural history.” This 1848 report also reflected the superior’s perspective on Faidherbe’s political views: “Inclined towards socialism … can be easily impassioned by radical opinions—must be kept on the straight path by good advice.”22 The young captain, far from toeing the party line, had undergone a transformation seemingly overnight. He saw language as the gateway\n\nLouis Faidherbe and Intellectual Networks\n\n13\n\nto a deeper understanding of native societies, insight that would enable better, more human colonial rule. His superiors had come to see him as a potential opponent of conservative colonial institutions. Faidherbe’s expansive mind grew beyond basic improvement and trendy theories of social reform. At some point in his early career, the young officer compiled an extensive notebook with translations of poetry into thirty-one languages and dialects, including Berber, Arabic, and Guadeloupian Créole.23 These notebooks do not reflect fluency in all of these languages; however, they do show an increased interest in and familiarity with foreign societies. It seems unlikely that Faidherbe acquired this language skill in a single year; rather, his earlier work had probably not attracted the attention of his superiors, who focused more on his shortcomings. Maturing rapidly both professionally and intellectually, he developed a taste for new ideas on social composition and order even as he worked hard to expand his ear for languages, ideas he would combine later in his career, particularly in Senegal. Upon his return to France, now speaking “a little Arabic,” the young officer spent much of his time “in the study of languages.”24 After his recovery, he returned to the center—for him—of all things ethnological and political, Algeria. While there, he could apply both his newfound language skills and his broader perspective on colonial rule. His subsequent experience in Algeria, followed almost immediately by prominence in Senegal, allowed him to mold a number of individuals ready to follow his leadership. In the process he would reorient the production and sharing of colonial knowledge, encompassing groups both in the metropole and in Africa.\n\nAlgeria: Building local understanding Faidherbe’s return to Algeria in 1849 coincided with the explosion of a new revolt. This time the resistance came not from the traditionally demonized Arab tribes, but instead from the respected Berbers of the Kabylia region in the Aurès Mountains. The revolt would serve as the centerpiece of Faidherbe’s tour in the colony, as he would spend much of his time fighting in the area.25 French Algeria had also become intellectually vibrant, as the Faculté de Lettres in Algiers developed new colonial scholars in following the lead of General Bugeaud, who had founded the first Algerian society for arts and letters in 1847.26 Now more senior and with considerable colonial experience, Faidherbe found himself a valued member of the French effort in an area that offered opportunity for academic study. In fact, he was given command of the construction of an outpost at Bou Saada in late 1849, earning praise from General Jean-Baptiste Philibert Vaillant, formerly Faidherbe’s commandant at the école polytechnique, now inspector general of the army in Algeria, in an 1851 report. Vaillant cited Faidherbe for “true valor” for his role in combat operations where he had engaged in direct clashes with the rebellious Berbers despite his nominal role as a rear-echelon engineer.27 Now viewed as courageous and honorable in both bourgeois and military circles, Faidherbe escaped the marginal ratings he had received earlier in his career. He was living an “honorable life” according to the French bourgeois customs of the time. In the colonial milieu, that distinction became all the more important as a mark to set himself\n\n14\n\nAnthropology, Colonial Policy and the Decline of French Empire in Africa\n\napart from both his subordinate soldiers and the supposedly primitive natives against whom he fought. He thus began to compile the “charisma” that would later enable him to reach great heights in the French colonial bureaucracy.28 Now judged as a competent and perhaps even above-average soldier, Faidherbe was able to spend more time on native study. He could work harder to understand native social constructions because he had covered himself in what his contemporaries saw as heroic glory. Martial success gave him a buffer from close oversight; he was free to develop his intellectual capabilities and discover those of his subjects. Faidherbe applied this freedom to work toward a better understanding of what was required to pacify the restive region. His experience had shown him both sides of the colonial method. He concluded that subjugation of rebellious natives required a combination of local ethnic and linguistic understanding, on the one hand, and the iron will to impose harsh sanctions, on the other. These opposing methods appeared in Faidherbe’s correspondence much as they characterized the action in his first Algerian tour in the 1840s. In March of 1850, Faidherbe described Bou Saada as “rather debauched like all the towns of the desert” but presented a nearby valley in 1851 in very different terms: “I have not yet seen an area as beautiful and rich as this one, even in Europe … one finds a beautiful village at each turn.” Faidherbe was torn by these two seemingly contradictory approaches to colonialism: benevolent humanism and violent repression/destruction. Algerian villages like those depicted in Faidherbe’s correspondence would at times fall victim to military necessity as they were burned and the residents executed in summary fashion by Algerian natives fighting for the French, known as tirailleurs.29 By promoting the employment of native troops, Faidherbe initiated a new era of French colonial warfare. Such tactics did not end in Algeria; indeed, he formed similar units in his time as governor of Senegal.30 In the officer’s mind, the use of violence must differ with location and circumstance; he believed that his combination of local knowledge and commitment to understand tempered the need for the destructive razzia raiding parties favored by many French officers in the conquest of the Sahara.31 Instead, he understood the value of the show of force, employing small military parties to travel into the interior and speak to native leaders. He rejected the implicit assumptions of his peers in Algeria and the Sahara, who saw native groups as simple and unsophisticated obstacles to rapid conquest. Small expeditions, Faidherbe believed, would deliver native political allegiance to the French colonial state by displaying the humanity and knowledge of the colonial occupier. Expanding these contacts would also help Faidherbe to increase his store of local information. From this localized data, he could discover, exploit, and then resolve intranative political disputes in favor of expanded French mediation and control. Local understanding grew not from abstract study, but from dialogue in the native language, a pursuit to which Faidherbe dedicated himself in Africa. Faidherbe worked hard on Arabic during this period, remarking to his mother that he “every day made new progress in Arab as I do not hear anything else spoken.” At the same time, the young officer developed a rudimentary ethnographic method that involved basic observation. He infused this system of observation with value judgments based on the perceived developmental position of native groups. He spent time\n\nLouis Faidherbe and Intellectual Networks\n\n15\n\nat a “Moorish café” near Bou Saada, observing the “savage” activities of the local tribesmen and their dancing girls.32 He defined savagery, in this case, as the stunted moral development that enabled these nomads to consider women as dancing possessions and sexual objects. Faidherbe’s tenure in Algeria coincided with the first full French translations of Ibn Khaldun’s universal history, the greatest exposition of medieval Arabic political philosophy and development that considered nomadism a necessary precursor to more developed and sedentary “civilization.”33 Faidherbe thus encountered Khaldunian thought directly: “Let us look at civilization, born in the fields and ending with the foundation of cities and trending strongly towards this end. As soon as the people of the country acquired this level of well-being and luxury … they allowed themselves to adopt the sedentary lifestyle.”34 Rural life preceded urban life but could not withstand the allure of greater leisure, wealth, and prestige eventually offered by cities. The nomadic desert-dwellers possessed a war-like spirit; their bravery gave them the ability to conquer others. These “savage peoples,” for all their martial strength, improved when they came into contact “with a more advanced civilization” and eventually abandoned the pastoral lifestyle. A sedentary existence remained far superior to its nomadic equivalent.35 However, no achievement ensured permanent strength. The agricultural lifestyle over time created occupational social classes that eventually hardened into immutable castes unable to mix with each other.36 Inevitably, these advanced urban centers crumbled with the onset of decay and excess. While it represented the height of human development, urban life could not last, as it also caused civilizations “to stop and to become corrupted.” Societal change halted with the assumption of a life of luxury; in a cyclical fashion, the civilization “began to retrograde … to fall into decrepitude” and returned to its natural state, ready to reinitiate the cycle.37 Faidherbe saw himself as an important conduit in this Khaldunian cycle of intellectual advancement. In collaboration with like-minded native and French intellectuals engaged in the colonial project, he sought to associate with and develop African social and political groups while employing their focused intellectual sophistication. He thus turned to a variety of other groups to better understand African social structures. Faidherbe set a new standard for rule by ethnological investigation, one invariably turned inward on the local inhabitants and their seminal social texts and away from the lived violence of the colonial state and the turbulence of European-dominated world affairs. Tribal affiliations and genealogies served as vital sources for this understanding, particularly if they displayed connections to groups in Algeria “of whom we have an intimate knowledge today.”38 Faidherbe’s early articles on the interactions between Berbers, Arabs, and blacks served as continuing references for him; over time, he made marginal notes on many of them. In some of these scribblings, he credited the Arab writers Ibn Battuta, Ibn Khaldun, and Muhammad Bello with providing useful information on the chains of political leadership and academic learning that shaped social life in the Maghreb.39 As early as 1855 he discussed his time spent in “researching geographical and historical ideas on Central Africa in the Arab authors of the middle ages in order to reconstitute the history of these countries.”40 He quoted from Ibn Khaldun in numerous instances, particularly regarding the Yemeni origins and movement of Arab tribes and the intermixing of the Hassanid Arabs and the Senhadja Berbers.41\n\n16\n\nAnthropology, Colonial Policy and the Decline of French Empire in Africa\n\nLocally authored manuscripts served an important role as well, as they could assist in isolating and eliminating the bias of Christian and Muslim sources. Faidherbe saw value in the maintenance of knowledge “lost from view in Europe” but maintained in the “manuscript chronicles of the marabouts of the Adrar.”42 Direct examination of African societies, however, could supplement the strength of these documentary sources. His time in Algeria saw the rise and at least the beginning of the fall of the bureaux arabes, offices and officers dedicated to understanding Algeria in ethnographic and geographic terms. These local native affairs offices, officially eliminated with the rise of civilian government in Algeria after 1870, persisted until the early twentieth century in outlying regions despite accusations of corruption. Officers of the bureaux, focused on direct observation and the outlining of “moral topography,” in particular conducted detailed studies of the Sufi Islamic brotherhoods so central to later French scholarship.43 Although the bureaux studies were somewhat limited in their scope and insight into religious institutions, they still proved valuable to Faidherbe. Conducted largely by untrained French soldiers, these writings offered Faidherbe important insight into the social and political landscape, key in his mind to the promotion of “controlled association.” This concept depicted societies at different political stages deserving specifically tailored colonial measures.44 Faidherbe’s view grew in importance in the 1850s and 1860s in light of the accession of Napoleon III and the declaration of the Second Empire in 1851. The emperor’s conception of an “Arab kingdom” in North Africa jibed closely with Faidherbe’s ideas of association and lent credence to his calls for administration by local political structures.45 Convinced of the effectiveness of the intellectual interaction of military ethnologists and native savants but hoping to avoid the excesses of soldiers hungry for power away from the French Algerian center of military and political authority, Faidherbe instituted the bureau model in Senegal. He hired officers with language ability in the Direction des Affaires Politiques (DAP), an organization that conducted detailed ethnographic surveys of the local area with the assistance of Muslim scholars.46 While Faidherbe did not model Senegal on Algeria politically, he viewed the North African space as a point of reference, important in understanding future colonial undertakings.\n\nFaidherbe N’Diaye: Building an ethnological colony in Senegal In 1852, on the heels of his early Algerian deployments, Faidherbe gained transfer to Senegal. He had written the minister of the marine and colonies, an acquaintance from Guadeloupe, to request the move. Senegal offered an opportunity to develop his anthropological acumen in a less restrictive environment while avoiding the prying eyes and increasingly long reach of the French colonial Algerian administration. Senegal offered what amounted to a blank slate in Faidherbe’s mind, the perfect location to implement and test his ideas on colonial rule that respected and incorporated native institutions. He could do this in something of a vacuum, untainted by international affairs and turned inward on the colony and its people. The area, first frequented by Portuguese traders as early as the fifteenth century, had slowly come under French control by the early nineteenth century. Saint Louis, where the Senegal River emptied\n\nLouis Faidherbe and Intellectual Networks\n\n17\n\ninto the Atlantic Ocean, served as the primary base for French trading into the interior. However, few French administrators of the area had considered further conquest; it seemed enough to participate in and correspond with the existing local trade networks. Faidherbe, searching for a greater name for himself and expanded commercial territory and political control for France, saw the area as ripe for colonial growth. The region had not suffered the privations of the French conquest of Algeria in 1830; it was relatively unstained by colonial warfare, offering native populations still employing their own unique political and social forms. Faidherbe’s first Senegalese residency culminated in assignment as chief of engineers in Saint Louis. From this position of authority and drawing on his previous combat experience, Faidherbe participated in a number of expeditions into the interior, also concluding some rudimentary ethnological studies. At some point in this period, Faidherbe came to the attention of the Maurel family, a powerful Bordeaux trading clan that held a controlling interest in French Senegalese trade. Interested in a man willing to venture into the interior in search of developmental contacts, the Maurels saw Faidherbe as a potential ally. Following him into the interior, they reasoned, could yield significant new opportunities for economic growth and exploitation. Influenced by these business interests, the new minister of marine and colonies recommended Faidherbe for the governorship in 1854. In his note to the minister of war, the colonial director pointed to Faidherbe’s “remarkable intelligence” and “special experience” in Algeria as important factors in his selection. Although Faidherbe was relatively junior, the minister of war, his old commandant and commander, Jean Vaillant, ultimately granted the request in August of 1854, making Faidherbe a major and the governor of the French colony.47 By all accounts, Faidherbe was quite pleased to find himself in Senegal, particularly in a position of such power. In a break from his predecessors, he fashioned himself as a native of sorts, going to ceremonies such as weddings or baptisms in local dress and earning a nickname employing a common local surname: “Faidherbe N’Diaye.”48 He also took a local wife, in the fashion of some colonial administrators, learning several languages from her, including Wolof. Diokounda Sidibé likely bore several children to Faidherbe and certainly served as a key player in the network of local informants the governor would develop to facilitate the growth and consolidation of French rule in the area.49 At the same time, their relationship symbolized the power Faidherbe exercised over both the colony and his ethnographic informants, leaving his Senegalese subjects as virtual servants to his political and sexual power.50 Nevertheless, Faidherbe exploited these contacts to develop networks of likeminded intellectuals, both French and native, who contributed greatly to the success of his gubernatorial administration. He later listed the greatest accomplishments of his first five years as governor (1854–1859) as the creation of a government printing office (1855), the founding of the Moniteur du Sénégal (1856), the creation of a battalion of tirailleurs sénégalais (1857), and the organization of an interpreter corps (1857).51 Not surprisingly, Faidherbe placed great weight on any measure that expanded the French power base and aided in administration. Successful governance required talented subordinates from all corners of colonial society, both native and French. These thinkers could grow in capability and stature through intellectual interaction both in\n\n18\n\nAnthropology, Colonial Policy and the Decline of French Empire in Africa\n\nthe colonies and the metropole itself. Through these networks, Faidherbe thought to solidify the regime in Senegal while gaining an empire-wide dissemination of his ideas on colonial association. He promoted the intellectual growth of his subordinates by pushing them to publish in the daily Moniteur du Sénégal or in the more prestigious Revue Maritime et Coloniale, published by the Ministry of the Navy and Colonies in Paris from 1861 to 1868. Most of the articles printed in this journal included ethnographic descriptions completed during military campaigns or voyages of exploration or diplomatic negotiation with native political elites.52 Publication in the journal brought the Senegalese exploits of Faidherbe and his officers to the attention of French political leaders at the ministerial level in Paris and across the colonies as a whole. The African descriptions they provided in the journal, notionally mediated by ministry officials in Paris, thus gained official sanction. Faidherbe thereby grew his network beyond the bounds of the Senegalese colony, beyond even the African continent. He gained support for his form of investigation and rule through the tacit governmental support of his techniques conferred by official printing. His efforts to grow a strong group of subordinates did not end there. He expressly included natives in his administration, giving them publication and educational opportunities as well. He planned to spread French in the Senegalese interior, hoping to supplant Arabic as the second language by creating a Francophonic elite. Arabic, by the 1850s, was the language of revolt, employed by the jihadist states then challenging his authority. Employing his knowledge of the Arabic language and the power of Arabic sources in Africa, the governor actively sought to minimize the language’s reach and importance so as to enable colonial control. To that end, he published the Moniteur du Sénégal and the Annuaire du Sénégal, both focused on history and anthropology, entirely in French.53 In order to make these publications successful, though, Faidherbe had to create an elite group of native administrators and scholars capable of publishing in French and appealing to a readership composed of other French-speaking colonial elites, both native and French. He necessarily turned to education as the first step. While decrying “cruel and intolerant fanaticism,” Faidherbe provided funds to Qur’anic schools in the hope of improving primary education for Muslims.54 He thus undermined some Islamic elements that sought to reestablish a Caliphate and reject the French by offering official legitimization of Franco-Arabic combinations. At the same time, the Islamic model of education provided a point of entry to the African intellectual world. Islamic teachers were already in place and spread widely; their techniques and curricula needed only the impetus added by the inclusion of French perspectives on the modern world. Drawing on his previous experience, Faidherbe proposed a primary education structure that would “imitate that which is done in Algeria,” a similar approach with combined Islamic education and European methods.55 Faidherbe thought that graduates of these schools, imbued with the spirit and language of the modern European world, would then go on to serve as important interpreters of social reality and leaders of a new colonial order. From this strong foundation, Faidherbe could pick and choose the members of his network. In that spirit he took over Saint Louis secondary education from a missionary order and created the école des otages, an effort to discourage anti-French revolts by\n\nLouis Faidherbe and Intellectual Networks\n\n19\n\nholding sons of local chiefs in French territory as educational “hostages.” Faidherbe said he hoped to “create some elite locals to aid us in our civilizational work and to ensure at the same time the recruitment of interpreters for the diverse languages of the country.”56 These new elites could serve two purposes in his mind: the furtherance of French occupation and colonization as well as the growth and dissemination of a body of ethnographic knowledge of the area that would feed back into the colonial effort. From this historical and ethnographic understanding, Faidherbe believed that French administrators could devise the proper program to increase French support of preexisting African institutions. The inclusion of this local detail would enable and deliver a more human and humane form of governance contrary to the violent excesses Faidherbe had seen in Algeria. Faidherbe claimed immediate success in this venture, as his school boasted graduates or students from virtually all of the French-controlled areas of the Senegal River basin by 1859.57 The school did more than teach; in Faidherbe’s words, it transformed students “in terms of education, ideas, [and] tendencies,” particularly those who had lived “without having developed a full understanding and feeling of affection for France.”58 Alumni would then serve as colonial functionaries. They were vital in countering the complaints of urban and detached French colonial administrators in Saint Louis, who lamented, “certain locals desired that the French authorities remain ignorant of things in the country.” Such complaints rang hollow with Faidherbe, as these social interpreters were vital to associationist thought. Local schools aided in understanding and thereby manipulating the social and political structures found in Senegal. He reported that 103 students attended the school during his tenure, with 56 proving “useful” to the colony. Eleven became local chiefs, while nine served as interpreters, two died in French military uniform, and numerous others served on merchant vessels, in colonial government, or as local leaders.59 Faidherbe’s African network included a number of native administrators who contributed to his governorship and his ethnological knowledge. In particular, Faidherbe relied on his corps of interpreters not only for their language skill but also for their diplomatic know-how and access to local intelligence. Faidherbe’s chief translators worked closely with local officials on ethnological research and administration. Each had enormous Islamic credibility as local tamsir and marabout with experience in the Sahara, particularly Morocco and Algeria, in Arabia, and even in continental Europe.60 These men played key roles in the development and maintenance of contacts between the French government and local religious and political leaders. They were so successful and well connected that they continued as government translators beyond Faidherbe into the tenure of his successor. African intellectual middlemen informed the expansion efforts of the governor and were critical to the efforts of Joseph Gallieni, a succeeding director of the DAP.61 Faidherbe’s efforts to employ local notables for political association also included an academic component. Yaro Diao, among the first graduates of the école des otages, left his position as a chief to compile the first study of Wolof oral traditions for the Moniteur du Sénégal.62 Descended from an old noble family, Diao worked initially from notes compiled from his father’s oral sagas. He intended these notes purely as mnemonic devices, but ultimately recognized their importance as a general history\n\n20\n\nAnthropology, Colonial Policy and the Decline of French Empire in Africa\n\nof the Senegal River basin from 1200 to 1800. His work came to form the basis of twentieth-century academic work on Senegalese history; his studies appeared in numerous journals with the assistance and editing skill of acclaimed French ethnographer and folklorist Arnold van Gennep as well as French colonial academics and administrators Henri Gaden and Maurice Delafosse.63 Unfortunately, Yaro Diao was something of an aberration; few of Faidherbe’s subordinates gained real academic prominence and instead served as silent contributors to his efforts. Even as early as the 1850s, native African savants contributed to the generation of ethnological knowledge in West Africa in this limited way. From such information, Faidherbe began to piece together the history of the area, allowing him to see the swirling interconnections of peoples in local sociopolitical entities. In dealing with this complexity, Faidherbe had long conceived of the Sahara as the key to African economic and social development as an ancient site of transport and exchange. The Sahel in particular hosted a remarkable mix of groups coded by the natives themselves as “white” and “black” according to a long-standing calculus of genealogy, Islamic heritage, and socioeconomic class.64 Once in place in Senegal, Faidherbe saw the border between his new and old duty locations in Algeria and along the Sahel as offering an important view into the socioeconomic complexity of African societies. To that end he wrote to the Paris geographical society in 1853, his first year in Senegal, to request the body’s support to take “several steps in geography and ethnology,” an interest he indicated as “one of the principal motivations that drove me to request assignment in Senegal.” He took a particular interest in the “Moors” of the right bank of the Senegal river (then the northern edge of French advance in the area), describing them as an “Arab-Berber mixture.” He requested help from the society in formulating a research agenda dedicated to understanding what he thought of as an odd cohabitation of “victors and vanquished” in the area, a reference to the centuriesold story of Arab conquerors from North Africa subjugating the Berbers, who then developed new positions as a clerical class. This view descended from a generation of French Algerian scholarship and the medieval analysis offered by Ibn Khaldun.65 Building on older Greek and Arabic philosophical works, Ibn Khaldun had written of Sahelian and sub-Saharan blacks as inhabitants of the equatorial zone in an overall scheme of racial and intellectual characteristics tied to latitude, as “living in savage isolation and devouring each other.”66 This isolation, which was also ironically present in the ethnological approach of Faidherbe and his successors, in part explained African primitivity; these peoples were far from the civilizing effects of Islam and the urban lifestyle of the littoral. They could hope to improve only through mixing with other groups. As an example, Ibn Khaldun pointed to the Arabs, originally “a race of looters and brigands” living a nomadic lifestyle and acting as an obstacle to the “progress of civilization.” They advanced to a higher developmental level only by a total change in societal construction, as “the sedentary lifestyle is favorable to the progress of civilization.”67 Arab genealogists could make important claims to descent from early Islamic families, but they could not deny the importance of the infusion of non-Arab blood. Though lacking in nuance, this analysis proved influential for Faidherbe as he searched for originary sociopolitical structures.\n\nLouis Faidherbe and Intellectual Networks\n\n21\n\nThis same 1854 issue of the geographical journal hosted Faidherbe’s first scholarly contribution regarding the Moors, who he saw as an “errant and miserable” combination of Arabs and Berbers.68 He portrayed the mix as unnatural in a linguistic sense and with respect to the Berber conversion to Islam, an event he painted as superficial and expedient. He did not stop with a basic analysis of these “white” groups. Over the next ten years, he spent much of his time in deciphering the results of black and white interaction. He paid particular attention to the migrations of “whites” and “blacks” in sub-Saharan Africa. Like many of the French savants who would follow, he attempted to understand the Peul (Fulbé) people, who seemed to sit astride the black/white divide. He attributed their presence in the West African Sahel to a longago migration from Egypt while also describing them as “more open to civilization.”69 The mixing of white and black civilizational groups, north and south, occurred for several reasons in Faidherbe’s analysis: the caravan trade, which enabled movement between North and West Africa across the Sahara; the commerce in black slaves; and the repeated military conquests of the North African littoral, from the Phoenicians to the French.70 Far from a negative, Faidherbe viewed the product of these liaisons as useful, stating that the Moors could survive only with “an infusion of blood of a young and vigorous negress” as the “star of the Berbers and the Arabs” fell. These unions produced “moral and intellectual progress” as the blacks converted to Islam, maintaining “good native qualities” while rejecting the “inherent vices of Islamism.”71 This new social grouping would combine all of the best aspects of local groups, in the end delivering a people ready to accept and participate in the colonial project. In this model, the French could assist the process by battling the Tuareg and other “savage and ferocious hordes of the desert” who, in Faidherbe’s mind, wanted only to convert and radicalize their southern neighbors.72 Blacks in this case had not been tainted by radical Islam. Blacks, simple but full of potential, would revive decadent North and West African groups to a state more amenable to colonial interface. Faidherbe believed that the social and intellectual elites who emerged from this racial mixture would lead Africans in a more benevolent French colonial structure. Islamism, which Faidherbe defined as juridical and political rule by Islam, was employed only by those without the imagination to seek a better form of governance. Frencheducated blacks offered him a way out of this conundrum as they worked closely with the French colonial administration. Islam, then, was not inherently wicked; indeed, Faidherbe saw much social and political value in adherents of Islam who were open to negotiation with other groups. He employed native informants, including military veterans, to gather information on West African history and society. Faidherbe gave a larger-than-average mention to one of these veterans, who he saw as a “very educated Muslim” because he had resisted the urge to join the West African jihadist cause in the 1850s and because he provided outstanding oral accounts of the histories he read and overheard.73 Natives were capable of both understanding and relating complex histories; they could be counted on, assuming a basic level of education, to act as intelligent interpreters of social reality. Thus, they could eventually be expected to control their own political destinies. Islam, despite the presence of reactionary jihadist states, served as both a stabilizing force and a source of political and social information,\n\n22\n\nAnthropology, Colonial Policy and the Decline of French Empire in Africa\n\nparticularly in understanding the history of West Africa and its relationship with the Arabs and Berbers of North Africa. In a Saint Louis speech given on Bastille Day in 1860, Faidherbe acknowledged the differences between African groups, but did not favor one over the other. Instead, he recommended to his native audience that they model their views on those of the colonial subjects in the Congo, who had gone from “savage” to “administrator or magistrate” in twenty years of colonial rule. They should look not to the “Moors of the desert, an intelligent and energetic race” completely dissimilar to “us, who like peace and order, who are sedentary, productive, commercial traders liking prosperity, pleasure, and luxury, like you.” Any failure to “listen to this counsel” would lead to “conditions of humiliating inferiority vis-à-vis the other black nations” that rejected the Arab-led resistance in Algeria.74 Faidherbe believed that only a close association with French ways of life and governance would bring peace and prosperity to Senegalese political groups. He did not reject Islam as a force for civilization, but rather its extremist proponents. In taking this position, Faidherbe placed himself as contrary to the more explicitly racialized concepts, cloaked as physical anthropology, advocated by scholars such as Paul Topinard, who believed that French problems in North Africa stemmed from a fundamental mistake. He felt the French needed to “appropriate the indigenous race of Algeria, the Berbers.” In doing so, they had to remember to avoid “treating them like the Arab race.”75 This basic bifurcation, an effort to divide and conquer, treated the colonies as a Manichean space with “good” Berbers and “bad” Arabs. Berbers could assimilate quite easily to French political, legal, and social forms due to their perceived proximity to the extant French model. Arabs, on the other hand, had little to offer and a long way to go, perhaps inherently incapable of equality with the French. Battling this simplistic view, Faidherbe made use of the significant Algerian journals and scientific societies resident in Algiers or other Algerian cities such as Constantine; prominent metropolitan historical publications offered little outlet for African information beyond brief exchanges in the minutes of meetings of anthropological societies. In the process, Faidherbe made use of the small but flourishing intra-African intellectual network, one that he would take great pains to expand. Following his final departure from Senegal in 1865, he spent much of his time on scholarly ethnology, ruminating on civilizational migrations, movements, and mixing.\n\nPolitical association as springboard to metropolitan science Even as he conducted ethnological investigations in Algeria and Senegal, Faidherbe remained a military officer. He took advantage, as did some of his military peers, of the fluidity of academic groups in Paris to gain entry despite his limited academic qualifications. After all, he had only an undergraduate engineering degree to his credit. Most importantly, he parlayed his field experience and significant history of publication to gain entrance to the most prestigious anthropological group in the world at the time, the Société d’anthropologie de Paris, founded by the prominent biologist, physician, and physical anthropologist Paul Broca in 1859. The organization and its founder\n\nLouis Faidherbe and Intellectual Networks\n\n23\n\nwere part of a larger European-wide effort to employ physical distinction as racial markers. According to this school of thought, scientists could classify the potential and capabilities of populations according to their perceived locations not only along a linear evolutionary system but also on a hierarchy of races.76 Broca specifically sought to distinguish the newly developed “anthropology” from its older predecessor, “ethnology.” Broca pointed to the “primacy of the study of the physical characteristics of man” as vital to understanding “the human races.” Ethnology, in his eyes, lacked “cohesion,” as it was not “built on the solid base of anatomy, the most positive fundamental of natural history.” Ethnology, while rigorous in its study of societal custom, remained subject to analysis “outside the scientific method, opening itself to the most venturesome speculation unless grounded in reality by the guiding hand of observation.” Physical anthropologists rejected just the sort of examination advocated by Faidherbe as lacking in science. In Broca’s discipline, only scientific measurements, such as cranial capacity or the length of the brow, could differentiate races.77 In joining this particular group, Faidherbe gained professional connections, credibility, and a larger publishing opportunity. The group had long-standing ties to the French overseas academic community, corresponding regularly with societies in Algeria by the 1860s.78 Although his views on the importance of ethnography and sociocultural distinction did not jibe with the biological bases of the society’s founders, Faidherbe saw the group could provide him with the academic legitimacy necessary for him to influence both intellectual and policy-making circles in the metropole and in the colonies. He adapted well enough to the society’s message that within seven years of membership, Faidherbe had gained the society’s presidency.79 By this time, now-General Faidherbe’s network of contacts extended far outside Africa to the highest reaches of the French academic community. Indeed, Faidherbe’s relationship with Broca and another of the founding members of the society, Armand de Quatrefages, ran sufficiently deep that they joined him in sponsoring a new candidate for society membership during Faidherbe’s presidency.80 He could count prominent scientists of the day as his close collaborators, delivering to him greater access to the most advanced anthropological theories of the day while also providing an outlet for him to spread his basic ideas on civilizational development. The anthropological society had ties not only to the academic community but also to colonial political support and funding tied to the French state’s 1864 recognition of the group as an “establishment of public utility.”81 This web of contacts, interestingly, remained steadfastly focused on France and its colonies with only limited interaction with British, German, or American colleagues. Much of Faidherbe’s success stemmed from his association with Algeria, viewed generally by this time (as Faidherbe had seen it since the 1840s) as the central French colonial site for understanding the human condition. Many French Algerian scholars gained honorary inductions into other societies.82 Faidherbe parlayed these associations, particularly his long-standing correspondence with the Paris geographical society, into publication opportunities. His study of the neolithic carvings in the Canary Islands stemmed from an initial report to the geographical society, gaining him the notoriety necessary to gain a place as correspondent of the prestigious académie des inscriptions\n\n24\n\nAnthropology, Colonial Policy and the Decline of French Empire in Africa\n\net belles-lettres (part of the Institut de France, also home to the académie française) and the résumé to publish in the exclusive Revue d’anthropologie.83 Faidherbe made great use of the professional connections he cultivated in Paris. He gained entrance to new avenues of publication while also locating more extensive sources of financial support for his research that did not rely on his position as a military officer. Enhanced funding enabled the now senior officer and scholar to develop new ethnological sources both within French academia and in native societies encountered while on more extensive and focused research trips. He could then expose that history to a greater audience, thereby revealing the past achievements of North African groups while displaying the possibility for future advancement. Faidherbe’s most prominent contribution to French anthropology was, with Paul Topinard, the Instructions sur l’anthropologie de l’Algérie, first published in 1874.84 This document presented an interesting combination of the two modes of inquiry that Broca had previously characterized as oppositional. Faidherbe presented the ethnological or ethnographic view, while Topinard wrote as a physical anthropologist in search of more materials to measure. Continuing earlier conclusions, Faidherbe remarked in these instructions: “the Berber and the Arab are both white at birth.”85 The Arabs “will not rally” to the French “mode of civilization.” The Berbers, on the other hand, displayed great similarity to the French, including “perhaps a community of origin.”86 Faidherbe argued that the Berbers originated in the tribes of Northern Europe, as witnessed by “the continuous line of stone markers that one finds from the shore of the Baltic all the way to Tunisia.”87 Faidherbe’s model placed a past version of these native blondhaired and blue-eyed Algerians on par with the Franks, who shared these physical traits. Despite his efforts to establish some ethnographic distance, Faidherbe could not escape the Eurocentric and racist views so prevalent at the time. Arabs and Berbers were distinct groups for him; the violence of Arab resistance to the French colonial presence had convinced him that the nomadic Arabs were not ready for full political association without first mixing with the blacks or at least the Berbers. Faidherbe’s research agenda thus existed on the line between the relativist views that would emerge from French African ethnology in the twentieth century and the biological determinist views of many prominent physical anthropologists. He pressed for dialogue among French scholars-administrators, natives, and African oral and written sources to determine the historical origins of civilizational groups. His scholarship thus aimed to reform the system from the top-down and inside-out by offering a better-informed and consequently more effective form of rule. To gather this data, he turned to the ethnological networks he knew in North and West Africa. For instance, he employed “4 Moroccan informants” to describe the writing on the stone monuments of Demnat and Makech. Bowing to his desire for unadulterated truth and to a bit of ethnocentrism, he hedged his bets and “recognized the necessity to temper them with information gathered by a European.” Thus, he also consulted reports provided by the French minister to Morocco, “who does research in geography and archaeology.”88 These records, once deciphered, offered a glimpse into little-known North African groups. African residents and researchers remained important to Faidherbe’s research long after his permanent return to France in the 1870s, providing the empirical basis for\n\nLouis Faidherbe and Intellectual Networks\n\n25\n\nhis social understanding. In his work retracing the writings of Herodotus in Libya, he consulted the definitive grammatical studies of Kabyle and Arab dialects in the area, produced by a soldier-scholar like himself, along with reports from explorers.89 He did not settle for the explanations of those who had never been there. The ethnographic present, simultaneously primitive and reflective of the powerful influence of the past, revealed the potential for social and political linkage to the French colonial state. Such original work won Faidherbe some measure of academic acceptance in France perhaps in spite of his use of nonmetropolitan sources. Few other “amateur” scholars of the period held such a position.90 He had risen to great heights in both colonial governance and metropolitan academia, thereby connecting the worlds even as he remained outside of them. A full resident of neither Parisian academic circles nor colonial policy making, Faidherbe could investigate and influence both from the margins, from their points of overlap.\n\nContinuing connections and a forgotten legacy Great success in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 gave Faidherbe additional space in which to work, earning him heroic acclaim, political office, and ultimately the prominent position of Grand Chancellor of the French Legion of Honor.91 Although Faidherbe’s health failed him, as he could no longer walk by 1876, he continued to study Africa vicariously through his connections. His position in the Legion of Honor permitted him to direct young colonial officers to visit him in his offices or at his home.92 Through one of these visits in 1886, Faidherbe met young Henri Monteil, recently returned from Senegal. Faidherbe, in the imperious style of a man used to power and fully cognizant of the approach of death, told the officer that his recent journey up the Senegal River was the culmination of the general’s work. Flush with the excitement of the “Scramble for Africa” among the great European powers of the late nineteenth century, Monteil enjoyed his time with Faidherbe and returned periodically to check in with the patriarch of French ethnology. The system of connections established by Faidherbe had already paid great dividends for the young explorer, who had worked with two native chiefs under the guidance of Joseph Gallieni, one a graduate of the école des otages and the other a former guide and translator for Faidherbe, while on expedition.93 Monteil did not stand alone in accepting the wisdom of the now-frail Faidherbe. Administrators and governors visited him on several occasions and made specific reference to his example in developing policies. Faidherbe’s legacy of close collaboration with native intellectual and political elites set the standard for the French colonial service, both military and civilian, with an increasing willingness for open intellectual discourse among Europeans with their heads down and focused in the colonies. This was a rare achievement in the dark years surrounding the Dreyfus Affair. Gallieni, in fact, based much of his West African ethnological understanding on the work of Faidherbe, particularly the “origin and history of the population.”94 He first interacted with Faidherbe while still a lieutenant, working to develop the West African railroad Faidherbe had long labored to bring to fruition, a project Gallieni would advance\n\n26\n\nAnthropology, Colonial Policy and the Decline of French Empire in Africa\n\nthrough the use of a corvée system of forced labor.95 Ultimately, Gallieni saw Faidherbe’s efforts, both intellectual and military, as foundational. Gallieni felt that without Faidherbe’s example, the French could not have expanded their rule over West Africa.96 Faidherbe and his ideas linked North and West Africa and formed a bridge to Gallieni, Lyautey, and the leaders and theorists to follow. Parisian ethnology courses attended by Maurice Delafosse in the 1890s, for instance, relied heavily on Faidherbe’s writing regarding civilizational groups in West Africa. Early-twentieth-century colonial Arabic scholar Ismael Hamet cited Faidherbe’s 1859 work on Senegal for unearthing the “secrets of Central Africa” by initiating the acquisition of important documentary and oral evidence of group origins.97 Hubert Lyautey, a direct disciple of Gallieni in Tonkin and Madagascar, applied the principles of local understanding to his time in Africa, from Algeria to Morocco.98 Natives also connected French intellectuals and colonial functionaries in a common conversation and realm of experience. Descendants of Faidherbe’s chief translators worked with French ethnologists and soldiers in Mauritania and along the Sahel, studying Sufi brotherhoods under funding from the Algerian and West African colonial governments.99 Faidherbe stood alone in his time as a man thinking about informational networks in the colonial sphere. He placed himself in many camps, from native to metropolitan academic in an effort to influence the flow of information in, to, and from the colonies. In so doing, he founded a network of transfer reliant on men, and some women, with significant impact on the direction of France in the colonies and, in some cases, in the metropole. His recognition of the importance of Algeria established a center for these networks, the point from which his successors would emerge. While the bureaux arabes disappeared from Algeria, their essence remained in the successive Muslim policy organizations in West Africa manned by Joseph Gallieni, Maurice Delafosse, and Paul Marty, among others. Faidherbe’s death on September 29, 1889, did not destroy the network he helped to create. Instead, the reach of ethnological knowledge grew only larger, flourishing among the subterranean connections encouraged by Faidherbe and now including native intellectuals as well as French scholars. Ethnological knowledge, informed by a hearty dose of racial paternalism, nevertheless grew increasingly from contact and dialogue with native idioms of race and distinction as French colonial domination continued in Africa. This growth was far from singular; instead, it was made up of individual entities connected by their personal research and networks. Social and political knowledge became a primary concern of these chaotic systems, ordered only by the possession, retention, and dissemination of information deemed local and often considered apart from the metropole.\n\n2\n\nLyautey, Gallieni, and Early Efforts at Political Association Informed by Ethnology\n\nDuring an 1881 assignment to Algeria, French captain Hubert Lyautey tried to learn more about daily Algerian life from conversation with locals while traveling into the interior. After returning from his detested job as an aide in the office of the commanding general of French forces in Algiers, he spent two hours each day at the café of a local notable. While there, young Lyautey learned the language and discussed Arabic scholarship, including the work of fourteenth-century philosopher Ibn Khaldun, with religious and political luminaries of Algiers.1 His mind spinning from these interactions, he returned to his Algiers apartment and dressed “in the Arab manner, which is to say in shirt and burnous,” spending the rest of the night “surrounded by my beloved books, my pencils, [and] my Arabic notebook,” the primary tool for his regular language studies with the secretary of the local bureau arabe.2 Desperate for field experience to combat the daily drudgery in Algiers, the young officer took part in desert expeditions and conducted anthropological and archaeological expeditions with local French academics.3 In the evening of one such trip, Lyautey heard the strains of music in the distance. Straying from his campsite, he found a wedding that he described as “rather poor and primitive, but what color!” Continuing his nighttime walk, he soon found himself in a village of non-Arab blacks, where he gained the assistance of a former tirailleur as his translator. His lack of scientific training did not stop him from offering his own take on social roles among the native population: “We never see anything like it among the Arabs, but among the g"
