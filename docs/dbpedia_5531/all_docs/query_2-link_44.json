        "text": "By Miyase Koyuncu Kaya\n\nBalıkesir Üniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi, Vol.12 N0.22 (2009)\n\nBases of Research: Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie’s historical studies that the author has written in different periods in a different manner.\n\nPurpose of Research: The purpose of our study is to understand historical approach of Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie and to investigate different approaches to history by using different sources as in the example of Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie’s Works- Peasants of Languedoc and Montaillou.\n\nResources of Data: Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie’s Works- Peasants of Languedoc and Montaillou.\n\nMain Discussion: How do an historian’s sources affect his history writing?\n\nConclusions: As in the examples of Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie’s Works- Peasants of Languedoc an Montaillou, an historian’s sources affect and shape his history writing. Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie used quantitative sources-statistics to write peasants history of Languedoc but later in his life he indicated how court records can be used as a source to make history of men as he did in Montoillou.\n\nIntroduction: In this work, with brief life story of Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, his two famous and important studies “The Peasants of Languedoc” (1966) and Montaillou: Cathars and Catholics in a French village 1294-1324 are taken into consideration in the historical context of “Annales” third generation. With “The Peasants of Languedoc”, the concepts of quantitative history, of longue dureé, of total history in the context of local history, and importance of demography will be analyzed. The essays in “Territory of The Historian”— range from a study of military recruits in the 19th century, to the history of rain and tine weather, and to a discussion of attitudes toward death became the main source for the explanations of these terms. Some references and explanations will be made on chronological form of organization and “Neo- Malthusian” model. In the example of “Times of Feast and Times of Famines”, the question of what is the history of climate will be answered under the light of the author’s explanations. Around “Montaillou: Cathars and Catholics in a French village 1294-1324”, ethnographic style, microhistory, novelistic realism in a historical study with the contribution of anthropology to history are to be considered. Along with the historiographical schemes of these studies, the contents also became part of this work for the closer understanding of the historical methods used by Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie."
