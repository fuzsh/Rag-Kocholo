        "text": "As in the rest of France, schools are largely in the hands of the state and are of three main kinds: primary, junior secondary (collèges), and senior secondary (lycées). A significant minority of all pupils are in private, nonstate schools, most of them run by the Roman Catholic Church. Some of the best-known lycées in central Paris are the Lycée Henri-IV, the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, and the Lycée Janson de Sailly; such schools traditionally have educated a large number of the nation’s intelligentsia.\n\nParis has long been an important world centre of higher education. The building known as the Sorbonne housed the arts and science faculties of the University of Paris, one of Europe’s oldest universities, until it was split into 13 autonomous universities following mass student protests in 1968. A number of much smaller bodies of higher education—more specialized and more elitist than the Universities of Paris—include the engineering, technical, and business colleges known as the grand schools (grandes écoles). The two best known in the Paris region are the School of Higher Business Studies (École des Hautes Études Commerciales; HEC) and the Polytechnical School (École Polytechnique). The Normal Superior School (École Normale Supérieure) serves mainly to prepare future university and lycée teachers. The Institute of Political Sciences (Institut des Sciences Politiques; “Sciences Po”) nurtures many of those who go on to the influential postgraduate National School for Administration (École Nationale d’Administration; ENA) to train as senior civil servants. This selective structure has served France well in many ways but also has come under heavy criticism and undergone sporadic reform.\n\nFoundation and early growth (c. 7600 bce to 12th century ce)\n\nThe earliest evidence for human habitation in what is now the city of Paris dates from about 7600 bce. By the end of the 3rd century bce, a settlement had been built on the Île de la Cité; it was inhabited by a Gallic tribe known as the Parisii. The first recorded name for the settlement was Lutetia (Latin: “Midwater-Dwelling”). When the Romans arrived, the Parisii were sufficiently organized and wealthy to have their own gold coinage. Julius Caesar wrote in his Commentaries (52 bce) that the inhabitants burned their town rather than surrender it to the Romans. In the 1st century ce Lutetia grew as a Roman town and spread to the left bank of the Seine. The straight streets and the public buildings in this locale were characteristically Roman, including a forum, several baths, and an amphitheatre.\n\nA series of barbarian invasions began in the late 2nd century. The town on the left bank was destroyed by the mid-3rd century, and the inhabitants took refuge on the island, around which they built a thick stone wall. From the early 4th century the place became known as Paris.\n\nBy this time, Christianity seems to have spread to Paris. A 10th-century sacramentary cites St. Denis (Latin Dionysius) as having been the first bishop of Paris, about 250 ce. A graveyard excavated near the Carrefour des Gobelins shows that there was a Christian community in very early times on the banks of the Bièvre (a left-bank tributary of the Seine); but it was probably under St. Marcel, the ninth bishop (c. 360–436), that the first Christian church, a wooden structure, was built on the island.\n\nBy the end of the 5th century, the Salian Franks, under Clovis, had captured Paris from the Gauls, making it their own capital. It remained the capital until the end of Chilperic’s reign in 584, but succeeding Merovingians carried the crown elsewhere. Charlemagne’s dynasty, the Carolingians, tended to leave the city in the charge of the counts of Paris, who in many cases had less control over administration than did the bishops. After the election of Hugh Capet, a count of Paris, to the throne in 987, Paris, as a Capetian capital, became more important.\n\nThe population and commerce of Paris increased with the gradual return of political stability and public order under the Capetian kings. The maintenance of order was entrusted to a representative of the king, the provost of Paris (prévôt de Paris), first mentioned in 1050. In the 11th century the first guilds were formed, among them the butchers’ guild and the river-merchants’ guild, or marchandise de l’eau. In 1141 the crown sold the principal port (near the Hôtel de Ville) to the marchandise, whose ship-blazoned arms eventually were adopted as those of Paris. In 1171 Louis VII gave the marchandise a charter confirming its “ancient right” to a monopoly of river trade."
