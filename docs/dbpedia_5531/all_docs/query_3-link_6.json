        "text": "At the time of writing, the average cost of private schools in France is between US$550 and US$1,660 annually. However, there are some notable outliers: the Ermitage International School of France is the most expensive school in the country, with an annual tuition fee of US$39,388.\n\nStudents as young as two attend, all the way up to age 19. They are exposed to a variety of activities, including rowing, horseback riding, fencing and tennis. Boarders live in quaint historic homes, surrounded by forests and gardens, and its relative proximity to Paris (19km, or 12 miles, away) means that there are multiple opportunities for shopping and sightseeing trips. On average, there are only 13 students per class, and these classes are conducted in both English and French, producing bilingual students. Once they have mastered both languages, they have the option of studying a third, such as Mandarin or German.\n\nThe British School of Paris, which accepts students as young as age three, boasts a 90 per cent rate of pupils going on to attend top-ranked universities. It costs between US$24,000 and US$31,135 annually, and lies in the suburbs of Paris. The campus includes a 19th-century manor house and multiple scientific laboratories; its curriculum is based on the British system.\n\nThe Notre-Dame International High School costs US$27,686 per year, and only accepts students between the ages of 14 and 18. Its students come from all over the world, and its vast facilities include two outdoor soccer fields and two gymnasiums.\n\nMany of the French state schools have a long history. Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris was founded in 1563, and some of its most notable students include the French president Jacques Chirac, along with Charles Baudelaire, Victor Hugo and the French revolutionaries Maximilien Robespierre and Camille Desmoulins.\n\nIts 1,818 students must weather rigorous academic demands and fast-paced lectures, where a pause in note-taking means you will soon fall several pages behind. Its rival school is Lycée Henri-IV, also in Paris, whose graduates include the philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and René Descartes. Lycée Henry-IV is also known for churning out a large number of French politicians.\n\nBoth Lycée Louis-le-Grand and Lycée Henri-IV have a 100 per cent success rate when it comes to their students passing the baccalauréat, the academic qualification test that French students need to pursue a university education. And while both schools are free, they are extremely selective – and difficult. At Lycée Louis-le-Grand, the first day of classes might include six hours of maths in a row, and some of the teachers are known for handing tests back in order of how badly one did. Clearly, there is no room for mediocrity in these institutions."
