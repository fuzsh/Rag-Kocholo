We were in the semi-final in 2022 and 2023.\n\nEvery year, some happy few members of our debating club can also attend the prestigious grand « final » of the debating tournament between Grandes Ecoles at the Hotel de Lassay (Assemblée Nationale).\n\nWorkshops and friendly debates take place every Friday room F003 from 12:30 to 13:30\n\nFrom classe de seconde to CPGE 2e année, if you wish to practice your English in a fun way, come and join us !\n\nFor further information, contact Laure Nafissi-Geschwind via the ENT."
