        "text": "When Netflix gets a hit, it's what everyone can't stop talking about. Earlier this month, it was May December, a drama starring Julianne Moore, Natalie Portman, and Charles Melton, following an actress who decides to shadow the subject she intends to play: a former teacher who ended up seducing and marrying one of her students.\n\nNow, the film everyone can't stop talking about is Leave the World Behind. It's similarly well-cast, with Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, Julia Roberts, Myha'la, and Kevin Bacon. Based on a 2020 novel by Rumaan Alam, the film follows a couple who decide to stay in an AirBnb, but their vacation is interrupted when the family that owns AirBnb returns, claiming a blackout in the city forced them to return. As the four are forced to stay together, they try to make sense of the strange blackout. Sam Esmail of Mr. Robot fame directs the film, and notably, former President Barack Obama's production company is one of the groups involved.\n\nLeave the World Behind slowly escalates as the film progresses, emphasizing the characters' reliance on technology and their growing confusion due to the lack of communication with the outside world. It's a film that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nSo after a shocking ending, viewers are of course wondering if there's more story in the Leave the World Behind universe to tell. Here's what we know about any sequel potential for Leave the World Behind.\n\nNetflix has no plans yet to do a sequel to Leave the World Behind.\n\nWhile the film has likely clocked hours and hours of viewership, Netflix has yet to say anything about the success of the film. As far as we know, it hasn't broken any streaming records.\n\nIn addition, the film is based on a 2020 novel of the same name. While that may not deter Netflix, the book may have been intended to be standalone, which doesn't bode well for anyone hoping there's more of a story to tell.\n\nWhen the film ends, the fate of the families is left ambiguous. We're not sure if they survive the impending event that's headed their way, or if Amanda and Clay's daughter, Rose, is the only one of the group that makes it out. But that's how the story is intended to end."
