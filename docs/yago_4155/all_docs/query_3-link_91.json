        "text": "Season 4 of ‘Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba’ has come to an end with an extended episode and with it the fate of the series. The anime is about to reach the final stretch of the story, where we have the last arcs. However, and as it was leaked a few weeks ago, the end of the series will not come with more episodes of the anime, but in a series of movies. Here we share with you the details of what will be ‘Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba’ and the Infinity Castle arc.\n\n‘Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba’: Infinity Castle arc to be a trilogy\n\n‘Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba’ Season 5 will be a trilogy of movies distributed by Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures Entertainment, bringing this anime back to the big screen. Along with a brief glimpse of what will be the Infinity Castle arc, the first poster was also released with the caption “The All-Out War Begins.”\n\n“Crunchyroll is thrilled to be able to bring this trilogy of films to fans, on the big screen, and it promises to be one of the truly epic and consequential pop-cultural events of our time when it hits theaters,” said Rahul Purini, President of Crunchyroll via a press release.\n\nWhen will ‘Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba’: Infinity Castle Arc be released?\n\nFor now, there are no details on when this trilogy will be released, although it is expected to be released with some time between the movies. It is worth remembering that this is not the first time the anime has been released in theaters, as there have been specials before some arcs, both the Mugen Train Arc and the recent To the Hashira Training Arc."
