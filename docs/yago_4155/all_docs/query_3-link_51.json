        "text": "2024 may be halfway over already, but we still have plenty of upcoming movies to look forward to. Be it action, thrillers or remakes, there’s something for every film fan when you scan all the exciting movie release dates racing towards the big screen.\n\nSo far, there's been no shortage of amazing new movies hitting the multiplex. In fact, over the past month alone, we’ve published an Alien: Romulus review, a Deadpool & Wolverine review, a Trap review and so much more. However, the future looks equally bright for our upcoming cinema trips, with tons of highly anticipated sequels heading our way, like Beetlejuice 2, Joker: Folie à Deux, and Paddington 3. We even have Francis Ford Coppola's long-awaited Megalopolis and the long-delayed Kraven the Hunter, starring Aaron Taylor Johnson, to watch out for.\n\nThat may sound like a lot of titles to keep track of, but luckily, you found our page. Here's our guide to the most exciting upcoming movies in 2024. And, if that's not enough, we've also got a guide to all the most exciting new TV shows to add to your streaming queue too! But for now, grab your bucket of popcorn and check out the newest movies heading to your local Cineplex down below.\n\nThe Crow\n\nRelease date: August 23\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 star Bill Skarsgård plays the titular character Eric Draven in The Crow, a modern reimagining of James Barr's graphic novel.\n\nMuch like the source material and its subsequent film adaptation, which stars the late Brandon Lee, who tragically died while making the 1994 movie, this remake is expected to center on the resurrected musician who embarks on a quest to avenge the deaths of himself and his partner (FKA Twigs). This remake comes during the same year as The Crow's 30th anniversary, so it has a lot to live up to in our books!\n\nBeetlejuice 2\n\nRelease date: September 6\n\nEveryone's favorite (?) bio-exorcist is set to return from the grave in Beetlejuice 2, a sequel that's been 35 years in the making. Despite the plot of the upcoming movie remaining under wraps, we do know that Wednesday star Jenna Ortega is playing the daughter of Winona Ryder's character from the original, Lydia Deetz, and that Monica Bellucci is set to bring Betelgeuse's wife to life.\n\nOther details that have been confirmed are the return of Michael Keaton as the titular ghoulie and Catherine O'Hara as Lydia's mother Delia. Tim Burton is also back in the director's chair, and Willem Dafoe and Justin Theroux's casting has been confirmed. If you loved the original Beetlejuice, check out our list of the best horror movies of all time while we wait for the specter's return.\n\nMegalopolis\n\nRelease date: September 27\n\nSci-fi epic Megalopolis centers on a young woman torn between her father, an old-fashioned mayor, and her forward-thinking architect lover, as they clash on how best to rebuild New York after a devastating disaster. Giancarlo Esposito, Laurence Fishburne, Aubrey Plaza, Dustin Hoffman, Nathalie Emmanuel, and Adam Driver star.\n\nBooed at Cannes Film Festival 2024, it reportedly cost around $120 million to make, was largely bankrolled by writer-director Francis Ford Coppola himself.\n\nJoker: Folie à Deux\n\nRelease date: October 4\n\nJoaquin Phoenix returns as Arthur Fleck in Joker 2, officially titled Joker: Folie à Deux. This is a French term that translates to \"shared madness\" and is also used to refer to shared delusional disorder, a psychiatric syndrome in which symptoms of a delusional belief, and sometimes hallucinations, are transferred from one person to another.\n\nThe title makes more sense when you factor in the addition of Harley Quinn, played by Lady Gaga. Zazie Beetz will reprise her role from the first movie, while Brendan Gleeson and Catherine Keener have joined the cast of the upcoming DC movie in undisclosed roles. A trailer for the film has been released, which shows a glimpse at Joker and Harley's crime spree.\n\nVenom: The Last Dance\n\nRelease date: October 25\n\nTom Hardy's Eddie Brock and his symbiote bestie seem to be working like a well-oiled machine to defeat baddies. Well, almost...\n\nWhen it comes to their unlikely double act, problems arise in Venom 3 when it turns out there's a major threat incoming from outer space. It looks like the biggest danger Eddie and the symbiote have ever had to face, and, by the looks of things, they might not make it out alive. That might be why it's called The Last Dance. The good news is that fans can have a sneak peek at the upcoming film thanks to the Venom 3 trailer that released in early June!\n\nPaddington in Peru\n\nRelease date: November 8 in the UK, January 17 in the US\n\nPaddington in Peru (commonly known as Paddington 3) will see the marmalade-loving bear and Brown family pack up and head to his home country to pay a visit to Aunt Lucy at the Home for Retired Bears. There's a problem, though...\n\nLucy, according to a nun played by Olivia Colman, went on an expedition in the Amazon a while back and never returned. So now it's up to Paddington and Co to venture deep into the jungle, find her, and bring her back safely. Ben Whishaw is back to lend his voice to Paddington, while Hugh Bonneville, Julie Walters, and Antonio Banderas also star. Emily Mortimer is on board, too, replacing Sally Hawkins as Mrs. Brown.\n\nGladiator 2\n\nRelease date: November 15 in the UK, November 22 in the US\n\nGladiator 2 is the unexpected follow-up to Ridley Scott's epic Gladiator and is set to pick up 20 years after the original. The first trailer for the film, screened behind closed doors at Cinema Con, sees Paul Mescal's former nobleman, Lucius Versus, forced to become a gladiator. It also showcases Mescal fighting a rhino, man-eating baboons, and Pedro Pascal.\n\nMescal's Lucius is the son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and nephew of Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, who will not be in the sequel). Joseph Quinn, May Calamawy, Derek Jacobi, and Denzel Washington also feature.\n\nKraven the Hunter\n\nRelease date: December 13\n\nWe were originally supposed to meet Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Sergei Kravinoff in October 2023, but the new Marvel movie is one of several delayed releases. The film follows the anti-hero as he sets out to prove he's the greatest hunter in the world. From what we've seen in the trailer, we're expecting one of the most violent takes in the Sony Marvel universe so far.\n\nThe film has been delayed until December. \"Kraven moved to Christmas because we're excited about it, and Christmas is the best release period there is - when you get people with time to go back to the movies over and over again,\" producer Matt Tolmach explained.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3\n\nRelease date: December 20\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 is introducing Keanu Reeves as Shadow, with Colleen O'Shaughnessey back as Tails and Idris Elba back as Knuckles. Of course, Ben Schwartz is returning as Sonic and James Marsden is back as his human bestie.\n\n\"It's going to be this giant, fun, incredible movie that obviously takes a lot from Sonic Adventure 2 and some of the games that I know the core Sonic Team grew up loving,\" producer Toby Ascher previously told GamesRadar+.\n\nMufasa: The Lion King\n\nRelease date: December 20\n\nWhen it comes to new Disney movies, love them or hate them, live-actions are in the conversation. Mufasa: The Lion King is a prequel to the 2019 live-action Disney movie. In it, we'll see the rise of Simba's father, Mufasa, from orphan cub to Pride Rock ruler.\n\nBilly Eichner and Seth Rogen will reprise their roles as Timon and Pumbaa, respectively, which is fun. But what's funnier is that the movie has already drawn comparisons to The Godfather Part II. We'll also see (or more accurately, hear) Aaron Pierre, who worked on the Emmy-nominated series The Underground Railroad, and Kelvin Harrison Jr. voice Mufasa and Scar, respectively.\n\nThe first trailer for the film is already out if you want to see a first look at the flick for yourself.\n\nNosferatu\n\nRelease date: December 25\n\nWritten and directed by Robert Eggers, the filmmaker behind The Witch, The Lighthouse, and The Northman, Nosferatu is set to offer a brand new take on the 1922 silent film of the same name.\n\nStarring Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult, Ralph Ineson, Willem Dafoe, and Bill Skarsgård as the eponymous bloodsucker, the upcoming movie is set to explore the complicated obsession between a troubled young woman and the terrifying vampire infatuated with her. With high hopes for this one, in fact, it's one of our most anticipated upcoming horror movies of 2024!"
