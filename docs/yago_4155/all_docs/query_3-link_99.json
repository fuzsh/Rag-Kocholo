        "text": "media release\n\nAugust 6, 2024\n\nTIFF announces its 2024 Centrepiece programme with titles from over 40 countries\n\nFeaturing works by acclaimed filmmakers Merzak Allouache, Andrés Baiz, Sofia Bohdanowicz, Huo Xin, Damian Kocur, and Ali Samadi Ahadi\n\nToronto —TIFF is proud to unveil its 2024 Centrepiece programme lineup presented by Marriott Bonvoy®, featuring 43 titles from filmmakers representing 41 countries. The selection includes 18 World Premiere titles from Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Nigeria, Panama, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and USA. Centrepiece honours and celebrates global cinematic achievements, inviting audiences to immerse themselves in a dynamic array of contemporary films. The programme is a reflection of TIFF’s commitment to providing an elevated platform for international cinema, acclaimed titles from festivals around the globe, highly anticipated premieres from Canadian and international talents, and the latest work of influential filmmaking luminaries. The 49th edition of the Toronto International Film Festival, presented by Rogers, will take place September 5-15, 2024.\n\nThe 2024 Centrepiece selection has been programmed by Jason Anderson, Kelly Boutsalis, Diana Cadavid, Robyn Citizen, Giovanna Fulvi, Nataleah Hunter-Young, June Kim, Dorota Lech, Jason Ryle, and Norm Wilner. Discover more about the films from the programmers themselves here:\n\nNotable World Premieres include Front Row, from one of the filmmakers selected as a Luminary — TIFF’s spotlight on new work from the world’s most influential art-house directors — Algerian director Merzak Allouache, marking his 19th feature film, a family-friendly comedy about feuding matriarchs battling over the best beachfront spot. Seven Days, the latest from Iranian filmmaker Ali Samadi Ahadi and writer Mohammad Rasoulof (also in the Centrepiece programme with his film The Seed of the Sacred Fig), centres on an Iranian human rights activist named Maryam who has spent the last six years in prison and has been granted a rare seven-day medical leave. Pimpinero: Blood and Oil, a gripping thriller set in the early 2010s from acclaimed Colombian filmmaker Andrés Baiz (Griselda, Narcos), starring Colombian music icon Juanes, Alberto Guerra, Alejandro Speitzer, and Laura Osma, takes place in the treacherous desert bordering Colombia and Venezuela, where gasoline smugglers or pimpineros risk their lives transporting illegal fuel. Under the Volcano, a tense and timely second feature from Polish filmmaker Damian Kocur following Bread and Salt, which garnered a Special Jury Prize at Venice ’22, tells the story of a Ukrainian family on vacation in the Canary Islands who become refugees overnight when Russia’s ongoing occupation of Ukraine turns into a full-scale invasion. Another timely film covering pressing social issues is Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine, from the Philippines, starring up-and-coming Maris Racal (her third collaboration with the filmmaker), who plays a young gymnast who discovers she’s pregnant on the week of the national team tryouts. The latest from Belgian director Guillaume Senez (Keeper, TIFF ’15), A Missing Part is a thoughtful and moving drama about a father’s search for his daughter, with an exceptional lead performance by Romain Duris. From Canada, Measures for a Funeral, from acclaimed filmmaker and Short Cuts alumni Sofia Bohdanowicz and her frequent collaborator, actor Deragh Campbell, tells a singular story about a forgotten Canadian violinist. Also, Canadian pop duo Tegan and Sara are at the centre of the gripping documentary Fanatical: The Catfishing of Tegan and Sara, which charts the global rise of the trailblazing twins, their advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community, and their simultaneously liberating and fraught relationship with social media, from American documentary filmmaker and writer Erin Lee Carr (At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal, Britney vs Spears), who directed and produced the film.\n\nOther Centrepiece standout World Premieres include Jane Austen Wrecked My Life from France. In an utterly charming debut, writer-director Laura Piani draws from Austen’s works while crafting a wholly contemporary romantic comedy — featuring a Frederick Wiseman cameo — that stands on its own merits. Kiwi-Australian filmmaker Marcelle Lunam, who has directed multiple music videos and short films, as well as the feature documentary Habana Shakes, presents Addition, a warm-hearted and illuminating adaptation of the bestselling novel by Toni Jordan, starring Teresa Palmer (A Discovery of Witches), who plays a mathematician struggling to balance her compulsive counting habit (and imaginary friendship with Nikola Tesla) with a new romance. The Legend of the Vagabond Queen of Lagos, a debut from Nigeria’s Agbajowo Collective, is a thriller with flecks of magical realism, telling a story about the government’s forced evictions of informal settlements. Inspired by the directors’ lived experiences, the film stars Temi Ami-Williams (Eyimofe – This Is My Desire) and celebrity activist-actor Adebowale Adedayo (a.k.a. Mr Macaroni, also at the Festival with Discovery selection Freedom Way). From China, renowned scriptwriter Huo Xin presents Bound in Heaven, a poignant tale of love and resilience starring Ni Ni, Zhou You, and Liao Fan. This deeply touching film tackles domestic violence and terminal illness with assured direction and outstanding performances.\n\n2024 Centrepiece Programme (in alphabetical order)\n\nAddition Marcelle Lunam | Australia\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nA Missing Part Guillaume Senez | Belgium/France\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nAn Unfinished Film Lou Ye | Singapore/Germany\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nAnywhere Anytime Milad Tangshir | Italy\n\nInternational Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nApril Dea Kulumbegashvili | Italy/France/Georgia\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nBeloved Tropic Ana Endara | Panama/Colombia\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nBound in Heaven Huo Xin | China\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nBy the Stream Hong Sangsoo | South Korea\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nCloud Kiyoshi Kurosawa | Japan\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nCrocodile Tears Tumpal Tampubolon | Indonesia/France/Singapore/Germany\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nDon’t Cry, Butterfly Dương Diệu Linh | Vietnam/Singapore/Philippines/Indonesia\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nEdge of Night Türker Süer | Germany\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nFanatical: The Catfishing of Tegan and Sara Erin Lee Carr | USA\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nFlow Gints Zilbalodis | Latvia/France/Belgium\n\nCanadian Premiere\n\nFront Row Merzak Allouache | Algeria/Saudi Arabia/France\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nHappyend Neo Sora | Japan/USA\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nHappy Holidays Scandar Copti | Palestine/Germany/France/Italy/Qatar\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nJane Austen Wrecked My Life Laura Piani | France\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nJulie Keeps Quiet Leonardo van Dijl | Belgium/Sweden\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nKa Whawhai Tonu - Struggle Without End Michael Jonathan | New Zealand\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nKill the Jockey Luis Ortega | Argentina/Mexico/Spain/Denmark/USA\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nLittle Jaffna Lawrence Valin | France\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nLos Tortuga Belén Funes | Spain/Chile\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nMatt and Mara Kazik Radwanski | Canada\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nMeasures for a Funeral Sofia Bohdanowicz | Canada\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nMy Sunshine Hiroshi Okuyama | Japan/France\n\nNorth American Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nPimpinero: Blood and Oil Andrés Baiz | Colombia\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nPresence Steven Soderbergh | USA\n\nInternational Premiere\n\nSantosh Sandhya Suri | United Kingdom\n\nCanadian Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nSeven Days Ali Samadi Ahadi | Germany\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nSouleymane’s Story Boris Lojkine | France\n\nInternational Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nSunshine Antoinette Jadaone | Philippines\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nSweet Angel Baby Melanie Oates | Canada\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nSales Title\n\nThe Legend of the Vagabond Queen of Lagos Agbajowo Collective: James Tayler, Ogungbamila Temitope, Okechukwu Samuel, Mathew Cerf, Tina Edukpo, Bisola Akinmuyiwa, A.S.
