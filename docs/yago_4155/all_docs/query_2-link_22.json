        "text": "“ Take back what is ours „\n\n— Tagline\n\nJustice for the End of the World is a 2026 science fiction disaster film co-written, directed and produced by Roland Emmerich. It is the first film installment in the Justice for the World film series and a remake of the 2020 film #JusticeForLove: End of the World. The film stars Maika Monroe, Alessandra de Rossi, Patrick Wilson, Bill Pullman, Marion Cotillard, Aneurin Barnard, James D'Arcy, Barry Keoghan and Mark Rylance. In the film, after an alien invasion disguised as an asteroid impact both destroys and takes over Earth, the last remnant of humanity attempts a last ditch effort to take back Earth and destroy the aliens once and for all.\n\nDevelopment of an American remake began in late 2021 following the unprecedented success of the original film and the release of the film Don't Look Up with Paramount Pictures producing, but disagreements over the screenplay and legal disputes to the rights left Paramount abandoning their plans for the film. Legendary Pictures and TSG Entertainment, the former of whom had bought the rights from Toho, hired Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier to write a script following a similar premise to the original film with Lussier attached to direct. Lussier dropped the project on November 2023, but retained story credit in the final film. On January 2024, Roland Emmerich opted to write a revised script for the film alongside frequent collaborator Harald Kloser and Laeta Kalogridis. Principal photography began in August 2024 and wrapped in December 2024. The film was made on a production budget of $171-183 million, pushing its initial budget of $165 million.\n\nJustice for the End of the World was theatrically released on December 25, 2026 to mixed reviews, with praise toward its visual effects, cinematography and musical score and criticism toward its screenplay, runtime and characters. It was a box office success, grossing $569.5 million at the end of its theatrical run and becoming the ninth-highest grossing film of 2026. At the 99th Academy Awards, it was nominated for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. A sequel, titled Blood Moon: Justice for the World, was released on September 13, 2030.\n\nPlot[]\n\nOn April 11, 1970, Apollo 13 was launched from Kennedy Space Center, but the lunar landing was aborted two days into the mission. President Richard Nixon and the government covered up the incident by claiming that an oxygen tank in the service module failing was the source of the trouble; however, with their hidden telescopes and cameras they were able to learn that an alien ship had crashed into the craft.\n\nIn 2027 the Hubble Space Telescope was intercepted by an unknown spacecraft. When the President of the United States was informed, he dispatched the new Lockheed SR-72 Stargate to check it out. Once they did, they were attacked by dozens of other spacecraft. Patricia Peterson, the Secretary of Defense, urged him to call off the attacks before they could verify who or what they were about to see. Just then, a massive asteroid started to enter into Earth's exosphere, indicated by satellites and telescopes. Scientists inferred that the asteroid would come into impact in around 10 days before it would be pulled in by Earth's gravity and hit Earth. President Joshua Warring issued a statement to scramble as many fighter ships as possible. Just then, a batch of alien starships started raining down to intercept the U.S. Space Force's fighter ships.\n\nWarring almost gave the green light to the use of a B83 hydrogen bomb until his First Lady and wife, Rosa, told him not to do it as the fallout might risk civilian lives thousands of feet below. After checking with Peterson and the cabinet members, they said that the civilians would be safe from the fallout. So, Warring gave the word. As the fighters pulled back, the nuke blew up on the asteroid, but left no trace of damage; it actually fueled the asteroid with more energy. The asteroid accelerated its closing time from 10 days to four days. The word spread fast throughout the world as they braced for Doomsday, hiding in their bunkers and safeguards.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, leading up to the days of the impact, a mysterious man named Arthur Ledger attacked the Prime Minister, William Dawson, with Ledger's eyes super white. Ledger tells them to \"submit to the will above\" before being dragged away. Dawson, along with his wife, Mary Tate, asks Ledger regarding his message of submission to the \"ones above.\" Ledger cryptically tells them to \"love and embrace it, as justice will come from above.\" Then on that day the asteroid hit, killing billions who couldn't make it in time, including Dawson and Tate, watching the firestorm as it engulfs them in seconds. Hours after the impact, aliens start the break out to conquer Earth.\n\nThree years later Peterson, Watson-Warring, Warring, and Vice President Thomas Barrett become survivors of a new apocalyptic war, with alien starships flying around. Hiding in a bunker, they pact together with the remainder of the U.S. Armed Forces. They determine that the weak points of the aliens was the original asteroid, which controls them as a hive mind and is heavily guarded by alien starfighters. The U.S. military contacts surviving airborne squadrons around the world through Morse code to organize a united counter-offensive. Lacking pilots, Peterson, Warring and Captain Jake Travis enlist volunteers with flight experience, including an ace pilot named Edwin Anderson, from the refugee camp at the base to fly the remaining jets at Area 51.\n\nWarring leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base overseen by Travis and Peterson. With an all-out assault on the asteroid base, Warring's squadron engages the enemy fighters, with its ammunition severely damaging the asteroid, but exhaust their weapons before they can destroy it. With more casualties coming their way and the aliens eventually finding their way to the base, Anderson's last missile is unable to fire; he sacrifices himself by crashing into the asteroid and destroying it. As humanity rejoices, Warring reunites with his family as Peterson looks off into the sunset.\n\nMain credits[]\n\nStaff role on the left, staff member's name on the right.\n\nDirector - Roland Emmerich\n\nScreenwriters - Roland Emmerich and Harald Kloser and Laeta Kalogridis\n\nStorywriters - Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier\n\nProducers - Mary Parent, Roland Emmerich, Harald Kloser, Laeta Kalogridis and Larry J.

While their full names are not mentioned, they are credited as “Salvacion” and “Concepcion”, respectively, referencing their characters in the original entries.\n\nProduction[]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nMain article: Justice for Love (2023 film)\n\nFollowing the phenomenal success of the original film, Paramount Pictures became interested in doing an American remake of the film with a big budget and A-list actors. This would also be a great next step to follow up on the success of the 2021 film Don't Look Up, which Paramount originally planned to release theatrically before its rights were acquired by Netflix.\n\nHowever, Paramount would soon learn that Toho had signed a deal with Legendary Pictures and TSG Entertainment to produce their own remake of the film. Paramount proceeded to sue both Toho and Legendary for the rights to the Justice for Love duology, claiming that they had a written contract to produce their own remake; however, Toho denied ever making such a deal.\n\nEventually, a federal judge ruled that Legendary did, in fact, have the rights to produce a remake of #JusticeForLove: End of the World. This forced Paramount to finally abandon its plans for the film.\n\nPre-production and writing[]\n\nThe film's pre-production and writing underwent a difficult development period due to multiple changes with the directors attached to direct it and their own visions for it, from Amy Heckerling as a comedy/drama to Roland Emmerich as a sci-fi disaster film.\n\nAmy Heckerling and John Krasinski[]\n\nParamount initially hired Clueless director Amy Heckerling as the film's director and hired Greenland writer Chris Sparling to write the film's screenplay. Heckerling admitted her avoidance towards depressing movies and envisioned the film instead as a comedy/drama.\n\nTo maintain authenticity and continuity, they intended to closely follow the original film, albeit changing the setting to New York City, while keeping the general plot and characters of the original. It was decided from the outset that the film would feature its own characters without bringing in any from the original entries, although Clara Young was suggested for a short cameo.\n\nHeckerling never intended to include any form of disaster scenes for the film and she instructed Sparling to remove any scenes featuring city destruction, even removing the asteroid impact during the film's climax and keeping in only the New York firestorm scene in order to please the fans that wanted to see disaster scenes and as a way to visualize the Apocalypse.\n\nFor the lead role of Emily, Heckerling approached actress Alicia Silverstone, while Rachel Blanchard was also considered for the role of Emily's sister. Around the same time, a concept poster depicting a deserted Times Square was released in the United States to generate interest for the project.\n\nUnder the title Emily and the Apocalypse[note 1], Sparling submitted his first completed draft to the executives at Paramount. The studio executives were dissatisfied with the screenplay as it deviated \"too much\" from the original film and requested the screenplay to be rewritten from scratch. Heckerling could not come to an agreement with the studio executives and later left the project.\n\n“ The guys over at Paramount, they didn't like it. They thought it deviated too much from the source material, and they told me to rewrite it. „\n\n— Amy Heckerling regarding the executives' response to the submitted screenplay\n\nAfter Heckerling left the project, it was sent into development hell. In order to differentiate it from the first draft, the studio hired John Krasinski as the film's new director and Sparling began rewriting the film's screenplay, hoping to turn the project into a serious apocalyptic film as he had originally envisioned.\n\nWhile Sparling was rewriting the film's screenplay, the studio soon learned that Toho had signed a deal with Legendary Pictures instead. As a result, the second draft of the screenplay was never completed; Krasinski returned on directing the A Quiet Place film series, while the film Scream VI reused the New York City setting from the first draft.\n\nPatrick Lussier and Roland Emmerich[]\n\nAfter they bought the rights to the Justice for Love duology from Toho in 2022, shortly after GMA Pictures' three-year license to the film series expired in May 2022, Legendary Pictures and TSG Entertainment hired Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier to write a script remaking the film, with Lussier attached to direct.\n\nThe duo decided to discard the Emily screenplay written by Sparling while their initial draft was more faithful to the original film, having a romantic subplot. The film was going to be made on a $120 million budget; however, Lussier dropped the project on November 2023 after having issues with Legendary on pushing the budget to at least $150 million, but retained story credit in the final film.\n\nOn January 2024, Roland Emmerich opted to write a revised script for the film alongside frequent collaborator Harald Kloser and Laeta Kalogridis. Emmerich wanted to change the gist of the film by also discarding Heckerling's vision for the film as a comedy/drama, replacing it with the asteroid disaster as the new main plot point. He stated that fans would be disappointed with how love would be portrayed in the film when adapting it from a foreign film into a blockbuster.\n\n“ The audience would be unsatisfied with the main plot being about love and stuff. Love shouldn't be such a blunt emotion, it should be more figurative. „\n\n— Roland Emmerich talking about writing the screenplay\n\nThis brought Emmerich to write in an alien invasion plot after the asteroid impact. Emmerich explained this by stating how humanity would be realistically affected by a catastrophic event with their emotions and thinking process. Kalogridis liked the idea, but told Emmerich that \"Fans would like some love in there. I mean, it's there in the title.\" Rather than writing in an entire subplot about the romantic dynamics, Emmerich and Kalogridis wrote in beats of love in order to give the film emotional weight.\n\nOn February 2024 Emmerich was announced as director, with himself, Mary Parent, Kloser, Kalogridis and Larry J. Franco attached to produce the film. Because Emmerich was a more well-renowned director, the film's budget went up to $165 million.\n\nCasting started on the same month with Maika Monroe being cast as the lead of the film and replacing Alicia Silverstone. Alessandra de Rossi, Patrick Wilson and Bill Pullman were cast in March and the rest of the cast was announced in May. Monroe, de Rossi, Wilson and Pullman were paid $350,000 each while Marion Cotillard, Barry Keoghan and Mark Rylance were the highest paid in the cast, with each receiving $2.1 million.\n\nFilming[]\n\nPrincipal photography began in August 2024 and wrapped in December 2024, with Markus Förderer serving as the director of photography. The film was shot in IMAX 3D. Filming locations were mostly across the Western United States, mostly in California and Nevada with Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia serving as other filming locations.\n\nThree foreign locations were used: London, England for when the British government is first introduced, Frankfurt, Germany for the Squadron 32 battle against the aliens and Manila, the Philippines for when Kurdi and Abiera would make their brief cameo appearances in the film.\n\nPost-production[]\n\nThe visual effects were supervised by Volker Engel, one of Emmerich's frequent collaborators. Four visual effects companies worked on the film; Uncharted Territory, LLC, Scanline VFX, Weta FX and Framestore. However, Emmerich was unsatisfied with how the asteroid effect looked, citing it as \"way too bright and red. Its colors should be more than just that.\" and hired Industrial Light & Magic to redo the effect, pushing the budget to anywhere between $171-183 million from its initial $165 million.\n\nMusic[]\n\nThe film's music was composed by Harald Kloser and Thomas Wander. The soundtrack was released on December 17, 2026 by WaterTower Music. Much of the themes and style of Shiro Sagisu, who had worked on the score for the original film, was kept.\n\nMarketing[]\n\nMain article: Emily: A Clueless Look at the Apocalypse\n\nMain article: Asteroid Clara: The Director's Cut\n\nThe marketing costs for Justice for the End of the World were reported to be $120 million. The film was promoted in the 2026 San Diego Comic-Con by Emmerich, Kloser, Dean Devlin, who was Emmerich's friend, and the stars of the original film, Yasmien Kurdi and Isabelle Abiera. A brief 10-second teaser was showcased, narrated by Patrick Wilson's character, Joshua Warring. The full teaser trailer was released on March 5, 2026, with the full trailer releasing on June 31, 2026. Legendary Comics also released a tie-in graphic novel for the film featuring the original Emily screenplay written by Sparling while Heckerling was still the film's director at Paramount.\n\nIn anticipation for the film's theatrical release, along with issues brought up by actresses Rebecca Rittenhouse and Gabriella Wilde regarding their characters in the original film, Toho produced a revised version of the original film to be released jointly alongside the new film. It was given a limited theatrical release on November 3, 2026, earning more than $3 million during its initial theatrical run.\n\nThe film's novelization, written by Alex Irvine, who wrote the novelization for Roland Emmerich's film Independence Day: Resurgence, was published on December 24 by Titan Books one day before the film's release and the art book The Art of Justice for the End of the World was released on December 30.\n\nRelease[]\n\nTheatrical[]\n\nJustice for the End of the World premiered in New York City on the red carpet before being released worldwide on December 25, 2026. Due to the film being released only a week after Dune: Messiah, the film wasn't able to be screened in IMAX, 3D, Dolby Cinema, RealD 3D, IMAX 3D, 4DX, and ScreenX, although it was able to be screened in those formats after Dune: Messiah's two-week run in premium formats, and no other major blockbuster was released during the month of January. The film was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures except for China, Japan and the Philippines, where the film was distributed by Universal Pictures, Toho Co. Ltd. and GMA Pictures. Toho and GMA Pictures released the film with Japanese and Tagalog dubs, respectively, unlike the original film.\n\nHome video[]\n\nThe film was released on Digital HD on March 13, 2027 and released on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD on March 27, 2027. The 4K release includes HDR10, HDR10+, Dolby Vision high dynamic range, and a Dolby Atmos soundtrack. The special edition of the film included featurettes and cast interviews, including interviews from Amy Heckerling, Patrick Lussier and Alicia Silverstone regarding the film's early development at Paramount.\n\nToho and GMA Pictures released multiple editions of the film on 4K, Blu-ray, and DVD in Japan and the Philippines on August 18, 2027. Unlike the original film, which only had one language, the film was released with Japanese and Tagalog dubs, respectively. GMA Pictures also released a two-disc limited edition set with the original film while Toho released their own three-disc set with Asteroid Clara.\n\nReception[]\n\nBox office[]\n\nJustice for the End of the World grossed $178.8 million in the domestic box office and $390.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $569.5 million. It became Emmerich's third-highest grossing film. The film's opening weekend earned $221 million, which became Emmerich's highest worldwide opening, dethroning 2012's $230.5 million. Its domestic weekend earned $95.3 million, replacing The Day After Tomorrow's $85.8 million as the highest-grossing domestic weekend by Emmerich. It faced stiff competition from Dune: Messiah, particularly due to the film taking away its premium screening slots in its opening weekend and second weekend. It was bolstered and saw an increase in box office revenue after premium screenings started to go live for the film.\n\nIn China it opened with $75.2 million and grossed $215.1 million. In Japan the film opened with $16 million before grossing a total of $41 million. In the Philippines the film opened with $7 million before going on to gross $12 million in total.\n\nDeadline Hollywood reported the film made $118.4 million in net profit after factoring in all expenses and revenues.\n\nCritical reception[]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 37% based on 355 reviews, with an average rating of 5.50/10. The site's critical consensus reads \"Justice for the End of the World handles visual scale well, but is muddled down with lackluster writing, plot-induced stupidity and lack of pacing.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 40 out of 100 based on 46 critics indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale while those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 78% and a 64% \"definite recommend.\"\n\nResponse from the staff[]\n\nThe film recieved mostly mixed to negative reception from the staff that were involved with previous installments of the Justice for Love duology from Toho Co., Ltd. to Paramount Pictures.\n\nToho[]\n\nScreenwriter Ryuhei Kitamura and producer Shusuke Kaneko (both of whom previously criticized Emmerich's attempt on reimagining Godzilla in 1998) were again critical of this film as well. Kitamura stated \"this isn't Justice for Love, it's another typical Emmerich sci-fi film\" before remarking that Asteroid Clara was more faithful to their original vision for the film, despite being criticized by film critics as \"inferior\" compared to the original. Kaneko pondered on the treatment that the film was given by the studio, stating \"It is interesting that every Roland Emmerich film always ends up like Independence Day. Justice for Love is a cautionary tale about asteroids, it's not about aliens invading Earth\".\n\nDespite the film being a commercial success, the negative reception from the original staff, along with the criticism recieved by Asteroid Clara from film critics, prompted Toho to re-release the original film on December 25, 2030 as part of its 10th anniversary.\n\nGMA Network[]\n\nIn the Philippines the film received mixed reviews. #JusticeForLove: End of the World director Gina Alajar stated that the film now had nothing in common with the original other than the title, while Don Michael Perez (the director of Justice for Love Presents: The Obsession) mentioned that the film \"ditches the drama in favor of cinematic action\". Des Garbes-Severino, one of the lead writers, stated that the film \"fails to capture what Justice for Love is all about\". Lead star Yasmien Kurdi defended the film by stating \"while the film is completely different from the original, it is still fun and entertaining to watch\". Isabelle Abiera made no comment regarding the film.\n\nParamount Pictures[]\n\nParamount Pictures chairman and CEO Brian Robbins also disliked the film's treatment by Legendary, with John Krasinski, the attached director of the supposed 2023 remake at Paramount, being vocally critical of the finished film, blaming Legendary for allowing the production to fall so far off course from what he felt Justice for Love was all about. He argued that the studio's decision to replace the screenplay that Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier had worked on with Emmerich's completely different vision ultimately doomed the production to fail. The studio executives at Paramount, who previously rejected the earlier screenplay by Chris Sparling, eventually realized their mistake and believed that the screenplay had potential and stated that it would be more successful than Emmerich's film.\n\nAmy Heckerling and Alicia Silverstone[]\n\nClueless director and writer Amy Heckerling, the initial director of the 2023 remake under Paramount, later stated that the earlier screenplays, such as the one that Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier had written, were actually \"better\" than previously thought and, despite the changes made, it was still faithful towards the source material.

The sequel, which was titled Blood Moon: Justice for the World, was released on September 13, 2030 to mostly negative reviews. Despite this, it was a success at the box office, grossing $506.4 million.

It was directed and shot by Zack Snyder and written by Snyder, Roland Emmerich, Harald Kloser, Shay Hatten and Kurt Johnstad. After the resolution of the conflict between himself and Warner Bros., Snyder was interested in the franchise and asked Emmerich if he could direct an entry. The film was in production months before the prequel/third sequel was released. The film received mixed reviews and was a box office success as it grossed $545.6 million against a $198-223 million budget.\n\nA fifth installment acting as a standalone sequel, titled Justice for the World: Brothers in Arms, was released on October 20, 2036, starring Tom Cruise and Dwayne Johnson, to positive reviews and critical acclaim and grossed $693.9 million.

The Final Fate became the highest-grossing film in the franchise, grossing $1.125 billion.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAlessandra de Rossi and Yasmien Kurdi had previously appeared together in the 2007 Philippine TV series Pasan Ko ang Daigdig and in the 2014 Philippine TV series remake of the 1983-1985 Philippine TV series Yagit.
