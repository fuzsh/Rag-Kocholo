All other content, including this web page is for informational purposes only.\n\nApplicants to the MS in Translation and Interpreting should consult these Test Instructions for assessing language readiness.\n\nA master's degree in translation and interpreting is a graduate-level academic program designed to provide students and working professionals with advanced training in the fields of translation and interpreting. The New York University SPS MS in Translation and Interpreting online program is intended for students with proficiency in at least one language in addition to English and who seek to develop specialized skill sets in translating written texts and interpreting spoken communication.\n\nTranslators are in high demand across many languages given the global market for these professionals. The MS in Translation & Interpreting is open to applicants who wish to study translation from any language into English. The curriculum features terminology, research, revision, technology, and professionalization skills along with language-specific guidance.\n\nHaving a Master’s degree sets you apart and shortens the path to success in this rewarding career. Almost half of translators and interpreters surveyed by the American Translators Association hold master’s degrees. The MS in Translation & Interpreting program prepares its students for dynamic careers as highly skilled translators and language specialists.\n\nMany of our students take the American Translators Association (ATA) Certification Exam, which is a 3-hour test-based credential and an advantageous addition to your resume. By the end of the MS in Translation & Interpreting program, graduates translate at a level that meets the ILR skill descriptions for professional performance.\n\nTranslators work with written texts, while interpreters work with the spoken word. Students benefit from exposure to both practices, even though most professionals specialize in either translation or interpreting. In this program, students will master advanced strategies for translating complex documents and gain a foundation in the principles of interpreting.\n\nThe Master of Science in Translation and Interpreting at New York University was the first program to offer students a fully online degree in this discipline and has done so since 2012. We are also the only program to offer translation from any source language into English. Students will receive language-specific guidance in independent studies and the thesis project. We also designed the curriculum with the understanding that many translators and interpreters work in multiple language pairs. Our focus is on core skills in research, terminology, revision, technology, and professionalization to support translation from any language, along with the widest range of electives available.\n\nThe NYU SPS Admissions team carefully weighs each component of your application during the admissions review process to evaluate your ability to benefit from and contribute to the dynamic learning environment and the challenging curriculum that the NYU School of Professional Studies offers. Visit the NYU SPS Graduate Application Requirements and Deadlines page for additional information about our admission requirements. Applicants to the MS in Translation and Interpreting should also take the ACTFL Proficiency Test.\n\nA Master’s degree is the gold standard credential in the language professions. The decision to pursue a Master of Science in Translation and Interpreting depends on your career goals and interests. Meet with professionals in the field and current students to gather insights and learn how completing an online graduate program in translation and interpreting can help you fulfill your aspirations.\n\nTranslators' wages vary depending on several factors such as the specialization in which they work and their experience, work structure (freelance vs. salaried), and clientele. For example, salaried professionals working in advertising or computer systems design make $91,390 to $106,540 per year on average, while those working in elementary schools or local government make $56,490 to $63,680 per year on average according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Freelance language professionals can make into the six figures, according to the American Translators Association.\n\nThe demand for translation services can vary depending on factors such as geographic location, industries, and global economic trends. However, certain languages are consistently in high demand due to their widespread use in international business, diplomacy, and cultural exchange. Chinese, Spanish, and Arabic are examples of in-demand languages for translation services. Translators in other languages can specialize and succeed as well. The NYU SPS program has trained students in Arabic, Chinese, Farsi, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, and many others, including languages of lesser diffusion.\n\nWhile AI technologies have made significant advancements in the digital age, they are not likely to replace human translators any time soon. This is because, unlike a professional human translator, AI struggles with nuance, cultural understanding, humor, and creative expression. The future of translation and the language services industry is likely a collaborative one, with human translators and AI working together to provide accurately translated content. The NYU MS in Translation & Interpreting program has integrated AI throughout the curriculum, including in particular the Core courses in Translation Technologies and The Language Professions and electives from Transcreation and Marketing Translation to Patent Translation to Post-Editing Machine Translation. The teaching of up-to-date technologies, including AI, is a key component of our program’s learning outcomes. We also hold events about AI in the Professions.\n\nOur faculty and students report that translation careers are joyful, creative, and rewarding. Being a translator can be challenging, and the level of stress varies like any job, but translation is ultimately a fulfilling career that leverages your multilingual skills. Since many translators and interpreters are self-employed, you will also have options to take control of your career. The NYU Master’s program in Translation & Interpreting helps students track toward freelance or full-time employment based on your personal situation and preferences.\n\nTo start a career in translation, it's crucial to be fluent in at least two languages. From there, you can obtain a formal education to build your foundation and establish yourself as a professional in the field."
