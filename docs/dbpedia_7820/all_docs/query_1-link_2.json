Please check out a 3 sec of movie clip below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5FOv4WWGSK8\n\nThe subtitle says \"(daughter:)What about 3 00? (mom:) No, he's got a soccer game at 3 00.\"\n\nBut the words that a girl's mom says in the video never sounds like the same words in the subtitle.\n\nDo native English speakers really understand this, or are they just guessing the meaning from the context?\n\nAlso, if you could tell me some tips to get the skills to improve my listening comprehensive abilities for understanding this type of English that just sounds like a mysterious incantation, that would be really appreciated. Thank you."
