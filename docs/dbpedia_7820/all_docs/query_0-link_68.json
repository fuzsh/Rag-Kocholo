        "text": "June 19, 2011\n\n\"A woman may be the power behind a man, but she is not allowed to take power for herself.\"\n\nThis book is the story of two women, one an Empress and one who was Queen of England and begins in 1125. Matilda, married off at a young age is summoned home from Germany after the death of her husband the Emperor. Old king Henry may have plenty of bastards, but Matilda is his only legitimate heir and Henry wants her married well and to someone who can sire sons. Much to Matilda's displeasure, he picks the very young Geoffrey la Bel, Count of Anjou, but duty and honor always come first and they do well enough with each other despite a very rocky start. The second woman in the book is Adeliza of Louvain, king Henry's second wife, who is apparently unable to conceive the much-needed male heir. Matilda and Adeliza are close in age, and become good friends, but that relationship is sorely tried after the death of the old king when Stephen of Blois is conveniently poised and ready to steal Matilda's crown.\n\n\"The old king is dead and the rats are scurrying everywhere\"\n\nThe barons are most unwilling to let a woman rule them, but Matilda is not about to give up and she's aided by half-brother Robert of Gloucester and Brian Fitzcount. Adeliza is now married to William d'Aubigny who is loyal King Stephen, and while she sympathizes with Matilda's cause, her duty and honor to her husband comes first - and those conflicting loyalties and how it reflects the friendship between the two women are very much what this novel is about, along with the impact a long and bloody civil war has on the countryside and the people.\n\nThis is a complicated piece of history with many players, but I loved keeping the main focus on the relationship between Matilda and Adeliza and found it a very effective way of showing the reader a different side of Matilda, who had a reputation for being a bit of a termagant. Adeliza's devotion to the church and her charities was also an excellent way to show the more human aspects of the conflict and the great toll it took on the country. I very much enjoyed watching Matilda's relationship with her son and heir, especially after his *invasion* of England at fourteen. As with all of her novels, Chadwick excels at bringing the medieval period to life - prepare to let yourself be sucked into another century for the weekend. Thumbs up on the author's notes at the end where she tells us what is fact and what has been surmised. Lastly, a very big thumbs up for staying true to her character's devotion to God, honor and duty and not succumbing to the temptation of throwing in an affair that never happened just to spice up one's book. Five stars.\n\nMarch 13, 2016\n\nIt's pretty much a given that when a new Elizabeth Chadwick novel is announced, I preorder it. And when it arrives, everything gets jettisoned so that I can read it right away. Very few authors do that to me any more, and this one wasn't any different. I loved reading about Matilda in this and found her a fascinating and believable woman -- very few authors bother to take her out of the shrewish bitch that most history cast her as. Also, the contrast with Adeliza is terrific, and THE PROPOSAL scene -- OMG, talk about swoon! Loved it, just loved it.\n\nFor the longer review, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.mylot.com/post/2903022/rev...\n\nFebruary 18, 2017\n\nChadwick really knows how to make history personal and alive. She makes you feel what was at stake for the people involved, know their losses and fears, and she fills in the gaps between the known facts so plausibly.\n\nLady of the English tells the story of two women very close to power but ultimately unable to wield it in a man's world. The two women are very different. King Henry I's wife, Adeliza, is soft, empathetic, and physically weak. She is just looking for peace and stability, but is very loyal. She is one of the few characters who finds moments of happiness and peace. Although there is sadness too, she is a welcome break from the darker struggles of the succession that consume the rest of the kingdom. Her story provides a strong contrast with Henry's daughter, Matilda, and her never-ending railing against everyone.\n\nMatilda should have been Henry's heir but he passes her over because she is a woman. Her struggles against men throughout this are so frustrating, and the contempt that they show for her as a woman is horrifyingly accurate for the time. She was apparently considered a termagant, but Chadwick brings a different perspective, that of a woman fighting with everything she has to be strong for her son and her country against the mold placed on her by society. She takes quite a beating along the way, and sacrifices pretty much everything. This one quote gets right at the heart of it: “Do you think you are the only one with a pile of ashes in your hearth? I burned my dreams to build my nightmares.”\n\nIt was not always easy to read, and my hopes for Matilda to find some happiness in something were not met. I suppose that's what happens when the story is history. You can't invent happiness without leaving the facts behind.\n\nOctober 29, 2014\n\nElizabeth Chadwick purports to tell the story of Empress Matilda/Maud and her cousin Stephen's battle for the throne of England and Normandy upon the death of her father Henry I. I'm an avid reader of English medieval historical fiction, but I've long avoided reading any of Chadwick's books after reading many unfavorable comments about her work. And now I understand those comments. Comparing her work to an A-list author of historical fiction such as Sharon Kay Penman is akin to comparing Jerry Lewis to Sir Laurence Olivier.\n\nAs far as her research is considered, it is not legitimate research. (See my comments about Akasich research at the end of this review.\n\nCalling this book historical fiction is painting lipstick on a pig (apologies to Sarah Palin). Some of the problems are her failure to stay close to the historical record, a flawed attempt at using the argot of the age to where some of the conversation is meaningless and an over emphasis on descriptive sexual acts. Every character in the story is rolling around in the sack at some time in the narrative. And it tells me more about the various acts than I want/need to be told.\n\nHer writing style and choice of words are downright silly in many cases.\n\nOne example --\"Their cloaks billowed against each other, performing a wild mating dance.\"\n\nAnd she has to throw in some 50 Shades stuff too -- \"...her loins moist with need.\" \"She set her hands between her thighs and felt the slipperiness of his seed and hoped that this time she would succeed.\"\n\nAnd she can't Just say the queen's water broke -- \"...she felt a strange sensation deep inside her body, followed by a gush of biblical proportions between her thighs, drenching her chemise and gown and puddling the rushes.\"\n\nExcuse me, but are we supposed to take this author seriously?\n\nTo top it off, she ends the book without resolving the conflict. She does give a hint, But even there, Chadwick has it all wrong.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin comes in her remarks at the end of the book. She credits a lot of her information to the Akashic records. This form of research can't even be called dubious. In Akashic \"research\" a psychic uses \"invisible records\" and history is revealed to him/her.\n\nIf you want to read some credible historical fiction about this royal dispute, read \"When Christ and His Saints Slept\" by Penman.\n\nApril 6, 2016\n\nHá muito tempo atrás, eu era uma leitora de apenas 1 género: ficção histórica. Apenas lia este género, torcendo o nariz a todos os outros, até ter apanhado umas quantas \"barretadas\" com uma autora que eu adorava, e me ter afastado. Também porque, de tanto ler dentro do mesmo género, fiquei em burnout - nem queria ver livros de hist-fic ao pé de mim. Durante uns tempos mantive-me afastada deste género de literatura, com algum medo de não conseguir voltar.\n\nMas, eis que aparece este livro, que me tirou por completo da ressaca literária por hist-fic.\n\nMuito bem escrito, muto bem pesquisado - nota-se o trabalho que a autora teve - envolvente e falando de um período da história inglesa que não é muito abordado - os reis do fim do medievalismo.\n\nEntão, esta é a história de Matilda, filha do Rei Henrique I de Inglaterra e mãe do futuro Rei Henrique II, o tal que roubou Leonor de Aquitânia ao Rei Luis XI de França. E que teve que enfrentar a sua mulher e filhos para manter o coroa na cabeça. Mas adianto-me ao enredo aqui apresentado.\n\nO livro começa com Matilda a enterrar o seu primeiro marido, o Imperador Heinrich na Alemanha (ou nos terrenos correspondentes a tal) e a ser chamada á corte do senhor seu pai. Escusado será dizer que ele tem planos para ela, que incluem um casamento (mais um) estratégico. Ela faz-lhe a vontade, mas muito a contragosto, pois o tempo que passou como Imperatriz a habituou a um nível de deferência e estatuto, que não encontra neste casamento. A Inglaterra está segura na mão do seu pai, mas até quando?\n\nMatilda tem um génio que poucas mulheres se atreveriam a demonstrar na sua época - tem inteligência, beleza e obstinaçao. Tudo qualidades hoje em dia, naquela altura nem tanto.\n\nO enredo desenvolve-se a partir desta premissa. Está muito bem escrito, flui muito bem pelas páginas fora e mesmo lendo em inglês, achei o nivel de linguagem acessível.\n\nA minha classificação original seria de 4 estrelas, mas decidi dar a estrela extra por me ter restaurado a fé nos romances históricos.\n\nFebruary 5, 2017\n\nThis book is a retelling of the life of Empress Matilda (also known as Maude). It presents her sympathetically, as a strong woman who was frustrated by the limitations put on her ambition by a patriarchal society. It contrasts Matilda's life with that of her stepmother, the virtuous Adeliza of Louvain. Adeliza seems to start out as a secondary character but gains in importance as the novel progresses. While both women go through two marriages and experience lack of offspring followed by successful childbearing, that is where the similarity ends.\n\nThis book does a good job of conveying the complexities of life at a time of civil war (known as the Anarchy) when people's political and personal loyalties shifted unpredictably. Chadwick has filled in the details of this medieval world with painstaking care. There are a lot of details about travel, warfare, armour, clothing, food, medicine, pregnancy and childbirth, religious practices, etc.\n\nThis is romance as well as historical fiction. Influenced no doubt by TV series such as The Tudors, I expected to find erotic episodes detailing the dalliances of royals and nobles. These are discussed certainly but for the most part kept offstage. While there are a few \"bodice ripper\" scenes (which tend to take place between married couples), many of the characters (especially Matilda) show surprising restraint.\n\nI read this rather long novel surprisingly quickly. Perhaps the only drawback (and it's a slight one) is that it's occasionally difficult to keep track of who the minor characters are, how they're related and what side they are on. But some of that is to be expected in a novel about civil war.\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n“Read an Elizabeth Chadwick novel!” “You’ll love her!” has been the chorus of many of my friends and acquaintances in recent months after I made the shocking revelation that I’d never read one of her novels. I don’t know why, in all honesty, I just never did. With my friends voices in mind, I will admit to being very unsure of this novel before I started reading it. What if it had been oversold? What if I was underwhelmed? If I didn’t like it, would my mates all think I was weird?\n\nTurns out I had nothing to worry about, because this novel was a terrific read. The women in the story, Empress Matilda and her stepmother Adeliza of Louvain, were brought to life brilliantly; Adeliza’s fears and inner conflicts contrasted well with Matilda’s determination to succeed, her majesty and haughty nature. Geoffrey of Anjou triggered a huge reaction from me, and I felt for both him and Matilda with their relationship struggles. I loved seeing young Henry Plantagenet grow into someone really special, he shone from the pages when part of a scene.\n\nElizabeth has filled in the gaps of the historical record well, and has stuck to known events in every possible case. None of the usual historical fiction ‘sins’ have been committed; you will not find an illegitimate prince or a bizarre affair in these pages! I really felt this novel told a great story with excellent historical integrity, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. So yes, masses, you were correct. I did enjoy an Elizabeth Chadwick novel, and I will read another.\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\nCaveat. I did not finish this book. I'm not going to finish this book. So maybe this isn't a fair review but ...\n\nI picked up this book because since I grew up in a British colony, I am a huge fan of English history. Not only the picture on the cover, but the advertising led me to believe that this was the story of a strong woman. No. If there were fewer characters and it was set in modern times, this is a Lifetime Network movie-of-the-week waiting to happen. In this book, women are victims and there is no way out. Maybe by the end of the story the woman on the cover of the book is going to 'overcome' all the evil men and become the queen. Whatever. It will just be *that* version of the Lifetime movie. It isn't a bodice ripper ... but it isn't far from it. I'm not a prude. There are times when sex and violence are necessary to show how a culture works (See James Clavell in Shogun) but sex and violence without a reason is demeaning to the characters they represent. In the case of this book ... all women. I could go on, but obviously, this book was just not my English cup of tea.\n\nSeptember 11, 2011\n\nNo one does medieval historical fiction quite like Elizabeth Chadwick, and her latest novel, Lady of the English is just one more example of her enormous talent for bringing the past to life!\n\nMatilda has just returned to England after the death of husband, the German Emperor and is welcomed by her father, King Henry I and his wife, Adeliza. The two women become fast friends and a true companionship begins. Before King Henry’s death he makes his noblemen pledge their allegiance to his daughter Matilda as heir, but when the time comes they defy his wishes and her cousin Stephen assumes the throne. Matilda won’t back down without a fight and that’s exactly what she gives him. Factions soon form and the battle is on. Poor Adeliza is caught in the middle of the two sides as her new husband is fighting for Stephen. Adeliza knows that Matilda is the rightful ruler of England, but she loves her husband and wants to be loyal to both.\n\nThe characters of Matilda and Adeliza were portrayed wonderfully and Chadwick gives the reader such insight into each woman that when you finish the book you feel as if you’re saying goodbye to a friend. Chadwick’s impeccable research and knowledge of the medieval time period is, as always, very evident and her use of Akashic Records makes her novels that much more so and gives her that extra edge. I cannot recommend Elizabeth Chadwick novels enough, if you haven’t checked her out yet you are really missing out!\n\nAugust 5, 2015\n\nIt is 1135. The Old King, Henry I, is dead and his heir is his daughter Matilda, former Empress of Germany and a determined and intelligent Queen-in-Waiting. However, due to the inherent misogyny of the medieval era and the unwillingness of the Barons of England and Normandy to bend the knee to a woman, Matilda is unjustly usurped from her throne by her cousin Stephen and so begins the Anarchy; a civil war that consumes both kingdoms in the inferno of war, famine and rampant murder and robbery. Despite her best efforts, Matilda or \"Domina\" cannot reclaim England or she herself properly crowned as Queen in Westminster Abbey. Despite the numerous raids, counter-raids, murder, betrayals, plotting and battles, Matilda passes on her legacy and her right to England to her eldest son, Henry who succeeds Stephen as Henry II.\n\nLady of the English is a fascinating and engrossing read. I thoroughly enjoyed Matilda's story and her growth arc; for a woman born into such a patriarchal and narrow minded society, Matilda showed tremendous bravery, tenacity and political insight (well, nearly always). What I loved best about her portrayal was how much her character, ambitions and beliefs were of her time and era. Anytime I happen to come across characters that exhibit anachronistic and thoroughly modern beliefs, especially in a medieval setting, I inwardly groan in despair. There's just something so off-putting and disbelieving about it. Thankfully, never once do the characters in Lady of the English show such traits, especially Matilda. Although at times she rails against the discrimination and prejudice she faces as a woman, there are no pseudo-feminist speeches to be found here! Matilda is an admirable and sympathetic character and hence my favourite. She never gives, always thinks through what she must do to succeed and is determined to secure her sons inheritance. Bravery is not the word.\n\nHer poignant relationship with her young step mother, Adeliza of Louvain, is one of the key features of the novel. their relationship is strong and trusting but is constantly tested by divided loyalty to the proper monarch. Despite being deeply religious and much more demure and submissive then her stalwart step-daughter, Adeliza is an interesting and thoughtful character. Her despair at being unable to give her first husband an heir is palpable and heart-breaking and this childlessness is one of her defining characteristics as both a wife and a queen. I'm still wondering how she went on to five birth to six children by her second husband, William D'Albini! Henry I was such a bad-ass and politically devious king; so amoral and vindictive against any who defied him. God what a guy!\n\nThe historical background and setting is top-notch and brilliantly researched. The pages of the Lady of the English is soaked through and through with vivid historical detail and interesting facts. In every chapter, we are reminded again and again that this is a medieval society of kings and queens, dukes and duchesses, castles and thatched houses, knights and archers, dirt roads and highway robbers, where religion governed all aspects of life and where politics and diplomacy often ended in murder and betrayal. What a fascinating time!\n\nAll in all, I would thoroughly recommend lady of the English to anyone interested in learning more about Matilda, her place in history and how she fought so hard and long for what was rightfully hers. Thoughtful, serious and expertly written, Lady of the English is one of Elizabeth Chadwick's best novels.\n\nAdios!\n\nJanuary 15, 2024\n\nI have said it before and I shall say it again, Elizabeth Chadwick is definitely a time traveler. Seriously. Every time, I open one of her historical novels I lose myself in the storyline and feel that I am watching all these scenes come back to life. \" Lady of the English\" surrounds the turmoil that took place in England as Empress Matilda(granddaughter of William the Conqueror, daughter of Henry I, and mother of Henry II) and Stephen ( mother Adela, was the daughter of William the Conqueror) battle for the English throne. We also are given the storyline of Matilda's stepmother, Adeliza and her second marriage to a member of the English court.\n\nI felt that this book was an intense read from start to finish and I really enjoyed it. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys strong female characters.\n\nGoodreads review published 29/11/24\n\nJune 9, 2011\n\nAnother fantastic read from Elizabeth Chadwick\n\nCan't wait for her take on Eleanor and Henry in the upcoming trilogy. Is it a bit unfair to start asking when it is going to be out?\n\nLoved the use of Matilda/Brian and Adeliza/Will to tell the two sides of the story, and one of the highlights was the shining energy of Matilda's son Henry, destined to become Henry II.\n\nAugust 7, 2019\n\nThe Lady of the English is an interesting story about this little-known slice of history and the woman who spent so much of her life in truth preparing another and those around her for the role of ruling the formidable Kingdom of England. Fascinating Middle Ages historical fiction!\n\nAugust 28, 2012\n\nI am hooked on Elizabeth Chadwick. She could pen comic books and I'd be the first in line to buy them. There are few authors in the historical fiction genre who bring the past to life in such a vivid fashion and Chadwick is one of the best. Along with Eleanor of Aquitaine and of course Elizabeth I, the Empress Matilda has always fascinated me as yet another strong woman seeking to dictate her own destiny. I actually have to thank the brilliant Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael mysteries for causing me to fall in love with thie turbulent time period of English history.\n\nMatilda has few soft edges to her and she can come off as driven, ambitious and cold. Ironically these are traits that would be celebrated in a male, but were/are thought of as \"unnatural\" in a woman. From the few historical accounts I've read about her, granted she wasn't warm and fluffy, but I'm good with that. She was a woman literally cheated from her rightful inheritance by men who couldn't see themselves ever following a woman as head of their countryb just because she was a woman. I'd be pretty pissed off too. Just as I wrote in my review for When Christ and His Saints Slept, the real tragedy is that so many innocent people suffered and died because of ignorant sexism. History bears out that Stephen turned out to be a less than stellar king. Worse, this is a story about the greed of the nobility--many of whom behaved less than noble--and their pursuit of power at the expense of the people.\n\nFrankly, I liked Matilda. I liked her steely determination in the face of insurmountable odds as she fought to reclaim what was rightfully hers. I understood her anger at not being listened to because of her sex and her disgust that her only worth was as a brood mare. In fact, all of the female characters in this book are far more interesting in their bonds of sisterhood, which are far stronger than that of most of the men, who shift allegiances at whim.\n\nLike all of Chadwick's books, I was entranced from page one and hated for the end. She brings tne medieval world to glorious life and it's a shame that none of her books has been thought of to be made into an awesome series. I can easily see the BBC doing a smashing job!\n\nOctober 20, 2011\n\nElizabeth Chadwick’s latest release tells the story of two women who at one point in their lives held the title of Lady of the English: Adeliza, queen of Henry I, and her stepdaughter, Matilda, Henry’s heir.\n\nAdeliza and Matilda are very different women. Adeliza plays the role of a consort to perfection, with one exception – she fails to provide an heir. This means that Matilda has to take on an impossible role – that of reigning queen at a time when women were considered unfit to rule. While Matilda struggles to wrest control of England from her usurping cousin Stephen, Adeliza, a widowed queen, has to find a way to rebuild her life.\n\nAs a contrast to the two queens, there is a wonderful gallery of royal men: the ruthless and calculating Henry I; Geoffrey of Anjou, Matilda’s brilliant but volatile consort, and their son, the future Henry II, intelligent, restless and warlike, a golden prince who becomes the focus of Matilda’s fight for the crown.\n\nThe book is rich in the texture of medieval life, pervaded with twelfth century imagery. Elizabeth Chadwick’s writing is vividly descriptive. You will feel the chill of the snow, smell the venision stew, see castle walls rise out of the mist and hear the chanting of monks and the clash of swords.\n\nThe conflict between characters caught between their religious beliefs and the bloody civil war they have to wage is conveyed with understanding and conviction. These are people of their time. Matilda correctly predicts that her son will be one of England’s greatest kings, and that his line will endure long into the future, but she can’t see ahead to a time when women would be able both to reign and to rule.\n\nMy only complaint is that I would have loved the book to be twice as long, but that might have diminished the focus on Matilda and Adeliza which gives it its strength. As with Sharon Kay Penman’s When Christ and His Saints Slept, which covers the same period, my favourite scene was Matilda’s amazing escape from a besieged and snowbound Oxford castle. Matilda might not have been able to command an army in the field, but she would have coped fine with a wilderness survival course!\n\nLady of the English is recommended for anyone who wants to open a window to the horrors and glories of England’s royal past.\n\nJuly 19, 2018\n\nSolid 4.5 stars\n\nElizabeth Chadwick is one of my favorite historical fiction authors due to her excellent grasp of the facts and her gift of storytelling.\n\nOur protagonist is a hard one to write about as the facts we have are that she could be a bit snarlish. I thought that the way that Ms Chadwick crafted the stories around why that might be (put together with the historical views of women and their places in society such as it being legal to beat your wife) was so well thought out. It was compassionate, without being too much of a stretch and lended Matilda dignity. Also enjoyed the other main character, Adeliza. I didn’t know of her (not much is known) and the paltry facts we do have were fleshed out in a way that really lended to the story.\n\nHighly readable and enjoyable!\n\nDecember 26, 2011\n\nI decided to read this book because a quote on the back from Sharron Kay Pennman compared the author to Dorothy Dunnett. I can only assume that SKP either did not read this book, has not read Dunnett, or has confused her with Phillipa Gregory. That said, sometimes you want a trashy novel...but this woman considers sessions with her psychic to be \"research.\" Seek not for truth in these pages.\n\nNovember 3, 2011\n\nElizabeth Chadwick does it again... what a fabulous book!!! Even after 500 pgs... I still absolutely hate for her books to end!!! Amazing story telling that makes history come alive!!!\n\nJune 20, 2022\n\nWhen King Henry I’s son and heir to the throne met his maker with the sinking of The White Ship; England’s line of concession was contested and several individuals were chomping at the bit to become the next in line to wear the crown. Henry insinuated (and had nobles pledge their honor) that his daughter Matilda and her offspring would hold the throne; but many wanted the spot reserved for his nephew, Matilda’s cousin, Stephen of Blois. Even if you are unfamiliar with this time period in English history; you can assume the consequences of such conflict. Historical-fiction novelist queen (pun intended) Elizabeth Chadwick reveals the world of Matilda and her fight for what was inherently hers in, “Lady of the English: One Queen, One Empress and the Crown that Would Defeat Them Both”.\n\nChadwick doesn’t waste a moment to sprint into the story of Matilda beginning with her childhood and the royal court of King Henry I and his Queen Consort, Adeliza (Matilda’s step-mother). As per usual, Chadwick relies heavily on history to progress the plot of “Lady of the English” rather than focus overly on historical liberties of fluffy, filler material. This doesn’t mean that this concept is absent entirely from Chadwick’s novel – it is fiction, after all – but on average, “Lady of the English” will satisfy history buffs. Chadwick does include some sex scenes (I suppose the bodice-ripper crows needs a morsel thrown at them); but there are not overly extensive or tacky, luckily.\n\nChadwick is a master at weaving a vivid atmospheric tapestry and fast-paced suspense while describing such with glorious literary language. Readers will experience breathless, envious moments at the velvety text. Yet, “Lady of the English” remains accessible and easy-to-read carrying an organic air that by no means is pretentious or “tries too hard”.\n\n“Lady of the English” fortifies the text with elements of character-study emphasizing the development and arcs of Henry, Adeliza, Matilda, Geoffrey of Anjou (her husband), etc; even alternating the narrative voice among them. This helps provide an intricate web perspective of the events and therefore genuinely educates on the history. It can be argued that Matilda’s characterization is a bit surface, one-dimensional and unlikable; but perhaps that was Chadwick’s intention rather than that of rehabilitation. Regardless, a bit more evolution would have been welcome.\n\nChadwick’s “Lady of the English” is not without some flaws that do stand out. The text emphasizes dialogue and, “As you know, Bob” conversations that often describe events more so than ‘living’ them which can become tedious and repetitive and therefore slows the pace with little action taking place. Additionally, “Lady of the English” takes large jumps in chronology between (and even, within) chapters which causes reader pause or even at times: confusion. These aren’t overly detrimental to the plot/story but it does take away from credibility.\n\n“Lady of the English” includes some foreshadowing of true history events that are interspersed into the story in an organic way that feel like ‘Easter eggs’ to those familiar with the timeline. This adds drama to “Lady of the English” and presses it forward.\n\nNaturally, the intrigue is heightened to a climatic point when Matilda attempts to take back the crown from Stephen (and also secure it for her son, the future King Henry II). The pace quickens with Matilda demonstrating more depth and revealing a sliver of her psyche. However, Chadwick misses opportunities to show events and instead skims over them leaving readers with unanswered questions. For example, from one paragraph to the next, Matilda has the crown and then loses it and Stephen is king, again. How did this happen? “Lady of the English” is occasionally clunky and disjointed.\n\nEven more climatic/emotive is Chadwick’s portrayal of Matilda’s famed escape from Oxford Castle in a snow storm during the black of night. Both Matilda’s characterization and the events leap from the pages of “Lady of the English” at this point; and continue the heat in the subsequent pages especially with the addition of Henry FitzEmpress.\n\nThe conclusion of “Lady of the English” feels slightly weakened, constrained and less powerful than the former chapters; but not to an extent that damages the integrity of the novel as a whole. Chadwick redeems this with an ‘Author’s Note’ explaining the aftermath of events/figures, interesting factoids and historical liberties taken within “Lady of the English”. A light bibliography is also included to encourage further reading on the subject.\n\n“Lady of the English” is not without some faults but is regardless an educational and entertaining look at the Empress Matilda that will satisfy novice readers or those deeply-entrenched in the topic without the use of filler fluff and while escapist literary language.\n\nDecember 12, 2017\n\nSharon Penman is perhaps my favorite author of historical novels, but sometimes I don't feel like the investment of time and brain cells she requires of me. This was my first Chadwick historical (but certainly hasn't been my last) and I was delighted to find that she, like Penman, offers up very enjoyable, readable historical fiction, breathing life and humanity into the historical time and characters without sacrificing accuracy, but with a somewhat less epic scope than Penman.\n\nHere in Chadwick's take on Empress Matilda and King Stephen's power struggle in 12th century England, she has focused mainly on Matilda, daughter of Henry I and mother of future King Henry II, and Adeliza, Henry I's second wife, who was close in age to Matilda and probably close to her in affection also. Penman's take on the same topic in When Christ and His Saints Slept: A Novel is more all-encompassing and delves more deeply also into the character of King Stephen, his wife, and many other historical figures involved in this civil war.\n\nThe period of civil war between Matilda and her cousin Stephen lasted 19 years in the 1100s, divided and devastated the country, and was only resolved when Stephen agreed to name as heir to the throne Matilda's son Henry rather than his own son Eustace upon Stephen's death. It's a fascinating period in English history that probably many are familiar with from reading Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth, seeing the miniseries The Pillars of the Earth, reading Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael mystery series (e.g., A Morbid Taste for Bones: The First Chronicle of Brother Cadfael) or the BBC television series based on Peters' books, to name a few taking place in that period of time.\n\nChadwick's focus on Matilda and Adeliza in many ways enhances the reader's enjoyment. She still gives you the feel for the period, the way people lived at that time. You can almost see, hear, and smell what's going on as you are reading. She's the perfect author for readers like me who enjoy not only historical fiction but also historical romance (oh, the horror!) and she's someone you can read on public transportation without embarrassment or shame. I'm off to read more of Chadwick's medieval fiction.\n\nDecember 23, 2013\n\nI read this book because it was reviewed by Sharon Kay Penman, but it is clear that she was simply being polite when she recommended it. The book is a pale comparison to Penman's own \"When Christ and his Saints Slept\", and her subsequent treatments of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine in \"Time and Chance\" and \"The Devil's Brood\". The characters are so narrowly drawn and the historical descriptions so lacking that there is no depth--and no real reason to become involved or even care about the players. There is literally no description of any military action, and one would hardly know King Stephen or his persona in the slightest. Empress Matilda, the central character, was undoubtedly a controversial woman in history, and she has been sorely mistreated in this novel. At once mean and unpleasant, the author will tell the reader how difficult it is for Matilda to be a woman and a ruler, and in the next passage talk about how Matilda is grumpy on account of having her period. It is difficult to draw real conclusions about historical characters, especially women, when the author herself succumbs to such stereotypes. The author further acknowledges in her notes that her historical sources (all men, of course) describe Matilda in various negative ways. I would have hoped that the author would have taken that for what it was worth and explored this character more thoroughly. All told, a terrible book. I recommend \"When Christ and his Saints Slept\" as far more compelling and interesting. Don't waste your time with this one.\n\nMay 29, 2011\n\n\"If she thought a man was a fool, she said so to his face in front of others, and gave no quarter. She was tall, slender, beautiful, desirable..\"\n\nThis is how Empress Mathilda is described. This is the woman this novel is about. She was the daughter and the only surviving heir to Henry I. The men of England got on their knees three times in front of her and three times, swore to uphold her as their queen. When her father died, however, they upheld her cousin Stephen instead. Mathilda was enraged and thus, a battle began to retain her crown and her country for not necessarily herself, but her heirs.

Her characters are well-researched and fleshed out in a way that makes you feel as if you are watching events unfold before your eyes. Prior to reading this book, I had no knowledge of the empress Matilda, daughter of King Henry I, or his wife, Adeliza. So often in history we learn about the men involved, but the women are only a side-note, with their greatest accomplishments being the bearing of heirs. It is refreshing to read a historical novel that doesn't sugarcoat this fact, but instead shows how these women struggled with and eventually overcame these barriers to make their mark on history.\n\nDecember 7, 2015\n\nThis was a great historical story of Henry I's daughter, Matilda, and her fight for the English throne. I love Elizabeth Chadwick's books as I feel I get a fantastic history lesson while enjoying myself! She sticks to the facts as much as possible and the stories are very real.\n\nThis time period and the circumstances of this particular situation are honestly rather sad and frustrating. The ending with Will & Adeliza I found to be very sad but I could also understand Adeliza's position (to some extent). I never would've done what she did, but ok. Times were different then...\n\nI have a few more un-read Elizabeth Chadwick books and I look forward to them....\n\nDecember 15, 2021\n\nEmanuela - per RFS\n\n.\n\nRitorna la penna dell’autrice della saga di Eleonora d’Aquitania, che ci regala la storia di una donna speciale, una sovrana che tanto ha fatto per l’Inghilterra.\n\nStavolta tocca a Matilde, giovane sposa di Heinrich Imperatore del Sacro Romano Impero, rimasta vedova all’età di ventitré anni e costretta a tornare in patria alla corte del padre, Re Enrico I d’Inghilterra.\n\nL’uomo, non avendo altri eredi, fa risposare Matilde con Goffredo V, un ragazzino molto più giovane di lei e figlio del Conte d’Angiò. Sebbene l’attrazione verso il marito sia forte, ella è decisa a conquistare la corona della successione nel momento in cui muore il padre.\n\nAppoggiata da Adeliza, la sua matrigna coetanea, inizia una strenua lotta contro i Baroni Normanni, che si sono invece schierati con Stefano I, il quale nel frattempo ha approfittato del trono vuoto e si è imposto come legittimo Re.\n\nLa nascita di Enrico, figlio suo e di Goffredo, farà sì che Matilde si ponga come obiettivo quello di renderlo il legittimo erede al trono.\n\nNella lotta le saranno a fianco molti nobili devoti, tra cui spicca Brian FitzCount segretamente innamorato di lei.\n\nLa scrittrice è, a giusto titolo, ritenuta la migliore autrice di fiction medievale vivente, per la grande capacità di mixare la fantasia con la storia, arricchendo ogni pagina con dettagli che raccontano nei minimi particolari la vita e la quotidianità nel 1100. Un’epoca lontana durante la quale in Inghilterra la Chiesa Cattolica aveva ancora un grande potere sia religioso che temporale, e dove la vita era governata dalle stagioni come dagli umori dei Re.\n\nLa figura di Matilde, da sempre ammantata di leggenda e sulla quale esistono poche testimonianze scritte, ci appare come una donna intelligente, una femminista ante litteram che seppe governare nel miglior modo possibile in un periodo storico in cui il sesso femminile, di qualunque posizione sociale, doveva conservare riservatezza e sottomissione all’uomo.\n\nMi è piaciuta moltissimo la storia nella storia di Adeliza, giovane vedova del Re Enrico, destinata a un’apparente sterilità ma che ritrova, nel grande amore con il nuovo marito Elmo d’Albini, una nuova opportunità. Insieme ebbero infatti ben sei figli e per lei Elmo costruì il bellissimo Castel Rising nel Norfolk, famoso per le sue innovative latrine e ancora di proprietà degli eredi della coppia.\n\nUn romanzo storico che non può mancare nella rosa delle vostre nuove letture.\n\nFebruary 11, 2022\n\nAudio book\n\nNarrator: Patience Tomlinson\n\nYears: approx 1125 to 1148\n\nMain characters: Matilda, Adeliza, Geoffrey, Willaim d'Albini, young King Henry\n\nVery interesting...had me running to Google many, many times. Perhaps I should have read instead of listening to the audio. Narrator did not make Matilda sound very likable...but I doubt very much that Matilda would care. She had to be strong in a man's world and was not trying to win a popularity contest and for that I do admire her.\n\nDecember 27, 2018\n\nWhat I really like about Chadwick is her use of doubling. She does this quite well when looking at the roles and spaces women were forced to inhabit."
