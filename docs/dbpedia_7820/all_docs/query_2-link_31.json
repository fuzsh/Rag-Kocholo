        "text": "THIS is not a feminist pronouncement but a characteristic touch of Jane Austen's irony: The pen was now in her hand, and the warning not to trust books necessarily recoils on the text in which it is inscribed. At the “Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to exam pies in books. Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands. I will not allow books to prove anything.” same time Jane Austen is, of course, making a serious point. The pen had been mainly in the man's hand: It was the male who effectively owned and controlled the discourses within which the woman had to move and have (or fail to have) her being. So when the woman took up the pen, she was, in a certain sense, venturing into a male‐dominated realm, engaging in an activity traditionally reserved for males (except for letters and other kinds of private documents). Men held the pen, and — with a few exceptions—only men published. Hence, partly, the degree of anonymity and the extensive use of pseudonyms employed by women writers in the 19th century. It is as though part of them felt that they were engaging in an “unfeminine” activity — or recognized that men would not always welcome the intrusion of women into their privileged realm.\n\nA PORTRAIT OF JANE AUSTEN By David Cecil. Illustrated. 208 pp. New York: Hill and Wang. $19.95. JANE AUSTEN'S NOVELS Social Change and Literary Form. By Julia Prewitt Brown. 185 pp. Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press. $10.\n\nJane Austen writes, on the title pages of her novels, assertively and modestly, — “By a Lady”: the name withheld, the sex proclaimed. This is not an aggressive combative tactic nor is it a mystification; on the contrary, It is partly an act of seemly self‐effacement, partly a matter of tact, and partly — I think — an overt recognition that when a lady took up the pen, she would, necessarily, address herself to matters different from those with which men were engaged, and, perforce, write of the world in a different manner and from a perspective different from those of the male. No matter how much Jane Austen admired Dr. Johnson, Samuel Richardson and George Crabbe, she might incorporate some of their qualities and strengths in her writing, but she could not write of so the world nor create fictions in their way. Which was, as far as her readers were and are concerned, all gain. Or nearly all — there have been critics who felt that because access to much of the male world of experience was denied to Jane Austen, her work must, comparably, be limited. But it is a specious argument and has found little intelligent support.\n\nWhat has proved to be perennially interesting is the question: How did her genius enable her to extract so much of seemingly universal and lasting significance from what is essentially a single subject, namely courtship? How did the “lady” transform what has often been regarded as a subject of distinctly feminine interest into a series of novels that have pleased many, and pleased so long? The two books in hand offer a variety of answers.\n\nDavid Cecil's views about Jane Austen have not, by his own account, changed since 1935, nor indeed have his critical language and approach. Her works are “penetratingly true pictures of human life and artistic achievements of Mozartian perfection.” Nothing wrong with that, of course, but it doesn't really get us Continued from Page 7 very far. But then for Lord David, Jane Austen is an unproblematical writer creating in happy harmony with the society and the times in which she was fortunate enough to live. “Writers who feel themselves at odds with the world they live in tend to be tiresomely aggressive…. Jane Austen wrote with the wind behind her….”\n\nBy this definition, Lord David's list of “tiresomely aggressive” writers must be tolerably long by now, and no doubt getting longer. What is clear is that he is entirely happy writing about Jane Austen, and entirely assured of the relative serenity of her life, and thus her work. I think I am right in recalling a remark by Lord David that “the person who does not like Jane Austen does not like sunshine and truth.” This is a kind of criticism that a younger generation has been taught to smile at, and it is true that Lord David's writing on Jane Austen seems almost a little archaic, unfashionable enough to be in its way at times positively engaging. What he offers us in this handsome volume is just what he says — “A Portrait of Jane Austen.” He relates all the known biographical material in a very lucid, readable way, including the ramifications of the Austen family and what happened to the various aunts and uncles, nephews and nieces, and so on. He gives an account of all we know — practically nothing concerning the mysterious young man she met in Sidmouth in 1801 and the rather strange episode of a year later, when it seems that one of her friends, Harris Bigg‐Wither, proposed to her, and she accepted, only to break off the engagement the next morning in a very upset state.\n\nHe also describes the clergyman, Sydney Smith, who was in Bath when Jane Austen visited that town in 1797, and who may have been the model for Henry Tilney — though here, as elsewhere, Lord David falls candidly into fond conjecture: “I may be yielding to a temptation that often besets biographers; namely to put forward a view on insufficient grounds just because I should like it to be true. But I cannot resist doing so.”\n\nThere were a number of unusual episodes in Jane Austen's life, but not many, and most of those involved one relation or other. Thus, her aunt, Mrs. Leigh Perrot, was actually imprisoned on the charge of stealing some white lace — a charge that, as Lord David reminds us, could have been punished by transportation or hanging! She was cleared in court — but it reminds us of a world that may not intrude in Jane Austen's novel, but which she certainly knew about. And the husband of one of her cousins — Eliza de Feuillide — was guillotined; a rather unlikely whiff of the French Revolution thus entered Jane Austen's mainly placid life.\n\nFor the most part, the story of Jane Austen is the story of her family, of the moves they made, the houses they inhabited. There is, of course, the more secret story of the development of Jane Austen the writer — but there are limits to what one can tell of this particular story, and Lord David, wisely, seldom goes beyond them.\n\nHe can tell us when she wrote (at the age of 34 she settled down to writing and produced all her novels in the next seven and a half years); where she wrote (the handsome little cottage at Chawton, given to Jane, her mother and her sister Cassandra by their brother Edward); the conditions under which she wrote (lacking a private room, she worked in the combined hall and dining room — “She wrote on small pieces of paper because this made it easier for her, if interrupted, to slip them into a drawer or under a blotter. The room led, by way of a swing door, to the kitchen and other offices. Though this door creaked disagreeably, Jane Austen asked that it should be allowed to go on doing so. Her unspoken reason was that the creak gave her warning that’ someone was coming, so that she had time to hide her manuscript before he or she entered.”). He can document both Jane Austen's “obsessive secrecy about her writing” and give details of its success in the world. But beyond that, the only story we can have is the product of the story — the novels themselves. It is, we might think, enough.\n\nThe other story, of Jane Austen the daughter and sister, remains fairly uneventful (“You know how interesting the purchase of a sponge cake is to me,” she wrote to Cassandra). For Lord David it was a very happy life. Despite the violent history and dramatic social changes that were taking place during Jane Austen's lifetime, Lord David still sees her society as “combining good sense, good manners and cultivated intelligence, rational piety and a spirited sense of fun.” Existence then had a “peculiar amenity” and the Austens’ way of life was “peaceful, comfortable and leisurely, free from anxiety about its future, worrying little about politics and world events.” These are the qualities that Lord David finds and tends to stress in Jane Austen's own work — it is full of fun, cheerfulness, sanity, and free of anxiety and real trouble.\n\nJane Austen knew the limits of her knowledge (thus, as Lord David points out, she never describes a scene at which no woman is present and, in her own words, she “quits” such “odious subjects” as “guilt and misery” as soon as she can). So attractive and serene does Jane Austen's life appear to Lord David that it often prompts him to triads of eulogistic adjectives, for example, home life at Steventon was “affectionate, cheerful, untroubled”; the mental climate in which Jane Austen grew up “enabled her genius to develop unhampered, undistracted, unforced.” And the work itself is basically “comic.” (“Some critics —literary critics are for the most part a solemn race — forget this.”) Summing up her work, Lord David simply states that it “can be described as a realistic picture of social and domestic life, seen from a woman's point of view and treated in a spirit of comedy.”\n\nThe point about all this that perhaps alienates some contemporary readers is that it makes everything a bit too bland. It would indeed be foolish to overlook the presence of these qualities of Jane Austen's work and life — but are her novels quite as uncomplicated as that? It would be a solemn creature indeed who overlooked the fine humor that pervades much (though not all) of Jane Austen's work, but are we wrong to find more serious themes and problems adumbrated and explored in her work than Lord David seems to detect?\n\nHowever, we should take this book for what it offers — and, given the quality and range of the illustrations, it offers a lot. A review cannot do justice to these illustrations, but there are portraits of members of the family, paintings and drawings of the houses and towns in which Jane Austen lived, pictures showing contemporary social life, dances, sports, fashions and so on — even maps of relevant parts of England. It is a loving assemblage and gives great delight as well as offering a lot of valuable visual information concerning the settings of Jane Austen's life and her work.\n\nReferring to a battle in the Peninsular Campaign, Jane Austen wrote in a letter: “How horrible it is to have so many people killed! — And what a blessing that one cares for none of them.” Lord David quotes this and comments: “There is a bracing Dr. Johnson‐like realism about this.” Julia Brown also quotes it in her book, and comments: “I can think of no better instance of the sheer despotism of Jane Austen's irony than this horrifying and true statement.” Lord David is a little old‐fashioned; Mrs. Brown is a decidedly “modern” reader of Jane Austen. There is now “despotism” in her irony, and what braces Lord David horrifies Mrs. Brown.\n\nIt is perhaps a tendency among modern critics of Jane Austen to overemphasize the darkness and to find horror (“The horror! The horror! “) in her work — as, arguably, Lord David made it too bland and uncomplicated. Jane Austen is not all fun and sunshine, but she is not Kafka either (and some critics write as if she were). She does not need to be “modernized” by attempts to find in her work a “heart of darkness” (in deepest Hampshire). It can be as damaging — and often more absurd — to “overread” a text than to underread it.\n\nBut let me turn to Mrs. Brown's particular thesis concerning Jane Austen's work. Her book is subtitled “Social Change and Literary Form,” and it seeks to demonstrate just how aware Jane Austen was of social change, and how it affected her work.\n\nMrs. Brown starts her book rather unfortunately by tilting at windmills, positing an obtuse plurality of readers who think that Jane Austen's work is not great because her subject matter is “too restricted,” that she was unaware of social change, that the so‐called problems in her work are too trivial to engage our attention. I don't believe in these readers and I thought such foolish charges were dropped long ago. However, that is perhaps neither here nor there. What Mrs. Brown wants to stress is that Jane Austen's novels “are the first to fully assert the cultural significance of marriage and family in social and moral change.”\n\nThe stress can lead to some misleading statements: for example, “Without faith in either Providence or individual will, Jane Austen chose concrete social relations as the place to make an argument.” This would seem to suggest that Jane Austen was an atheist and a determinist, when she was, of course, neither. There are also some infelicities of phrasing (does it really help to tell us that each of Jane Austen's novels “exhibits a kind of cultural and moral eugenics'?) and occasional platitudes (“All Jane Austen's novels involve three generations: past, present and future”) and a good deal of repetition (about the importance of marriage in Jane Austen‐well, yes, to be sure …).\n\nBut in due course, Mrs. Brown does clarify a more interesting and incisive thesis concerning Jane Austen's work. It is supererogatory to remind us that the choice of a spouse was “a complicated and crucial undertaking” and that, as well as being important for the individuals, it was important for society and its continuities and regroupings. There is so much work now on the history of the family and its changes that we do not need to be reminded of the importance of marriage, particularly for a woman, in Jane Austen's time. But the increase in the freedom of choice in marriage that was taking place in the latter part of the 18th century was an important phenomenon for Jane Austen's work.\n\nI don't think it is very helpful to be told that “the structure of Austen's novel records the shift from a tradition‐directed to an inner‐directed society.” But it is clear that between the time that Richardson's Clarissa only invoked her right to refuse an arranged marriage (as opposed to seeking her own, in spite of her family) and when Elizabeth Bennet and Emma Woodhouse make their own positive choices of mates, independently of their families, a notable change had taken place that was beginning to have far‐reaching (and unforeseen) consequences. This Julia Brown is aware of, and it enables her to look at Jane Austen's novels in a rather new way.\n\n“The increased freedom of choice in marriage led to an emotional awakening in women that was revolutionary.” Revolutionary — and problematic because the society might not be able to accommodate the newly awakened emotions, which might lead to more self‐repression in the interests of remaining within society. This, I take it, is Mrs. Brown's point in stressing the importance, not just of domesticity, but also of the sense of communality and cooperation in Jane Austen (apart from “Persuasion,” where we find a significant change).\n\nAs I read her, Mrs. Brown thinks that since Darwin we have tended to emphasize the aggressive, competitive and basically egotistical drives of the self, and to undervalue — or not to perceive — the “cooperative tendencies” in life. Thus, she views Jane Austen's novels as exploring “the territories of experience in which individuals come together and learn how to survive through cooperation.” However, the resultant society need not necessarily be good, and in adjusting to it, a person may find that much has to be given up, disavowed.\n\nMrs. Brown seems somewhat ambivalent on this matter. She sees, for instance, that “the moral action of these novels, 'sense and Sensibility,’ Mansfield Park’ and ‘Persuasion,’ move at great cost toward integration and cooperation” (my italics). At the same time, she would seem to agree with the beliefs she ascribes to Jane Austen: “Man is not a solitary animal, and as long as social life survives, self‐realization cannot be the supreme principle of ethics.” And she seems to approve of Marianne Dashwood when she effectively abandons passion, accepts Colonel Brandon and affirms, “'I shall live now solely for my family.’ “ Still, she calls Marianne's enlightenment “tragic,” adding that she does at least survive. It would seem that, as Mrs. Brown says, society in Jane Austen is, at worst, “a necessary evil” — a “shelter,” if at times also “a prison.”\n\nOne Important result of all this is the distinctive narrative voice of the Jane Austen narrator: it can hover above the action, participate in it and see all around it, and it is continually on the move, reassuring us, then surprising us, keeping us constantly alert. It is like the voice of society, at its very best — or perhaps just the best voice of society. What Jane Austen would not do, given her sense of community, is to focus on one “center of consciousness” in, say, the Jamesian manner.\n\nMrs. Brown's point here is entirely valid. However, in her own terms, the narrative voice has no necessary dominance over the action. Thus, of “Pride and Prejudice,” she writes: “The narrative voice … provides some limit, some barrier, which the action strives ceaselessly (and successfully) to overcome.” I cannot quite see this, as I cannot really detect “anarchy” and “nihilism” in the book. But then I don't really understand Mrs. Brown when she says that the novel “deals less with the problem of accepting an inelegant and unpoetic world than with accepting an irrational and absurd one.” The mid‐20th‐century terms become more than a little incongruous. She concludes her book with an intelligent discussion of “Jane Austen as a Woman Writer.” There are many points here that could be fruitfully developed, for what exactly does happen when the lady picks up the pen is a subject of enduring interest. And if I have balked at some of the vocabulary used by Mrs. Brown in her account of Jane Austen's novels, there is no fault to be found with one of her main contentions and conclusions:\n\n“Jane Austen's novels unabashedly assume human interdependence. The belief in independence that plays such a significant part in the masculine consciousness, and hence in our tragic literature, does not occupy a place in her novels. She omits it not simply because the women in her society were forced by laws and customs to be dependent but because she saw human interdependence as a universal condition.”\n\nIf her book doesn't “prove” anything, it is only because‐ as Anne Elliot remarked — that is something that books do not do. But it certainly opens up a lot of new and suggestive ways of appreciating just how much Jane Austen made out of the delights, complexities and ordeals of courtship and its changing codes and practices."
