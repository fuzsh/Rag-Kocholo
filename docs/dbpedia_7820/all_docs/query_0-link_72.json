        "text": "What do you associate with powerful women? How are these associations based on stereotypes that have been generated by the media. How do the media generate these stereotypes?\n\nThese are the kinds of questions we aim to answer in this lesson. We will be looking at a specific text type, namely magazine covers, and asking ourselves how the language of magazine covers helps construct the stereotypes that we hold of powerful women. This will allow us to understand how the mass media use language to influence our understanding of power and gender, which ties in to the third learning outcome for Part 2.\n\nWho's the most powerful woman?\n\nBelow you see six pictures of women on the covers of magazines. Rank them according to who appears most powerful. Try not to refer to your contextual understanding of the women. Only judge them by their appearances (as awful as that may sound). Compare your ranking to those of other people who have taken the poll.\n\nGender, power and magazine covers\n\nAsk yourself how the language of each magazine cover determines our understanding of gender and power through language. By language, consider the following devices that can be used to construct meaning on magazine covers. Analyze the use of these devices in constructing\n\nbody language\n\nlighting\n\nfont\n\ncaricature\n\nsetting\n\ninclusion of symbols\n\nfacial expressions\n\ncolor\n\ndress / clothing\n\nlayout\n\ncopy (language of the text)\n\nThe stereotype\n\nJudging by the language of magazine covers, there seem to be many unfavorable characteristics that we associate with powerful women. 'Icy', 'cold', 'distant', 'closed' are a few of the words that may have come up in your analysis of these images. Are these the definitive characteristics of powerful women? If so, how does that put women in a difficult position in life and on the work floor? Here are two questions that you can answer in light of the article below.\n\nHow true are the stereotypes that Brenna Coleman presents in her blog?\n\nAfter watching the trailers for Disclosure and The Proposal, do you think differently about your first answer?\n\nHow do the magazine covers add to the stereotype that Brenn Coleman presents?\n\nTowards assessment\n\nWritten task 1 - After studying several magazine covers from different magazines, you may want to turn your focus to one specific magazine. Find out how one magazine, such as Vogue or Fortune stereotypes women by looking at more of their covers. If you notice a trend, you can write a letter to the editor, commenting on their use of image, copy and headings to reinforce stereotypes."
