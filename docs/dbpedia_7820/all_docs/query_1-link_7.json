        "text": "I would first suggest having a look at a similar problem, of a non-speaker going somewhere, possibly northern Europe. You are not the only person who has this problem, so don't get discouraged!\n\nI am not a Chinese individual. So my answer can only come from my western perspective, so bear that in mind, when reading my answer.\n\nTo answer your questions specifically:\n\nYou should try to get feedback from the people you need to work with directly. This can include your supervisor, but in reality, it should be your coworkers. Language stuff is difficult, culture stuff is even more difficult. I have never experienced the prejudice of \"weakness\" in western cultures. It's generally not something you have to worry about. Unless you're among a group of people who really adhere to the 'alpha, beta' stuff, you don't have to worry about appearing weak in front of your coworkers. In fact, you should feel good you're actively integrating yourself, and your coworkers will appreciate it. Bringing this up with your supervisor may be a good way to ask how the company could help. Perhaps more advanced language courses can be offered by company? Or something.\n\nYou will always look better to everyone by working on your shortcomings, especially language specific ones. As I mentioned before in my other post, integration is key to being a foreign person in another country, and language is one of them. Locals generally don't care who you are, or where you come from, and locals who meet a foreigner who refuses to integrate will generally avoid them.\n\nIf you show up at work and say to your coworkers (maybe individually) that you'd really like to improve your English and you want to be able to talk to them but could they please talk slower, or something around those lines, unless they're already prejudiced against you I'm confident they'll gladly oblige. But keep in mind, really keep in mind, you're the one who is supposed to be integrating, not the locals. The onus is on you to improve.\n\nI will have to say you're quite wrong when it comes to TV. The best non-native speakers of my native language are the ones who play the most video games, and watch the most TV series.\n\nWhat I will point out, is what you should, or shouldn't be watching.\n\nDo not watch comedies (at first). They require a very specific historic and cultural background that is not easily transferable. Idioms and jokes are problematic among native speakers, for foreign nationals it's worse.\n\nIt doesn't sound pleasant, but watching day-time soap operas, or something similar, the 'not quite but almost bottom of the barrel' TV shows are by far the best. They talk slowly, they use normal vocabulary and understanding their story doesn't require specifically understanding the words, but also their actions. on top of this you will learn local English culture through TV, what's important to them, local pop culture, etc., etc. Much like a baby, watching and listening are key language and culture acquisition skills.\n\nThough your writing appears to be quite good, you could of course find other drama shows to watch. But you need normal things. Not comedies, at least not yet. If this isn't your style, you're mostly now stuck to listening to radio, going out and just talking to people (always good!) and reading and writing a lot.\n\nThe other thing you need to do is if you can, completely drop everything that isn't English. Complete immersion will help a lot.\n\nGood luck! You can do it.\n\nFirstly, you're doing great. You've only been in the UK for 2.5 years and your writing is indistinguishable from a native. You can understand most things that are said on TV. You're already at a very advanced level.\n\nDespite your concerns, you've got and are holding a job in a completely native speaking environment, so you must be doing OK, and probably a lot better than you think. If you were below the required level to do your job in English, you wouldn't be in the position to ask this question :-)\n\nI am afraid that this will make me seem weak in the eyes of my supervisor. I am also afraid that this may be taken as a sign of rejecting responsibility for my own shortcomings\n\nThis is absolutely, totally backwards. To the extent your supervisor thinks you need to improve your English, they'll be thrilled you have realised that and want to improve, and they'll respect you for taking the initiative and responsibility for doing so. I can't imagine how you've got the opposite impression, but please be assured you have it backwards!\n\nBut... you must go to them with concrete suggestions on how you're going to improve. If you show up describing the problem and looking for solutions, that's when you're not really taking responsibility, and that would be bad. Look to them for help, advice, and further suggestions, but start with your own.\n\nLuckily, you want to learn conversational English, and you're in an excellent environment to do that - living and working in the UK! You have a lot of opportunities available to throw yourself into situations where you'll be forced to converse exclusively in English for a set amount of time\n\nNight classes for any kind of hobby or interest\n\nProfessional meetup groups with a networking portion\n\nEnglish <=> your native language exchange groups, where you'll swap 50/50 between the two with native speakers on both sides. Best part about these is that everyone there 'gets' that you're not going to catch everything\n\nPlay a sport. Solo sports are especially great - you don't need to say anything to play and enjoy the game, then you can chat a bit with your opponent afterwards\n\nWhile my supervisor is very patient, I am also worried that he regrets hiring me.\n\nDon't worry too much about that.\n\nSupposedly, your supervisor hired you after an interview, so he knew your level of English at the moment of hire. And now that you're in an office full of Brits, he's probably assuming that you'll improve in six months to a year from now.\n\nAt least, that's what I would assume myself. Obviously, this can vary. But if I were you, I also wouldn't rely solely on the job to improve my English. It sounds to me like you're already stressing over language at your job way too much.\n\nSo during your free time, I would suggest the following:\n\nImmerse yourself in British culture\n\nSocialize with British natives.\n\nTake a cooking class.\n\nJoin a book club (just make sure their books are not too hard)\n\nForce yourself to learn about and follow British sports.\n\nIf you know someone who is passionate about a subculture or a social hobby that other Brits participate in and that you might be interested in. Ask that person to introduce you to it. People love to share what they love. And it's great to have a knowledgeable guide when you're first starting out a new hobby.\n\nDate British natives (assuming you're single, obviously)\n\nUse Tinder or Bumble or Craigslist\n\nTry speed dating\n\nJoin a meetup.\n\nDo some extroverted activities\n\nJoin a Toastmasters public speaking club.\n\nJoin an improv class.\n\nJoin a beer league of some kind (darts, snooker, bowling).\n\nParticipate in Quiz nights at the pub.\n\nAnd yes, many of those activities will feel uncomfortable initially. The secret is to keep on showing up even when you do feel uncomfortable. Eventually, that feeling dissipates and that new foreign environment will start feeling like a second home to you. I speak from personal experience. I'm not a native English speaker and I've also successfully introduced myself to a number of foreign environments/subcultures that I didn't originally feel comfortable in.\n\nMemorize some dialogues from some of your favorite British movies.\n\nMimic the tone and the voice of the actors if you can.\n\nBonus points if you learn to mimic their swearing.\n\nHire a pronunciation coach.\n\nListening and pronunciation are two sides of the same coin.\n\nIt might be worth checking for a TEFL qualification according to Chronocidal\n\nAlso, look on youtube for accent or pronunciation coaches.\n\nI'm from the US, but I spent many years in the Netherlands. I learned Dutch and spent time in a predominantly Dutch-speaking environment. I also once had a roommate from Hasselt that had a regional accent so strong I sometimes had a hard time understanding him even in one-on-one conversations. I can relate to a reasonable degree to your story.\n\nYou're facing two main problems in English proficiency:\n\nThe UK has many regional accents, which can be quite strong and difficult to understand for those from outside the region, even as native English speakers.\n\nFluency in another language (unlike what they show on TV or in movies) is not a binary thing. One-on-one conversations on professional topics are the easiest. Group conversations (socially or in meetings) are harder to follow and participate in. Social conversations are harder than professional ones because they are more informal and spontaneous.\n\nUnfortunately, language is also a difficult thing to learn and to improve. I'm sure everyone has encountered elderly people who immigrated somewhere as young men or women but still have a thick accent when they speak the local language.\n\nImproving takes a significant amount effort and practice. I would liken it in some ways to learning to play a musical instrument. If you are serious about wanting to improve, you should try to find the time to spend at least an hour a day working on it. This includes listening and speaking. You should try to seek out as many opportunities to practice with native speakers or, failing that, a diverse group of non-native speakers to avoid reinforcing mistakes common to speakers of a particular mother tongue. It's also hugely beneficial if you can find a sympathetic native speaker who is more patient with you and is willing to engage with you despite any difficulties you're having with the language.\n\nAs general tips for improving language proficiency, I recommend:\n\nWatch local television, especially things that are discussed socially.\n\nJoin a conversation group (i.e. a group of non-native speakers that get together to practice speaking).\n\nJoin some social activities with non-native speakers.\n\nFind some quiet time each day to practice speaking and listening. When speaking, if possible, record yourself and play it back to really hear your mistakes.\n\nPay attention to both what is being said and how it is being said. Understanding the how (the specific words or idioms used, the tone of voice, etc) is much more important to improving your own language ability than just the content of what is being said.\n\nOn the work front, there are no easy answers. Social acceptance and involvement will depend on those around you. Some are more patient and accepting than others. If you want to be more included, you'll probably have to push yourself out of your comfort zone and participate as best you can even if it's awkward for a time or you're always sitting there silently listening in group situations.\n\nOn the professional side, you'll probably be best served by focusing on general communication strategies. If you are being misunderstood or are misunderstanding your colleagues, one common tactic is to confirm things with those you're discussing them with. Common ways to do that are to repeat what the other person is saying in your own words (\"So if I understand correctly, you want me to realign the flux capacitor?\") or send a follow up confirmation e-mail (\"John, per your request, I'm going to realign the flux capacitor\"). If you don't understand something someone has said, you may find you get a more positive response if you explain what you did understand and then ask for clarification (\"I got the part about realigning something but I didn't follow the next part. Can you repeat that?\")\n\nIt's also important to give yourself time. You will not get significantly better in a matter of days or even weeks.\n\nA great way to improve your \"ear\" for English is to listen to podcasts -- often they are more colloquial and casual, like colleagues or customers are. TV is more scripted and the numbers/types of people cast are more limited, but any couple people with a microphone anywhere in the country can set up a podcast. You probably want one where the description mentions \"conversational\" elements, so not Our Fake History which is one guy speaking from a prepared script, but instead Boldly Going Nowhere (3 Maryland Geeky Guys talking about the week's recent news in fandom), or Acid Pop (4 people talking about a topic of the week, 1 serves as \"host\" and has done research (the role rotates between them), the rest are trying to guess answers and share experiences.)\n\nA trick to improve your ear is to use the \"playback speed\" option, and slow it down initially. (I use Podcast Addict, which allows you to have a default playback speed, and then set the speed for individual shows and episodes at different rates.) Then as you get more comfortable, you can increase the speed to real-life or even slightly-faster-than-real .\n\nYou have received already quite some answers about how to improve your English, but, as someone in your exact same position, I'm sure that your main immediate problem is not really \"how to get better\", but how to survive with your current level of English.\n\nWhen I moved to the UK I was mostly able to understand spoken English but I had some issues with people with strong accents, people talking about stuff I had never heard before, people using very unusual expressions, people talking too fast to allow me to contribute to the discussion and so on. Shyness and the feeling of being inadequate didn't help. How have I managed to survive until now?\n\nWell first of all I have improved my English but that's only one side of the story and I don't think it's interesting to focus on this.\n\nMore practical suggestions on how to survive in the office:\n\nHave one-to-one discussions as often as possible with your coworkers. Don't be obnoxious and don't force these things of course, but if you have a good occasion to have a chat with one of them and no-one else, take it! You'll get familiar with their accents, they'll get familiar with yours. They will also get to know you as a person which never hurts. If your company offers team-building events, those might help as well.\n\nMake clear that you have trouble with your English. In my experience, especially in the UK, people are sometimes worried that you might think that your English is amazing and telling you (or letting you understand) otherwise might seem rude. Without sounding desperate try to be clear that you already know that your English is \"bad\". My general strategy for this is to use a lot of self-irony like telling people about about all the embarrassing times I've been misunderstood and similar things.\n\nTry to balance the request for clarification and the obvious need of a natural conversation. If you are talking about Christmas sweets you don't need to understand every word. Focus on the general meaning of what people are saying. If you are receiving directions for your job ask to repeat as many time as necessary.\n\nIt's clear by what you wrote here that your written English is good. Leverage this! If there are online conversations (on Slack or other channels) try to join them, make jokes, try to understand the references your coworkers make and what not. Again, show the people there that you are not \"a mute weirdo\", but just someone struggling with your spoken English.\n\nDon't try to do too much. An error I see with other people in your (ours) situation, is trying to make up for the lack of language skills by try to over-explain themselves. So if they can't explain X in just a few words they mumble for 10 minutes trying to make their points. Sometimes, if it's not important, it's just better to say \"oh boy, I really can't explain this\" and leave it there.\n\nI'm not sure if I can think of any other suggestion, but more importantly, don't be discouraged!! Things will get better if you apply yourself.\n\nDisclaimer: My perspective is as someone who also learned a second language very different from my native one; I speak Japanese as a second language and learned it as an adult (in university), so I have some idea what you're going through.\n\nIn most cultures I've found, it is really only looked down upon when you interrupt others' conversations if you are a stranger to that conversation. Like, if you're on the bus and you're eavesdropping someone's conversation and then you're like \"hey I'm trying to listen can you slow down a bit?\" that's rude (obviously). Outside of that situation, it's not really rude or looked down upon to ask someone to speak slowly or use easier words so you can understand, if you're part of the conversation. When I was learning Japanese, when I was in Japan among Japanese friends, I did this fairly often; sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn't, but nobody got upset. Just be polite about it and it should be fine. Especially if you're a coworker, you're expected to be friendly with each other; I wouldn't bring it to my manager's attention if I'm unable to understand my coworker's conversations, but if my coworkers are belligerent about not wanting me to understand them, then I probably would.\n\nSo if you're having a conversation with some coworkers and having trouble understanding, just a simple, \"hey, would you mind speaking a bit more slowly so I can understand?\" would be great. Oftentimes, native speakers, after being asked to speak more slowly, will naturally speed up their speech over time and maybe you'll have to ask a few more times; this isn't being rude, it's being forgetful, so keep that in mind.\n\nAs for how to improve your own English to not need to do this sort of thing, that really just comes with time. You mentioned you've spent most of your time in the UK in or amongst Chinese environments. That certainly doesn't help you. The less time you spend in Chinese environments and the more time you spend in English environments, the better your English will be. Even if you are in a Chinese environment, if you are in a Chinese, English-speaking environment, like a language exchange maybe, that helps too.\n\nSpeaking from my experience with Japanese, I wouldn't recommend trying to learn English from TV shows, radio, etc. The reason being, at least in Japanese, you might pick up the wrong habits, use \"catch phrases\" from characters as if they were regular speech (which makes you sound weird), and so on. You can supplement your other English learning activities with also watching TV, but your main learning method should not be media, or if it is, you should be very careful about it."
