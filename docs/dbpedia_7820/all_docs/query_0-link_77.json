        "meta_description": "This paper aimed to explore the use of womenâ€™s language features by a woman character who masquerades as a man in Mulan (2020) movie. Two research questions were formulated. First, what womens language features are used by the character Mulan in Mulan (2020) movie? Second, does Mulan still use the womenâ€™s language features while she masquerades as a man? This study was qualitative research and used a document analysis to analyze the data. Two observation checklist tables and a frequency comparison table were used to help the researchers to categorize the data for interpretation. Â The results that showed the percentage of the womenâ€™s language features from Mulanâ€™s utterances when she played a role as a woman was 83.33% and then decreased to 58.82% when she played a role as a man. The results also showed that the gender roles in society take part in forming someoneâ€™s speech. The decreasing point proved that playing a role as a man helped Mulan to feel more confident to state her ideas in society.",
