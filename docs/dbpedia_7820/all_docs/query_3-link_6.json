        "text": "Think of a translator, and she’s most likely a woman. Translation, while it may not be a commonly cited example of a female-dominated professional sphere, is nonetheless just that. In Canada as in the rest of the world, there are more female translators than male; women make up 65% of all European translation graduates and 67% of all providers of translation and interpreting at the European institutions. What’s more, the industry also provides an example of gender pay parity, with men and women equally remunerated in the majority of cases. In this sense, translation can be considered that rarest of things: a woman’s world. But it certainly wasn’t ever thus.\n\nUntil relatively recently in human history, the vast majority of women simply weren’t able or permitted to write. Education and literacy were male domains, out of reach for girls and women, whose roles were seen to lie elsewhere. Even by the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, only a handful of women were able to break through, attain literacy, and publish their own work — albeit anonymously, or under the name of a male relative. It was through translation that women were granted this first access to the world of erudition and publication. Translating the work of (male) others, and strictly religious works only, gradually came to be considered an acceptable activity. In almost every case, these early women translators were offered education through a lucky combination of socioeconomic privilege and the influence of a scholarly and open-minded father.\n\nThe late 17th and early 18th centuries saw a spate of bold and brilliant women taking on scientific and classical texts hitherto produced and translated only by men. In France, Anne Dacier, who was known, rather fabulously, in her lifetime as Madame Dacier, was the first known recipient of the title traductrice (female translator) — that is, once she was able to emerge from anonymity and publication under her husband’s name. Not only did she produce translations of the Iliad (1699) and the Odyssey (1708) that were renowned across Europe, but she contributed forcefully to one of the prominent intellectual debates of the time, regarding the comparative worth of Classical and contemporary literature.\n\nAnother rule-shattering woman, and a fellow French native, was Émilie du Châtelet, whose name you may have come across as a companion of Voltaire. What an injustice: Du Châtelet had a gifted mathematical mind, far superior — by his own admission — to that of her famed lover and intellectual partner, who remains a household name over three hundred years later. In 1749 Du Châtelet completed her translation of Isaac Newton’s Principia, a feat requiring not only advanced linguistic skill, but the ability to understand and communicate laws of physics never before conceived of or described. She added her own scientific commentary to the translation, which is still used as the standard French version of the text today. That same year, at 42, Du Châtelet died following complications during childbirth. She never saw her greatest translation published. After her death, Voltaire said of Du Châtelet that ‘she was a great man whose only fault was in being a woman.’\n\nIn the centuries that followed, more and more women built on these foundations, making their mark as translators and, in doing so, continuing to carve out a space as active contributors to world culture and historical events. From Julia Evelina Smith, the first and only woman to translate the Bible, to Mary Louise Booth, whose translations of anti-slavery literature were praised by Abraham Lincoln, to the many women who stepped up to translate as part of crucial intelligence operations during the Second World War, these contributions not only established women as skilled practitioners, but gradually led to their dominance in the field today.\n\nThe history of women in translation is a story of women gradually but indisputably proving their worth, in black and white, there on the page. Translation offered women a foot in the door, a first precious chance to engage officially and publicly in intellectualism and written expression. It is a space they have made their own. While the global position of women continues to present profound and widespread challenges in the pursuit of equality, perhaps we can celebrate this story of progress and innovation, and the brave, brilliant woman wordsmiths who wrote it."
