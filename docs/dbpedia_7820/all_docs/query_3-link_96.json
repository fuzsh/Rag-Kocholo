        "text": "To conclude this week’s post: HIBIKI 12 REVIEW, I thought it best to end with one of my favorite scenes from the movie that inspired so many of us to seek out a bottle of Hibiki in the first place; Lost in Translation with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.\n\nAs an added bonus, I have also included the full English translation of the Director and Interpreter’s conversation below the clip (spoiler alert, it’s great!). May I suggest before pressing play, first throw an ice-cube in your favorite rocks glass and top it off with a nice blended whisky? … enjoy.\n\nAnd now, for the translation!\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nDIRECTOR (in Japanese to the interpreter): The translation is very important, O.K.? The translation.\n\nINTERPRETER: Yes, of course. I understand.\n\nDIRECTOR: Mr. Bob-san. You are sitting quietly in your study. And then there is a bottle of Suntory whiskey on top of the table. You understand, right? With wholehearted feeling, slowly, look at the camera, tenderly, and as if you are meeting old friends, say the words. As if you are Bogie in “Casablanca,” saying, “Cheers to you guys,” Suntory time!\n\nINTERPRETER: He wants you to turn, look in camera. O.K.?\n\nBOB: That’s all he said?\n\nINTERPRETER: Yes, turn to camera.\n\nBOB: Does he want me to, to turn from the right or turn from the left?\n\nINTERPRETER (in very formal Japanese to the director): He has prepared and is ready. And he wants to know, when the camera rolls, would you prefer that he turn to the left, or would you prefer that he turn to the right? And that is the kind of thing he would like to know, if you don’t mind.\n\nDIRECTOR (very brusquely, and in much more colloquial Japanese): Either way is fine. That kind of thing doesn’t matter. We don’t have time, Bob-san, O.K.? You need to hurry. Raise the tension. Look at the camera. Slowly, with passion. It’s passion that we want. Do you understand?\n\nINTERPRETER (In English, to Bob): Right side. And, uh, with intensity.\n\nBOB: Is that everything? It seemed like he said quite a bit more than that.\n\nDIRECTOR: What you are talking about is not just whiskey, you know. Do you understand? It’s like you are meeting old friends. Softly, tenderly. Gently. Let your feelings boil up. Tension is important! Don’t forget.\n\nINTERPRETER (in English, to Bob): Like an old friend, and into the camera.\n\nBOB: O.K.\n\nDIRECTOR: You understand? You love whiskey. It’s Suntory time! O.K.?\n\nBOB: O.K.\n\nDIRECTOR: O.K.? O.K., let’s roll. Start.\n\nBOB: For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.\n\nDIRECTOR: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut! (Then in a very male form of Japanese, like a father speaking to a wayward child) Don’t try to fool me. Don’t pretend you don’t understand. Do you even understand what we are trying to do? Suntory is very exclusive. The sound of the words is important. It’s an expensive drink. This is No. 1. Now do it again, and you have to feel that this is exclusive. O.K.? This is not an everyday whiskey you know\n\nINTERPRETER: Could you do it slower and —\n\nDIRECTOR: With more ecstatic emotion.\n\nINTERPRETER: More intensity.\n\nDIRECTOR (in English): Suntory time! Roll.\n\nBOB: For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.\n\nDIRECTOR: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut! God, I’m begging you.\n\n(Translation credit: What Else Was Lost in Translation By MOTOKO RICH)\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nAnd if you got through all that and want just a bit more, well, what could be better than a little “Lip My Stockings” ?? Amazing movie. Great whisky. Perfect for a rainy Thursday!\n\nPure genius."
