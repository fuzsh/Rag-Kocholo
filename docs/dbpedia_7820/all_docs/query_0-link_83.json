Please check back in the 2024 fall semester!\n\nLPP pairs one native English speaker with one non-native English speaker. The pairs get together once a week for a minimum of one hour and practice conversational English. The program is a great opportunity to learn about another culture and make a new friend. The focus of the program is to assist non-native English speakers with their conversational English, awareness of North American culture, and knowledge of living in Columbia, MO.\n\nThe pairings are on a first-come, first-serve basis and we will email you as soon as we have a partner for you. Please note this may take up to a few weeks based on our volunteer pool.\n\nOnce you are paired, our Program Coordinator will send an email to you and your partner with each otherâ€™s contact information.\n\nTo stay updated when applications open, follow our Instagram and Twitter accounts @mizzouwomenscenter.\n\nQuestions? Email muwomenscenter@missouri.edu."
