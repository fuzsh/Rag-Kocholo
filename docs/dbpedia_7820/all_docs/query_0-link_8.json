        "text": "Support women change-makers with TWB\n\nWe believe in celebrating women every day – because inclusion and rights are essential to creating a better, more equal, and sustainable world. This year, on International Women’s Day, we’re excited to spotlight and say thanks to the powerful women who make up two-thirds of our TWB Community! Together, this incredible global community of language volunteers translates millions of words to accelerate progress and inclusion. Committed to giving their time and sharing their skills, they’re helping marginalized people including other women and girls to get vital information and be heard.\n\nIn northeast Nigeria, where thousands of people are displaced by conflict, our research shows that access barriers exclude sections of the population from vital communications and even aid. Women, marginalized language speakers, and people living with disabilities face particular difficulties getting the information they need and being heard. Read on to learn how we work with local humanitarians to ensure they’re informed about affected people’s language use and can offer accessible channels to reach even the most marginalized groups.\n\nWe know from decades of experience that we can bridge the gaps between affected communities and responders by more routinely communicating and listening in a wider range of languages and formats. That’s where the TWB Community comes in. Our Nigerian-language-speaking community members translate critical information and resources. This blog looks at how we are helping to increase access and trust in the country’s camps for internally displaced people.\n\nJoin us as we share some remarkable stories of women in our TWB Community who advocate for women’s rights and language access. From amplifying voices to breaking down barriers, their experiences inspire us all to create inclusive and empowering spaces. It’s time to act: and it starts with listening. When we meet women’s and girls’ language and communication needs and create resources that work for everyone, we can make real, inclusive change.\n\nHow language unites women to tell their stories\n\nIn this heartfelt narrative, Peace Nkasiobi Agbo, an Igbo speaker and TWB Community member from Nigeria shares her journey of resilience and determination. In many parts of the globe, women and girls navigate constraints on their futures, their education, their rights as women, and their own sexual and reproductive health. Our community members translate critical information and resources, helping people get answers, know their rights, and be heard. From challenging stereotypes to advocating for linguistic diversity, Peace’s story resonates deeply with our mission.\n\nAbout Peace, Nkasiobi Agbo, Igbo speaker in Nigeria.\n\n“Peace, Nkasiobi Agbo is my name. I am from Eastern Nigeria, Enugu State specifically, a place known for its brown earth and hilly landscape. We speak the Igbo language, a variety slightly different from central Igbo. People are often surprised when I speak my language because they wonder how I can speak so fluently even though I was not born in my state of origin and never grew up there. I grew up in the Southern part of Nigeria and they are multilingual. I attribute my ability to speak, read, and write in my mother tongue to my gregarious nature, strong curiosity, and versatility. I am a fast learner, who pays attention to detail and is open to new experiences.”\n\nInvesting in education for all – women, girls, and marginalized language speakers\n\n“Girls typically receive little or no educational investment from their family as there is a cultural belief that they’re bound to leave home one day to their husband’s house where they will be useful. So why invest? However, my parents were of a different school of thought and would cut down on luxuries to ensure we had quality education. So fortunately, despite living in an environment that expects female children to be subservient, I went to good schools and competed with my male counterparts as a child.”\n\n“Growing up, it was clear to me that women were not supposed to aspire too high because it could potentially intimidate men. Too much education and too much societal affluence for a woman was ‘not good.’ Anyway, in 2014, I was accepted into a university to study English and Literary Studies. 90% of my coursemates were female – there were stereotypes about studying languages. Despite studying languages, most people thought it impolite to correct someone’s grammar. So, while speaking with anyone, I was conscious of not using a high-sounding vocabulary in case I appeared too proud or intimidating. Nevertheless, speaking my mother tongue alone hindered effective communication as my environment was multilingual. So, the English language inevitably became my main language of communication.”\n\nHope for women and girls’ rights\n\n“I have always wished I could access all information in my mother language but that is like asking everyone in the world to learn to speak my mother tongue. To date, language barriers have strengthened exclusion. People like me have lost opportunities – because I am from the Igbo-speaking tribe. A tribe that is stereotyped to be proud, domineering, and very zealous – sometimes in the wrong way. This false stereotype puts people on the defensive once you mention your tribe. However, my language connects me to my ancestral roots and tells a strong of great men and women who fought for my country’s independence.”\n\n“I have a one-year-old daughter who understands the Igbo language more than any other language and it’s often mesmerizing how people worry that she may never learn to speak English, even though her mother is an English language major. It is important to me that I build her confidence and teach her my mother language which is a major part of her identity. Also learning English is another way for her to develop her ability to master other languages. As a girl, you are not limited and you have a voice. Use it and stand/speak up.”\n\nUntold stories – women can break language barriers\n\n“I have had the privilege to teach English Language to a class of over 200 girls. I shared their struggles and ability to express themselves in the English language. A lot of these girls had untold stories and experiences waiting to be penned. The pain of being a girl and the fear of being married off once they are done with secondary school lingered in the minds of some of these girls. It is part of my desire that young girls can express themselves in their language, and tell their stories without fear or worry about how they tell it and in what language. We can break language barriers.”\n\nImproving access and trust in northeast Nigeria\n\nOur sociolinguistic research offers specific, localized insights into communication barriers\n\nand the intersectional, compounding role of language in marginalization.\n\nMarginalized groups including women in conflict-affected northeast Nigeria face specific challenges accessing information and being heard:\n\n54% of affected people and humanitarians consulted said that speakers of marginalized languages don’t get information directly.\n\nReligious and cultural barriers prevent many women from attending meetings, and from speaking freely when they do. Female focus group participants say they depend on their husbands, in-laws, and neighbors for information.\n\nPeople are not able to get the information they need if they cannot read, or cannot read well: literacy levels are low in northeast Nigeria, particularly among women. Participants expressed a preference for information with little text.\n\nSpeakers of marginalized languages often cannot get information in their language, as humanitarians typically communicate in the dominant language of the camp, typically Hausa or Kanuri. Speakers of Fulfulde/Fulani, Marghi, Glavda, Mandara, Gamargu, and Shuwa face particular problems and rely on relatives, friends, and neighbors to interpret for them.\n\nThere is no consistent provision for sign language users. Deaf people in the camps rely on family and friends to get information and to help them make complaints or give feedback.\n\n“I called the hotline and they spoke in English so I dropped the call.”\n\nYoung female FGD participant, Gwoza\n\nUnequal challenges for women are echoed around the world. CLEAR Global provides guidance and supports humanitarian organizations to address language issues and expand information access. Specifically in northeast Nigeria we recommend that responders:\n\nUse multiple channels to share information with the widest possible audience, including multilingual audio messaging, loudspeakers for community leaders to relay information, and print materials with field-tested graphics and limited text.\n\nExpand and strengthen listening – such as radio listening programs and effective two-way complaints and feedback systems to enable responders to listen to affected communities’ concerns.\n\nCommunicate in the languages of camp residents, including relevant sign languages, and provide interpreters with training; use plain language for everyone to understand.\n\nFrom simple translated documents to localized pictorials, videos, and chatbots – solutions must be in the right language, and they must work for women.\n\nSupport women’s rights with TWB and CLEAR Global\n\nLet’s unite to speak up for women’s rights, promote access for all, and embrace the richness of language diversity. By listening to and investing in women, we can inspire inclusion together.\n\nWith the TWB community of over 100,000 language volunteers, CLEAR Tech’s AI language solutions, and CLEAR Insights’ research and partnerships, we are set to improve global communication and information access.\n\nLearn more about what we do.\n\nBecome a nonprofit partner to get:\n\nLanguage services including written and audio translation, terminology support, pictorial messaging, plain language review, sign languages, and more\n\nIn-person and remote training to strengthen your translation and interpreting capacity and skills like plain language to improve communication in emergencies\n\nSpecific language guidance, data, analysis and tools for an evidence-driven understanding of what works for the most marginalized.\n\nOpportunities to collaborate on global multilingual resources like written, audio and video glossaries to support PSEA and COVID-19 response.\n\nOr join the TWB Community today\n\nProvide language support to local and global nonprofit organizations\n\nContribute to making information accessible, inclusive, and useful to people who need vital information in their language.
