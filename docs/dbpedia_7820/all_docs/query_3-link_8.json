        "text": "Self-partial answer:\n\nOriginal quote\n\nThe quotes above are modern, but the precursor is older than that. I found out that in French there is the term belle infidèle (unfaithful beauty) to refer to embellished translations. According to La traduction française classique : une galerie de portraits by C. Balliu (2004), the term has its origin in the 17th century by grammarian Gilles Ménage, who was criticizing the translations made by Nicolas Perrot d’Ablancourt :\n\nLors que la version de Lucien de M. d'Ablancourt parut, bien des gens se plaignirent de ce qu'elle n'étoit pas fidèle. Pour moi je l'appelai la belle infidèle, qui étoit le nom que j'avois donné étant jeune à une de mes maîtresses.\n\n(When Mr. d'Ablancourt's version of Lucien appeared, many people complained that it was not faithful. For my part I called her the belle infidèle which was the name I had given when young to one of my mistresses.)\n\n(recorded in 1694). Under the same context, some sources say that Ménage also quipped:\n\nElles me rappelent une femme que j’ai beacoup aimé à Tours, et qui était belle mais infidèle\n\n(they remind me of a woman I loved very much in Tours, who was beautiful but unfaithful)\n\n(thanks to comment of @Carlos Martin). Given how close the second quote of Ménage is to the modern quote, the origin is clear.\n\nHowever there is a catch! Balliu says that the second phrase about the woman of Tours is not found in any original source! For the second quote he cites a modern book from the 1960s. So the mystery is still on.\n\nHopefully, there is some tracking of the evolution of the term belle infidèle, for example in d'Ablancourt's Wikipedia article it says that the term was repopularized by Huygens. It turns out that it refers to poet Constantijn Huygens (the link in Wikipedia wrongly points to Constantijn's son, the scientist Christiaan Huygens). In a 1666 letter to poet Jacob Westerbaen, he writes in Latin:\n\nTranstuli autem haec Italica κατα πόδα, qui meus est mos, quantum eius fieri potest salvâ dictionis elegantiâ. Neque enim vitio mihi verti amem, quod Ablancurtio, celeberrimo inter Gallos Taciti et aliorum veterum traductori, lepide objectum fuit ab amico, in hunc sensum: versio, inquit, tua, domine, meae perquam similis est, pulcherrima nimirum, sed infida.*\n\n(I translated this from the Italian word for word κατα πόδα, as I usually do, as far as this can be done while retaining the elegance of the original expression. For I would not want to be brought down with the charge which a friend jokingly directed at d'Ablancourt, the celebrated French translator of Tacitus and other ancient writers, to this effect: your version, my lord, he said, is very much like the woman I love: very beautiful, for sure, but unfaithful.)\n\nSource. Huygens clearly knew of Ménage's anecdote and the last part of Huygens' letter might have been misquoted later as Ménage's own words. Nevertheless, this last quote closes the mystery for me. It is possible that by constant retelling of the Ménage affair, the term can take the shape of the modern quote.\n\nI leave the question open if somebody has any additional context on the evolution of the modern quote or anything that can bridge the gap between belles infidèles and the modern quote (and their supposed authors)."
