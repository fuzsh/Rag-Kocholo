        "text": "the sailor hat of black straw (eliza doolittle as a flower girl selling violets in covent garden, where our story begins)\n\nher flower basket\n\nviolets spewing out of the phonograph (she was selling violets, and as she tells henry higgins later in act V, “…the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves, but how she’s treated.”)\n\nthe birdcage (one of two possessions she sent for from her own flat once she moved in as the grand experiment of henry higgins to make good on his bet to “make a duchess of this draggletailed guttersnipe.”)\n\nthe phonograph (in henry higgins’ study, for listening to records of dialect, and for eliza to practice repeating sounds as she developed proper english speech patterns)\n\nthe tuning fork (again, another instrument found in the stage and set directions for higgins’ study)\n\nthe 3 ostrich feathers of orange, sky blue, & red (what eliza doolittle had on her hat when she came to ask for lessons from professor higgins; her best attire, which he promptly had burned.)\n\nthe bathtub (poor flower girl eliza thought she would drown if she ever washed more than her face.)\n\nthe tan men’s hat (for professor higgins, a “confirmed old bachelor”)\n\nthe red slippers (what eliza threw at professor higgins after he refused to give her credit for all her hard work passing as a lady out in society, but also the last line of the 1964 film where he says merely at eliza’s return “where the devil are my slippers?”)\n\nthe piece of sanskrit (to represent colonel pickering, returned from india to meet henry higgins, author of ‘higgins’ universal alphabet’; as higgins claimed he was going to india to meet pickering, the author of ‘spoken sanskrit.’)\n\nthe mustache (nepommuck, a former pupil of higgins’, who, at the ball, claimed eliza was a fraud, believing her to be of hungarian royal blood as her english was too good.)\n\nthe top hat (for alfred doolittle, eliza’s father, who sings both “with a little bit of luck,” and once higgins has turned him into an unfortunate member of the middle class for his philosophical ramblings on morality, in his tux sings “get me to the church on time” on his nite out before his wedding.)\n\nthe racehorse, dover, for eliza nearly giving herself away with everyone’s favorite movie line, “come on, dover!!! move your bloomin’ arse!!!” (the race wasn’t in the stage version, they merely had tea; i think the “ascot gavotte” number is just delightful, and i’m glad they added it to the film.)\n\non the front of the phonograph, i painted eliza’s opera fan she carried to the ball\n\nthe suitcase (another favorite number of an empowered woman, eliza sings “show me” to her pining suitor freddy eynsford-hill as she storms out of higgins’ flat after the ball. shaw was adamant that higgins and eliza do NOT end up together romantically, but that she does indeed marry freddy and open a flower shop and they are content to be poor and lead a simple life. hollywood changed the ending to an implied relationship between higgins & eliza, which i think could have worked on a friendship level, but he was too boorish to deserve her is what i say.)\n\nand last, but not least, i put a penguin in there. why? well, a favorite piece of trivia i discovered while researching these works was that rex harrison (who played henry higgins in both the stage & film versions) would cry out “where’s my penguin?!” during rehearsals when he wanted to compare his broadway lines and lyrics to shaw’s original text. as a true englishman, someone would have to bring him his penguin classic edition of the 1912 text to ensure lerner was remaining faithful to the artistic truth of shaw’s words. well, rex did this all the time, so the producers finally got him a taxidermied penguin! he got the joke, never asked for his book again, and kept the penguin in his dressing room for the run of the show. (three years on broadway before the cast took it to london!)"
