        "text": "Your term will be structured around taking a major course, which usually requires 8 tutorials per term (one per week) and a minor course, which will usually involve 4 tutorials per term (one on each alternative week). Therefore, an average 8-week term for a Visiting Student will involve 12 one-hour tutorials. You will usually be asked to write a short essay for each of these tutorials. Your work will be individually assessed and marked and feedback will be given on a week-by-week basis, generally via individual tutorials. Your final term grade will be awarded on the basis of both the quality of your written work and how well you have engaged in tutorial discussions with your tutor. Hence both written and verbal skills are developed and evaluated during the course.\n\nVisiting students in English can take courses in practically any area or period of English, American or post-colonial literature they wish to pursue, from Anglo-Saxon to Zadie Smith! Many students choose as one or more of their major tutorials the individual period papers in English literature which our own second year undergraduates take. These give a very comprehensive grasp of the history of English literature in the making and coincide with Faculty lectures which will enhance your learning. These periods are: English literature from 1550-1660 (the ‘Renaissance’ or ‘early-modern’ period); 1660-1760 (the ‘Restoration’); 1760-1832 (the ‘Romantics’); 1832-1900 (‘Victorian’); 1900-present day; or finally, Shakespeare. We can also arrange special tutorials on subjects of your choice. If LMH doesn’t have a specialist tutor in that topic, we can find one from another college. Please consult the English Faculty website for details of the courses when selecting the tutorials for your application form.\n\nAdditionally, we have compiled a list of the more bespoke English tutorials that we have offered to visiting students in recent years; you are welcome to list some of these on your application form."
