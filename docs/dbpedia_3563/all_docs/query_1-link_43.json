Tickets will be refunded at point of purchase.\n\nLiily\n\nLiily has spent the past few years garnering a dedicated cult following due to some of the most manic and exciting shows on the west coast. The band, consisting of Dylan Nash (vocals), Charlie Anastasis (Bass), Sam De La Torre (Guitar), and Maxx Morando (Drums), are responsible for some of the most rousing music coming from LA right now. The band hailing from the city’s vast DIY music scene is looking to sustain that sense of agency over all of which they create, their community and sound is grounded in the punk of the San Fernando valley as well as the post punk/alternative scene happening from LA to New York. This was the catalyst to record the entire new Self Titled EP in Maxx’s airstream trailer in the valley, alongside producers and friends Austin Corona, Wyatt Brenard, and Carlos De La Garza. Since the bands inception they have put out an EP I Can Fool Anybody In This Town and their full length LP Tv or Not Tv both under indie label Flush Records. These releases, though vastly different in sound, have helped shaped the path for their Self Titled EP to exist. It’s by far the most well rounded project they’ve ever made and want it to speak for itself.\n\nWebsite | Instagram | YouTube"
