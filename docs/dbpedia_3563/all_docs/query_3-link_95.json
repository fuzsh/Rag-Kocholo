        "text": "The Season of You and Me – Robin Constantine – Balzer+Bray – Published 10 May 2016\n\n♥♥♥\n\nMy thoughts\n\nIf the publishers had left the summary at that first paragraph I probably wouldn’t have picked up this book. A girl getting over a heartbreaking breakup…that alone is not enough to make me want to read a book. But a character coming to terms with a tough, life-changing situation such as, say, never walking again, is much more my thing.\n\nUnfortunately, the focus of the book was much more on Cassidy’s story of heartbreak and her inability to let go of her ex. I enjoyed Bryan’s chapters, liked him as a character and wished the book was more focused on his journey, but I just could not relate to Cassidy. Poor, whinny, heartbroken, devastated, I-just-can’t-say-no-to-him Cassidy. If you are looking for a strong, resilient heroine look elsewhere.\n\nI needed something to set Bryan and Cassidy’s story apart, something to make me want to listen to their tale, something to make me care about them. Unfortunately, I never found that something. Cass was predictably full of angsty, trivial teen girl drama, while Bryan is a much more interesting character, part horny teen boy, part serious guy dealing with hard changes, both to his physical body and his social life. Yet, he is quite accepting of his situation, and uses the summer to challenge himself to start reaching out to his friends again. Their romance is hindered only by Cass’s dilemmas.\n\nThis is a simple summer read, with plenty of complicated but light, roll-your-eyes drama. Friendship, family and romance, it had the makings of a great beach read but fell a little flat for me.\n\nThe publishers provided a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\nMore information\n\nCategory: Young adult fiction.\n\nGenre: Contemporary.\n\nThemes: Disability. Breakups. Romance. Dating and relationships. Family. Beach. Summer. Day camps.\n\nReading age guide: Ages 14 and up.\n\nAdvisory: Coarse language, f***, s***, dou***, bit**. Sexual references.\n\nPublished: 10 May 2016 by Balzer+Bray\n\nFormat: Hardcover, ebook. 352 pages.\n\nISBN: 9780062438836\n\nFind it on"
