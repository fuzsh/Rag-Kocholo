        "text": "Luke Combs leads the nominations for the 2024 Academy of Country Music Awards with eight nods, including entertainer of the year, male artist of the year, album of the year, song of the year, and single of the year.\n\nMegan Moroney and Morgan Wallen are next in line with six nods each. That makes Moroney the year’s most-nominated woman. She is vying for both female artist of the year and new female artist of the year.\n\nWallen ties Combs for receiving nods in the most categories, including album of the year for One Thing at a Time, which spent 19 weeks at No. 1 on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart, setting a new record for a country album. Wallen is also nominated for single of the year for “Last Night,” which is the longest-running No. 1 solo song in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 with 16 weeks on top. Wallen is also nominated for male artist of the year, which he won last year for the first time.\n\nCody Johnson, Chris Stapleton and Lainey Wilson received five nominations each, followed by Jelly Roll and Jordan Davis with four nods each and Kelsea Ballerini and Zach Bryan with three nods each.\n\nThe Academy of Country Music (ACM) and Dick Clark Productions (DCP) announced nominations for the 59th Academy of Country Music Awards on The Bobby Bones Show on Tuesday (April 9).\n\nFirst-time nominee Jelly Roll’s four nods include entertainer of the year. The last artist to be nominated for entertainer of the year as part of his first set of nominations was Billy Ray Cyrus in 1992, the same year he gained fame for his smash hit “Achy Breaky Heart.”\n\nCombs and Wilson are nominees for entertainer of the year. A win by either artist will clinch the ACM’s Triple Crown Award, which consists of an entertainer of the year win, plus wins in an act’s respective new artist and artist categories. Past ACM Triple Crown Award recipients include Chris Stapleton, Miranda Lambert, Jason Aldean, Carrie Underwood and Kenny Chesney.\n\nSeveral acts extended long streaks of nominations in their categories.\n\nLittle Big Town receives its 18th nomination for group of the year, which ties Alabama for the most nods in the category. Little Big Town has been nominated in the category every year since 2005, with the exception of 2011.\n\nBrothers Osborne is nominated for duo of the year for the 10th year in a row. The pair has won the award four times, including last year.\n\nStapleton received his ninth consecutive nomination for male artist of the year, an award he has won three times in the past. Stapleton is also nominated for entertainer of the year, which he won for the first time last year.\n\nOld Dominion is nominated for group of the year for the ninth consecutive year. The group has taken home the award every year for the last six years. Old Dominion is also the year’s only group or duo to receive multiple nominations. They are also nominated for music event of the year.\n\nKacey Musgraves receives her eighth nomination for female artist of the year. She won the award in 2018, the same year she won album of the year for Golden Hour.\n\nBallerini is nominated for female artist of the year for the seventh time. She’s also nominated for album of the year for the first time for Rolling Up the Welcome Mat (For Good).\n\nThis is the fifth year in a row that Combs has been nominated for both male artist of the year and entertainer of the year.\n\nThis is the first time since 2018 that the new duo/group category will be presented at the ACM Awards. The nominees are Neon Union, Restless Road and Tigirlily Gold.\n\nOther first-time artist nominees include Kassi Ashton, Tyler Childers, Ashley Cooke, Hannah Ellis, Flatland Cavalry, Jelly Roll, Kameron Marlowe, Kylie Morgan and Conner Smith.\n\nThe single of the year and visual media of the year categories will both have first-time winners in those categories this year, as there are no previous winners nominated in either category.\n\nThe eligibility period for the 59th Academy of Country Music Awards was Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, 2023, which explains the absence of such albums as Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter and Musgraves’ Deeper Well. They will be eligible next year.\n\nIn some cases, an artist may receive more than one nomination per category, if they are also credited as a producer, director or songwriter.\n\nAwards are voted on by members of the Academy of Country Music, which boasts a record-high membership this year of more than 5,000 members.\n\nThe 59th Academy of Country Music Awards is produced by Dick Clark Productions. Raj Kapoor is executive producer and showrunner, with Patrick Menton as co-executive producer. Damon Whiteside serves as executive producer for the Academy of Country Music, and Barry Adelman serves as executive producer for DCP. John Saade serves as consulting producer for Amazon MGM Studios.\n\nThe ACM Awards, which bills itself as “Country Music’s Party of the Year,” will stream live exclusively for a global audience on Prime Video on Thursday, May 16, at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT/5 p.m. PT from Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas. The full rebroadcast will be available directly following the stream on Prime Video and also the next day for free on Amazon Freevee and the Amazon Music app.\n\nA limited number of tickets to the 59th ACM Awards are available for purchase on SeatGeek.\n\nThe following is the full list of nominees for the Main Awards, Studio Recording Awards, and Industry Awards categories:\n\nMain Awards\n\nEntertainer of the year\n\nKane Brown\n\nLuke Combs\n\nJelly Roll\n\nCody Johnson\n\nChris Stapleton\n\nMorgan Wallen\n\nLainey Wilson\n\nFemale artist of the year\n\nKelsea Ballerini\n\nAshley McBryde\n\nMegan Moroney\n\nKacey Musgraves\n\nLainey Wilson\n\nMale artist of the year\n\nLuke Combs\n\nJelly Roll\n\nCody Johnson\n\nChris Stapleton\n\nMorgan Wallen\n\nDuo of the year\n\nBrooks & Dunn\n\nBrothers Osborne\n\nDan + Shay\n\nMaddie & Tae\n\nThe War And Treaty\n\nGroup of the year\n\nFlatland Cavalry\n\nLady A\n\nLittle Big Town\n\nOld Dominion\n\nZac Brown Band\n\nNew female artist of the year\n\nKassi Ashton\n\nAshley Cooke\n\nHannah Ellis\n\nKylie Morgan\n\nMegan Moroney\n\nNew male artist of the year\n\nERNEST\n\nKameron Marlowe\n\nDylan Scott\n\nConner Smith\n\nNate Smith\n\nNew duo or group of the year\n\nNeon Union\n\nRestless Road\n\nTigirlily Gold\n\nAlbum of the year\n\n[Awarded to Artist(s)/Producer(s)/Record Company–Label(s)]\n\nGettin’ Old – Luke Combs; Producer: Chip Matthews, Jonathan Singleton, Luke Combs; Record Company-Label: River House Artists / Columbia Nashville\n\nHigher – Chris Stapleton; Producer: Chris Stapleton, Dave Cobb, Morgane Stapleton; Record Company-Label: Mercury Nashville\n\nLeather – Cody Johnson; Producers: Trent Willmon; Record Company-Label: CoJo Music LLC / Warner Music Nashville LLC\n\nOne Thing at a Time – Morgan Wallen; Producers: Joey Moi, Cameron Montgomery, Charlie Handsome, Jacob Durrett; Record Company-Label: Big Loud Records / Republic Records / Mercury Records\n\nRolling Up the Welcome Mat (For Good) – Kelsea Ballerini; Producers: Kelsea Ballerini, Alysa Vanderheym; Record Company-Label: Black River Entertainment\n\nSingle of the year\n\n[Awarded to Artist(s)/Producer(s)/Record Company–Label(s)]\n\n“Burn It Down” – Parker McCollum; Producer: Jon Randall; Record Company-Label: MCA Nashville\n\n“Fast Car” – Luke Combs; Producers: Luke Combs, Chip Matthews, Jonathan Singleton; Record Company-Label: River House Artists / Columbia Nashville\n\n“Last Night” – Morgan Wallen; Producer: Joey Moi, Charlie Handsome; Record Company-Label: Big Loud Records / Republic Records / Mercury Records\n\n“Need a Favor” – Jelly Roll; Producer: Austin Nivarel; Record Company-Label: Stoney Creek Records / BMG Nashville\n\n“Next Thing You Know” – Jordan Davis; Producer: Paul DiGiovanni; Record Company-Label: MCA Nashville\n\nSong of the year\n\n[Awarded to Songwriter(s)/Publisher(s)/Artist(s)]\n\n“Fast Car” – Luke Combs; Songwriters: Tracy Chapman; Publishers: Purple Rabbit\n\n“Heart Like a Truck” – Lainey Wilson; Songwriters: Dallas Wilson, Lainey Wilson, Trannie Anderson; Publishers: Sony / ATV Countryside; Songs of Riser House; Songs of Wild Cat Well Music\n\n“Next Thing You Know” – Jordan Davis; Songwriters: Chase McGill, Greylan James, Jordan Davis, Josh Osborne; Publishers: Family Farm Songs; Hold On Can I Get A Number 1 Music; Songs of Universal Inc.\n\n“The Painter” – Cody Johnson; Songwriters: Benjy Davis, Kat Higgins, Ryan Larkins; Publishers: Big Music Machine; BMG Platinum Songs US; Nashblonde Music; Pompano Run Music; Songs for Ellie May; Sony / ATV Tree Publishing; Warner-Tamerlane Publishing Group; Well That Was Awkward Music\n\n“Tennessee Orange” – Megan Moroney; Songwriters: Ben Williams, David Fanning, Megan Moroney, Paul Jenkins; Publishers: 33 Creative; Bone Bone Creative; Sony / ATV Tree Publishing\n\nMusic event of the year\n\n[Awarded to Artist(s)/Producer(s)/Record Company–Label(s)]\n\n“Can’t Break Up Now” – Old Dominion, Megan Moroney; Producers: Brad Tursi, Geoff Sprung, Matthew Ramsey, Trevor Rosen, Whit Sellers, Ross Copperman, Kristian Bush; Record Company-Label: Three Up Three Down, LLC / Columbia Nashville\n\n“Different ‘Round Here” – Riley Green (Ft.
