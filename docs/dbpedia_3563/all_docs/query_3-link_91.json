        "text": "Former Rockingham (N.C.) Speedway winner Bryan Silas will enjoy twice the action this weekend at the historic 1.0-mile oval, as the Stuart, Florida native will compete in both the Frank Kimmel National Street Stock Series (FKNSS) and the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series (NCWTS) races respectively.\n\nThe 25-year old is no stranger to Rockingham’s tough demeanor, but the Floridian has proven over the years that his experience has paid dividends, including notching his first stock-car win in the CARS Pro Cup Series in November 2011.\n\nUndoubtedly, the extra track-time this weekend could play into the hands of the sophomore NCWTS driver who hopes to secure his first top-10 finish of the season in Sunday’s highly anticipated North Carolina Education 200 at The Rock presented by Cheerwine.\n\n“I’m looking forward to Rockingham this weekend,” said Silas. “Any time I get the opportunity to race at “The Rock” the excitement overwhelms me. You never forget the place you scored your first win. Over the years, the track has been very good to me and I’m hoping for more of the same success on Saturday and Sunday.”\n\nThe Fast Track High Performance Driving School 100 for the Frank Kimmel National Street Stock Series is scheduled for Saturday, April 13. The 100-lap event is scheduled to take action at approximately 4:45 p.m Eastern, immediately following final practice for the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.\n\nThe North Carolina Education Lottery 200 (200 laps / 200 miles) is the third of 22 events on the 2013 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series schedule. Qualifying is set for race day, Sunday April 14 scheduled to lift off at 11:00 a.m. The 36-truck starting field will take the green flag shortly after 2:00 p.m. with live coverage on SPEED, the Motor Racing Network (Radio) and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio (Satellite Radio, Channel 90). Pre-race coverage of the anticipated slugfest is tentatively scheduled to lift off at 1:30 p.m. also on SPEED.\n\nT3R2 PR"
