        "text": "Silas Young hopes to land more work with AEW/ROH.\n\nSilas Young was a featured member of the ROH roster during the previous regime. The two-time ROH World Television Champion made his AEW debut in June 2022, and he has since competed twice on AEW TV. He has also wrestled several tims on ROH since Tony Khan acquired the company and its weekly show returned in March 2023.\n\nSpeaking with Bryan Asbury on Developmentally Speaking, Young reflected on the end of his run in the previous era of ROH and noted that he hopes his work with AEW/ROH leads to a job.\n\n\"I’m still working pretty regularly, still doing shows basically almost every weekend. I’ve been lucky enough to do some stuff with AEW. Basically every time they bring me there, they put me in a good position, they give me a good match, so it’s been good. I hope honestly that, the next few months to a year that maybe it turns into a job,\" Young said.\n\nAs of this writing, it is not known when Silas Young will return to AEW or ROH.\n\nFightful has coverage of ROH TV as it airs every Thursday.\n\nCatch up on our coverage of the October 10 episode of AEW Dynamite here."
