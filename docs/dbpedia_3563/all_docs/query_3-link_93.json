Silas Jayne had fooled all of them by dying peacefully in his sleep. Given the life he had led and the things he was convicted of and suspected of doing, a far more violent ending seemed in the cards.\n\nChicago is a city that seems built on blood. The history of this metropolis is built on the blood of innocents. It started with a fort that turned into a massacre, and from there, the blood just seemed to keep flowing. The fort was Fort Dearborn, and it was, at one time, at the farthest edge of the frontier of the United States. It was also deep in what was then Native American territory. In fact, it was so deep that many tribes that might have fought against one another instead united in their hatred and disapproval of the fort. Ultimately, the tension grew until multiple tribes surrounded the fort.\n\nWhat happened then was a bloodbath. The tribes tricked the settlers into thinking they were going to be let go, and then they ambushed the soldiers and settlers. The descriptions of the brutality inflicted upon those soldiers and settlers has become legendary. The ground was, very literally, soaked in blood. It was, ultimately, a losing battle for the Native Americans. The fort eventually became a town. That town grew and became a city. Before long, it had become a boomtown and a huge city.\n\nHowever, the blood continued to flow. No sooner had the settlement become a city then there was the great fire, which tore through downtown Chicago and killed hundreds. However, the city rebuilt itself, and not too terribly long after the city was nearly destroyed, it hosted the World’s Fair. At the same time the city was showing itself off to the world, a man named H.H. Holmes was continuing that trail of blood. As the world marveled at a city that had rebuilt itself, he was building a hotel designed almost solely for murdering women. When his crimes were discovered, the city, and much of the world, was shocked at the cruelty and depravity he had displayed.\n\nStill, the city continued to grow. However, the city was also growing a reputation. It was a city known for being brutal. The South Side of the city was filled with slaughterhouses where the blood of animals ran freely and soaked the ground. Carl Sandburg’s novel about working in those houses, The Jungle, showed just how brutal life there was.\n\nOf course, if you ask most people who have never been to Chicago what they know about the city, they will tell you they know about the snow, some sports legends and a certain gangster with a scar on his face. The name Al Capone, as much as many modern city officials wish it were not so, is forever linked to the city of Chicago. During the time that Al Capone held the city of Chicago in his hands, he was notorious for his brutality. It was rumored that the mob on the East Coast wanted nothing to do with the Chicago outfit because they considered the Midwesterners barbarians. The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre was Capone’s masterstroke and was so brutal that it shocked the city and started to turn many who supported him against him.\n\nOnce the gangster era passed, Chicago grew again. It had become, first, a center for railways and then for air traffic. The downtown area expanded into the lake, and the buildings stretched farther and farther into the sky. However, there was still that feeling of Chicago being a tough town. There were those still creating those rivers of blood that seemed to create the very lifeforce for the city to survive.\n\nSome of the names of the city’s most notorious bloodletters have become famous. John Wayne Gacy murdered some thirty-five young men, that are known. Even worse, he tortured them before he killed them and then buried many of them in the crawlspace beneath his own home. Gacy held the dubious honor of being the country’s most prolific serial killer for some time.\n\nThe name Richard Speck is also well known. He came well before Gacy and shocked the city and the nation by murdering student nurses in their apartments during one night that turned into an orgy of murder. He carefully, methodically and brutally bound, raped and murdered eight student nurses. He even had the words Born to Raise Hell tattooed on his arm.\n\nThe names of Capone, Gacy and Speck have become legendary in the annals of crime. They have become famous boogeymen for parents and people to scare their children or those prone to being scared. Of the many crimes and criminals, they are probably the three most famous.\n\nHowever, the entire Chicago metropolitan area is a lot more than the city itself. Chicago and its suburbs stretch out for many miles in all directions. Within those areas there have been criminals, too. Perhaps because they were not in downtown Chicago, they have not become well known. Even among those who lived and did their dirty work in the ’burbs, there is a name that should rank among the most infamous and brutal killers the world has ever seen. That name is Silas Jayne.\n\nSilas Jayne was as cold and brutal as Capone on his worst day. He ordered the killing of people and their entire families with the ease of ordering a cheeseburger at a hamburger stand. He was not above brutalizing women, children and even his own family. These days, those who feel little or no remorse for the crimes they commit are known as sociopaths. Had Silas Jayne lived in different times, he would have been given that label and perhaps been treated for his illness. Since he did not, however, he committed his crimes almost without reprisal for a very long time.\n\nOne thing that Silas Jayne was very good at was keeping secrets. Yes, he was ultimately put in prison for at least one of his crimes, but the bulk of the horrific deeds he had been part of did not come out until well after his death. Law enforcement knew or suspected him in a variety of crimes. Those who did live and work in the western suburbs of Chicago or those who knew anything about horses knew the name of Silas Jayne. He had a knack for being charming. He was known as Si to his friends. He was known for being crude but charming and had a sense of humor that would make many of his friends laugh and say, Oh, that’s just Si.\n\nHowever, the day he was carried from the hospital, having died peacefully in his sleep, was the day that the dam of silence began to break. Soon, people who had been terrified of reprisals began to talk about Silas Jayne. It was then that the full scope of his crimes became evident.\n\nPerhaps because he did his dirty work in the suburbs, the name of Silas Jayne has not reached the fame and infamy of Capone, Gacy or Speck. However, his crimes were no less brutal and no less bloody. He deserves his spot on the criminal podium. He was a horseman, but he was also a brute. He was Silas Jayne, and he was Chicago’s suburban gangster.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nHe Had Cold Eyes\n\nIt would have been something you could point to and say that there was something wrong if Silas Jayne had been born with horns, scaly red skin and a forked tail. Had he been born with fangs and yellow cat’s eyes, someone might have been able to point to the child and see the potential for evil that was there. However, life never quite works the way it does in the movies. No, there was nothing remarkable about Silas Jayne’s birth. There was nothing to indicate what he would become or the harm he would cause.\n\nThe man who would become the terror of the horse world was born to Arthur and Katherine Jayne on July 3, 1907. The Jayne family reportedly could trace its lineage all the way back to colonial times. To add to the family’s strangely patriotic feel, Silas was nearly born on Independence Day. Silas was the first of four boys in a family that would ultimately have twelve children. If there was anything in his early days that might have given pause to anyone looking at his life at that time, it would have been his father. By all accounts, Arthur was far from the best role model for a group of young men.\n\nArthur Jayne was a man who, according to records from the time, had a variety of jobs, and not all of them were legal. Some of the jobs on his resume were fanner, stockyard worker and truck driver. One of his more lucrative careers was supplying sugar to bootleggers during Prohibition. He was reportedly a man of surly disposition, and he was not afraid to take out his frustrations on his family. Arthur was reportedly an alcoholic. Exactly what he may have done to his family is not entirely known. It is known that, eventually, Katherine decided she had had enough and separated from Arthur. It is also known that he did not do much to encourage his children, especially his oldest son Silas, to stay in school and do something with their lives.\n\nThe Jaynes lived on a farm, and the Jayne children worked that farm rather than focusing on school. Their farm was near a lake, and upon that lake were numerous geese and other waterfowl that were known to wander the family farm. Perhaps it was a crossing with these geese that let the world, or at least the Jayne family, see the darkness that was lurking beneath Silas’s face. Perhaps it gave them a peek into the rage and violence that bubbled just below the surface.\n\nThere are no documents to support what would become a Jayne family legend, but it is a story told so often that there must be some kernel of truth to it. The fact that the story has been handed down from one family member to the next means that the exact details of the story have been lost to history. Whether Silas was six or eight years old seems a moot point; regardless, he was very young and of an age when most boys would be afraid of being attacked by a goose or any animal. If a normal, well-adjusted boy was attacked by any animal, it would not have been surprising for that boy to cry and perhaps run away. Silas was not such a boy.\n\nThe story goes that Silas was walking near the lake on the family farm. The flock of geese was in the water, and some, like has been known to happen with geese, also walked around on"
