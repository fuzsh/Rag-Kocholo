        "text": "I recently attended the Salt Lake Institute of Genealogy Problem Solving Course. The abridge course description:\n\nChoose a project focus, ancestor, time period, geographical area, and research questions.\n\nUnder guidance from professional consultants, student’s will use a group collaborative approach to discuss research progress each day, utilizing the combined knowledge and experience of the group to solve problems.\n\nAlthough I am “more organized”, I did not solve the mystery. If you want to help, here’s the abridged version!\n\nRESEARCH QUESTION:\n\nWho are the parents of Lt. Brian/Briant Hall, my 5th-great grandfather?\n\nLt. Brian/Briant Hall, a soldier in the Revolution, was born about 9 Jul 1727, perhaps in Taunton (later Raynham), Bristol, Massachusetts. He married, 14 Nov 1751, Abiah Crossman, daughter of Samuel Crossman and Joanna Leonard and died about 13 Dec 1778 in Norton, Bristol, Massachusetts. He is buried with Abiah at Norton Common Cemetery who died 15 Feb 1814.\n\nKnown children: Isaac, Nancy/Anna, Prudence, John, Brian, Abiah & Silas\n\nBIRTH RECORDED:\n\nThe First Book of Raynham (Massachusetts) Records 1700–1835 (Online database: NewEnglandAncestors.org, New England Historic Genealogical Society, 2003), (Handwritten unpublished transcription, transcriber unknown, “First Book of Raynham Records,” donated to NEHGS in 1897) lists:\n\nBirth: 9 July 1727 – Brian son of John Hall 3d of Taunton & Mary his wife\n\nSee Ancestry.com: http://tinyurl.com/q9a3ddk\n\nThe eastern end of Taunton, was incorporated as Raynham when Brian was about four, on April 2, 1731. The entries around his birth record date circa 1752/3. The entry is surrounded by other Hall families. Brian was married in August 1751. Thus, Brian perhaps reported the birth himself, about the time of his marriage.\n\nAs one is unable to recollect their own birth and because the records appear to be in the same handwriting (perhaps copied from an earlier book), the source and reliability of this information is unknown.\n\nThe 1733 Raynham tax list shows only one John Hall.\n\nThe 1757 Raynham tax list shows a Brian Hall with a John Hall 3rd as the following entry.\n\nPUBLISHED WORKS:\n\nUnsourced publications assert that Brian Hall was the son of John Hall and Mary (unknown) and name him as a descendant of George Hall, an early settler of Taunton, Massachusetts through:\n\nGeorge’s son John m. Hannah Penniman,\n\nGeorge’s grandson John m. Elizabeth King and\n\nGeorge’s g-grandson John m. (1) Mary and (2) Hannah Williams\n\nThe earliest of these (likely the source of all others) appears to be “The Halls of New England. Genealogical and biographical”. By David B. Hall, published Albany, N.Y., Printed for the author by J. Munsell’s Sons, 1883. George’s ancestry is found on pages 567-648, with Brian named on pages 574, 580 & 581 (screen shot below) – http://hdl.handle.net/2027/yale.39002005232799\n\nIn his preface, the author writes, “…My first intention was to compile only my own line, the Halls of Medford, but afterwards I concluded to embrace in the work all the records that I could find. And I have found much more than I then supposed was in existence, and still the work is far from containing all that might be obtained….” Perhaps less effort was given to unrelated Hall families.\n\nI surmise that much of this genealogy was crafted through letters from Hall families residing in New England in 1883 vs. use of original sources.\n\nRichard Henry Hall, a great-grandson of Brian Hall, in December 1886 became the mayor of Taunton, Massachusetts. The election may have given him reason to name himself (and thus Brian) as a direct descendant of George Hall (See page 730 – Our Country and Its People: A Descriptive and Biographical Record of Bristol County, Massachusetts, Part 2) or perhaps he really believed that he decended from George as did all other Halls in the Taunton area.\n\nThe concept of “John 3rd” likely had different meaning in the 1700’s vs. current day, and should not be interpreted as the third generation of John in that particular family. It may mean there were at least three John Hall’s in the area from same or different families, and Brian’s father John was the youngest of the three.\n\n2. Excerpt from George Hall and his Descendants (1603-1669) compiled by Robert Leo Hall, published in 1998 [copy in my private collection]:\n\nJohn Hall born 1694, in Taunton, Bristol County, MA; died 1766 in Raynham, MA. First married Mary (Ukn) and had children Freelove and Brian. He second married Hannah Williams and had children John, Hannah, Elkanah, Elisha, Joseph and Noah.\n\nHis source: ALLRED RECORDS in the home of Marcella G. Allred, 349 W. 3rd St., Lovell, WY 82431. I have been unsuccessful in tracking her work.\n\nRobert Leo Hall is deceased and his descendants do not know what became of this cited source.\n\nIn 2009, a descendant of Marcella wrote to me: Aunt Marcella Allred passed away a number of years ago. I am not sure where any of her living children are, possibly in Utah. Aunt Marcella was famous in this area for the amount of genealogy work that she did. Her maiden name was Graham. I am assuming that she must have been related to your ancestors.\n\n3. In “Brian Pendleton and his Descendants, 1599-1910”, Everett Hall Pendleton, asserts that Brian’s mother was Mary Brettun/Britton, daughter of William Brettun and granddaughter of Mary (Pendleton) Brettun Cross Morey, who married (1) Joseph Hall and (2) John Hall, descendant of Brian Pendleton, born about 1599, one of the early settlers of Watertown and Sudbury, Massachusetts who owned land the Maine and New Hampshire. http://hdl.handle.net/2027/wu.89069624344\n\nMary Morey left a will recorded 10 Jan 1732/3. It is indexed under the name “Marcy Morey” in ”Abstracts of Bristol County, Massachusetts Probate Records, 1687-1745″ H. L. Peter Rounds. In it she names her father, grandfather, husbands and grandchildren.\n\nThe actual will (copy in my files) reads:\n\n….Item – I Give and Bequeath to my Grand Children William Brettun, Abiale Brettun, Ebenezer Brettun, Pendleton Brettun, Mary Hall, Lydia Brettun, Sarah Brettun, Elizabeth Brettun, & Abigail Brettun, all the remaining three quarters of my Real Estate lands Meadows & ____ which belong to me to be equally divided between them Only that my granddaughter Mary Hall is to enjoy her part during her life and after her deceased her children to enjoy her part equally between them and their heirs….\n\nTHEORIES\n\nIs Brian’s father John Hall, g-grandson of George who married 2nd Hannah Williams?\n\nBrian Hall, son of John (with Mary) and John Hall, son of John (with Hannah) were born within 7 months of one another, if the Rayhnam records of birth are accurate, and the pregnancies were full term – either John Hall got two women pregnant at the same time or there were two John Hall’s in Taunton/Raynham in 1727 (John Hall, son of John Hall and Hannah is born January 26, 1728. Date based on the birth record in the original Raynham Vital Records, he was conceived around May of 1727, Brian was born two months later).\n\nBrian Hall is not mentioned in John Hall of Raynham’s will of 1766. All 6 of his children by Hannah are mentioned (including those who got nothing):\n\nHe left of to John Hall eldest son of the deceased all the aforesaid of five lots of land one small right in the old iron works in Raynham and two seventh parts….\n\nIt is stated in the will “Nothing is left to Joseph Hall son of deceased because he already got a gift in his lifetime of 95 acres estimated at 3 quid and 50 pounds”. and “Nothing is left to Noah Hall son of the deceased because he already got a gift in his lifetime of four pieces of land which are estimated at three hundred pounds the land being about 84 acres”\n\nAll land deeds in Bristol County were examined (by me) for Brian Hall. There was no land exchanged between the two men during their lifetime.\n\nNone of Brian’s children followed the naming patterns of the John who married Hannah’s parents/grandparents.\n\nA number of errors have been discovered by other researchers in the “Halls of New England”, most of which were repeated in the book “George Hall and his Descendants (1603-1669)”. One example is “A Maze of Halls in Taunton, Massachusetts: Correlating Land Description to Prove Identity” written by Marsha Hoffman Rising, and originally published in National Genealogical Society Quarterly in 1993 which sorts the Samuel Halls of George of Taunton and Edward of Rehoboth.\n\nY-DNA evidence suggests there is no relationship between the two men. As of today, there are four testers through George Hall’s son Samuel. One from Samuel’s son Ebenezer and three from Samuel’s son Samuel. None of these match the DNA of three of Brian’s descendants, one through Brian’s son Brian and two through Brian’s son Silas. As of Jan 2016 one of George’s son Joseph’s likely descendants has tested and we are awaiting results. If he matches Samuel this will further support the theory that Brian does NOT decend from George. No living male Hall descendants have been located for George’s son John and thus that line remains untested. Y-DNA of Brian’s descendant do not match that of Edward Hall of Rehobeth either.\n\nResults here: https://www.familytreedna.com/public/hall/default.aspx?section=yresults Brian is family #47, George is family #24 and Edward family #6\n\nIs Brian’s mother Mary Brettun/Britton, descendant of Brian Pendleton?\n\nIn 1727, the name “Brian/Briant/Bryant” was quite uncommon. It is plausible that Brian was named after Brian Pendleton. Many years later, the 1790 census on Ancestry.com lists just thirteen Brian/Briant’s as head of households in the United States (even with indexing errors and the fact that other household members are not listed, this seems low and indicates the name uncommon). *Note that on a 1728 map of Taunton (available for purchase at Old Colony Historical Society), in the area which is now Raynham, there was a Briant/Bryant family residing next to the Crossman/Britton families could Brian instead be a family surname?\n\nMary Morey’s will is very detailed. Mary Hall is the only grandchild called out separately in the will: “Mary Hall is to enjoy her part during her lifetime but after her deceased her children to enjoy her part equally between them and their heirs” Although not direct evidence, this seems to imply that perhaps Mary already had children in 1732.\n\nThere is record in Bristol County of Pendleton Britton and Brian Hall owning land together implying the two were associates and perhaps cousins?\n\nBrian was recorded as a cordwainer (shoemaker) in land deeds and Iron Works records beginning when he was 23. Mary Britton’s brother, Ebenizier, also of Raynham, was a cordwainer. Perhaps Brian was raised by the Britton’s and apprenticed with his uncle as a young man.\n\nIn Raynham, 1731, a John Hall and William Britton are paid for supplying pine boards to the town. This suggests a relationship between the two – Brian’s supposed mother was Mary Britton, William Britton’s daughter. If John was a Miller with William Britton, maybe their kids married?\n\nPOTENTIAL THEORY\n\nThere is a John Hall who got land near Cobbler’s Corner (book 9, page 72 – an area which is now Mansfield) in 1715 it seems with Mill rights*. He might be the same John Hall listed as an early Norton church member (a member of the First Church of Norton and witnessed the ordination of its first Minister, Joseph Avery in 1714). Wife of John Hall, Bethiah joined in 1716.\n\nThen John Hall and wife Ruth record births of Bethiah 1 Dec 1721 and Benjamin 10 Aug 1720 in Norton (at that time Mansfield was part of Norton). So maybe Bethiah died, he married Ruth and named a child after his deceased wife? In 1723 (not filed until 1735) there is a deed where a John Hall is selling land near Cobbler’s Corner, with Ruth his wife (book 23 page 494)\n\nIn Raynham, 1731, a John Hall and William Britton are paid for supplying pine boards to the town. This suggests a relationship between the two – Brian’s supposed mother was Mary Britton, William Britton’s daughter. If John was a Miller with William Britton, maybe their kids married?\n\nThere is also a marriage recorded of John Hall to Sarah Wellman both of Norton 7 March 1726/7. Then in 1730, there is a deed for purchase of land in Raynham by Samual Wellman of “John Hall of Norton, Miller” he also mentions his Mill, with a Sarah Hall as wife (book 25, page 116). Other witnesses include Benjamin Wellman, Isaac & Isaac jr Wellman***.\n\nThere is a John Hall, husband of Sarah who died intestate in 1736 in Raynham. Others mentioned James Hall & John Hall yeomen.\n\nNone of these “Johns” appear to be listed in the “Halls of New England” book… Unfortunately none of the John Hall wives were named Mary.\n\nA Mary Hall who was born in 1699/1700 and is buried in Mansfield Cemetery called Happy Hollow Cemetery on York Street (Mansfield Vital Records). She is called a widow when she died February 20, 1760 and her gravestone gives her age as being in her 60th Year.\n\n**Halls of New England claims John Hall (a descendant of George) who married Esther Bell was the John who received the mill privilege in 1714 in Norton (which is modern day Mansfield) and that he lived at a place called Cobblers Corner…based on a review of land deeds this seems inaccurate.\n\n*** Isaac Wellman died intestate before 1743 his heirs are listed as the widow Mary, sons Isaac, Ebenezer and Timothy and daughter Hannah. A “deceased child” is also mentioned, it seems the other siblings are splitting her share – this might be Sarah.\n\nTIMELINE\n\nNote: Brian recorded 63 land transactions in Bristol County and several in North Providence, Rhode Island in his lifetime, all have been examined but not all have been added to this timeline yet.\n\n9 July 1727 born to John 3rd and Mary (thus conceived around October/November 1726 – Brian’s birth record was recorded about 1752) – record indicates a Raynham birth, however Raynham was not broken off from Taunton until 1731.\n\nSept & Oct 1747 – Hewing Timber and working with the carpenters at the forge (one of them being Thomas Crossman) – Account Book [Old Colony Historical Society], Iron Works records for the Taunton/Raynham area.\n\n1750 – Land purchased of Solomon Printice for 80 pounds by Pendelton Bretton of Easton and Briant Hall of Raynham; land in Easton containing 40 acres that was laid out 30 Sept 1713 to James Phillips of Taunton on the 50 acre division that lies near the land of John Selleson [?] also another tract of land that lies next to this land in whole 90 acres; land conveyed to Printice as warranted by heirs of James Phillips – witnesses Abigail & Katherine Leonard [Bristol Deeds 37:536]\n\n1750 – Living next to Elijah Leonard in Raynham, MA – Account Book [Old Colony Historical Society]\n\n1751 – Owns a Shop – Account Book [Old Colony Historical Society] Several entries 1750 – 2 in regards to services as a cordwainer.\n\n1751 – Account book kept by the Leonard Family of Norton; References a brother several times, Brian receives credit for the services of the brother, no name given. – Account Book [Old Colony Historical Society]\n\nAugust 1751 – married Abiah Crossman (Abiah Crossman; Female; Birth: 28 AUG 1726 Taunton , Bristol, Massachusetts; Death: 15 FEB 1814; Father: Thomas Crossman; Mother: Johanna; (Joannah Crossman has a sister Alice Leonard and parents are Thomas Leonard and Joanna all of Raynham – per probate records) Spouse: Brian Hall; Marriage: 1751; Sealing to Spouse: 01 OCT 1953; Film Number: 458137)\n\nOctober 1751 – Signs a petition against a new road in Raynham, MA – Raynham Town Records\n\n18 May 1752 – Brian Hall saw that the 2 calves skins and one dog skin which he brought from Swanzey today comes to 4-10-00 at tenor [Old Colony Historical Society, Iron Works Account Book]\n\nSeptember 26, 1752 – child of Brian Hall died in Raynham, MA – Vital Records\n\n1752- Brian Hall – Distribution of Iron Shares [Old Colony Historical Society]\n\nDecember 9, 1752 – Pendleton Britton and Brian Hall buy land in Easton, MA.\n\nApril 1753 – Brian Hall buys land in Raynham, MA from Alice Leonard, give several names including land bordered by Nehimiah and Nathanial Hall, filed 1758 [Bristol Deeds 43:115]\n\nAugust 16, 1753 – son Isaac Hall born in Boston according to historical accounts – birth not located in Vital Records. The History of Norton reads:\n\nIsaac Hall, Esq. (grad. H.U. 1775), was the son of Brian Hall ; and was born in Boston, Aug. 16, 1753. His father moved to Norton before Isaac entered college, and ever after resided there. Mr. Hall studied law, and died soon after entering upon his professional career. For more particulars of him, see Funeral Sermon by Rev. Sylvester Holmes. His tombstone, in the ” Norton common graveyard,” informs us that he was an attorney-at-law, and that he died Dec. 14, 1779, aged twenty six. In the Providence Gazette of January 29 1780, may be seen a notice of him which says: “His learning, abilities as a lawyer, and strict adherence to the principles of virtue, rendered him dear to his friends, an honor to his profession, and highly esteemed by all his acquaintance.”\n\nHistorical accounts read: A year or more after their marriage and the death of their first child, they moved to Boston (WHY??), living there a few years, during which time their eldest son Isaac was supposedly born (no birth record located).

Is there any evidence of this other than historical town/county histories and published genealogies?\n\nWho is Silence Hall? “1758 – Sale of Pew in Raynham Church, Brian Hall sells to Elijah Leonard his pew in Westward part of the church. Witnesses: Thomas Crossman and Silence Hall”. Could she be the wife of Jacob Woodward named as “brother in law” in Brian’s will and Brian’s biological sister?\n\nI leave to my brother in law Jacob Woodward and Silence [?] his wife to them their heirs an assigns forever real estate lying in North Providence in the state of Rhode Island excepting only ten acres to be measured of according to Quantity & Quatily [?] which I have herein given to my son Issac.\n\nBrian’s wife Abiah Crossman was a 2nd cousin of Jacob Woodward – Robert Crossman was their g-grandfather. Would this cause Brian to refer to Jacob as brother-in-law?\n\nMary Britton’s brother William Britton jr. married Sarah Woodward (daughter of Robert Woodward and Hannah Briggs) who was a first cousin to Jacob Woodward (son of Ezekial Woodward and Sarah____). Would this cause Brian to refer to Jacob as brother-in-law?\n\nWho is the Brian Hall Woodward b. 1778 (year of Brian Hall’s death); d. 1798 and buried North Providence at Hopkins burial ground (grave #35) next to Capt Richard Hutchins (grave #36)? All other surrounding stones blank. (Rhode Island Roots, Volumes 13-15 – Rhode Island Genealogical Society, 1987 – Registers of births, etc) – could this be a child of Silence and Jacob?\n\nNorth Providence land deeds for the Halls and Woodwards were examined the only connection seems to be:\n\nRuth Woodward in N. Providence deeds pg 199 (1748 or 1768?) mentions brothers Jacob & Paul Woodward and father Ezekiel (will A774, 1760 N Prov.). One of the witnesses signs as Mary Hall. Brian did not have any children named Mary.\n\nA Providence deed from 1821 [book 5 pg 86] mentions a Jacob Woodward, Mary Woodward and Henrietta Hutchins selling land. Brian Hall (Brian’s grandson through his son Brian) signs as a witness. He later marries Henrietta Hutchins daughter of Capt. Richard Hutchins (the man buried with Brian Hall Woodward) and Henrietta Woodward. Could Henrietta Woodward also be a daughter of Jacob and Silence?\n\nAccording to death indexes for Silence & Jacob – Silence was born abt 1740 – 13 years younger than Brian. So John 3rd would still be alive in 1740 if she is a sister! If correct, the age difference is further evidence that the John Hall who fathered Brian could not be the John Hall who married Hannah Williams!\n\nWOODWARD Jacob, in 85th year, at Providence, Aug. 5, 1822 (birth about 1737).\n\nWOODWARD Silence, wife of Jacob, at North Providence, in 76th year, Nov. 26, 1816 (birth abt 1740).\n\n*** Update 22 January 2022 – “The First Congregational Church History, Volume 1” has been digitized by the Raynham Public Library. A baptism for Silence Hall is on page 160 :“September 27, 1741 Silence Dean the daughter of Mr. Abiel Dean was baptized the same day Silence Hall the daughter of Mary Hall was baptized.” But…it raises more questions – Why isn’t her father listed? – was he dead, or was she illegitimate born to a widowed Mary, or was he simply not a church member, or did he run off…..\n\nWho is Brian’s “brother” listed in Leonard’s account books? Full brother? Half brother? Husband of Brian’s sister?\n\nWhen Brian died, why was Ephraim Burr of Norton selected as guardian to Brian’s minor children, Brian and Silas? How was he related or associated with Brian (or Abiah)? partial probate transcription here: will\n\nThe Legal Genealogist’s blog tells us that Burr was likely not a close relative of Brian’s:\n\n…..But when property was involved, the preference was overwhelmingly for the nearest male relative who couldn’t inherit from the child to serve as guardian. Even the example used by Blackstone points this out: “where the estate descended from his father, … his uncle by the mother’s side cannot possibly inherit this estate, and therefore shall be the guardian…… Read more here.\n\nThere is a Bristol land deed with witnesses signing as Pendleton Hall and Anna Hall who were they?\n\n11/27/1772 Brian (Hall) Alice Leonard Easton book 55 page 37\n\nPLAN:\n\nThe article “A Maze of Halls in Taunton, Massachusetts: Correlating Land Description to Prove Identity” written by Marsha Hoffman Rising, originally published in National Genealogical Society Quarterly in 1993, mentions the Greenlaw Collection at NEHGS.

He appears to be a Yale graduate and the son of Amos Hall and Betty Briant. It is unclear if he is the same man who participated in the war of 1812.\n\nMost of us newbies made the same mistakes, “back in the day”. We viewed Ancestry.com trees or Googled our ancestors and added everything found, as “fact”, to our tree.\n\nYears later we are still correcting errors added from those damn trees!\n\nBut what about published books? They are correct, right? NO!!!!!!!\n\nUnless the book lists sources, and you see the source with your own eyes, you should be leery of publications. Obviously some are better than others. I trust NGSQ articles, recently accepted DAR application (many of the older ones are unsourced) or publications by well known genealogists like Thomas W Jones, CG℠, CGL℠ or Elizabeth Shown Mills, CG℠, CGL℠. But if possible, I still seek out original sources for my files.\n\nOne that has been a problem for me for a long time? A book: “The Halls of New England. Genealogical and biographical”. By David B. Hall, published Albany, N.Y., Printed for the author by J. Munsell’s Sons, 1883.\n\nThis “Bible” which has been used by many New England, Hall researchers, for generations, is riddled with errors.\n\nGeorge Hall, was an early Taunton, Massachusetts settler, who’s ancestry is given on pages 567-648. As of this writing, 195 Ancestry.com tree users, copied the text exactly!\n\nHALLS NARRATIVE:\n\nThe writer lists a son of George Hall as:\n\n(Lt) John b. 1640 d. 1693 m. Hannah Penniman, their children:\n\nJohn b. 1672\n\nJoseph b. 1674\n\nJames b. 1675\n\nBenjamin b. 1677\n\nSarah b. 1678 (died young)\n\nJacob b. 1680\n\nHannah b. 1682, m. Samuel Haskins\n\nHe then goes on to claim that John and Hannah’s son John d. 1768 (age 96) m. Elizabeth King, their children:\n\nJohn d. 1766\n\nJudith m. John Tisdale\n\nPhillip and perhaps others\n\nA review of Bristol County, Massachusetts land deeds (available free at FamilySearch.org) offers alternate information.\n\nBook 57/Page 110 – This deed indicates that Lt. John’s son, John, was deceased by 1747 – so he couldn’t have died in 1768! It further indicates that Lt. John’s daughter Hannah was in 1747 married to John Andrews (which may or may not be her first husband, but this husband is not listed in Hall’s narrative – he lists Samuel Haskins).\n\nWe don’t know why all of the grandchildren of James are named and only one grandchild, John, is named of John. Were Phillip and Judith actually associated with this family?\n\n….Agreement made 22 May 1747 by Joseph & Jacob Hall of Raynham, yeoman; Benjamin Hall of Raynham cordwainer John Andrews of Norton yeoman and Hannah his wife children of Lt John Hall late of Taunton and John Hall of Raynham, yeoman, grandson of the deceased and James Hall, Nathan Hall, Marey Hall, Edmund Hall, David Hall all of Raynham husbandman and grandchildren of deceased and coheirs, children of James Hall deceased late of Raynham who was the son of Lt John Hall deceased have come to Agreement on division of land…\n\nThe following page continues item #5 states….John Hall in right of his father John Hall deceased….\n\nThe deed was not filed until thirty years later, in 1777; this might be the source of Hall’s confusion. It is typical for deeds to be recorded years later – your ancestors may have lived a distance from the courthouse, couldn’t afford the filing fees, just didn’t bother to file until they were ready to sell the land or their heirs were settling the estate.\n\nBook 24 page 72 and page 74 & book 27 page 557– give us further information. It appears that if John, Judith and Phillip are Lt John Hall’s grandchildren, then their father John died before 19 June 1729 – at least 40 years before Hall’s notation of 1768! These pages seem to indicate that John’s daughter did marry John Tisdale. But we discover a second unmentioned daughter, Mehitable, who married Nehemiah Dean. We also discover that Lt. John’s widow, Hannah, likely remarried a man named Haskins\n\ndated 19 June 1729…..John and Judith Tisdale of Taunton have received of our brother John Hall of Taunton the sum of 130 pounds which we receive as our full part and portion out of the estate of John Hall late of said Taunton (our honored father) who died intestate and also out of the real estate of Hannah Haskins late of said Taunton deceased (our honored grandmother)…..\n\ndated 26 July 1733…..Nehemiah and Mehitable Dean his wife, both of Norton have received of our brother John Hall of Raynham 130 pounds full part of honorable father John Hall of Taunton deceased and grandmother Hannah Haskins late of Taunton….\n\ndated 29 June 1739…Phillip Hall of Raynham, yeoman, for 200 pounds paid by John Hall my brother of the same town of Raynham aforesaid yeoman – rights in estate of Honored father John Hall late of Taunton and grandmother Hannah Haskins late of Taunton\n\n…. wait Haskins – grandmother Hannah Haskins? maybe Hannah (Penniman) Hall married Samuel Haskins?? vs. her daughter marrying him as Hall’s book surmises? Hannah born abt 1682 would have been “marrying age” (20) in 1702, but it seems more likely, based on the language in these deeds, that her mother Hannah (Penniman) Hall married Samuel!\n\nBook 16, page 310 – tells us that John was alive in 1700 when the deed was signed, but we don’t know if he was alive in 1725 when the deed was filed.\n\n….Hannah Hall widow of Lieutenant John Hall deceased and her sons Joseph, James, Benjamin & Jacob all of Taunton, for 5 pounds to the eldest son John of said John Hall deceased…twenty acres of land…Taunton, eastward from the meeting house….six acres….on the Neck Plain so called and ten acres of land bounded Eastward by 6 acres of plain and westward by the land of Phillip King and four acres of land joining to the northward side. Ten acres of land is bounded Eastward, Northward and Westward by the land of Thomas Dean which twenty acres of the land by agreement and settlement of the estate of the above Lieutenant John Hall deceased did belong to the above Hannah Hall during her natural life…. but now said Hannah Hall and her sons….grant to said John Hall….\n\nI did find the probate record of Hannah Haskins, 1726, in Taunton, which seems to mention the “Hall Division” and names Jacob, John and James. This seems to indicate that Hannah (Hall) Penniman did remarry and thus we are pretty sure John, father of John, Judith, Mehitable and Phillip is the son of Lt. John since grandmother Hannah Haskins is named in the deeds. It further seems plausible as John did have brothers Jacob and James….. Of course additional research is needed.\n\n[Note: Bristol book 17: page 167 dated November 1926 where Benjamin sells land of his deceased mother to his brother in law John Andrews is further evidence that that Hannah Haskins who’s estate was settled in 1726 was his mother and that Hannah married to John Andrews, his sister].\n\nFurther examination of probate records reveals a John Hall junior of Taunton with a sister Hannah and wife Elizabeth who died about 1708. This is likely Lt John Hall’s son. He passed a 60 years before the date attributed to his death in Hall’s book – perhaps a typo on Hall’s part, yet copied into at least 195 Ancestry.com trees and likely hundreds more on other sites and private genealogies!\n\nThere is quite a bit of research that can be done which could add further details and perhaps correct additional errors, including an analysis of the land descriptions.\n\nMy interest is to examine all the Hall deeds to identify the parents of my ancestor Brian Hall b. 1727 to John 3rd and Mary. Brian was a cordwainer (shoemaker) who may have apprenticed with a relative. I examined this set of deeds with interest, since Lt. John’s son Benjamin Hall is identified as a cordwainer, who would have been about 50 when Brian was born.\n\n———————————————————————\n\nHow to find Massachusetts Land Records in Bristol County\n\nClick here https://familysearch.org/search/collection/2106411, Select Bristol County, and open first the Grantor Index (seller), then the Grantee Index (buyer) for the time period you are seeking.

My 5th g-grandfather, Brian Hall, b. 1727, in an area now known as Raynham, Massachusetts, was thought to descend from one of these men.\n\nPaperwork is sparse, so my brother kindly agreed to join the Hall DNA study in an effort to identify our ancestors. He took a Y-DNA67 test (for males only, which follows the paternal line); we matched neither George or Edward. Five years passed. Bristol County historians, with whom I consulted, insisted there were no other Hall families in the area. They recommended that I seek other Hall descendants of Brian, outside of my direct line line, and convince them to test. They suspected that one of my grandmothers may have passed the “milkman’s child” off as a Hall. We are kit #115426 – http://www.familytreedna.com/public/hall/default.aspx?section=yresults\n\nAbout a year ago I tracked down two 5th cousins and blogged about it here –http://hallsofgeorge.wordpress.com/2013/01/26/my-5th-cousin-and-dna/ – The Update? We are Halls! We matched 35 of 37 markers. There was a 3rd Hall family in Bristol County! To date I have found no evidence of this family but interestingly we have a 3rd DNA match – Joseph Hall, who immigrated from England in 1745, married Ann Hitt Martin Strange and settled in Harrison and Lewis Counties, West Virginia – http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~hyde/hall/\n\nHopefully, future Hall testers will help connect our dots.\n\nFirst 30 Hall DNA markers (double click to view larger)\n\nWhen I discovered that my mother was Acadian, Lucie LeBlanc Consentino (http://www.acadian-home.org/) suggested an mtDNA test (which follows the maternal line), to help break through my brick wall and prove Stephen White’s (Genealogist at Moncton University’s Centre d’Études Acadiennes) theory of our heritage.. Stephen was correct! We matched Genevieve Lefranc one of the “Mothers of Acadia” http://www.acadian-home.org/mothers.html\n\nNext I tried the family finder test, hoping to break through a few brick walls; my mother, husband and a few cousins tested. My results are on 23andme, Ancestry.com, FamilytreeDNA and GEDMATCH. Hundreds of matches… Confusing matches. I need to learn more about DNA and how it works. So I start Googling. I come across a blog and began reading about DNA – http://blog.kittycooper.com/\n\nI notice that Kitty’s blog is running a contest – winner gets an entrance pass to RootsTech. A bell goes off in my head. Last summer, when I ran into Michael Hall (no known relation), Deputy Chief Genealogical Officer at FamilySearch, I asked him which conference he would choose if he could attend only one. He immediately responded RootsTech. So….I entered the contest. “Submit a question for author Stephen Wells”, a geneticist – http://tinyurl.com/kk8o63r – My question, “What is the future of DNA in genealogy? – say 25 years from now….” won the contest!\n\nSo…. while the Super Bowl winner heads to Disney World, thanks to Kitty Cooper & DNA “I’m Going to RootsTech!!!!” https://rootstech.org/ Flight and hotel booked, cat sitter in place and I am off to study the class schedule!"
