        "text": "The irreplaceable Larry McKenna moved offstage November 19, 2023.\n\nLet a long pause follow those words.\n\nI attended his concert performance: “Larry McKenna with Strings,” at the World Cafe Live in Philadelphia, on October 12, 2021. It was uplifting, swinging, and gracious. I had also brought my camera, feeling that it was crucial to document this evening. And I am once again moved by what was performed there. It was both casual and as serious as the need to breathe in and out.\n\nLarry and a similar ensemble went into the studios and made professional recordings of the music, and the results, issued as WORLD ON A STRING, are wonderful. HERE is the link to that album. And while I have you, HERE is the album’s Spotify link so that you can listen to it.\n\nKnowing that we would no longer be able to see Larry play, last year I started asking the two aesthetic directors of the performance (along with Larry), drummer Dan Monaghan and reedman-arranger-conductor Jack Saint Clair, and the esteemed double bassist Joe Plowman, if they would allow me to post parts of the World Cafe Live performance to honor him, to give us a chance to hear more of his surprising, tender, singular voice. And here are the results, to be treasured.\n\nThis is dear heartfelt music by Larry — saxophonist, composer, arranger — then 84 — and a wonderfully empathic group of jazz and classical players: Jack Saint Clair, tenor saxophone, arrangements, conducting; Joe Plowman, double bass; Silas Irvine, piano; Dan Monaghan, drums; Meghan Woodard, oboe, English horn; Alberta Douglas, violin; Nellie Smith, Chennie Chen, Justin Yoder, cello; Gloria Galante, harp.\n\nJack introduces the songs, and on BUT BEAUTIFUL we get to hear Larry’s voice and comedic timing. The crowd was properly enthusiastic: lovely music, performed with expert love.\n\nBUT BEAUTIFUL:\n\nSTOMPIN’ AT THE SAVOY:\n\nEMILY:\n\nWHAT IS THERE TO SAY?:\n\nSOMEWHERE IN THE NIGHT:\n\nLOVER:\n\nLarry was a quiet person, I think embarrassed by adulation, hiding an essential shyness behind humor. But he inspired reverence not only for his art but for his reluctance to stand in front of it and insist on our attention. One could do worse than try to live life as he did.\n\nWhen he left us, it was as if he had drawn a door in the wall with a pencil concealed on his person, opened it, walked through it, and was gone. I think of Little Nemo in Slumberland. We can no longer find the door. But these performances remind us of what he so generously gave.\n\nThanks to all the musicians, especially Dan, Jack, and Joe Plowman, and to Melissa Gilstrap: people who gave their love of Larry tangible shape.\n\nMay your happiness increase!\n\nLarry McKenna left the planet yesterday, November 19, 2023. He was 86 and had been in poor health. Those are the journalist’s facts. You can read all about his medical conditions on several Facebook posts. Those are the doctor’s facts.\n\nBut the human facts are larger and more beautiful. Larry was a lyrical tenor saxophonist, a composer whose lines had a wry humor, as he did himself. He was an entrancing storyteller with and without the horn. He was quiet rather than bombastic — I never heard him play a loud note — but he made magic.\n\nEvidence of various kinds.\n\nBLUE LESTER:\n\nTHESE FOOLISH THINGS:\n\nI’LL ALWAYS BE IN LOVE WITH YOU:\n\nSOMEWHERE IN THE NIGHT (posted here for RJS):\n\nIn person, Larry was the model of quiet graciousness. I never heard him raise his voice; I never saw him emote (although I do remember his dry witty delivery). But meeting him a number of times I adjusted myself to the McKenna scale: a soft-spoken Hello! to me with a small smile was the equivalent of a knighthood, a hug from across the room.\n\nHe was a great artist and a splendid human being, although if you had told him so he might have denied both assertions.\n\nRather than add more sad words to a sad occasion, I will ask Larry the wry storyteller to have the last words, in a video conceived of and created by his dear friend Melissa Gilstrap. I cannot post it here, but visit her YouTube channel and look for “After The Gig / Tales from Larry McKenna.”\n\nLook for “Miss Paige’s Wedding,” for one.\n\nLarry wouldn’t object to our laughing together. Watching him spin a tale is the only antidote I can think of to our awareness of our loss.\n\nVery quietly and unobtrusively, and without sentimentality or self-dramatization, he made all of us members of his lovely family. I am sure that this clan is heavy with sorrow today, but also with the marvel of having had Larry McKenna in our lives, on the path he took to cross our night skies.\n\nI will forego the usual closing.\n\nThis is the second half of a wonderful afternoon concert that took place at the 1867 Sanctuary in Ewing, New Jersey — Joe Plowman and his Philadelphians, featuring Joe on string bass; Danny Tobias on trumpet, flugelhorn, and Eb alto horn; Joe McDonough on trombone; Silas Irvine on piano; Dave Sanders on guitar.\n\nYou can enjoy the first half here — the songs performed are COTTON TAIL, WHO CARES?, JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS, SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET, and THE SONG IS ENDED.\n\nAnd below you can hear and see performances of MY FUNNY VALENTINE, WHY DO I LOVE YOU?, THE FRUIT, WHAT’LL I DO?, and I NEVER KNEW.\n\nWhen everything is once again calm, you might make a trip to the Sanctuary (101 Scotch Road in Ewing) for their multi-musical concert series: it is a lovely place. But the vibrations in that room were particularly lovely on February 8, 2020.\n\nSince it was less than a week before Valentine’s Day, Richard Rodgers’ MY FUNNY VALENTINE was not only appropriate but imperative: Danny offered it (with the seldom-played verse) on flugelhorn:\n\nJerome Kern’s WHY DO I LOVE YOU? — following the amorous thread — was another feature for the melodic Joe McDonough — with beautiful support from Messrs. Sanders and Irvine in addition to the leader:\n\nJoe (Plowman, that is) explored Bud Powell’s twisting THE FRUIT with Silas right alongside him at every turn:\n\nIrving Berlin’s mournful elegy, WHAT’LL I DO? reassembled the quintet:\n\nAnd a final jam on I NEVER KNEW — a song musicians have loved to play since the early Thirties — closed the program:\n\nBeautiful, inspiring music: thanks to this quintet and Bob and Helen Kull of the 1867 Sanctuary.\n\nMay your happiness increase!\n\nHere’s another in the series of intimate, swinging jazz concerts that take place at the 1867 Sanctuary on Scotch Road in Ewing, New Jersey: others have featured Phil Orr, Joe Holt, Danny Tobias, Warren Vache, Larry McKenna.\n\nThe most recent one was a showcase for string bass virtuoso Joe Plowman (friend of Larry McKenna and Marty Grosz, so that should tell you something about his authentic credentials — with Danny Tobias on various brass instruments, Joe McDonough, trombone; Silas Irvine, piano; Dave Sanders, guitar. As you’ll hear immediately, these five friends specialize in lyrical melodic swing — going back to Irving Berlin classics — without a hint of the museum or the archives. Their pleasure in making song was apparent all afternoon, and we shared it. And just as a comment on the leader: notice how quiet the crowd is when he solos, maybe because he creates long arching melodic lines with a beautiful sound and wonderful intonation.\n\nAt times, I was reminded of a group I saw for half an hour at the old Michael’s Pub — the front line was Bobby Hackett and Urbie Green, and what delightful sounds they made. (The digressive story of that evening I offer below as a postscript.*)\n\nHere are five highlights from the brilliant afternoon’s play.\n\nEveryone’s “got rhythm” so why not Ellington’s COTTON TAIL?:\n\nThe Gershwins’ WHO CARES? — with a touch of Tobias-humor to start:\n\nPorter’s JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS:\n\nON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET, featuring expressive Mr. McDonough:\n\nBerlin’s THE SONG IS ENDED, which announcement was premature, since there was another half-concert to follow:\n\nYou see why the trip to Ewing, New Jersey, to 100 Scotch Road, is essential to my well-being and that of the larger audience.\n\n*Now for my self-indulgent story, which took place before either Joe was born. I’ve never told it before and it is true.\n\nBobby Hackett was and is one of my greatest heroes, and when he appeared in New York City between 1971 and 1976, I tried to go see him. However, I was a shy college student, working a part-time job that paid $1.85 / hour, so some gigs were beyond me.\n\nMichael’s Pub was a restaurant-bar-with music on the East Side of Manhattan, in the Fifties, that offered excellent jazz in hostile surroundings. (To be fair, I did not appear as a well-heeled customer to even the most inexperienced waiter.) They had a bar where one could sit and have a single drink without being chased for perhaps thirty minutes, but the view of the music room was very limited. When I learned of a Hackett-Urbie Green quintet gig, I gathered up the shreds of my courage, put on my sportsjacket and my Rooster tie, and went.\n\nI think I made a reservation for two: that was my cunning at work. I was guided to a table, a menu was thrust in my face, and I said, “I’m waiting for my date. A vodka-tonic, please,” and the waiter went away, returning in seconds with my drink. The music began and it was of course celestial. I nursed my drink, ate the rolls in the bread basket one by one, and fended off the waiter, who was more insistent than any date I’d had up to that point. Finally, somewhere in the first set, when the waiter had become nearly rude, I looked at my watch, and said grimly so that he could hear, “Damn. She’s not coming. I’ll take the check, please,” paid and left.\n\nI can now say that I heard Bobby and Urbie, but the sad part is that I can’t remember a note because it was completely blotted out by the sense of being unwanted. But, in a pinch, vodka-tonic, buttered rolls, and a divine soundtrack are nutritious enough. And memory is soul food.\n\nMay your happiness increase!\n\nSome of the most memorable sessions — improvising without arrangements — are marked by a delightful ensemble tension coming out of competitiveness. Think of almost any date Roy Eldridge played on, for an example close to hand. Others are marked by an equally pleasing calm friendliness: we’re all here for the same purpose, and let’s have a good time. A collective hug rather than head-cutting.\n\nThe quietly impressive group that Danny Tobias — master of various brass instruments — brought to the 1867 Sanctuary in Ewing, New Jersey, on Saturday, April 6, really exemplified the affectionate community of the second example. Danny assembled very gifted young men from Philadelphia: reedman Jack Saint Clair, here solely on tenor; pianist Silas Irvine, and string bassist Sam Harris. Here’s their sweet version of CHEROKEE — not at a racetrack tempo, but as a waltz:\n\nAnd the Rodgers and Hart SPRING IS HERE, wistful, pensive, still swinging:\n\nDanny’s secret indulgence (one that makes me particularly glad) is the Eb alto horn — beloved of Dick Cary and very few others. This particular specimen, Danny notes, was a gift from his friend, the very fine trombonist Gil Toth, who was in the audience. (Also in the audience were dance luminaries Lynn Redmile and Renee Toplansky.)\n\nWhat better way to say “Thank you” to Gil and all of us than with this heartfelt rendition of SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME?\n\nEvery jazz concert needs a song with disputed authorship, so here’s DIG, a line on SWEET GEORGIA BROWN, that Miles Davis took credit for:\n\nEven if your idea of paradise is King Oliver 1923, I hope you can hear the sweet floating beauties on display here. And let’s not forget Jack Saint Clair’s melancholy-uplifting solo feature, posted earlier.\n\nIt was a wonderful afternoon at the 1867 Sanctuary — where art flourishes — and Danny, Jack, Silas, and Sam gave us great gifts.\n\nMay your happiness increase!\n\nI knew something of young Philadelphia reedman Jack Saint Clair before I heard him — on a Danny Tobias gig last Saturday — by implication, because Danny has excellent taste. And Jack has been part of the Marty Grosz Repertory Company that appears at the Mermaid Inn in Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania. Later, I saw Jack get the coveted Larry McKenna Seal of Approval . . . if there is a higher honor I don’t know it. But I was delighted and moved by his playing at that concert (with Silas Irvine, piano, and Sam Harris, string bass) so I think you should meet him too, doing what he does beautifully: making melody come alive, airborne, quietly compelling.\n\nThe song is SPRING CAN REALLY HANG YOU UP THE MOST, lyrics by Fran Landesman, music by Tommy Wolf — their 1955 variation on Eliot’s “April is the cruelest month.” Or close enough. Only 33 years separate Eliot and Landesman, proof of how quickly language moves and changes.\n\nBut there’s nothing cruel in Jack’s lovely consideration of this pastoral lament:\n\nAnyone who has sung or played an instrument will know just how difficult it is to make melody come that alive. For those of you, and you know who you are, who leap to Compare, whisper the comparisons to your coffee and don’t send them here . . . . Jack sounds exactly like himself, and we are glad of it.\n\nMay your happiness increase!"
