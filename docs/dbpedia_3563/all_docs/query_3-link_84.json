        "text": "My family has a running joke about the grandkids attending \"Poppy Camp\" when they visit Allison and me. I turn the conversation skills I teach into different \"camp” themes. We have had \"Tone of Voice\" camp, \"Space With Doubt\" camp, \"Multiple Truths\" camp, and so on. From what I can tell, the grandkids love it. And so do their parents. When one of our grandsons told his mother, my daughter, about Tone of Voice camp, she said, \"I know, I have been attending Poppy’s camps since I was your age.\" Now you see the joke. But kids totally get it. During a recent visit, we had pancakes for breakfast. Silas, who is seven, said, \"I don't put syrup on my pancakes. It's not healthy.\" I said, \"I like syrup because it is sweet.\" Word for word, here’s what he said: \"Yes. I like sweet things. It's multiple truths. Sweet things taste good AND they aren't always good for you.\" What’s amazing is that \"Multiple Truths” camp had happened only a few weeks earlier. That’s how quickly he got it. And he was exactly right. The skill of Holding Multiple Truths in Tension is being able to recognize that more than one thing can be true about an experience or situation at the same time. It's a really important life principle that can help all of us make sense of what we are experiencing by putting it into language. See ... if a seven-year-old can do it, we can too, right? #Grandparenting #FidelityAssociate"
