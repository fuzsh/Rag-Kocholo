        "text": "County Road\n\nCounty Road (Trespasser, 2023) refines Bryan Schutmaat's intimate views on the American West, a subject he has both embraced and challenged throughout his award-winning career. Bryan conceived County Road while driving from his Austin home to his family farm in Leon County during the pandemic outbreak. There’s obviously no people in the rural Texas landscapes he portrayed at that particular time. But human activity is ever present in the abandoned houses, deserted silos and battered porches he came across. Railroads or rusty cars appear like useless relics of a failed civilization. Without the creatures who built them, all objects and constructions are swallowed by nature. Which is not exuberant or welcoming here, but totally indifferent to humanity’s efforts. In majestic black and white, County Road captures the still triumph of the wilderness during one of the worst periods of the Anthropocene.\n\nThe West\n\nBryan Schutmaat is no stranger to the Western margins. He admires the hard truths of fellow Texan loners like Townes Van Zandt. He often leaves Austin to portray lumber towns, workers or Catholic schoolgirls. Drifters, hitchhikers or cowboys. Seemingly tough guys and the needy. Silent faces melting with the environment that shapes their existence. Bryan’s images can be formally great, but what makes them memorable is the untold story that they convey. Either at personal or collective level, his work is a subtle reflection on the decay of American society and life in its boundaries. His pictures deconstruct the mainstream myths of the West by following the path that Dorothea Lange, the New Topographics movement and others started ages ago.\n\nQuick Q&A: Bryan Schutmaat\n\nA place you would always go back with your camera:\n\nLeon County and the quiet, central Texas countryside. Also, the \"Four Corners\" (of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah) where the landscapes are dramatic.\n\nA lesson learnt from the people you portrayed:\n\nHonesty and kindness go a long way.\n\nOne subject you’re very interested in right now:\n\nWestern American history.\n\nTwo items you travel with (apart from your camera) while on the road:\n\nI have bird feathers on my dashboard. I tend to have other people's books in my truck - books by Robert Adams, Philip Levine, Denise Levertov and more.\n\nThree names in American culture that you feel close to:\n\nWilla Cather, Peter Bogdanovich, Blaze Foley.\n\nA way that nature has shaped you and the subjects of your photography:\n\nLight is good."
