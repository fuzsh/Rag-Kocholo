Let’s make sure! Below you’ll find all the information you need for purchasing, renting, packing, and shipping. We highly recommend using packing labels to ensure your items don’t get lost during move-in. Print them on Avery (r) Template 5164/8164 or use printer paper and tape.\n\nWhat to Bring\n\nConsider bringing the following items. These are approved for use in University Housing and are not provided. Be sure to check with your roommate(s) so duplicate items are not brought.\n\nTrash can\n\nBroom & dustpan or small vacuum\n\nLaundry basket, detergent & fabric softener (for HE machines)\n\nTowels (bath, hand, washcloth)\n\nToiletries\n\nFlip-flops for showering\n\nBedding to fit an extra-long twin mattress: mattress cover/topper, sheets, pillows, blankets\n\nImportant note: Residents in Douthit Hills West (Buildings A, B, C and D) will need bedding to fit a full-size mattress instead.\n\nClothes hangers\n\nStorage bins\n\nFolding chairs, inflatable seating, etc.\n\nPush pins or white sticky tack\n\nRe-usable water bottle\n\nA few dishes (bowl, plate, flatware)\n\nCan opener\n\nLaptop (CCIT’s List)\n\nFlashlight and batteries\n\nFirst aid kit/medicine\n\nUmbrella, raincoat & boots\n\nTelevision, mini-projector, or tablet\n\nPower strip (no extension cords)\n\nClothes for the Fall semester\n\nAdditional Items for Suites\n\nBathroom cleaning supplies\n\nToilet paper\n\nShower curtain\n\nAdditional Items for Apartments\n\nBathroom cleaning supplies\n\nShower curtain\n\nToilet paper\n\nCooking utensils\n\nCookware\n\nDishes\n\nMost normal kitchen appliances, including microwave ovens, may be used in apartment\n\nkitchens. These include: George Foreman Grills®, Panini presses, coffee makers and Keurig machines, blenders,\n\nslow cookers and toasters (not toaster ovens)\n\nWhat to Leave Behind\n\nWe ask that residents do not bring the following items. This is done to keep our residents safe and our residence halls in good condition. These items are prohibited in all University Housing.\n\nAir conditioners and space heaters\n\nParachute canopies on the ceiling\n\nCooking appliances for the residence hall (i.e. rice cooker, toaster oven, hot plate)\n\nFog, Smoke, and Haze Machines\n\nWeapons, explosives and fireworks\n\nCandles and wax warmers\n\nIncense\n\nHalogen lamps\n\nHoverboard\n\nExtension cords\n\nPets other than fish\n\nScrews, nails\n\nRefrigerators over 3.6 cubic feet\n\nMicrowaves\n\nGrills\n\nChange for the washer/dryer – we offer limitless laundry in all our residential communities! (Not prohibited – just not needed.)\n\nPrinter – Clemson offers no-cost printing quotas to all students each semester (Not prohibited – just not needed.)\n\n*Common bathroom areas will be cleaned by custodial staff – all residents who have a sink, bathroom or kitchenette in their space will be responsible for their own cleaning.\n\nRoom decorations such as posters, curtains, bulletin boards, etc. may be used along with push pins and white sticky tack. However, no drilling or nailing is allowed. Curtains (tension rod recommended) must be fire resistant.\n\nPacking Tips & Ideas\n\nLess is More\n\nContact your roommate(s) prior to move-in to avoid duplication of items\n\nRemember, move-in and move-out are busy times, and the smaller your load the easier it is to handle\n\nSpace is always limited, so don’t bring anything you aren’t sure you’ll need\n\nPack your stuff carefully to bring the fewest boxes possible\n\nBe versatile\n\nCrates can be great for move-in and as shelves for your room\n\nInstead of bringing a futon, bring inflatable or folding furniture\n\nFolding ottomans can be great storage and seating\n\nFolding chairs are easy to transport and store, but provide extra seating when needed\n\nLimit Your Wardrobe\n\nThink about the occasions you’ll need clothes for and pack accordingly. Remember, you don’t need everything.\n\nLimit your clothes to just what will fit in your clothes basket. Closet and dresser space is limited, so be selective!\n\nBring clothes that work for multiple occasions and can be versatile.\n\nDitch the bulk and go small\n\nInstead of a TV, plan to watch on your laptop or phone, or bring a small projector\n\nInstead of bringing a minifridge, consider renting a Microfridge\n\nInstead of large furniture, find more portable seating options\n\nInstead of big decorations, go for small personalization\n\nWall Hooks\n\nWhile we know that Command Strips are a staple for college housing, we have started to see damage in some of our residence halls after constant long-term use of the strips on drywall. To make sure our living spaces continue to be well-maintained and attractive for all current and future residents, we do ask that you consider using alternatives if possible. We love when our residents personalize their spaces and show off their personalities, so check out this list of decorating options that have worked well for other students.\n\nHigh and Mighty Hooks* (for drywall only)\n\nWhite sticky tack for posters and pictures\n\nTension rods for curtains and storage needs\n\nOver the door hooks for doors, beds, etc.\n\nMagnetic hooks for metal surfaces, including lofted bed\n\nFreestanding shelving (wire shelving can be versatile, portable, and may have hooks)\n\nFreestanding towel or drying rack\n\nSuction cup hooks for smooth surfaces\n\nClamp hooks and shelves\n\nPush pins for lightweight items\n\nMonkey hooks* for heavier items\n\nHelpyhooks*\n\nPush pin hooks\n\nWe encourage you to get creative with your room and figure out ways to make it your own. There are plenty of options and you can always look online for more ideas!\n\nNote: Some communities have cinder block walls and will not be able to use many of our alternatives. For these communities, damage will be minimal and Command Strips may be your best option. These communities include the Shoeboxes (Benet, Cope, Geer, Sanders, Young), Bryan Mall (Barnett, Byrnes, Lever, Manning, Mauldin, Smith) and Thornhill Village.\n\n*Clemson Home is not endorsing any specific products. Brand names are used only as common identifiers for general product types such as adhesive strips, drywall hooks, etc.\n\nMicrofridge\n\nThe MicroFridge is the ONLY MICROWAVE ALLOWED in residence hall rooms.\n\nOrder now at collegefridge.com/clemson\n\nTo guarantee pre-delivery of your unit to your room before you arrive for the Fall semester, please order before July 28. A late fee of $25 will be added to your order if placed after the advertised deadline date. MicroFridge rentals are not available for the Summer semester.\n\n*Please note you may bring your own refrigerator as long as it is 3.6 cubic feet or smaller, but cooking appliances other than a Microfridge are not allowed in the residence hall rooms. Hall kitchens are available in each community. Most normal kitchen appliances, including microwave ovens, may be used in apartment kitchens.\n\nMicroFridge Features\n\nOver 1,600 MicroFridge’s were ordered by Clemson students last year with CCI!\n\nAll MicroFridge’s have a smoke sensor embedded in the microwave. This safety feature will automatically shut off the microwave at any detection of smoke.

Please view the information below based on your planned check-in.\n\nFall Regular Check-in & Summer Start\n\nAll residents arriving during the designated Fall check-in dates will need to check in at the P-5 Parking Lot (at the intersection of Hwy 76 & Perimeter – Silas N. Pearman Blvd.) at your scheduled time to receive your key and unloading pass before proceeding to your building. You will receive a text message when it is time to check-in and will need to follow the check-in packet driving directions and instructions.\n\nAll residents are limited to two vehicles during move-in, and we encourage you to pack light and avoid the use of moving trucks, trailers, and other oversized vehicles.\n\nBefore Check-In\n\nMake sure you know your check-in time and room assignment.\n\nPrint the Move-In Packet! This will be available in the Clemson Home Portal in August and will include a check-in pass that must be placed in your windshield.\n\nCheck-In Lot Guide\n\nFollow the directions & signage to the P-5 parking lot.\n\nStay in your vehicle & follow the signs to a check-in tent where your pass will be scanned, and you will be checked in.\n\nContinue to the key-pickup area. The line will split by first letter of the student’s last name.\n\nStudents will receive their key and you will proceed to your building.\n\nLate Arrivals, Summer School, Spring Semester Move-In\n\nAll Summer School, Spring Semester, and Late Arrival Residents will check in at their Area Desk.\n\nUnload\n\nYou will have 30 minutes to unload your vehicle in designated locations close to your building but will need to move as soon as you are done. Each vehicle must leave the check-in pass from the Move-In Packet in their dashboard throughout the day in order to be allowed into unloading zones and to park in Family Parking.\n\nMove your vehicle\n\nParking for guest vehicles during Fall Move-in will be available in Parking Lots C1 & C2 with shuttles to bring you back to the residential communities. Student vehicles that will be staying on campus will need a valid parking permit and may park in a resident lot according to their permit.\n\nUnpack\n\nOnce you have moved your vehicle, you may return to your space and begin unpacking. Remember to take all trash and recycling to the receptacles outside the building and don’t block hallways or doors as you unpack.\n\nIf you would like to loft your bed, follow our instructions to do so with two people and a rubber mallet.\n\nBed rails will be in the room when you arrive and cannot be removed from the space.\n\nLofting your Bed\n\nStudents are responsible for lofting their own beds. However, lofting the provided ADA compliant modular beds is a simple process requiring two people. Just follow the steps below.\n\nRemove the mattress\n\nLift all four corners of the spring frame out of the headboard and footboard\n\nRaise the frame to the desired height (11 different options)\n\nHook the frame on the brackets on each leg\n\nMake sure it’s secure\n\nReplace the mattress\n\nEnjoy the extra space!\n\nWhat is a Modular Bed Frame?\n\nThe bed frames provided are modular, which will allow you to raise or lower your bed to various heights without a loft kit. Raising the height of your bed creates more floor space, which allow more room for things like futons and TV’s.\n\nCan I Use Other Lofts/Risers?\n\nRaised platform floors, bed risers, personally constructed lofts, or other physical space alterations are not allowed in any University-owned housing.\n\nSchedule\n\nFall Move-In\n\n2024 Fall Move-in\n\nGeneral Move-in: August 14-17\n\n7 a.m. to 1 p.m. Wednesday, Friday, Saturday\n\n7 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday\n\nSorority (Barnett, Quad, Smith) Move-in: August 12\n\nSorority Potential New Members Move-in: August 13\n\nOrientation\n\nWelcome Week\n\n2024 Summer Move-in\n\nGeneral Move-in: June 23\n\nStudent Orientation: June 25\n\nSummer 2024 Meal Plans Activate: June 21\n\n2025 Spring Move-in\n\nSpring Move-in begins Saturday, January 4 starting at 12:00pm.
