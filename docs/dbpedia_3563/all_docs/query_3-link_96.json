        "text": "Photo Credit: Jeff Katz Photography\n\nNowadays, Silas Weir Mitchell is more than just recognizable face -- he's one of the stars of NBC's thrilling series Grimm and plays Monroe, a fan-favorite Grimm who is a wolf-like Wesen Blutbad.\n\nGrimm is preparing to end its second season with a bang and has established itself as a thrilling police procedural that isn't anywhere near scared of bending reality -- you know, shaking up the status quo. God only knows that we need a show to do that in a television landscape that is wrought with police procedurals.\n\nIn fact, I'm pretty sure that the good folks at NBC were faced with creating this or a new incarnation of Law & Order called Law & Order: Financial Intelligence Unit where people would sit in cubicles all day looking through check kiting suspects and chasing down overdrawn bank customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust kidding -- as far as I know.\n\nIn any case, they were right to go with Grimm.\n\nSo, you're on a hit show, Silas -- how does it feel?\n\nIt's sort of like living the dream. I've been banging around this business for a long time and it's a nice feeling to find a home that's really comfortable. Portland is a fun town to work in, I love the people that I work with, and there are no prima donnas on the set and no Hollywood BS. It's just a fun work environment where people like coming in to work, having fun, and getting the job done. It's a good cast.\n\nYou do have an outstanding cast. Another thing that is really cool about the show is that it's a prime-time, major network series that is a reality bender -- and proud of it too.\n\nI think that's one of the things that works with the show is that it's familiar enough that people are comfortable with it. It's different enough that people aren't bored with it. Yes, it's a police procedural; yes, there's a crime; yes's there a villain of the week in the form of a creature of the week on our show. There are certain formulaic elements that have to bend to the zeitgeist when it comes to a network show. You have to have a hook and this show has a lot of hooks. There are elements that you know you're going to get, but the writers are really good enough to work within this stringent kind of structure and still deliver surprises. A lot of that has to do with the world that they've created. Structurally, it's regimented and within that structure there is a lot of room for a lot of Grimm surprises which is fun for everyone, fun for us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour character, Monroe, must be pretty fun to play; he's the sarcastic comedy relief in a tense situation.\n\nIf you look at the nature of the show when you consider it's reality based side which deals with a detective that deals with some pretty gruesome stuff on a daily basis, that's some pretty dark stuff. The detective has these things that he wants to be able to share but he can't. Then you throw in a character that is kind of in between the world, like Monroe, who is sort of trying to disavow his inner demon and live on the straight and narrow in the human world -- that makes for a lot of conflict and inner conflict in the characters. There's a lot of room for humor in there. There's sort of a blas√© kind of quality in the face of things that are extremely strange to the audience and to the main character. There are a lot of qualities about Monroe story-wise that lend themselves to a comic bent.\n\nMonroe is a bit different from the first episode to present, he kind of wanted to keep his head down to start out.\n\nHe did want to keep his head down, make his clocks and live his life and not give any reign to this history and ancestry that he has. Then in a moment of shock and weakness, he's spotted by the one person in the world that can truly see him for what he really is and he doesn't want to be seen. One of the motivating factors for Monroe despite the fact that he and Nick are natural enemies and Nick is supposed to kill Wesens. Monroe sees that Nick is a different kind of Grimm, unlike his ancestors he recognizes the fact that not every Wesen is inherently evil and deserves to be beheaded. Once Monroe begins to trust this guy from working with him a little bit that it isn't a total betrayal of his people because Nick is trying to do good in the world. Part of the reason why Monroe disavowed his ancestry is because they weren't trying to do good in the world.\n\nThere are some really interesting things going on with the characters in this show in terms of the depth. It can make one question what its genre classification should be.\n\nA world with an expanded or more mythological sense of reality which is essentially what they mean they say genre. Calling a show that is science fiction or mythological genre shows is very strange. What kind of genre is a genre? It's like a generic term. Every cookie is a baked good, but not every baked good is a cookie. I sort of wrestle with this sometimes in my down time.\n\nSo, what can you tell us about the season finale coming up?\n\nIt's epic, very cinematic, and so large of a scale that it easily has to be one of our biggest episodes. The zombie puppet master has Nick in his crosshair, and one of your favorite characters might not make it out alive."
