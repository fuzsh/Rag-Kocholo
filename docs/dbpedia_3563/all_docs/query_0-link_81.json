        "text": "The first time Buck kissed a boy, he was five years old and had a mouth full of blood. He was still crying from running straight into Logan Matheson during recess, that breathless, hiccupping crying that takes forever to shake off. He wasn’t even entirely sure what happened. He was just running and then his mouth suddenly hurt. His blood was hot and bitter on his tongue, and he kept swallowing bits of it as he hyperventilated.\n\nFor a moment, the tears in his eyes cleared, and he saw Logan standing in front of him, with his shaggy blond hair and too-pale blue eyes, a baseball bat held limply in his right hand. His eyes were wide, and his mouth hung open a little bit. The baseball bat fell from his hand with a thunk, and he started frantically looking around the playground.\n\n“Mrs. Garcia!” Buck wailed, wincing when his jaw started screaming in pain.\n\n“Evan, wait!” Logan said, taking a step closer to Buck. “Let me kiss it better, just like my mom does!”\n\nBuck would’ve laughed in his face if he wasn’t in so much pain. That was baby stuff. He couldn’t remember the last time his mom put a band-aid on him, let alone kissed his cuts and bruises better. He wanted to tell Logan to leave him alone or else he’d tattle, but before he could, his world flipped upside down.\n\nLogan Matheson kissed him. Right on the mouth. Like people do in the grown-up movies Maddie let him watch with her even when it was past his bedtime. But Logan Matheson wasn’t a girl, and Buck wasn’t, either, so what was it called when two boys kissed?\n\n“Logan! Evan!” Mrs. Garcia called, staring at them with wide eyes. “Why are you two kissing?”\n\nBuck jumped back, his heart hammering in his chest. He looked at Logan, whose eyes were impossibly wide as they looked at Mrs. Garcia. There was a smear of Buck’s blood on his chin that he quickly tried to wipe away.\n\nMrs. Garcia’s eyes flicked back and forth between them, her brow furrowing and her mouth hanging open. “What happened? Why is Evan bleeding?”\n\n“I accidentally hit him with my bat,” Logan answered, his voice trembling. “I promise I didn’t mean to!”\n\n“It’s okay, Logan, I believe you,” Mrs. Garcia replied. She knelt in front of Buck, pulling his lower lip down to look at the damage. She winced, but put on a smile. “Looks like the Tooth Fairy will be visiting you tonight, Evan.”\n\n“Really?” Buck said dumbly.\n\n“Yep!” she replied, trying to sound chipper. “Now, Evan, you don’t think you swallowed one of your teeth, do you?”\n\nBuck’s eyes widened. He didn’t like the idea of one of his teeth sitting in his stomach. “I don’t think so.”\n\nMrs. Garcia started feeling around in the grass, and after a moment, she sighed in relief. She held out her hand, showing him two tiny teeth stained with blood. “Found ‘em. Let’s get you to the nurse, Evan. Logan, you come with us, too, honey.”\n\nThe other kids in their grade had gathered around to watch now. Some of them were grossed out by all the blood or the nasty bruise already forming on Buck’s jaw, some teased about Logan being in trouble, and others snickered about the fact that they were two boys and they were kissing. Buck felt his cheeks get hot, but Mrs. Garcia hurried him inside before he heard anything else, before anyone noticed he was embarrassed.\n\nWhen his mother arrived at the school, when she saw all the blood on his shirt and the icepack he held to his jaw and the tooth-shaped necklace around his neck that held his real teeth inside it, she was angry.\n\nYou should’ve been watching where you were going. You’re never careful, no matter how many times I tell you to be. You don’t understand how much it hurts me to see you hurt.\n\nWhen his mother learned of the kiss between him and Logan Matheson, she was furious.\n\nCan I speak with this boy’s mother? I mean, I’ve never heard of such a thing! I don’t care if this boy was just being nice, kissing my son is completely inappropriate! They’re in kindergarten, for God’s sake!\n\nWhen Maddie came home from school that day, he showed her his two missing teeth and she rolled her eyes and smiled. She sat next to him on his bed, putting her arm around him and pulling him close. He told her about Logan, how he kissed it all better. Her brow furrowed.\n\nI bet Mom wasn’t happy. For the record, I think you’re too young to be kissing anyone, boy or girl. But there are worse things that can happen to you besides a boy kissing you. No one in your class made fun of you for it, right?\n\nWhen Buck’s father came home from work that night and learned about the incident, he held Buck’s chin tightly and spoke to him in a low voice, with an all-too-familiar look of disappointment in his eyes.\n\nYou listen to me, Evan. Boys can’t kiss other boys. Never let another boy kiss you again, and never, ever kiss another boy first. Do you understand me?\n\nBuck wanted to ask why boys couldn’t kiss each other—Maddie said it wasn’t a bad thing—but he hated that look of disappointment in his dad’s eyes, and he hated his mom’s angry, random outbursts. So, he nodded.\n\n“I understand.”\n\nBuck couldn’t remember the second time he kissed a boy.\n\nHe was nineteen. He was failing all his classes, going on reckless joyrides on his bike, sleeping with every girl that gave him the time of day. He was mad at his parents and at the world and at himself and nothing could take his anger away.\n\nHe was at a party. He never drank much at parties; he was afraid of not being able to control his bravado, of ruining the few close relationships he did have. But one night he let himself have a shot of vodka and then he couldn’t stop. Once he was drunk, he wasn’t angry anymore. He felt free, alive, almost himself.\n\nEventually, he was standing on the balcony of a stranger’s apartment next to Bryan, who was in his bio 102 class and wore wire-framed glasses and had just cropped his ink-dark curls down to a crew cut that made him look older and smarter and so beautiful Buck had to bite the inside of his cheek every time he looked at him. They just talked as the darkness made the world colder, their breath clouding in front of them.\n\nIn a split second of sobriety, Buck realized that he’d never noticed the intimacy of breathing at the same time as someone until now. He matched his breaths with Bryan’s until they were in sync, and he wondered if Bryan would notice.\n\nThe last thing Buck remembered from that night was noticing how the stars reflected in Bryan’s glasses, and, beyond the lenses, in his deep brown, shining eyes.\n\nHe came to hours later in a bathroom with a splitting headache and the taste of vomit in his mouth. When he stumbled around the apartment, Bryan was nowhere to be found.\n\nThe next day in bio 102, Bryan talked to him as if nothing ever happened, but there was something in his eyes that made Buck think something had.\n\nBuck didn’t remember the second time he kissed a boy. It was for the best.\n\nMaybe in another life, in another world, the third time Buck kissed a boy would’ve been the beginning of a fairy tale he never thought he could have, that he never deserved. Maybe if he was anyone else, he would’ve fallen in love and never looked back.\n\nBut he was Buck. He wasn’t easy to love, and he was far too easy to leave behind. And, every once in a while, someone actually loved him back and he still found a way to blow it all up. He was Buck, and that meant that love was always slipping through his fingers, no matter how desperately he clung to it.\n\nEver since that night he stood on a stranger’s balcony with Bryan, he’d nursed more than a few crushes on guys he’d met traveling around the country.\n\nNow, he was twenty-four and working at a dude ranch in Montana, his skin tanner than it had ever been in his life, his heart and his stomach flip-flopping around inside him as he was surrounded by pretty boys. Boys with toothpicks between their lips, boys with rough, strong hands, boys in Levi’s and cowboy boots and button-ups with the sleeves rolled up.\n\nHe never thought about what he would tell Maddie in the postcards he sent to her, but now he wasn’t sure what he would say. He didn’t know how he… felt being here, but the job paid well, and him and the other ranch hands all lived onsite, so it was the best situation he could find while he decided which of his whims he was going to follow next. He could bear the twisting feeling in his gut and the dizzying beat of his heart for a few more weeks. He couldn’t ignore these feelings—his feelings were always too big to be ignored—but he could keep it hidden in plain sight within himself, like a pill he could keep under his tongue until he was ready to swallow it.\n\nBut he always found himself choking on the truth around Wyatt.\n\nWyatt was younger than Buck, probably 21 or 22, but he seemed older than him. Buck had spent his entire life acting like a little kid so his parents would remember that he existed at all, and the act seemed to set his maturity back further and further the older he got. But Wyatt carried himself like a soldier, like someone who had to grow up quicker than they were supposed to. He had that same look in his eye that Maddie did when her and Buck were growing up, a dull shine from knowing too much and wishing they didn’t.\n\nWyatt always carried a vintage film camera on a strap around his neck, always invited the other ranch hands out for drinks at the end of the day, always offered a sage word of advice or a reassuring hand on the shoulder. Working at the ranch made his pale skin tanner and his dark hair lighter, like the sun and the soil were transforming him into a whole new person. He had a pretty smile, accented with deep-set dimples and white, crooked teeth.\n\nBuck had a hard time tearing his eyes and mind away from him.\n\nOne day, Buck was staring at Wyatt from across the gravel lot at the entrance of the ranch, watching him sit on the bed of his truck and drink beers with two other guys, when Wyatt met his gaze. Buck felt his stomach lurch, his heart pounding against his ribcage. He smiled clumsily and forced himself not to wince. God, he must’ve looked so stupid.\n\nBut Wyatt smiled back, waved him over. He said something to the other guys that made them shrug and walk off, swallowing the last swig of their beers.\n\nBuck’s nausea worsened, making him think he would throw up before he could make his way over to Wyatt. He couldn’t tell if it was anticipation or some sort of genuine fear, but for him, those two emotions were both precursors to inevitable disappointment. The only difference between them was the level of optimism he had before things fell apart.\n\nSomehow, though, he walked over to Wyatt’s truck and sat next to him on the bed, his stomach still twisting itself in knots.\n\n“I’d offer you a beer but I don’t have any left,” Wyatt told him. He had the slightest southern accent, lengthening his vowels and slurring his words together.\n\n“It’s okay,” Buck replied. “You know you didn’t have to send those other guys away, right? I mean, I wasn’t trying to interrupt anything.”\n\nWyatt chuckled. “That’s all right, Evan. We haven’t had any time alone yet.”\n\nBuck’s eyebrow furrowed. “I guess we haven’t. We’re all pretty busy.”\n\n“Especially you,” Wyatt said. “You’re a hard worker.”\n\nBuck laughed nervously, massaging the back of his neck. “If you were my boss, I’d assume you’re about to give me a promotion.”\n\n“I mean it,” Wyatt replied, clapping his hand on Buck’s shoulder. When Buck half-flinched away from his touch, Wyatt dropped his hand, curled it into a fist in his lap. “You really work up a sweat out there.”\n\n“Yeah,” Buck choked out. He wished he had a beer now. “If there’s one thing I know how to do, it’s work.”\n\n“You planning on sticking around?” Wyatt asked, taking a long sip of his beer.\n\nBuck sighed, then finally shrugged. “Not sure yet. I’ve just been jumping around wherever I can find work. I do miss the ocean. Might find my way back to it next.”\n\nWyatt nodded, smiling to himself. “Ocean, huh? I can see you surfing on a beach in California or something, somewhere where there’s lots of sunshine.”\n\n“Maybe not California,” Buck mused. He tried to let himself relax. Faking a smile helped. “I’ve never left the country before. Maybe it’s time I get my first passport. I’ll just have to write to my sister first.”\n\nWyatt raised an eyebrow. “You write to her often?”\n\nBuck shook his head a little. “Just every time I wind up in a new place. I send her a postcard, maybe a picture if I have one.”\n\nWyatt’s smile widened as he held up his camera. “I’d be happy to take one for you to send to her. What’s her name?”\n\n“Maddie,” Buck answered, genuinely smiling now. “She’s an ER nurse back home in Hershey.”\n\n“Hershey?” Wyatt echoed, his eyebrows raised. “You’re quite a ways away from home.”\n\n“Yeah,” Buck shrugged. “There’s not much left for me there.”\n\nWyatt nodded, took a long sip of his beer. “That’s how I feel about Macon.”\n\n“Where’s that?” Buck asked.\n\n“Georgia,” Wyatt replied. “I was never welcome there. It was almost a relief when my folks kicked me out my senior year of high school. Lived with some friends until graduation, then I left the state as soon as I could and ain’t been back since.”\n\n“Wow,” was all Buck could manage in response.\n\n“It is what it is,” Wyatt said nonchalantly, finishing his beer and setting it down next to him. “How about that picture for your sister?”\n\n“Oh,” Buck stammered. “Yeah, sure.”\n\nWyatt stood, taking his hat off his head and putting it on Buck’s. “We gotta show her you’re a cowboy now.”\n\nBuck let himself laugh. “I don’t know about cowboy.”\n\n“No one chooses to be a cowboy, Evan,” Wyatt quipped, handing him a lasso of all things from the bed of his truck. “They just are.”\n\nBuck reluctantly accepted the rope, running his thumb along its coarse surface. “Should I pose like a cowboy, too?”\n\n“Well, you’re already sitting on the bed of a truck,” Wyatt chuckled. “How about you just look off in the distance and put on your best smolder.”\n\n“Okay,” Buck sighed, looking to his right and keeping his face neutral.\n\n“You must’ve been a real heartthrob in high school,” Wyatt said after the shutter clicked.\n\nBuck felt his face get hot. “You could say that.”\n\n“Could?” Wyatt asked, sitting down next to Buck again. “Come on, Evan, there’s no way you weren’t the star quarterback, prom king, Prince Charming type.”\n\nBuck shook his head. “Wasn’t quite cool enough for that. I think people could tell I was trying too hard to be that kind of guy, but I just wasn’t.”\n\n“Hmm,” Wyatt hummed, nodding. “Never pegged you for the lonely type.”\n\nBuck felt a twinge in his chest at that awful word. Lonely. It always felt like onomatopoeia to him, like the sound of his own heartbeat in his ears when he was trapped in another argument with his parents, when he found himself in a crowded house party but still felt completely and utterly alone. LONE-ly, BUM-bum, LONE-ly, BUM-bum.\n\nBuck chuckled dryly. “You’re the first person that hasn’t caught up on it.”\n\n“Pretending for as long as you have just destroys you little by little,” Wyatt replied. “You know that, right?”\n\n“I mean, yeah,” Buck shrugged. “I just. I wouldn’t say I’m pretending right now. I’m just… Blending in.”\n\n“There’s not much difference between those two things,” Wyatt told him. “You’re either pretending that you’re someone else or you’re pretending that you’re not even there.”\n\nBuck sighed, bit his lip. “You’re right.”\n\n“I usually am,” Wyatt replied. “I know a thing or two about pretending. It was when I stopped pretending that my parents kicked me out.”\n\nBuck had a feeling he could fill in the blanks on his own, but he wanted to hear Wyatt say it, so he asked, “What were you pretending?”\n\nWyatt paused for a moment, wringing his hands. “That I liked girls.”\n\n“Do… the other guys here know about you?” Buck asked, trying to be gentle.\n\n“Some of them do,” Wyatt answered. “And you do, too, now. The boss sure don’t, though. Plan to keep it that way.”\n\n“Right,” Buck said. “I’m sorry you had to pretend for so long.”\n\n“Not as long as you have,” Wyatt pointed out. “Are you pretending to your sister, too?”\n\nThe question hurt Buck more than he thought it would. His tongue immediately started tripping over itself. “She’s got enough on her plate right now. She worried about me my whole life, she doesn’t need to worry about me anymore than she already does.”\n\nWyatt put his hand on Buck’s shoulder again and held it tightly. “I don’t want you to pretend with me, too. You don’t have to.”\n\nBuck forced a scoff as he stood and backed away from Wyatt. “You barely know me.”\n\nWyatt stepped in front of him, his eyes bright and earnest. Buck hadn’t noticed that they were hazel before. “I want to know you, Evan. I can tell you’re hurting and I want to be there for you. I don’t want you to be alone.”\n\nBuck’s eyes started filling with tears. He always hated how easy it was for him to cry. “I—” he choked out, wanting to say something but not finding any real words. “I should get back to my room.”\n\nWyatt stepped in front of him again, firmly placing both of his hands on his shoulders. “Please don’t walk away from me.”\n\n“I don’t know what you want me to do,” Buck said lamely, his voice breaking.\n\nWyatt bit his lip, studied Buck’s face. “I told you about the part of myself I hid for so long. It’s your turn now.”\n\nBuck shook his head. “That’s not fair.”\n\n“Is it not fair or are you just not ready to say it?” Wyatt asked, more a gentle question than a challenge. He sighed, dropping his hands from Buck’s shoulder and running them through his hair. “I know it’s hard. You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. Just… I’m here for you. Okay? Whatever you need.”\n\nBuck let out a deep breath. “I appreciate that. I really do.”\n\n“Of course, Evan,” Wyatt replied.\n\nBuck felt a tear roll down his cheek but quickly wiped it away. He tried to ignore the lump in his throat, tried to ignore the way his breath was trembling. He wasn’t thinking, and something made his arms reach for Wyatt and embrace him.\n\nWyatt hugged him back, held him so gently Buck couldn’t hold back his sobs anymore.\n\n“It’s okay, Evan,” Wyatt whispered. “I got you.”\n\nBuck took slow, deep breaths until he stopped crying. He pulled away from the hug, but Wyatt’s hands lingered on his arms.\n\nBuck felt his heart start racing in his chest. He’d had moments like this with twenty other girls before, the moment right before a kiss, the moment right before the world stops spinning and time slows to a crawl and something that could be love blooms.\n\nWyatt was leaning closer and closer to Buck, studying his face and waiting for any sign that Buck didn’t want him to come any closer.\n\nBuck was frozen, staring into Wyatt’s eyes. He didn’t know what he wanted. He had a feeling he wouldn’t know for sure until Wyatt was already kissing him, until they were breathing the same air.\n\nWyatt was a breath away from Buck’s lips. His hand moved up to cradle Buck’s face, warm and strong and gentle.\n\nBuck’s eyes closed against his will. He was tired of fighting.\n\nWyatt kissed him, slow and soft, and Buck could’ve cried all over again. His knees turned to water, his heart was beating loud and hard in his chest, his hands shook as they rested on Wyatt’s hips and pulled him closer.\n\nWyatt deepened the kiss, placing his other hand over Buck’s heart. The wide open Montana sky above them was burning as the sun set—Buck swore he could see it behind his eyelids, the billowing clouds and the stars blinking awake. It felt like a movie, like there should be an orchestral score swelling over the sound of their breathing, the sound of their lips meeting and breaking apart.\n\nFor a moment, Buck wanted this. For a moment, he thought he could kiss Wyatt back, let himself fall in love in this picture-perfect moment, but the moment ended and the voice inside him started screaming louder than he could bear.\n\nThis is wrong.\n\nBuck backed away a little bit, breaking the kiss. Wyatt straightened, the slightest look of panic on his face.\n\n“Did you not want me to do that?” he asked, worriedly studying Buck’s face.\n\n“I don’t, I don’t know,” Buck stammered. “I… I’m really flattered, but—”\n\nWyatt’s face fell, but he nodded. “It’s okay. I understand.”\n\n“I’m so sorry,” Buck said, hoping Wyatt could hear how much he meant it.\n\nWyatt smiled sadly. “Good night, Evan.”\n\nBuck watched him turn and walk away, his chest breaking open as his heart beat against his ribcage, reaching for Wyatt. If this really were a movie, Buck would run up to Wyatt and kiss him as hard as he could. If this really were a movie, it wouldn’t matter what Buck’s father told him almost twenty years ago, and it wouldn’t matter that Logan Matheson kissed him that day in recess, and it wouldn’t matter if Buck kissed Bryan from his bio 102 class on that stranger’s balcony. None of it would’ve mattered because it all led to Wyatt, to his lips that Buck could keep on kissing until the day he died.\n\nBut he was Buck, and this was not a movie. He watched Wyatt walk away from him, never once pausing or looking over his shoulder.\n\nNo one ever looked back at him as they left him behind. Maybe they knew he couldn’t look away from them, so they kept their eyes forward so they wouldn’t give him false hope, showing him some form of mercy. Maybe they did have just a shred of remorse all along.\n\nWhen Wyatt walked into one of the boarding houses and shut the door behind him, Buck wanted to scream. He almost wanted to punch something, kick something, replace the aching in his chest with anything he could explain away without telling a lie.\n\nHe didn’t scream. He didn’t split open his knuckles or break one of his toes. He went to his room and sobbed into his pillow until he fell asleep, where he dreamed of blood filling his mouth and his heart beating too loudly in his chest.\n\nWhen he woke up and found the picture Wyatt took of him underneath his door without any sort of note attached to it, he was almost glad he’d run out of tears to cry. He sent it to Maddie on his way out of town that night, a familiar numbness settling in his chest as he made a point not to look at his rearview mirror.\n\nThe fourth time Buck kissed a boy was like salt being poured into his oldest wounds—his ever-present fear that he’d always been doomed from the start, that loving a boy could never fill the hole his parents carved into him with their sharpest knives.\n\nLove me, anyway.\n\nHis own words echoed in his head as he stormed out of Maddie and Chimney’s apartment, letting the door slam behind him. He couldn’t get his parents’ faces out of his mind, how they looked at him like he was a child throwing a tantrum, like he was asking for the impossible by asking to be treated like their son instead of a ghost, a shadow.\n\nThey didn’t even bother to shout after him. They didn’t try to follow him down the hallway and see where he was going. They just let him go. They were probably complaining about him to Maddie, asking how he could be so childish, how he could speak to them that way. He swore he could see Maddie plaster on a smile as she shrugged and went to grab dessert from the kitchen. He was so stupid to think she would choose him over them, that she wouldn’t break another pinky promise.\n\nHe felt like he was nineteen again. He wanted to punch a wall, scream his lungs out, cry until he couldn't breathe. He didn't know when the path he was on had become a circle, or how he hadn't seen the curve coming. He didn't know anything.\n\nHe made it to the front entrance to the apartment building and threw the door open, tears filling his eyes as unseasonably cool air rushed over him. He shivered against the cold, choked back an angry, desperate sob. He wiped at his eyes and let his body take control, leaving his Jeep behind in the parking lot and walking towards the city. He could use a drink or two.\n\nHe walked until he found a bar about a half mile from Maddie and Chim’s place, a dimly lit room with a faded sign hanging over the door. His shoes stuck to the wooden floor a bit with every step he took as he entered. Just barely audible 90s soft rock music played over the speakers, and he wished it was loud enough to drown out his thoughts.\n\nThere was no one in the bar except for him and the bartender. It was after eight o’clock, but maybe the place wasn’t busy on Wednesdays. Buck almost wanted to turn around and leave, but the bartender was already looking at him and saying hello. He felt a twinge in his chest when he realized the bartender was handsome.\n\nHe was around Buck’s age, maybe a bit younger, wearing a black button-up with small pins decorating the collar. He had dark, curly hair that glowed golden in the light, light brown skin covered in freckles, soft green eyes that scanned over Buck in a way that didn’t make him feel judged. The bartender raised his eyebrows, gestured to the barstool directly in front of him.\n\n“You look like you could use a whiskey,” he said, picking up a glass and setting it down on the bar.\n\n“Anything that’ll get me drunk will work,” Buck replied, taking his seat.\n\n“Already having a bad night?” the bartender asked, grabbing a bottle from the shelf and pouring its contents into Buck’s glass.\n\nBuck accepted the drink but hesitated taking his first sip, considering how much he wanted to share with a stranger. Finally, he shrugged and swirled his glass. “I thought you could tell when I walked in.”\n\n“Yes, but that question was an invitation to open up if you feel like it.” The bartender leaned against the counter, and Buck noticed the nametag pinned to his shirt that read Silas.\n\nBuck shrugged again, but gave him a small smile. “Maybe after a few more drinks.”\n\n“That’s fair,” Silas replied, nodding.\n\n“Is it usually this quiet here?” Buck asked, then finally had a swallow of whiskey. He liked the warmth, the burning.\n\n“Yeah,” Silas sighed. “It’s not the best location to be honest. Easy to miss. Every night, at least a hundred people walk right by that door.”\n\nBuck looked over his shoulder at the entrance at the same moment a group of girls passed, leaning on each other and laughing. “People just have their go-to spots, I guess.”\n\n“I’m glad you found us,” Silas smiled. “This could be your new spot. Next time you’re here, bring your friends so they can see how cool it is here.”\n\nBuck let himself chuckle. “If you guys had a pool table in here that would really seal the deal for me and my friends.”\n\nSilas visibly brightened at Buck’s suggestion. “I keep telling my boss we need more things to do in here. I mean, we have TVs, but not everyone wants to watch football games when they go out for the night, you know?”\n\nBuck nodded as he drank the rest of his whiskey. “Right. I’m, uh, I’m a firefighter, and our pool table is pretty much the only thing that keeps us from killing each other during a 24-hour shift.”\n\nSilas’s eyebrows shot up. “A firefighter? Must be stressful. That’s not why you’re drinking, is it?”\n\nBuck handed his glass to Silas, who filled it up for him. “Oh, no. I love my job. I mean, I literally can’t imagine doing anything else.”\n\nSilas nodded. “I can’t tell you how many people I’ve talked to that would rather die of alcohol poisoning than go to work the next morning.”\n\nBuck blinked a few times, took a sip of his drink, did his best to push away the nagging feeling that no one would care if he left this bar in a body bag, felt his stomach turn as he thought, Mom and Dad certainly wouldn’t. He wished he could get drunk faster. “I can’t consider myself completely unlucky, then.”\n\n“Unlucky in love, maybe?” Silas suggested.\n\nBuck actually laughed. “No, nothing like that. I’m single and don’t particularly want to mingle at the moment.”\n\n“Good for you,” Silas grinned. “You know, maybe our jobs aren’t that different. I see all kinds of people, and I’m sure you do, too.”\n\nBuck’s phone buzzed in his pocket. He checked it out of habit, and sighed when he saw a text from Maddie.\n\nMads: Are you okay? I shouldn’t have asked them to visit, it always ends like this\n\nHe quickly typed a response: Don’t worry about it. I’m fine. Just getting some air.\n\n“Sorry,” Buck muttered. “You’re right. Being a firefighter in L.A. introduces you to all types of people, crazy or otherwise. Sometimes they’re drunk, too.”\n\nSilas laughed. “For me, they’re always drunk.”\n\nBuck laughed, too, then finished his second glass of whiskey. “Would you rather deal with a typical drunk and disorderly customer or run into a burning building and save everyone inside?”\n\n“Drunk and disorderly,” Silas answered immediately. “I’m not brave enough to go into a burning building unless someone I love is inside.”\n\n“I don’t know if I’m brave,” Buck admitted, staring at the little puddle of pale liquid at the bottom of his glass. “I think it just matters more to me that other people make it home to the people they love, and if it means I don’t make it home someday, that’s okay.”\n\nSilas’s brow furrowed. He reached for Buck’s glass and filled it. “That’s kinda dark.”\n\nBuck sighed. “Just don’t tell any of my friends that I said that.”\n\nSilas nodded and leaned forward, his elbows resting on the bar. “Trouble at home, then? Trouble with your friends?”\n\nA knot formed in Buck’s stomach. He took a deep breath and drank his third glass of whiskey in one swallow. “I thought I wouldn’t be such an easy nut to crack.”\n\n“To be fair, it took a handful of leading questions before I found the right one,” Silas replied. “Most people immediately spill their guts to me.”\n\nBuck placed his glass in front of Silas again. “My parents are in town. We had dinner. Things were said. I stormed out and found myself here.”\n\n“You’re singing my song,” Silas said, filling Buck’s glass and sliding it towards him. “No one can hurt you like your parents can.”\n\nBuck nodded, staring down at his glass. “All they ever do is hurt me.”\n\nSilas was silent for a moment. “What’s your name?”\n\nBuck looked up, embarrassed he hadn’t told Silas before. “Oh, um… Everyone just calls me Buck.”\n\nSilas smiled a little. “Buck the firefighter.”\n\n“That’s me,” Buck said, chuckling humorlessly. “Don’t ask me for a photo or my Instagram or my phone number. I get that enough when I’m out on calls.”\n\n“I’m not surprised everyone fawns over you, Buck,” Silas replied. “Are there any other hot firefighters you’re working with that may be interested?”\n\nBuck shook his head. “Not any that are looking for a date if that’s what you’re asking.”\n\nSilas smiled and shook his head. “Bummer.”\n\nBuck leaned forward, resting his arms on the bar. His head was starting to hurt a little bit. “Maybe try the 133. A lot of singles over there.”\n\n“Thanks for the tip,” Silas said, smiling shyly.\n\nBuck nodded, then found himself staring at Silas’s eyelashes, full and curled and pretty like a girl’s. Old feelings stirred in his chest, old memories came to his mind. But then he heard his father’s voice, all those years ago, clearer than his present.\n\nNever let another boy kiss you again, and never, ever kiss another boy first.\n\nBuck came back to himself as he felt Silas lift his chin and kiss him. Silas’s lips were warm and soft, and he tasted like chapstick and spearmint gum, and it took Buck five seconds too long to realize that this was wrong. But with three glasses of whiskey muddling his mind, he could only be angry about it.\n\nBuck shoved Silas away, knocking over his glass in the process. He jumped out of his seat as hot, angry tears welled in his eyes, as his breath quickened. He saw his father’s face in the back of his mind, flickering between tonight and the day Logan Matheson kissed him, flickering between constant disappointment. He could’ve thrown up, right then and there.\n\n“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” he said, not nearly as angry as he felt. “You don’t know me. You don’t know if I’m like you.”\n\nSilas’s eyes were so wide, so panicked, that it almost snapped Buck out of his anger. “I’m so, so sorry, I swear I—I felt something, I—”\n\n“No, I don’t wanna hear it,” Buck dismissed, feeling his heart racing in his chest. He rubbed at his eyes, hoping it would make his tears go away. “I… I need to go.”\n\nHe fished his wallet out of his pocket, grabbing a 20-dollar bill he didn’t know he had and aimlessly threw it towards Silas. It just fluttered to the floor, wrinkled and faded.\n\n“I’m sorry,” he said, broken. He couldn’t help but think of Wyatt, how that was the last thing he said to him after he kissed him. He turned on his heel and left the bar, shivering again. It was darker, colder outside than it was when he left Maddie and Chimney’s apartment.\n\nHe picked a direction and started walking. He wasn’t aware of where he was going, where he wanted to end up. His tears kept swelling in his throat, kept rolling down his cheeks. He tasted blood in his mouth, tasted whiskey, tasted tears. His head was spinning. Every breath he took felt like a knife tearing between his ribs.\n\nNever let another boy kiss you again, and never, ever kiss another boy first.\n\nBuck started running. The city lights around him blurred with motion, with tears.\n\nI’ll never stop disappointing them. I’ll never not want to stop disappointing them. They’ll never love me. I’ll never not want to love them. I’ll always need them. They’ll never want me, they’ve never wanted me.\n\nHe kept running until he could barely breathe. He didn’t know where he was, what time it was, whether he should make it home at all.\n\nWhy am I like this why can’t I be anyone else why can’t I be anyone that’s good enough for them why do I care so much why do I like it when boys kiss me—\n\nHe slowed to a stop at some street corner, leaned against some building and sat on the pavement. He stuffed the collar of his shirt into his mouth and let out a strangled scream, buried his face in his folded arms and sobbed.\n\nHe felt his phone buzz in his pocket. Then it stopped. It buzzed again. Stopped. Buzzed—\n\nHe found the strength to pull out his phone, blinked through his tears to see Chimney’s name on his screen. There was a 99% chance Maddie was with him, but Buck needed someone to talk to, someone to pick him up and take him home. He answered with trembling hands, his breath still unsteady.\n\nHe heard Chimney’s voice, and Maddie’s, too, saying his name, urgent and worried.\n\n“Please tell me you went home,” Maddie said.\n\nBuck squeezed his eyes shut. “I’m sorry, I… I just started walking and didn’t stop.” His voice started breaking, his breath hiccupped in his throat. “I don’t know where I am.”\n\nHe just heard Maddie muttering oh, God, then heard Chimney say, “That’s okay, Buck. Just tell us what you see around you and we’ll come find you.”\n\nBuck tried to keep slowing his breathing. He blinked through his tears and looked around. “Um. A gas station. Exxon. A hotel, a Marriott, I think. Wait, I see that Chinese place you guys like. It’s right across the street from me.”\n\n“Okay, good job, Buck, we’re on our way over to you now. Are you hurt?”\n\n“No. No, I’m not hurt. I’m… having a panic attack. I think.”\n\nMaddie’s voice returned to the call. “Breathe with me, Buck. You know what to do.”\n\nHis chest was on fire. He was still crying. “M-Maddie, please don’t tell Mom and Dad about this.”\n\nHe heard Maddie choke back a sob. “I won’t, I promise. Just focus on your breathing. We’ll be there soon.”\n\n“Okay, please hurry.”\n\nMaddie stayed on the phone with him and helped him breathe until her and Chimney found him. She ran out of the car before Chimney could put it in park and rushed over to Buck, wrapping him in her arms and then scanning his body for cuts and bruises. If Buck closed his eyes, they were on the staircase of their childhood home, and Maddie was patching him up with what was left in the first aid kit their parents kept in the hallway closet.\n\nBut his eyes were open, and they were on a street corner in L.A. recovering from another battle in the never-ending war with their parents. He didn’t know whose side Maddie was on, but there was enough betrayal from her that it left a bitter taste in his mouth, made him replay that disastrous dinner and question every word she did and didn’t say. He wanted to be angry, but the panic attack had taken its toll on him. He was too exhausted to fight with anyone that wasn’t himself.\n\nHe let them drive him back to his apartment, but he didn’t say a word on the way there. Maddie and Chimney were silent, too. But he was too lost in his own thoughts to notice the quiet. He kept thinking of Silas kissing him, how he almost wanted to kiss him back. And then he thought of Bryan, and the party he couldn’t remember, nursing the old fear that something happened that night like he was tearing off a scab he never let heal fully. Maybe when he woke up in the morning, Silas would be another memory he couldn’t get a hold of, like Bryan. Hopefully he would be.\n\nMaddie insisted on walking him to his front door, so Buck didn’t argue. She massaged her belly as they walked, fidgeted with her rings, glanced at him out of the corner of her eye.\n\nFinally, she asked, “Are you drunk?”\n\nBuck sighed as his eyes slid closed. “Only a little.”\n\nMaddie sighed. “I can’t say I’m not glad that you’re being honest with me. So, you found somewhere to drink and then you ended up wandering the streets having a panic attack? What happened, Evan? Really?”\n\nHe felt a twinge in his chest when he heard his real name, the only name their parents would use for him. “I got a little drunk and got trapped in my own head. That’s it.”\n\n“You’re lucky no one took advantage of you while you were out there by yourself,” Maddie told him. “You’re lucky you didn’t get killed.”\n\n“Am I?” he scoffed, the words escaping his mouth before he could stop himself.\n\n“You are,” she retorted, her voice firm. She stepped in front of him, making him stop in his tracks. “I know it’s hard for you to believe, but none of us want you to die.”\n\n“I know,” he replied. He rubbed at his right temple; his head was really starting to hurt.\n\n“Knowing and believing are two different things,” Maddie said, folding her arms.\n\nBuck nodded. “I know that, too.”\n\nMaddie sighed, shook her head. “God, I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall right now.”\n\nSomething twisted in Buck’s gut. It sounded eerily like something their mother would say. He felt a lump form in his throat, felt tears pool in his eyes again, but forced a laugh. “I’ll get out of your hair, then.”\n\nHe started to move past her, fishing his housekey out of his pocket.\n\n“You’ve never walked away from me before,” Maddie said. He couldn’t make out the emotion in her voice, but he didn’t want to turn around and look at her face.\n\n“Now you know how it feels to watch people leave you,” he replied. He didn’t recognize the sound of his own voice.\n\nHe unlocked his door then slammed it behind him harder than he meant to. The noise startled him, and he was crying again before he could stop himself. He stumbled back against the door, letting himself slide down to the floor.\n\nHe was so sick of pretending. He was so sick of the heart beating in his chest, the way it loved so easily, so wholly, the way it shrank the second it was loved in return. He was so sick of love in all its forms—mother, father, sister, girlfriend, boyfriend—slipping through his fingers like it was inevitable, like he would never deserve it.\n\nAs that week went on, as he discovered a photo of a boy he didn’t recognize in Maddie’s baby box, as he realized it was his fault the brother he never really knew was dead, as a raging inferno burned and exploded around him and he was ready for it to kill him, he realized, too, that he was so sick of being Buck.\n\nEven though the rest of the 118 saved him from that factory fire, even though he was willing to forgive his parents and acknowledge their grief, the rest of that year was a long and terrible one. He would be getting his weekly groceries and Daniel’s picture would come back to him, and he would spend the rest of the afternoon rewriting his own life in the back of his mind. He would look in the mirror and remember that if one thing had been different, he never would’ve existed. He would be inside a building on a call and he would be transported back to that factory fire, how he was ready and willing to succumb to the smoke and the fumes.\n\nBut every time those memories came flooding back, every time darkness and doubt began to overwhelm him, he would reach for his phone and call Eddie, who would always answer before the third ring.\n\nBuck was always a little afraid that he was in love with Eddie Diaz.\n\nThe jealousy he felt the day he met him was something he’d never experienced before. It terrified him, how much it consumed him, how it crawled under his skin, how it blinded him.\n\nIt terrified him, too, how easily it melted away after he helped Eddie remove a live grenade from a patient’s thigh. When they both exhaled at the same time when the round was safe in the box, when they looked at each other and smiled out of sheer relief. When they agreed to have each other’s backs, as if they’d been friends for decades instead of hours. How Buck felt something like warmth filling his chest, and he did his best not to distrust it or push it away.\n\nBut the fear of being in love with Eddie never really went away. Not after the tsunami when Buck thought Christopher was gone forever, not when Eddie called him exhausting in the middle of a crowded grocery store, not when Eddie was buried alive and Buck desperately clawed at the dirt to try to get to him, not when Buck learned about Daniel and Eddie was the only person he felt like he could really lean on.\n\nThe fear went away the second that sniper’s bullet tore through Eddie’s shoulder, the second his blood splattered all over Buck. What took its place was the horrible, gut-wrenching truth: that he loved Eddie, in every way he could, in the way he wasn’t supposed to.\n\nWhile Eddie was on an operating table, while his life hung in the balance, Buck wrestled with the truth, with the beating of his heart in his own chest. He was terrified he was fearing for Eddie’s life with the wrong kind of love, that he was afraid of losing a lover instead of a friend.\n\nBut Eddie didn’t die. His wound was stitched back together, he was awake and talking and alive. But that also meant that Buck would have to live with the truth he could never tell Eddie sitting like a stone on top of his chest. He wanted to feel relieved that he didn’t have to bury his best friend, that he didn’t have to tell Christopher that he was an orphan now, and he did feel relieved, but that weight on his chest never let him take a deep breath, never let him sigh out all the tension and fear he still held inside of him.\n\nNone of it was fair. Eddie didn’t deserve to get shot. Buck didn’t deserve to love Eddie.\n\nWhen he told Eddie it would’ve been better for Christopher if he’d been shot, he meant it. Christopher didn’t need to lose another parent. Eddie didn’t need to have that guilt of leaving Christopher behind in his final moments. They would both miss Buck, but they would still have each other. They would still have what was left of their family. But he immediately regretted saying so when Eddie looked at him as if he’d just told a bold-faced lie. He never hated himself so much in his life.\n\nWhen Eddie told him about his will, that Buck would become Christopher’s legal guardian if Eddie didn’t make it home one day, Buck was confused. He couldn’t stop thinking about how he broke down in front of Christopher a few days before, how he needed to be the one who held it together, yet Christopher was the one comforting him.\n\nHow large would his grief be if they’d actually lost Eddie? How could he ever be strong enough to be anything even resembling a father to Christopher? He loved him, so much that he couldn’t even begin to describe it. He wasn’t eloquent enough for that. But the idea that that love wouldn’t be enough to carry him through his grief terrified him.\n\nHow did Eddie do it, after him and Christopher lost Shannon? Buck almost wanted to ask, but he didn’t need to. Eddie didn’t die. Christopher still had a father. Buck’s grief was his own, and he had to deal with it on his own. He hated that he was grieving at all, when there wasn’t anything to grieve for.\n\nWhen Eddie called him Evan so sincerely, so softly, Buck wanted—terribly, desperately—to take his face in his hands and kiss him. The need rose in him like bile in his throat, bitter and acidic.\n\nThere were a million reasons why Buck couldn’t kiss Eddie. There was Ana, who looked at him with such love and tenderness, who Christopher loved having around. There was Taylor, who kissed Buck in his loft the day before, who he really could love if he let himself. There was Eddie’s heart that could never love Buck the way Buck’s loved Eddie’s. There was Buck’s father’s voice in the back of his head, always chanting, always screaming. There was Logan and Bryan and Wyatt and Silas, people he was never supposed to kiss, people whose memory left an awful ache in his chest. He couldn’t let himself taint Eddie like that.\n\n“You act like you’re expendable,” Eddie said, not looking at him. “But you’re wrong.”\n\nBuck couldn’t breathe. This was too much. He was just here to bring Eddie home, where everyone was waiting for him and blowing balloons and hanging up the banner Ana and Christopher made with butcher paper and dollar store paint. He wasn’t supposed to learn about Eddie’s will, hear Eddie call him by his first name, feel like he was being written into Eddie’s family. He was supposed to move on, pretend like he wasn’t in love with Eddie because he was gonna be okay, because he deserved the happiest life he could have, and that would never be a life with Buck.\n\nBuck wasn’t supposed to feel this loved right now, maybe even ever.\n\n“I… was expendable,” Buck choked out, feeling like he had to say something. “For a long time. It’s a hard habit to kick, I guess.”\n\n“I know about the stunt you pulled at that construction site,” Eddie told him. “Bobby told me about it. I wasn’t surprised, but I can only imagine if something happened to you up there.”\n\n“To be fair to me, I didn’t know I was in your will when I went up there,” Buck replied, forcing a laugh.\n\nEddie shook his head. “Something tells me you still would have even if you did know. It’s just who you are. You don’t leave anyone behind. You didn’t leave me behind even when bullets were flying everywhere, and now I get to go see my son because of it.”\n\nEddie looked at Buck, then, a sheen of tears shining in his eyes. “I can’t thank you enough for that.”\n\nTears sprung in Buck’s eyes, too. He blinked them away, forced a smile. “I was never gonna let you die out there. We’ve got each other’s backs any day, remember?”\n\n“I remember,” Eddie laughed. He turned his body towards Buck and reached to pull him into an awkward half-hug.\n\nBuck froze for a moment, but wrapped his arms around Eddie, trying to be careful with his wounded shoulder. He closed his eyes, and his breath finally left his lungs in a slow, relieved sigh. Eddie was alive. That was what was important.\n\nThe drive back to Eddie’s house was nice. They talked like they normally did, Eddie turned up the radio when he heard a song he liked, Buck’s heart was beating steady and strong in his chest.\n\nBuck lingered by the front door as Eddie knelt in front of Christopher, both their faces beaming, their arms wrapping around each other. An hour ago Buck probably would’ve put himself in Eddie’s place, as the understudy for the role of Christopher’s father. Now, he imagined himself as a third pair of arms, a third heartbeat, holding two of the most important people in his life as tightly as he could. Something more than a shadow in the Diaz family portrait.\n\nHe thought of the Christmas elf who thought he and Eddie were Christopher’s dads—how was that two Christmases ago? He remembered how he got flustered at the assumption, how, just for a second, he thought about how nice it would be to have a family of his own. He didn’t want to make things awkward, so he just thanked her and walked away to catch up with Eddie and Christopher.\n\nIf only that Buck could see himself now, see that the family he wanted was just over his shoulder.\n\n“He looks happy,” Taylor said, making Buck jump a bit. She gave him a soft smile in response, taking his hand in hers and squeezing it.\n\n“He does,” Buck agreed, sighing. “I’m glad he was able to come home.”\n\nTaylor moved to stand in front of him, taking his other hand in hers. She looked up at him, a small smile on her face. She was beautiful. He’d always thought so. There was enough room in his heart for her, for however long she would be able to tolerate him.\n\nHe kissed her first this time, smiled at her as he pulled away. He tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, and he thought he saw her cheeks get a little rosy.\n\n“Thanks for coming,” he told her.\n\nShe kissed him again. “I’m actually really good at hanging up homemade banners.”\n\nBuck laughed and pulled her into a hug. His eyes fell on Eddie, who had his arm around Ana and was talking to Tía Pepa. He watched Eddie and Ana look at each other, then kiss. He hated the way it made his stomach turn. He hated the way it made his chest ache.\n\n“Where are the drinks?” he asked Taylor, pulling away from the hug.\n\nShe took his hand and lead him towards the kitchen, saying something to him that he couldn’t quite make out.\n\nHe did his best not to look at Eddie again. He ignored the jealousy stirring in him. He ignored everything that told him just how in love he was with Eddie Diaz.\n\nHe wondered if this game he’d been playing his whole life would ever end.\n\nBy the fifth time Buck kissed a boy, he was almost ready to admit that maybe love wasn’t for him, and he was almost okay with that.\n\nIf he was honest with himself, he hadn’t had an organic connection with anyone since him and Taylor broke up a year and a half ago. The closest thing he had to a relationship since then was with a death doula who saw him as little more than a pretty, reanimated corpse. He was more interesting to her dead than alive.\n\n“That’s pretty damn sad, Buck,” Hen told him after he explained everything while they were getting drunk in his kitchen. He knew she was right and broke up with Natalia the next day. He was willing to admit that the timing could’ve been better, but the breakup needed to happen either way.\n\nBuck didn’t like talking about his near-death experience with people who’d been a family to him for six years, with his own sister. But it was all Natalia, who he’d known for a couple months, wanted to talk about. Even though Buck didn’t really remember dying, even though he wasn’t entirely sure he felt the lightning course through his body, she kept asking him about it. He understood why she did, of course. Her whole job was to hold someone’s hand and watch them die, over and over again. But his job was to do everything he could so people didn’t have to die before they were ready to.\n\n(Buck wasn’t ready to die, either, but nature or fate or God had other ideas. The only thing that held him was the length of rope that secured him to the ladder.)\n\nHe didn’t tell anyone this, but he had nightmares about dying. Everything was the same, but the force from the lightning strike pushed him down the ladder and the back of his skull cracked against one of the steps, or the rope mechanism stopped working and he just hung there until the life drained from his body. Everything was the same, but the lightning strike never stopped his heart, and he never lost consciousness. In these dreams, he knew what dying felt like.\n\nBut the nightmares stopped not long after he broke up with Natalia. He still thought about that night and about that strange dream he had while he was in a coma, but the nightmares were gone. He slept through the night, he went about his days as usual, and he wondered in the back of his mind what the rest of his life would look like now that he’d had a brush with death.\n\nIf he kept being honest with himself, he was still very much in love with Eddie Diaz. He went over on Sundays for movie nights with Eddie and Christopher, they had dinner at each other’s places once or twice a week, they spent every spare moment during their shifts together, and Buck was still in love with him.\n\nHe could never tell how much it bothered him that Eddie would never love him back. When Eddie started dating Marisol, it was like holding his hand over the eye of a stove—it burned if he thought about it too much, he felt the heat less if he drew his hand away from it. But no matter how much it stung, Buck was always able to maintain business as usual with Eddie. He’d done it for so long—mostly without knowing it—that it was second nature to him.\n\nBut Buck’s entire world tilted on its axis the second him and Eddie met Tommy Kinard.\n\nBuck would never want to downplay Tommy’s role in the cruise ship rescue. If it weren’t for him, Bobby and Athena and hundreds of others would’ve sank to the bottom of the ocean along with the Uno. Buck, for one, would always be eternally grateful for that.\n\nWhat he wasn’t expecting was for Tommy and Eddie to become such fast friends. What he wasn’t expecting was for Eddie to start blowing him off, to start asking him to watch Christopher for him while he and Tommy go to karaoke bar trivia. What he wasn’t expecting was for him to start feeling left out, like he was losing Eddie, like he couldn’t love him and be his friend at the same time.\n\nHe lied awake most nights and remembered the moment he saw Eddie for the first time—tousled hair, stubble, arms and chest and abs. He knew now that he loved him from that moment, but his mind tried to camouflage it with jealousy. Eddie was more handsome than he was, Eddie was smarter than he was, Eddie was cooler under pressure than he was, Eddie was better at this job than he was.\n\nThat jealousy was nothing compared to what he was feeling now. No matter what he did, no matter what he told himself, it wouldn’t go away. It tainted every emotion he felt. It made him angry, and he didn’t know how to stop it. He didn’t know how to stop loving Eddie.\n\nHe should’ve known he wouldn’t be able to control it forever.\n\nBuck didn’t hurt people. He was never quick to get angry or physical. If he was ever upset, the only person he ever hurt was himself. Whether he hurt himself by making himself the person that left instead of being left, whether he hurt himself by taking stinging showers or drinking more than he usually did, all his pain was self-inflicted. His whole life, he’d learned to implode rather than explode. He never let his shrapnel wound anyone that dared get close enough to him. He knew he would never forgive himself if he ever did.\n\nBut then he hurt Eddie during that stupid basketball game he only went to because of how jealous he was. He knocked Eddie to the ground on purpose—whether he was fully aware of it or not—and then heard his ankle snap.\n\nThat whole time Eddie laid on the ground as Chimney wrapped his ankle, he didn’t look at Buck once. He didn’t look back at him when Tommy led him to his car. That had to mean Eddie knew that Buck hit him on purpose, that he was angry that Buck actually hurt him.\n\nBuck couldn’t stop himself from imagining Eddie coming home from the urgent care in crutches or a boot and Christopher asking him what happened. Maybe for the first time in four years, Eddie would say Buck’s name and spit it out like it was poison. Maybe for the first time in four years, something had come between the three of them—their little, patchwork family—something that was no one’s fault but Buck’s.\n\nEverything was always his fault—that thought was worn into the floor of his loft as he paced around it all through the night. I did this to Eddie. I did this to Christopher. I did this to myself.\n\nHis loft was always too quiet, but it was a different kind of quiet as he finally decided to at least try and get some sleep. It was a lonely quiet, something that enveloped the room like a blanket. It was quiet like this that made him wonder if he really could be alone for the rest of his life, never have anyone who waited for him to come home every day.\n\nHe closed his eyes, tried to focus on the distant sound of L.A. traffic, tried to focus on his breathing. He was alive, he was loved, he was a good person, he deserved to sleep.\n\nBut every time he was moments away from fully falling asleep, he heard Eddie’s ankle snapping in his mind. It made him startle awake like he’d had a nightmare, forcing him to wrestle with sleep again, tossing and turning and trying to forget.\n\nHe didn’t know when he finally did fall asleep, when he was finally so tired from chasing his runaway train of thought that his body surrendered to the fatigue, but once darkness took him, he dreamt of dying.\n\nEverything was the same, just like it always was. It was storming. There was an apartment fire raging in front of them. Chimney was prepping to go up to the roof but Buck told him he’d take his place. He climbed the ladder, step by step. He never knew he was inching closer to his death in his dreams.\n\nThunder rolled above him. The clouds glowed a sickening blue. The air around him buzzed. Before he could blink, the clouds burst open, releasing a bolt of lightning. In its search for the quickest path to the ground, it struck Buck.\n\nThe lightning coursed through his body. The force knocked him off the ladder. His rope caught him as he fell. His heart was still beating. He was still awake.\n\nHe looked up and saw Eddie frantically climbing up the ladder, heard him call his name. Rainwater fell on his face, filling his nose and mouth. He felt a tingling sensation all through his body, like his bones were made of TV static. His chest was hollow.\n\nHe saw Eddie above him, leaning over the edge of the ladder and pulling on Buck’s rope with all his strength.\n\n“Buck!” Eddie shouted. “Can you hear me?”\n\nHe could, but it was like his throat was stuffed with cotton, and he couldn’t shout back at him. He lifted his hand and reached for him, his mouth forming the all-too-familiar shape of Eddie’s name, when he heard the unmistakable groan of a rope unraveling.\n\nTime didn’t slow down. The rope just snapped, and Buck was falling.\n\nHe startled awake before he hit the ground, but not before he heard Eddie scream.\n\nThe first rays of morning were filtering into his loft. He was pinned to his bed, sweat stinging his eyes and staining his mouth, his chest rising and falling so fast his head started to spin. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d died in one of his dreams.\n\nHis first thought as he stared at his ceiling, the adrenaline wearing off, was that it was awfully selfish of him to dream of his own death. Not that he chose to dream of it, not that he could change the scene like he could change clothes or the radio station, but something deep inside him opened up the wound so the memory would bleed into his brain.\n\nHe’d had countless nightmares about Eddie being buried alive or getting shot, about really losing Christopher in the tsunami, about something horrible happening to either or both of them that Buck’s mind could concoct a little too easily. His nightmares about the lightning strike were easier to shake off than those other nightmares were; his own death was easier to swallow than Eddie’s or Christopher’s.\n\nBut now that Buck was almost certain his relationship with both of them would never be the same again, he dreamt about falling somewhere Eddie wouldn’t be able to reach him. He dreamt about being the one who left, the one who died, instead of being the one stuck in their mourning forever.\n\nHis second thought was that, even after all this time, some part of him still believed he was better off dead.\n\nHe forced himself to sit up, forced his breathing to slow and deepen. He wished he could call Eddie. It was his oldest, strongest habit. They always had trouble sleeping at the same time, they always reached out to each other in their darkest moments.\n\nYou know I was ready to die in that fire, right? Buck said one night.\n\nI was ready to die the night I took a baseball bat to my bedroom wall. Eddie said a different night.\n\nBuck wondered if Eddie was asleep right now, if he was dreaming. He wondered if the image behind his eyelids was one of Buck wearing a snarl, a glint in his eye that Eddie wouldn’t recognize. He wondered if Eddie still had nightmares about the lightning strike.\n\nHe blinked when he heard a distant siren, his entire body straightening. Saltwater filled his lungs, warm blood splattered on his face, thunder clapped in his ears. He inhaled, then the moment passed.\n\nHe reached for his phone on his nightstand, and instead of calling Eddie, he texted Maddie and asked her if she was working today, and if he could bring her lunch once she was on break.\n\n…\n\nBuck had been avoiding taking a shower since the basketball game. Whenever he was upset, he always set the water as hot as he could bear, flinching and wincing through the burning until his body accustomed to it, until he went numb. He didn’t mind pain when he could control it, when he could shut the water off if it became too much for him. He’d gotten used to it after a childhood of reckless bicycle accidents, of broken limbs and bloody noses. Pain was a reward when he wanted it to be, and it was a punishment when he wanted it to be.\n\nHe stared at the showerhead for a moment, remembering the sensation of nearly boiling water pelting his skin. He closed his eyes, the past 24 hours flickering through his mind like a roll of film—Eddie lying on the ground, hearing Eddie scream in his nightmare, Maddie’s look of disappointment during their lunch when he told her what happened.\n\nHe opened his eyes. He didn’t want to punish himself anymore.\n\nHe turned the water on, keeping it set to cold.\n\nHe shivered as he stepped into the shower, but he let the water drench him, felt his heartbeat slow to a normal rhythm in his chest. He washed his hair, scrubbed soap into his skin, all while a lump was forming in his throat. His body was as big as it was. He was made of bones stacked together, veins stitched to each other, organs filling every empty space, skin and muscle stretched over his frame.\n\nHe'd had several moments like this since the lightning strike. Knowing that the body he lived in had been empty for three minutes and seventeen seconds was one he especially had trouble coping with. He knew Chimney was the first to perform CPR on him, and he knew Eddie was the one who got his heart beating again. He knew he had at least one broken rib when he woke up from his coma, and he always wondered whose hands had made it crack.\n\nMost times he was more aware of his body in his darker moments—when he woke up from his nightmares, whenever Natalia touched him, whenever his team, his family, looked at him a certain way.\n\nWith cold water washing over him, with his body coming into sharp focus, he felt human—despite his years-long battle with his own heart, despite potentially ruining everything for himself again.\n\nHe examined the feeling, of simply existing in his own body, then sat on the floor of his shower and cried, the icy water still falling over him.\n\nHe didn’t know why he was crying. Maybe it was because for the first time in over 24 hours he felt normal, like he’d finally been able to ignore the world around him, ignore his whole life leading up to this point. Maybe he finally felt like he was able to release all the emotion he’d been feeling, let himself mourn every lost opportunity, every mistake, every regret, every nightmare and sleepless night and panic attack and premature goodbye. Maybe he’d used all the time he needed to recover from hurting Eddie, and his body was sloughing off any excess guilt and shame and embarrassment.\n\nAll he knew was that by the time he’d run out of tears to cry, when he’d turned the water off, he could breathe a little more easily, that there was a slight weight off of his shoulders.\n\nHe stood in front of his mirror as he dried off, studying his face. His hair was curling and piling on top of his head, his birthmark was in the same place it always was, his eyes were red from crying, his lips were a little bit chapped.\n\nHe let his mind wander, add another figure in the reflection. He imagined Wyatt—sun-kissed skin, sun-bleached hair, dimples, warm eyes, putting on a blue checkered button-up, fixing the collar and rolling up the sleeves. Buck’s chest ached, just a little. A Montana sunset burned in the back of his mind.\n\nWhen he blinked, the image changed to Eddie—bedhead, bags under his eyes, wearing an old, white t-shirt and gray joggers, brushing his teeth and feeling a patch of stubble along his jaw. Buck’s chest filled with warmth, the same warmth he always felt around him, whether he was in love with him or not. Eddie belonged in this reflection. Buck missed him.\n\nHe leaned forward and turned on the faucet, splashing cold water on his face. He took a slow, deep breath, anchored himself against the sink.\n\nHe thought of the Buck who went to a bar after another argument with his parents because he didn’t believe he had a family anymore. He let himself wonder, for a moment, what would’ve happened if Silas hadn’t kissed him, hadn’t sent him into a panic attack that Maddie and Chimney had to bring him back down from. Maybe, if he welcomed worst-case scenarios, he never would’ve made it home that night. He never would’ve known about Daniel, he never would’ve met Jee and been her uncle, he never would’ve watched Eddie get shot and realized he was in love with him, he never would’ve gotten struck by a bolt of lightning that made his heart stop for three minutes and seventeen seconds—and he never would’ve gotten closer and closer to becoming Buck.\n\nI don’t even know what that means.\n\nThere was a part of him that still related to that admission, that still felt like the scared little boy he was three years ago. There was always going to be a part of him that questioned whether he was really loved, whether he was worthy of it or not. There were so many parts of him that could be picked apart, criticized, hated. He liked boys and girls. He was born to save his brother but his body betrayed both of them. He was so afraid of people leaving him that he would sacrifice literally anything they wanted him to make them stay. He was so loyal he forgot all the scars he had from a thousand betrayals and left himself open to be wounded again. He was so many things, and he was so close to discovering every part of himself.\n\nWhen Tommy Kinard showed up at his door later that night, he thought maybe—maybe—this was the final piece of some puzzle, and he just had to find a way to make it fit.\n\nHe let himself stare at Tommy as they talked, at the slope of his jaw, at the sparkle in his eyes and the way they crinkled when he smiled, at the way his shirt fit over his muscles. Tommy reminded him of the boys he played football with in high school, of the rigid, disciplined men he met when he tried to get into the SEALS, of Eddie. Tommy was handsome, rugged, strong, someone Buck could fall in love with.\n\nHe felt a familiar floating feeling in his chest as his heartbeat quickened. He would take a step closer to Tommy, then Tommy would take a step closer, too. He would smile at Tommy, and Tommy would smile back. The conversation was cordial, the air was clearing between them.\n\nBuck should’ve noticed a pattern was repeating again. Every time he found himself close to a boy, every time he let himself notice how handsome they were, they were always doing the same thing to him. They always kissed him first, sweeping him off his feet for a moment until reality kicked in, until he remembered who he was and who he was supposed to love.\n\nStill, when Tommy cut him off mid-sentence to lift his chin and kiss him, Buck was caught completely by surprise.\n\nHe was frozen at first, his heart climbing up his throat. The last person he’d kissed was Natalia when they were sitting out on his patio, covered in sunlight and ruffled by a cool breeze. It felt like such a long time ago, when he could still see the faintest traces of his scar from the lightning strike, when his brain was still slightly rewired and functioned like a calculator. He wasn’t sure him and Natalia would last forever, if the Buck he was when he woke up from his coma could love her for the rest of his life. But he was willing to try.\n\nNow, he was in his kitchen, the city lights shining outside, and Tommy was kissing him. He wanted Tommy to keep kissing him. But he couldn’t quite make himself kiss him back.\n\nAs Tommy deepened the kiss, Buck reached to put his hand on his shoulder, but he still hesitated. He could just feel the fabric of Tommy’s shirt beneath his thumb, and that smallest of touches made his heart beat harder, faster.\n\nI could kiss him back, he thought. For the first time in his life, he didn’t feel the urge to flinch, to push Tommy away. For the first time in his life, he didn’t hear his father’s voice in the back of his mind, didn’t taste blood or whiskey in his mouth.\n\nBut before he could, Tommy pulled away, and he was scared to breathe, like time had stopped and it would start again once he exhaled.\n\nHe stared at Tommy, his mouth hanging open, his heart hammering in his chest, tears brimming in his eyes. He could still feel the kiss on the tip of his tongue, in the pit of his stomach. He could still feel Tommy’s hand beneath his chin, soft and gentle.\n\nIf Tommy was a girl, if Buck was an older version of himself, he would’ve grabbed Tommy by the collar of his shirt and kissed him as hard as he could, until their emotions were heightened enough that they wound up upstairs in Buck’s bed, their bodies nothing but skin and heartbeats and breath.\n\nBut Buck was smiling, staring at Tommy’s lips, reveling in the feeling of kissing a boy and not feeling an ounce of guilt for it afterwards. After almost thirty years, his heart didn’t feel like a parasite in his chest.\n\nHe let himself exhale, let time keep marching on in a world where he could love a boy.\n\n“You still owe me that beer,” Tommy told him, holding back a smile. “You free?”\n\n“Yes,” Buck answered, grinning. “I am free.”\n\nThe words meant so many things, carried so much weight, but he felt weightless saying them out loud.\n\n“So, let’s say I come by around,” Tommy said, shrugging. “I don’t know, 8?”\n\nBuck nodded. “Y-yeah, 8 is great.”\n\n“Great,” Tommy replied, smiling back at Buck and heading for the door. “See you Saturday. And, for God’s sake, please call Eddie. Now would be a good time. He’s on pain pills.”\n\nTommy laughed as he left, and the quiet that filled Buck’s loft once the door closed behind him was like no other quiet Buck had heard before. It reminded him of the quiet before the lightning strike, the quiet before Eddie got shot. He couldn’t quite tell if it was tense or not, if he was about to fall off the edge of a cliff or finally take flight.\n\nHe sighed as he leaned against the bar, letting his eyes close. He imagined lips on his again, hands on his face and arms, hips slotting against his. He heard the whisper of fabric brushing against fabric, lips meeting and breaking apart.\n\nThen something invaded the fantasy. Cinnamon, coffee, lavender, aftershave. Dinner cooking on the stove, laundry hanging from a clothesline, laughter in the living room.\n\nA voice started whispering in the back of his mind, saying his name, over and over again in different tones. Panicked, angry, pleading, loving.\n\nA different name began humming through his bloodstream, sitting on the tip of his tongue.\n\nEddie.\n\nHis breath came tumbling out of him like he’d been punched in the stomach. He swore he heard Eddie laughing, a residual from the memories and fantasies he’d been playing in his mind. He swore that, even if the memory wasn’t mocking him, Eddie was.\n\nIt had always been Eddie. It was always going to be Eddie. But only ever in Buck’s heart.\n\nHe opened his eyes, looked around his loft. Where he was standing right now was where he stood when Eddie put his hand on his shoulder and told him there was no one he trusted with Christopher more than him. In the living room was where him and Eddie and Christopher have played video games for hours on end. In the kitchen was where they drank beers and talked about their girlfriends, about Christopher, about their parents. On the patio was where Eddie told Buck that he was the guy who wanted to fix things while he was icing a black eye.\n\nEddie was all over this apartment, all over Buck.\n\nTears filled his eyes again as he realized that even though he finally kissed a boy and wouldn’t spend the rest of the night hating himself, he was still wanting to kiss someone else. Nothing was ever good enough for him, not even Tommy.\n\nHe wasn’t thinking when he grabbed his car keys off the counter, when he drove halfway across town to get to Eddie’s house. All he could focus on was the sound of Eddie’s ankle snapping—a sound he’d memorized by now—and the way his heartbeat was pulsing in his fingertips as he gripped the steering wheel.\n\nIf Tommy was willing to love him, if he was willing to love Tommy, he wasn’t going to let himself sabotage another chance at love again. He would apologize to Eddie for hurting him, reassure him that nothing like that would ever happen again. They would stay best friends, they would still have movie nights and dinners, they would still raise Christopher together. Buck could love Tommy, and Eddie could love Marisol. Buck would live the rest of his life without ever knowing what it was like to kiss who his heart loved most, but he could forget that if he could kiss someone he loved just a little less. He would do anything as long as the peace wouldn’t be disturbed.\n\nThe streets were quiet as Buck drove, just barely out of reach of the city lights. Everything had a rosy glow to it, like a sunset, even though night had long since fallen. He had his music turned down as he thought of what he would say to Eddie, if he should have a big, long speech ready at all.\n\nTommy’s a really cool guy, I know that. You have a lot in common with him. I’m glad you two are getting along and hanging out and everything. I just miss when it was just you and me, you know? And I know that’s selfish, and I shouldn’t have let myself get so jealous that I hurt you. I should’ve talked to you sooner. I should’ve done a lot of things differently.\n\nAs he turned onto Eddie’s street, his thoughts began to wander.\n\nYou should know something. Tommy was at my apartment earlier and he kissed me. And I liked it. I’ve kissed other guys before and liked it. I should’ve told you that sooner, too, it’s just that… Kissing Tommy was the first time a guy kissed me and I didn’t spiral out afterwards. I know you and Tommy are really good friends, and you and me are best friends, and this is probably gonna get our little web all tangled up, but I really like him, you know?\n\nHe parked a little ways down from Eddie’s house, where he could still see it in his side mirror. He exhaled slowly, popped his knuckles.\n\nThe lights were on in the house. It was a Friday, so maybe Eddie and Christopher were up playing video games if Eddie was feeling up to it. Maybe Buck could stay for a while and spend time with both of them, feel like everything was normal again.\n\nHe reached to pull his keys out of the ignition, but he hesitated. He curled his hand into a fist, let it rest on his thigh. He should really think about what he’d say to Eddie a little more, make sure it’s a genuine apology.\n\nDo you remember your first shift? How jealous I was of you? I’ve been feeling that but, like, ten times worse. We’ve gotten so close since you joined the 118, and it was just strange when we met Tommy and we weren’t hanging out as much, you know? That’s not an excuse for what I did to you, I was way out of line, and I hope you know that I feel awful about it. I mean, I convinced myself you were gonna hate me. I know that’s dumb, but in the moment, I really believed it. I’m sorry I almost ruined our friendship. I promise I won’t let my own jealousy get in the way again.\n\nHe was snapped out of his reverie when headlights appeared behind him. His brow furrowed as he watched a car pull into Eddie’s driveway, then his stomach dropped when he saw Marisol step out of it. She pulled a few grocery bags and a duffel from her trunk before walking up to the front door. He couldn’t see if it was Eddie or Christopher who let her in, but his spirit wilted when he watched her enter the house.\n\nHis breath started quickening. How was he supposed to go in there now, interrupt her arrival, keep her from settling in so he could have a private conversation with Eddie? What if Eddie really was mad at him and blew up at him when he saw him, and Marisol saw all of it? What if the conversation went well, but Marisol could tell that Buck was in love with Eddie? What if she felt threatened and told Eddie and Eddie got upset at Buck again and everything actually, finally fell apart?\n\nBut what about Tommy? What about more kisses in Buck’s kitchen, beers on Saturday nights, calling each other their boyfriend, fitting in that last piece of the puzzle that was Buck’s heart? What about flying lessons, Muay Thai sessions, maybe even karaoke bar trivia? What if the universe really was giving him someone who could play the role of soulmate’s understudy? What if he let himself add Tommy’s name to a list of boys he’d kissed then left behind before they could blink?\n\nWhat if, either way, he was just unlovable? Maybe he’d used what his father told him when he was five years old as a shield all these years. He had an excuse not to let himself fall in love with a boy, when, at the end of the day, none of it mattered because love would always be something that was taken away from him.\n\nHe remembered the day he desperately wanted to kiss Eddie, a terrible nausea settling in his stomach as he thought that maybe he wouldn’t be as miserable as he was right now if he had kissed him. At least their friendship would’ve ended there. At least Buck would’ve known what Eddie tasted like, let that memory replace the taste of Eddie’s blood. At least he would’ve felt like he had a single goddamn ounce of courage for once in his life.\n\nHe put his car in drive as tears filled his eyes. He could visit Eddie in the morning. He could survive another sleepless night. He could survive another nightmare, if one came to him before the sun rose. He could survive another day in his own body, in his own mind. He could survive until he’d truly lost everything, and that hadn’t happened yet.\n\nHe drove down Eddie’s street, circled the cul-de-sac, then began his drive home. He swore the lighting changed from that rosy hue to the same electric, sickening blue the clouds were the night he was struck by lightning. He choked back a sob, turned his music back up.\n\nThis wouldn’t be the first time his heart loved two people at once. He was terrified it wouldn’t be the last."
