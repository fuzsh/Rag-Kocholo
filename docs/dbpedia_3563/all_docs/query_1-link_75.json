        "text": "\"No one listens to an album all the way through anymore\" — that's what someone in the music business told us the other day.\n\nDamn, y'all. If that's the truth, let this year's Best Southern Albums list be our testimony.\n\nWe've played these 20 records, in their entirety, over and over and over. In fact, if someday the 10th year of The Bitter Southerner is made into a movie, McKendrick Bearden's \"Bright as the Mines Out\" will be our soundtrack. In \"Shoulder of Joy\" McKendrick sings, \"It's a long long time together ... It's been a long long time.\"\n\nHere's to 10 more!\n\nOn our list this year, you'll see some of your favorite artists, a couple of cool departure albums, more than a few newcomers, and what we think is a masterpiece in our #1 spot. There's Americana, hip-hop, club music, country, indie folk, jazz, punk and Korean rap. These artists lean into some intense ’50s, ’70s, and ’90s vibes. So put in your earbuds, turn up the volume, and maybe, for a few minutes (as Paramore screams with The Linda Lindas on track #2 of \"Re: This Is Why\"), turn off the news.\n\nListen to these records — yes, all the way through. And let your hearts be light.\n\nHome: Atlanta\n\nFavorite Track: “I Swear, I Really Wanted to Make a ‘Rap’ Album But This Is Literally the Way the Wind Blew Me This Time”\n\nThe unpredictable genius of Atlanta’s André 3000 has brought us his first solo album in 17 years, and although the more perceptive among us may have seen the videos of André wandering Atlanta with a large flute, no one expected this. Eight songs, with ironic, hilarious, and bizarre titles that seem more fitting for an early-2000s post-rock outfit, each one an entirely instrumental flute track. Beneath the somewhat goofy titles, though, are ambient, harmonically complex songs that aren’t afraid to linger, taking inspiration from Japanese New Age as well as artists like Laraaji, Pharoah Sanders, and Steve Reich. Sonically, it also draws comparisons to contemporaries like Colin Stetson and Nicholas Britell.\n\nThere’s something very enlightening about this album with respect to the world of popular music. Although André is no stranger to following his muse, it’s delightful to see it break through in such a concrete way, at a time when it seems popular music is dominated by repetition.\n\nHome: Charlotte\n\nFavorite Track: “Closure”\n\nCharlotte native Sean Mason has been immersed in a world of music from the beginning. He recalled his grandmother dancing in his youth, Ray Charles and Duke Ellington records ruling the house. It’s no surprise, then, that when Mason started piano at the age of 13, it would become a lifelong passion, eventually culminating in study at Juilliard and his debut album, The Southern Suite. A harmonically complex yet lyrical album, The Southern Suite allows Mason to flex his extensive talent and skill as a composer, while retaining all the beauty. There’s a lyrical nature to the album that’s undeniable, even without the human voice. He speaks through his instrument, and invites others to join, too, as he reflects on his family and his upbringing in the South.\n\nHe honors his aforementioned grandmother in his music, as well as his hometown. There’s also a fair bit of polyphonic melody throughout, which Mason attributes to his love of New Orleans and its place in the jazz pantheon.\n\nHome: Athens, Georgia\n\nFavorite Track: “Shoulder of Joy”\n\nAthens’ McKendrick Bearden has become a local favorite among the ranks here, thanks to his wonderful exploration into the world of home recording. Bearden cut his teeth as a member of two local bands, Grand Vapids and Heffner, but it wasn’t until COVID-19 forced him into isolation that he began considering the idea of a solo record. The result is much more than your typical pandemic foray. There’s a heavy dose of atmospheric folkiness to many of the songs in the album, as well as some inventive recording techniques and a dash of shoegaze.\n\nThere’s an undeniable beauty that shines in this album as McKendrick picks through his complicated relationship with the last two years.\n\nHome: Nashville\n\nFavorite Track: “Cherie Vico”\n\nThe Ivory Coast was tuned in to Peter One’s pastoral, multilingual music long before he gained traction in the United States. Though he, along with the other half of his duo, Jess Sah-Bing, played stadiums and performed for the nation’s president, One moved to the U.S. in 1995 to escape rising political tensions and became a nurse. Now a Nashville resident, One’s first new album after 30 years away from the spotlight captures the jubilation and tribulation of the human experience. The songs span three languages: English, French, and his native Guro, an artistic choice designed to foster unity. Tracks like “Cherie Vico” and “Kavudu” serve as calls for peace, both inner and outer. “Birds Go Die Out of Sight” is a haunting, bluesy song about a friend who left the United States to return to the Ivory Coast, where he was caught in the political violence and killed. One’s music has been compared to that of Paul Simon, and while it’s not entirely inaccurate, there’s something more subtly grand in the music of the soft-spoken Nashvillian.\n\nHome: Atlanta\n\nFavorite Track: “I Can’t Hush”\n\nIt’s difficult to explain the message that folk artist and musician Lonnie Holley is transmitting through the medium of his found-object sculptures and his music, but it is mysterious, delightful, and deeply immersive. Born in 1950 in Birmingham as one of 27 children, Holley’s upbringing was exceedingly difficult: He discovered his artistic abilities when he was tasked with carving the headstones of his sister’s children, was pronounced brain-dead after being hit by a car, and served time at the infamous Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children.\n\nIt wasn’t until 2012, though, that Holley began releasing the improvisational and consciousness-shifting music he has become known for. Oh Me Oh My transports the listener with lush instrumental arrangements by Holley, with support from Sharon Van Etten, Michael Stipe, Bon Iver, and others. The lyrics, like Holley himself, take a roundabout course to their meaning, but when his point finally lands, it’s all the more impactful.\n\nHome: Atlanta\n\nFavorite Track: “Scientists & Engineers”\n\nKiller Mike is an Atlanta icon, from his breakout as a featured artist on Outkast’s Stankonia, to his work with New York producer El-P as one half of Run the Jewels. It’s been 11 years since Mike’s last solo album, R.A.P. Music, defined him as a formidable lyricist and critically lauded artist, and now he’s back with a hard-hitting, 18-track LP featuring a laundry list of Southern talent.\n\nMike has never been one to back away from confrontation, whether in his life as a political activist or an artist, and the tracks on Michael retain his characteristic roughness. As the album progresses, though, it becomes clear that the things he raps about over the gospel-heavy tracks come from a somewhat wiser Mike. There’s an element of retrospection, and certainly plenty of introspection, as Mike looks down from the summit of his career, reflecting on family, loss, and life as a Black man in America."
