New features allow you to specify more details about your work schedule: from where you’re working (remotely or in the office) and whether you work different hours on different days. In addition, you can schedule meetings with others based on their work location, view the work location on people’s profile card, and see your out of office time reflected in your location.\n\nNote: Work location isn't used to track employees. Individuals’ work location data is aggregated and anonymized to understand office occupation trends.\n\nLegacy work hours\n\nThis new experience replaces the legacy work hours experience, but legacy work hours will continue to be supported. Because the legacy experience supports only a single start time and end time for the entire work week, the legacy work hours will approximate the modern work hours and location.\n\nFor example, a user sets up the following schedule using the new work hours and location: Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays: 8:00 am - 5:00 pm & Wednesdays, Fridays: 10:00am - 7:00 pm. The times for their legacy work hours will be configured to the best approximation (8:00 am to 7:00 pm) – the minimum start time and maximum end time of the modern work hours.\n\nUntil a user sets up modern working hours, changes to legacy working hours will also update the times in their modern working hours. However, once a user sets up (or updates) their modern working hours, future changes to legacy working hours will not propagate and overwrite the modern working hours.\n\nThe exception to this rule is working hours time zone. Whenever the legacy working hours time zone changes, it will update the time zone for the modern working hours. This ensures that others can view accurate availability if someone on a legacy client travels across time zones."
