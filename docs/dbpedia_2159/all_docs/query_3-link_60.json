        "text": "Use a musical term for your music brand name\n\nThere are so many musical terms out there that would make catchy music company names. For example, take something as simple as “Allegro” or “Staccato.” They work perfectly as standalone business names, or you can add “Music Shop” or the specific type of product you sell. With this name idea, your target audience will immediately know what your business is about. They know music, and you obviously do, too.\n\nChoose a punny music company name that will make your customers smile\n\nCrack a joke with your business name by using a pun. Not only will it immediately appeal to music lovers, it’s a great way to stay top of mind for those in the music community. Your punny music name could be something like “Cello There.” This is the time to let your creativity show. Try typing a keyword into the music store name generator for additional pun-spiration.\n\nNiche down into a specific part of music, and include that in your brand name\n\nAs you’re starting up your new music store, you’ll likely start out by focusing on a particular niche, like sheet music, stringed instruments, or accessories. If this is the route you choose to go, you may want to incorporate that niche into your store name. For example, you might choose “Woodwinds Depot” for a shop focusing on woodwinds, “Gold Keys” for a piano store, or “Guitar Strings Shop” for a guitar store.\n\nSelect a music store name that is easy to spell and pronounce\n\nIf you’re running ads, whether on the radio, TV, or social media, you need to make it easy for listeners or viewers to come back to your business. This is also key for word-of-mouth marketing. When you choose a music store name that’s too abstract, you’re making it harder for people to find you. The easier it is to pronounce and spell your name, the easier it will be to look your business up online. As you begin the naming process, browse through our name ideas below, or use the music store name generator with the click of a button."
