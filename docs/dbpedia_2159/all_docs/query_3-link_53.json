If anyone claiming to be affiliated with UMG fraudulently demands money from you to submit a demo, or as a purported “contract fee” or to defray “travel costs,” please be aware that this is a scam. You can report these individuals to us here.\n\nI am a company or brand looking to partner with a Universal Music Group label or artist.
