        "text": "A songwriter is someone who applies their creative talent to the creation of musical works, writing the music, and sometimes also the lyrics, usually in a popular music style (e.g., rock, country, hip hop, pop). A composer is someone who applies their creative talent to the creation of musical works, composing the music, usually in a classical or jazz musical style. A lyricist is someone who applies their creative talent to the creation of musical works, writing the lyrics, across many styles of music including musical theater.\n\nA shorthand way of referring collectively to songwriters, composers, and lyricists is to refer to them as writers. Writers may be the sole creator of a musical work or may collaborate with other others in its creation. A writer may also be a recording artist.\n\nCopyright is a form of protection granted by law for original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression. In the U.S. and in most other countries, a musical work, fixed in a system of music notation or on paper, or in a recording may be protected under copyright law. A sound recording may separately be protected under copyright law. Copyright protection applies to both musical works and sound recordings that have been made available to the public or kept unavailable. For more information on copyright in the U.S., visit https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/.\n\nSongwriters, composers, and lyricists are “self-administered” if they have retained the right to register any of their own musical works with The MLC AND collect their own mechanical royalties either directly or through a business manager, accountant, lawyer, or other representative/agent.\n\nSongwriters, composers, and lyricists who have assigned their rights to register their musical works and collect their mechanical royalties in the United States to a music publisher or publishing administrator, do not need to become a Member of The MLC. Their publisher or publishing administrator will handle the collection and registration. If a songwriter, composer, or lyricist works with a music publisher or publishing administrator in any capacity, they should check with that music publisher or publishing administrator before becoming a Member of The MLC.\n\nDigital service providers may provide one or more of these types of user experiences to consumers of their services:\n\nInteractive Stream: A digital transmission of a sound recording where the consumer has control over which sound recording to stream and in what order to stream it. An example of this is the user experience offered by Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nPermanent Download: A digital transmission of a sound recording in the form of a download, where the consumer has unlimited control over how many times to access it. An example of this are the recordings available for download in the iTunes Store.\n\nLimited Download: A digital transmission of a sound recording where the consumer has limited control over either the length of time or the number of times they can access it. An example of this are the recordings available for off-line access by Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nNon-Interactive Stream: A digital transmission of a sound recording where the consumer has limited control over which sound recording to stream, in what order it appears, and how many times to stream it, similar to a radio broadcast.\n\nThe MLC grants licenses to, and collects and distributes royalties from, digital service providers for interactive streams, limited downloads, and permanent downloads. The MLC does not grant licenses to, nor collects royalties from, digital service providers for non-interactive streams.\n\nA mechanical license is permission to reproduce and distribute a musical work in the form of a physical or digital phonorecord. An example of a physical phonorecord is a sound recording on a CD or vinyl record. Examples of digital phonorecords are sound recordings delivered as interactive streams, limited downloads, or permanent downloads. If a musical work is protected by copyright law, its unauthorized reproduction and distribution is copyright infringement.\n\nA mechanical license may be obtained through a voluntarily negotiated license between the party requesting the license and the party granting it, or through the use of a “compulsory” license. Section 115 of the U.S. Copyright Act establishes a compulsory license (sometime also called a “statutory license”), and if certain conditions are met, it means that the party wishing to obtain a license is granted one as a matter of law, regardless of what the copyright owner wants, so long as they comply with the rules set forth in the law regarding the operation of the license. The law establishes eligibility requirements and obligations.\n\nMechanical licenses require the payment of mechanical royalties to the copyright owner or administrator of a musical work. In the case of a voluntarily negotiated license, the royalty rate is negotiated. In the case of a compulsory license, the rate is set by the Copyright Royalty Board (known as the CRB), a three-judge panel within the U.S. Library of Congress.\n\nFor more information on the compulsory mechanical license for making and distributing physical phonorecords, read the Copyright Office circular found at https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ73a.pdf.\n\nThe blanket license that is administered by The MLC is a compulsory license that allows DSPs to make and distribute digital phonorecords of every musical work that is eligible for a compulsory mechanical license, provided that the DSP pays royalties for its uses of musical works and complies with various requirements, such as to report detailed information on what works were used. A DSP only needs to secure one mechanical license, the blanket compulsory mechanical license, instead of securing a license on a musical work share-by-share basis.\n\nA public performance license is permission to perform a work at a place open to the public or where a substantial number of people outside of a normal circle of family and friends is gathered. It includes transmitting or broadcasting the work, whether the members of the public are capable of receiving the performance receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times. The MLC is not involved in public performance licenses or royalties.\n\nPublic performance licenses for the performance of musical works are generally granted by performing rights organizations, like ASCAP, BMI, AllTrack, SESAC, and GMR, as blanket licenses. These organizations collect performance royalties from entities responsible for presenting the performance, such as radio stations, night clubs, and digital service providers, and pay them on to songwriters, composers, lyricists, and music publishers.\n\nPublic performance licenses for the performance of sound recordings via digital transmission are generally granted as compulsory licenses under section 114 of the U.S. copyright law. These licenses are administered by SoundExchange, which also collects royalties from non-interactive digital service providers (including webcasters and satellite radio) and pays them on to artists and sound recording copyright owners.\n\nThe Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act (MMA) of 2018 or ‘Music Modernization Act’ for short, is the most significant piece of copyright legislation in decades and updates our current laws to reflect modern consumer preferences and technological developments in the music marketplace. The law is organized into three key titles: Title I—Musical Works Modernization Act; Title II—Classics Protection and Access Act; and Title III—Allocation for Music Producers Act.\n\nTitle I of the Act, the Musical Works Modernization Act, replaces the existing work-by-work compulsory licensing structure for making and distributing musical works with a blanket licensing system for digital music providers to make and distribute digital phonorecord deliveries (e.g., permanent downloads, limited downloads, or interactive streams). It also establishes a mechanical licensing collective to administer the blanket license, and a digital licensee coordinator to coordinate the activities of the licensees and designate a representative to serve as a non-voting member on the board of the collective.\n\nFor more information, visit the MMA page on the Copyright Office website.\n\nA musical work is in the public domain if it is no longer under copyright protection or if it failed to meet the requirements for copyright protection. Works in the public domain may be used freely without the permission of the former copyright owner. Musical works in the public domain may be reproduced and distributed as a phonorecord without the need for mechanical licenses and royalties. Determining if a musical work is in the public domain is often complicated. For help in finding the answer, explore these resources:\n\nCopyright Office circular on the duration of copyright protection: https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.pdf\n\nPublic Domain Information Project: https://www.pdinfo.com/\n\nThe MLC uses the term “unmatched royalties” to refer to royalties for musical works where The MLC has not yet matched the data for a particular sound recording use (reported by DSPs) to a musical work in The MLC’s musical works database.\n\nThe MLC uses the term “historical unmatched royalties” to refer to unmatched royalties that relate to uses of musical works prior to January 1, 2021. Click here to visit our dedicated Historical Unmatched Royalties page for more information.\n\nThe MLC uses the term “unclaimed royalties” to refer to royalties that it has been able to match to a musical work in its musical works database, but where less than 100% of the ownership shares for that matched musical work have been claimed by a Member of The MLC. For example, if only 80% of a matched musical work has been claimed, the remaining 20% is unclaimed, and The MLC refers to royalties associated with that unclaimed share as “unclaimed royalties.”"
