        "text": "Description:\n\nCampers will receive comprehensive instruction on recording techniques, including mic technique, signal flow, and sonic shaping both in studio and live applications. Campers will also learn aspects of traditional music production and budgeting as applied to today’s rapidly changing industry. Students should have at least a rudimentary understanding of recording equipment and be familiar with basic audio terminology (i.e., microphone, compression, reverb, etc.).\n\nSubmission Requirements:\n\nSubmit two music and/or video selections as MP3s YouTube or SoundCloud links of projects you have recorded and/or mixed either in a recording or live performance setting. You must provide a brief yet detailed description of what you did and how you did it for each selection (i.e., recorded, mixed, equipment used, location, etc.).\n\nDescription\n\nThis Career Track is open to students that want to move their music creation and production skills to a more advanced level. Participants will learn state-of-the-art methods of programming, editing, sampling, and mixing on digital audio workstations to help further develop their original compositions. This Career Track will also expose Campers to innovative techniques in digital music production, remixing, and sound manipulation.\n\nSubmission Requirements\n\nTwo examples in MP3 format of music you have created using computer-based platforms (with or without the addition of live instruments). You must provide a brief yet detailed description of what you did and how you did it for each selection (i.e., recorded, mixed, equipment used, location, etc.).\n\nDescription\n\nAspiring songwriters will sharpen the skills of their craft while exploring song structure, harmony, melody, lyric writing, and (where applicable) vocal technique. This track will also provide Campers with the opportunity to collaborate with a band, singers, and other songwriters. They will also gain valuable insight on sound business practices including effective marketing. This Career Track does not require you to be a singer. However, you should have a rudimentary understanding of music theory, and having some keyboard or guitar performance abilities is highly recommended.\n\nSubmission Requirements\n\nVideo of you or someone else singing two of your original compositions. If someone else is performing, you must make an on-camera introduction of each song and the performer(s). All songs must be written solely by you. Please upload your video to YouTube and submit your link(s). You are encouraged to submit lyric sheets with your songs and/or put the lyrics in the YouTube description.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Vocal Performance track is primarily for singers who desire to pursue an artist path in the music industry and/or wish to work as professional vocalists in some capacity (session singer, background vocalist, etc.) If you are a singer/songwriter, you should also consider applying for the Songwriting track. Campers will spend their time learning about the many different aspects of a vocalist that must be developed to have a successful, sustainable career in the industry, taking the vocalist beyond simply singing well and diving deeply into other essential skills. These include caring for and protecting the voice, developing better relational skills for collaboration, overcoming performance anxiety, increasing business savvy, and identifying ways to up-level musicianship. This track provides Campers with the opportunity to collaborate with the instrumental combos as well as create original material with the songwriting track.\n\nSubmission Requirements\n\nVideo of you singing two songs of differing styles and/or tempos in the following genres – pop, country, R&B, rock, soul, hip hop, gospel, etc. One jazz selection is fine but please do not submit musical theater or classical songs. Announce the title and artist who originally performed the song before you sing each song. Performance with live or recorded accompaniment is strongly recommended (a cappella performances are not advised). Important: we recommend that you do not use professional studio audio in your recording. Simply use the mic on your phone or whatever you are using to capture your video– we want to hear a raw, (untuned and unprocessed) vocal as that tells us the most about your singing. Please upload your video to YouTube and submit your link(s). You are encouraged to submit lyric sheets with your songs and/or put the lyrics in the YouTube description.\n\nIf audio is recorded with a DAW (a digital audio workstation like Logic, Garageband, ProTools, etc.), no processing of pitch and/or time is acceptable. A bare minimum of effects (reverb, delay, compression, etc.) is strongly encouraged as well.\n\nDescription\n\nCampers will learn how music relates to and influences media through visual and written storytelling across traditional and digital outlets. Hands-on learning of different mediums, platforms, and techniques, emphasizing current video production, social media, and multi-media pipelines with state-of-the-art technology. They will create a short-form project, telling the story of GRAMMY Camp while learning the entire production process from inception to delivery. This includes storytelling, pre-production best practices (writing, planning, storyboarding, and scheduling), comprehensive production techniques (camera, lighting, interview techniques, and sound recording), and current post-production solutions (editing, motion graphics, color correction, and delivery). Campers will also learn firsthand how to collaborate with other songwriters, musicians, and stakeholders to create a finished product.\n\nSubmission Requirements\n\nSubmit two projects you have created (video, written, or social media) that relate to music somehow. It does NOT have to be a music video. You must provide a brief but detailed description of what you did on each project and how you did it (e.g., performer, producer, director, writer, editor, camera operator, sound mixer, animator, etc.) Also, list what equipment and software you used to create it. Please upload your video to YouTube and submit your link(s).\n\nDescription\n\nThere are many careers in music that make the success of an artist possible. This Career Track will explore the inner workings of the music business including marketing, management, touring, concert production, publicity, entertainment law, and entrepreneurship in this ever-changing industry. Students should have a passion for exploring the non-performance roles on an artist’s team and a basic knowledge of the current music industry.\n\nSubmission Requirements\n\nPlease submit a brief (2-6 sentences) written response to each of the following\n\nPick an artist that you would like to work with. Describe what role you would like to play on their team (management, PR, marketing, live event production, legal, etc.) and how you would approach that position.\n\nPick a person, a music company, and/or a website that you feel has had an impact on the music industry and explain how.\n\nPlease upload answers to these two prompts. Video response submissions are also allowed, but answers should be prepared and recited (no rambling responses).\n\nPlease perform with a band, making sure you are clearly heard in the mix, or with recorded or programmed accompaniment. If you must perform unaccompanied, you must perform with a “click” (a metronome). Please demonstrate your abilities both “comping” (accompanying) and soloing. Drummers – please ensure the camera angle shows your entire body so we can see both of your hands and posture while playing.\n\nPlease perform with a band, making sure you are clearly heard in the mix, or with recorded or programmed accompaniment.
