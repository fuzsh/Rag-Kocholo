        "text": "John Lincoln Wright and The Sour Mash Boys were New England’s signature country-rock band for over 30 years, until Wright’s death in 2012. Founded in 1973, the group cut its teeth in the boisterous clubs of Harvard Square – King’s (later Jonathan Swift’s), the Oxford Alehouse, Performance Center I and II, Bunratty’s across the river – and many of the suburban clubs and lounges throughout the six-state region.\n\nThey also appeared regularly at O’Lunney’s and The Lone Star in New York City and The Chickenbox on Nantucket, and were a wildly popular opening act, warming up audiences for Waylon Jennings, Jerry Lee Lewis, Willie Nelson, Townes Van Zandt, Duke Robillard, Emmylou Haris, Del McCoury and The J. Geils Band, among others\n\nFOUNDING, REPERTOIRE, TIMING, SOUND\n\nGrowing up in Maine, Wright had always been a fan of country music. When his proto-rock late-‘60s band The Beacon Street Union collapsed in the wake of MGM Records’ failed Bosstown Sound promotion, he decided to follow his heart and, with nothing to lose, take his chances on the music he loved. He assembled The Sour Mash Boys, known as a “drinking band,” and the group amassed a large, rowdy following, working steadily through the ‘70s and well into the 21st century.\n\nAbove all else, the Sour Mash Boys were a New England band, in particular a Cambridge band. When the possibility of moving the group to roots-rock haven Austin, Texas came up, Wright nixed it immediately in a clear reflection of his tenacious New England identity. The band’s repertoire combined Wright’s original songs with covers of tunes by Waylon Jennings, Tom T. Hall, Bob Wills, Hank Williams, Gram Parsons, The Grateful Dead and other iconic roots-driven artists.\n\nWright’s timing in forming the band couldn’t have been better; The Sour Mash Boys hit the Boston-area club scene just as country rock was beginning to take off as part of the national vogue and the group he assembled – with its distinct rock roots – offered a new brand of country that was gritty, urban, eclectic and perfectly suited to Harvard Square’s youthful club scene. Each band member’s prior experience had been almost entirely in rock groups, which brought an attitude to their stage presence – the anarchy and irreverence characteristic of ‘60s and ‘70s rockers – and a hard, take-no-prisoners edge to their sound. It was something you never heard in Nashville at the time; it wasn’t until years later that electrified rock bands become standard in Music City.\n\nORIGINAL LINEUP, LATER PERSONNEL, LEGACY\n\nThe original lineup was Wright on vocals, John McDonald on lead guitar and vocals, Ed Hughes on drums, Ray Jacques on bass and Bill Henderson on electric violin. The one player with any actual country experience was 19-year-old John Macy on pedal steel, who’d played in bands in Lubbock, Texas.\n\nOver time, there were many personnel changes. Within the first year, Kevin Lillis replacing Jacques on bass, Dave Kinsman took over on the drums and George Heath joining on guitar and banjo. McDonald and Henderson left after three years, followed by George Nelson and Larry Feldman on lead guitar and fiddle respectively. Steve Morse of The Boston Globe reported that the total number of musicians over the decades exceeded 100 and included two women.\n\nThe one constant was John Lincoln Wright, whose authentic approach to all forms of American country, talent as a songwriter and performer and ground-breaking rock ‘n’ roll credentials made him the perfect man to popularize country rock for several generations of young, hip, rock-oriented music lovers. John Lincoln Wright and The Sour Mash Boys introduced what became known as “Americana” to an entire generation (or two) of New Englanders.\n\n(by Bill Henderson)"
