        "text": "Why is that so Funny?\n\nA practical investigation of how comedy works, by a well-respected practitioner and teacher. With a Foreword by Toby Jones.\n\nComedy is recognised as one of the most problematic areas of performances. For that reason, it is rarely written about in any systematic way. John Wright, founder of Trestle Theatre and Told by an Idiot, brings a wide range of experience of physical comedy to this unique exploration of comedy and comedic techniques.\n\nThe book opens with an analysis of the different kinds of laughter that can be provoked by performance. This is followed by the main part of the book: games and exercises devised to demonstrate and investigate the whole range of comic possibilities open to a performer.\n\nWhy Is That So Funny? is an invaluable book for teachers and performers, and a fascinating read for anyone interested in how comedy works.\n\nPlaying the Mask\n\n‘Masks are empowering… They enable you to take risks. They provoke you into working with the reckless logic of a six-year-old or the enigmatic stillness of someone wiser than you’ll ever be. But above all, masks let you be you without your habitual limitations.’"
