        "text": "When to Use Who (Subjective form)\n\nIn a sentence, who is used as a subject. Here are two examples:\n\nWho would like to be on your team?\n\nWho made those beautiful hats?\n\nWhen to Use Whom (Objective form)\n\nWhom is used as the object of a verb or preposition. Consider these examples:\n\nTo whom was the letter addressed?\n\nWhom do you believe\n\nI do not know with whom I will go to the concert.\n\nBelow are two tricks for how to figure out whether who or whom is correct.\n\nTrick No. 1\n\nThe commonly repeated advice for remembering whether to use who or whom is this: If you can replace the word with he or she or another subject pronoun, use who. If you can replace it with him or her (or another object pronoun), use whom. One way to remember this trick is that both him and whom end with the letter m.\n\nFor example:\n\n[Who/Whom] do you love? Do you love him? You would not say, “Do you love he?” So, whom is correct.\n\n[Who/Whom] writes the songs? He writes the songs. You would not say, “Him writes the songs.”\n\nTherefore, who is correct.\n\nTrick No. 2\n\nIf the first trick does not work for you, try this one:\n\nFind all the verbs in the sentence.\n\nFind the subject that corresponds to each verb.\n\nIf who/whom is a subject (the one doing the action), use who.\n\nIf who/whom is an object (the one receiving the action), use whom.\n\nLet us look at this example: Who made those beautiful hats and to whom will she give them?\n\nThe verbs are made and give.\n\nThe subjects are who and she.\n\nBecause who is the subject of the first clause, (doing the action) who is correct.\n\nBecause she is the subject of the second clause, whom is correct because it is receiving the hats.\n\nAnother Way to See How Who and Whom are Used.\n\nUse this he/him (she/her) method to decide whether who or whom is correct:\n\nhe = who\n\nhim = whom\n\nExamples:\n\nWho/Whom wrote the letter?\n\nHe wrote the letter. Therefore, who is correct.\n\nWho/Whom is going to make the presentation?\n\nShe is going to make the presentation. Therefore, who is correct.\n\nWho/Whom should I vote for?\n\nI should vote for her. Therefore, whom is correct.\n\nThe award for “Best Essay” will go to who/whom?\n\nThe award will go to her. Therefore, whom is correct.\n\nSources: proofreadnow.com, grammarlink.com/grammar/whoVwhom.asp"
