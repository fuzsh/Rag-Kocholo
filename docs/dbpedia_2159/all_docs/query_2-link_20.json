While at CAPA, Wright was cast in several productions, including:\n\nYou Can't Take It with You – Ed Carmichael\n\nStage Door – Adolph Gretzel\n\nA Midsummer Night's Dream – Snug\n\nLes Misérables – Bishop and Montparnasse\n\nDancing at Lughnasa – Michael Evans\n\nLi'l Abner – Abner\n\nA Piece of My Heart – Ensemble\n\nInto the Woods – The Baker\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire – Stanley Kowalski\n\nThe Crucible – Reverend John Hale\n\nMacbeth – Macduff\n\nWright won a prestigious scholarship to the Cranbrook Summer Theater in his junior year of high school, where he played Romeo in a production of Romeo and Juliet. In 2003, he was cast in Jake Heggie's opera Dead Man Walking at the Michigan Opera Theater. At the age of 16, Jonathan came to New York City and attended the summer acting workshop at The Lee Strasberg Theater Institute.\n\nUpon graduation from high school in 2005, he returned to New York to become the youngest member of The Actors Center's summer intensive, followed by their nine-month conservatory program, where he studied with teachers from Juilliard, Yale, NYU and the Royal Shakespeare Company: Scott Freeman, Charles Tuthill, Lisa Benavides-Nelson, Rob Clare(RSC), Orlando Pabotoy(Clown), Jane Nichols(Clown), Per Brah(Mask), Felix Ivanov(Movement), and Grace Zandarski(Voice). He would later be invited to join The Actors Center's resident company of professional actors where he participated in scene study with Ron Van Lieu.\n\nJonathan auditioned in 2005 for a role in the off-Broadway musical production of Spring Awakening at the Atlantic Theater Company. Jonathan was cast in the role of Hänschen Rilow, the choir boy who seduces his fellow male classmate, for which he has received rave reviews, being cited by some as a scene-stealer. He continued with Spring Awakening as it moved to Broadway and went on to win eight Tony awards. Wright's final performance was on April 20, 2008.\n\nIn October 2007, Wright was cast as Lethario in his first feature film, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, which was released on October 3, 2008.[2][3] His character (also referred to as \"Beefy Guy\") is the boyfriend of Dev (Rafi Gavron), the lead singer for The Jerk Offs. In May 2008, Wright was cast as Trent Preston in Youth in Revolt alongside Michael Cera, his Infinite Playlist castmate. Youth in Revolt received wide theatrical release on January 8, 2010.\n\nIn 2015, Wright was cast in Center Theatre Group's production of Martin Sherman's Bent, directed by Moises Kaufman in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2022, he took part in the HBO documentary film Spring Awakening: Those You've Known, which saw the 15 year reunion of the original cast of the musical.\n\nWright is also known as Jonny Wright, Jonny B. Wright and Jonny B.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
