        "text": "This year was a big one for 14-year-old actor and singer Shahadi Wright Joseph. Not only did she star in Jordan Peele's \"Us\" as Zora (Lupita Nyong'o's daughter), she also voiced Young Nala (a.k.a. young Beyoncé) in one of the biggest films of the summer, \"The Lion King\" and released her debut single, \"Skin I'm In.\"\n\nThe Recording Academy caught up with the rising talent to learn what it was like working on \"The Lion King\" and meeting Beyoncé, the other artists she looks up to and who her dream collaborator is (hint: he also worked on \"The Lion King\"). Check out our full conversation below.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dq8bYrZZ7As\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nYou voiced Young Nala in \"The Lion King\" reboot. What did it feel like just to be part of such a talented group of creatives and people?\n\nWell, in all, I think that I was really just honored and blessed, and I would definitely want to work with every member in the cast a thousand times. We had a lot of fun recording and you can definitely hear that in the music and in the songs. It sounds really authentic, so I think that's what I love most about it.\n\nYou've mentioned in interviews how finding out Beyoncé was playing the role of Nala made you want to work even harder. What did that moment of realization feel like for you?\n\nIt was really amazing, and I told myself that I really had to up my game because Beyoncé and I were going to share a role. It was just really exciting, and there was a lot of anticipation because I never knew when I was actually going to meet her. So it was a lot of fun meeting her at the premiere; that was a great opening present. [Chuckles.] Obviously I want to meet her again.\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzvT-T4DhM9/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

I think that we also tried to put our own twist to it and add our own personalities to it since we do want to make sure people know that there's a difference to both [of \"The Lion King\"] movies, other than the animation. But I think that we really tried to make it our own.\n\nWhat was the biggest thing you learned from working with everyone on the film?\n\nI think I learned the most about voice acting because I've never been in a voiceover feature film before, so it was really exciting. And I would definitely want to do voiceovers again, and I think that it's a great way where you get to practice your craft without using your body language. It was a lot of fun.\n\n<iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EAORlvUQRUk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nAnd right before the movie came out, you released \"Skin I'm In,\" which, if I'm not mistaken, is your debut single. How did it feel to share that with the world?\n\nYeah, it is. It was really, really awesome. I'm glad that I got to drop it right near when \"The Lion King\" was opening. I'm so glad for everybody supported me on this entire crazy journey between acting and singing. It was definitely a lot of fun releasing the single.\n\nThe song is very positive and self-affirmative; can you talk a bit about the main goal or message that you wanted to give with that song?\n\nThe main goal of the song was really to be a great influence for girls who look up to me or look up to young black Hollywood. To help younger kids who are inspired by me or anybody else who looks like me to really just love themselves just the way that they are and they don't have to change themselves for the standard of anybody, really.\n\nI love that. Are there any artists you look up to, who've made you feel like you have a place in music and in film?\n\nWell, I am a huge fan of Normani, and I have a feeling that I look a little bit like her. [Laughs.] But my sister's shaking her head \"no\" right now. I'm also a big fan of Jorja Smith. I know there's more; Ariana Grande too.\n\nWhen you were younger, did you ever imagine that you'd be where you are today?\n\nNot at all. I really did not. But with a lot of hard work and determination, I think that I have definitely come a very long way from where I used to be.\n\nThat's awesome. What are your biggest hopes and goals right now as a young, rising artist?\n\nWell, I am really excited about being in high school now, but I'm also excited to start applying to colleges. I have some time, but it sneaks up on you. I think that I would definitely want to go to Howard, Spelman or N.Y.U.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Look at my widdle sistah!!!<br>But, don&#39;t get it twisted, her strength runs way beyond the cuteness<a href=\"https://t.co/gFnncWsljh\">https://t.co/gFnncWsljh</a></p>&mdash; Shahadi (@Shahadi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shahadi/status/1179808319738806272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 3, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nDo you have any advice for other young people who are looking to get into music but either they don't know where to start or they're struggling to get to that first step?\n\nI would say keep striving for your goals and never give up, because if I gave up, I would not be in the position where I am today. Keep going for whatever you want in life.\n\nWhat's up next for you? Are you working on new music?\n\nI am. New music will be released soon, so I'm pretty excited for that and for you guys to hear that as well.\n\nDo you have any dream musical collaborators that you would love to work with?\n\nOoh. I would love to work with Childish Gambino.\n\n:NEXT With Sierra Lever: The Rising Music Marketer Talks Artist Storytelling, Kendrick Lamar & More\n\nA lot seems to have happened in the two years since 'Hypnos.' On a month-to-month, day-to-day basis, how much do you shift creatively?\n\nIt feels like night and day to me, even though it's been a really short amount of time. During this time between Hypnos and this album — the recording and creating process — a lot unlocked with me. [There was] a lot of personal growth that happened that allows me to approach music in a much freer and kind of impulsive way.\n\nWith the last album and that process, I think I did place a lot of parameters around what I had to be, what I had to sound like, what it had to feel like, who I had to connect with. And I kind of just released all of those expectations with this and made music that I wanted to hear.\n\nHow easy was it to actually release those boundaries and work more more in the moment?\n\nI knew in order for me to keep evolving as an artist and a person, there was no choice but to let those boundaries go, if I wanted to keep pursuing music in a way that felt honest. And then being able to collaborate with people such as Dahi, who has kind of mastered that in a lot of ways, and learning from him and seeing his process, seeing how easy and natural it is to just fall into what feels right…\n\nI think the longer you're in an industry or you're in something, the more rules you place on [creativity] and the more you overthink it and try to mold it in a way that doesn't feel impactful. As an artist, being around him and him encouraging that type of process, I think that was a lot of it, too.\n\nDahi's worked with some incredible artists, and clearly in a way that accentuates that artist rather than making it about DJ Dahi. That must have been so perfectly aligned with your openness, to go in and let yourself learn what you wanted to do. They always say if you know too much and plan everything out, you’ll end up stifled creatively.\n\nIt's so true. And that's why I describe it as me kind of returning back to that 12-year-old me, that 13-year-old me, before I cared about opinions, what people thought about me and what I was doing, what I was wearing I think we start off that way, and then the older we get, the more we get so self-conscious and we judge ourselves more harshly than everyone else.\n\nWhy do we do that?!\n\n[Laughs.] I think it's just human nature. And then we try to unlearn all of it.\n\nEven just in daily life, it's so hard to not think about what I could have done at any given moment. And when you’re creating music, there are 5 million ways you can create the same idea and you have to just land on that one.\n\nA hundred percent. During this process, we would have a song idea and then three different versions of that song that hit completely different feelings — maybe a more soft rock version of it, maybe a more indie version of it, maybe a more soulful version. Then it was about having to settle into what is \"the one\" and what feels the best, versus like what's going to chart or what's going to get in the club. Having to release all of that and just really lean into what feels good is what works every time.\n\nThat relates even to how the album was announced, with two tracks that almost speak in conversation with one another. Those songs balance such clever hooks with more nuanced conversation about how conflicted and complex love and relationships can be. How did you find that balance between emotional realism and such immediate music?\n\nIt was just really feeling empowered and confident in my decision making. And that's something that's developed over time, too. Really listening to my voice and what I want out of music in my career and my rollout, you know?\n\nListening to that, obviously having people around me who are like-minded in that way like my management and my team. We all kind of empowered each other to lean into those feelings. At no point in this process did anything feel forced or like I was reaching for something.\n\nThat’s so interesting. You want your team to feel supportive but you also want to feel empowered to take risks away from that support. And that reminds me of “Love Me Not,” which has some really smart risks. It's that vintage pop feeling, right down to the clap-along beats, and the vocals feel right in your ear. So when you started working on that track, for example, did you always imagine it being that nostalgia, that warmth?\n\nI thought that there was just something so cool and timeless, a classic feeling about it. And my songs are the ones where you can really pinpoint what the influences are, or when this was made, or the person behind it. Having a song like that, that really reminded me of Outkast. Like, What is this?\n\nEven before it dropped, I remember having some anxiety around maybe my fans not liking it because it feels a little different from Hypnos. I think anytime you kind of jump outside of the bubble you've kind of created, it's scary because there are people living in that bubble with you who like the temperature in there.\n\nIt’s so important to be constantly revitalized in your work. If you’re doing the same thing, even if your fans are demanding it, you’re not going to get that. And hopefully when your fans see all that you can do, they’ll follow it.\n\nYeah. And there's so much left in me to explore into and put out into the world. And look at an artist's career, someone like Tyler, the Creator: Seeing where his sound started and how he's almost trained his fans’ ears to be receptive to something new every time. They've completely grown up with him in a lot of ways and expanded their palate. Kind of forcing the hand of listeners is something that's really interesting to me. [Laughs.]\n\nI love that idea of pushing yourself and pushing your fans, but still within the realm of what's good. [Laughs] Not just experimenting for the sake of it. Speaking of growing and experimenting, I wanted to ask about the “Love Me Not” music video that you directed. It feels so well shot but still so intimate and casual.\n\nI knew with the album and how I wanted the imagery to feel, it would be very homey. Making the songs and getting to the bottom of what they meant for me was me kind of retracing my steps a little bit and really acknowledging all these moments in my life, in my childhood, that were pivotal for me and my identity, those first moments where I felt like I was getting closer to myself in a way.\n\nA lot of that started on the South side of Chicago, at my grandmother's house, in the basement. Even the cover of the album symbolizes that transition for me. That's where I dyed my hair red for the first time in the basement, in the sink, so coming back to the sink and dyeing my hair ginger on the cover was something that felt so powerful and defining for me. It just made perfect sense that we were going to go back to Chicago for the first video, in my grandmother's house, with all my family members involved. Those are my grandparents, my mom, my sisters, so that's why it feels so loose and candid. I really wanted to give people a glimpse into my life and what it felt like walking into my childhood home.\n\nGetting to see a place through someone else’s eyes is so extraordinary. It really makes the little details pop. For example, the plantains cooking on the stove at the beginning.\n\nYeah. I associate plantains with my grandparents, my family. We’re of Panamanian West Indian descent, so those smells and those sounds, I really wanted to incorporate into the video.\n\nThat really speaks to bringing some comfort along with the risk-taking, same as having your family around. The features do a great job of bolstering you, setting up that stability, particularly Ty Dolla $ign on \"Dreamgirl.\"\n\nI think we just had the idea to kind of take the song into a different world in a way. When we first started the first section of the song, I just knew there was magic there. Those Prince drums and that Brazilian guitar — why do those make sense together? It shouldn't ever make sense together. But when I heard it? Oh my god, this feels like something fresh and new, but also like I've felt this feeling before.\n\nDahi's brain is just incredible, and then even bringing in Jimmy Jam on it to do bass was a dream come true. I knew it kind of felt like it existed in that Janet stratosphere, and I thought it would be such a cool touch for him to do that personally. Dream come true on all spectrums. I love Ty Dolla $ign, obviously grew up listening to him. He's incredible and I was so honored that he wanted to do it.\n\nBesides Janet, were there any particular artists who were kind of central inspirations for this album specifically?\n\nSonically, Janet is always in the mix. With this one in particular, some Gwen Stefani, No Doubt, a little bit of Fleetwood Mac in there. I just love taking these worlds that are very different from each other and kind of mashing them and seeing what happens. It's like my favorite thing ever.\n\nYou’re trained in classical music, and it's so clear that you understand the range of emotion that you can convey. I'm just curious what happened when you went into recording — or even before that, in the writing. What was it like digging into yourself to find the narrative that matched the mashing?\n\nHonestly, I don't think there was much premeditation with the writing and what I wanted to touch on in a way. Really leaning into those impulsive initial first feelings that a song gives me is something I really valued with this album. And moving forward, that'll be my process.\n\nWhat was premeditated with the writing process with this album was, with every song, trying to really peel back those layers in my brain and those barriers lyrically. Like, What would I naturally say? Think of that and then think, Okay, how can I make this even more literal, even more personal? Even in working with my girl [songwriter] Sarah Aarons, I learned a lot from her as far as songwriting and how to really paint a picture that feels clear and concise and emotional. Not trying to find the prettiest words or the most interesting words, but really writing what feels real. And that's something that I've really, really valued and learned with this process.\n\nEven with “One Wish” with Childish Gambino, the whole album feels like this big conversation on relationships. Being more direct feels like some advice someone would get with a relationship itself, let alone writing about it. Did that process help you actually process what was happening in your life too?\n\nOh man, 100 percent. And that's why music is so beautiful to me. It's really a means of opening dialogue between me and myself, and then me and the people in my life. With a song that's so important to me like “One Wish,\" it’s not just because it's a great song, but because this has really catapulted me into this different part of my life and repairing relationships, opening up difficult conversations — like with my father in particular. Hearing such a simple song and the response I've gotten from it has only validated me much more in the fact that these real stories, real emotions are what connects.\n\nHave you played the album for your father?\n\nWe started repairing or rekindling our relationship maybe two years ago. The making of Bird’s Eye was at its peak and I felt like it was important for me to have a song on the album that addressed my relationship with him in order for me to release it and start to move on in a positive way.\n\nSo sharing the song with him, inviting him to be in the music video was huge for us. And then even after debriefing about maybe some feelings that came up when he heard certain lyrics or when he saw certain scenes in the video, it just opened up this really honest, candid dialogue between us and I couldn't be more grateful that I have this outlet.\n\nIt’s been ten years since you broke out with the massive hit \"Johnny.\" Back then, African pop music was relatively unknown in America. Since then, African artists have gained global recognition. Do you see yourself as a pioneer for the current Afropop movement?\n\nI agree with you 100 percent, there is no way you authentically go through the history of, you know, building a bridge between Africa and the rest of the world via music without mentioning a song like \"Johnny.\" It's definitely an honor for me to be the vessel that delivers such amazing music to the world. Of course, there were people way before me who also did the same thing. We're talking about Fela [Kuti]. We're talking about King Sunny Ade. At the end of the day, yes, music is metamorphosing into so much more. And definitely, I'm a pioneer [laughs].\n\nYou have a strong sense of storytelling, especially in your music videos. \"Johnny\" has an entire storyline about a news reporter investigating a womanizer. How important is that kind of storytelling to your music?\n\nStorytelling is a big part of my artistry, because I feel everybody loves a good story. I find that even when I'm writing most times in the studio, there's always a picture I'm trying to paint, and it only makes sense for the visuals to kind of match that most of the time. Except sometimes we decide to make it a performance video because I just feel like dancing.\n\nWhat’s the most memorable video you’ve ever done?\n\nEvery one of my videos has taken a lot of pain, sweat, and even some tears. But I think \"Johnny\" is such a masterpiece, because it resonated with the entire world, and Africa especially. And it pretty much helped me to stay on my way through the industry, because it became my identity. That song and that video was the platform for the brand and everything that I am today. you know, so that is definitely the most memorable, in a good way.\n\nYou've traveled to and performed in America several times in your career. What's your overall impression?\n\nI think I've done four or five American tours. And yo, America is so big [laughs]. My first American tour had me in shambles, because of the flights. I didn't realize that to go from one city to another, I might have to connect once or twice depending on how far I'm going. So the flights had me in shambles, but the energy of the people? Oh my days, lit! America is definitely one of my favorite places. I’m always reminding my agents to make sure that they include American cities on my tours, which is why even for the album listening parties for Rebel Queen, we did the first one in Paris, then London, and then we had to come to New York as well. And then just yesterday, we had one in Lagos as well.\n\nSince you first became popular, a lot of Afrobeats artists have gained a following abroad like Burna Boy and WizKid. It seems as though, at least looking at the artists that break outside of Africa, that the genre is still very male-dominated. Do you agree with that? And do you think there’s potential for more female artists to break out internationally?\n\nHonestly, when I started out, the odds were really way more against women than they are right now, in that, there were female artists sprouting maybe once every two years, or once every year, and barely hanging around long enough. But now, the story is different. And I give kudos to all the women before me and all the women with me. Yes, in a male dominated society, it seems as though my male counterparts get their roses and their flowers for a second. And you know, once in a while someone comes back and remembers, \"Oh, there's Yemi Alade.\" Do you know what I mean?\n\nI was speaking to someone earlier today and I was saying, I think what surprises me the most is that, I feel like there are no expectations of female artists. So like, if we do or we don't, people are just moving on. But I'm not the one to play victim, never. Despite the odds, you see that the females continue to be resilient, because we know. I know deep within that my existence is definitely of value to so many people out there.\n\nWhat do you think of the upcoming generation of talent like Tems and Ayra Starr and Tyla, who recently won the first GRAMMY Award for Best African Music Performance for \"Water?\"\n\nExceptional, exceptional artists. As you just mentioned, they're doing amazingly well. And, you know, these women are unique in their own ways. And I want to just say that I believe it's just the starting point for them. There's so much to come. And there's so many other females that are still en route to greatness.\n\nHow have you seen the music industry in Africa evolve? And what sorts of challenges do you think African musicians face today?\n\nI personally feel like, with all the momentum that Afrobeats has got, we need authentic platforms that can actually check the streaming numbers that are coming in for music, especially within Africa. Because at the moment it’s mostly Apple, Spotify, etc. But there are other platforms here in Africa that most Africans use, and they have more of a database compared to Apple and Spotify. We've come to a point where we need to have more credible numbers, because there's millions of people streaming music in Africa that are not on those platforms.\n\nSo you think that these local platforms need to be counted alongside Apple and Spotify?\n\n100 percent. In Nigeria there’s two: Audiomack and Boomplay. Boomplay is a big deal.\n\nYou’re going on a decade in the industry. In all that time, what's one moment or one achievement that gives you the greatest sense of accomplishment? What are you most proud of in your career?\n\nThat’s a big question…I think I have an idea, because there've been so many moments in my life and in my career that have aligned with my dreams coming true. Number one is each time that I'm approached by a complete stranger and the stranger tells me \"Oh my God, Yemi. You don't know what your music has done for me. Your music has gotten me through so much grief.\" Some people walk up to me and tell me that they just had the biggest struggle in their life and they listen to my music, and it always sends them into a realm of joy and happiness. Honestly, I feel accomplished in those moments, because when I record my music, I always say, the thing I'm trying to spread through my music the most is love, joy and happiness. So to have people testify to that, it means to me that the magic is complete, that my job is actually effective. So that makes me feel very accomplished.\n\nOn a personal note, an accomplishment that I am most grateful to is the fact that I'm always able to comfortably take care of my family. It's something that I would never play down. You know, I'm just grateful to God for that.\n\nAnd lastly, aside from winning a GRAMMY through Angelique Kidjo — you know, I've met a lot of amazing people, and Beyoncé is one of them. So at the end of the day, it's a full circle moment for me. I'm just enjoying the ride.\n\nYou know, it’s funny you mentioned Beyoncé, I was just about to ask you what it was like to work with her.\n\nOh my days — wow, working with her, it was such an experience for myself and my team. It was like, we're literally awake, walking in the dreams that we have dreamt for so long.The process of her team contacting us was a bit weird, because my management didn't realize that Parkwood [Entertainment] was a real company, that they were emailing them and talking about Beyoncé. They assumed that it was some kind of scam artist. But when they had sent it to me, I was like \"What? Parkwood? Who doesn’t know Parkwood is Beyoncé?\"\n\nSo it turned out that it was for real, and we went to L.A. where the studio was, and I lost my voice for 24 hours — I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t sing. I just soaked up all the vitamin C's and hot teas and Throat Coats I could get. I managed to regain a little bit of my voice back and that's what I was able to record that day. That was a miracle for me. But one of the most memorable moments was actually meeting her in person. After the album, Lion King, came out, the movie was being premiered in London, and I happened to be in London at that time. We had met her in person, we met Jay Z. It was such a full circle moment. Honestly, that lady has really touched my life in a way that I will never forget. Because she could have lived her life without doing what she did, but she decided to reach out to people she felt were pillars of African music and pay homage to Africa. And I'm happy to have been part of that moment."
