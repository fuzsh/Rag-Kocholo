        "text": "Introduction\n\nThis document, which is one of a series of question-and-answer documents addressing particular disabilities in the workplace,[1] explains how the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to job applicants and employees with hearing disabilities. In particular, this document explains:\n\nwhen an employer may ask an applicant or employee questions about a hearing condition and how it should treat voluntary disclosures;\n\nwhat types of reasonable accommodations applicants or employees with hearing disabilities may need;\n\nhow an employer should handle safety concerns about applicants and employees with hearing disabilities; and\n\nhow an employer can ensure that no employee is harassed because of a hearing disability or any other disability.\n\nThe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces the employment provisions of the ADA, a federal law that prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities. The ADA provides that individuals with disabilities include those who have “a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities . . . ,” have a record (or history) of a substantially limiting impairment, or are regarded as having such an impairment. This document uses ADA statutory terminology for its legal meaning and to refer inclusively to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as those who have other hearing conditions, such as tinnitus and sensitivity to noise. [2]\n\nTitle I of the ADA covers employment by private employers with 15 or more employees as well as state and local government employers. Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act provides similar protections related to federal employment. In addition, most states have their own laws prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of disability. Some of these state laws may apply to smaller employers and may provide protections in addition to those available under the ADA.[3]\n\nGeneral Information about Hearing Conditions\n\nApproximately 15 percent of American adults report some trouble hearing.[4] People with a variety of hearing conditions (including deafness, being hard of hearing, experiencing ringing in the ears, or having sensitivity to noise) may have ADA disabilities.\n\nThere are many different circumstances that may contribute to individuals becoming deaf, hard of hearing, or experiencing other hearing conditions (including childhood illnesses, pregnancy-related illnesses, injury, heredity, age, and excessive or prolonged exposure to noise).[5] These circumstances can affect the way such individuals experience sound, communicate with others, and view their hearing conditions.[6] For example, some individuals who develop a hearing condition later in life may not use American Sign Language (ASL) or other common communication methods used by some with hearing conditions or may not use them as proficiently as some individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing at birth or from a very young age.\n\nIndividuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have other hearing conditions can perform successfully on the job and, under the ADA, should not be denied opportunities because of stereotypical assumptions about those conditions. Some employers assume incorrectly that workers with hearing conditions will cause safety hazards, increase employment costs, or have difficulty communicating in fast-paced environments. In reality, with or without reasonable accommodation, individuals with hearing conditions can be effective and safe workers.\n\n1. When does someone with a hearing condition have a disability within the meaning of the ADA?\n\nAccording to the ADA, the definition of “disability” is interpreted broadly in favor of expansive coverage.[7] Under the ADA, individuals with an impairment of hearing will meet the first prong of the ADA’s definition of disability (“actual disability”) if they can show that they are substantially limited in hearing or another major life activity (e.g., the major bodily function of special sense organs).[8] A determination of disability must ignore the positive effects of any mitigating measure that is used.[9] For example, if someone uses a hearing aid or has a cochlear implant, the benefits of such a device would not be considered when determining if the impairment is substantially limiting.[10] People who are deaf should easily be found to have a disability within the meaning of the first part of the ADA’s definition of disability because they are substantially limited in the major life activity of hearing.[11]\n\nIndividuals with a history of an impairment will be covered under the second prong of the ADA definition of disability if they have a record of an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity in the past.[12] An applicant or employee may have a “record of” disability, for example, when the individual’s hearing has been corrected surgically. Finally, an individual is covered under the third (“regarded as”) prong of the ADA definition of disability if an employer takes a prohibited action (for example, refuses to hire or terminates the individual) because of a hearing condition or because the employer believes the individual has an impairment of hearing, other than an impairment that is not both transitory and minor.\n\nObtaining, Using, and Disclosing Medical Information\n\nThe ADA limits an employer’s ability to ask applicants or employees questions related to disabilities (including hearing disabilities) and to conduct medical examinations. Different rules apply for these inquiries and exams at three distinct stages: pre-offer, post-offer, and during employment.\n\nJob Applicants\n\nBefore an Offer of Employment Is Made\n\n2. May an employer ask whether a job applicant has or had a hearing condition, or treatment related to a hearing condition, prior to making a job offer?\n\nNo. An employer may not ask questions about an applicant’s medical condition[13] or require an applicant to have a medical examination before it makes a conditional job offer. This means that an employer cannot ask an applicant such questions as:\n\nwhether the applicant has ever had any medical procedures related to hearing (for example, whether the applicant has a cochlear implant);\n\nwhether the applicant uses a hearing aid; or\n\nwhether the applicant has any condition that affects the applicant’s hearing.\n\nOf course, an employer may ask questions pertaining to the applicant’s ability to perform the essential functions of the position, with or without reasonable accommodation, such as:\n\nwhether the applicant can respond quickly to instructions in a noisy, fast-paced work environment;\n\nwhether the applicant has good communication skills; or\n\nwhether the applicant can meet legally mandated safety standards required to perform a job.\n\n3. Does the ADA require an applicant to disclose a current or past disability before accepting a job offer?\n\nNo. The ADA does not require applicants to disclose that they have or had a hearing disability or another disability unless they will need a reasonable accommodation for the application process (for example, a sign language interpreter). Some individuals with a hearing condition, however, choose to disclose or discuss their condition to dispel myths about it or to ensure that employers do not assume that the condition means the person is unable to do the job.\n\nSometimes, the decision to disclose depends on whether an individual will need a reasonable accommodation to perform the job (for example, specialized equipment, removal of a marginal function, or another type of job restructuring). A person with a hearing condition, however, may request an accommodation after becoming an employee even if they did not do so when applying for the job or after receiving the job offer.\n\n4. May an employer ask questions about an obvious hearing condition, or ask follow-up questions if an applicant discloses a non-obvious hearing condition?\n\nNo. An employer generally may not ask an applicant about obvious impairments. Nor may an employer ask an applicant who has voluntarily disclosed a hearing condition any questions about its nature or severity, when it began, or how the individual manages the condition. However, if an applicant has an obvious impairment or has voluntarily disclosed the existence of an impairment and the employer reasonably believes that the applicant will require an accommodation to complete the application process, or to perform the job because of the condition, the employer may ask whether the applicant will need an accommodation and what type. The employer must keep any information an applicant discloses about a medical condition confidential. (See “Keeping Medical Information Confidential,” below.)\n\nAfter an Offer of Employment Is Made\n\nAfter making a job offer, an employer may ask questions about the applicant’s health (including questions about the applicant's disability) and may require a medical examination, as long as all applicants for the same type of job are treated equally (that is, all applicants are asked the same questions and are required to take the same examination). After an employer has obtained basic medical information from all individuals who have received job offers, it may ask specific individuals for more medical information if the request is medically related to the previously obtained medical information. For example, if an employer asks all applicants post-offer about their general physical and mental health, it can ask individuals who disclose a particular illness, disease, or impairment for medical information or require them to have a medical examination related to the condition disclosed.\n\n5. What may an employer do when it learns that an applicant has or had a hearing condition after the applicant has been offered a job but before starting work?\n\nWhen an applicant discloses, after receiving a conditional job offer, that the applicant has or had a hearing condition, an employer may ask the applicant additional questions, such as how long the individual has had the hearing condition; what, if any, hearing the applicant has; what specific hearing limitations the individual experiences; and what, if any, reasonable accommodations the applicant may need to perform the job. The employer also may send the applicant for a follow-up hearing or medical examination or ask the individual to submit medical documentation answering questions specifically designed to assess the applicant’s ability to perform the job’s functions safely. Permissible follow-up questions at this stage differ from those at the pre-offer stage, when an employer may only ask an applicant who voluntarily discloses a disability or whose disability is obvious whether the individual needs an accommodation either in the application process or to perform the job.\n\nAn employer may not withdraw an offer from an applicant with a hearing disability if the individual is able to perform the essential functions of a job, with or without reasonable accommodation, without posing a direct threat (that is, a significant risk of substantial harm) to the health or safety of the applicant or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced through reasonable accommodation. (Below, “Accommodating Applicants and Employees” addresses reasonable accommodations (Questions 9 – 15) and “Concerns about Safety” addresses “direct threat” (Questions 16 and 17).)\n\nEmployees\n\nThe ADA strictly limits the circumstances under which an employer may ask questions about an employee's medical condition or require the employee to have a medical examination. Once an employee is on the job, actual performance is the best measure of ability to do the job.\n\n6. When may an employer ask an employee if a hearing condition, or some other medical condition, may be causing the employee’s performance problems?\n\nGenerally, an employer may ask disability-related questions or require an employee to have a medical examination when it knows about a particular employee’s medical condition, has observed performance problems, and reasonably believes that the problems are related to a medical condition. At other times, an employer may ask for medical information when it has observed symptoms, such as difficulties hearing, or has received reliable information from someone else (for example, a family member or co-worker) indicating that the employee may have a medical condition that is causing performance problems. Often, however, poor job performance is unrelated to a medical condition and generally should be handled in accordance with an employer's existing policies concerning performance.[14]\n\n7. Are there any other instances when an employer may ask an employee about the employee’s hearing?\n\nYes. An employer also may ask an employee about a hearing condition when it has a reasonable belief that the employee will be unable to safely perform the essential functions of the job because of it. In addition, an employer may ask an employee about the employee’s hearing to the extent the information is necessary:\n\nto support the employee’s request for a reasonable accommodation needed because of a hearing disability;\n\nto enable the employee to participate in a voluntary wellness program;[15] or\n\nto verify the employee’s use of sick leave related to a hearing condition if the employer requires all employees to submit a doctor’s note to justify their use of sick leave.[16]\n\nKeeping Medical Information Confidential\n\nWith limited exceptions, an employer must keep confidential any medical information it learns about an applicant or employee. Under the following circumstances, however, an employer may disclose that an employee has a hearing condition:\n\nto supervisors and managers, if necessary to provide a reasonable accommodation or meet an employee’s work restrictions;\n\nto first aid and safety personnel if an employee may need emergency treatment or require some other assistance at work;\n\nto individuals investigating compliance with the ADA and similar state and local laws; and\n\nwhere needed for workers’ compensation or insurance purposes (for example, to process a claim).\n\n8. May an employer tell employees who ask why their co-worker is allowed to do something that generally is not permitted (such as working at home or working a modified schedule) that the co-worker is receiving a reasonable accommodation?\n\nNo. Telling coworkers that an employee is receiving an ADA reasonable accommodation amounts to a disclosure that the employee has a disability.[17] Rather than disclosing that the employee is receiving a reasonable accommodation, the employer may find it helpful to point out that many employee issues are personal and focus on the importance of maintaining the privacy of all employees.[18]\n\nEmployers may also be able to avoid many of these kinds of questions by training all employees on the requirements of equal employment laws, including the ADA, and by providing information about reasonable accommodation to all of their employees. Education on reasonable accommodation can be done in a number of ways, such as through written reasonable accommodation procedures, employee handbooks, staff meetings, and periodic online or in-person training. This kind of proactive approach may lead to fewer questions from employees who misperceive co-worker accommodations as “special treatment.”\n\nAccommodating Applicants and Employees\n\nThe ADA requires employers to provide adjustments or modifications—called reasonable accommodations—to enable applicants and employees with disabilities to enjoy equal employment opportunities unless doing so would be an undue hardship (that is, a significant difficulty or expense). Accommodations vary depending on the needs of the individual with a disability. Not all applicants or employees with a hearing condition will need an accommodation or require the same accommodations.\n\n9. What type of reasonable accommodations may applicants or employees with hearing disabilities need?\n\nSome applicants or employees may need one or more of the following accommodations:\n\nA sign language interpreter.\n\nAssistive technology, including:\n\nAccess to a video relay service or video remote interpreting service using equipment such as a videophone, computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.\n\nA hearing aid-compatible telephone headset, a telephone amplifier, and/or adapters for using a phone with hearing aids or cochlear implants.\n\nAppropriate emergency notification systems (for example, strobe lighting on fire alarms or vibrating pagers).\n\nEnabling the streaming of sound directly from a device to hearing aids or cochlear implants.\n\nUtilizing accessibility features of mainstream technology (for example, using the captioning feature on virtual meeting platforms).\n\nA voice carry-over telephone, captioned telephone, text telephone, or TTY.[19]\n\nEquipment used for hearing protection to block noise or to protect hearing function, including equipment that can be used with hearing aids.\n\nAssistive software or applications (for example, for automated captioning, voice recognition, videoconferencing, or sound detection).\n\nAssistive listening devices (ALDs).\n\nAugmentative communication devices that allow users to communicate orally by typing words that are then translated to sign language or a simulated voice.\n\nCommunication access real-time translation (CART), which translates voice into text at real-time speeds.\n\nAppropriate written memos and notes (especially used for brief, simple, or routine communications).\n\nNote-taking assistance for those using CART services or sign language interpretation (to allow individuals using CART services or sign language interpretation to remain focused on translations).\n\nWork area adjustments (for example, a desk away from a noisy area or near an emergency alarm with strobe lighting).\n\nTime off in the form of accrued paid leave or unpaid leave if paid leave has been exhausted or is unavailable.[20]\n\nAltering an employee’s marginal (that is, non-essential) job functions.\n\nReassignment to a vacant position.\n\nOther modifications or adjustments that allow a qualified applicant or employee with an ADA disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities.\n\nAlthough these are some examples of the types of accommodations commonly requested by employees with hearing conditions, other employees may need different changes or adjustments.[21] Employers should ask the particular employee requesting an accommodation what is needed that will help the employee do the job. There also are extensive public and private resources to help employers identify reasonable accommodations. For example, the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) is a free, confidential service that provides information about many types of accommodations for applicants and employees with disabilities based on the needs of a given individual and workplace.\n\n10. How does an applicant or employee request a reasonable accommodation?\n\nThere are no “magic words” that a person has to use when requesting a reasonable accommodation. A person simply has to tell the employer that the individual needs an adjustment or change at work because of an impairment. A request for reasonable accommodation also can come from a family member, friend, health professional, or other representative on behalf of a person with a disability. If an employer requires more information about the disability and why an accommodation is needed, it should engage in an “interactive process”—a dialogue with the applicant or employee—to obtain information that will help the employer in handling the request.\n\nApplicants and employees may find it helpful to discuss any necessary accommodations with the employer prior to starting a new position or assuming new job duties, even if an accommodation was provided during the job application process or in a previous position. Similarly, employers may, as a best practice, inform all new hires post-offer that they may request any needed accommodation in advance of their start date or once on the job.\n\n11. May an employer request documentation when an applicant or employee requests a reasonable accommodation?\n\nSometimes. When a person’s hearing condition is not obvious, the employer may ask the person to provide reasonable documentation about how the condition limits major life activities (that is, whether the person has a disability) and why a reasonable accommodation is needed. An employer, however, is entitled only to documentation sufficient to establish that the individual has a hearing disability and to explain why an accommodation is needed. A request for an individual’s entire medical record, for example, would be inappropriate, as it likely would include information about conditions other than the individual’s hearing.[22]\n\n12. Does an employer have to grant every request for a reasonable accommodation?\n\nNo. An employer does not have to provide an accommodation if doing so would be an undue hardship. Undue hardship means that providing the reasonable accommodation will result in significant difficulty or expense. An employer also does not have to eliminate an essential function of a job as a reasonable accommodation, tolerate performance that does not meet its standards, or excuse violations of conduct rules that are job-related and consistent with business necessity and that the employer applies consistently to all employees (such as rules prohibiting violence, threatening behavior, theft, or destruction of property). Nor do employers have to provide employees with personal use items, such as hearing aids or other devices that are used both on and off the job.\n\nIf more than one accommodation would be effective, the employee’s preference should be given primary consideration, although the employer is not required to provide the employee’s first choice of reasonable accommodation. If a requested accommodation is too difficult or expensive, an employer may choose to provide an easier or less costly accommodation as long as it is effective in meeting the employee’s needs.\n\n13. May an employer be required to provide more than one accommodation for the same applicant or employee?\n\nYes. The duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is an ongoing one. Although some applicants or employees with a disability may require only one reasonable accommodation, others may need more than one. An employer must consider each request for a reasonable accommodation and determine whether it would be effective and whether providing it would pose an undue hardship.\n\n14. Does an employer have to provide a reasonable accommodation to an applicant with a disability during the application process even if it believes that it will be unable to provide this individual with a reasonable accommodation on the job?\n\nYes. An employer must provide a reasonable accommodation to a qualified applicant with a disability that will enable the individual to have an equal opportunity to participate in the application process and to be considered for a job (unless the employer can show undue hardship). Thus, individuals with disabilities who meet initial requirements to be considered for a job should not be excluded from the application process because the employer speculates, based on a request for reasonable accommodation for the application process, that it will be unable to provide the individual with reasonable accommodation to perform the job. In many instances, employers will be unable to determine whether an individual needs reasonable accommodation to perform a job based solely on a request for accommodation during the application process. And even if an individual will need reasonable accommodation to perform the job, it may not be the same type or degree of accommodation that is needed for the application process. Thus, an employer should assess the need for accommodations for the application process separately from those that may be needed to perform the job.[23]\n\n15. What kinds of reasonable accommodations are related to the benefits and privileges of employment?\n\nReasonable accommodations related to the benefits and privileges of employment include accommodations that are necessary to provide individuals with disabilities access to facilities or portions of facilities to which all employees are granted access (for example, employee break rooms and cafeterias), access to information communicated in the workplace, and the opportunity to participate in employer-sponsored training and social events.\n\nAn employer will not be excused from providing an employee with a disability with a necessary accommodation because the employer has contracted with another entity to conduct the event.\n\nConcerns About Safety\n\nWhen it comes to safety concerns, an employer should be careful not to act on the basis of myths, fears, or stereotypes about hearing conditions. Instead, the employer should evaluate an individual on the individual’s skills, knowledge, experience, and how the hearing condition affects the individual.\n\n16. When may an employer refuse to hire, terminate, or temporarily restrict the duties of a person who has or had a hearing disability because of safety concerns?\n\nAn employer only may exclude an individual with a hearing disability from a job for safety reasons when the individual poses a direct threat. A “direct threat” is a significant risk of substantial harm to the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced through reasonable accommodation.[27] An employer should conduct an individualized “direct threat” assessment of an individual’s present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job.[28] This determination must be based on reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. In making a direct threat assessment, the employer must consider:\n\n(1) the duration of the risk;\n\n(2) the nature and severity of the potential harm;\n\n(3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and\n\n(4) the imminence of the potential harm.[29]\n\nThe harm must be serious and likely to occur, not remote or speculative. Finally, the employer must determine whether any reasonable accommodation would reduce or eliminate the risk.[30]\n\n17. What should an employer do when another federal law prohibits it from hiring individuals with a hearing condition for particular positions?\n\nIf a federal law prohibits an employer from hiring a person with a hearing condition for a particular position, the employer is not liable under the ADA. The employer should be certain, however, that compliance with the law actually is required, not voluntary. The employer also should be sure that the law does not contain any exceptions or waivers.\n\nHarassment\n\nThe ADA prohibits harassment, or offensive conduct, based on disability just as other federal laws prohibit harassment based on race, sex, color, national origin, religion, age, and genetic information. Offensive conduct may include, but is not limited to, offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, offensive objects or pictures, and interference with work performance. Although the law does not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).\n\n18. What should employers do to prevent and correct harassment?\n\nEmployers should make clear that they will not tolerate harassment based on disability or on any other protected basis. This can be done in a number of ways, such as through a written policy, employee handbooks, staff meetings, and periodic training. The employer should emphasize that harassment is prohibited and that employees should promptly report such conduct to a manager. Finally, the employer should immediately conduct a thorough investigation of any report of harassment and take swift and appropriate corrective action. For more information on the standards governing harassment under all of the EEO laws, see EEOC’s Harassment webpage.\n\nRetaliation and Interference\n\nThe ADA prohibits retaliation by an employer against someone who opposes discriminatory employment practices, files a charge of employment discrimination, or testifies or participates in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation related to a charge of employment discrimination. It is also unlawful for an employer to retaliate against someone for requesting a reasonable accommodation, or to interfere with the exercise of ADA rights. Persons who believe that they have been retaliated against or subjected to ADA interference may file a charge as described below.\n\nHow to File a Charge of Employment Discrimination\n\nAgainst Private Employers and State/Local Governments\n\nIf you believe that your employment-related ADA rights may have been violated, the EEOC can help you decide what to do next. For example, if the employer refuses to consider your request for a reasonable accommodation to complete an application process or perform your job, and if you think you would be able to do the job with a reasonable accommodation, you might consider filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. A discrimination charge is an applicant’s or employee’s statement alleging that an employer engaged in employment discrimination and asking the EEOC to help find a remedy under the EEO laws.\n\nIf you file a charge of discrimination, the EEOC will conduct an investigation. Mediation, which is an informal and confidential way for people to resolve disputes with the help of a neutral mediator, may also be available. Because you must file an EEOC charge within 180 days of the alleged violation in order to take further legal action (or 300 days if the employer is covered by a state or local employment discrimination law), it is best to begin the process early. It is unlawful for an employer to retaliate against you for contacting the EEOC or filing a charge.\n\nIf you would like to begin the process of filing a charge, go to our EEOC Online Public Portal, contact your local EEOC office (contact information available on the local office page), or contact us by phone at 1-800-669-4000 (voice), 1-800-669-6820 (TTY), or 1-844-234-5122 (ASL Video Phone).\n\nAgainst the Federal Government\n\nIf you are a federal employee or job applicant and you believe that a federal agency has discriminated against you, you have a right to file a complaint. Each agency is required to post information about how to contact the agency’s EEO Office. You can contact an EEO Counselor by contacting the office responsible for the agency’s EEO complaints program. Generally, you must contact the EEO Counselor within 45 days from the day the discrimination occurred. In most cases the EEO Counselor will give you the choice of participating either in EEO counseling or in an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program, such as a mediation program.\n\nIf you do not settle the dispute during counseling or though ADR, you can file a formal discrimination complaint against the agency with the agency’s EEO Office. You must file within 15 days from the day you receive notice from your EEO Counselor about how to file.\n\nOnce you have filed a formal complaint, the agency will review the complaint and decide whether or not the case should be dismissed for a procedural reason (for example, your claim was filed too late). If the agency doesn’t dismiss the complaint, it will conduct an investigation. The agency has 180 days from the day you filed your complaint to finish the investigation. When the investigation is finished, the agency will issue a notice giving you two choices: either request a hearing before an EEOC Administrative Judge or ask the agency to issue a decision as to whether the discrimination occurred. A detailed description of the federal sector EEO process is available on our website.\n\nIf you require language assistance (such as a sign language interpreter or assistive technology) to file a complaint, participate in an EEOC investigation, or as part of an EEOC hearing process, you should submit a request to your agency for assistance. It will then be the responsibility of the responding agency to provide needed language assistance.\n\nThis information is not new policy; rather, this document applies principles already established in the ADA’s statutory and regulatory provisions as well as previously issued guidance.
