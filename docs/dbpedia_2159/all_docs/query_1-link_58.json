        "text": "Phil Wright, a Miami born ball of positive energy, grew up in the dance industry teaching kids of all ages how to express themselves through movement. Phil got his foot in the industry by dancing and choreographing for well known artists such as Kevin Hart, Will Smith, Lil Nas X, Nicki Minaj, Pitbull, Chayanne, and Cardi B. In 2017 Phil established his own traveling dance business specializing in what he called “The Parent Jam”. The Parent Jam is a style of dance performance that includes children and their parents jamming out together to timeless music! To make things more exciting, we’ve even jammed out with grandparents, extended family, and blended families so the whole fam can get in on the fun! Once the craze caught fire on social media, PhilWright Inc produced a Disney channel show called “Disney’s Fam Jam” to highlight the bonding experience that happens when generations come together to perform. Phil‘s love of family experience and dance combined has created a positive learning environment that you truly cannot hold back a smile while watching. Currently Phil teaches across globe on a regular basis and produces projects frequently."
