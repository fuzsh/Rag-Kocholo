        "text": "The grand finale of Celebrity Hairstylist Johnny Wright's Naturally You Tour unfolded at Miami Art Week, captivating audiences with an exquisite art exhibition titled UNTANGLED: Combing through the Roots of Black Hair on December 7th- 8th assembled by Co-curators Jarvis DuBois and Gia Harewood.\n\nInspired by his bestselling book Natural and Curly Hair for Dummies, Johnny Wright envisioned a tour that transcended the traditional boundaries of book signings. The Naturally You Tour fostered a safe and celebratory space for people of all backgrounds to come together, share their stories, connect, and dispel biases about self-image and identity.\n\n“This was a dream manifested, said Celebrity Hairstylist, Johnny Wright. When I thought about what my book tour would look and feel like, I knew I wanted it to be an experience everyone could enjoy and learn from. I wanted to connect my two loves, the artistry of hair styling and visual art. The way each artist conceptualized their work through different mediums, is truly what I envisioned Naturally You to be”.\n\nThe 3-day exhibit was made possible by Myavana and Carol's Daughter and featured a dynamic group of artists celebrating the freedom and pride associated with Black hair. “Gia, Johnny, and I were thrilled to bring UNTANGLED: Combing through the Roots of Black Hair to Miami Art Week for the first time. Working with these talented individuals who create amazing artwork that represents the celebration of beauty, resilience, and cultural pride through a unique perspective on the multifaceted world of not only Black hair but how we physically present ourselves overall,” said Jarvis DuBois, Co-curator.\" The artists who were included in the exhibition were Michael Booker, Lisa Brown, Olivia Bruce, Ralston Cyrus, Zoraye Cyrus, Ricky Day, Bria Edwards, Artiste Fletcher, Ricardo Osmondo Francis, Dustin Harewood, Omari Jesse, Delita Martin, Liz Miller, and Candace Tavares.\n\nDay two featured an artist talk moderated by Johnny Wright, with nine out of the fourteen available artists, and on day three, Carol's Daughter hosted a captivating live hair demonstration by statement hair artist Naeemah Lafond, followed by an engaging one-on-one conversation with Johnny Wright and Naeemah Lafond. The exhibit concluded with a private dinner hosted by Carol's Daughter, and special Jael Roumain owner of MUUR SWAG, a lifestyle fashion brand.\n\nThe Naturally You Tour has left an indelible mark, celebrating the beauty, diversity, and significance of natural hair within the Black community.
