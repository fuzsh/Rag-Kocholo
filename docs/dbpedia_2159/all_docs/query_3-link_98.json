Employment status directly affects a person's entitlement to employment insurance (EI) benefits under the Employment Insurance Act. It can also have an impact on how a worker is treated under other legislation such as the Canada Pension Plan and the Income Tax Act.\n\nThe facts of the working relationship as a whole decide the employment status.\n\nIn an employer-employee relationship, the payer is considered an employer and the worker an employee. Employers are responsible for deducting Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions, EI premiums, and income tax from remuneration, or other amounts they pay to their employees. Employers must remit these deductions along with their share of CPP contributions and EI premiums to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).\n\nAn employer who fails to deduct the required CPP contributions or EI premiums has to pay both the employer's share and the employee's share of any contributions and premiums owing, plus penalties and interest. For more employer information, go to Payroll.\n\nNote\n\nNon-arm's length relationship – If an employee is not dealing at arm's length with the employer, it is possible that their employment is not insurable under the Employment Insurance Act. For more information, read the interpretive article on this subject at CPP/EI Explained.\n\nIf the worker is a self-employed individual, they must operate a business and be engaged in a business relationship with the payer.\n\nFor more information, go to Businesses taxes.\n\nEmployment insurance for self-employed individuals\n\nSome self-employed individuals may be eligible for employment insurance special benefits by contributing to the plan.\n\nFor more information, visit Service Canada.\n\nSelf-employed individuals in Quebec may be eligible for benefits under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP). For more information, visit Revenu Québec.\n\nRequesting a ruling\n\nIf a worker or payer is not sure of the worker's employment status, either can ask the CRA for a ruling. A ruling shows whether a worker is an employee or self‑employed, and whether that worker's employment is pensionable or insurable.\n\nTo ask for a CPP/EI ruling, you can:\n\nlog in to My Business Account if you are a payer and select \"Request a CPP/EI Ruling\"\n\nlog in to My Account if you are a payer or a worker and select \"Request a CPP/EI Ruling\"\n\nask your authorized representative to request a ruling for you. They can log in to Represent a Client and select \"Request a CPP/EI Ruling\"\n\nwrite a letter or print and complete Form CPT1, Request for a CPP/EI Ruling – Employee or Self-Employed? and mail it to your designated tax services office\n\nNote\n\nThis guide does not replace a formal request for a ruling.\n\nTime limit for requesting a ruling\n\nA worker or a payer can request a ruling by June 29 of the year following the year to which the question relates. For example, if the employment took place in 2023, the ruling request has to be made no later than June 29, 2024. When June 29 falls on a Saturday or a Sunday, your request is considered on time if the CRA receives it or if it is postmarked on or before the next business day.\n\nRuling period that applies to a decision\n\nA ruling applies to a specific period or periods of employment. A decision letter will include the names of the worker and the payer, and whether the employment is pensionable or insurable, or both, for the period(s) of employment. Unless a decision is appealed, it is final.\n\nIf the terms and conditions of the employment change after the ruling is issued, and you do not know if the employment is pensionable or insurable, or both, you can ask for another ruling.\n\nEmployment status\n\nCertain factors have to be considered when deciding if a worker is an employee or a self-employed individual.\n\nThese factors differ if the contract is formed in the province of Quebec or in any other province or territory. Usually, the province or territory where the contract was formed will decide which set of factors to use.\n\nNote\n\nUse the appropriate factors for your situation based on where the contract was formed, unless the contract states something else. For example, the contract can state that if the worker and payer disagree about the contents of the contract, the contract will be interpreted under Quebec law (civil code), even though the contract was formed in Ontario (common law).\n\nDeciding a worker's employment status in a province or territory other than Quebec\n\nWhen the CRA examines whether a person is an employee or a self-employed individual, the key question to ask is whether the person is engaged to carry out services as a person in business on their own account, or as an employee. To do this, we examine the total relationship between the worker and the payer, using a two-step approach.\n\nStep 1\n\nThe CRA asks the worker and the payer what their intent was when they entered into the working arrangement. Did the two parties intend to enter into a contract of service (employer-employee relationship) or did they intend to enter into a contract for services (business relationship)?\n\nThe CRA needs to know how they defined their working relationship and why they defined it as such.\n\nSometimes the intention is clear and both parties are in agreement (common intent). Sometimes the intent can be found in a written agreement. Sometimes the two parties have a different understanding as to the status of their working relationship, in which case there is no common intent.\n\nTo decide the parties’ intentions, the CRA gets a copy of the contract, or testimony by the parties and examines the parties’ actions. Both parties’ intentions form part of the context of the employment that the CRA analyses.\n\nNote\n\nWorkers and payers can choose how they set up their affairs; however, the employment status they choose must reflect their working relationship. In other words, all of the facts, including the actual terms and conditions of employment, determine a worker's employment status, not just the intention.\n\nStep 2\n\nThe CRA asks the worker and the payer questions that will help us understand the working relationship and allow us to verify whether the intent of the parties is reflected in the facts.\n\nThese questions relate to the following elements:\n\nthe level of control the payer has over the worker's activities\n\nwhether the worker or payer provides the tools and equipment\n\nwhether the worker can subcontract the work or hire assistants\n\nthe degree of financial risk the worker takes\n\nthe degree of responsibility for investment and management the worker holds\n\nthe worker's opportunity for profit\n\nany other relevant factors, such as written contracts\n\nThe CRA looks at the answers separately for each element and then together.\n\nThe CRA considers whether they reflect the stated intention and decides if the actual working conditions are more consistent with a contract of service or with a contract for services.\n\nFactors to consider\n\nTo help you understand the process, the CRA explains each factor below and provides some indicators that show that the worker may be an employee or a self-employed individual.\n\nControl\n\nControl is the ability, authority, or right of a payer to exercise control over a worker concerning the manner in which the work is done and what work will be done.\n\nDegree of control or independence\n\nConsider the degree of control held by the payer or the degree of independence held by the worker.\n\nThe actual degree of control will vary with the type of work and the skills of the worker.\n\nDeciding the degree of control can be difficult when examining the employment of professionals such as engineers, doctors, and IT consultants. Because of their expertise and specialized training, they may need little or no specific direction in their daily activities. When examining the factor of control, it is necessary to focus on both the payer's control over the worker's daily activities and the payer's influence over the worker.\n\nPayer's right to exercise control\n\nIt is the right of the payer to exercise control that is relevant, not whether the payer actually exercises this right.\n\nIt is the control of a payer over a worker that is relevant and not the control of a payer over the end result of a product or service purchased.\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is an employee\n\nThe relationship is one of subordination. The payer will often direct, scrutinize, and effectively control many elements of how and when the work is carried out\n\nThe payer controls the worker with respect to both the results of the work and the method used to do the work\n\nThe payer chooses and controls the method and amount of pay. Salary negotiations may still take place in an employer-employee relationship\n\nThe payer decides what jobs the worker will do\n\nThe payer chooses to listen to the worker's suggestions but has the final word\n\nThe worker requires permission to work for other payers while working for this payer\n\nWhere the schedule is irregular, priority on the worker's time is an indication of control over the worker\n\nThe worker receives training or direction from the payer on how to do the work. The overall work environment between the worker and the payer is one of subordination\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is a self-employed individual\n\nA self-employed individual usually works independently\n\nThe worker does not have anyone overseeing their activities\n\nThe worker is usually free to work when and for whom they choose and may provide their services to different payers at the same time\n\nThe worker can accept or refuse work from the payer\n\nThe working relationship between the payer and the worker does not present a degree of continuity, loyalty, security, subordination, or integration, all of which are generally associated with an employer-employee relationship\n\nConsider if the worker owns and provides tools and equipment to accomplish the work. Contractual control of, and responsibility for, an asset in a rental or lease situation is also considered under this factor.\n\nWhat is relevant is the significant investment in the tools and equipment along with the cost of replacement, repair, and insurance. A worker who has made a significant investment is likely to retain a right over the use of these assets, diminishing the payer's control over how the work is carried out. In addition, such a significant investment may place the worker at a risk of a financial loss.\n\nNote\n\nTools and equipment can vary widely in terms of value and can include everything from wrenches and hammers, to specialized clothing, appliances, stethoscopes, musical instruments, computers, and vehicles such as trucks, and tractors.\n\nSelf-employed individuals often supply the tools and equipment required for a contract. As a result, the ownership of tools and equipment by a worker is more commonly associated with a business relationship.\n\nHowever, employees sometimes also have to provide their own tools. The courts have acknowledged that because a worker is required to provide tools of the trade, this does not in itself mean that the worker is a self-employed individual. For example, many skilled tradespeople such as auto mechanics have to supply their own tools, even if they are full-time employees.\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is an employee\n\nThe payer supplies most of the tools and equipment the worker needs. In addition, the payer is responsible for repair, maintenance, and insurance costs\n\nThe payer retains the right of use over the tools and equipment provided to the worker\n\nThe worker supplies the tools and equipment and the payer reimburses the worker for their use\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is a self-employed individual\n\nThe worker provides the tools and equipment needed for the work. In addition, the worker is responsible for the costs of repairs, insurance, and maintenance to the tools and equipment\n\nThe worker has made a significant investment in the tools and equipment and the worker retains the right over the use of these assets\n\nThe worker supplies their own workspace, is responsible for the costs to maintain it, and does substantial work from that site\n\nSubcontracting work or hiring assistants\n\nConsider if the worker can subcontract work or hire assistants. This factor can help decide a worker's business presence because subcontracting work or hiring assistants can affect their chance of profit and risk of loss.\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is an employee\n\nThe worker cannot hire helpers or assistants\n\nThe worker does not have the ability to hire and send replacements. The worker has to do the work personally\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is a self-employed individual\n\nThe worker does not have to carry out the services personally. They can hire another party to either do the work or help do the work, and pay the costs for doing so\n\nThe payer has no say in whom the worker hires\n\nFinancial risk\n\nConsider the degree of financial risk taken by the worker. Consider if there are any fixed ongoing costs incurred by the worker or any expenses that are not reimbursed.\n\nUsually, employees will not have any financial risk as any expenses will be reimbursed, and they will not have fixed ongoing costs.\n\nSelf-employed individuals, on the other hand, can have financial risk and incur losses because they usually pay fixed monthly costs even if work is not currently being done.\n\nEmployees and self-employed individuals may be reimbursed for business or travel expenses. Therefore, focus on the expenses that are not reimbursed by the payer.\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is an employee\n\nThe worker is not usually responsible for any operating expenses\n\nGenerally, the working relationship between the worker and the payer is continuous\n\nThe worker is not financially liable if they do not fulfil the obligations of the contract\n\nThe payer chooses and controls the method and amount of pay\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is a self-employed individual\n\nThe worker hires helpers to assist in the work. The worker pays the hired helpers\n\nThe worker does a substantial amount of work from their own workspace and incurs expenses relating to the operation of that workspace\n\nThe worker is hired for a specific job rather than an ongoing relationship\n\nThe worker is financially liable if they do not fulfil the obligations of the contract\n\nThe worker does not receive any protection or benefits from the payer\n\nThe worker advertises and actively markets their services\n\nResponsibility for investment and management\n\nConsider the degree of responsibility for investment and management held by the worker.\n\nIs the worker required to make any investment in order to provide the services?\n\nA significant investment is evidence that a business relationship may exist. You should also consider if the worker is free to make business decisions that affect their profit or loss.\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is an employee\n\nThe worker has no capital investment in the payer's business\n\nThe worker does not have a business presence\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is a self-employed individual\n\nThe worker has capital investment\n\nThe worker manages their staff\n\nThe worker hires and pays individuals to help do the work\n\nThe worker has established a business presence\n\nOpportunity for profit\n\nConsider whether the worker can realize a profit or incur a loss, as this indicates that a worker controls the business aspects of services rendered and that a business relationship likely exists. To have a chance of a profit and a risk of a loss, a worker has to have potential proceeds and expenses, and one could exceed the other.\n\nThis factor has to be considered from the worker's perspective, not the payer's. It is for the most part an assessment of the degree to which the worker can control their proceeds and expenses.\n\nEmployees normally do not have the chance of a profit and risk of a loss even though their remuneration can vary depending on the terms of their employment contracts. For example, employees working on a commission or piece-rate basis, or employees with a productivity bonus clause in their contract can increase their earnings based on their productivity. This increase in income is not normally viewed as a profit, as it is not the excess of proceeds over expenses.\n\nEmployees may have expenses directly related to their employment, such as automobile expenses, and board and lodging costs. Normally, expenses would not place employees at risk of incurring a loss because it is unlikely that the expenses would be greater than their remuneration.\n\nSelf-employed individuals normally have the chance of profit or risk of loss, because they have the ability to pursue and accept contracts as they see fit. They can negotiate the price (or unilaterally set their prices) for their services and have the right to offer those services to more than one payer. Self-employed individuals will normally incur expenses to carry out the terms and conditions of their contracts, and to manage those expenses to maximize net earnings. Self-employed individuals can increase their proceeds and/or decrease their expenses in an effort to increase profit.\n\nEmployees generally do not share in profits or suffer losses incurred by the payer's business.\n\nThe method of payment may help to decide if the worker has the opportunity to make a profit or incur a loss. In an employer-employee relationship, the worker is normally guaranteed a return for the work done and is usually paid on an hourly, daily, weekly, or similar basis.\n\nSimilarly, some self-employed individuals are paid on an hourly basis. However, when a worker is paid a flat rate for the work done, it generally indicates a business relationship, especially if the worker incurs expenses in doing the work.\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is an employee\n\nThe worker is not normally in a position to realize a business profit or loss\n\nThe worker is entitled to benefit plans that are normally offered only to employees. These include registered pension plans, and group accident, health, and dental insurance plans\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is a self-employed individual\n\nThe worker can hire a substitute and the worker pays the substitute\n\nThe worker is compensated by a flat fee and incurs expenses in carrying out the services\n\nDeciding a worker's employment status in the province of Quebec\n\nWhen the CRA examines whether a person is an employee or a self-employed individual in the province of Quebec, the CRA examines the relationship between the worker and the payer, using a three-step approach.\n\nStep 1\n\nThe CRA asks the worker and the payer what their intent was when they entered into the working arrangement. Did the two parties intend to enter into a contract of service (employer‑employee relationship) or did they intend to enter into a contract for services (business relationship)?\n\nThe CRA needs to know how they defined their working relationship and why they defined it as such.\n\nSometimes the intention is clear and both parties are in agreement (common intent). Sometimes the intent can be found in a written agreement. Sometimes the two parties have a different understanding of the status of their employment relationship, in which case there is no common intent.\n\nTo decide the parties' intentions, the CRA gets a copy of the contract, or testimony by the parties and examines the parties' actions. Both parties' intentions form part of the context of the employment that the CRA analyses.\n\nNote\n\nWorkers and payers can choose how they set up their affairs; however, the employment status they choose must reflect their working relationship. In other words, all of the facts, including the actual terms and conditions of employment, determine a worker's employment status, not just the intention.\n\nStep 2\n\nThe CRA looks to see if the employment meets the definition of a contract of employment or of a business contract (contract for services) defined in the Civil Code of Québec by considering the following factors:\n\ncarrying out the work\n\nremuneration\n\nrelationship of subordination\n\nIt is important to gather the facts and analyze them in light of the specific context of the employment and the intent of the parties.\n\nStep 3\n\nThe CRA compares each party's intentions with their actual working relationship. The CRA decides whether the conditions of the working relationship represent the status that the parties have chosen and that they are consistent with the definitions of the Civil Code of Québec.\n\nFactors to consider\n\nExamine the relationship between the worker and the payer by considering the factors outlined in Step 2.\n\nTo help you understand the process, the CRA explains each factor and provides some indicators to show whether a relationship of subordination exists.\n\nCarrying out the work\n\nWhether there is an employer-employee relationship or a business relationship, the worker has to do the work. It can be part-time or full-time for a specified or indeterminate period.\n\nRemuneration\n\nRemuneration means how a worker is paid. It includes all consideration and benefits that have a monetary value. Whether there is an employer-employee relationship or a business relationship, the worker will receive remuneration in exchange for work. The remuneration can be calculated by time, by the piece, or in another manner.\n\nRelationship of subordination\n\nThis factor helps distinguish the employer-employee relationship from a business relationship.\n\nThe relationship of subordination is the capacity, the authority, or the right of a payer to exercise control over the worker's activities and the manner in which the work is done.\n\nDegree of control or independence\n\nConsider the degree of control held by the payer or the degree of independence held by the worker.\n\nThe actual degree of control will vary with the type of work and the skills of the worker.\n\nDeciding the degree of control can be difficult when examining the employment of professionals such as engineers, doctors, and IT consultants. Because of their expertise and specialized training, they may require little or no specific direction in their daily activities. When examining the factor of control, it is necessary to focus on both the payer's control over the worker's daily activities and the payer's influence over the worker.\n\nPayer's right to exercise control\n\nIt is the right of the payer to exercise control that is relevant, not whether the payer actually exercises this right.\n\nIt is the control of a payer over a worker that is relevant and not the control of a payer over the end result of a product or service that they have purchased.\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is an employee\n\nThe payer directs and controls many elements of how the work is done (such as what, who, where, when, and how).\n\nThe payer controls the worker's absences, such as sick leave or vacation leave.\n\nThe payer controls the worker with respect to the results of the work and the method used to do the work.\n\nThe payer creates the work schedule and establishes the worker's rules of conduct.\n\nThe payer can impose disciplinary actions on a worker.\n\nThe worker has to do the work personally.\n\nThe worker has to remit activity reports to the payer.\n\nThe worker's activities are reserved to a single payer (exclusivity of services).\n\nThe worker receives training or direction from the payer on how to do the work.\n\nThe worker accepts being part of the payer's business to have the latter benefit from his work.\n\nThe parties have inserted a non-competition clause in their written contract.\n\nIndicators showing that the worker is a self-employed individual\n\nThe worker is usually free to work when and for whom they choose and may provide their services to different payers at the same time.\n\nThe worker does not have to carry out the services personally. They can hire another party to either do the work or help do the work.\n\nThe worker can generally choose the time and the manner in which the work will be done.\n\nThe worker does not need to be at the payer's premises.\n\nThe worker can accept or refuse work from the payer.\n\nThe working relationship between the payer and the worker does not present a degree of continuity, loyalty, security, subordination, or integration, all of which are generally associated with an employer-employee relationship.\n\nNote\n\nSince in certain working relationships it can be difficult to decide whether there is a relationship of subordination, the CRA can also take into consideration indicators used in common law, referred to above in Step 2 of the section \"Deciding a worker's employment status in a province or territory other than Quebec.\"\n\nFor more information on CPP/EI matters\n\nFor more information on the CPP/EI Rulings Program, go to Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Employment Insurance (EI) Rulings.\n\nHave you received a CPP/EI ruling\n\nIf you received a CPP/EI ruling, and if a worker’s employment has changed from either:\n\nnot pensionable to pensionable\n\nnot insurable to insurable\n\nor if, on the contrary, the employment has changed from either:\n\npensionable to not pensionable\n\ninsurable to not insurable\n\nThe CRA has information that could be of interest to you.\n\nTo find out more about the possible implications of a CPP/EI Ruling, go to Have you received a CPP/EI ruling\n\nFiling an appeal\n\nIf a CPP/EI ruling has been issued and the worker or payer does not agree with the decision, either party has the right to file an appeal within 90 days after being notified of the CPP/EI ruling.\n\nIf a CPP/EI payroll deductions assessment has been issued, the payer has the right to file an appeal within 90 days after being notified of that payroll assessment.\n\nHowever, if you receive a payroll assessment because your payment was not applied to your account correctly, before you file an appeal, the CRA recommends that you call or write to the tax services office or tax centre to discuss it. Many disputes are resolved this way and can save you the time and trouble of appealing.\n\nTo appeal a CPP/EI ruling decision or a payroll deductions assessment, you can:\n\nlog in to My Business Account if you are a business owner, and select “Register a formal dispute (Appeal)” for your payroll program account\n\nlog in to My Account if you are an individual, select “Register my formal dispute,” and choose “CPP/EI ruling” in the subject area\n\nlog in to Represent a Client. If you represent a business, select “Register a formal dispute (Appeal)” for a payroll program account. If you represent an individual, select “Register my formal dispute,” and then choose “CPP/EI ruling” in the subject area\n\nuse Form CPT100, Appeal of a Ruling Under the Canada Pension Plan and/or Employment Insurance Act, to appeal a CPP/EI ruling\n\nuse Form CPT101, Appeal of an Assessment Under the Canada Pension Plan and/or Employment Insurance Act, to appeal a payroll deductions assessment\n\nwrite to the chief of appeals at your tax services office explaining why you do not agree with the ruling or payroll deductions assessment and provide all relevant facts. Include a copy of the CPP/EI ruling letter or payroll deductions assessment. The addresses of our tax services offices and tax centres are available at Tax services offices and tax centres.\n\nFor more information on how to appeal a CPP/EI ruling decision or a payroll deductions assessment, see Booklet P133, Your Appeal Rights – Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance Coverage.\n\nCPP/EI Explained – Interpretive articles\n\nSeries of CPP/EI Explained articles for workers and employers on matters relating to CPP and EI.
