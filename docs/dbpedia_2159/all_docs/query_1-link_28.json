        "text": "short version:\n\nJack Wright is a saxophonist in the Philadelphia area, one of the originals of American free improvisation, and still actively touring. Now 81, he lived some diverse lives, as activist and academic, until settling into music full-time in 1979--free playing is all he's done since then. Now post-covid he is again touring in Europe (April 2023) and the US, where he is still the \"Johnny Appleseed of Free Improvisation,\" as guitarist Davey Williams called him. He started out in the free jazz direction, but by the late 90's found that boring and conventional; shifting gears a few times he is now playing sounds that few have heard before. His playing consists of distorted pitches, precise timing, intrusive multiphonics, sudden changes of direction, obscene animalistic sounds, and occasional \"real\" notes. He partners mostly with Zach Darrup, Ben Bennett, Evan Lipson, and Ron Stabinsky, his most current groups being Wrest, Minimal Disturbance, Roughhousing, and Never. He published a book in 2017, The Free Musics, sold to most of the free players in the US and many in Europe. He just released a book of mostly political critique, drawing on his background, Shaky Ground. For the books go here; for sounds, etc. see Spring Garden Music.\n\nexpanded:\n\nDescribed forty years ago as an \"undergrounder by design,\" Jack Wright is a veteran saxophone improviser based mainly in Philadelphia and living in nearby Easton PA. In 1979, after an academic career teaching at Temple University (European History) and activist politics, he returned to the instrument of his youth. Almost immediately he discovered free improv, virtually unknown at the time and still obscure. He is one of the few who have played this exclusively since then, one of the originals of the 80s era. He plays mostly on tour through the US and Europe in search of interesting partners and playing situations. Now at 80 he is still the \"Johnny Appleseed of Free Improvisation,\" as the late guitarist Davey Williams called him back in the 80s, continuing to inspire musicians, playing and organizing sessions and gigs with visiting and resident players old and new. His Spring Garden Music House has been around since 1977, for the past sixteen years housing only improvisers and providing space for sessions. In the early 00s it was the space for the No Nets he oganized.\n\nHe has avoided the standard career aimed at visibility and prestige, seeing it as a hindrance to musical growth. The partners he's preferred over the years have also been mostly unknown to the music press, and too numerous to list here. His current focus is sound-oriented, mostly associated the underground known as electronic noise music. His main partners the past several years have been Zach Darrup, guitar,Ben Bennett, percussion, Evan Lipson, double bass, and Ron Stabinsky. keyboards, the personnel of Wrest, Minimal Disturbance, Roughhousing, and Never.\n\nJack is what used to be called a \"musician's musician,\" yet unschooled in music, learning through interaction with partners and private discipline. He's said to have the widest vocabulary of any, and still expanding--leaping pitches, punchy, precise timing, the entire range of volume, intrusive and sculptured multiphonics, vocalizations, and obscene animalistic sounds. You'll hear the most conventional jazz sound for a second or two and \"post-electronic saxophone\" the next. His playing sums up his 40-plus years of improvising, from lyrical, Ornette-style free jazz at first, then hard-blasting and emotive, then the opposite of that--reduced, quiet playing around 2000. The past dozen years he's come back to more physically engaged playing, but with a phrasing and variable sound unique among sax players.\n\nIn 2017 he published, The Free Musics, which has sold around 900 copies, mainly to improvisers in the US through direct contact, and often on tour. In 2022 he published another book, Shaky Ground, which combines his self-questioning and life experiences with a historical analysis of the current situation, particularly the left today. His books are available from him, info at Spring Garden Editions.\n\nA reviewer for the Washington Post said, \"In the rarefied, underground world of experimental free improvisation, saxophonist Jack Wright is king.\"\n\nSee Spring Garden Music, for more information.\n\nThe resume:\n\nJACK WRIGHT\n\nAlto, soprano, tenor saxophones; piano\n\nBorn Pittsburgh PA in 1942 and grew up around Philadelphia and Chicago. He began playing saxophone in 1952 with private lessons; also singing in groups large and small through 1964, including a blue grass trio (playing washtub bass), which recorded an album, \"Undertaking Bluegrass.\" After this he ceased playing music. He attended Lafayette College in Easton PA, where he studied European history and literature and graduated 1964; Johns Hopkins University, MA in European history, 1973; taught history at CCNY in NY and then Temple U. 1967-72. When he was fired for lack of the Ph.D. he painted houses, worked on rehab construction crews, and worked as a handyman, picking up skills in an improvised fashion.\n\nFrom '69 to '75 or so he was involved in left politics, organizing mainly on a community level, then joining a left study group. When that came to an end, after a time of self-searching, he picked up the horn again, and in '79 began improvising freely on the saxophone and piano.\n\nAt the time, people thought it was impossible to play without a structure, so partners for this music were few. He sought them out in NY and the East Coast, traveled to the West Coast in '82, then in '83 began two month tours in Europe, which continued until 1986.\n\nIn the US his East Coast partners were Toshi Makihara, Jim Meneses, William Parker, and Todd Whitman. In Europe he performed with Hannes Bauer, Joe Sachse, Wigald Boning, Lars Rudolph, Wittwulf Malik, the late Peter Hollinger, Bernhard Arndt, and Andreas (now Max) Stehle, with whom he toured in Germany, England, Switzerland and Italy. In 1984 he began touring the US, either as soloist, with the Chicago dancer Bob Eisen, guitarist Chris Cochrane and the Shakin Rays of Chattanooga, and with his European partners, Stehle, Roger Turner, Malik, and Rudolph.\n\nIn this period of the eighties his music would today be classified as free jazz, very full and expressive. He was known for playing in places that had never been exposed to free improvisation, and encouraging young players everywhere, such that guitarist Davey Williams titled him the â€œJohnny Appleseed of free improvisation.\"\n\nWith his only vinyl record to date, \"Free Life, Singing,\" in 1983, he began a label, Spring Garden Music, which presents his own music and that of his partners.\n\nIn 1988 Wright moved to Boulder CO and began painting, revisited his private study of European literature and philosophy, and explored the psychology and spirituality he found in Boulder. In the nineties he began a journal, some of which is here; an early part of his journal was later included in Shaky Ground,. He was still practicing and playing regularly, and as a member of the local community of players he formed the Front Range Improvisers Orchestra, FRIO, and continued touring the US. In the late nineties there was a resurgence of interest in non-idiomatic free improvisation in the US, especially coming from Boston, but increasingly throughout the country. In 2000 Wright did an extensive tour of the West Coast with Boston soprano saxophonist Bhob Rainey, and recorded with him in three different groups. His music became often sound-oriented, using space, texture, and sustained tones, but always with a characteristic energy and lyrical musicality.\n\nHe moved back to the East Coast in 2003 to be closer to where improv was most resurgent, and now lives in Easton PA. He has worked to strengthen the free improv scene in Philadelphia by turning his former home there on Spring Garden St. into a residence for such players, where he goes regularly for sessions.\n\nWright has presented his music at most of the improv festivals in the US: four years at High Zero in Baltimore, several years at the Seattle Improv Festival, the SFALT and the Outsound New Music Summit, a festival in the Bay Area, the Autumn Uprising in Boston, and the Improvised and Otherwise Festival in Brooklyn. In 2005 he performed at the Museum of Modern Art in NY in a mini-festival, Relay, involving 13 American and European players. He performed as a soloist at the 2006 Irtijal Festival in Beirut; he and percussionist Andrew Drury performed at the 2007 N.O. (not only) Jazz Festival in Zagreb Croatia; and in 2008 in a trio with Olivier Toulemonde and Agnes Palier at the ContemporaneaMente Festival in Lodi Italy.\n\nIn 2017 he published, The Free Musics, which has sold around 900 copies, mainly to improvisers in the US through direct contact, and often on tour. Wright was interviewed by Cadence Magazine, ( p. 55-73) for that book. Then in 2022 he published another book, Shaky Ground, which combines his self-questioning and life experiences with a historical analysis of the current situation, particularly the left today. More information and availability of the books is at Spring Garden Editions. A collection of his writing on music, from the eighties to the present is here.\n\nA reviewer for the Washington Post said, \"In the rarefied, underground world of experimental free improvisation, saxophonist Jack Wright is king.\"\n\nBeginning in 2002 and until recent years Wright's Europe tours aimed to find new partners. Those with whom he was playing most consistently are Christine Abdelnour, sax, Paris; Pascal Battus, Paris; Alberto Braida, piano, Milan; Sebastian Cirotteau, tpt, Toulouse France; Phil Durrant, computer, violin, London; Michael Griener, drums, Berlin; Grundik Kasyansky, electronics, London; Hans Kocher, bass cl., Switzerland; Urs Leimgruber, saxes, Lucerne Switz; Andrea Neumann, inside piano, Berlin; Agnes Palier, voice, Rambouillet France; Eve Risser, Paris; Stephan Rives, soprano sax, Beirut Lebanon; Sharif Sehnaoui, guitar, Beirut; Fabrizio Spera, drums, Rome; Olivier Toulemonde, percussion, France; Guillaume Viltard, bass, Lyons; Sabine Vogel, flute, Berlin, and Christopher Williams, double bass, Berlin.\n\nIn this period h e frequently organized tours with Europeans in the US--Battus, Braida, Durrant, Griener, Neumann, Palier, Spera, and Vogel.\n\nHis major tours of the past two decades in Europe are here, and in North America are below, in retrograde order:\n\nWrest in the Southeast, July 2022; a mostly solo tour in NM and CO, Feb. 2020; Minimal Disturbance, Jan. 2020; solo and collaborations in Midwest, Dec. 2019; Never in Midwest, Sept. 2019; Roughhousing in Canada and US, Sept. 2018; Roughhousing on West Coast, April 2018; Roughhousing in the Midwest, spring 2017;with Bob Marsh in the Midwest, April 2016; with Zach Darrup, Nov. 2015, Wrest in Midwest and Southeast, June 2014, Sept. 2014, April 2013, Sept. 2012; with various partners in the West Coast, Fall 2010; with Bob Marsh, 2010 and 2011; with Pascal Battus on the East Coast, 2010; the Northwest, Feb. 2010; with Fabrizio Spera and Albert Braida on the East Coast, 2009; with Michael Johnsen, midwest; with Fabrizio Spera and Gust Burns in the Northwest; with Andrea Neumann and Stephane Rives on the East Coast (the Snowball Tour, 2008, joining also with 11 other musicians); with French soprano sax player Michel Doneda and percussionist Tatsuya Nakatani (From Between) in the US twice, France, and Japan, 2003-2007 (30 performances); with Agnes Palier and Olivier Toulemonde on the East Coast; with Carol Genetti, vocalist, and Jon Mueller, perc.

Chattanooga (TN) Pulse\n\nWhat is notable about the Wrightsâ€™ approach to sound is the way it makes audible the physical confrontation of player and instrument. In fact, much of this is music that directly signals its origin in the body. The physicality of sound productionâ€”for example the inhalation and exhalation of the breath, the undertow of voice and the sonic signature of the lips which are so prominent in Couldâ€”makes itself felt at various points throughout the set. Daniel Barbiero, AMN Reviews\n\n\" The two musicians share a language comprised of staccato passages, breathy space, and intense workouts, that while unpredictable and full of surprises, is imbued with meaning and understanding....nothing like I had ever heard before.\" by Paul Acquaro, Free Jazz Blog\n\n(At a performance in Albuquerque NM) \"The two men fed off each other; lost in their own world. [I was] impressed by the seemingly accidental, subtle coordination between the two instruments. When Jack went one way, Ben went the other, like they were anticipating the next move and knew exactly how to counteract it.\" Patrick DeBonis, Rave Deaf\n\nOVER THE TRANSOM: \"Hell & Bunny\" sounds like something you might come across over at engrish.com, but in fact it's an improv duo consisting of cellist Hans Buetow and percussionist Ben Hall (I'm not sure who's hell and who's bunny but I guess it doesn't matter), who might be more familiar to readers as two thirds of Graveyards, with ol' Wolf Eye himself John Olson. On this splendid CDR release on the Alberta-based Bug Incision imprint they're joined by another prowling wolf of American free music, saxophonist Jack Wright, and it's the most impressive Wright release I've heard since the two trio dates with Michel Doneda and Tatsuya Nakatani, from between (SOSEditions, 2003) and No Stranger To Air (Sprout, 2006). At the turn of the century, Jack Wright took a decisive step (every step Jack takes is decisive) into lowercase territory, generously acknowledging the influence of Bhob Rainey, but throughout the decade his playing, especially solo, has gradually been getting more combative again â€“ though it's nowhere near as fiery as it was back when he started out in the early 80s. On Over The Transom, Hall's soft mallets and Buetow's elegant micromelodies and delicate pizzicati pull him back into more restrained territory, but you can tell he's just itching to burst into flames. Wright has always taken the line of most resistance as a player (I still think he should team up with his English namesake Seymour), exposing himself to as much risk as he can find. Just as well he's not a Wall Street trader. Listen to how he jams the horn against his thigh and really goes for â€“ and gets! â€“ those awkward multiphonics, just when the music is quiet enough to show up the tiniest mistake. This stuff is as poised as gagaku, as focused as shodo and as intense as butoh.\n\nDan Warburton, Paris Transatlantic, 2009\n\nAS IS: Decades ago, before Wire year zero, I wandered into a London record store, Honest Jon's, then located off Charing Cross Road, where a solo bass disc by Dave Holland was on the player. \"That's far out,\" I remarked to Wire founder Anthony Wood, working behind the counter. \"No, it's near in,\" he retorted. Even Anthony couldn't describe As Is as near in. Its three live tracks, two on soprano and one on alto, are uncompromising solo sax improv. Jack Wright left music in the mid-60's for radical politics. Returning in the late 70's to free jazz, by the milennium he was playing free improv with Bhob Rainey. If an improviser is producing tones at all on saxophone, it's hard to avoid a jazz element, and while the alto track starts out with noise, there's a moment when Wight is almost \"soloing\" on \"Three Little Words\". Raw, visceral, urgent, his music demands to be heard.\n\n--Andy Hamilton, \"Jazz and Improv\", The Wire, Dec. 2006\n\nUP FOR GRABS: There is much to like in Jack Wright's mature improvisations; the first feeling is one of \"warmth\": even at his most squealing corrosive, his soprano holds on to a nicely contoured permutation of fluted harmonics, sublingual contortions and analytic use of multiphonics, halfway through controlled stabilization and total fluster. Jack's soloist approach tends to a versatile evisceration of chosen parts, a monologue where larval hissing and note splitting are central for the exaltation of air's role in this beautiful gathering of physical imagery. Notes and instrumental noises pour out in a deconsecration of useless sax gadgetry, hiding after their own deviated scoff to make one think about the many and one ways musicians could use to reverse immoral attitudes towards sound; people like Wright could deliver us from this impurity.\n\n--Massimo Ricci, touching extremes\n\nJack Wright is bright, his playing powerful: These qualities forge an engaging combination. For the most part, his musicianship inhabits the extremes: Usually not the extremes of Jazz, but the extremes of free improvisation. While Wright is capable technically of playing almost anything on his saxes, he has of late chosen to pursue what he terms a \"more feminine approach,\" where the focus is on pure sound, often (but not always) filtered by unabashed minimalism. Wright is a master solipsist; a fierce individualist in the tradition of Howard Roark, exuding inner strength while seeking or affirming objective truths...this is one of Wright's most esoteric solo ventures; and for those few who are likely to appreciate it, one of his most curious recordings.\n\n---Steve Loewy, Cadence Magazine, April 2005"
