        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Paramount+ is hangin’ tough with its latest music documentary.\n\nThe streamer has lined up a new feature doc about boy bands such as New Kids On The Block, Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC and 98 Degrees that dominated the field in the 90s and early 2000s\n\nThe untitled doc has some boy band experience behind it. It is produced by Johnny Wright and Van Toffler.\n\nWright started out as tour manager for New Kids on the Block before managing Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake. Toffler, who is CEO of Gunpowder & Sky, which is producing with MTV Entertainment Studios, spent 28 years at MTV, including as President of Viacom Media Networks Music & Logo Group between 2008 and 2016, when it played music videos, many of which were by these artists.\n\nTamra Davis, who helmed movies such as Billy Madison and Half Baked, will direct.\n\nThe doc will dig deep into the love, pain and tears of joy of the boy band era with interviews from the key players. It features access to the music, band members and personalities as well as archive footage.\n\nIt is Paramount+’s latest music doc from Gunpowder & Sky, which made I Wanna Rock: The ‘80s Metal Dream and yacht rock doc Sometimes When We Touch.\n\n“The ’90s boy band era made an indelible impact and will be forever woven into the pop culture landscape. Boy bands remain bonafide global sensations to this day, as seen in the fan frenzy heard around the world during *NSYNC’s on-stage reunion at this year’s VMAs and the ever-spreading domination of K-Pop’s biggest groups like BTS, Stray Kids and TXT,” said Bruce Gillmer, President of Music, Music Talent, Programming & Events, Paramount and Chief Content Officer, Music, Paramount+. “We’re thrilled to continue our partnership with Van and Gunpowder & Sky, harnessing the magic and nostalgia this golden age of boy band culture continues to elicit for the legions of fans across generation and the world.”\n\n“The ’90s boy band era was an extraordinary chapter in music where harmonies and beats came together, along with talented vocal artists who captivated the hearts of millions worldwide,” added Wright. “Their music spoke to the dreams, aspirations and emotions of the fans, creating a bond that transcended borders and language. To this day, the boy bands continue to inspire, uplift and unite – reminding us of a great time that will forever hold a special place in our hearts.”\n\nToffler added, “If you think back to groups like The Jackson 5, who paved the way for boy bands, this music has dominated the charts for decades, but there’s always been a stigma attached. The reality is, these are insanely talented guys who led the requests each week when I was running TRL in the ’90s and early 2000s. And, just when we all think the fervor for boy bands has dissipated, One Direction or BTS emerge, and their disciples like Harry Styles and Justin Timberlake overtake pop culture.”"
