        "text": "Paramount+, already home to various music documentaries such as I WANNA ROCK: THE ’80s METAL DREAM and Sometimes When We Touch, has just announced that it will be producing another music documentary, this time aimed at millennials.\n\nDirected by Tamra Davis and produced by music manager Johnny Wright and Gunpowder & Sky CEO Van Toffler, both of whom were instrumental in creating the most popular music sensations of the 1990s and 2000s, the new, as-yet-untitled documentary will dig deep into the history and development of boy bands such as NSYNC, the Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees.\n\n“The ’90s boy band era was an extraordinary chapter in music where harmonies and beats came together, along with talented vocal artists who captivated the hearts of millions worldwide,” said music manager Johnny Wright.\n\n“Their music spoke to the dreams, aspirations and emotions of the fans, creating a bond that transcended borders and language. To this day, the boy bands continue to inspire, uplift and unite – reminding us of a great time that will forever hold a special place in our hearts.”\n\nThe film will also illustrate how the boy band era impacted pop culture forever, featuring new interviews as well as archival footage. Boy bands remain popular to this day, as was recently demonstrated during NSYNC’s VMA on-stage reunion and the overall domination of K-Pop.\n\n“We’re thrilled to continue our partnership with Van and Gunpowder & Sky, harnessing the magic and nostalgia this golden age of boy band culture continues to elicit for the legions of fans across generation and the world,” said Bruce Gillmer, President of Music, Music Talent, Programming & Events and Paramount+ Chief Content Officer."
