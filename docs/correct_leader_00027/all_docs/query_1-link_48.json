        "text": "Dr. James Callaghan\n\nSenior International Officer\n\nAssistant Vice-President for International Education\n\nDirector of the International Education Center\n\njames.callaghan@gcsu.edu\n\nAn accomplished and innovative international administrator and educator with over three decades of global leadership experience, including seven years of university teaching in Rome, Italy, Dr. Callaghan has institution-wide responsibility for the leadership, management, coordination, and development of international programs at Georgia College & State University. He has established and managed overseas satellite campuses and dual-degree and study abroad programs, plus teaching and research opportunities for faculty, throughout the world. Dr. Callaghan's vision for the university - and the community and region - positions GCSU as genuinely engaged with the world, and the world engaged with it. Dr. Callaghan was an early pioneer of programming - including internet-based programming - that connects students to their academic majors and interests, while also providing important international pre-professional experience, internships, and service opportunities. He has written numerous book reviews and essays about international education - particularly with regard to increased access for under-represented and disadvantaged populations - and recently co-edited a multi-national, multi-author volume on curriculum theory and pedagogy in international higher education. Dr. Callaghan is the holder of a doctorate in the history of art from Temple University, and M.A. and B.A. degrees in that discipline (plus work in philosophy) from Michigan State University. His current research is in the semiotics of art, and the origins, development, and influence of 13th-century Italian painting.\n\nJason Wynn\n\nAssistant Director of International Student & Scholar Services\n\njason.wynn@gcsu.edu\n\nJason Wynn, Assistant Director of International Student and Scholar Services, manages admissions for international students at GCSU and facilitates their immigration and cultural acclimation needs. Jason is the popular instructor of a course on American culture at GCSU, and has received numerous awards and recognitions from GCSU for his outstanding service, mentoring, and care for the many international students that come to GCSU.\n\nDuring his undergraduate years, Jason studied abroad at the La Universidad de Vigo in Vigo, Spain and La Universidad de las Americas in Puebla, Mexico. Before completing his graduate work he served as an intern for Habitat for Humanity Costa Rica and instructed English as a Second Language in North Carolina.\n\nJason moved to Georgia from North Carolina, where he completed an M.A. in International Studies at East Carolina University. Additionally, he holds a B.S. in Psychology with a second major in Spanish.\n\nMore than anything, Jason loves to travel!\n\nSusie Ramage\n\nInternational Admissions Counselor\n\nsusie.ramage@gcsu.edu\n\nSusie Ramage, the International Admissions Counselor, assists with international student recruitment, international admissions for both undergraduate and graduate programs, and is also involved with international programming. She is a co-advisor of the International Club - an organization composed of both international and domestic students interested in cross-cultural experiences - that is one the largest and most active student organizations at Georgia College. Ms. Ramage has received numerous awards and recognitions from GCSU for her outstanding service to - and care for - the international students that come to GCSU and Milledgeville.\n\nSusie is an alumna of GCSU and holds a B.S. in Community Health. She spent a good portion of her life living and working in the nearby city of Warner Robins, and later moved to Milledgeville. Prior to coming to GCSU, Susie worked at the Oconee Regional Medical Center.\n\nIn her free time, Susie enjoys spending time with her family and friends, and traveling.\n\nAriana Youmans\n\nStudy Abroad Advisor\n\nariana.youmans@gcsu.edu\n\nAriana Youmans is a proud GCSU Alum who has moved back to Georgia after 10 years of living in Ireland. It was while on her Study Abroad trip to London that she first visited Ireland and knew that it would one day become her home. Since that first international trip to England, Ariana has visited nearly 20 countries, some multiple times over, and has made friends and connections all around the world. It is through her love of travel, her interest in diversity and inclusion, and her own firsthand experiences of Study Abroad that she advises and supports GCSU students seeking to enliven their educational experiences, while also expanding their perspectives of the world.\n\nWhile at GCSU, Ariana double-majored in Psychology and Criminal Justice, studied Psychology at University College London, and later earned her GCSU Masterâ€™s Degree in Criminal Justice. It was due to having been a recent graduate that she was able to obtain her Working Holiday Authorisation and move to Ireland full-time.\n\nSandy Moore\n\nOffice Coordinator\n\nsandra.moore@gcsu.edu\n\nSandy joined the International team in 2016 after leaving the banking industry, and handles the unit's complex financial and technical details. She supervises the student staff, and assists with general inquires for international student admissions and study abroad programs, plus data entry and general office operations. She enjoys learning about the world through GCSU's international students and from returned study abroad students. Her favorite past-time is outdoors hiking, and camping with her friends and family."
