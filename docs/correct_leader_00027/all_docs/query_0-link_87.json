        "text": "Theresa May will officially finish her time as UK prime minister later today.\n\nThis has got us wondering about what Mrs May will do next.\n\nPoliticians have gone on to do all sorts of different activities after their time in office.\n\nRead on to find out a bit more about what some have gone on to do.\n\nSir Winston Churchill is one of the most famous British prime ministers of the 20th Century.\n\nHe was prime minister from 1940-1945 and again between 1951 and 1955.\n\nHe remained as an MP for nine years after leaving Downing Street for the last time in 1955, but that wasn't all that he did.\n\nHe enjoyed painting and did a lot of travelling too. In 2014, one of his paintings called The Goldfish Pool at Chartwell - which he painted in 1932, before taking up the top job in UK politics - sold for almost Â£1.8m at auction.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, he also produced a four-volume work called A History of the English-Speaking Peoples.\n\nDavid Cameron was the prime minister before Theresa May took up the job.\n\nHe resigned after the UK voted to leave the European Union in 2016.\n\nIn April 2017, it was announced that he had installed a designer shed in his garden, in which he planned to write a book.\n\n\"My children want to use it as a Wendy house,\" he said. \"I want to use it as a book-writing room and my son wants it as an alternative bedroom. So, quite a lot of competition!\"\n\nThe shed apparently has a wood-burning stove and sofa bed inside, so it certainly sounds like a cosy place to write a memoir.\n\nGeorge Osborne wasn't prime minister but he was an important politician in the cabinet, as he had the job of chancellor - the government's main minister in charge of financial issues like tax.\n\nHe was removed from this position after six years in the job when Mrs May took over from David Cameron as the new prime minister, but he remained a member of Parliament for Tatton in the north-west of England.\n\nIn March 2017, it was announced that he would be taking up a new job - editor of the newspaper the London Evening Standard.\n\nHe said it was a \"great honour\" to do the job, after having ambitions when he was younger to become a journalist.\n\nPoliticians have gone on to have fun in perhaps unexpected ways after their time in office too.\n\nFormer shadow chancellor and labour politician Ed Balls made a name for himself as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing back in 2016!\n\nHe survived 10 weeks in the competition, making headlines with his comical routines alongside professional partner Katya Jones - especially the unforgettable performance of Gangnam Style.\n\nHe's not the only politician to enter the ballroom, though.\n\nAnn Widdecombe, who is currently serving as a member of the European Parliament, has also appeared on the show.\n\nBut this isn't the only entertainment show on which politicians have made an appearance.\n\nFormer Conservative MP Edwina Currie entered the jungle as a contestant on I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here back in 2014.\n\nSimilarly, James Callaghan - who was prime minister from 1976 to 1979 - stayed on as leader of the Labour Party until 1980.\n\nHe resigned shortly after and later became a life peer in the House of Lords.\n\nHe published his autobiography Time and Chance in 1987.\n\nCallaghan was the only leader in the 20th Century to hold each of the four big offices of state: chancellor of the Exchequer, home secretary, foreign secretary and prime minister."
