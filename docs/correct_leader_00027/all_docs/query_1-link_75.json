        "text": "Item Information\n\nTitle:\n\nInterview with James Callaghan, 1987\n\nDescription:\n\nJames Callaghan, Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1976-1979. In the interview he describes some of the issues, disagreements and personal dynamics that arose at several NATO summits, particularly the London Summit of May 1977 and the Guadalupe Summit of January 1979. At the latter meeting, difficulties grew out of Carters unrealistic hopes that the Europeans would support U.S. policy with a unified view, whereas the British, French and Germans each had their own approaches to the subjects of arms control and dealing with the Soviet Union. Asked about the relationship between President Carter and German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, Mr. Callaghan describes Schmidts growing disillusionment with Washingtons economic policies, and comments on the two leaders different personal temperaments. He denies that Schmidt lost respect for Carter. He goes on to describe both men in positive terms. On nuclear policy, Mr. Callaghan recalls Schmidts October 1977 speech calling into question the reliability of the U.S. nuclear umbrella over Europe. He describes the SALT II process, explaining the views of the main European countries, and notes that England would have been willing to deploy U.S. nuclear weapons on its territory in the absence of an agreement from Moscow that would withdraw Soviet weapons behind the lines of Europe. He discusses the question of replacing Polaris missiles with Tridents, describes his views about the flexible response doctrine and notes his support for the current INF treaty. He admits that he did not foresee that difficulties that faced center-left administrations in Europe over the Euromissile crisis. Mr. Callaghan talks about developments since both he and President Carter left office in 1980-1981. He notes that changing leaderships can bring great swings in international relations and in public opinion, voices his belief that a steadier course would be more beneficial, especially in dealing with the Soviet Union on arms control. He recalls one of his favorite slogans in the arena of international affairs: Our relationship with the Soviet Union should be to cooperate where we can, and compete where we must, recognizing that the systems are different.\n\nInterviewee:\n\nCallaghan, James, 1912-2005\n\nDate:\n\nNovember 26, 1987\n\nFormat:\n\nFilm/Video\n\nLocation:\n\nWGBH\n\nCollection (local):\n\nWGBH Open Vault\n\nSeries:\n\nWar and Peace in the Nuclear Age\n\nSubjects:\n\nTrident (Weapons systems)\n\nNeutron bomb\n\nNuclear disarmament\n\nNuclear arms control\n\nPershing (Missile)\n\nReagan, Ronald\n\nSS-4 Missile\n\nIntermediate-range ballistic missiles\n\nBrezhnev, Leonid Il'ich, 1906-1982\n\nGreat Britain\n\nF-111 (Jet fighter plane)\n\nLondon Economic Summit (1984)\n\nGelb, Leslie H.\n\nInternational relations\n\nFlexible response (Nuclear strategy)\n\nSS-5 Missile\n\nEuromissiles\n\nSS-20 Missile\n\nCruise missiles\n\nPolaris (Missile)\n\nNuclear weapons\n\nStrategic Arms Limitation Talks II\n\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization\n\nGiscard d'Estaing, Valery, 1926-\n\nCarter, Jimmy, 1924-\n\nSoviet Union.
