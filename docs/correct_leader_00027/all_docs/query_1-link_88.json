Callaghanâ€™s address was on his late friend, Hubert Humphrey, and their similar politics.\nCallaghan was born in 1912. He entered the British Civil Service in 1929 as a tax officer. He was elected to Parliament in 1945 as a Labor Party member, and he has held a Parliamentary seat for 36 years. Callaghan has also served as Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, and he played a key role in negotiating Britain's membership in the Common Market. He was elected Prime Minister in 1976. After leaving that office, he was reelected leader of Britain's Labor Party. He stepped down from that role in 1980.",

        "text": "It was a remarkable thing. You know that a man like Hubert Humphrey coming from a state in the very middle of the of the United States not from the fashionable Eastern Seaboard or from California should have become known internationally and the way that he was because of his great qualities and it's against this background for this reason that I accepted your very kind invitation to address Reflections to you on this subject. Now, I must say that in the course of all my many conversations with Hubert Humphrey. I never remember discussing any profound theories of leadership with him. Of course, we gossiped incense Cecily when we met that's a favorite pastime of politicians whenever they had the chance. We talked about the pressures of the job. We talked about the conflicting influences. We talked about the problems that we faced us. We talked about the responses of the media. We talked about the attitude of our supporters. Most of all, I suppose we we gossiped about our fellow politicians when they weren't there and there's nothing more enjoyable than that, but I must say to you that I don't think Hubert approached political leadership as a theoretical exercise that is not to in any way denigrate the studies that are now going on. I think they're very valuable, but Hubert Humphrey always spoke from the heart. He had a simple faith in social justice. He believed. Perhaps a slightly unpopular belief today and that is why he might have been a little out of date as I am now out of date in politics. He believed that government existed to help the people and especially the poor he believed that political leadership was about fighting against unemployment and poverty. But one thing marked him out, he was never content just to denounce he believed in legislative leadership and to achieve success. He cultivated a practiced sophistication in political judgment combined with a Simplicity about political ends. He didn't agree with those who were so absolute in their political demands that they never compromised. There are times. He said there are times when it's better to lose than to be partially successful. But to make a habit of losing in the name of a bottle principal or liberal conviction is to fail to govern and to demonstrate incapacity to persuade and convince them develop a majority. But on the other hand, he never lost sight of the need for vision. He quoted a remark made by his father that before the fact is the dream and he held true to that even while he wrote his achievements Brick by Brick as he said and I'm delighted to see that his son here tonight is carrying on that great tradition. He opposed the politics of fear those who would use differences of race or Creed to climb to leadership buy-in flaming people's prejudices. Now you may have realized by now that I'm recording Hubert Humphreys political leadership at such length because his approach Make such a great appeal to me and I therefore can do no better than to hold him up as an example. And again, I'm delighted that a state like Minnesota should have produced not only Hubert Humphrey but someone who I have got to know in more recent years of Walter Mondale Fritz Mondale who was followed in his footsteps. And oh I believe is destined yet to climb to even greater Heights in the United States now, obviously Hubert Humphrey represented one type of leadership, but it'd be clear to you from what Harlan Cleveland has just told us that there are other types that can be just as effective before I refer to them. One further personal word, which you already have deduced from what I've said, I suppose it is possible to learn from text books and teachers how to practice the techniques of leadership though. I can't claim I've ever done so or indeed that I've ever reflected much on it. No doubt. I learned unconsciously when I was a young man from observing the way in which the political Giants of my youth handled the problems of the thirties and the forties and certainly an adult life. I guess. I've been continuing the process of unconscious learning by my addiction to political biography which Speaking personally. I always find out early absorbing nevertheless and here I know I shall incur hardens displeasure. I've never felt that I required to make a systematic study of the art of political leadership that would be perfectly open to him to retort that. I have been a much better leader if I had done I can only claim in extenuation that when Harlan Cleveland sent me this lesson to do that. I read my first and only book on leadership. It was an excellent study by James MacGregor Burns, but I found it in my untutored ignorance. I had luckily or instinctively been doing much of what he said I ought to do now, I believe and I just make this point that many of my colleagues and the British Labour movement would say that their experience was similar, especially if they've emerged from the shop floor or came to Industrial or political leadership through the Trade union movement or sprang into Parliament as a result of being active in their local constituencies. We were unselfconscious unselfconscious. When we launched out on our first fluttering leadership flights. We learned how to fly by doing it. I don't know whether a bird could learn to fly in any other way, but to most birds as to most leaders I think doing it comes naturally. So how does a political leader emerge as I see it? The best leaders have a compulsion to begin because they cherish a cause which must be fulfilled a goal that must be reached notwithstanding any difficulties on the way or the conflicts. Disagreements that they will involve themselves in some indeed may not even care for these disputes and disagreements, but they still themselves to endure it because they believe their cause is greater than the unpleasantness. They have to endure others, of course rejoice in the battle. That's true of most of us, but whatever that type they feel a lick between themselves and their fellow men and women so that together they unite in a collective purpose to fulfill their joint objective. And these conditions are equally true at any level whether the issue is a small local problem relatively small except to the people concerned. For example, where a new Road in a locality should be cited or whether it's a great issue with national and indeed International repercussions, like the future use of nuclear power or were Power Station should be cited. It's true either way and it is my experience. The coals will bring the man or woman of conviction and having identified themselves and taking the first steps. They'll find themselves propelled further along the road by the supporters with a widening of their Horizons as they find other problems moving up on them and it is at that stage. They have to be care for not to lose touch course be wrong for me to suggest that every leader joins his party because he's imbued with a burning belief. It's not been unknown in Britain. For example, I don't speak of your country for some balusters and lawyers to stand for Parliament because by becoming members of parliament, they'd have a better chance in due course after a period of service to their party to resume their careers at the bar at a higher level high court judge. For example, my don't tarnish all political lawyers with the same brush. I know many members of the bar who are utterly sincere in their political belief. And there's another group. I've come across who used have used membership of the House of Commons for a period of useful hack work on behalf of their parties as a stepping stone to a peerage in the House of Lords. Well, that's some people's ambition. Not everybody's Harold MacMillan as far as I was concerned another British prime minister gave the final word on whether he wished to go to the House of Lords as all prime ministers are entitled to do when they see sand finish. He said when you have Strode the boards at Drury Lane, why should you descend to a third-rate Repertory company? But I am not speaking of these people who in Max Weber's Max Weber as words live off Politics as distinct from living for politics. And as soon as our true political leader has been propelled by his supporters into what is a lonely role. He will find us Hubert Humphrey said that he faces conflict and he was make choices. He may have to settle as Hubert says for less than he thinks right and that is what most leaders most of us do but there is another type of leader a very few for whom conflict and choice present. No dilemma they are men of single vision and unswerving principle. They are also by that same token, very rare creatures, perhaps no more than one in every generation. They are men who ignore what is possible and go on to him go on to prove that the impossible can be achieved such a man was High in vitamin who I knew when I was a very young man a Jew without whom the state of Israel might not exist today a man of whom Isaiah Berlin wrote that he was a man who made the improbable happen. What better verdicts could any leader want than that gandhiji was another a man of immense model courage and therefore of moral power in his struggle to lead the Indian people to Freedom. I want to poke what morarji Desai who was the Prime Minister of India and a great contemporary and colleague of gandy's who has spread to a deed whose life has spanned not only gandy's but also was prime minister of India when I was prime minister of Britain and we discussed this many times and morarji Desai. Mrs. Gandhi's immediately predecessor wrote this about gandhiji. It was easy for the masses to understand guns at you because he spoke in their language he lived as they lived a life of utter Simplicity and succeeded in enlisting their participation in the struggle for Freedom. He gathered workers and created leaders and was influenced by the moon through such dialogues. He brought about a broad unanimity. Now for me that passage is definitive. It is a definitive statement of that immense power and persuasiveness that is given to the leadership of a nobleman who possesses a single vision. I'll take you through it again. That's short paragraph contains six important precepts one gandg spoke in language. His followers could understand. Secondly. He took part in dialogues with them. Thirdly. He was influenced by what was said by them in those dialogues forth. He lived a life of utter Simplicity as they did five by so doing he enlisted their participation in his struggle for freedom for India and six in doing that. He achieved a broad unanimity of purpose among. I can only say to any putative leader go and do thou likewise if you can. Naturally, I asked myself. Where does Winston Churchill stand in this Gallery? He too was an inspirational leader in 1940. But unlike High invites Minore. Or gandg he didn't call us to some new crusade in Britain what he did as I can testify was to gather up in himself the spirit of Britain in 1940. He didn't seek to change the future as those two had done. He defended the present. That is not to underwrite his achievement at the time of Dunkirk. He articulated and invoked the innermost feelings of the British people like millions of other young people in Britain at that time. I felt passionately that there was no way in which the British people would ever surrender to Hitler and to the Nazis and Churchill at that time was our voice day after day he put our Defiance into Unforgettable words. He performed a magnificent service at that time not only for Britain but to the whole world. But his role was different his task as he would have felt was to preserve and conserve I didn't become Prime Minister. He said to preside over the dissolution of the British Empire, but once Hitler was defeated history overtook him. He was not correct about that, but that should never allow any of us who were young in those days to forget that the occasion produced the ma'am. Now these were inspirational leaders. We can add others. I add a great American leader a man more universally acclaimed outside America than inside in the 1930s Franklin Roosevelt and I'll say to this new generation who never knew him. Why some of us have a lifelong affection for America dating from his leadership in the days when we were young and first became politically aware. It was just for this reason whatever his defects and is false. It was because he made America seemed to us the natural champion of democracy of freedom and of social justice, when do when it was under attack from both the Nazis and the Communists from Hitler and from stallion in the 1930s, and I imagine that the present-day generation although they have read about it won't really feel it as we felt it certainly in Europe and in Britain it seemed at times as though the choice was between communism and fascism. There was no Third Way, of course many of us rejected that and it was we who looked to Roosevelt and we he gave us inspiration and faith. That is a role that America. must always continue to do men such as Roosevelt Abraham Lincoln my own fellow Countryman David Lloyd George, they conveyed to their fellow men and women that they understood them and and their instinctive desires and this is part of the art of leadership and I use the word art those I've spoken of of course carried it much further than mere inspiration because true leadership lies in combining an understanding of your fellow men and women with the skill to lead them along powers that reflect their true interests, even if these seem to be opposed to their short term demands, Not many of us in political leadership succeed in doing this and some don't even try now. I spoken of leaders of vision spoken of those who inspired. I spoken of those who have live off politics. Now, let me say something about the techniques of leadership. Although I shan't finish on that what a leader must be and what he must do in this one Solitary book that I've read John McGregor Burns. He said and I quote so that you shall see that I had done some homework. He said that leadership and divorced from Essex leadership is reduced to management and politics to Pure technique first. Therefore in my judgment at leadership should a leader should have a general body of philosophy and belief against which he can judge. The succession of major issues as they arise which will confront him and with which he will have to deal. He didn't feel obliged always to disclose his attitude, especially if it seems important to him to do so, but he must remember and if he doesn't he will soon find out that at any moment unexpected storms blow up newest use occur and they'll toss him about like a cork unless he has a Bedrock of philosophy and belief to fall back on some certainty in his life and without such a foundation. Leader may be able to survive but he won't be a leader in the sense in which I use the term, but with such a base then he has many advantages not only his own self-confidence his own inner certainty but something even more he can then afford to listen to his opponents he can afford to discuss to argue with them to way and take into account what they have to say about what he's proposing to do. Yes. I'm a consensus politician Harlan. I believe it is the best way to govern our societies. It is an old-fashioned belief at the moment, but it's been kicked out of the front door by the confrontation list, but will climb back through the window in due course and I only hope I'm here to see it and a leader can learn much if he listens to his opponents he could turn it to his own use and by absorbing it in his own proposals in his own projects. He can do much to make them permanent instead of having them swept aside when his opponents come to power instead of him. And surely someone who believes in change and progress who wants to improve our society. He must want to see those achievements permanent. Not just have the temporary enjoyment of putting them on the statute book to see them Swept Away. Of course, he must listen to The Experts are always with us, but at the end of the day, he should use his own judgment and remember that they too can be wrong. In in steering the politics and political matters unlike flying modern aircraft use still a better fly by the seat of your pants. I recall when I was a junior minister in the Ministry of Transport in 1947. We had to consider what should be the shape and size of our Motorway system in Britain in the postwar years and I was advised them by the greatest expert on road traffic in Britain about what the size of the motorway program should be how many miles we ought to build at that time? We had him Britain licensed 1 million nine hundred and eighty four thousand vehicles. In the you showed me we have nearly two million. He has showed me that we could plan safely on the assumption that never be more than for the very outside 5 million vehicles on our roads and I listened to him with attention and with some all which lessened year by year as the number of road vehicles Drew. But the last count there were 18 million 625,000. I don't blame my expertise did his best but experts are not infallible and leaders shouldn't be beguiled into believing that forecasts will inevitably come true when I see the self confidence with which we are now apparently able to forecast the rate of growth in 1982 and 83 forecast the level of unemployment in 84 and 85 forecast the rate of inflation in 86 and 87. I can only Marvel at how fast we have progress since two years ago when I got it all wrong. So a leader must have the courage to act and act against expert advice in this at least I can agree with Machiavelli when he wrote that it's better to be impetuous than cautious leader soon discovers in any crisis any new crisis that grows up that his greatest freedom of action will be at the outset when he has the least information. The time he's assembled all the facts you'll find that the possibilities for bold action of closed in and have almost disappeared and at such decisive moments therefore and this is why it's right that a leader should be impetuous rather than cautious at such decisive moments how he decides will depend upon his past experience his knowledge of how similar events have developed and been handled in the past and of course upon his intuition his imagination and his judgment and there's no substitute for these qualities. So if in action if action or inaction seem equally valid then act in doing so you will alter the balance of forces and may free yourself to be able to take further action in more favorable circumstances later on. Of course, there are times for masterly inactivity. What the advisor of the first emperor of China caught Stillness and reserve a leaders judgment May correctly lead him to the conclusion that he should take no action and reach no decision. Those are the occasions when he'll allow a problem to develop because he can't see that reaching a conclusion is worth the effort and expenditure of the political Capital that will be required then his job is to encourage others to debate the issue press his ministers to do. So the Press themselves the public let them know the problem so that all the arguments are brought out into the open and chewed over and that very process. I have found sometimes makes the appropriate course of action more clear without the leader needing to move a muscle, but he shouldn't do this art of inertia or indecision only because he believes it will make the final decision more acceptable and Clear when it is taken he must always an associate. It's he who should Galvanize his ministers in the cabinet into continuous action when they need a Spur or restrain them when they should be held back when you have newly elected governments when they come to power with a party Manifesto clearly voted upon by the electorate then he will find his ministers shouldering one another out of the way in their eagerness to have their programs legislated. However, ill digested they may be and no matter that every form can have equal legislative time or indeed equal call upon the limited resources of the government's disposal. So it's the task of the leader to order an influence the choice of priorities for his government to ensure some order in the manner of their fulfillment because he alone looks at every departmental program as one part of the whole background to his government's goes Never was a never-failing source of surprise to me. When I ceased to be be a departmental minister at never surprised me. Of course. I've never conscious of it when I was a departmental minister how quickly we all become immersed in our own problems and Enterprises the exclusion of considering the effect of what we wish to do on the work of the government as a ho so the task of the Prime Minister and the cabinet is to influence the choice of priorities to reconcile where there is conflict between the various members of his cabinet to arbitrate between them to give the utmost consideration to those who are going to lose the argument to lead them all to a consensus and to do all this without unnecessarily bruising the feelings of any of them and without losing his sense of direction and purpose. I don't think I ever managed to do any of it. I'm really sitting before you the ideal, but to lead is to choose and to choose rightly as a leader. You must see the Enterprise as a ho. Some leaders, like others temperamentally find great difficulty in reaching decisions. And then they tend to fall back upon president or upon past experience and a civil servants will be there to help them always to fall back on prisoners. This is by no means helpful, although on the whole it's usually better to know what happened before the not to know it and you're better prepared. If you are I always think that a newly appointed British prime minister has an advantage over a newly elected president of the United States because the prime minister's usually graduated to that Supreme office only after years of holding various ministerial posts in senior Departments of State. Whereas in the American system Your Leader comes fresh to the task, but without that perspective that has been achieved by adding British prime ministers over a period of years. Now that can mean that you have a freshness that disregards the Problems and can handle them in a different way or it may mean that you don't understand the Nuance of all the difficulties but I think on the ho if I may say so in the heart of the Midwest, I think I prefer our system the some people however long they're experienced temperamentally incapable of reaching firm decisions. We had a conservative prime minister at the beginning of the century AJ Balfour. He was a man of intellectual Brilliance philosopher of subtlety and distinction. They simply couldn't make up his mind. The turn of the century the great political controversy. We had was between free trade or protection and the argument went on and at that time the liberal Member of Parliament wrote about a Jay Bell for I am not for free trade and I'm not for protection. I approve of them both and to both have objection for going through life. I continually find it's a terrible business to make up one's mind. So in spite of all comments reproach and predictions, I firmly adhere to unsettled convictions. Doesn't the holy Fair description of a Jay Bell for what he could and did in fact act firmly on occasion, but it's fair to say that he wasn't one who enjoyed conflict and he sought to avoid it whenever possible and that he was unusual. Most of us have a fair bit of aggression in our makeup when we are leaders. Nevertheless It Is by no means clear and I have known every president since not President Truman, although I was appointed a junior Minister whilst he was still your president here, but I'd known every president since then I've met them some I have known some I have only met and of course, I've watched every and seen and watched it firsthand every prime minister since aptly in 1945, but it's not by no means clear how a leader will behave until he finds himself bearing this lonely responsibility. I doubt that a man's basic characteristics altar when he assumes High office the highest office of state but My guess would be that is basic and perhaps his latent characteristics becomes sharper and more highly developed it certain that the very process of sitting in the president's chair in the Oval Office and I have sat there with them and watched or in the cabinet room in number 10 Downing Street will cause every leader to consider a fresh how he should approach his problems and reaches objectives. I found it impossible to sit in the prime minister's chair in the cabinet room at number 10 Downing Street under the painting of Sir Robert Walpole who was prime minister for 21 years and 1721 to 1742 in the place that have been occupied by the great and not so great leaders of the past 250 years in our history. I found it impossible to sit there without feeding in a real sense that I was a trustee to preserve the best of what had gone before in Britain's history as well as an initiator of change and progress others must have felt the same in their own day. two high privilege to be prime minister of my country as well as a responsibility and to fuel yourself part of the continuous unrolling Panorama of British history throughout the ages. I've seen these are some other countries, especially those whose history has been bound up with that of Britain Colonial former Colonial territories now independent others to experiencing the same emotion when they enter the cabinet room at number 10 and sat in that historic place, which is seen peace and War reform and repression which saw the birth of your country. the growth of the greatest Empire in the world and it's peaceful transformation and now the struggle not wholly successful, but it will be one day to transform and modernize our industrial society in my own country for I have the greatest confidence in my own people and if we look back over the Panorama of British history for hundreds of years there have been periods when we been down as well as periods when we be not this isn't the first time in history and it won't be the last time we shall come again, but having said that and being rather somber prime minister must avoid getting an acute attack of prime ministerial itÃ­s There's a great temptation to do what I did just now become a little pumps when you're surrounded by people who do your bidding civil servants waiting to do fulfill your lightest wish cars and airplanes at your instant disposal the willingness of the most important and busy people and the land to drop everything. They're doing it at a quarter telephone call and come and see you. You've no idea what an air of unreality this produces. That feeling of remoteness. You don't need to smoke cannabis in order to feel you're floating in mid-air. It's a very heady very heady mixture and you are remote from the everyday irritations that your fellow men and women are suffering. You don't miss the bus. It's there waiting for you all the time. And so you forget our other people get to work in the morning and what they're feeding like when they get home at night having waited in the rain for so long in order to get there on every occasion when I've ceased to occupy government office and I seem to have been injected as often as I've entered every time when I've ceased to hold government office and become a private citizen again. I felt in a sense as though I was rejoining the human race. So a sense of humor in a sense of proportion helps and so does good health and stamina. I often asked how I managed to hold all these offices and become Prime Minister and I can tell you the secret. There's nothing very profound about it. It's to outlive all your contemporaries. Never forget that that good health is important and stamina, you know, the Battle of Waterloo was a very close run thing indeed. I believe President XI scar still believes the French one it and indeed it might have ended it might have ended in Victory for the French of Napoleon hadn't had to sit on his horse for many hours during the day when his generals thought he seemed to be suffering from lassitude rather badly and he had to sit on his horse. All the time was he had an acute attack of piles and that had a quite an effect. I've certain on that dashing impetuous man in his approach that day of the problem of the Battle of Waterloo. So good health a necessity. So is the need to keep fresh and avoid staleness too many mistakes are made When leaders are tired and are overwhelmed with paper day after day fresh problems Mount colleagues. Take your time papers must be read Fallen visitors must be seen the party must be met the present the television must interviewed you you constituents want you among them. You must make speeches in Parliament in the country. At first the adrenaline pulses strongly you you cannot tire but the activities never end. No sooner did you do surmount one set? Then another come at you like the unceasing waves on the sea shore except that this tide never goes out the president of the United States the chancellor of Germany the prime minister of Britain the president of France never can have a day off and let it be Christmas Day always there telegrams coming in always their decisions to be taken and slow. Imperceptibly the constant pressure the unremitting toil papers that come to they take their toll now there's only one remedy for that and that's what I call the hailsham recipe hailsham Lord hailsham as you some of you may know as our present Lord Chancellor man of great wit and learning and an amusing man one day when he was minister of education and much younger. He came back from a weekend in the country. He'd been sent Away by his private secretary with three despatch box has three of those red boxes that we use full of papers for him for the following week had been handed to him on the Friday and when his private secretary unlock the boxes on Monday morning, he found to his consternation that not one have been touched. He looked at Lord hailsham Quintin Hogg as he was then called in silent reproach. He was met with a breezy reply. That's a fresh them briefed dear boy. Let us refresh them briefed and I think Lord hailsham we got something there, you know, although not that's not to say it's a sensible course of action regularly to neglect to read your papers before you have to take an important meeting only keep it keep it in proportion. Now, I've spoken of the techniques of leadership in terms of the leaders relationships with his colleagues with his opponents and so on but he must never forget the constant interaction between those he leads and himself between those in the country and himself and it's a very easy Temptation very easy to become isolated from them it even khaldun who was a person scholar who wrote a universal history in the 13th century said the interest would be long before the days of democracy was still true the interest subjects have in their ruler lies in his relation to them, but isn't that just True today as it was then it's my experience that a political leader finds that as soon as he assumes the leadership there comes to him in the form of a nun covenanted and an unearned bonus a tremendous loyalty from Those whom he leads his success is their success his failures are their favours. They identify with him and all he does they exert an intangible influence on him as he exerts his influence to shape events the Loyalty that accrues to him as soon as he'd been elected is in the form of capital that he dare not Fritter away. Although it is too easy to forget that stock of capital indeed a good leader will add to his stock of capital during his leadership by maintaining a constant dialogue between himself and those he leads Machiavelli said it was better to be for a leader princip rinse. He said better for a prince to be feared than loved. I dug that that may have been true in his authoritarian days. But I question whether it's true today. My observation is that when ill-fortune befores a political leader and it always does when he's most did need of support because he's beset with difficulties then it's the leader who's loved rather than the leader who is feared who can rely on continuing support and loyalty. Of course. We are all concerned about our self-esteem and our place in history. But I think one thing that also we are concerned with is how we appear in the eyes of our followers. Will those we lead feel that they've been let down by a particular action that we've done? Will they think that a leaders abuse their trust he must appear consistent therefore in the eyes of his followers. He shouldn't act out of character. They must feel that they know him and his attitudes. Well, if he does out of character out of character, then they'll be an appearance of uncertainty and resulting confusion. It's often been said of Harold MacMillan and here I come to another point that he conducted The Retreat of the British Empire from Africa while persuading the imperialist conservative party. He was doing nothing of the sort and you'll note that I said a leader must appear to be consistent that's different from saying that he must be consistent. He must appear to his followers that he is being consistent and I think Harold MacMillan could just lie argue, even if a little cynically that what he was doing was a following the true interests of his party as opposed to their short-term. desires to lead I repeat us to make choices true leadership must be model. It's a collective relationship between the leader and those he leads in which they both interact on each other. and in view of that statement It is my responsibility to conclude by stating as I now draw to my conclusion. The specific tasks that today's leadership should fulfill and the interaction that the leader should encourage between himself and those he leads and in doing so I'm setting out my Testament as to what I believe is the future the first task of leaders in the western world today is to reconvince men and women that they need not be the pores of inexorable economic forces too powerful for them to influence. The government should not relegate themselves to the role of passive bystanders allowing greater and apparently irresistible tides of unemployment and Injustice to sweep over them that they should recall on the contrary that the immediate post War II World War governments faced problems quite as great as those of the present and emerge with Titanic achievements to their credit. They transformed a war shattered an impoverished world through mechanisms. Yes, but they had the dream first. They had the vision as Hubert Humphrey said through important mechanisms Bretton Woods, the Marshall Plan the general agreement on tariffs and trade the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the founding of the United Nations and on the part of my own country the transformation of the British Empire peacefully into a commonwealth of independent nations. It was a wonderfully creative equally pop and the task of leadership today is to convince us this generation that we can repeat those selfs those successes in the 1980s if we have the self-confidence and the will to do so it is possible. Indeed. It is necessary for leaders to put together a Golden Triangle that would join up the financial surpluses held by the OPEC oil countries with the Western know-how and Technology much of which is now lying unused in order to meet the needs of hundreds of millions in the third world who are crying out for better health for more education for housing and even for food nor is it beyond the wit of Western leaders to coordinate their economic and monetary policies. So that nations may complement one another's economic recovery avoid the drift into protectionism and create once again, an era of expansion that would enable millions of our people to go back to work and above all is the task of true leadership to put the achievement of multilateral nuclear and conventional disarmament in the Forefront of our international relations. Once again, if we confine no way of living with the Soviet Union, which will certainly die with her. We have therefore a three-fold task overcome Western unemployment, raise the living standards of the third world negotiate for a just peace. These are moral imperatives and their solution demands model leadership. And here's the highest test of the need of the interaction between leaders and followers, but the overriding aim of both of them to create a collective purpose that will meet the real impediment needs of the peoples of the world. That is the task that awaits true leadership today. And that is what it is about."
