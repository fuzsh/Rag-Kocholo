        "text": "Former British prime minister and Labour Party leader James Callaghan has died on the eve of his 93rd birthday, a family spokesman said.\n\nLord Callaghan was in power from April 1976 until May 1979, when his government, shaken by a period of bitter industrial unrest known as \"the Winter of Discontent\", was swept away by Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives.\n\nThe family spokesman said Lord Callaghan died at home in East Sussex, in south-east England, just 11 days after his wife Audrey, to whom he had been married for 67 years, passed away.\n\nLord Callaghan was the longest-living prime minister in British history.\n\nHe was also the unique holder of all four major offices of state - prime minister, chancellor of the exchequer, foreign secretary and home secretary.\n\n\"The Right Honourable Lord Callaghan of Cardiff KG died peacefully today on the eve of his 93rd birthday, 11 days after his wife Audrey,\" the family spokesman said in a brief statement.\n\n\"His family have asked the media to respect their privacy at this time.\"\n\nDuring the 31 years from his first election to parliament in 1945 to his arrival in Downing Street, Lord Callaghan built a reputation for solidity and reliability, and an affability which earned him the nickname \"Sunny Jim\".\n\nIn many ways Lord Callaghan was a bridge between the great post-war reforming government of Clement Attlee in 1945 and the so-called New Labour government headed by Tony Blair in 1997.\n\nYet his dogged rise through Labour and government ranks was overshadowed by the circumstances of his losing power, and the party's relegation by the Tories to the political wilderness for 18 years."
