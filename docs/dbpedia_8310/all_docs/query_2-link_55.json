After a year of captivity and a violent rescue that resulted in Martin's death, the world watched Gracia Burnham return home in June 2002.\n\nIn this riveting personal account, Burnham tells for the very first time the real story behind the news--about their harrowing ordeal, about how it affected their relationship with each other and with God, about the terrorists who held them, about the actions of the U.S. and Philippine governments, and about how they were affected by the prayers of thousands of Christians throughout the world.\n\nPaperback, pages, notes, illustrated"
