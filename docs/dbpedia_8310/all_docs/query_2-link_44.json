        "text": "Description\n\nPsalm 23 Mysteries\n\nBook 15\n\nJeremiah has worked really hard to put his past behind him. His carefully built house of cards all begins to tumble down, though, when he’s accused of murder. Complicating things is the fact that enemies of his past have found him and are determined to destroy him for good. Everyone he loves is a target and he must do everything in his power to protect them and put his own demons to rest before someone else he knows is killed.\n\nMore Psalm 23 Books Paperback Version\n\nAdditional information\n\nBook Types\n\nEbook, Kindle, Paperback\n\nE-book Formats\n\nKindle/Nook/Kobo, Mobi, PDF\n\nCategory Christian, Mystery, Psalm 23 Mysteries, Series, Thriller Tags Psalm 23 Mysteries SKU B07DCYZR1R\n\nThis series has it all. Intrigue, love, salvation, reconciliation, mystery, friends who are family and family who are friends, adventure, heart-pounding suspense, tears (happy and sad), and a desire for more. Thank God for the creativity, strength, ideas, and special abilities He has blessed Debbie Viguié with, so that she could share it all with us."
