        "text": "Vietnam War POW memoir and film\n\nIn the Presence of Mine Enemies: 1965–1973 – A Prisoner of War is a memoir by American pilot Howard E. Rutledge, co-written with his wife and Mel and Lyla White,[1] of his time in a Vietnamese POW camp during the Vietnam War. When it was published it was the first book-length firsthand treatment of the experiences of American prisoners of war in Vietnam.[2] It was made into a documentary in the same year.[3]\n\nAfter the war, Rutledge was head of the University of Oklahoma's department of naval science and twice ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives from Oklahoma's 4th congressional district. He died of cancer in Norman, Oklahoma in 1984.[4][5]"
