        "text": "Landmark achievements\n\n1922 - 1948\n\n1922: FIDH is founded by some twenty national organisations on the initiative of French and German member organisations. It is the first international human rights organisation. Its motto is: “Peace for human rights.\n\n1927: FIDH proposes the creation of an “International declaration of human rights” and an International Criminal Court.\n\n1936: FIDH adopts an additional declaration touching, in particular, on the rights of mothers, children and the elderly, the right to work and to social security, leisure and an education.\n\n1940: FIDH joins the fight against Nazism. Its chairman, Victor Basch, is assassinated by members of the Vichy government militia in Lyon.\n\n1949 - 1988\n\nDispersed or forced underground during the Second World War, FIDH reforms after the war and develops its human rights activities. It launches its first fact-finding missions and judicial observation missions. FIDH’s positions are supported by accounts gathered from victims by its officials on mission. Two of its most eminent leaders, René Cassin and Joseph-Paul Boncour, help draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. During the 1980s, FIDH expands its field of activities, particularly within the United Nations. Its fact-finding missions become more diverse and are supplemented by more intensive activism within international organisations.\n\n1989 - 2010\n\nThe 1990s:\n\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War mark a major step forward in the development of national human rights NGOs across the world. FIDH supports this development within the framework of legal cooperation programmes in political transition contexts in Eastern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America. The number of FIDH member organisations increases from 66 to more than 100. In 1990, FIDH brings together, in Prague, for the first time, all of its members and partners from Eastern Europe, who are finally free from dictatorship. In 1997, it holds its first International Conference in a southern country, in Dakar. This conference underlines the urgent need to combat the flagrant human rights violations resulting from economic globalisation.\n\n2001: FIDH holds its conference in Morocco. The application of the principle of responsibility to perpetrators of human rights violations, whether states, companies, institutions or individuals, lies at the heart of the movement’s actions. During this conference, the first chair of FIDH from a southern country - the Senegalese lawyer Sidiki Kaba is elected.\n\n2002: The International Criminal Court enters into force. It is the culmination of one of FIDH’s longest campaigns.\n\n2003: The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded to Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian lawyer and long-standing partner of FIDH, honouring the day-to-day commitment to victims shown by human rights defenders.\n\n2004: CCR, FIDH’s new American affiliate organisation, files a complaint in Germany against Donald Rumsfeld, former US Secretary of Defense, for torture and mistreatment at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib; the proceedings are to last 4 years and become one of FIDH’s landmark cases in the field of human rights compliance in the fight against terrorism.\n\n2006: FIDH takes a public stand against the execution of the former Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, and deplores the fact that a historic opportunity to judge the crimes of Saddam Hussein according to the principles of a fair trial turned into a parody of justice.\n\n2007: A complaint for torture and maltreatment in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib is lodged against the former American Secretary of State for Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, in an attempt to combat high-level impunity. The same year, Souhayr Belhassen, a Tunisian journalist and human rights defender, becomes the first woman (what’s more, an Arab/Muslim woman) elected as the chair of FIDH.\n\n2008: The year 2008 is a turning point for the death penalty: the UN adopts a universal moratorium on the death penalty and it is abolished by Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Togo is to follow their example in 2009, as a result of ongoing action by FIDH and its member organisations. In 2008, unprecedented events mark the campaign for international justice that FIDH has been fighting for years: FIDH and its Member Organisations win some great victories, such as the opening of the ICC’s first case involving the Central African Republic; new charges of gender-related crimes are filed against certain Congolese defendants by the ICC prosecutor; Senegalese law is aligned with the Statute of Rome and with international human rights conventions; a Tunisian vice-consul is convicted of acts of torture. But universal justice remains a challenge, as does the need to protect those exercising their rights in national and international courts. The conviction of Alberto Fujimori and the 2009 arrest warrant issued by the ICC against the Sudanese president are also key victories. 2008 also sees the adoption of the optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which finally enables the victims of rights violations to seek individual remedy at the international level. This advance is the culmination of years of FIDH action in favour of full and fair recognition of economic, social and cultural rights for all. This step forward also comes at a time when economic globalisation is increasingly called into question and when debate is focused squarely on the responsibility of corporate actors, particularly multinational organisations. FIDH calls for economic relations to incorporate human rights and for all stakeholders, including Governments, businesses and financial institutions, to be held to account for their actions.\n\n2008-2009: FIDH’s campaign for women’s rights also bears fruit, with the European Union adopting guidelines on women’s rights, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) ratifying the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa in February, followed by Cameroon in May. In April, Burkina Faso adopts a law on quotas, requiring lists of candidates for National Assembly and municipal elections to include at least 30% women and in December, Uganda adopts legislation prohibiting female genital mutilation.\n\n2009: On 4 March 2009, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issues an arrest warrant for the Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir. This decision marks a crucial stage in the development of international justice. It is, in fact, the first time since its creation in 2002 that the ICC has issued an arrest warrant against a sitting president. FIDH was particularly committed to this brief: by performing fact-finding missions and calling for the United Nations Security Council to bring the matter before the ICC, it helped ensure the opening of an enquiry and the issuing of arrest warrants against the most senior members of the Sudanese government - including President Bashir.\n\n2010: For the first time FIDH holds its World Congress in the Caucasus, in Armenia. The governing bodies now comprise 19 nationalities from all continents, and over 40 % women. There are now 178 member organisations.>\n\n2011-2015\n\nThroughout the Arab Spring, FIDH does its utmost to defend the rights of those in the countries involved. In Libya, for example, it is responsible for ensuring that human rights are a central plank of the transitional regime’s reforms.\n\n2011: FIDH secures the release of political prisoners in Burma, and contributes to securing partial openness from the authorities.\n\n2012: FIDH celebrates its 90th anniversary. This year, it carries out 60 fact-finding missions, judicial observation missions and appeals. It welcomes the increasing number of victories it is winning throughout the world.\n\nUR RIGHTS, OUR FIGHT, OUR FUTURE\n\nFIDH, meeting in Taipei (Taiwan) from 21 to 25 October 2019 for its 40th Congress\n\nAlmost 100 years since the creation of our federation, and more than 70 since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the universality of human rights has never been more questioned, both at the normative and at the political levels. The global human rights movement must thus mobilise to defend the promises found in the UDHR, and fight all attacks on universality. This is a duty for us.\n\n1. Addressing crises\n\nFIDH, meeting in Taipei (Taiwan) from 21 to 25 October 2019 for its 40th Congress\n\nAlmost 100 years since the creation of our federation, and more than 70 since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the universality of human rights has never been more questioned, both at the normative and at the political levels. The global human rights movement must thus mobilise to defend the promises found in the UDHR, and fight all attacks on universality. This is a duty for us.\n\n1. Addressing crises\n\n1a. Defending a human rights-driven multilateralism\n\nThe regional and international post human rights instruments and mechanisms have led to many advances and were vectors for the universalisation of human rights. They were essential in enabling human right defenders to make their voices heard and condemn violations.\n\nBut their effectiveness and impacts have been affected and the resources available to them have been greatly reduced.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council is hostage to the right of veto by of its five permanent members and no longer completely fulfils its obligations when faced with the increasing number of crises. This explains its inability to deal with the crises such as those in Syria, Crimea and Palestine in full regard to and for the benefit of human rights.\n\nInternational courts are also having to face a large number of challenges, such as problems in deploying universally, in obliging the super powers to face their responsibility, and in dealing with the increasing number of hostile policies that obstruct international justice. The recent attacks by the Trump Administration on the ICC and its staff are only the latest example.\n\nEconomic governance is conducted outside of global multilateral forums and in contradiction to the international human rights commitments and obligations, while international initiatives to have economies consider human rights are difficult to implement.\n\nMeanwhile, the world’s geopolitical map and relations between States are changing, as is the division of powers between the public and the private sectors. Various actors are consolidating their position at the global level, while their goal is to undermine the international order and the protection of human rights.\n\nIt is imperative to rethink, re-invest and strengthen multilateralism as a force that guarantees a global governance serving human rights.\n\n1b. Promoting human rights and the rule of law in democracies in crisis\n\nDemocracies are electing leaders who promote conflicting, authoritarian and illiberal policies. Such policies impede liberties, question the universal and indivisible nature of human rights and limit the application of universal protection systems.\n\nThe instrumentalization and confiscation of democracy by the populist extreme right and post-fascist regimes creates new challenges for human rights defenders and activists. Resistance and resilience must be combined with the strengthening of the alliances between human rights defense organizations and social movements.\n\n2. Expanding our horizons: broadening human rights reach and norms\n\nContemporary societies are confronted with a number of emerging issues which could only be addressed effectively when basic rights are used as a framework.\n\n2a. Digital technologies\n\nDigital technologies are becoming essential to serve the work of human rights defenders around the world and to give voice to oppressed and marginalized populations, to the extent that they have access to them. They are also used by authoritarian regimes, who use them to identify and repress dissenting voices. Similarly, advances in algorithms and artificial intelligence are opening up new horizons, particularly in the areas of medical care, transport or education, or, more problematically, as police auxiliaries or predictive justice. They can also threaten the functioning of democracies, human rights and the rule of law. Consequently, it is essential to carry out impact assessments on the human rights of these systems, to generalize digital education and to adopt binding international texts aimed at ensuring the right of access to the Internet for all, protecting privacy and protecting, promoting and defending human rights effectively in these new environments.\n\n2b. Considering nature in terms of rights\n\nHumanity faces a major challenge since the onset of global warming. The consequences are just as tangible from the viewpoint of human rights: inequalities and discriminations become more acute, migration grows, defenders are targeted and communities are severely impacted.\n\nPeople have the right to a clean and safe environment and to be protected from threats to their life. Collective rights connected to environment, the right to land, the right to water should be further enhanced and recognised.\n\n2c. Strengthening corporate accountability and obligations\n\nCorporate regulations are growing stricter throughout the world and initiatives taken to oblige corporations to be accountable for human rights violations are growing in number. In addition to the adoption of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) in 2011, the OECD Guidelines and the increase in legislations obliging businesses to respect human rights in supply chains, that need to be fleshed out and made more effective, we also need to support the growing momentum designed to strengthen the accountability framework at international, regional and national levels. This includes negotiations at the United Nations on the preparation of a binding treaty on business and human rights.\n\n3. Consolidating the roots of our movement: making the enjoyment of human rights a reality for all\n\nRights count if they only adress anyone. Otherwise, rights become privileges for some. Our movement must pursue its action to make human rights and social justice a universal reality.\n\n3a. Defending the defenders\n\nAs agents of change throughout the world, human rights defenders are increasingly seen in the public debate as “threats to national security”, “terrorists, “traitors”, “enemies of the State, or “opponents to development” for opposing government policies or even merely denouncing the impact of economic activities and the expropriation of local communities.\n\nEmboldened by their rhetoric, governments attack the actions of civil society through national and international terrorism control measures and impose restrictions on NGOs that curtail their capacity to act. In more and more parts of the world, human rights defenders are under major threat of their freedom and safety.\n\n3b. Changing the narrative for migrants and refugees.\n\nGlobal inequality and unequal distribution of wealth is a major source of migration. As long as inequal distribution of wealth becomes more acute, migration flows will only be rising.\n\nInternational community and civil society should work together to combat rights violations that lead to migrations, develop policies that secure migratory routes and fight against the criminalization of human rights defenders who help migrants. We also need to secure the rights of migrants in host countries by especially fighting hate speech and slavery and other forms of economic exploitation. Migrants’ integration can’t take place in conditions of segregation. Segregation feeds the extreme right narrative regarding migrants as invaders. Changing this narrative is a major challenge. Otherwise, rights and social cohesion are seriously threatened.\n\n3c. Responding to the threats to the universality of women’s rights\n\nThroughout the world, women’s rights are subject to restrictions and alienation because of the instrumentalization of cultural and religious heritage, ancestral traditions and discriminatory practices of patriarchal origin.\n\nWomen experience discrimination in the recognition and enjoyment of their rights within the family, their rights to health, their reproductive and sexual rights, their economic, social and political rights, on the basis of both equality in the law as equality before the law. They are victims of violence, trafficking and feminicides.\n\nIn contexts of dictatorial regimes, organized crime, conflict, and political regime change, women are also victims of sexual violence and feminicide. Rape has been used as a weapon of war and ethnic cleansing. They are subjected to extreme violence that violates their human rights, their citizenship and their dignity.\n\nFIDH must continue to defend women’s rights in these particularly difficult contexts.\n\n3d. Combating LGBTI+ discrimination\n\nThe universality of human rights is frequently questioned, especially when it comes to advocating for the rights of LGBTI+ individuals. In certain societies, such rights are argued to be “Western values” by many opponents. LGBTI+ people are then discriminated against and serve as alibis to create a scapegoat group, threatening the collectivity, its values and its particular traditions, often called national. Meanwhile, in many countries, the fight for equality for LGBTI+ individuals remains spearheaded by specialist organizations, and is only marginally integrated into the work of generalist human rights organizations. Yet, many countries have seen successes in reducing discrimination. The list of countries where same-sex marriage is legal continues to increase, and repressive legislation is being struck down. The goal is to better identify how and why these successes have happened, in order to replicate them.\n\n3e. Fighting capital punishment\n\nThe right to life remains precarious, threatened by the use of capital punishment. Asia is home to the highest number of retentionist countries and the highest number of executions in the world. Principles of equitable justice, fair trial rights, and due process are cardinal principles that, if respected, can help reduce the use of the death penalty and get countries back on track to abolition.\n\n3f. Justice, a tool for strengthening the universality of rights\n\nIn their search for justice, truth and reparation, the first step of victims of serious human rights violations and crimes under international law is to resort to national criminal courts, in the countries where those crimes were perpetrated. However, several factors can impede effective access at the local or national levels: lack of political willingness and/or ability of domestic justice systems, weakening or total collapse of legal systems, lack of independence, political obstacles or, absence of measures to protect victims or legal personnel for instance. Consequently, other methods for fighting impunity and holding perpetrators to account must be used. Our actions must continue to support victims of international crimes’ effective access to other accountability mechanisms, at national level using the principle of extra-territorial jurisdiction, at regional level or at international level, before hybrid courts or international courts like the International Criminal Court. These mechanisms too present specific and evolving challenges to be addressed, but also opportunities to leverage openings within the global justice architecture and empower local actors at every stage.\n\n4. Reinstate human rights universality\n\nHuman dignity is the axiom of rights. Human beings have dignity because they are human and this can not be questioned. This is what universality is about. Human rights reflect the juridico-political response of the indignation provoked by the most tragic experiences to which humanity has been and continues to be confronted, starting with the two World wars of the 20th century. In addition to being immensely important from a legal standpoint, human rights reflect an intuition inherent in the universal refusal of injustice and threats to human dignity.\n\nWhether the challenges to the realisation of rights are old or new, we can only deal with them if we have a universal response, based on a cosmopolitan governance that goes beyond state boundaries, and is free of economic interests.\n\nThe universality of human rights fits in perfectly with cultural, economic, social or even historical differences and disparities. Human rights provide a minimum of protection against the most basic interest interests of the human being. They give life to his/her dignity. International human rights conventions already include diversity to better define our common base. They prohibit discrimination, and look at the criteria that were used in the past for exclusion and marginalisation. They promote cultural rights, leave room for adjustments based on particular cultural characteristics and circumstances. Exceptions are made for certain absolute rights such as the ban on torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. These adjustments must be defined by law, and be precise, necessary, non-discriminatory and proportional to the goal being sought.\n\nHuman rights are indivisible and are thus the law and the common good shared by all humanity. Rights serve both the safety of our communities and individual dignity.\n\nParis, 10 May 2022 — One-hundred years ago, in 1922, against the backdrop of the post-WWI period, the French and German human rights associations and 20 other national associations joined forces to found the International Federation for Human Rights. Over its rich, century-long history, FIDH has fought to build a fair and equitable world.\n\n\"Our strength lies in our ability to remain relevant: by adapting to changes without ever straying from our mission,\" declared Alice Mogwe, FIDH president. \"Our tenacious commitment to universal respect for human rights – driven by passionate people from all over the world – is firmly rooted in each and every one of the organisations which make up our Federation. This once-in-a-century celebration is an opportunity to pay them the tribute they so richly deserve and to project ourselves into our future: conceiving and defending the rights of tomorrow.\"\n\nA centenary resolutely focused on the future\n\nClimate change, growing inequalities, threats to democracy and to our personal data, discrimination against vulnerable populations: the challenges of this new century are already very real. What new rights are needed to meet these new challenges? And how to implement them? FIDH will tackle these issues by engaging young people through an online platform, #AskTheFuture, which will receive proposals from people from all over the world.\n\nThis platform will complement a major academic initiative undertaken in partnership with the universities of Sceaux Paris Saclay, Paris Panthéon Sorbonne 1, the Law Clinic of Geneva and the University of Geneva. From 20 May to 8 December, a dozen lectures will be held in Paris, Brussels and Geneva. They will be hosted by leading academics, FIDH experts, and other speakers who think, fight and, together, redefine human rights.\n\nIn culmination of the celebrations, a gala at the City Hall of Paris will take place on 23 October at the invitation of Mayor Anne Hidalgo, in the presence of European dignitaries and over 150 human rights defenders from around the world.\n\nOn 24 October, FIDH World Congress will open with a full day of round tables – again at the Paris City Hall. This four-day congress will bring together activists from every continent on the major issues of tomorrow: universalism of rights in the light of human diversity, extreme poverty, common goods for the benefit of humanity, and the intersection of rights and the climate crisis.\n\nFIDH is active on a worldwide scale and, as such, is associated this year with the Fortnight of International Solidarity in Brussels at the beginning of October, as well as with Geneva’s Human Rights Week at the end of November.\n\nOn this occasion, FIDH is organising a travelling photo exhibition developed with the Magnum agency, the screening of films produced by the Mobile Film Festival, and consultative workshops for young people, in collaboration with the Brussels and Paris city halls. Several major events are also planned in Africa and Eastern Europe.\n\nFinally, major art installations will be exhibited in Brussels and Paris with the generous support of artists from the MTART agency.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be accompanied by so many actors who share this vision and who value our commitment to human rights,\" concluded Eléonore Morel, the organisation’s executive director.\n\nLearn all about the centenary, including FIDH’s history, on the dedicated website: https://fidh100.org/\n\nDedicated partners\n\nTo carry out its work, FIDH has enlisted the support of many institutional, public and private partners, all of whom are motivated by a concern for the common good and the unconditional defence of human dignity.\n\nYou can find the complete list of our partners here.\n\nNote to editors\n\nAlice Mogwe, FIDH’s president, is available for interviews in English.\n\nEléonore Morel, FIDH’s executive director, is available for interviews in French.\n\nFIDH’s history includes:\n\n– participation in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948;\n\n– calling for the creation of the International Criminal Court;\n\n– support to the victims of Rwandan, Cambodian genocides and victims of Syrian war criminals;\n\n– resistance to the anti-democratic abuses of Russia and China, and those of other countries that do not respect fundamental rights;\n\n– support for communities affected by environmental hazards in Brazil, Chile, Italy, and Ecuador;\n\n– unwavering mobilisation on major international trials and milestones of international justice.\n\nAbout FIDH\n\nWith 192 member organisations from around the world, FIDH has been fighting impunity for a century and working to protect victims from powerful actors such as States, the primary guarantors of human rights, but also armed opposition groups and multinationals. The Federation acts for the freedom of action of human rights defenders and the defence of the universality of rights.\n\nFIDH was founded in 1922 in the aftermath of the First World War — the first international NGO dedicated to the defence of human rights. The organisation investigates and documents human rights violations and advocates for states to adopt policies that respect human rights.\n\nIn 1948, two of FIDH’s most prominent leaders, René Cassin and Joseph Paul-Boncour, participated in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations. FIDH is committed to the defence of all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights as defined in this seminal, groundbreaking text."
