        "text": "In Europe, handball is more popular, but handball has its attractions, unity, battles in defense, fast attacks, combinations.\n\nUSA could have a good team, its not hard to find there players who are high, strong and fast.\n\nHere are the rules, for those who are not familiar:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_handball\n\nIn the bottom you have countries with handball league, USA included.\n\nHandball Champions League exists same as football Champions League.\n\nCurrent best teams in the world are: Spain, Iceland, France, Denmark and Croatia.\n\nEnjoy watching handball in London.\n\nBasketball is also popular in Europe, NBA also, but not so much like in 90s I think. In Europe people dont like statistics to much.\n\nI dont think that its easy to score, you need to have really strong punches, that space between the oval line and goal is also wide. On TV it looks easy. Havent tried to play handball, maybe several times in the school gym before. Handball became much faster than before, there are some really nice crossings, goals from the left or right wing, also you have the battle on the line, usually one player goes there and he gets a lot of punches and body checks. Players get to much punches, but its not popular to object on injuries, if you get punches, only thing that you can do is to return back. Handball players dont act so much as footballers.\n\nI dont think so that the handball is a first option for todays handballers, many of them probably tried other sports. For example, best handballer in history of handball, Croat Ivano Balic, likes to say, that he likes basketball more.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivano_Balić\n\nProbably he could not get better moments in basketball, so he plays handball now.\n\nSome types of punches, todays match between Tunisia and Croatia (blue uniforms): Tunisia plays ruff handball. Many players are very tall and have weight, so when they hit someone smaller and weaker, its considered that this \"meeting\" is something like hitting the wall. There are a lot of intentional fouls, but mostly they are fair.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFrance - Spain, also today.​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nSad moments after last second goal, Spanish team lost in the last 2,3 seconds.​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHungary - Sweden​\n\nFrance - Croatia​\n\n​\n\nI think that handball and waterpolo have some similarities. They are popular in around 10, 15 countries. Maybe 5,6 teams decides about the medals. Mostly popular in Europe.​\n\nMaybe those sports will become more popular outside of Europe. Handball is popular in Southern Korea, Argentina. Waterpolo is popular in USA and Australia.​\n\n​\n\nHandball was slower before, long attacks, today its much faster. Bad thing about the handball is that referees dont have the same criteria, bad decisions happen. Many negative reactions players have during and after the match because of those bad decisions.​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nRivalry between the best players is also strong.​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nCountries that dont like each other demonstrate hatred, insults, etc.​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAfter the match Serbian fans followed Croatian fans in their cars and attacked them with axes. This EURO 2012 was held in Serbia. Small group of our fans went there and they were attacked.​\n\nHandball has interesting moments, but I think that its not always interesting: pass, pass, pass and hit the ball. ​\n\n​\n\nGot kind of interested whilst handball was on at the Olympics, after the Bill Simmons article on Grantland. When I looked into it, I was amazed that there were so many leagues. When I'm next in Europe I will definitely try and go and see a game or two (mainland Europe seems to cater for sports better than other parts of Europe). Anyhow my somewhat crude numbers on the Bundesliga Mens division from the start of this week (I think they are reasonable but not great). I have home advantage being worth about 0.6(ish) goals.\n\nTEAM RATING OFFENCE DEFENCE​\n\nBalingen/W -2.58271762 -1.38212603 1.20059159​\n\nEssen -7.83291204 -3.62464598 4.20826606​\n\nFlensburg-Handewitt 6.25514203 3.26479774 -2.99034430​\n\nFuchse Berlin 1.23507642 -1.65249883 -2.88757525​\n\nGoppingen -0.61150579 -0.87391985 -0.26241406​\n\nGroßwallstadt -2.13808206 -3.04364275 -0.90556069​\n\nGummersbach -2.57612927 0.07707756 2.65320684​\n\nH.-Burgdorf 0.47745831 1.19888006 0.72142175​\n\nHSV 2.37794894 1.15635750 -1.22159144​\n\nKiel 6.61909649 5.10581124 -1.51328525​\n\nLemgo -1.33190173 0.00419513 1.33609686​\n\nMagdeburg 1.46945090 1.45355179 -0.01589910​\n\nMelsungen 0.89610461 -0.26077532 -1.15687993​\n\nMinden -4.41346435 -1.86097394 2.55249041​\n\nNeuhausen/Erms -5.19170101 -2.37893615 2.81276486​\n\nN-Lubbecke 0.25675045 0.01812208 -0.23862837​\n\nRN Lowen 4.98078963 1.39456234 -3.58622729​\n\nWetzlar 2.11059608 1.40416340 -0.70643268​"
