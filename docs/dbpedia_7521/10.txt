History

Handball was played in Koper since the 1950s. Initially under TVD Partizan and later as RK Koper, for a while there were even two handball clubs in the town. Over the years, the club ceased operations many times and was brought back to life again.

In the 1994–95 season, the club organised its structure of sections and in the 1999–2000 season, the club qualified for the Slovenian second division. As a consequence, the club received a support from the local company Cimos. In the 2001–02 season, RK Cimos Koper qualified to the Slovenian First League of Handball.

In the 2004–05 season, Koper qualified to the EHF Cup. In the Slovenian league, they finished third in the 2006–07 season.
