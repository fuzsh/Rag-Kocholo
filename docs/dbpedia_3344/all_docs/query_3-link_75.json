        "text": "These teens are ready to trade in civilian life for military life.\n\nFive Idaho high school graduates from across the state are hanging up their street clothes for the Navy’s blue and gold uniforms, as they move to Annapolis, Md., this month to attend the U.S. Naval Academy.\n\nNearly 16,000 students from across the nation applied for one of 1,165 appointments to the Naval Academy’s Class of 2022. In Idaho, 55 students applied.\n\nThe admissions process requires each student to apply for and receive a nomination from their congressman or senator, complete a medical and physical fitness exam, submit transcripts, recommendations and essays. Screening is thorough, with a focus on well-rounded individuals who have demonstrated leadership potential and a willingness to accept responsibility, as well as outstanding academic credentials.\n\nAn appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy is equivalent to a full four-year scholarship valued at nearly $450,000 including tuition, room and board, medical and dental benefits and a monthly midshipman salary. After completing the four-year curriculum at the Naval Academy, students receive a bachelor of science degree in one of 25 majors and earn a commission as an officer in the United States Navy or Marine Corps.\n\nTake a look at the five students who are headed to Maryland.\n\nJamison Julian, a graduate of Nampa’s Columbia High School\n\nSponsored by: Rep. Raul Labrador, Sen. Mike Crapo and Sen. Jim Risch\n\nGrade-point average: 4.2\n\nSAT score: 1430 out of 1500\n\nMajor: Oceanography\n\nDream Job: Fighter Pilot, Astronaut or U.S. Ambassador\n\nWhy did you apply to the U.S. Naval Academy? The Naval Academy offers an unparalleled opportunity to pursue leadership, service and adventure with no monetary cost.\n\nWhat do you hope to gain from the U.S. Naval Academy? Leadership is my passion — I know I will be a better leader and person graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy than I would be at any other institution.\n\nJoey Gibbs, a graduate of Kellogg High school\n\nSponsored by: Sen. Mike Crapo and Sen. Jim Risch\n\nGrade-point average: 3.6\n\nSAT score: 1300 out of 1500\n\nMajor: Aerospace engineering\n\nDream Job: Become a pilot in the Navy serving for at least 20 years and then become a commercial pilot or working as a contractor to design and build more advanced aircraft.\n\nWhy did you apply to the U.S. Naval Academy? To fulfill my lifelong dreams of becoming a pilot and serving in the military.\n\nWhat do you hope to gain from the U.S. Naval Academy? I hope to gain a set of skills that will not only prepare me for my life ahead, but to allow me to become successful in every avenue that my life chooses to take for me. Whether it be mental or physical obstacles or determination sticking through a project to the end.\n\nDamien Stonhill, a gradate of Hillcrest High School in Ammon\n\nLandon Nurge, a gradate of Wood River High School"
