        "meta_description": "These teens are ready to trade in civilian life for military life.\n\nFive Idaho high school graduates from across the state are hanging up their street clothes for the Navy&rsquo;s blue and gold uniforms, as they move to Annapolis, Md., this month to attend the U.S. Naval Academy.\n\nNearly 16,000 students from across the nation applied for one of 1,165 appointments to the Naval Academy&rsquo;s Class of 2022. In Idaho, 55 students applied.\n\nThe admissions process requires each student to apply for and receive a nomination from their congressman or senator, complete a medical and physical fitness exam, submit transcripts, recommendations and essays. Screening is thorough, with a focus on well-rounded individuals who have demonstrated leadership potential and a willingness to accept responsibility, as well as outstanding academic credentials.\n\nAn appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy is equivalent to a full four-year scholarship valued at nearly $450,000 including tuition, room and board, medical and dental benefits and a monthly midshipman salary. After completing the four-year curriculum at the Naval Academy, students receive a bachelor of science degree in one of 25 majors and earn a commission as an officer in the United States Navy or Marine Corps.\n\nTake a look at the five students who are headed to Maryland.\n\nJAMISON JULIAN, A GRADUATE OF NAMPA&rsquo;S COLUMBIA HIGH SCHOOL\nSponsored by: Rep.
