        "text": "Donna Solomon, DVM\n\nVeterinarian\n\nMichigan State University, ’86\n\nI always knew I wanted to be a veterinarian. In first grade, I would bring home dogs and cats that I believed to be homeless. Fortunately, my older sister would later return them to their rightful homes. As a teenager, I spent my summers shadowing a large animal veterinarian on farm rounds in Petoskey, Michigan. In the winters, I would volunteer at a local animal shelter and give baths to dogs awaiting adoption. In high school, I worked as a veterinarian’s assistant at a local veterinary clinic in Southfield, Michigan. Fortunately, during my third year of undergraduate education, I was accepted to Michigan State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine. In 1986, I graduated and have loved practicing veterinary medicine every day since.\n\nMy first job as a small animal veterinarian was in Farmingdale, New York. I loved living in New York, but I knew in my heart that it would never be a place I’d call home. In 1997, I moved to Chicago and knew instantly that I would make this city my home. I joined a fast paced, high quality clinic and polished and honed my skills. In May 1990, I realized my second dream and opened my own practice – the Animal Medical Center of Chicago. I renovated a Victorian home in the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago and turned it into a modern veterinary clinic. In 2004, I expanded the facility adding state-of-the art amenities to accommodate the growing practice.\n\nAlthough it’s been over three decades since I graduated from veterinary school, I continue to enjoy learning daily, caring for pets, and interacting with clients. If you ask my clients what makes me special as a veterinarian, I believe that they would say I have great intuition and am their pet’s best advocate for good health. I believe what makes me special is my ability to listen closely to my clients, gather important findings from a comprehensive physical examination, and then, strategically formulate a diagnostic and treatment plan. If I have any questions or unsure of what to do, I do not hesitate to ask or involve a specialist. I’m a great captain of your pet’s health team.\n\nMy professional areas of interest span preventative care, pain management, internal medicine, soft tissue surgery and dentistry. Client education is also a passion of mine and I strongly believe it does not end in the examination room. I make myself readily available to my clients for telephone updates and consultations. Over the years, I’ve written numerous pet-related blogs and articles to help educate pet parents nationwide. I believe an educated pet client is the best pet parent.\n\nFor over 35 years, I’ve been married to Brad Ginn, an Ombuds at Argonne National Research Laboratory. We have 2 adult sons, Jacob and Sam. My best friend and shadow is a 6-year-old Bernedoodle, named Clara and I eagerly anticipate adopting 2 cats shortly to complete our home.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with the saying that “time flies when you are having fun”. It’s been an unbelievable fast 34 years since I opened Animal Medical Center of Chicago. I have been exceedingly fortunate that my dreams of becoming a veterinarian and owning my own practice have come true. I am humbled and grateful to be working with so many truly amazing and talented people at AMCOC, and am honored by the loyal pet-loving clientele who have entrusted me in their care.\n\nI truly love caring for dogs and cats every day. I look forward to helping you and your pet.\n\nMeg Ogishi, DVM\n\nVeterinarian\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison, ’90\n\nFrom a very young age Dr. Meg Ogishi knew she wanted to work with animals and become a veterinarian. Growing up in Greendale, Wisconsin, she would find baby bunnies to care for, and was always searching for toads and snakes to play with. She also had a parakeet, fish, rabbit, and an ill behaved Cocker Spaniel named Don. She has no idea why she chose that name! Meg truly enjoyed taking AP biology her senior year in high school, and this experience made her dream of becoming a veterinarian seem realistic.\n\nMeg obtained a Bachelor of Science in Zoology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1996. During her undergraduate studies she was a ski instructor for the ski club, volunteered in the wildlife department of the Milwaukee humane society and also cleaned kennels and large animal stalls at the UW Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital. She even kept a hamster in her dorm room closet her freshman year of college, much to the chagrin of her roommate. During veterinary school, she worked as an operating room assistant/technician in both large and small animal surgery. She graduated from University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine with Phi Zeta honors in May of 2000. Meg worked at Carlson Animal Hospital in Oak Park, Illinois immediately after graduation, and continued to work there until September of 2012, when she joined the Animal Medical Center of Chicago team. She loves working in the city, and being a part of such a talented and caring team.\n\nWhen she’s not at work, Meg enjoys hiking, snowboarding, running, reading and has recently taken up sprint distance triathlons. Meg and her husband Ryan live in the Andersonville neighborhood. They have a 5 year old daughter named Naomi, who loves cats and plans to become a cat doctor. Meg and Naomi volunteer together at Tree House cat shelter. Their household also includes Abigail a 14 year old red Doberman, Sheneh an 8 year old Pitbull mix, Pig a 9 year old cat, Sophie a 1 year old aquatic turtle, a beta fish and 2 chickens.\n\nTim England, DVM\n\nVeterinarian\n\nMichigan State University, ’87\n\nI was born in a rural area outside of a very small town in southern Michigan. My parents still live in the same home near Parma where I was raised. We had dogs, cats, hamsters, fish, rabbits, geese, ducks and assorted chickens during my childhood. I have always been fascinated by animals and loved learning everything I could about pets and wildlife. I can remember watching Wild Kingdom and documentaries on animals from a very young age. The idea of becoming a veterinarian was very appealing to me as a young child, but was tempered by my aversion to blood and body secretions. Luckily, I outgrew that by high school when I decided to attend Michigan State University with the goal to attend veterinary school.\n\nDuring my pre-veterinary coursework at MSU, I majored in Physiology and Fisheries & Wildlife. Through hard work and study, I was accepted into the veterinary program in my third year of undergrad. I received a bachelor degree in Veterinary Medicine from Michigan State University in 1987 and my doctorate degree in 1989. During my time at MSU, I realized that exotic pets were not receiving the same level of medical care as conventional pets like dogs and cats. I was lucky enough to participate in an externship in Miami, Florida which allowed me to learn skills in the care of unconventional pets and zoo animals. I had patients there which included leopards, monkeys, crocodiles, and many species of parrots.\n\nMy first years of practice were spent in Jackson, Michigan. Initially, I worked at a small animal practice which allowed me to continue to see exotic pets, as well as, dogs and cats. In 1992, I started my own practice in Jackson and three years later designed and oversaw the construction of a new veterinary hospital. Our success allowed the hospital to quickly expand to a three doctor practice to care for our growing number of patients. In 2008, I sold the practice and joined the team at Animal Medical Center of Chicago.\n\nSince joining this practice I have continued to enjoy treating dogs, cats and some exotic pets. I have a developed an interest in veterinary dentistry after having the opportunity to learn from Dr. Cindy Charlier, a board certified veterinary dentist. I also have an interest in nutrition and prevention of pet obesity. I am a member of many veterinary associations, both locally and nationally. I currently serve on the Animal Welfare Committee of the Association of Avian Veterinarians.\n\nOutside of work I have multiple interests, including international travel, photography, and eating good food. My partner and I have a small farm in Southwest Michigan where we grow fruits, vegetables, and bees for honey production. We share our home with a French bulldog named Gladys, as well as, two senior citizen parrots, Griffin & Gator. We also have a cat, Sprout and a koi pond at our home in Michigan. I enjoy working at AMC because of the commitment to quality and the expectation of our clients to provide the best care for their pets.\n\nElaine Simpson, DVM\n\nVeterinarian\n\nThe Ohio State University, ’14\n\nSince childhood, Dr. Elaine Simpson has had a passion for animals. Growing up in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, she spent time at Busse Wood: canoeing, fishing, and searching for wildlife. She even created a small pond in her backyard for the fish she caught – ultimately deciding it was best for them to go back and live in the wild.\n\nDr. Simpson obtained a Bachelor of Art in Biology from Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, Ohio) in 2010. Not only focused on her studies, Dr. Simpson ran cross country and track. She ultimately achieved All-American status at the national cross country meet in 2009. Dr. Simpson went on to study Veterinary Medicine at The Ohio State University, graduating magna cum laude in 2014. After graduation, she participated in a veterinary internship at Colorado State University which furthered her knowledge in internal medicine and emergency medicine. During this internship, she rescued and adopted a homeless pitbull-mix with fractured hindlegs. Lentil, who is now 3 years old, has become a wonderful city dog!\n\nAfter Colorado State University, Dr. Simpson returned to the Chicagoland area where she worked at Countryside Veterinary Center, as both a general practice and an emergency medicine veterinarian. Her favorite parts of veterinary medicine are internal medicine, feline medicine, and cardiology. She also loves developing long term relationships with owners and their pets.\n\nDuring her free time, Dr. Simpson loves to spend time outdoors, gardening, and with her family and friends. She also loves eating at new restaurants! In addition to Lentil, Dr. Simpson shares her home with a 7-year-old orange tabby cat, named Finn, who can be quite sassy!\n\nDr. Simpson joined the AMC team in 2017 and is excited to be practicing with such a dedicated and caring group."
