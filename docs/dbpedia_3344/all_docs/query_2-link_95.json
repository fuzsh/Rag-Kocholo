        "text": "Brenan Nierman\n\nQ: How long have you been working at Capital Caring and what is your role?\n\nA: Over 15 years as a social worker on the Arlington team.\n\nQ: What are you looking forward to about being an Employee Ambassador?\n\nA: Serving my colleagues and the mission we all share. In a nutshell, an ambassador is a position of service.\n\nQ: What would you like to share to help other employees get to know you?\n\nA: I have many interests and enthusiasms: reading literature and mysteries (I’m a huge Inspector Morse fan), poetry (which I read and write: Housman, Keats, Kipling, Poe, Dickinson are favorites), history and biography, watching films and sometimes collecting movie one-sheets from films I particularly love like FAREWELL MY LOVELY, LA CONFIDENTIAL, CHINATOWN and ONCE UPON A TIME…IN HOLLY WOOD (my all-time favorite).\n\nFor the first ten years of my life, I rode horses, growing up on a horse farm where my parents raised and bred Arabian horses.\n\nI consider myself a political junkie, and got in my first political argument in 1968, when I was in the third grade of elementary school\n\nI went to Staunton Military Academy and thrived in that environment. That school basically shaped me into who I am today.\n\nAfter graduating from Gettysburg College, I spent 15 months in a Jesuit novitiate to prepare for the priesthood, but as I sometimes tell others, when I realized I enjoyed talking with the girls who worked n the refectory there rather than gossiping with the priests and brothers over coffee, the sign marked “EXIT” was already on the wall. I then came to DC and went to social work school at The Catholic University of America, then earned another graduate degree from Georgetown. My first social work job was being Director of Social Services at Christ House, which is an in-patient medical facility for the homeless. After doing that for several years, I started the Early Head start program in Arlington and then managed health access programs in collaboration with Fairfax County.\n\nI am married to my beloved wife and best friend Josefina “Fina”, who is from the Bicol province in the Philippines, which is where we hope to retire. I have two children, our daughter Jereille, and my son Frankie. We also have a cat, Happypawn, who is named after Jennifer Yu, a young lady who won the United States Women’s Chess Championship in 2019, with an almost perfect score.\n\nMichael Toohig’s Story\n\nA life of travel and adventure\n\nMichael Toohig was stationed in Europe during World War II with the US Army. When the war ended, he took a side trip to Ireland to see his ancestral homeland and his grandmother. During the trip, he made the local paper as the first “Yank” to come to town.\n\nThat fateful trip was the start of a lifetime of traveling for Michael. It also illustrated his deep and lasting dedication to his family, and not least, his ability to make a splash in all his endeavors, from building a successful, close-knit family to a career that would include others kinds of ‘firsts’ as he worked to develop groundbreaking new technologies.\n\nA large Irish Catholic family\n\nMichael grew up in a large working class family in Lawrence, Massachusetts. He was the oldest son of eight siblings. His parents Timothy Toohig and Catherine “Kitty” Toohig were Irish Catholic immigrants who met in America at an Irish dance. His father was a butcher and his mother a seamstress. The children also worked to help support the family. In the summertime, Michael harvested hay and weeded vegetable gardens at area farms. One winter, he recalls working at an ice house where he was responsible for floating the ice down from the lake to the processing house.\n\nMichael enjoyed playing sports with the other kids in town and swimming in the river below the cliff where he lived. During the school year he studied hard. Only a few people from town went to college at the time, but Michael was one of the few who got a scholarship to go to Boston College when he was 17.\n\nLiberating Europe\n\nAfter a year in college, Michael joined the Army and fought in World War II. He remained in Europe long enough to stop the Germans from coming through the Alps at the St. Bernard Pass, liberate concentration camps and celebrate with thousands of people in Augsbourg as the American Army tanks rolled in when the war ended. To this day he has two pieces of Lira he took as a souvenir from a bank that he helped to liberate from German occupation.\n\nMichael treasured the trip to Ireland he took after the war because he could see where his parents had grown up. He met his 90-year old paternal grandmother and his maternal grandfather. His grandmother was so excited she hitched up the horse to a jaunting cart and headed off to church with herself and Michael in the back.\n\nBack at home, Michael returned to Boston College and graduated with a degree in Physics. After hitchhiking around the country and finding no jobs, he took advantage of the GI Bill to go on and earn a Master’s degree. When he finished, he went to work at Firestone where he helped design a recoilless rifle that was later used by militaries around the world, including the U.S. military. He also ran a test site at Lake Erie. When the company needed someone to travel around the country, they chose Michael, the resident bachelor, to go.\n\nBuilding a family and a career\n\nWithin a few years, Michael met his future wife Barbara while mingling at a Catholic social for young people in Fort Wayne, Indiana. They dated for three years before they got married. They went on to have five children: Aimee, Michele, Terrance, Timothy, and Delsina. The family lived in Fort Wayne and then later moved to Roanoke, Virginia.\n\nFamily has always been at the core of Michael’s life. “My dreams have been to have a good job, a professional job, to support myself and the family.”\n\nAnd he succeeded. After working at Firestone, Michael transitioned to a company working in the burgeoning fiber optics industry. There, he had a chance to work with Philo Farnsworth, who created the prototype of the first all-electric television. As a director of research, he oversaw a team that developed night vision goggles, which were also adopted by the military, and night vision telescopes. He became a leader in this technology and the company, and he would go on to be the first president of the Night Vision Goggles Association.\n\nExploring the world and keeping family close\n\nHe moved to another division of the company eventually, where he worked closely with Nobel Prize winner Charles Kao, who invented and developed fiber optics. By then, he was focused on international sales. He built sales networks in Puerto Rico, Mexico, Philippines, and many other places.\n\nAfter the kids were grown, Barbara often traveled with him. Sometimes the whole family would travel together. They especially enjoyed trips to Mexico and the beaches on the West Coast, which Michael describes as the most beautiful in the world.\n\nCloser to home, the family also enjoyed spending time at their historical log cabin at Smith Mountain Lake which Michael fixed up. He built a wrap around porch perfect for stargazing. He also loved tending his garden there.\n\nMichael is proud of the family he has raised. He is especially proud to have sent all five children to college. And now that his children have gone on to lead successful lives, he is proud that “the family is still united.” He still talks to his four living sisters every Thursday. His big family has only grown as it now includes 11 grandchildren and about 40 nieces and nephews, and Michael is glad that his five children call often or live close by.\n\nhttps://app.memorywell.com/story/706/memorywell/pdf\n\nMarrygold Ugorji’s Story\n\nReturning to work amid a pandemic\n\nMarrygold Ugorji was on leave from her job this spring with a sprained ankle when coronavirus case numbers began to spike in the Washington DC area. She watched the death toll rising on the news and worried about her impending return to work.\n\nAs a certified nursing assistant for Capital Caring Health, the region’s largest non-profit provider of elder health, advanced illness, hospice, and at-home care services, Marrygold is one of many frontline care workers whose jobs are more essential—and more dangerous—than ever as they risk exposing themselves and their families to coronavirus while caring for the most vulnerable patients often until the last breath, holding hands and comforting when family can’t.\n\n“What we are going through now is bad and it’s scary,” says Marrygold, a mother of four grown children with 20 years of experience as a nursing assistant.\n\nIn the beginning she worried that she would not have the personal protective equipment she needed. But by the time she was back on the schedule in May, the trunk of her car was stocked with N95 face masks, a face shield and a “little pharmacy” of disinfectants.\n\nShe also wanted to feel supported in a broader way. “You don’t ever want to get the feeling that, ‘Okay, you knew you signed up for this: just go out and get the job done,’” she says of a job where just okay is never enough for Marrygold.\n\nFeeling part of a team\n\nFortunately, the morning that she finally got the call to visit her first Covid 19 patient, a scheduler on the other end of the line—someone she had never met in person—put her at ease. She assured Marrygold that another certified nursing assistant would also be there, and that she was part of a team. “She was like a friend,” Marrygold says.\n\nSo, she drove to the skilled nursing facility and steeled her courage in the car. She put on her foot coverings, an N95 mask and a surgical mask.\n\nInside the building, in a “clean room,” she met her colleague and they helped each other with the rest of their protective equipment: a full gown, a head covering and a face shield. With both masks and the shield, it was hard to breathe, she says, but she continued on.\n\n“I went in with a positive mindset,” she says, “and we gave excellent care.”\n\nShe left the protective gowns in the “dirty room” on her way out of the facility that day and drove home. Then she took a hot shower and washed her hair before facing her husband and daughter.\n\nCaregiving came naturally\n\nBeing a caregiver has always come naturally to Marrygold. She grew up with a large extended family in the U.S. Virgin Islands and watched her aunt repeatedly step in and care for family members when they became ill or needed help.\n\nWhen she was 16, she moved to New Jersey to attend a vocational school and study culinary arts. She got a job working in the kitchen of a nursing home. But she soon realized that instead of over the stove, she wanted to be in the dining room helping the elderly residents. So, she trained to become a certified nursing assistant.\n\nShe spent the next decade working in the geriatric unit of a New Jersey State psychiatric hospital. In 2010, love brought her to Northern Virginia. She married her soul mate, a spiritual and thoughtful man from Nigeria, and they joined their lives.\n\nShe started working in an assisted living community, where she encountered hospice care services more often. She recalls building relationships with residents and then losing them.\n\nThere was one man who was often angry with his caregivers, but who would calm down with Marrygold. During his last days, she would visit him and sit by his bedside.\n\n“I remember holding his hand and giving him that sense of comfort and telling him it’s okay,” she says. “It was in that moment that I felt: This is where I need to be.”\n\nLove, too, is part of the job\n\nThat was her gift to him—and his parting gift to her. Not long after, she went to work for Capital Caring, focusing her energies on people at the end of their lives.\n\nThe care plan she follows for each patient is only part of the care she provides, she says. She offers comfort in the form of a light massage or a listening ear or some calming music. She likes to sing to her patients, Caribbean songs she grew up with or inspirational music.\n\n“My husband always tells me this kind of work is very easy for me,” she says. “I am very humble, and I am someone who shows empathy to others.”\n\nMarrygold describes another patient who stands out in her memory. She went to say goodbye to one afternoon, not knowing if she would still be there the next time she came to work. The woman leaned in and whispered, “I love you.”\n\nLove, too, is part of the job, Marrygold says.\n\n“It’s okay to love your patients,” she says, especially in these troubled times. “God loves all of us. Why can’t we love each other?”\n\nEveryone has a story with a beginning, a middle and an end, Marrygold says, and it’s a privilege to be with them for the final chapter.\n\n“I am always grateful that they trust me to be part of the end of their story,” she says.\n\nhttps://app.memorywell.com/story/656/memorywell/pdf\n\nSherri Parker, Team Leader Medical Social Worker\n\nPrimary care at home\n\nSherri Parker started her career as a social worker nearly 30 years ago working with hospice patients. Now she is leading an effort to bring care into the home much earlier for older adults who have an advanced illness or disability.\n\nPrimary Care At Home is a new program from Capital Caring Health, the largest non-profit provider of elder health, chronic illness, hospice, and at-home care services for the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. area.\n\n“A lot of patients have difficulty getting to the doctor, and now with Covid-19, it is even harder to get to the doctor,” she says. So this old fashioned house call program, as she calls it, brings home-based medical care, including visits from a doctor, a nurse practitioner and a social worker who all specialize in geriatrics. The team can provide in-home blood work or other diagnostic tests when needed. The goal is help people stay out of the emergency room or hospital and to age in place safely by addressing health concerns early. “With our help, these patients can still get outstanding care,” she says.\n\nSherri works with patients and families to access community resources and she runs a biweekly caregiver support group.\n\nThis work chose me\n\nWhen Sherri started college, she knew that she wanted to help people. She took classes in education and social work and in the end she “fell in love with social work.”\n\nDuring one of her social work classes, she received a field assignment in the oncology wing of a hospital. She found the experience very gratifying. Since then she has worked in home-based hospice and home health, in grief and bereavement counseling, and in acute care and long-term care settings. She has been at Capital Caring for 23 years.\n\nShe helps people think through what matters most to them and how they want to live in their final years. Sherri also enjoys mentoring graduate students and inspiring the next generation of social workers. “I love what I do so much that I think it filters over to them and they decide to stay,” she says.\n\n‘We are not letting Covid-19 stop us!’\n\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic has made in-home care more challenging, but the Primary Care At Home team is still working to help older adults who need services.\n\n“We are not letting Covid-19 stop us,” she says.\n\nSherri and the rest of the team are getting creative to make sure patients can access the care they need. In some cases, the team sends smartphones to patients who don’t have them so they can connect through Zoom. And they still visit patients and their families in person when necessary. She visits one patient at home who is blind, for example, and also calls her to check in by phone.\n\n“We use PPE and we can stay safe,” she says.\n\nAfter months of quarantining, in-person home visits can be really energizing, she says. Sherri recalls the joy she felt after visiting with a patient who lives alone and struggles with technology. It was a bittersweet farewell.\n\nBefore Covid-19, she would sometimes hug her patients goodbye, she says. Now she can’t do that. Instead, when she went outside the door, she removed her face shield and mask, so her patient could see her face and the emotion in her smile and tried to connect with her through the window. “With technology we can do a lot, but nothing can replace a hug.”\n\nAt home, she recharges with gardening. She took a recent trip with her husband to the beach, and she loves spending time with her family. Sherri is excited for the future and doesn’t see herself stopping this work anytime soon.\n\n“Some people go to a job and come home but this isn’t that. It is more like I can’t imagine doing anything else that would bring me this much fulfillment. I feel like I make a difference everyday,” she says.\n\nhttps://app.memorywell.com/story/710/memorywell/pdf\n\nColleen Carberry, RN Case Manager\n\nNursing through a pandemic\n\nThroughout her more than 20-year career as a hospice care nurse, Colleen Carberry has never appreciated the healing power of a smile—or a touch—more than she does now.\n\nIn the midst of a pandemic, she still provides in-person care for patients approaching end of life and comforts their families. But she can no longer hold their hands or give them a hug. And with a mask covering her face during visits, she can no longer even share a smile.\n\nA coincidental start to nursing\n\nColleen started her nursing career 27 years ago. At the time, she was a recent college graduate working at a surf shop in Virginia Beach when one of her coworkers brought in a brochure for nursing school orientation. Colleen agreed to attend the orientation and found a lasting fit.\n\nShe was drawn to hospice care early on because of the intimacy of the work, she says. After working as a nurse care manager and educating doctors, nursing homes, and hospitals about hospice care, she wanted to focus on direct patient interactions and she took a job at Capital Caring Health, the largest non-profit provider of elder health, advanced illness, hospice, and at-home care services for the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. area.\n\n“There is something beautiful about holding someone’s hand as they take their last breath,” Colleen says. “It moves me to see my patients smile and relax as they cross that threshold and are finally comfortable again.”\n\nAn emphasis on touch\n\nThe novel coronavirus has made it more difficult to share in those intimate moments. Physical distancing protocols are taking a toll on her patients and their families.\n\nIn assisted living, she sees family members come to the window of the facility in order to “hold hands” with their loved ones, some of whom don’t understand why they cannot be hugged in person.\n\nThe changes are especially difficult for patients with dementia, who rely more on facial recognition and facial cues for connection. “The masks may seem scary to them,” she says. “They are confused.”\n\nWithout the ability to smile or hold hands, she is spending more time in conversation with patients and families and trying to show her empathy through active listening.\n\n“I believe that the job of a nurse is to comfort and give peace,” she says.\n\nThat affects what she sees as a central part of her work. “I love caring for my patients and their families,” Colleen says. “I like to love on their mind, body, and spirit.”\n\nCarberry is one of thousands of frontline care workers who are taking risks each day to attend to the needs of their patients. In the first few months of the pandemic, she did not have any covid-positive patients, but she saw first-hand how the threat of the virus is dramatically transforming care for millions of older adults even through their final days.\n\nhttps://app.memorywell.com/story/664/memorywell/pdf\n\nPaulette Davidson, Chaplain\n\nThe silent voice praying by the bedside\n\nPaulette Davidson’s first job as a healthcare chaplain was at the top trauma hospital in Washington D.C. When patients were brought in from car accidents or with gunshot wounds or third-degree burns, she was there. “I was that silent voice praying by the bedside while doctors are working to save their lives,” she says.\n\nAnd when family members burst in — screaming, in shock, terrified — she was there to scream with them or hold their hands or calm them down so they could listen to the doctors.\n\nIn 2019, she accepted the job at Capital Caring, the largest non-profit provider of elder health, advanced illness, hospice, and at-home care services for the Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. area. She says she wanted to view death and grief from a different perspective — beyond that time of intense stress and loss. She wanted to help families the next day and the day after that as they came to terms with death.\n\n“I have seen it from the hospital,” she says. “I wanted to see it from the home.”\n\nA preachers’ kid\n\nPaulette grew up a “preachers’ kid” in Pittsburgh, the youngest of four children. Both her parents are pastors and her father has been working as a chaplain for the last 25 years at a VA hospital.\n\nShe studied business in college initially, then switched her major to social work. While in school she decided to enlist in the Army. At the time she says, “I couldn’t do a push up to save my life.” But she says the experience was transformative and taught her purpose and discipline. When she went back to finish her degree, she decided to join ROTC to become a leader in the Army. She decided to pursue military chaplaincy as a way help people.\n\nShe became pregnant in her last year of college. She chose an internship in a high school working with teen moms and dads. “I was 23 years old, becoming a new mom, and these were 16-year olds with young children. I was teaching them about education, and they were teaching me about parenting,” she says.\n\nShe has carried that teaching and learning philosophy with her into her career. In support groups, she leads by helping people learn from each other and find strength from within, she says.\n\nFrom military to healthcare chaplain\n\nWhen she graduated from college, she commissioned as an officer in 2010 and worked in the reserves while she enrolled at Howard University School of Divinity to pursue her Master’s degree.\n\nHer daughter was only 2 yrs old, and she was a single mom, living in a new city far from home. She worked hard and found success. After three years, she graduated and was ordained as an Elder in the Pentecostal church, though she emphasizes that chaplains do not discriminate, regardless if you are “Methodist or Buddhist or Wicken or Spiritual or not.”\n\nRather than going active duty with the military, as she had planned, she retired from the Army in October 2015 and applied for a clinical pastoral education residency with Medstar Washington Hospital Center so she could work in healthcare settings. “I fell in love with the work,” she says.\n\nNow, as a hospice and palliative care chaplain, her job is to address the emotional, psychological and spiritual needs of patients and families. She typically would visit a roster of patients in different assisted living communities, but the novel coronavirus pandemic has changed the daily rhythm of her job and the needs she is trying to meet.\n\nSpiritual care amid Covid-19\n\nNow she spends most of her time on the phone – often with family members who are worried about loved ones they can no longer see. She encourages new ways to connect with their loved ones, whether through technology or care packages or regular visits to the window to say hello.\n\nAnd she helps them identify meaningful ways to honor their loved one when they die, as most in-person memorial services have been put on hold. “If they liked to wear purple, wear purple. Choose a date on the calendar to remember them and light a purple candle. Their spirit/legacy is going to live on in you if you have a funeral or not,” she says.\n\nShe also runs a monthly bereavement support group. In her work, she says, she tries to meet people where they are. From a spiritual standpoint, she asks herself, “what is God trying to say to me and to this person in this moment,” she says.\n\nShe also helps people identify the things they are grateful about at difficult time – Grateful for zoom calls. Grateful for work. Grateful that their loved one is free from physical pain and the fear of an ongoing pandemic.\n\n“Even when we are discouraged, the sun still shines. The moon still rises. The world is still evolving,” she says.\n\nhttps://app.memorywell.com/story/714/memorywell/pdf\n\nDonna Smith\n\nLeading a program for children\n\nHelping others deal with grief and loss in so-called “normal” times is a challenge for healthcare workers. That challenge is often compounded when a child is lost, or a young person faces the death of a family member. But facing those challenges in a pandemic adds another layer of complexity to the task. To help meet those challenges, Capital Caring is tapping the talents of Donna Smith, a veteran counselor who led The Children’s Room, a groundbreaking non-profit organization designed to help grieving children and families.\n\nSmith has been working since April at Capital Caring Health, the largest non-profit provider of elder health, advanced illness, hospice, and at-home care services for the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. area.\n\nA midlife change\n\nDonna came to her role as a counselor after a midlife career change. At 35 she lost her mother, then five years later, her father died suddenly. After some introspection, Smith decided to leave her career in business. Armed with a degree in accounting, she had worked in small businesses in a variety of roles, but had found herself gravitating away from the numbers side of the business to the personal, working in human resources. Following her father’s death, she reevaluated her working life and decided to pursue a job totally focused on helping people.\n\nShe decided to become a counselor, and she gravitated to helping families cope with loss. Her path led her to a part-time job at Children’s Room, the Arlington, Mass. based non-profit that provides grief support services for families and children up to age 19. The project had begun in 1993 as a single room within a hospice care facility set aside for the needs of children either housed in hospice care or visiting family members there. Smith went on to develop her part-time job into a full-fledged role as program director, serving in that role from 2005 to 2010, and then took over as executive director of the non-profit. When she stepped down in 2017, the Children’s Room team hailed her service and her leadership. She was credited with developing programs like Parenting While Grieving and the Teen Program during her tenure.\n\nIn March, 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic began to take hold, Capital Caring hired Smith to develop programs to help children deal with the crisis. The children’s program was set up within Capital Caring’s hospice care program where a teamwork structure is well matched to the new task, Smith says.\n\nBuilding on experience\n\nSmith is drawing on her Children’s Room experiences in her new role as a grief counselor. A key hallmark of the work at Children’s Room was flexibility, the need to adapt to each child’s specific needs, and she is applying that in her new mission. For example, Smith cited the case of a mother and her two children, a 10-year-old son and eight-year old daughter who had been home when their father suffered a fatal heart attack. The family came to Children’s Room for support, but the daughter felt like she bonded more with adults rather than a children’s group. So after becoming a familiar face in the Children’s Room community, she was allowed to join a teen group with older children who had come to know her. One of the older members of the group was a Harvard student whose parent had been killed in Oregon. They bonded and together created a theater piece, a project that helped them both. The little girl would go on to form a performance group as a teenager, and later she became an art student. That bonding at Children’s Room “had an enormous impact on her,” Smith says. It shows the “difference you can make if you are grounded in the community, and not giving time limited services.”\n\nAs the Capital Caring hospice staff members find themselves working with more children who are losing family members to the virus, the challenges are mounting. Creating community has been difficult in the current situation, given social distancing and the necessity of communicating virtually. The program also has developed family circle times, bringing multiple families together, and setting up break out rooms with activities for children. To encourage communication about their feelings, Smith says the program has been using what she calls “question balls” – beach balls for each family labelled with fun questions about the person they have lost. “Nobody’s ever asked these questions,” Smith says, “(its’) amazing the discussion that comes after them.”\n\nThe resilience of children\n\nOne thing Smith has learned in her work, a lesson that has been underlined during the pandemic, is that children know how to work through grief, and often can talk more honestly about it than adults who sometimes are hampered by their reluctance to discuss their loss. The overwhelming burden of dealing with covid has made many people not wanting to think about the potential loss and that leads to avoidance. We are “so death avoidant in this culture,” Smith says. But for Smith and her fellow hospice workers they are “reminded every day that life is short,” and that spurs them to help families cope with the crisis.\n\n“The work that I do is so life affirming,” Smith says, adding that she feels “privileged and inspired to witness kids who went through something really, really hard and went out the other side even stronger.”\n\nIn her personal life, she draws comfort and support from her own two adult children and three grandchildren. When not at work, she spends a lot of time with her family, and as an “outdoorsy person” recharges by walking, running and hiking. An avowed explorer of new things, she also enjoys reading and cooking. But it is the teamwork and the resiliency of children that she finds in her work that also bring her joy.[/vc_column_text][vc_button border_width=”0″ link=”url:https%3A%2F%2Fapp.memorywell.com%2Fstory%2F722%2Fmemorywell%2Fpdf” icon=”fa fa-file-pdf-o”]PDF[/vc_button][/vc_column][/vc_row]\n\nNeil Parker’s Story\n\nA second chance\n\nNeil Parker’s long-lasting marriage and four beautiful children almost did not happen. He cancelled his engagement mere weeks before his wedding day more than a half century ago, wracked with a severe case of cold feet.\n\nBut a few months separated from young Frances Peltzman humbled him, and by the spring he was calling on her again. “I found out I really loved her,” he says of their time apart.\n\nFortunately for him, she agreed to take him back, and their elopement in the summer of 1965 opened the door to all the good things that followed.\n\nFrom Trenton to Yardley to Penn State\n\nNeil was born to Sydney and Rose Parker on September 14,1942 in Trenton, New Jersey. The couple went to the same high school and met on the bus to school.\n\nThey divorced when Neil was 3. His father owned a printing company and his mother worked for a children’s clothing store and later as a secretary at De Laval turbine company. She and her boss Fred fell in love, a romance that necessitated a change in jobs for her — she became a telephone operator — and led to their marriage. The family bought a house in Yardley, PA.\n\nGrowing up, Neil loved baseball and summer trips to Atlantic City with his grandmother.\n\nNeil’s father was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis when Neil was young. Sydney Parker lived with his parents after he got sick, and Neil recalls visits to their house on weekends. Sometimes his father would take him bowling. “He kept score and I bowled,” he recalls, noting his father had limited mobility.\n\nNeil graduated from Pennsbury high school in Yardley and went on to college at Penn State. He played minor league football and earned his degree in rehabilitation education. He was interested in working with people with disabilities like his father.\n\nA blind date\n\nDuring his senior year, Neil met Fran on a blind date. She was working at the New Jersey Department of Health at the time. They got engaged soon after Neil graduated from college and planned a big family wedding. But weeks before their big day, Neil cancelled the wedding.\n\nFran was devastated. She quit her job and moved to New York City to start fresh. Neil joined the National Guard, training at Fort Dix in Trenton. But several months later his heart pulled him back and he went to find her again. They went to the World’s Fair on a date in the spring of 1965. He asked her to marry him again that weekend. She said no. With some coaxing from her best friend, Fran saw him again, and they agreed to get married.\n\nTheir wedding almost did not happen a second time. They found a justice of the peace to marry them, but the judge rejected Fran’s official documentation, a birth certificate that had been doctored to help her get into a club when she was 17. One reissued official birth certificate later, they drove to Maryland and tied the knot on July 31, 1965.\n\n“Nobody knew about it but us,” Fran says. “I was shaking. He was shaking.”\n\nThe only thing scarier was telling their parents. “We had to go face the music,” says Neil. He knew he had to earn back the trust of Fran’s parents. And he did.\n\n“I think it was two years before my father said, ‘Neil, you are good man,’” Fran says.\n\nFrom Philadelphia to Northern Virginia\n\nThe couple moved to Philadelphia and Neil got a job as a case worker. He made home visits to determine eligibility for public assistance. On weekends he served in the National Guard. On August 1966, their daughter Sherri Lynn was born. A year later, Scott David was born.\n\nNeil went back to school in the evenings and got his Masters degree in Counseling and Guidance at Temple University. He got a job in Washington DC and the family moved to Virginia when Sherri was five years old and Scott was four years old.\n\nHe worked at the College Board, where he tested and counseled teenagers for college readiness. After two years, he was hired by DC government, where he worked with minority youth, including those who were disabled or who had been incarcerated, to help them find jobs. He later became a program analyst.\n\nFran and Neil had two more children, Frank Paul in 1972 and Michael Alan in 1975. They bought a house in Vienna when Frank was born. Neil coached Little League on the weekends. And in the summers he took his kids to the same stretch of beach in Atlantic City that he used to go to as a child.\n\nHe retired after 23 years with the DC government. He missed working with youth, though, and for several years he was a substitute teacher in the Fairfax County schools.\n\nThe children loved him, Fran recalls, and delighted in his stories – like the time he and Fran accidentally brought a gecco home in their suitcase from a vacation in Costa Rica. They found it two days later in a roll top desk and set it free in a park, where the neighborhood kids would go and look for it.\n\nA close-knot international family nearby\n\nAs their children grew up and got married, the Parker family became increasingly international. Neil and Fran welcomed a daughter-in-law from Mexico, another from Poland, and a third with Japanese ancestry who was born and raised in Lima, Peru.\n\nThe extended family lives close to each other and they pitch in to help one another. Neil’s mother lived with him and Fran for ten years before she died, and they helped her through cancer treatment. Then in 2016, they moved into Sherri’s home, the same year Neil was diagnosed with Parkinson’s.\n\nNow his grandchildren go for walks with him and they are very happy to be quarantining together. Neil still loves sports and rooting for the Nationals and the former Washington Redskins.\n\nhttps://app.memorywell.com/story/684/memorywell/pdf\n\nSulaiman Bangura’s Story\n\nSeeking a better life\n\nWhen Sulaiman Bangura came to America from Sierra Leone 17 years ago at the age of 23, he was seeking a better life. He found it not only in the United States, but also through a rewarding career in nursing.\n\nNow as an RN for at-home hospice services with Capital Caring Health, the largest non-profit provider of elder health, advanced illness, hospice, and at-home care services for the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington D.C. area, Bangura looks forward to seeing his patients every day.\n\nMore than just a job\n\n“When I first got to the United States, someone told me that I should become a certified nursing assistant,” say Bangura. “They said it was a field where you can always get a job.”\n\nBut it soon became more than a job to Bangura; it was a calling. He progressed from working as a CNA at a nursing home to becoming a Licensed Practical Nurse. He then trained to become a Registered Nurse and ultimately got his Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree.\n\nHe has worked at Capital Caring for the past 13 years, where he has become passionate about helping people at the end of life. “I fell in love with the job,” Bangura says. “Every patient is unique. You never know who you’ll meet with each admission.”\n\nCovid concerns\n\nThe onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic dramatically changed his work. Suddenly he had to connect with patients through virtual telehealth visits.\n\nBangura says that was really hard. “Part of our job is to make patients feel like they aren’t alone, like someone is there to listen,” he says.\n\nSince the hospice team has been able to make home visits again, they have been careful to take precautions for both the patients and themselves. They pre-screen patients, as well as any family member or caretaker who’ll be present, to check for common symptoms of the virus before each visit.\n\nBangura goes home each night to his wife, three children and both his mother and mother-in-law, and so he worries about getting the virus or bringing it home. But he says everyone is very mindful about safety at work. “We wear face masks and shields and I wash my hands and sanitize all the time,” he explains. “And then I wash my clothes as soon as I get back home.”\n\nThe pandemic has been stressful for everyone, Bangura says, but he believes it’s been especially hard on nurses because of the way it impacts the way they can provide care.\n\n“Hospice is a special kind of nursing,“ he explains. “It’s not just about caring for the patient, but also the family.” He says working with patients at the end of life is very personal. It’s important to build confidence and trust with the patient and their family and to let them know that someone is there for them. The most important thing, he says, is to treat each patient with respect and dignity, whether that’s in person or virtually.\n\nLife’s blessings\n\nBangura’s key to managing stress is taking one day at a time. In his spare time he likes to listen to music. He enjoys reading books. And he’s very interested in the politics of his adopted country. Bangura walks often and has an exercise machine at home, both of which are great for managing stress. But he especially enjoys weekends watching soccer with his friends.\n\nMost of all, Bangura is passionate about his job in hospice care. “I wish more people were aware of hospice services — it’s such a huge blessing,” he says, adding that hospice patients tend to live a little longer, especially when they begin soon after their end of life diagnosis.\n\nSulaiman was recently recognized as a Special Ceca Foundation Award Winner for his dedication and professionalism as an RN case manager. His hospice patients and their families were quick to praise his work, saying he consistently displays compassion and goes above and beyond for all his patients.\n\nThis is a job where caring for others is just second nature, but Bangura would be the first to tell you he gets much more in return. “When a patient says, ‘Thank you so much,’ it really makes my day,” he says. “It’s just a special feeling to be able to help.”\n\nhttps://app.memorywell.com/story/728/memorywell/pdf\n\nSteven Skobel’s Story\n\nDealing with loss: the nature of the business\n\nHelping families cope with loss is an intrinsic part of daily work for Steven Skobel, a palliative care nurse practitioner. “Anyone who works in this business knows in their soul of understanding this is the nature of the business,” he says.\n\nAt Capital Caring Health, the largest non-profit provider of elder health, advanced illness, hospice, and at-home care services for the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. area, he tends to the needs of patients and families alike as a life comes to an end. But even with that familiarity, it has been a challenge to cope with the sheer volume of Covid-19 deaths. There is no escaping the shadow of the pandemic at work, and away from the hospital Skobel and his colleagues have had to find new ways to recharge their batteries for another challenging shift.\n\nA medical embrace\n\nAs an expert in the field of palliative care, Skobel is part of a relatively new discipline, but one with deep roots in the very origins of nursing. The first hospice was founded in the U.K. after World War II, and in 1990, the World Health Organization recognized palliative care as a specialty dedicated to relieving suffering and improving quality of life for people with serious illnesses. The specialty takes its name from the Latin word, pallium, meaning “cloak.”\n\nEssentially, palliative care wraps the patient and their family in a sort of medical embrace, a way to ease the journey.\n\nSkobel’s career has paralleled the enormous growth in palliative care across the country. He earned his degree in 1991, his master’s in 1998, and a doctorate in 2005. When he first entered nursing school, there were just a handful of men in his class. Over time the profession has become more diverse, embracing more men and a broad mix of ethnic and cultural backgrounds.\n\nA job transformed\n\nNo one enters nursing without knowing that it is a “very dangerous” occupation, he says, and there have been diseases in the past that have threatened health providers. What is different with Covid-19 is the scope of the outbreak, he says. It is on a scale that has not been seen since the 1918 Spanish influenza epidemic.\n\nBecause of the high number of Covid-related deaths, he has been working as a full-time member of the intensive care team, combining his palliative care expertise with other nursing skills needed in the intensive care unit which, at one point, was operating an extended ward to cope with overflow.\n\nBefore Covid-19, Skobel was used to seeing families cope with both sudden, unexpected loss and those who have some warning of what is ahead. Perhaps a bad case of pneumonia takes hold unexpectedly, or a longtime cancer winds towards an inevitable end. Family members might be at a patient’s bedside for two or three weeks. Skobel would guide families through the final days, or hours as they sat bedside, able to touch, talk, and comfort their loved one, and, in turn be comforted by nurses and doctors.\n\nBut now, in the midst of a pandemic, that family comfort and professional guidance must come at a distance, with farewells said via FaceTime, and updates and developments delivered by phone or text message.\n\nRecharging for the future\n\nIn recent weeks, the number of cases his team is seeing has fallen. “But it’s a certainty we will see another wave,” he says.\n\nHe believes the medical teams battling the virus are better prepared as new patients come in, thanks to a steep learning curve about which drugs work and help flatten the curve. His fellow professionals also have been sharing both formal research from noted journals, and the sort of anecdotal information grounded in daily experiences.\n\nLike everyone else, his life beyond the hospital has changed. “Before Covid I would go to the gym three times a week,” he says, “and I played in a men’s baseball league on Sundays.” Now, he does the family grocery shopping in his scrubs and face mask as he heads home to his wife and one of two daughters who are sheltering in place. He and his wife are walking the family dog daily. Recharging his batteries in new ways.\n\nDealing with a pandemic has reinforced a fundamental truth he holds about his chosen profession. As he tells nursing students: “All nurses understand palliative care — that’s why they got into this.”\n\nhttps://app.memorywell.com/story/665/memorywell/pdf\n\nTom Koutsoumpas\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nTom Koutsoumpas serves as President and CEO of Capital Caring Health, one of the largest not-for-profit hospice and advanced illness care providers in the nation.
