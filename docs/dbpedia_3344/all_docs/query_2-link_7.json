        "text": "BYU-Idaho Radio · Interview with Idaho Congressional candidate Bryan Smith\n\nBryan Smith was born in Boise, Idaho, in 1963 and graduated from Nampa High School in 1980. Smith attended Ricks College and later graduated from Brigham Young University in Provo with a degree in English and University of the Pacific – McGeorge School of Law with a Juris Doctor of Law degree. He served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Netherlands and currently resides in Idaho Falls where he is a partner in Smith, Driscoll, and Associates, PLLC. Click here to learn more about his campaign.\n\nIn the interview with BYU-Idaho Radio, Smith shared a black and white photograph of his three great-great-great-uncles Dennis, Thomas, and David who are standing on a porch, beards growing down to their waistlines. They settled Canyon County in 1864. He has deep family roots in Idaho. Smith is running for Congress in support of the Pro-America-first agenda.\n\nHighlighted quotes from Congressional candidate Bryan Smith:\n\n“As Idaho 2nd Congressional representative, I would always put Idahoans first. I would speak out for them. I would be a conservative voice for them in Washington, D.C. And so, with me in office, you would have somebody who supports what I believe is traditional Idaho values like farming, irrigation, and also Idaho’s economy compared to somebody like Congressman Simpson who has (I believe) lost touch with Idaho values.”\n\nOf the Snake River Dam demolition proposal:\n\n“I’m critical of [Mike Simpson’s] proposal simply because we don’t know if it will work, and only someone who’s been in Congress 22 years would actually propose something this major and not even know if it would work. And it will absolutely, what we know it will do, is it will have an adverse impact on Lewiston, on Idaho’s farming and ranching, and also…it threatens the electricity rates to increase.”\n\n“One of the things that I oppose is the overreach of federal government in our day-to-day lives. So now, what’s the topic of the day? Federal government’s trying to impose vaccine mandates on people, and if you don’t get a vaccine mandated by the federal government, you lose your job. That should never happen. The heavy hand of the federal government should be lifted off the people of Idaho.”\n\nBYU-Idaho Radio · Interview with Congressman Mike Simpson\n\nBio:\n\nMike Simpson has served in Congress for 22 years. He was born in Burley, Idaho and grew up in Blackfoot where he entered politics as a city council member and later a state representative. He is a graduate of Utah State University and earned his DMD from Washington University School of Dental Medicine. Click here to learn more about his campaign.\n\nIn an interview with BYU-Idaho Radio, Simpson shared his take on issues of the day like the Snake River Dam demolition proposal, the January 6th Commission, and big government spending.\n\nQuotes from Congressman Mike Simpson:\n\n“I’m a Republican. I’m a mainstream Republican. I believe in the Republican party because I believe in free enterprise, and I believe in smaller government, lower taxes, and so forth…[Idaho] is the greatest state I think in the nation. I love our environment. I love our people of Idaho. They’re good common-sense people, and that’s why I’ve spent my life here.”\n\nOf the Snake River Dam demolition proposal:\n\n“Yeah, there is a point of no return. What most fish biologists will tell you if you’re going to save these salmon, you’ve probably got three to four generations left before they go extinct, and everybody believes that they’re going to go extinct if we don’t do anything. When someone says to you, ‘I want to save salmon as much as you do, but I’m not going to take the dams out’ then what they’re saying is ‘I want to save salmon as much as you do if I don’t have to change anything I’m doing.’”"
