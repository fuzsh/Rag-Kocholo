        "text": "Timeline of Events & Milestones\n\nABOUT\n\nThe first comprehensive timeline of Stony Brook University history was compiled by Kristen J. Nyitray, Ann M. Becker (graduate student assistant) and Deborah Dolan (graduate student intern) between 1998 and 2000. Entries from the book Stony Brook: State University of New York (Arcadia Publishing, 2002) by Kristen J. Nyitray and Ann M. Becker have been added. Press releases issued by the Office of Media Relations were consulted for the most recent additions to the timeline.\n\nLast update: July 2020.\n\nTable 1: 1948 to 1969\n\nStart Date End Date Event 1948 New York State adopts the State University of New York system.

Sunwood will host recitals and visiting scholars. 1956-02 The Board of Trustees of the New York State University system recommends that a state-supported and state-operated college and graduate school be established on Long Island for the education of young men and women in the sciences, math, and engineering. 1956-10 The Board of Regents adopts the Board of Trustees’ recommendation to establish a college and graduate school on Long Island.
