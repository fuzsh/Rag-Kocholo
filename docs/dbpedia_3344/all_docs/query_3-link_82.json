Carey was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, August 12, 1878. His family was prominent in Cheyenne and he and his brother shared a comfortable childhood in the very large family home. Carey was educated in Cheyenne and then completed his education in the East, finishing at Yale. After his return, he became the manager of the family business (J.M. Carey and Brother) and helped it grow by using his education and willingness to experiment. Carey's experiments with irrigation and crop adaptability led others in their search for crops suited to the rugged central Wyoming climate. He was so successful that some of his crops won blue ribbon prizes at fairs in St. Louis and Sacramento. Business success led to political aspirations and Carey was the first Wyoming Governor to be elected by vox populi (the voting public). Carey served from January 6, 1919 to January 1, 1923.

Ross and came with him to Cheyenne for his new law practice. They had a good life together that culminated with William's election to Governor. Mrs. Ross was an avid ally of her husband and helped him in all of his political works. When William died in office, the Secretary of State as Acting Governor called for a special election. The Democratic party nominated Mrs. Ross to take over for her husband. Ross declined at first but upon reflection accepted the nomination to complete her husband's work. She also felt she was the best qualified to understand her husband's goals and work to realize them. The second Governor Ross won the election and became the first woman governor in the United States.

Thayer was born in Bellingham, Norfolk County, Massachusetts on January 24, 1820. Mr. Thayer attended rural schools and later studied law at Brown University. Arriving in Nebraska in 1854, he quickly affiliated himself with the Republican Party and thereafter actively participated in politics. Thayer served as delegate to the Convention which organized the Republican Party in the Nebraska Territory and was elected to the Nebraska Territorial Legislature in 1860-61. Then the future governor resigned to become a colonel in the First Nebraska Infantry and was promoted to brigadier-general in 1862. After the Civil War he was elected as one of the first two United States senators from Nebraska and served in the Senate until 1871. President Grant appointed Thayer Governor of the Wyoming Territory in February 1875 and he took the oath of office March 1, 1875. His service ended on May 29, 1878 and he returned to Nebraska to resumed his law practice. Thayer also served two consecutive terms as Governor of Nebraska, January 6, 1887 to January 8, 1891 and in 1892 retired from public life to follow literary pursuits. John M. Thayer died March 19, 1906.\n\nCollection\n\nFew of the records, about one half cubic foot, from the office of Wyoming’s second territorial governor have survived to be included in the collections of the state archives. Records from Governor John M. Thayer’s tenure are mostly petitions for the pardon of convicts. Some records dealing with Indian and military affairs have been saved.

Warren was appointed Territorial Governor of Wyoming by President Chester A. Arthur. He served from February 28, 1885 to November 11, 1886 and served a second term when appointed by President Benjamin Harrison from April 9, 1889 to October 11, 1890. Warren was born in Hinsdale, Berkshire County, Massachusetts on June 20, 1844 and attended the common schools in his area and Hinsdale Academy. During the Civil War Warren enlisted and fought with the Company C, 49th Regiment, Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, eventually advancing to non-commissioned officer. His service was highlighted by the award of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Warren also served as a Captain in the Massachusetts Militia. The future Governor farmed and raised stock in Massachusetts and then went to Wyoming in 1868. There the new Wyoming citizen operated a variety of businesses from real estate to livestock and promoted the first lighting system in Cheyenne, where he also served on the city council and the Territorial Assembly, becoming its president. Warren continued his interest in politics as chairman of the Republican Territorial Central Committee, Territorial Treasurer, and Mayor of Cheyenne. During his second term as Territorial Governor, Wyoming was granted statehood on July 10, 1890. Territorial Governor Warren was then elected Wyoming's first State Governor September 11, 1890* and served until he resigned to become Wyoming's second United States Senator on November 24, 1890. Senator Warren was serving in the Senate when he died November 24, 1929.\n\nCollection\n\nRecords of Governor Francis E. Warren’s first term as Territorial Governor of Wyoming feature the usual topics associated with the office. Notable issues include the Chinese massacre at Rock Springs, railroad routes, women’s suffrage, Indians, and livestock matters. Many petitions for pardons and appointment records are included.\n\nRecords also document an incident at Almy, where Chinese victims were robbed. Surviving documentation includes a report of the Chinese Consul at New York to the Chinese Minister, and a letter from a U.S. State Department official to the U.S. District Attorney for Wyoming regarding a complaint from the minister.Records from Governor Warren’s second term are somewhat more extensive. Correspondence deals with topics such as statehood, arid lands and irrigation, livestock, legislation, the territorial insane asylum, militia, game and fish, publicity for Wyoming, penitentiary, resignations, women’s suffrage, a fish hatchery, mining, Yellowstone Park, the education of deaf and blind students, and various requests and invitations.Appointment records and petitions for pardons make up a fairly significant portion of this collection. Indian and military affairs records deal with abandoned military reservation lands, relief for and complaints against Indians, rumored troubles, a bridge across the Wind River, Shoshone Reservation populations, and general reservations matters and conditions.Since Governor Warren only served about six weeks as Wyoming’s first state governor before moving on to the U.S. Senate, there are few records documenting this brief term. A small amount of correspondence deals with some of the topics mentioned above."
