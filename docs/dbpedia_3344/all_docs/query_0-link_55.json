        "text": "I was born in Greenville and aside from spending 1 year in Houston, Texas for my dad’s orthopedic fellowship, spent my formative years on the east side of Greenville. I went to Clemson University for undergrad and MUSC in Charleston for dental school. Due to my wife’s family’s extensive military history, I elected to serve in the Air Force and received a dental school scholarship. As an Air Force dentist, my family and I were stationed in Washington, D.C., Okinawa, Japan, and Montgomery, Alabama. After my military commitment, exactly 30 years after my dad’s orthopedic surgery fellowship in Houston, we moved to Houston Texas for a 26-month residency in orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes by Simon Sinek reads, “When you compete against everyone else, no one wants to help you. But when you compete against yourself, everyone wants to help you.” Let me tell you, God has blessed me in so many ways and I have had a TON of help! My father, Michael, passed on a relentless work ethic and my mother, Cheryl, has given me an extremely positive outlook on life. My brother, Bailey, and I mainly played baseball and soccer growing up, but knew early on that I would need to find a career other than becoming a professional athlete! My wife, Megan Cassity Tollison, has been my rock of stability, support, and encouragement since we started dating at Riverside High School. My children (Lewis, Georgiana, and Arabella) teach me life is simple, even if it does not always appear that way. All of these influences and more have developed me and are collectively reflected in who I am. I believe life isn’t a sprint or a marathon, it’s a relay. Coming back to Greenville is very exciting on so many levels for my family, but one of the things I am most excited about is investing in our community and the next generation.\n\nI look forward to earning your trust with your orthodontic needs!\n\n(Bonus, one of my favorite poems as an orthodontist about how your smile can mean so much!)\n\nThe Value of a Smile\n\n“A smile costs nothing, but creates much.\n\nA smile enriches those who receive without impoverishing those who give.\n\nA smile happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes lasts forever.\n\nNone are so rich they can get along without a smile, and none are so poor but are richer for their benefit.\n\nA smile creates happiness in the home, fosters goodwill in a business, and is the countersign of friends.\n\nA smile is a rest to the weary, daylight to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and nature’s best antidote for trouble.\n\nYet a smile cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen; for it is something that is no earthly good to anybody ‘til it is given away.\n\nFor nobody needs a smile so much as those who have none left to give.”\n\n– Frank Irving Fletcher\n\nTom Atkinson, DMD, MS\n\nDr. Tom Atkinson is a native of Greenville, SC and has practiced orthodontics here since 1990. He started practice in the same office with his father (the first pediatric dentist in South Carolina) and patients started call him Dr. Tom— they have ever since. He now treats many students of the very schools he attended years ago in Greenville: Beck Academy, J.L. Mann High School, and Furman University. His grown children Trey and Katie, are both graduates of Furman University and have diverse careers. Dr. Tom’s wife, Karen, works for Clemson University and also has two grown children. Dr. Tom’s greatest reward in practice is the positive impact he makes for his patients which lasts their entire lifetime.\n\nIn addition to creating beautiful smiles Dr. Tom is also a craftsman and musician. His passion since the early 2000’s has been woodworking— creating one-of-a-kind pieces of heirloom quality furniture, repairing antiques, or crafting something unique for his home. He also plays electric bass guitar, something he has done since childhood, playing in several bands and performing for many church functions. Dr. Tom has also been involved in his church, serving as a deacon along with other leadership roles in his church.\n\nAfter leaving Furman in 1983 he earned his doctorate in dentistry in 1987 from the Medical University of South Carolina, College of Dental Medicine (Charleston, SC) where he was awarded 4 prestigious honors:\n\nInternational College of Dentists: Outstanding Achievement\n\nSoutheastern Academy of Prosthodontics: Outstanding Achievement\n\nThe Quintessence Award for Academic Achievement\n\nAmerican Association of Endodontists: Certificate of Merit\n\nIn 1990, Dr. Atkinson earned his Masters of Science in Orthodontics from Washington University (St. Louis, MO). He maintains membership in the American Dental Association, American Association of Orthodontists, and Southern Association of Orthodontists. He continues his education constantly, studying with the world leaders in orthodontics, various MasterMind groups, the Dawson Study Group locally, and various other associations. Dr. Tom is constantly teaching within his profession and regularly writes articles to educate fellow dentists professionals about orthodontics."
