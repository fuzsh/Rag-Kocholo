He was re-elected to a second three-year term in 2019. During his tenure on the governing council, he served one year as the Chairman of the Law and Order Subcommittee and one year as the Treasurer. He has served as Chairman of the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee for the past three years.\n\nChairman Wheeler has an entrepreneurial spirit that started at the early age of five-years-old. At that time, he was selling vegetable soup and flower seeds to his community. This grew into running larger businesses later on; which, since 1990, included being a licensed retailer for the Nez Perce Tribe.\n\nChairman Wheeler’s experience in the private sector and as an individual exercising Nez Perce Tribal treaty-reserved rights has served as the foundation for the polices he has advocated for during his time on the executive committee. These polices include job creation, tribal economic development, natural resource management, and preservation of the culture, history and way of life of the Nimiipuu.\n\nDuring his tenure as an elected official, he has helped create a day worker program, develop the Nez Perce Tribal Water Code, purchase several retail enterprises, and work with federal and state agencies on resource and land management throughout the Nez Perce Tribe’s aboriginal territory.\n\nMichael (Mike) K.
