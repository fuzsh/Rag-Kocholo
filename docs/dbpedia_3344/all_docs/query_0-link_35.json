Participants will learn editing strategies, accuracy in word choice, and appropriate formatting.\n\nConducting a Successful Job Search\n\nParticipants will learn how to effectively search for and obtain post graduation and summer employment, internships, and externships. Participants will learn how to maximize and build on previous experiences in order to produce greater achievements.\n\nMaximizing the Interview\n\nParticipants will learn how to interview successfully for professional and academic settings. This workshop teaches participants how to leave a lasting positive impression that ultimately positions them to be hired. The workshop includes mock interviews that are videoed and analyzed by facilitator and peers to improve participant communication skills and overall presentation.\n\nFor more information, contact:\n\nStephen Smith\n\nsjsmith@mmc.edu\n\nMark your calendars for the 2017 Summer Institute on Health Policy, June 12 – 16, 2017 hosted by the Center for Health Policy at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThe Summer Institute on Health Policy is a rigorous summer training program for anyone with educational and research interests in health policy and social science, particularly economics, sociology and political science. The program provides two weeks of intensive, accelerated coursework on topics related to health policy, public health, health economics, law and public policy, and the social sciences. Courses are taught by an impressive lineup of nationally-renowned scholars, researchers, executives and public officials. Participants benefit from small classroom sizes and a diverse, interdisciplinary classroom learning environment. Instructors utilize hands-on teaching approaches that incorporate a combination of lectures, videos, group activities, interactive discussions and even field trips.\n\nThe 2017 Summer Institute on Health Policy is taught by Amani Nuru-Jeter, PhD, MPH, Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Community Health Sciences at The University of California-Berkeley. The course, “Introduction to Social Epidemiology,” will run from Monday, June 12 through Friday, June 16, 2017.\n\nThe Summer Institute is free to attend and open to the general public, including the entire Meharry Medical College community, students/faculty from other universities and working professionals. Participants may opt to receive two credit hours per course toward the completion of their academic degree program or toward the Certificate in Health Policy, which is offered through the Center for Health Policy. Each course spans one week, meeting daily from 8:30 am – 5 pm.\n\nHow much does it cost to attend the Summer Institute on Health Policy?\n\nThere is no cost to attend. We are proud to provide this opportunity free of charge to all participants.\n\nWhat time does class start and end?\n\nClass typically begins at 8:30 am and ends at approximately 5:00 pm. The instructor may choose to end class early on a particular day, but please plan to stay the entire day as this is not guaranteed.\n\nWill you provide meals?\n\nYes. Breakfast and lunch are provided each day of the Summer Institute. You are welcome to use your lunch hour however you choose. There are also other dining options on campus and nearby.\n\nI live in another city. Do you offer travel scholarships?\n\nNo.\n\nHow do I arrange for travel to the Summer Institute?\n\nYou are responsible for making your own travel arrangements. The Nashville International Airport (BNA) is a short cab ride from Meharry Medical College and is served by most national airlines. We can provide additional transportation options upon request.\n\nCan I attend just a few days of a course?\n\nYes. However, other participants rely on your participation in the group discussions and breakout sessions. We strongly encourage you to attend the full week as each day builds upon the previous day’s class. You are still required to register, even if you do not intend to attend the entire week.\n\nAre there any opportunities to network with other participants?\n\nYes. Participants are given two breaks each day and one lunch hour to use to get to know other participants. You will be given a program booklet upon arrival of the first class, which will include a directory of those attending the Summer Institute along with their email address. You may contact someone via email should you want to connect based on similar educational/career interests.\n\nWhere will classes be located?\n\nClasses will be held in the classroom on the first floor of the Clay Simpson Building, which is where the Center for Health Policy is housed. You may view the campus map to help you get to the building. The location is subject to change due to accommodate class size. Classes will be moved to the Learning Resources Center in the event we need to move the class location.\n\nAre there accommodations available for housing and lodging?\n\nMeharry Contact: Charlene E.

You will be provided a guest Wi-Fi password to access Meharry’s web service.\n\nPlease feel free to email us with additional questions at meharryhealthpolicy@mmc.edu.\n\nDr. Leavell is a Health Policy Associate and an Associate Professor of Dental Public Health at Meharry Medical College School of Dentistry. Her study entitled, Factors Influencing Barriers to Accessing Oral Healthcare by Immigrants in the Metropolitan Nashville Area, proposes to establish pertinent preliminary data needed for the implementation of appropriate oral health care services for immigrants. The United States has experienced significant growth in the immigrant population during the past 15 years. As a result, some key challenges specifically related to oral health care have been created. This project intends to evaluate factors influencing barriers to accessing oral health care by immigrants in the metropolitan Nashville, Tennessee area. The main goal of the project is to provide a foundation for understanding the association between barriers and the accessing of oral health care by immigrants. The intended project would further allow Meharry’s School of Dentistry to obtain an advantage in developing alliances with the community that can engender appropriate oral health care services for immigrants residing in the Nashville area. Due to the lack of appropriate formalized dental services in some immigrants’ birth countries, they sometimes present with some very unique dental problems that go untreated for a long time. The long-term goal is to increase the number of immigrant individuals accessing oral health care in Metropolitan Nashville. More specifically, the project will (1) determine the barriers encountered by immigrants while attempting to access oral health services and (2) delineate the factors related to those barriers."
