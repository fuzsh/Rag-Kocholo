Later that evening the lecturer serves as guest-of-honor at the annual UBNS graduation gala celebrating the residents’ academic achievements. The graduation is a black tie event, and is always one of the highlights of the year.\n\nThe Cohn family, Kaleida Health and The Kaleida Health Foundation sponsor the Dr. George A. Cohn Memorial Lectureship in cooperation with University at Buffalo Neurosurgery, State University of New York Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.\n\nThe lectureship was established in memory of Dr. Cohn after his passing in June 1991. Dr. Cohn was a member of the medical/dental staff at Buffalo General Hospital for 40 years, and former head of the BGH Department of Neurosurgery.\n\nA leader in the western New York medical community, Dr. Cohn served as president of the medical staff from 1977 to 1978, and as a member of the BGH Board of Trustees for three years. He also headed the medical staff fundraising effort for the hospital’s tower building. Dr. Cohn graduated from the University of Rochester Medical School and completed an internship in neurosurgery at Yale University.\n\nThe Dr. George A. Cohn Memorial Lectureship Endowment Fund of The Kaleida Health Foundation and other contributions made in Dr. Cohn’s memory support the lectureship. The Cohn family and Dr. Cohn’s colleagues and friends created the endowment fund in his honor."
