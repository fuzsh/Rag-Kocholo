My name is Pooja. I was born and raised in Ontario, Canada. I received my Honours Bachelor of Science from Ontario Tech University and my MD from St. Matthew’s University School of Medicine. My interest in family medicine started at a young age through observing my own family doctor and the impact he had on his patients and community. My passion for family medicine was solidified after completing an elective in family medicine during my fourth year. There I was exposed to the breadth of family practice and truly appreciated how seamlessly PCP’s integrated within their communities and became an extension of patient’s families. I chose UHS for its diversity, focus on resident wellness, camaraderie, and the rich opportunities for learning such as a range of subspecialty electives and research. I am confident that the UHS Family Medicine residency program will allow me to grow into the physician I aspire to be so that I may build trusting relations with my patients, provide exemplary care, and educate the community in preventative medicine.

Following high school, I moved to Sioux City, Iowa played soccer and completed a bachelor’s in science in biology and minor in psychology at Briar Cliff University. Then, I earned my medical degree at the American University of Antigua school of medicine. I am thrilled to continue my residency training at UHS Wilson Medical Center in Binghamton, a place that reminds me so much of my home country. Growing up I was enthusiastic about math; however, it wasn’t until my own experience with profound healthcare disparities, lack of adequate and access to healthcare that my curiosity in medicine sparked. During this time, I quickly learned that a lot of the diseases were preventable, and since then I had made it my goal to be part of the solution in ensuring adequate healthcare is available to all. I chose the family medicine program at UHS, specifically for their commitment to the community they serve, their priority to provide holistic healthcare to that is indeed equitable and accessible to all, while creating a supportive learning environment for their residents in training.\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy cooking different cultural dishes, spending time with family and friends, and exploring nature. I am looking forward to the next UHS soccer game.\n\nPGY-2\n\nJensine Agenmonmen, MD (she/her)\n\nMedical School: University of Limerick Graduate Entry Medical School\n\nHi! I’m Jensine, I was born in Washington DC; however, I spent my formative years in Lagos, Nigeria. I completed my undergraduate degree in Health Sciences at the University of Ottawa because I was interested in the interplay of factors that made the human body healthy. I soon came to know this ‘interplay of factors’ as the social determinants of health. My interest in understanding these factors began not too long after I left Nigeria. It became very apparent to me that a vast majority of diseases that Nigerians were suffering from, stemmed from unequal access to these determinants of health. This piqued my interest in pursuing medicine, and ultimately, specializing in Family Medicine, a specialty that aims to provide holistic care to patients. Following completion of my undergraduate degree, I moved to the beautiful country of Ireland, where I attended medical school at the University of Limerick School of Medicine.\n\nMy interests in medicine include women’s health, global health, and preventative care. Some of my hobbies include photography, reading, and spending time with family and friends. Very excited to spend the next few years getting the best training here at UHS!\n\nAaron Bridgemohan, MD (he/him)\n\nMedical School: Saba University School of Medicine\n\nHello, I’m Aaron and I'm from Ontario, Canada. I completed my undergrad at the University of Waterloo and went to Saba University School of Medicine. Going to medical school on Saba was a completely different from growing up in Canada but it was nice to experience my Caribbean heritage. During medical school I rotated at many different hospitals and I’ve seen more of the United States than I’ve seen of Canada. My first experience with family medicine was when I shadowed a family physician during undergrad. I was amazed at the long term and collaborative relationships she built with her patients. I knew that was something I wanted as well. The UHS FM program will provide me with the opportunity to learn and grow in a welcoming and friendly environment. Outside of medicine I love to watch hockey and I’m a huge fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs (so painful). I also collect model trains and love my Corgi Theodore!\n\nVejay Budhu, MD (he/him)\n\nMedical School: Ross University School of Medicine\n\nHi, my name is Vejay and I was born in Canada and grew up in Brampton, Ontario. At a very young age I was interested in being a doctor; in pursuit of this dream I attended the University of Toronto and earned my Honors Bachelor of Science Degree. My journey then led me to Ross University School of Medicine where I earned my Medical Degree. I am very excited to be here at UHS and am looking forward to the amazing opportunities that lie ahead. In my spare time you probably will find me either studying, playing sports, listening to music, or watching anime and tech videos. I also love spending time with my family, building new things, and learning more about technology.\n\nShane Gopaul, MD (he/him)\n\nMedical School: St George’s University School of Medicine\n\nHey! I was born in Guyana, studied in Canada and completed medical school at St. George’s University. I’ve had the privilege of learning in very diverse communities and am excited to continue that training here in Johnson City, NY. I’m looking forward to working in a program that shares my values in community outreach and health equity. I love sports, my fiancée Indu and puppers Thangu, and having a good laugh. Don’t be shy, I’d love to chat!\n\nJacqueline Lau, MD (she/her)\n\nMedical School: St. George’s University School of Medicine\n\nI was born and raised in Toronto, Canada, but travelled to different cities for my studies - Hamilton for my undergraduate, Ottawa for law school, Grenada for medical school, and now finally settling in Johnson City for residency. I developed an interest in medicine during my time in law school learning about health disparities and the importance of health care advocacy. UHS gave me the opportunity to pursue my interest in advocacy while exploring other areas, such as preventative care, women's health, and integrative medicine. Outside of medicine, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, and spoiling my corgi, Spiffy.\n\nNicolette McLain, DO (she/her)\n\nMedical School: Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nHi, my name is Nicolette McLain and I grew up here in Vestal, NY. I attended Vestal Central High School and continued my education at Broome Community College and then Binghamton University. I went on to work at our local hospitals as a medical office assistant, nursing assistant, mental health technician as well as an independent home health care aide. I knew my passion was in medicine so I continued my education at the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine. It was there that I fell in love with family medicine and rural medicine. My goal as a family physician is to provide a more personalized form of medicine and utilize osteopathic manipulative techniques to help my patients find balance in their bodies and provide relief from pain. My interests outside of medicine include cooking, baking, reading, yoga and spending time with my family. I am excited to be back home and giving back to the very community that made me who I am today!\n\nSeyedeh Mirrazavi, MD (she/her)\n\nMedical School: Medical University of the Americas\n\nI was born and raised in Tehran, Iran and moved to Vancouver, British Columbia at the age of 17. I attended the University of British Columbia for my undergraduate studies and Medical University of the Americas for medical school. Living in Canada and the Caribbean, I was constantly surrounded by diversity, and attribute this to my love for people and their unique stories.\n\nFamily Medicine and I found each other at the end of my third-year rotations. I love the ability to create meaningful relationships with patients and to work collaboratively to improve their quality of life. During my last year of medical school, I had the opportunity to complete an elective rotation at UHS Family Medicine program. During my time here every faculty and staff member I met was so kind and approachable. This experience gave me the sense that this program was not just a team but a family. I feel extremely fortunate to be part of such a positive and supportive program.\n\nMy interests in medicine include women’s health and preventive medicine. Outside of work I enjoy going on long walks, trying new places with good food and spending quality time with friends and family.\n\nMichael Powell, MD (he/him)\n\nMedical School: SUNY Upstate Medical University College of Medicine\n\nI’m a Binghamton Area native who lived through our two floods, still has a B Mets jersey, and regularly has to explain what a spiedie is, so it’s a real honor to be back to serve the community I love. I had considered a career as a physician since I was young because I love science, enjoy being with people, and wanted to follow the example of the great physicians in my life. But it was through my time volunteering at UHS and in Syracuse, my philosophy education at The University of Scranton and great mentors at Upstate Medical University that inspired me to pursue Family Medicine. My professional interests include broad spectrum outpatient care, addiction medicine and palliative care, and I’m very excited to not only care for patients but hopefully make our community a healthier place. When I’m not working you can find me juggling, practicing piano, trying to catch up on Marvel and Star Wars shows, and spending time with my family and friends.\n\nKatie Skolnick, MD (she/her)\n\nMedical School: SUNY Upstate Medical University College of Medicine\n\nI was born and raised in Fairport, NY, just outside of Rochester. I studied biology and chemistry during my undergraduate education at Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania with the goal of entering the health care field. I decided on becoming a physician in undergrad after shadowing an oncologist because I was inspired by the way the physician, patients and their families worked together through difficult experiences to help the patients reach their goals. After college, I moved back to upstate NY and attended medical school at SUNY Upstate in Syracuse. While in medical school, I enjoyed learning about the different facets of medicine through student leadership, service, and research opportunities. I spent my third year and part of my fourth year at the Upstate Clinical Campus in Binghamton which is when I fell in love with family medicine and this program. Some of my interests in medicine include obstetrics, gynecology, and pediatrics but I have yet to experience an aspect of family medicine that I do not enjoy. I also have an interest in medical education and hope to work with medical students and residents throughout my career. Outside of medicine I like to stay active by playing softball and snowboarding. I also enjoy reading, streaming new shows, and eating ice cream at one of the many local shops!\n\nPGY-3\n\nDeborah Alfa, MD (she/her)\n\nMedical School: Spartan Health Sciences University School of Medicine\n\nI was born and raised in Nigeria, West Africa. I left Nigeria at the age of 16 to Gambia, West Africa for my pre-medical sciences; I then attended Spartan Health Sciences in St. Lucia for my medical school. I also had the opportunity to complete all my clinical rotations in Chicago. Witnessing the devastating complications of preventable diseases in underserved communities fueled my desire for primary care. During my studies, I had the opportunity to serve with organizations like Sarah’s Circle, Care for friends whose mission is to provide people in the community with the basic human fundamentals; health care, food and housing. These experiences developed my interests within medicine, which include caring for the underserved community, providing health care access regardless of socioeconomic status, women’s health and global health. My interest outside of medicine involves anything that has to do with food; cooking, trying out new restaurants and new food with friends. I also enjoy traveling, the outdoors, watching way too much TV, and music. I am excited to be starting my family medicine residency at United Health Services hospitals! I know I will be well-equipped to provide care to a diverse patient population.\n\nNahosi Bowa, MD (she/her)\n\nMedical School: St. George’s University School of Medicine\n\nI was born and raised in Zambia and have been interested in medicine for as long as I can remember. When the opportunity to study medicine in the Caribbean presented itself, I jumped at it. Enjoying crystal blue water on white sandy beaches after class was a unique and special part of the experience. After completing the first two years of medical school in the Caribbean, I moved to Chicago to do my third- and fourth-year clinical rotations, which were both exciting and challenging. I developed a lot as a person, met people from various walks of life, and even picked up a bit of Spanish. I got to experience the highs and lows of modern medicine through my encounters with patients in a way that I’ll never forget. After graduating from medical school, I did a Master's degree in Clinical and Health Research at Southampton University in the UK. It has taught me so much about the biomedical research that forms the foundation of current medical practice. It has also allowed me to discover my own research interests which include: telemedicine, the effects of vaping and decline in empathy during medical training. At present, I’m excited to be starting off my medical career in Family Medicine at UHS and look forward to everything that will come with it. Outside of medicine, I love exploring my creative side and really enjoy singing and hand-made embroidery. Baking is another activity I really enjoy and would like to get better at, but I don’t get enough opportunities to practice and so kitchen mishaps do happen from time to time. In the future, I hope to be able to travel more and learn to play the Ukulele.\n\nChristian Edwards, MD* (he/him)\n\nMedical School: American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine\n\nI am originally from the Metro Detroit area and went to medical school at American University of the Caribbean. During medical school I tutored molecular cell biology, immunology and anatomy. My interests include sports medicine and research. During residency I enjoy doing bedside procedures, inpatient resident rotations and clinic work. My hobbies include mountain biking, hiking, gardening and spending time with my wife and our pets; we have dogs, cats and rabbits!\n\nOlivia Hu, MD* (she/they)\n\nMedical School: Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook\n\nYouthful me was keen on the lovely (really, honest!) beaches of Long Island and math. I loved to create things by baking, paper folding, and painting. Still, I knew I wanted to understand the interactions between people and diseases on many levels so I went for a combined BS-MD program at Stony Brook University, with a short break teaching abroad. I was involved in research into vertical transmission of the microbiome, a number of interest groups, and our free clinic where I found meaning in making real contact with our patients as humans. Now, I have come upstate for a residency to see even more breadth of patients and problems in family medicine. For now, my clinical interests include women's health, integrative medicine, and in-office procedures but I can't wait to get sucked in by more. In my spare time, I like to explore the area's bountiful farmers' markets and U-picks, make interesting new recipes, and learn all the secret spots of the area!\n\nRamandeep Mangat, MD (he/him)\n\nMedical School: St. George’s University School of Medicine\n\nI was born in Ludhiana, Punjab, India but moved to Toronto, Canada at a very young age where I grew up for most of my life. I completed my undergraduate at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario in BSc with Honors. I always had an interest in medicine growing up and decided to pursue my medical degree at St. George’s University where I did a global scholar’s program. I did my first year of basic medical sciences in Newcastle, England, my second year in Grenada, West Indies, and my third and fourth clinical years in the United States. I chose UHS for residency because of the diversity in its faculty and local community, the tremendous learning environment along with the unique opportunity to learn and gain experience in Osteopathic medicine, and the outdoor and recreational activities in the area including local community events. I enjoy watching sports, playing soccer, exercising and going to the gym, traveling and exploring new cultures, and trying new food! I want to practice the full scope of family medicine in the future and serve my local community with an overall goal to improve quality of care and access to primary care and preventive medicine.\n\nRuchi Parikh, MD (she/her)\n\nMedical School: Saba University School of Medicine\n\nI always knew I wanted to be a doctor. Fascinated by the human body, I studied human physiology at the University of Western Ontario and then went to medical school at Saba University School of Medicine. Born and raised in Toronto, Canada, I grew up surrounded by people and different cultures. Saba was very different from Toronto and I loved the chance to explore the island and become a part of the community. My time on Saba also opened my eyes to barriers of care and after medical school, I had the opportunity to work on research and care teams that addressed these issues. My time with the Memory and Mobility Clinics in Kitchener, ON taught me so much about the importance of the holistic approach to care, ensuring that patients’ physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing are all taken care of, and how teamwork is crucial to providing the best care possible. The UHS Wilson FM program embodies this philosophy and is one of the reasons we are a great fit. My interests outside of medicine include hiking, reading, cooking, crafts, and travel.\n\nMegan Rigotti, DO (she/her)\n\nMedical School: Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nI grew up right here in Vestal, NY. I loved growing up in the area with its amazing fall foliage and carousels. I went to Vestal High School and during my time there I began volunteering at Wilson Hospital during the summer. I continued my education at the University of Scranton where I studied biology and philosophy. After college, I worked as a scribe in the Emergency Departments at Wilson Hospital and Binghamton General Hospital. I loved meeting and talking to patients from all backgrounds and cultures. I continued to pursue my love of medicine and began medical school at Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. I was able to work in my school's student run clinic, join various clubs and expand my knowledge there. I am very excited and proud to come back and practice medicine in my hometown that I love. My interests in medicine include women’s health and addiction medicine. My interests outside of medicine include reading, spending time with friends and family, and exploring all this area has to offer (my favorite being summer concerts in the park and the church festivals with great food)!\n\nSabba Sarwar, MD (she/her)\n\nMedical School: Windsor University School of Medicine\n\nI was born in Pakistan, grew up in Brooklyn, and moved to Staten Island 5 years ago. For undergraduate, I attended Hunter College in New York and Windsor University for medical school. I was interested in taking care of patients from all walks of life and patient advocacy, which led me to pursue Family Medicine. I was an active member of NYSAFP as a medical student and now as a resident. I previously served on leadership commission, chair for student election committee and currently as part of the operations commissions and DEI at NYSAFP. My interests in medicine include patient advocacy, caring for marginalized communities, women's health and inpatient medicine. I chose this program because of the supportive faculty who is heavily involved in leadership and advocacy. During the interviews, I felt appreciated and knew I found my support group who will help me become a competent physician. Outside of medicine, I love spending time with my family, gardening, cooking, traveling, hiking, shopping, fashion and EATING!\n\nPeter Yang, MD (he/him)\n\nMedical School: Cebu Institute of Medicine\n\nI grew up in the county of Queens, NY, one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in the country, with my parents and younger brother. After graduating high school, I was accepted into SUNY Binghamton where I studied Cell and Molecular Biology and graduated with a Bachelor’s of Science. During my 4 years of undergraduate study, I became especially interested in the relationship between food and health and worked as a Nutritional Sciences TA. Wanting to pursue a career that could combine my interest in the sciences as well as impact the health of the community around me, I decided upon medicine. I was accepted into the Cebu Institute of Medicine in the Philippines in 2015 where I had the opportunity to work with underserved communities, practice leading community workshops on preventative medicine, and eat some of the most delicious food known to mankind. After graduating in 2019, I came back to the States during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and worked closely with physicians who supported their communities through those hard times. My professional interests include preventative medicine and reproductive health. In my off time, you can find me swimming, biking, and exploring the outdoors.\n\n* Indicates Co-Chief Residents"
