This is not an associateship, not a partnership, not a buy-in, but simply the opportunity to be the total owner and manager of one’s own practice.\n\nThe practice is located in the greater New Orleans area in a sought after setting.\n\nThe financial rewards of ownership are substantial. This particular practice projects a net income to the owner for the treatment produced of $443,000. In addition, profit of the practice also accrues to the owner in the amount of $248,000 – profits which the employers of associates keep - for a total first year revenue to the purchaser of $690,000.\n\nSubtracting debt service of $133,000 for the acquisition cost yields a first year net income after all expenses and debt service of $558,000. This is based on an owner’s production of $1,270,000. An owner need only produce $6,700 per day for four days per week for 47 weeks per year to attain these results.\n\nThe practice price of $970,000 can be entirely financed over a ten year period, and the entire price is tax deductible and/or depreciable. That essentially means that the tax savings of a purchase will be approximately 30% of the practice price, a tax savings that non-buyers do not receive.\n\nHere’s what one practice purchaser from northeast Florida wrote of his experience.\n\nAfter graduating from my residency, I wound up with a little over $600,000 in debt. I moved to Florida in 2016 after a six month implantology fellowship. I worked as an associate for about a year and a half, and while I was making progress on my loans, it still felt like there was no end in sight.\n\nIt was always my goal to buy a practice and I purchased my practice on July 3, 2017. Remember I said I had $600,000 in debt? Well, by July 30, 2018 I had officially paid it off completely, including my wife’s debt! And there’s no way I could’ve done this if I had continued as an associate. I get to control everything about my practice. I control who we hire, which means I get to control the culture of the office. I control the products we use, which allows me to control the quality of what we do. I control the overhead expenses of the office, which allows me to save money where I need to save money or spend money where I feel like we should spend money.\n\nIf you would like to open a dialogue about how practice ownership and the retention of profit can greatly help in recovering your investment in who and what you are, I would welcome your call.\n\nEarl Douglas, DDS, MBA, BVAL\n\n404-512-4702\n\ninfo@adssouth.com\n\nassociate dentist\n\ncompensation: negotiable\n\nemployment type: full-time\n\nHamilton Family Dental is providing an excellent opportunity for a dentist to practice dentistry in a modern progressive environment.
