        "text": "üåü Exciting news! üåü We're proud to announce two new research fellowships, in collaboration with Versus Arthritis, aimed at improving the lives of young people with musculoskeletal pain. ü¶µ Musculoskeletal pain is acute or chronic pain felt in the muscles, ligaments, tendons or bones. It‚Äôs often poorly understood, poorly managed, and if left unchecked, it can have lasting consequences for young people, including disability or emotional distress. üî¨ Despite more than a third of the UK population living with chronic pain, there is a severe lack of research funding into musculoskeletal pain in young people. Our new Catalyst Fellows are Dr Verena Hinze from University of Oxford and Dr Rhiannon Joslin from University of Southampton. Through their new research, they will increase understanding of the mechanisms underpinning musculoskeletal pain in young people, to improve diagnosis, treatment, and recovery üè• üëâ Read more: https://bit.ly/3ubKtWd #Fellowship #Research #MedicalResearch #Pain #ChronicPain #MusculoskeletalPain\n\nCongratulations to University of Michigan researchers Lynda Lisabeth and Lewis Morgenstern on receiving the Javits Neuroscience Investigator Award from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) for their work on stroke health disparities in Mexican Americans. The $5 million grant will fund the Michigan Public Health/University of Michigan Medical School research team's BASIC Study (Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi) to reach a 32-year milestone and expand the study group to 35-to-44-year-olds whose incidence of stroke is increasing. Enrolling over 15,000 participants over the last 25 years, the BASIC Study has provided insights into health inequities by examining outcomes, recurrence, deaths and other factors amongst stroke patients in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white populations in Corpus Christi, Texas. In this next 5-year research cycle, they will investigate outcome variance within the Mexican American population to understand contributing factors to why some people recover after a stroke and others do not. https://myumi.ch/Pkmx5\n\nIn our Grantee Spotlight Interviews, AFAR‚Äôs recent grantees share their vision for their AFAR-supported research, in their own words. This month, we are pleased to share Grantee Spotlight Interviews with the 2023 Glenn Foundation for Medical Research and AFAR Grants for Junior Faculty recipients: The next recipient is Andrea Stavoe, PhD: On her 2023 Glenn Foundation for Medical Research and AFAR Grants for Junior Faculty Award Dr. Stavoe, of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth Houston) explains: ‚ÄúMy maternal grandparents survived into their nineties; it was truly inspiring to see how they maintained a great quality of life for as long as they did. I want to be able to help people conserve their cognitive abilities for as long as possible to keep communities and families strong and vibrant‚Ä¶Ultimately, we predict this research will yield new potential therapeutic targets to delay the onset of age-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration by understanding how we can boost neurons‚Äô inherent mechanisms that maintain cellular health and function.‚Äù Read more about what inspires Dr. Stavoe‚Äôs AFAR-supported research in her Grantee Spotlight interview here: https://ow.ly/Ihf450RYuq5\n\nBaylor College of Medicine's Misophonia Study Causes Confusion Among Sufferers On their website, \"Baylor College of Medicine is a health sciences university that creates knowledge and applies science and discoveries to further education, healthcare and community service locally and globally.\"(1) The college has put out advertisements for a study that targets misophonia sufferers. The study involves a 2-hour virtual clinic interview and online questionnaires; and a 2-hour in-person visit which includes a test that measures facial muscle activity while listening to sudden beeps and experiencing an occasional shock on your wrist. The in-person visit takes place in Houston, Tx. Volunteers will receive up to $150 in compensation for participating. What's concerning to me is the \"shock\" portion of this study. While this study is on the wrist, I wonder what the purpose is, and what Baylor will study next? Is the next step going to be electroshock or possibly transcranial [Read More] https://lnkd.in/gKCfrUHh\n\nWe live in a post-truth era. I have felt it for years now. Boy is girl. Fact is misinformation. Conspiracy theory is truth. Mostly peaceful is chaos and anarchy. It matters not what is actual truth. What matters is what people are willing to accept as truth. The dummification of a society such that far too many are willing to accept what they are told without questioning it, without applying critical thinking, without considering conflicting evidence right before their eyes, is a triumph of cultural Marxism, a movement promoted by those who seek to destroy western values of freedom, liberty, self-determination, and meritocracy, among other things. Even the phrase ‚Äúcultural Marxism‚Äù has become a subject of debate. To The Heritage Foundation, a conservative organization, it is a cancer festering in America. To mainstream media, including Wikipedia, it‚Äôs a conspiracy theory. And why not? If truth is what the mainstream media and Wikipedia tell you, then you are a sheep that needs no shepherd. Hats off to Martin Kulldorff for standing by truth, and by that I mean the real truth, not the truth concocted by our enemies or their useful idiots.\n\nThe Great Barrington Declaration was ‚Äúa dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence.‚Äù So far, over 4,000 other scientists have signed it. While the idea of returning to normal life is seductive, the data showed that ‚Äúthere is absolutely no evidence that the population will get herd immunity.‚Äù Since immunity from infection with COVID-19 gradually wanes, the virus can reinfect people, which makes stopping its spread impossible. The John Snow memorandum and colleagues having signed it expected immunity to last only a year or two, just as it does for other coronaviruses, which return seasonally and were proven right. Would have listened to Kulldorff, millions more would have from COVID‚Ä¶ Maybe that, enough, justifies he would be asked to be put on leave from Harvard‚Ä¶ Should all be reminded that the publication of the Great Barrington Declaration was irresponsible. Lynn R. Goldman, the dean of public health at George Washington University, stated that the publication of the Great Barrington Declaration was irresponsible. ‚ÄúIt takes hubris to write anything like the Great Barrington Declaration,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúbecause it is such a departure from anything that the science is supporting.‚Äù On top of such, he disagreed with the CDC's pause of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine rollout and argued publicly that the vaccine's benefits outweighed clotting risks, particularly for older people, wrongly. In December 2021 Kulldorff published an error-laden essay for the Brownstone Institute in which he falsely claimed that influenza was more hazardous to children than COVID-19, and on that basis illogically argued against children receiving COVID-19 vaccination. In reality, influenza had been responsible for one child death in the 2020/21 season, while public health mitigation of COVID-19 was in place ‚Äì COVID-19 had, in contrast, killed more than 1,000. On 13 February 2022, Kulldorff tweeted in support of the Canada convoy protest, which was organized to protest against vaccine mandates and other government restrictions regarding COVID-19. We need to call out those hubris, and their minions. While Marina Luccarini may think Kulldorff is on the right side of things, he was proven on the wrong side of both science and history. https://lnkd.in/ejTWGjFa\n\nIntroducing: From Cell-being to Well-being, an enthusiastic and multidisciplinary student team from Maastricht University Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life sciences, dedicated to making a difference in the lives of those affected by Marfan syndrome and other associated syndromes. - Who are we?
