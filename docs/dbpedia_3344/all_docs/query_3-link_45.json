        "text": "2020\n\nThe 2020 AAPD PAC Legislator of the Year Award was awarded to Congressman Henry Cuellar (D-Texas-28th). Congressman Cuellar is Chief Deputy Whip for the 116th Congress and a member of the House Committee on Appropriations. The Congressman was not able to attend the Advocacy Conference, but AAPD Past President Joseph Castellano and CEO John Rutkauskas presented the award to him in his office.\n\n2019\n\nThe 2019 AAPD PAC Legislator of the Year Award was awarded to Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.-3rd). Congresswoman DeLauro is the Chairwoman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee—the subcommittee that among other things funds the Title VII pediatric dentistry program. The Congresswoman was not able to attend in person but her remarks were presented by her legislative assistant, Caitlin Peruccio (pictured here, holding the award, with AAPD CEO John Rutkauskas on her right and AAPD President Joe Castellano on her left).\n\n2017\n\nThe 2017 AAPD PAC Legislator of the Year Award was awarded to Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). Senator Blunt is chair of the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over Title VII funding along with all other programs funded by the Department of Health and Human Services. The Senator was not able to attend in person but sent a personalized video greeting that was introduced by his Legislative Assistant for health issues, Desiree Mowry (pictured here, holding the award, with Congressional Liaison Heber Simmons, Jr.).\n\n2015\n\nThe AAPD PAC presented the 2015 Legislator of the Year Award to Congressman Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.-4th), one of three dentists in Congress.

Brill, Congressman Elijah Cummings(D-7th Md.), and President Dr. Beverly A. Largent.

The presentation took place during the AAPD Appreciation Dinner at the Canadian Embassy. After the 2007 death of Deamonte Driver from a dental infection, Pallone’s subcommittee held a hearing on children’s access to oral health care, and his leadership ultimately led to a guaranteed dental benefit and other important provisions in the State Children’s Health Insurance Program reauthorization legislation approved by Congress.\n\n2006\n\nU.S. Congressman Charles W. Norwood (R-Ga.) was presented with the third annual Legislator of the Year Award from the AAPD Political Action Committee. Pictured (l-r): Norwood, AAPD PAC Steering Committee Chairman Charles R.
