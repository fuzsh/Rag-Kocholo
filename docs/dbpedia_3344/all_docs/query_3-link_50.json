        "text": "Washington, Jul 19, 2007 - Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson has secured funding for several Idaho projects in the House Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill. H.R. 3043 passed the U.S. House of Representatives with a vote of 276-140.\n\n“It may sound cliché but ‘Education is Our Future’ and we must put the funding and support behind it,” said Simpson. “This bill includes funding for all levels of education and includes funding for children with disabilities.”\n\nNational Programs in bill include:\n\nHigher Education Access Deficit: Pell Grants. Between 2001 and 2006, the cost of attending a four-year public college increased by $3,764 or 42 percent; however, the maximum Pell Grant increased by just $300. This bill increases the maximum Pell award by $390 to $4,700. K-12 Educational Opportunity Deficit: No Child Left Behind: $25.7 Billion Disabilities Educational Deficit: IDEA Part B grants: $559.464 Million. Health and Human Services/Rural Health: This bill provides $307 million for rural health programs, area health education centers, and the National Health Service Corps. These programs support more than 1,200 small, at-risk rural hospitals, create health care networks for more than 775,000 rural residents in underserved communities, and provide access to emergency defibrillation devices, and support rural health research centers and State rural health offices.\n\nIdaho Programs in the House Bill include:\n\nThe Literacy Matters! Program is aimed at educating new mothers on the importance of early childhood literacy and math skills and providing them with resources for educating their children. ($300,000) The Idaho Caring Foundation Dental Project will provide dental care for 600 low-income, uninsured children throughout Idaho. Eligible children will be identified by working in partnership with Idaho schools, health departments, Head Start programs, and YMCA programs. Dental services are provided by over 90 dentists who are Caring Foundation providers, providing oral health services for reduced fees. ($300,000)\n\nBoise/Treasure Valley Programs in the House Bill include:\n\nThe Community Detox Center; United Way of Treasure Valley is a proposed facility for 24-hour medically monitored alcohol and drug sobering station and 36-bed detox center for indigent patients treated by professionals. Typical stays for sobering will be 12 hours and typical stays for detoxification will be 5-6 days; following sobering and/or detoxification, patients will be referred to appropriate education and treatment programs. ($400,000) The Children’s Health Services Expansion; St. Luke’s Regional Medical Center. This expansion project provides essential growth in capacity for Pediatric Medical/Surgical, Pediatric Intensive Care, Neonatal Intensive Care, Pediatric Oncology, and Pediatric Surgical Suites and support areas, to meet the needs of the rapidly growing population in the hospital’s service area. ($200,000) SySTEMic Solution: Plant Early for STEM Learning (science, technology, engineering, & math). This program is a nationally relevant, hands-on, project-based STEM learning system (science, technology, engineering, & math) designed to spur achievement and confidence among elementary-age learners and their teachers. ($200,000) The Discovery Center of Idaho Expansion. This funding will assist efforts initiated by the Discovery Center and the J.R. Simplot Foundation to build a new model of a “hands-on” science center to captivate the attention of and inspire tomorrow’s leaders and innovators. The 70,000 square foot Center will be founded on three core strengths, inspiring stories of innovation including Mr. Simplot’s story, iconic collection of working steam tractors and DCI’s expertise in igniting curiosity, through interactive science exhibits and programs. ($250,000)\n\n“The Treasure Valley is growing rapidly and in order to meet the needs of our communities we need to help fund the Detox Center, education programs and areas that improve children’s healthcare,” said Simpson. “I’m glad I could be part of directing federal funds to projects that will greatly serve Idahoans.”\n\nSoutheast Idaho/ Upper Valley Programs in the House Bill include:\n\nMadison County Memorial Hospital Revitalization Project. The Hospital services for the growing area, that encompasses five counties, and has simply outgrown its facilities. This project will increase capacity for obstetrics (Madison County Memorial Hospital has more births than any other hospital of its size in the State of Idaho and possibly the nation) and inpatient and outpatient surgeries is needed. Federal funding will be used for necessary medical equipment for the expanded and remodeled facility. ($200,000) Teton Valley Hospital Revitalization Project. The Teton Valley Hospital & Surgicenter is a 13-bed Critical Access Hospital that provides an emergency room and a full scope of primary care services to the residents in and around Teton Valley. Its population has grown by more than 99% over the past 15 years, ranking it in the top two fastest growing counties in Idaho for the last six years. This population growth has seriously strained the resources of the hospital and necessitated the revitalization project. ($200,000 is earmarked for this project in the House Bill). Advanced Clinical Simulation Laboratory will develop an Advanced Clinical Simulation Laboratory (ACSL) to strengthen nursing education, practice and research in Idaho. The ACLS will enable students, faculty, and practice partners to become actively involved in clinical simulation learning and conducting research related to student learning, effectiveness of clinical education models and improving patient care outcomes. The ACSL will also provide a research and practice laboratory for nurse faculty and clinical educators to learn and update knowledge about clinical educational models and teaching with technology. ($200,000)\n\nMagic Valley Programs in the House Bill include:\n\nCollege of Southern Idaho Pro-Tech Program will develop a curriculum to implement new post-secondary educational-technical training degrees and programs at the CSI. ($200,000) Historic Wilson Theater Restoration Project. The Wilson Theater was built in 1920 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is also part of Rupert’s Historic Business District. The community has raised over $1 million to restore the building, this funding will aid in their efforts. ($150,000)"
