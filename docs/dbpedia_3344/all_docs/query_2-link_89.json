        "text": "Dr. Khyobeni Mozhui is an associate professor at the College of Medicine in Memphis, within the Department of Preventive Medicine at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. She earned her PhD in neurogenetics, focusing on neuropsychiatric conditions related to stress response, depression, and addiction.\n\nDr. Mozhui’s primary research centers on the genetics and epigenetics of aging and age-related diseases. Her work delves into how the epigenome changes over time and its implications for health status.\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Mozhui is keenly interested in how the epigenome can serve as markers of health disparities and the ways in which social environment and dietary factors interact with the genome, influencing the “epigenetic clock.” Through her groundbreaking research, she aims to unravel the complex interactions between our genetic makeup and external factors, contributing valuable insights into preventive medicine and public health.\n\nMedicalTechnologySchools.com: How has graduating with a degree in biological sciences enhanced your career?\n\nDr. Mozhui: Navigating my career path felt like a natural progression for me, as it was a direct trajectory from my bachelor’s degree to my master’s, PhD, post-doc, and finally landing a tenure track position. This has been my only career path, so my perspective comes from a place of continuous academic advancement.\n\nHowever, I’ve observed a significant shift in the landscape over the past decade, where the skills and knowledge I’ve accumulated solidified my academic career and enhanced my marketability in the industry. Traditionally, graduates with a PhD in biological sciences might have seen academia as their most natural progression. Still, there’s been a noticeable increase in industries drawing in graduates, including those with advanced degrees.\n\nThis shift reflects a broader trend of industries, particularly in biotech, actively engaging in academic-type research, thereby blurring the lines between academia and industry. Companies like Calico Sciences, Altos Labs, and Genentech have cultivated environments that resemble academic settings, focusing on research and publications that are academically inclined. This evolution has expanded career options for new graduates, offering pathways in academia and industry and clinical settings for those with degrees in applied sciences, like psychological sciences. The distinction between academia and industry has become increasingly nuanced, providing more opportunities for those holding PhDs or master’s degrees in the biological sciences.\n\nMedicalTechnologySchools.com: What is one piece of advice you would give to a prospective biological sciences student?\n\nDr. Mozhui: Being open to learning new skills, even those not directly linked to your degree or only tangentially related, is crucial in today’s rapidly evolving job market. The willingness to self-educate and acquire new competencies can significantly enhance your career prospects. For instance, if you’re studying botany and encounter a dataset that requires analysis, don’t hesitate to teach yourself quantitative and data analysis skills. These abilities not only make you more competent but also increase your marketability. While professional certifications can be beneficial, they often pale compared to the value of hands-on, practical skills. My career trajectory is an example—I hold a PhD in neuroscience but landed a tenure track position in genetic epidemiology. This unexpected shift was largely due to my initiative to learn quantitative genetics during my postdoc and to teach myself computer programming. Such self-directed learning opens up new career paths and opportunities, underscoring the importance of practical knowledge over formal certification. Demonstrating the ability to effectively apply what you’ve learned is often more valuable than the certifications themselves."
