Residents rotate here at the R4 level for a high volume, bread and butter general surgery experience in an apprenticeship model. Explore Valley Medical Center\n\nRotations\n\nThe University of Washington program provides a rigorous and comprehensive experience with graduated responsibilities designed to produce the highest caliber surgeon. It is intellectually challenging with high expectations and standards for all trainees. Our comprehensive curriculum encompasses both didactics provided through a wealth of teaching conferences and focused technical instruction provided through open, laparoscopic and robotic technical laboratories. We developed the innovative EVATS rotation for our surgical residents and published this in 2003. The EVATS rotation provides time for Emergency coverage, Vacation time, Academic time, and Technical Skills training.\n\nFirst Year\n\nDay one of the R1 year starts your journey from junior surgeon to independent surgeon. Focus areas include initial patient evaluation in the clinic, ICU and emergency room and operative and perioperative care across a wide variety of disciplines. Rotations include acute care surgery, trauma, surgical oncology, burns, colorectal, vascular, thoracic, and pediatric surgery. These services are rounded out with experiences in emergency room trauma, critical care, burn surgery, and plastic surgery. On all services, the R1 assists in operations on his/her patients and performs appropriate operative procedures. Our R1’s perform approximately 150 cases and procedures.\n\nSecond Year\n\nThe R2 concentrates on the fundamentals of critical care, with primary responsibility in the University of Washington CTICU and the Harborview Trauma ICU. Rotations on other services, such as transplant surgery, surgical oncology, acute care surgery, and vascular surgery and the general surgery service at Northwest Hospital broaden this experience. The R2 performs operative procedures that build on the skills learned in the first year. By the end of the R2 year our residents have performed over 350 cases, far exceeding the 250 minimum requirement.\n\nThird Year\n\nThe R3 year commences the senior resident years. Residents spend the year solidifying general surgery experiences at the VA and UW Medical Center, where advanced laparoscopy and bariatric surgery is the focus. At Harborview, the R3 functions as the primary trauma surgery consultant and leads the trauma ward service in conjunction with a Chief resident. A rotation as a senior fellow in medical gastroenterology augments the R3’s knowledge and expertise in upper and lower GI endoscopy. The R3 also serves as the chief resident on the burn surgery, pediatric surgery and Northwest Hospital community general surgery rotations. These chief-level rotations introduce the R3 to administrative and team leadership roles.\n\nFourth Year\n\nWith the operative experience, leadership skills and surgical maturity gained during the R3 year, the R4 focuses on a more complex surgical experience. Rotations include hepatobiliary surgery, surgical oncology, endocrine, colorectal surgery and advanced laparoscopic surgery at UW and vascular surgery at the VA. On the Harborview trauma services the R4’s serve in the Chief role. A highpoint of the year is the Valley Hospital rotation where the R4 works 1:1 in an apprenticeship type role with attendings in this busy community hospital.\n\nChief Year\n\nThe Chief resident year is the year where you assemble all the elements of your training and demonstrate to the faculty that you’re ready to become an independent surgeon. With the graduated responsibility and appropriate supervision provided from your first day in the program as a junior surgeon, our Chief residents exercise major responsibility in patient care, leadership, teaching, and administrative areas. Chief residents perform the most complex operative procedures and assume responsibility for the operative and supportive care of all surgical patients at each of our major teaching hospitals. As leaders in the program, they also participate extensively in the education of medical students and residents, clinical investigations, and in departmental and service administrative matters. Rotations include trauma, general surgery, acute care surgery, colorectal and surgical oncology. Flexible training options are available in the Chief year.\n\nConferences\n\nThe UW Department of Surgery focuses on the development of the total surgeon in the three areas of intellect, skills and humanity. In addition to the usual bedside, clinic, and operating room teaching activities, more formal teaching conferences occur on two levels: department-wide and hospital-based.\n\nDepartment-Wide\n\nGrand Rounds\n\nDepartment of Surgery Grand Rounds is held once per month at the University hospital. Speakers include national and international leaders in surgery as well as some of our own UW faculty. Residents have the opportunity to engage all visiting professors in roundtable discussions specifically designed for resident education.\n\nHospital-Based\n\nEach of our teaching hospitals has a weekly QI Conference (aka ‘M&M’). We strongly believe that review of surgical outcomes and problem-based learning and improvement should be an ongoing pursuit that is woven into the fabric of a surgeon’s daily practice. For this reason, we incorporate review of NSQIP and Washington State SCOAP data into our weekly QI conferences. We also have a large selection of conferences at each hospital based on the clinical emphasis of its services. Some examples are listed below:\n\nUW Medical Center-Montlake\n\nQA/QI Conference (aka ‘M&M’)\n\nTeam Building and Mentorship Conference – Wednesday. The Program Director meets with each class monthly on a rotating basis (each week a different class). Variety of topics discussed. (Lunch provided)\n\nHow-I- Do-It (HIDI) Conference – Thursday AM.

(Lunch provided)\n\nProgram-Led\n\nSurgical Science Series\n\nWednesday morning is a time to enjoy the company of fellow residents and faculty from around the system, to catch up on the latest advances and help foster the camaraderie, fellowship and community that make residency a positive experience. Our weekly didactic conference occurs in a 4 hour, bi-monthly block of time on Wednesday mornings known as the Surgical Science Series. The junior resident sessions occur twice a month and focus on building a foundation in basic general surgical principles. The senior resident sessions occur twice a month on alternate Wednesdays and focus on classical reviews of the surgical literature and evidence-based approaches to specific topics. Some highlights:\n\nCurriculum: American Board of Surgery’s SCORE curriculum\n\nHeld at a central location. (Breakfast provided)\n\nZoom option is available (and recorded for later viewing)\n\nThe flipped classroom format is used. The topic is assigned in advance with an interactive, discussion-based format headed by a faculty member expert in that area.\n\nEach 4-hour session is divided\n\n2-hour didactic portion (roundtable discussion and mock-oral board questions)\n\n2-hour second session for technical skills/simulation or our expanded curriculum in leadership, quality, coding & billing, academic mentoring, palliative care, residents as teachers, professionalism, global surgery, surgical ethics, and practice management-related topics.\n\nJournal Club\n\nOur residents moved our monthly Journal Club from a restaurant to a faculty home in order to further develop our community. (Dinner provided)\n\nABSITE Prep\n\nOur Director of ABSITE and Board Review hosts a monthly ABSITE Prep Conference in the fall months preceding the ABSITE.\n\nSimulation Training\n\nThe WWAMI Institute for Simulation in Healthcare (WISH) is University of Washington’s state-of-the-art simulation center for health education. Our center was one of the first Level 1 ACS accredited simulation labs in the United States. WISH was spearheaded by leaders in the Department of Surgery in 2007, and under the influence of our multidisciplinary faculty has expanded to include a 2000 sq. ft. facility at UW Medical Center and an 8000 sq. ft. facility at Harborview Medical Center. WISH is a unique resource for our residents that embodies the Department of Surgery’s commitment to innovation in medical education.\n\nOur residents have 24/7 access to surgical equipment, suture material, laparoscopic trainers, and virtual reality modules. This ease-of-access has led our surgical residents to heavily utilize the simulation facilities for independent practice. Every year of training, surgical residents have protected time during their EVATS rotation to advance their technical skills as part of a structured curriculum at each training level that includes modules in robotic and laparoscopic surgery, ultrasound imaging, endoscopy, central line and chest tube placement, surgical airway procedures and advanced trauma life support. These modules eventually lead to certification in Robotics, Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS), and Fundamentals of Endoscopy Surgery (FES). Very popular with our residents, is our annual Laparoscopic Rodeo and Robotic Olympics competitions, with prizes for the top performers.\n\nMentorship\n\nOur Mentorship Program is designed to nurture and train each resident to achieve their full potential and personal career goals and place graduates into their top choices of fellowship and research programs or community practice. Interns are matched to a resident and faculty mentor. These mentors guide our residents in both personal and professional development as they evolve from junior surgeon to independent surgeon.\n\nGlobal Surgery\n\nThe University of Washington has a strong tradition of participation in Global Health. The University of Washington Department of Global Health was founded in 2007 and is now well-established with renowned leadership. Several of our faculty have active partnerships with, or have previously worked at the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland. We are dedicated to providing residents with opportunities to build knowledge, share experiences, and gain skills in global surgery. The Global Surgery Track exists for those residents who plan to pursue an academic career in global surgery, however the department also offers many activities for all residents interested in global surgery.\n\nThe Global Surgery Track is available via the 7-year Research and 5-year Clinical Tracks. Most residents receive funding with an NIH Fogarty Award. Please let us know of your interest during the interview season. Applications are made from within the residency program.\n\nResearch\n\nThe University of Washington is listed among the top U.S. Public Universities and one of the top Universities in the world (Academic Ranking of World Universities). The UW School of Medicine is an internationally renowned research institution and regularly ranks in the top in the nation for NIH and extramurally funded research. It is in this context that our department can provide an extraordinary breadth of basic science, translational, clinical outcomes, health services research and global surgery opportunities.

Specific areas of investigative interest for our faculty members can be viewed on our Department of Surgery Research web section.\n\nTraining Tracks\n\nWe offer two different tracks aimed to tailor the training experience to each individual resident’s research and career goals.\n\n7-Year Research Track\n\nThe 7-year Research Track is particularly designed for those individuals who desire to contribute to the advancement of basic, clinical or other surgical science over the span of their career.\n\nResidents in our 7-year Research Track know on Match Day about their research plan and can begin thinking about their plans and working with mentors from day 1. Our Director of Resident Research and Associate Chair for Research provide robust mentorship in guiding our residents to a lab, starting with a September BBQ in the intern year. Learn more >>\n\nSome other highlights:\n\nMost residents spend 2 years in a dedicated research program, but an option to extend is available\n\nMost residents obtain masters and even doctoral level degrees during this time. For those residents on T32 grants, tuition is included in the award.\n\nResidents go out into the lab following the completion of the R3 year\n\nGiven the plethora of research-related resources available, over 95% of our residents perform their research at the University of Washington.\n\nResidents are free to moonlight during the research years, provided it does not interfere with their research responsibilities.\n\nSalary funding during the research years is primarily funded through extramural awards and NIH T32 training grants: Gastrointestinal Surgical Outcomes Research Postdoctoral Fellowship and the more basic/translational area of Biologic Response to Injury based at Harborview. Additional support is provided by the John and Helen Schilling Surgery Resident Research Endowment to cost share and maintain salary level at the appropriate PGY level.\n\nThe University of Washington is also home to countless NIH-funded T32 research fellowship programs. Our surgery residents have been extraordinarily successful in competing for these awards to include: cancer epidemiology, bioengineering, cardiology, vascular biology, gastroenterology, pediatric injury, palliative care, oncology and global surgery.\n\nAdditionally, there are a number of funded investigators and labs in both the Department of Surgery and partner departments offering opportunities to join ongoing, funded projects in pediatric surgery, congenital cardiac surgery, surgical oncology, breast cancer, transplant immunology, bioinformatics, health metrics, simulation and others.\n\n5-Year Clinical Track\n\nWe are equally interested in superior applicants of all genres. Applicants who match into the Clinical Track at UW have very diverse backgrounds and we are equally excited about each resident:\n\nMD/PhD’s with significant prior research experience. For these applicants, please be assured of our commitment to and resources to support your continued peripheral involvement in research during your clinical training years.\n\nResidents who desire additional professional development opportunities for one or two years following the 5-year clinical training program in a 5+2 model. Several of past graduates have taken advantage of this pathway to successful careers in academia, global surgery or the community.\n\nA commitment to the U.S. Armed Forces or Indian Health Services that limit training time.\n\nInterest in community or rural surgical care. As the only university teaching hospital for the 5 state WWAMI region, the University of Washington is extremely committed to training superior surgeons that will provide high quality care in community or rural settings.\n\nResidents complete training in 5 years and, if interested, can participate in clinical research through our CBATL, SORCE and HIPRC research units. These free resources are available for our residents to provide comprehensive research support services and assist with project design, IRB application, data analysis, presentation and grant funding.\n\nEducational & Research Conferences\n\nHarkins Symposium\n\nIn 1955 “The Society of the Golden Pouch,” a spoof surgical society, was established by residents to honor the Department of Surgery’s first Chairman, Henry N. Harkins, at a dinner celebrating his fiftieth birthday. The “founders” intended that the new society would disband at the end of the evening. The Harkins Society, as it was renamed, instead went on to become the Department’s Alumni Society. Its membership includes the Department of Surgery faculty, former residents, and fellows. Today, the Harkins Society is rich with tradition. In celebration, all faculty and residents of the Department of Surgery meet as a community every fall to have a day of educational lectures delivered by our faculty. In this way we celebrate the great breadth and depth of clinical expertise in our department.\n\nStrauss Lecture\n\nAt the Department of Surgery Annual Strauss Lecture, the Strauss/Friedlander family, is carrying on the tradition established so many years ago by Dr. and Mrs. Alfred A. Strauss. Born in Germany in 1881, Dr. Strauss came to Colville, WA at the age of ten. An honor graduate of the University of Washington in 1904 and an outstanding member of the Alumni Association, he received the singular honor of the Alumnus Summa Laude Dignatus in 1951. The annual Strauss Lecture is the concluding event to the Harkins Symposium. Prior Strauss lecturers represent the top figures in American surgery.\n\nResident Research Day & Schilling Lecture\n\nThe Department of Surgery Research Symposium and the Schilling Lectureship are made possible by a generous gift from the late Helen Schilling in honor of her husband Dr. John Schilling. The Schillings were deeply committed to teaching, scholarship and research and this event where residents showcase their research supported by faculty mentors–is a great aspect of their legacy. Every year the department meets together as a community to hear both residents and faculty present their research providing an opportune moment to reflect on both the phenomenal quality of research in the department. The Schilling Lecturers represent a distinguished group of scholars who join us as visiting faculty and help us to award prizes to the top resident presenters. It is with tremendous pride and gratitude that we carry on this tradition.\n\nAnnual Department of Surgery Education Seminar\n\nEach spring the residents and faculty of the Department of Surgery gather together as a community for an afternoon focused on surgical education. Each year has a different topical focus. This is a time for us all to learn and grow as surgical educators.\n\nSalary and Benefits\n\nAn appointment at UW offers a wide range of benefits as part of your compensation package, including Medical, Dental and Long-term Disability options; matched retirement plans and investment programs; Vacation and sick leave benefits, wellness resources, work/life programs including on-site childcare, tuition-exemption for higher-education courses, and more!\n\nThe University of Washington School of Medicine Office of Graduate Medical Education (GME) oversees wellness and benefits to all ACGME-accredited residency and fellowship training programs at UW, including general surgery.

Some of the popular areas are highlighted below, as are our major hospitals for orientation purposes. Whether you are looking for an apartment in the center of Seattle’s night life, a single-family home with a yard on a quiet street, or quick access to one of our parks, biking/running trails, or waterfronts, Seattle offers vibrant neighborhoods that make life outside the hospital even more enjoyable. Each neighborhood has a unique flare with a variety of places for residents to live, dine, and enjoy time outside the hospital.\n\nSurvey results from current trainees:\n\nOf current residents...\n\n61% live with a partner\n\n26% have a platonic roommate\n\n11% have children\n\n42% have pets\n\n65% have house plants\n\nWill I need a car?\n\nConsistently ranked as one of the best cities in the United States for both biking to work and public transit, many of our residents commute in various ways depending on the rotation they are on.\n\nAlmost all residents eventually get a personal vehicle, which not only facilitates commuting to our 7 training sites but makes weekend escapes to the surrounding state and national parks even easier.\n\nSeattle Rankings:\n\n#1 – City with the Best Outdoor Activities in the U.S.\n\n#1 - Best Coffee City in America\n\n#1 – Best Public Transportation in the U.S.\n\n#1 – Biking City in the U.S.\n\nTop 10 Most Walkable Cities in the U.S.\n\nTop 10 Healthiest Places to Live in the U.S.\n\nTop 10 Best Places to Live in the U.S.\n\nFood and Dining\n\nThe food and drink scene in Seattle is exploding! You may have a hard time choosing where to eat, and there is something for every budget. Food trucks are everywhere serving up nearly anything you can think of. The website Seattlefoodtruck.com also provides a convenient locator. Many of these make stops close to Harborview for quick lunchtime eats! The restaurants in and around Seattle offer choices for every price point and preference. It seems that nearly every corner of the city boasts its own pho or ramen house, and the International District offers an array of Asian cuisines as well as beautiful markets and shops.\n\nEach neighborhood in Seattle also has its own “urban village” with restaurants and bars lining the main street. The waters around Seattle provide an ample supply of fresh seafood, and many restaurants service locally sourced produce, meat, and dairy for a true farm-to- table experience. You can even eat well on a resident’s salary: several times per year, more than 150 restaurants participate in Seattle Restaurant Week where a 3-course meal is offered for $30.\n\nIf cooking at home is more your speed, there are plenty of options. The Pike Place Market is a can’t miss destination for all of your culinary needs, and most neighborhoods have weekly farmer’s markets offering seasonal produce, homemade cheese, farm fresh eggs, bread, and more. Check out seattlefarmersmarkets.org for more information.\n\nWhile the Pacific Northwest may be known for its expansive supply of craft breweries, there is also an expansive market of locally produced wine and spirits. Within several hours, you can drive east to either Walla Walla, WA, or south to the Willamette Valley in Oregon to visit vineyards where world renowned wine is produced. Alternatively, within 30 minutes of Seattle in the city of Woodinville are nearly 100 tasting rooms serving Washington wine. Distilleries in Seattle offer tours and tastings, as well.\n\nOutdoor Activities\n\nSeattle and the surrounding area provide unsurpassed opportunities for outdoor activities, whatever your passion, experience or skill level. Ask our residents about what to do on the water, in the mountains, or in the snow. They regularly sail, kayak, stand-up paddleboard, and fish: Aqua Verde Paddle Club Seattle Sailing Club\n\nWithin a short drive of Seattle, residents have access to the Cascade mountains which provide options for hiking and camping in the summer and snowshoeing and skiing in the winter: Washington Trails Association, North Cascades National Park, Olympic National Park, San Juan Islands, Crystal Mountain, Stevens Pass Summit at Snoqualmie/Alpental, and Mount Baker\n\nAlternatively, embrace Seattle’s town pride and support the local sports teams: Mariners,\n\nSeahawks, Sounders, Storm, and UW Husky Sports\n\nArts and Entertainment\n\nSeattle is home to a diverse community and a wide variety of opportunities to explore arts and entertainment. If the performing arts interest you, there’s the Seattle Opera, Seattle Symphony, ACT theater, and Seattle Repertory Theater as well as Pacific Northwest Ballet.\n\nFor those who prefer visual art, Seattle offers the Seattle Art Museum, Asian Art Museum, Olympic Sculpture Park, Chilhuly Garden and Glass Museum, and the Frye Art Museum. Even the UW Campus features the Henry Art Gallery, displaying contemporary and modern art. The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, also on the UW campus, has an extensive collection of Native American artifacts and anthropological specimens to peruse.\n\nThose with eclectic tastes will enjoy the Experience Music Project (EMP) Museum, the Museum of History & Industry, and the famous Seattle Gum Wall at Pike Place Market. For every major art gallery or theater, there are many more small galleries, performing spaces, film festivals, and of course, there’s the award-winning and ever-changing public art scene a little off the beaten path. In fact, Seattle is home to over 400 permanent public art works and nearly 3,000 portable works.\n\nCommunity Life in our Department\n\nWhen asked, “What’s the best thing about the UW Department of Surgery?” most people quickly answer: the people. Our people – faculty, residents, staff and our families – are awesome. They are intelligent, committed, driven, warm, generous, kind and fun! So, we try and spend time together as much as we can. We start with an intern welcome picnic and summer pancake breakfast. In August we have the Department of Surgery picnic. September starts our triannual resident socials sponsored by the department and the research resident BBQ. The Women-In-Surgery group (started by one of our residents) has monthly informal get-togethers at a faculty home where female faculty and residents (plus kids) hang out. Our annual holiday party is another all-department event that’s memorable each year. Of course, we have all the usual graduation events in the spring along with the resident Oyster Fry. But one of the UW highlights of the year is Ski Day!\n\nHistory provided by Dr. Hugh Foy, Professor Emeritus: “Ski Day was initiated in Feb 1979 by Chairman, Dr. John Schilling. Dr. James Carrico was the Program Director. It was a time of transition and change; Harborview had been an “every other night” program and the crush of clinical volume, particularly at HMC where there was only one Chief resident was difficult to say the least. There was no food service in-house, only vending machines. Vacation was limited to 2 weeks. Harborview Medical Center “shifts” were typically 40 hours on, 8 off. The ER rotation was 27 hours on (24 hrs plus follow-up clinic) – 21 off. Salary was in the bottom 5th percentile nationally, and there was no such thing as meal reimbursement or parental leave. Faced with a high attrition rate and low morale, the residents met and drew up 14 significant issues that were felt to be critical for their continued ability to safely deliver care. In a “let them eat cake” astute political move, Schilling told Carrico to “buy them a keg, rent them a bus and send them skiing for a day.”\n\nThis event is held each year on President’s Day from 7am-7pm. It is supported by department funds and faculty good will and is a time to promote resident morale and camaraderie. Although the Department can no longer fund a keg, as an alcohol-free event, it still pays for the lift tickets.\n\nGraduates\n\nApproximately 90% of our graduates enter fellowship programs, commonly matching to one of their top choices.

Statements\n\nMany graduates write to us and here’s what they have to say about our residency training program. One of the reasons we keep the older comments is to show: we continue to train the same superior surgeon!\n\n“My training at UW has prepared me extremely well for this job… the amazing ICU experience I had as a resident, the responsibility of making critical decisions in sick patients at Harborview and UW, as well as the amount of independence we had as senior residents and the problem-solving skills we learned, all helped in preparing me for this Pediatric Surgery fellowship spot.”\n\nChong, MD – ’05\n\n“Set aside the outstanding clinical experiences at university, veterans, children, county, and private hospitals. Set aside the research opportunities at one of the highest NIH funded schools in the country. Set aside world-renowned faculty and some of the best residents in the country. What are you left with? One of the most beautiful cities in the world with salt water 3 minutes away, incredible skiing one hour away, a downtown full of culture, a university with endless events, and a view of Mt. Rainier turning pink at sunset. Come to UW!”\n\nSullivan, MD – ’07\n\n\"I am a current Chief Resident, and in fact, am a PGY-10! I graduated from a medical school in Japan and finished my FIRST surgical residency there. Having heard of the excellence in surgical education in the US, I decided to seek further training in this country. In my SECOND residency at the UW, learning opportunities were everywhere. There were always enthusiastic attendings who were eager to teach at the bedside and in the OR. I just confirmed the nationwide reputation of the UW program when I was going through the interviews this spring for my Cardiothoracic Surgery Fellowship and I’m pleased to have matched at Columbia Presybterian. I am proud to be one of the residents in this excellent program.”\n\nTakayama, MD – ’07\n\n“Fellowship is treating me well. People at MSKCC are all fantastic – attendings, the other fellows, great people. While it has only been a few months, I’ve had the opportunity to work and operate with several different attendings and I can honestly say that from a clinical and technical perspective, UW did a fantastic job of preparing me. I’ve seen Farhood obviously and I get the same sense from him. I hope the rest of the current residents and future applicants realize how well they are trained. Not blowing smoke either, the program really is top notch.”\n\nWolf, MD – ’10\n\n“The residents and faculty at the UW treat each other in a respectful and friendly manner. They embrace the notion of work hard, play hard. The city offers great food, music, art, and culture. Surrounded by water and mountains, plenty of outdoor opportunities await you. Working at five hospitals, each with their distinctive patient population, provides you with both volume and diversity with respect to clinical cases. Didactics are mandatory, well directed, and relevant. The research opportunities are limitless and most importantly the faculty are open-minded in this regard. Can I think of a better program? No!”\n\nFarjah, MD – ’10\n\n“I’ve partnered up with the only fellowship trained laparoscopic surgeon in the area doing both general and bariatric surgery out of four private hospitals. Starting this practice, I now have realized the true value of our residency. I honestly feel so over-prepared to take on any clinical problems with any patients it’s really satisfying. This is both in and out of the OR. My fellowship was personally necessary given that most of what I do daily is done laparoscopically, but our ICU experience and the overall open surgical training in and out of the OR is now serving as my backbone… With the training from our program, I can proudly tell you that residency was easily worth it and more.”\n\nKwon, MD – ’11\n\n“Thoracic fellowship has been amazing, and I could not be happier at WashU. Through all the ups and downs of residency, the skills I obtained have paid amazing dividends. Through observation alone, not everyone starts fellowship at the same level, and one of the most critical aspects of my general surgery training that kept me above the pack was the independent thinking, decision making and troubleshooting that I learned at the University of Washington. We all develop great technical skills in the end, but this mentality instilled a certain confidence that often goes underappreciated. You can’t realize this often until you leave your comfort zone (residency) and go somewhere else, and you then realize that you can deal with or troubleshoot pretty much everything. You become the go-to guy in the minds of the attendings because they can trust you to do the right thing. I know residents focus so much on case numbers, and they are important, but there is so much more to it than that. I want to work with people who make the right decision, know how to troubleshoot, think on their feet, and are good surgeons. This is what the University of Washington does extremely well.”\n\nKeech, M.D. ’12\n\n“Now that I’ve been away from UW for a few months, and had a chance to see what my training has done for me, and the sort of surgeon it has made me, I’m writing to say, with more vigor and enthusiasm than these words can ever capture: thank you…. It’s certainly been true that I feel at home in the operating room and no one here is asking me to do things that I can’t do, and in most cases haven’t done many times before. What’s totally blown me away, in retrospect, is not the way that I was trained to operate, but the way that I was taught to think… time and time again I’ve found that I am the one — among a cast of residents, fellows, and attendings — who knows the literature on how to manage problems, optimize patient care, and minimize errors. All the exercises that sometimes seemed tedious as a resident have given me an outstanding foundation as a fellow… all were essential to making me the doctor I am, and, I’m finding, are hardly universal in training programs everywhere. The biggest struggle I’m having here is finding my way in a place where, to a surprising degree, dogma beats data. But already I’ve been able to use the strength of thought, analysis, questioning, and hardheaded determination that the UW bred into me to get some things changing. … It’s going to be a long process, but there is a lot of low-hanging fruit that my UW training makes easy to pick. Such things are hard to measure, of course, but the more I use what I learned in Seattle, the more I’m convinced of something I never really doubted: that we are the finest general surgery residency in existence. I couldn’t be prouder to know that I’ll always be able to say I’m UW trained.”\n\nJ.E. Kohler, MD – ’13\n\n“I knew going into the match that the University of Washington was a truly excellent surgery program and that I would get top notch surgical training there. What I didn’t know at the time was how supportive and encouraging the entire program would be from a personal standpoint. I know that the culture of any organization starts at the top, and I appreciate you for creating such a challenging and supportive environment to train in. I could not be happier with my choice. Thank you for all of your help.”\n\nMulloy, MD – ‘14\n\n“This email has been a long time coming. I have thought of you so many times over the past year I can't even count them all. Every day I am grateful for the incredible training experience I had at the UW. So many surgeons' voices whisper in my head as I operate. I have felt prepared for every type of case, all patient situations and even the intangible interactions with nurses, techs, other services and patient families. I am officially a board-certified general surgeon and what an accomplishment that was. Receiving that news was more rewarding than any other result I have ever received. I know that would not have been possible without all the labor and love that everyone in Seattle gave freely to me over my 8 years of training. I love my life here in Atlanta. I couldn't be happier with the career choice I have made. I constantly feel humbled and fortunate that I get to call this \"work.\" One of the neonatologists recently said she has never seen a Peds Surg fellow smile as much as I do, but how can I not with a career this rewarding? I just started my senior fellow year and there is nothing like it. Purple and Gold run through my veins as I have made some changes as the senior fellow (afternoon rounds on patients rather than just computer rounds, clinic each week, etc). You took a chance on me nearly 10 years ago and I could not be more thankful. Thank you again for all that you did to shape me into the surgeon and person I am today.”\n\nM. Richards, MD, MPH – ‘18\n\nRecruitment & Selection\n\nWe interview approximately 80 candidates each year for 7 positions from across the U.S. We do not prefer applicants from any geographic region of the country and rather enjoy welcoming residents from across the spectrum of the north/south/east/west. We train graduates of all medical schools based strictly on their qualifications. Each application is reviewed in its entirety with an interest in diverse candidates demonstrating overall academic excellence, personal character, strong values, altruism, work experience, proven leadership ability, and career development potential.\n\nAs part of our commitment to training future leaders in surgery, we recognize the importance of diversity in maintaining excellence in education, advocacy, and research. We encourage applicants from URiM backgrounds to apply to our program as we support our University’s mission to further our community through diversity and inclusion.

Our Residency Position Appointment Agreement and its addendum detail the terms and conditions of residency at the University of Washington. Please follow this link to review information regarding Prospective Residents and familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions of residency at the University of Washington.\n\nInternational Medical Graduates\n\nForeign Nationals\n\nForeign nationals that are selected to interview with our program will be provided with a list of documents/data that will be required by our GME Office.\n\nStudents and graduates of foreign medical schools should view our Certificate Program for International Physicians (see below), which is a pre-requisite for those who seek preliminary residency positions in our program. F-1 Visa (see below) holders must receive pre-approval prior to ranking.\n\nPolicy For Student VISA Holders\n\nThe University of Washington has a new visa policy requirement for students that are currently on F-1 student visas. In the event you match with the University of Washington General Surgery residency program, your F-1 visa will convert to an Optional Practice Training (OPT) for the R1 year.\n\nIn the past, residents on OPT would then apply for a H-1B visa. The University hopes to continue to provide H-1B visas to residents on OPT. However, we cannot guarantee this process will continue in the future.\n\nAssuming H1-B visas will continue to be offered to OPT students, the new visa policy requires that we receive pre-approval from our GME office and the International Service offices in order to place you on our rank list.\n\nCertificate Program for International Medical Graduates\n\nEach year the Department of Surgery at the University of Washington offers 3 visiting sub-internship positions to international medical graduates who are interested in pursuing a position in our residency program. These sessions take place in December-January, February-March, and April-May.\n\nSURG CP688 P-Subinternship in General Surgery for International Physicians – 8 weeks\n\nThe objective of this course is to permit the international physician to work in a US teaching hospital as well as further develop knowledge of surgical disease and enhance the ability to manage comprehensively the problems encountered in surgical patients.
