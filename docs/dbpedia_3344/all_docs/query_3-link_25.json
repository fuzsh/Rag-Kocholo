        "text": "Program Overview\n\nThe biology program at Simpson University offers a strong depth of instruction in the biological sciences while encompassing the breadth of the different areas biologists study. Within our major, students have the option to specialize in pre-health sciences which allows for additional classes needed to prepare for medical, dental or pharmacy school as well as other careers in the allied health industry. With a graduate placement rate of nearly 100%, many of our graduates have gone onto such careers or have pursued graduate and/or professional education programs."
