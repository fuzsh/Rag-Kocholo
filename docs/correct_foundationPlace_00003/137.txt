[15min] Introduction to Higgins [Paul]

As we move towards paying more attention to documentation and technical marketing of what we've already done, we need to find a way to divide Higgins into logical peices.

Paul will introduce the new three layer model (See Solutions)

Paul will then focus on the "new/old" bottom layer: (see Context Data Model)

[10min] API Extensibility [Jim]

Now that we've decided to consider Higgins APIs "provisional" (see <insert link>) this issue is something that we can keep working on over time.

Jim present requirements

Differing proposals are at IdAS API Extensibility

Are we going to use deprecation?

We're pushing this beyond 1.0, and tentatively pushing this agenda topic to a later slot.

[1hr] IdAS and the Higgins Data Model; Open Issues [Jim]

Background: Higgins Data Model

Issues are tracked at Data Model Open Issues#General

Covered "mixed attribute values" and "Closed or Open Simple data types" but didn't really get a lot of resolution.

Still need to talk about other two issues

Remember this Card Overview

Feedback that something has happened when you use this feature

9:30 [45min] Selector UIs [Tony?, Andy?]

Higgins is blessed(!) with multiple i-card selector UIs:

GTK-based "DigitalMe" on Linux

Cocoa-based "DigitalMe" on OSX

RCP-based

Firefox-embedded (requires hosted I-Card svc)h

AIR-based (requires hosted I-Card svc)

Need to reduce the number of parallel implementations

Need to converge on a common UI

Document the steps in any login process where: (trying for "common enough" here)

The user needs to make a decision (e.g. to operate a control)

What information is needed by the user to make the decision

Where this information comes from

What is at risk if such a choice is hidden from the user, e.g. by user preference

Need to improve the UI

What about http://wiki.eclipse.org/User_Interface_Best_Practices_Working_Group

10:30 [30min] The Future of the Configuration Component [Greg]

Configuration component: need two versions of Configuration.common (one for plugin-based configurations and one for jar-based configurations)

support "writing" not just reading

requirement: there's no configuration schema so I don't know how to build the Map

requirement: ability to write out configuration

requirement: ability to update the configuration itself through writing

better support for passwords in the file

make it possible to do "round tripping" somehow (MikeM)

Mike please elaborate

central configuration service?

problems: how to transfer stuff from file system (e.g. keystore) to the service?

we're currently passing objects around that are hard to serialize

use JSON

Configuration UI?

C++ Configuration Component?

11:00 [15 min] Access Control [Tom]

Access Control Issues in LDAP

Acesss Control Issues in JNDI

General Access Control Issues

Providing Access Control through IdAS

Should we start collecting use cases?

There is now Access_Control_in_IdAS

Tom and Jim will foster this

11:40 [20min] Separating out the Selector Authentication Service [Drummond]

Today the web-based selector uses a username and "master" password to authenticate directly to the back end selector service (aka rpps)

A new approach is to factor out provisioning and authentication of the client-side identity selector to separate web services. This approach has several advantages:

It can provide non-identifying tokens to provision and/or authenticate a back end selector service account, preserving privacy.

It can standardize provisioning and configuration of multiple front-end identity selectors (e.g., on different devices all used by the same user) to talk to the same back end identity agent.

It can opening new models of authentication in the future without requiring changes to the back end identity agent service.

Work has begun on a protocol for this purpose: ISAP - Identity Selector Authentication Protocol.

It lays the foundation for a "grand unification" of OpenID and Cards --The Selector Authentication Service can also (optionally) be the user's OpenID OP. We can nestle the concept of I-Cards UNDERNEATH the user's OpenID. OpenID's are great for public identification (e.g. log on to blogs, etc.) and for social networking and other low transaction value, public interactions where the person wants to use (or doesn't mind using) a 100% correlatable identifier. Cards are multiple, contextualized, nuanced and may be anonymous, pseudonymous, or partly to fully identifying. The opportunity here is to unify the two. Since the user already has an OpenID password at a service she trusts, we can (thanks to OpenID 1.1 and especially 2.0's XRDS discovery mechanism) simply add the Selector Service as a new XRDS service endpoint. The user now has only ONE master password. They have an OpenID that works anywhere and they have a card/selector service that integrates nicely with it. [Paul and Drummond are working on a white paper that describes this grand unification. The OpenID foundation is also exploring unification approaches, so this is all very timely]

We have begun conversations with OpenID providers on implementing ISAP on their end to allow them to offer selector services

Lunch

[15min] Review of Eclipse Release Review Slides [Mary]

Mary will send slides to list

Wednesday Afternoon

[20 min] Considerations for a multi-protocol ID provider [Uppili]

When considering merging of STS and SAML from a Higgins infrastructure perspective, it will be useful to discuss and get some common understanding about what is the ultimate "functional" objective. Are there cross-functional use cases in scope for the resulting multi-protocol system, or are we just sharing code between what would be completely independent systems. Would this guide how to approach the same issue if a reference implementation of OpenID were considered as part of Higgins (in future).

Look at the canonical layers of an IDP

Allude about infrastructure building blocks that can be shared

Meditate about some cross-protocol use cases / scenarios (like global sign-out)

( I think this item should be here or somewhere prior to the "Merging" discussion, below).

[15 min] Short session on STS IdP / SAML IdP merge/refactoring [Mike]

In NY we were looking at things that could be reused

We agree it can be done

To be continued on Thursday

[15 min] Introduction to Open Identity Network Non-profit [Paul]

See OIN

See http://openidentitynetwork.org <-- not "real" yet

Definition of r-card. See R-Card --includes proposed ISIP-M-Card format extension/addition.

Where r-cards fit in Higgins Data Model

How they work -- the eCommerce change-of-address "VRM" use case

[45min] Introduction to XDI and X3 [Drummond]

Very brief background on OASIS XDI TC

Explain how XDI is the protocol equivalent of the Higgins Data Model (and that's why I'm working with Paul and Markus and Higgins)

Show a few simple examples of X3 (using Markus' XDI Converter) to show how the XDI RDF Model can be used to implement the HDM and vice versa.

Point out the XDI RDF Model sections.

Finish by showing X3 for the same r-card scenario that Paul went through

5pm [45min] Design Principles [Mike]

Code Reuse and Size and Prerequisites

Reduce Download Size, Redundant Code, and Maintenance

Smallest/Earliest Possible JRE

Reusable System Services

Configurable Components

Need to make the ConfigurationSettings available more consistently (getInstance/Singleton)

Need to convert classes in ...sts.utilities into shared components

ImplementationFactory

Code to Interfaces not Implementations

Configuration Maps Implementation Classes to Interfaces

Call "Object ImplementationFactory.getInstance(IInterfaceClass)"

ConversionService

Extensible by configuration, not by change to core code

Configuration Maps Conversion Classes to SourceClass/DestinationClass pairs

Replaces BindingHelper, CertificateHelper, XMLHelper, DateHelper, UUIDHelper, functions

Call "Object ConversionService.convert(Object from, Class to)"

Replace KeyGenHelper/X931KeyGenerator with: RPIDGenerator

CertificateChain should be passed in, should not reconnect in this module

> > PPIDGenerator > > KeyPairGenerator > > CertificateChainGenerator > > UUIDGenerator > > EVCertificateManager > > Extensible by configuration > > Call "boolean isEV(Certificate cert)", > > WebApp Structure > > Split TokenService WebApp into > > TokenService (WS-Trust/STS) > > MetadataExchangeService > > ProfileService > > All common code in JARs > > All deployment specific configuration files +JARs in WAR > > Move System Properties to WEB.XML file! > >

[15min] Plugin vs. JAR Dynamic Loading and ClassPath/Resource Issues [Mike]

> > Can we add /Resource/*config.xml to Plugin without impact to JARs? > > How do we deal with log4j.properties? It is in the redist plugin -

how can we change it without changing plugin code?

[30min] PKCS5 vs. ISO10126 Encryption/Decryption [Mike]

Should always: Encrypt via PKCS5 and Decrypt via ISO10126 Encrypt Decrypt Relying Party No* Yes Identity Selector Yes No* Identity Provider Yes Yes *Current implementations may not use encrypt or decrypt but future ones may. The IXMLSecurityExtension should be broken into: IXMLSignatureExtension IXMLEncryptionExtension IXMLDecryptionExtension The xmlsecurity.apache should be broken into xmlsignatureextension.apache xmlencryptionextension.apache xmldecryptionextension.apache The xmlsec-1.4.0 (1.4.1) should not be in the redist plugin. It should be in the various xml*extension.apache plugins. The name of the config.xml (IBM vs. Sun(default)) should be a configuration setting

2pm [2hrs] STS IdP Solution in Depth [Mike]

Similar to New York F2F sesion, but shorter

(Weds or Thurs please)

STS Work items:

STS token service still bypasses IdAS to access/update attributes

Sample STS should cut over to using XMLFile Context Provider

Use of "informationCard generator" in STS's profile service?

Currently the STS MEX endpoint only advertises support for transport-level security (using UN token or self-seigned SAML token)

OpenID and Oauth

[45min] Merging SAML2 IdP into STS framework [Mike, Markus]

Pre-merge refactoring

Should we rename low level reusable sts.* components -> htp.* (Higgins Token Processing)

Task planning

Resources

Extra topics we might not get to

[15 min] Card-based Oauth [Paul]

Support for Oauth in the world of Higgins

Oauth uses redirects all over the place and asks the person to sign in using un/pw at the service

provider. There must be a better user experience.

How about O-cards? User experience:

User gets an O-card from Service Provider (e.g. Google Calendar)

User fires up Oauth Consumer that wants Google Calendar data stream

Selector appears with Google Calendar card displayed

Selector UI asks to approve grant of rights

User clicks "Approve" button

Done. [No redirects, no un/pw entry at SP, etc.]

Autobuilds, Auto-tests

Eclipse features building: Peter is working on this

C++: currently built using "cmake" (configure and make). compatible with SUSE autobuild service.

builds the RPM packages.

Nightly Junit tests: for longer term

Moving, Renaming Components

Split selector selector from HBXIE

Plugins folder

.deployment.idas.basic -> move to app?

.rpps -> ss

.rsse -> rename to .ss.rsse

[30min] Five ways to integrate OpenID [Paul]

OP Uses Cards for Auth (prevents phishing)

Sxip OpenID Cards (OpenID claim type in managed cards or shared cards)

OpenID Card: fills in pw at OP (prevents phishing)

OpenID CP: OpenID OP into CP

OpenID & Cards: Grand Unification

More Fodder

Beyond Higgins 1.0
