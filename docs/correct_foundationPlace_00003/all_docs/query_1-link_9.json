The foundation for Provo’s block system was started with Pioneer Park in the 1800’s, which sits as a corner boundary for the Franklin Neighborhood at 500 West and Center Street.\n\nThe neighborhood boasts a rich collection of architecture and historic buildings. One hundred south holds three of the great historic homes in the neighborhood. Two of them have been maintained as they transitioned to commercial uses, the Hines mansion at 383 West and the Angus Beebe house at 489 West; while the other at 587 West has continued as a residence.\n\nThere are others scattered around the neighborhood that are still used as residences, like the Simon Eggertsen house at 390 South 500 West and the Jensen-Marrott home at 670 West 200 South, which help to maintain the historic character of Franklin.\n\nAs Provo City has grown, the Franklin Neighborhood has become an historic and central neighborhood with easy access to downtown, the interstate, and a commuter rail station.\n\n​Franklin Neighborhood Plan\n\nFranklin Neighborhood Nearby Parks\n\nFranklin Community Garden\n\n89 E 400 N\n\nProvo, UT 84606\n\n(801) 930-0675\n\nFranklin Community Garden, Provo UT\n\nFranklin Park\n\n807 W 600 S\n\nProvo, UT 84601\n\n(801) 852-6606\n\nFranklin Park, Provo UT"
