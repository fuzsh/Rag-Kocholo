        "meta_description": "Natural disasters, including water hazards, have become more severe due to climate change. However, direct measurements of river discharge remain sparse around the world, constraining modelling and prediction of future changes in many regions. Therefore, a robust hydrological prediction is a challenge across the world. \nIn this context, satellite data provides an attractive alternative to ground observations. Because of its physical relationship, known correlation with in-situ river discharge, and broad availability, satellite-based calibration ratio measurement (C/M ratio) has received a lot of attention. However, challenges have been identified in hydrological model calibration using this satellite data, presenting limitations that these data pose. Therefore, a novel approach for modelling river discharge in ungauged catchments is proposed that addresses some of the current limitations and constraints.\nFirstly, a novel foundation for gauging river discharge in ungauged catchments is suggested that advances existing approaches. While a longer microwave signal has generally been utilised to increase penetration, the coarse spatial resolution cancels out the benefit due to the implicit assumptions in the C/M ratio. New satellite data, Surrogate River discharge (SR), is derived to address both the signal penetrability and its coarseness. The new SR uses temporal referencing rationale, apart from the spatial referencing applied in the previous C/M ratio. It enables the use of signals with longer wavelengths by handling coarse grids. \nSecondly, a novel Bayesian calibration approach that uses SR is developed. This allows model calibration without ground observations while still employing SR via a rating curve, which is calibrated with a suggested likelihood. The approach ensures a broadly applicable approach to predictions in ungauged basins (PUB).\nLastly, an estimated hydrologic signature, such as the mean of river discharge, is added to the model calibration, making the whole prediction procedure independent from any in-situ river discharge. Additional analyses of sensitivity are conducted from the input data quality and the hydrologic signature. \nOverall, the proposed framework promises parsimonious but effective satellite data-driven hydrologic prediction. This new approach will significantly improve catchment simulation capacity, enhancing water security and flood forecasting.",
