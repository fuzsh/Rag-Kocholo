Also, an original typed letter signed by Isaac Asimov. One page, 4to, New York, 15th January 1949, to Erle Korshak of Shasta Publishers. One of the earliest Asimov letters we have seen with great content revealing the business nature and wit of the author. Asimov acknowledges receipt of his correspondent's letter, which he has read carefully, and remarks 'The notion of an annual anthology of the best of science fiction is a good one, and the continuing and growing market for hard-cover science-fiction is something that cannot help but be pleasant for an author', further adding 'Three of my stories have already been anthologized, and $25 establishes a record low as far as money returns are concerned rather easily, I might add so that I cannot help but hope that the larger publishing houses go on to express even more than mere interest' and also discussing the structure of fees in the release form that Korshak had sent him, 'I notice that if Shasta publishes the story, then I get $25 for each reprint i.e. 10 reprints, $250. If, however, someone other than Shasta, (say Simon & Schuster or Macmillan) publishes the story, then I get $25 altogether, i.e. 10 reprints, $25. This seems to follow the principle of \"Them ez hez most money; pays least\". Is that constitutional? Furthermore, the second paragraph says that an outside publisher will pay as much as Shasta can squeeze out of them, but in no case less than $25. The third paragraph, however, seems to commit me to accept $25 flat with no qualifying statement that it might conceivably be more. Being the world's poorest contract lawyer, these are probably silly points I am trying to make, but I would enjoy enlightenment'. Annotated in initialled by Korshak to the upper left corner, indicating that he replied to Asimov on 17th January 1949. Beautiful. First and Fine. Signed by Author(s).\n\nHardcovers.
