        "text": "Novell Introduces Channel Academy, a Training Program to Help Its Channel Partners Build Their Businesses\n\nPROVO, Utah  April 19, 1999  Novell®, Inc. today introduced the second phase of the Novell Channel Academy, Novell's largest-ever worldwide training initiative. The academy provides the sales and technical training Certified Novell Engineers (CNEs) and certified sales representatives need to meet the new certification requirements for PartnerNet99. The Novell Channel Academy, offered at minimal to no cost, addresses the needs of the growing number of channel partners who are building successful businesses based on selling and servicing Novell solutions. The new training program further enhances resellers' ability to sell and support Novell Directory Services® (NDS)-enabled solutions and Novell Internet-related services. Since its phase-one introduction in mid-March, this worldwide program has already certified 1,795 channel sales representatives. The program is achieving widespread success in 65 North American cities through an interactive satellite network, face-to-face seminars and self-study kits. Additional training opportunities have been provided in 30 European, 29 Asian and 14 Latin American cities.\n\n\"The channel is a strategic asset to Novell because customers look to the channel as the point of integration. Knowledge is the foundation of all strong channel partners, and the Novell Channel Academy provides that foundation quickly and at a minimal cost,\" said Bill Wall, worldwide director of channel marketing at Novell. \"Given the increasing demand for training on the latest Novell solutions such as BorderManager, GroupWise 5.5, NDS v. 8, NDS for NT 2.0 and NetWare 5, our channel partners need to get up-to-speed quickly on these enhancements so they can better service their customers.\"\n\nParticipants in PartnerNet99 and the Novell Channel Academy will be able to give customers superior solution recommendations and support for complex business technology issues, includingY2K preparation and security. If PartnerNet99 certification requirements are not met by July 1, 1999, they will be given the opportunity to rejoin at a later date. The Novell Channel Academy enables channel partners to quickly meet the PartnerNet99 knowledge requirements by providing access to improved sales and technical education. In addition, the program offers tools to drive adoption of NDS v. 8, NetWare 5 and NDS-enabled products such as BorderManager and ZENworks.\n\nImmediate feedback indicates many channel partners are anticipating that extended knowledge of Novell's product family will lead to new business opportunities. \"I am excited that Novell is offering this unique training program. Although I have been successfully selling Novell products for more than six years, in the past year I have seen a surge in interest for NDS and NetWare 5,\" said Garey Coonen, representing HighTower, Inc., a Novell Platinum reseller. \"With the recent onslaught of directory-enabled products, there are more and more opportunities for new business. As a result, our sales and technical people have needed to refresh their knowledge. They now have a better understanding of Novell's latest solutions and the different ways in which they can facilitate better business for our existing customers and potential customers.\"\n\nBreakthrough Training Methods\n\nFor the first time, Novell is able to reach thousands of channel sales representatives in one session through interactive satellite technology. For instance, some North American regions are taking advantage of the Novell Channel Academy via an interactive satellite network that is made possible by the use of Caliber Learning Network, an affiliate of Sylvan Learning Systems, Inc. Caliber Learning's interactive satellite network ties 43 cities in North America together and allows Novell to train up to 1,500 people in one session.
