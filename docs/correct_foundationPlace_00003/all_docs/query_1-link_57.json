Open Issues [Jim]\n\nBackground: Higgins Data Model\n\nIssues are tracked at Data Model Open Issues#General\n\nCovered \"mixed attribute values\" and \"Closed or Open Simple data types\" but didn't really get a lot of resolution.\n\nStill need to talk about other two issues\n\n3:00pm 15 min break\n\nFor background, here is the existing howl:HOWL\n\nReview of proposed changes to higgins.owl: HOWL Update\n\nNew higgins.owl\n\nPerson.owl Example\n\n4:10pm [15min] Higgins on Android [Tony, Paul]\n\nIBM\n\nIBM's CES Demo\n\nParity\n\n[5min] Parity's work\n\nWebKit limitations\n\nJavascript injection approach\n\nChallenges/Issues\n\nWishlist\n\nStarting an Android work area within Higgins?\n\nIP issues around Android\n\nContributions\n\n4:20pm [10min] DEMO: Eclipse-based Selector [Mike]\n\nSolution: Eclipse-based Selector Solution\n\nInstallation on Windows with IE\n\nSign in to RP site\n\n4:30pm [45min+] Higgins Selector Selector [Mike, Paul]\n\nIntro: Read http://www.incontextblog.com/?p=17\n\nPlatform-idependent architecture:\n\nDiscussion of the design\n\nSee diagram on slide #7 here: <missing link>\n\nSee also Higgins Platform Support notation proposal\n\n[5min] Report on Java Impl Selector Performance Issues [Paul]\n\nSelector Performance Information\n\n[15min] DEMO: Client-based Selector \"DigitalMe\" [Andy]\n\nDemo\n\nCurrent status\n\nIntegration of next-gen HBX and Higgins Selector Selector ??\n\nDocumentation\n\nHarmonization of Bandit site\n\nRoadmap\n\n9:00am Wednesday Morning\n\n9:10 [10min] [DEMO] Firefox-embedded Selector Demo [Paul]\n\nWe've added what we think is a UI improvment over CardSpace UX: \"remember this card (at this site)\" (coupled with \"remember this password for the card\")\n\nRemember this Card Overview\n\nFeedback that something has happened when you use this feature\n\n9:30 [45min] Selector UIs [Tony?, Andy?]\n\nHiggins is blessed(!) with multiple i-card selector UIs:\n\nGTK-based \"DigitalMe\" on Linux\n\nCocoa-based \"DigitalMe\" on OSX\n\nRCP-based\n\nFirefox-embedded (requires hosted I-Card svc)h\n\nAIR-based (requires hosted I-Card svc)\n\nNeed to reduce the number of parallel implementations\n\nNeed to converge on a common UI\n\nDocument the steps in any login process where: (trying for \"common enough\" here)\n\nThe user needs to make a decision (e.g. to operate a control)\n\nWhat information is needed by the user to make the decision\n\nWhere this information comes from\n\nWhat is at risk if such a choice is hidden from the user, e.g. by user preference\n\nNeed to improve the UI\n\nWhat about http://wiki.eclipse.org/User_Interface_Best_Practices_Working_Group\n\n10:15 [15 min] [DEMO] AIR-based Selector Demo [Jeesmon]\n\n[3 min] HBX/Firefox Demo [Paul]\n\n[12 min] HBX/IE AIR web-based Selector Demo [Jeesmon remote from Needham, MA]\n\nArchitecture Diagram including integration with Selector Selector\n\nInstallation demonstration\n\nLogin to RP site demonstration\n\n10:30 [30min] The Future of the Configuration Component [Greg]\n\nConfiguration component: need two versions of Configuration.common (one for plugin-based configurations and one for jar-based configurations)\n\nsupport \"writing\" not just reading\n\nrequirement: there's no configuration schema so I don't know how to build the Map\n\nrequirement: ability to write out configuration\n\nrequirement: ability to update the configuration itself through writing\n\nbetter support for passwords in the file\n\nmake it possible to do \"round tripping\" somehow (MikeM)\n\nMike please elaborate\n\ncentral configuration service?\n\nproblems: how to transfer stuff from file system (e.g. keystore) to the service?\n\nwe're currently passing objects around that are hard to serialize\n\nuse JSON\n\nConfiguration UI?\n\nC++ Configuration Component?\n\n11:00 [15 min] Access Control [Tom]\n\nAccess Control Issues in LDAP\n\nAcesss Control Issues in JNDI\n\nGeneral Access Control Issues\n\nProviding Access Control through IdAS\n\nShould we start collecting use cases?\n\nThere is now Access_Control_in_IdAS\n\nTom and Jim will foster this\n\n11:40 [20min] Separating out the Selector Authentication Service [Drummond]\n\nToday the web-based selector uses a username and \"master\" password to authenticate directly to the back end selector service (aka rpps)\n\nA new approach is to factor out provisioning and authentication of the client-side identity selector to separate web services. This approach has several advantages:\n\nIt can provide non-identifying tokens to provision and/or authenticate a back end selector service account, preserving privacy.\n\nIt can standardize provisioning and configuration of multiple front-end identity selectors (e.g., on different devices all used by the same user) to talk to the same back end identity agent.\n\nIt can opening new models of authentication in the future without requiring changes to the back end identity agent service.\n\nWork has begun on a protocol for this purpose: ISAP - Identity Selector Authentication Protocol.\n\nIt lays the foundation for a \"grand unification\" of OpenID and Cards --The Selector Authentication Service can also (optionally) be the user's OpenID OP. We can nestle the concept of I-Cards UNDERNEATH the user's OpenID. OpenID's are great for public identification (e.g. log on to blogs, etc.) and for social networking and other low transaction value, public interactions where the person wants to use (or doesn't mind using) a 100% correlatable identifier. Cards are multiple, contextualized, nuanced and may be anonymous, pseudonymous, or partly to fully identifying. The opportunity here is to unify the two. Since the user already has an OpenID password at a service she trusts, we can (thanks to OpenID 1.1 and especially 2.0's XRDS discovery mechanism) simply add the Selector Service as a new XRDS service endpoint. The user now has only ONE master password. They have an OpenID that works anywhere and they have a card/selector service that integrates nicely with it. [Paul and Drummond are working on a white paper that describes this grand unification. The OpenID foundation is also exploring unification approaches, so this is all very timely]\n\nWe have begun conversations with OpenID providers on implementing ISAP on their end to allow them to offer selector services\n\nLunch\n\n[15min] Review of Eclipse Release Review Slides [Mary]\n\nMary will send slides to list\n\nWednesday Afternoon\n\n[20 min] Considerations for a multi-protocol ID provider [Uppili]\n\nWhen considering merging of STS and SAML from a Higgins infrastructure perspective, it will be useful to discuss and get some common understanding about what is the ultimate \"functional\" objective. Are there cross-functional use cases in scope for the resulting multi-protocol system, or are we just sharing code between what would be completely independent systems. Would this guide how to approach the same issue if a reference implementation of OpenID were considered as part of Higgins (in future).\n\nLook at the canonical layers of an IDP\n\nAllude about infrastructure building blocks that can be shared\n\nMeditate about some cross-protocol use cases / scenarios (like global sign-out)\n\n( I think this item should be here or somewhere prior to the \"Merging\" discussion, below).\n\n[15 min] Short session on STS IdP / SAML IdP merge/refactoring [Mike]\n\nIn NY we were looking at things that could be reused\n\nWe agree it can be done\n\nTo be continued on Thursday\n\n[15 min] Introduction to Open Identity Network Non-profit [Paul]\n\nSee OIN\n\nSee http://openidentitynetwork.org <-- not \"real\" yet\n\nStatus of incorporation/launch\n\n[30min] Introduction to R-Cards [Paul]\n\nEvolution of i-card definition See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-card\n\nDefinition of r-card.

The IXMLSecurityExtension should be broken into: IXMLSignatureExtension IXMLEncryptionExtension IXMLDecryptionExtension The xmlsecurity.apache should be broken into xmlsignatureextension.apache xmlencryptionextension.apache xmldecryptionextension.apache The xmlsec-1.4.0 (1.4.1) should not be in the redist plugin. It should be in the various xml*extension.apache plugins.
