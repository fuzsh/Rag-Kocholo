        "text": "The Woman of Colour\n\nIN CONTINUATION\n\nIn an elegant morning dishabille, Mrs. Merton reclined on an ottoman: she just made the morning salutation as I entered, and then relapsed again into the intent and important study (as it appeared) of “Bell’s Belle Assembly, or Gallery of Fashion:” a modern periodical publication, where the ladies have coloured specimens of the costume and habits in which they are to array themselves every month. Mr. Merton was reading the newspapers, but he laid them down on seeing me; advanced—took my hand—made particular inquiries after my health—drew a chair for me—and placed himself next me. The urn steamed before her, but the fashionable fair did not notice it, till gently reminded by Mr. Merton with,—“Shall I assist you in putting some water in the tea-pot, Mrs. Merton?”\n\n“Oh, by all means,” said she, yawning, “and make the tea also; for it is a terrible bore!”\n\n“I see you are engaged in an interesting study,” said Mr. Merton; “you ladies employ every opportunity in rendering yourselves, if possible, more irresistible than you were formed by nature!” And the old gentleman very accommodatingly took the tea-chest in his hand.\n\n“You must suffer me to do this, sir,” said I; “I like the office; it is one which I have been accustomed to; and you see I am perfectly disengaged.”\n\n“I yield it with pleasure into abler hands,” said Mr. Merton, bowing gallantly as he resigned it to me.\n\nAugustus now came in, and paid his compliments in a cheerful, unconstrained manner. “So soon put in employ, Miss Fairfield?” said he.\n\n“Oh yes, the lady is of an active turn I find,” said Mrs. Merton, still meditating on the coloured print which she held in her hand.\n\nA servant now entered with a large plate of boiled rice. Mrs. Merton half raised her head, saying—“Set it there,” pointing towards the part of the table where I sat.\n\n“What is this?” asked Mr. Merton.\n\n“Oh, I thought that Miss Fairfield—I understood that people of your—I thought that you almost lived upon rice,” said Mrs. Merton, “and so I ordered some to be got,—for my own part, I never tasted it in my life, I believe!”\n\nMrs. Milbanke, this was evidently meant to mortify your Olivia; it was blending her with the poor negro slaves of the West Indies! It was meant to show her, that, in Mrs. Merton’s idea, there was no distinction between us—you will believe that I could not be wounded at being classed with my brethren!\n\nAugustus coloured, and looked indignantly towards Mrs. Merton: his father tried to palliate, by saying, if I would give him leave, he would help himself to a little of it; while I, perfectly unabashed, and mistress of myself, pretended to take the mischievous officiousness, or impertinence (which you will), of Mrs. Merton in a literal sense; and, turning towards her, said,—“I thank you for studying my palate, but I assure you there is no occasion; I eat just as you do, I believe: and though, in Jamaica, our poor slaves (my brothers and sisters, smiling) are kept upon rice as their chief food, yet they would be glad to exchange it for a little of your nice wheaten bread here;” taking a piece of baked bread in my hand.\n\nThe lady looked rather awkward, I thought, but she was doubly diligent in the study of the fashions; while Augustus offered me the butter, and my father’s smile played round his mouth.\n\nI am confident, that at this moment his countenance expressed approbation of your Olivia. Presently, little George came running into the room, and, without noticing the opened arms of his grandfather, he ran to his mother— “Oh. Mamma! mamma! Look at poor George’s face—that nasty black woman has been kissing me, and dirtying my face all over!”\n\n“Hush, hush!” said Mrs. Merton, pretending to silence the child on my account, while the pleased expression of her countenance could not be misconstrued.\n\n“No, I don’t mean her,” said George pointing at me, “but one much, much dirtier—so very dirty, you can’t think, mamma! Nasty woman, to dirty my face!”\n\n“You must go to your room, George, if you do not hold your tongue directly!”\n\n“Pray do not check him, Mrs. Merton,” said I; “there is something bewitchingly charming in infantine simplicity.—How artless is this little fellow! his lips utter the sentiments of his heart—and those alone!—My love, you will soon lose that beautiful character of your mind, ingenuousness; for it is a sad and melancholy truth, that as we grow older, we grow acquainted with dissimulation.”\n\n“It is too true, indeed!” said Mr. Merton.\n\nAugustus sighed deeply.\n\n“Come hither, my little fellow,” said I, “and I promise I will not kiss you!”\n\n“Why, I should not so much mind if you were to kiss me,” said he; “for your lips are red, and besides, your face is not so very, very dirty.”\n\n“Go to Miss Fairfield, George,” said Augustus.\n\n“With all my heart, uncle!” said he.\n\nI took him on my lap, and holding his hand in mine, I said,—“You see the difference in our hands?”\n\n“Yes, I do, indeed,” said he, shaking his head. “Mine looks clean and yours looks not so very dirty.”\n\n“I am glad it does not look so very dirty,” said I; “but you will be surprised when I tell you that mine is quite as clean as your own, and that the black woman’s below, is as clean as either of them.”\n\n“Oh now, what nonsense you are telling me!” said he, lifting up both his hands in astonishment.\n\n“No,” returned I, “it is very good sense: do you know who made you?”\n\n“My grand-papa said God,” answered he.\n\n“Oh, if you mean that, he is very backward in his catechism,” said Mrs. Merton: “I am sure I could not pretend to teach it to him.”\n\n“So I should imagine, if you think Miss Fairfield put the first question of it to him,” said Augustus, rather sarcastically.\n\n“The same God that made you made me,” continued I—“the poor black woman —the whole world—and every creature in it! A great part of this world is peopled by creatures with skins as black as Dido’s, and as yellow as mine. God chose it should be so, and we cannot make our skins white, any more than you can make yours black.”\n\n“Oh! But I can make mine black if I choose it,” said he, “by rubbing myself with coals.”\n\n“And so can I make mine white by rubbing myself with chalk,” said I; “but both the coal and the chalk would be soon rubbed off again.”\n\n“And won’t yours and hers rub off?” said he.\n\n“Try,” said I, giving him the corner of my handkerchief; and to work the little fellow went with all his might.\n\n“George, you are very rude and troublesome to Miss Fairfield,” said Mr. Merton.\n\n“Not in the least,” said I; “it is right that he should prove the truth of what I have been telling him, he will then believe me another time.”\n\n“Yes, that I shall,” said he, sighing and resigning his employment, as if it had wearied him.\n\n“What do you sigh for, George?” asked Augustus.\n\n“I could wish,” said he, looking at me, “that God had made you white, ma’am, because you are so very good-natured; but I will kiss you, if you like.”\n\n“Thank you for the wish, my dear child, and for the favour conferred upon me,” said I, pressing his cherub lips to mine. “I am not a little proud of this as I consider it a conquest over prejudice!”\n\n“Your arguments are irresistible, you find, Miss Fairfield,” said my uncle, smiling.\n\n“Prejudices imbibed in the nursery are frequently attached to the being of ripened years,” said Augustus; “and to eradicate them as they appear, is a labour well worth the endeavour of the judicious preceptor.”\n\n“Suppose I proceed a little further,” said I, “for at present I have gained but half a victory.—So you still dislike my poor Dido, George?”\n\n“She is very dirty,” said he, again shaking his head; but colouring, he said, “I mean very black.”\n\n“She is a poor negro, you know,” said Mrs. Merton, in a most sneering and contemptuous tone.\n\n“But she is the most faithful of creatures, George,” said I, not deigning to answer his mother, “and I love her dearly!”\n\n“Do you love her dearly?” said he, looking up in my face, with a very scrutinizing expression. “Only think grand-papa, only think uncle, Miss Fairfield says she loves the blackamoor dearly!”\n\n“I dare say she has reason to estimate her,” said Mr. Merton.\n\n“Indeed I have, sir, as your grandson shall hear:—She was born upon my papa’s estate,” said I, addressing my attentive little hearer; “her father and her mother were slaves, or, as you would call them, servants to him.”\n\n“But these black slaves are no better than horses over there,” said George, interrupting me; “for I heard the coachman telling one of the grooms so, in the servants’ hall, last night.”\n\n“You should not go into the servants’ hall, George,” said his grandfather.\n\n“I only went to ask about your black mare, sir,” said the little fellow “you know you told me yourself that she was lame!”\n\nThere was no resisting this sweet and simple apology.\n\n“Well, do not interrupt Miss Fairfield, when she is so good as to talk to you,” said Mr. Merton, smiling significantly at Augustus; for Mrs. Merton now appeared to think the conversation as great a bore as making tea, and, walking to the further part of the room, she was patting her pug dog, and humming a tune at the same time.\n\n“Those black slaves are, by some cruel masters, obliged to work like horses,” said I; “but God Almighty created them men, equal with their masters, if they had the same advantages, and the same blessings of education.”\n\n“But what right have their naughty masters got to make them slave like horses? for I’m sure they can’t like it— I shouldn’t like to work like mamma’s coach-horses, and stand shivering for hours in the wet and cold, as they do.”\n\n“There will be no end of this conversation, if we come to the right and the wrong,” said I.\n\n“It is beginning to wear an interesting form, I think,” said Mr. Merton. “George, we shall have your sentiments on the abolition presently.”\n\n“Miss Fairfield’s rather!” said Mrs. Merton.\n\n“Mine will, I hope, be immediately understood; the feelings of humanity, the principles of my religion, would lead me, as a Christian, I trust, to pray for the extermination of this disgraceful traffic, while kindred claims (for such I must term them) would likewise impel me to be anxious for the emancipation of my more immediate brethren!”\n\n“Born, as you were, in the West Indies, your father a planter, I should have imagined that you would have entertained quite the contrary side of the question,” said Mrs. Merton, who now thought she had found a subject on which to attack me.\n\nI slightly answered, “You did not know my father, madam!”\n\nBut I could not pursue my story with George; something swelled at my throat and I was obliged to leave the room, though little George took my promised vindication of Dido upon trust, and running after me said—“Miss Fairfield, if you are going to Dido, let me go with you.”\n\nI fear I shall tire you, my friend, by this prolix narration, but I was willing to give you a complete surfeit of Mrs. Merton, even though I may frequently be under the necessity of repeating the dose."
