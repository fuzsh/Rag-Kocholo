        "text": "Summary\n\nThe “Second Foundation” by Isaac Asimov has two parts showing the quest and different theories about the location of the Second Foundation.\n\nThe first part focuses on the Mule’s attempt to find and destroy the Second Foundation by dispatching two of his people, Han Pritcher and Bail Channis. They are certain that Tazenda is the planet where the Second Foundation is located. However, the Second Foundation’s Council is aware of their intentions and has already put a plan in place to stop the Mule.\n\nWhen the Mule reunites with his men, he admits that he knew that Channis was actually from the Second Foundation sent to disrupt his plans. He already destroyed Tazenda. But actually, the plan all along was to bring out the Mule in the hands of the people from the Second Foundation, people with similar extraordinary mental capabilities as the Mule.\n\nThe Mule is confronted by the council’s leader, known as The First Speaker, and they engage in a psychological struggle as they attempt to dominate one another. In addition, he discloses that Channis’s knowledge was implanted falsely in order to deceive the Mule, the Second Foundation was not on Tazenda, and that agents are already in motion to undo the conversions of the Mule. When the Mule experiences a moment of despair, the First Speaker seizes control of him and alters his mind; the Mule returns to Kalgan and lives out the rest of his short life as a peaceful despot.\n\nThe second part takes place 60 years after the events that defeated the Mule. One of the consequences of his reign is that people from the Foundation started to research mental sciences, more exactly how to stop any mental control, to make sure the events would not happen again.\n\nWithin the Foundation, a secret cabal is formed to expose and eliminate the Second Foundationers. This decision is prompted by the discovery of evidence indicating the manipulation orchestrated by the Second Foundation, as revealed through mental analysis of key figures within the initial society. They send one of their own, Homir Munn, to search for clues to the Second Foundation’s location. Munn is followed to Kalgan by a teenage girl, Arcadia.\n\nIn Kalgan, a man named Stettin has assumed the Mule’s former title as First Citizen. He believes that the Mule’s actions have made the Seldon Plan irrelevant and declares war upon the Foundation, intending to usurp their role in the formation of the Second Empire. He is not afraid of the possible intervention of the Second Foundation. Arcadia escapes from Kalgan to Trantor with the help of a Trantorian trader named Preem Palver. He also helps her to pass information to her father that she knows the location of the Second Foundation. Kalgan eventually loses the war against the Foundation.\n\nThe Foundation cabal reconvenes to discuss what they’ve learned. There are many theories of the whereabouts of the Second Foundation. Dr. Darel reveals that he and his daughter believe that the Second Foundation is on Terminus among them. Also, he reveals that he has a device capable of hurting people with mental abilities, and by testing it they found out an agent from the Second Foundation right in their group. In the end, the device is used to discover all the people with mental abilities and dispose of them. Afterward, he is relieved that the Second Foundation is gone and that the Foundation is the only one respecting Seldon’s plan and the founders of the Second Empire.\n\nThe Second Foundation is then shown to be both the mastermind of the most recent significant events and to be fully intact. After being enslaved by the Mule, the Foundation’s battle with Kalgan and eventual triumph were intended to boost the former’s self-esteem. Those found on Terminus were martyrs meant to mislead the Foundation into believing they had eliminated the Second Foundation. Arcadia was unknowingly working for the Second Foundation, having been slightly mentally adjusted shortly after her birth to prevent detection. In reality, the Second Foundation is situated on Trantor, the planet that served as the former Galactic Empire’s capital.\n\nReview\n\nThe third novel of the series by Isaac Asimov continues the journey to find the Second Foundation started in the previous novel “Foundation and Empire”. The two parts present many different theories of the location of the mysterious society of people with mental abilities, but in the end, all the theories are wrong.\n\nThe Mule wants to destroy the Second Foundation because the people there are the only ones who pose a threat to his rule. In the end, he was proven right, being defeated by the First Speaker. Over half of century later the people from the Foundation wanted to destroy the Second Foundation because they did not want to have the suspicion that they were mentally manipulated, believing that they alone could follow the Seldon Plan. Again, their actions were already foreseen and another First Speaker put an end to their suspicion with an elaborate plan.\n\nI must admit I enjoyed the first part more than the second because I was very curious about the Mule’s downfall. In the previous novel, the Mule seems to me to be the perfect enemy, I called him “the ultimate unbeatable character” in my review of the novel because since he could control the minds of everyone around him, I could not see how he could be defeated. I was taken by surprise to see that the Mule fell into an easy trap. He did not even need much convincing to believe that the Second Foundation was on the planet Tanzeda. For a man so careful, cunning, and who managed to gain control over an empire just with his mental abilities, it seems to me too far-fetched that he would fall into a trap, and lose a mental battle because he got a little distracted. If he was defeated by one person with greater mental abilities, then I cannot even imagine what all the people from the Second Foundation could do together.\n\nIn the second part of the novel I like the slight reference that even though the people from the Foundation were the most technologically advanced, they still feared the unknown and tried to prevent any other mass mental manipulation. I think that there was also a problem with their ego, they wanted to be the only Foundation.\n\nThe whole journey to find the Second Foundation was confusing and boring for me. The final confrontation in the cabal was much more engaging. I think Asimov specifically chose the most liked man from their group to be one from the Second Foundation. The idea that the two societies could coexist on that planet was mind-blowing, and I honestly believed it, which is why it came as even more of a surprise to learn that the Second Foundation was actually located on Trantor, right in the heart of the dying empire.\n\nOverall, I liked the continued search and different theories of the Second Foundation. I’ll admit that I had assumed their society would be more developed in some aspects. With all of their power, all they did was study the Seldon Plan and keep the indigenous rural populace at a distance. I would have expected them to use their powers to accelerate the advancement of civilizations if the Second Foundation was meant to be both the fulfilment of the First Foundation and a contrast. Verifying that the Foundation is following the correct course in the Seldon Plan appears to be a waste of their abilities. One simple question is why didn’t they foresee and stop the Mule before he took control.\n\nCheck out my reviews for the first two novels of the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov, “Foundation” and “Foundation and Empire”. Check out the TV Show Foundation which is based on this series and now has two seasons. The plot is very different from the books, and if the first season still had some resemblance, at least in the first episodes of the book, the second season is completely different from the plot. But it is still fun to watch.\n\nHappy reading!"
