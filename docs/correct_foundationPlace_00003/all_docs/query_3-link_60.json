        "text": "The Fantasy Review’s list of 9 Science Fiction Books Better Than Foundation by Isaac Asimov, According to Goodreads.\n\nFoundation by Isaac Asimov is the first book in the Foundation series and is a sci-fi classic! It currently has a rating of 4.17, so here is a list of similar books with a higher rating on Goodreads.\n\nIf you want to see how much we love this book, check out our review of Foundation!\n\nThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet (Wayfarers, #1) by Becky Chambers (4.18)\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nRosemary Harper doesn’t expect much when she joins the crew of the aging Wayfarer. While the patched-up ship has seen better days, it offers her a bed, a chance to explore the far-off corners of the galaxy, and most importantly, some distance from her past. An introspective young woman who learned early to keep to herself, she’s never met anyone remotely like the ship’s diverse crew, including Sissix, the exotic reptilian pilot, chatty engineers Kizzy and Jenks who keep the ship running, and Ashby, their noble captain.…\n\nOld Man’s War (Old Man’s War, #1) by John Scalzi (4.23)\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nJohn Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife’s grave. Then he joined the army.\n\nThe good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce―and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding….\n\nPandora’s Star (Commonwealth Saga, #1) by Peter F. Hamilton (4.23)\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nThe year is 2380. The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars, contains more than six hundred worlds interconnected by a web of transport “tunnels” known as wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the impossible: over one thousand light-years away, a star . . . disappears. Since the location is too distant to reach by wormhole, the Second Chance, a faster-than-light starship commanded by Wilson Kime, a five-times-rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a threat.…\n\nHouse of Suns by Alastair Reynolds (4.24)\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nSix million years ago, at the dawn of the star-faring era, Abigail Gentian fractured herself into a thousand male and female clones, which she called shatterlings. She sent them out into the galaxy to observe and document the rise and fall of countless human empires. Since then, every two hundred thousand years, they gather to exchange news and memories of their travels.…\n\nHyperion (Hyperion Cantos, #1) by Dan Simmons (4.25)\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nOn the world called Hyperion, beyond the reach of galactic law, waits a creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all.…\n\nLeviathan Wakes (The Expanse, #1) by James S.A. Corey (4.29)\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nHumanity has colonized the solar system—Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt and beyond—but the stars are still out of our reach.\n\nJim Holden is XO of an ice miner making runs from the rings of Saturn to the mining stations of the Belt. When he and his crew stumble upon a derelict ship, the Scopuli, they find themselves in possession of a secret they never wanted. A secret that someone is willing to kill for—and kill on a scale unfathomable to Jim and his crew. War is brewing in the system unless he can find out who left the ship and why.…\n\nChildren of Time (Children of Time, #1) by Adrian Tchaikovsky (4.30)\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nWho will inherit this new Earth?\n\nThe last remnants of the human race left a dying Earth, desperate to find a new home among the stars. Following in the footsteps of their ancestors, they discover the greatest treasure of the past age — a world terraformed and prepared for human life.\n\nBut all is not right in this new Eden. In the long years since the planet was abandoned, the work of its architects has borne disastrous fruit. The planet is not waiting for them, pristine and unoccupied. New masters have turned it from a refuge into mankind’s worst nightmare….\n\nEnder’s Game (Ender’s Saga, #1) by Orson Scott Card (4.31)\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nIn order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race’s next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew “Ender” Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn’t make the cut―young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.…\n\nDune (Dune, #1) by Frank Herbert (4.31)\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nThe Duke of Atreides has been manoeuvred by his arch-enemy, Baron Harkonnen, into administering the desert planet of Dune. Although it is almost completely without water, Dune is a planet of fabulous wealth, for it is the only source of a drug prized throughout the Galactic Empire. The Duke and his son, Paul, are expecting treachery, and it duly comes – but from a shockingly unexpected place.\n\nThen Paul succeeds his father, and he becomes a catalyst for the native people of Dune, whose knowledge of the ecology of the planet gives them vast power. They have been waiting for a leader like Paul Atreides, a leader who can harness that force…\n\nRelated to: 9 Science Fiction Books Better Than Foundation by Isaac Asimov"
