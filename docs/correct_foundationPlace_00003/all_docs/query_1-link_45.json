        "text": "Editor's note: This article was revised and updated on 9/3/2021.\n\nWhile many Utah-based grantmaking foundations focus their giving on the metropolitan area of Salt Lake City, others have a broader and more statewide approach to giving. One such funder is the Ashton Family Foundation (AFF), which is based in Lindon and awards grants to nonprofits in various communities throughout the state.\n\nTo help you familiarize yourself with this local giver, here are four things to know about the Ashton Family Foundation.\n\n1. AFF is a Low-Key Foundation\n\nUnfortunately for local grantseekers, AFF does not have a website that neatly outlines the foundation’s grantmaking guidelines and deadlines. Instead, much of the information available about this funder comes from tax filings. However, AFF has been on the local giving scene since 1993 and is certainly no newcomer to grantmaking in Utah.\n\n2. AFF has a Tech Background\n\nAFF is the philanthropic foundation of tech industry figure Alan C. Ashton, who co-founded the WordPerfect Corporation and also served on the board of directors of the Novell Corporation. Despite this strong tech connection, however, few AFF grants go to tech-related causes or entrepreneurship.\n\nInstead, Alan Ashton and his wife, Karen, who are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, are guided by their mission to “build the kingdom of God, strengthen the family, safeguard and succor children, administer relief to the poor, needy, widowed and fatherless, prevent disease, malnutrition and hunger, eliminate suffering, promote education, benefit the arts, cultivate an appreciation for God’s creations, and assist and work with other foundations in worthy causes.” The foundation has many trustees (more than 20) onboard, in addition to the Ashton couple.\n\n3. AFF has Four Main Areas of Focus\n\nBased on that mission, grantseekers would be correct to assume that religion is a top focus area for AFF. But not the only focus—other funding interests are education, health, and the arts.\n\nAFF has recently supported Mountainlands Community Health Center, Kids on the Move, and the Timpanogos Storytelling Festival. Most of these grants are in the form of unrestricted general operating support. Grantees have been based in many Utah communities, including Lindon, Cedar City, Provo, Oren, Logan, Midvale, Alpine, West Valley City, American Fork, and Salt Lake City.\n\n4. AFF Welcomes Unsolicited Funding Requests\n\nAlthough public information about AFF is limited, the good news is that this funder is accessible and welcomes local nonprofits to submit grant applications at any time of the year. There are no restrictions or limitations on awards, nor any submission deadlines. Utah nonprofits should simply send in a written request that includes an explanation of the need to the attention of the foundation’s executive director, Dave Harkness, via mail. Foundation giving has exceeded $1 million annually in recent years."
