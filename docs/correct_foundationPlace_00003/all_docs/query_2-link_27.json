        "text": "We are delighted to announce the five regional winners of the 2024 Commonwealth Short Story Prize: Reena Usha Rungoo (Mauritius) for the Africa region, Sanjana Thakur (India) for the Asia region, Julie Bouchard (Canada) for the Canada and Europe region (translated from French into English by Arielle Aaronson), Portia Subran (Trinidad and Tobago) for the Caribbean region, and Pip Robertson (New Zealand) for the Pacific region.\n\nThis year’s prize attracted the highest-ever number of entrants, and the winners were all nominated for the first time. Congratulations to all five writers on this special achievement.\n\nThe winning stories carry readers from a small village in Trinidad to a lonely motel in New Zealand via northern Canada, Mumbai and Mauritius, with themes ranging from love and loss, troubled relationships with parents, and a woman’s love of tea. Two draw upon historical events, the 2023 wildfires in Canada, and the day electricity came to a remote village in Trinidad.\n\nChair of the Judges, Ugandan-British novelist and short story writer Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi says: ‘The short story form has neither the luxury of time nor the comfort of space. It is an impatient form; it does not dance around. The punch of a good short story leaves you breathless. As the judging panel, we enjoyed, sorrowed, celebrated and eventually agreed that these stories came up on top of the different regions.’\n\nThe five regional winners will go through to the final round of judging and the overall winner will be announced on 26 June 2024. Their stories will be published online by the literary magazine Granta, and as an anthology published by Paper + Ink.\n\nRead more about the winning writers below.\n\nPress contact: Ruth Killick publicity@ruthkillick.co.uk\n\nCommonwealth Foundation contact: creatives@commonwealthfoundation.com\n\nThe 2024 Commonwealth Short Story Prize shortlist was announced on 17 April. The 23 writers have been selected by an international judging panel from 7,359 entries in a record-breaking year.\n\nThis year’s shortlist hail from 13 Commonwealth countries. Writers from Mauritius, Rwanda and St Kitts and Nevis feature for the very first time.\n\nMany of the stories are told through the eyes of children—tales of parents splitting up, of school, and of the often baffling behaviour of adults around them. Older characters also appear—sometimes destructive, sometimes inspiring. Five of the stories reflect on motherhood in very different ways. Others tell of forbidden love in a hostile world. Topics range from music, football, art, film, the impact of electricity arriving in a village, and even one woman’s passion for tea. While romance and thrillers feature prominently, nearly a quarter of the shortlisted stories are speculative fiction.\n\nChair of the Judges, Ugandan-British novelist and short story writer Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi says: ‘This is a dream list for lovers of the short story form. You’ll be amazed and thrilled, startled and shocked, and heartbroken and humbled in equal measure by the skill and talent, imagination and creativity.’\n\nDr Anne T. Gallagher AO, Director-General of the Commonwealth Foundation, added: ‘The Short Story Prize is legendary for unearthing and nurturing the rich creative talent of our Commonwealth. This year is no exception. My congratulations to the 23 writers whose stories will now secure a truly global audience.’"
