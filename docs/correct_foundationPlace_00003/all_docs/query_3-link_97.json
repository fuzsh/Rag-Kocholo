        "text": "Warsaw’s largest church, the Temple of Divine Providence, has closed its doors this week after being rented out as a location for the filming of the latest series of Apple TV+’s science fiction show Foundation.\n\nThe management of the church, a concrete-and-copper construction that opened in 2016, say that they decided to cooperate with filmmakers for the first time to help fund the modernisation of the building’s energy system.\n\nThe temple is being used between 4 and 13 April by cast and crew filming the third season of Foundation, an American science fiction show loosely based on Isaac Asimov’s eponymous series of stories.\n\nDuring the period of filming, worshippers wishing to attend mass at the temple can do so in one of its chapels and must inform security staff when they enter the premises. The church authorities have apologised for any inconvenience.\n\nThis week, some locals noticed a large flag with an unusual symbol hanging outside the building amid filming.\n\n“For the first time we decided to cooperate with filmmakers,” said Marek Drabik, a spokesman for the board of the Divine Providence Centre that manages the site, quoted by Catholic press agency KAI. “There are two important reasons behind this.”\n\n“First, the film’s vision corresponds with the depiction of the temple as a place of refuge for people, building community,” he explained.\n\n“Second, thanks to this production it will be possible to finance an important element of the modernisation of our energy infrastructure,” continued Drabik.\n\n“The construction of an energy turbine will significantly reduce the costs of electricity, which is a huge component of the fixed operating costs of the complex.”\n\nThe spokesman added that they are “convinced that this film will show the true beauty of the architecture of the temple”.\n\nSet in the distant future after a catastrophe, Foundation tells the story of a group of outcasts who must rebuild civilisation and save humanity in the face of the collapse of the Galactic Empire.\n\nUntil 7 April, preparations for filming took place in and around the temple. From April 7, fiming began – mainly in the evening and at night – and will last until 13 April. The museum located in the church complex will also be closed to the public from 8 to 10 April.\n\nThe Temple of Divine Providence is the largest church in Warsaw. Its origins datee back to 1791, when the idea for the construction of the church was presented during the session of parliament that adopted Poland’s Constitution of 3 May, which is considered Europe’s first modern, written constitution.\n\nHowever, Poland’s subsequent tumultuous history saw the project repeatedly delayed, with construction only finally beginning in 2003.\n\nNotes from Poland is run by a small editorial team and published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers.
