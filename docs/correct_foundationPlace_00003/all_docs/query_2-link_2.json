        "text": "About Norval Foundation\n\nCelebrate the art and culture of the 20th and 21st centuries when you visit the Norval Foundation, which is particularly nearby for those staying in Cape Town southern suburbs. The Norval Foundation, is situated opposite the Table Mountain National Park in Steenberg, and is perfectly perched to combine a deep love for nature with an appreciation for the power of art. Here, visual art from the 1900s and 2000s that has been created in South Africa and other countries is exhibited for locals and visitors to enjoy.\n\nThe Norval Foundation has various elements that make it extra-special. These include:\n\nA Sculpture Garden\n\nStunning sculptures by artists from all over the African continent await visitors to Norval. These sculptures are scattered through scenic landscaped gardens and in the untouched beauty of the Cape wetlands. Exploring the art isnt just about appreciating the talent of one artist; its about enjoying that talent in the heart of a natural beauty beyond any artists imagination.\n\nThe Homestead Collection\n\nIts no wonder that this is one of the leading South African art exhibitions of the 1900s, because it showcases modern and classic work in novel and intriguing ways. Some of the artists in this collection include Irma Stern, Alexis Preller, Trevor Makhoba, and Cecil Skotnes.\n\nThe Architecture\n\nEven the eco-friendly design of the foundations building has taken the beauty and value of the surrounding fauna and flora into account. The solar plant on the roof and the grey-water purification system work together to reduce the environmental impact that the structure has. In addition, Norval has constructed a toad road, which enables the endangered leopard toad to cross to the other side of the Steenberg road without the threat of being run over."
