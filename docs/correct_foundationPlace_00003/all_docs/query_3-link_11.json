        "text": "New York: Gnome Press, 1951, 1952, 1953. First edition. A beautiful, unrestored first state set of Asimov's Foundation Trilogy. Each book in Fine condition with bright Near Fine or better dust jackets. The third book is inscribed by the author on the front free end paper, \"Best wishes | Isaac Asimov.\" Foundation is Fine with a previous owner's name on the front free end paper in a jacket with trivial rubbing to the front panel and a short scuff on the front flap fold. Foundation and Empire is Fine with a minor bump to the lower edge of the first six pages in a bright jacket with a small tear near the spine fold and gentle rubbing to rear panel. Second Foundation is Fine in a bright, fresh jacket with a few small tears and creasing to lower edge of front panel. All books and jackets with correct first state issue points. The Foundation Trilogy won a special 1966 Hugo award for \"Best All-Time Series\" and brings to life Asimov's futuristic vision of Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. A cornerstone of any science fiction collection, offered here in spectacular, original condition. Additional photos available upon request. Fine in Near Fine dust jacket. (Item #247)"
