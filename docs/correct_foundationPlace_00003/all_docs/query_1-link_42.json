Key Points A coalition of Western U.S. cities and counties awarded $335,000 to four projects designed to fight climate change and reduce wildfire risks by removing carbon dioxide from the air. These projects will convert waste, like forest debris, yard scraps, and biosolids into valuable products, with three of the four projects also reducing local wildfire risk. Experts reviewed proposals and guided the project selection, focusing on their potential to address environmental issues both locally and globally.

        "text": "Albuquerque, NM; Boulder County, CO; Flagstaff, AZ; Salt Lake City, UT; Santa Fe, NM — The 4 Corners Carbon Coalition, a group of cities and counties in the Western U.S., has awarded $335,000 to four projects designed to combat climate change and reduce wildfire risks by sucking carbon from the air. These projects will use the latest carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches to transform organic waste into practical, value-added resources like biochar.\n\nThe 4 Corners Carbon Coalition includes Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boulder County, Colorado; Flagstaff, Arizona; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Salt Lake City, Utah. These governments pool resources to fund CDR projects that spur local economic activity for this growing sector while also addressing regional environmental challenges.\n\nThrough a competitive application process, the coalition received nearly $2.15M in funding requests. After a two-month review period, four organizations were chosen for grants: Bioforcetech Corporation, Carba Inc., Gila WoodNet, and Wood Cache PBC. The selection was made with guidance from a committee that included experts from the Ecological Restoration Institute at Northern Arizona University, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, RMI, and the Yale Carbon Containment Lab.\n\nThis latest funding round supports initiatives that integrate carbon dioxide removal (CDR) into community waste management practices, transforming liability biomass — potentially flammable or dangerous materials such as forest debris, yard waste, and municipal organic waste — into more market-friendly commodities. These projects aim to draw down atmospheric carbon dioxide, the key contributor to climate change, while also demonstrating scalable carbon management strategies, with three of the four projects also mitigating local wildfire risks.\n\nThe liability biomass theme resonated strongly with all coalition communities. The changing climate of the American West is increasing the destructiveness and cost of wildfires. In the past five years, both Colorado and New Mexico have experienced the most destructive fires in their states' histories. The 2021 Marshall Fire tore through Boulder County, Colorado, on New Year’s Eve, destroying 1,000 homes, while the 2022 Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire destroyed more than 903 structures east of Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n“Wildfire prevention is crucial as we address the broader climate crisis,” said Susie Strife, Boulder County director of climate action. “These projects represent a significant step forward, transforming how we manage waste and mitigate risks, and setting a standard that could inspire global change.”\n\n“This year’s focus on liability biomass has sparked some truly groundbreaking ideas,” said Nicole Antonopoulos, City of Flagstaff sustainability director. “Who would have imagined the realm of possibilities for integrating carbon removal with core municipal services like wastewater treatment or landfill operations? The potential impact and scale of these innovations is immense.”\n\n“Managing the Rio Grande Bosque by addressing liability biomass is vitally important to the City of Albuquerque and communities who rely on the benefits of a thriving tree canopy,” said Ann Simon, City of Albuquerque sustainability officer and deputy director of policy. “The innovative projects in this campaign showcase scalable opportunities to mitigate climate change and help the City achieve its Climate Action Plan goals.”"
