        "text": "Foundation Trilogy - Isaac Asimov\n\nThe Foundation books began life as collections of short stories and novellas, published in Astounding Science Fiction, between 1942 and 1949 (see here). I've read these books several times, but the last time was almost a decade ago, so I thought it would be good to revisit the most famous SF series of all. Interestingly, I got new things from them, and it also occurred to me that they are collected in a strange way.\n\nFoundation kicks off the original trilogy, and comprises 4 novelettes from the '40's, with an additional framing introduction added when the book was first published in 1951. The stories are interesting in several ways: they are used by Asimov to provide a space opera scope for some ideas of how war might be avoided, and they also are rather episodic. The first book therefore feels like the fix-up it is. I recalled more occurrences of Seldon appearing during crises, but in fact this only happens twice in the book.\n\nFoundation and Empire, the second book in the trilogy comprises two longer novellas. The first of these is thematically and stylistically like the original stories. It's fine, but not especially engaging compared to what is to come. In some ways, this first story should be collected in the first book, because the second part of Foundation and Empire introduces 'The Mule' - the mutant who can control emotion in others - and is a stylistic advance.\n\nThe Mule is a great invention, and once Asimov gets to this character, we can see that the author has developed a larger story-arc and a broader plan for the books. The plotting becomes deeper and better, and the whole starts to gather pace and interest. Asimov is able to introduce more interesting ideas while also making his galaxy of worlds come to life and gain scale. Interestingly, the first half of the third book, Second Foundation, also features the Mule as the lead character. The second half of 'Empire' and the first half of Second Foundation, would actually make a thematic whole, and might be a better way of collecting these stories.\n\nSecond Foundation is probably the most satisfying of the original trilogy. As well as concluding the Mule story-arc well, it provides an intriguing plot of the Foundation seeking the location of the Second Foundation. Asimov has a fair bit to say about clarity of thought, the value of clearly expressing ideas, and of the dangers of developing 'physical' technologies without developing thought and mental refinement in parallel. Overall, the story arc develops quite nicely across the three books, but the development of plot, breadth of vision and skill in execution clearly develops from the first through the third book. The second part of Foundation and Empire and particularly Second Foundation feel like Asimov classic books, while the earlier stories feel more like 'Early Asimov' in tone and execution.\n\n1950.\n\nThere are 8 novellas, but 1 of them is in 2 instalments and 1 in 3 instalments. Note that these include information which is NOT in the books. Original illustrations - for some but not all, including front cover. Quotes from Ligurn Vier. Summaries at the start of instalments - and at the contents. Which also include information missing in main text.\n\nThese Contents summaries are only in the two 1942 stories - the May one has key extra data, June one seems not to have extra information. From 1944, Contents are just title. The titles are all capitals in both contents and at the start of the story, so there does not seem to be official capitalization.\n\nFoundation. May 1942. Pages 38-53. Illustrated by M. Isip\n\nSo 16 pages, 2 illustrations. In Contents, specified as \"novelette\"\n\nBridle and Saddle. June 1942. Front cover and pages 9-30. Illustrated by Schneeman\n\nSo 22 pages, 1+4 illustrations. In Contents, specified as \"novelette\"\n\nThe Big and the Little. August 1944. Front cover and pages 7-54. Illustrated by Orban\n\nSo 48 pages, 1+6 illustrations. In Contents, specified as \"novelette\"\n\nThe Wedge. October 1944. Pages 64-79 Illustrated by Kramer\n\nSo 16 pages, 3 illustrations. In Contents, specified as \"short story\"\n\nDead Hand. April 1945. Front cover and pages 6-60. Illustrated by Orban\n\nSo 55 pages, 1+4 illustrations. In Contents, specified as \"novelette\"\n\nThe Mule. 2 instalments: November 1945. Front cover and pages 7-53, 139-144. Illustrated by Orban. December 1945. Pages 60-97, 148-168. Illustrated by Orban\n\nSo 47+6+38+21=112 pages, 1+5+1+3+3 illustrations. In Contents, specified as \"serial\"\n\nNow you see it. January 1948. Front cover and pages 7-61 Illustrated by Rogers\n\nSo 55 pages, 1+6 illustrations. In Contents, specified as \"novelette\"\n\n...And now you don´t. 3 instalments: November 1949. Front cover and pages 5-40. Illustrated by Rogers. December 1949. Pages 120-161. Illustrated by Rogers. January 1950. Pages 111-152. Illustrated by Rogers.\n\nSo 36+42+42=120 pages, 1+4+4+4 illustrations. In Contents, specified as \"serial\".\n\nIn total, 1 short story of 16 pages, 5 novelettes from also 16 to 55 pages, and 2 serials from 112 to 120 pages.

The second part of Foundation and Empire and particularly Second Foundation feel like Asimov classic books, while the earlier stories feel more like 'Early Asimov' in tone and execution.\n\nThe Foundation Trilogy is one of my go-to books. I've re-read the series countless times. Often I'll pick it up and start reading from a random page.\n\nI disagree with Bick's assertions regarding the Mule. To my read of the trilogy The Mule is a cop-out.\n\nThe trilogy starts with an assertion that individual actions while they appear heroic, and often are heroic, are also simply minutiae in the arc of human history. Large groups of people will act in particular ways as a matter of psycho-historic force. Asimov's meditation on how a failing empire is replaced with a new dynamic empire as a matter of inevitable psycho-history was and still is a revelation.\n\nThe Mule throws everything out to tell us that psycho-history is true only when there isn't an exceptional individual to take control. So maybe Salvor Hardin or Hober Mallow were in fact superhumans misrepresented in the story. That, but for their unique contributions, the Foundation may have indeed collapsed.\n\nThe reversal of the base theme of the story personified by the Mule is not a triumph from where I sit. The end of the story where Asimov tells us that, in fact, psycho-history was always a sham; Instead the 2nd Foundation ran a secret cabal pulling strings both on Trantor and on Terminus itself. This saddens me every time I read it. -The invisible hand of Hari Seldon indeed!\n\nI disagree with Bick's assertions regarding the Mule. To my read of the trilogy The Mule is a cop-out.\n\nThe trilogy starts with an assertion that individual actions while they appear heroic, and often are heroic, are also simply minutiae in the arc of human history. Large groups of people will act in particular ways as a matter of psycho-historic force. Asimov's meditation on how a failing empire is replaced with a new dynamic empire as a matter of inevitable psycho-history was and still is a revelation.\n\nThe Mule throws everything out to tell us that psycho-history is true only when there isn't an exceptional individual to take control. So maybe Salvor Hardin or Hober Mallow were in fact superhumans misrepresented in the story.\n\nNo.\n\nThe stated premise of psychohistory is that large groups of people act in statistically predictable ways - even in hierarchical, unequal organizations. This is tantamount to a claim that \"leaders\" are always figureheads, with, in long view, negligible freedom of action. They follow the public opinion of the broader elites of their society - if they are stupid and attempt to go against public opinion, they are replaced and the flow goes on, if they are smart, they find out the public opinion (whether by formal vote, or listening to people and having good agents/henchmen to listen to) and follow it - what the government ends up accomplishing is closely enough the same regardless.\n\nNow, does Foundation show it to be the case?\n\nOnly \"Dead Hand\" comes close.\n\nAnd now compare and contrast Fourth Crisis with First.\n\nIn both cases, Foundation is confronted by what appears to be an overwhelming force.\n\nIn the last line of Foundation, Hardin says the solution was obvious. Asimov later confessed he did not know it then.\n\nThe solution, in both cases, was that the force was actually not united. The threat of one faction conquering Foundation ended up mobilizing the other faction/s.\n\nIn Fourth Crisis, the solution is emphatically psychohistorical. Cleon does NOT need official Foundation leader telling him that Bel Riose and Ammel Brodrig collecting a united navy is threat of plotting a revolt. When Lathan Devers tries to say so as a private person, he does not get Cleon´s ear - but Cleon on his own account decides to do what Lathan was trying to ask him for.\n\nThat, but for their unique contributions, the Foundation may have indeed collapsed.\n\nObvious contrast of the First Crisis against Fourth. Since Asimov wrote Foundation without knowing the obvious solution (and it is obvious even on rereading), see from Bridle and Saddle:\n\nWhat I did, instead, was to visit the three other kingdoms, one by one; point out to each that to allow the secret of atomic power to fall into the hands of Anacreon was the quickest way of cutting their own throats; and suggest gently that they do the obvious thing. That was all. One month after the Anacreonian force had landed on Terminus, their king received a joint ultimatum from his three neighbors. In seven days, the last Anacreonian was off Terminus.\n\nHardin claims that the solution had been obvious to him since Anselm haut Rodric´s visit revealing Anacreon´s lack of atomic power. Yet in page 48, we hear Hardin conclude:\n\n“It turned out that we didn’t have much time after all — only three months. But little as it was, we threw it away unused. This thing here gives us a week. What do we do now?”\n\n\"We\"?\n\nThe alliance of Three Kingdoms against Anacreon was NOT a psychohistorical inevitability like action of Cleon against Bel Riose. Because, as we see on the visit of Anselm haut Rodric, Anacreon was ignorant of atomic power on Terminus until Salvor told him. The inference is that Smyrno, Loris and Konom and Daribow were also ignorant of atomic power on Terminus - and they stayed ignorant till Hardin travelled to inform them.\n\nUntil and unless they were informed, they viewed Terminus as another sparsely settled marginal planet - and were not eager to fight to contest Anacreon´s share.\n\nAnd now realize that if there was no psychohistorical inevitability in the Three Kingdoms acting to bail out Foundation, because they were ignorant and would have stayed so but for one well-informed person going out of his way to inform them...\n\nHardin might have made that round trip of Three Kingdoms three months sooner, and seeing how it had effect in a month (plus seven days), this would have averted the Anacreonians ever landing on Terminus.\n\nOr else Hardin might have failed. For example, he might have been arrested by Anacreonians. His coup against the legitimate Pirenne government would have given them a good excuse... and it would have been all over with Seldon Plan.\n\nThe reversal of the base theme of the story personified by the Mule is not a triumph from where I sit. The end of the story where Asimov tells us that, in fact, psycho-history was always a sham; Instead the 2nd Foundation ran a secret cabal pulling strings both on Trantor and on Terminus itself. This saddens me every time I read it. -The invisible hand of Hari Seldon indeed!"
