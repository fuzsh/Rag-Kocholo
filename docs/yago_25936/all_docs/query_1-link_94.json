        "text": "Biography\n\nPallete was born as the daughter of a Peruvian senator in the Paita Port (northern Peru). She married and divorced professional big-game hunter Richard Weldy. She met John Wayne, 21 years her senior, in Lima, Peru, in 1953, while still married to Weldy. Wayne was in Peru scouting locations for The Alamo.\n\nIn 1953, Pallete came to Los Angeles to dub a film in English, when she ran into John Wayne for the second time. A year later on November 1, 1954, they married in Kona, Hawaii, the same day Wayne's divorce became final. Pallete retired from her motion picture career to be a wife and mother to their three children: Aissa, Ethan, and Marisa.\n\nDuring the next 10 years of their marriage, they traveled extensively, usually on location for John Wayne's many films. In 1965, they moved to Newport Beach, California. She rented a studio inside the Fernleaf Courtyard, in Corona Del Mar, California, where she would entertain her clients outdoors with coffee and finger sandwiches and found herself, one year later, with a full-time restaurant.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1973, she and Wayne separated, and he died from stomach cancer on June 11, 1979. 11 years later, in 1984, she married Stephen Stewart, a municipal court judge. The marriage was brief, with Pallete later describing the relationship as a \"two-week mistake.\" In 1998, Pallete married Jesse Upchurch, a travel company executive.\n\nFilmography\n\nThe Alamo - unknown (uncredited) (1960)\n\nHollywood Greats - episode - \"John Wayne\" - herself (1984)\n\nJohn Wayne Standing Tall - TV movie/documentary - herself (1989)\n\nBiography - episode - \"John Wayne: The Unquiet Man\" - herself (1998)\n\nBiography - episode - \"John Wayne: American Legend\" - herself (1998)\n\nThe Duke at Fox - documentary short - herself (2011)"
