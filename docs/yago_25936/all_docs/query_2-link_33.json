Comes into us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday.\" His grave overlooks the Pacific Ocean, where Wayne spent many weekends sailing and fishing.[13]\n\nIn June 1999, the American Film Institute named John Wayne the 13th Greatest Male Screen Legend of All Time.[14] Posthumously, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[2] John's legacy also lies in the work he did to influence the US support of the Panama Canal Treaties.[2] Most notably, John lives on in the John Wayne Cancer Foundation, created in 1985.[2]\n\nOriginally named Orange County Airport, the Orange County California Board of Supervisors renamed the airport in 1979 in honor of actor John Wayne, who lived in neighboring Newport Beach and died that year. A bronze statue of John Wayne was installed at the airline terminal in 1982.[15]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Wikipedia: John Wayne\n\n↑ 2.00 2.01 2.02 2.03 2.04 2.05 2.06 2.07 2.08 2.09 2.10 2.11 2.12 2.13 2.14 2.15 2.16 2.17 Official John Wayne website biography, accessed Mar 4 2021\n\n↑ \"Iowa, County Births, 1880-1935,\" index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/VJPG-ZWP : accessed 11 Jun 2014), Marion Robert Morrison, 26 May 1907; citing , Winterset, Madison, Iowa, United States; FHL microfilm 1028195.\n\n↑ \"Iowa, Births and Christenings, 1830-1950,\" index, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/XV4N-PNP : accessed 11 Jun 2014), Marion Robert Morrison, ; citing Winterset, Iowa; FHL microfilm 1682887.\n\n↑ US Federal Census; Year: 1910; Census Place: Madison, Madison, Iowa; Roll: T624_412; Page: 2B; Enumeration District: 0031; FHL microfilm: 1374425.
