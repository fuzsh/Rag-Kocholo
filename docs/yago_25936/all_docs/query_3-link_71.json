        "text": "John Wayne is arguably the most iconic name in American film - more than an actor, he was a national treasure. Now the Wayne Family is sharing the star's personal letters, telegrams, cards and never-before seen photos in Duke: In His Own Words, published by Media Lab Books.\n\n'The guy you see on the screen isn't really me,' said Wayne. I'm Duke Morrison, and I never was and never will be a film personality like John Wayne. I know him well. I'm one of his closest students. I have to be I made a living out of him.\n\n'I've found the character the average man wants himself, his brother or his kid to be. It's the same type of guy the average wife wants for her husband'.\n\nDaily Mail Online was provided these exclusive photos and letters from The John Wayne Archives to share with its readers.\n\nBorn Marion Robert Morrison on May 26, 1907 in Winterset, Iowa, he was the father of seven children, with an age gap of more than thirty years. He showered his kids with lavish gifts but made sure they knew the value of hard work.\n\nHe had three wives, multiple affairs, palled around with Ward Bond and Frank Sinatra - and was never one to shy away from offering up advice to the President of the United States.\n\n'Duke', 'Everlovin', or just 'Dad' to his family and friends was born in the Midwest but soon resettled in southern California with his family to accommodate his own father's lung condition.\n\nIt was the move westward that introduced the rugged 6'4' man's - and woman's - man to the Hollywood movie studios.\n\nHe had lost his football scholarship to the University of Southern California after a body surfing accident. He actually never scored a touchdown.\n\nWith no funds for school, he left and went on to be a prop boy and extra in movies in the 1920s.\n\nCome 1930, he was given his first starring role in The Big Trail and that's when the screen name John Wayne came to life. He moved on to star in westerns that eventually translated into box office gold for five decades until his death on June 11, 1979.\n\nWayne died of stomach cancer at the age of 72.\n\nBut he left behind a legacy with his seven kids. Wayne was married three times - all Latina women.\n\nHis first wife Josephine Saenz was the daughter of a Panamanian consul in Los Angeles.\n\nInstead of spending time with her he was often socializing with his film buddies leaving Josephine alone and unhappy.\n\nIn their 12 years together they had four children – Michael, Toni, Patrick and Melinda.\n\nHis second wife was a 'hot tamale who drank like a fish'. Wayne met Esperenza Bauer Diaz while vacationing in Mexico City. Nicknamed 'Chata', Diaz was a bit film actress and full time call girl to the stars.\n\nThey had no children together in their eight years of marriage. Wayne went on to declare it the biggest mistake of his life because they fought so much.\n\nThe all-American cowboy's third and longest marriage was with Pilar Weldy, lasting 17 years. They met in 1953 in Lima, Peru while he was scouting locations for the film, The Alamo.\n\nThe daughter of a Peruvian politician, she was twenty-two years younger than Wayne and was the mother of his youngest three children: Aissa, John Ethan and Marisa Carmella.\n\n'I'm a demonstrative man, a baby picker-upper, a hugger and a kisser—that's my nature'.\n\n'He was just a regular dad', said Melinda from his first marriage to Josephine Saenz.\n\n'He had a wonderful sense of humor but was adamant about school and always said that education was the key to life'."
