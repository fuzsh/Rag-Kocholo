        "text": "There is already an interesting thread on Gail Russell, but it is closed and that's why i decided to put on some details with a new one.\n\nShe was named 'The Hedy Lamarr of Santa Monica'. Born in Chicago, Illinois, Gail was raised mostly in Michigan on her uncle's farm. Her mother wanted to be famous but didn't have the necessary talent, so she channeled her energies into her daughter. Gail was a skillful artist and a very shy child who adored Ginger Rogers. When Gale was 12, the family moved to California and she went to school with Jane Russell who, although not related, became a close friend.\n\nHer first film was 'Henry Aldrich Gets Glamour' (1943) as high school femme fatale, Virginia Lowry. The studio arranged dates for Gail. She was cast opposite her idol Ginger Rogers in 'Lady in the Dark' (1944), but Gail was so nervous it took nearly two days to shoot her two lines of dialogue. Nevertheless, she and Ginger Rogers became friends and the elder actress took a keen interest in the younger. 'The Uninvited' (1944), in which she played Stella Meredith, established Gail as a film star, although again she suffered from stage fright and that led to a nervous breakdown.\n\nIn 1949 Gail and Guy Madison went on a month-long holiday to get to know each other better and visit her relatives. On August 3, they married at the Biltmore Hotel in Santa Barbara. Gill's mother, father and brother were notable by their absence from the ceremony.\n\nJoseph Losey's 'The Lawless' (1950) was her last film at Paramount. Losey later recalled Gail being absolutely terrified on set and unable to deliver a single line without a drink; once a drink arrived, she was word-perfect. During the shooting of her movies, she was lonely (Madison was unable to visit her, because of his own busy workload...), depressed, tired and drinking. Back in her hotel room after shooting, she was drink herself into oblivion. Gail and Madison separated and then in 1953 Gail was named as co-respondent by John Wayne's estranged wife, Esperanza Baur. Gail and Madison reconciled, but it was never a love match. She entered a sanatorium in Seattle, Washington, to try and recover, but in November 1953 she was arrested for drink-driving. Madison bailed her out, but on October 6, 1954 they were divorced.\n\nGail continued to appear in films, but she put on weight and lost much of her beauty due to drink. In 1957, she began a two-year lesbian relationship with singer Dorothy Shay. In the summer of that year, she was again arrested for drink-driving, when she crashed her car through a shop window, pinning a man under the from wheels. She was sentenced to 30 days in prison suspended, fined $420 and put on probation for three years.\n\nOn August 27, 1961, she was discovered dead, surrounded by empty vodka bottles in her home, at the age of 36. Gail had died some time between August 24 and 26. Cause of death: alcoholism and cirrhosis of the liver. She was also found to have been suffering from malnutrition at the time of her death.\n\nGlancing at a review of FALLEN STAR A BIOGRAPHY OF GAIL RUSSELL....\n\nMr. Ochoa does not delve deeply into the dark shadows of Gail’s life, such as alleged “casting couches” used by the “Studio SOB’s who took advantage of this beautiful young girl”, as cursed by a very angry John Wayne.\n\nOne heartwarming photo of many that touched me was of a delighted, happy Gail laughing with John Wayne, as he leaned in close to her and joked with her about who had the bluest eyes while on the set of Wake Of The Red Witch . Adele Mara, playing Gail’s niece in Wake Of The Red Witch , had observed that the very shy, socially reclusive Gail would not talk to anyone on set except for John Wayne. A year earlier, while working for John Wayne Productions on Angel And The Badman , John Wayne had taken such good care of Gail, spending a lot of time with her personally ensuring no alcohol, good healthy food to eat, touring sites and ensuring that Gail was not socially isolated, that 21 year old Gail had developed a serious crush on the 39 year old, but married Wayne. Wayne grew very attached to Gail too, but kept his deep affection for her fatherly. The sweet photo clearly demonstrates Wayne’s extremely positive effect on the very shy, insecure Gail."
