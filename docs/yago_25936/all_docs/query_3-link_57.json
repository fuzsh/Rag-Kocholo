        "text": "John Wayne Smith, age 75, of Gold Hill, died October 1, 2022 at Asante Three Rivers Medical Center.\n\nJohn was born and raised in Grants Pass, and graduated from Grants Pass High School in 1965. He then enlisted in the United States Army and spent time in Germany.\n\nIn 1971 he married Jolene Peck in Grants Pass, and had two daughters, Rhonda and Renee. At this time, he worked in the woods as a logger. In 1986 he moved from LaBarge, Wyoming to Gold Hill.\n\nAfter a divorce, he married Susan Cox on June 7, 1991 in Sparks, Nevada. He continued his work in logging employed by Ollie Woolsey and John R. Wood. After his retirement from logging and driving truck, he worked for Southern Oregon Underground and Johnny Cat, Inc as a rock truck driver. He spent several years with these companies, retiring in 2010.\n\nJohn was a founding member of the Caveman 4-Wheelers Club which started in 1973. His hobbies were woodworking; taking care of his property; repairing things; and working on his vehicles. His pride and joy was his ‘59 Chevy and his Tracker which he had for the 4-Wheel Club.\n\nJohn also enjoyed camping and traveling in Oregon, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, making many trips to visit his relatives. John also spent one winter in Yuma, Arizona and had a lot of fun. He loved spending time with his kids, grandkids, and friends in his garage along with his dogs Sammy, Angel and Kassi.\n\nJohn loved to help anyone who needed it. He was so kind and considerate to everyone; he never met anyone who wasn’t a friend.\n\nJohn is survived by his wife Susan Cox-Smith of Gold Hill; sister Delores Kimball of Evanston, Wyoming, daughters Rhonda Stillwell of Central Point and Renee Smith of Brush Prairie, Washington; son-in-law Neal Stillwell of Athens, Texas and daughter Kerry Klein of Medford; granddaughter Ariel Stillwell; grandsons Justin Smith, Kenny Cox and Marcus Kinion; and many cousins and other relatives.\n\nJohn was preceded in death by his parents Paul and Vivian Smith of Marbleton, Wyoming; Jolene McNally of Washougal, Washington; stepchildren Debra Swing and Dean Cox and several aunts, uncles and cousins."
