        "text": "Community Information\n\nLa Grange Highlands Civic Association\n\nLyons Township, Cook County, IL, USA\n\nThe La Grange Highlands is an unincorporated residential community located immediately south of the Village of La Grange and west of the City of Countryside. It is in Lyons Township, Cook County, IL. The Highlands covers an area of about 600 acres. It is one of the largest unincorporated areas in Cook County. The community received its name \"Highlands\" because of its high elevation. It is 690 ft. above sea level, 90 feet higher than Chicago's loop, and 20 ft. higher than the Village of La Grange. Most of the land in the area is developed. Highlands' homes are predominately situated on half acre lots and there are very few parcels of vacant lot remaining.\n\nThe association encourages residents to be good neighbors by observing zoning ordinances, street signs, and speed limits in the area, and as always, controlling their pets.\n\nSustainability Information\n\nPUBLIC SAFETY\n\nThe Cook County Sheriff is responsible for the La Grange Highlands.\n\nLOCAL SCHOOLS\n\nLa Grange Highlands School District 106\n\nwww.district106.net\n\nAdministration â 1750 W.

Branches should not exceed 4 inches in diameter, and should be put on the parkway, not protruding into the street, in an orderly fashion, with butt ends facing the street. Be sure that no other items are included in the branches, as these can result in injuries to the crew members or damage to equipment. Branch pick up is a service to our community, and should not include trees that have been cut down by professional tree services. Branch pickup begins mid-April (weather permitting) and ends after the first snow.Â For questions, call the Highway Department @ 708-839-0051.\n\nLa Grange Highlands Sanitary District.\n\nPlease click here to see a document from the La Grange Highlands Sanitary District with information regarding the La Grange Highlands resident’s concerns of chlorine in the water as well as their testing procedures.Â\n\nLa Grange Highlands Women's Club (lghighlandsclub.org)\n\nThe LaGrange Highlands Women’s Club has been doing great things in our community since 1946. The objective of the club is to further the social, charitable, and civic interests of the community. Each year we sponsor a local charity, and through enjoyable fundraising events we are able to contribute substantially to the welfare of our community.\n\nMembership is open to all women living within the School District 106 boundaries.Â Meetings are normally held the first Tuesday of each month at 7:00 p.m. in the community room at the Highlands Presbyterian Church. Â Questions can be directed toÂ lghighlandsclub@gmail.com.\n\nThanks to Marty Stulp, LGHCCA Board member, over 26 neighborhood watch signs have been personally purchased and installed by him (see map below for locations).Â These are simple reminders that we keep an eye out for the safety of our neighbors."
