Some are brief, others more in depth. It all depends on the available sources for each.\n\nTroup County Georgia Land Records\n\nThe land lots were distributed by lottery to the citizens of other older counties, and nearly all of the whole lots were so distributed. The whole lots contained 202½ acres. The undistributed lots and the fractional lots were sold by the state afterwards, some as late as 1850.
