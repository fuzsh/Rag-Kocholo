        "text": "LaGrange was named for the estate of French and American hero General Marquis de Lafayette, whose extensive travels brought him through this lovely, west Georgia enclave. During one of his visits to Georgia, General Lafayette is said to have commented to Governor Troup that the landscape here reminded him of his own estate in France. Adding a touch of French flair to the former Creek lands, the townsfolk chose LaGrange as the name most fitting for this new city destined for success.\n\nFrom memorable stage productions to ballet and musical events put on by the Lafayette Society for Performing Arts, to visual arts at the LaGrange Art Museum, there are cultural experiences for every age and interest in LaGrange."
