        "text": "CHAPTER XXVII. OFFICIALS AND OLD CITIZENS OF TROUP COUNTY\n\nTHE following alphabetical list of names was secured from many different sources, one of which was that of the county records, another from the inscriptions found in the cemeteries of the county, and another from individual family records. Those secured from the cemeteries include only the names of mature persons, who were born prior to 1850. Many tombs were unmarked and a few were indecipherable.\n\nThe list of the cemeteries visited may be found in the pages preceding this chapter of the history. There are, perhaps, some of them omitted, but if that is true, the citizens of the community are unaware of their existence, and when discovered may be added to this list of county officials and old citizens by some future compiler of records.\n\nThe name of every Troup County citizen, who has held office in the national, or in the state legislative bodies, is included up to the year 1933. The mayors and city clerks are the only municipal officers in the list. The county officers are all included with the exception of the County Treasurer. The names of some of the county surveyors, coroners, tax receivers, and tax collectors, do not appear in the public records prior to 1884, after which year the oaths of office for county officers were recorded in the minutes of the Court of Ordinary.\n\nIt is suggested that some county officer be constituted the recipient of such missing data for the use of a future compilation, and that an annual summary of events be so recorded.\n\nRoster\n\nAbraham, Anderson D.ï¿½b. in Newnan Apr. 26, 1831; d.
