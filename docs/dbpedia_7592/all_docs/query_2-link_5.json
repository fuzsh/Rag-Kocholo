        "text": "For the ghost town in Tippecanoe County, see LaGrange, Tippecanoe County, Indiana.\n\nTown in Indiana, United States\n\nLaGrange is a town in and the county seat of LaGrange County, Indiana, United States.[4] The population was 2,625 at the 2010 census.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nLaGrange was laid out and platted in 1836.[5] It took its name from LaGrange County.[6]\n\nLaGrange County's initial settlers were Yankee immigrants, that is to say they were from New England and were descended from the English Puritans who settled that region in the colonial era. They were part of a wave of New England settlers moving west into what was then the Northwest Territory after the completion of the Erie Canal. The original settlers in LaGrange County specifically hailed from the Massachusetts counties of Worcester County, Suffolk County and Berkshire County; the Connecticut counties of Hartford County and Windham County as well as the Connecticut towns of Sherman, Lebanon and Fairfield; and from the Vermont towns of Burlington, Brookfield, Huntington and Grand Isle. They were mainly members of the Congregational Church, but as a result of the Second Great Awakening many became Baptists and many also converted to Pentecostalism and Methodism. When they arrived in what is now LaGrange County, there was nothing but virgin forest and wild prairie, the New England settlers cleared roads, built farms, constructed churches, erected government buildings, and established post routes. As a result of this migration, LaGrange County was culturally continuous with early New England culture for many years.[7]\n\nThe LaGrange County Courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.[8] The courthouse and the annual fall festival are featured in the 1941 New Deal era post office mural painted by Jessie Hull Mayer. She won the federal commission to paint Corn School as part of the Section of Painting and Sculpture′s projects, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.[9]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, LaGrange has a total area of 1.7 square miles (4.40 km2), all land.[10]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1860650—18701,03859.7%18801,36731.7%18901,78430.5%19001,703−4.5%19101,7724.1%19201,610−9.1%19301,6401.9%19401,81410.6%19501,8924.3%19601,9905.2%19702,0533.2%19802,1645.4%19902,38210.1%20002,91922.5%20102,625−10.1%20202,7153.4%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the census[12] of 2020, there were 2,715 people, 1,143 households, and 687 families living in the town.\n\n2010 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the census[13] of 2010, there were 2,625 people, 1,041 households, and 637 families living in the town.
