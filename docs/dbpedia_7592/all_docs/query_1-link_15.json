        "text": "Troup County (pronounced troop) is a county located in the west central portion of the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2020 census, the population was 69,426. The county seat is LaGrange.\n\nTroup County comprises the LaGrange micropolitan statistical area along with Chambers County, AL. It is included in the Atlanta-Athens-Clarke County-Sandy Springs combined statistical area.\n\nHistory\n\nFor thousands of years, this area of what is now defined as west central Georgia was occupied by cultures of indigenous peoples. In the historic period, it was controlled by the Creek people.\n\nThe land for Lee, Muscogee, Troup, Coweta, and Carroll counties was ceded by the Creek to the United States in the 1825 Treaty of Indian Springs. The counties' boundaries were created by the Georgia General Assembly on June 9, 1826, but they were not named until December 14, 1826.\n\nThe county is named for George Troup, thirty-fourth governor of Georgia, U.S. representative, and senator.\n\nAs with much of the Piedmont, this area was developed in the antebellum era for cotton cultivation. By 1860 Troup County was the fourth-wealthiest in Georgia and fifth-largest slaveholding county in the state.\n\nAccording to U.S. Census data, the 1860 Troup County population included 6,223 whites, 37 \"free colored\" and 10,002 slaves. By the 1870 census, the white population had increased about 3% to 6,408, while the \"colored\" population had increased about 12% to 11,224.\n\nIn the late 19th century, entrepreneurs in LaGrange built the first cotton mill, and others were rapidly established in this area. Initially they employed only white workers. Textile manufacturing was a major part of the economy until the late 20th century, when textile manufacturing moved offshore to areas with cheaper labor.\n\n20th century to present\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, thousands of blacks left Georgia and other southern states in what is known as the Great Migration. They were seeking work as mechanization reduced the number of farm jobs, and they were seeking more opportunities than in the Jim Crow South, where they were disenfranchised and socially suppressed.\n\nOn September 8, 1940, 16-year-old Austin Callaway, a black youth, was arrested in LaGrange as a suspect in an attack on a white woman. The next night a small, armed group of white men took him from the county jail, driving him out to the nearby countryside, where they lynched him.\n\nBy 1960, the county was recorded in the US Census as having 31,418 whites and 15,760 \"Negroes\" (or blacks, African Americans). Following passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, blacks gradually regained the ability to vote and take part in the political process.\n\nAs of 2015, the official historian of Troup County is writer Forrest Clark Johnson, III, who has published several books on the county and region's history. He is a retired former teacher in the county's school system.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 446 square miles (1,160 km2), of which 414 square miles (1,070 km2) is land and 32 square miles (83 km2) (7.2%) is water.\n\nThe entirety of Troup County is located in the Middle Chattahoochee River-Lake Harding sub-basin of the ACF River Basin (Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin).\n\nMajor highways\n\nAdjacent counties\n\nCoweta County (northeast)\n\nMeriwether County (east)\n\nHarris County (south)\n\nChambers County, Alabama (southwest/CST Border except for Lanett and Valley as they are part of the Columbus Metropolitan Area)\n\nRandolph County, Alabama (northwest/CST Border)\n\nHeard County (north)\n\nCommunities\n\nHarrisonville\n\nHogansville\n\nLaGrange\n\nLong Cane\n\nMountville\n\nWest Point\n\nWoodfield\n\nGray Hill\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1830 5,799 — 1840 15,733 171.3% 1850 16,879 7.3% 1860 16,262 −3.7% 1870 17,632 8.4% 1880 20,565 16.6% 1890 20,723 0.8% 1900 24,002 15.8% 1910 26,228 9.3% 1920 36,097 37.6% 1930 36,752 1.8% 1940 43,879 19.4% 1950 49,841 13.6% 1960 47,189 −5.3% 1970 44,466 −5.8% 1980 50,003 12.5% 1990 55,536 11.1% 2000 58,779 5.8% 2010 67,044 14.1% 2020 69,426 3.6% 2023 (est.) 70,742 5.5% U.S. Decennial Census\n\n1790-1880 1890-1910\n\n1920-1930 1930-1940\n\n1940-1950 1960-1980\n\n1980-2000 2010\n\nTroup County racial composition as of 2020 Race Num.
