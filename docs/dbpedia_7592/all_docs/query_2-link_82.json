        "text": "The town here is actually very cozy. It has a nice mix of casual and fancy restaurants as well as some neat stores to buy clothes or other trinkets. What makes it even better is that it's only and thirty-minute train ride to Chicago city! However, the town has its fair share of rude people and the taxes everyone has to pay to keep their houses or restaurants can make you queasy sometimes. I believe that there is no immediate solution to this. It may be unfortunate but the small town of La Grange may only be for those who can afford it."
