LaGrange, city, seat (1828) of Troup county, western Georgia, U.S. It lies just east of West Point Lake (impounded on the Chattahoochee River), about 50 miles (80 km) north of Columbus. The site was settled in 1826, and the town soon developed as an important trading centre in a cotton-growing area; it was named for the French estate of the Marquis de Lafayette, who had visited the area in 1825. The city was largely spared during the American Civil War when a women’s militia confronted and persuaded a Union force not to destroy the town (April 1865). In 2000 it became the first U.S. city to offer Internet access as a municipal utility.

Rubber and plastic products, medical supplies, and a mix of other light manufacturing helped to diversify the economy, long dependent on the textile industry, in the 1960s and ’70s; since 1990 the focus has been on technology-based companies. Tourism is also important. The Lamar Dodd Art Center and the Bellevue mansion—one of the finest examples of Greek Revival architecture in the state and now a national landmark—are popular attractions. Warm Springs, Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park, and the Callaway Gardens are among several nearby recreational facilities. LaGrange College, the state’s oldest independent accredited four-year liberal arts school, was founded in 1831. Quartz is mined in the vicinity. Inc. town, 1828; city, 1856. Pop.
