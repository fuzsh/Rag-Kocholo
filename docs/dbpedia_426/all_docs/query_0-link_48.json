        "text": "News December 21, 2023\n\nOscars Short Films 2024: The Titles Battling for an Academy Award\n\nAs the Academy Awards approach their centenary, it’s worth noting that short films have played a role in the ceremony almost since its inception. While for the press the spotlight often gravitates toward the feature categories, for those immersed in the world of short films the announcement of the shortlists remains a highlight during awards seasons.\n\nToday (Thu 21st Dec 2023) sees the launch of that 45-film list – with 15 short films contending for the top prize in each of the Best Animated Short, Best Documentary Short, and Best Live Action Short categories. Over on Shortverse, we’ve put together a filterable collection of the films and although not every film is currently available to view online, with nominations voting coming soon (January 11-16), we expect most of the films to pop up online over the coming weeks. Check back and we’ll keep this list updated.\n\nBest Animated Short\n\nBoom directed by Gabriel Augerai, Romain Augier, Charles Di Cicco, Yannick Jacquin & Laurie Pereira de Figueiredo | Watch Now\n\nEeva directed by Lucija Mrzljak & Morten Tsinakov | Watch Trailer\n\nHumo (Smoke) directed by Rita Basulto | Shortverse Page\n\nI’m Hip directed by John Musker | Shortverse Page\n\nA Kind of Testament directed by Stephen Vuillemin | Watch Trailer\n\nKoerkorter (Dog Apartment) directed by Priit Tender | Shortverse Page\n\nLetter to a Pig directed by Tal Kantor | Watch Now\n\nNinety-Five Senses directed by Jared Hess | Watch Trailer\n\nOnce upon a Studio directed by Dan Abraham & Trent Correy | Watch Now\n\nOur Uniform directed by Yegane Moghaddam | Watch Trailer\n\nPachyderme directed by Stéphanie Clément | Watch Now\n\nPete directed by Bret “Brook” Parker | Watch Trailer\n\n27 directed by Flóra Anna Buda | Watch Trailer\n\nWar Is Over!

This hasn’t been fait accompli in the past—the likes of Yorgos Lanthimos and indeed Almodóvar himself have made shorts in recent years that have failed to win. However, neither had Netflix in their corner, and The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar must be considered a prohibitive favorite.\n\nBig-Name Directors: The other categories are stacked with big-name directors too: Ramin Bahrani, Kevin MacDonald, and multi-time nominee, Ben Proudfoot, in Documentary (to say nothing of the directing debut of legendary executive, Sheila Nevins). Even animation has a film by Napoleon Dynamite himself, Jared Hess.\n\nFestival Favorites Do Well: Oscar has, in years past, been something of a quixotic crapshoot, and while the Live-Action category still raises eyebrows for some of its inclusions, changes in the voting membership in recent years mean that more festival heavyweights are making it through. A Kind of Testament and 27 have dominated international festivals this year, with splashy premieres at non-animation events like the Berlinale and Cannes respectively, and Nǎi Nai and Wài Pó cleaned up in the USA, winning Grand Jury or Best Documentary at SXSW, AFI Fest, and Seattle International.\n\nIs Streamer Dominance Fading? Streamers are well-represented—by my informal count Netflix has 3, Paramount+ has 2, Disney+ has a couple. But, it doesn’t feel like the swell of prior years. I’m probably just misremembering though, as there will certainly be a rush of acquisitions leading up to, and after, the nominee announcement at the end of January.\n\nShouts to S/W Alums: Pleased as punch for Ben Proudfoot and Kris Bowers, Sean Wang, Elham Ehsas, Ramin Bahrani, Stéphanie Clément, and sure, even Wes Anderson.\n\n***\n\nView Previous Oscar-nominated films, winners and further coverage from the awards on our dedicated channel."
