        "text": "OMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - It’s out with the old and in with the new at Westside Community Schools.\n\nWestside’s team announced a brand new logo for the district for the 2024-2025 school year.\n\n“Over the years, you’d go into different buildings and see gear and marketing materials and there was never a single red. This seems like such a simple thing, but that is where we started,” Dana Blakely, President of the Board of Education at Westside, said.\n\nWestside’s logo history is storied -- going through many changes. The district’s current students are most familiar with one known as “Star man.”\n\nLate last year, the district started the search to find its successor, landing again amongst the stars.\n\n“The star in general recognizes and symbolizes excellence. It’s also a great little nod to Star Man. We’re always going to give that nod to our tradition and our history,” Elizabeth Power, Director of Communications and Engagement at Westside, said.\n\nPower said the “Westside Star” logo isn’t replacing any of the individual school logos. Instead, it’s the main event in a new, cohesive brand for the district, which also includes a decision on the perfect “Westside Red.”\n\nThe logo also features a red “W,” again highlighting the history of the district, as well as an open box, which Power says symbolizes the open community nature of the district.\n\n“What really stands out to me is that Westside wants to be a district that is at the forefront of everything we do for kids,” Power said. “We want to innovate, we want to grow. I think that our logo shows that we are proud to be Westside Community Schools.”\n\nNow, the teachers and staff are going to get ready for the students to come back to school. Their first day is going to be this Thursday."
