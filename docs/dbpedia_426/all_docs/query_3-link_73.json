Despite being set in the Civil War, Crane's book has resonated with readers ever since, as the dangers of war and the challenge to be brave in the face of grave danger have not diminished over time. Given human history, it seems likely that for the same reasons, The Red Badge of Courage will continue to speak to every human's wish to avoid pain and suffering, but not at the expense of letting down those who count on you, or worse: letting down yourself, and becoming a coward."
