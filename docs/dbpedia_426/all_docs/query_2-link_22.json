        "text": "When Pixar announced in 2008 that it was creating its first film with a female protagonist, expectations were high. It was a coming-of-age tale centered on a mother-daughter relationship and their opposing viewpoints on cultural norms, a meaty storyline the famed animation studio hadn’t explored before. Brenda Chapman — a Pixar storyboard artist who conceived the project — was set to direct the film, making history as Pixar’s first female director. However, before “Brave” was released in 2012, Chapman was replaced as director, and much of her original screenplay was rewritten. This resulted in a disjoined script that largely overshadowed her innovative narrative of familial and cultural strife with slapstick humor and predictable plot points. “Brave” left much to be desired for a Pixar film that celebrates heritage and diversity in a deep and nuanced manner. Ten years later, the studio has answered that call with its 2022 release, “Turning Red.”\n\n“Turning Red,” the latest film from Pixar, was directed by Chinese-Canadian animator, Domee Shi, the first woman to solo direct a Pixar feature film. She made her Pixar directorial debut in 2018 with the short film, “Bao,” a story about an aging Chinese woman who gets a second chance at motherhood when one of her dumplings comes to life. After “Bao” won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, Shi was invited to develop and direct a feature film for Pixar. She created “Turning Red,” which follows a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian girl named Meilin “Mei” Lee who, due to a hereditary curse, discovers that she turns into a giant red panda whenever she expresses strong emotion. When Mei’s mother Ming learns that the curse has been activated, she makes every effort to suppress and ultimately banish Mei’s panda. As with “Brave” for Chapman, “Turning Red” was largely inspired by Shi’s personal experiences. She considers the awkwardness of growing up a largely universal occurrence and thus uses the motif of menstruation as an emblem of coming of age for a woman, told through the lens of her own cultural upbringing.\n\nFrom the beginning of “Turning Red,” we see that Mei is an extroverted, spunky teenager who loves school, her friends, her family, and boy bands. She has a strong sense of duty to honor her family, and most importantly, her mother. Most of the film is told through Mei’s perspective, endearing us to her. “Brave” takes a similar approach, as early on we learn that its protagonist, Merida, is a courageous, headstrong girl who loves riding horses, exploring nature, and practicing archery. She also has a close relationship with her mother, though the film soon abandons efforts to continue developing a deeper knowledge and rapport for Merida and her mother in lieu of less complex plot points.\n\nThe lives of both Mei and Merida are ruled by their cultures. Set in medieval Scotland, Merida is the Princess of DunBroch and is relentlessly being molded by her mother to succeed her as Queen one day. This involves her having to fit the image of a royal lady and adhere to certain customs, most notably being betrothed to a male leader of a neighboring clan. Merida sternly objects to this and spends the film attempting to overcome the traditions society puts before her. But the challenges “Brave” establishes do not feel firmly rooted in its cultural setting. It’s a narrative that could be transposed onto nearly any other fairytale locale and thus doesn’t take full advantage of its physical environment.\n\n“Turning Red,” by contrast, takes a much narrower scope by being so tightly woven into its Chinese heritage. The pressures Mei faces to be a dutiful daughter speak to a specific but universal experience of growing up as the child of immigrants. It’s a story that can resonate with Asian Americans — who have been represented as the lead of a Pixar film (“Up”) only one other time — as well as members of other minority groups who are often raised in these environments.\n\n“Turning Red” pushes beyond solely justifying the mother’s actions with cultural norms and addresses how they generationally impacted her, and therefore, her daughter. In a candid exchange between Mei and her mother Ming, we learn that Ming’s panda form once caused her to hurt her own mother, which is why she is adamant about Mei expelling her own. This caused Ming to develop into the fragile and emotionally repressed woman that we see throughout the film. The vulnerability displayed by Ming is one that allows viewers to now understand and sympathize with both sides. Mei ensures her mother that the less-than-perfect aspects of life are just as important to embrace. In the most compelling part of the film, we witness a moment of mutual understanding and respect between mother and daughter.\n\n“Brave” attempts to have a similar, emotional moment at its end between Merida and her mother, but it does not feel nearly as earned. The first 40 minutes of the film set up the potential for a revelatory journey and climactic ending between the two. However, there is suddenly a second plot introduced that derails from the complex mother-daughter relationship and spirals down towards a more infantile direction. This hodgepodge storyline is the remnant of the shift in directorial power that took place between Brenda Chapman and Mark Andrews.\n\nRejected over unexplained “creative differences” between her and Pixar’s former chief creative officer, John Lasseter, Chapman was forced to hand over her story to someone who had no personal connection to the narrative. Only small pieces of Chapman’s original screenplay were kept in the final product, for which she was credited as a co-director. As seen with other films such as the 2017 “Justice League,” when a principal director leaves their original project, issues with story continuity are almost inevitable. “Brave” experienced these consequences, which did not allow for certain story elements to be fully explored and executed properly. When bringing her story to life, Domee Shi’s team was one of her strongest assets. Ranging from Pixar’s first-ever all-female creative staff to a voice cast that shared cultural ties to the story, Shi created an environment that celebrated diversity, not only in front of the camera but also behind it.\n\n“Brave” had the potential to solidify itself into Pixar’s canon of films that are not only entertaining and visually lush, but speak to larger societal and cultural topics. Due to shifts in leadership, patchwork scriptwriting, and an overall disconnect to the narrative, it became the story that could have been. “Turning Red” was able to right those wrongs by producing a story that not only achieved what “Brave” set out to do, but did it in a way that bursts with conviction, passion, and innovation."
