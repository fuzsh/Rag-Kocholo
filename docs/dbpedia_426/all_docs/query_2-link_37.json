But did you also know that she took lots of sexy baths and liked to lounge around naked contemplating her affair with her married lover? It’s true!\n\nWe may presume that in all those movies about the lives of male scientists, they got down to their birthday suits once in a while, but only Marie Curie: The Courage of Knowledge, a joint French-Polish-German production, dares to tell the truth about the woman who developed the concept of radioactivity and pioneered the use of radiation to treat cancer: that if a camera slowly panned along her naked, reclining body (as portrayed by Karolina Gruszka), she might be caught thinking about how unfair it was that the gutter press and her professional enemies would deploy salacious gossip in an attempt to deny her an unprecedented second Nobel Prize."
