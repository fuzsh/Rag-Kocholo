        "text": "Summary: Based on Stephen Crane's classic novel, this is a story about a frightened boy, Henry Fleming (Audie) who went into battle and came out of it a man with courage. He is extremely scared on the inside but talks tough on the outside. He initially finds out during his first engagement that being in battle causes him to panic and run away. He sees his comrades wounded and regards them in an envious way wishing that he too had a red badge of courage. He gathers back his courage and leads the men on an aggressive attack carrying the colors. He is later recognized by the general for leading the charge. This movie was directed by the legendary John Huston who insisted over the protests of studio executives that Audie play the lead role. This is one of Audie's finest performances."
