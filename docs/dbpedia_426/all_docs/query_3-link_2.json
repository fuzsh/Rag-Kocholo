Jane, however, is won over by Blackie, owner of a gambling house. Pinto thrashes Reedly for bothering the judge's daughter Eliza and orders him from town. When Reedly is mysteriously killed, Eliza's fiance' Nathan is blamed, but Pinto suspects Blackie and catches him trying to abscond with Jane and her fortune.
