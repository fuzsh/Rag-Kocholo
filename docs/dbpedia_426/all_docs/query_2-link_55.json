        "text": "I love the community here at Branson. Ever since my first visit here at Branson I have really felt the family-like community. The small student body makes it feel more like a family and lets me have a closer relationships with my peers across grades and my teachers.\n\nI love teaching, and Branson is the best teaching environment I have found. My students are engaged and curious. My colleagues are wonderful. The campus is a beautiful place to spend each day. And we're always asking ourselves \"How can we make Branson even better?\"\n\nI love Branson students! Filled with promise, Branson students are the best part our community. I am energized by them every day. They are kind, funny, curious, and ready to engage with ideas and with me as a human. They forge authentic bonds with each other and their teachers.\n\nBranson has been an excellent fit for both of our boys. The balance of rigorous academics, competitive sports and the arts made them well prepared for college AND BEYOND. It’s the Branson community that helped them develop into thoughtful young men who are care about the world around them and have a stake in tackling the issues of today. As a parent it’s been amazing to watch them develop and grow. We are forever grateful for their experience at Branson and for the time we have spent with the broader Branson community.\n\nWhat I love about being a part of the Branson community is the sense of connectedness, belonging and acceptance I get from its beloved community. The best part is that I can be my authentic self.\n\nI’ve never experienced a community quite like Branson’s. It’s a place where my children are known, supported and challenged. They are not only celebrated for their gifts, but encouraged to and feel safe to step outside of their comfort zones. When I watch the students linger long past the school day, it seems almost as if Branson is a second home.\n\nBranson is special in the way the teachers are so invested in the personal and academic development of its student body. I never realized how well Branson prepared me for life and what would come after graduating. Its academic rigor and personalized mentorship gave me the freedom to take risks in a supportive environment. This confidence and independence led me to a top-tier law school and fueled my career as an attorney. Today, I’m passing these same lessons on to my children where the impact is now multigenerational.\n\nMy time at KBS/Branson taught me to engage in and to appreciate a richer, fuller life. It has offered me a life-time relationship of friends and resource through the Alumni Office, publications and School programs.\n\nBy far, my time at Branson was the single biggest influence on my life. My best friends in high school are still my best friends today. I’m so proud of Branson’s continuity of the excellence. Throughout the generations, all of the people who made and make up the Branson community are of the highest character. There is a strong connectedness that permeates through the small but far reaching community – we all want to support each other and enrich each other’s lives."
