Audie Murphy--the most decorated American GI of World War II--stars in this adaptation of one of the great novels of American literature, a story of one man forced to confront both cowardice and courage within himself, The Red Badge of Courage. The United States Civil War: The first time young Henry Fleming (Murphy) faces battle, he turns and runs. Fleming is knocked unconscious, but when he returns to his unit, he lies, saying that he was shot. Yet, somehow, in this vicious internecine war with tens of thousands of soldiers dying in single battles, young Henry Fleming finds a deep well of courage within himself when his unit is commanded to lead a charge that Fleming knows will be suicidal.",

        "text": "Though [Courage] is a thin study, over-directed and underwritten... it is also the most sharply focused view of soldiering yet presented by Hollywood, and, in the pure sense, one of the most uncompromisingly artistic films ever made in this country.\n\nSeptember 15, 2021\n\nRoss's portrait of cinematic conflict and compromise yields, in passing, a portrait of true artistry in movies that stands untarnished to this day.\n\nMay 17, 2019\n\nBut, if anything, I feel sympathy for Huston. His true sin was merely biting off more than he could chew.\n\nDecember 28, 2018\n\nThe fall and redemption of the protagonist, while clearly predictable, is still intelligently and effectively executed\n\nJune 22, 2017"
