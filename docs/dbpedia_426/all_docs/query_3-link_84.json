        "text": "was a United States Army Air Forces airman and a recipient of the U.S. military’s highest decoration—the Medal of Honor—for his actions in World War II. He earned the award as a staff sergeant and radio operator aboard a B-29 Superfortress in the Asia-Pacific theater. During a 1945 bombing mission over Koriyama, Japan, a white phosphorus bomb prematurely ignited in his aircraft and seriously wounded him. As smoke filled the plane, he picked up the burning device and carried it through the aircraft to the cockpit where he tossed it out a window. Although he suffered severe burns, he successfully saved his plane and all crew members aboard by disposing of the incendiary/smoke-generating bomb.\n\nAny period piece is a challenging undertaking because every detail, from costumes to environment, has to match the era. “Red Courage” was all that and then some!\n\nTo recreate the WWII era, the film was shot aboard the last airworthy B-29 in existence at the Commemorative Air Force headquearters located (at the time) in Addison, TX and in a historical home in Little Rock, AR. This film required massive camera rigs in tight spaces, 3D animation, VFX and countless layers of sound design amidst an agressive post-production schedule.\n\nMost films of this magnitude would require weeks to shoot. Due to scheduling and budget restraints, “Red Courage” was shot in only five days."
