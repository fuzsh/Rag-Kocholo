        "meta_description": "The use of cartoons alongside articles has become more and more popular for School Accessed Courseworks (SACs) and end of year English exam. At first glance and even the second glance, cartoons may not always appear to contain great amounts of information for students to analyse. However, when students know what to look for, it can be a vital jump-start for an insightful cartoon analysis. After all, there is a reason why teachers and examiners choose to use cartoons. It is crucial that students develop a strong ability to analyse cartoons with or without written articles. While there are many resources helping students gain skills in analysing written articles, few are specifically focused on cartoons. Below are 10 things you should look for in cartoons. These are common techniques used by illustrators and are a fantastic starting point in cartoon analysis. 1. Colour In coloured cartoons, there are myriad of things you can look for. Ask yourself these questions: What colours did the illustrator use? What colours are used most? Least? Is there a repetition of colours? Is there only one colour? Colours can be separated into two groups â warm colours and cool colours. Warm colours including red, orange and yellow may be used to evoke feelings of comfort and warmth. It can also be used to express anger and embarrassment. Meanwhile, cool colours including blue, green and purple may represent calm and tranquility. Otherwise it can mean sadness and misery. What colours mean1: Color\tEmotions Black\tSymbol of menace or evil, popular as an indicator of power. Associated with death and mourning, unhappiness, sexuality, formality, and sophistication. White\tPurity or innocence. Cold, bland, and sterile. Red\tEvokes strong emotions, associated with love, warmth, and comfort. Still considered an intense and angry color that creates feelings of excitement, intensity, sexuality. Blue\tGives the feelings of calmness or serenity. Described as peaceful, tranquil, secure, and orderly. Green\tSymbolizes nature and the natural world. Represents tranquility, good luck, health, and jealousy. Symbol of fertility, has a calming effect and relieves stress. Yellow\tCheery and warm, but can also create feelings of frustration and anger. Most fatiguing to the eye yet most attention-seeking color (so great color for important details or calls to action- remember the yellow stop/caution color). Purple\tRoyalty and wealth, wisdom and spirituality, sex and relationships, exotic and special. Brown\tNatural color that evokes a sense of strength and reliability, warmth, comfort, and security. Orange\tBlatant and vulgar colour, makes you feel excitement, enthusiasm, and warmth. As a combination of red and yellow itâs often used to draw attention. Pink\tAssociated with love, romance, youth, freshness and may have a calming effect. Pink effect depends on the type of pink (strong, light, deep etc). Remember that a group of colours can represent an overall meaning: Red, blue and white â can represent Australian flag and symbolises patriotism. Red, orange, and dark brown â can represent earth and nature. While analysing colourful cartoons, also consider that many cartoons are black and white. Although these cartoons lack colour, illustrators use other methods to create meaning. What shading is used? â heavy shading can mean power and solidity; light shading can indicate frailty and insignificance. What textures/patterns are used? â smooth or rough. What shapes are there? Remember that no cartoons are simply just âblack and white.â For example: Cartoon by Nicholson from \"The Australian\" newspaper Cartoon by Nicholson from âThe Australianâ newspaper Analysis: The monochromatic national broadband laid across mountains and kilometers just to serve one shack may represent a sombre plan that is pointless for Australian citizens. 2. Size Size is an important element in cartoons and one that is often quite obvious. Investigate: Is anything disproportioned? Exaggerated? Under-exaggerated? What is large and what is small? For example: Cartoon by Nicholson from \"The Australian\" newspaper Cartoon by Nicholson from âThe Australianâ newspaper Background: Wikileaks exposes information about Hilary Clinton and Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillardâs subsequent condemnation of the website. Analysis: The oversized âWikiLakeâ appears to be irrepressible and too overwhelming for any of the three politicians from preventing another information release. 3. Labelling What is labeled? What do the labels say? Do the labels tell us the situation? Person? Time change? Cartoon by Nicholson from \"The Australian\" newspaper Cartoon by Nicholson from âThe Australianâ newspaper For example: Background: In the aftermath of the 2011 Queensland floods, many will be seeking insurance for home and business damages. Analysis: The label âGrin Insuranceâ is satirical in that one would expect a customer to be âgrinningâ to have their insurance. However, the insurance policy only âcovers [them] against small âfâ floodâ, not the âcapital âFâ Floodâ they have just experienced, leaving them with no insurance and little to âgrinâ about. 4. Speech bubbles Who is speaking? What are they saying? Is it a conversation? For example: Cartoon by Nicholson from \"The Australian\" newspaper Cartoon by Nicholson from âThe Australianâ newspaper Background: Cows contribute to greenhouse gases via flatuence of methane gas. Analysis: The irony of a cow stating that he is a âclimate change septicâ when his own release of methane gas is a significant cause in growing greenhouse gases. 5. Symbols A symbol is something that represents or stands for something else, usually an idea. They are commonly found throughout daily lives such as the cross for Christinity or the Red Cross for the organisation that helps victims of war or natural disasters. Sometimes symbols may be as obvious as those mentioned above, yet other times may be more subtle in their meaning. What symbols are incorporated? Why are particular symbols used? Is it a well-known symbol? Is the symbolâs meaning clear and identifiable? Or is it vague and can have multiple interpretations? For example: Cartoon by Mark Knight from \"The Herald Sun\" newspaper Cartoon by Mark Knight from âThe Herald Sunâ newspaper Background: Ted Baillieu, opposition leader against John Brumby in 2010 Victorian state elections. Analysis: The representation of Baillieu as an iceberg indicates that he is a powerful force preventing the Labor Party from moving forwards and winning the 2010 state elections. The cartoon symbolises the famous movie, Titanic, and indicates that the Labor Party is bound to âsinkâ against Baillieu and fail to âmove forwardâ to a victory. 6. Focus The focus of a cartoon can indicate the main issue or situation. What is in focus? What is in the foreground and background? For example: Cartoon by Mark Knight from \"The Herald Sun\" newspaper Cartoon by Mark Knight from âThe Herald Sunâ newspaper Background: Wikileaks obtaining information about politicians. Analysis: While a gigantic fly labeled âWikileaksâ is the main focus of the cartoon, it is humorous in that it succeeds in surreptitiously listening in on Kevin Rudd and Hilary Clintonâs unsuspecting private conversation. 7. Angle Angles often provide readers an indication of the status of particular people or things. If the angle is sloping down, then it creates an image of a smaller person or item. This indicates weakness, inferiority and powerlessness. An angle sloping up towards a person or item provides it with power, superiority and authority. A straight-on angle can represent equality. Is the angle sloping up? Is the angle sloping down? Is it straight on? From behind? Front on? On top or below? For example: Cartoon by Mark Knight from \"The Herald Sun\" newspaper Cartoon by Mark Knight from âThe Herald Sunâ newspaper Background: Banks and Power Companies are two sectors important to Australian society. Analysis: The angle tilted up towards the Bank and Power Company demonstrates that they are domineering, powerful and authoritative. 8. Tone The tone of a cartoon can indicate the illustratorâs attitude and stance towards the issue. Common cartoon tones include: satire, humour, irony and amusement. For more examples of tones check out: VCE Study Guideâs 195 Tones Vocabulary. For example: Cartoon by Mark Knight from \"The Herald Sun\" newspaper Cartoon by Mark Knight from âThe Herald Sunâ newspaper Background: The North Koreans are well known for their possession of nuclear weapons. Analysis: Although North Korea has made significant technological advances with their nuclear weapons, it is ironic that their other tools of war remain underdeveloped, perhaps since the Middle Ages as the catapult implies. 9. Facial Expression Facial expressions are key to the characterâs thoughts, feelings and emotions. What facial expressions are used? Do they change (sequential cartoons)? How do expressions compare to anotherâs expression? Is it an expression we expect? For example: Cartoon by Mark Knight from \"The Herald Sun\" newspaper Cartoon by Mark Knight from âThe Herald Sunâ newspaper Background: Prince William introducing Kate Middleton to his royal family. Analysis: While Prince William appears to be proud and excited to introduce Kate to his family, his fiancÃ©âs expression demonstrates that perhaps she may be apprehensive about the event. 10. Context The context of a cartoon is important. Most of the time, cartoons are attached to articles and usually draw upon a point contended by the writer of the article. Does the cartoon support or oppose the article? Is it relevant or irrelevant? Does it focus on the past, present or future? Which aspect of the article does it relate to? Does it add further information? However, there are times when you will have to analyse a cartoon alone, where it is not accompanying an article. In this case you will have to understand the background, the situation and the issue that is represented.

        "text": "Have you ever wondered how you can read your books so efficiently that you will be able to identify the most important passages, quotes, symbols, authorâs views and values etc. all in one go? Well, Iâm going to share some handy tips you can adopt while annotating a novel that will hopefully help you achieve this. Warning â if you are a reader who likes to preserve their books and keep them crispy clean, this study guide probably isnât for you. However, keep in mind that annotating texts is a powerful step in getting to know your text and optimising your essay responses.\n\nBefore we get started, what exactly is âannotatingâ? To annotate means to add notes to a text where you provide extra comments or explanations (usually in the margins of the book). It is very much an activity for yourself, because it allows you to become an active reader â where you are engaged in thinking about the plot, themes, characters etc. as you are reading and jotting down key thoughts. As a result, active readers are more likely to become immersed in the story, absorb the ideas better, be more open-minded and therefore usually develop their own unique interpretation of the text. While annotating may not come so naturally to some of you, this guide below should definitely equip you with a good starting ground!\n\n1. Think of your text as a colouring book. Use different coloured highlighters for different themes. This way when youâre rummaging through your book to find a certain quote to support a theme, say you specifically only highlight âromanceâ theme in pink, itâs much easier for you to find the pink than to look through a whole book highlighted all in green. Think of it as creating a trail for you to follow throughout the book. Creating a legend at the start of the book (for example, in the contents page) can help you keep track of which colour stands for which theme.\n\n2. Circle new vocabulary. Look it up and then write their definitions next to the word. Next, keep a word bank in a workbook or on a word document containing any words youâve learnt. Now youâve successfully killed two stones with one bird â youâve broadened your vocabulary and youâve got a handy sophisticated vocabulary list you can always refer to when it comes to essay writing!\n\n3. Write notes in the margins. Here you can summarise the significant points of a passage without needing to re-read the whole thing again. Use a pencil rather than pen. If you donât like writing on paper, you can always use sticky notes and stick them to the pages. However, avoid writing full comprehensive notes in the margins. Youâre not trying to write another book inside the empty sections of a book. Use a separate workbook or a word document for that!\n\n4. Be open to different interpretations. Just because your teacher or a study guide interprets the text in particular way, doesnât mean that you need to agree. If you see things from a different angle, thatâs an advantage for you. Remember that you can be ambiguous with your ideas, understanding a certain character or theme from multiple perspectives offers you a variety of ideas that can be applied in your essay. This idea is echoed by English assessors in the VCAA 2013 Examination Report,\n\nâ¦students should be encouraged to have confidence in their own reading and demonstrate a personal understanding of their text, rather than relying exclusively on commercially produced material. All texts are complex works of art with a wealth of opportunity for exploration. There is no âexpectedâ response to a topic, and the most successful pieces were those that were thoughtful and fresh.\n\n5. Got burning questions that pop up? Donât dismiss what you donât understand! Put down a question mark and do some research. The better you understand your text now, the greater understanding you will have of events that occur later in the text.\n\n6. Mark literary devices. Symbols, metaphors, alliteration, assonance â the list goes on. Use shapes such as circles, triangles, squares and create a legend in order to keep track of the different literary devices that present themselves throughout the text. Bear in mind that the best essays always include a well-rounded discussion about the authorâs choices in literary techniques and how they develop specific themes and/or characters.\n\n7. Dog-ear important passages. Some key passages can be lengthy (spreading over several pages), and it can be a pain to highlight pages and pages of a book (it might too much for your eyes to handle too â ouch!) so instead, fold the corners of those pages down so that you know exactly where that key event occurs.\n\n8. Find unique phrases/quotes. Youâll come across the same quotes that are repeatedly mentioned in class, study guides and essays that other students have written. To stand out, you should try to find those quotes that are equally powerful but are somewhat overlooked or underrated.\n\n9. Annotate study notes and study guides. These notes are written by another reader who has developed their own ideas about the text â this doesnât mean that you necessarily have to share the same ideas as there is always opportunity to disagree with anotherâs opinion. Draw smiley faces or frowns in areas where you agree or disagree. This can be the basis of an interesting discussion in your own essay.\n\n10. Donât be afraid to destroy that book! Yes, itâs nice to have a book crispy and clean, but think of annotating as a way to own that book! Show that you know the in and outs of the text so well that if someone else were to pick it up, they would have no idea where to even begin! Having proper notes in the right places and annotations will make the biggest difference.\n\nKeep in mind that annotating does not equal skimming (where you briefly speed-read through your text). If youâre planning to only flick through the book, you are probably not going to find those unique passages or under-used yet powerful quotes. Take it slow and easy!\n\nUpdated 14/07/2022\n\nContents\n\nWhat Is a Comparative?\n\nWhat Are You Expected To Cover? (Comparative Criteria)\n\nSchool Assessed Coursework (SAC), Exams and Allocated Marks\n\nHow To Prepare for Your Comparative SAC and Exam\n\nHow To Write a Comparative Essay\n\n1. What Is a Comparative?\n\nComparative is also known as 'Reading and Comparing', 'Comparative Essay' and less frequently, 'Compare and Contrast'. For our purposes, we'll just stick to 'Comparative'.\n\nAs its name may indicate, a Comparative is when you analyse and write on two texts, comparing their similarities and differences. In VCE, there are 8 pairs of texts Year 12s can choose from (or more accurately, your school chooses for you!). The most popular combination of texts include novels and films, however, plays also make it onto the list.\n\nWhen you start doing Comparative at school, you will move through your texts just as you have for Text Response (except...instead of one text it's actually two) - from watching the film and/or reading the novel, participating in class discussions about similar and different themes and ideas, and finally, submitting one single essay based on the two texts. So yep, if you've only just gotten your head around Text Response, VCAA likes to throw a spanner in the works to keep you on your toes!\n\nBut, don't worry. The good news is all of your Text Response learning is applicable to VCEâs Comparative, and it's really not as hard as it might first appear. Here's a video I created introducing Comparative (I've time-stamped it to start at 0:55 - when the Comparative section starts - thank me later!).\n\nâ\n\nâ2. What Are You Expected To Cover? (Comparative Criteria)\n\nWhat are teachers and examiners expecting to see in your essays? Below are the VCE criteria for Comparative essays (sourced from the VCAA English examination page).\n\nNote: Some schools may express the following points differently, however, they should all boil down to the same points - what is necessary in a Comparative essay.\n\na) Knowledge and understanding of both texts, and the ideas and issues they present\n\nSociety, history and culture all shape and influence us in our beliefs and opinions. Authors use much of what theyâve obtained from the world around them and employ this knowledge to their writing. Understanding their values embodied in texts can help us, as readers, identify and appreciate theme and character representations.\n\nFor example: Misogyny is widespread in both Photograph 51 and The Penelopiad, and both writers explore the ways in which females deal with such an environment. Photograph 51 is set in the 1950s when women begun to enter the workforce, whereas The Penelopiad is set in Ancient Greece, a period when women were less likely to speak out against discrimination.\n\nb) Discussion of meaningful connections, similarities or differences between the texts, in response to the topic;\n\nMore about this later in 4. How To Prepare for Your Comparative SAC and Exam, Step 2: Understand both your texts - as a pair (below).\n\nc) Use of textual evidence to support the comparative analysis\n\nWhile you should absolutely know how to embed quotes in your essay like a boss, you want to have other types of evidence in your Comparative essay. You must discuss how the author uses the form that he/she is writing in to develop their discussion. This encompasses a huge breadth of things from metaphors to structure to language.\n\nFor example: \"The personification of Achilles as âwolf, a violator of every law of men and gods', illustrates his descent from human to animal...\" or \"Maloufâs constant use of the present voice and the chapter divisions allow the metaphor of time to demonstrate the futility and omnipresence of war...\"\n\nTo learn more about metalanguage, read our What Is Metalanguage? post.\n\nd) Control and effectiveness of language use, as appropriate to the task.\n\nWhen examiners read essays, they are expected to get through about 12-15 essays in an hour! This results in approximately 5 minutes to read, get their head around, and grade your essay - not much time at all! It is so vital that you donât give the examiner an opportunity to take away marks because they have to reread certain parts of your essay due to poor expression and grammar.\n\nâ\n\n3. School Assessed Coursework (SAC), Exams and Allocated Marks\n\nComparative is the first Area of Study (AoS 1) in Unit 2 (Year 11) and Unit 4 (Year 12) - meaning that majority of students will tackle the Comparative SAC in Term 3. The number of allocated marks are:\n\nUnit 2 â dependant on school\n\nUnit 4 â 60 marks (whopper!)\n\nThe time allocated to your SAC is school-based. Schools often use one or more periods combined, depending on how long each of your periods last. Teachers can ask you to write anywhere from 900 to 1200 words for your essay (keep in mind that itâs about quality, not quantity!)\n\nIn your exam, you get a whopping total of 3 hours to write 3 essays (Text Response, Comparative, and Language Analysis). The general guide is 60 minutes on Comparative, however, it is up to you exactly how much time you decide to dedicate to this section of the exam. Your Comparative essay will be graded out of 10 by two different examiners. Your two unique marks from these examiners will be combined, with 20 as the highest possible mark.\n\nâ\n\n4. How To Prepare for Your Comparative SAC and Exam\n\nPreparation is a vital component in how you perform in your SACs and exam so itâs always a good idea to find out what is your best way to approach assessments. This is just to get you thinking about the different study methods you can try before a SAC. Here are my top strategies (ones I actually used in VCE) for Comparative preparation that can be done any time of year (including holidays - see How To Recharge Your Motivation Over the School Holidays for more tips):\n\nStep 1: Understand each text - individually\n\nThis doesnât mean reading/watching your texts a specific amount of times (though twice is usually a recommended minimum), but rather, coming to an understanding of your texts. Besides knowing important sections, quotes, themes and characters (which are still important and which you should definitely know), here are some other matters which are also necessary to consider:\n\nWhy has it been chosen by VCAA (out of literally millions of other books)?\n\nWhy are you reading it (especially if itâs an old text, and how itâs still important throughout the ages)?\n\nWhy did the author write it?\n\nWhat kind of social commentary exists within the text (especially on specific issues and themes)?\n\nThese kinds of questions are important because quite often in this area of study, youâll be defending and interpreting your own ideas alongside the authorâs. When you find a solid interpretation of the text as a whole, then no essay topic will really throw you off - because youâll know already what you think about it. Moreover, because youâre comparing two texts in this section, understanding a text and being specific (e.g. 'both texts argue that equality is important' vs. 'while both texts A and B agree with the notion of equality, A focuses on ____ whereas B highlights Â ____') will help your writing improve in sophistication and depth.\n\nIf you need any more tips on how to learn your texts in-depth, Susan's (English study score 50) Steps for Success in Text Study guideÂ provides a clear pathway for how to approach your texts and is a must read for VCE English students!\n\nAnd, if you're studying texts you hate (ugh!), you'll also want to check out Lavinia's guide which teaches you how to do well even when you hate your texts.\n\nStep 2: Understand both your texts - as a pair\n\nAvoid simply drawing connections between the texts which are immediately obvious. When writing a Comparative, the key strategy that'll help you stand out from the crowd is the CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT strategy. I discuss this in more detail below, under 'eBooks'.\n\nWe'll use George Orwell's Animal Farm and Shakespeare's Macbeth as an example (don't worry if you haven't studied either of these texts, it's just to prove a point). The most obvious connection simply from reading the plot is that both Napoleon and Macbeth are powerful leaders. However, you want to start asking yourself more questions to develop an insightful comparison between the two men:\n\nFor example: In Macbeth and Animal Farm a common theme is power\n\nQ: How do they achieve power?\n\nA: In Animal Farm, Napoleon is sly about his intentions and slowly secures his power with clever manipulation and propaganda. However, Shakespeareâs Macbeth adopts very different methods as he uses violence and abuse to secure his power.\n\nQ: How do they maintain power?\n\nA: Both Napoleon and Macbeth are tyrants who go to great length to protect their power. They believe in killing or chasing away anyone who undermines their power.\n\nQ: What is the effect of power on the two characters?\n\nA: While Macbeth concentrates on Macbethâs growing guilty conscience and his gradual deterioration to insanity, Animal Farm offers no insight into Napoleonâs stream of consciousness. Instead, George Orwell focuses on the pain and suffering of the animals under Napoleonâs reign. This highlights Shakespeareâs desire to focus on the inner conflict of a man, whereas Orwell depicted the repercussions of a totalitarian regime on those under its ruling.\n\nCheck out our comparative scene analysis of The Longest Memory & The 7 Stages of Grieving for another example of understanding texts as a pair!\n\nStep 3: Know your comparative words\n\nHaving a list of comparative words will help you understand your texts as a pair, and helps make your life easier when you start writing your essays. Here's a list we've compiled below:\n\nSimilarities\n\nAdditionally\n\nAs well as\n\nAt the same time\n\nComparably\n\nCorrespondingly\n\nFurthermore\n\nIn addition\n\nIn parallel\n\nJust as\n\nLikewise\n\nMoreover\n\nSame as\n\nSimilarly\n\nDifferences\n\nAlthough\n\nCompared to\n\nConversely\n\nDespite that\n\nEven so\n\nEven though\n\nHowever\n\nIn contrast\n\nMeanwhile\n\nNevertheless\n\nOn the contrary\n\nOn the other hand\n\nNonetheless\n\nUnlike\n\nYet\n\nFeel free to download the PDF version of this list for your own studies as well!\n\nStep 4: Understand the construction of your texts\n\nBesides comparing ideas and themes, and having an understanding of what the text says, itâs also imperative that you understand HOW the texts say it. This type of analysis focuses on metalanguage (also known as literary devices or literary techniques). When you get technical with this and focus on metalanguage, it brings out more depth in your writing.\n\nYou could start asking yourself:\n\nWhat kind of description is used?\n\nWhat kind of sentences are used?\n\nAre they long and winding or rather short and bare?\n\nAre they dripping with adjectives or snappy?\n\nWhat is the structure of the text?\n\nDoes one begin with a prologue/end with an epilogue?\n\nIs the text continuous or divided e.g. through letters or days or parts?\n\nDoes the text end at a climax or end with a true finality?\n\nWhat reoccurs throughout the text? (specific lines, symbols or images)\n\nThese kinds of understanding are important as they are evidentiary material for your arguments. What you say and believe the authors have said, as well as how you believe the texts differ, may rely heavily on these techniques. You'd then translate this analysis to develop your arguments further in your essay. For example:\n\nHis depiction of Chapel serves as a subversion of the conventional type of slave; he is 'half a slave, half the master' and belongs to 'another way of life'. His defiance and rebellion against the dictations of society is exemplified through his speech, which consists of rhythmic and poetic couplets, filled with flowery language; which ultimately challenges the idea of illiterate slaves.\n\nStep 5: Read and watch Lisa's Study Guides' resources\n\nDoing this study all by yourself can be rather daunting, so we've got your back. We specialise in supporting VCE English students by creating helpful videos, study guides and ebooks.

How good is that?\n\neBooks\n\nAnd if that isn't enough, I'd highly recommend my How To Write A Killer Comparative ebook. What's often the most difficult part of Comparative is finding the right examples and evidence to ensure that you're standing out against hundreds of other students studying VCE.\n\nUnlike Text Response where there are over 30 texts for schools to choose from, Comparative only has 8 pairs of texts. This means that the likelihood of other students studying the same texts as you is much higher. And what does that mean?\n\nIt means that your competition is going to be even tougher. It's likely the character or quote you plan to use will also be used by other students. So, this means that there needs to be a way for you to differentiate yourself. Enter my golden CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT strategy.\n\nThis strategy can be used for any example you wish to use, but by approaching your example with the CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT mindset, you'll immediately be able to establish a unique perspective that should earn you some bonus marks.\n\nIf you've ever had a teacher tell you that you needed to âelaborateâ, âgo into more detailâ, or âmore analysisâ needed in your essays - this strategy will help eliminate all those criticisms. It will also show your teacher how you are comfortable writing an in-depth analysis using fewer examples, rather than trying to overload your essay with as many examples as possible because you barely have anything to say about each one.\n\nTo learn more about the CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT strategy, get a free preview of this study guide on the Shop page or at the bottom of this blog.\n\nStep 6: Brainstorm and write plans\n\nOnce you've done some preliminary revision, it's time to write plans! Plans will help ensure you stick to your essay topic, and have a clear outline of what your essay will cover. This clarity is crucial to success in a Comparative essay.\n\nDoing plans is also an extremely time-efficient way to approach SACs. Rather than slaving away hours upon hours over writing essays, writing plans will save you the burnout and get you feeling confident faster.\n\nI've also curated essay topic breakdown videos based on specific VCE texts. In these videos, I explore keywords, ideas and how I'd plan an essay with corresponding examples/evidence.\n\nStep 7: Get your hands on essay topics\n\nOften, teachers will provide you with a list of prompts to practice before your SAC. Some teachers can be kind enough to nudge you in the direction of a particular prompt that may be on the SAC. If your teacher hasnât distributed any, donât be afraid to ask.\n\nWe have a number of free essay topics curated by our team at LSG, check some of them out:\n\nI Am Malala and Made In Dagenham Prompts\n\nRansom and Invictus Prompts\n\nStasiland and Never Let Me Go Prompts\n\nThe Crucible and Year Of Wonders Prompts\n\nThe Penelopiad and Photograph 51 Prompts\n\nPsst...see these fully annotated sample essays where we show you exactly how we analysed the prompt, brainstormed our ideas and created a plan for our essay:\n\nComparing Photograph 51 and The Penelopiad: Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nRansom and The Queen: Comparative Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nThe Longest Memory and Black Diggers - A Comparative Essay Breakdown\n\nâStep 8: Write essays\n\nYes, sad but itâs a fact. Writers only get better by actually writing. Even if you just tackle a couple of essays then at least you will have started to develop a thinking process that will help you to set out arguments logically, utilise important quotes and time yourself against the clock. It will help you write faster as well â something that is a major problem for many students. With that said, let's get into how to write a Comparative next.\n\nâ\n\nâ5. How To Write a Comparative Essay\n\nComparative Essay Structure\n\nHere are a couple of resources to get your Comparative essay structure sorted. Firstly a video (time-stamped at 1:38):\n\nSecondly, jump over to Sarah's (English study score 47) Compare the Pair: A Guide to Structuring a Reading and Comparing Essay post where she delves into two different types of Comparative essay structures.\n\nComparative Essay Example\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn an introduction, you're expected to have the following:\n\nContext (or background)\n\nBoth authors' (or director's) names\n\nBoth text titles\n\nContention\n\nMain arguments\n\nHere's an example from Mida (English study score 43), in her post The Longest Memory and Black Diggers - A Comparative Essay Breakdown:\n\nThe hopes and dreams of oppressed individuals can be fulfilled to a certain extent. This degree of fulfilment, however, can ultimately become restricted by the entrenched beliefs and dictations of society; and thus, this process of fulfilment is presented to be difficult and rare to achieve. In Fred DâAguiarâs novella, The Longest Memory, the hopes and dreams for equality and racial acceptance is revealed to coerce oppressed individuals to subvert social norms, all in an attempt to gain liberty and fairness. Similarly, Tom Wrightâs play, Black Diggers, explores the collective yearning of oppressed Indigenous Australians who seek to gain a sense of belonging and recognition in society. Both DâAguiar and Wright expose how the obstacles of social inequality, deep-rooted prejudice and beliefs can essentially restrict the fulfilment of such desires and dreams.\n\nTry to keep your introduction to the point. There's no need to prolong an introduction just to make a set number of sentences. It's always better to be concise and succinct, and move into your main body paragraphs where the juicy contents of your essay resides.\n\nBody Paragraph\n\nMost of you will be familiar with TEEL learnt in Text Response. TEEL can stand for:\n\nTopic sentence\n\nExample\n\nEvidence\n\nLinking sentence\n\nIf your teacher or school teaches you something slightly different that's okay too. At the end of the day, the foundations are the same.\n\nIn Comparative, you can still use TEEL, except that you'll be making comparisons between the two texts throughout your paragraph.\n\nThe below example adopts the 'Alternate' Comparative essay structure where the first part of the body paragraph focuses on Text 1 (The Longest Memory) and the second half of the body paragraph focuses on Text 2 (Black Diggers).\n\nThe ambitions of the oppressed are achieved to a certain extent. However, they are not maintained and thus become restricted due to the beliefs and conventions entrenched in society. DâAguiar asserts that a sense of liberation can indeed be achieved in the unjust system of slavery, and this is demonstrated through his characterisation of Chapel. His depiction of Chapel serves as a subversion of the conventional type of slave; he is 'half a slave, half the master' and belongs to 'another way of life'. His defiance and rebellion against the dictations of society is exemplified through his speech, which consists of rhythmic and poetic couplets, filled with flowery language; which ultimately challenges the idea of illiterate slaves. DâAguiar also associates the allusion of the 'two star-crossed lovers' in regards to the relationship between Lydia and Chapel; who were 'forbidden' to 'read together'. Despite this, the two characters take on a form of illicit, linguistic, sexual intercourse with each other, as they 'touch each otherâs bodies in the dark' and 'memorise [their] lines throughout'. Here, DâAguiar illustrates their close intimacy as a form of rebellion against the Eurocentric society, who believed such interrelation between blacks and whites was 'heinous' and 'wicked'. The individualistic nature of Chapel is also paralleled in Black Diggers, where Wrightâs portrayal of Bertie expresses the yearning for a sense of belonging. Just like Chapel, Bertie desires free will, and he decides to 'fight for the country'. This aspiration of his however, is restrained by both his Mum and Grandad; who in a similar manner as Whitechapel, represent the voice of reality and reason. Wright employs the metaphor of the Narrandera Show to depict the marginalisation and exclusion of Aboriginal people, as they will never be 'allowed through the wire', or essentially, ever be accepted in Australia. This notion of exclusion is further reinforced through Bertieâs gradual loss of voice and mentality throughout Wrightâs short vignettes, as he soon becomes desensitised and is 'unable to speak'. Here, Wright seems to suggest that the silenced voices of the Indigenous soldiers depict the eternal suffering they experienced; from both the horrors of war, but also the continual marginalisation and lack of recognition they faced back home. Consequently, DâAguiar and Wright highlight how the ambitions of young individuals are limited by the truths and history of reality, and are essentially rarely achieved.\n\nConclusion\n\nConclusions should be short and sweet. Summarise your main points while comparing the two texts (just as you have throughout your entire essay).\n\nDâAguiar and Wright both illustrate oppressed individuals fighting against the beliefs and conventions of society; in order to gain their freedom and achieve their hopes and dreams. However, both reveal the harsh truths of reality that ultimately inhibit and restrict the capacity of peopleâs ambitions. DâAguiar and Wright compel their readers to try and grasp an understanding of the past of slaves and Aboriginal soldiers, in order to seek remembrance and closure of this fundamental truth. They both convey the need for memories and the past to never be forgotten; and instead remembered and recognised in history.\n\nFor further detail from Sarah (English study score 45), read her advice on 5 Tips For A Mic-Drop Worthy Essay Conclusion.\n\nIf you're looking for more A+ Comparative essay examples, then you can also get your hands on any of our LSG study guide ebooks.

For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nSummary\n\nLewis is faced with a seemingly impossible task â to bring order to the chaotic world of the asylum â yet in the process of doing so, he develops hugely as a person. Although, itâs important not to take Lewisâ development at face value. His growth is used to highlight many of Nowraâs values on issues surrounding love, fidelity, madness and reality, just to name a few. Itâs also important to look at the development (or lack of development) of other characters and think about why Nowra might have included them in the play. Luckily for you, CosÃ¬ is quite a short play and doesnât have a huge cast of characters. However, this means that itâs even more important to get a great understanding of each character â theyâre all there for a reason!Â\n\nTo fully understand this text, youâll need to move beyond analysing characters and dialogue and consider Nowraâs main messages. CosÃ¬ is essentially a social commentary, packed full of criticisms of conventional perspectives and values. Also, CosÃ¬ is full of symbols and imagery, which can help you score highly on your essays if you integrate them into your work. Lastly, it's vital to remember that CosÃ¬ is a play, not a book, and on top of that, it is a play within a play. This means that setting, structure and stage directions are all crucial, and make for a high-scoring essay.\n\nSetting\n\nMelbourne Mental Institution, Australia during the 1970s.\n\nAll of the action takes place inside a burnt-out, derelict theatre. This serves to create an atmosphere of confinement for the audience, encouraging them to reflect on the stifling experience of the patients.\n\nCosÃ¬ is divided into two acts and nine scenes. The play is dominated by Lewisâ development. Act 1 highlights his uncertainty and distance from the world of the asylum. Whereas by Act 2, we see Lewis become more invested in the patients and the asylum, as his relationships with the other characters grow. Lewisâ development is symbolised through the changing imagery throughout the play, specifically fire and water.\n\nCosÃ¬ also is a piece of metatheatre, which Nowra achieves through structuring it as a âplay within a playâ. Metatheatre means that the play draws attention to its distance from reality. This makes sense in relation to CosÃ¬, as Nowra is continually encouraging his audience to accept their own reality instead of falling into escapism. Including CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte in CosÃ¬ also serves to highlight the difference in popular opinion between Mozartâs era and the 1970s, while emphasising the continuity of love. This contrast also helps Lewis to come to terms with his valuation of love over war, which is at odds with the common opinions of his society.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe line between reality and illusion is explored through the characters who are labelled as âinsaneâ as well as those considered ânormal.â Nowra demonstrates that reality is unique for each person, and often people may slip into illusions in order to avoid the truth. It is suggested that although they may not have been completely ânormalâ, those considered to be âinsaneâ still possess great insight that ânormalâ people may overlook. Additionally, CosÃ¬ reminds the reader of the absurdities of a mental asylum shunned by society, which would only have added to patientsâ instabilities, especially as families dealt with the matter secretly. Furthermore, the issue of love and fidelity that was valued so highly in Mozartâs era, is proven to still be relevant in our modern times. Ultimately, CosÃ¬ is a play that criticises traditional structures and views of society â whether they be asylums, university education or harsh stigma. Nowra encourages his audience to accept both the complexity of people and of life, which begins with accepting your own reality.\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nLewis\n\nThe protagonist of CosÃ¬, Lewis is a new university graduate who has agreed to direct a play cast with patients from a mental institution because he needs money. At first, Lewis shares the same values as his friends Nick and Lucy -Â that love is ânot so importantâ in the days of politics and war. During the time he spends with the patients, however, Lewis experiences a turning point in his understanding and perception of people. By the end of the play, Lewis learns to value love and friendship over war and politics, even stating that âwithout love, the world wouldnât mean as muchâ. In emphasising the development of Lewisâ values away from the social norm, Nowra highlights the confining nature of society and the danger of its limited focus, which fails to recognise the value of love and companionship.Â\n\nAdditionally, Nowra blurs the lines between insanity and sanity by portraying Lewis as a bridge between the ârealâ world and that of the asylum. At the beginning of the play, Lewis states that his grandmother was in an asylum. However, despite knowing that âshe had gone madâ, he reflects that âshe was still [his] grandmother.â This, alongside his passion for Julie, enables Lewis to see the patients as people, not their illnesses. Therefore, he subconsciously allows himself to be influenced by them, just as he influences them. This contradicts the traditional views surrounding the unproductivity of the mentally ill and instead highlights their value and worth. Therefore, Nowra warns against dismissing individuals who are mentally ill, instead highlighting their capacity to garner change and therefore be productive and valuable members of society.\n\nMoreover, not only is Lewis involved in directing CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte, but he also finds himself playing the part of Fernando. This again further reinforces his role as a bridge between society and the asylum (and his connection to its patients), and he ends up embodying the role. Like Fernando, Lewis is unfaithful to his partner. While still in a relationship with his girlfriend Lucy, Lewis becomes intimate with a patient, Julie. Nowra uses his unfaithfulness as evidence of the indiscriminate nature of infidelity â it is not restricted only to women.\n\nFinally, CosÃ¬ explores how Lewis deals with a hardship that he essentially created for himself â he signed up to direct the play. This links to Nowraâs view of the senselessness of war, which he views as a problem that mankind has created for themselves.\n\nLucy\n\nGirlfriend and roommate of Lewis, Lucy cannot understand why Lewis is directing a play about love when thousands are dying in the war. She has an affair with Nick, who shares similar beliefs â that politics and the Vietnam War protest are more important than anything else. The flippant nature with which she regards her affair with Nick as purely sexual is also reflective of her lack of value towards love. Thus, Nowra portrays Lucy as a personification of the societal norms of the 1970s â she is political, into free love and challenges traditional notions of femininity.\n\nFurthermore, it is ironic that Lucy and Lewis have similar names. At the start of the play, Lewis allows himself to be influenced by Lucyâs values rather than his own, but by the end, Lewisâ true views prove to be very different from hers.Â\n\nLucy also acts as a catalyst for Lewisâ change and development. She pushes him to âmake a choiceâ between the world of insanity and fidelity that represents truth for Lewis, or the world of sanity, free love and politics that Lewis comes to view as restrictive and stifling.\n\nNick\n\nAn experienced student director, roommate and friend of Lewis who is heavily involved in the moratorium (a protest against the Vietnam War). He promises to help Lewis direct CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte, however he quickly breaks this vow in order to spend time furthering his political career with Lucy. Lewis later discovers that Lucy and Nick are having an affair. Unlike Lewis, however, Nick views his relationship with Lucy as âonly sexâ, therefore suggesting his superficiality and lack of compassion.Â\n\nThis superficiality is further shown through his obsession with the moratorium and his disinterest in Lewisâ CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte. He criticises Lewis for prioritising theatre over politics, stating that âonly mad people in this day and age would do a work about love and infidelity.â This suggests that what drives Nick is a desire to be seen doing the ânormalâ and ârightâ things, rather than an intrinsic belief that what he is doing is good. He views life as a series of transactions and values activities based on the immediate benefit that they bring him. For example, he admitted to helping Lewis with his direction only âso [Lewis would] help [him] on the moratorium committeeâ.Â\n\nOverall, Nick lives up to his label of being an âegotistical pigâ who âlikes the sound of his own voiceâ. He is used by Nowra as a benchmark with which Lewisâ development is compared (i.e. we can see how much Lewis has developed by comparing him to Nick). For example, at the start of the play Lewis shares similar superficial values to Nick, admitting to only take the directing job for a bit of money; however, by the end of CosÃ¬, he holds vastly different views than Nick.\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nThemes\n\nFidelity & Infidelity\n\nAccording to Mozartâs CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte, fidelity is depicted as an ideal that is never achieved. Since âwomen are like thatâ â the interpretation of âCosÃ¬ fan tutteâ, Mozart supported the belief that men should simply accept that women will inevitably be disloyal in relationships. Nowra echoes this view of women through Lewis and Lucyâs relationship. While Lucy is âsleepingâ with Lewis, she is also triflingly âhaving sexâ with Nick. When Lewis discovers Lucyâs betrayal, she waves aside his shock, defending herself, âit is not as if weâre married.â The revelation thus does prove Mozart right, that âwomanâs constancy is like the Arabian Phoenix. Everyone swears it exists, but no one has seen it.â\n\nAlthough the women in both CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte and CosÃ¬ are shown to be unfaithful, so are the men. While the men in CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte do not actively participate in adultery, they do fabricate their departure to the war and also disguise themselves as âAlbanians.â Their deception is also a betrayal to their wives. Meanwhile, Don Alfonso manipulates everyone. As seen in CosÃ¬, Lewis is unfaithful to Lucy as he kisses Julie during rehearsals. Julie later reveals that she has a girlfriend who she would prefer to be with, confirming that both men and women are unfaithful in relationships, despite whatever values they may claim to have.\n\nNowra considers many perspectives of love and fidelity, without offering a definitive opinion. Instead, he explores the progression (or stagnation) of charactersâ opinions on love and contrasts them to those of other characters, in the hope of highlighting its complexity. Nick and Lucy both view love as an indulgence that is incompatible with politics and secondary to lifeâs basic needs. Whereas Lewis claims, âwithout love, the world wouldnât mean that muchâ. These differences between Nick and Lucyâs view on love and Lewisâ, are major contributors to the deterioration of their relationships. Therefore, Nowra shows that communication and truthfulness are needed for healthy, and reciprocal, relationships.\n\nOverall, while CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte presents love and fidelity as wavering, Nowra provides a more practical view of love. Nowra suggests that love is complex and cannot be fully understood or tamed, instead portraying it as akin to madness. As love is universal, this view ties in nicely with his non-judgmental perspective on madness and insanity.\n\nSanity & Insanity\n\nThe line between sanity and insanity is explored through the juxtaposition of the patients and society. In the 1970s, those who behaved abnormally were declared to be âinsaneâ and placed in mental institutions that were shunned by society. As scientific developments have now informed us, these environments often failed to assist their patients. The use of electric shock therapy, for example, frequently led to severe, long-term negative effects upon patients.\n\nWhile the patients were viewed as âmadmenâ by outsiders, Lewis soon discovers that they are, in many ways, ordinary people. Although each patient has a mental flaw, all possess interesting opinions and beliefs on different matters. Additionally, Nowra encourages his readers to view insanity as more complex than a diagnosis or something that can be fixed with a âcoat of paintâ. Instead, he suggests that insanity is imposed on people through the judgment of others.\n\nNowra also attempts to blur the lines between sanity and insanity to emphasize the indiscriminate nature of madness. This is seen through Lewisâ character, who consistently bridges the gap between madness and normalcy. For example, despite his âsaneâ status, he is mistaken for a patient by Justin, joins Roy in imitating electric shock therapy, replaces Doug in the play, and stands with the patients against Justin.\n\nOverall, Nowra portrays insanity as a matter of perspective, rather than an objective diagnosis. He refuses to define madness, instead depicting it as somewhere on the spectrum of human behaviour. In doing so, he critisises traditional perspectives of sanity and insanity and instead encourages his audiences to consider the complexity of madness.Â\n\nReality & Illusion\n\nThe question of what is real or an illusion is weaved through the patientsâ state of mentality. As shown through Ruth who struggles to pretend like she is having real coffee on stage, it is difficult for some to distinguish reality from illusion, even if it is clear to everyone else. For others, they may willingly refuse the truth and succumb to an illusion. Lewis deluded himself into believing that Lucy was faithful, when all signs (such as Nick residing in the same home and Nick and Lucy spending time together) indicated that Lucy was, in fact, blatantly disloyal. Much like Lewisâ protective delusion, Roy uses illusions of a happy childhood to shield him from facing his reality. This builds upon his tendencies to blame others for his behaviour â he is inherently unable to face the truth of his âinsanityâ and so manipulates his reality to make it more bearable.Â\n\nThroughout CosÃ¬, Nowra also explores the relativity of reality. For the patients of the asylum, pretending to give electric shock therapy to others âseems realerâ than âkissing and stuffâ, whereas the opposite would be true in âordinaryâ society. However, CosÃ¬ also suggests that imagination has the capacity to empower. Through participating in the play, which is an illusory form of reality, the patients are able to explore their views on love and commitment.\n\nUltimately, the behaviour of characters such as Roy and Ruth encourages us to consider the reliability (or unreliability) of our own perceptions. Alongside this, Nowra stresses the importance of being able to accept your own reality, as he shows that characters who fail to do so, also fail to experience personal growth (e.g. Roy, Julie).\n\nSymbolism\n\nBurnt-Out Theatre\n\nThe setting of a burnt-out theatre depicts the miserable environment in which the patients of mental institutions are forced to live. As they are ostracised by the community, a lack of care and support is shown through the rejected and deteriorating theatre. The patientsâ considerable enthusiasm highlights their unfortunate circumstances, since even a chance to spend their time in an old building performing a play causes much excitement.\n\nAlthough we see the theatre being touched up with new lights and a âcoat of paintâ, it still remains derelict and run-down. Nowra uses this to symbolise the futility of surface-level treatments (such as medication and isolation) of mental illnesses, and how we should instead focus on seeing the person behind the illness.\n\nHowever, Nowra also uses the theatre as a symbol of hope. Despite its desolation, it is in the theatre that Lewis feels safe to grow and develop. Additionally, Julie and Lewisâ kiss takes place on the theatreâs stage. The kiss itself represents Lewis becoming more comfortable with himself and his increasingly counter-cultural views.\n\nArabian Phoenix\n\nThe women in both CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte and CosÃ¬ are compared with the Arabian Phoenix. The mythical creature is a representation of women, beautiful and enchanting, capturing men such as the god Apollo with its voice. This reflects the power of women to attract men. Nevertheless, its rarity, as often commented on in CosÃ¬ , is linked with the seemingly infrequent loyalty demonstrated by women.\n\nThe frequent reference to the Arabian Phoenix throughout CosÃ¬ continually reinforces the playâs misogynistic undertone. Its rarity is likened to the absence of womenâs fidelity, yet never male fidelity. Similarly, Nowra invites his audience to condemn Lucyâs unfaithfulness towards Lewis, yet we are not encouraged to feel the same way about Lewisâ unfaithfulness to Lucy. Â\n\nLight and Dark\n\nThe lights in Act 1, Scene 1 highlight Lewisâ entrance into a new world, where he befriends patients who will ultimately help him to learn and develop. At first Lewis, much like Lucy and Nick, possesses a âpitch blackâ perspective of the world. This is a representation of their modern beliefs that circulate around politics and war. When the lights are turned on, Roy is present, demonstrating that the patients of the mental institutions are the source for Lewisâ changing perspective throughout the play. Nowra also uses the lights to represent the hope for change that Lewis brings to the patients, and vice versa.\n\nLight is also used to directly juxtapose the chaos and desperation that darkness brings. Before Lewis entered the theatre, it was dark and derelict, symbolising the abandonment and hopelessness of the asylumâs patients. This desperation is viewed in another light during Julie and Lewisâ kiss (which takes place in the dark). In this instance, their desire for each other and the chaos that ensues is liberating for Lewis, as it enables him to come to terms with what he truly values.\n\nHowever, Julie notes that the wards are ânever really darkâ as âthereâs always a light on in the corridor.â In this sense, darkness symbolises autonomy and freedom, whereas light represents the constant monitoring and scrutinising that the patients are subjected to.\n\nEssay Topics\n\n1. CosÃ¬ contends that some things are more important than politics.\n\n2. In CosÃ¬, the âinsaneâ characters are quite normal.\n\n3. The line between reality and illusion is often blurred.\n\n4. Ironically, it is through the âmadmenâ that Lewis learns what is truly important.\n\n5. Nick and Lucyâs âmodernâ value of free love is depicted to be a backwards belief.

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nCharacter-Based Prompt: It is not only Lewis who develops in CosÃ¬, but other characters as well. Discuss.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nSimply spot a characterâs name and there you have it, itâs a character-based prompt. However, itâs important to recognise that your essay does not need to revolve around only the character(s) in the prompt but should also incorporate discussion of other major and minor characters as well.Â\n\nIn this topic, it is important to incorporate other characters, such as the patients, into your essay, because they are crucial to Lewisâ development. To ensure that you stay on topic, it is best to include a paragraph (or paragraphs) that explore characters other than Lewis and their development. Also try and focus on different areas/types of development (i.e. not just Lewisâ changing values).Â\n\nHighlight Key Words:\n\nIt is not only Lewis who develops in CosÃ¬, but other characters as well.Â\n\nFind Synonyms:\n\nDevelops: learns, grows, changes, flourishes, progresses, maturesÂ\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nCosÃ¬ explores the development/growth of multiple characters, including Lewis.Â\n\nLewis is the central catalyst that enables other characterâs development to be seen (such as Ruthâs and Zacâs)Â\n\nHowever, we also see characters who fail to develop. This is either because they fail to accept their own reality (Roy) or they fail to accept the errors in their thinking (Lucy, Nick)Â\n\nNowra also uses Lewis as the benchmark against which the development of other characters is measured. For example, Nickâs lack of development is highlighted through comparing his stagnation/unchanging ways to Lewisâ growth.Â\n\nLewisâ development is facilitated by the patients. Nowra uses this to suggest the productivity of the mentally ill and challenge traditional stereotypes that label them as incapable.Â\n\nThrough Lewisâ development, Nowra highlights the falsity in societal stereotypes of the mentally ill (i.e. Lewisâs views change from being discriminatory and stereotypical to more compassionate, and well founded.)Â\n\nImagery and symbolism are used to represent development and growth (fire and water) as well as Lewisâ catalytic nature (light and dark).Â\n\nStep 3: Create a PlanÂ\n\nContention: Nowra encourages his audience to reconsider their perspective on the mentally ill by highlighting their capacity to not only change themselves, but enact change in others.\n\nTopic Sentence 1: Through his exploration of Lewisâ changing ideals during CosÃ¬, Nowra attempts to highlight the value of companionship and productivity of the mentally ill, which act to increase Lewisâ confidence when faced with adversity.\n\nExamples: Lewisâ changing ideas on love and fidelity, Lewisâ changing levels of subservience to Lucy and NickÂ\n\nEvidence:Â\n\n\"Not so important.\"\n\n\"Without love, the world wouldnât mean as much.\"\n\n\"They are coming to take me away, ha, ha.\"\n\n\"Not sing that.\"\n\n\"I said, donât sing that song.\"\n\nLinking Sentence(s): In contrasting Lewisâ meekness to his boldness, Nowra alludes to the personal benefits that personal growth can have. Additionally, he ultimately encourages his audience to view Lewisâ learning as evidence against the common notion of the unproductivity of the mentally ill, as we see Lewisâ development flourish during his time at the asylum.\n\nTopic Sentence 2: Moreover, throughout CosÃ¬ we see Lewis develop a greater understanding of the complexity of madness due to his partnership with the patients.Â\n\nExamples: Lewisâ changing perspective of the patients, Lewisâ involvement with the patients beyond his role as director, fire and water imageryÂ\n\nEvidence:Â\n\n\"Uncertain.\"\n\n\"Will go bezerk without their medication.\"\n\n\"Unable to believe he has found himself caught up in [directing].\"\n\n\"Water drip[ping] though the hole in the roof.\"\n\nLinking Sentence: Ultimately, through highlighting the development of Lewisâ views towards insanity, Nowra positions his audience to reflect on the complexity of madness and thus warns of the danger of stereotypes.\n\nTopic Sentence 3: Furthermore, as an outsider, Lewis assists the patients in their development, acting as their connection to the real world and ultimately providing a space for them to grow and flourish.Â\n\nExamples: Juxtaposition of light and dark, Ruthâs development.Â\n\nEvidence:Â\n\n\"Chink of light.\"\n\n\"Burnt out theatre.\"\n\n\"Real coffee.\"\n\n\"Real cappuccino machine.\"\n\n\"Wasnât [her], it was the character.\"\n\n\"Time and motion expert.\"\n\nLinking Sentence: Ultimately, Nowra explores the learning and growth of characters in CosÃ¬ to not only highlight the necessity of a humanistic approach to treating mental illness, but also to illustrate the nature of mental health as a continuum, on which no one person needs to be stationary forever.â\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our CosÃ¬ Study Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!
