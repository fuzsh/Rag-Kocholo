        "text": "May 13, 2023\n\nThis is a hard one for me to rate. I so desperately wanted to like it, and for Jennifer Nielsen to live up to her previous books such as The Ascendance Series and The Scourge. I had been unimpressed by her other series that I read, The Traitor's Game, but dare I say it.... this was worse.\n\nFirst of all, the writing. This was my biggest issue with the book. This is the first book that I've read from her in the third person, and I don't know if that just doesn't work for me or if it was something else, but it didn't feel or read like her usual writing at all. It was shallow and told straight-to-the-face and sometimes extremely corny to the point where I had to put the book down for a few seconds to work through my second-hand embarrassment.\n\nThe events in this book and the way the characters acted seemed very unrealistic to me. Not only were the coincidences so extreme that it seems impossible for that to happen in real life, but the characters also (war generals and captains!) were far too kind. Some of them were initially portrayed as gruff and sour, but it seemed like half the time Ms. Nielsen forgot to make the them unique and to stick to their characterization and gave every character the same way of thinking, talking, and doing.\n\nThat's just one way she messed up in the character department, I'm sorry to say. The 'villain' character? He was shown an act of kindness and ‚ú®repented‚ú®. Sweet, but doubtful and cliche. And the way the characters acted in general was simply unrealistic. In the middle of a crucial situation, who (especially someone who hAtEs the the main character and is supposed to be 'mean') has time to try to be nice while disciplining a young girl who vehemently broke your rules? They were always going, \"that was wrong of you... BUT.... you are very skilled and so good at this, and you show great potential, ect. ect.\" And if it had happened once.... okay. But every time Kara was lectured, Ms. Nielsen felt the need to remind us readers how talented she is. How about actually SHOWING us, instead of just telling us? That brings me back to my problem with the writing. It was so tell-not-show that it hurts.\n\nIt also seemed to me that there were a ton of loose ends that weren't tied up, and the ending was rushed. Not only that, but the pacing of the book was off. The first about 100 pages were just uneventful happenings in the lives of Felix and Kara, then by the end it was like BAM BAM BAM done. The five main characters only had two chapters of page time actually together, which was sad. And the ending was *cough* cheesy.\n\nI did like some of the main characters. Felix, in the five chapters that he wasn't an annoying twelve-year-old, honestly made the best character. Juliette and Dimitri were also both sweet (and like SHIPPPP). The plot, with its flaws, coincidences, and off pacing, was pretty interesting overall.\n\nI don't vehemently hate the book, and if you like it I'm glad, but I was definitely not impressed.\n\nHappy reading ü•∞ü•∞\n\nJune 25, 2022\n\nIt is a relief to see a historical fiction book about WWI, not WWII. Author Nielson does not cover too much of the war history, presenting the perspectives of five teenagers from five countries, whose lives intersect in unusual ways. Felix (from Austria-Hungary), watches the assassination that started the war and is worried about his father's role in the war, Kara (from Britain), who accompanies her nurse/mother on a Red Cross train, helping save soldier's lives, and disobeys orders, Juliette (from France), displaced from her home and who gets separated from her mother and brother, Elsa (from Germany), whose father is a high ranking officer leading troops, and Dimitri (from Russia), who is not ready for war, finding himself in France. The characters all share decency and abhor the horrors of war and senseless killing. I liked the strange path of a war medal initially given for heroism that moves among the teenagers as they interact.\n\nOctober 29, 2022\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!\n\nThis book hit me right in the feels.\n\nSuch a roller coaster of a read.\n\nSometimes I was hopping up and down because YESSS CONNECTIONS WERE HAPPENING, sometimes I was struggling not to cry from the horror of the first World War, and sometimes I was casually making notes so I could remember historical facts later because this book was really interesting!\n\nCharacters\n\nI definitely enjoyed reading about Felix and Kara's adventures and encounters, though more so about Juliette's (goodness I love that girl!).\n\nElsa was a good character, but she came off as kind of annoying in the beginning to me, and later during Dimitri's section.\n\nSpeaking of which,\n\nI LOVED DIMITRI SO MUCH! HE'S MY FAVORITE! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ *adds another character to her list of adopted children*\n\nPlot\n\nSuper intriguing, since I know very little about World War I. I feel it's often overshadowed by World War II which is a shame because it is important to learn about and recognize what was going on in the world at the time.\n\nI DEFINITELY did not know that the Russian revolution happened right at the same time, causing the Russians to pull out of the war!\n\nJust wow!\n\nOverall\n\nSo amazing, and I expected nothing less from my favorite historical fiction writer! Mrs. Nielsen is SO GOOD AT THIS STUFF! Which is perfect because I love history and I always grow more curious about our world's past when it's presented in a fascinating and adventurous way!\n\nNot to say that this book didn't pull some reactions of sadness and horror from me.\n\nHistory has its dark moments as well as good ones.\n\nTHIS IS A MUST READ IN MY OPINION!\n\nAs well as Mrs. Nielsen's other historical fiction works such as Rescue, which I'm going to read next (it's a re-read though so I can tell you it's amazing!), or Words On Fire, which was my first Jennifer Nielsen book!\n\nOh oh oh! And Resistance and A Night Divided!\n\nIf you love history, all of her books deliver!\n\nJune 12, 2022\n\nI checked this out since I've enjoyed Nielsen's books in the past and I'm all for more WWI books. For me, it didn't transcend the fact that I am not the intended audience. But I'm glad it exists. I'm sure I would've been all about this book after reading Rilla of Ingleside as a kid.\n\nMay 27, 2022\n\nExcellent! Ties in all sorts of historical facts about WW1 from the various countries in the fight (Austro-Hungarian, French, German, British, Russian)! So neat to listen with my kids and have them remember what we just learned this year in school. Highly recommend if you are teaching WW1!\n\nJune 13, 2022\n\n\"One day, someone will claim victory in the war, but no one will have won.\"\n\nI've tested the waters with a few stories told around the First World War this year, and I've finally found what I was looking for - the story of five young teenagers, spread across Europe, all trying to survive a war no-one can win.\n\nFrom England, to France, to Austria-Hungary, to Russia, to Germany, these teens all meet each other in unexpected ways, culminating in a group effort to save an enemy. I loved that this story truly showed that there was no bad people, and the complexities of why people fought in the war.\n\nThe discovery of Ambulance trains via the story of Juliette, a British girl who wanted to serve in the Red Cross, was entirely new and fascinating to me. I'm not sure I've ever heard of them before, speeding their way through Europe to collect the wounded and patching them up again.\n\nEach of the teens are on harrowing, unforgettable journeys and I enjoyed my time with every one of them and celebrated when they turned back on again in other's stories. I'm looking forward to reading more of Jennifer's work and seeing what she does next!\n\nAugust 17, 2021\n\nI love books that tell multiple stories and then tie them altogether in the end! This one is a fabulous example of that. It tells the stories of five teenagers during World War I whose lives intersect in unexpected ways. Felix (from Austria-Hungary, who witnesses the start of the war and fears for his Jewish family), Kara (from Britain, serving on a Red Cross train), Juliette (from France, displaced from her home and separated from her family), Elsa (from Germany, whose father is a high ranking officer), and Dimitri (from Russia, fighting in France) each give a different perspective on the war. Combining them together into one book provides an exciting and thorough overview of WWI. Highly recommended for grades 5 & up, especially for fans of Echo and Refugee.\n\neARC provided by publisher via Edelweiss\n\nAugust 25, 2022\n\nUm. Wow. Jennifer A Nielson knocked it out of the park again!! I loved the duel POV without getting into the characters head, it really made me feel like I was in that horrible moment in time.\n\nI think I've been reading to much sweet romance lately because (I wanted Words On Fire sweetness) but alas, it did not. *sigh*\n\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\nAmazing book! Want to re-read it already!!!\n\nDecember 2, 2022\n\nThis was such a good book!\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed how Nielsen wove five stories into one amazing and insightful book that vividly portrays Europe during the third bloodiest war in history.\n\nFull review coming to my blog soon. üòÅ\n\nOctober 23, 2023\n\nReally really enjoyed this read!!!! Even though I love history, WW1 is not a war I‚Äôm very knowledgeable on. This was told through 5 teens perspectives each covering a different year and country involved in the war. Then they had crossovers which was cool. So excited to put this into my classroom!\n\nJune 9, 2022\n\nReally great historical fiction about WW1 which doesn‚Äôt have as many fiction books to read about. Thrilling enough for hard core fans, but gentle enough for those who may be more sensitive to war\n\nJune 13, 2022\n\nIt should have been an exciting visit to Sarajevo with his father, but instead Felix Baum, a 12-year old Jewish boy, witnesses the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, and feels he is a coward for not warning anyone when he saw the assassin with a hand grenade. Returning home, the Baums are visited by Major Dressler and his daughter Elsa from Germany, who gives Felix the gift of a carrier pigeon . War is soon declared, and Felix's father is called up. Learning that the Russians are coming, Felix and his mother try to leave Lemberg, but instead run into the cruel Russian Captain Garinov. Felix manages to irritate Garinov and pays dearly for it. Luckily, Elsa and her mother rescue Felix and his mother, enabling them to escape to Vienna.\n\nKara Webb, 13 almost 14, wants to be a Red Cross nurse more than anything, just like her mother. Allowed to accompany her mother on the Red Cross Ambulance train traveling throughout France picking up the wounded at Casualty Clearing Stations, Kara may only act as an orderly, never leaving the train. When the Germans begin using poison gas, the number of wounded increase, then the rail line are destroyed, so everyone has help carry soldiers from the battlefield to the train. When an orderly is injured, Kara is finally allowed to help. But when she rescues and hides an injured enemy soldier named Baum, she is no longer allowed to do anymore work on the train, even after Sergeant Baum leaves. Reaching Verdun around Christmas, Kara meets Juliette Caron, selling items to get money for her family to bribe a German guard to get her father out of their prison. Kara buys a bright red hat, but gives it right back to Juliette.\n\nJuliette and her family try to leave Verdun, but are soon caught by the Germans. Juliette manages to hide in the woods, but the Germans set up camp so close she can't run away without being seen. After falling asleep, she wakes up on Kara's Red Cross train, but now she doesn't know where her mother and two younger brothers are. After two months, Juliette leaves the train, searching for her family and hoping to free her father. In Lille, she runs into an old friend, Monique, who brings her home, but double crosses Juliette, taking her money. Then, the girls are captured by Germans and taken to a farm to work. Monique does help Juliette escape the farm, but then she runs into Major Dressler, who knows and admires her father. Dressler lets her go instead of sending her back to the farm, and she finds herself back on the ambulance train with Kara. Two months later, Juliette is on the road again, looking for her family when she sees an injured young boy and rescues him, bringing him to the cave she has found shelter in.\n\nThe boy's name is Dimitri Petrenko, 14, and he's been serving in the war under Captain Garinov, now a Bolshevik who intensely dislikes him for supporting the Tsar. Garinov sends him into no man's land to get a rifle, where he is knocked unconscious and left for dead. After Juliette nurses him back to health, he returns to his unit, knowing what he now wants is freedom. But as soon as Garinov sees him, he orders Dimitri to lead a charge, one that costs him dearly. When news of the Russian Revolution reaches the trenches. Garinov refuses to fight anymore, wanting to return to Russia. After Garinov's mutiny, Dimitri finds himself fighting with the French in Belgium, where he is taken prisoner by the Germans. Taken to Major Dressler's home to work in Freiburg, Dimitri runs into Captain Garinov, also a prisoner. When Garinov finds an old medal in Dimitri's pocket, he tries to get him in trouble, but Elsa Dressler recognizes the medal as belonging to Felix's family. Convinced he didn't steal it, Major Dressler arranges for Dimitri to be driven to the French border and released. Meanwhile, Garinov has stolen a horse from Dressler and run away.\n\nThe medal that is found on Dimitri is a red thread running through this story and connecting each of the main characters to each other. Felix refused the medal when his father offered it to him. Sergeant Baum had taken it with him to war as a reminder of his own father's courage. He had given it to Kara, who gave it to Juliette. Later, Juliette gave it to Dimitri and Elsa had recognized it.\n\nThe novel begins in 1914, with the assassination of the Archduke and goes through to November 11, 1918, the end of the war. It is a well-researched work and includes information I did not know, for example, the Red Cross Ambulance Train.\n\nBut...\n\nI've always enjoyed Jennifer Nielsen's historical fiction for young readers, but I'm sorry to say, for me, this is not one of her best books. Writing a story about five very different characters from different countries who are connected to one another and including Dressler and Garinov in the mix is hard to do because so much much depends on coincidences not found in reality. And the novel is so filled with coincidences plus the improbability of its five characters running into each other the way they do was just too hard for me to believe. Nielsen does include some interesting WWI history in the story and in her Author's Note, but the multiple story lines overwhelmed me. I felt like she had five short stories and decided to turn it into a novel by knitting them together using a medal from an earlier Austrian conflict, but it just didn't work for me.\n\nI think that given what is going on in Ukraine right now, this would be an interesting novel for anyone interested in history and especially WWI as long as the coincidences doesn't bother them. It is of note that so many young teens were asked to do the job of adults in this war. I can't imagine sending 14-year-olds to war, but I know it could happen again.\n\nThank you to Edelweiss+ and Scholastic Press for providing me with a digital review copy of this novel.\n\nFebruary 1, 2023\n\nI liked this book a lot. I can't decide if it is YA or middle grade, so I am saying it is 7th-10th grade-ish. It ties up a little too perfectly for YA, but it is a smidge too complicated for 6th grade. I guess it depends on the maturity level of the reader. Summary: WWI through the eyes of five protagonists: Felix from Austria-Hungary who witnessed the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand; Elsa, whose father is a German officer; Kara, from the UK works with her mother on a Red Cross train in France; Juliette, a French girl who is separated from her family in the battle of Verdun; and Dimitri, a Russian soldier sent to the front without a weapon. Each of these characters ages range between 12-15 and they grow as the war wages on over the years.\n\nI like that this book is about WWI. I have found very little historical fiction about the first world war, especially for this age group. I also feel like this time period isn't covered very well in history classes either. We seem to skip from the Civil War to WWII. Having the story told from the many perspectives shows why the war was being fought and it shows how there is not one central purpose, that every country was in it for different reasons and there is no real consistency or solidarity. This book makes me want to research more. The author also has great notes in the back and I learned many new things. I had no idea that the Red Cross had hospital trains.\n\nI also felt that there are a lot of quotable parts of the book to teach kids moral lessons, like these:\n\n\"There is a fire within each of us. If you fuel that fire with anger, it will burn all of your happiness. But if you fuel it with courage, then the fire will give you strength to do difficult things... Anger will not get us through the war, Anger is the war.\" p. 45-6\n\n\"Life is messy. It's a line that moves in circles, and weaves itself into the circles that others have created. Our lines should be messy, because that's how our lives connect together.\" p. 373\n\nI like the connectedness the author weaves through these characters' lives. I also like that the book begins with the Archduke's assassination and ends on Nov. 11, 1918 (I know so many people who don't know that is why we celebrate veteran's day on Nov. 11). It even touches on the Spanish Flu a bit. My only problem with this book is how it wraps up so perfectly... even one of the worst antagonists has a change of heart which is completely unbelievable... making this a more juvenile book. But, that is not such a bad complaint I guess, considering all the teachable moments in this book whether they are about history or ethics. Plus, it's a super quick read. Recommend!\n\nOctober 29, 2022\n\ni am so excited for this book to be released. i fell in love with nielsen's historical fiction books before any of her other ones, and am so ready for another historical fiction. i've been waiting and waiting...and it's almost here!!!\n\n*fangirl squeal*\n\ni'm also super duper excited for these characters! how could you not be?!?\n\nUPDATE:\n\nwow. i loved this. rtc\n\nUPDATED UPDATE:\n\nFor everyone out there who loves history like me, read this book.\n\nJennifer Nielsen can describe the horrors of war so delicately laced with its beauties so well. The kindness of the characters that represent those few selfless souls in hard times like WWI really moved me. Especially since WWI is a time in history so many people brush over.\n\nThe characters were all truly amazing in their own ways. I enjoyed reading the book from each of their perspectives and getting to know them each. I'd probably say Demitri was my favorite. His story of being a young soldier was both inspiring and heart-wrenching. I also did love Juliette and her perseverance. The way all the characters end up helping each other in such grand ways is just lovely.\n\nIt was really just an outstanding story. I highly recommend reading this, as well as Nielsen's other historical fiction novels.\n\nHappy Reading!\n\nRead\n\nMay 22, 2022\n\nThis is one of the few books I‚Äôve read that I won‚Äôt rate. This book is meant solely for middle grade readers. I gave this a try since I was interested in the time period and gave it a chance on a whim. Knowing this isn‚Äôt for me whatsoever and I don‚Äôt have a positive opinion of the book, I won‚Äôt give a star rating.\n\nThe book does a good job featuring kids at the center of the action doing heroic things. Kid readers will clearly love relating to these characters. The book also provides some basic introductory information about WWI. The history element of the book is very superficial, but could be a good way to engage kids with history. And that‚Äôs all this book wanted to be so I can‚Äôt fault it for that.\n\nHowever, I do not recommend this book for adults. The story relies heavily on chance encounters and impossible scenarios that no amount of suspension of disbelief can ignore. All of the characters seem to be all knowing about events in the war no child would know and converse with each other with the hindsight of future historians. They understand the implication of events as if they could see decades into the future. Tragic events also get glossed over extremely quickly without giving the characters hardly any chance to grieve or deal with trauma. This is done purposely to teach kids about history, but it weakens the narrative because it‚Äôs unrealistic.\n\nIf you have a young reader in the home that likes these types of stories or want to branch out to historical fiction, I think this is worthwhile to pick up. But I think the author could do more creating historical fiction aimed at younger readers without dumbing it down so much.\n\nAugust 16, 2024\n\nI started reading this book in and May and took a break from it to read Don Quixote. And let me tell you that was a huge mistake!!\n\nDon Quixote is an adult book that supposed to contain many intriguing stories and adventures. WELL IT DOESN‚ÄôT!!! I picked up lines of courage the same day of finishing Don Quixote, and I felt my passion for reading reborn in an instant.‚ú®\n\nHonestly this book teaches many lessons, building courage to take risks at the most frightening moments of your life, maintaining friendships, and to never stop and cry about your struggles, but to keep pushing forward.\n\nLines of Courage >>> Don Quixote\n\nSeptember 1, 2022\n\nHard to imagine kids going through the things these kids did.\n\nDecember 17, 2022\n\nI really liked this book. I am a military historian and I still learned a lot from this book. While it is written for young adults, this is also a book for teens and adults. The elements of the story are real and hard hitting. While the characters are mostly teens, they tell a powerful story about a war that most AMericans know very little about.\n\nJune 27, 2022\n\nThis is a great book! It took a little for me to get into it but I found it so interesting. I have not read much about World War 1 so that historical perspective really drew me in. Highly recommend.\n\nApril 3, 2022\n\nIt's hard to imagine a more relevant middle-grade novel for these turbulent times. Though set in the thick of war-torn Europe during World War I, the themes of demonic despotic rule, innocent wartime slaughter of innocents, and families torn apart by war are prescient of today's newsflashes as they are laid out here in the thrillingly interconnected lives of preteens/young teens Felix (Austrian), Kara (British), Juliette (French), Elsa (German), and Dimitri (Russian). Though separated by language and culture, these five young people have in common a strong ethical sense and sense of justice (in most cases, instilled by their parents); and though all are keenly aware of their powerlessness against the overwhelming odds against their survival, and the political forces that would throttle them, they are driven to tap whatever reserves of courage they can muster deep within their youthful selves not just to save themselves, but also other teens--and adults--who cross their paths desperately seeking some kind of help. We get a front-row seat to unvarnished battlefield scenes, the frazzled life aboard a Red Cross train, and neighbors turning on neighbors as the progress of the war takes one awful turn after another. How did Ms. Nielsen know when she wrote this adventure how tragically Putinesque and Ukrainian the ideologies and scenes she created fictionally would eventually come to be on the real world stage in 2022? Middle-grade students and teachers would be remiss to miss reading and discussing this authentic and ultimately uplifting book in their Language Arts and Social Studies classrooms, in any land or language. Thank you, Ms. N.--long may you share your vital gifts!\n\nSeptember 29, 2023\n\n4.5 ‚òÜ rounded up\n\nOk, so. My second ever review.\n\nFirst of all, I just want to say that this book was amazing. The characters had a lot of depth, though not so much that the backstories got boring. I've rarely read book about WWI, so at first, it was a little confusing, figuring out everything in my head, but the authors note at the end actually did help a lot.\n\nIt surprised me that the book was in third person, as I think the rest of Jennifer Nielsen's other books aren't, but I think she did an amazing job doing it, especially with the switched perspective.\n\nNow for like, the summary part.\n\nKara, a teenaged girl from Britain, longs to become a nurse. She wants to earn her Red Cross pin by working on a train that helps wounded soldiers.\n\nDimitri, from Russia, needs to survive. He is fighting the war against the Germans, weaponless and underage to be a soldier.\n\nJuliette, a spirited young girl from France, has to reunite with her family, who she's been separated form, and rescue her imprisoned father.\n\nYoung Austrian-Hungary boy, Felix, wishes to have the courage to stand up to the soldiers who want to deport the Jews, which includes him and his family.\n\nAnd Elsa, a girl (who uses the word 'most' a lot) from Germany, relies on her homing pigeon to help her find allies in this devastating wartime.\n\nTogether, the five of them will aid each other in survival, and help them find what they need most- courage to fight, to live. To be free.\n\nThere. My beautiful explanation. Anyway, there's my review. Bye\n\nApril 6, 2022\n\nJennifer Nielsen has a way of creating characters who are caught in impossible circumstances yet the reader can completely relate to. This time she focuses her attention on WWI and five strangers from the five empires involved in war who come together by fate and guide each other in kindness and strength. Even though their paths are woven together they are fighting a war they don't understand, traveling from their homeland where many of them don't know the fate of the families they left behind, wounded, imprisoned or lost. These young people stand by their convictions and offer help to those who are not only strangers but in some instances - enemies as dictated by war. These stories of courage, strength and friendship are usually overshadowed by the horrors of war but in this author's capable hands we see the human side that balances the evil. Riveting historical fiction expertly told that will appeal to middle grades and young adult alike. My thanks to the publisher for the advance copy.\n\nJune 5, 2022\n\n‚ÄúThere is a fire within each of us. If you fuel that fire with anger, it will burn all your happiness. But if you fuel it with courage, then the fire will give you strength to do difficult things.‚Äù (45-46)\n\nJennifer Nielsen has become my history teacher. I learned about the rise of the Berlin Wall from A NIGHT DIVIDED, about the Russian occupation of Lithuania (1795-1918) from WORDS ON FIRE, more about Nazi-occupied Poland from reading RESISTANCE, and the French Resistance from RESCUE.\n\nMy father once told me the story about how, as a 6-year-old, he finally was able to walk to the candy store by himself to buy some penny candy. Imagine his excitement! And imagine his disappointment to discover that the store was closing at that very moment. World War I had been declared. A war which meant nothing to a little boy from Pittsburgh. World War I also had little meaning for me, just more dates and names. In Nielsen‚Äôs newest novel, LINES OF COURAGE, I learned more in the first chapter about this war than from my high school history classes, seeing the events which precipitated the war from the up close perspective of a young adolescent.\n\n‚ÄúOne of the most effective ways to learn about any historical event, and the nuances and effects of those events, is through a novel study‚Äîthe power of story. Every historical event is distinct and affects people and places uniquely‚Äîand each is surrounded by misconceptions, misunderstandings, miscommunications, and differing and shifting perspectives. We may learn about history through textbooks and lectures, but we experience history through novels. And when we live it, we learn it; we do not merely learn about it. We discern the complex issues, and we feel empathy for all affected. We bear witness to the events we read and the plights of the people affected by those events.‚Äù (‚ÄúLearning History through Story‚Äù http://www.drbickmoresyawednesday.com...)\n\nIn Lines of Courage readers experience the war from all perspectives, the Allies and the Central Powers, through the stories of five adolescents: Felix, a young Jew from Austria-Hungary; Kara from Britain whose burning ambition is to earn her Red Cross pin; Juliette from France whose father has been imprisoned; a too-young soldier, Dimitri from Russia; and Elsa from Germany who raises homing pigeons. From June 1914 to November 11, 1918, their stories span the timeline of war. And, as unlikely as it seems, their paths cross as the each find courage to be saved and to save.\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶that is life. Mademoiselle, something will always be in your way. So draw your line around it and keep going. You will find your family again, but it will come at the end of a long and crooked path.‚Äù (230)\n\nA novel for both ELA and Social Studies/History classes.\n\nAugust 15, 2022\n\nBlending together the stories of five different main characters creates an interesting challenge for an author. Jennifer A. Nielsen takes that challenge and runs with it. She's written a compelling, remarkable tale about five young people who experience a variety of heartaches and struggles during World War I. World War I is written about less in children's literature than World War II is, although to truly understand World War II, it helps to have a basic understanding of World War I since the first World War directly led to the second.\n\nNielsen starts readers off by placing one of her young characters, Felix, a young Jewish boy, witnesses the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and his wife. After seeing his father off to war, Felix and his mother get stuck in the city when the Russians arrive quicker than expected. Somehow Felix is going to have to find the courage to escape with his mother, before they are exiled to an internment camp with the other Jews. Kara from Great Britain, joins her mother on an ambulance train hoping to eventually become a nurse, but she two must find her courage when faced with a difficult choice that might cost her everything. Juliette flees from Verdun with her mother and two brothers. When she gets separated from them she must find a way to survive until she can find a way to free her father and be reunited with the rest of her family. Dimitri's been sent to the front lines to fight with no training and no weapon. He must face the horrors of war while wrestling with his own conscience regarding his fellow Russians disloyalty to the Tsar and his dreams of freedom. And as the war comes to a close, Elsa confronts growing discontent and anger on the home front as food becomes scarce and her father becomes a target of mobs.\n\nIt's amazing the way the author weaves together the stories of each of these young people as each of them must find and exercise courage during the war. I found myself cheering on each character as he or she made difficult, courageous decisions that often led to unforeseen consequences. As with her other books, Nielsen tells a story that seeps into your heart and inspires you to seek to find your own courage in the face of life's difficulties. It's fascinating the way the author also managed to give the reader a glimpse into many different sides of the war. There are characters from both sides as well as from five different countries and backgrounds. As with any book about war, there are multiple tragedies and threats that surround each character. Nielsen has been careful to avoid being overly graphic, but every character faces terrifying and difficult situations. This book is fabulous historical fiction, the kind that I love to hand to my older students.\n\nJune 10, 2022\n\nFirst sentence: Deep inside, Felix knew something was wrong.\n\nPremise/plot: Lines of Courage is historical fiction (middle grade audience) set during the first world war. The novel opens on June 28, 1914 and concludes on November 11, 1918. The novel doesn't only span the entire war, it also spans Europe. There are FIVE protagonists--five protagonists from five different countries, from both sides of the war. The protagonists are Felix (from Austria-Hungary), Elsa (from Germany), Kara (from Britain), Juliette (from France) and Dimitri (from Russia). (At first I was skeptical as to how these separate stories could come together cohesively. But by the end, I saw.)\n\nMy thoughts: At first I was skeptical about having FIVE protagonists. That is a LOT of narrators for readers to have to get to know, to come to care for, to become engaged with. It is a big undertaking. For better or worse--my opinion better--the chapters do not alternate. The book is divided into five sections. Each narrator has his or her own section, and narrates a portion of the war. At the end, readers revisit all five protagonists on Armistice day (November 11).\n\nMy expectations were different coming into this one. I expected ONE narrator, one story. But by the end, I'd come around to HOW this story is told. I think it works. It may not have had me at hello, but, slowly but surely I came to care for this story. The war is bigger than one person's story.\n\nApril 11, 2023\n\nThis is my first Jennifer A Nielsen book and will not be my last. I‚Äôve been curious to learn more about WWI and love her decision of using five POVs to show a different side to the war. If I was to rank in my favorite order it would be: Juliette, Dimitri, Felix, Elsa, Kara. I definitely feel some of the POVs were stronger (I think Juliette‚Äôs story could have been it‚Äôs own book). I can also agree with what I‚Äôve seen others say about how some of it feels forced/unrealistic with joe the 5 of them overlap‚Äîfor me the epilogue was very much this way. I can also sense that this is for a younger audience so I wasn‚Äôt bothered by how some things were described. It was informative and I appreciated the author‚Äôs note at the end.\n\nOctober 10, 2023\n\nThis book really illuminates the fact that there are good and bad people on all the sides and how you cannot go hating a certain country or screaming about how they should be pitied and helped. Because only certain people or groups are the cause of troubles or good. I really enjoyed reading Lines of Courage because the author wrote it in a way that made it impossible for me to choose sides, even knowing which countries were the Allies and which were the Axis. Jennifer Nielsen points out how there were bad people on all sides and propaganda all around to keep people against each other, continue the war, and try to convince people that their country was winning and the best."
