        "text": "With Thanks to our Matching Donors\n\nAntisemitic sentiment and violent acts were already on the rise before Covid-19 struck. Inevitably, the pandemic has become another pretext to attack Jews online and off and to spread anti-Jewish conspiracy theories, tropes and prejudices.\n\nUnfortunately, this is just a centuries-old story repeating itself.\n\nThat’s why now, more than ever, young Jews need to be inspired by heroes who were not afraid to stand up for themselves and the Jewish people when antisemitism struck.\n\nHeroes like Menachem Begin.\n\nBut, to make this a reality, we need your support.\n\nWe are collaborating with Hidden Light Institute to produce the educational version of their upcoming feature length film on Menachem Begin, which documents the life and story of Israel’s sixth prime minister.\n\nThe documentary presents Menachem Begin’s many faces as a fighter, prisoner, outlaw, leader and peacemaker who never compromised when the dignity and survival of Israel and the Jewish people was at stake. This film brings an authentic and unflinching look at a man who challenged antisemitism and helped define the modern State of Israel.\n\nBut this is far more than just another film.\n\nIt’s a call to action, challenging us to live up to the uncompromising vision and pride of one of Israel's most important leaders. It’s a call that young Jews across the world need to hear.\n\nBut to make the educational version of this documentary a reality, we need YOUR help.\n\nTogether, we can fulfill our goal of inspiring a new generation with Menachem Begin’s moral courage and honest leadership.\n\nWith your help, we can teach young Jews about a man who stood up when the fate of Israel and the Jewish people was in doubt and who sought to combat propaganda and untruths being spread about Israel and the Jewish people.\n\nWith your help, we can instill young Jews with a pride in being Jewish and bolster their confidence now, when it’s needed the most.\n\nThanks to an incredible group of donors, every single dollar you give to this campaign will be matched, doubling the power of your generous donation.\n\nPlease donate today.\n\nImagination Productions, Inc. DBA Jerusalem U is registered as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization (tax ID #26-1264680)."
