        "text": "FILE - In this July 1981 file photo released by The White House, U.S. President Ronald Reagan, left, and Vice President George Bush go horseback riding at Camp David, Md. He capped it off by beating one of his granddaughters at Mario Kart during his first presidential visit to Camp David, the historic retreat for U.S. leaders. That’s what Camp David has traditionally offered presidents: a respite from Washington where they can shed their ties and relax with family. Bill Clinton tried to replicate that diplomatic alchemy when he invited Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to Camp David for Mideast peace talks in 2000. He said when foreign leaders descend on Camp David, it can be like an “adult sleepover.”“Going to camp in the cabins creates an atmosphere where leaders are very close together.\n\nMondays El Al flight LY971 marked the first-ever direct flight from Israel to the United Arab Emirates, placing a significant stamp on this months historic U.S.-brokered deal to normalize relations between the two nations. While this is a historic flight, we hope it will start an even more historic journey for the Middle East and beyond, he said. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said it hurts us very much to see the Israeli plane landing in the UAE. \"We would have liked to have an Emirati plane landing in liberated Jerusalem, but we live in a difficult Arab era, Shtayyeh said. For veteran El Al purser Hedva Opatovsky, the flight marked a fitting final journey for her 46 years of air travel."
