        "text": "Focusing on the character and personality of Menachem Begin, Gerald Steinberg and Ziv Rubinovitz offer a new look into the peace negotiations between Israel and Egypt in the 1970s. Begin's role as a peace negotiator has often been marginalized, but this sympathetic and critical portrait restores him to the center of the diplomatic process. Beginning with the events of 1967, Steinberg and Rubinovitz look at Begin's statements on foreign policy, including relations with Egypt, and his role as Prime Minister and chief signer of the Israel-Egypt peace treaty. While Begin did not leave personal memoirs or diaries of the peace process, Steinberg and Rubinovitz have tapped into newly released Israeli archives and information housed at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and the Begin Heritage Center. The analysis illuminates the complexities that Menachem Begin faced in navigating between ideology and political realism in the negotiations towards a peace treaty that remains a unique diplomatic achievement.\n\nGerald M. Steinberg is Professor of Political Science at Bar Ilan University, and founder of the Graduate Program on Conflict Management and Negotiation. He is author of Satellite Reconnaissance: The Role of Informal Bargaining and (with Anne Herzberg and Jordan Berman) of Best Practices for Human Rights and Humanitarian NGO Fact-Finding.\n\nZiv Rubinovitz teaches at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Reichman University, and is a Research Fellow at the Chaikin Chair for Geostrategy, University of Haifa.\n\n\"\n\nIlluminating, well-researched, well-integrated, smooth, and authoritative.\n\n\" ~Gil Troy, author of Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight against Zionism as Racism\n\n\"\n\nMenachem Begin is presented as a forceful figure in events preceding, during, and after the negotiations in concluding a peace agreement that he felt was in Israel's strategic interests both in order to significantly curtail military threats to Israel and to maintain and improve the important Israeli relationship with the United States.\n\n\" ~Yael S. Aronoff, author of The Political Psychology of Israeli Prime Ministers: When Hard-Liners Opt for Peace\n\n\"A painstakingly researched and nuanced examination of Begin's contribution to the success of the peace talks.\"\n\n~Jerusalem Post\n\n\"The book is a useful Israel-centered counterweight to the existing, mostly US-centered literature.\"\n\n~H-Diplo\n\n\"Steinberg and Rubinovitz's book is an important and valuable contribution to our understanding of the Israeli–Egyptian peace process and one that deserves to be read widely.\"\n\n~Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs\n\n\"In many ways, this volume is insightful and valuable, adding to the existing literature on Menachem Begin and his rightist, nationalist government.\"\n\n~The Middle East Journal\n\n\"One of the challenges in analyzing Begin's role and positions in the Camp David process—indeed, his legacy in general—is the fact that he never published memoirs, or even gave fulsome interviews after leaving office. The authors of [Menachem Begin and the Israel-Egypt Peace Process] seek to restore Begin to his central and essential role.\"\n\n~Joshua Krasna, Bustan: The Middle East Book Review"
