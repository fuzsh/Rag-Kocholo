        "text": "Discussions around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict tend to rely upon a binary distinction of the Arab inhabitants of Palestine and the Zionist movement to establish a “national home of the Jewish people” there. This oversimplifies and erases the position of those whose identities are both Jewish and Arab, and the existence of Jewish communities in Palestine long before the ‘national home’ was proposed. The Zionist movement created new tensions between Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jewry who had previously co-existed in relative harmony under Ottoman rule, as the Ashkenazi population began to dominate the Palestinian Jewish community and Zionism defined itself in terms starkly incompatible with Arab identity. From the Old Yishuv of the Ottoman Era to the establishment of the Israeli state (and beyond) Zionist rhetoric has been characterised by a deeply contradictory relationship to non-European Jewry, treating them as a burden whilst relying on them to make the Zionist project workable. Additionally, contrary to the promise of safety associated with the 'Jewish National Home,' the Zionist movement has profited from the persecution of Jews in the Arab world, relying on displacement of Jewry from populations such as Egypt and Iraq due to anti-Semitism to legitimise and strengthen the National Home.\n\nIn mainstream scholarship, David Ben-Gurion is described as one of the main supporters and primary advocates of the policy of encouraging mass Jewish immigration to Israel (aliya) in the 1950s. The Zionist movement had two different motives for supporting aliya: Diaspora Jews’ need for a safe haven (which would require mass aliya), and the need to build a solid and stable Jewish society in mandatory Palestine/Israel (which would require selective aliya). When Ben-Gurion, in the 1940s, came to favor mass aliya, he did so because of the immigrants potential contribution to the attainment of statehood and then the independent state. In the first years after independence, when entire communities immigrated to Israel, they included old and infirm people who did not fit the image of the pioneers of pre-state aliya. Nevertheless, for Ben-Gurion, their demographic contribution outweighed the burden of their absorption. By 1952, he had changed his mind and became one of the strongest supporters of selective immigration. He continued to support selectivity even when, in 1955, the safety of Moroccan Jews and their freedom to emigrate was in jeopardy. Ben-Gurion’s attitude to aliya from Morocco, in the shadow of the Czech-Egyptian arms deal, reflected his priority—a strong and secure Israel.\n\nSince the late nineteenth century and the emergence of the Zionist idea, the Land of Israel – after 1948, the State of Israel – has been presented as a shelter where Jews would build a state of their own and put aside their past life and experience in the diaspora. The return of the Jews to the Land of Israel would bring about the emergence of a new “Hebrew” man and woman, of a unified and rejuvenated people, speaking a common language and sharing one ethno-national identity. In fact, Zionism viewed the diaspora (think of the idea of shlilat ha-galut) as a set of negative parentheses in Jewish history, something to be forgotten and substituted with other (national) memories. So the ideology and policies built on that basis before and especially after the founding of the State of Israel intended to erase the diasporic origin of the (Israeli) Jew and support this Jew’s feeling of having grown up in a void and of originating as a tabula rasa of sorts in Israel. Socialist Zionism and an originally European (Ashkenazi) identity became the hegemonic models to which Jewish migrants would need to conform. However, despite efforts to gather all the Jews from the diaspora in Israel and fuse them as part of the so-called mizug galuyiot (“ingathering of exiles”), since its beginnings and especially in the last few decades the country has paradoxically experienced the emergence of new, Israeli, diasporas.\n\nSince the biblical times, the Land of Israel has been the centre of focus, both spiritually and theologically. The historical roots, culture and the religious identity of the Jewish people – within Israel – can be traced back many centuries, even before Judaism was formally unified and centralised (Safran, 2005). Moreover, the existence of Judaism and its adherents within Israel can be seen perpetually throughout history. This further implies the spiritual and theological importance and role of the Holy Land from a Jewish perspective. However, over time, the perception and interpretation of Judaism and its teachings have changed dramatically: from Orthodox, to Conservation and then Reform. Therefore, this essay will briefly assess the relationship between the Jewish Diaspora and the state of Israel throughout history. In addition, the findings will be supplemented with an examination and overview of the Orthodox and Reform perspectives on the modern state of Israel.\n\nThis article seeks to add another dimension to the growing and extensive research on right-wing Zionism, by returning to an era when the Likud was first created. I will examine the major difference between processes that have led to the two key landmarks in the formative years of the Right in Israel: the establishment of Gahal in April 1965 and the founding of the Likud in August–September of 1973. While Gahal's establishment was a product of a prolonged, determined, patient and conscious effort on the part of Menachem Begin, the establishment of the Likud was, to a considerable degree, forced upon him. Those who were interested in expanding Gahal and creating an alignment of centre-right parties were actually the factors outside Herut, while Herut's more veteran leadership disapproved of these attempts. Within the Herut Movement, the voices that called for the creation of a broad political alignment were those that came from Herut's ‘internal opposition’, which revolved around Ezer Weizman. The article analyses the reasons behind Begin's reservations about a continued right-wing merger, examines the negotiation process and sheds light on the oscillation in Menachem Begin's ideology and politics between the fundamental and the pragmatic poles.\n\nThe focus of this article is the 1958 \"Who is a Jew?\" controversy and David Ben-Gurion's inquiry into Jewishness leading intellectuals from Israel and the Diaspora regarding how to register a child born to a non-Jewish mother in the Israeli identity card. The article's main claim is that this correspondence must be understood not only as reflecting a continuous struggle between diaspora and Israeli Jews or between Jews of various religious persuasions, but rather as reflecting a built-in tension between pan-Jewish solidarity and Israeli Jewish sovereignty. This built-in tension seems to prevail today as well, and thus our analysis of the 1958 event may enable a more complex understanding of the continuous and seemingly unresolved tensions within today's Jewish world."
