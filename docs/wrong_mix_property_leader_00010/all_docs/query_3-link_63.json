In 1948, David Ben-Gurion carried his associates with him to declare statehood and independence, disregarding the uncertain odds and Secretary George Marshall’s dire admonition. In the aftermath of the June 1967 War, Levy Eshkol’s government , coping with a complex new reality, failed to make a decision regarding the disposition of the territories captured in the Sinai, the Golan Heights, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. Israel thus drifted into a new reality and is still grappling with its ramifications. Israel has had nine prime ministers since Eshkol’s death in 1969, and all had to deal with what became the governing issue of Israeli politics and policies. Of the nine, three sought to perpetuate the status quo (Golda Meir, Yitzhak Shamir, and Benjamin Netanyahu, at least thus far); two tried in vain to change it radically (Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert); and three (Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin, and Ariel Sharon) managed to effect significant breakthroughs. Our interest in the decisions and actions of Begin, Rabin, and Sharon —the 1979 Peace Treaty with Egypt, the 1993 Oslo Accords, and the 2005 unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip—is twofold. They all took bold decisions and were able to get them through the Israeli political system and through the regional and international environment. And all three 194 sTaTecrafT went against the grain of their own record, image, and perceived ideological core. A closer look at each of those episodes should offer fresh insights into the nature of leadership in modern and contemporary Israel as well as into the relationship between the leaders and those they led in the Israeli context. Menachem Begin and the Peace with Egypt In the aftermath of the 1967 War, Menachem Begin and his party (Gahal —the block composed of the Herut and Liberal parties) were staunch supporters of preserving the territorial status quo. The Land of Israel Movement, newly formed by individuals who represented the full spectrum of Israeli politics and intellectual life, advocated the view that Israel was entitled and, indeed, had a duty to keep the territorial gains of the Six-Day War. The argument was twofold. Ideologically, it was argued that this was the Land of Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people, and the State of Israel was entitled to occupy the full territory of the ancient homeland. Others made a national security argument stating that the crisis of May 1967 proved that the armistice lines of 1949 were not defensible and that Israel deserved the defensible borders created by the outcome of the Six-Day War. Menachem Begin and his party were not part of this movement, but they subscribed to the same ideology and national security arguments. They laid claim to all territory captured in 1967, but their more forceful claim was laid to the Land of Israel or, to use the term they actually disliked, Palestine. On the eve of the Six-Day War, Menachem Begin and his party joined the national unity government that was formed in order to enable Prime Minister Eshkol to steer the country through the crisis on the basis of a broad national consensus. They stayed in Eshkol’s coalition in the aftermath of the war, contributing significantly to the government’s failure to take any bold action regarding the future of the territories captured in the course of the war. It should be mentioned in this context that on June 19, 1967, in the war’s immediate aftermath, Eshkol’s cabinet passed a resolution inviting Egypt and Syria to sign peace agreements “on the basis of the international boundary and Israel’s security needs.” Menachem Begin voted for this resolution, which drew a sharp distinction between the ter- [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-07-24 10:02 GMT) Three Israeli Prime Ministers 195 ritories captured from Egypt and Syria and the territories of Mandatory Palestine, and in fact offered Egypt and Syria less than full withdrawal. This position was eroded over time as the post-1967 reality settled in. When in August 1970 Golda Meir’s government accepted Secretary of State William Rogers’s “initiative” (as distinct from his 1969 “plan”), which ended the “war of attrition” with Egypt in the Sinai, Begin and his party withdrew from the government. They stayed out..."
