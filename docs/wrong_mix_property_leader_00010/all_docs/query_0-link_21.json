        "text": "The Center was founded in 1993 by Dr. Thomas O. Hecht, a Canadian Jewish community leader, as a non-partisan and independent institute affiliated with the political science department at Bar-Ilan University, Israel. It was named in memory of Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat (BEgin-SAdat), whose groundbreaking Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty laid the cornerstone for conflict resolution in the Middle East.\n\nOver the past 24 years, the Center has produced over 2000 original research and policy papers as well as 25 books. It has conducted more than 800 symposia and international conferences — for defense, military industry, and intelligence and foreign policy specialists, as well as diplomats, businesspeople, academics and politicians.\n\nOn June 14, 2009, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu chose the BESA Center podium as the venue for announcing his historic acceptance of the two-state solution.\n\nAdvances\n\nCenter researchers were the first to generate a debate about the problematic aspects of Palestinian statehood in important international scholarly publications such as Survival and The Journal of Strategic Studies.\n\nCenter researchers published detailed studies warning of the danger of Arab chemical and biological weapons and missile stocks – long before anyone else took note of the threat from Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Iran.\n\nIsrael’s relations with key countries such as Turkey and India were incorporated into the Center’s core research agenda in the 1990s.\n\nThe dangers of radical Islam; the myths of Palestinian demography; the abuse of international institutions in the attempt to delegitimize Israel – all were put on the public agenda by Center researchers.\n\nToday, the Center leads an attempt to introduce creative thinking about alternatives to the entrenched two-state paradigm in Israeli-Palestinian peace diplomacy as well as an initiative to nourish U.S.-Israeli relations."
