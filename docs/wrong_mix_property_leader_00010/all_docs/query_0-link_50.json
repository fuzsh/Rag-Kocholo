The ongoing war in Gaza has created a political atmosphere in Israel that is highly charged and partisan. Therefore, it was agreed by the group that Forward Thinking would help to facilitate an external space for intensive and introspective conversations. The aim will be to bring them together with selected political leaders involved in previous peace processes to talk about themes identified by the group.\n\nDuring discussions the following areas were prioritised: political leadership, the impact of trauma on political decision making, and political compromise during times of conflict."
