We carry out our work in coordination with our partners, the Palestine Red Crescent Society and Magen David Adom in Israel.\n\nThe ICRC has been present in Israel and the occupied territories (including the Golan, West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Shebaa Farms) since 1967. As a neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian organization, we promote compliance with international humanitarian law (IHL) and work to mitigate the impact of armed conflict, other violence and occupation on civilians through our protection activities and assistance programmes.\n\nFor example, the ICRC visits detainees in Israeli and Palestinian places of detention and strives to maintain family links through the Family Visit Programme. We also support projects throughout the occupied Palestinian territory that help people earn a livelihood and help those in Gaza to improve their access to essential services like water and electricity.\n\nAbove all, we stand up for people impacted by conflict and promote their rights and dignity. We consistently remind parties to the conflict of their obligations under IHL though bilateral and confidential dialogue.\n\nThe ICRC has offices in Tel Aviv, Gaza, and throughout the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and supports the work of the Palestine Red Crescent Society and Magen David Adom in Israel"
