The University of St. Thomas College of Business recently named former International Dairy Queen CEO Michael Sullivan Sr. as its new Opus Distinguished Chair for the Center for Family Enterprise.

The College of Business also announced a new academic Department of Decision Sciences that will be led by longtime St. Thomas faculty member Dr. Leigh Lawton, and introduced six new faculty members who are teaching undergraduate and graduate classes this semester.

Sullivan spent 14 years at International Dairy Queen as president and CEO. He also spent 25 years practicing business and franchise law with Minneapolis-based Gray Plant Mooty, including 10 years as the firm’s managing officer.

Michael drives success in all avenues of business management and leadership, said Dr. Christopher Puto, dean of the College of Business. He will be a superb ambassador for the Center for Family Enterprise and will play a substantial role in maintaining and expanding our relationships in the business community and beyond.

Department of Decision Sciences

The new Department of Decision Sciences will be staffed by a team of eight faculty members. Housed jointly on the Minneapolis and St. Paul campuses, the department will work and research in conjunction with St. Thomas' newly announced Sun Center of Excellence for Integrating Information Technology and Business. At the undergraduate level, the department will offer the operations management major.

This move completes a process that gives St. Thomas students and faculty the best technological and data comprehension and analysis tools available, Puto said. Students can now focus their course of study on management information systems and operations management, learning the increasingly important role that technology plays in effective management today.
