        "text": "Professor Michael Sullivan’s research interests focus on the ethics of immigration enforcement, care ethics, civil-military relations, and the rights and obligations of citizenship. He is also interested in the interstate coordination of responses to unauthorized migration and settlement and efforts to balance the securitization of migration with international human rights commitments. At St. Mary’s, professor Sullivan teaches courses in International Relations Theory, World Religions, Ethics and International Relations, Human Rights, Causes of War, Border Security, National Security, and Citizenship and Global Inequality. Prof. Sullivan also has training and teaching experience in public law and American politics.\n\n2018. “Keeping the Golden Door Ajar: The Business Case for Mexican Labour Migration to the United States in the 1920s,” Canadian Review of American Studies (online first): https://doi.org/10.3138/cras.2017.034\n\n2016 “Legalizing Parents and Other Caregivers: A Family Immigration Policy Guided by a Public Ethic of Care.” Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State and Society 23, no. 2: 263-283"
