        "text": "Michael Bowe is a partner and co-chair of the firm’s Litigation & Dispute Resolution Practice Group. He has almost 30 years of experience successfully litigating virtually every type of high-stakes business and personal case, on both the plaintiff and defense side, and at both the trial and appellate level. He has navigated to safety many companies and high-net-worth individuals facing serious criminal and regulatory jeopardy. He also provides crisis management advice during periods of substantial duress. He typically tries or arbitrates multiple cases each year, where he turns complex disputes into simple, compelling stories. He has employed novel solutions to problems other lawyers had advised clients could not be effectively addressed.\n\nAccording to one of the most experienced trial lawyers in America, “Michael is simply elite.” The press has described Michael as an atypical Wall Street lawyer who is “blue-collar,” “not white-shoe,” and “positively exudes an air of self-assurance.” Michael is a ferocious fighter for his clients. As one former adversary who became a client explained, “he cares as much about winning your case as you do, and sometimes it seems more.”\n\nMichael is recognized by Chambers USA in the Commercial Litigation category. In the 2023 guide, clients have made the following comments: “He has a fabulous legal mind, he is a terrific litigator on his feet and he cares deeply about the client.” “Michael is very persistent and very smart. He can take on one, two, three of the largest firms on the other side and none of that bothers him.”\n\nMichael frequently speaks on CNBC, Fox Business News, Bloomberg, and other networks, and his work has been the subject of books, magazine stories, and a Frontline documentary.\n\nAfter graduating first in his class at New York Law School, Michael clerked for the Honorable Lenore C. Nesbitt, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, and has spent the rest of his near 30 years practicing at Sullivan & Cromwell, Kasowitz Benson Torres, and Brown Rudnick.\n\nSecurities and Civil RICO\n\nMichael has been handling securities fraud and civil RICO cases for over 25 years. He has led dozens of class action, regulatory, and law enforcement defenses; securities claims against financial institutions on behalf of defrauded individuals and institutions; and unprecedented civil RICO and other actions to stop short-selling and other disinformation attacks on public companies.\n\nMichael’s groundbreaking defense of short-selling attacks has restored billions of dollars in market capitalization to his clients, frustrated class action lawsuits that accompany those attacks, and instigated the investigation, indictment, and closure of companies that engaged in such illegal conduct. His work stopping “bear raids” on insurer Fairfax Financial has been credited with saving the company from failure and restoring billions of dollars in investor value and has been covered extensively in the financial press, on cable business networks, and in business schools and books about Wall Street. He has secured similar results for other public companies subjected to disinformation attacks, including AmTrust Financial, Eros International, and Resolute Forest Products.\n\nOther companies Michael has advised in the securities and civil RICO field include MBIA, Jefferies Group, Brookfield Asset Management, Lehman Brothers, CGI Group, Banco Popular, Biovail Pharmaceuticals, Harvey Norman, Glencore, Energy Transfer Partners, and Amira Foods.\n\nMichael has also successfully represented plaintiffs in securities class action opt-outs, including in opt-out claims against Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Adeptus Health.\n\nComplex Business Disputes\n\nMichael has litigated, tried and arbitrated complex commercial matters involving billions of dollars, including disputes between members of business organizations; disputes about mergers and acquisitions; disputes about the sale of products, assets and businesses; and disputes about contract breaches and tortious and anti-competitive conduct.\n\nSelect matters include the representation of:\n\nApproximately 100 victims of child pornography, rape and trafficking in landmark lawsuits against Aylo (formerly known as MindGeek), the parent company of tubesite Pornhub, and financial services giant Visa.
