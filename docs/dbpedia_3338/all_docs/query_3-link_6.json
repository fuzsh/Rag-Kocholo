        "text": "How we know each other\n\nI haven't always liked Mike.\n\nMike \"Melon Head\" Sullivan and I met when we were 11-year-old Junior Lifeguards. He was always running his mouth and getting in trouble. Meanwhile, I was a class pet perfectionist who would stop at nothing to win at beach flags.\n\nAfter a few summers of butting heads with Melon, I didn't see him again until we were freshmen at the same high school. Little boys grow up. And Mike grew into a strapping young man, very intelligent and sweet to his mom. We became great buds by our senior year when we were both on Associated Student Body together (he, the Director of Athletics [aka the Director of Zero Period Napping], me, Student Body Treasurer [which is funny now if you look at my bank statements]); we took many of the same classes, and Mike was my biggest fan at my school sporting events. During softball season, he'd bring a lawn chair and a crew of hecklers to the left field line where they'd cheer loudly with signs and blow-horns. This was very cool because Mike & Co. were our only fans (other than devoted parents and siblings too young to avoid attending). I always played better when showing off for hecklers.\n\nMike and I decided on the same college (UC Santa Barbara - go Gauchos!), and since then have stayed in touch over the years, primarily through mutual friends and a shared love for surfing."
