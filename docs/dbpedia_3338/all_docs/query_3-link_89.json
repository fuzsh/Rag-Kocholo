        "text": "Ever ask yourself the age-old question, what's in a name? More specifically, what's in your name? For me, the answer is confusion. You see, I am the new Joe Shmoe, or Steve Smith, or maybe Bob Johnson. Go ahead, pick a common name, and that's exactly what mine has become. Let the record show that I thought about using John Doe, but things never seem to turn out well for him.\n\nSo in case you haven't noticed, there is always a Mike Sullivan in the news. In the national headlines, there's United States District Attorney for Massachusetts Mike Sullivan. Also in Massachusetts, there's Mayor Mike Sullivan of Lawrence. In sports, there's former Boston Bruins head coach Mike Sullivan, who was fired from hockey Siberia just a couple of months ago.\n\nLocally, it gets really confusing for people like me -- you know, Mike Sullivans -- because there are a ton of us. In Maine, the town of York, the parks and recreation director is a Mike Sullivan. In fact, he tells me he always has been.\n\nAnd then there's Portsmouth resident Mike Sullivan -- OK, there are probably 10 of them nestled in the Port City -- but many of you know him as the former Greenland library director, children's book author, state library teacher, college professor \"? Wow, that kind of diversity is making the rest of us Mike Sullivans look bad.\n\nThe Portsmouth area phone book features just nine Michael Sullivans, but that number is low because of cop-outs who list as \"M Sullivan\" and those with unlisted numbers (like me). The Manchester area phone book has much more, and the confusion is just as bad in The Queen City. The confusion is part of being Mike Sullivan, though.\n\nI knew at a young age that perhaps my parents could've been more creative in choosing my name. My older brother, Scott, used to play basketball for Colby College, and one weekend our family was in Waterville, Maine, for the White Mules' game against Babson. Sure enough, right there on the Babson roster, which for some bizarre reason I still have, was Mike Sullivan. That same night back at our hotel, I'm watching TV and on the credits of the show \"Growing Pains\" was executive producer Mike Sullivan. I wonder if he had anything to do with one of the show's characters being named \"Boner\"? Just asking.\n\nAt the time I saw all these Mike Sullivans, it was kind of cool because I was only about 12. Later on, it got more annoying.\n\nI rarely received my own mail in college because there were two other Mike Sullivans in school with me at that time. It probably wouldn't have been too tough to cash some of those birthday checks that weren't mine, but in the end, I always did the right thing. OK, except for the time I got another Mike Sullivan's homemade brownies -- temptation gets the best of us all sometimes. Maybe I should've written home to his home, if you know what I mean, and asked for more brownies, but truthfully, my mom's were better. And as far as I know, she only sent them to me.\n\nIf you think having two other students by the same name at your college is bad, imagine working with two by the same name, one of whom you sat next to. Yes, dear readers, it seems that Seacoast Media Group has a fetish for hiring Mike Sullivans. So if you're out there, unemployed and named Mike Sullivan, throw your hat in the ring for a job opening some time! Considering they hired me, you probably have a chance regardless of your credentials!\n\nBut I digress, mainly because I value my employment.\n\nRarely a week in my life goes by when somebody doesn't approach me and say something to the effect of, \"Hey, I met somebody who knows you.\" Yeah, probably not, but try me anyway. It usually isn't really me, but one of my compatriots in the Mike Sullivan Brigade.\n\nMike Sullivan, he of the York Rec. Department, runs into that a lot.\n\n\"I really haven't had a lot of issues, but I often hear about a lot of other Mike Sullivans. I definitely realize how common the name is now,\" he said.\n\nSince he's the town rec. boss, his is one of the names appearing in the papers a lot (for good reasons, mind you).\n\nAnd while the aforementioned Mike Sullivans are carrying the name well, there are also those in the news for, shall we say, less desirable reasons. Michael J. Sullivan, 25, of Salisbury, Mass., last month was indicted in Rockingham County Superior Court on a charge of \"certain uses of computer services prohibited.\" That's fancy terminology for an alleged Internet sex crime. Portsmouth police allege he attempted to lure someone he thought was a 14-year-old virgin over the Internet for sex.\n\nEven hearing something like this makes your stomach turn, and if he has the same name as you, you really do wonder if people think it might be you. For the record, I am 32, and the only thing I have done in Salisbury is buy lottery tickets on my way through town. Pinky swear.\n\nSometimes the name mix-ups aren't a big deal. Other times, you worry about who might think you're, well, that Mike Sullivan.\n\nMike Sullivan ran into that, recently. Oh, yeah, I mean the library guru Mike Sullivan.\n\n\"When there's (an alleged) pedophile in the news with my name, I worry because I work with kids,\" he said.\n\nThen there are the mix-ups of the more innocent variety.\n\n\"I always get asked if I'm the hockey player or the NPR reporter,\" he said. \"But once I was on a basketball team with three Mikes, a Micky and a Mikey. That was confusing.\" But, as fate would have it, he was the only Sully. (Hey, there's a rare nickname. I might use it!)\n\nYork rec's. Mike Sullivan knows of what we speak.\n\n\"Because of my job, a lot of people know me, and I bet the other Mike Sullivans in York wish they weren't named Mike Sullivan because of it,\" said Mike Sullivan with a laugh.\n\nOh, and in case you're wondering, when you call and ask for a Mike Sullivan and the person on the other end asks who is calling, there is always skepticism after you say Mike Sullivan is asking to speak with Mike Sullivan. They think you're drunk, you wish you were, and then an awkward silence ensues.\n\nCertainly understandable, and pictures are often the difference in mistaken identity instances for us Mike Sullivans. They don't always help, though.\n\nThe day after Mike Sullivan was fired as head coach of the Bruins, the Mike Sullivan writing this column happened to be down at North Station, so I stopped by the Bruins ticket office. I flashed my ID, thinking I was oh-so-clever, and asked the woman in the window if my name got me a discount on a partial season-ticket package. She smiled and said, \"not anymore.\" Poor Mike, poor me, poor us.\n\nWe feel for you, Joe Shmoe. And pretty soon, you might be changing your name. How does Mike Sullivan sound? Yeah, too common.\n\nThis Mike Sullivan is a Herald columnist. He can be reached at mikesullivan@seacoastonline.com."
