        "text": "6/10/2024 8:58:00 AM\n\nMANKATO, Minn. --- Mike Sullivan has announced his retirement after 24 seasons as the radio voice of Minnesota State men's hockey.\n\nSullivan – who has been a staple of Radio Mankato since arriving in 2000 – made the announcement on the Morning Blend, a show which he co-hosts on AM 1420 KTOE, the radio home of Maverick hockey. His last day at Radio Mankato, where he also serves as the Sports Director, will be June 30.\n\n\"Mike Sullivan's name is synonymous with Maverick hockey,\" Kevin Buisman said. \"His passion, commitment, dedication and professionalism were evident and his broadcasts became the standard others aspired to. His storytelling brought the game to life for his faithful listeners and his voice has been part of the most iconic moments in the history of Maverick men's hockey. Mike's a legend and will be missed moving forward, but we wish him and his family all the best in retirement.\"\n\nSullivan, who began calling Maverick men's hockey games during the 2000-01 season, called 914 games during the last 24 seasons, including a stretch of 504 consecutive games prior to the 2013-14 season. Along with calling Maverick men's hockey games, Sullivan also provided the play-by-play for the Minnesota State football before the men's hockey schedule began each season.\n\nDuring his time doing radio play-by-play for the Mavericks, Sullivan would see the MSU program turn into a national powerhouse as Minnesota State advanced to the NCAA Tournament nine times, including a pair of trips to the NCAA Frozen Four and one appearance in the NCAA Championship game in 2022. In total, he has called 11 NCAA Regional Tournament games and three NCAA Frozen Four games.\n\n\"Sully is a true pro in the profession,\" Minnesota State men's hockey coach Luke Strand said. \"His passion for Maverick hockey and the Mankato community is second to none. We will miss his everyday contributions.\"\n\nSullivan got a chance to call MSU's first ever Broadmoor Trophy win on March 22, 2014 in the WCHA Final Five. A year later on March 7, 2015, he would be on hand to witness the Mavericks claim their first MacNaughton Cup after a 3-0 win over Bemidji State. In all, Sullivan saw the Mavericks hoist the MacNaughton Cup eight times, the Broadmoor Trophy twice, the Jeff Sauer Trophy once and the Mason Cup twice."
