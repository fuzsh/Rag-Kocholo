        "text": "About The Mike Sullivan Scholarship FUnd.\n\nThe Mike Sullivan Scholarship was established to honor the memory of Michael Sullivan, an avid Gator fan and golf enthusiast who died March 13, 2010 at the age of 24.\n\nAlthough Michael attended and graduated from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, he was a loyal Florida Gator throughout his life.\n\nMichael was introduced to the game of golf at a very young age and enjoyed picking up his clubs and getting together with friends to play a round whenever he could squeeze it into his schedule. Michael always dreamed of playing the top ten golf courses in the world. Obviously that goal was left unmet.\n\nGiven the above, the Gator Junior Golf Association is a comfortable fit for Mike’s legacy. Those who receive a Mike Sullivan Scholarship are strongly encouraged to follow their dreams – no matter where that takes them!\n\nWho are the Mike Sullivan scholars?\n\nThe Mike Sullivan Scholarship is awarded to Gator Junior Golf Association's most committed students that require financial assistance to attend golf classes. Mike Sullivan scholars are individuals that have completed a minimum of one golf season, and they are students that display our cornerstones of Teamwork, Character Development, and Mentorship. To apply, please email us at gatorjuniorgolfassociation@gmail.com"
