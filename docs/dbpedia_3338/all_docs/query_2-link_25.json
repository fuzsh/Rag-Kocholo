        "text": "On Saturday, September 11, 2021, Michael Patrick Sullivan, 48, suddenly passed away at his home in Danby, New York from complications due to cardiovascular disease. Michael is deeply missed and forever loved. Michael was born September 21, 1972 in Ithaca, New York to Teresa and William P. Sullivan, Jr.\n\nMike attended Ithaca High School from 1986 – 1990 where he competed in both Varsity Baseball and Football for 3 years. He was key member of both teams and widely considered to be a formidable opponent and motivational leader.\n\nMike’s love for the outdoors led him to the University of Maine-Orono where he graduated in 1994 with a bachelor’s degree in Forestry. While at school, Mike was a member of the Maine Varsity Baseball team and, during his senior year, interned at Acadia National Park, Bar Harbor, Maine. As an intern, Mike volunteered as a Firefighter and was called in to help fight the Henry Peak Forest fires in Montana for 3 weeks.\n\nMike married his first wife Shannan, who he had met at college, in 1995 and had two children, Caroline Gayle and Erik Ryan. Mike began his professional career working in Kentucky before settling back in the Tompkins County area, where he worked for many years at a local automotive supply manufacturer, and most recently, as a Facilities, Engineering & Maintenance Manager for Cabinetworks Group in Sayre, PA.\n\nMike met his second wife on a blind date in 2005, which was set up by family and friends of the Morgan’s. After a whirlwind of a romance, Mike married his forever love Michelle, who he always called “Angel”, in 2008.\n\nMike’s passion for nature and home found its way into nearly every aspect of his life. Mike was a very avid deer and turkey hunter, enjoyed landscaping his massive 2-acre lawn and had an incredible love for his wife, children, grandchildren and family. Mike also enjoyed spending quality time with his pit bulls, took great pride in our country, and was a huge supporter of our military & police families, as well as, the true President of the United States, Donald Trump. Mike’s hearty laugh, witty banter and enormous smile are truly missed.\n\nMike is survived by his loving wife Michelle L. of Danby, New York, his two children, Caroline G. of Connecticut and Erik R. of Connecticut, his two stepchildren, Joshua E. Donahue of Ohio and Jasmin R. Donahue of Ithaca, New York, and his six grandchildren, Madison, Mason, Raelynn, Aiden, Malachi, and Jaxyn.\n\nHe is also survived by his father, William P. Jr., his mother, Teresa M., both of Ithaca, New York, his sister, Tracy M. (Gregory) Goodrich of Ithaca, New York, his four brothers, William P. III (Michelle), of Illinois, Johnathan P., of New York, Christopher B. (Kristina), of New York and Daniel B., of New Jersey, as well as, his twelve nieces and nephews, Shayla, Gabrielle, Brendan, Lia, Taylor, Evan, Noah, Kylie, Brady, and Sydney. He is also survived by his Aunt Mary (Bill) Ryan, his Uncle Richard (Karen) and his eight cousins, Todd, Tyrone, Will, Sean, Robert, Steven, Mica, and Michael.\n\nMike is preceded in death by his Uncle Elmer, Aunt Mariam, Uncle Parker, Aunt Eileen, Aunt Cel and both sets of grandparents.\n\nCalling and Viewing hours will be held on Sunday, September 19, 2021, 4-6 pm at Bangs Funeral Home, 209 W. Green St., Ithaca, New York. A funeral procession will be held on Monday, September 20, 2021, 10am at Immaculate Conception Church, 113 N. Geneva St. Ithaca, New York.\n\nIn consideration for Mike’s love of the outdoors, sports and hunting, the family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations in Mike’s name be directed one of the following:- Plant a tree in Mike’s memory – Mogan Landscaping (www.morganlandscaping.com)\n\n- Ithaca Babe Ruth / Cal Ripken Baseball league (www.ithacabaseball.com)\n\nTo send a flower arrangement or to plant trees in memory of Michael P.
