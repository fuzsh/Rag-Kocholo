        "text": "BOSTON - Former Boston University men's ice hockey standout and current Pittsburgh Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan is the 2024 inductee into the Beanpot Hall of Fame, as announced at Monday's Beanpot Luncheon.\n\n\"To be selected to go into the Beanpot Hall of Fame is an incredible honor, especially when you consider the caliber of players that have played in the Beanpot from all four schools,\" Sullivan said. \"I was fortunate enough to play in the finals all four years that I was there, winning it twice â€“ my freshman and senior years. The camaraderie around that tournament is forever etched in my memory. It meant a lot to my family, friends and extended family growing up in the Boston area. I remember having 30-plus people in my family going to watch the games. And then just the sheer competition and the games itself was an incredible experience. To be able to win it twice and own the bragging rights of the best college team in Boston was a ton of fun. Sharing that celebration on campus at The Dugout is something that I cherish to this very day.\"\n\nSullivan won two Beanpots during his time at BU, helping the Terriers claim the trophy in 1987 and 1990. He totaled four goals and nine assists for 13 points in eight Beanpot appearances, helping BU reach the championship game all four years of his collegiate career. In 141 games as a Terrier, Sullivan scored 61 goals and added 77 assists for 138 points. He also captained the 1989-90 Beanpot-winning squad to the Frozen Four.\n\n\"Mike is incredibly deserving of this honor,\" former Terrier head coach Jack Parker said. \"He was an important part of two Beanpot-winning teams during his time at BU, including as a senior captain. Not only was Mike a great hockey player, but he was, and still is, a tremendous person and leader. I was lucky to coach someone like him at BU and I'm really happy he's being recognized as a Beanpot Hall of Famer.\"\n\nAfter his stellar career at BU, Sullivan went on to play 709 games in the National Hockey League with four different teams, including the Boston Bruins. After his playing career ended, Sullivan became head coach of the Providence Bruins in the AHL before taking over as Boston's head coach from 2003-06. The Marshfield native was named head coach of the Penguins during the 2015-16 season and began his tenure by winning two straight Stanley Cups.\n\nSullivan is the 19th Terrier to be inducted into the Beanpot Hall of Fame and will be formally inducted during a ceremony between the consolation and championship games on Feb. 12. This is the second straight year that a former BU standout received this honor, as Matt Grzelcyk ('16) and his father John were both inducted last year."
