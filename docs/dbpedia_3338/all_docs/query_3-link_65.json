        "text": "Anthony W. Crowell is New York Law School’s 16th Dean and President. He has served in the role since May 2012 and has taught state and local government law at NYLS since 2003.\n\nAs a first-generation student and a long-time New York City public servant, Dean Crowell proudly reintroduced NYLS as New York’s law school. Dean Crowell’s management philosophy is rooted in his experience as a senior executive in New York City government for more than a decade, where he served as Counselor to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Under his leadership, NYLS issued its first comprehensive Strategic Plan, annual progress reports on that plan, and a new 2020 Strategic Plan; published an Institutional Diversity Plan; built an Office of Diversity and Inclusion; adopted a dynamic and successful new curriculum—Think BIG—and strengthened academic and bar success programs."
