        "text": "expert panel\n\nAcross industries, businesses continue to be impacted by high interest rates and inflation. These factors not only directly impact entrepreneurs by raising the cost of doing business at unpredictable rates but customers are also affected by increased costs across the board, causing them to become much more selective about where, how and when they spend their money. With customers tightening their wallets, business leaders must have plans in place to effectively navigate uncertain times and ensure business operations arenâ€™t impacted too much by financial constraints. Below, 20 Forbes Business Council members each share one thing a business can do to better manage its finances in the current economic climate.\n\nexpert panel\n\nThe best leaders understand the significance of continuous education and personal growth. They recognize that stagnation is the enemy of progress and they constantly seek opportunities to expand their knowledge and acquire new skills. Aspiring leaders, too, are encouraged to follow suit and identify areas for improvement that can enhance their work and personal lives. Below, 20 Forbes Business Council members offer insight into what new skills can facilitate personal and professional growth and why now is the best time to learn.\n\nexpert panel\n\nAs markets change, entrepreneurs may eventually find that their business is no longer resonating with its target audience like it used to. Getting back in alignment may be as simple as making a few needed changes, but it also can mean doing a full rebrand to create a brand identity that better captures who the brand is now and what the updated mission and goals are. While rebranding can be helpful for increasing brand awareness and forging better connections with the target audience, it will require considerable effort, time and money to get right. To help entrepreneurs breathe new life into their organizations, the members of Forbes Business Council share essential first steps to successfully rebranding a company."
