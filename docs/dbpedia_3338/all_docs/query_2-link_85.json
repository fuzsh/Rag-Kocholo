        "text": "Michael Stephen Sullivan died on July 14, 2022. A beloved son, brother and friend, he was 32.\n\nMike graduated from Duke University with a degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering. With great passion, he dedicated much of his career to the expansion of renewable energy sources. Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, he also spent part of his early life in New England and the last two years in Atlantic Beach, FL.\n\nMike loved art fairs, fresh oysters and good steak. He was fascinated by geopolitics. He loved sports of all kinds, both as an athlete and in the stands, and was a master at convincing orchids to rebloom. But more than anything, it was Mike’s huge heart that made him who he was. He cared deeply for his family, his friends and his dogs. He drew people to him from all walks of life, and his fun-loving nature made him the light of any party. His sentimental and generous soul shone through even in his darkest times.\n\nTowards the end of his life, Mike struggled with mental illness and addiction. He fought to recover, and for this we are proud. And as terribly as we miss him, we find solace in knowing he now is at peace.\n\nMichael was predeceased by his father Steve and his four grandparents. He leaves behind his heartbroken family: his mother Jay, sister Kathryn, brother Jack, cuñada Ani, and many uncles, aunts and cousins. His memory will be forever cherished by his many friends from each chapter of his life.\n\nWe will honor his life and death by viewing the world with spirited curiosity, hugging the people we love, and joyfully dancing the next time a good song begins to play.\n\nA sunrise celebration of Michael’s life was held on Saturday, July 23, 2022 in Atlantic Beach, FL."
