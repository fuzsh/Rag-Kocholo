        "text": "Dr. O’Sullivan arrived at Marist in 2007 to teach modern European history. His primary area of research includes the religious history of twentieth-century Germany. His first book, Disruptive Power: Catholic Miracles, Women, and Politics in Modern Germany, 1918-1965, won the Waterloo Centre for German Studies Book Prize. His latest book project is an examination of sex and gender within Germany’s influential Catholic minority from the Weimar Republic to the 1960s. The book will explore how women sought autonomy within a patriarchal church; how masculine ideals in the Catholic subculture evolved during the world wars; and how Christian political elites and congregations reacted to Vatican encyclicals about reproductive rights in 1930 and 1968. Dr. O’Sullivan teaches very broadly, including classes about the French Revolution, Russia/Eastern Europe, the Holocaust, modern Germany, and modern Europe. These classes explore political history, as well as the importance of race, class, gender, environment, and migration to the creation of contemporary Europe. He contributes to the College’s First Year Seminar Program and the Honors Program. He also has an interest in incorporating civic engagement into teaching, especially regarding migration and the sustenance of democratic cultures. He is active in the Mid-Hudson Refugee Solidarity Alliance.\n\nBook\n\nDisruptive Power: Catholic Women, Miracles, and Politics in Modern Germany, 1918-1965 (University of Toronto Press, 2018), winner of the Waterloo Centre for German Studies Book Prize.\n\nArticles and Book Chapters\n\n“Religion, Modernity, and Democracy in Central Europe: Toward a Gendered History of Twentieth-Century Catholicism,” Central European History 52:4 (December 2019): 713-730.\n\n“A ‘Shattered’ Religious Past: Rethinking the Master Narratives of Twentieth-Century German Christianity,” co-authored with Benjamin Pearson, in Modern Germany in Transatlantic Perspective, Adam Seipp and Michael Meng, Eds., (Berghahn Books, 2017), 177-199.\n\n“Disruptive Potential: Therese Neumann from Konnersreuth, National Socialism, and Democracy,” in Revisiting the Nazi Occult: Histories, Realities, Legacies, Monica Black and Eric Kurlander, Eds., (Camden House, 2015), 181-201.\n\n“Resistenz,Verweigerung und Kapitulation.
