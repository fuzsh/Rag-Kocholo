        "text": "Longtime local educator Mike “Sully” Sullivan passed away last spring at the age of 78, leaving a tremendous hole in the hearts of many students and teaching colleagues. Although he’s no longer with us, Sully will live on as a legend through the countless stories of his thoughtful and unique instruction and his fiercely loyal friendships. As a teacher of eighth grade history at both Del Mar and Shoreline Middle School, he was instrumental in fostering a sincere interest in American History in his students, no easy task. His deadpan humor, imaginative teaching methods, and knack for treating all as equals whether they were teaching colleagues or pupils, made him many a lifelong friend. He lived in San Jose, yet commuted to Santa Cruz everyday for 35 years and was never once late. A devoted 49er and Notre Dame football fan, Sully often mixed it up with his students, with whom he participated in flag football intramurals and student/teacher Friday Basketball practice after school. He also coached Powder Puff girls football as well the Junior Olympic Team, which he christened his own “Fighting Irish”. At the yearly Lip Sync events he was notorious for bringing down the house, with notable covers, including James Brown’s “I Feel Good”, Elton John’s “Crocodile Rock” and Billie Ray Cyrus’s “Achy Breaky Heart”. He had a soft spot for school janitors, always taking care of his own room cleaning, and they loved him right back. Sully famously read every 8th graders name from memory at their graduation ceremony. His after school study sessions for upcoming history tests were standing room only, with students lined up outside the door. He had a deep love for his Corgi dogs, especially Thunder. He is survived by his wife Clair, son Sean, daughter-in-law Monica and granddaughter, Aurelia “In my years teaching at three high schools and three middle schools, Mike and his program was the best I’ve ever seen. What an inspiration to education and those of us who were lucky enough to teach alongside him!”-Longtime friend and colleague, Mark Marengo."
