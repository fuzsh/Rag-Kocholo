        "text": "He works with jewels and other nonperishable objects because art that lasts is art that leaves a legacy. But the call to nature persists. “I’m aching to get back into it,” Sullivan said. “Wasp nests actually survive, and I have a huge nest right now. I’m waiting to figure out what I’ll do with it.”\n\nThe semester Sullivan spent studying at Ithaca College’s London Center infused for him an international cultural experience with fascinating course work. Its location is ideally suited to exploring London, as well as Europe. “London was amazing in so many ways. It was such a huge opportunity,” he explained. “It was incredible because the curriculum included voice lessons, stage combat, and scene study.”\n\nThen there was London’s theatre scene. They saw a lot of it and then discussed the shows the next day. The curriculum also included tours where the professor would connect various parts of London to the theatre. The history was obscure, informative, and enriching. “We turned in journals at the end of the semester, which I really enjoyed because it was a chance to get creative.”\n\nLondon is far away from Ithaca and Sullivan’s hometown of Guilford, Connecticut, in terms of distance as well as experience. This was his first time in a large city with a lively gay culture.\n\nIn the United States, these kinds of queer spaces are not open to anyone under 21 years of age. Not so in London. “This was my first time seeing queer nightlife and creative and artistic queer people.”\n\nIt was also the first time Sullivan made a mask to wear in a public space that was not for a classroom or a theatrical role. “London was amazing in so many ways. Studying abroad for anybody is incredible. Being able to see Europe is incredible. I especially enjoyed seeing and being part of nightlife for the first time.”"
