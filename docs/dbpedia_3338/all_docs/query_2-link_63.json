        "text": "Mr. Sullivan formed Michael Sullivan & Associates in 1996 as an aggressive workers’ compensation defense firm. It has grown rapidly throughout the entire state of California. Mr. Sullivan is a bar-certified Specialist in Workers’ Compensation Law.\n\nIn 2011, Mr. Sullivan, as lead author, published “Sullivan on Comp,” a 16-volume comprehensive, objective treatise on California workers’ compensation law. It is read by the legal, insurance and medical communities, as well as by employers keen to stay abreast of the law. The dynamic book series is updated monthly. Mr. Sullivan regularly conducts seminars and webinars, and co-authors white papers on significant topics in workers’ comp law. Recent publications include “An Analysis of the New Regulations Regarding Disputes Over Medical-Legal Expense and Medical Treatment,” and “Special Report: SB 863 Five Years Later.” He also speaks regularly at professional conferences including the California Coalition on Workers’ Compensation, the Association of Insurance Professionals and the Public Agency Risk Managers Association.\n\nBefore starting his own firm, Mr. Sullivan practiced workers’ compensation defense in Los Angeles, handling a full caseload of workers’ compensation litigation resulting in a 95% trial victory rate.\n\nMr. Sullivan received his Juris Doctor degree from the University of California Hastings College of the Law, where he served an externship with a federal judge, and an internship with the California Department of Industrial Relations. He received his undergraduate degree, magna cum laude, from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, where he was a member of Alpha Sigma Nu scholastic honors society."
