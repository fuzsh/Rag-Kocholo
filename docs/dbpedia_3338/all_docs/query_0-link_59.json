        "text": "Tom Jensen, Bill Davidson, and Stuart Campbell Obtained a Complete Victory from the Minnesota Court of Appeals\n\nTom Jensen, Bill Davidson, and Stuart Campbell recently obtained a complete victory from the Minnesota Court of Appeals. The appeal involved crossclaims between the defendants in a personal injury action, and addressed questions of law regarding statutory and common law indemnification when an allegedly negligent employee is protected from out-of-pocket loss by personal liability insurance.\n\nThe plaintiff alleged injuries stemming from a massage, and she named the involved massage therapist and chiropractic clinic as defendants. Lind, Jensen represented the clinic. Plaintiff’s claims were ultimately settled, and the defendants’ insurers paid their settlement sums. For her crossclaim, the therapist argued that her personal insurer must be reimbursed by the clinic for the settlement sum paid to plaintiffs because she was entitled to statutory indemnification as the clinic’s employee. The clinic argued that statutory indemnification was precluded because the therapist had been indemnified by her personal insurer, and the clinic responded with its own crossclaim for common law indemnification to be paid by the therapist’s insurer. The District Court entered summary judgment in favor of the clinic on both claims. The therapist appealed.\n\nIn a published opinion, the Minnesota Court of Appeals held that the applicable employee indemnification statute was Minn. Stat. § 302A.521, which requires an employer to provide indemnification when an employee “has not been indemnified by another organization.” The Court of Appeals affirmed and concluded that under the statute, a person who has been indemnified by personal insurance is not entitled to statutory indemnification because the insurer is “another organization.” The Court of Appeals further held that common law indemnification claims are only precluded when the requirements for statutory indemnification are met. The Court of Appeals determined that the requirements for statutory indemnification were not met because the therapist had been indemnified by her insurer. Because the therapist failed to establish a right to statutory indemnification, the Court of Appeals concluded the clinic’s crossclaim could proceed. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court.\n\nCOVID-19/CORONAVIRUS – RECENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING MANDATORY VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS FOR EMPLOYERS\n\nA great deal of uncertainty has surrounded employers’ obligations under the OSHA “vaccine or testing” regulation (the “OSHA ETS”) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) interim final rule (the “CMS IFR”) requiring certain health care providers to ensure that its employees are vaccinated for COVID-19. With two recent orders from the U.S. Supreme Court, some of that uncertainty has been removed.\n\nThe Supreme Court issued an order on January 13, 2022, staying enforcement of the OSHA ETS. This means that OSHA can no longer enforce the “vaccine or testing” regulation against employers with 100 or more employees (“Large Employers”) that was set to go into effect.\n\nThe same day the Supreme Court issued a separate order upholding the CMS IFR. This means that the much smaller subset of Medicare or Medicaid-reimbursed employers will need to take steps to ensure that their employees are vaccinated for COVID-19 in a manner consistent with those regulations.\n\nEmployers who are not required to comply with a mandatory vaccination regulation are still entitled to develop and implement mandatory vaccination policies, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nOSHA ETS REQUIREMENTS FOR EMPLOYERS WITH 100 OR MORE EMPLOYEES ARE STAYED AND LARGE EMPLOYERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MANDATE VACCINES OR REQUIRE TESTING FOR UNVACCINATED EMPLOYEES\n\nOn Thursday, January 13, 2022, the Supreme Court issued an order staying enforcement of the OSHA ETS, and sent the case back to the lower courts for further proceedings. This means, at least for the time being, that “Large Employers” who would have been subject to the OSHA ETS (employers with 100 or more employees), will not be subject to the “vaccine or test” requirements of the rule for the foreseeable future. Because the Supreme Court did not invalidate the OSHA ETS outright, it remains possible that the OSHA ETS may be upheld and enforced at some point in the future (or that other requirements will be formally adopted by the normal administrative rule-making process).\n\nMinnesota Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“MNOSHA”) recently adopted the requirements of the federal OSHA ETS in its own rulemaking issued on January 3, 2022. Given the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision, MNOSHA has suspended enforcement of its requirements pending future developments. See MNOSHA Press Release.\n\nEMPLOYERS OF MEDICAL PROVIDERS GOVERNED BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES REMAIN OBLIGATED TO MANDATE VACCINATIONS OF STAFF\n\nFor employers subject to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) Omnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination Interim Final Rule (the “CMS IFR”), the Supreme Court issued a separate order on January 13, 2022, that upheld the regulation (by reversing a stay issued by a lower court that applied in some 25 states). On its website, CMS has issued guidance to those certain Medicare or Medicaid reimbursed employers in the healthcare industry who are subject to the CMS IFR (“Healthcare Employers”).\n\n**Please note that the CMS guidance (the “Guidance”) was published on December 28, 2021, before the U.S. Supreme Court issued its order upholding the CMS IFR. The Guidance notes that certain states are not subject to the CMS IFR “at this time.” We believe CMS is now free to enforce its mandatory vaccination regulations in all states—and that this language no longer applies—given the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision upholding the CMS IFR.**\n\nTo assist Healthcare Employers in understanding the requirements of the CMS IFR, CMS published a PDF that contains general guidance to employers subject to the CMS IFR mandatory vaccination requirement. In summary, Healthcare Employers must ensure, within thirty (30) days following the date of the Guidance (i.e., January 27, 2022), that:\n\nPolicies and procedures are developed and implemented for ensuring that all facility staff, regardless of clinical responsibility or patient or resident contact are vaccinated for COVID-19; and\n\n100% of staff have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, or have a pending request for, or have been granted qualifying exemption, or identified as having a temporary delay as recommended by the CDC, the facility is compliant under the rule; or\n\nLess than 100% of all staff have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, or have a pending request for, or have been granted a qualifying exemption, or identified as having a temporary delay as recommended by the CDC, the facility is non-compliant under the rule. The facility will receive notice of their non-compliance with the 100% standard. A facility that is above 80% and has a plan to achieve a 100% staff vaccination rate within 60 days would not be subject to additional enforcement action. States should work with their CMS location for cases that exceed these thresholds, yet pose a threat to patient health and safety. Facilities that do not meet these parameters could be subject to additional enforcement actions depending on the severity of the deficiency and the type of facility (e.g., plans of correction, civil monetary penalties, denial of payment, termination, etc.).\n\nHealthcare Employers are subject to additional compliance requirements at both the sixty (60) day mark (i.e., February 26, 2022), and the ninety (90) day mark (i.e., March 28, 2022), which are detailed in the Guidance. In short, CMS has indicated that it intends to begin taking enforcement action against Healthcare Providers who are remain less than fully compliant with their employee vaccination obligations on March 28, 2022.\n\nIn addition, CMS also published PDFs that cover specific requirements for Healthcare Employers, depending on the particular CMS reimbursement program in which the employer participates, as follows:\n\nAmbulatory surgical centers (42 C.F.R. § 416.51);\n\nHospice care providers (42 C.F.R. § 418.60); C\n\nInpatient psychiatric service providers (42 C.F.R. § 441.151);\n\nPrograms of all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) (42 C.F.R. § 460.74);\n\nHospitals (acute care hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, hospital swing beds, long term care hospitals, children’s hospitals, transplant centers, cancer hospitals and rehabilitation hospitals/inpatient rehabilitation facilities) (42 C.F.R. § 482.42);\n\nLong-term care facilities (including skilled nursing facilities and nursing facilities, generally called nursing homes) (42 C.F.R. § 483.80);\n\nIntermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities (42 C.F.R. §§ 483.430; 483.460);\n\nHome health services (42 C.F.R. § 484.70);\n\nComprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities (42 C.F.R. §§ 485.58; 485.70);\n\nCritical access hospitals (42 C.F.R. § 485.640);\n\nClinics, rehabilitation agencies, and public health agencies as providers of outpatient physical therapy and speech-language pathology services (42 C.F.R. § 485.725);\n\nCommunity mental health centers (42 C.F.R. § 485.904);\n\nHome infusion therapy suppliers (42 C.F.R. § 486.525);\n\nRural health clinics/federally qualified health centers (42 C.F.R. § 491.8); and,\n\nEnd-stage renal disease facilities (42 C.F.R. § 494.30).\n\nIf your organization falls under one of these reimbursement programs, please review the CMS guidance specific to your organization for more information about your specific compliance obligations. If you have questions about your organization’s obligations arising under the CMS IFR, one of the attorneys on the employment team at Lind, Jensen, Sullivan & Peterson, P.A. would be happy to assist you.\n\nEMPLOYERS REMAIN FREE TO IMPLEMENT THEIR OWN MANDATORY VACCINATION OR TESTING POLICIES, SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE MEDICAL OR RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS\n\nAlthough Large Employers not subject to the CMS IFR will not be required by law to ensure their employees are either vaccinated or tested weekly, all employers – regardless of size – remain free to develop and implement policies requiring employees to be fully vaccinated as a condition of their employment. Such policies must contain processes for considering requests for exemptions from the mandatory vaccination requirement on the basis of the employee’s medical history, disability status, or sincerely-held religious belief.\n\nIf you have any employment or other questions regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as it relates to your employees, please do not hesitate to contact our employment team at Lind Jensen Sullivan & Peterson, P.A. by email or phone at (612) 333-3637.\n\nBill Davidson – Bill.Davidson@lindjensen.com\n\n(612) 746-0147\n\nSusan Stokes – Susan.Stokes@lindjensen.com\n\n(612) 746-0104\n\nPat Larkin – Pat.Larkin@lindjensen.com\n\n(612) 746-0154\n\nRyan Myers – Ryan.Myers@lindjensen.com\n\n(612) 746-0157\n\nMolly de la Vega – Molly.delaVega@lindjensen.com\n\n(612) 746-0174\n\nMinnesota Work Comp Presumption For COVID-19 Ended December 31, 2021\n\nThis news blast is to remind you that the presumption applicable to COVID and Minnesota workers’ compensation law ended at 11:59 PM on December 31, 2021.\n\nWe have previously issued announcements concerning the COVID presumption as contained in Minn. Stat. §176.011, Subd. 15(f). Please check our website for more information.\n\nThe presumption that took effect in April 2020, has now ended.\n\nFor injury dates from April, 2020, through the end of 2021, an employee is covered by the presumption if that employee worked in one of the listed categories of employment:\n\nPeace officer as defined by Stat. §626.64, Subd. 1;\n\nFirefighter;\n\nParamedic;\n\nNurse, health care worker, corrections officer or security counselor employed by the state or a political subdivision at a corrections, detention or secure treatment facility;\n\nEmergency medical technician;\n\nHealth care provider, nurse or assistive employee employed in a health care, home care or long-term care setting with direct COVID-19 patient care or ancillary work in COVID-19 patient unit;\n\nWorkers required to provide child care to first responders and healthcare workers under Executive Order 20–02, and Executive Order 20–19.\n\nThe employee’s COVID-19 must be confirmed by a positive laboratory test, or if a laboratory test was not available, the employee was diagnosed by a licensed physician, licensed physician assistant, or a licensed advanced practice registered nurse based on employee’s symptoms. A copy of the positive laboratory test or the written diagnosis of the clinician shall be provided to the employer or insurer.\n\nIf the statutory provision is satisfied, the employee is presumed to have a compensable occupational disease, unless the presumption is rebutted by the employer or insurer by showing the employment was not a direct cause of the disease. The burden of proof shifts to the defense.\n\nREMAINING MORE LIMITED PRESUMPTION\n\nBecause the COVID specific presumption is no longer available for dates of injury after December 31, 2021, an employee may potentially raise a presumption that remains in the statute regarding infectious and communicable disease.\n\nThe infectious disease presumption is contained in Minn. Stat. §176.011, Subd. 15 (b). This applies only to certain, listed occupations. It covers employees who contract an infectious or communicable disease in the course and scope of employment, outside of a hospital. If the provisions of this infectious or communicable disease presumption are met, then the injury is compensable unless the employer rebuts the presumption by showing substantial factors. Any substantial factors used to rebut the presumption that are known to the employer and insurer at the time of denial shall be communicated to the employee in that denial of liability.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nPlease reach out to us to discuss COVID claims – whether before or after the effective dates of the presumption. Minnesota’s occupational disease statute provides that in general, ordinary diseases of life (note that “ordinary” does not mean the disease isn’t potentially severe or dangerous), such as COVID-19 are not compensable. A disease arises out of employment only if there is a direct, causal connection between the disease and conditions of the work, and the occupational disease is a result of exposure occasioned by the employment. An employer is not liable for compensation for an occupational disease that cannot be traced to the employment as a direct and proximate cause, or for an injury that results from a hazard to which the employee would have been equally exposed outside of employment. Minn. Stat. §176.011, Subd. 15, generally.\n\nThese situations require substantial case-by-case analysis at the time compensability is determined, and we look forward to working with you and answering your questions.\n\nTimothy P.
