Sullivan Papers, 1985-1994, include speeches, daily calendars, news articles, notes, correspondence, programs, and photographs from Sullivan's eight-year term as governor of Wyoming. The collection also contains many invitations and souvenirs from Governor Sullivan's travels.\n\nThe Subject Files also include materials on the general duties of the governor of Wyoming, including Transition Papers, which provided the new governor with information on the state of affairs in Wyoming and with advice on how to organize the executive office. Budget Papers provides data on Wyoming's economic and budget situation from 1987-1990.\n\nThe photographs include many informal pictures of Sullivan at receptions, parties, campaign functions, and bill signings at his office."
