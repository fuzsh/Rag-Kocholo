        "text": "Michael Winograd is a partner in the firm's Litigation & Arbitration Practice Group. Michael has over twenty years of experience representing large corporations and financial institutions, as well as their directors and officers, in high stakes litigations. His practice includes a broad range of commercial, bankruptcy, securities, and other complex civil litigation, as well as regulatory proceedings and internal investigations.\n\nMichael has litigated in federal and state courts throughout the United States and before domestic and foreign arbitration panels and regulatory agencies. He has successfully litigated matters through judgment, negotiated settlements, and represented clients on both sides of expedited applications for emergency relief. He also routinely counsels entities and their boards on strategy and risks in connection with potential disputes and transactions.\n\nFor the majority of his first two decades of practice, Michael was a litigator at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and, before that, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. He has been an adjunct professor of law at the Fordham University School of Law since 2003, where he teaches Legal Writing and Research for LL.M.s.\n\nPrior to law school, Michael played professional soccer in Israel, coached menâ€™s soccer at the University of Richmond, and co-started up a second division professional A-League soccer franchise. In 2018, he was a second-ballot candidate for president of U.S. Soccer after a national campaign that garnered widespread praise.\n\nNotice\n\nYou understand and agree that transmitting information to Brown Rudnick by e-mail does not establish an attorney-client relationship.
