        "text": "At the regular February 12, 2024 board meeting, Lake Land College Trustee Mike Sullivan, Mattoon, announced that he is resigning from his trustee position.\n\n“I have always been a person that when I get involved in something, I give it my all. Over the last several months personal reasons have not allowed me to be as active as a trustee as I would like and that is why I am stepping down. It has been my privilege and honor to serve as a College Trustee for over 37 years, and I will deeply miss being an active Board member,” Sullivan said.\n\nBoard Chair Gary Cadwell said, “We thank Mike for his numerous years of service to the board, the staff and the generations of Lake Land College students who have benefited from his generous service and vision as a trustee.”\n\nSullivan was first elected to the Lake Land College Board of Trustees in 1987 and was reelected numerous consecutive times, serving longer than any other trustee in the college’s history. Most recently, Sullivan was re-elected to the board in April 2023 for another six-year term. In addition to his years of service as a trustee, Sullivan is a proud alumnus and advocate for community colleges throughout the state and nation.\n\nSullivan said he is proud of the opportunity to influence the lives of the many successful students who attended Lake Land College and went on to accomplish their goals.\n\n“I’m immensely proud of Lake Land College and all that we have accomplished during my tenure. I have no doubt the College will continue to flourish and provide our district residents with the highest quality education for years to come,” Sullivan said.\n\nLake Land College President Josh Bullock said, “We are extremely grateful for the many years of dedicated service Trustee Sullivan has given to Lake Land College. We thank him for his visionary leadership and guidance. His exemplary service and his passion for helping students is immeasurable. We wish him the very best as he begins this new chapter in his life.”\n\nSullivan’s service to Lake Land started when he was a student in the 1960s and continued as a trustee. During his tenure, Sullivan worked with the administration and staff to bring several projects to Lake Land including the Veterans Memorial and Flag, Alumni Park, the John Deere program, the Kluthe Center and Effingham Technology Center, and energy conservation projects. Sullivan also represented the college at the state level for many years. He chaired or served as a member of every Illinois Community College Trustees Association (ICCTA) Committee, including 25 years as a member of the ICCTA Government Relations Committee.\n\nThe Lake Land Board will honor Sullivan at the March 11 board meeting.\n\nThe college is accepting letters of interest to fill the vacancy. Those interested in filling Sullivan’s seat may submit written materials to Lake Land College Office of the President, Attn: Jean Anne Highland, Chief of Staff, 5001 Lake Land Blvd., Mattoon, IL 61938, or via email to jhighland@lakelandcollege.edu, by March 1, 2024.\n\nThe following materials should be submitted: reason for seeking the appointment, qualifications and experience in other areas which may enhance public policy or decision-making. Eligibility requirements are: U.S. citizenship, 18 years of age or older, a resident of Illinois for one year immediately preceding election, and a resident of Community College District No. 517 for one year immediately preceding the election.\n\nThe board will vote on the replacement at the March 11, 2024 regular meeting that will be held in Mattoon. The individual selected will be seated at the April 8, 2024 board meeting.\n\nThe individual selected by the board to fill the vacancy will serve until the next consolidated election in April of 2025.\n\n-30-"
