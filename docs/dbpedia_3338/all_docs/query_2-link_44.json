        "text": "Dr. Sullivan grew up in Nashville, Tennessee. He attended Vanderbilt University (or Vandy as he calls it) and received his medical degree from the University of Tennessee Center for Medical Sciences. He has been with KCH for 18 years. Dr. Sullivan went to dental school before medical school. He has three children, two of whom are physicians and one of whom is a lawyer. When he isn't in the office, you can find him on the golf course, in the gym doing CrossFit, or at church playing the piano and organ."
