His work experience encompasses a variety of personal injury practice areas, including construction site and worksite injuries, motor vehicle collisions, trucking accidents, premises liability claims, insurance coverage issues, and unsafe product litigation.\n\nHe is also particularly passionate about consumer protection cases, especially the prosecution of claims of unfair and deceptive business and insurance practices.
