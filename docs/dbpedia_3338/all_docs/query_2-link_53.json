A livestream of the Funeral Service will begin a few minutes before 10am on Saturday, June 8, 2024\n\nMichael Paul Shannon, an analytical development scientist passed away unexpectedly on Thursday May 23, 2024. He was 60 years old. Mike was born in Malden. He was one of five children born to Sheila and Andrew Shannon. Growing up and receiving his education in Burlington, Mike had an incredible mind, could retain information, and excelled in school. He was able to read at the age of 4. He was a 1982 graduate of Burlington High School. After graduating high school, Mike earned his bachelor’s degree in Biology from the University of Massachusetts Lowell. He also took classes at Northeastern University and Harvard University Extension School. He worked at a wide variety of Biotechnology firms over his career starting as a quality control analyst at Hygeia Sciences to principal Associate Development at Ironwood Pharmaceuticals. Some of the other companies he worked for include MedChem Products, Institute for Molecular Biology, Biopure Corporation, MicroChips, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Agios, and Anika.\n\nMike was an avid reader, particularly enjoying books in the field of history. He loved music and didn’t hesitate to drive to Louisiana to partake in a jazz event that interested him. Mike was someone you would want on your team for trivia. He would post on Retro Burlington Facebook page on a regular basis to preserve the memories of the community. Mike was actively involved in community theater as part of the Burlington Players and the Regal Theater. Most of his involvement was in the stage lighting and sound but surprised his family and friends by acting in shows. He served on the Board of Directors of Community Theater of Burlington for 3 years. While Mike was not much of an athlete, he was fascinated with the statistics of sports. He was a manager for his high school baseball team and would provide the coach with all the important statistics needed to make sound coaching decisions. Mike loved the outdoors and often took day trips to the White Mountains.\n\nMike had a strong Catholic faith. He and his family attended St. Malachy Church in Burlington for decades. Mike taught 7th grade religious education at St. Malachy Church. He was a Eucharistic Minister at St. Therese Church in Dracut. For more than 16 years, Mike has found his faith community at Holy Family Parish in Lowell. He was a member of the choir for 16 years, played the guitar at mass, and served as president of the Holy Name Society at the church for almost 7 years. He went on numerous religious pilgrimages to the Holy Lands to deepen his faith.\n\nMike was very dedicated to his family. He was a devoted son to Andrew and Sheila Shannon. They supported him in all his interests. His world was turned upside down when both his parents passed within 8 days of each other in 2010. Mike’s passing was almost exactly 14 years to the week of their passings. He was a loving and supportive brother to his four siblings, especially his brother, Andy. Mike was a good sport with all his nieces and nephews. He participated in their games, had silly antics that made them laugh, and gladly accepted his title of “Uncle Muck” or just “UM.” Mike’s health had declined over the past few years. He will be sadly missed, but his pain is over, and he is once again reunited with his parents in heaven.\n\nMike is survived by his siblings and their spouses; James Shannon & his wife Linda Keating of Burlington, Thomas Shannon & his wife Mary of Dracut, Kathleen Weisse & her husband Duane of Burlington, and Andrew Shannon, Jr. of Burlington.

He is survived by numerous cherished friends, especially Don and Kim D’Eon.\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at St. Malachy Church in St. Veronica Parish, www.stveronicama.org, 99 Bedford St., Burlington on Saturday, June 8 at 10 a.m. Services will conclude with an interment in Pine Haven Cemetery, Burlington.
