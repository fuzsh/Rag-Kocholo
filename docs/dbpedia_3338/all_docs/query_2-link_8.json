        "text": "Holland ~ Michael P. Sullivan, 60, was surrounded by his loving family when he died on Wednesday, November 29, 2023, after a very brave fight with cancer.\n\nHe is survived by his daughters, Jessica Sullivan and her mother, Dina Parretti; and Samantha Sullivan; his grandson, Evan Michael; his mother, Carol J. (Gulino) Sullivan; his father, Paul J. Sullivan; his 2 brothers, Craig Sullivan, and Mark Sullivan and his wife, Diana; his sister, Laurie Ward, and her husband, Paul; 3 nieces: Kylie Sullivan, and Haley and Audrey Ward; his nephew, Brendyn Sullivan; step-brothers Marty Aither and Todd Aither; step-sister Kelly Aither; 3 Godchildren, Emma Clark, Brittany Bruso, and Mark Materas; and many aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends.\n\nMike was born in Tacoma, WA on June 18, 1963. He graduated from Quabbin Regional High School with the class of 1981. He attended Quinsigamond Community College where he earned an Associates Degree in Criminal Justice. Mike began his career as a Police Officer in the town of Charlton, MA where he worked from May 2, 1988~September 10, 1990. He laterally transferred to the town of Southbridge, and on September 18, 1990 he began his 28 year career serving and protecting Southbridge. During his career in Southbridge, he was promoted to the rank of Detective in 1993, working 12 years for the Detective Division. On November 12, 2012, he was promoted the the rank of Sergeant. He retired from the Southbridge Police Department on July 5, 2018, but he continued to work (and was a friendly face while doing so) road details until very recently.\n\nMike enjoyed riding his motorcycle; he just rode his bike to and from Sturgis, South Dakota in August, a trip he had been looking forward to for a very long time. His greatest joys came from spending time with his beloved family and friends, but Evan Michael was the joy of his life. Mike also enjoyed monthly trips with his brothers to Vermont to visit with his father and friends, taking his bike to spend time with his mother, and always said \"family is all you have\". He also enjoyed football; especially trips to watch the Pittsburgh Steelers with his sister, their favorite team.\n\nCalling hours for Mike will be Friday, December 15, 2023 from 4-6 PM at Sansoucy Funeral Home, 40 Marcy Street, Southbridge, MA. All other services will be private. In lieu of flowers, Mike's family asks that you kindly consider making a memorial donation in Mike's name to the American Cancer Society, 3 Speen Street, Suite 250, Framingham, MA 01701."
