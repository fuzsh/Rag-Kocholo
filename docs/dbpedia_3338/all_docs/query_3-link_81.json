Michael has appeared before all levels of court in Ontario and regularly acts for clients in mediations and arbitrations.\n\nClients choose Michael for his strategic counsel, practical approach, and attention to detail. He acts for both public and privately-held companies, particularly in the property development and automotive sectors. With his calm demeanour, he guides clients through high-stakes and difficult situations.\n\nPrior to joining Lax O'Sullivan, Michael practiced at a leading national law firm and worked for a year in barristers' chambers in London, England as a Harold G. Fox Scholar.\n\nIn the community, Michael is the proud founder of Good Laughs, an annual stand-up comedy fundraising show where lawyers agree to perform stand-up comedy for a good cause. Since its inception, Good Laughs has fundraised tens of thousands of dollars for various local and national charities."
