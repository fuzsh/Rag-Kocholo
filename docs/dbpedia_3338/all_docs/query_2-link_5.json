        "text": "Michael Patrick Sullivan, O.S.A., was born on March 11, 1940, in New York, New York, the son of Thomas and Margaret (Connaire) Sullivan. He had one brother and one sister. He was baptized on May 31, 1940, at Saint Nicholas of Tolentine Catholic Church, Bronx, New York. He attended elementary and high school at the parish schools of Saint Nicholas of Tolentine Parish (1946-1954 and 1954-1957), and for his last year of high school he attended Augustinian Academy, Staten Island, New York, as a postulant. He was received into the Order as a novice on September 9, 1959, and after a year at Good Counsel Novitiate, New Hamburg, New York, he professed first vows on September 10, 1960. He then attended Villanova University from 1960 to 1964 and received his BA in Philosophy and English Literature. He then went to Augustinian College for his theological studies and received his MA in Theology (1964-1968). He also pursued graduate studies in English Literature at the Catholic University of America, in Washington, DC. He professed solemn vows on September 10, 1963. He was ordained to the priesthood on September 9, 1967 at the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, Washington, DC, by Bishop Edward Herman.\n\nFr. Michael’s first assignment was to Saint Nicholas of Tolentine Parish, Jamaica, New York, as associate pastor from 1968 to 1970. From 1970 to 1975, he directed the Augustinian Seminary Guild and resided at the Provincial Residence in Malvern, Pennsylvania. During this time he obtained an MA in Counseling from Saint John’s University, Queens, New York (1971). Also, during this period, he was appointed full time to the Marriage Encounter movement and established its presence in the Delaware Valley region. From 1975 to 1978, he served as the Pastor in Mechanicville, New York, where he combined the two Augustinian parishes of Saint Paul and Assumption into one parish community. From 1978 to 1980, he was pastor of Saint Nicholas of Tolentine Parish, Bronx, New York. Beginning in 1980, Fr. Michael became full-time in the Preaching Ministry of the Province. He was temporarily assigned to Mt. Augustine Retreat House, Staten Island and then to the Augustinian Community at Overbrook, Pennsylvania from 1981 to 1983, and then to Saint Thomas Monastery, Villanova, Pennsylvania from 1983 to the present. During the years he was preaching ministry, Fr. Michael spent most of his time traveling around the United States, as well as Australia and South Africa, giving retreats to parishes and to other groups. He was the author of many CDs and DVDs. In 2007 he was the recipient of the Villanova Distinguished Alumni Award. He served two terms on the National Board of Directors of the Worldwide Marriage Encounter Movement. When asked about his life in ministry, he said that he was profoundly grateful for good friends, for a wonderfully rewarding life as a preacher of the Gospel, for the opportunity to help fellow travelers along the road with Jesus, the compassionate Savior. Even in the last few years of declining health, Fr. Michael demonstrated a strength of spirit and deep love for the Augustinian community by continuing to serve in the Province Advancement Council. He passed away peacefully on August 3, 2023 at Temple Hospital."
