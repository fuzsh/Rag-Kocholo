        "text": "Charlton Heston (born October 4, 1923, Evanston, Illinois, U.S.—died April 5, 2008, Beverly Hills, California) was an American actor who was known for his chiseled features and compelling speaking voice and for his numerous roles as historical figures and famous literary characters.\n\nHeston decided to become an actor after impulsively auditioning for a high-school play. His stage experience in high school resulted in a scholarship to Northwestern University. In 1946 he moved to New York City, and he made his Broadway debut in Antony and Cleopatra (1947). Soon thereafter he landed roles in live television productions. He first appeared in a Hollywood film in a starring role in William Dieterle’s Dark City (1950). Although he was still relatively unknown, his performance impressed director Cecil B. DeMille, who cast him as the circus manager in The Greatest Show on Earth (1952). The film won the Oscar for best picture, and Heston received good notices for his performance. He later starred as U.S. Pres. Andrew Jackson in The President’s Lady (1953), the first of many historical roles he would undertake.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz\n\nIn 1956 Heston played the role for which he would remain best known, that of Moses in DeMille’s The Ten Commandments. Established as a major star, Heston worked for several other noted directors, including Orson Welles in Touch of Evil (1958) and William Wyler in Ben-Hur (1959). Ben-Hur won 11 Academy Awards, including a best actor award for Heston; the film secured his position as the premiere historical character actor in Hollywood. The movies that followed placed him in several larger-than-life roles: the eponymous Spanish warrior in El Cid (1961), Michelangelo in The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965), and John the Baptist in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965). Heston also played a U.S. military officer in 55 Days at Peking (1963), about the Boxer Rebellion.\n\nIn 1968 Heston starred in the western Will Penny, a role that he counted among his favourites, and in Planet of the Apes, the first in a short series of science-fiction films for the actor. He had a minor role in the sequel Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) and later starred in the cult favourites The Omega Man (1971) and Soylent Green (1973). Despite such excursions into eclectic fare, however, Heston continued to be known for his work in period dramas. He twice played Mark Antony, in Julius Caesar (1970) and in Antony and Cleopatra (1973), which he also directed.\n\nHeston’s other memorable roles include Jack London’s hero John Thornton in The Call of the Wild (1972) and Cardinal Richelieu in The Three Musketeers (1973) and its sequel The Four Musketeers (1974). He also starred in the disaster movies Skyjacked (1972), Airport 1975 (1974), and Earthquake (1974). In addition, he appeared in a number of television movies, notably portraying Sir Thomas More in A Man for All Seasons (1988), Long John Silver in Treasure Island (1990), Sherlock Holmes in The Crucifer of Blood (1991), and Brigham Young in The Avenging Angel (1995). His last acting role was in the film drama Genghis Kahn: The Story of a Lifetime (2010)."
