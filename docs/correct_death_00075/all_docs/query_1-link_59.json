        "text": "LOS ANGELES | Nancy Reagan was heartbroken over Charlton Heston's death. President Bush hailed him as a \"strong advocate for liberty,\" while John McCain called Heston a devotee for civil and constitutional rights.\n\nEven Michael Moore, who mocked Heston in his gun-control documentary \"Bowling for Columbine,\" posted the actor's picture on his Web site to mark his passing.\n\nHeston, who died Saturday night at 84, was a towering figure both in his politics and on screen, where his characters had the ear of God (Moses in \"The Ten Commandments\" ), survived apocalyptic plagues ( \"The Omega Man\" ) and endured one of Hollywood's most-grueling action sequences (the chariot race in \"Ben-Hur,\" which earned him the best-actor Academy Award).\n\nBetter known in recent years as a fierce gun-rights advocate who headed the National Rifle Association, Heston played legendary leaders and ordinary men hurled into heroic struggles.\n\n\"In taking on epic and commanding roles, he showed himself to be one of our nation's most gifted actors, and his legacy will forever be a part of our cinema,\" Republican presidential candidate McCain said in a statement that also noted Heston's involvement in the civil-rights movement and his stand against gun control.\n\nHeston's jutting jaw, regal bearing and booming voice served him well as Marc Antony in \"Julius Caesar\" and \"Antony and Cleopatra,\" Michelangelo in \"The Agony and the Ecstasy,\" John the Baptist in \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" and an astronaut on a topsy-turvy world where simians rule in \"Planet of the Apes.\"\n\n\"Charlton Heston was seen by the world as larger than life,\" Heston's family said in a statement.\n\n\"We knew him as an adoring husband, a kind and devoted father, and a gentle grandfather with an infectious sense of humor. He served these far greater roles with tremendous faith, courage and dignity.\"\n\nThe actor died at his home in Beverly Hills with his wife, Lydia, at his side, family spokesman Bill Powers said. He declined to comment on the cause of death or provide further details Sunday.\n\nOne of the biggest box-office draws of the 1950s, '60s and '70s, Heston's work dwindled largely to small parts and narration and other voice roles from the 1980s on, including an uncredited cameo as an ape in Tim Burton's 2001 remake of \"Planet of the Apes.\"\n\nIn 2002, near the end of his five years as president of the NRA, Heston disclosed he had symptoms consistent with Alzheimer's disease."
