        "text": "Oscar-winning actor Charlton Heston, whose illustrious silver-screen career spanned five decades, died at his California home yesterday.\n\nHeston, 84, known for his controversial politics as much as his onscreen success, passed away from unknown causes at his Beverly Hills house with his wife of 64 years, Lydia, at his side.\n\n“We knew him as an adoring husband, a kind and devoted father, and a gentle grandfather, with an infectious sense of humor. He served these far greater roles with tremendous faith, courage and dignity. He loved deeply, and he was deeply loved,” his family said in a statement last night.\n\nHe is survived by two children, Fraser Clarke Heston and Holly Heston Rochell and three grandchildren, Jack Alexander Heston, Ridley Rochell and Charlie Rochell.\n\n“Charlton Heston was seen by the world as larger than life. He was known for his chiseled jaw, broad shoulders and resonating voice, and, of course, for the roles he played,” Heston’s family said.\n\nHeston, who was treated for prostate cancer, revealed in 2002 that he had symptoms consistent with Alzheimer’s disease, saying, “I must reconcile courage and surrender in equal measure.”\n\n“No one could ask for a fuller life than his,” his family added. “In his own words, ‘I have lived such a wonderful life! I’ve lived enough for two people.’ ”\n\nHeston, who played Moses in the classic 1956 Cecil B. DeMille film, “The Ten Commandments” and has over 100 acting credits to his name, was most famous for his roles in religious-themed flicks and historical epics.\n\nIn 1960, Heston, an Illinois native who spent his early career in New York, scored the Best Actor Oscar for his performance in “Ben Hur” as a wronged Jewish prince who seeks revenge against the Romans with its famous 15 minute chariot race.\n\nHeston, who stood 6-foot-3, portrayed grand historical figures such as painter Michaelangelo, Medieval Spanish leader Rodrigo Diaz in “El Cid”, John the Baptist, and Marc Anthony in “Julius Caesar”, a role he reprised three times.\n\nIn 1952, Heston, a star of stage as well as screen, had his breakthrough performance as a circus manager in DeMille’s “The Greatest Show on Earth.”\n\nLater, he wowed audiences in the classic 1958 Orson Welles noir “A Touch of Evil.”\n\nIn the late ’60s and early ’70s, Heston shifted his focus from the past to the future, playing an astronaut in the sci-fi classic “Planet of the Apes,” and later a survivor of a massive plague in “Omega Man.”\n\nThe actor’s oversized on-screen personalities were only matched by his off-screen endeavors.\n\nHeston, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, served as president of the Screen Actors Guild and chairman of the American Film Institute and marched in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s.\n\nWith age, he grew more conservative and campaigned for conservative candidates and causes.\n\nIn June 1998, the noted gun rights advocate was elected president of the National Rifle Association.\n\nTwo years later, he famously taunted former Vice President Al Gore by hoisting a musket above his head and saying “[pry it] from my cold dead hands!”\n\nWith Post Wire Services"
