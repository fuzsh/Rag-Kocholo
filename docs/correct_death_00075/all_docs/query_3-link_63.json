        "text": "Comedian Jim Carrey’s new video disrespectfully portraying the late NRA President Charlton Heston as lead vocalist singing “Cold Dead Hand” on an Old West- style variety show didn’t win him many friends among strong Second Amendment defenders. Taking the song’s title and punch-line from Heston’s declaration that gun control advocates would have to pry his firearms “from my cold, dead hands”, the chorus sings: “The angles couldn’t take him up to heaven like he planned… because they couldn’t pry that gun from his cold dead hand.”\n\nCarrey, an ardent gun control advocate, explained that the video was “my fun little way” of expressing frustration over a recent rash of gun violence. And to be honest, while I became annoyed watching it, I suspect that Mr. Heston, who was always a much larger than life figure, might have been amused. I’ll tell you why later. But first, I would like to share my own brief encounter with him. It’s one I’ll likely never forget.\n\nCharlton Heston; The Legend:\n\nTo set the stage here, it might be appropriate to note that despite my space background, or perhaps because of it, I’m not a celebrity star-struck sort of guy. Where it comes to knowing and working with people who have earned international fame and public gratitude, I have won that lottery of fortune many times over. So it wasn’t a particularly big deal to me when I learned that movie icon Charlton Heston would be speaking at a luncheon sponsored by a Republican woman’s group about a dozen years ago and decided to attend. Although I was impressed by many of his films, the fact that he headed the NRA at that time was more important to me than his Hollywood prominence.\n\nThe well-attended event was held in a very spacious Houston hotel ballroom. Following what I recall to have been a very nice meal and a brief introduction, seemingly pretty conventional stuff, Mr. Heston walked briskly to a podium. He was in his late 70s at the time, evidencing no apparent sign of the Alzheimer’s disease which would soon torment his remaining years.\n\nIf everything seemed ordinary up to that point, those circumstances immediately took a dramatic turn when Mr. Heston’s deeply resonant voice and commanding presence filled that room. Speaking without notes, he delivered a spellbinding soliloquy in the character of Aaron, brother of Moses, prior to the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt.\n\nYes, although Heston is perhaps best known for portraying Moses in the epic “Ten Commandments” production, he chose on this occasion to express Aaron’s anguished words upon being ordered by God to cooperate with his long-absent brother in all ways possible to bring about the Exodus.\n\nAaron nearly always accompanied Moses as his highly-articulate spokesman at important events. He was with Moses when he met with the Pharaoh, stood with him on a hill overlooking the scene of battle with Amalek in Rephidam, and encamped with Moses part way up Mt. Sinai when he retrieved tablets engraved with the Ten Commandments.\n\nBut Aaron had flaws that would lead to big trouble throughout his life. While Moses remained on the mountain, Aaron went back down and hastily made a golden calf as an object of worship. He was rebuked for that, but Moses prayed and asked God not to destroy him for that sin. Having learned a lesson, Aaron later did the same for his sister Miriam, and later became a high priest.\n\nMr. Heston’s portrayal of Aaron’s distressed state regarding the great responsibility God placed upon him to help bring about the Exodus was moving…powerful…riveting. I remember sitting in a totally stunned state for some moments afterwards.\n\nAttendees were then invited to have pictures taken with Heston in exchange for NRA donations. I acted upon the opportunity, happily kicking in a few bucks to support that worthwhile purpose. Okay…I’ll also admit that a photo-op with this remarkable fellow was simply too tempting for my shameless ego to resist.\n\nIt finally became my turn in line to get my “this famous person doesn’t know me from Adam but no one will know from this picture” trophy. Then, after having our images immortalized standing side by side like lifelong friends, I was startled to hear that deep, imposing voice again, this time speaking directly to me. It (he) said “WELL DONE MY SON.”\n\nWell, of course it actually sounded much better than that. After all, I’m certainly no Charlton Heston, a fact which is also brutally apparent on the resulting photograph…he’s obviously taller. Then, after that meeting literally ended in a flash, it immediately occurred to me…Damn! If Moses had been even nearly that commanding a presence, it’s no wonder that the Red Sea divided its waters at his behest!\n\nChuck Heston; The Man:\n\nThere was a great deal more behind Charlton Heston’s charismatic persona than stagecraft. He was, most definitely, a much more thoughtful and socially-principled person than Jim Carrey’s irreverent parody portrayed. And as an occasional Saturday Night Live participant and host, he probably would have enjoyed that politically-incorrect satire, even at his own expense.\n\nCharlton Heston never lost sight of his authentic identity, once observing: “I've played three presidents, three saints and two geniuses - and that's probably enough for any man.” He was mindful of a patriotic responsibility in his profession, stating: “…more and more, we see films that diminish the American experience and example. And sometimes trash it completely.” He also recognized international influence of his film roles, saying, “To the world, you Are America.”\n\nIf you can possibly imagine it, his wife, Lydia, called him “Charlie”. Wouldn’t referring to Charlton Heston as Charlie be kind’a like referring to Moses “Big Mo”, to Ben-Hur as “Benny H”, or to El Cid (Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar) as “The Sidney”? But I digress.\n\n“Chuck” Heston, as he was known to personal friends, had enlisted to serve his country in 1944, acting as a radio operator and aerial gunner aboard a B-25 stationed with the Eleventh Air Force in the Alaskan Aleutian Islands. After the war ended, he and Lydia managed a small playhouse in Ashville, North Carolina. In 1948 he landed a supporting role in a Broadway revival of Shakespeare’s Anthony and Cleopatra, starring Katherine Cornell. Later, after the film producer of Casablanca spotted him in a 1950 television version of Wuthering Heights and offered him a contract, the young couple moved to California to check out the movie business. That turned out to be a very provident move.\n\nHeston became an outspoken civil rights proponent long before that was fashionable in Hollywood. In 1961, much to the chagrin of Allied Artists, he traveled to Oklahoma to picket a segregated theater premiering El Cid, a movie featuring him in the leading role. In 1963 he accompanied Martin Luther King, Jr., James Baldwin, Marlon Brando and Harry Belafonte at the “Civil Rights March for Jobs and Freedom” in Washington, D.C.\n\nCharlton initially supported Democrat Party candidates, but switched from Lyndon Johnson to Barry Goldwater in 1964. He also originally opposed the Vietnam War, later changing his position on that afterwards. Following the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, he joined with actors Gregory Peck, Kirk Douglas and James Stewart calling for support of President Johnson’s Gun Control Act of 1968. The Democratic Party even approached him to run for the U.S. Senate, but he declined.\n\nCharlton Heston came out fully in support of gun rights in the 1980s, and officially changed his political affiliation from Democrat to Republican. When asked why, he said, “I didn’t change. The Democratic Party changed.”\n\nHeston became a fierce critic of destructive media influence contributing to the decline of moral values. During a 1981 meeting attended by President Ronald Reagan before the Presidential Task Force on the Arts and Humanities in the White House Cabinet Room, he said: “You are the best and brightest. You, here in this fertile cradle of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the Charles River… you are the cream. But I submit that you and your counterparts across the land are the most socially-conformed and politically- silenced generation since Concord Bridge. And as long as you validate that and abide it, you are, by your grandfathers’ standards, cowards.”\n\nIn a 1997 “Fighting the Culture War in America” speech, he again deplored a culture war which he said was being conducted by a generation of media people. He also voiced that contempt at a Time Warner stockholder’s meeting, castigating the company for releasing an Ice-T album which included “Cop Killer” about killing police officers.\n\nHeston believed that “Political correctness is tyranny with manners.” In an address to Harvard Law School students entitled “Winning the Culture War”, he said: “If Americans believed in political correctness, we’d still be King George’s Boys-subject to the British Crown”\n\nCitizen Heston; The Example:\n\nMany of us have had the great fortune to experience the artistry and power of Charlton Heston, the actor. Well-known films include his Oscar-winning role in Ben-Hur, along with El Cid, The Ten Commandments, The Agony and the Ecstasy, Khartoum, The Greatest Show on Earth, and an off-the-wall classic that perhaps some of you may remember titled Soylent Green.\n\nAs Richard Corliss wrote in Time magazine: “From start to finish, Heston was a grand, ornery anachronism, the sinewy symbol of a time when Hollywood took itself seriously, when heroes came from history books, not comic books. Epics like Ben-Hur or El Cid simply couldn’t be made today, in part because popular culture has changed as much as political fashion. But mainly because there’s no one remotely like Charlton Heston to infuse the form with stature, fire and guts.”\n\nRegrettably, far fewer have been privileged to gain more than mere glimpses of Chuck Heston, the man. Yet those images bear no resemblance to the insipid caricature depicted in Jim Carrey’s video. Rather, the Chuck Heston we saw represented an America we remain proud to believe in…one that is founded upon a Constitution that recognizes that we are all, regardless of race or politics, born with inalienable rights. Included are rights to protect ourselves from those who would harm us.\n\nChuck Heston served as president and spokesman for the NRA from 1998 until 2003 when his health problems caused him to resign. He told the National Press Club in a 1997 speech: “Now, I doubt any of you would prefer a rolled up newspaper as a weapon against a dictator or a criminal intruder.”\n\nThe valued picture of the two of us on my office console serves as a reminder that lessons from Charlton Heston, the actor, and Chuck Heston, the man, have much to teach us all. He recognized that while, like Aaron, we and our country possess flaws, we are also imbued with the strength and goodness to prevail over trying challenges and daunting adversities. On stage and off, his inspiring works and solid commitments to American values represented our great country well. We have much reason to be very grateful to him."
