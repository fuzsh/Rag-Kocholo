        "text": "Charlton Heston, the Oscar-winning actor known for his larger-than-life movie roles, has died at the age of 84.\n\nIn a career spanning 60 years, Heston provided the world with a seemingly inexhaustible roster of resolute screen heroes, from Michelangelo to Moses, El Cid to Judah Ben-Hur. \"If you need a ceiling painted, a chariot race run, a city besieged, or the Red Sea parted, you think of me,\" he once explained.\n\nHeston had been in poor health for several years, having announced in 2002 that he was suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's. He died on Saturday night at his Beverly Hills home with Lydia, his wife of 64 years, reportedly at his bedside.\n\nHeston won an Oscar in 1959 for best actor for his role as a Jewish action hero in William Wyler's big-budget Roman epic, Ben Hur. One of his last public appearances was to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House in July 2003.\n\nBorn John Charles Carter in Evanston, Illinois on October 4 1923 (some sources say 1924), Heston began his acting career by working on stage and in television. His screen breakthrough came courtesy of the flamboyant director Cecil B De Mille, who cast him as the circus manager in 1952's Oscar-winning The Greatest Show on Earth. Heston went on to work with De Mille again, playing Moses in the 1956 epic The Ten Commandments. Other notable films from his career heyday include The Agony and the Ecstasy, El Cid, 55 Days at Peking and the feverish Orson Welles film noir, Touch of Evil, in which he starred as an imperilled Mexican cop.\n\nIn middle age, Heston made a lucrative move from costume epics to science-fiction blockbusters, starring in The Planet of the Apes, The Omega Man and Soylent Green. His last major hits came with the disaster movies Earthquake and Airport in the mid-1970s, although he continued to work until well into his eighth decade, cropping up in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday and the TV show Friends. One of his last appearances was an uncredited cameo in Tim Burton's 2001 remake of The Planet of the Apes.\n\nTo his detractors, Heston could be an inflexible, monolithic presence, weighed down by his own mantle of heroism and pious sense of virtue. Others took a more charitable view. Assessing the actor's cultural impact, the critic Pauline Kael hailed him as \"a god-like hero, built for strength. He is an archetype of what makes Americans win. He represents American power - and he has the profile of an eagle.\"\n\nIn later years, Heston's on-screen image increasingly played a supporting role to his off-screen politics. Having marched alongside Martin Luther King in the early 1960s, he subsequently swung to the right, endorsing the 1964 Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, railing against what he saw as political correctness and later campaigning for George W Bush. In 1998 he was elected president of the National Rifle Association - a post he held until illness prompted his retirement in 2003.\n\nThe actor claimed to see no contradiction in his early support for civil rights and his later role as cheerleader for the NRA. Both, he said, were promoting \"freedom in the truest sense\".\n\nCertainly Heston appeared to relish his appearances at NRA rallies. Brandishing a rifle on the stage, the actor would strike a pose reminiscent of the one he held while parting the Red Sea as Moses, and then challenge his critics to pry the gun \"from my cold, dead hands\". It was a role that put this square-jawed, imposing figure firmly back centre-stage, where he had always felt most comfortable. \"I have played three presidents, three saints and two geniuses,\" he once remarked. \"If that doesn't create an ego problem, nothing does.\""
