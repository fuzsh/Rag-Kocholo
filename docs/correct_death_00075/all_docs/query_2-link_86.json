        "text": "Legendary Hollywood actor Charlton Heston has died at his Beverley Hills home, aged 84.\n\nHeston's family said in a statement that the actor famed for his \"tough guy\" roles, who had been battling Alzheimer's disease in recent years, died with his wife of 64 years Lydia at his side.\n\nHeston was best-known for playing heroic and Biblical characters, particularly his Oscar-winning performance in the 1959 epic Ben Hur.\n\nIn 1950, he played Marc Antony in the film Julius Caesar and in 1956, he played Moses in the Film The Ten Commandments.\n\n\"To his loving friends, colleagues and fans, we appreciate your heartfelt prayers and support,\" the Heston family said in a statement.\n\n\"Charlton Heston was seen by the world as larger than life. He was known for his chiselled jaw, broad shoulders and resonating voice, and, of course, for the roles he played.\n\n\"Indeed, he committed himself to every role with passion, and pursued every cause with unmatched enthusiasm and integrity.\n\n\"We knew him as an adoring husband, a kind and devoted father, and a gentle grandfather, with an infectious sense of humour. He served these far greater roles with tremendous faith, courage and dignity.\n\n\"He loved deeply, and he was deeply loved.\n\n\"No one could ask for a fuller life than his. No man could have given more to his family, to his profession, and to his country. In his own words, 'I have lived such a wonderful life! I've lived enough for two people.'\"\n\nHeston was also a commanding figure as president of the influential National Rifle Association lobbying group in the US."
