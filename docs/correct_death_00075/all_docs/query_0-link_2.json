        "text": "The former Charlton Heston Estate sits gutted on a 2.9-acre promontory in Beverly Hills, looking for a buyer to jump at the rare chance to restore it to its former mid-century stature.\n\nAfter starring in the hit “Ben-Hur,” Heston hired noted modernist architect William S. Beckett to design a 5,100-square-foot residence with angular rooflines and views from almost every room.\n\nHeston lived in the home until he died in 2008. Variety writes the house had “glass-walled living and dining rooms divided by a marble bar, double-height library, and small office thrillingly cantilevered over the steep hillside during his residency. The four bedrooms in the main house include a staff suite, two guest bedrooms with attached bathrooms, and a master domain composed of private study, fireplace, dual bathrooms, and walk-in closets. The back of the main house opens to an entertainment terrace with swimming pool; a separate, elevator-equipped three-story structure that abuts the estate’s tennis court contains another guest or staff suite, screening room, and multilevel art studio with double-height ceilings.”\n\nThere are massive wrap-around viewing decks and terraces, along with private access to Franklin Canyon trails.\n\nFor the Heston family, WSJ reports, “Deciding to sell the house was ‘a difficult decision,’ said Fraser Heston, a filmmaker who as a baby played the infant Moses in The Ten Commandments.”\n\nThe property hit the market in November 2015 and was sold to Luc Besson, a prolific French film director/screenwriter, in January 2016 for $12,212,000.\n\nHe gutted the house, planning to almost triple its size, but his plan was never realized. He listed the rare multi-structured compound located at 2859 Coldwater Canyon Dr for $14,900,000 in early 2020. Following two price reductions, the asking price is now $11,700,000.\n\nListing courtesy of Brett Lawyer, Hilton Hyland"
