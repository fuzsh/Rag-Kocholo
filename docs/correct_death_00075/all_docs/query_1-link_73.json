        "text": "Details\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 14 January 2009 01:22\n\nWritten by Stanton O. Berg\n\n\"CHARLTON HESTON'S ALZHEIMER'S ANNOUNCEMENT AND GOODBYE\"\n\nAugust 2002\n\n\"My Dear Friends, Colleagues and Fans:\n\nMy physicians have recently told me I may have a neurological disorder whose symptoms are consistent with Alzheimer's disease. So...I wanted to prepare a few words for you now, because when the time comes, I may not be able to. I've lived my whole life on the stage and screen before you. I've found purpose and meaning in your response. For an actor there's no greater loss than the loss of his audience. I can part the Red Sea, but I can't part with you, which is why I won't exclude you from this stage in my life.\n\nFor now, I'm not changing anything. I'll insist on work when I can; the doctors will insist on rest when I must. If you see a little less spring in my step, if your name fails to leap to my lips, you'll know why. And if I tell you a funny story for the second time, please laugh anyway. I'm neither giving up nor giving in. I believe I'm still the fighter that Dr. King and JFK and Ronald Reagan knew, but it's a fight I must someday call a draw. I must reconcile courage and surrender in equal measure. Please feel no sympathy for me. I don't. I just may be a little less accessible to you, despite my wishes.\n\nI also want you to know that I'm grateful beyond measure. My life has been blessed with good fortune. I'm grateful that I was born in America, the cradle of freedom and opportunity, where a kid from the Michigan Northwood's can work hard and make something of his life. I'm grateful for the gift of the greatest words ever written, that let me share with you the infinite scope of the human experience. As an actor, I'm thankful that I've lived not one life but many. Above all, I'm proud of my family...my wife Lydia, the queen of my heart, my children, Fraser and Holly, and my beloved grandchildren, Jack, Ridley and Charlie. They're my biggest fans, my toughest critics and my proudest achievement. Through them, I can touch immortality.\n\nFinally, I'm confident about the future of America. I believe in you. I know that the future of our country, our culture and our children is in good hands. I know you will continue to meet adversity with strength and resilience, as our ancestors did, and come though with flying colors - the ones on Old Glory.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, at the end of his career, wrote his farewell through the words of Prospero, in \"The Tempest.\" it ends like this:\n\nBe Cheerful, sir.\n\nOur revels now are ended. These our actors,\n\nAs I foretold you, were all spirits and\n\nAre melted into air, into thin air:\n\nAnd, like the baseless fabric of this vision,\n\nThe cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,\n\nThe solemn temples, the great globe itself,\n\nYea all which it inherit, shall dissolve\n\nAnd like this insubstantial pageant faded,\n\nLeave not a rack behind. We are such stuff\n\nAs dreams are made on, and our little life\n\nIs rounded with a sleep.\n\nThank you, and God bless you, everyone.\"\n\nCharlton Heston\n\n---\n\n(President Reagan and Charlton Heston 1980's)\n\n---\n\nStan's Comments\n\nI certainly count my self as one of Charlton Heston's fans and I know that June was also.\n\nThis Oscar Award winning actor was noted for his Biblical epics. (\"The Ten Commandments\", \"Ben Hur\", \"El Cid\".)\n\nFor several years he was President of the Screen Actor's Guild.\n\nDuring World War II he served as a gunner in a B-25 with the Eleventh Air Force in the Aleutian Islands.*\n\nHe was a civil rights activist \"long before Hollywood found it fashionable.\" He participated in the 1963 Civil Rights March on Washington.\n\nOriginally he was a Democrat who later became a very staunch Republican conservative.\n\nIn later years he was the President of the National Rifle Association.\n\nHe was a close friend of another Alzheimer's victim, President Ronald Reagan.\n\nCharlton Heston's Alzheimer's disease progressed very rapidly. In 2005 family and friends were reported as shocked by the progress of his illness and that he was sometimes unable to get out of bed. In April of 2006 it was reported in the press that his Alzheimer's was at an advanced stage and family worried he would not survive the year. He passed away from complications of Alzheimer's (pneumonia) on 5 April 2008 only 5 years and 4 months after his diagnosis in early August of 2002.\n\n---\n\nThe average life expectancy is said to be 8 years from time of Alzheimer's diagnosis. It is said that one's remaining life is reduced to one half after an Alzheimer's diagnosis.\n\nJune Berg struggled with Alzheimer's disease for almost 12 exhausting years before God finally took her home on October 23rd, 2008. (June's photo is on the right.)\n\nCharlton Heston was age 84 when he died. (4 October 1923 - 5 April 2008) Using the shortened life expectancy rule, one would have expected Charlton to have lived to about 90.\n\n---\n\n* Because of the high risk factor of age, the WWII veterans are hard hit with Alzheimer's disease. Approximately 50% are victims of this terrible disease.\n\nCharlton was also a WWII Veteran as was his friend Ronald Reagan.\n\n---\n\nReader's Comments\n\nRick Hunsicker - Bethlehem, Pennsylvania - (11 February 2013): \"F\n\nRachel Evans - Douglas, Isle of Man - (11 February 2013): \"\n\n---\n\nIt was almost 11 years after June's Alzheimer's diagnosis in January of 1998, before God finally took June home.\n\nJune passed away on 23 October 2008 just a few days short of her 81st birthday.\n\nUsing the rule of shortened life expectancy, one would have expected June to live to approximately 90 plus years.\n\n---\n\nJune's Passing\n\nJune Berg's funeral announcement as published in the Minneapolis Star - Tribune in October 2008 can also be found on this website on the top blue navigation strip under the \"In Memoriam\" label and on the drop down menu or click the below link:\n\n\"June K. (Rolstad) Berg - In Memoriam\""
