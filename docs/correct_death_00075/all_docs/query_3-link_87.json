        "text": "Arriving in LA in 1940, during this first decade in Hollywood Brynner survived on bit parts and some nude modelling, while he had a long-term relationship with heartthrob actor Hurd Hatfield.\n\nHis 1951 starring role on The King and I on Broadway catapulted him to stardom and 1956's The Ten Commandments would cement his position as a major A-list film actor.\n\nAbout from his tears over Lawrence's death, tales were already spreading about Brynner's extraordinary demands. He had insisted a special lift was installed at the Broadway theatre where The King and I was playing. Not just for him, but big enough for his while limousine â€“ so he could drive in and out without being bothered by fans.\n\nSo, his pride and vanity would not permit him to be overshadowed by Heston when they were cast as Moses and his brother Ramses in the Biblical epic."
