        "text": "Charlton Heston had a thing about post-apocalyptic movies.\n\nDuring the late 60s and early 70s Charlton Heston did a string of post-apocalyptic movies. I’ve already discussed Soylent Green, now it’s on to The Omega Man. Having seen The Omega Man years ago, and I am Legend not quite as many years ago, I prefer The Omega Man.\n\nAs with Soylent Green and Planet of the Apes, there are messages in the movie. Some more obvious than others, but nonetheless, the movie generally will hold the attention of its audience. So, here are some things you didn’t know about The Omega Man.\n\n1: The film featured an interracial kiss between Charlton Heston and Rosiland Cash.\n\nIt was one of the first interracial kisses in the movies. Of course, Star Trek, the TV series, had an interracial kiss between Captain Kirk and Ohura before that. When it comes to kissing Captain Kirk really was one to boldly go where no man has gone before.\n\n2: The movie played to mixed reviews.\n\nRogert Ebert gave the movie two stars, while Gene Siskel gave it only one star. Ah, The Omega Star."
