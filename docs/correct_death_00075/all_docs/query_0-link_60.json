        "text": "Actor Charlton Heston, who won an Academy Award in 1959 for his starring role in the film epic Ben-Hur, died Saturday at the age of 84.\n\n\"We knew him as an adoring husband, a kind and devoted father, and a gentle grandfather, with an infectious sense of humour. He served these far greater roles with tremendous faith, courage and dignity. He loved deeply, and he was deeply loved,\" said a statement from his family.\n\nFormer first lady Nancy Reagan says she was \"heartbroken\" to learn of Heston's death, adding that he was also a \"hero\" for helping support her late husband Ronald Reagan, whose friendship with Heston dates back to their early days as actors.\n\n\"He served his country during World War II, marched in the civil rights movement, led a labour union, and vigorously defended Americans' Second Amendment rights,'' said U.S. President George W. Bush in a statement released on Sunday.\n\n\"He was a man of character and integrity, with a big heart.''\n\nPlayed Moses, Michelangelo\n\nWith his barrel chest and baritone voice, Heston portrayed Moses, Michelangelo, El Cid and other heroic figures in films of the 1950s and 1960s. His film credits include The Greatest Show on Earth, El Cid, The Greatest Story Ever Told, The Ten Commandments, and Planet of the Apes.\n\nBorn John Charles Carter in Evanston, Ill., on Oct. 4, 1923, Heston's early life was a tumultuous one as the family soon moved to rural Michigan, where his parents divorced. His mother remarried and the family moved again, this time to a Chicago suburb.\n\nThe strapping, tall actor would often describe himself in his youth as a nerd: \"shy, skinny, short, pimply, and ill-dressed,\" he explained in an interview. He started acting in high school plays and garnered a scholarship to Northwestern University.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Heston served in the U.S. Army Air Corps and would return from battle to marry Lydia Clarke in 1944. The couple had two children and son Fraser Clarke would play the baby Moses in The Ten Commandments.\n\nAfter doing some modelling, Heston decided to head to Hollywood.\n\nHis movie career bloomed after Cecil B. DeMille tapped him to portray the circus manager in The Greatest Show on Earth, which won the Oscar for best picture in 1952 and led Heston to the role of Moses in DeMille's The Ten Commandments, another Oscar winner.\n\nHis biggest star-making vehicle came in the form of a chariot in the 1959 epic Ben-Hur, which required the actor to learn how to drive a team of four horses for a chariot race scene. It's a role that won him a best actor Oscar.\n\nSELECTION OF HESTON FILMS The Greatest Show on Earth, 1952 The Ten Commandments, 1956 Touch of Evil, 1958 Ben-Hur, 1959 El Cid, 1961 The Greatest Story Ever Told, 1965 The Agony and the Ecstasy, 1965 Planet of the Apes, 1968 Julius Caesar, 1970 Soylent Green, 1973 Airport 1975, 1974 Gray Lady Down, 1978 Tombstone, 1993\n\n\"Charioteering is a hard-won and largely useless skill, but I can't help taking pride in it,'' Heston would write years later in his autobiography.\n\nCivil rights activist\n\nA prominent civil rights activist during the 1950s, Heston was president of the Screen Actors Guild for six terms and received the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian award.\n\nSomewhere along the way, Heston — who attended the famous 1963 march in Washington D.C. where Martin Luther King gave his \"I Have A Dream\" speech — changed stripes.\n\nIn 1964, he converted to Conservatism and began lambasting affirmative action, feminism and big government.\n\nHe was also known as an outspoken opponent of gun control in the U.S., serving as president of the National Rifle Association lobby group from 1998-2003.\n\nHeston is perhaps, also forever immortalized in the Michael Moore documentary Bowling for Columbine where the actor is filmed addressing a pro-gun convention and imploring anti-gun activists to take a gun from his \"cold, dead hands.\"\n\nIn 2002, he revealed that he had symptoms consistent with Alzheimer's disease, saying, \"I must reconcile courage and surrender in equal measure.\"\n\nA private memorial service will be held. No further details were provided.\n\nAlong with his wife, Heston is survived by two children and three grandchildren."
