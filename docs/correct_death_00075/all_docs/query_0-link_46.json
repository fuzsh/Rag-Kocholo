        "text": "Charlton Heston's autobiography, \"An Actor's Life,\" was drawn from notes he kept in the margins of his day planner. It's a fascinating read because there's so much \"small stuff\" in there, including how quietly proud he was to have become successful enough to build a house for his family. Still well worth a read. I didn't care much for Mr. Heston's take on things toward the end of his life, but in the '60s he was marching with Martin Luther King in DC, at no small risk to his career.\n\nAs a studio transportation driver, when I worked on the TV series \"The Colbys\", one of my duties was to drive Mr. Heston home at the end of shooting. His house was majestic. He was a friendly and pretty humble guy. He said, \"Here at work, I'm just Chuck'.\"\n\nThe house they are looking at the plans for is well known and has been used for multiple movies, especially in the last few years.\n\nFor example, Fatale, the 2020 Hillary Swank movie, has major significant scenes in the house (it was the \"home\" of the central character in the movie, played by Michael Ealy).\n\nCharlton Heston was so compelling as Judah Ben-Hur that, having watched the movie for the first time on VHS at my mother's house during the late '80s, once and for all I stopped getting him confused with Burt Lancaster. The instant distinguishing between the two hunky actors had proved elusive to me since childhood. Sort of like Robert DeNiro versus Al Pacino for a different generation of moviegoers."
