Was he kind of like a John Wayne, or Clint Eastwood type of character ? Heard the name many times, but never saw his films, that i can remember.

Well, enjoy the ride, RIP

Take time out and watch "Ben Hur"

The DVD will probably only be about $8 or so at Fry's

That sea battle scene with when he's a galley slave -rower and they ram that other ship is intense!

Has some religious themes, but is the quintesential Heston flix.

I GUARANTEE you will love it

i thought the chariot race was the highlight. great movie. didn't see any claims in the credits that no animals (or humans) were harmed making the movie.
