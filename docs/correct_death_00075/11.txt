Charlton Heston’s Beverly Hills home is on the market for the first time priced $12.25million.

The Oscar-winning actor lived in the hilltop estate in Los Angeles, which was built in 1959 while he was filming epic Ben-Hur, until his death in 2008 at the age of 84.

The gated three acre property, located above Coldwater Canyon, can be reached via a long private driveway with space for ten cars.

The property, which boasts mountain views from almost every room, has four bedrooms, as well as staff quarters, and six bathrooms, as well as a stunning two-story library located off the master suite.

There is also an open-plan living area, a dining area with Terrazzo floors, and a private office complete with a balcony.

A screening room and another bedroom are located in a separate building.

Outdoor features include a built-in BBQ, a swimming pool, tennis courts and a tennis pavilion with a two-story observation deck.

Heston had always proclaimed the property was ‘the house that Ben-Hur built’.

He moved into the mansion with his family after filming ended for the epic, which earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor, and it has remained largely the same since then.

Listing agent Myra Nourmand describes the sale as a ‘once in a lifetime chance to own this piece of Hollywood history.’

Memorabilia from Heston’s films remains at the house, but is not for sale. These include Star of David door knockers from Ben-Hur.

Heston’s son Fraser, 60, said the decision to put the property on the market was a ‘difficult’ one, according to the Wall Street Journal.
