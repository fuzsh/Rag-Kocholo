        "text": "The unfortunate Germans who were thrown into the mincing machine of Catalonia and, in particular, the worst-managed operations of the entire Peninsular War: the French sieges of Girona. This city became the grave of almost the entire German contingent and many others besides. Extracts from the diaries of participants in this grim fiasco give a totally chilling glimpse into the horrors of siege warfare. This is contrasted with reports of the mobile raids by Spanish regiments supported by the Royal Navy on the eastern coast of Spain. These operations into the French lines of communications helped tie down thousands of French troops, who should have been conquering the remaining free areas of southern and eastern Spain. The negative effects of Napoleon`s ill-founded operational dabbling in French military affairs in Spain from his ivory tower in Paris, hundreds of miles away from the reality on the ground is also examined. The 11 colour plates by Bob Marion are based on Ludwig Scharf’s interpretations from on the spot sketches made in Spain during the period 1808 - 1814.In addition there are over 50 B&W illustrations of uniforms, flags and details, 7 maps, 12 OOBs and 6 Tables.\n\nVolume 3: 1761-1762 – 31 colour contemporary maps and 12 orders of battle. I came across the original copy of this book by Sir Charles Hotham (published in 1764) many years ago. At that time it cost a fortune and is undoubtedly even more valuable now. My desire to purchase it was two-fold. Firstly a fascination to have a monstrously rare early account of this vital phase of the Seven Years War that included of course the great battle of Minden, and secondly, the sheer beauty of the volume with its spectacular hand-coloured maps. This was one of the most intricate reconstructions that I have had the pleasure to create. Clearly the volume demanded a large format facsimile reprint. This is not just a simple crude scan like so many such volumes these days, but one that reflects the beauty of the original volume and addresses its major problem. To the rescue, as so often happens, came my very dear friend Stephen Summerfield. I know of no other person who can feel the shape of book’s narrative and who has a genius for breaking text into understandable sections to clarify the progress of events. This is hugely important, for the original volume was one vast body of unbroken text, without even chapters, contents page or index although full of valuable information. The book now reads like the campaign diary for the Army of Frederick of Brunswick, separated into three volumes. The chapters refer to months or battles with immensely detailed dated section headings. Each volume can be referred to and read with ease. Stephen is also a rather skilful scanner, although he will tell you between gritted teeth that it took him several goes through the book to get it to the state it is in this facsimile (that also included at least one page made largely illegible by an original ink stain – I challenge you to discover which page it is!). And what we know from previous works, Stephen is a genius at maps. This superb facsimile contains 106 contemporary hand-coloured maps and 63 orders of battle to make your journey through the story easier to follow, whilst retaining the joyousness of so many delightful coloured originals from the volume. This is just the stuff we want to do with our facsimiles. The price is not cheap because we wanted to provide you with a highest quality we could, to add ever greater value to the original. Stephen, fascinated with the story of the Hessen Cassell and Hanoverian troops’ progress in England, has added even more by setting the scene of the action. We do hope you are as delighted with all of this as we are.\n\nVolume 2: 1759-1760 – 29 coloured contemporary maps and 26 orders of battle. I came across the original copy of this book by Sir Charles Hotham (published in 1764) many years ago. At that time it cost a fortune and is undoubtedly even more valuable now.
