So many thanks to each and every one of you who has accompanied and supported us along the way and will continue to do so in the future. üíõ If you want to take advantage of the last chance, you can still make your contribution via CONDA Crowdinvesting until Friday: https://lnkd.in/esxMqQJN #CrowdInvesting #Entrepreneurship #Africa #Change #RenewableEnergy #Sustainable #Impact #Empowerment #SolarEnergy #SolarRevolution #ClimateAction #SolarSolutions #Employment Note pursuant to Section 12 (2) and (3) of the German Investment Act (Verm√∂gensanlagengesetz): The acquisition of this investment involves considerable risks and may result in the complete loss of the assets invested.
