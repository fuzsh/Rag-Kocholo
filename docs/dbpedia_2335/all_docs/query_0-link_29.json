        "text": "This paper examines the linguistic and legal framework in Spain and its attempts to define nationhood and a collective identity that encompasses its three major linguistic minority groups. The four major language groups of Spain are discussed with regard to official language policy and legislation. Article 3 of the 1978 Spanish constitution was heralded as a radical new recognition of linguistic rights and cultural pluralism, so long denied by the Franco dictatorship. Yet careful analysis of this article reaffirms that the politics of language in Spain remain contentious and ambiguous; in part because of the very language of politics itself. The pull between consensus and ambiguity is examined as is how&#39;this represents tensions between the core and periphery of the Spanish state and within the European Community. It is in the three major, non-Castilian territorial identities/cultures that the greatest activity in language planning efforts is taking place. Catalonia is the most a...\n\nArticle Abstract This chapter examines how the Spanish state and two autonomous communities (the Basque Autonomous Community and Galicia) have addressed linguistic, religious, and artistic diversity. The first section provides a general overview on the constitution of autonomous communities and on immigration policies. The following subsections analyze the ways in which different sources of linguistic, religious and artistic diversity have been included in and excluded from \" normalization policies \" , i.e. policies aiming at the recognition and support of cultural diversity, at the state and regional levels. The focus of cultural policies on territorial forms of cultural diversity and on cultural difference, as well as the focus of immigration policies on the social integration of migrants, usually disregarding their cultural rights, have reified the symbolic boundaries among cultures and social groups, preventing the development of social interaction and cultural hybridization between and among different social groups.\n\nHuman rights of immigrants have not been directly related to rights recognised to members of traditional minorities in some constitutional or international frameworks. However, immigration processes entail new demands of integrating linguistic rights within the public space and institutions. The Spanish example can open new challenges to multiculturalist approaches, since it brings together traditional and new linguistic diversity in a very significant level. In particular, new challenges arise in sub-state autonomous entities, as is the case in the Basque country, where linguistic diversity has been a traditional element of the society. These new multilingual realities challenge the traditional view of diversity and foce us to rethink the substantial contents of some fundamental rights in order to accommodate democratically linguistic diversity in post-modern societies.\n\nIn Langues et nations en Europe Daniel Baggioni describes the historic process of “dallage” or “compartimentage” of Europe that ended up with “le triomphe des langues nationales et la généralisation de la formule: un État / une nation / une langue”. In this paper we would like to adhere to the thesis that this formula is no longer tenable (HELLER, 1999; COULMAS, 2005) with an innovative exercise of political fiction. If Catalonia were to become an independent state (ISC), would she adopt the formula “one state / one nation / one language”? We will sketch a number of political arguments to answer to this question in the negative. Comparative politics shows that the majority language of a state is always (one of) the official language(s) of this state and that linguistically heterogeneous polities tend to have pluralistic language regimes. Now, Spanish is the majority language in Catalonia and in any case Catalonia has the kind of linguistic heterogeneity that makes institutional multilingualism predictable. On the other hand, international / European climate on linguistic diversity also militate against the monist formula being implemented in the ISC (or in any other linguistically heterogeneous place that opts for independence) (KYMLICKA, 2007).\n\nSince its irruption in Spanish public institutions in 2018, a new right-wing political party, Vox, has challenged the electoral spectrum of other parties under a nationalist form. Th is work justifi es the classifi cation of Vox within the so-called radical right based on the components of the party's nativist and authoritarian positions. Th ese premises are deployed in discourses on the Spanish language as the only linguistic axis capable of structuring the nation. Although similar arguments can be found in other right-wing, center-right, or center-left political parties in Spain, Vox explicitly shows its placement. Language policy in Spain fl uctuates around two positions related to the legal nature of the offi cial languages. On the one hand, Spanish is the offi cial language of the State and is widely known by the population; on the other hand, linguistic offi ciality is shared with other languages in several regions. Th is legal and social situation implies that measures for the protection and promotion of regional languages are perceived as an attack on the vitality of Spanish. We propose an analysis of Vox's discourse through three channels: fi rst, the organic party documents, as the statutes or the electoral program; second, institutional and journalistic interventions of members with social signifi cance; and third, the publications on Twitter of six relevant components of the party. Th is material reveals an attack on the linguistic policies of bilingual territories under the premise of Spanish as the common language that balances all citizens. Far from assuming a mere conjunction of particular political phenomena, Vox's discourse articulates social loyalties, with a direct impact on the coexistence of people from diff erent territories and speakers of diff erent languages. Our purpose is, therefore, to unravel the ideological orientation and tone with which Vox transmits its discourse regarding the social relationship of minoritized languages in Spain with the most widespread language, Spanish.\n\nSpain according to the Constitution of 1978 is a unitary state, but its whole territory is divided into autonomous communities that have the widest rights from equivalent territorial units in other European countries. The Constitution restored the possibility of creating regional autonomies, which were abolished earlier during the Franco dictatorship. However, the basic law was adopted before the foundations of regional structures were fully developed, so norms concerning the issues of autonomy were dictated in a general way. Only later legal acts regulated the situation in detail, but often their content depended on the political situation and was not always homogeneous. The creators of the Constitution did not foresee the subsequent forming of autonomous communities in the entire state territory. For over four decades of validity of the Spanish constitution, differences in the way the individual autonomous communities were established and differences in the competences of differen..."
