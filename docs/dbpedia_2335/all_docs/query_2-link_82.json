        "text": "This article identifies a set of plays written in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by 'new Jews' in the Western Sephardi Diaspora, as autos sacramentales. It discusses essential characteristics of this genre, such as the dual-theomachic and psychomachic-level, the triangle constellation of allegorical characters with human nature in its center and the representatives of good and evil on both sides, and the parallelism created in the play between the cosmic story, the story of humanity, and the story of the individual human soul. It is argued that these characteristics are to be found in plays written by Jews in the Early Modern Era. The appearance of this corpus of plays in the history of Jewish writing is argued to indicate that an underlying structure of the psychic and historical consciousness of Western culture had not skipped the Jewish cultural world.\n\nThis paper addresses Geltungsjuden – children of a non-Jewish parent considered to be part of the Jewish community. Besides intermarried Jews, they were the second major group remaining “legally” in Germany even after June 1943, when Goebbels had declared Berlin “free of Jews.” Focusing on Berlin’s Jewish community as still the largest in Germany, I will follow those less than a thousand “last Jewish youngsters”, who – under the persisting threat of deportation – struggled for physical and spiritual survival. New research on German late-war Jewish communities generally focuses on the experience of Jews in hiding or mixed marriage families such as Beate Meyer’s magisterial work on Mischlinge as well as Susanna Schrafstetter’s and Max Strnad’s work on Munich. This paper examines the connections between ongoing deportations, a fluid Jewish identity and the coexistence of their in- and exclusion within the remaining Jewish community. At the same time, Geltungsjuden experienced everyday persecution, denunciations as well as occasional solidarity and help by Berlin’s non-Jewish population. There is a narrative in many testimonies of survivors who were deported in the years up to 1943, that Jewish life in Berlin ended with the dissolution of the Reichsvereinigung der Juden on June 10th, 1943. But actually, the Reichsvereinigung was never formally dissolved, as the Reichssicherheitshauptamt was interested in keeping the remainder of Jewish assets under their control, instead of handing everything over to the Oberfinanzpräsident - and thus, a letter dated August 1943 states, that the Reichsvereinigung in fact continued to exist beyond the deportation of its full-jewish members in early summer 1943. Parallel to that and equally lesser-known, the Jewish community of Berlin did not „collapse“ (as a Berlin survivor then in Theresienstadt expressed it) but continued to exist - a pale, absurd, yet quite real existence. When in May 1945 Geltungsjuden became the “first Jewish youth” of the post-war community, most of them had survived by Jewish as well as non-Jewish assistance. Thus, Geltungsjuden invite us to re-examine the complexity of Jewish and non-Jewish relations. This will contribute to our understanding of the last stage of the Holocaust, but will also help us understand how after the war, some of these survivors could call Berlin, of all places, their home.\n\nJewish Community of Zagreb, 1943-1945, Naida-Michal Brandl The Independent State of Croatia (NDH) was proclaimed on April 10, 1941. The anti-Jewish measures were implemented swiftly and on April 30, the Racial laws were proclaimed (of 35,000 Jews in the NDH, around 12,000 were in Zagreb). Deportations to Croatian camps started in May 1941. Until the beginning of 1942 around half of the remaining Jews in Zagreb were deported. From August 1942 the Germans were included in the deportation process, and in the next and last mass deportation in May 1943, Jews were deported mainly to Auschwitz. The Jewish Community in Zagreb was closed in April and reopened in May 1941, now in charge of all racially defined Jews. It was under direct control of pro-Nazi regime, and responsible for Jews imprisoned in concentration camps in the NDH, remaining Jews in Zagreb, the old people’s home(s), school, and registrar books. There was an acting synagogue as well. The community was financed by member fees and international Jewish organizations. After the last big German-Croatian deportations of May 1943, only Jews in mixed marriages or honorary Aryans remained. They took over the leadership of the community, which continued to care about Jews in camps as well as the old people’s home. After liberation, they were still community leaders and took over new tasks following the same logic of the war-time period. The school as well as synagogue ceased to exist after May of 1943. There were still funerals in the Jewish section of the public cemetery, which survived the War intact."
