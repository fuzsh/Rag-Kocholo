        "meta_description": "\"The Price of Victory\". Battle of Pancorbo (1808). Lefebvre lost 200 casualties and Blake 600. Although the French had managed something of a tactical victory, the battle was a definite strategic blunder: Blake escaped the French trap and conducted a crafty withdrawal, checked his pursuers at Valmaseda, and was not caught until November 10. The overwhelming strength of Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e allowed the French to sweep past the tottering Spanish defenses and capture Madrid by year's end.",
