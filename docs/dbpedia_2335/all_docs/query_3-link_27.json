        "text": "Already long convinced of the primacy of education in order to pacify the world, many pedagogues and intellectuals were astonished and even mutinous in the aftermath of the First World War: why did children not benefit, like workers with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), from an international body concerned with their fate, when it was generally agreed that the future of mankind depended on the education of new generations? The school was also in the dock during the Great War: steeped in nationalism and devoted to obedience, it was said to have trained pupils to become brave soldiers, meekly going off to the battlefields to die as patriots. For the pacifist and feminist educators and intellectuals who pronounced this verdict, only a profound educational reform would preserve peace: the school’s mission must be to forge responsible, free and autonomous citizens, committed to the values of solidarity and international understanding. Calls for a permanent International Bureau of Education were included in the Memorandum that the International Council of Women (ICW), the Allied Women’s Suffragists’ Conference of the allied countries and of United States of America presented to the highest officials of the League of Nations Commission in April 1919. In vain. Convinced that peace on earth could not be built solely through diplomacy but should also include the whole of civil society, requiring a transformation of mentalities, many associations and leagues mobilised to make up for the “inadequacies” of the Treaty of Versailles: they tried to bestow a mission of intellectual and educational cooperation on the so-called technical agencies of the LoN. The representatives of the Institut Rousseau/École des sciences de l’éducation [School of sciences of education] had their sights set on these movements and joined several of them, in order to have their voice and their work recognised. They now seemed convinced that they could link the destinies of their small institution with those of the world. Three of them in particular, established in Geneva while benefiting from a vast circle of intellectual solidarity, became the zealous promoters of an office aiming to preserve peace on earth through science and education. 429p 2024 Springer https://lnkd.in/gpZRuA32\n\nPleased to share my latest publication co-authored with Dr Rhonda Povey, Prof Susan Page & Dr Stacey Kim Coates. Thanks to the International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education for publishing this article. \"Let us be clear: it is not beyond the remit of higher education to institute equity-based reform. Findings from the Walan Mayini project show Indigenous leaders are unequivocal that they are shouldering the responsibility and doing the hard work with a modicum of ambiguous support from the sector. It is incumbent on higher education to cease shadowing behind the convenience of interest convergences and the default position of divergence, and instead take advantage of competing logics to advance parity in Indigenous educational leadership by taking advice from current research into leadership, for example as outlined in the Walan Mayini project, attending to the remonstrations within their sector, and moving over to make space at the table for Indigenous leaders. This is a call to action for changes in policy and praxis across the sector. No doubt, it is a long and chicane-laden road, nevertheless, participants and literature corroborate that institutional reform led by Indigenous leaders who are working with a shared purpose of combating racism in higher education bodes well for improved equitable outcomes in Indigenous education (pg 12).\""
