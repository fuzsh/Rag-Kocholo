        "text": "Emeterio Valiente for the IAAF\n\n21 June 2002 - In the last decade, Spain has shown amazing strength over the 1500m event, winning not less than ten medals at major championships during the period 1992-2001. This year without an Olympics nor Worlds at stake, the big challenge will be the European Championships to be held in Munich in August. The last two editions witnessed four podium spots for the Spanish squad, gold and silver at Helsinki 94, and a gold and bronze four years ago in Budapest.\n\nTaking a closer look at the all-time European ranking, we can see seven Spaniards in the first twelve! This achievement is only matched in the track events by Great Britain in the men’s 400m. Only three European men have ever run under the 3:30 barrier, Spain's Fermín Cacho and two British legends Sebastian Coe and Steve Cram, both former world record holders.\n\nIn recent years there has been some controversy regarding the Spanish selection procedure for the major events. It is well known that there are only three places available per country, so every season since 1998 thrilling battles have taken place. For instance, in that year, Isaac Viciosa, runner up in Helsinki 94 to Cacho, ran 3:30.94 but after Reyes Estévez’s overwhelming supremacy at the Nationals, he decided to move up to the 5000m in Budapest. It paid off, he won gold from fellow countryman Manuel Pancorbo - already 'retired' - another 1500 specialist ‘sent away’ from the event by Cacho’s and Estévez’s unstoppable streak of successes.\n\nSuch is the rivalry among the best Spaniards that the National Champion and the best Spanish placer at each year’s major championships event (always held only three weeks after the National event) has been a different athlete in the last five years, apart from 1998 when reigning European champion Reyes Estévez accomplished both awards.\n\nIn 2002, the exciting moment will come on July 21 during the Nationals, when at least five athletes will be fighting it out for the three coveted team places. Some of them have even confessed that what they fear most is the domestic rivalry, so there will be no room for mistakes. Once qualified for Munich everything will be much easier, they say!\n\nUnfortunately, Fermin Cacho has sadly been in hospital since last Monday suffering from the brain disease encephalitis and thus for this year at least the 1992 Olympic Champion will be missing from the annual national selection battle.\n\nReyes Estévez (02/08/76, PB:3:30.57) is arguably one of the most talented middle distance runners in the world. He became the youngest ever 1500m European Junior champion back in 1993...aged 16! (the day before his 17th birthday). Two years later he struck gold again in the same event ahead of Spain’s José Antonio Redolat and Netherlands Gert Jan Liefers, who on paper should also be two of his fiercest rivals in Munich. During that 1995 season he set the current Under 20 European record clocking 3:35.51 in Zurich. Estévez is a gifted prodigy and remains undefeated at European championship level, having also won the 1997 Under 23 title and senior gold in Budapest the following summer.\n\n“I feel ready to successfully defend my crown” confirmed Estévez. “ I am not saying I am the favourite, but I already know how to win. All the talk is about Portugal’s Rui Silva but he has never beaten me at a major event outdoors”.\n\nAfter his 5th place in Edmonton (he had taken bronze at both the previous IAAF World Championships in Athens 97 and Seville 99 ), Estévez moved to Soria to join Cacho’s training group as his coach in Barcelona had decided to retire. There he is renting Cacho’s old flat and last winter Estévez ran an average mileage of 100 per week.\n\n\"Hopefully it will pay off this summer”.\n\nJuan Carlos Higuero (03/08/78, PB: 3:32.30) seemed destined to be a long distance runner as he won the bronze medal at the European Junior Champs in Ljubljana 97 in the 5.000m. But when he moved to Madrid for the 97-98 season, he realized he had ability for the middle distances events.\n\n“I remember it was during a 100m reps session that I unexpectedly clocked an average of 11.5, so my coach (Antonio Serrano, 94’ Berlin Marathon winner, 2h09.13 on his debut) and I decided to challenge for the 1500m,\" confirmed Higuero.\n\nSince then Higuero has successively cut his PB from 3.41.24 in 1998 to 3:39.57 (99), 3:36.65 (00) and 3:32.30 (01). He was 8th at the Sydney Olympics but failed to make the Spanish team in Edmonton. His revenge came in Vienna at the European Indoor Championships last March when he was runner up to Rui Silva, in what was a real cliff-hanger of a final, with Silva beating Higuero by just 0.15. secs. Higuero quickly realized his new found celebrity status after that silver medal, when a policeman stopped him on the motorway and let him off a driving fine.\n\nHiguero, who will be 24 in August says: “It is not easy to know what the Spanish trio for Munich will be” but he firmly believes that “two Spaniards will take medals along with Silva and the winning time will be around 3:37”.\n\nJosé Antonio Redolat is the same age as Estévez (17/02/76 PB: 3:31.21), but has been overshadowed by him for many years. That was until 2001, when the 2000 European Indoor champion made a huge breakthrough by winning at the Stockholm IAAF Grand Prix meet holding off Bernard Lagat with a lifetime best of 3:31.21, which claimed 8th spot on the European all time list.\n\nRedolat suffered medical problems for a long time due to his lack of red corpuscles in his blood system, as he had less than 4 million. After his stunning win at the 2001 National championships (defeating Díaz and Estévez) everyone expected more than the 6th place he achieved at the Worlds in Edmonton. But he is patient.\n\n“Each year I feel more confident and grow as an athlete” and adds, “I feel capable of beating anyone in Europe as I have a strong kick,\" confirmed Redolat. \"My main target is Munich but I would like to take advantage of my build up to run under 3:30 this summer. If you race fast prior to Munich you put pressure on your rivals”. Anyway, Redolat has an undoubted advantage: his childhood idol was somebody called...Sebastian Coe.\n\n33 year old Andrés Díaz (PB 3:31.48) believes he will be among the three Spanish Munich representatives but resents the media attention lavished on Estévez, Cacho and the rest.\n\n“Since 1998 I have been the only man to qualify for every major championship and this will be the same this year without exception”.\n\nAfter not finishing in his heat at the Edmonton Worlds, he thought of giving up athletics but finally changed his mind. He was injured for two months earlier in the year and to make up for it he has been training three times a day!\n\n“At eight in the morning it’s a 10km easy run. At eleven the quality work and around 18hrs a brisk run.... If Munich becomes a tactical matter Silva would be the man to beat, but neither France’s Maazouzi nor me are going to allow a pedestrian pace. I would like to reach 1000m in 2:27 and then step up the pace. This way the fastest men’s chances decrease,” he confirmed confidently.\n\nDíaz, the European Indoor record holder (3:33.32 Athens, February 24, 1999) foresees a final no faster than 3:35 and announces that he will shortly tackle the 5000m with the 2004 Olympics in Athens in mind. “For sure, I will run that distance there”.\n\nBut also let us not forget two other Spanish milers! In the Seville Grand Prix meeting held on 8 June 2001, World University Games gold medallist Pedro Esteso beat Higuero and Redolat, as Díaz dropped out and Cacho tackled the 5000m (13:46.55). While this year the fastest athlete is Jesús España (2002 European Indoor bronze medallist in the 3000m), who clocked 3:36.53 for a PB last May 15 in Doha, but he has decided to target a 5000m spot for Munich, having already achieved the qualifying time with a 13:22.66 clocking in Seville."
