According to Llorente , the first señores de Vizcaya were (in order): Lope Zuria [=el Blanco] (end-9th century), his son Munio López (also called Manso, early 10th century), his son Lope Muñoz (named in 939, and present with Fernando González Conde de Castilla at the battle of Hacinas), his son Munio López (whom he identifies as the husband of Velasquita de Navarra, end 10th century), his son Lope Muñoz (no references, his name reconstituted from patronymics), and the latter´s son Íñigo López Ezquerra (whom he identifies as Íñigo López who died in [1077], see below). Llorente does not cite the primary sources which confirm the existence of these individuals and the relationships between them which he proposes. His hypothesis appears based on the assumption that the señorío de Vizcaya was hereditary within the same family during the 9th to 11th centuries, but this seems far from certain if it can be compared with the other señoríos in the kingdom of Navarre during the same period. In any case, it seems unlikely that the same family would have held power in Vizcaya throughout this period given the changes in suzerainty which the territory experienced, as discussed further below. Llorente also catalogues various later works which trace the supposed origin of Lope Zuria . Amongst these, the mid-14th century Nobiliario of Pedro Conde de Barcelos states that \"un hermano del Rey de Inglaterra, expulso de allá From\" arrived in Vizcaya with \"Fortun Froes su hijo\" who was installed as señor by \"en Asturias el Conde D. Moniño\", to whom tribute of \"una vaca, un buey i un cavallo blancos\" had been paid by Vizcaya annually, payment of which was henceforth refused by \"From\" . Lope García de Salazar, writing his Crónica de Vizcaya in 1454, recorded that Jaun Zuria (=el señor blanco) was the first señor de Vizcaya and that he was conceived in Scotland by the king´s daughter who had been exiled there by her father and born in Mundaca or, alternatively, that his mother was the sister of the Scottish king who settled in Mundaca, his father being named Munio . It is assumed that all these individuals, cited only in these later sources, were fictitious.\n\nLlorente states that the first of his named rulers in Vizcaya, Lope Zuria, was the vassal of Alfonso III King of León and that the suzerain of his supposed son and successor Munio López was Fernando González Conde de Castilla . Vizcaya was eventually consolidated with the kingdom of Navarre in the 1030s after Sancho III King of Navarre assumed control over Castile and large parts of León.\n\nOnly two references have so far been identified, in the primary sources which have been consulted, which link named individuals to Vizcaya during the 9th to early 11th centuries. The first is the Codex de Roda which names \"domni Momi comitis Bizcahiensis\" when recording his marriage to Velasquita, daughter of Sancho I García King of Navarre . This does not specify Munio´s patronymic, and other sources appear to indicate that it may have been Velaz not López as stated by Llorente. In addition, Munio Velaz is recorded in the cartulario of Valpuesta as Conde de Álava not Vizcaya . The second reference is the charter of Leire monastery dated 13 Aug 1043 which is subscribed by  Senior Eneco Lopiz de Bizcaia  . He is also named later in the cartularies of Leire and Santa María la Real de Nájera (see below). The dating of these first two references show that it is improbable, as suggested by Llorente, that Conde Munio who is named in the first entry was the grandfather of Íñigo who is named in the second. In addition, a charter of Leire monastery dated 1042 is subscribed by  Senior Lope Bellakiz et senior Galindo Bellakiz et senior Enneco Lopiz, confirmans  , the linking of the three names within the same phrase suggesting a family relationship between them. The suggestion is that Íñigo López was the son of Lope Velásquez, named in this charter, and not the son of a hypothetical Lope Munioz.\n\nBy the last quarter of the 11th century, Vizcaya was once again under the control of Castile, as shown by the dating clause of the 1076 charter of Íñigo López which names \"regnante rege Adefonso in omni Yspania\", referring to Alfonso VI King of Castile. It should, however, be recalled that this year marked the beginning of the eclipse of the kingdom of Navarre, after King Sancho V was murdered and replaced by the king of Aragon on the Navarrese throne. It is possible therefore that the king of Castile stepped in to claim jurisdiction over Vizcaya, as the primary source documentation shows was the case with the previously Navarrese señorío of Nájera. A charter dated 1091 confirms that Alfonso VI King of Castile was suzerain of Conde Lope Iñíguez, son of Conde Íñigo López, and accords him the title \"Aldefonsus imperator tocius Castelle et Toleto necnon et Nazare seu Alave\" .\n\nAnother question relates to the extent of the autonomy, and possible sovereign status, enjoyed by the señores de Vizcaya. Íñigo López (who died in [1077]) is named \"senior de Bizcaya\" in sources dated between 1043 and 1047. Charters dated between 1064 and 1074 name him as señor de Nájera. In 1076, he was named \"Sennor Enneco Lopez tocius Vizcahie comes\". His son Lope Iñíguez is named \"dominante Bizcahia et Ipuzcoa et Alava\" in 1082 and \"domno in Alava in Bizcahia\" in 1088. Diego Iñíguez, son of Íñigo López, is named \"dominante in Nagera et in Grannone\" in 1110, and Diego´s son Lope Díaz (who died in 1170) is named \"dominante Naieram\" in a document dated 1162, but none of the documents so far found name either Diego or Lope in relation to Vizcaya. No further references to \"dominante\" have been found applied to their descendants. In the mid-13th century, use of the term \"señor de Vizcaya\" is found more frequently in primary sources, although after that time the family is normally referred to in relation to the señorío de Haro, which must have been considered more important by contemporaries. Throughout this time-frame, no reference has been found in any contemporary documentation to indicate that the señores de Vizcaya called themselves \"señor soberano de Vizcaya\", which is the term frequently found in modern works dealing with the family and which implies more independence of action than is reflected in the primary sources. In fact, the titles attributed to the family are no different from those used by other powerful noble families in the kingdom of Castile and León, as can be seen in the document CASTILE & LEON NOBILITY (1). The señorío of Vizcaya passed by marriage to the descendants of a younger son of Alfonso X King of Castile in [1290].\n\nThe family of the señores de Vizcaya is treated in detail by Pedro de Portugal Conde de Barcelós, illegitimate son of Diniz King of Portugal, in his Nobiliario, written in the mid-14th century, although the details of the early generations are suspect .\n\nChapter 1. CONDES en ÁLAVA\n\nThe county of Álava was located west of the kingdom of Pamplona/Navarre and east of the county of Castile, stretching from the northern Spanish coast southwards inland to north of Logroño. In the 9th/10th centuries, the county appears to have covered all the territory which today includes the provinces of Vizcaya and Álava in the Basque autonomous region of Spain, north of the area then controlled by the Banu Qasi (see the document MOORISH SPAIN).\n\nThe area is referred to during Visigothic rule in the Iberian peninsular: the Iohannis Abbatis Biclarensis Chronica records that \"Leovigildus rex\" occupied \"partem Vasconiæ\" and founded civitatem...Victoriacum [Victoriaco], dated to [581] . Following the Muslim invasion of 711/12, the anonymous Akhbar al-Majmua (Collection of Anecdotes, translated into Spanish in the mid-19th century by Lafuente as \"Ajbar Machmua\" and dated by him to the 11th century, although dated to [940] by Chalmeta ) records that the invaders, led by \"Okba ben Al-Hachaeh\" [Uqba bin al-Hajaj al-Saluli, governor of Muslim Spain from [728]], conquered Galicia, Álava y Pamplona with the exception of la sierra en la cual había refugiado con 300 hombres un rey llamado Belay [Pelayo] . Muslim domination appears to have been short-lived, as the Chronicle of Alfonso III records Álava among the territories settled (by the Asturians) during the reign of Alfonso I King of Asturias (739-[757]) . Relations between the kingdom of Asturias and the Basques to the east of Asturian territory remained tense, as the same source states that King Fruela I (son of Alfonso I) \"overcame the rebellious Basques and took for himself a wife from their territory named Munia\" (see below), presumably dated to the early 760s . It is unclear whether the territory of the...Basques at that time included Álava. The domination of Álava by the kingdom of Asturias ended some time in the first half of the 9th century, as the Chronicon de Sampiro records a count in Álava named Eilo, although only in the context of his capture by Alfonso III King of Asturias and transportation back to Oviedo in chains, dated to [866] . During the succeeding decades, Vela Jiménez is recorded as count in Álava in the Chronicon Albeldense, appointed by King Alfonso III and attacking the county of Castile on behalf of the Asturian king . Munio Velaz Conde en Álava, presumed son of Vela Jiménez, is probably identifiable with Munio Conde en Vizcaya who married the daughter of Sancho I King of Navarre in 923, which (if this co-identity is correct) indicates that the county of Álava had by that time fallen under the jurisdiction of the Navarrese kingdom. Munio died soon afterwards, and Álava is then recorded under Álvaro Herraméliz, who was also presumably appointed by the king of Navarre as he is recorded as marrying another daughter of King Sancho I. Álvaro appears to have been unrelated to Vela Jiménez. His descendants are later recorded in Galicia, which suggests that they were expelled from the kingdom of Navarre after their father died (probably in [931]) because of some unrecorded family transgression. Álvaro´s widow married, as her third husband, Fernando González Conde de Castilla, who is recorded in mid-10th century charters as conde en Álava. Lucas de Tuy (dated to [1236]) records that \"in Castella et in Alaua adolescens...comes generosus...Vela\" rebelled against Fernando González (so dated to some time in the mid-10th century) and sought refuge \"ad Sarracenos\" after he was expelled from the county . This comes...Vela has not been identified in earlier primary sources, but his name suggests a family connection with Vela Jiménez. After the late 10th century, the sources are insufficiently detailed to trace an unbroken succession of rulers in Álava, although several different families are recorded as holding señoríos over all or part of the territory, as shown below. From the later 10th/11th centuries, jurisdiction over Álava appears to have fluctuated between the Navarrese kingdom and the county of Castile. After the assassination of Sancho IV King of Navarre in 1076, Alfonso VI King of Castile & León invaded Navarre and annexed Álava, among other territories, to Castile.\n\n1.OVECO --- ([715/25]-) . No record has been found which refers to Oveco in his personal capacity, except by way of the patronymic of his daughter. His Basque origin is confirmed by the Chronicle of Alfonso III which states that [his son-in-law] Fruela \"overcame the rebellious Basques and took for himself a wife from their territory named Munia\" . His name is confirmed by the Sebastiani Chronicon which records the burial of [his son-in-law and daughter] \"Froila cum uxore sua Munia Oveti\" . His birth date range is estimated very approximately from the likely birth date of his daughter Munia (see below). m as her first husband, [de Asturias], daughter of [FRUELA] & his wife --- ([730/35]-). She married secondly Lope ---. Her parentage and second marriage are confirmed by Ibn Hayyan who records a campaign in 816 led by [el] hayib Abd al-Karim ibn Abd al-Wahid ibn Mugit against Balask al-Yalasqi señor de Pamplona, during the course of which Garsiya ibn Lubb, hijo de la hermana de Barmud, el tío materno de Idfuns... was killed . This assumes that the phrase el tío materno de Idfuns applies to Garsiya ibn Lubb not to Barmud. Martínez Díez assumes that Barmud was Vermudo I King of Asturias . Her first marriage is confirmed by reading the same text of Ibn Hayyan together with the Sebastiani Chronicon which records the burial of [her daughter by her first marriage and her son-in-law] \"Froila cum uxore sua Munia Oveti\" [therefore recording Munia´s patronymic)] . This assumes that Idfuns in Ibn Hayyan refers to Alfonso II King of Asturias. It does not necessarily follow from this logic that this person was the daughter of Fruela, father of King Vermudo I: she could alternatively have been the daughter of Fruela´s wife by an earlier marriage. If she was the daughter of Fruela, she must have been one of his older children, considerably older than King Vermudo. The dates associated with her two children strongly suggest that Overo was her first husband and Lope her second. Oveco & his wife had one child:\n\na)MUNIA Ovéquiz ([745/50]-[768]) . The Chronicle of Alfonso III states that Fruela \"overcame the rebellious Basques and took for himself a wife from their territory named Munia\" . Her birth date is estimated from the birth of her son, estimated to [765]. The Sebastiani Chronicon records that \"Froila cum uxore sua Munia Oveti\" were buried in 768 . Her geographical origin is confirmed more precisely by the Chronicle of Alfonso III which records that [her son] Alfonso, after he was displaced by Maugerato, fled to Álava where he was received by his mother's relatives . m FRUELA I King of Asturias, son of ALFONSO I King of Asturias & his wife Ermesinda de Asturias ([740]-murdered Cangas de Onís 768).\n\n1.EILO (-after [866]). Conde en Álava. The Chronicon de Sampiro records that Alfonso III King of Asturias captured Álava and that Eylonem comes illorum was taken to Oviedo in chains, dated to [866] .\n\n1.JIMENO --- ([800/30]-). His birth date range is estimated assuming that his son was adult when first mentioned as conde. No record has been found relating to Jimeno, other than as indicated by the patronymic of his son. m ---. The name of Jimeno´s wife is not known. Jimeno & his wife had one child:\n\na)VELA Jiménez (-after [883]). Conde en Álava. The Chronicon Albeldense records that Didacus filius Ruderici erat comes in Castella during the reign of King Alfonso III, dated to 882, while Vigila Scemeniz was comes in Alava and attacked Castile and arrived at castrum...Ponte curbem . The same source records the defence of Álava against Muslim incursions (dated to [883]) and states era conde de Alava Vela Ximenez who ruled under Alfonso III King of Asturias . m ---. The name of Vela's wife is not known. Vela & his wife had [two] children:\n\ni) [JIMENO Velaz (-after 6 Apr [959]). Only the patronymic suggests that Jimeno Velaz may have been the son of Vela Jiménez. Jimeno Velaz signed among the first subscribers of all the charters quoted below, indicating a position of seniority among the Navarrese nobility and therefore that he may have been the son of a conde. The chronology, however, is not ideal. If Vela Jiménez died soon after 882, it is not obvious that he would have had a son who is first named in charters in [952]. \" Eximinus Vigilanus \" subscribed a charter dated 5 Sep [952] for the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla . \"Garsea Sancionis cum matre mea Tota\" donated property to the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla by charter dated Sep 957, confirmed by \" Eximinus Beile \" . \"Garsea Sancionis rex cum coniuge mea Tarasia regina\" donated property to the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla by charter dated Sep 957, confirmed by \"Didacus comes, Ranimiro comes, Eximinus Vigilanis, Lope Garseanis\" . \"Garsea Sancionis rex cum genitrice mea Tota regina\" donated property to the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla by charter dated 6 Apr [959], confirmed by \" Furtunius Garseanis, Eximinus Vigilanis, Lope Garseanis \" .]\n\nii) [MUNIO Velaz (-after 919) . Conde en Álava. The dating clause of a charter of the monastery of Valpuesta dated 18 May 919 names comite Monnio Uigilazi in Alaba . Salazar Acha suggests the Munio Velaz Conde de Álava may have been the brother of a hypothetical Nuño Velaz who, he suggests, was ancestor of the Vela family in the kingdom of León (see ASTURIAS, GALICIA, LEON NOBILITY), basing his suggestion on the assumption that Nuño´s supposed oldest son Vela Núñez was named after his paternal grandfather . From a chronological point of view, this hypothesis does not appear consistent with the suggested co-identity of Munio Velaz Conde en Álava with Munio Conde de Vizcaya, shown below, as the known children of the latter would have been many years younger than their supposed cousins, the children of this hypothetical Nuño Velaz. same person as ? MUNIO (-before 931) . Conde de Vizcaya: The Codex de Roda names \"domni Momi comitis Bizcahiensis\" when recording his marriage . The source, however, does not specify his patronymic. It is therefore not certain that it refers to the same Conde Munio who was recorded earlier as conde de Álava. However, the title conde was granted infrequently during this period and no reference has yet been found to another Conde Munio in the early 10th century. Given that the title was granted on a personal basis without territorial qualification, it is not impossible that the same nobleman may have held land in both Álava and Vizcaya and therefore that he could be described as conde in both territories in different primary sources. According to Llorente, Munio Conde de Vizcaya was the same person as Munio López . However, in his commentary he states (without citing his primary source) that Munio López inherited the county of Vizcaya after his father was killed in battle, dating the event to 939. Assuming that this date is correct, this co-identity does not appear possible in view of the second and third marriages of Munios wife Velasquita which are recorded in other sources. m (after 923) as her first husband, VELASQUITA de Navarra, daughter of SANCHO I García King of Navarre & his second wife Toda Aznárez. The Codex de Roda names \"Garsea rex et domna Onneca et domna Sanzia et domna Urraca domna Belasquita, necnon et domna Orbita\" as the children of \"Sanzio Garseanis\" and his wife \"Tota Asnari\", stating that Velasquita married \"domni Momi comitis Bizcahiensis\", secondly \"domni Galindi filium Uernardi comitis et domne Tute\" and thirdly \"Furtunio Galindonis\" . The patronymic of Velasquita´s first husband is not named in this source. As noted above, it is not certain therefore that he was the same person as Munio Velaz. She married secondly ([930]) Galindo de Ribagorza, and thirdly Fortún Galíndez Señor en Nájera. Munio & his wife had four children:\n\n(1)AZNAR Muñoz . The Codex de Roda names \"Azenari Momiz et Lupe Momiz hac Sanzio Momiz et domna Belasquita\" as the children of \"domni Momi comitis Bizcahiensis\" and his wife Velasquita . He and his brothers are named with their mother (and her third husband) at Nájera shortly after 931 , and are also referred to by Salazar Acha, who says that nothing is known about them .\n\n(2)LOPE Muñoz (-[1015]) . The Codex de Roda names \"Azenari Momiz et Lupe Momiz hac Sanzio Momiz et domna Belasquita\" as the children of \"domni Momi comitis Bizcahiensis\" and his wife Velasquita . same person as ? LOPE . Llorente states that Lope Muñoz was señor de Vizcaya and the father of Íñigo López but cites no primary source in support . This co-identity appears impossible, firstly because a source quoted below suggests that Íñigo López´s father was Lope Velásquez, and secondly because of chronological difficulties, as the death of Iñigo López can be fixed to [1077], far too late for him to have been the son of Lope Muñoz.\n\n(3)SANCHO Muñoz . The Codex de Roda names \"Azenari Momiz et Lupe Momiz hac Sanzio Momiz et domna Belasquita\" as the children of \"domni Momi comitis Bizcahiensis\" and his wife Velasquita .\n\n(4)VELASQUITA Muñoz . The Codex de Roda names \"Azenari Momiz et Lupe Momiz hac Sanzio Momiz et domna Belasquita\" as the children of \"domni Momi comitis Bizcahiensis\" and his wife Velasquita .\n\n1.HERRAMEL --- ([860/70]-). The family of Herramel is described by Luis Fernández . His birth date is estimated on the assumption that his son was adult when first mentioned. m ---. One child:\n\na)ÁLVARO Herraméliz (-after 11 Jan 931) .  Alvari Ferraneliz  witnessed the charter dated 21 Oct 923 under which Ordoño II King of León restored the monastery of Santa Coloma in Rioja . He took part in the capture of Nájera and Viguera with Ordoño II King of León . Conde en Álava in [926] . The dating clause of a charter dated 11 Jan 931, under which the people of Viguera donated property to the monastery of San Martín de Albelda, names \"regnante principe Semeno Garseanis in Pampilona, comes Alvaro Arramelliz in Alava\" . m ([924]) as her second husband, SANCHA Sánchez de Navarra, widow of ORDOÑO II King of León, daughter of SANCHO I Garces King of Navarre & his second wife Toda Aznárez de Larraún (after 900-[9 Jun 952/26 Dec 955]). The Codex de Roda names \"Garsea rex et domna Onneca et domna Sanzia et domna Urraca domna Belasquita, necnon et domna Orbita\" as the children of \"Sanzio Garseanis\" and his wife \"Tota Asnari\", stating that Sancha married \"Ordonii imperatoris, postea Albaro Harramelliz de Alaba, demumque Fredenando comitis\" . She continued to govern the condado of Álava after the death of her husband , but married thirdly ([932]) as his first wife, Fernando González Conde de Castilla. Álvaro & [his wife] had [one child]:\n\ni) [HERRAMEL Álvarez ([925/30]-after 24 Dec 988) . The primary source which confirms his parentage has not yet been identified, but the unusual combination of name and patronymic suggest that it is probably correct. There is no indication of the identity of his mother: he may have been born from an earlier otherwise unrecorded marriage of his father. Pelagius...episcopus [bishop of Iria]...et...Trastaloni conversa, et Fredenanda uxor...Garseani et Harramelle Aluariz...cum uxore et filiis meis, et Santia, Asiulfu Lucidi, Uelasco Ueligaz donated villa nostra propria et de Garsias Furtuniz...villa de Sancto Iuliano territorio Cauarcos to Celanova by charter dated 17 Dec 978, confirmed by Pelagius Yriense...episcopus, Honega prolis Lucidi, Trastaloni conuerse, Fredenanda uxor ipsius Garseani, Harramelle Aluariz...cum uxor et filiis meis, Santia, Asiulfu Lucidi, Uelasco Uelasquiz, Adaulfus abba, Litus abba, Sandino Muniz, Munniu Garsias . Herramel´s family relationships with the other donors, all of whom held interests in the property donated jointly, have not been traced. ...Harramel Aluariz... subscribed the charter dated 1 Jan 986 under which Vermudo II King of León confirmed mandationem in territorio Bubalo, Ablutinos cum Barra to Celanova . ...Harramelle Aluariz... subscribed the charter dated 24 Dec 988 under which Vermudo II King of León donated homines...in Uangueses cum incommuniatos de Cegio to Celanova .]\n\n- GALICIA - HERRAMÉLIZ FAMILY.\n\n1. [VELA (-after 933) . Conde. Lucas de Tuy (dated to [1236]) records that \"in Castella et in Alaua adolescens...comes generosus...Vela\" rebelled against Fernando González Conde de Castilla (dated therefore to some time after 932) and sought refuge \"ad Sarracenos\" after he was expelled from the county . This comes...Vela has not been identified in earlier primary sources in Álava, but his name suggests a family connection with Vela Jiménez. Salazar Acha, in his study of the Vela family in León, doubts the historical accuracy of this passage and suggests that Vela was a literary creation, although maybe representing an amalgam of different historical personages, probably inspired by the epic Romanz del Infant García which recounts the assassination of García Sánchez Conde de Castilla in 1029 by the sons of Conde Vela . However, from a chronological point of view he could have been the same person as Vela Núñez, who is recorded in several charters of Sahagún monastery with the title conde in the kingdom of León. The assassination is recorded by Lucas de Tuy who states that \"Burgensium...comite...infante Garsia\" arrived in León to marry Sancha, sister of Vermudo III King of León, but was killed by \"filii Velæ comitis\" .]\n\n1.SARRACINO (-after 921). \"Didaco comite\" donated property to the monastery of San Felices de Oca, by charter dated 15 Mar 863, witnessed by \"Gomaze, Gogenellu, Sarrazino \" . \"Didaco comite\" donated property to the monastery of San Felices de Oca, by charter dated 864, witnessed by \"Gomaze, Gonellu, Sarrazino \" . Sarracino witnessed the (undated, dated to the early 10th century) confirmation by Gundisalvo Fernandiz comite of the charter of Monnio Nunnez et uxor mea Argilo in favour of Brañosera . m ---.

He was recorded in the Crónica General .] m SANCHA Sánchez, daughter of SANCHO Núñez Señor en Durango & his wife Íñiga Aznárez. Llorente records her parentage and marriage but does not cite the primary source on which it is based . Lope & his wife had [two] children:\n\ni) [MUNIO López (-[950]) . Llorente states that he was señor de Vizcaya and records his parentage but does not cite the primary source on which it is based . According to Llorente, Munio López was the same person as Munio Conde de Vizcaya who married Velasquita de Navarra . However, this co-identity does not appear possible in view of the second and third marriages of Munio´s wife Velasquita which are recorded in other sources, and assuming that Llorente correctly reports the dates of death of Munio López´s father and of Munio López himself. m [ELVIRA Vermúdez, daughter of VERMUDO Laínez & his wife Teresa Núñez. The Nobiliario of Pedro Conde de Barcelos names \"D. Rodrigo Vermuiz, D. Elvira Vermuiz, de que vienen los de Biscaya\" as the children of \"Vermui Lainez\", adding in a later passage that she married \"Fortum Froes señor de Biscaya\" . Llorente adapts this by recording Elvira Vermúdez but adding that she married Munio López (without citing the primary source on which it is based), assuming that she was Munio´s first wife as he states that his second wife was Velasquita de Navarra . It is uncertain whether Elvira Vermúdez was historical or fictitious.] Munio & his wife had [two] children:\n\n(a) [ÍÑIGO Muñoz (-[990]). Llorente states that he was señor de Vizcaya and records his parentage but does not cite the primary source on which it is based, although adding that he is named in sources dated from 940 to 972 and that he died childless . The mid-14th Century Nobiliario of Pedro de Portugal Conde de Barcelós names don Lope Ortiz as the son of Frutan Froez and his wife, adding that he was con el conde Fernan Gonzalez en la lid de Almanzor and was father of don Diego Lopez . The Nobiliario proceeds by identifying this person as the father of Iñiguez Guerra señor de Vizcaya. All these references demonstrate how confused and unreliable are the reports concerning the early señores de Vizcaya.]\n\n(b) [MUNIA Muñoz .

This co-identity is indicated because of the common name and patronymic and also because of their similar age. However, Zambrana (Cembrana in the charter quoted below) is located south-east of Miranda de Ebro, in the present-day Spanish province of Álava. This is east of San Millán de Cogolla, whereas the other locations in connection with which the other Gonzalo Álvarez is named are to its west in the county of Castile, near Burgos. It is possible, therefore, that there were two different persons named Gonzalo Álvarez. This is suggested also because of the apparent connections between Gonzalo Álvarez of Castile/Burgos and a set of [four] brothers, related to the family of Gonzalo Salvadórez, who are shown in the document ASTURIAS, CASTILLA, GALICIA, LEÓN NOBILITY. It should also be noted that the names of two of the sons of Gonzalo Álvarez in Zambrana are typically Navarrese (Lope and Jimeno) are not found in the supposed family of Gonzalo Álvarez in Castile/Burgos, in which no Martín has been found either.

Tecla Díaz, wife of Lope Iñíguez, was the daughter of a Diego Álvarez, as shown by the charter dated 14 Mar 1079 under which \"domna Ticlo, filia de senior Didado Alvarez\" donated property to the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla, with the consent of \"domno meo comite Lope Ennecones\", confirmed by \"comite Gundissalvo, sennor Didaco Alvarez pater meus, Martinus Sanchiz \" . Two possible individuals named Diego Álvarez have been identified who could have been her father, firstly Diego Álvarez señor de Oca (see the document ASTURIAS, GALICIA, LEON NOBILITY), secondly Diego Álvarez son of Marcelo. At first sight, the chronology seems to favour the first possibility. However, the second case (which is assumed to be correct by Fortún Pérez de Ciriza ) is not impossible on the basis of the facts which are currently known. The validity of this second case depends on confirming the approximate dates of birth of Marcelo´s children, which has not so far been possible. If it can be assumed that Marcelo´s wife Andregoto was very old when she died, it is possible that their children were born in the late 1030s/1040s, which would be consistent with the wife of Lope Iñíguez being their granddaughter. However, Marcelo and Andregoto´s other grandson Álvaro Muñoz el Viejo was alive in 1183, which seems inconsistent with this theory. At present there is insufficient information to exclude either possible parentage. Tecla is therefore shown in both places, until more information comes to light. \"Aldefonsus imperator tocius Castelle et Toleto necnon et Nazare seu Alave\" donated property to the monastery of San Millán de Cogollo, at the request of \"comite domno Lope cum coniuge sua domna Ticlo\", by charter dated 1091 . \"Tecla comitissa filia Didaco Albaroyz\" donated her property at Villa Farta to Santa Maria de Pamplona for the soul of \"comitis de Lupi de Alaua et Bizcaya mariti mei\" with the consent of \"filiis meis Didaco, Sancie et filia Tota et Santia et Taresa\" by charter dated Jan 1094 . \"Domna Ticlo cometissa\" chose to be buried in the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla by charter dated 1104, naming \"meus pater Didaco Alvarez\", and witnessed by \"filios meos Tota Lopez, Sancia Lopez, Didaco Lopez, Sancio Lopez, Teresa Lopez \" . m (before 14 Mar 1079) LOPE Iñíguez Señor de Vizcaya, son of ÍÑIGO Lopez \"Ezquerra\" Conde and Señor de Vizcaya & his wife Toda Fortúnez (-[1093]).]\n\n(c)URRACA Díaz (-after 25 Jul 1109).

This co-identity appears impossible, firstly because the source quoted above suggests that Íñigo López´s father was Lope Velásquez, and secondly because of chronological difficulties, as the death of Iñigo López can be fixed to [1077] as shown below, far too late for him to have been the son of Lope Muñoz.
