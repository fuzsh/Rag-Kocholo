        "text": "In early November 2023, a delegation from HSE University visited the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shenzhen. HSE University representatives took part in CUHK-Shenzhen 2023 International Partner Day and discussed the existing student exchange agreement with colleagues from China.\n\nThe HSE University delegation led by Valeria Sokolova, Director of the Centre for International Student Mobility, took part in CUHK-Shenzhen 2023 International Partner Day following an invitation from the university’s Chinese partners. This year, the event was attended by representatives of 67 universities from various countries, which provided an excellent opportunity to showcase HSE University’s mobility programmes on the international stage.\n\nFounded in 2014, the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shenzhen (CUHKSZ) is a mainland branch of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The Chinese University of Hong Kong ranks 47th in the QS World University Rankings 2024 and 17th in the Times Higher Education Most International Universities 2023.\n\n‘The reports by faculty representatives during the official part of the event and the informal conversations afterwards gave us a more detailed understanding of the study areas at CUHKSZ that may be especially attractive to HSE University students. We also noted Chinese university students’ interest in participating in summer schools, which could become another promising area of ​​cooperation between our universities,’ said Valeria Sokolova.\n\nDuring the Exchange Fair, which was part of International Partner Day, representatives of HSE University were able to talk to Chinese students directly. ‘We learned about how they see Russia, tried to dispel some stereotypes and fears, talked about mobility opportunities at HSE University, and gave out information materials and souvenirs,’ said Tatiana Gremyakina, Manager of the Centre for International Student Mobility. She also expressed hope that personal communication would encourage Chinese students to come to HSE University as early as the next academic year and awaken even greater interest in Russia in general.\n\nThe HSE University representatives also learned more about the aspects of everyday life and culture that international students should be prepared for if they wish to study at CUHKSZ. During a panel discussion, exchange students and university representatives discussed how to cope with culture shock and get the most out of participating in a mobility programme. A tour around the campus gave an idea of ​​how the educational process and students’ leisure time are organised. The vast territory houses educational and administrative buildings, libraries, gyms, stadiums, and cafes. Students can live in one of seven campus residence halls, each with its own unique name and branding, as well as corporate culture and traditions.\n\nSince 2019, HSE University has collaborated with the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shenzhen as part of a student exchange agreement on behalf of the Faculty of Computer Science. One of the goals of the trip was also to strengthen student mobility within the framework of the existing agreement and to prepare a new agreement on academic exchange at the university level.\n\nAt the end of their trip, the HSE University delegation made a one-day visit to Hong Kong, where it held working meetings with representatives from the international offices of the University of Hong Kong and the City University of Hong Kong. During the meetings, the participants exchanged information about how the reception and support of exchange students is progressing and discussed further steps to enhance student mobility between universities."
