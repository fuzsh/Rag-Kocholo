        "text": "Shenzhen Geim Graphene Center\n\nIn December 2017, the Shenzhen Geim Graphene Center, jointly established by Tsinghua University and the Shenzhen Municipal Government, officially opened. The center is managed by the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee, and supported by Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute and Tsinghua SIGS.\n\nUnder the leadership of Professor Andre Geim, 2010 Nobel Prize winner in physics and one of graphene discoverers, the center will perform cutting-edge research on two-dimensional materials represented by graphene, and ultimately become a multi-functional service platform for research and development, standardization, and industrial testing.\n\nIn November 2019, the RISC-V International Open Source Laboratory (RIOS Lab) officially unveiled. Under the leadership of 2017 A.M. Turing Award winner Dr. David Patterson and operational support from TBSI, RIOS Lab will conduct cutting-edge research in RISC-V hardware and software technology. Patterson first proposed the Reduced Instruction Set (RISC) system, an open and free instruction set architecture enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration. Released in 2011, the latest Fifth Generation Reduced Instruction Set (RISC-V) has gained worldwide attention."
