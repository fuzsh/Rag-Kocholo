        "text": "The JV differs from previous collaborations as it involves not partner universities, but parent universities who establish a brand new university with legal person status under Chinese law. It’s worth stating here that, in the PRC, there is no such thing as a branch campus: collaborations involving foreign partners are either established within existing Chinese universities, or in the case of JVs, establish a new Chinese university. Unlike the majority of conventional joint ventures, JV universities are a form of cooperative JV where the foreign parent university’s contribution is measured in their intellectual property input, with financial investment being provided from the Chinese parent and, more often, the local government in the municipality or province where it is established. Currently there are 7 JV universities in operation:\n\nJoint Venture\n\nLocation\n\nChinese Parent\n\nForeign Parent\n\nLicence (Expiry)\n\nUniversity of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC)\n\n宁波诺丁汉大学\n\nNingbo, Zhejiang\n\n浙江宁波\n\nZhejiang Wanli University\n\n浙江万里学院\n\nUniversity of Nottingham (UK)\n\n2005*\n\n(2055)\n\nUnited International College (UIC)\n\n联合国际学院\n\nZhuhai, Guangdong\n\n广东珠海\n\nBeijing Normal University\n\n北京师范大学\n\nHong Kong Baptist University (HK)\n\n2005\n\n(2035)\n\nXi’an Jiaotong Liverpool University (XJTLU)\n\n西交利物浦大学\n\nSuzhou, Jiangsu\n\n江苏苏州\n\nXi’an Jiaotong University\n\n西安交通大学\n\nUniversity of Liverpool (UK)\n\n2006\n\n(2056)\n\nNYU Shanghai\n\n上海纽约大学\n\nShanghai\n\n上海\n\nEast China Normal Uni.\n\n华东师范大学\n\nNew York University (USA)\n\n2012\n\n(2021)\n\nDuke Kunshan University (DKU)\n\n昆山杜克大学\n\nKunshan, Jiangsu\n\n江苏昆山\n\nWuhan University\n\n武汉大学\n\nDuke University (USA)\n\n2013\n\n(2029)\n\nCUHK-Shenzhen\n\n香港中文大学（深圳）\n\nShenzhen, Guangdong\n\n广东深圳\n\nShenzhen University\n\n深圳大学\n\nChinese University of Hong Kong (HK)\n\n2014*\n\n(2044)\n\nWenzhou Kean University (WKU)\n\n温州肯恩大学\n\nWenzhou, Zhejiang\n\n浙江温州\n\nWenzhou University\n\n温州大学\n\nKean University (USA)\n\n2014*\n\n(2064)\n\n* Several universities were given conditional terms to recruit students prior to finalizing the JV licence. In each case, the first intake occurred in the year prior to the licence being granted.\n\nWhile the regulations under which these universities have been established are the same, there are great differences between these universities due in large part to the educational philosophy and vision of the leadership involved in their establishment. Another major factor affecting establishment and ongoing operations relates to the Chinese parent university and the location in which the JV is established. For example, NYU Shanghai’s Chinese parent is East China Normal University (ECNU), which is itself located in Shanghai. ECNU is a key national university under the jurisdiction on the Ministry of Education. All JVs, however, report to the provincial education bureau or municipal education commission in which they are established, even if their parent university is a national university reporting to the Ministry of Education. This is perhaps less of an issue for NYU Shanghai who are in the same municipality as ECNU, their Chinese parent university, and who necessarily have strong existing relationships with the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and other government bodies in Shanghai. However, compare this with XJTLU or DKU, who are both located in Jiangsu Province but whose parent universities are from Xi’an (Shaanxi) and Wuhan (Hubei) respectively, and there is an added complication in establishing relationships with the provincial education authorities; pricing bureaus who set the tuition fees, and other government bodies involved in the establishment and smooth operation of a Chinese university.\n\nSino-Foreign JVs are fascinating examples of transnational higher education, and also of the experimental boldness of China’s higher education reforms. They have been permitted in order for China’s reformers to examine new and different approaches that may be adopted to address challenges in China’s vast and complex domestic higher education sector, especially with regard to China’s desire to internationalize their own universities and attract both foreign academics and students."
