        "text": "The Department of Health (DH) on Monday signed service agreements with five medical institutions under the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme (Pilot Scheme).\n\nThe Secretary for Health, Lo Chung-mau, witnessed the signing ceremony and saw the Director of Health, Ronald Lam Man-kin, sign the agreement with representatives of the five remaining medical institutions, which meant the full implementation of the Pilot Scheme this year.\n\nThe Pilot Scheme covers a total of seven medical institutions, among which the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, and its Nansha division, Zhongshan Chenxinghai Hospital, Dongguan Tungwah Hospital, launched the service on June 28 and July 18, respectively, allowing eligible Hong Kong elderly persons to use the EHCVs for outpatient healthcare services at the service points.\n\nFollowing the signing of agreements and successful implementation of the projects today, EHCVs will be allowed to be used at Shenzhen New Frontier United Family Hospital in Shenzhen, Shenzhen C.K.J Stomatological Hospital in Luohu, and Dental Bauhinia Specialty Service Center and General Care Center in Shenzhen, starting from August 14.\n\nTogether with the two service points operated by the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital at its hospital and the Huawei Li Zhi Yuan Community Health Service Center, along with the first two GBA service points, eligible Hong Kong elderly persons can use the EHCVs for outpatient healthcare services at seven GBA service points.\n\nThis offers more convenience and flexibility for eligible Hong Kong elderly persons residing in mainland cities in the GBA by providing more service points for them to better use their EHCVs on primary healthcare services to improve their health.\n\nThe spokesperson stated that the fees for the healthcare services provided by the three medical institutions in Shenzhen are denominated in Renminbi.\n\nThey will make EHCV claims for elderly persons, and the EHCV amount deducted in Hong Kong dollars will be calculated according to a monthly updated voucher conversion factor under the EHCV Scheme.\n\nThe monthly voucher conversion factor will be displayed at the cashier's office for the elderly's reference."
