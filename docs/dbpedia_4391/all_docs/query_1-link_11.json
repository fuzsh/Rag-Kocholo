It inherits the educational philosophy and academic systems of The Chinese University of Hong Kong and is committed to nurturing high-end talents with global perspective, Chinese tradition and social responsibility. It offers 4-year undergraduate programmes plus postgraduate studies at both master and doctorate levels. Currently with over 7000 undergraduate and postgraduate students, CUHK-Shenzhen offers programmes in science, engineering, management and economics, humanities and social science, life and health science, data science and medicine (from 2021 onwards). Most of the courses in CUHK-Shenzhen are taught in English.\n\nWith the strong support of the Shenzhen Government, CUHK-Shenzhen was given the responsibility to plan and establish the Shenzhen Conservatory of Music, initially as a School of the University, which will recruit the first batch of undergraduate students in 2021. The School of Music has 4 Streams namely Composition, Musicology, Performance and Dance. Recruitment for the 2021 cohort will begin with the Performance Streams listed above. Other majors in Performance (Chinese Music, Musical Theatre and Dance) will commence later. A purposely-built campus is planned for completion by end of 2024."
