        "text": "Credits\n\nCredit transfer process\n\nThe transfer credit process takes approximately 16 weeks following each submission deadline. You should allow sufficient time to meet important deadlines that may affect you (e.g. application for graduation, registration in courses that require prerequisites that you took on exchange, entry to a major/honours program, etc.)\n\nCourse Information\n\n* Students who have special requirements or require academic accommodation should contact a Go Global advisor regarding their needs at least six weeks prior to the application deadline.\n\nCourse information and restrictions\n\nA maximum of two courses may be taken in the School of Humanity and Social Science. There is currently no limit to courses in the School of Science and Engineering. Spaces in courses outside the business school are not guaranteed and requests will be considered on a case by case basis.\n\nFull course load information\n\nCUHK(SZ) uses the credit unit system. Courses are generally worth 3 units/credits each\n\nMinimum: 9 units per term\n\nMaximum: 18 units per term\n\nTransfer Credits And Equivalent Courses At This University\n\nCheck out the courses that previous students have transferred back to UBC in the last 5 years using our Course Search Tool. If you don't see a particular course you listed, it simply means you need to submit it as a new course request through the Transfer Credit Portal while on your Go Global experience. For more information, please visit the Go Global Transfer Credit webpage.\n\n*Areas of study at partner universities are subject to change. The tool is for reference only - research the partners' websites for additional course information.\n\nSearch courses now\n\nScholarships and awards\n\nThe Go Global Award $1000\n\nAll students accepted to Go Global for Exchange, Research Abroad, or Study Abroad travel programs are automatically considered for this award. If you meet the eligibility criteria, you'll be notified of your award after you're accepted to Go Global and after you get nominated to apply to the partner university.\n\nAdditional awards\n\nStudents who are eligible for awards may receive one UBC or UBC-affiliated international learning award. If you're eligible, you are always offered the highest-value award. Unless stated otherwise, you need to meet eligibility criteria set out by the University Senate regarding awards.\n\nCheck out international learning awards and eligibility.\n\nInformation for US students:\n\nIf you are a student from the United States, please check the US Department of Education Lookup Tool to ensure that any partner institution you wish to attend on Exchange is Title IV ‘eligible’ for Federal Student Aid for the year in which you intend to study there. For institutions outside of the US, select “Foreign Country” from the “State” dropdown menu.\n\nIf you attend an eligible institution, then you may receive Title IV federal student loans while on Exchange.\n\nIf you attend an ineligible institution:\n\nYou will not be eligible for US federal student loans,\n\nYou may invalidate any US student aid you have previously received for your studies at UBC,\n\nYou may be required to immediately begin repaying your US student loans, and\n\nYou may not be eligible for any future US student aid for the remainder of your studies at UBC."
