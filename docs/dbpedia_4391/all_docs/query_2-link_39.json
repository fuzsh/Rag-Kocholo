        "text": "Prudential plc (‘Prudential’, the ‘Company’ or the ‘Group’) today announced that Lilian Ng, Managing Director, Strategic Business Group, has decided to retire at the end of this year after a 30-year tenure with the company. Angel Ng, a former senior leader from Citi, will assume the role of Regional CEO, Greater China, Customer and Wealth. Reporting to Chief Executive Officer Anil Wadhwani and based in Hong Kong, Angel Ng will join the Group Executive Committee effective 1 October.\n\nLilian Ng became a member of the Group Executive Committee in July 2022, managing Prudential’s businesses in Greater China and leading the Group’s Customer and Distribution strategies. In 2015, she was appointed Chief Executive, Insurance, Asia, responsible for leading the life insurance businesses and operational performance across the region.\n\nCommending Lilian Ng’s contributions, Anil Wadhwani said: “As a veteran of Prudential and the insurance industry, Lilian has a distinguished career in growing our business in Asia with outsized impact. She has made a significant impact on our people, our agency force, and deepened relations with strategic bank partners. She played a pivotal role in building our scaled multi-distribution platform and driving transformative growth for our businesses in Greater China. I would like to express our deep gratitude for her leadership and significant contributions to Prudential over the past decades.”\n\nAngel Ng brings with her 25 years of experience in financial services. Most recently, Angel Ng led all lines of business in Citi’s Asia North & Australia Cluster including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Earlier in her career, Angel Ng was Head of Asia for Citi Global Wealth, overseeing Asia Private Bank and Consumer Banking, as well as serving as CEO for Citi Hong Kong and Macau. Angel Ng is actively involved in various boards and committees across the Hong Kong community and is an Adjunct Professor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and City University of Hong Kong.\n\nCommenting on the appointment, Anil Wadhwani said: “Angel’s deep experience in Greater China, distribution, customer and wealth management, combined with her entrepreneurial mindset, make her the ideal candidate to lead the Greater China markets, in additional to spearheading the group-wide Customer pillar and Wealth enabler. Her appointment is another step towards strengthening our capabilities in alignment with the business strategy unveiled in August 2023.”\n\nLilian Ng will remain in her current role until the end of the year to facilitate a seamless transition. She will then become an advisor to the Chief Executive Officer, until June 2025.\n\nMedia Investors/Analysts Sonia Tsang +852 5580 7525 Patrick Bowes +852 9611 2981 Kho Hui-Yi +852 6298 9676 William Elderkin +44 (0)20 3977 9215 Darwin Lam +852 2918 6348\n\nAbout Prudential plc\n\nPrudential plc provides life and health insurance and asset management in 24 markets across Asia and Africa.
