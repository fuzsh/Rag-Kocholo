        "text": "RIYADH: In a bid to strengthen Saudi Arabia’s knowledge exchange with China, the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology has signed cooperation agreements with several institutions in Shenzhen to enhance research, development and innovation.\n\nThe memorandums of understanding came during a visit to the university by a high-level delegation headed by Shenzhen Mayor Qin Weizhong and 50 representatives from various institutions in the city.\n\nThese MoUs could strengthen bilateral ties in industrial innovation, technology transfer, research, talent exchange, training programs and entrepreneurship.\n\nRepresentatives of Tsinghua University, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, and Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen signed the MoUs with KAUST.\n\nShenzen’s Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen InnoX Academy and Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data also signed agreements with the Saudi institution.\n\n“Our collaboration with esteemed Shenzhen institutions embodies one of KAUST’s primary objectives to enhance the commercialization of our research and promote global research partnerships and talent cultivation. These synergies will amplify our influence and bring tangible benefits to the Kingdom,” said KAUST President Tony Chan in a statement.\n\nFurthermore, the MoUs emphasize joint innovation, entrepreneurship, talent exchange and training efforts.\n\nShenzhen, one of China’s foremost technological hubs and the country’s third-most economically and technically advanced city, is a crucial ally in strengthening the innovation ecosystem in the Kingdom.\n\nThe city’s standing as a prominent international research and technology hub further cements its position by engaging with top corporations, researchers and innovation experts in Shenzhen.\n\nThis collaboration is a crucial pillar of KAUST’s recent strategic unveiling, announced last month. It is poised to expedite Saudi Arabia’s progress toward sustainability, thus contributing to the Kingdom’s renewable energy goals.\n\nThe university encourages partnerships with global universities and innovation hubs as part of this initiative.\n\nOn Aug. 21, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman unveiled the new strategy for KAUST. Under the new plan, the Kingdom allocated a SR750 million ($200 million) fund for early investment in local and international high-tech companies.\n\nThe strategy also aims to transform research into economically productive innovations by focusing on the national priorities for research, development and innovation.\n\nBEIJING: Oil prices paused recent advances to trade in a range on Tuesday, after a surge of more than 7 percent in the previous three sessions, on supply concerns prompted by fears of a wider Middle East conflict and the potential shutdown of Libyan oil fields, according to Reuters.\n\nBrent crude futures was up 3 cents at $81.46 a barrel by 09:30 a.m. Saudi time, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures dropped 6 cents to $77.36 a barrel.\n\n“Losses in oil prices may seem contained in today’s session, which suggests prices taking a breather following a sharp rally over the past few days,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG.\n\n“With the jump in oil prices pricing for geopolitical risks in the Middle East and a production halt in Libya, market participants are now in some wait-and-see to assess further developments.”\n\nThe rise of the previous three sessions was driven by expectations of US interest rate cuts that could boost fuel demand, military assaults between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon over the weekend that threaten a wider Middle East conflict, disrupting supply from the key producing region and the risk of Libyan closures.\n\nOver that period, WTI gained 7.6 percent and Brent gained 7 percent.\n\nOilfields in eastern Libya responsible for almost all its production will be closed and production and exports halted, the eastern-based administration said on Monday, after a flare-up in tension over the leadership of the central bank.\n\nThere was no confirmation from the internationally recognized government in Tripoli or from the National Oil Corp, which controls the country’s oil resources.\n\nThe political dispute could affect almost all of the 1.17 million barrels per day of output from the North African country, based on data from the latest Reuters survey of production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in July.\n\nWhile bearish demand sentiment could weigh on oil prices, with Chinese demand having an outsized impact, the potential closure of Libya’s oil fields would tighten supply and brake declining oil prices, said Vortexa analyst Serena Huang.\n\n“Other oil producers would be rejoicing at the higher oil prices, and may not necessarily bring in additional supply immediately.”\n\nOil has also been supported by the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, with a major exchange of missiles between them as Hezbollah attempts to retaliate for the killing of a senior commander last month.\n\n“Markets remain on edge as skirmishes between Israel and Hezbollah intensify,” ANZ analysts said in a note.\n\nA top US general said on Monday the danger of a broader war had eased somewhat but that an Iran strike on Israel remained a risk.\n\nRIYADH: The number of pharmaceutical and medical device factories in Saudi Arabia has reached 206, with investments totaling SR10 billion ($2.6 billion), according to official data.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources reported that this growth includes 56 pharmaceutical factories licensed by the Saudi Food and Drug Authority, with investments in the pharmaceutical sector alone exceeding SR7 billion.\n\nThe medical device sector in Saudi Arabia has seen notable advancements. Globally, this market is valued at $500 billion, with Saudi Arabia's share estimated at $6.6 billion.\n\nThe Kingdom now boasts 150 licensed medical device factories, representing a 200 percent increase since 2018. Investments in this sector have reached SR3.1 billion, with notable achievements including the production of advanced respiratory devices, insulin syringes, and specialized surgical instruments.\n\nThis expansion aligns with the ministry’s broader efforts to localize the pharmaceutical industry and reduce reliance on imports.\n\nGlobally, the pharmaceutical market is valued at approximately $1.1 trillion, with the Middle East and Africa accounting for $31 billion of this total.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the largest pharmaceutical market in the region, holds a $10 billion share, representing 32 percent of the market.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2023, the Saudi pharmaceutical market grew by 25 percent, rising from $8 billion to $10 billion annually.\n\nThis growth highlights a successful push toward localization, with the Kingdom reducing its dependence on pharmaceutical imports from 80 percent in 2019 to 70 percent by 2023.\n\nIn June 2022, the ministry announced over SR11 billion in new investment opportunities in the vaccine and biopharmaceutical sectors, aligning with the Kingdom’s strategic goals of enhancing health security and establishing Saudi Arabia as a hub for pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical production.\n\nGovernment initiatives, such as the “Made in Saudi” program, have also been instrumental in this expansion by promoting local products on international platforms.\n\nThe ministry has focused on enhancing value chains by fostering collaborations in research and development and securing essential raw materials locally.\n\nThe Kingdom aims to localize 80-90 percent of its government procurement needs for insulin and vaccines while also attracting foreign investments in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s industrial sector demonstrated notable resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ministry quickly ramped up domestic production capacity for essential medical supplies, increasing the daily output of medical masks from 450,000 to 3 million.\n\nIn just three months, the number of hand sanitizer factories grew from 12 to 70. These efforts highlight the Kingdom's ability to respond effectively to global supply chain disruptions and further solidify its growing prominence in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index closed at 12,261.18 points on Monday, losing 1.46 points, or 0.01 percent.\n\nMSCI Tadawul 30 Index lost 0.40 points or 0.03 percent to finish at 1,536.44.\n\nThe parallel market, Nomu, also fell 256.47 points, or 0.96 percent, to conclude the day at 26,433.91.\n\nThe main index posted a trading value of SR9 billion ($2.4 billion), with 85 stocks advancing and 137 declining. On the other hand, Nomu has 26 gainers and 40 losers, reporting a trade volume of SR35.9 million.\n\nAl-Baha Investment and Development Co. was the top performer on TASI as its share price surged 8.33 percent to SR0.13. Saudi Real Estate Co. also jumped 6.33 percent to SR22.86.\n\nSaudi Pharmaceutical Industries and Medical Appliances Corp. was also among the top gainers, climbing 4.99 percent to SR33.65. Al-Omran Industrial Trading Co. and Saudi Research and Media Group rose 4.49 percent and 3.48 percent to SR40.75 and SR261.40, respectively.\n\nSavola Group was the day’s worst performer, with its share price dipping 5.01 percent to SR25.60.\n\nWafrah for Industry and Development Co. and Herfy Food Services Co. also performed poorly with their stocks dropping by 3.62 percent and 2.90 percent, to close at SR41.25 and SR26.80, respectively.\n\nSaudi Automotive Services Co. and Kingdom Holding Co. were also among the worst performers.\n\nSavola Group’s share price drop followed shareholder approval of a board recommendation to increase the company’s capital through a rights issue aimed at strengthening its financial position and supporting future investments.\n\nThe capital increase will involve offering 600 million ordinary shares at SR10 per share, raising a total of SR6 billion. This move will more than double Savola’s capital from SR5.34 billion to SR11.34 billion, enabling the company to pay off debts and distribute shares in Almarai Co. to eligible shareholders.\n\nThe rights issue will be available to shareholders registered at the close of trading on the day of the extraordinary general assembly meeting, with eligibility being finalized two days later.\n\nThis capital increase will result in a 112.36 percent rise in the company’s share count, expanding from 533.98 million shares to 1.13 billion shares.\n\nIn a separate bourse filing, Rawasi Albina Investment Co. reported a SR9.4 million loss for the first half of the year. The company’s net profit saw a significant drop from SR15.1 million in the same period last year, primarily due to increased spending on project implementation and operational capacity. Revenue also decreased by 59.5 percent year on year to SR38 million, down from SR94.2 million.\n\nMohammed Hasan AlNaqool Sons Co. also announced its financial results for the same period, witnessing a 55.7 percent growth in revenue.\n\nThe company’s sales reached SR29,233 in the first half of the year, up from SR18,770 in the same period last year. This was mainly attributed to an increase in revenue from subsidiaries.\n\nNet profit also increased to SR1,201, up from a loss of SR652 last year.\n\nKUWAIT: Qatar agreed on Monday to supply Kuwait with 3 million tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas for 15 years, the second such deal since 2020 as Kuwait imports the fuel to help meet rising demand for power generation.\n\nThe chief executives of state-owned QatarEnergy and Kuwait Petroleum Corp. signed the long-term sales and purchase agreement for LNG in Kuwait. Deliveries will start in January 2025, KPC CEO Sheikh Nawaf Al-Sabah said.\n\nReuters reported last week that QatarEnergy and KPC were in talks for the deal.\n\nKuwait, an OPEC member and a major oil producer, has been boosting its reliance on imported gas to meet power demand, especially in the summer when consumption by air conditioning systems rises sharply. KPC also aims to ramp up its own gas output as part of a strategy that targets higher oil production capacity too.\n\nLast week, Kuwait faced a second round of scheduled power outages this summer due to a lapse in local gas supply, despite officials indicating there would be no more cuts after the first round in June. Summer temperatures regularly soar above 50 degrees Celsius or 122 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe deal will play “a pivotal role in electricity generation in Kuwait,” Sheikh Nawaf said.\n\nHe declined to disclose the deal’s value, saying it was confidential.\n\nQatar this year announced a further expansion of its North Field project that will cement it as one of the world’s top LNG exporters. The project will boost the North Field’s LNG output to 142 mtpa from 77 mtpa by 2030.\n\nThe LNG from the new supply deal for Kuwait could be partly from the North Field expansion project and partly from Qatar’s existing output, said QatarEnergy CEO Saad Al-Kaabi, who is also Qatar’s state minister for energy. It will be delivered to Kuwait’s Al Zour port.\n\nKuwait and Qatar agreed in 2020 a 15-year deal for the supply of 3 mtpa of LNG from 2022, which will overlap with the new deal."
