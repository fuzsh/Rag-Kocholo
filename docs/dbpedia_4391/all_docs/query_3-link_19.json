        "text": "Greetings from The Chinese University of Hong Kong\n\nWhat will Asian universities look like in 2050? How will the Asian higher education system evolve over the coming decades? What will Asian universities contribute to global higher education? And how will the region emerge from the pandemic and be resilient against global and regional challenges?\n\nThese are all fundamental questions for the future of our sector and, at CUHK, as we seek to define our role in the region and expand our impact around the world.\n\nWe are thrilled to be hosting the THE Asia Universities Summit in our 60th anniversary year, a major milestone for the university which is deeply rooted in Chinese culture and heritage while being one of the world’s most international universities.\n\nWith a founding mission to connect China and the world, CUHK is uniquely positioned to serve as a conduit for the world’s higher education leaders to discuss the big issues facing Asia’s universities over the coming decades.\n\nHong Kong – Asia’s world city – is emerging as a major international innovation and technology hub and offers global partners a launch pad to connect with the rapidly developing Guangdong – Hong Kong – Macao Great Bay Area. The summit will be an exciting opportunity for the world’s university leaders to reconnect with Hong Kong and engage directly in one of the world’s most dynamic and exciting regions in science, technology, and education.\n\nI look forward to welcoming you to CUHK.\n\nProfessor Rocky S. Tuan\n\nVice-chancellor and president\n\nThe Chinese University of Hong Kong\n\nCampus environment\n\nThe 137.3-hectare CUHK main campus overlooking the beautiful Tolo Harbour is the largest, greenest and most sustainably designed in Hong Kong. It houses a comprehensive range of learning facilities as well as cultural, sports, and social amenities essential for a well-rounded campus experience. Conveniently located next to MTR’s University Station, the campus is home to an extensive range of accommodation that provides eligible students with the choice of a residential university experience.\n\nGlobal engagement\n\nCUHK plays an active part in international academic networks and alliances, including the Worldwide Universities Network, the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, the International Universities Climate Alliance, the Alliance of International Science Organisations in the Belt & Road Region and the UK-China Humanities Alliance for Higher Education among others. Strong links have been forged with over 460 universities and partners in some 40 countries and regions around the world."
