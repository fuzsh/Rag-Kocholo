        "text": "Washington University-Fudan University Executive MBA Program in Shanghai\n\nIn 2002, Washington University’s Olin Business School entered a partnership with Fudan University, a collaboration that marked the first management education joint venture in China. Since then, the Executive MBA Program in Shanghai has prepared China’s top executives for global leadership positions. It has been ranked among the best programs in mainland China.\n\n“The fact that our program continues to soar is a testament to the commitment and passion of everyone involved—students, staff and faculty,” said Markus Baer, Olin professor of organizational behavior and vice dean of executive education.”\n\nWashington University-Fudan University Dual-Degree LLM Program\n\nJingsheng (Lucy) Yang, a member of the first cohort of the Washington University School of Law dual-degree program with Fudan University Law School, graduated in May of 2020. “Through this program, not only have I learned how to think like a lawyer,” she said, “but also established a global perspective towards social and legal issues that will benefit me for the rest of my life.”\n\nThe program builds upon Fudan University’s significant role with Washington University’s McDonnell International Scholars Academy. Students in Fudan University’s Juris Master program study for one year at Fudan University, then pursue a Master of Laws (LLM) for one year at Washington University before returning to Fudan to complete their degree requirements. Additionally, faculty from both universities participate in visiting scholar and visiting professor programs through ongoing exchanges.\n\nMaster of Social Policy (MSP) Global Dual-Degree Program\n\nThis dual degree program is offered by the Brown School at Washington University in St. Louis in partnership with select global partner programs. Students in select graduate programs at the following universities may be eligible to apply: East China University for Sciences and Technology, Fudan University, Hebrew University, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Nankai University, Peking University, Renmin University of China and Xi’an Jiaotong University. The program is designed to prepare the next generation of leaders in global social policy.\n\nTaiwan Ministry of Education Fellowship\n\nSince 2012, the Taiwan Ministry of Education (MOE) and Washington University have jointly supported more than 50 doctoral students in the Taiwan MOE-WashU Scholarship program in a range of areas such as biomedical sciences, engineering and applied sciences, and various social sciences.\n\nAlumni of the program include scientists, educators, professionals, and historians who are making an impact in their workplaces and in communities near and far. The program structure provided by the McDonnell International Scholars Academy has played a critical role in this collaboration."
