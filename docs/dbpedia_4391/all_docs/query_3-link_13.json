        "text": "The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen – an institution run in partnership by Shenzhen University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong – has continued to expand since its appearance in last year’s Risk.net Quant Guide. Its Master of Science in Financial Engineering has seen growth in its student intake, hired more teaching staff, and improved employment outcomes for its graduates. The programme remains led by Nan Chen, a professor in the university’s department of systems engineering and engineering management.\n\nWhile the course received slightly fewer applications for its latest outing than last year – going from 1,139 applications to 992 – it accepted a larger number of full-time students, with 109 in the latest intake. The master’s is a popular choice among those who do receive offers, with an offer-holder acceptance rate of 65% for this year. As student numbers have risen, the programme has made teaching hires in tandem, with 27 instructors now on the course, versus last year’s 23. Four of the staff have industry affiliations, up from three in the most recent guide.\n\nThe programme’s employment rate has also risen, as have average graduate starting salaries. The university reported a mean starting compensation of 165,000 yuan last year, roughly US$26,000. For this year, the figure has leapt to around US$37,786.\n\nLike last year, the master’s requires students to complete sets of compulsory and elective modules. Quant hopefuls can tackle modules focusing on blockchain and machine learning, quantitative risk management, term structure models and fixed income securities. Elective modules include courses in financial data analysis, credit risk modelling and algorithmic trading.\n\nView this institution’s entry in the 2021 guide"
