Together we’re securing partnerships with the next generation of world-leading research institutions with joint collaborations providing access to data, governmental funds and support for joint research centres.\n\nKey exchange and research partners include:\n\nBeijing Normal University\n\nEast China Normal University\n\nFudan University\n\nNanjing University\n\nZhong Shan (Sun-Yat Sen)\n\nZhejiang University\n\nTsinghua University\n\nBut we're not solely focused on research. We're also broadening student mobility with our global centres. One of our largest global centres is in Shanghai and has been operating for ten years. Around China, our extensive alumni network provides active partners for business and education, and on campus we have more than 5,600 Chinese students bringing their culture and knowledge to Manchester.\n\nOur China and Confucius Institutes\n\nThe University is home to the Manchester China Institute, which promotes academic research on China on campus, and a Confucius Institute, which focuses on teaching Chinese and culture promotion in the broader Manchester community. The University is also looking forward to the 2022 opening of a new Lee Kai Hung Chinese Culture Gallery at the Manchester Museum. In the video below, Peter Gries discusses the initial launch of the Manchester China Institute.\n\nResearch partners\n\nOur people\n\nA Manchester education in China"
