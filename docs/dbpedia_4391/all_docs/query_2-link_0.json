        "text": "Established with a generous donation from the Shaw Foundation (Hong Kong) Limited, Shaw College is the first college of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Since its founding in 2016, Shaw College has strived to build a âcommunity of scholarsâ dedicated to intellectual inquiry, integrity and social responsibility.Â Students and teachers from different background live and learn together, sharing the joys of knowledge discovery with each other. Through communal experiences, the College provides an open platform for the whole-person care and education of our students, helping them hone their abilities, broaden their horizons and cultivate their values, so they may succeed in their chosen career paths, and contribute to the betterment of the community, the nation and the world.\n\nIn recognition of the generous donation of Genzon Public Welfare and Charity Foundation (henceforth Genzon Foundation), and its continued contribution to the Universityâs further development, the University named the second CollegeââDiligentia Collegeâ. Diligentia College aims to cultivate students' sense of belonging, ownership, innovation and enterprising spirit, multi-perspective thinking and social responsibility, and promote the well-rounded development and comprehensive quality of students.\n\nThe University established and named its third college as Muse College in 2016, in recognition of the contribution of Horoy Holdings Limited, Mr. Lai Hoi Man and his wife Ms. Chan See Ting.

The Collegeâs name âLingâ derives from Dr. Ling Dao Yang, one of the founders of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, a pioneer of modern forestry science in China, and an advocate for China's National Tree Planting Day. Mr. Ling Guoqiang, the Chairman of Shenzhen Baihe Holdings Group and a descendant of Dr. Ling Dao Yang, generously donated to the University to carry on the tradition of the college system at CUHK, Shenzhen.

Minerva College will uphold the principle of âKindness, Inclusiveness, Dedication and Creativityâ. With the donorâs enthusiasm for inheriting cultural heritage and the pioneering spirit of entrepreneurs, Minerva College will guide students to embrace an open attitude to encourage innovation. Students will be cultivated to become compassionate and responsible individuals with the ability to cope with the challenges in the ever-changing society through various experiential learning activities and diversified student development programmes.\n\nSeventh College is the first graduate college of CUHKSZ.
