        "text": "Tencent’s profit grew to US$6.6 billion in the second quarter while revenue rose 8 per cent to US$22.5 billion.\n\nLandmark decision rejects firm’s assertion that complying with bloc’s regulation put it on collision course with mainland criminal laws.\n\nDBS Bank has pledged up to S$1 billion over the next 10 years to support underprivileged and vulnerable communities across the region.\n\nBeijing may have realised it had been a ‘bit insensitive’ after Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka revisited police deal, analyst says.\n\nBut approvals over same period stood at 80, according to official data of two countries.\n\nThrough the application of several technologies, Shanghai plans to convert a portion of its land into unmanned farming areas – a move it says will increase efficiency and aid in China’s food security campaign.\n\nThe Liberal Democratic Party will hold a leadership contest next month, with the winner to become prime minister.\n\nElectric vehicles are fast replacing conventional cars in Hong Kong. While EV buyers are generally happy with owning and driving them, they have a few pet peeves.\n\nThe programme meant to fill labour shortages has come under fire for suppressing wages and leaving workers vulnerable to abuse.\n\nThe call by Japan’s travel industry comes after a 7.1 earthquake off Kyushu triggered fears of a far larger quake in the Nankai Trough.\n\nWith anticipation already building as the Olympics move Stateside in four years’ time, we take a look at which stars to keep an eye on."
