        "text": "AC/DC: How to Hear New Song ‘Shot In The Dark’\n\nAC/DC is ramping up for a big reveal of their new song “Shot In The Dark.”\n\nThe band announced today their new single will finally come out on Wednesday, October 7 at midnight ET/5 AM BST (London)/3 PM AEDT (Sydney.) AC/DC has been teasing the track via social media since last week.\n\nIn addition to the band’s social media teases, “Shot In the Dark” can also be heard in a new ad from Dodge, which throws back to the 2006 comedy Talladega Nights and even featured Gary Cole reprising his role of Ricky Bobby’s father, Reese Bobby.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Bcsxq4fJnfc\n\nAC/DC finally confirmed last week singer Brian Johnson and drummer Phil Rudd are back in the band along with retired bassist Cliff Williams.\n\nRumors surrounding their status in AC/DC have been swirling for literal years now dating back to August 2018 when photos surfaced of band members outside on the patio area of Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, the same studio where the band recorded their past three studio albums.\n\nRock’s Greatest Live Albums: Top 40 Ranked\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014. The coolest event she's ever covered in person was the 2021 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. (Sir Paul McCartney inducting Foo Fighters? C'mon now!) She's also well-versed in etiquette and extraordinarily nice. #TransRightsAreHumanRights\n\nSign me up for the My Q105 Insider email newsletter!\n\nGet the latest local news, contests, presale information, and so much more from your favorite 80's artists.
