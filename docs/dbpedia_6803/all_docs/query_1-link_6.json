        "text": "About: Daltrey\n\nI used to really like this album when I was in my 20s and early 30s (must be an \"age\" thing). It was different. As Roger has described it:\n\n\"I put together a bunch of ballads as I didn't want to compete with The Who.\"\n\nApparently the album made Kit Lambert nervous as he told Roger it was \"crap\" because he didn't want any success of the album getting to his head and for him to \"leave the band\"... (That didn't go over well with Roger!)\n\nThe album (like any other) has some really good songs and some \"weaker\" songs. One of the problems with any Roger album is that without Pete Townshend's song writing, you have a great vocal performance, but not the kind of \"strong\" material that Who fans have come to expect.\n\nMy favorite songs on the album are:\n\n* One Man Band\n\n* Thinking\n\n* It's A Hard Life\n\n* Giving It All Away (which Roger performed live in 1985 on his first solo tour)\n\nBack in 1983, I had collected every officially released version of every Who/Who solo song, except...\n\n\"There Is Love\" - the \"b\" side to \"Thinking\"...\n\nHowever, \"Thinking\" was a tough one (at the time). Plenty of USA promos (double A side), but no stock copies anywhere to be found. This was before the Internet and you actually had to pick up the phone and call people.\n\nAfter calling what seemed like every record store in the USA, I came across a store called Val Shivley's Records in Upper Darby, PA (outside of Philadelphia). He only carried 45s. After a moment of putting me on hold - he had a copy! How much? THREE DOLLARS???? That was it?\n\nI asked him for directions and when he heard I was driving from close to NYC, he said, \"Are you nuts? I will put it in the mail for you. It's a $3 record!\"\n\nNope. I wanted it immediately. After searching for it for months and months, I wanted it now. He gave me directions; I hopped in the car, drove South West and got my record as he shakes his head at me...\n\nI get home, put it on my father's turntable (no stereo setup at the time) and listened carefully to it...\n\nIt's a GOSPEL SONG!\n\nWow! That was different. It wasn't a bad gospel song, but rather a good one! I really liked the song too! :)\n\nPatience sometimes pays off (other times it doesn't).\n\nThe Polydor CD is better than the Repertoire or Castle CDs (too much compression), but even the Polydor is \"thin\" sounding compared to the best pressing (the Japan LP). This is another good candidate to be remastered...\n\nAbout: Ride A Rock Horse (& Bonus Tracks)\n\nAnd what???\n\nI played my LP to CDr copy. Way back in the day before all/most of our albums were issued on CD, I would take my \"best sounding\" vinyl of an unreleased album (on CD) and copy it to CD so I would have a \"play\" copy. Initially CDrs were only 74 minutes (later extended to 80 minutes) and the blanks were about $2 each. Regardless of the cost, many of these \"older\" albums were between 9-12 songs and didn't run very long (by today's standards), so I'd like to fill each disc up with \"bonus tracks\"... Hence a bit of an extended review - with some songs that perhaps you are unfamiliar with...\n\nI original bought \"Ride A Rock Horse\" (along with \"Daltrey\" and \"One Of The Boys\") at a shopping mall in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. I'm not sure if I spent more time hunting down records or studying for my MBA - but it sure seems like I spent more time with the records, doesn't it?\n\nDuring my time in South East Florida (1982/83), I tracked down every record store known to man. It was \"an adventure\"...\n\n\"Ride A Rock Horse\" is one of my 2 favorite Roger Daltrey solo albums (the other being Parting Should Be Painless). While each of his albums has from a few to many great songs, this one is very consistent, as if it were thoughtfully pieced together vs. \"a collection of songs\".\n\nI like the music, the song writing and especially Roger's vocal performances - which are outstanding...\n\nI like every song on the album, but if I had to just pick one, it would be...\n\n\"Come And Get Your Love\" (also titled, \"Get Your Love\") - this is a great song written by Russ Ballard (who also wrote \"Free Me\").\n\nInteresting enough... \"Walking The Dog\" (which has a bit of a \"Magic Bus\" flavor to it) was performed by The High Numbers and The Who as part of the Young Vic 1971 rehearsals. I suppose Roger finally wanted to record/release a version of this song...\n\nThis is a great album - and also a great candidate to be remastered on CD. The CD version that was released was done during the time period where \"compression\" was in vogue and I personally find it too harsh to play. The LP version(s) sound really good - but I'd bet a newly remastered CD would sound even better...\n\nNow onto the bonus tracks...\n\nMind you, these weren't added to see what best \"fits\" as opposed to, \"here are some extra tracks I want to listen to, let me see how I can make them fit best at the end of this album\"....\n\n* Treachery - This was a Steve Swindells written track from \"Best Bits\" (which supposedly was written about the death of Anwar Sadat). Perhaps it was, but if I have to think about it too long, it means that I \"don't quite get that\". :) I wasn't a real fan of the song when it came out (a bit slower than I normally like) - but it is a really good song that grows on you over time... This was from another post \"McVicar\" project along with \"Martyrs & Madmen\"... (Which is not on this CD - but is on \"Best Bits\").\n\n* Is There Anybody Out There? - I'm not sure why I stuck this on the CD. I recall breaking up \"Parting Should Be Painless\" and putting its tracks on various \"compilation\" albums I made of Pete and Roger solo material - this might have been a leftover... Good song.\n\n* Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me - This is from \"The Lost Boys\" soundtrack - Roger's cover of the Elton John song. I never saw the movie, so it might \"fit\" well with it, but I probably would have produced this a bit differently. The Who version of \"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\" is incredible - and it shows you what the boys can do when they put some effort into something. This version of the song is a bit slow and dry. A nice rendition, but could be \"snappier\".\n\n* If I Only Had A Heart - Yes, the song from... \"The Wizard Of Oz\" - except that this was from \"The Wizard Of Oz In Concert\". I went to that show (in NY). Roger played the Tin Man. After Jackson Brown's timid and relatively quiet \"Scarecrow\" performance, Roger came out (in the silver outfit and matching hat) swinging his microphone and sang this song as if The Who were playing it -great performance. The audience was blown away and it certainly was the highlight of a very good show!\n\n* The Pig Must Die - Another obscure song - this one is from Mike Batt's, \"The Hunting Of The Snark\" (Roger also did \"The Boys of Summer\" for another Mike Batt album). This is a really cool song and I enjoy it every time I hear it (in this case - it seems that was about 6 years ago!).\n\n* Quicksilver Lightning - This one is from the \"Quicksilver\" Soundtrack. A movie starring Kevin Bacon (who happens to be a huge Who fan). Some of you may remember the MTV video. I really liked this song a lot when it came out in 1986, but I may have had a bit of a burn out on it - as I like it less today. Still a very good song though...\n\n* Unforgettable Opera - I'm not a real fan of \"Rocks In The Head\", but I always loved \"Days Of Light\". Perhaps this was my \"next favorite song - so I stuck it on this CD to listen to...\n\n* Break Out - This is an obscure b side from certain pressings of \"The Pride You Hide\" single. It's an obvious outtake from \"Under A Raging Moon\" and a fairly \"weak\" song. I used to love finding this kinda stuff, but this particular song was never well developed and OK for an occasional listen or to be stuck at the end of an album as a \"bonus track\"..."
