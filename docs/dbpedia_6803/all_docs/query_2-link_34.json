        "text": "Since the dawn of the professional recording business, landing a record deal at a major label has been viewed as the holy grail by many independent artists.\n\nBut not in 2024. It's never been easier to set up your own label, so weâre here to take you through everything there is to know about starting a record label.\n\nHow to start an independent record label\n\nSo you've decided to start an independent record label. Great! Just before we get into things, here's a quick rundown of what a label actually is and what is does.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWhat is a record label?\n\nRecord labels are brands or companies responsible for producing, promoting and ultimately distributing the recordings of their signed or associated acts.Â They can be big or small, major or independent. Check out our tips on how to get signed to a record label for more info.\n\nWhat does a record label do?\n\nWithin a labelâs set-up, various departments specialise in certain areas of the music life-cycle. This usually includes marketing, legal and music distribution departments - all collaborating to maximise record sales (both physical and digital) and enhance the visibility of the labelâs artists.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWhat are the major music labels?\n\nThe Big Three: Warner Music Group (WMG), Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment. Seen by many as the music industry 'bad guys', these three major labels hold the majority share of the record label market.\n\nSecuring a record deal at one of the Big Three used to be seen as the be-all and end-all of musical success, but with the growth of indies - not so much anymore.Â\n\nWithin the majors' umbrellas, you'll find smaller labels. For example, UMG's umbrella includes Island, Capitol and Polydor and Sony's features Columbia, RCA and Epic Records.\n\nThe rest of the market share is made up of independent label owners - like you! With this share increasing year on year, there's now more more opportunities than ever to make money as an independent record label.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nHow to start your own record label\n\nTo start your own record label, you need to be determined, organised and have a good music industry network established.\n\nOn top of this, you'll need to have a good ear for music - signing artists that you truly believe match the label's ethos and who'll help take things to the next level. So without further ado, here are the key steps you need to follow to start running an efficient and independent record label.\n\n1. Carry out market researchÂ\n\nFirst of all, youâll wanna see what other labels are operating in your area and if there are any opportunity gaps in the market.\n\nIf youâre based somewhere that already has a number of renowned rock labels actively signing new artists, then you should consider what other genres are thriving within the scene and look to build your own roster from there.Â\n\nYouâll also need to analyse how other labels are run, the potential costs associated with running things, and what niches you can look to appeal to.Â\n\nThe better your understanding of how other labels are doing things, the better you can run your own.Â Take forward the good, leave behind the bad.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n2. Look for label funding\n\nBeing on top of your finances when setting up a record label is vital. Youâre not only impacting your career, but the careers of all of your artists too.Â\n\nPlan out how much youâre going to need to properly set up your label, hire any staff members and how much it'll cost to effectively promote your artists.Â\n\nLuckily, there's loads of funding available to record labels who need a helping hand getting their music projects off the ground. Our Music Funding Map is full of the latest opportunities around the world that can boost your budget.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nYouâll also be able to set your label up on a budget with Ditto. Our Labels plans provide you with everything youâll need to manage multiple artists and access new revenue sources for your acts - all while staying fully independent.Â\n\nâ\n\n3. Choose a record label name\n\nYour label name isnât always as important as you might think it is. Keep it simple and try out our band name generator for some label name inspiration\n\nOur advice would be to look for available names on social media and check out URL options to make sure youâre not competing for traffic with anyone else.\n\nOnce you've done this, you can start testing your label name with sample logos and merch mock-ups. It'll all start feeling real once you've got your brand on a tote bag.\n\nâ\n\nTip: Check if your label name is available with Namechck, ICANN's Lookup tool and GOV.UK's Company name availability checker.\n\nâ\n\n4. Define your label goals\n\nWith so many things to organise, it's important you stick to your plan and stay on track of your goals.\n\nLock in tangible goals for the year ahead and outline milestones that reflect your values and impact on the industry.\n\nDo you want to hit 10,000 followers on your label's Instagram account, sell out a label event at a local venue, or push one of your artists onto the UK Top 40? Whatever your goals, make sure theyâre achievable and measurable. Thereâs never been any harm in setting optimistic goals, but make sure youâre not left disappointed and deflated if you donât reach them all right away.\n\nâ\n\nTip: Use our Record Label Business Plan Template to keep on track of your goals.\n\nâ\n\n5. Create your record label brand\n\nNow for the fun part. Building your label brand. This is where youâll be able to express your brand vibe through your music, artist merchandise, and online social media presence.\n\nYour brand will visually represent your label so be as creative as you want. Just make sure youâre consistent in your brand messaging and appearance.Â Think of instantly recognisable labels like Dirty Hit and XL Recordings.\n\nIf you need some inspo, check out our list of the best AI artwork tools to get you started.\n\nOnce you've decided on your look, keep track of your label logo, fonts, colour scheme and design elements by organising them in folders.Â Trust us, you'll thank yourself later.\n\n6. Identify your audience\n\nUnderstanding your audience is an essential part of setting up your record label. There are countless labels out there, each with its own unique audience and following so donât be afraid to lean into a particularly niche space.Â\n\nOnce you understand what your audience likes, sign artists that appeal to them and build effective promotion strategies around these artists. Tailor your marketing efforts by defining their preferences, ways in which fans consume music, and learn more about their cultural interests.Â Tools like Soundcharts are really useful to help you understand these insights.\n\nYou can then run Facebook and Instagram ads to target potential label fans more specifically.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n7. Build your label teamÂ\n\nAnother key consideration of setting up a record label is whether or not you want to run things yourself or build a team.Â\n\nDo you already have the skills and network to set things up yourself? Or would it be better to partner up with someone like an existing music manager or promoter to split tasks with?Â\n\nStarting off solo might be rewarding, but can sometimes prove to be too much to balance once your artist roster starts growing.\n\nBringing on board someone with their own music industry connections can definitely help with tasks and create more buzz around your label, but youâll also need to factor in lower payments due to splitting profits.\n\nJust remember, whichever option you choose is entirely up to you and your personal goals for the label.\n\n8. Sign your artists\n\nMost A&R nowadays involves building relationships (both online and in-person) with artists. Keep up to date with whoâs regularly making it onto Spotify playlists and which artists are making noise on social media.\n\nThe cool thing about running an independent label is that you can take your own risks and put faith in the artists that you believe in. Start by signing a couple of artists that you see potential in and work closely with them to build both your label and their careers.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n9. Promote your acts\n\nItâs no secret that online promotion is pivotal to success. Music marketing is bigger than ever and label owners need to know how to effectively promote their artist campaigns online in order to maximise streams and income.Â\n\nâ\n\nLearn more about promoting your music:\n\n- How to promote on Instagram\n\n- How to promote on TikTok\n\n- How to promote on Twitter\n\n- How to promote on YouTube\n\nâ\n\n10. Build an album campaign\n\nNow youâve built your roster and started promoting everyone, you can begin working on your album release strategy.\n\nOutline a realistic timeline with your artists, taking into account recording tasks, release dates and music marketing plan.Â\n\nTiming is crucial with this. Make sure youâre giving yourself enough time to upload music to Spotify and the other streaming platforms.Â\n\nâ\n\nTip: Upload your artistâs music to Ditto at least 3-4 weeks before their release date.\n\nâ\n\nYouâll need to continue promotional efforts post-release too, so make sure to update your artist campaigns with new timelines and media assets.Â\n\n11. Distribute music with Ditto\n\nWhen your artists are ready to share your tracks with the world, you'll need to pick a digital distributor for them. All of this is made simple with a Ditto Labels plan. Youâll not only be able to release unlimited music to every platform, but youâll be able to manage all of your artistâs royalties, arrange the necessary splits, and access record label extras. All from within your account.Â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWith more artists choosing to avoid chasing major record deals, setting up an independent record label has never been as appealing or as straightforward.\n\nYou might not have access to the same levels of cash as the majors, but what you do have is a passionate community of independent artists at your side who can help you and your artists achieve global success and keep hold of your passion and creativity.\n\nâ\n\nâ"
