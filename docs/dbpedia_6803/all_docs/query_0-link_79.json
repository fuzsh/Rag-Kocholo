        "text": "Review: Chris Stamey and The ModRec Orchestra, \"New Songs for the 20th Century\"\n\nChris Stamey has taken many unpredictable paths in a long career, whether as a member of the dB's, a solo artist, a producer, or a sideman. But his latest project might be his most unpredictable yet. New Songs for the 20th Century, credited to Stamey and the ModRec Orchestra and newly released by Omnivore Recordings, is a sprawling double-album love letter to traditional (read: pre-rock and roll) vocal pop with a heavy jazz emphasis. Written, arranged, mixed, and produced by Stamey, these\n\nAn American Trilogy: Morello Reissues Glen Campbell's Three Atlantic Albums on New 2-CD Set\n\nGlen Campbell joined Capitol Records in 1962, remaining with the label through 1981. At Capitol, Campbell released almost 40 albums, picking up six Grammy Awards and scoring such indelible hits as \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix,\" \"Wichita Lineman,\" \"Galveston,\" \"Rhinestone Cowboy,\" \"Country Boy (You Got Your Feet in L.A.),\" and \"Southern Nights.\" Campbell followed up his remarkable two decades at Capitol by signing to Atlantic Records' new country-oriented Atlantic America imprint. Cherry Red's\n\nRelease Round-Up: Week of September 6\n\nWelcome to this week's Release Round-Up! Miles Davis, Rubberband (Warner/Rhino) (Amazon U.S. / Amazon U.K. / Amazon Canada) Rhino has unearthed a lost album recorded by Miles Davis in 1985-1986 prior to his label debut Tutu. The LP has been completed by original co-producers Randy Hall and Zane Giles with Davis' nephew Vince Wilburn, Jr., who played drums on the album sessions. Ledisi and Lalah Hathaway have been enlisted to complete the vocal tracks. Available on CD, 2-LP vinyl,\n\nTwist My Wrist! Cherry Red Releases Career-Spanning Anthology from Early U.K. Rock and Roll Star Jess Conrad\n\nBrixton-born entertainer Jess Conrad has been involved in every facet of showbiz over a career spanning seven decades: theatre, film, television, commercials, cabaret, reality shows, and pop music. The latter field is, naturally, the subject of Cherry Red and El's new 2-CD, 63-song anthology Jess for You: The Definitive Collection which packs hits, rarities, and seven never-before-released tracks. Conrad made a big splash in the first wave of rock-and-rollers to come from Great Britain. He\n\nRun Back to Mama: Ace's \"Horn Rock\" Anthology Features Chase, Blood Sweat and Tears, Delaney and Bonnie, More\n\nThe new collection on Ace Records' BGP imprint packs a mighty punch. That's because it's dedicated to Horn Rock (with the equally-important subtitle And Funky Guitar Grooves), that boldest and brassiest of rock subgenres. The phrase \"horn rock\" immediately brings to mind the sound popularized by Chicago and Blood, Sweat & Tears (only one of which is represented here) but the added colors afforded by horns were applied to recordings in the baroque-rock, art-rock, psych-rock, and jazz-rock\n\nTry and Get My Soul Free: Full Sets from Woodstock Festival Emerge on Digital and Streaming Services\n\nFor fans of Woodstock, Friday was a big day. For the physical media-minded, the giant 38-CD/1-Blu-ray box began shipping out, and Craft's standalone Creedence Clearwater Revival Live At Woodstock album was released. Those who may have been unable to purchase the big set have reason to rejoice as several individual acts' sets from Woodstock have begun to pop up on digital download and streaming services. Last week saw the release of Woodstock recordings from Tim Hardin; Melanie; Mountain;\n\nGee, But It's Good to Be Here: Stage Door Releases \"Lost Broadway 1956-57\"\n\nFor the second volume in its Lost Broadway series of 2-CD sets, the U.K.'s Stage Door Records label has turned its attention to the years 1956 and 1957. Musical hits during the 1956-1957 and 1957-1958 seasons included Bells Are Ringing, Li'l Abner, West Side Story, and The Music Man, but Stage Door's attention doesn't lie with those smashes but rather with the largely-forgotten, but certainly worthy, shows that haven't received nearly as much love over the years. Like the first volume (which\n\nSeeds and Stems: Cherry Red Collects Rarities from Iain Matthews on \"Orphans and Outcasts\"\n\nFew artists of the rock generation can boast as diverse a C.V. as Iain (sometimes Ian) Matthews. The Fairport Convention founder went on to front Matthews' Southern Comfort and Plainsong as well as record under his own name in the pop, folk, country, and rock idioms, often blending those styles together. In his first decade alone, Matthews recorded for the Deram, Polydor, Island, Uni, Vertigo, Elektra, and CBS/Columbia labels - and at virtually every label, material was left behind. Between\n\nTrouble No More: Allman Brothers Band Classics Reissued in Color Vinyl Variants\n\nIn celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the pioneering band's founding, five of The Allman Brothers Band's most beloved albums will be reissued on vinyl in special color variants. The albums will be released on July 19 through UMC/Mercury. The first album receiving the color vinyl treatment is The Allman Brothers Band, the group's debut that was originally released in November 1969. With such fan favorites as \"Dreams\" and \"Whipping Post,\" the album introduced audiences to their unique\n\nWilde Thing: Marty Wilde's Career Celebrated on Hits and Rarities Anthology \"A Lifetime in Music\"\n\nMarty Wilde, MBE can legitimately be described as a musical legend. One of the first musicians to bring rock-and-roll to the U.K., his career has spanned over 60 years. Cherry Red's RPM imprint has recently celebrated Wilde's legacy with a package that brings together his earliest hits and numerous rarities. A Lifetime in Music: 1957-2019 - Hits, Highlights, and Rarities collects 132 tracks on 4 CDs including 24 previously unreleased cuts. Wilde, born in Blackheath, South London, was\n\nReview: Glen Campbell, \"The Legacy [1961-2017]\"\n\nGlen Campbell's career-spanning box set is modestly titled The Legacy, fitting for the unlikely superstar from Delight, Arkansas. While The Legend might have been equally appropriate, Campbell's legacy is, truly, unlike any other. Throughout an extraordinary seven-decade career encompassing 21 Top 40 Pop hits, 27 Top 10 Country singles, six Top 20 Pop albums, and nine No. 1 Country albums in the United States alone, the artist regularly transcended genre with his honeyed vocals and virtuosic\n\nBeginnings: Rhino Remixes \"Chicago Transit Authority\" For 50th Anniversary\n\nOn April 28, 1969, Chicago Transit Authority arrived in record stores, introducing the group that would become the world's most influential horn-rock band and one of the most successful bands of all time. The seven-man ensemble of Robert Lamm, Peter Cetera, Terry Kath, Danny Seraphine, Lee Loughnane, James Pankow, and Walter Parazaider, along with producer James William Guercio, offered something for everyone in their sprawling, stunning double-LP debut: big, hook-filled pop singles (\"Does\n\nHot 'Lanta: Unreleased Allman Brothers Concerts Collected on \"Fillmore West '71\"\n\nFew bands shaped the sound of what came to be known as southern rock quite like The Allman Brothers Band. As part of the celebrations surrounding their 50th anniversary, Allman Brothers Recording Company and The Orchard have announced a new four-CD collection of unreleased live material called Fillmore West '71, due for release on September 6. Recorded just two months before their legendary New York City live album At Fillmore East, the Fillmore West '71 set collects all the recordings from\n\nPull the String: Cherry Red, SoulMusic Collect James and Bobby Purify's \"Complete Bell Recordings\"\n\nWith \"I'm Your Puppet,\" the duo of James and Bobby Purify gained soul immortality. The 1966 single written by Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham went top ten Pop and top five R&B on the Billboard charts (and No. 1 R&B on Cash Box!), sold an estimated million copies, and still gets airplay today. Now, Cherry Red's SoulMusic Records imprint has brought together all of the Purifys' recordings for the Bell Records label on the 2-CD collection entitled (naturally) I'm Your Puppet: The Complete\n\nRelease Round-Up: Week of June 14\n\nWelcome to this week's Release Round-Up! Johnny Mathis, Killing Me Softly with Her Song/When Will I See You Again (Second Disc Records/Real Gone Music) (Amazon U.S. / Amazon U.K. / Amazon Canada) Second Disc Records and Real Gone Music continue celebrating Johnny Mathis' discography with two albums on one CD. 1973's Killing Me Softly with Her Song and 1975's When Will I See You Again both spotlight Mathis' silky interpretations of the day's greatest hits. Killing Me Softly with Her\n\nListen to the Music: Doobie Brothers Bring \"Live from The Beacon Theatre\" to CD, DVD, BD\n\nAs The Doobie Brothers gear up for their North American summer tour with co-headliners Santana, Rhino is looking back to a recent concert for a new release. In November 2018, the Doobies, led by Tom Johnston, Patrick Simmons, and John McFee, returned to New York City's historic Beacon Theatre for the first time in 25 years to perform two of the band's greatest albums, Toulouse Street and The Captain and Me. Both audio and video of that special performance are now set for release from Rhino on\n\nSo Into You: Atlanta Rhythm Section's Classic Albums Collected on \"The Polydor Years\"\n\nBorn from the ashes of The Candymen and The Classics IV, Atlanta Rhythm Section began as the house band at Buddy Buie, J.R. Cobb, and Bill Lowery's Studio One in Doraville, Georgia. Members had already performed on recordings by Al Kooper, Roy Orbison, B.J. Thomas, and even Liberace by the time they began rising to fame, fanning the southern rock flame. Now, the band's classic output - recorded from 1974 to 1980 - has been remastered and collected in a new box set: The Polydor Years, due this\n\nSwinging Doors: Grateful Dead, Emmylou, Dolly, Dino, More Celebrate \"The Merle Haggard Songbook\"\n\nAlong with Buck Owens - with whom he shared a musical history and a wife - Merle Haggard (1937-2016) defined The Bakersfield Sound of country music: authentic, raw, rooted in honky-tonks. But unlike the Texas-born and Arizona-raised Owens, Haggard was actually born in Bakersfield and raised just across the river from that California town. \"Hag,\" as he preferred to be known, rocketed to superstardom thanks to \"Okie from Muskogee,\" his controversial 1969 song that was either a scathing\n\nIf Loving You Is A Crime: Lee Moses Rarities Collected on \"How Much Longer Must I Wait?\"\n\nThree years ago, Light In the Attic reissued Time and Place, the lone album by soul powerhouse Lee Moses. The self-taught instrumentalist and singer made a name for himself in Atlanta, where he performed with Gladys Knight, among others. Upon its original release, Time and Place didn't make waves financially but in the decades since, it became a cult classic. On May 24, Light In the Attic's Future Days Recordings imprint will continue its celebration of the raw and beautiful soul music of Lee\n\nI've Got A Sure Thing: Craft Presents \"Soul Explosion\" Vinyl Reissue, Plus A Month of Stax Digital Rarities\n\nCraft Recordings has announced the next phase of its campaign to honor one of the great labels of soul - Stax Records. Entitled \"Soul Explosion,\" the campaign began with their Record Store Day releases of Boy Meets Girl: Classic Stax Duets, Stax Does The Beatles and the first-ever mono reissue of Albert King's Born Under A Bad Sign. The next phase begins on May 31 and will see new vinyl and digital reissues of classics from 1969, which proved to be a watershed year for the label, and\n\nDEVELOPING: Rhino Celebrates Woodstock 50th with Massive, Complete 38-CD Box Set (UPDATED WITH ORDER LINKS)\n\nRolling Stone has broken the news this morning that Rhino Records is getting back to the garden in a big (make that BIG) way. Woodstock 50 - Back to the Garden: The Definitive 50th Anniversary Archive, due August 2, will live up to its name as the last word on the legendary festival. This 38CD/1BD set, limited to 1,969 copies, will include every note performed onstage by every act at Yasgur's Farm over those three days of peace and music, save two tracks by Jimi Hendrix (omitted at the request\n\nUPDATED: Different Drummer: Edsel Collects Michael Nesmith's RCA and Pacific Arts Years on New Box Set\n\nAnd the Hits Just Keep On Comin'. Michael Nesmith titled his 1972 RCA album ironically - when it \"bubbled under\" the Billboard 200 at No. 208, it actually bested its predecessor by three slots - but the LP did feature the once and future Monkee's rendition of one major favorite, \"Different Drum.\" The 1965 tune became an enduring hit for the Stone Poneys featuring Linda Ronstadt in 1967, establishing Nesmith outside of The Monkees. Since 1968, he's released 16 studio albums. Recently, 12 of\n\nTrue Grit: Capitol Reissues, Updates \"Glen Campbell: The Legacy\" Box Set For June Release\n\nSince going out of print, Capitol Records' 2003 box set Glen Campbell: The Legacy [1961-2002] has been regularly commanding three-figure sums on the secondhand market. Yesterday, the label delivered some great news to fans of the late superstar. On June 21, Capitol and UMe will issue a new, updated version of the box set in slimmer, digipak packaging, and with a completely new Disc Four bringing the story of Campbell's incredible career to its completion.

Due on June 14 from Columbia, Western Stars marks a return to \"character driven songs and sweeping, cinematic orchestral arrangement[s],\" as Springsteen described it in a statement.
