        "text": "LONDON — Universal Music Group is to merge its historic Island and EMI label divisions as part of a widespread restructuring of the company’s U.K. business that will also see the launch of new Audience and Media Division to support artists and labels.\n\nThe announcement was made on Tuesday (July 9) by David Joseph, chairman and CEO Universal Music U.K. and Ireland, in an internal memo, which has been viewed by Billboard.\n\nThe reorganization of Universal Music’s U.K. operations follows changes the company made to its U.S. teams earlier this year with the formation of Interscope Capitol Labels Group and Republic Corps.\n\nThat structure is now being loosely mirrored in the United Kingdom with the creation of what Joseph called “two new powerhouse frontline label groups” — Island EMI Label Group, headed by Louis Bloom as president, and the newly formed Polydor Label Group, led by Ben Mortimer.\n\nBoth label groups will be home to multiple labels “all with creative autonomy,” said Joseph’s memo. Each department will also contain a team dedicated to supporting artists from the wider UMG family, said the Universal U.K. boss.\n\nIn line with the restructuring, which comes into effect Oct. 1, Universal is shuffling its executive ranks.\n\nEMI Records co-president Jo Charrington has been appointed president of a “reimagined” U.K. arm of Capitol, which will sit within the wider Polydor Label Group, as will 0207 Def Jam, led by president Alec Boateng. (Billboard understands that Boateng’s brother and co-president of 0207 Def Jam Alex Boateng is to remain with Universal and will be given a job within an international division).\n\nEMI Records’ other co-president, Rebecca Allen, will take up the role of president of Universal’s Audience and Media Division (AMD), a newly formed U.K.-based department dedicated to serving artists and labels that will have a global remit.\n\nJoining Allen in the Audience and Media team will be Suzy Walby (media), Kate Wyn Jones (Audience and Digital Strategy) and data and strategic branch The Square insight team, led by Jack Fryer.\n\nIn his internal staff memo, Joseph said the “industry first” AMD team “will revolutionise how we deliver for our artists” and will become Universal U.K.’s largest division.\n\nNot mentioned in the memo is the scale or number of job losses that will result from the changes, although it does state that the consultation period for staff whose roles are potentially at risk starts today and will continue until mid-September.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it is a legal requirement that companies must follow so-called “collective consultation” rules if it is making 20 or more employees redundant within any 90-day period. Universal U.K. declined to comment on staff redundancies.\n\nNot impacted by the changes are Laura Monks and Tom Lewis, who will continue in their current roles of Decca co-presidents, which will remain a stand-alone label. Hannah Neaves remains sole president of Universal Music Recordings.\n\n“As a company, we must continue to be forward-looking, innovative, and bold. Developing artists now requires more creativity and patience than ever before,” said Joseph in his internal memo.\n\nJoseph went on to say that the restructure would “strengthen our labels’ capabilities to deepen artist and fan connections.”\n\n“We are committed to being the number one place for artists, fans and talent,” surmised the U.K. CEO. “I have an incredible appreciation for our team given what we have achieved in the past and what I know we will achieve in the future.”\n\nFounded in 1931, EMI Records is one of the United Kingdom’s best-known and most successful labels with The Beatles, Queen, Pink Floyd, Elton John and Spice Girls just a few of the famous names that have appeared on its roster.\n\nThe label’s recorded music division was acquired by Universal Music Group in 2012 in a $1.9 billion deal, ending EMI’s long held status as one of the world’s leading record companies. The same year saw Sony Corp. acquire EMI Music Publishing for $2.2 billion, while Warner Music Group completed the purchase of EMI-owned Parlophone Label Group in 2013 for $765 million as part of a regulator-forced divestment.\n\nIn 2022, UMG successfully integrated Capitol Records – a frontline UMG label in the U.K. since 2013 – into the wider EMI group, helping cement EMI’s position as one of the top imprints in the United Kingdom. Recent chart successes included No. 1 albums by Lewis Capaldi, Sam Smith, Take That, Metallica, Shania Twain and Taylor Swift. Last year’s launch of EMI North, a new imprint, based in Leeds, saw EMI become the first British major label to have an office outside of London, while Universal recently annouced the re-launch of EMI Records Philippines."
