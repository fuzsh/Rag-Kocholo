        "text": "Garbage have been forced to cancel the rest of their live dates this year - as frontwoman Shirley Manson undergoes surgery for an undisclosed injury.\n\nThe 'Stupid Girl' singer is \"crushed\" to have to pull out of a series of major gigs but must undergo surgery and rehabilitation.\n\nIn a social media statement, the band said: \"It is with great regret that we announce the cancellation of all our remaining dates for the rest of the year due to an injury that [frontwoman] Shirley [Manson] sustained on our recent tour in Europe that will require surgery and \"No one is more crushed about this than I am. You know I would push through if I could\n\n\"This is not a decision that we have taken lightly, and we apologise to our amazing fans and supportive promoters.\n\n\"We look forward to playing for you all again in 2025.\"\n\nIn the caption, Shirley wrote: \"No one is more crushed about this than I am. You know I would push through if I could.\"\n\nThe 57-year-old star previously underwent hip replacement surgery after suffering another nasty injury on tour in 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, Garbage have a follow-up to 2021 record 'No Gods No Masters' in the pipeline, and Shirley teased in April to NME: “We are in the studio as we speak, actually. It’s supposed to be done by the end of May, and we’re on target. It’s amazing; we are the little engine that could but nobody ever thought would.\n\n“No one ever bet on us. We are the classic underdog in a way. Our public success was a long, long time ago – and since then we’ve operated from an underdog status. It feels like we’re really earned our spot on the team, which brings with it a way to enjoy that I didn’t when I was young.”"
