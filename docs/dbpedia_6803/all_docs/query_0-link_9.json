        "text": "The Who had an interesting time recording their third studio album, 1967’s The Who Sell Out, and Jimi Hendrix had something to do with it.\n\nPete Townshend explained in a new interview with Classic Rock magazine, “I’ve never spoken to Roger about what really happened. Jimi Hendrix was using the studio on the days that we weren’t in there. And at that time Roger’s girlfriend, Heather [Taylor], who became his wife, had been seeing Jimi. I don’t know whether or not this is turning into sort of silly gossip, but I think he [Daltrey] wasn’t around as much as he would normally be. He used to enjoy being in the studio, and suddenly he was gone.”\n\nTownshend continued, “…I was finishing the songs as I was finishing the vocals, imagining that Roger would come in and replace mine. But he just wasn’t there. I think it had something to do with him being concerned about Jimi Hendrix stealing his girlfriend. I think Heather is the redhead he [Hendrix] wrote ‘Foxy Lady’ about, so I think there was some intrigue going on there.”\n\nDaltrey, in the end, got the girl, and he and Taylor would later marry on July 19, 1971.\n\nRock’s Greatest Live Albums: Top 40 Ranked\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
