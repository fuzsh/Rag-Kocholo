        "text": "One of Pete’s strongest songs, it took me over 20 years to recognize it for the masterpiece it is, mainly because of how much it was overplayed on the radio when it first came out. A seemingly simple existential question, with multiple meanings depending upon which word is accentuated, shifts between meanings as the song progresses building to a final climax/chord. Great stuff. I only wish that Keith was young and healthy when playing the drums on it. I think that the Concert For New York has to be the definitive live version. Great energy, and Pete gets some feedback at the ~2 minute mark that just fits perfectly.\n\nGreat track and a great way to end this album.\n\nAs I will be away for a week, I don't want to leave you all bored, and the next project up is The Kids Are Alright. I figure that You guys can discuss this as an album and a video/movie while I am away..... but you are also quite welcome to sit back and wait .... it's completely up to you.\n\nThe Kids Are Alright\n\nSoundtrack album by\n\nThe Who\n\nReleased 8 June 1979\n\nRecorded 1965–1978\n\nGenre Rock\n\nLength 79:35\n\nLabel Polydor\n\nProducer Various\n\nThe Kids Are Alright is a soundtrack album by the British rock band The Who, a companion to the band's documentary film of the same name.[5] As a compilation album, it serves as a retrospective look at the band's biggest hits throughout their career to the point it was released. Most of the tracks are live recordings, rather than the original studio versions.\n\nIt was originally released as a double album in June 1979 on Polydor Records in the UK and MCA Records in the US. The performance of \"My Wife\" was from a concert The Who filmed for The Kids Are Alright at the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn; however the footage was not used in the film. That show was later restored for DVD and released as The Who at Kilburn: 1977 in 2008. \"Tommy Can You Hear Me\" had a longer outro with Roger Daltrey repeating the word \"Tommy\" before Keith Moon screams \"'Ello!\" to end the song. The soundtrack album did well in the US where it peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard albums chart and went platinum, while it peaked at No. 26 on the UK charts.\n\nThe Who\n\nRoger Daltrey – vocals, harmonica\n\nPete Townshend – guitars, keyboards, vocals\n\nJohn Entwistle – bass guitar, keyboards, vocals, musical director\n\nKeith Moon – drums, vocals\n\nDesign\n\nBill Curbishley – sleeve concept\n\nChris Chappel – sleeve concept\n\nRichard Evans – sleeve concept, design, illustration\n\nArt Kane – photography\n\nRoy Carr – liner notes\n\n1. \"My Generation\" The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, 15 September 1967 4:32\n\n2. \"I Can't Explain\" Twickenham Film Studios, 3 August 1965 2:01\n\n3. \"Happy Jack (not used in the film)\" University of Leeds Refectory, 14 February 1970 2:13\n\n4. \"I Can See for Miles (not used in the film)\" credited as from The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, 15 September 1967, actually a new stereo remix of the standard studio version[citation needed] 4:19\n\n5. \"Magic Bus\" Beat-Club, 12 October 1968 3:23\n\n6. \"Long Live Rock\" Olympic Studios, Barnes, London, 5 June 1972 3:58\n\n7. \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\" (Townshend, Roger Daltrey) Ready Steady Go!, 1 July 1965 2:50\n\n8. \"Young Man Blues\" (Mose Allison) Coliseum, London, 14 December 1969 5:46\n\n9. \"My Wife (not used in the film)\" (John Entwistle) Gaumont State Theatre, Kilburn, London, 15 December 1977 6:07\n\n10. \"Baba O'Riley\" Shepperton Film Studios, London, 25 May 1978 5:29\n\n11. \"A Quick One, While He's Away\" The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus film, recorded on 11 December 1968 7:32\n\n12. \"Tommy Can You Hear Me?\" Beat-Club, 27 September 1969 1:47\n\n13. \"Sparks\" Woodstock festival, New York, 17 August 1969 3:01\n\n14. \"Pinball Wizard\" Woodstock festival, New York, 17 August 1969 2:48\n\n15. \"See Me, Feel Me\" Woodstock festival, New York 17 August 1969 5:27\n\n16. \"Join Together/Road Runner/My Generation Blues (Medley)\" (Townshend/McDaniel) Pontiac Silverdome, Pontiac, Michigan on 6 December 1975 cut from early CD pressings 9:55\n\n17. \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" Shepperton Film Studios, London, 25 May 1978 9:58\n\nThe Who ‎– The Kids Are Alright\n\nLabel:\n\nUniversal Music DVD Video ‎– 2732096\n\nFormat:\n\nBlu-ray, Remastered, Multichannel\n\nCountry:\n\nAustralia\n\nReleased:\n\n2010\n\nGenre:\n\nRock, Non-Music\n\nStyle:\n\nInterview, Mod, Psychedelic Rock, Hard Rock\n\n1 My Generation\n\n2 I Can't Explain\n\n3 Russell Harty #1\n\n4 Baba O'Riley\n\n5 Shout And Shimmy\n\n6 Russell Harty #2\n\n7 Young Man Blues\n\n8 Melvin Bragg #1\n\n9 Drum Kit Mayhem Keith MoonOther [Shot By] – Jon Rubin\n\n10 The Keith Ringo Knows?\n\n11 Tommy, Can You Hear Me?\n\n12 Ringo And Keith: On Roger\n\n13 Pinball Wizard\n\n14 Ummm....Jah\n\n15 See Me, Feel Me\n\n16 Melvin Bragg #2\n\n17 My Generation (Conclusion)\n\n18 Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\n\n19 Russel Harty #3\n\n20 Success Story\n\n21 Pete: On The Beatles\n\n22a Substitute, Pictures Of Lily, Magic Bus\n\n23 Happy Jack\n\n24 Melvin Bragg #3\n\n25 A Quick One, While He's Away\n\n26 A Circus Act\n\n27 Ringo & Keith: Joining The Who\n\n28 Cobwebs And Strange\n\n29 Russel Harty #4\n\n30 Ringo & Keith: On Pete\n\n31 Pete: On Doing His Job\n\n32 Sparks\n\n33 Barbara Ann\n\n34 Road Runner / My Generation Blues\n\n35 Pete: The Power Of Volume\n\n36 Russel Harty #5\n\n37 Who Are You\n\n38 Russel Harty #6\n\n39 My Generation\n\n40 Final Words\n\n41 Won't Get Fooled Again\n\n42 Long Live Rock (Original End Credits)\n\n43 The Kids Are Alright (Restoration End Credits)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI always liked the bands songs, but I made some poor first album buying choices and it took a while for me to gain too much interest in the band as an album band.\n\nI have never had this album, but I seem to remember seeing this on tv or something back in the day, and it interested me a lot.\n\nWhen this came out on dvd I got it, and it sparked my interest in exploring the band a little more closely, because I absolutely loved this. The guys were full of personality and fun and the music is great.\n\nSo for me, this was where my journey with the Who really began.\n\nI ended up buying the bluray when that came out as well ...\n\nObviously we have some great videos and the interview segments are much more interesting than a lot of bands interview inserts. This was put together really very well as a movie, and I think it captures who the band were extremely well.\n\nThe thing that really sent this over the top for me is the Shepparton Studio footage... I absolutely love that footage, and for the longest time I thought that it was a complete concert, and was somewhat annoyed that the whole concert wasn't available, but in recent years I believe that I found out that it was just a few songs that they shot footage for .... or something along those lines ... I know The Who experts will fill us in on that really quickly and correct or refine what I sadi there.\n\nSo for me this is almost the focal point of my love for the band. With the Shepparton stuff, The Rock and Roll Circus performance, the goofy videos, and the really interesting and funny interviews this captures the Who in a way that many bands often fail to in this kind of project.\n\nSo please, over the next week, please share some videos, and some songs, and your thoughts regarding them ... hopefully it won't be a train wreck, and I will look forward to seeing where we are at when I get back.\n\nCheers\n\nMark"
