        "text": "J. Erving's distribution and artist services company Human Re Sources has signed a new deal with RAYE, 11 months after she parted ways with Polydor Records.\n\nRAYE had revealed her discontent with Polydor on Twitter last summer, revealing that she has \"albums on albums of music sat in folders collecting dust, songs I am now giving away to A list artists because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough to release an album.\"\n\nThe UK-based artist had signed a four-album deal with the label in 2014, and on 19 July 2021, she announced that she was \"an independent artist\", and that her and Polydor had \"agreed to part ways.\"\n\nRAYE said of joining Human Re Sources, \"I am beyond excited to be working with Human Re Sources – a company that supports me as an independent artist and encourages raw unfiltered artistry. It has been nothing short of a breath of fresh air working with this team, who have allowed me to execute MY vision entirely. A company governed by art, not soullessly chasing the chart. As a young woman in this wild industry I have never before experienced being able to be in control of my career, my releases, my visuals and my narrative. I am both empowered and supported and I can not wait for this journey we will embark on together, in finally getting to release my debut album, seven years in the making.\"\n\nJ. Erving added, \"We are thrilled to welcome RAYE to the Human Resources family. We are lucky to have landed an artist with such an amazing footprint. We intend to support RAYE’s vision, as an artist, a powerful young woman, and a superstar!\"\n\nEarlier this week, RAYE announced her forthcoming single \"Hard Out Here\", which will arrive 30 June via The Orchard."
