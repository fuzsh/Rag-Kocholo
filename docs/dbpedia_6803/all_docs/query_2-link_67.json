        "text": "Essex based singer and songwriter, Declan J Donovan, first made an appearance into the scene in 2017 with a song titled “Fallen So Young” – independently recorded and released on Soundcloud. Little fact – the song was originally written for his brother’s wedding. The mellow guitar-driven track gathered over a million streams within six months and from that point onwards it has been a journey of growth and maturity in the singer’s writing and overall style.\n\nDeclan’s latest release, “Perfectly Imperfect” (released via Polydor Records) is a true testament to this, touching on the topic of self-worth and inner beauty he displays his powerful yet delicate vocal range.\n\nIn 2018, Donovan had the chance to grace the stage at BBC Music’s Biggest Weekend as an unsigned artist where he appeared alongside Taylor Swift, Sam Smith, Florence + The Machine and more.\n\nDonovan’s voice is instantly noticeable, with lyrics that feel as though he is baring his soul to his listeners and vulnerability that exudes off of every track.\n\nWe had the chance to chat with Declan J Donovan at the Polydor 2021 artist showcase to see what his plans are for the near future and more.\n\nHow much of your writing is autobiographical, and how much is derived from dreams and the lives of others?\n\nI’d say that it’s very 50/50. I get so inspired by lots of things! Whether it’s a story from a friend or an amazing film I’ve watched, but lately I’ve been writing much more about my own life.\n\nHow do you want people to feel when they listen to your music?\n\nI want them to feel whatever they want to feel really! I love the nostalgic aspect of music so I’d probably say that.\n\nIf you could summarise it, what would be the story of how you became a musician?\n\nI wrote a song for my brothers wedding back in 2014, and then released it on sound cloud a few months later. And it completely kickstarted my career out of nowhere after the song went viral!\n\nWhich artists have been the most instrumental in influencing your sound?\n\nBon iver and Matt Corby are two artists I’ve always looked up to and I’d say that had the biggest impact on me when I was starting out making music.\n\nWhat are you hoping to achieve in the next few years?\n\nMainly to just Be happy! And hopefully have an album out. I don’t like to put too much pressure on myself and just trust the process.\n\nWhat would be your dream collab?\n\nMy dream collab songwriting wise would be Ryan Tedder, he’s been my favourite writer for years.\n\nWhat is something you’d like people to know about you?\n\nIve got double jointed thumbs so they’re crazy bendy\n\nAs a musician, how has artistic expression helped you through tough times?\n\nI think just having the freedom to make whatever music I wanna make and that helps me be as honest as possible in my music\n\nWhere do you love to write the most? Is there anywhere in particular you feel most inspired or creative?\n\nWriting in Devon in the countryside with my close mates is definitely the place I feel most inspired! But different from the outside of my house in Essex haha.\n\nWhat can we expect next from you?\n\nMore music! I’m writing all the time and hopefully a few collabs coming soon."
