        "text": "A former mechanic is heading for the big time after signing a record deal with one of the UK’s biggest labels.\n\nShortly before Christmas, the 27-year-old rapper, known as EV, from Haughley, near Bury St Edmunds, was working as a lorry mechanic.\n\nHe’d been recording songs in his bedroom and releasing them online since 2018.\n\nBut after two songs went viral at the end of last year, the offers came rolling in.\n\nNine record labels called before he received a life-changing offer from record bosses at London-based Polydor.\n\nThe legendary label boasts chart-topping stars such as Lady Gaga, Lana Del Rey, Ellie Goulding, Billie Eilish, and even Abba.\n\n“It’s just crazy,” said EV, a former Thurston Community College student.\n\n“Music has been a lifelong hobby and you get to the point where you think: is anything going to happen?\n\n“I was enjoying it so it didn’t really matter, but I still can’t believe how things have taken off.”\n\nThe record company advanced EV, whose real name is Evan, enough money to pursue a music career full-time for the ‘foreseeable future’.\n\nHe now travels to London several times a week to recording studios and for meetings.\n\nHe describes his music as ‘dancey lad rap’ - a cross between 1990s rave and MC inspired lyrics. The two tracks, called Sirens and Come Down, which went viral, clocked up nine million hits between them.\n\nIn early January, a track called Friday Nights, was chosen by BBC Introducing and played on Radio 1 shows, twice a day, for week.\n\nEV said: “I’ve always made music but nailed my sound in the last year or so.\n\n“I was putting the songs together in my bedroom, working every single hour I got free, on a laptop, when I wasn’t at work.\n\n“For the lyrics, I just tell stories from my life, my friends’ life, observing things that I see around me: night life, love stories.\n\n“I’m now working on EPs and albums and seeing how my first year as a full-time musician goes.”\n\nEV’s friends help keep him grounded.\n\n“It’s a dream, really. You go to London, you rub shoulders with all these people and think: wow, what is life sometimes.\n\n“But then you come home, go to the pub with the boys and talk it all over and there’s nothing better.\n\n“They all keep it real and me, very grounded.”"
