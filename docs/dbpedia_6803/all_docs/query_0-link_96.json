        "text": "Don’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 188\n\nWed. Aug 7, 2013\n\n“I Remember California”\n\nR.E.M.\n\n1988\n\n“♫ I\n\nRemember\n\nthis ♫”\n\nWhile I was bedridden this past weekend, I had this deep R.E.M. album cut from 1988’s Green, playing in my worried mind. “I Remember California” was linked to a dream I had about this road trip we took in the late eighties. I don’t really know why? I hadn’t thought about this summer vacation our familia took from Texas to California, it’s been ages since I listened to Green. But, I’m not alone, even bassist Mike Mills admitted to David Buckley, in his book R.E.M. Fiction: An Alternative Biography, “I think Green is haphazard, a bit scattershot, but that’s because we were experimenting with things […] but then again I haven’t listened to Green in years. But I recall liking it very much.”\n\nWhat “I Remember California” made me recall was how the music on the radio soothed my worried mind and body. I’m notorious for getting sick on vacations and I have vivid memories of singing aloud in front of my family and seeing a new world of California through these young, naïve eyes. I would love to have told you that this road trip we took as a familia was catalyst for me moving to Los Angeles many years later, alas, it wasn’t.\n\nAlthough, Stipe’s lyrics foreshadow the listing colorful curling poetic lines of R.E.M.’s future Reveal song, “She Just Wants To Be;” “I Remember” is not about a place where people go to be famous; there’s seems to be a sort of escapism to California that R.E.M.’s lyricist was trying to find as Michael explained in Craig Rosen’s R.E.M. Inside Out: Stories Behind Every Song, “I have this theory that people in California, they’re the people that just went and went until they couldn’t go any further unless they fell into the ocean. So they set up a lemming camp and it became Los Angeles. And there you are.”\n\nStipe was not only talking about the founders of this Golden State but my experience how I made it to California. After listening to “I Remember” from the 25th Anniversary edition of Green, I realize that I was one of those lost souls who stopped running from my fears and happened to end up in the west coast. I know now I was meant to take this road to L.A. and “I Remember California” is a reminder of the boy I used to be. Sometimes I look in the mirror and behind those gray hairs I feel a sense of that kid who was singing to the radio in our family’s car, who just wanted to find some solace in his songs. Thank you R.E.M. for taking me back there, before I found my home within the vivid lyrical tapestry that is “I Remember California.”\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 187\n\nTues. Aug 6, 2013\n\n“What is Life”\n\nGeorge Harrison\n\n1971\n\n“♫ I’ll\n\ntry my\n\nbest to\n\nmake\n\neverything\n\nsucceed ♫”\n\nAfter hearing George Harrison’s glorious signature guitar riff like beacon, “What is Life” begins with a wave of musical euphoria. Coming off the cusp of his worldwide smash single “My Sweet Lord,” this once Quiet Beatle showed his lyrical hit making prowess when he followed up his most successful song with this electrifying pop treasure.\n\nEvery time I spin “What is Life,” I hear not a disgruntled always overshadowed ex-Beatle but a singer reborn in the guise of a British flavored Motown song. The Beatles were one of the first UK acts to shine their love of Motown. George was one of the biggest Motown fans, although he forever saved his love and admiration for Smokey Robinson, “What Is Life” sounds like the perfect tribute to Detroit with more of a ‘Temptations’ like glimmer, this glorious song remains one of the true pinnacles of Harrison’s first solo album, 1971’s All Things Must Pass.\n\n“What is Life” showed that this once quiet Beatle would be silent no longer. A symphony of hope in the guise of a pop song, this 1971 George Harrison single awakened me today with a much needed sense of life. Maybe because it was released in the shadow of George’s biggest song ever, “My Sweet Lord,” “What is Life” reflects this joyful breath of life in the midst of this Motown inspired gem, making this 1971 single, one of the most underrated of all Harrison’s hit anthems.\n\nAfter this weekend of illness, I want to dedicate “What is Life” to my wife. The best decision I ever made was marrying her. In fact, my advice is listening to “What is Life” with the one you truly love and sing along with the joy you feel inside. It’s contagious, all you have to do is sing along… It makes you wonder “What is Life” without George Harrison’s music? I can’t imagine a world without Harrison’s inspiring brand of uplifting anthems like “What is Life.”\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 186\n\nSat. Aug 3, 2013\n\n“Why Not Smile”\n\nR.E.M.\n\n1999\n\n“♫ You’ve\n\nbeen sad\n\nfor a\n\nwhile ♫”\n\nI was awakened by the sounds of this uplifting sounding song ironically enough from R.E.M.’s most infamous album, from 1999, Up. I actually believed that Stipe had crafted one of the simplest moving acoustic anthems in the R.E.M. canon but apparently there’s a dispute between guitarist Peter Buck and lyricist Stipe on the meaning of “Why Not Smile.”\n\nIn Craig Rosen’s R.E.M.: Inside Out: The Stories Behind Every Song, Michael Stipe explained the disagreement he and guitarist have had about “Why Not Smile” when he said, “Peter and I have argued about this, because he think it’s a really sweet, loving song about pulling someone put of a really dark place. To me, it was someone who was taking a very easy route and not recognizing depression and not realizing that someone might have a chemical imbalance that makes them impossible to reach on that level. To just say, ‘Why Not Smile,’ to people who might be slightly depressed, but that’s not quite enough. You kind of gave to tackle a little more than, ‘Come on, pull yourself up by the bootstraps and let’s get on with our day.’ That doesn’t work with people who are chronically depressed or who have genetic or chemical imbalances whether it’s a bipolar disorder, chronic depression or whatever. I felt like it was a very naïve brushing off of a very serious condition. Peter thinks the opposite. He thinks it’s a very sweet and beautiful song. There’s two ways to look at it.”\n\nSo who do you think is right? Do you believe Michael’s interpretation or Peter Buck’s version of “Why Not Smile?”\n\nI really want to know what you think. Let’s hear it?\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 185\n\nFri. Aug 2, 2013\n\n“The House of the Rising Sun”\n\nNina Simone\n\n1962\n\n“♫ There\n\nis a house\n\nin New\n\nOrleans ♫”\n\nSo many different versions of this traditional classic that is “House of The Rising Sun,” even though I prefer Nina Simone’s version, I’d be a fool if I didn’t mention Eric Burden and who’s band The Animals’ first recording put this New Orleans inspired in our social consciousness of song. Burdon actually admitted meeting Simone who gave Eric the best advice as he explained, “When I met Nina Simone she took a look at one of my journals and she told me, “You are a music historian.” Nina was the one to inspire me to continue in that vein, a trait that I have carried on to this day.”\n\nSimone herself was a one of a kind musical historian, and I like to believe because of this Nina and Eric Burdon were kindred spirits. You can feel it in her 1962 rendition recorded at The Village Gate. It’s as if we’re right there in that vintage room, you can little hear glasses clinking and jazz fans chattering, such an intricate performance as Nina croons, close your eyes and it’s like you’re actually there watching Simone seductively being her own eternal interpretation of “House of the Rising Sun” to life in 1962.\n\nNina’s historical performance at The Village Gate captures the essence of Simone giving her own soulful spin on this traditional classic. I love the interplay between the guitarist and Nina Simone; it’s as if there musical flirtation gives “House of the Rising Sun” another level of intimacy missing from most interpretations of this extraordinary song.\n\nSo if you’re looking for a version of “House of the Rising Sun” to spin at a party for two, get out the candles and softly turn on the sound of this chanteuse at The Village Gate, circa 1962, gave this New Orleans traditional a much needed soulful reincarnation from the immortal vocal of Nina Simone.\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 183\n\nWed. July 31, 2013\n\n“About A Girl”\n\nNirvana\n\n1989\n\n“♫ I’m\n\nstanding\n\nin your\n\nline ♫”\n\nI couldn’t believe my eyes as the girl behind the counter was actually wearing a Nirvana shirt. It’s a rarity these days, especially to see music fans under thirty sporting tees that honor Kurt and Nirvana. “Cool shirt” is what I told her. At least this fan was keeping the spirit of Cobain alive. Immediately I thought of Kurt’s song “About A Girl.” From 1989’s Bleach, Cobain’s ditty with pop overtones had obvious Beatlesque influences. Kurt talked about Bleach’s most famous love song when Cobain said, “Even to put “About a Girl” on Bleach was a risk. I was heavily into pop, I really liked R.E.M, and I was into all kinds of old ‘60s stuff. But there was a lot of pressure within that social scene, the underground — like the kind of thing you get in high school. And to put a jangly R.E.M. type of pop song on a grunge record, in that scene, was risky.”\n\nSome critics argue that “About A Girl” foreshadowed the glossy production on 1991’s Nevermind. Although, Kurt regretted the traditional produced sound from Nirvana’s most successful album, Cobain revisited his love for “About A Girl” in the band’s very critically acclaimed performances, Nirvana’s 1993 appearance on M-TV Unplugged in New York.\n\nYou can hear the teenage angst through Cobain’s acoustic wails on the Unplugged version of “About A Girl.” One of the few early Nirvana tracks that the band stripped down for this historic performance proving Charles R. Cross’s theory about Kurt’s Bleach love song when he wrote in book Heavier Than Heaven: A biography of Kurt Cobain, ““About A Girl” was an important song in Kurt’s development as a writer—it was his first straight ahead love song, and if the lyrics are twisted, it was so unabashedly melodic that in Nirvana’s early live performances, audiences mistook it as a Beatles cover.”\n\nNow you realize why the living members of Nirvana Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear decided to reunite and perform with former Fab Four bassist Paul McCartney, Kurt’s songwriting was so unique that Nirvana followers thought even back then circa 1989, Cobain was already being influenced by the greatness of The Beatles. Although, John Lennon was Kurt’s favorite Beatles, even Cobain would appreciate the fact that Macca played with his former mates.\n\nEven from their days of Bleach, “About A Girl” proves that Nirvana is more than just poster children for the generation grunge. “Smells Like Teen Spirit” may have immortalized the barbaric yawp of Cobain but Kurt his first official love song, “About A Girl” was more than just howls and rock riffs. Even Nirvana’s acoustic performance showed that this Aberdeen, Washington band could pen on their best most memorable pop songs in the name of love. For the cashier behind the counter sporting her Nirvana t-shirt, keeping the legacy of Kurt Cobain alive, “About A Girl” is for you.\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 182\n\nTues. July 30, 2013\n\n“Cold Turkey”\n\nJohn Lennon\n\n1969\n\n“♫ My\n\nbody is\n\naching\n\ngoose-\n\npimple\n\nbone ♫”\n\nI just can’t see it, can you imagine, in 1969 John Lennon, fresh off his creative partnership with Yoko Ono, lobbied for “Cold Turkey” to be the next Beatles single and for inclusion on Abbey Road? According to Paul Du Noyer’s John Lennon: The Stories Behind Every Song: 1970-1980, Paul, George and Ringo rejected John’s suggestions which forced Lennon to release “Cold Turkey” as a solo single under the moniker Plastic Ono Band.\n\nWould “Cold Turkey” have fit brilliantly at the end of Abbey Road’s Side One, after Lennon’s one epic “I Want You (She’s So Heavy)?” Just the thought of Lennon’s one…two punches of “Heavy” and “Cold Turkey” closing the first side of The Beatles’ swan song would have been simply legendary. It has been well documented that Lennon was never a fan of Paul’s ‘Brian Wilson and Sgt. Pepper’s inspired’ medley on the Side Two of Abbey Road. To appease John, The Beatles decided to have the first side reflect Lennon’s wishes to have an album of unrelated songs. If John had truly got his way, “Cold Turkey” would have definitely replaced “Revolution 9” in becoming the most controversial song in the Beatles catalog.\n\nIf “Cold Turkey” was released by The Beatles, it would have been remembered for being the second Fab Four song to feature Eric Clapton on guitar, the other song being “While My Guitar Gently Weeps.” Speaking of weeping, because of his addictive primal scream like guitar riffs, Slow hand is the star of “Cold Turkey.” Eric Clapton’s heavy guitar licks match Lennon’s desperation vocal howls bringing the harrow experience of drug withdrawal to life on vinyl.\n\nBesides “Revolution 9,” “Cold Turkey” is probably one of the most difficult John Lennon songs to get through. What I love about John Lennon is that he wasn’t afraid to show the true shadow of his existence. Good, bad, in love, angry—we heard the different sides of Lennon from songs like “Cold Turkey.” Maybe it was the best thing that The Beatles rejected “Cold Turkey” as a single and from inclusion of Abbey Road. Regardless, the life of this Plastic Ono Band cut reflects the true effects of drug addiction. Be careful, John’s song is definitely not for the squeamish. And, beware… one taste of Lennon’s “Cold Turkey” and you might just be hooked.\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 180\n\nSun. July 28, 2013\n\n“Never”\n\nElectrafixion\n\n1995\n\n“♫ And\n\nso am I/\n\nthe truth\n\njust goes ♫”\n\nAfter Nirvana broke through in 1991, what impressed me most what wasn’t what the kids were saying about this Aberdeen, Washington band but the iconic rock heroes like Neil Young, David Bowie, Tom Petty were all raving about the cultural importance about Nirvana. Did you know that Echo and the Bunnymen’s vocalist Ian McCulloch, was not only a fan but McCulloch credits Kurt Cobain and Nirvana for sparking his reunion with fellow Bunnymen, guitarist Will Sergeant? In Chris Adams book Turquoise Days: The World of Echo & the Bunnymen, Ian praised Cobain and his band, when he said, “Nirvana were the best out-and-out rock band since…The Velvet Underground. They just stripped it all away, and it wasn’t like the Pistols, with Malcolm McLaren and that very English fake hard-boy thing. Nirvana was just about Kurt and what was going on in his head. They dug a lot deeper than all the current rock & roll ladishness.”\n\nIan appreciated Kurt’s honest aggression, Cobain’s brave guitar laden sound not only got teens picking up the axe but also lead to McCulloch and Sergeant to reunite when they formed Electrafixion. Still not ready to reconvene their old band, Electrafixion was the first step in bringing back Liverpool’s legendary rock band Echo and The Bunnymen. First Ian and especially Will Sergeant used Nirvana inspiration’s to craft some dynamic rock riffs, none more explosive than Burned’s “Never.” “Never” has Sergeant’s fiery guitar riffs mixed with a Stone Roses styled back beat that’s so addictive, it will shock you that former Echo stalwarts Ian and Will came up with such electrified hooks and lyrics. It was as if McCulloch and Sergeant was struck by lightening and went directly to the studio and the result was 1994’s Burned.\n\nYou can hear why a young piercing howl of Kurt Cobain not only shake the record world to the core but moved former Echo and the Bunnymen vocalist Ian McCulloch to unleash some lust filled lyrical vigor on Electrafixion’s Burned. In Adams’ Turquoise Days, McCulloch talked about Kurt’s influence when the singer said, “Kurt Cobain affected me just to listen to and to look at. He looked beautiful, like Jesus. And I just loved that kind of grit, and the way he meant it and you couldn’t argue with him—he wasn’t faking it. ‘Cos there are so many fakes around. He was dead fragile and just had one of the best rock voices ever, dead like Lennon. And his words are great, dead simple things that really suck you in. That, to me, is what bands should be trying to do.”And since nobody else was stepping up to the plate, Ian McCulloch and Will Sergeant took Nirvana’s inspirational grit and formed Electrafixion. Just like their name, “Never” is one of Burned‘s more explosive cuts that show how a 1980’s songwriting duo McCulloch and Sergeant can be influenced by 1994 American grunge band to form one of the most underrated bands of the late 1990s.\n\nAlthough, Electrafixion will be remembered as the short lived nineties act that spawned the reformation of Echo & The Bunnymen mach two; the band’s debut album and specifically “Never” is one of the most original post modern psycho-psychedelic sound that you need to track down 1994’s Burned to believe it. Could Electrafixion lusty rock riffs actually surpass the eloquence of Echo & The Bunnymen? “Never” say never, don’t be afraid to give Electrafixion a try, they might just blow your mind with a volatile Velvet-y rock sound that will leave you a little bit Burned.\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 179\n\nSat. July 27, 2013\n\n“Fiery Flame”\n\nIan McCulloch\n\n2012\n\n“♫ Just\n\nto be my\n\nFiery\n\nFlame ♫”\n\nYou wouldn’t believe it but when you hear Echo and the Bunnymen’s Ian McCulloch beautifully poignant new solo album, his best and most personal since 1989’s Candleland, 2012’s Pro Patria Mori, was written under nefarious circumstances as Mac explained to The Times UK, “The last few years have been a really hard time. My life was collapsing. I was getting bongoed [taking drugs] all the time just to kill the pain. That thing in Glasgow happened because I felt more alone than ever and I took it out on the audience — I was so paranoid that I forgot I was actually on stage. I stopped caring about my appearance. A lot of the people I turned to for help weren’t there for me. For a long time I wanted to close the door and tell everyone to f*** off. I was like Howard Hughes, but without the billions of dollars in the bank.”\n\nAll changed when Ian McCulloch decided to channeling his personal demons inside his new album, Pro Patria Mori. More importantly, instead of coming up with a raw Plastic Ono Band album like John Lennon did in 1970, on this solo record, the Echo and the Bunnymen singer decided to go a more emotionally vibrant sound. For years, Ian has been rewriting the rules of the British pop song as he explained in 1984, “I try to change the rules of the standard ‘great pop song’ into being able to be really emotional. I want to try to reduce the distance between acting and reality as much as possible but still create that great pop-ness.” Thirty years later, McCulloch finally succeeded when he composed the most delightfully addicting pop gem, “Fiery Flame.”\n\nThe ironic thing is that Echo and the Bunnymen attempted to make a post modern pop album with 2009’s The Fountain, specifically with “Life of a Thousand Crimes.” The difference between “Crime” and “Fiery,” is it sounds like Echo was trying to force a pop song with it’s very loud and distracting back beats and “Flame” is effortless, the melody is supple and flawlessly memorable like a lyrical McCulloch kiss in the Liverpool inspired rainy day opus that is Pro Patria Mori.\n\n“Everything seems so much clearer and sharper now,” McCulloch has said and all you have to do is put on Ian’s 2012 solo record, Pro Patria Mori and you will discover a new more poetically seasons sound for the Echo and the Bunnymen singer. Who would’ve believed that in 2012 Ian McCulloch would compose one of his most personal pop gems of his career? This is Mac unleashing his lyrical flame in the sweetest and most poignant way. I urge you to turn on track six and you will hear the “Fiery Flame” aka the golden voice of Ian McCulloch resurrected in the guise of this almost perfect 21st Century anti- pop song.\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 178\n\nFri. July 26, 2013\n\n“Far Away Eyes”\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\n1978\n\n“♫ Find\n\na girl\n\nwith far\n\naway\n\neyes ♫”\n\nDuring my time in New Orleans, I lived a few blocks away from one of my favorite dive bars Igor’s on St. Charles. You could actually sit outside, have one of the best burgers in Louisiana, a beer and watch the street cars go passing by. Since I lived literally around the corner from the bar, while I was there, I would take advantage and do my laundry while having a beer and a burger at Igor’s. That’s right; I would do my laundry at a bar. How many people can say that they did their laundry at a bar? My favorite part of Igor besides the beer, burger and washing machines was the vintage jukebox they had at the bar. There was this one song that this bartender Julie with her thick Southern Louisiana accent would make all of us sing along with her. And Julie’s favorite song was the sixth track from Some Girls, The Rolling Stones’ “Far Away Eyes.”\n\nThere is something magical about The Stones doing country. Birthed by their love of the blues, Mick Jagger loved putting on his metaphorical Stetson hat and squeezing into his cowboy boots like persona as his songwriting partner, guitarist Keith Richards talked about when he said, “Mick feels the need to get into these caricatures. He’s slightly vaudeville in his approach. Far Away Eyes is like that. He did it great every time except for the final take. It’s good when he does it straight ’cause it’s funny enough without doing a pantomime. It’s the SOUND version of what he was doing wrong VISUALLY. When he sings it as a caricature it sounds like it would be great for a show. You expect Mick to walk out in his cowboy duds on an 18-wheeler set (laughs). Or sing it into his CB as part of his skit.”\n\nJagger’s almost country twang like spoken vocal actually feels like we’re in the car with The Rolling Stones’ front man as he’s trying to find the right radio station. Mick really got inside the mindset of this lonesome-behind-the-wheel character in “Far Away Eyes” when he explained the inspiration to this Some Girls countrified classic, “You know when you drive through Bakersfield on a Sunday morning or Sunday evening – I did that about six months ago – all the country music radio stations start broadcasting live from L.A. black gospel services. And that’s what the song refers to. But the song’s really about driving alone, listening to the radio.”\n\nIgor’s wildly eccentric bartender, Julie from Southern Louisiana would take the verses and would have all of us at the bar croon along to the choruses. I like to think, at least, Jagger would find some humor in our drunken “Far Away Eyes” sing-a-long ritual. In Cyrus R.K. Patell’s 33 1/3 tome on The Rolling Stones’ Some Girls, Jagger talked about the southern influences on “Far Away Eyes” when he explained, “I love country music, but I find it hard to take seriously. I also think a lot of country music is sung with the tongue in cheek. The harmonic thing is very different from the blues. It doesn’t bend notes in the same way, so I suppose it’s very English really. Even though it’s been Americanized it feels very close to me, to my roots, so to speak.”\n\nWhile many believe it was Gram Parsons who influenced Some Girls most infamous country song, which Jagger refuted saying that The Stones play a “Sardonic quality” of country music; but Keith Richards had another theory that he shared when he said, “I know (Mick) listens to – and used to – a lot of Merle Haggard (who hails from Bakersfield, California) …When you think about it, he even sings Bakersfield in (Far Away Eyes)… I wonder why Bakersfield? I’ve got to ask him that. Maybe he doesn’t even know himself. It must go back to him listening to a lot of Merle Haggard.”\n\nMan how I loved living my days and nights living in New Orleans; it was so incredible that I actually remember half of it. The most important memories are ones that are linked to music. I recall being at the bar and dreaming of driving some rusty vintage car on a highway in the desert passing the city limits sign of Bakersfield, “Far Away Eyes” is a true road trip classic, a song that I have added to many vacation drive playlists. It’s the perfect car song because Jagger’s lyrics feel like your actually have your gas on the pedal somewhere in California. And every time I spin “Far Away Eyes,” I toast to my favorite New Orleans’ Dive Bar/Laundromat, that wacky bartender, Igor’s jukebox and the eternal memories of hanging at my favorite bar and crooning along to the country inspired catcalls of The Rolling Stones’ “Far Away Eyes.”"
