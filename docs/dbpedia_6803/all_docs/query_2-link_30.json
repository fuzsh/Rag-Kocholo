        "text": "At the BRIT Awards on Saturday night, Raye made history for winning the most awards by any artist in a single year, beating records held by the likes of Harry Styles, Adele and Blur. I, like many other viewers, burst with joy as I watched the singer jump up and down on the stage, barefoot and in tears of triumph.\n\nFor some, Raye is a new artist behind catchy songs like 'Escapism', 'Prada' and 'Flip A Switch', but others are more familiar with the struggles faced by the 26-year-old singer-songwriter from Croydon since entering the music industry. As co-host Clara Amfo put it, \"When we first met in 2014... from 10 years [ago], it just shows that you there is no such thing as an overnight success.\"\n\nRaye, whose full name is Rachel Keene, signed her first record deal with Polydor Records when she was just 17, who now have the likes of Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo and Kendrick Lamar on their books. Despite joining for a four-album deal, her debut solo release, My 21st Century Blues, didn't come out until nine years later – when she had parted ways with the label, and was instead standing on her own two feet as an independent artist.\n\nAs she accepts six out of seven awards she was nominated for at the BRITs, here's why her win is so important for the music industry and independent artists.\n\nRaye rose to fame at 19-years-old, when she featured on Jax Jones' catchy dance track, 'You Don't Know Me'. She then lent her dreamy vocals for similar songs by David Guetta and Major Lazer, and began writing music for the likes of Beyoncé, Ellie Goulding, Rita Ora and more. But, behind the scenes, she was struggling, and in 2021, Raye called out her record label, Polydor.\n\nIn a series of posts on X (formerly known as Twitter) at the time, she wrote, \"Imagine this pain. I have been signed to a major label since 2014… and I have had albums on albums of music sat in folders collecting dust, songs I am now giving away to A-list artists because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough to release an album.\n\n\"I’ve done everything they asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week, ask anyone in the music game, they know. I’m done being a polite pop star. I want to make my album now. Please that is all I want,\" she concluded.\n\nSpeaking to Cosmopolitan UK, she expanded, \"I just felt awful. I wasn’t proud of my art or the way I was living... I wasn’t proud of the woman I was becoming. There was a lot of substance abuse, I was numbing my feelings. I had started avoiding the people who genuinely wanted the best for me because I didn’t want to have to look at my situation. I was spiralling.\"\n\nAfter her tweets went viral, Raye was released from her contract with Polydor without the threat of lawyers, and two years later, she released her first album, My 21st Century Blues, as an independent artist with distribution by Human Re Sources. As she makes BRIT Awards history, it highlights the importance of artists owning their choices.\n\nThe music industry is dominated by record labels like Polydor, Universal and Sony, who often own the master rights to a musician's work. This means that the singers themselves can miss out on the money made from their music, with labels even deciding if and when an artist can release their records. But, with the rise of streaming meaning that a record deal isn't the only way into the industry, musicians are increasingly choosing to go it alone.\n\nIndependent artist can have full creative control over the creation and direction of their music. While it often means that they have to front the costs, they also have full jurisdiction over distribution, marketing, artwork, deadlines and more. There are cons, yes, but the advantages are increasingly appealing in the age of streaming and social media.\n\nWhether it's Taylor Swift re-recording her albums so she can own her masters or Raye, Stormzy, Central Cee, Chance the Rapper and many more releasing their music independently, is it really any surprise that artists often know the best thing for their careers? Hopefully, Raye breaking records and winning Brits is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to normalising this.\n\n\"There is something so poetic about Raye breaking records with her debut album as an independent artist after being treated like sh*t by the industry for a decade,\" a fan wrote on X. \"Few are as talented and work as hard as her. My 21st Century Blues is such a personal album and she deserves this.\" And I agree.\n\n\"I want to normalise giving songwriters master royalty points,\" Raye said while accepting the Songwriter Of The Year award. \"It doesn’t have to be at your expense, but it just means that if the songs win big, then the writers get to win big too. Please allow that to happen,\" she continued, addressing music executives.\n\nThe singer making BRIT Award history is a win for independent musicians and artists everywhere, and given her experiences in the industry, there is no one more deserving than Raye.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
