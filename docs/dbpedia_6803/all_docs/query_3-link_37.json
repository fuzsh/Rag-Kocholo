        "text": "LONDON, England — People often have marveled at the “ageless” Roger Daltrey, who has remained in remarkably good condition during his nearly 60-year career as the lead singer of the Who.\n\nBut time is undefeated and has caught up with Daltrey. He turned 80 on March 1 and in a “backstage diary” for The Times in London, he admits his time is growing short.\n\n“I have to be realistic,” Daltrey says. “The average life expectancy is 83 and with a bit of luck I’ll make that, but we need someone else to drive things.”\n\nRELATED: Rock legend expects to make farewell tour, then ‘crawl off to die’\n\nDaltrey was writing after he and bandmate Pete Townshend performed with the Who last month as part of the Teenage Cancer Trust charity concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Daltrey recently stepped down as curator of the trust after serving in the post for 24 years.\n\nUnder Daltrey’s leadership, the trust raised more than $40 million to be used to care for young cancer sufferers, the Independent reports.\n\nDaltrey has struggled with his voice off and on over the past several years and had surgery to repair a hole in his vocal cords in 2013. He said in The Times article he has worried during recent shows whether he can remember the words to the Who’s many hits, such as “Baba O’Riley,” “My Generation,” and “Love, Reign O’er Me.”\n\n“We haven’t done anything for seven months and this winter’s been brutal,” Daltrey says. “I’ve been in hibernation. For the whole of January, I lost my voice completely.\n\n“I live like a monk and if I went on tour for a week I’d be fit as a butcher’s dog again. But tonight, for the first time in my career, I think, ‘Blimey, this is hard.’”"
