        "text": "Roger Daltrey announces special semi-acoustic U.S. tour in June\n\nLEGENDARY WHO FRONTMAN ROGER DALTREY\n\nANNOUNCES SPECIAL SEMI-ACOUSTIC U.S. TOUR IN JUNE\n\nNINE CITY RUN, ANOTHER CAPSTONE IN THE PERFORMER’S HALL OF FAME CAREER\n\nSpecial Guests on Selected Dates\n\nGrammy Nominated KT TUNSTALL\n\nand Singer/Songwriter DAN BERN\n\nTickets On Sale Starting Friday, March 22 at 10 am Local Time\n\nCheck local Venues for Pre-Sale info\n\nRoger Daltrey – legendary rock icon and co-founder of one of music’s most inspirational and influential forces, The Who, will be returning to the States on a special solo tour this June, presenting a mostly acoustic set of Who gems, rarities, solo nuggets and other surprises with an intimate rock-based band and setting as well as answering questions from the audience, kicking off this very exclusive set of shows on 12 June at Virginia’s renowned Wolf Trap at Filene Center. The nine-city run will continue throughout the month of June (see dates below), wrapping on 29 June at The Pavilion at Ravinia in Highland Park, Illinois.\n\nSpecial guests for the much-anticipated performances include Grammy-nominated Scottish singer/songwriter KT Tunstall and acclaimed, offbeat singer/songwriter Dan Bern. The unique venues and amphitheaters Daltrey has chosen for his summer run will showcase Roger’s acoustic interpretations of his extraordinary canon of Who songs and solo work, supported by a hand-picked ensemble of musicians. Simon Townshend: Guitar and backing vocals; Billy Nicholls: Mandolin and backing vocals; Jody Linscott: Percussion; Doug Boyle: Guitar; John Hogg : Bass and backing vocals; Katie Jacoby: Violin and backing vocals; Steve Weston: Harmonica; Geraint Watkins: Keyboards/accordion; Scott Devours: Drums.\n\nDaltrey’s return to the States follows The Who’s incredibly successful The Who Hits Back! US tour of 2022, with the band’s incomparable frontman drawing praise from all media platforms, including the Dallas Morning News, which said, ‘Daltrey took flight…roaring and howling and ripping his mic cord through the air like he was lassoing cattle…’ The charismatic singer also brought a highly successful solo tour to the States in 2018 via a 10-city run that showcased The Who’s legendary rock opera Tommy, supported by full orchestral backing. Never content to rest on his laurels, the adventurous artist will continue to peel back the layers on his upcoming June tour, excited about expressing more musical shades of his solo palette, which he has generously shared with audiences in the US and beyond throughout his career.\n\nAlso known to be one of rock’s more candid, straight-shooters, the working-class Daltrey (originally from London’s Shepherd’s Bush) will answer questions from the audience during the shows, sharing anecdotes and offering up uniquely tailored renditions of songs seldom performed live either by The Who or Daltrey.\n\nIn crafting this completely new show set to kick off in June 2024, Daltrey looks forward to unveiling one of his more intimate and unique stage shows, an up close and personal gift to his fans that highlights Who rarities, solo hits, and other songs from his incredible near 60-year career.\n\nRoger Daltrey, CBE, Teenage Cancer Trust’s Honorary Patron and co-founder of Teen Cancer America (with Pete Townshend) recently added harmonica to a historic recording. On March 15, Dire Straits’ Mark Knopfler released a new, special recording of his anthemic composition, ‘Going Home (Theme From Local Hero)’ featuring over 60 of the finest rock performers ever assembled on one iconic track, including members of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Dire Straits, The Who, Pink Floyd, Queen, Black Sabbath, The Shadows, Rush, Guns N’ Roses, and many more. The milestone release, currently available to order here, will raise funds for Teenage Cancer Trust in the UK and Teen Cancer America in the US.\n\nROGER DALTREY AND HIS BAND\n\nUS TOUR DATES\n\nSPECIAL GUESTS\n\n*KT TUNSTALL https://www.kttunstall.com\n\n**DAN BERN https://danbern.com"
