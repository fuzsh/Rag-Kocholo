Polydor was founded in 1946 as a division of Deutsche Grammophon and established its UK division 10 years later. It is currently owned by Universal Music Group. The document discusses Polydor's affiliation with other labels and its subsidiaries Fascination Records and Fiction Records. It also provides examples of promotion campaigns for Lady Gaga's Artpop album and Lana Del Rey's Ultraviolence album released through Polydor."
