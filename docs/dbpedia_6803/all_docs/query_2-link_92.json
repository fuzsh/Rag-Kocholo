        "text": "Singer-songwriter Raye says she's been left in \"tears and pain\" as her record label holds back the release of her debut album.\n\nThe singer said in a series of tweets that the situation with Polydor - who she was signed by in 2014 - has made her \"not want to get out of bed\".\n\nAnd speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat, the 23-year-old said she's \"reached breaking point\".\n\nA Polydor spokeswoman said the record label was \"saddened\" by Raye's tweets.\n\nShe added that they've contacted Raye's management team \"to discuss and offer our full support\".\n\nThe singer, who has collaborated with Rudimental and David Guetta, released her new single, Call on Me, earlier this month.\n\nShe said she'll only be allowed to make an album if the single does well.\n\nShe told Newsbeat that not releasing an album yet makes her \"feel like a fraud\".\n\n\"Imagine the pressure of me waking up every day frantically looking at numbers and stats,\" she added in her Twitter thread.\n\nRaye first released music on her record label in 2016 with singles Distraction, Ambition - which featured Stormzy - and I, U, Us.\n\nIn her tweets, she said: \"I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week.\n\n\"I'm done being a polite pop star.\"\n\nRaye, who was born Rachel Keen, told Newsbeat she's \"not sad\" about not having solo success so far because she's not in this \"for the numbers\".\n\n\"For me it's always been about the art. But it makes it difficult when I'm feeling I'm not good enough or being told it's not good enough when I'm not doing those numbers on singles.\"\n\nRaye said she truly believes \"great music finds the light\", especially in the age of streaming.\n\n\"Music speaks louder than words, a sales pitch or marketing campaign could ever,\" she said.\n\n\"We've seen music erupt and blow everyone's expectations, and it's come from the weirdest places. I disagree with limiting artists to one attempt in a single as opposed to a body of work.\"\n\n'Run for the hills'\n\nRaye added that if she could go back in time and tell her 16-year-old anything, it would be to \"run for the hills\".\n\n\"Knowing what I know now, I would not have put pen to paper on a full album record deal.\"\n\nShe said Polydor are \"an incredible company when they want to be\" but if they're not going to let her release an album, she wants them to \"just let me go\".\n\nPolydor haven't responded to a request for comment on the interview Raye has given to Newsbeat.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

A lot of artists have reached out to me and said they're in the same situation,\" she says."
