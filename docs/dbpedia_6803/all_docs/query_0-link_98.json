        "text": "Standing on the Grammy stage, becoming the first person to win Album of the Year four times, Taylor Swift used her speech as a love letter to unheroic work saying, “I would love to tell you that this is the best moment of my life, but I feel this happy when I finish a song, or when I crack the code to a bridge that I love, or when I’m shot listing a music video, or when I’m rehearsing with my dancers, or my band or getting ready to go to Tokyo to play a show. For me the award is the work. All I want to do is keep being able to do this.” The award is the work. What a testament to everything it takes to succeed. Eye on the everyday, not as a grind, but in joyful embrace of doing. This is the stuff I talk about as the unheroic work. Don’t get hijacked by the hype of the killer campaign or distraction of a shiny new object. Stay in the unheroic work of figuring out your ‘song’ and getting the moves right with your team. That’s the stuff that mints value stored in your brand. If you need convincing, consider Taylor Swift’s concerts will generate her over 1 billion towards she can use for more albums, something new or causes she cares about. And all those things grow through use and add more to the brand. That’s how you put the value stored in your brand to work.\n\nNew Post: 9 Artists Could Own the 2024 Grammys Narrative: Here’s What It Would Mean If Each of Them Did - https://lnkd.in/gGNCzzTF - When it comes to the hardware being handed out on Grammy night, all eyes are trained upon the Big Four — the quartet of general categories (album of the year, record of the year, song of the year and best new artist) that not only represent the most coveted trophies of the yearly ceremony, but also help clarify which artist defined that ceremony. Sometimes, like at the 2023 Grammy Awards, four different artists will win the four different prizes; other times, like when Billie Eilish swept the Big Four in 2020 or when Bruno Mars took home three of the top trophies in 2018, it’s clear which artist has owned the evening. So who will define the 2024 Grammys? While there’s a chance that 2024 plays out like 2023 and the Big Four gets divvied up across different stars, nine artists will enter the 66th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday night (Feb. 4) with the opportunity to win multiple Big Four prizes, and effectively command the narrative of music’s biggest night. Those artists range from stadium-shaking superstars and awards-circuit mainstays to outsiders trying to crash the party and veterans attempting to secure the first Grammys of their respective careers. The biggest awards of the night are at stake, and so are the Grammy legacies of everyone involved. Will the front-runners prevail, or could we have a shocking upset? And in either case, what would that mean for the general reception of the artist who comes out most on top? Ahead of the 2024 Grammys, here are the nine artists who have the chance to dominate the narrative of the awards ceremony (in alphabetical order), what they would need to win in order to do so, and what those wins would mean on a grander scale. - ----------------------------------------------------- Download: Stupid Simple CMS - https://lnkd.in/g4y9XFgR\n\nNew Post: Noah Kahan’s ‘Stick Season’ Set For Seventh Week Atop U.K. Chart - https://lnkd.in/dsiMR3nY - Noah Kahan’s “Stick Season” (via Republic Records) is sticking around in the U.K., where it’s predicted to notch a seventh consecutive week at No. 1. Based on midweek sales and streaming data published by the Official Charts Company, “Stick Season” is the clear favorite, accumulating double the tally of its nearest competitor. That distant rival is Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control” (Atlantic) which is primed for a new peak position, lifting 3-2 on the Official Chart Update. There’s a chance Kahan could snag his first chart double. His Stick Season LP rises to No. 2 on the midweek albums tally — an all-time high — with Declan McKenna and his third album What Happened To The Beach? (via Columbia) the only objects currently blocking his path. Meanwhile, Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s 2001 hit “Murder on the Dancefloor” (Polydor) continues to feel the Saltburn bump, dipping 2-3 on the singles chart blast. Meanwhile, Benson Boone’s “Beautiful Things” (Warner Records) is poised to do something it has never done before; it’s set to gain 8-4 for a new peak position. The 21-year-old Washington native currently leads the Billboard Global 200 chart with his rock ballad. Ella Henderson and Rudimental’s “Alibi” (Atlantic) scaled a new peak last Friday, rising 24-16 in its fourth week. The only way is apparently up for “Alibi,” which is poised for a No. 12 spot on the national chart. “Alibi” samples the late Coolio’s hit “Gangsta’s Paradise” (which in turn sampled Stevie Wonder 1976 single “Pastime Paradise”), a 1995 hit which logged two weeks at No. 1 and finished the year as the U.K.’s second biggest-selling single. Finally, Norwegian producer Kygo and U.S. singer Ava Max are expected to crack the U.K. top 20 for the first time with “Whatever” (Columbia/Kygo), improving 28-19 on the chart blast. The EDM tune samples “Whenever, Wherever,” the lead single from Shakira’s debut English-language studio album, Laundry Service, from 2001. All will be revealed when the Official U.K. Singles Chart is published late Friday, Feb. 16. - #news #business #world -------------------------------------------------- Download: Stupid Simple CMS - https://lnkd.in/g4y9XFgR -------------------------------------------------- or download at SourceForge - https://lnkd.in/gNqB7dnp\n\nNew Post: Pearl Jam Unleashes ‘Dark Matter,’ Sets New Album - https://lnkd.in/dyxWGuZe - Pearl Jam is back, and they’ve returned to heavy. After throwing a listening party last month for a new album that frontman Eddie Vedder described as their “best” work, fans everywhere can now test that theory. The Rock Hall-inducted Seattle legends unleash “Dark Matter,” a muscular romp of power chords, in-your-face bass, drum fills and a late solo could cut a can in half. “Dark Matter” leads the way for the album of the same name, due out April 19. That twelfth studio album is the followup to 2020’s Gigaton, which peaked at No.15 on the Billboard 200 and was described by some devotees as their most experimental album yet. Based on the three-and-a-half minutes of “Dark Matter,” this next phase will rock.

There are many songs that gain momentum each summer, but only a few reach the top of Billboard’s Hot Latin Songs chart, becoming the most popular tunes of the season. Undoubtedly, the last 10 years have produced tracks worthy of inclusion in the playlists of 2024: urban-flavored tracks like “Bailando” by Enrique Iglesias featuring Descemer Bueno and Gente de Zona, which took over the summer of 2014, and “El perdón” by Nicky Jam and Enrique Iglesias which conquered the top of the chart for 30 weeks in 2015. And let’s not forget the global phenomenon that was “Despacito” by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, whose impact transcended beyond 2017 and to date continues to be heard around the world. Nor can we fail to mention the Mexican music hit “Ella Baila Sola” by Eslabon Armado and Peso Pluma, which swept the summer of 2023. In addition to the phenomenon of “Gata Only”, which has been at the top of the chart for 14 weeks in 2024 and with which FloyyMenor and Cris MJ made history as the first Chileans to enter the top 10 of the chart in 25 years. Get ready to embark on a nostalgic musical journey through the Latin songs that accompanied your moments under the sun for the past 10 years. From “Ritmo” to “Despacito,” here are all the songs that were crowned No. 1 hits on the Hot Latin Songs chart each year between June and August, in chronological order. - #news #business #world -------------------------------------------------- Download: #Google #Font #Tester - https://lnkd.in/gKAZYbVN\n\nDid Vice President Kamala Harris just make a political statement through her vinyl picks? 🎷 Caught some intriguing footage of Harris embracing the rich history and profound messages in jazz music! She was seen exiting a record store with some classic vinyl: Roy Ayers, George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess performed by Black artists Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, and the innovative Charlie Mingus. These picks are more than just music—they’re powerful statements on pluralism and equality. 🌍✊ George Gershwin, the Jewish son of Russian immigrants, crafted Porgy and Bess to bridge cultural divides, blending classical and jazz elements to highlight the African-American experience. Roy Ayers, the epitome of cool in mid-70s soft funk, brought a laid-back, groovy vibe that continues to inspire with its smooth, soulful sound. Early 70's funk was a distinctly Afro-American style, blending soul, jazz, and R&B. Charlie Mingus, one of jazz’s greatest innovators, fearlessly challenged racial and social boundaries with his bold compositions and outspoken views on social justice. Mingus himself had a rich heritage with British, Chinese, Swedish, and African roots, which influenced his diverse and dynamic musical style. This footage isn’t just a politician buying records. It’s a clever statement on pluralism and equality, core values of American democracy. If you’re not familiar with these records, I encourage you to explore them and consider the political aspects they hold. Now that we’re aware of these aspects, ask yourself: what is the hidden meaning and message of your own playlist? 🎶 Can you guess other Harris' musical choices and do you think you share the same taste? #JazzHistory #CulturalDiversity #KamalaHarris #RoyAyers #LouisArmstrong #EllaFitzgerald #CharlieMingus #MusicForChange #LeadershipThroughArt\n\nBeyond the New York Phil, it’s not a coincidence that the vast majority of these assaulted musicians are pre-tenure or subs. Because the perpetrators ARE PREDATORS, selecting and grooming their victims with pure, cold, calculation. In the orchestra, ranks are closed against outsiders all too often, and predators capitalize. The horrible details of the article—the difficult-to-trace rape drug, the tampon, and the dismissal or departure of the victim and/or their supporters while the rapist was allowed to keep their job—hit with a sickening blow of recognition: They are, in various combination, common among more than one friend, more than one family member, and more than one colleague. Many more. Artists exist at the forefront of change. So how are we so backward on this? Because we allow the organization with its bureaucratic so-called best practices to “handle it.” And handle it they do, with their closed-door executive sessions where optics, messaging, and fallout control reign supreme and justice is regarded as a liability. Every orchestra needs a musician committee of allies who demand to be involved in seeking due process and equity in these matters, because the current system is simply one of damage control, not justice. Demand it now. All of us have the duty to speak truth to power and close ranks against predators, not victims. https://lnkd.in/gweXqqc9"
