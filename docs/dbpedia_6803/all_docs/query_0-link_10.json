        "text": "The Who are an English rock band that released ten studio albums between 1965 and 1982, including the rock operas Tommy and Quadrophenia.\n\nThey started during the early sixties beat boom when singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist–songwriter Pete Townshend, and bassist John Entwistle evolved from West London hopefuls The Detours. In 1964, drummer Keith Moon joined and they settled as The Who (after a brief spell as The High Numbers). They issued three 1965 singles — “I Can’t Explain,” “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere,” and “My Generation” — all UK hits and anthems of the mod movement. Their debut album, My Generation, placed them at the forefront of hard rock and spawned further hits with “The Kids Are Alright,” and “A Legal Matter.”\n\nIn 1966, The Who charted with the lyrically ironic “Substitute” and the slapstick-themed “Happy Jack.” Their second album, A Quick One, contains a six-part title-suite billed as the first “rock opera.” They psyched up for their 1967 singles “Pictures of Lily” and “I Can See for Miles,” their breakthrough hit in the US, where they floored audiences at the Monterey Pop Festival and made an explosive appearance on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.\n\nThe Who took a conceptual turn on The Who Sell Out, which contains songs about products and eccentric people, intermixed with radio jingles. Their 1968 hit “Magic Bus” signaled an embrace of belted vocals, semi-acoustic textures, and looser, percussive passages — key features of their seventies style.\n\nIn 1969, The Who released Tommy, a four-sided rock opera about a deaf, dumb, and blind boy whose enhanced vibration senses make him the world’s greatest pinball player. It spawned the radio evergreens “Pinball Wizard” and “We’re Not Going to Take It.” The ensuing nineteen-month tour, marked by shows at the Woodstock and Isle of Wight festivals, established the band as global superstars and Townshend as one of rock’s leading spokesmen.\n\nTownshend’s next project, Lifehouse, concerned a future society where people connect to a global Grid and consume music, news, and sensations through lifesuits. While the concept was unfathomable to pre-internet seventies audiences, key songs from the project comprise Who’s Next, including the radio evergreens “Baba O’Riley,” “Bargain,” “Behind Blue Eyes,” and “Won’t Get Fooled Again.” The Lifehouse concept spawned further songs, including their 1972 singles “Join Together” and “Relay.”\n\nIn 1973, The Who released Quadrophenia, a four-sided rock opera about Jimmy, a pill-popping mod whose tribulations through work, love, family, and society drive him to double-schizophrenia. Its collection of rock anthems includes “The Real Me,” “The Punk and the God Father,” “The Dirty Jobs,” “Helpless Dancer” (Roger’s theme), “I’ve Had Enough,” “5:15,” “Bell Boy” (Keith’s theme), “Doctor Jimmy,” and “Love, Reign o’er Me” (Pete’s theme). The story spawned a coming-of-age drama film co-starring Police frontman Sting as the Ace Face, Jimmy’s role model.\n\nThe Who reached the height of their global stardom with the 1975 release The Who by Numbers. On the accompanying twelve-month tour, they played before more than 75,000 fans at the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan. By now, each member had released solo albums. Daltrey starred as Tommy in filmmaker Ken Russell’s musical adaptation of the 1969 rock opera.\n\nIn 1978, the band returned with Who Are You, comprised of complex songs about musical innovation (“Guitar and Pen”) and defiance (“Sister Disco,” “Music Must Change”). The title track, with its self-referential chorus, became another evergreen and Who signature. This would be their last album with Moon, who died shortly after at age 32. Moon’s legacy with the band is chronicled in the docu-film The Kids Are Alright, assembled from thirteen years of live performances and television clips. The Who hired ex-Small Faces and Faces drummer Kenney Jones and resumed touring.\n\nTownshend broke through as a solo artist with his 1980 release Empty Glass and the hits “Let My Love Open the Door” and “Rough Boys.” Meanwhile, The Who entered the video age with Face Dances and the MTV clips “You Better You Bet,” “Don’t Let Go the Coat,” and “Another Tricky Day.” Daltrey’s acting took a serious turn in the biographical crime drama McVicar. The Who played on the soundtrack, which contains Roger’s solo hits “Without Your Love” and “Free Me.”\n\nIn 1982, Townshend released All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes, a personal artistic statement with an accompanying video. Soon after, The Who released It’s Hard, a mix of uptempo rockers (“Athena”) and poignant lyrical numbers (“I’ve Known No War”). The hi-tech “Eminence Front” became another Who signature. That fall, they launched what was billed as their final tour.\n\nThe Who regrouped in 1985 for an appearance at Live Aid. In 1989, the surviving founders (Townshend, Daltrey, Entwistle) toured Tommy with an enlarged band of auxiliary players. They did the same in 1996–97 for Quadrophenia, enhanced with film projections and guest-star vocalists. In the 21st century, The Who resumed touring on a semi-regular basis. After Entwistle’s death, the remaining band released Endless Wire (2006) and Who (2019).\n\nMembers: Roger Daltrey (vocals, tambourine, harmonica, guitar), John Entwistle (bass, French horn, piano, vocals, 1961-2002), Pete Townshend (guitar, organ, synthesizer, piano, vocals, 1962-present), Keith Moon (drums, percussion, vocals, 1964-78), Kenney Jones (drums, 1979-88)\n\nBackground\n\nThe Who evolved from Acton-area combo The Detours, formed in 1959 by 15-year-old ruffian Roger Daltrey, who initially played guitar. In 1961, he recruited bassist John Entwistle into the band, which purveyed the era’s instrumental rock (The Shadows, The Tornados). The following year, 30-year-old Doug Sandom assumed the drum seat.\n\nThe Detours stabilized in late 1962 when Daltrey became the singer and they hired Entwistle’s friend, guitarist Pete Townshend, to round out the lineup. They opened for some of England’s leading pre-Beatles rock acts, including Shane Fenton & the Fentones and Johnny Kidd & the Pirates. After learning that the name Detours was already in use, the band changed its name to The Who.\n\nBy early 1964, The Who was drawing crowds on the London club circuit. They secured an audition with Fontana Records, but complaints arose over Sandom’s drumming. He was promptly cut from the band, which used a stand-in drummer for several weeks. In April, they were approached by 17-year-old drummer Keith Moon, who broke a drum skin during his audition. His arrival completed the classic Who four-piece that would last fourteen years.\n\nThat spring, The Who hired publicist Pete Meaden as their manager. He suggested they change their name to The High Numbers and adopt the mod image. Under this guise, they issued the June 1964 Fontana single “Zoot Suit,” a song about dress-up, named after the 1940s Harlem V-line suit with a tune lifted from “Misery” by the American R&B group the Dynamics. The b-side, “I’m the Face,” transforms the R&B standard “Got Love If You Want It” by bluesman Slim Harpo into a tune about being ‘The Face’ (the most stylish mod on the scene). Meaden penned both sets of lyrics. When the single failed to chart, the band reverted to The Who and fired Meaden.\n\nThe Who were then taken under the managerial wing of filmmakers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, who filmed the band during a gig at the Railway Inn on King’s Road for use in a promo film. On a subsequent date, Townshend (a six-footer) accidentally broke the neck of his guitar against the low ceiling of the Railway and, in a rage, smashed the instrument against the stage. At the close of the following week’s set, Moon kicked his bass drum afield. These antics, along with Townshend’s windmill strum and Daltrey’s mic-cable whipping motions, became features of The Who’s live act.\n\nIn November 1964, The Who cut their first proper single at Pye Studios in London with American producer Shel Talmy, a soundman on recent singles by The Fortunes, The Hearts, and The Kinks‘ riff-fest “All Day and All of the Night,” which influenced Townshend’s new writing.\n\n1965: First Three Singles, Album\n\n“I Can’t Explain”\n\nOn January 15, 1965, The Who released “I Can’t Explain,” a three-chord rocker about the perplexing emotions of first-time love (“Dizzy in the head and I’m feeling blue”). The verses are driven by a closed-cadence, three-chord riff (E→DD→A→EE), followed by an open-cadence, four-chord sequence on the chorus (E…E…C#…C#…A…A…B…B…). Vocal group The Ivy League performs backing vocals and hand claps on the song.\n\n“I Can’t Explain” appeared on Brunswick, backed with the Talmy-penned “Bald Headed Woman,” a song recorded by The Kinks on their debut album and subsequently cut by Swedish popsters The Hep Stars. It’s a blues lurch with a fluid, crashing outro; sung by Daltrey in an unrecognizable low register. Jimmy Page, a prominent London session guitarist, plays the fuzz solo.\n\nIn the United States, the single appeared on Decca on December 19, 1964; four weeks ahead of its UK release. “I Can’t Explain” reached No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 14 in France.\n\nThe Who played more than ninety shows between January and May 1965. They mostly played the London area but also appeared in Manchester (4/23/65: Oasis Club), Newcastle (5/3: Majestic), Bristol (5/19: Corn Exchange), and Sheffield (5/30: King Mojo Club). On May 6, they played the Two Red Shoes Ballroom in Elgin, Scotland; their first of three consecutive shows north of the border.\n\n“Anyway Anyhow Anywhere”\n\nOn May 21, 1965, The Who released “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere,” a four-chord rocker about unrestrained freedom and fearless defiance (“Nothing gets in my way, not even locked doors; Don’t follow the lines that been laid before”). It opens with a thundering, reverb-laden bar-chord strum (D… C… A), followed by flowing, harmonized verses (D… G→A). Townshend employs feedback on the middle eight, where they jam in A major. Session pianist Nicky Hopkins guests on the track.\n\n“Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere” was their second of three consecutive singles on Brunswick and the only Who original joint-credited to Townshend and Daltrey. It reached No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. The UK b-side, “Daddy Rolling Stone,” was written by American pianist Otis Blackwell, who wrote early rock ‘n’ roll hits for Elvis Presley (“Don’t Be Cruel,” “All Shook Up”) and Jerry Lee Lewis (“Great Balls of Fire”).\n\nIn the US, “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere” appeared on June 5 on Decca, backed with the Garnet Mimms cover “Anytime You Want Me.” The Who performed “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere” on the July 1, 1965, episode of the ITV music program Ready Steady Go!\n\nThe Who played their first cross-channel show on June 1 at L’Olympia in Paris, France. On July 15, they played the Ritz in Llanelli, Wales. On Saturday the 19th, The Who played the Uxbridge Blues & Folk Festival, which also had sets by Marianne Faithfull, Solomon Burke, the Spencer Davis Group, Zoot Money, and The Birds, a Decca shortplayer act with bassist Kim Gardner and guitarist Ron Wood. That fall, The Who played shows in the Netherlands (9/21: De Marathon, The Hague), Denmark (9/25: K.B. Hallen, Copenhagen), and Sweden (10/10: Johanneshovs Isstadion, Stockholm).\n\n“My Generation”\n\nOn October 29, 1965, The Who released “My Generation,” an anthem of youthful defiance (“I hope I die before I get old”) and new-breed exclusivity (“Why don’t you all f-fade away… Don’t try to dig what we all s-s-s-say”). The song’s riff — four down strokes of G, followed by four of F — modulates one whole step for the second verse (A–G) and another whole step for the third (B–A), then crests on C for the explosive, pile-driving finale. Between the first and second verse, Townshend and Moon do tradeoffs with Entwistle, who plays four virtuoso runs (two bars each) across a sixteen-bar instrumental sequence. Daltrey’s stuttering vocals were influenced by the John Lee Hooker number “Stuttering Blues.”\n\n“My Generation” reached No. 2 in the UK and Australia and No. 3 in Canada. It also went Top 10 in the Netherlands, Ireland, Austria, and West Germany. The b-side, “Shout and Shimmy,” is an energetic take on the 1962 hit by James Brown.\n\nIn the US, “My Generation” appeared on November 20 on Decca and reached No. 74 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Decca b-side, “Out In the Street,” is a Townshend original that starts with a variation of the “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere” riff (an F#–E–B reverb-laden strum), followed with F# verses where Moon applies hurricane fills to the Bo Diddley beat.\n\nThe Who greeted the single’s UK release with an October 31 show at The Beatles‘ old stomping ground: the Cavern club in Liverpool.\n\nMy Generation\n\nThe Who released their debut studio album, My Generation, in December 1965 on Brunswick (UK, Europe) and Festival Records (Oceania). Side one features both sides of the title-sake Decca single, opening with “Out In the Street.”\n\nTownshend wrote six new songs, including the Beatle-esque harmony rockers “La-La-La Lies,” “Much Too Much,” and “The Kids Are Alright” — all about the innocence and confusion of young courtship. On “It’s Not True,” Daltrey rebuts a slew of rumors (mixed ancestry, foreign origins, patricide, imprisonment, serial paternity) with high-minded assurance (“Cause I’m up here and you’re nowhere”).\n\nTownshend sings “A Legal Matter,” a rejection of matrimony and garden rails with a four-note staccato guitar figure. “The Good’s Gone” has a picked slide over a droning B, inspired by The Kinks’ recent “See My Friends,” a pioneering blend of rock and Indo pop.\n\nMy Generation also includes covers of two James Brown soul ballads (“I Don’t Mind,” “Please, Please, Please”) and a bluesy take on the Bo Diddley standard “I’m a Man,” recently cultivated as a fuzz-rocker by the Yardbirds. The album closes with “The Ox,” a “Wipe Out”-style instrumental by Townshend, Entwistle, Moon, and Hopkins, who guests on the track. The group dubbed John “the Ox” because of his higher threshold for alcohol and food.\n\nDecca photographer David Wedgbury took the My Generation cover: an aerial shot where The Who gaze skyward in mod attire. The Union Jack jacket draped around Entwistle’s shoulders is an emblem of mod style.\n\nTalmy produced the album at IBC Studios in London, where The Who recorded the R&B covers in April 1965. That fall, the band recorded Townshend’s new originals after twice-charting with his a-sides.\n\nMy Generation reached No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 4 on the Finnish Albums chart.\n\n1966: Singles, Second Album\n\nOn January 12, 1966, The Who recorded “Circles,” a mid-tempo harmony rocker (in A) with trebly bass and Entwistle on French horn. Townshend, seeking to expand the group’s sound, informed Lambert of John’s abilities as a trumpeter.\n\nThey intended to make this a single, backed with “Instant Party Mixture,” a tambourine pop singalong with a “Runaround Sue” progression and vocable. However, The Who broke from Talmy and signed to Reaction, a new label started by Robert Stigwood, an emerging mogul who recently managed Tyneside mods the Junco Partners. The Who entered Olympic Studios on February 12 to cut a new single.\n\n“Substitute”, “Circles”\n\nOn March 4, 1966, The Who released “Substitute,” a strum-along rife with lyrical paradoxes. Townshend wrote the song after hearing the line “Although she may be cute, she’s just a substitute” in “The Tracks of My Tears,” a recent single by Smokey Robinson & the Miracles. He lifted the cadence (but not the chord sequence) from “Where Is My Girl,” a single Pete reviewed for Melody Maker by Robb Storme & The Whispers (a precursor to Orange Bicycle).\n\n“Substitute” has a three-chord intro–chorus progression (DD→A…GG→DD) and resides in D major (verses), E minor (bridge), and A (middle eight). The lyrics mix negation (“I look pretty tall but my heels are high”), deprecation (“I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth”), and convoluted lines (“The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south”).\n\nTownshend produced “Substitute,” which initially featured an identical remake of “Circles” (retitled “Instant Party,” but not the same song as “Instant Party Mixture”) on the b-side, but Talmy had this pressing of the single withdrawn via court order. To get the single back in stores, Stigwood licensed “Waltz for a Pig,” an unused instrumental by the Graham Bond Organization, which appears as the b-side on most Reaction copies of “Substitute.”\n\nTalmy countered “Substitute” with a Bruswick 7″ release of “A Legal Matter,” backed with the original “Instant Party” (aka the original “Circles”). Dutch copies of this single incorrectly list the b-side as “Instant Party Mixture” (a song that remained vaulted until the 2002 reissue of My Generation). Concurrently, The Fleur de Lys issued a Jimmy Page-produced cover of “Circles” on Andrew Loog Oldham’s Immediate label.\n\nMeanwhile, “Substitute” reached No. 5 in the UK, No. 2 in the Netherlands, and also went Top 20 in Belgium and West Germany.\n\nOn April 24, 1966, Decca issued the band’s first album in North American as The Who Sings My Generation. This version replaces “I’m a Man” with “Instant Party” (aka “Circles”). The cover is a medium upshot of The Who with Big Ben in the background.\n\nThe Who embarked on a package tour with the Spencer Davis Group, the New Merseys, and Jimmy Cliff & The Sound System. This consisted of two nightly shows in eight cities, starting April 14 at the Gaumont in Southampton and ending on the 25th at the Pavilion in Bath. On May 7, the Who made their Irish debut at the National Boxing Stadium in Dublin.\n\nOn May 30, The Who appeared at the Sincil Bank Football Ground in Lincoln for the Whit Monday Pop Gala Festival, which also featured sets by Yardbirds; Small Faces; The Kinks; Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames; Screaming Lord Sutch; Crispian St Peters; Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich; Alan Price Set; She Trinity; and the Koobas. This marked the debut performance by The Creation, a mod band that evolved from The Mark Four.\n\n“I’m a Boy”\n\nOn August 26, 1966, The Who released “I’m a Boy,” a pop dramedy in which Daltrey sings as Bill: a last-born boy with three older sisters (Jean Marie, Felicity, Sally Joy) whose mother wanted only girls and raises him as one. The song starts with a soft vocable over two chords (A… E…), followed by faint, nervous verses where Bill introduces his sisters. He intensifies on the bridge, where he reveals his predicament (“I feel lucky if I get trousers to wear, spend evenings taking hairpins from my hair”). The chorus is a flowing, harmonized iteration of the title (over a I-IV-V progression in A), suffixed with Bill’s allegations of his mother’s denial and how she’d likely scold him if he states out loud that he’s a boy.\n\nTownshend conceived “I’m a Boy” as a section of Quads, an unfinished song suite about a future society in which gender engineering is commonplace. Lambert produced the song at IBC and encouraged Pete to explore other possible multi-song themes: a concept dubbed the “rock opera.”\n\n“I’m a Boy” reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. The b-side, “In The City,” is the only Who song co-credited to Entwistle and Moon. It’s a mid-tempo singalong (in E) with beach-culture lyrics inspired by Keith’s love for American surf rock. John plays trumpet on the track.\n\nJust ahead of “I’m a Boy,” Brunswick issued “The Kids Are Alright” as a single, backed with “The Ox.” The a-side — with its three-chord strum (D…G→A), Beatle-esque harmonies, and carefree lyrics about a guy who “must get out in the light” as his girl stays behind with his guy friends — became a Who signature.\n\nReady Steady Who\n\nOn November 11, 1966, The Who released Ready Steady Who, a five-song EP that contains the second version of “Circles” and a new Townshend original, “Disguises,” a psychedelic rocker with backward symbols over woodblocks and a fuzzy, jangly guitar figure (in E and F#). The flipside features three covers: “Batman,” “Bucket ‘T’,” and “Barbara Anne.” The EP is named after Ready Steady Go!, the 1963–66 ITV music program hosted by Cathy McGowan.\n\n“Batman” — the theme to the American action comedy series starring Adam West — is a 90-second, three-note chromatic melody; instrumental apart from iterations of the title. The American surf-rock duo Jan & Dean recently covered “Batman” on a Liberty single, backed with the jumpy “Bucket ‘T’,” which Moon sings on the Who version, interjected by Entwistle on French horn. “Barbara Anne” was a 1961 doo-wop hit for The Regents and a recent hit for The Beach Boys, whose rocked-up version is emulated here.\n\nMeanwhile, Brunswick pulled one last single from My Generation: “La-La-La-Lies” (b/w “The Good’s Gone”). It went head-to-head with The Who’s upcoming Reaction single.\n\n“Happy Jack”\n\nOn December 3, 1966, The Who released “Happy Jack,” a quirky number with fairy tale lyrics about a sand-dwelling character that Townshend recalled from his childhood. The song begins with a nine-note melodic run that lands on a matted, closed-cadence D. Roger sings of the little man on the Isle of Man who was always happy; covered in sand as kids rode on his head. Pete and John overlay the flowing, swelling chorus; bellowing:\n\nThe kids couldn’t hurt Jack\n\nThey tried and tried and tried\n\nThey dropped things on his back\n\nAnd lied and lied and lied and lied and lied\n\n“Happy Jack” reached No. 3 in the UK and No. 1 in Canada. It was accompanied by an early music video: a b&w clip where The Who plays a gang of spivs who gain entry to a room with a safe, where a pin-striped, cigar-toting Roger mans the door while Pete and Keith monkey with the lock. Scarface John discovers a pie, which soon distracts the two would-be picklocks. A pie fight ensues; the building guard gets pied the moment he marches in on the shenanigans.\n\nEntwistle wrote the b-side, “I’ve Been Away,” a simple waltz comprised of bass (in G), piano (accented fifths), and cymbals. The lyrics concern a newly freed innocent man who did time for a crime committed by his brother Bill.\n\nA Quick One\n\nThe Who released their second album, A Quick One, on December 9, 1966, on Reaction. Lambert encouraged each member to write two songs for the album.\n\nEntwistle, initiating his role as the band’s secondary writer, contributed the creeping dark-comedy ditties “Boris the Spider” and “Whiskey Man.” Moon also wrote two numbers, including “Cobwebs and Strange,” a Dixieland circus instrumental run amok. Daltrey, in his first of only two solo writing credits for the band, contributed “See My Way,” a galloping two-chord pop song all of 113 seconds.\n\nTownshend composed the album’s four remaining originals, including the opener “Run Run Run,” a harmonized R&B–beat rocker with a dirgy guitar groove in G minor. On side two, his contributions include “So Sad About Us,” a Beatle-esque harmony-pop tune; and “Don’t Look Away,” a jangly upbeat number with a cataclysmic pre-chorus (“There’s a stone in my shoe, so I can’t catch you up; My head’s in a lion’s mouth, wants to eat me up”).\n\n“Boris the Spider” is a comedy–horror tune about a small, hairy tarantula that John spots crawling up a wall (first verse). The spider escapes from his view (second verse), but John soon finds it motionless (third verse). To make sure it’s dead, he smashes the spider with a book, leaving Boris “embedded in the ground.” The song’s theme is a rumbling, chromatic bassline (D–D♭–C–B–B♭–F–G…) where John sings the title in a deep, haunting voice, interjected with a frightened “creepy, crawly” refrain.\n\n“Whiskey Man” is a character that emerges when the narrator either hallucinates or self-intoxicates. It’s unclear whether the whiskey man is an imaginary friend or a Mr. Hyde-like drunken alter ego. By the third verse, the narrator is confined to a gloomy padded cell. Musically, the song is a tight, deep, bass-driven number with a descending pattern rooted in G.\n\nThe album concludes with Townshend’s first completed rock opera: a nine-minute suite titled “A Quick One, While He’s Away.” It chronicles the story of a woman who has an extramarital affair while her engine driver husband (later identified as Jerrald) is out on the road for an extended period. The suite consists of six parts:\n\n1. An a cappella that twice states “Her Man’s been gone for nigh on year; He was due home yesterday, But he ain’t here.”\n\n2. A jangly folk-rock verse (in D) where word seems to travel to the missing husband about his lonely wife “Whose crying can be heard all around the world.”\n\n3. A harmonized pop section with “Fa-la-la-la-la” vocables (in B♭). Someone presents a present to the wife: “We have a remedy… we’ll give him eagle’s wings.”\n\n4. A drum-rolled, creeping two-note guitar figure. She meets her seducer: “My name is Ivan, I’m an engine driver.” He knows her husband and relays his messages.\n\n5. A three-note boogie (in C) where the speaker ensures the wife that hubby will “soon be home.”\n\n6. A flowing, harmonized rocker (in D) where Pete (Jerald) returns in disbelief as she repeats his name in glee. She confesses her infidelity, but he chimes “you are forgiven.”\n\nA Quick One also includes a cover of the Holland–Dozier–Holland Motown classic “Heat Wave,” a 1963 hit for Martha & the Vandellas.\n\nSessions took place between late August and November at IBC, Pye, and Regent Sound Studios. Lambert produced A Quick One and its surrounding singles in succession with three Fontana singles by the pop-vocal duo The Merseys, a spinoff of The Merseybeats that charted with “Sorrow.”\n\nA Quick One has cover art by illustrator Alan Aldridge, who supplied a Pop Art illustration of The Who with a song title from each member emitted with onomatopoeic letters. The back cover shows their four disembodied heads against a black background. Aldridge notched further visual credits on albums by Cream (Farewell) and Family (Family Entertainment).\n\nIn North America, the album appeared on Decca in February 1967 as Happy Jack. The song was added to US copies (in place of “Heat Wave”) to capitalize on its popularity in Canada and the US, where “Happy Jack” became their first Top 30 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 (at No. 24). A Quick One reached No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nOn December 31, The Who appeared at London’s Roundhouse as part of Psychedelicamania, billed as a New Year’s Eve All Night Rave with performances by rising stars The Move and Pink Floyd. On March 25, 1967, The Who made their US live debut as part of a 5th Dimension package tour at the RKO 58th Street Theater in New York City, where they did a nine-day engagement of three nightly shows through April 2.\n\n1967: Singles, US Tour and Third Album\n\n“Pictures of Lily”\n\nOn April 22, 1967, The Who released “Pictures of Lily,” a harmony-pop number concerning a teenage boy’s lustful obsession with an old-time pinup. The boy falls in love with the subject, only to learn that she’s been dead since 1929. The pinup in question is purportedly based on Edwardian actress–socialite Lillie Langtry (1853–1929). This was their first single on Track Record, a new label established by Lambert and Stamp.\n\n“Pictures of Lily” consists of polychord descents that start in C and land in G. On each pivotal third line where the father speaks, the progression shifts to A minor and lands in E minor. After revealing that his “nights ain’t quite so lonely,” Roger sings call-and-response with the band, who double-emphasize the line “I don’t feel bad at all.” The chorus follows the same progression as the verses; dropping to A major for the “solved my childhood problem” line. The post-chorus features stop–start power chords (E-E-E→D→E) that became commonplace in future Who rockers. Entwistle’s French horn solo, played in emulation of the WWI klaxon alert, pivots the song to a new verse.\n\nEntwistle wrote the b-side, “Doctor, Doctor,” a fast, banging proto-punk song with frantic vocals, buzzing guitar, and hyperactive percussion. The lyrics concern a hypochondriac with a litany of suspected ailments. The song is mostly in A but drops to a dominant chord and zigzags between sevenths, sixes, and fourths — a further example of their increased complexity.\n\nOn April 5, 1967, The Who embarked on a two-week tour of Germany, where they played thirteen shows. While there, they performed “Pictures of Lily” for the May 1 broadcast of the Radio Bremen music program Beat-Club. By now, their mod look had given way to longer hair and looser cuffs. In the clip, Moon sports a white ruffled shirt that frills out from his black velvet jacket. After that taping, The Who played their first shows in Finland (4/30: Ice Hall, Helsinki), Norway (5/2: Njårdhallen, Oslo), and Belgium, where they performed at the May 20 Woluwe Festival in Brussels.\n\n“Pictures of Lily” reached No. 4 in the UK, No. 5 in Germany and the Netherlands, No. 6 in Belgium, and No. 9 in Austria.\n\nFirst US Tour\n\nOn June 14, 1967, The Who embarked on their first proper US tour in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where they opened for Herman’s Hermits at the Fifth Dimension Club. The following night, The Who played the Cellar, a teen club in Arlington Heights, Illinois, where the power failed after fifteen minutes. They performed “Substitute,” “Happy Jack,” and roused the crowd with “My Generation” as the lights flickered.\n\nThe Who flew out to California for a June 16–17 engagement at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco with Oakland soul-rockers the Loading Zone. The Who consolidated their stateside breakthrough at the Monterey International Pop Festival, a three-day event at the Monterey County Fairgrounds with sets by Al Kooper, The Electric Flag, Eric Burdon & the Animals, Hugh Masekela, Janis Joplin, Lou Rawls, Laura Nyro, Otis Redding, and the Steve Miller Band. The Who played their six-song set on the evening of day three (June 18) ahead of the festival’s other breakout act, the Jimi Hendrix Experience.\n\nBurdon introduced The Who’s set, which featured the last-four singles (barring “I’m a Boy”) plus “A Quick One” and the Eddie Cochran standard “Summertime Blues.” At the climax of “My Generation,” Townshend smashed his guitar into an amp stack that Moon rigged with smoke bombs. As concert staff rushed the stage before a stunned audience, Keith kicked over his drum kit and the band walked off. After a three-song set by the Grateful Dead, Hendrix played a nine-song set of material from his recent debut, Are You Experienced?, along with several covers, including The Troggs‘ recent “Wild Thing,” which he ended by setting his guitar on fire.\n\nOn June 28, The Who rush-recorded cover versions of The Rolling Stones hits “The Last Time” and “Under My Thumb.” Though done as a fund-raiser for Mick Jagger and Keith Richards — both recently jailed on drug charges — the pair were freed and acquitted by June 30 when the single hit shelves. Townshend played bass on this recording in lieu of Entwistle, who was away on his honeymoon.\n\nThe Who commenced a two-month North American tour on July 7, 1967, at the Shore Club in Lido Beach, NY. They covered forty-seven cities, including Portland, Ore. (7/14: Memorial Coliseum), Seattle (7/15: Center Coliseum), Houston (7/22: Sam Houston Coliseum), Baton Rouge, Louisiana (7/26: Redemptorist High School Football Stadium), Chicago (8/5: International Amphitheater), Boston (8/8: Boston Gardens), and Philadelphia (8/24: Civic Center). On August 12, they played the Asbury Park Convention Center with the Blues Magoos. The tour wrapped on September 9 at the International Center Arena in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nOn September 17, The Who performed “My Generation” on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, a CBS sketch–variety show hosted by the team of Tom and Dick Smothers. During the song’s closeout jam in C major, as smoke billowed behind a pair of amps, Townshend hammered his Gibson into the left amp and sparked a blast. As Pete continued thrashing his guitar, Moon kicked over his left bass drum and then the right one, which (unbeknownst to him) was spiked with three (not one) cherry bombs. This set off a huge explosion that knocked Keith to the ground with shrapnel in his arm. Pete, who suffered tinnitus from the second blast, unstrapped the acoustic guitar from Tom Smother’s arm and smashed it to the ground.\n\n“I Can See for Miles”\n\nThe Who’s eighth proper single, the psychedelic anthem “I Can See for Miles,” appeared in the US first on September 19, 1967, on Decca. It’s about a man who claims to have “magic in my eyes,” which allows him to see the Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal from anywhere on clear days. Consequently, he saw the little tricks his girl played when he was far away. Now, she’s “gonna lose that smile.”\n\n“I Can See for Miles” opens on a sizzling low E chord with unrestrained drum fills. On each verse, Roger reveals what he knows amid Townshend’s overdubs (acoustic strum and searing, sitar-like leads) on a three-chord progression (E… G→A) overlaid with cymbal mist. The two-line verse is followed by a slow, harmonized pre-chorus: “I can see for (G) miles and (A) miles and (C) miles and (D) miles and (E) miles….”\n\nA second verse (modulated to A) is followed by a terse, chilling bridge, where Roger tells the lying subject “here’s a poke at you, you’re gonna choke on it too; you’re gonna lose that smile, because all the while,” which opens the proper chorus: a windy two-chord floodgate: “I can see for (D) miles and miles (A), I can see for…” (repeat). After Townshend’s one-note guitar solo (a briskly strummed, low open E string) and a repeat of the main parts, the group crests in G for a harmonized repetition of the words “miles and miles and miles and….” The song fades on a runout of the proper chorus.\n\nThe backing track to “I Can See for Miles” was recorded in May 1967 at CBS Studios in London. The vocals and overdubs were added in August at Talentmasters Studios in New York during a stop on their US tour. The Decca b-side was “Mary Anne with the Shaky Hand,” a three-chord acoustic folk-pop harmony song about a pretty girl who, despite here tremors, fascinates the singer more than his prior dance partners (Linda who cooks, Jean who reads, Cindy who sews).\n\n“I Can See for Miles” reached No. 4 in Canada and No. 9 in the US, where it became their highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100. On October 13, “I Can See for Miles” appeared in the UK (Track) and Europe (Polydor) with a different b-side: Entwistle’s “Someone’s Coming,” a brassy mid-tempo number with tense two-note bass and unrestrained drumming. It concerns forbidden love; the title refers to the subject’s disproving father.\n\nTownshend wrote “I Can See for Miles” a year earlier but saved it for their transatlantic breakout juncture. With its phasing and modulated, elongated chorus, the song remains a radio evergreen and a Who signature.\n\nOn October 22, 1967, The Who played London’s Saville Theatre with American psychsters Vanilla Fudge. They embarked on an eleven-date UK package tour with Traffic, The Herd, Marmalade, and The Tremeloes, playing two nightly shows between October 28 (City Hall, Sheffield) and November 10 (Adelphi, Slough).\n\nThe Who Sell Out\n\nThe Who released their third album, The Who Sell Out, on December 15, 1967, on Track (UK) and Decca (US). It features eleven proper songs, including both sides of their preceding Decca single (“I Can See for Miles,” “Mary-Anne with the Shaky Hand”), plus multiple interludes that mimic advertisements and public service announcements. The tracks are sequenced to resemble a pirate radio broadcast.\n\nThe Who Sell Out opens with a brassy mock radio indent (“Monday… Tuesday…”) followed by “Armenia City in the Sky,” a phased, droning psychedelic rocker with buzzing layered sustain — written and sung by band-friend Speedy King, the vocalist of Track signees Thunderclap Newman.\n\nSide one also contains three Townshend originals: “Tattoo,” “Our Love Was” and the product-themed “Odorono,” a comedic romp about a pretty young hopeful who fails an audition due to body odor. Pete sings “Odorono” and “Tattoo,” an echoey ballad with descending finger-picked chords (mostly in B♭, Fmajor7, and D) and lyrics about two young brothers expressing themselves with tattoos. “Our Love Was” uses similar chords with stormy drumming, vocable bridges, and buzzing guitar breaks.\n\nSide two opens with a mock advert for a Charles Atlas exercise course, which purports to turn each customer into “A BEAST OF A MAN” (spoken by a deep-voiced Entwistle). Townshend sings lead on two further contributions: “I Can’t Reach You,” a mid-tempo piano ballad with a descending chromatic melody (in C major); and “Sunrise,” a sparse, plucked acoustic ballad with virtuoso cadenzas. He harmonizes with Roger on “Relax,” a flowing organ-psych tune.\n\nEntwistle contributed two mock advert shorts (“Heinz Baked Beans,” “Medac”) and “Silas Stingy,” a creeping harmony-psych number with icy cathedral organ and lyrics about an old miser who starves for pennies, wears tattered unwashed clothes and carries bags of money in a heavy black box with a big padlock.\n\nThe Who Sell Out climaxes with “Rael (1 and 2),” the band’s second mini-opera. It begins as a stately organ march in C major that laments the downfall of Rael, the narrator’s spiritual home. Weary of encroachment and the loss of his heritage, the protagonist sets sail. He instructs the captain to return to the same spot on Christmas and check the color of the waving flag: yellow means flee; red means stay. The second movement has a staccato guitar figure (in D) with the chant “He’s crazy if he thinks we’re coming back again,” spoken by the Captain on behalf of his crew. This cuts to an instrumental passage of stormy drums and descending power chords.\n\nOriginal vinyl copies of the album end on a locked runout groove of a crackling vintage gramophone sound: an intended advert for Track Record.\n\nSessions for The Who Sell Out took place in September–October 1967 at multiple London studios (IBC, Pye, De Lane Lea, CBS). Stamp co-produced the album with Lambert, who co-engineered Sell Out with Damon Lyon-Shaw, an emerging soundman who worked on the upcoming albums by Eclection and Pentangle. American musician–producer Al Kooper (then of Blood Sweat & Tears) plays organ on the first half of “Rael.” The jingles were produced by PAMS Productions in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe Who Sell Out is housed in a single sleeve that depicts each member in a mock advertisement for a giant-sized food or hygiene product. The front cover shows Roger in a tub of Heinz Baked Beans and Pete applying a giant container of Odorono. On the back cover, Keith applies a giant tube of Medac to an enlarged pimple and John, clad in a leopard-print toga, caresses a beach blond in one arm and a teddy bear in the other, in emulation of an Atlas ad. Photographer David Montgomery and designers David King and Roger Law also did cover visuals for Track labelmate Jimi Hendrix on his 1967/68 albums Axis: Bold as Love and Electric Ladyland. Law later co-conceived the satirical puppet show Spitting Image.\n\nThe Who Sell Out reached No. 13 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 48 on the Billboard 200. Early Track copies came with a six-fold poster of an upside down conehead character with butterfly wings on brown panels over a checkered background. “I Can See for Miles” was the album’s only single outside Japan, where “Armenia City in the Sky” appeared on a Polydor 7″ (b/w “Mary-Anne with the Shaky Hand”).\n\n1968: Singles\n\n“Call Me Lightning”\n\nOn March 16, 1968, The Who released “Call Me Lightning,” an uptempo surf-rocker with searing psych guitar and a damp bass solo. Its lyrics concern a sly guy with the confidence to approach any girl he fancies. To show his friends “why they call [him] lightning,” he chats up a girl on the dance floor and wows her with talk of his shiny XK-E (the Jaguar E-Type, a sixties British sports car). The song consists of two chords (E→A, later modulated to G→C) with four downbeats per bar. Each line of lyrics is followed by a harmonized “dum dum dum doo day” vocable.\n\n“Call Me Lightning” has a video in which Pete, John, and Roger have sips of tea, then unbox a life-size wind-up toy figure (Keith) who escapes their bounds. A Benny Hill-style chase ensues through an abandoned factory.\n\nEntwistle wrote the b-side, “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” a comedic horror-psych number inspired by the 1886 gothic novella by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson. It opens with a stark, semi-tone chordal shift where John twice cries out “Hyde,” extending the vowels as the song lands on a thundering C major. Roger, in the character of Dr. Jekyll, wonders about the disappearance of his money (first verse) but acknowledges the effects of his potion (second verse) and warns in the third verse “Whenever you’re with me make sure it’s still me; I’ve got to the stage I can’t tell which I’ll be.” Musically, the song persists in nervous 3/4 time with a pensive three-chord progression (EEE–CCC–BBB–E…) amid echoing tremors and irregular downbeats.\n\n“Call Me Lightning” appeared as an a-side in North America, Oceania, Japan, and multiple European territories, but not the UK. It reached the Top 30 in the US, Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands. Lambert produced both sides of the single in January 1968 at IBC.\n\nBetween the single’s completion and release, The Who embarked on a package tour of Australia with Small Faces (performing material from There Are But Four Small Faces) and ex-Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones. The Who performed two shows nightly in Brisbane (1/20/68: Festival Hall), Sydney (1/22–23: Sydney Stadium), Melbourne (1/25–26: Festival Hall), and Adelaide (1/27: Centennial Hall). Amid hostile press and hotel vandalism, The Who were arrested after a midair disturbance and banned from the country by Prime Minister John Gorton. They flew to New Zealand for two nightly shows in Auckland (1/29: Town Hall) and Wellington (1/31: Town Hall) — the last of their efforts in this region.\n\nIn late February, The Who embarked on a six-week tour of North America, where they played three-straight Bay Area shows with jazzman Cannonball Adderly (2/22: Fillmore Auditorium; 2/23–24: Winterland) and two NYC dates with Buddy Guy and jazz-rock pioneers Free Spirits (4/5–6: Fillmore East).\n\n“Dogs”\n\nOn June 14, 1968, The Who released “Dogs,” their ninth proper UK a-side. It’s a medium–uptempo pop song about a couple who meet at the dog track and become happy greyhound parents. Daltrey sings in a Cockney accent on this song, which has a three-chord verse (A→B→A→G) with a vocable melody and a harmonized chorus where the man reveals “There was nothing in my life bigger than beer” before becoming a dog person. Moon plays woodblock throughout the piece, which ends on a spoken-word coda with harmonica played by photographer Chris Morphet, a friend of Townshend’s.\n\n“Dogs” appeared as a single on Track (b/w “Call Me Lightning”) and European Polydor (b/w “Circles”). Lambert produced the song on May 22 at Advision Studios. Entwistle later remarked that “Dogs” would have been better suited for the Small Faces, whose Cockney-accented “Lazy Sunday” (from their 1968 concept album Ogdens’ Nut Gone Flake) bears similar English traits.\n\nThe Who embarked on a summer ’68 North American tour, starting with a June 28–29 engagement at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles with Fleetwood Mac and Track labelmates the Crazy World of Arthur Brown. In Detroit, they played the Grande Ballroom (7/13) with the Frost and the Psychedelic Stooges, who eventually shortened their name to The Stooges. The Who also played the Pop Music Festival, a July 18 event at the Rhode Island Auditorium in Providence with Blood Sweat & Tears (then performing Child Is Father to the Man, their only Kooper-led album). On July 24. The Who played the Philadelphia Music Festival at JFK Stadium with Pink Floyd, The Troggs, and Canadian soul-rockers Mandala.\n\nTownshend and Lambert co-produced the June 1968 Track release The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, which spawned the theatrical transatlantic hit “Fire.”\n\n“Magic Bus”\n\nOn July 27, 1968, The Who released “Magic Bus,” an acoustic rocker (in A) with crisp open chords over the Bo Diddley beat. Roger sings about the daily ride he takes to see his baby, interjected with the harmonized backing line “Too much, magic bus.” His strong desire to buy the bus (“I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it…”) is rebuffed by the driver (Pete), who snaps back “You caaaan’t have it!” Entwistle sticks to the root note on this song, which features heavy use of maracas and claves. In live performances, the song’s loose mid-section allowed for lengthy jam sequences.\n\nTownshend wrote “Magic Bus” in 1965 during recording sessions for My Generation. His 1966 demo was circulated by The Who’s music publicher, Fabulous Music. This led to a 1967 recording of the song by the Decca pop trio Pudding. Lambert produced the Who version on May 29, 1968, at Advision.\n\n“Magic Bus” appeared on UK Track (b/w “Dr Jekyll & Mr. Hyde”), European Polydor (b/w “Bucket T”), and North American Decca (b/w “Someone’s Coming”). The Decca single reached No. 6 in Canada and No. 10 on the US Cash Box Top 100. “Magic Bus” has since become a Who signature and radio evergreen.\n\nIn September 1968, US Decca issued Magic Bus: The Who on Tour, a compilation with the recent hit and stereo versions of two cuts from The Who Sell Out (“I Can’t Reach You,” “Our Love Was, Is”), one from A Quick One (“Run Run Run”), and mono versions of assorted non-album tracks, including two from Read Steady Who (“Disguises,” “Bucket T”) and the standalone sides “Pictures of Lily,” “Doctor, Doctor,” “Someone’s Coming,” “Call Me Lightning,” and “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.”\n\nDespite the title, Magic Bus: The Who on Tour contains no live material. The compilation is housed in a single sleeve that shows John, Roger, and Pete hanging from the outside of a double-deck tour bus with hippie floral art. Keith is seen through the window of the open door from which John straddles outward.\n\nThe Who toured the UK during the final three months of 1968. On October 5, they played the Roundhouse with Blossom Toes and The Fox, a shortplayer psych act with original Yardbirds guitarist Top Topham. On the 18th, The Who played an all-nighter at London’s Lyceum with CWoAB, the Alan Bown Set, Elmer Gantry’s Velvet Opera, Skip Bifferty, and folk newcomers Strawbs.\n\nIn November, The Who headlined multi-act bills with CWoAB, Small Faces, Joe Cocker, and the Mindbenders. Select dates featured newcomers Yes and Tea and Symphony (11/16: Middle Earth, London) and Free (11/17: Birmingham Theatre).\n\nOn December 11, 1968, The Who performed at Intertel Television Studios, Wembley, as part of the Rolling Stones Rock ‘n’ Roll Circus, a multi-act event filmed on a makeshift circus stage for an intended BBC broadcast. The show — which also featured sets by Marianne Faithful, American bluesman Taj Mahal, and newcomers Jethro Tull — went unaired due to the Stones’ dissatisfaction with their performance.\n\nThe Who also performed at ORTF Studios in Paris for the December 31 French TV broadcast “Surprise Partie,” which also featured sets by Small Faces, Booker T and the MGs, Pink Floyd, The Troggs, The Equals, Joe Cocker, Fleetwood Mac, and local beatsters Les Variations.\n\nMeanwhile, Townshend took to the teachings of Indian spiritual master Meher Baba, whose message of love and introspection inspired the concept for the upcoming Who album. This would be a four-sided rock opera: a format that — since The Who’s recent mini-operas — had spawned 1967/68 full-album works by Nirvana (The Story of Simon Simopath), The Pretty Things (S.F. Sorrow), and The Twilights (Once Upon a Twilight).\n\n1969: Rock Opera, Tour, Woodstock\n\nTommy\n\nThe Who released their fourth album, Tommy, on May 17, 1969, on Track and Decca. It chronicles the journey of Tommy, a psychosomatically disabled boy who excels at pinball and achieves guru status.\n\nAccording to a plot synopsis that followed the album’s release, British Army Captain Walker went missing during WWI. Back home, Mrs. Walker gives birth to their son. Captain Walker unexpectedly returns only to catch his wife with another lover, who the irate Captain shoots in front of his young son. Mrs. Walker convinces the boy that he didn’t see or hear what happened. Tommy goes deaf, dumb, and blind and relies on his inner-psyche for senses.\n\nTommy’s parents — weary of his handicaps and inability to comprehend religion — leave him in the hands of abusive relatives (Cousin Kevin, Uncle Ernie) and the Hawker, a fraudulent doctor whose wife, the Acid Queen, introduces Tommy to LSD. As a teenager, Tommy’s heightened sense of vibration allows him to master pinball. His parents suspect his disabilities are psychosomatic rather than physical and place him in front of a mirror, where he stares endlessly at his reflection. When Mrs. Walker smashes the mirror, Tommy regains his senses and starts a spiritual movement.\n\nTommy leads his followers to a religious camp, but they soon abandon his teachings. Dejected, Tommy takes solace in self-reflection.\n\nAt 74:44, Tommy consists of twenty-four numbers — three instrumentals, fourteen proper songs, and seven interlude tracks — across four sides.\n\n“Overture” — Instrumental. Entrance chords, followed by two main themes: “See Me, Feel Me” and “We’re Not Going to Take It.” Vocable variation of “See Me” theme, followed by “Listening to You.” Horn variation of “We’re Not Going to Take It,” followed by “Pinball Wizard” strum, which leads to…\n\n“It’s a Boy” — Finger-picking acoustic number (in D) with outline of Mrs. Walker’s predicament, followed by a folksy guitar solo and the gender reveal.\n\n“1921” — “Overture”-like entrance. Townshend vocals. Jangly verses that anticipate 1921. An argument ensues over which two adults will enjoy ’21 (the fatal struggle is lyrically ambiguous). The harmonized bridge (“You didn’t hear it, You didn’t see it, You won’t say nothing to no-one”) is the part where Tommy goes deaf, dumb, and blind.\n\n“Amazing Journey” — Drop chords (C→G.. A→E.. D→A..) with backward claves. Lyrics detail Tommy’s imagination and enhanced inner-senses. Picks up with windy acoustic strum, crisp bass and hyperactive drum fills.\n\n“Sparks” — E major strum with winding sound. Backward effects. Shift to B heralds the theme to “Rael (Pt. 2)” from The Who Sell Out, which starts in its original key (D), then modulates to B before the song crests in G.\n\n“The Hawker” — Jangly chordal sustain (in E), then plucked, staccato figure (in G minor) with pounding timpani. The hookline (“You talk about your woman, I wish you could see mine”), references the quack doctor’s drug-peddling wife, the Acid Queen, who he claims can give eyesight to the blind.\n\n“Christmas” — Harmonized two-chord verse (“ooos” followed by laughter behind Roger’s vocals). Talks of the boy’s inability to understand the Christmas ceremony (“Tommy doesn’t know what day it is”) and its religious meaning (“How can he be saved?”). Townshend’s terse, repeated utterance of “Tommy can you hear me?” (in G minor) is followed by the first vocal appearance of the “See me, feel me, touch me, heal me” theme.\n\n“Cousin Kevin” — Staccato, two-note figure (I-II-I-II..) over shifting root note (G…F#…). Soft harmonized verses that slowly reveal the true nature of Kevin, a self-proclaimed school bully, who wants to tie Tommy to a chair and duck his head underwater. Backward cymbals over pensive open-cadence bridge.\n\n“The Acid Queen” — Townshend vocals over staccato guitar descent and deep bass. The Hawker’s wife claims she can mend Tommy’s aching heart and make him a man, but also break his heart and tear his soul apart. She wants him for one night, then another.\n\n“Underture” (10:04) — Opens on a variation of “Rael (pt. 2)” theme (in C) with acoustic guitar and cymbal spray. Swells with drums and rattling tambourine on the eight-note bridge. A full exploration of the theme’s nuances with modulations and alternating loud–soft passages.\n\n“Do You Think It’s Alright?” — Interlude where the parents debate whether they should leave Tommy with his iffy uncle Ernie.\n\n“Fiddle About” — Music hall number with French horn. Tommy is now in the care of Ernie, who brags “You won’t shout as I fiddle about.”\n\n“Pinball Wizard” — Uptempo rocker (in B, hammered thirds) with brisk acoustic strumming and raunchy electric power chords. Witnesses marvel at how “that deaf, dumb, and blind kid.. sure plays a mean pinball.” The reigning wizard hands his pinball crown to Tommy. Modulates to C# on final verse. Electric picking fadeout.\n\n“There’s a Doctor” — Piano-thumping music hall interlude about a nearby doctor.\n\n“Go to the Mirror!” — Three-chord riff (FFFFF…C→B♭) with the doctor’s diagnosis: Tommy is unreceptive but his pupils dilate under light. Townshend sings the second vocal occurrence of the “See me, feel me, touch me, heal me” theme. Second verse→theme repeat→third verse. The doctor orders Tommy to “Go to the mirror, boy!” Expressing wonder over what is happening in Tommy’s head, the band sings the first vocal occurrence of “Listening to You.”\n\n“Tommy Can You Hear Me?” — Acoustic harmony interlude, descending from G major (hammered thirds), landing on D for repetitions of the boy’s name.\n\n“Smash the Mirror” — Blues rock interlude with pile-driving drums and belted vocals. After “rise… rise… rise…” bridge, Mrs. Walker smashes the mirror in front of Tommy.\n\n“Sensation” — Flowing track (in D) with crisp acoustic guitar, Townshend vocals, and French horn refrain (in descending C). Tommy recovers his senses and feels overwhelmed by the newfound sensations. He uses his pre-established fame and his miracle cure to marshal followers.\n\n“Miracle Cure” — News alert about Tommy’s restored ability to see, hear, and speak.\n\n“Sally Simpson” — Finger-picking folk tune with barroom piano about Tommy’s groupie. Despite her and Tommy being “worlds apart,” she runs away from home to meet him at a worship event. She rushes the stage during his sermon but a guard throws her off and she lands on her face, requiring sixteen stitches. Tommy, surrounded by stage lights, only knows that the “crowd went crazy.” Years onward, the scar on her cheek reminds her of Tommy’s smile.\n\n“I’m Free” — Syncopated uptempo guitar–piano number with ascending pattern (EE→GG→AAA) that modulates a step (to F#). Soft airy vocals start on the chorus, intercut by windy, harmonized refrains (“And I’m waiting for you to follow me”). Only one verse (“no one had the guts to leave the temple”). Crests in D for acoustic fingerpicked middle-eight. Coda: “How can we follow” over reprised “Pinball Wizard” strum.\n\n“Welcome” — Acoustic ballad in 3/4 (in G). “Come to this house” is an invitation for new commune members. Brisk 6/4 pattern (in E). Tense passage (“There’s more at the door”) indicates the Walker home is getting overcrowded with Tommy’s devotees.\n\n“Tommy’s Holiday Camp” — Vaudeville interlude with circus organ theme.\n\n“We’re Not Gonna Take It” — Flowing intro (in G) opens with “Welcome to the camp.” Tommy lays the commune ground rules (“You’ve got to play pinball”). Followers start whispering “We’re not going to take it.” They open up about their opposition (“Going to break it, going to shake it..”). Tommy continues to preach the gospel (“Here comes uncle Ernie to guide you to your very own machine”). Followers restate “We’re not gonna take it,” then add “We forsake you, going to rape you, let’s forget you better still.” Abandoned by his followers, Tommy sings “See me, feel me, touch me, heal me” four times over a slow, soft piano–vocable backdrop. The full band harmonizes the “Listening to you” lyrics over a flowing, ascending open cadence with splashing cymbals and swelling organ.\n\nThe Who started work on Tommy on September 19, 1968, at IBC. The album initially had no central plot or finalized name. After several working titles (Amazing Journey, Journey into Space, The Brain Opera) Townshend settled on Tommy because it was a common British name. The album’s plot grew out of “Amazing Journey,” a summary number. Lambert wrote a script, Tommy (1914–1984), which brought focus to the project, which evolved into a double-album with an overture and narrative numbers. Sessions wrapped on March 7, 1969.\n\nTommy features Townshend on the Gibson J-200 acoustic and the Gibson SG solid-body electric. He also plays organ and piano: two instruments he recently learned that broadened his compositional syntax. Lambert produced Tommy, which Lyon-Shaw engineered in succession with titles by Pentangle and The Factory.\n\nTommy is housed in a tri-fold cover that depicts a spherical mesh of blue sky and seagulls, inter-cut with black space. The sphere fades into the dark, where seagulls swarm the edges and a fist punches out through the dark void. The inner triptych depicts a hand reaching up at vintage wall lights (left) on a wall that turns dark (center). The hand reappears in the dark before a seagull-flanked set of stain-glass windows (right). Original copies contain a twelve-page booklet with lyrics and a visual libretto of the blind boy’s impressions, which include images of obscured reflections, cracked silhouettes and magicians in the dark.\n\nThe artwork, by illustrator Mike McInnerney, is a visual representation of Tommy’s sense of the world. McInnerney, a fellow follower of Meher Baba, noticed the guru’s influence on the Tommy concept. At Polydor’s insistence, images of the four Who members were added to the black holes on the front cover. Later CD issues omit this detail. McInnerney also did the artwork to Breathe Awhile, the 1969 singular album by Arcadium.\n\nTommy reached No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 4 on the Billboard 200. The album spawned three singles: (b/w “Dogs (Part Two)”),\n\nTommy Tour\n\nThe Who made sporadic appearances on the UK club circuit in the winter–spring of 1969 as sessions wrapped on Tommy. On April 2, they headlined the Rag Ball at the Pavilion Ballrooms in Bournemouth, supported by the Third Ear Band. Meanwhile, Townshend helped Speedy King assemble Thunderclap Newman, which signed with Track and cut their first single, “Something In the Air.” Townshend, under the pseudonym Bijou Drains, produced and played bass on the single and their ensuing album, Hollywood Dream.\n\nAfter a round of warm-up shows in Scotland, The Who played a private showcase of Tommy before invited press at Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club on May 1 and 2, 1969. The Who performed Tommy a total of 187 times over the next nineteen months across North America and Europe. Daltrey now sported long, curly hair and open fringe jackets.\n\nThe Who launched the first leg of the Tommy tour with a three-night engagement (May 9–11) at Detroit’s Grande Ballroom. They performed three-fourths of the album, omitting “Overture,” “Cousin Kevin,” “Underture,” “Sensation,” “Sally Simpson,” and “Welcome.” Their setlist also included “Happy Jack,” “A Quick One, While He’s Away,” “My Generation,” “Magic Bus,” plus “Summertime Blues,” and the Mose Allison standard “Young Man Blues.” Performances of “My Generation” often broke into lengthy jam sections where they interpolated themes from Tommy.\n\nThe first North American leg covered Toronto and eleven US cities with multi-night engagements in Boston, Chicago, New York, and San Francisco. They played twenty-four dates total with two nightly shows in NYC and SF. Opening acts included Led Zeppelin (5/25/69: Merriweather Post Pavilion, Columbia, Md.), Buddy Rich & His Orchestra (5/29–31: Kinetic Playground, Chicago), Bonzo Dog Band (6/13: Palladium, Hollywood), and Woody Herman (6/17–19: Fillmore West).\n\nThe Who commenced the second leg of Tommy at London’s Royal Albert Hall, where they played two shows on July 5 as part of a running event dubbed Pop Proms 2. They covered nine UK cities through August 9, culminating with an appearance at Plumpton Racecourse as part of the 9th National Jazz and Blues Festival, which also featured sets by Aynsley Dunbar, Blodwyn Pig, Chicken Shack, Circus, East of Eden, Fat Mattress, Groundhogs, Hard Meat, The Idle Race, Jigsaw, Keef Hartley Band, Keith Tippett, Magna Carta, The Nice, Pentangle, Roy Harper, Soft Machine, Steamhammer, and Wallace Collection. A breakout act that weekend was King Crimson, whose debut album (In the Court of the Crimson King) Townshend declared “an uncanny masterpiece” in his advance review.\n\nThe Who paused the tour and flew to New York state, where they appeared at Max Yasgur’s Farm in Bethel: the site of the Woodstock Festival, a four-day event with thirty-two acts, including Crosby, Stills & Nash, Incredible String Band, Mountain, Quill, Santana, and Ten Years After. The Who took the stage at 5:00 am on August 17, between sets by Sly & the Family Stone and the Jefferson Airplane. They were briefly interrupted by Yippie activist Abby Hoffman, who ranted about imprisoned poet and MC5 manager John Sinclair before Townshend booted him off stage.\n\nThe Who resumed their UK tour with seven further dates, including an August 30 appearance at the second annual Isle of Wight Festival, which also featured sets by the Battered Ornaments, Blonde on Blonde, Edgar Broughton Band, Eclection, Family, Gary Farr, Free, Gypsy, Heaven, Marsha Hunt, Marsupilami, Mighty Baby, The Moody Blues, and numerous acts from the Plumpton event. The Who wrapped leg two of Tommy on September 29 at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.\n\nOn October 5, The Who launched the third leg of the Tommy tour with thirty North American stops, including shows in Boston with The Flock (10/10: Commonwealth Armory) and Tony Williams Lifetime (11/11–12: The Boston Tea Party). On October 31, The Who played Chicago’s Kinetic Playground with The Kinks, who performed material from their newly released rock opera Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). The Kinks had just overcome a musician’s union ban that prevented them from touring the states.\n\nThe Who commenced the fourth leg of Tommy on December 4 at the Hippodrome in Bristol. They played five shows that month, breaking for the holidays after a Dec. 9 set at City Hall in Newcastle.\n\n1970: New Material, Live Album, Tommy Shows\n\n“The Seeker”\n\nOn March 21, 1970, The Who released “The Seeker,” a mid-tempo hard rocker (in A) with ironic lyrics about a ruthless, insatiable character. As he copes with misanthropy (“People tend to hate me ’cause I never smile; as I ransack their homes, they want to shake my hand”) and disillusionment (“I asked Bobby Dylan, I asked The Beatles, I asked Timothy Leary, but he couldn’t help me either”), he concludes that satisfaction equals death: a sentiment stated in a two-chord crescendo (“I won’t get to get what I’m after, till the day I die”).\n\nThe Who recorded and self-produced “The Seeker” in January 1970 at IBC. It features piano by Nicky Hopkins, who played on the Rolling Stones’ recent album Let It Bleed. Daltrey wrote the b-side, “Here for More,” a rustic-rock song about freewheeling that opens with strummed acoustic power chords and precedes with finger-picked, countryfied verses (in B).\n\n“The Seeker” went Top 20 in the UK, Netherlands, Austria, and Germany. The Who performed it sporadically during 1970. Between the single’s completion and release, they resumed Tommy performances on the Continent with January shows in Paris, Copenhagen, Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin, and Amsterdam.\n\nTownshend included a demo version of “The Seeker” on Happy Birthday, a tribute album to his recently deceased guru Meher Baba (1894–1969). The album features raw acoustic demos of the Baba-inspired numbers “Content,” “Mary Jane,” “The Love Man,” “Begin the Beguine,” and “Evolution,” a bluegrass duet with Small Faces co-leader Ronnie Lane. Happy Birthday appeared in a limited quantity (roughly 2.5k copies) in February 1970 on Pete’s Universal Spiritual League imprint.\n\nLive at Leeds\n\nThe Who continued their fourth leg of Tommy with mid-February shows in Leeds (2/14/70: Leeds University Refectory) and Kingston upon Hull (2/15: City Hall). Their setlist now included “Overture,” “Sally Simpson,” and a new Entwistle number, “Heaven and Hell.” They also performed covers of Allen Toussaint (“Fortune Teller,” covered earlier by The Rolling Stones) and early UK rockers Johnny Kidd & the Pirates (“Shaking All Over,” a 1965 North American hit for Canadian rockers The Guess Who).\n\nThe tour resumed on April 18 in Leicester. May stops included dates with Jan Dukes de Grey (5/9: Manchester University) and Quintessence (5/15: Lancaster University). The Who wrapped leg four of Tommy on May 16 at Derwent College in York.\n\nOn May 23, 1970, The Who released Live at Leeds, a 37:43 document of their February 14 show at Leeds Uni. Side one (15:06) contains “Substitute” and three covers (“Summertime Blues,” “Young Man Blues,” “Shakin’ All Over”). Side two (22:37) features elongated renditions of “My Generation” (14:47) and “Magic Bus” (7:50). The performance is characterized by thundering volume; achieved by the band’s Hiwatt CP-103 amplification system.\n\nLive at Leeds appeared on Track (UK), Polydor (Europe, Oceania), and Decca (North America). Original copies appear in a stamped manila fold-out cover designed to resemble a bootleg. The inner-spread contains two folders: one with the record and one with assorted mementos, including a 1965 promo photo and hand-written lyric sheets for select songs. In 1980, MCA reissued the album in a conventional sleeve. Later CD versions restore the entire Leeds show with “Heaven and Hell,” all of Tommy, and select earlier staples (“A Quick One,” “Happy Jack,” “Tattoo,” “I Can’t Explain”).\n\nLive at Leeds reached No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 4 on the Billboard 200. “Summertime Blues” was lifted as a single, backed with the otherwise unavailable “Heaven and Hell.”\n\nThe Who embarked on their fifth leg of Tommy with a third round of US dates, starting with an afternoon and evening show on June 7 at Manhattan’s Metropolitan Opera House. On June 9, they played Denver’s Mammoth Gardens with Sugarloaf, then in the chart with “Green Eyed Lady.” After a round of dates in California and Texas, they played the Philly Spectrum with the James Gang, an Ohio powertrio that befriended The Who. The two acts did further double-bills that summer, including a July 5 show at Detriot’s Cobo Hall where the James Gang played material from their just-released second album Rides Again. The fifth leg wrapped on June 7 at the Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass., where The Who appeared with It’s a Beautiful Day and Jethro Tull, who performed songs from their recent third album Benefit.\n\nThe sixth and final leg of Tommy commenced on July 25 at Dunstable Civic Hall. The Who did seven Continental dates and twenty-five shows across the UK, including the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, which also featured sets by Black Widow, Cactus, Chicago, Donovan, Fairfield Parlour, Gracious!, Hawkwind, Lighthouse, Miles Davis, Pink Fairies, Procol Harum, Spirit, Supertramp, T2, Taste, Terry Reid, and The Voices of East Harlem. The Who appeared on day four (Saturday the 29th) along with The Doors, Joni Mitchell, Shawn Phillips, and Emerson Lake & Palmer, who did their second-ever performance that day.\n\nThe Who’s set — later released on the Columbia–Legacy CD Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 — included three new songs: “I Don’t Even Know Myself,” “Water,” and “Naked Eye,” a song that evolved from the improvised jams during “My Generation.” That summer, The Who recorded all three songs for an intended EP with two additional numbers: “Postcard” and “Now I’m a Farmer.” The live rendition of “Water” is an extended version (10:53) of the six-minute studio track: a loose, riff-laden jam (in F#) with pauses, solos, climactic velocity, and vocal caterwauling by Daltrey, whose style had shifted from his mannered sixties croon to the raspier tone of subsequent work.\n\nThe Who did their final performance of the Tommy tour on December 20, 1970, at the Roundhouse. After nearly 200 performances, they intended to retire Tommy from the road and pass it onto other mediums, including a proposed film adaptation. However, Townshend rejected Lambert’s Tommy script. As that project went on hold, Pete started work on a new concept inspired by the euphoria he witnessed among Tommy concert attendees.\n\nMeanwhile, Moon appeared in Frank Zappa‘s surreal musical film 200 Motels and John Entwistle recorded his debut solo album, Smash Your Head Against the Wall, released in May 1971 on Track. John plays keyboards, flugelhorn, trumpet, and trombone in addition to bass on the album, which features his version of “Heaven and Hell” and eight further numbers, including “Pick Me Up (Big Chicken),” “You’re Mine,” and “What Are We Doing Here?” The guitarist, Dave “Cyrano” Langston, was a Who roadie who later worked as a soundman for Three Man Army and the Sensational Alex Harvey Band. Moon plays Latin percussion on “No. 29 (External Youth)” along with members of the Bonzo Dog Band.\n\n1971: Lifehouse, Who’s Next\n\nLifehouse\n\nTownshend’s new work involved an interactive concert where synthesizers would read the biographical data of audience members. This data would translate to musical vibrations, which would form a universal cord (the One Note) that would send each attendee into an eternal state of out-of-body euphoria.\n\nThe story takes place in the distant future where rock music has been memory holed and pollution has confined most of the world’s population indoors, where people dawn lifesuits that connect to a central Grid (controlled by Jumbo). Lifesuits simulate all forms of human experience with a combination of body sensors and feeding tubes.\n\nBobby, a character who rediscovers 20th century rock music, hacks into the Grid and announces his rediscovery to the world. (Bobby was the concept’s initial working title.) He creates the Lifehouse, a concert hall where attendees can shed their lifesuits and feed their vibrations into the music, which will then create the One Note that will transport everyone to a metaphysical higher existence.\n\nThe Lifehouse story is told through the eyes of Ray, a patriarch who cultivates food for the lifesuited masses from a farm in Northern Scotland, outside the pollution’s range. His daughter, Mary, runs away to attend the concert. Ray sets out in search of his missing daughter but encounters his younger self, Rayboy.\n\nThe concert takes place at the Lifehouse, where thousands attend and millions more tune in via lifesuits. Attendees enter their vital signs into the concert machines, which turn the vibrations into musical notes that create songs. Just as everyone’s vitals are read, Jumbo’s forces descend on the Lifehouse to stop the concert and kill Bobby. However, everyone has already disappeared — presumably having vanished to an eternal life of One Note euphoria.\n\nTownshend wrote about twenty songs for the Lifehouse project between late 1970 and early 1971, starting with “Pure and Easy,” which lays out the One Note principle. Unlike Tommy, which presented a song-by-song narrative, Lifehouse would have individual pieces that would each invoke fragments of the story, which would then be elucidated by an accompanying movie.\n\nOverall, Lifehouse was planned as a double-album rock opera, a movie, and an interactive concert. The movie would have plot-driven content of the Ray, Mary, and Bobby characters interspersed with actual Who concert footage from a series of Lifehouse concerts. Townshend’s ideas were inspired by Meher Baba, who claimed to be an avatar of Brahman; and Sufi musician Inayat Khan (1882–1927), who spoke of correlations between human souls, physical vibrations, and musical sounds.\n\nOn January 4, 1971, The Who held a concert at the Young Vic Theatre in London, where they intended to create music with the audience, whose vitals — when entered into Townshend’s new VCS3 and ARP synthesizers — would generate tones that would add to the songs in progress. They booked Vic for an ongoing series of Lifehouse interactive concerts on February 14–15, 22, and March 1 before exclusive audiences of press and fan club members.\n\nLifehouse proved untenable on multiple fronts. The Who couldn’t make ongoing use of the Vic, which had other pre-booked events. Attendees, desiring the band’s standard live routine, were unresponsive to the interactive feature. Daltrey and Entwistle couldn’t quite fathom the Lifehouse concept; John believed the plan was for the Who and their audience to live as a commune at the Vic. Plot features like the Grid (a precursor to the internet), lifesuits (a precursor to virtual reality), and people living their lives entirely indoors (a foreshadow of COVID lockdowns) were unimaginable in 1971.\n\nLambert — who typically explained Pete’s concepts and mediated confusion between the other parties involved — was away in New York as the project got underway. Townshend’s inability to communicate the concept to those around him led him to the brink of a nervous breakdown.\n\nThe Who decided to scrap Lifehouse as a multi-media project and focus on the proposed double-album, which had a side devoted to each main character.\n\nSide 1 (Ray’s story) — “Teenage Wasteland” (a ballad inspired by the littered grounds of Woodstock), “Going Mobile” (about freewheeling, off-the-Grid mobile life), “Baba O’Riley” (a rocker that grew from the chorus line of “Teenage Wasteland”), “Love Ain’t for Keeping” (a country-rock ballad about living for the moment), and “Time Is Passing.”\n\nSide 2 (Mary/Jumbo’s story) — “Bargain” (an epic rocker about spiritual devotion with the Baba quote “I’d gladly lose me to find you”), “Behind Blue Eyes” (Jumbo’s theme, a two-part song about his public scorn and high self-image), “Too Much of Anything,” “Greyhound Girl,” and “Mary” (both Townshend demos).\n\nSide 3 (Bobby’s story) — “Getting in Tune” (about the difficulties of balancing rock stardom with spirituality), “I Don’t Even Know Myself,” “Pure and Easy,” and “Let’s See Action (Nothing is Everything).”\n\nSide 4 (The Lifehouse Concert) — “Won’t Get Fooled Again” (a rock anthem that rebukes the power of revolution with the line “Meet the new boss; same as the old boss”) and “The Song Is Over” (a piano-laden power ballad with the triumphant line “I sing my song to the free”).\n\nLambert summoned The Who to New York’s Record Plant Studios, where they recorded songs for their proposed album with added musicianship by organist Al Kooper, Mountain guitarist Leslie West, and jazz pianist Ken Ascher. James Gang frontman Joe Walsh gifted Townshend with a 1959 Gretsch Chet Atkins guitar, Pete’s instrument of choice on the ensuing album.\n\nThe Record Plant sessions proved troublesome as relations soured between Townshend and Lambert. The Who returned to England for two further Vic showcases on April 26 and May 5. They entered Olympic Studios in Barns with producer–engineer Glyn Johns to rerecord their upcoming album. At Johns’ encouragement, they trimmed the project to a single album, omitting “Teenage Wasteland,” “Time Is Passing,” “Too Much of Anything,” “Greyhound Girl,” “Mary,” “I Don’t Even Know Myself,” “Pure and Easy,” and “Let’s See Action (Nothing is Everything).”\n\nAfter the Olympic sessions wrapped in June, The Who played seven July UK shows and flew stateside for a twelve-city tour, starting with shows on the 29th and 31st at the Forest Hills Tennis Stadium in New York City.\n\nWho’s Next\n\nThe Who released their fifth studio album, Who’s Next, on August 14, 1971, on Track and Decca. It features eight songs from the aborted Lifehouse project: “Baba O’Riley,” “Bargain,” “Love Ain’t for Keeping,” “The Song Is Over,” “Getting in Tune,” “Going Mobile,” “Behind Blue Eyes,” and “Won’t Get Fooled Again.” Entwistle’s “My Wife,” an unrelated number intended for his next solo album, was added to the tracklist late in the sessions.\n\n“Baba O’Riley” opens with an arpeggiated ostinato created with a looped marimba effect on the Lowrey Berkshire Deluxe TBO-1 organ — a modal movement inspired by A Rainbow In Curved Air, a pioneering electronic work by American minimalist composer Terry Riley. The song’s title combines the surnames of Meher Baba and Riley. At Moon’s suggestion, The Who invited East of Eden violinist Dave Arbus to play the climactic solo.\n\nEntwistle handles piano and brass in addition to bass and vocals on “My Wife,” an exaggerated account of a recent domestic argument. Townshend sings lead on “Going Mobile.” Both songs were recorded by Pete, John, and Keith as a powertrio, minus Daltrey. Hopkins plays guest piano on “The Song Is Over” and “Getting in Tune.”\n\nJohns co-produced and engineered Who’s Next in succession with albums by Ben Sidran, Boz Scaggs, Faces, Humble Pie, and McGuinness Flint. Rock photographer Ethan Russell photographed the album’s cover, which shows the Who spread about beside a urine-marked monolith on a spoil heap in Easington Colliery. The back cover shows the disheveled group slumped at a table in a ransacked backstage room inside De Montfort Hall in Leicester. Russell’s photography also appears on albums by Spooky Tooth (Spooky Two), Mary Hopkin, Jonathan Kelly, and the Beatles swan song Let It Be.\n\nWho’s Next reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, No. 2 on the French and Dutch charts, No. 3 in Denmark, No. 6 in Norway, and No. 9 in Finland. In North America, it reached No. 5 in Canada and No. 4 on the Billboard 200 in the US, where the album has been certified triple-Platinum by the RIAA.\n\n“Let’s See Action”\n\nThe release of Who’s Next coincided with an August 1971 US tour that covered eleven cities in the Northeast and Midwest, including two-nighters in Boston (8/4–7/71: Music Hall) and Chicago (8/17–19: Auditorium Theater).\n\nOn September 18, The Who appeared at the Oval cricket ground in South London as part of “Goodbye to Summer: a rock concert in aid of famine relief of Bangla Desh.” The event — which also featured sets by Faces, Mott the Hoople, America, Lindisfarne, and Quintessence — was an English response to the prior month’s Concert for Bangladesh, a charitable event at Madison Square Garden arranged by George Harrison. Moon attended the Madison event’s after-party, where he demolished a drum kit that belonged to Mike Gibbins of Badfinger.\n\nOn October 15, 1971, The Who released “Let’s See Action,” a barroom piano-pop song (in C#) with shouted chorus lines (by Roger) and a reflective, acoustic middle (sung by Pete) with soul-searching lyrics. Johns co-produced this recording during the Who’s Next sessions. Townshend’s lengthier Lifeshouse demo of the song, titled “Nothing Is Everything (Let’s See Action),” would appear on his first solo album.\n\nThe single’s Entwistle b-side, “When I Was a Boy,” opens with a descending, horn-laden piano motif (in C) and bursts into a gruff mid-tempo rock arrangement with unrestrained drumming. The lyrics deal with adult reflection on lost youth and inaction regret. “Let’s See Action” reached No. 16 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe Who embarked on a fifteen-city tour of the UK, starting on September 28 at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester and climaxing with a three-nighter at London’s Rainbow (November 4–6), followed by a Nov. 9 show at Green’s Playhouse in Glasgow.\n\nIn late October, Track–Polydor issued Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy, a compilation of The Who’s popular 1965–70 single a-sides, plus the Entwistle signature “Boris the Spider.” The comp is titled after the four members: Meaty (Roger, who was fit), Beaty (Keith, the wild drummer), Big (John, because of his stature), and Bouncy (Pete, the acrobatic performer). The cover, by photographer Graham Hughes (Daltrey’s cousin), shows the modern-day Who (in color) peaking out the window of a brick tenement to a vintage monochrome shot of four young boys (child equivalents of the band) posed Our Gang style on the entrance stairway. Meaty Beaty reached No. 9 in the UK and No. 11 on the Billboard 200.\n\nThe Who promoted both Who’s Next and Meaty Beaty with a fifteen-city US tour that included two-night stands in Miami (11/25–26: Convention Hall), New Orleans (11/29–30: Warehouse), Denver (12/4–5: Denver Coliseum), and San Francisco (12/12–13: Civic Auditorium). The tour wrapped on December 15, 1971, at the Seattle Center Coliseum.\n\n1972: Singles, Lost Album, Tommy Orchestra\n\n“Join Together”\n\nOn June 6, 1972, The Who released “Join Together,” a belted mid-tempo rocker (in F) with a distinct jawharp drone and unity-themed lyrics (“We want you to joiiiiin together with the band”) tied to the Lifehouse concept (specifically, the story’s interactive concert scene). It reached No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the promo video, the band mime on a soundstage before a TOTP-like audience, which Roger joins for the final verse. Moon and Entwistle take turns miming the jawharp (performed on record by Townshend). The single’s b-side is a December 1971 live cover of “Baby Don’t You Do It,” a 1964 Marvin Gaye hit written by Holland–Dozier–Holland.\n\nTownshend wrote “Join Together” and two additional new Lifehouse-inspired songs, “Relay” and “Put the Money Down,” at Daltrey’s suggestion. They recorded the first two songs in one day (May 22) at Olympic Studios. A backing track was laid for the third, which remained unfinished until 1974.\n\nMeanwhile, John Entwistle recorded his second solo album, Whistle Rymes, another collection of black-humored rock with titles like “Apron Strings,” “I Wonder,” “The Window Shopper,” “I Found Out,” and the horror epic “Nightmare (Please Wake Me Up).” He plays an assortment of instruments (including bass synthesizer) with eight backing players, including Peter Frampton, violinist John Weider (Family, Stud), drummer Rod Coombes (Stealers Wheel), and guitarist Alan Ross.\n\nRock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!\n\nIn May–June 1972, The Who recorded “Long Live Rock,” an uptempo Berry-esque rocker (in A) about showtime hi-jinks, purportedly based on events at London’s Rainbow Theatre. Each chorus counters “Rock is dead, they say” with the titular line. Midway, they slip to despair (“Rock is dead… rock is dead…”) but renew their vigor for a final go-round.\n\n“Long Live Rock” was the intended theme song to Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!, a proposed Who album with a biographical arc. Nine songs were earmarked for the album, including the three new Lifehouse numbers and three songs (“Get Inside,” “Riot In the Female Jail,” “Can’t You See I’m Easy”) that Townshend presented as demos. The proposed album was set to accompany a TV documentary on the band’s history. However, they deemed its collective contents too similar to Who’s Next to act as a worthy followup.\n\n“Long Live Rock” went unreleased for the time being but the song is sung by Stormy Tempest, a fictional pre-Beatles rocker played by actual fifties singer Billy Fury in That’ll Be the Day, a 1973 coming-of-age drama starring David Essex and Ringo Starr. Moon appears as JD Clover, Tempest’s drummer.\n\nOn August 11, 1972, The Who embarked on a sixteen-city Continental tour in Frankfurt. They played five shows in Germany, including one at the Deutsches Museum in Munich on September 4 — one day before the hostage crisis at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich that ended with the deaths of twelve Israeli athletes. The Who also played two shows each in Denmark, France, and Sweden and a show apiece in Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, and Switzerland. The tour finished on September 14 at the Palasport in Rome, Italy.\n\nTommy (London Symphony Orchestra album)\n\nIn October 1972, Ode Records released Tommy, an arrangement of the 1969 album by the London Symphony Orchestra and Chambre Choir, conducted by David Measham. It presents the opera in an orchestral-rock setting with a variety of vocalists enacting different characters in the story’s plot. Rod Stewart was initially tapped as the main singer but as the project developed his part was confined to one song, “Pinball Wizard.” Assorted Who members appear on half the tracks, which follow the original album’s sequence.\n\nTownshend narrates Tommy, which features Daltrey as Tommy; Maggie Bell (Stone the Crows) as his mother; Graham Bell (no relation — Every Which Way, Bell + Arc) as her lover; Steve Winwood as the missing father; Merry Clayton as the Acid Queen; Entwistle as Cousin Kevin; Ringo Starr as Uncle Ernie; Richard Harris as the Doctor; Richie Havens as the Hawker; and Stewart as the local lad who touts Tommy’s pinball skills. Most of the tracks have one featured vocalist with the Chambre Choir. Daltrey sings “I’m Free,” “Sensation,” “Welcome,” “We’re Not Gonna Take It,” “See Me, Feel Me,” and interacts with Winwood on “Christmas.”\n\nTommy was produced by Lou Reizner and engineered by Keith Grant with arrangements by Wil Malone, an Orange Bicycle alumnus who later did arrangements on the sci-fi concept album by the Passport Records all-star project Intergalactic Touring Band.\n\nTommy is housed in an elaborate package designed by Wilkes & Braun Inc. The two-record set comes in a gatefold sleeve, housed inside a box with a 28-page 11″x11″ booklet of color illustrations and photographs, including multiple images with a pinball machine in assorted outdoor settings with a nearby hovering pinball orb. The vertical gatefold depicts a colorful vintage pinball machine for a game named Tommy. The inner-gates show four stainless steel pinballs on a striped surface; two appear as closeups on the box. The booklet’s front and back leaves show two heterochromatic pinball orbs side-by-side — this image is used as the front cover on CD reissues. The artwork won the Grammy for Best Album Package at the 16th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nTommy reached No. 4 in Australia and No. 5 on the Billboard 200.\n\nIn November 1972, Pete Townshend released Who Came First, his first proper solo album. It features the Lifehouse demos “Pure and Easy” (edit), “Time Is Passing,” and the extended “Nothing Is Everything (Let’s See Action),” plus two songs from Happy Birthday: “Content” and “Evolution,” a reworked version of “Stone” from the debut Faces album First Step. The album also contains the folksy “Sheritan Gibson” and the epic “Parvardigar,” which appeared months earlier on I Am, a second Baba-tribute album with a contribution from Billy Nicholls, “Forever’s No Time at All,” that also appears here. Townshend plays all the instruments on Who Came First apart from the Lane and Nichols tracks.\n\n“Relay”\n\nOn November 25, 1972, The Who released “Relay” on MCA in the US. It’s a mid-tempo funk-rocker (in F) with play–pause drumming and processed Clavinet–wah-wah sounds: achieved on an ARP-2600 through a voltage-control filter. The lyrics concern a call-to-action over the Grid. “Relay” appeared in late December on Track in the UK, where it reached No. 21.\n\nThe b-side, “Waspman,” is a Moon-written number with no lyrics apart from garbled titular chants. It’s a three-chord rocker (D#…B–F#) with wailing harmonica and bug noises. Moon conceived the number during a turbulent flight where — after some mile-high shenanigans with the stewardess — he emerged from the bathroom with a bra on his head stating “I’m Wasp Man.” He dedicated the track to fifties instrumental rocker Link Wray.\n\nAs “Relay” neared release, John Entwistle recorded his third solo album, Rigor Mortis Sets In, a mix of pre-Beatles rock covers and originals, including a solo rendition of “My Wife.” He’s backed on the album by Ross and keyboardist Tony Ashton (of Ashton, Gardner & Dyke). The album appeared in May 1973 on Track.\n\n1973: Daltrey Solo, Quadrophenia, Tour\n\nDaltrey\n\nIn January–February 1973, Roger Daltrey recorded his first solo album at his home studio in Burwash, East Sussex. It features ten songs composed by pianist David Courtney; two with lyrics by fifties teen idol Adam Faith and eight by Leo Sayer, an emerging talent who soon landed his own deal.\n\nDaltrey appeared in April 1973 on Track–MCA with backing by bassist Dave Wintour (IF), steel guitarist BJ Cole (Cochise), and two members of Argent: guitarist Russ Ballard and drummer Bob Henrit. Dave Arbus plays violin on “The Way of the World.” The album spawned three singles: “One Man Band,” “Giving It All Away” (both rerecorded by Sayer on his 1974 second album Just a Boy), and “Thinking,” which has a non-album b-side (“There Is Love”) with guitar by Jimmy Page. Daltrey’s cousin, Graham Hughes, photographed and designed the cover.\n\nDaltrey reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. “Giving It All Away,” a melodramatic ballad with the poignant chorus “I was just a boy giving it all away…,” reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nSecond Rock Opera\n\nOn March 10, 1973, The Who played Pop Gala ’73, a two-day event at Vliegermolen, Voorburg, Netherlands, with sets by Argent, Billy Preston, Colin Blunstone, Chi Coltrane, Rory Gallagher, Slade, Supersister, and Wishbone Ash. The Who appeared as a last-minute replacement for Roxy Music, who were preparing the release of their second album For Your Pleasure.\n\nAs progress stalled on the Tommy film or any realization of the Lifehouse concept, Townshend conceived a new rock opera that would stand on its own as a double-album. His new idea stemmed from the biographical aspects of the aborted Long Live Rock album TV documentary. It would relate to The Who’s early history, as seen through the eyes of a young fan with his own personal struggles.\n\nTownshend drew inspiration from one Jack Lyons, an early Who follower on the mid-sixties mod scene. Combining Jack’s character with several other fans, Townshend developed a story about double-schizophrenia: “quadrophenia,” a portmanteau of quadraphonic (the world’s then newly advanced four-channel sound systems) and schizophrenia. Each Who member would be assigned one of the central character’s four personalities. Two completed songs from the aborted 1972 sessions for Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock! — the twangy, laidback harmony rocker “Is It In My Head?” and the rousing orchestral anthem “Love, Reign o’er Me” — were retained for the new album.\n\nQuadrophenia\n\nThe Who released their sixth studio album, Quadrophenia, on October 23, 1973, on Track and MCA. It features seventeen songs that chronicle the exploits of Jimmy, a Brighton teenager with psychological issues who takes refuge in stimulants and mod culture. As he copes with home tensions and menial labor, disillusionment takes hold when he loses his girlfriend and discovers that his role model (the Ace Face) works as a hotel bell boy. Convinced that his feelings are beyond ordinary madness (schizophrenia), he rides his scooter to a seaside rock for an act of glory. His ultimate fate remains ambiguous.\n\nQuadrophenia is the second of two studio double-albums by The Who and their second completed character-driven “rock opera” after Tommy and the unfinished Lifehouse. Musically, Quadrophenia advances the hi-tech arrangements of the Lifehouse numbers with tighter themes and a more direct narrative with fully realized compositions. Each member has a musical theme assigned to specific vocals tracks. These themes are first woven into the title instrumental and reprised later in “The Rock.”\n\n“I Am the Sea” — Ocean waves rescind to sparkling piano, wind, rain, and thunder. John’s French horn sounds Roger’s “Helpless Dancer” theme. Roger sings John’s “Is It Me?” theme (faintly). Keith’s theme, “Bell Boy,” is harmonized in the distance. Roger shouts Pete’s theme: “Looooove! Reign ‘ol me!” Amid swelling waves, Roger asks “Can you see the real me, can you, can you?” — which leads to..\n\n“The Real Me” — Choppy power riff (in C#) with sliding, roaming bass. A troubled Jimmy turns to his doctor, then his mother, who both give cold, indifferent replies. He cries out the chorus plea (“Can you see the real me?”) amid roaring volume and avalanche drum rolls. He grows disoriented and paranoid (“Strange people who know me, peeping from behind every window pane”). A girl he once loved now pretends not to know him. Even the preacher can’t offer consolation. The song fades on an echo of the word “me..me..me..me..me..me..,” which leads to…\n\n“Quadrophenia” (instrumental) — Piano “Bell Boy” theme over strummed acoustic chords and staccato electric guitar, which carries the “Is It Me?” theme over fluttering synth strings and stormy, cymbal-laden drums. Crests in F as French horn heralds the “Helpless Dancer” theme. The one-note piano motif is overlaid with fluttering synth strings and guitar voicings of the melody. From the smoldering key of F, they rise to A with swelling synth strings, which fade to a tender piano intro of the “Love, Reign o’er Me” theme, accented with lyrical guitar and violin-like synth. Ocean sounds carry out the climax.\n\n“Cut My Hair” — Lyrical guitar leads (in C#) amid nimble bass, misty cymbal and light piano. Pete sings about Jimmy’s concerns with hair, fashion, wardrobe, and his place in the mod scene. His mother discovers his “box of blues” (uppers). Roger takes the chorus, about “Zoot suit, white jacket with side vents.” The middle-eight concerns his social misgivings at a dance event. The coda (in A minor) deals with his hangover back at home (“My fried egg makes me sick first thing in the morning”). A news report of mods vs. rockers violence is heard over the airwaves.\n\n“The Punk and the Godfather” — Intro: strummed electro–acoustic riff (Am… D… G [open D]…G→Am) and trailing bass (bi-octave root notes). Verse: the punk admonishes the god that people created for not being mighty, compassionate, or transcendent. Bridge: the god declares his omnipotence and owns the charade with smug false prophecy (“I’m the new president, But I grew and I bent, Don’t you know? don’t it show? I’m the punk with the stutter”). Chorus: a garbled, high-pitched, stuttering utterance of “My my my my my mmmm my my my. GGGGG-g-g-g-g generation.” Middle-eight (Pete vocal): the godfather shows humility (“I have to be careful not to preach, I can’t pretend that I can teach”), suffixed with further ruthlessness.\n\n“I’m One” — Fingerpicked acoustic folk tune with electric twang (West Coast influence). Jimmy struggles with feelings of futility, redeemed by his sense of belonging within the mod subculture. Open-chord chorus (Fmaj7→D). Rocking second verse and chorus with countrified electric guitar and flowing drum fills.\n\n“The Dirty Jobs” — Grand intro (in C) with fanfare synth strings. Soaring account of the working man’s plight (“I am a man who looks after the pigs”) and the conflicts of daily life. Despite the constant setbacks, he declares “I’m not gonna sit and weep again.” Could be Jimmy, his father, or any local bloke; the third verse is clearly Jimmy (“Just like a child, I’ve been seeing only dreams”).\n\n“Helpless Dancer” (Roger’s theme) — Drizzling piano (in F), overlaid with French horn theme and briskly strummed acoustic guitar. Lands on a terse, one-note piano figure. Cabaret call-and-response (between Roger in right and left channel). Brecht–Weill influenced number about white working class dispair with caustic observations. His mounting hopelessness crescendoes on the line “You stop dancing.” The song cuts to a nearby dance where “The Kids Are Alright” pipes from the speakers. Roger sings out John’s theme: “Is it me, for a moment…for a moment…for a moment…”\n\n“Is It in My Head?” — Laidback acoustic strum (in G) with light piano and droning synth. The narrator makes wry observations about contented individuals who get by in meager surroundings (“I see a man without a problem”). Harmonized chorus (in D). Tense middle-eight (B♭→F) hints at confusion (“My head is empty, yet every word I say turns out a sentence”).\n\n“I’ve Had Enough” — Hurricane drum fills signal power chords (in D). Verse: the Godfather (?) scolds Jimmy (“You got altered information”), who realizes that things are counterintuitive and that he can’t play it safe. Roger’s soaring verses cut to a Pete-sung bridge that reaffirms Jimmy’s mod devotion (“My jacket’s gonna be cut and slim and checked… I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat”). Cuts to fluttering synth strings (in A minor) for a double-utterance of Roger’s “Love, Reign o’er Me” theme, which blends into a finger-picking bluegrass section (in D) with a litany of “I’ve had enough of” negations. The four sections repeat, climaxing with a scream (“I’ve had enough of trying to LOOOOOOOVE!!!!”)\n\n“5:15” — Piano intro with light guitar (in G, falling thirds) reminiscent of “Cut My Hair” with Pete’s “Why should I care” opener, repeated twice but unanswered. Staccato guitar figure leads into a new song proper: a mid-tempo brass rocker (in G) with blaring Entwistle horns and lyrics about “sexually knowing” teenage girls and seductive seats. Barroom piano bridge (in C) about drugs and escapism (“Uppers and downers, either way blood flows”). Chorus (in F): harmonized, ivory-laden moment of reflection (“Inside outside. Leave me alone”). Roger belts Marriott-like ad-libs as Pete takes over with electrified pick-licks. The song concludes with two further utterances of “Why should I care.”\n\n“Sea and Sand” — Sea-sound intro and fingerpicked electric figure (in A). Jimmy, thrown out of home, sits by the ocean and dreams of a girl who he knows but hasn’t secured. He still envisions himself as the perfect mod. Pete repeats the bridge from “I’ve Had Enough” (“My jacket’s gonna be cut slim and checked”). The song turns into a powertrio jam with cascading toms, scaling leads and thick, bottom-heavy bass.\n\n“Drowned” — Uptempo piano barroom rocker (in C). Roger belts out poetic metaphors that liken the flow of ocean waves to freedom and peace of mind (“Let me be stormy and let me be calm, Let the tide in, and set me free”). This could be Jimmy settling into his oasis. Cymbal spray and tom-tom fills dominate the finger-picked mid-section, which shifts to a grand brass theme (in A). Plays out as a powertrio rock jam.\n\n“Bell Boy” (Keith’s theme) — Massive drum rolls herald power chords (in E). Roger sings amid a synth melody (E…C#→DD) with a brisk, pounding undercurrent. Jimmy emerges from the beach and encounters the Ace Face, the mod he idolized. Bridge (in C#): Jimmy confirms the subject’s identity (“Ain’t you the guy who used to set the paces, riding up in front of a hundred faces” — face: a sharp-dressed person of stature in the mod scene). Second verse: semi-step modulation; riff more pronounced; theme resolves with a seven-chord riff (F…D→E♭…A♭→B♭…C→C#). The Ace Face (Keith) describes his menial job as a bell boy in garbled cockney. Calm mid-section in 6/8. Repeat verse→bridge→chorus. Jimmy informs the indifferent Ace Face “I used to follow you back in ’63.”\n\n“Doctor Jimmy” (with “Is It Me?”, John’s theme) — Ocean wind sounds; rain, thunder. Crashing theme with fluttering upward synth strings (in A). Uptempo rock verse with cocky lyrical bravado (“I’ll take on anyone, ain’t scared of a bloody nose”). Fanfare bridge with bold statements. Chorus: four-chord Jeckly and Hyde predicament (“He only comes out when I drink my gin”). Second verse: bold sexual claims (as Mr. Jim). Instrumental break (in E): somber variation of theme with cymbal spray. Tender middle; Roger sings John’s theme (“Is it me…for a moment?”) Third verse: vows revenge on the “baboon” who cut up his eye. Third bridge: couplets repeat twice, each separated by a staccato organ break. Final chorus (epic extension), followed by a recap of John’s theme. Instrumental outro: down-shifted theme, crashing drums, fluttering synth strings, drizzling piano, backward cymbal, drone fadeout (in E) blends into…\n\n“The Rock” (instrumental) — Opens on “Bell Boy” theme (in E), gradually builds to full seven-chord rock riff. Drum fill subsides for piano introduction of “Is It Me?” — accented with staccato guitar. Semi-tone shift (to F) for a slow, stormy combination of “Bell Boy” and “Helpless Dancer” elements before Roger’s"
