Have a great Thursday.\n\n1). On this day in 1607, L'Orfeo (Italian pronunciation: [lorˈfɛːo]), sometimes called La favola d'Orfeo [la ˈfaːvola dorˈfɛːo], is a late Renaissance/early Baroque favola in musica, or opera, by Claudio Monteverdi, with a libretto by Alessandro Striggio. It is based on the Greek legend of Orpheus and tells the story of his descent to Hades and his fruitless attempt to bring his dead bride Eurydice back to the living world. It was written in 1607 for a court performance during the annual Carnival at Mantua. While Jacopo Peri's Dafne is generally recognized as the first work in the opera genre, and the earliest surviving opera is Peri's Euridice, L'Orfeo is the earliest that is still regularly performed.\n\n2). On this day in 1956, Piston's Fifth Symphony was commissioned by the Juilliard School of Music on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. It was completed in 1954, but premiered only on February 24, 1956, by the Juilliard Orchestra, conducted by Jean-Paul Morel. The program also included premieres of works by Peter Mennin, Lukas Foss, Milton Babbitt, Irving Fine, Ross Lee Finney, and William Schuman.\n\n3). On this day in 1964, Country music legend Buck Owens's single \"My Heart Skips a Beat\" was Owens's third number one on the U.S. country singles chart. \"My Heart Skips a Beat\" spent seven non-consecutive weeks at the top with a total of twenty-six weeks on the chart. The B-side, \"Together Again\", also hit number one on the country chart both replacing and being replaced by \"My Heart Skips a Beat\" from the top spot.\n\n4). 1973 - Roberta Flack had her second US No.1 when 'Killing Me Softly With His Song', started a five-week run at the top of the charts. The song was written in collaboration with singer-songwriter Lori Lieberman and was born of a poem she wrote after experiencing a strong reaction to the Don McLean song 'Empty Chairs.' Roberta Flack first heard the song during a flight. She performed it for the first time live when supporting Marvin Gaye who told her she had to record a version before playing it live again.\n\n5). On February 24, 1977, Crystal Gayle won Best Female Vocalist at the 12th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards. In 1978, the singer with floor-length hair became the first female country artist to reach platinum sales, with her 1977 album “We Must Believe in Magic.” The album included her country-pop crossover hit, “Don’t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue.” So far, Gayle has scored 20 No. 1 country songs. As one of the most successful country-pop crossover acts of the 1970s and 1980s, she paved the way for artists such as Faith Hill, Shania Twain, and Carrie Underwood. Gayle was born Brenda Gail Webb on January 9, 1951, in the Appalachian coal-mining town of Paintsville, KY. Gayle was the youngest of eight siblings, including singers Loretta Lynn and Peggy Sue. In 1970, Gayle released her first Top 40 country single, “I’ve Cried The Blues (Right Out of My Eyes),” on her sister Loretta Lynn’s record label, Decca Records. For the next three years, she released three more successful singles. In 1974, determined to step out of the shadow of her famous older sister, she signed United Records and released her first album, “Crystal Gayle.” Her self-titled album included Gayle’s first top-10 country hit, “Wrong Road Again”(1974). Two years later, Gayle scored her first No. 1 country hit with “I’ll Get Over You” (1976). Mickey Gilley takes the Entertainer of the year Award for Country music at the 12th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards.\n\n6). 2000 - Carlos Santana won eight awards at the 2000 Grammy Awards for his Supernatural album.

From February 28th thru March 2nd in 1967, The Beatles began recording ‘Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds’ during this session. First of all, however, a final overdub was added to ‘A Day In The Life. This was an extra piano part that was never used; the mono and stereo mixes had already been made, and its purpose remains unclear. The brief overdub appeared during the “He blew his mind out in a car” verse. ‘Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds’ was recorded in seven takes. Track one had George Harrison’s acoustic guitar and occasional piano from George Martin; track two had Paul McCartney on a Lowrey organ, including the distinctive introduction; track three had Ringo Starr’s drums, and the final track had John Lennon playing maracas and singing a guide vocal. George Martin’s piano had been abandoned by the time The Beatles came to record take seven, the best attempt. Track four was erased and replaced with a tamboura drone towards the end of the session. A reduction mix – known as taking eight – was made to free up more space for further overdubs. This was done with the tape machine running at 49 cycles per second rather than the usual 50, making it sound slightly faster upon playback. The session finished at 2.15 am on the morning of 2 March 1967. A composite of takes 6, 7, and vocal overdubs recorded during the next session was released in 1996 on the Anthology 2 album.\n\n4).

The song was included on their 1974 album On the Border and was released as the third single from the album.
