        "text": "It is rare that a new musician breaks rank and attacks the label they are signed to, but when they do, all manner of uncomfortable truths come racing to the surface.\n\nAs is so often the case, the depth of the accusations and the scale of the frustrations are still only hinted at when the matter goes public. Only so much is said and only so much of the iceberg’s tip is visible.\n\nThis was exactly the case at the end of June when, over a series of tweets, British pop singer Raye (real name: Rachel Agatha Keen) outlined her building exasperation with her record label for, she says, locking her into a contractual and artistic oubliette for seven years.\n\nShe says she was signed to a four-album deal with Polydor (part of Universal Music Group, the world’s biggest record company) back in 2014 and has only be able to release one album (technically a nine-track mini album) since then, 2020’s Euphoric Sad Songs.\n\nThere have been a number of singles over the years – standalone tracks and features with acts like David Guetta, Jax Jones, Major Lazer and Rudimental – but most artists see an album (their own album) as the true marker of their creative arrival.\n\n“I know this is the kind of thing I’m suppose to keep behind closed doors, but I have worked and waited and hustled and given EVERYthing I have and if I am going to suffer I am NOT going to do it in silence anymore,” wrote Raye.\n\nShe added she has been informed that, unless her new single ‘Call On Me’ does well (how well is unclear), the label will not proceed with an album.\n\n“imagine the PRESSURE of me waking up every day frantically looking at numbers and stats hoping that I can just make MY BLOODY FIRST ALBUM,” she said.\n\nShe alleged that budgets are being held back to make an album and songs she has worked on are now being handed over to “A list artists because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough to release an album”.\n\nShe also alluded to the culture of creative concessions that acts have to bend to in order to try and please a label enough to put their music out.\n\n\"I’ve done everything they asked me, I switched genres, I worked 7 days a week, ask anyone in the music game, they know,” she claimed. “I’m done being a polite pop star. I want to make my album now, please that is all I want.”\n\nThat is perhaps the key line in all of this – being “a polite pop star”. That phrase compresses a library of chagrin and dejection down to four words. It also hints at the way that certain acts (most of them female) have to carry themselves through the music industry – smiling, acquiescing, constantly saying they are thankful for being there and never, ever complaining.\n\nThe challenges, the knock-backs, the interminable waiting, the changing (yet again) of the A&R focus, the consulting of the data, the scrapped recordings, the shotgun weddings of having to work with people who have written or produced big hits so clearly know better than you what’s best for you, the having to be a different artist this week compared to the one you had to be last week which was different again to the one you had to be the week before that… and having to do all that while smiling or swallowing down the rage and the disappointment as you do not have the power yet to start dictating back to the label.\n\nThere are many, many stories of major artists taking their record labels to court to win back power, or rights or creative control (or all three). Acts like Prince, George Michael, De La Soul, Megan Thee Stallion and Taylor Swift. Sometimes they are victorious and sometimes not. But these are acts with track records and confidence and money and, yes, power to be able to say no.\n\nWe rarely hear of the acts caught in what Hollywood terms “development hell”, where it’s a mashup of Catch-22, Groundhog Day and Waiting For Godot. Which makes what Raye has done all the more exceptional. She did what young pop stars (even those like her who are seven years into a deal) are not supposed to do: she took her complaints public.\n\nPolydor was approached by the NME to comment on her long list of problems, concerns, worries and frustrations.\n\n“We were saddened to read RAYE’s tweets last night and have reached out to her management team to discuss and offer our full support,” is all a label spokesperson would say for now.\n\nPerhaps this is the moment that will break the impasse in Raye’s stonewalled career. Maybe it will sour relations further. However it is almost certainly not an isolated incident in the industry.\n\nNone of this is new; but it does not follow that it should be normalised.\n\nWhat is perhaps most surprising about it all is just how – endlessly, frustratingly, upsettingly – unsurprising it is."
