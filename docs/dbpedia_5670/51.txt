Comedian, Presenter, Actor, Writer (and Night Mayor of Balham - self appointed), Arthur is one of the much admired originals of the great British alternative comedy scene.

Arthur has a consistantly brilliant talent and ability to provide light entertainment whilst also still finding new and interesting ways to make people laugh.

It is no surprise, therefore, that he remains a sought after artist by Comedy Clubs, Theatres, Festivals and Private Events and is regularly seen and heard on Television and Radio.
