THE Canadian Newspaper Directory FIFTH EDITION 1907 A COMPLETE LIST OF THE NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS PUBLISHED IN THE DOMINION OF CANADA AND NEW- FOUNDLAND, WITH FULL PARTICULARS. PUBUSHBD BY A. McKIM, LIMITED ^. ^^ Advertising Agency -A^ ' MONTREAL — TORONTO >* I- r-J CZHd Entered according to Act of Parliament of Canada, in the year one thousand nine hundred and seven, by A. McKim, Limited, of Montreal and Toronto, at the department of Agriculture, Ottawa. PREFACE The fifth edition of the Canadian Newspaper Directory may fairly claim to be a thoroughly complete and up to date hand-book of Canadian Journalism. The newspaper lists have been corrected with the utmost care, accuracy in cir- culation ratings achieved as nearly as possible, and the de- tails concerning each paper carefully revised. Apart from its avowed purpose, the book will be found a valuable gazetteer of every city, town and village that can boast of a local paper. This gazetteer is compiled to show the busi- ness possibilities of any particular section of the country, and within its scope will be found very complete. It gives the population of each town, indicates county seats, gives the railroads touching each place, names the villages sur- rounding each newspaper town, shows the telephone, tele- graph and postal facilities and mentions the principal indus- tries and chief shipments. Its usefulness to advertisers and others who have dealings with newspapers is obvious. From no other source can they obtain the data g^ven in this vol- ume, which is the condensed result of many years' study and experience in the newspaper field. The Canadian Newspaper Directory is useful in a sphere wider than the local advertising field. It is an advertise- ment in foreign countries for the Dominion of Canada. Copies of this edition will find their way into the jhands of hundreds of prominent manufacturers in Great Britain and the United States, giving them a better idea of the progress and importance of Canada than they would otherwise have. The condition and influence of the press of a country is an accurate indication of its advancement, and the fact that Canada possesses so many excellent papers, circulating so widely and extending over so great an area, will show out- siders how extensive is the field here and how great its pos- sibilities. 6 THE CANADIAN NEWSPAPER DIRECTORY. A Special feature of the Directory is a set of five news- paper maps, covering the whole Dominion. These maps have been corrected up to date, but instead of binding them in the book where they are easily torn, they are issued as a supplement and enclosed in a special envelope. They give in a very prominent way the names and correct location of every city, town and village in which one or more news- papers are published. This is a manifest advantage, as it enables the reader to pick out the principal town in any sec- tion of the country at a glance. The publishers of the Directory gratefully acknowledge the generous support given by the most prominent dailies, weeklies and monthlies throughout the country to this and former editions of the Directory, and thank them for the promptness with which all the information asked for has been supplied. It is gratifying to note the increasing num- ber of publishers who keep careful records of their circula- tion and furnish detailed and sworn statements whenever required, as evinced by the black face and starred ratings in this edition. There is still, however, a very large number who neglect to keep records in their own offices and decline to give any information whatever, which, of course, renders it absolutely impossible for any directory to give correct figures regarding their circulations. In such cases the ratings are of necessity only approximate, as they are based upon what information can be gleaned from other sources. Every care has been taken to avoid doing any publisher an injustice, and no pains will be spared to rectify as far as possible any error that may have occurred. OONXENTS.

A. McKiM, Limited, Advertising Agency, Montreal and Toronto SYSTEMATIC ADVERTISING Intelligently Planned and Placed Forms a Highway to Success. Many of the leading firms in ahnost every hne of husi- ness owe their success largely to newspaper advertising. Many have started in a very small way — the advertising brought active demand for their goods — with this active demand capital came easily, larger premises were secured, modern equipment introduced, expanded systems of produc- tion and sale inaugurated, economy of administration en- forced, and with larger profits more extensive advertising, until almost the limit of consumption has been reached. Being associated with many of these successes in the capacity of advertising agents, A. McKim, Limited, are naturally interested in analyzing the relation of advertising and the advertising agency to modern business. Looking broadly over the field of advertising, it is apparent that there is scarcely any limit to its profitable application. Every manufacturer producing an article that the public needs requires to advertise in some form. , No business is so solidly established, or enjoys so large a trade, as to be superior to the advantages of advertising. In this age of keen competition and close margins, busi- ness success depends to a great extent upon an efficient system of selling the goods, and advertising is simply sales- manship in print. A good article is of no more value than a poor one as a money maker until the public knows about it. Just here is where the work of the Advertising Agency begins. It places before its client the means of communication with every man, woman and child in the whole country who is able to read. It can lay out for him the most economical way of talking to the people of any particular district, class, trade or profession throughout the land, thereby enabling the 20 THE CANADIAN NEWSPAPER DIRECTORY. producer of any saleable article to reach the purchasing public with economy of expenditure and in a way to secure the best possible results. Newspaper Values — An Unknown Quantity to the Inexperienced. There are very few commodities in which the basis of value is so continually shifting as in that of Newspaper Advertising. In Canada there are over one thousand Daily and Weekly papers, outside of the Magazines and other monthly publications. Each publication, from the big city Daily down to the little village Weekly, has its own individual basis of value, and that, too, is subject to constant change. Even if the circulation of a paper remain the same from year to year, there are many other conditions that influence the price which the publisher will ask for his space. It is therefore evident at a glance that the producer who starts out unaided in an extensive campaign of newspaper adver- tising, would go floundering around in the dark, wasting valuable time and a great deal of money in gaining the knowledge which he could have had for the asking from the experienced agency, without it costing him a single dollar. What the Agency Must Know. To have absolutely correct information as to the circula- tion of every newspaper would make a long draft upon all the knowledge of gods and men. Only the agency with the work of many years behind it, and the knowledge gained by the regular publication of such a work as The Canadian Newspaper Directory, can be expected to give to an adver- tiser anything like correct figures regarding circulations. But circulation is only one of the many things that go to make up the value of a newspaper as an advertising medium. The quality of the circulation is almost as import- ant as the quantity. A paper circulating entirely among the working classes is of little value to the advertiser of an article which only the rich can aflFord to buy and vice versa. A paper may be well or badly printed — contain a great deal of original matter and small proportion of advertising, or the reverse — it may be made up largely of \" boiler-plate \" THE CANADIAN NEWSPAPER DIRECTORY. ai of little interest to anybody, or nearly all of local news that is of live interest to everybody — it may comprise four out- 'Side pages of live matter and four inside pages where the black cure-all advts. are dumped — it may, in its editorial columns, advocate principles which are diametrically opposed to the interests of certain advertisers — and there are many other circumstances and conditions that must be taken into consideration in estimating the real value of a medium to any particular advertiser. The Agency, besides knowing the papers, must know something of the localities in which they are published, the class of people they reach, and something of their habits and modes of living, and the class of goods that meet their requirements. As an illustration — some districts are large consumers of tea — others drink coffee almost entirely. Throughout the Province of Quebec large quantities of tonic wines are used, while in parts of Ontario and the Maritime Provinces to advertise anything of a spirituous nature would be absolute waste of money. The up-to-date agency must be informed upon all these points, and be able to use the information intelligently in placing the business of its customers. Prices. In the Advertising Agency business, as in all other lines •of trade, the concern that has ample capital and controls the largest volume of business is in the best position to com- mand the lowest prices. It goes without saying, therefore, that an Agency, such as A. McKim, Limited, carrying well on to half a million of business yearly with the newspapers of Canada, can get for its clients everything in the way of price, position and other preferments that it is possible to secure. The publishers of the country recognize this Agency, with its splendid system and its admirable methods of paying accounts promptly, as business builders, and are anxious therefore to assist them in every reasonable way in their work of promoting and creating advertising. There Are Agencies and Agencies. As in other lines of business, and other professions, only ^yy long experience, large practice, extensive operations, can one gain the information, create the system, build up the 22 THE CANADIAN NEWSPAPER DIRECTORY. organization necessary to render the most efficient service. The so-called agent, with office in his hat, without informa- tion, experience or capital, who exists for the purpose of trying to get the legitimate agent's commission, has come to be considered a destroyer rather than a promoter of the best interests of advertiser and publisher, and is not now recognized by papers of any importance. Planning Advertising is the First Step. Each of the large general advertisers throughout the country who are clients of A. McKim, Limited, has added valuable experience to this Agency's store of knowledge. Experience in advertising eliminates experimentation. Ex- periments are often expensive, but they are reduced to the minimum by an Agency that has scored many successes and secured the knowledge that enables it to steer clear of the breakers which are likely to bring disastrous results. This experience is particularly valuable in the first step of profitable advertising — the planning. To plan well, the agent must know the field to be cul- tivated for the particular article .to be advertised, the amount of money necessary to be expended. He must con- sider the people that are to be influenced, whether men or women, or both, whether rich or poor, or everybody, whe- ther city or country, whether English or French, or both — and this is important in Canada — very important. The points that must be brought out to influence trade. The points that will stimulate the dealer as well as the con- sumer. What papers to use — whether Dailies or Weeklies, or both. What size of advts. will bring the best results for the money. What style of type will get the best display in the space. What wording. What illustrations, if any. What booklets, circulars, and follow-up letters should be used so that all may work in harmony and within the appro- priation, and all be done at the right time. It is safe to say that many a large advertiser would never have used the newspapers at all but for the agent, who planned his campaign so as to enable him to grow from small beginnings to large results. THE CANADIAN NEWSPAPER DIRECTORY. 23 Preparing Advertising. Next to planning comes the preparing. For this the Agency has to maintain a staff of advt. writers and illustrators, who must take up the points which have been decided upon in the planning and put them into advts. which are the right size, style, shape, tone and type. The Agency and its staff of artists, writers and experts, working in conjunction with the advertiser with his prac- tical knowledge of the goods, turn out a series of advertise- ments that will tell the story in such a way as to attract and influence the public — creating for each different advertiser a style of advertising that will fittingly represent the goods advertised. After copy and illustrations comes the problem of get- ting the best effect with type and cuts in the different classes of publications which must be used. What would come out well in a magazine might appear only as a black smudge in the ordinary daily paper. Usually an entirely different character of advt. is required for publications that use highly calendered paper. Again, a style of advt. which would be suitable for a medicine would be quite inappro- priate for a brand of flour. The advts. of each advertiser should have a distinctive appearance — an originality of typesetting and illustrating that will make his advertisements stand out from other advertisements and be seen and read wherever they are published. Thus the Agency works with the engraver and the com- positor to get the right result, and even goes so far as to have special fonts of type purchased to give his client some- thing new. Then there is the question of plates.. , Most general advertising goes out in plate form, as in no other way can an advertiser have his advertisement appear exactly as wanted in each paper. The type is sent from the printer to an electrotyper and a copper plate electro made of each advertisement. This electrotype is kept as an original from which duplicates can be made at any time. From the 24 THE CANADIAN NEWSPAPER DIRECTORY. original electrotype a sufficient number of duplicate stereo plates is made to furnish each paper on the list with a com- plete set of the advertisements to be used. The plates put out by A. McKim, Limited, are the finest that modern machinery and equipment can produce, and their requirement is so large as to take almost the entire output of one stereotype factory. Now, as to the placing of advertising. The Advertising Agent as a Purchaser of Space. The agent having figured as counsel of advertising, editor of advertising, and distributor of advertising, is called upon to serve also in the capacity of purchasing agent. He is for his clients the expert buyer of advertising space. He has all the advantages that accrue from long expe- rience and from doing this work for a large number of clients — practically a purchasing combination by which each client secures many advantages. In the case of A. Mc- Kim, Limited, this advantage is particularly notable, as the amount of advertising purchased in Canadian newspapers by this agency is about equal to that of all other Canadian agencies combined. All dealings with A. McKim, Limited, are free and above board. The exact amount paid to each paper is known to the client. The advertiser has access to every item regard- ing his expenditures, the same as he would have if the accounts were kept under his own roof. In effect this ad- vertising agency might be a department of the advertiser's •own business as far as transactions for his account are con- cerned. Likewise every publisher may know the exact amount paid to this agency by any advertiser for his parti- cular paper. By this method a mutual confidence is at once established between the advertiser, the agency and the publisher. Every issue of every paper in which a client's advertis- ing appears is carefully checked to see that he gets what is contracted for — the right position, the right insertion and the right space — and these papers are kept on file as vouch- ers which the client may examine at any time. THE CANADIAN NEWSPAPER DIRECTORY. 25 The accounting is done as it is in a bank — ^with a system that brings the most perfect and accurate results — a large staff being maintained so that the work can be subdivided into departments with responsible heads to supervise the details ; in fact, the manager of one of the largest agencies of the United States, after visiting the McKim Agency, said that this agency has the most complete system of any agency on the continent, a fact mentioned to show that Canada in this particular is quite abreast with any other nation. The McKim Agency may be considered conservative, in that it invariably recommends spending the smallest amount of money that will do the work effectually. The plans are carefully thought out, large advertisements being used when they will be most effective, but never for the sake of size. Advts. are illustrated or not, accordingly as they will bring the best results for the money. What is aimed at all through is not so much \" smart \" advertising, but the honest, frank, confidence-inspiring advts. that make the reader feel like giving the article a trial. Toronto Branch of A. McKim, Limited. For many years a great many of the leading advertisers of Toronto and the West have been regular clients of this agency, but the rapid development of the advertising idea throughout Ontario a fewyears ago necessitated the estab- lishment of offices in Toronto, with a local manager and full staff, in order that every requirement of Western advertis- ers might be promptly attended to. The wisdom of the enterprise has been amply proven by the increased volume of business from that territory year after year. Many Ontario manufacturers who had never advertised before, liave taken advantage of the greater facilities offered by A. McKim, Limited, and are increasing their appropriations year by year. Now, with fully equipped offices in Canada's two chief cities, and with correspondents in New York, Bos- ton and London, England, this agency is one of the strong- est influences of the present day in the field of profitable publicity. « One Hundred and Fifty Advertisers We can offer no better evidence of our facilities for the effective handling of advertising in Canadian Newspapers than this list of One Hundred and Fifty of our clients.

Ontario is the most populous and wealthy of all the provinces o^ Canada. It has a land area of 220,508 square miles and a water area of 40,354 square miles, with a population at the census of 1901 of 2,182,947, It has 43 counties besides six districts as larg-e as some European states, out of which future counties will be formed. The province has 16 incor- porated cities, 121 incorporated towns and about 131 (org-anized) villag-es- Its facilities for railway and water communication combined are not surpassed by any division of the American continent. The River St. Lawrence and the g-reat lakes, Ontario, Erie, Huron and Superior, touch it on its entire southern and western boundaries, while from the \" Height of land,\" which forms the back bone of the province, many fine rivers flow down to those lakes on the south, or to James Bay or Hudsons Bay on the north. No important county is unreached by a railway, and out of a total of 21,353 miles of railway in Canada about 40 per cent, are in Ontario. In the extent and variety of its agricultural, dairy and fruit products Ontario leads the Dominion, while its wealth of gold, nickel, silver, iron, cobalt and other valuable minerals is proving to be greater than was ever anticipated by geolog-ists ten years ago. Not over ten per cent, of the land is as yet cultivated, yet so larg-e is the total area of the Province, and so great the fertility of the land, that the crops are very large. The province in 1905 showed 672,781 head of horses, 2,889,503 head of cattle, 1,324,153 head of sheep, and 1,896,460 head of swine, while some items of the agricultural products in the same year were as follows : 21,516,588 bushels of wheat, 24,265,394 bushels of barley, 105,563,572 bushels of oats, 7,100,021 bushels of pease, 4,700,000 bushels of other grain, 14,366,049 bushels of potatoes, 92,717,675 bushels of turnips and other feeding- roots, and 8,132,306 tons of hay and silage. The average yield per acre of crops in Ontario, though not so large as in the Northwest Provinces and Territories, is greater than in any state in the American Union, the comparison holding good in all kinds of grain in all states, except one kind of grain in one state — oats in Kansas. In 1904 Ontario had 5,753 public schools, besides 419 Roman Catholic separate schools, and 5 Protestant separate schools, 129 kindergartens and 11 night schools. Of pupils, the public schools had 396,495, the R. C. separate schools 47,807, the Protestant separate schools 319, the kindergartens 12,021, the night schools 702. The teachers in public schools numbered 8,610, and in all other primary schools 1,218, making a total of 9,828 primary teachers. In higher education Ontario has a normal college and several normal schools for the training of teachers, 54 model schools, an art and industrial school, two technical schools, 138 high schools and collegiate institutes, with 27,709 pupils and 661 teachers. It has also a training institute, at Guelph, for teachers and others in manual training and domestic science and art. It has 140 free and 306 subscription libraries. In 1902 the province had 3,321 post offices, through which passed 105,600,000 letters, and 17,180,000 post cards, 2,332,000 registered letters, 5,172,000 free letters and $10,565,274 in money orders. Ontario is represented in the Dominion parliament by 22 senators and 86 members of the House of Commons. Its local government is carried on by a single chamber having 98 members. Capital, Toronto.
