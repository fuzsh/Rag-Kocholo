He thinks she will be too grand for him as she lives in a castle, while he lives in a box.\n\nOne night a goblin jumps out of a jack-in-the-box. He warns the soldier that he shouldn’t wish for what doesn't belong to him and should wait to see what happens in the morning.\n\nWhen morning comes the boy puts the soldier on the window sill. He is blown out of the open window. He's found by some other boys and when it starts to rain he's put into a paper boat and washed down a drain. A rat tries to make him pay a toll. Then he plunges into a canal and is eaten by a fish. The fish is caught and sold at market and then taken to the house where the soldier began his journey. The soldier is found when the fish is cut open.\n\nThe soldier is put back with his brothers but one of the other children, perhaps having been put up to it by the goblin, throws him on the fire. A gust of wind then blows the paper dancer onto the fire and she is immediately consumed by flames. The soldier melts into a lump of heart-shaped tin.\n\nDate: 2010 and 2011\n\nCharacter: Narrator\n\nProduction: BBC Radio 4\n\n​\n\nDavid Tennant reads a series of vampire stories for the Book At Bedtime.\n\n​\n\nExtras:\n\n​\n\nDownload A Night With A Vampire: Dead Persons In Hungry\n\nDavid Tennant reads Antoine Calmet's accounts of real Vampires, gathered from people across Europe who believed they had seen the creatures with their own eyes.\n\nDownload A Night With A Vampire: The Family Of The Vordalak\n\nGorcha sets off on a mysterious mission but tells his family not to accept him if he should return after 10 days - for then he will be a vampire.

Arianrhod Hyde's world (or Roddy, as she prefers to be called) is very much the world of magic, pageantry and ritual. Not unlike Britain in King Arthur's Day, Roddy is daughter of two Court Wizards and therefore part of the King's Progress, travelling round the Islands of Blest and ready to take part in whatever ritual or ceremony is required, as it occurs. Presiding over all, the most important person is the Merlin, who is entrusted with the magical health of the Isles of Blest.\n\nNick Mallory's world is much more familiar - at least it starts off being our own. But it soon transpires that Nick's not quite the ordinary 15-year-old he seems, as he slips sideways into something he thinks is a dream - but in fact is another world entirely. Now, Nick's been on other worlds before (although never alone) but he's a confident type. Maybe a bit too confident....\n\nIn Roddy's world, the current Merlin expires and a new one takes his place. Yet something is wrong - the rituals have been upset and nothing is going the way it should. Roddy needs help, and certain powers indicate that Nick is to be the one to help her. And Nick is cool about helping her - in theory...but it's a bit worrying that she seems to mistake him for a magic-user. Their stories unfold, side-by-side, each part leading into the next, and the Merlin Conspiracy thickens as the tales swirl around each other - twining, meeting, and affecting each other, yet never completely combining until the very end chapters when all is finally revealed.\n\nCompelling, howling funny in places, mind-boggling - this is going to WOW DWJ fans all around the world (and probably in other universes too).\n\n​\n\n​\n\nDate: 2002\n\nCharacter: Daniel\n\nProduction: BBC Radio 4\n\nSitcom about a young couple, Lucy and Daniel, and their circle of friends.\n\n​\n\nExtras:\n\n​\n\nDownload Series 1 Episode 1\n\nAs Daniel's birthday approaches, Lucy tries to tempt their friends away from their offspring long enough for them to attend a party.

After a beloved resident of the village drowns in a storm at sea, the differing reactions of the villagers reveal a community torn apart by disputes and disorder. Willy Carson, the survivor of the tragic boating accident, stays in the village to grieve for his friend and finds himself entrapped within a hierarchical community presided over by the domineering Mrs. Rafi. Mrs. Rafi lives in the big house and represents order and respectability, surrounding herself with the twittering ladies of the village. Leading the official grieving, she finds herself at odds with the local draper, Hatch, who is continuously rebuffed and put out of pocket by the grande dame. Mad as a box of frogs, Hatch believes that aliens have infiltrated the village from another planet. He identifies Willy Carson’s sudden appearance in the village as proof of the aliens’ arrival and establishes a taskforce to spy on Willy and the wise village drunk, Evens. In a mad rage, Hatch feverishly attacks the washed up corpse of the drowned man with a knife, mistakenly believing it to be Willy sleeping on the beach. In the middle of this madness, Willy encounters Rose Jones, the fiancee of his dead companion. United in their grief, the couple realize that their only hope of moving forwards is to escape from this community and establish a life elsewhere. As Evens tells Willy to go away and find his answers some place else, Willy and Rose prepare to board their train and leave the village far behind.\n\n​\n\n​"
