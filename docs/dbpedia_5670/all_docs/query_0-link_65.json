Today they were taking part in their first reindeer hunt. For as long as they could remember, they had been honing their skills throwing spears; thirteen-year-old Mil threw spears with deadly accuracy, and twin Lar was not far behind. Silent and nervous in their blind, they waited for the signal to attack—a whistle from one of their cousins. They remained motionless in the cold autumn air so as not to scare away the approaching herd. The year had been a tough one. Last fall the reindeer migration had been meager; the group had killed only eighteen, and of those, three were judged too sick to eat. The old ones said they had never seen such a poor hunt. With forty-four mouths to feed, fifteen reindeer would not sustain them over the long winter. After smoking the meat and preparing the skins, the six families held an emergency council. It was decided that the best course of action would be to head far to the south to harvest hazelnuts. Grandma Ela was from the south and spoke three southern languages, so she would be their guide for the two-week journey. Along the way the mothers set snares for rabbits and hares every evening. Rarely were these efforts unrewarded, but a rabbit or two a day per family, along with a bit of cured reindeer meat, was less sustenance than they normally had. Fortunately, when they reached their destination, the hazelnuts were plentiful, and everyone—young and old—helped crack them open. They overwintered in a sheltered valley Grandma Ela knew from her youth. She led them to an impressive rock shelter in a wooded glen, and thankfully it was unoccupied. However, it was clear that people had lived there in the past— black charcoal circles told of fires tended long ago, and discarded stone tools and chips of stone from tool making were scattered here and there. Grandma Ela picked up an old flint blade and said she was certain she had made it when\n\nx l\n\nPreface\n\nshe was young; it looked like her handiwork. Lar wasn’t sure she was serious. Grandma, with her funny accent, incorrect grammar, constant jokes, and strange sayings, was considered by all to be hilarious—and she was always teasing Lar. Winter was a lean time of long nights and short days, and they subsisted for the most part on hazelnuts, small amounts of cured reindeer meat, and the occasional rabbit. On a particularly frigid but clear day, their cousin Gulic killed a red deer, and everyone shared in the bounty. Feast days like these were few and far between, and for much of that winter food was carefully rationed and the kids’ bellies ached. But at nights around the fire they would tell the old stories and sing the old songs, and Aunt Ulen would play her flute. Yes, food was scarce, but it felt like home. One evening four strangers appeared at the shelter. Grandma talked to them, and Mil and Lar eavesdropped because Grandma had taught them her language. The strangers were impressed with Grandma’s lineage. Grandma Ela was descended from a tree goddess? Why had she never mentioned this? Did that mean that Mil and Lar were too? They stared at each other with open mouths. Grandma then told a joke, and the tension in the strangers’ faces dissolved away as they laughed heartily. It was clear that it wasn’t just northerners who found Grandma hilarious! The next day the strangers returned with sausages. These were cooked and shared with all. Grandma acted as an interpreter between the groups, and Lar and Mil showed off a bit by speaking to the strangers in their own tongue. The next morning, before departing for good, the strangers wished everyone well and embraced Grandma for a long time before leaving. Grandma tried to hide her tears, but Mil saw them. With the arrival of spring, plant foods became more available. For the kids this was both a blessing and a curse. The worst food they ate that spring, at least in Mil’s and Lar’s opinion, had been cattail root cakes made from flour that the two had been forced to grind themselves. They made a secret pact that as adults they would never eat cattail roots again. Summer meant it was time to return to the homelands. Within a week they were back in familiar surroundings, and the kids began to recognize the locations where they had camped. Food remained plentiful; no one went hungry. Near summer’s end, the children joyfully ate blackcurrant berries until their hands were stained a deep purple. The shortening of the days and the first chill wind told the families that now was the time to make their way to the fall hunting grounds. Everyone was hopeful that this year the reindeer would come. And come they did. Gulic’s mother raced into camp from her lookout post high on a nearby ridge. The fall’s first herd of reindeer, much more numerous\n\nPreface\n\nm xi\n\nthan last year, was headed to the choke point in the ravine. Everyone sprang into action. Mil and Lar grabbed their spear throwers and darts and joined the able-bodied adults in the first party to leave camp. The grandparents and young children would follow later, for butchering more than twenty reindeer would require everyone’s help. From their blind, Mil and Lar could see that the herd was now climbing up the narrow ravine—for miles this was the only route up the cliffs and out of the broad valley where the deer had spent the summer eating to their hearts’ content. “You must let the first ones go by before you throw; once they’ve gotten up to where your cousins are hiding, then we attack,” their father had instructed them. It seemed to Lar like the whole herd was going to pass without anyone throwing a spear. Then the whistle—loud and piercing—rang out. Lar and Mil leapt up and let their first spears fly. Both struck reindeer, penetrating deep into their sides. They loaded another dart and then another, as did all the hunters. For several minutes it seemed as if the air was filled with spears. Because the deer were so tightly packed, most darts hit their targets. This year there would be plenty of food to last the winter.\n\n3 This story took place 32,000 years ago. Due to the rise in sea level that began more than 15,000 years ago, the fall hunting grounds of Mil’s and Lar’s people now lie 40 meters (130 feet) beneath the English Channel. Their group’s emergency refuge was a rock shelter near what is now Poitiers, France, some 430 kilometers (267 miles) to the south. Today Lar’s and Mil’s people are colloquially known as Cro-Magnons—people physically indistinguishable from you and me who made their living hunting and gathering in Ice Age Europe. These were people who loved, cried, and laughed, and like you and me they had their own struggles and triumphs. They made music, painted the walls of caves and huts, and created sculptures from clay, rock, ivory, and antler. They buried their dead, but they left no written records. All we know about them we have learned from studying their skeletons and the art and debris they left behind as they went about their lives. Although the story of Lar and Mil is a product of my imagination, no doubt there were people in Ice Age Europe who lived lives much like those depicted here. This book tells their story. It includes vignettes like this one, but it’s primarily about the scientific investigation of these ancient people, written by someone who has studied them for more than three decades. I find the Cro-Magnons fascinating, and my hope is that by the end of this book you will as well.\n\nCro-Magnon\n\nIntroduction\n\nSETTING THE STAGE\n\nA little over 150 years ago, railroad workers in the picturesque village of Les Eyziesde-Tayac-Sireuil in the Vézère Valley of the Périgord region of southwest France accidentally discovered multiple human skeletons associated with Paleolithic (“Old Stone Age”) tools and ancient fauna, including mammoth and reindeer.1 The remains were found in a small rock shelter known as l’abri Cro-Magnon. “Abri” is French for “shelter” or rock shelter,2 and “cro” is an alternative spelling of the Occitan3 word cròs or clòt—a cavity or hollow (creux in French). Magnon was the property owner’s name; the property was listed as “Cramagnon” in the public registry, according to Lartet.4 As the first verifiable discovery of Homo sapiens skeletons found with extinct animals, these finds were so noteworthy that even today the term “Cro-Magnon” is widely understood to represent a form of prehistoric human, despite the fact that this appellation has almost completely disappeared from the scientific literature. Nonetheless, Cro-Magnon was for many years a widely used name for the earliest modern humans in Europe. For example, in the 1980s, fossils from much earlier contexts in the Levant (the eastern shore of the Mediterranean) were sometimes called “Proto-Cro-Magnons” (chapter 4). To the layperson, it may sound odd to refer to prehistoric people from the Cro-Magnon rock shelter—folks who lived about 32,000 years ago and who used stone tools—as “modern.” However, in the field of human paleontology, modern humans are not “modern” in the sense that modern art, modern architecture, or modern dance is modern. In fact, fossils of modern, or nearly modern, humans can be quite ancient, dating back to perhaps 300,000 years ago in\n\n2 l\n\nI n t ro d u c t i o n\n\nnorthwest Africa (chapter 4). The skeletons from the site of Cro-Magnon are modern in that they are members of our own evolutionarily successful and cosmopolitan species, Homo sapiens. In human paleontology, the Linnaean name Homo sapiens and the more vernacular terms “modern humans” or “anatomically modern humans” are often synonymous.5 As for H. sapiens, we are the only surviving species of a long and fairly bushy lineage of African primates known as hominins, members of the taxonomic tribe Hominini. In Linnaean taxonomy, a tribe is more inclusive than a genus but less inclusive than a subfamily. Among our living relatives, chimpanzees, bonobos (“pygmy chimpanzees”), and humans are all members of the subfamily Homininae. At the tribe level, however, chimpanzees and bonobos are members of the tribe Panini, a name that makes me think of Italian bread, and not members of our tribe, Hominini. Hominins are therefore quite simply defined as those animals more closely related to us than to chimpanzees or bonobos. Although there is no agreement among scientists as to their exact number, today more than twenty-five fossil hominin species are reported in the scientific literature. Some are almost certainly our ancestors but most are collateral relatives—cousins in hominin lineages that either went extinct or taxa who despite no longer being with us nonetheless contributed a small number of genes to our more direct ancestors—genes still found in people today. In chapter 6, you will meet one 40,000-year-old early modern human from Romania who may have had a great-great grandparent who was a Neandertal (H. neanderthalensis, sister species of H. sapiens).6 This book is dedicated to telling the story of the Cro-Magnons from two perspectives. The first is that of a biological anthropologist, the field in which I am trained. Biological anthropologists (sometimes abbreviated as bioanthropologists) study the evolution, behavior, and genetic and morphological variation of humans, our living primate relatives (lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, monkeys, apes), and the fossil remains of our hominin ancestors and their relatives. The second perspective is that derived from Paleolithic archaeology, an area in which I have much practical experience but less formal training. Archaeologists study the debris left behind by prehistoric people—from the remains of their living spaces (caves, huts, or other temporary shelters; postholes, internal structures, hearths) to the food they ate (remains and residues of animals and plants, sometimes burned), to the tools they used (typically stone because it tends to survive due to its durability, but sometimes wood, bone, or antler), to their funerary practices (intentional burials and associated grave goods). At least for later human evolution, which here I equate with the beginning of the Late Pleistocene\n\nI n t ro d u c t i o n\n\nm 3\n\nabout 129,000 years ago,7 most fossil hominin skeletons have been recovered by archaeologists working in controlled excavations of hominin sites. I am also a paleoanthropologist. Paleoanthropology is the multidisciplinary study of human evolution, and the bulk of paleoanthropologists are either human paleontologists (bioanthropologists like me who study fossil humans) or Paleolithic archaeologists, who study the materials these humans left behind in the distant past. Both of these scientific approaches are critical to understanding the evolution and behavior of prehistoric people, but given my training, the primary approach this book takes is one of biological anthropology. From this perspective, although we acknowledge that everyone alive today is a member of H. sapiens, when it comes to identifying fossil members of our species, things are murkier. The overall gestalt of the Cro-Magnons is one of anatomical modernity; however, in some aspects of their anatomy, they do not always fall within the range of variation seen among people today. Should it surprise us that people 30,000 years ago do not look exactly like we do now? This begs the question— who are the earliest H. sapiens, and how do we identify them (chapter 4)? I also investigate the evolutionary origins of H. sapiens, the role of Neandertals therein, and touch on the continuing debate surrounding modern human behavior—whether such a thing exists, and if it does, whether it can be limited to our species alone. This is followed by discussion of the archaeological and paleontological evidence of the Cro-Magnons—including their biology, food, technology, and art—from their earliest known appearance in Europe about 54,000 years ago through the end of the Pleistocene about 11,700 years ago. I finish with a discussion of how the Cro-Magnons dealt with climate change—both when climate became much colder than today and when temperatures rose, glaciers retreated, and Europe became reforested. How they responded to climate change may offer valuable lessons for us today. Who am I? I have been a fossil hunter for nearly as long as I can remember. As a child, I spent hours scouring gravel driveways for marine fossils. Crinoids, marine animals also known as sea lilies, were among my favorite discoveries. I was a quirky kid; another of my favorite pastimes was to randomly pull out a volume of the encyclopedia to read. I first read about human evolution in a World Book encyclopedia article written by my “academic grandfather” (the doctoral advisor of my doctoral advisor), the paleoanthropologist Alan Mann. But I had already been captivated by the subject at age eight, when my mother told me about the discovery of “Lucy”—a 40 percent complete, 3.18-million-year-old Australopithecus afarensis skeleton—at the time our earliest human ancestor. As a teenager, this burgeoning interest in human origins led me to study anthropology in college. It was there I became enamored with later human evolution,\n\n4 l\n\nI n t ro d u c t i o n\n\nespecially modern human origins. The origin of modern humans is the oldest question in paleoanthropology: How and through what evolutionary processes did people like you and me come to exist? It was the topic of my doctoral dissertation, and this question continues to enthrall me. In this book I detail how fossil and genetic evidence together weave threads of a fascinating and complicated story of our own species’ evolutionary emergence (chapters 5 and 6). Throughout this book are vignettes from my time researching fossils; through these I hope to give you a feel for what it’s like to be a member of the cadre of people who study human evolution. It may not surprise you to learn that I’m a quirky adult—after all, one must be a bit eccentric to study human evolution for a living. Most of the time I am blissfully unaware of this, but there are times when it’s painfully obvious. For example, strolling across campus one day, I saw a student walking toward me wearing a black T-shirt featuring a beautifully rendered skull in front of a satellite photo of Earth. I found myself assessing the taxonomy of the skull on his shirt: Was it a Homo erectus? A Neandertal? Up close, I saw that his shirt read “Recycle or Die.” Should I be disturbed that for me skulls are objects of study that no longer represent danger or death?\n\nEXCITING TIMES\n\nBefore we begin the Cro-Magnons’ story, some historical background is warranted. Europe in the first half of the nineteenth century was in the throes of a scientific revolution, with great advances being made in geology and biology— advances that were changing our perception of the planet and our place in the universe. For centuries in Europe, Earth and the animal and plant species inhabiting it had been viewed as static and unchanging. Earth was created by God in its current state about 6,000 years ago. No new species had emerged; none had gone extinct. The notion that there was such a thing as prehistoric humans was considered fallacious. We knew what had happened since the earliest days of creation because it had been written down in the books of what Christians, by far the predominant religion in Europe, refer to as the Old Testament. There was no such thing as prehistory; all human existence had been recorded, and the world was young and static. In the lyrics of the Gloria Patri, “As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end”—yet this view of a young and static Earth was to undergo a radical revision. In Earth sciences, the Scottish geologist Charles Lyell (1797–1875), following in the footsteps of his countryman James Hutton (1726–1797), embraced and\n\nI n t ro d u c t i o n\n\nm 5\n\nfurther refined the scientific framework of uniformitarianism, the idea that the same geological processes that affect the Earth’s surface today—volcanism, wind and water erosion, frost weathering, soil deposition, glaciers, earthquakes— operated to shape the Earth’s crust in the past. Unlike the competing model of catastrophism, which viewed most features of Earth’s crust as the result of cataclysmic events, uniformitarianism implied a much older age for the Earth. If the Grand Canyon in what was then called the New Mexico Territory had not been born of a single earth-rending event, but rather had been steadily eroded away by the tiny Colorado River at its base, then the Earth was very ancient indeed, certainly older than 6,000 years! Lyell’s Principles of Geology was a veritable tour de force of the uniformitarian perspective and led to the widespread abandonment of catastrophism.8 As a result, scientists in the mid-nineteenth century were beginning to accept a much older age for the Earth than had previously been thought possible. It is Lyell to whom we owe the broad acceptance of the concept of deep (geological) time. The acceptance of an ancient Earth is important because deep time is essential for evolutionary biology, as broadly speaking it is a necessary condition for macroevolution (i.e., the origin of new taxa or the bifurcating speciation events leading to the formation of the “tree of life”) to occur. As such, Charles Darwin’s (1809–1882) formulation of the origin of species via natural selection depended heavily on deep time. An avid pigeon breeder, Darwin was aware of the number of varieties of, and amount of morphological change humans had wrought on, the rock dove (Columba livia) in a relatively brief amount of time. The catch is that these varieties are still pigeons—they remain members of the same species9—and therefore the differences manifest between them are classified as microevolutionary rather than macroevolutionary in character. The prevailing view among nineteenth-century naturalists was that varieties were ontologically10 different from species, but Darwin took the contrarian position. For him, varieties that had emerged in human time had the potential to become differentiated species given enough geological time. Species were “only strongly-marked and well-defined varieties.”11 Although Darwin is rightly considered to be the preeminent evolutionary scientist of all time, the truth is that early nineteenth-century Europe was awash with evolutionary ideas. Darwin’s own grandfather, Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802), had been an evolutionist of some renown. The French naturalist Jean Baptiste de Lamarck (1744–1829), although criticized for his advocation for the inheritance of acquired characteristics,12 made important contributions to evolutionary theory—the greatest being his recognition that the environment plays a critical role in evolution. Georges Cuvier (1769–1832), widely considered the founder of\n\n6 l\n\nI n t ro d u c t i o n\n\ncomparative anatomy and a leading proponent of catastrophism, had in his cabinets at the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle (National Museum of Natural History) in Paris the remains of so many animals from around the globe that he confirmed many fossilized bones coming to the museum were of animals no longer living. He was therefore the first person to document the existence of extinct species; as it was in the beginning, then, it no longer is. Of course, I wouldn’t want to omit Alfred Russell Wallace (1823–1913), who independently came up with the concept of natural selection, spurring Darwin to finally write his book! According to the historian of science Arnaud Hurel (2018), the early nineteenth century found scholars in two broad fields—the natural sciences and the human sciences—each with its own methodologies, working independently on the question of human antiquity. Hurel points out that, by historical convention, 1859 is the year these two fields became united in their view that humans had geological antiquity—and for two reasons. First, in 1859, both the Société Géologique de France (Geological Society of France) and the Société d’Anthropologie de Paris (Society of Anthropology of Paris, founded in 1859 by the physician and bioanthropologist Paul Broca [1824–1880]) published papers proving beyond all shadow of a doubt the existence of prehistoric humans. This was due to the discovery at multiple sites, excavated under controlled conditions, of stone tools and other clearly humanly made artifacts in association with extinct animals. In contrast to the acceptance of these artifacts, however, human skeletal remains from prehistoric contexts were still controversial in the scientific community. This is not to say that they had not been found! In 1823, the theologian and geologist William Buckland (1784–1856) found a Paleolithic skeleton, missing its skull (but replete with red ochre-stained bones), in Paviland Cave, outside of Swansea, Wales. He erroneously determined that this skeleton of a young adult male was that of a woman of ill repute whom he associated with a nearby Roman encampment. He referred to this clearly scandalous person as the “Red Lady,” due to the red ochre staining of “her” skeleton.13 Other finds were made at Grande Grotte de Bize in France (1827), and Neandertals were recovered in Belgium and Gibraltar in 1829/1830 and 1848, respectively. However, the significance of these finds at first went unrecognized (chapter 3). The second reason Hurel cites 1859 as a landmark year for human prehistory is due to the September meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Aberdeen. The highlight of this meeting was Charles Lyell announcing his acceptance of the existence of human prehistory. What I find fascinating is that all of these events occurred before the publication of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, which did not appear until November of that year!\n\nI n t ro d u c t i o n\n\nm 7\n\nDiscoveries of prehistoric human remains from more controlled excavations soon followed. In 1861, the paleontologist Édouard Lartet (1801–1871)14 documented that human remains, unfortunately lost before his arrival, had been associated with extinct fauna at the site of Aurignac, in the foothills of the Pyrenees. That same year he and his English collaborator Henry Christy (1810–1865) began to explore rock shelters in the Vézère Valley of the Périgord region in southwest France—the valley that is home to the site of Cro-Magnon and a multitude of other Paleolithic sites. In 1864, they found a human skeleton at La Madeleine just two miles from Cro-Magnon, but they hesitated to associate it with the Paleolithic, concerned that it could be a Neolithic (“New Stone Age”) burial dug into Paleolithic levels. In 1866, human remains were recovered at Solutré in eastern France, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of Lyon. According to Morant, the poor stratigraphic controls of the early excavations at this site were such that one cannot discern the geological age or archaeological context of the human specimens;15 this prevented their widespread acceptance as Paleolithic burials. Finds like these were not greeted with enthusiasm. Many, like Solutré, were argued to be impossible to date or were thought to be Neolithic. Worse still, some were considered cases of fraud on the part of the excavator. A particularly notable case concerns the work of the customs officer and amateur archaeologist Jacques Boucher de Perthes (1788–1868) at the site of Moulin Quignon, near Abbeville in northern France. The political fallout resulting from an investigation into this discovery is discussed in detail by Trinkaus and Shipman, but a brief summary is warranted here.16 In 1863, Boucher de Perthes announced he had found a human mandible associated with stone tools at Moulin Quignon. The problem is that Boucher de Perthes’s habit of paying workers for artifacts led to a cottage industry of at least some people in Abbeville making replicas of stone tools to pass off as the real thing. It is possible that this habit also led to their seeding the site of Moulin Quignon with a (decidedly fresh) human mandible. Today Boucher de Perthes is viewed as a hapless victim of fraud, rather than its perpetrator, but sadly he went to his grave believing the inquiry into the site’s legitimacy ruined his reputation. The debate surrounding Moulin Quignon also took on an air of international partisanship, with British scholars tending to question its veracity and French scientists defending it. The whole affair ultimately faded in importance as more and more verified prehistoric human sites were found across Europe. It is into this complicated milieu that the site of Cro-Magnon comes to light in 1868, and there begins our tale.\n\n1 Discovery\n\nLorsqu’on franchit pour la première fois, en chemin de fer, la distance qui sépare Limoges d’Agen, on ne peut se défendre d’un double sentiment de surprise et d’admiration en passant dans les défilés tortueux du Périgord noir, au fond desquels coule la Vézère. Les contrastes que présente cette vallée si fraîche avec les escarpements rocheux aux formes si bizarres qui la limitent brusquement des deux côtés, ménagent aux regards du voyageur le plus indifférent une succession d’effets aussi inattendus qui saisissants qui commandent son attention. The first time one makes one’s way by rail between Limoges and Agen, one cannot help but have a feeling of both surprise and admiration at the torturously narrow passageways of the Black Périgord, at the base of which runs the Vézère River. The contrasts this cool valley presents, with its strangely shaped rocky escarpments hemming one in so tightly on both sides, provides even the most indifferent traveler [with] a succession of visual effects so unexpected and striking that they command his attention. —Louis Lartet, “Une sépulture des troglodytes du Périgord” (1868, translation mine)\n\nL\n\nouis Lartet, like his father Édouard before him, spent years doing archaeological and geological surveys and excavating among the imposing limestone cliffs, cool rock shelters, and enchanting caves of the Vézère Valley of the Black Périgord in southwest France.1 His description\n\nDiscov ery\n\nm 9\n\nof the location remains as true today as it was when he wrote it in 1868. This valley, with one of the highest concentrations of Paleolithic sites in the world, is a lush paradise with steep cliff walls bedecked with broadleaf forests. I first saw the valley in March 1994 when collecting data for my doctoral dissertation. My headquarters in the Périgord was its regional capital, the city of Périgueux, lying approximately halfway between Limoges and Agen. I was measuring and radiographing fossil hominins, and studying human fossils curated in Périgueux in what is now known as the Musée d’Art et d’Archéologie du Périgord (Museum of Art and Archaeology of the Périgord; at the time it was known as the Musée du Périgord). However, I also used Périgueux as my base of operations for day trips to museums in the nearby towns of Montauban, Brive-la-Gaillarde, and fatefully, Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil (abbreviated to “Les Eyzies” from this point forward), home of the Musée National de Préhistoire (National Museum of Prehistory) and the Cro-Magnon rock shelter featured so prominently in this book (figure 1.1). I still remember taking the train to Les Eyzies from Périgueux on that chilly, foggy March morning almost 30 years ago. Calling it a train is a misnomer because it was a small single-car tram, and for much of the morning’s journey, I was its sole passenger. When only the driver (a compact, muscular man) and I remained, I struck up a conversation with him. I remember him as a man of few words, but friendly enough, and I tried not to show how shocked I was that he didn’t know about the hominin fossils housed in the museum at Les Eyzies—a museum that he had surely driven past hundreds of times. As our little tram took its circuitous route toward and then over the Vézère, steep limestone cliffs rose on either side of us and the swiftly flowing river came into view. Early in the spring most of the trees were devoid of leaves, and I could see the craggy limestone behind them. Here and there I could make out the entrances of caves perhaps 30 meters (100 feet) above us. What struck me at the time is that people continue to live in the shelter of the cliff faces—many houses are built right into the rock face, with the cliff forming the back wall and often part of the roof of their homes. Despite this obvious sign of a human presence, the Vézère Valley has a wild, unspoiled feel to it, although I have been told by locals that most of its cliff faces were clear-cut of their trees in the early twentieth century. When my tram stopped in the hamlet of Les Eyzies, I bade goodbye to the driver and stepped onto the platform, portable X-ray machine in tow. I started to make my way toward the museum—there is only one main road in town, so it is impossible to get lost. The first thing I noticed, to my left, was the Hôtel Cro-Magnon, located only 30 meters (100 feet) downriver from the main Cro-Magnon rock shelter itself. I’m sure all paleoanthropologists chuckle to\n\n10 l\n\nD iscov ery\n\nF i gu r e 1. 1 European and West Asian locations and sites mentioned in chapters 1 through 4.

My family and I have stayed in the hotel, and it has French country charm and a welcoming feel. I love the hall on the second floor featuring the cliff face as its back wall—for like so many buildings in the Vézère Valley, it is built directly against the cliff.\n\nDiscov ery\n\nm 11\n\nF i gu r e 1. 2 Hôtel Cro-Magnon, July 2015; view from the train station in Les Eyzies. Source: Photo by author.\n\nThe second thing I noticed as I walked through Les Eyzies was the imposing sculpture of a Neandertal high up on a ridge overlooking the village. This statue, l’Homme primitif (the primitive man) was created by the noted French sculptor Paul Dardé (1888–1963) in 1931. For 90 years, this imposing figure, with its slumped posture informed by the paleontologist Marcellin Boule’s (1861–1942) view of Neandertals as maladapted evolutionary dead ends (chapter 3), has looked out over the Vézère Valley from high above the town in the courtyard of the Musée National de Préhistoire. I have been told that this statue was not popular with the locals and was treated with derision when first erected (much like the Eiffel Tower). It is now much beloved and is one of the most frequently photographed sights in town. The final thing I will mention about my first trip to Les Eyzies is that I quite erroneously thought the town was dead. Almost all the shops were shuttered, and very few people were on the streets. I wondered if, as in many rural parts of the United States, the young people had gone elsewhere for jobs. Years later I discovered that I was there in the off-season. In the summer, the town is bursting\n\n12 l\n\nD iscov ery\n\nwith tourists (the local joke is that in summer there are more Dutch than French people in the Vézère Valley), and restaurants and bars have near-capacity crowds (at least this was true pre-COVID-19). Much of the attraction of vacationing in the region is nature (kayaking or canoeing on the Vézère, hiking along the craggy ridges to take in their panoramic views), but prehistory remains a huge draw. In addition to the Musée National de Préhistoire, Les Eyzies is also home to an interpretive center dedicated to prehistory and human evolution; it was there that I was humbled to learn that chimpanzees do better on some intelligence tests than humans! The town also boasts multiple prehistoric sites open to the public, including Cro-Magnon, Abri Pataud, Font-de-Gaume, Les Combarelles, and Grotte de Bernifal—the last three replete with Paleolithic parietal (wall) art. In Les Eyzies and its surrounding area there are no fewer than 37 rock shelter and cave sites with Upper Paleolithic art, and many more Paleolithic habitation sites in which no parietal art was found (there are ever-so-subtle traces of prehistoric art on the ceiling of the Cro-Magnon rock shelter itself ). About 8 kilometers (5 miles) outside of Les Eyzies one finds the delightfully campy Préhisto Parc, with life-size dioramas of Paleolithic peoples engaged in a variety of behaviors, such as sneaking up on a woolly rhinoceros (“I’ll take ‘Things I would never do’ for $1,200, Alex”), burying their dead, or creating art, all set in lush natural surroundings and guaranteed safer than Jurassic Park! Finally, about 24 kilometers (15 miles) upriver from Les Eyzies, on a hill just outside the town of Montignac, lies the world-renowned Paleolithic art site of Lascaux. Although the actual cave remains closed to the public due to damage to the paintings caused by visitors’ exhalations, an actual size, nearly perfectly rendered 3D model of the cave complex and its art (Lascaux IV) has been open to the public since 2016. (I was honored to be given a private tour of this wonderful facility just a few months prior to its opening.) Two Paleolithic sites at which I have worked with principal investigators Bruno Maureille and Aurélien Royer—Regourdou (open to the public) and La Balutie (hard to access and closed to the public)—are also on the same hill as Lascaux. Prehistory clearly remains a touristic draw in the Vézère Valley.\n\nDISCOVERY OF CRO-MAGNON REMAINS\n\nIn 1863, the railroad—that marvel of nineteenth-century travel and commerce— came to Les Eyzies, along the new Limoges-to-Agen line. According to Louis Lartet, to make room for the tracks in the narrow Vézère Valley just upriver from the Les Eyzies town center, some of the talus slope, a large limestone bloc, and part of\n\nDiscov ery\n\nm 13\n\na large overhang at the northeastern Cro-Magnon shelter were removed in 1863.2 However, most of the Cro-Magnon shelter remained undisturbed, and the paleoanthropologist Dominique Henry-Gambier says that in early 1868 it was still filled with (literally) tons of sediment—a massive deposit of dirt some 17 meters (56 feet) wide and 6–7 meters (20–23 feet) deep!3 Archaeologists love sediments! Archaeological sites tend to be sediment traps; if sediments are not trapped but washed away, the archaeological materials tend to be washed away as well. For Cro-Magnon, the sediment trap would be forever transformed in March 1868, when a new train station for Les Eyzies and a road to serve it were built. Some 130 meters (430 feet) southeast of the new station, railway workers began to clear land for the road, and this required removing the sediment from the main Cro-Magnon shelter. In the course of clearing the land for the road, Lartet noted that the workers first removed detritus about 4 meters (13 feet) deep from Cro-Magnon.4 They then began removing a rocky bank at the newly cleared area (some large blocks were removed with dynamite). Underneath this bank they ran into a motherlode of prehistoric debris. Most important, they uncovered evidence of human burials, including a nearly complete skull. These were no ordinary burials either. They were associated with stone tools, with shell beads that looked as if they had been strung together in necklaces or bracelets, and with broken animal bones, including those of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). Later, in 1893 or 1897, a reindeer rib was discovered at Cro-Magnon onto which had been carved an anthropomorphic figure. The importance of this find was not lost on two local entrepreneurs (Mr. Berton-Meyron and Mr. Delmarès) who had secured for the railroad company the property on which the station and road were to be built. In today’s interglacial climate, reindeer are not found in France; instead they live in much colder regions. The finds at Cro-Magnon were therefore immediately recognized as having come from the last Ice Age. It had only been three years earlier that Louis Lartet’s father, Édouard, announced the discovery at La Madeleine (just 3.2 kilometers [2 miles] upriver from Cro-Magnon), a mammoth tusk with an engraving of a mammoth on it—exciting proof of human coexistence with extinct fauna, a huge splash in the press. The people in the valley were therefore very much on the lookout for more such finds. According to Lartet’s description of the Cro-Magnon discovery, published in the Bulletins de la Société d’Anthropologie de Paris, we are fortunate that Berton-Meyron and Delmarès immediately asked Alain Laganne to come to the site.5 Laganne was a local amateur geologist and archaeologist who had been called away to Bordeaux on business. Although not formally trained, he had much practical geological and archaeological experience and for years had been the foreman\n\n14 l\n\nD iscov ery\n\nfor Louis’s father Edouard and his British colleague Henry Christy during their surveys of the Vézère Valley. Despite his lack of a university degree, Laganne was no slouch—Lartet mentions that by comparing erosion of limestone in locations where said erosion had occurred since a known date, Laganne had estimated that the limestone in the Vézère Valley erodes at a mean rate of about 15 millimeters (about half an inch) every twenty years. Although imperfect, this is an admirable attempt to quantify and extrapolate geological processes over time. Upon receiving the news of the Cro-Magnon discovery, Laganne left Bordeaux and quickly returned to Les Eyzies. Some days later, he exhumed two more crania and several other fragmented human skeletal remains from what was left of the Cro-Magnon deposits, as well as more worked reindeer bone and flint tools. Finally, here at Cro-Magnon was the evidence the scientific world had been waiting for—human bodies associated with prehistoric tools and extinct (or locally extinct) animals such as reindeer, mammoth, cave lions, and cave bear. This finding was, in a word, huge. Laganne contacted the historian Victor Duruy (1811–1894) in Paris, telling him that this fantastic discovery must be verified by formally trained experts. Duruy, who was the French education minister at the time, agreed; it is he who decided to send Louis Lartet to the site, apparently at the suggestion of Édouard Lartet. When Lartet arrived at the site, much of the sediment from within the Cro-Magnon rock shelter had already been removed, either by the railway workers or by Laganne and his team. In Lartet’s own account of the excavation, the first thing he noticed was that the roof of the shelter had a deep fissure in it, and was therefore at risk of collapse, so he installed a support column to ensure that the roof would not fall on him and his team as they worked. Having excavated rock shelters myself, I get this—I would rather not become part of the archaeological record by having a multiton shelter roof collapse on me. To secure the support pillar, Lartet needed to dig down to the bedrock, so he excavated four layers of burned material he interpreted as hearths. At the bottom of these layers was an elephant tusk (another indication of the site’s prehistoric nature) that he and a priest (Father Sanna Solaro) removed. Once the support column was in place, his team carefully excavated the remaining layers. Lartet noted that the bedrock, back wall, and roof of the Cro-Magnon shelter were composed of ancient limestone dating to the Cretaceous Period (the last age of the dinosaurs), based on the presence of fossilized coral and bryozoan colonies.6 The bed over which the rock shelter lies included a brachiopod index fossil7 that today is referred to the species Cyclothyris vespertilio, an extinct sessile, bottom-feeding sea creature.8 Thus the rocky crags of the Vézère Valley are in fact an ancient seabed that was geologically lifted 100 meters (330 feet) above sea level. Over millions of years this originally marine limestone has slowly been\n\nDiscov ery\n\nm 15\n\nF i gu r e 1.3 Reconstructed vertical profile of Cro-Magnon site, from northeast (L) to southwest (R).

Lartet’s Cro-Magnon layers are depicted in figure 1.3. From the solid limestone bedrock at the floor of the shelter up to the top, he began with the basal, and therefore oldest, level. This layer is archaeologically sterile (no human remains or\n\n16 l\n\nD iscov ery\n\nartifacts). Given its depth at about 70 centimeters (28 inches), these sediments had been accumulating in the shelter long before the first human occupants (Lartet’s “reindeer hunters”) arrived. Above these basal sediments are a series of layers, some archaeological, others sterile (including roof falls)—but nearer to the shelter roof are a series of nearly continuous occupation layers that include multiple fireplaces. Artifacts recovered from these layers are primarily made from river cobbles people brought up from the Vézère riverbed. Many of these are what archaeologists call “scrapers,” probably used for tasks such as scraping hides, but with sharp edges that may have been used for cutting or incising. Other artifacts in this layer are rounded hammerstones for either making stone tools or breaking open bones to access their fatty marrow. Still others are cores from which smaller flakes or blades were struck (the removed flakes or blades were then fashioned into various tools).9 Most tools are made from local quartz and granite. Flint was also used, and outcrops of flint are a common occurrence in Périgord limestone, but it is a rarer raw material. If we use the nearby site of Abri Pataud (near the center of Les Eyzies) as a guide, some flints were probably local, but others were acquired from sources farther away. My late Tulane colleague (and lovable curmudgeon) Harvey Bricker (1940–2017) spent years excavating in the Abri Pataud. He found that some of the flint used was locally sourced in the Vézère Valley, but other tools were made on flint from the Couze Valley, 20–25 kilometers (12–15 miles) away, and still others were made on flint from north of Bergerac, 35–40 kilometers (22–25 miles) away.10 Above these occupation levels (indeed, above the shelter roof ), an additional 4–6 meters (13–20 feet) in depth of sediments had been removed by the workers. Perhaps this material was what archaeologists refer to as “overburden”—sterile layers that overlie the archaeological material one wants to access—but it is also possible that evidence of later Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, or Iron Age deposits were simply discarded without study—we will never know. The silver lining for Lartet was that this massive quantity of sediment above the occupation levels should satisfy the scientific community that the archaeological layers lying beneath it were very ancient indeed. The human skeletons, representing at least four adults and a child, were found at the back of the cave just beneath the shelter roof (figure 1.4). The skull of the most famous of the individuals, the so-called vieillard, or “old man” of Cro-Magnon (Cro-Magnon 1; figure 1.5), had been exposed on the surface at some point postburial, given the stalagmites adhered to his cranium. Lartet reported that the bones of the other individuals were all found within a 1.5-meter (5-foot) radius of the old man’s skull.

Lartet noted that she had a wound, seemingly caused by a sharp implement, on the right side of her forehead. Broca described this injury as just above the external margin of her right orbit, measuring 33 millimeters (1.3 inches) in length and 12 millimeters (0.5 inches) wide at its thickest point. Doctors shown the skull told Lartet they suspected she had survived the wound for several weeks because there is evidence for bony healing along the edges of the injury. Right next to her skeleton were the remains of a neonate or nearly full-term fetus, begging the question: Was Cro-Magnon 2 pregnant when she died? Did she die in childbirth? Was she the victim of interpersonal violence, and if so, by whom? Broca also noted that a femur he attributed to the “old man” of Cro-Magnon shows evidence of a healed puncture in the shaft just above the knee.11 He said this could be from a projectile weapon, or the horn of an animal such as an aurochs (ancestors of domestic\n\nF i gu r e 1.6 Left lateral view of Cro-Magnon 2 cranium. Source: Courtesy of Erik Trinkaus.\n\nDiscov ery\n\nm 19\n\ncattle), or the tusk of a mammoth. In contrast, Dastugue rather convincingly argued that it was due to a systemic infection.12 In either case, life appears to have been perilous for the residents of the Cro-Magnon rock shelter! The other adult skeletons were presumed to have been males, and their remains are comingled (or were mixed during their discovery). In the midst of all these human remains were close to 300 pierced shells, the majority of which belong to the species Littorina littorea, a small marine snail. These were probably incorporated into bracelets, necklaces, or other decorative accessories associated with at least one (if not all) of the adult skeletons. The closest coast where one might find these marine animals was 150 kilometers (93 miles) away (and farther away still during their day because sea levels associated with the last Ice Age were lower), so either these reindeer hunters spent time on the coast or engaged in trade with those who did. Lartet also recovered an ivory amulet with two holes pierced in it not too far from where the human skeletons were recovered. Laganne had found a similar smaller amulet, and a schoolteacher (Mr. Grenier) gave yet another to Lartet that he claimed had been found by one of his students while visiting the site. Pierced animal teeth and worked reindeer antler were also recovered in the vicinity. Given the depth at which the skeletons were found, the sediments and roof fall levels that had overlain them, as well as their association with extinct fauna and chipped stone tools, it made sense to Lartet that the human skeletons were from the Paleolithic, or “Old Stone Age.” This makes them the first fossil Homo sapiens discovered in such an established archaeological context. I must point out, however, that scientists tend to be a skeptical bunch, and not everyone was convinced that the skeletons were that ancient. In a foreshadowing of events to come, in 1871 the prehistorian Émile Cartailhac (1845–1921) and the geologist Eugène Trutat (1840–1910) from the University of Toulouse published a paper in which they questioned the antiquity of the Aurignac human remains announced ten years earlier by Louis’s father Édouard. Dominique Henry-Gambier could not help but notice that they published this paper only after the death of the influential Lartet père.13 She also pointed out that Élie Massénat’s 1872 discovery of a skeleton of Cro-Magnon age from the site of Laugerie-Basse, in the Vézère Valley just 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) upstream from Les Eyzies, provided Cartailhac with the opportunity to question not only its age but that of the Cro-Magnon skeletons as well. Perhaps the most vocal critic of the antiquity of the Cro-Magnon skeletons was the archaeologist Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet (1821–1898). At a Société d’Anthropologie de Paris meeting in April 1876, during discussion of the growing number of sites reporting Paleolithic human remains (and their use\n\n20 l\n\nD iscov ery\n\nof shell beads), de Mortillet was particularly critical of Cro-Magnon. As transcribed by the conchologist Paul Fischer and published in the society’s Bulletins in 1876, de Mortillet said that at first he too was caught up in the excitement of the Cro-Magnon finds and had no doubt of their antiquity. However, upon further investigation, he changed his mind. He noted that most of Cro-Magnon was excavated by railroad workers or Mr. Laganne, whom he referred to as a “simple researcher” (Ouch!). These unqualified excavators worked at Cro-Magnon for several days before the arrival of Louis Lartet. As a result, Lartet, whom he at least recognized as being a qualified expert, could only study the basal layers at the site (i.e., the ones below the human skeletons). It was de Mortillet’s opinion that the Cro-Magnon site had effectively been destroyed and could not be scientifically studied. He does, however, concede a later Upper Paleolithic (Magdalenian; discussed in chapter 2) presence at the site, but he posits that the human skeletons likely come from above the Magdalenian levels and may, in fact, be more recent (perhaps Neolithic, or “New Stone Age”). His coup de grâce is the following statement: “[Cro-Magnon] was evidently a burial, but we know of no certain burials from the Magdalenian period, while those from the time of polished stone [Neolithic] are abundant in caves.”14 Spoiler alert: we now have firm radiometric dates for the Cro-Magnon skeletons; they are much older than the Magdalenian! Sadly, the site of Cro-Magnon has nothing left to tell us. In less than 50 years from the date of its initial discovery, the shelter was completely emptied of its contents. If you visit Cro-Magnon today, you will see a bare site dug down to its bedrock. The good news, however, is that within a few years additional modern human skeletons associated with extinct animals and stone tools came to light in Italy.\n\nPALEONTOLOGISTS AND PRINCES: DISCOVERIES AT THE BALZI ROSSI\n\n“Mi scusi, parla inglese o francese?” (“Excuse me, do you speak English or French?”) I ask at the ticket counter at the train station in Ventimiglia, a brightly painted Italian Riviera town clinging to the hillside at the mouth of the Roia River, and home to our next series of important Cro-Magnon sites. The gentleman behind the counter replies, “No.” I think to myself that I could just about throw a rock into France from this station, and this guy doesn’t speak French? Time to go with Plan B. “Si hablo español, puede Usted comprenderme?” (If I speak Spanish, can you understand me?) Again the response is monosyllabic, “No.”\n\nDiscov ery\n\nm 21\n\nPerhaps you have guessed that once again the year is 1994. It is June, and I am at yet another location for my dissertation research. I have two work-related destinations while staying in Ventimiglia. The first is just outside of town: the Museo dei Balzi Rossi (Museum of the Balzi Rossi), home to several important Paleolithic skeletons from the Balzi Rossi (I’ll explain what this is in just a minute). I also make day trips by train from Ventimiglia into France and on into Monaco, where more Balzi Rossi skeletons are housed at the Musée d’Anthropologie Préhistorique de Monaco (Museum of Prehistoric Anthropology of Monaco). Crossing all those international borders sounds more complicated than it actually is. The distance is only 20 kilometers (12 miles) and takes about 40 minutes by train. But my business this evening is not research related. I’m planning ahead for the weekend; in two days I intend to take the train to Massa, a coastal city not far from Pisa, to visit the paleoanthropologist Vincenzo (“Enzo”) Formicola. During my time in Europe, I have had a Eurail Pass, which has been a godsend these many months, but it has been recommended to me to reserve any seat I may need a couple of days in advance of departure. I have learned the hard way to make my reservations early. Unfortunately, I don’t speak Italian, but with my fluent (albeit very Louisiana) French and all the years of Spanish I took from fifth grade through college (I really should speak Spanish better than I do), if someone speaks slowly to me in Italian, I can usually get the gist of what they’re saying. So despite his saying no, I show him my pass and proceed to ask him in Spanish if I can reserve a ticket to Massa for Friday evening. He replies that I do not need to reserve a ticket; I can come on Friday afternoon, and there will be room on the train. I ask could I please do it now while I am here at the station? This question is apparently more than he can take; I’ve struck a nerve. He launches into a scalding lecture in rapid-fire Italian. I don’t quite catch everything he says, but I do get that now is the time in Italy when people go home to their families to eat dinner. I apologize. I don’t want to be a culturally insensitive American; I am an anthropologist after all! I figure this guy is just about ready to end his shift to head home, so I decide to go get something to eat myself. A couple of hours later I happen to pass by the station. Maybe someone new is at the counter who will be willing to help me. I walk in and the same guy is behind the counter. I say to him (in Spanish): “I thought you went home for dinner.” He responds “no,” that he has to work this evening. I ask him if I can reserve my ticket now? His response will probably not surprise you. “No.”\n\n3\n\n22 l\n\nD iscov ery\n\nThe Grimaldi Caves are a cluster of caves and rock shelters on the Italian Riviera,15 just 400 meters (a quarter of a mile) from the French border, on high cliffs overlooking a stretch of the Mediterranean coast more akin to Big Sur than to Miami Beach. The nearest towns are Menton, France, to the west, and Ventimiglia, Italy, to the east. The caves lie in a suburb of Ventimiglia known as Grimaldi di Ventimiglia, named for the powerful Grimaldi family. This family is associated with the former Republic of Genoa and the current Principality of Monaco, where by law the royal family must use the Grimaldi surname. Indeed, much of the funding for the excavation of the caves at the turn of the last century was provided by Prince Albert I of Monaco. The geological feature in which the Grimaldi Caves are found is known as the Balzi Rossi (“Red Cliffs” in Italian), so named because the limestone has iron inclusions that give them a ruddy color. The caves are rich in archaeological deposits, and people have been excavating there since at least the early nineteenth century (figure 1.7). Given their proximity to France, and the fact that their initial study was conducted by francophone scholars (some funded by the Prince of Monaco), the caves are frequently discussed in the literature by their French names rather than their Italian ones. From west to east, the major Grimaldi Caves (with their Italian names first, followed by French and English translations, when appropriate) are Grotta dei Fanciulli (Grotte des Enfants or Cave of Children),\n\nF i gu r e 1.7 Map showing the locations of the major caves and rock shelters at the Balzi Rossi.

By 1868, the year the Cro-Magnon skeletons were discovered, locals and foreigners alike had been excavating in the Grimaldi Caves for decades. Prince Florestano I of Monaco recovered animal bones and stone tools there in 1846 (giving the Cave of the Prince its name), and Paul Broca dug in the Grimaldi Caves in 1865. None of these early excavations was terribly systematic, and few finds were reported in the scientific literature. This changed with the work of a young French physician named Émile Rivière (1835–1932). In January 1870, Rivière moved to the French Riviera town of Menton, just across the border from the Balzi Rossi, to open his medical practice. By October 1870, however, he was spending much of his free time excavating in the Grimaldi Caves. He was soon rewarded with some magnificent finds, beginning in March 1872 with the primary burial of an adult human skeleton from the Barma del Caviglione. This individual was recovered a full 6.55 meters (21.5 feet) below what was then the cave floor. Its entire body was stained with red ochre, and it wore a cap, or some form of headdress, adorned with pierced shells and deer teeth. The occupation level directly overlying the Barma del Caviglione skeleton had hearths with worked stone tools and the bones of extinct animals (cave bears, cave lions, and cave hyenas), so Rivière was confident that this, like the then-recent finds at Cro-Magnon, was Paleolithic in age. The skeleton would become known in France as “l’Homme de Menton” (Menton Man). The entire specimen was removed en bloc and has been in Paris since 1872, where it long awaited formal scientific analysis, which was finally published in 2016.16 Perhaps the most interesting conclusion drawn in that book is that the bioanthropologist Jaroslav Brůžek, using new techniques to analyze the specimen’s pelvis, has determined that Menton Man was female! More finds of Paleolithic human skeletons soon followed. In 1873 Rivière discovered skeletons of two adults (BT1 and BT2) and one adolescent (BT3) while excavating the Baousso da Torre. The adolescent was buried face down, which is unusual (we’ll see this again at a different site in chapter 9). The two adults were covered in red ochre. For more than 80 years, BT1 and BT3 were thought to have been lost to science, but they were rediscovered in 2008 in the collections of the Musée Lorrain in the French city of Nancy by Sébastien Villotte and Dominique Henry-Gambier.\n\n24 l\n\nD iscov ery\n\nRivière next discovered two child burials at the Grotte des Enfants (giving the site its name) in 1874 and 1875. These two skeletons (Grotte des Enfants 1 and 2), the first four to six years of age and the second about four years old, were found buried side-by-side about 2.7 meters (9 feet) below what was then the cave floor. Each had been wearing clothing adorned with pierced shells. Rivière argued that the nature of the treatment of the dead was different for adults and for children. Children were intentionally buried in a pit, he said, whereas adults were covered with ochre and left on the cave floor. In 1883, Rivière began excavating at the Barma Grande and recovered archaeological material. The most important find, however, was made by the foreman of quarry workers employed at the site, Mr. Louis Julien, who was known to trade in antiquities—a huge “red flag” for archaeologists. In February 1884, Julien discovered a beautifully preserved large male skeleton (Barma Grande 1) some 8.4 meters (28 feet) below the cave surface. He was lying on his back—with three big flint flakes, one at the top of his head and the other two placed on the shoulders as if they were epaulets, and a thick “cap” of red ochre laid on his head— indicating to Rivière that he had been intentionally buried by members of his own group or family. Julien made arrangements to have the skeleton sent to a small museum in Menton. Unfortunately, only part of the material was sent; the rest was destroyed in a dispute over who had rights to the skeleton.17 Despite the depth at which these specimens were found, their geological age was controversial. One problem is that at many, if not all, of the Grimaldi Caves there was mixing of archaeological levels via postdepositional processes. Archaeologists today refer to the study of these and other processes that impact site integrity as taphonomy. Even though he supported an ancient age for the caves, Rivière acknowledged this phenomenon. In dismissing de Mortillet’s argument that the burials were Neolithic or Magdalenian, Rivière argued that the entire sequence in the Grimaldi Caves, top to bottom, was Pleistocene in age. Yet, at the same time, he admitted that tools from the Mousterian (associated with Neandertals in Europe; chapters 2 and 3) and the much later Magdalenian were often found side-by-side in the same levels with no evidence of any disconformity between them! Despite this mixing of levels, most scientists in the 1870s were convinced the Grimaldi skeletons were Paleolithic; only a handful of scholars (most notably Moggridge and de Mortillet) thought otherwise. In 1892, an unfortunate turn of events occurred at the Barma Grande. The landowner, Francesco Abbo, had destroyed Baousso da Torre by quarrying limestone in it, and he began to quarry in a haphazard way in the Barma Grande as well. On February 7, 1892, his workers uncovered a second large male skeleton (Barma Grande 2, BG2) near the cave entrance, not far from where Julien had\n\nDiscov ery\n\nm 25\n\nF i gu r e 1.8 The Barma Grande 3 and 4 adolescent skeletons in situ.

A few days later, two additional skeletons (BG3 and BG4) were discovered next to it in what appeared to be the same burial pit (figure 1.8). News of the find quickly spread, and the biological anthropologist René Verneau (1852–1938) was tasked by the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle de Paris to study them. When he arrived, he noted that all three individuals had been laid in a single burial pit, although most of the pit walls had been removed before his arrival.18 The British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans (1851–1941) was also at Barma Grande around the time of discovery and published the following observations in 1893. First, BG2 was an impressively large individual. According to Evans, the length from his heel to his shoulder was 1.85 meters, almost 6 ft. 1 in., without taking into account his head or neck!19 A long flint knife lay close to his left hand, and about his head and neck were ornaments of pierced shell, teeth, and bones. The skeleton next to him (BG3) was recognized as a late adolescent female. She was not as decorated as BG2, but she was also holding a flint blade. The third skeleton (BG4), behind the presumed female, was another adolescent.\n\n26 l\n\nD iscov ery\n\nThis individual was said to have had a flint blade located near the head. Verneau suggests that BG4 was wearing a necklace made of pierced and incised red deer canines and shells.20 Verneau had sexed the two adolescents as female (BG3) and male (BG4), but his assignments are uncertain because subadult skeletons have yet to develop their secondary sexual characteristics. Unfortunately, we can no longer assess their sex using their pelves; these were destroyed in World War II. That said, Formicola and Holt report that genetic analyses confirm that the large Barma Grande 2 skeleton is male, and preliminary results suggest that both adolescent skeletons are female.21 Evans relates an unfortunate story about his second visit to Barma Grande sometime later that month. He says Mr. Abbo had assured him he was safeguarding the Barma Grande ornamental pieces in his house, but when Evans arrived there, they and several other artifacts had disappeared. To make matters worse, Evans claims that although Abbo had been making quite a bit of money charging visitors a franc a piece to visit the site, he “did practically nothing to protect the skeletons, which in a few weeks’ time were so trodden under foot as to be almost past recognition.”22 Verneau is less harsh with the landowner, stating that in spite of Abbo’s attempts to set up a barrier at the cave entrance many curious visitors showed up at the site, causing damage to the skeletons. (Verneau makes no mention of an entrance fee.)23 Throughout this time, quarrying at Barma Grande continued unabated, and in January 1894, Abbo recovered a fifth (BG5) skeleton near the back of the cave. Shortly thereafter a sixth skeleton (BG6) was recovered, one Verneau interpreted as burnt, a conclusion disputed by more recent scholarship.24 Good news finally emerged around this time as well. Prince Albert I of Monaco, the grandson of Florestano I, had, like his grandfather, excavated in the caves bearing his family name back in 1882. Increasingly worried about the destruction of the caves, in 1895 he funded scientific investigation of the sites, especially its human skeletons. He put a priest (and Monaco’s chief librarian), Léonce de Villeneuve (1858–1946), in charge of the project. This may seem an odd choice, but de Villeneuve had extensive archaeological experience. To help with the work, de Villeneuve brought onboard many of the top scholars of the day, all of whom happen to be French: Émile Cartailhac, an archaeologist from the University of Toulouse (discussed earlier), charged with the task of exhuming any human skeletons; Marcellin Boule (1861–1942), a paleontologist at the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris and a former student of Cartailhac, whose primary responsibility was to examine the fauna (he later became famous for his description of the important La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1 Neandertal); and the biological anthropologist René Verneau, who had already studied\n\nDiscov ery\n\nm 27\n\nthe previously excavated Grimaldi skeletons. This project, funded by the prince and led by the priest, continued until 1905, culminating in a series of ahead-oftheir-time monographs published in 1906. Beginning in 1900, this “Dream Team” hit the motherlode in the Grotte des Enfants. Cartailhac found conclusive proof that the inhumations are just that—intentional burials of prehistoric humans; but perhaps more important, Cartailhac, once skeptical of Paleolithic burial, was now convinced that the artifacts associated with these burials, and the layers from which they were drawn, were distinctly Paleolithic in character. Boule found that the relevant fauna from all levels of the site were Pleistocene, or “Ice Age” in character. This points to a group of Ice Age hunter-gatherers living in complex societies—exciting new examples of Cro-Magnon people. There are new burials too—four, to be exact—from the Grotte des Enfants. They come from a host of different levels—one (Grotte des Enfants 3; now known to be later than the others) is only 1.9 meters (6 feet) below the surface. An adult female, she was buried with a wild boar jaw, several flint flakes, and two pierced shells. A second skeleton (Grotte des Enfants 4) was found in much deeper deposits, about 7 meters (23 feet) below the surface. A large adult male, he was not lavishly adorned, but pierced red deer teeth were recovered near his head, and there are pierced shells among his left ribs. Finally, two skeletons (Grotte des Enfants 5 and 6) were found deeper still, some 7.75 meters (25 feet) below the surface. Grotte des Enfants 5 is an older adult female; Grotte des Enfants 6 is an adolescent male. It appears that the female is an intrusive primary burial into the earlier burial of the adolescent male (it is uncertain how many intervening years there were between the two burials). He has four rows of pierced shells on his head, as if they were attached to some form of headdress, and several flint blades were found between the two skeletons. She has a pierced shell bracelet around her wrist, and pierced shells were found under her tibia. The fauna Boule catalogs in this deepest layer include cave bears, cave hyenas, cave lions, rhinoceros, elephant, and hippopotamuses. This not only indicates Pleistocene age but suggests an earlier, warmer period within the Pleistocene than the so-called Reindeer Age.25 To Boule this means the layer is very ancient indeed. The Grotte des Enfants 4 skeleton is associated with many of the same mammals. Boule had spent years excavating Mousterian sites in the Périgord, so he interpreted this to mean that these modern-looking skeletons may have been contemporaries of the Neandertals (or at least the earliest of the Grimaldi skeletons were only slightly later in time than their much more primitive-looking cousins). Grotte des Enfants 3 is associated with red deer, fallow deer, and ibex—fauna that still inhabit the area today—but the big cats recovered in the deeper levels\n\n28 l\n\nD iscov ery\n\nare absent. Although reindeer are also absent, the faunal profile of this level is similar to those in neighboring caves in which reindeer were recovered. As such, Boule characterized this most recent burial as from the Reindeer Age, roughly contemporary with the fossil humans from Cro-Magnon. All the skeletons, including the three found in early, warmer-climate contexts, had been placed in distinct burial pits dug for them by their fellow group members. Verneau argued that it is no longer tenable to claim that Paleolithic hunter-gatherers did not bury their dead. He also critiqued Rivière, who had said the first skeleton at Baousso da Torre and the one from Barma del Caviglione had been left exposed on the cave’s surface. Verneau pointed out that there has been nearly constant occupation of the Grimaldi Cave sites, with stacks of archaeological layers, and features such as fireplaces cutting into other, earlier occupation layers. Living next to a decomposing corpse is not something people tend to do, so he suspected that, similar to the burial pits he documented, the adult skeletons Rivière had recovered were also buried in pits. Thus, by the early years of the twentieth century, the Grimaldi Caves had yielded multiple intentional burials by Paleolithic hunter-gatherers. These burials were recovered under controlled excavations by recognized experts. Given the ornamentation associated with them, despite their antiquity these ancient people were clearly intelligent beings who lived in complex and artistic societies. The next chapter explains how Paleolithic archaeologists study these ancient people.\n\n2 Archaeology of the Ancients\n\nI\n\nt’s June 18, 1999, about an hour after sunrise. This time of year the sun rises early, so I’m not yet fully awake. All I hear is the barely audible purr of the small automobile engine as we motor down a rural backroad. What’s overwhelming is the morning light. It’s almost blinding as it shines down on the smooth grass-covered rise some 50 meters (55 yards) to our left. To our right is the massive Pálava Hill (elevation 484 meters [1,587 feet]), the westernmost Carpathian mountain that dominates the landscape for miles. Aside from Pálava, the land is a rolling plain as far as the eye can see. We are in the greater Danube Valley. Atop the rise to our left, a man and a woman are screening—buckets of dirt have been emptied into a large box with a screen bottom, and the two are now vigorously shaking the box screen. As they shake, dirt falls through the screen, leaving artifacts and a cloud of dust behind, so these two are obviously archaeologists. It reminds me of the scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark in which the archaeological crew is screening up on an Egyptian hill with the setting sun behind them. I find it funny that we’re watching people do archaeology because there are three archaeologists in the car with me. The Czech archaeologist Jiří Svoboda, an expert in lithic technology, is driving. We three passengers are all Americans: me, Olga Soffer, and James “Jim” Adovasio. Olga specializes in the Upper Paleolithic of Central and Eastern Europe; Jim is best known for having accidentally discovered an amazing pre-Clovis1 site in western Pennsylvania called Meadowcroft Rockshelter. We have all been staying at the Paleolithic and Paleoethnology Research Center in the tiny Czech village of Dolní Věstonice, just 11.3 kilometers\n\n30 l\n\nA r c h a eo l o gy o f t h e A n c i en ts\n\n(7 miles) north of the Austrian border. Jiří lives in Dolní Věstonice most of the year. I’ve been here for a few weeks studying the ribs and vertebrae of the Upper Paleolithic skeletons from Dolní Věstonice and the neighboring village of Pavlov. Olga and Jim are examining 31,000-year-old archaeological evidence for basketry and textiles from Dolní Věstonice—exciting stuff, and I’ve really enjoyed getting to know them. This morning we’re headed to Vienna to see a talk on Neandertals by the Croatian paleoanthropologist Jakov Radovčić. I’ve been looking forward to this trip all week. It’s Jiří who breaks the silence. “That’s my friend’s site up there.” “What kind of site is it?” Olga asks. “It’s a Roman fortification.” She exhales audibly in disgust as she says, “Current events!”\n\n3 Paleolithic archaeologists study time periods that are so old that they really do make “ancient Rome” look like “current events.” I’ll demonstrate this with a simple analogy: our human lineage split from the chimpanzee-bonobo lineage around 8 million years ago.2 Imagine that these 8 million years are instead the distance of the cross-country road trip from the Empire State Building in New York City to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in California—a road trip of some 2,785 miles. We leave New York City 8 million years ago as the first hominins. The earliest stone tools, known as Lomekwian, are about 3.3 million years old. Along our cross-country road trip we don’t encounter these tools until we’re in McClean, Texas, 74 miles east of Amarillo and just 35 miles west of the Texas-Oklahoma border. The earliest Oldowan tools, smaller than those of the Lomekwian, show up around 2.6 million years ago. We first encounter them in Santa Rosa, New Mexico, about 120 miles east of Albuquerque. At this point we’re already twothirds of the way through our journey. In contrast, the maximum extent of the Roman Empire occurred under Emperor Trajan in the year 117 CE. We encounter this about 7/10 of a mile away from the Walk of Fame, as we turn from the exit off of the Hollywood Freeway onto Hollywood Boulevard itself ! In this light, there’s nothing “ancient” about ancient Rome. But while I laughed at Olga’s joke, in the grand scheme of things, the sites at Dolní Věstonice are not so terribly ancient either. At 31,000 years old, we ran into them just 10.8 miles from our destination, as we passed the Monterey Park Golf Club in Los Angeles, 4.5 miles east of downtown.\n\nA r c h a eo l o gy o f t h e A n c i en ts\n\nm 31\n\nTHE HISTORY OF HUMAN TECHNOLOGY\n\nIn 1817, the Danish antiquarian Christian Jürgensen Thomsen (1788–1865) arranged artifacts in his museum according to his view of the history of human technology as a three-age system—a system still used today, albeit with modification. The earliest tools were made of stone; these he called Stone Age. Around 5,000 years ago, however, humans learn how to alloy copper with tin to make bronze; these belong to the Bronze Age.3 Sometime later, around 3,200 years ago, humans created fires hot enough to smelt iron; thus begins the Iron Age. In 1865 the English Baron John Lubbock (1834–1913) split the Stone Age into early and late components. The early Stone Age is marked by chipped stone tools; Lubbock called this the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. Later Stone Age tools, made of smoothed or polished stone and often found with pottery, Lubbock named the Neolithic or New Stone Age. These distinctions remain with us, with the addition of the Mesolithic, spanning the phase between the Paleolithic and Neolithic, characterized by small, sharp pieces of stone called microliths. There are a few caveats here. One is that in the Paleolithic we tend to focus on lithic (stone) artifacts simply because of stone’s durability. However, our closest living relatives (chimpanzees and bonobos) make and use tools in the wild, primarily from perishable materials such as sticks and leaves; Occam’s razor would suggest that early hominins also made tools from perishable materials—tools unlikely to appear in the archaeological record. These tools could very well date back to the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees more than 8 million years ago. Keep in mind, too, that some groups of wild chimpanzees use hammerstones and anvils (at times anvils made of stone) to break open nuts. Unfortunately, in the archaeological record, tools like this would be hard to distinguish from randomly trampled or bashed rocks. Unless the use of multiple hammerstones and anvils had been concentrated in the same spot for long periods, the probability of finding any site containing them would be vanishingly small indeed. Human lithic technology that can be detected in the archaeological record has its humble beginnings about 3.3 million years ago at the site of Lomekwi, just west of Lake Turkana in Kenya (figure 2.1). Here some hominins figured out that sharp edges could be created by striking rocks together, and these rocks could then be used for a variety of tasks. By archaeological convention, the rock that is struck by a hammerstone is called a “core” and the piece that is knocked off is a “flake.” Archaeologists call this process of chipping stone “knapping.” There are\n\n32 l\n\nA r c h a eo l o gy o f t h e A n c i en ts\n\nF i gu r e 2 . 1 African and West Asian archaeological and paleontological sites mentioned in the book. Source: Author’s map.\n\nhammerstones and apparent anvils present among the artifacts at Lomekwi, and these appear to be much larger and heavier than those used by wild chimpanzees.4 It is this Lomekwian industry that marks the beginning of the Paleolithic, which in terms of time comprises over 99 percent of the archaeological record.5 The Paleolithic is said to have ended 11,700 years ago, with the beginning of the Holocene epoch, but in one sense it never really goes away. In the ethnographic\n\nA r c h a eo l o gy o f t h e A n c i en ts\n\nm 33\n\npresent, humans are known to make expedient stone tools whenever they need a quickly and easily made sharp edge. Once chipped stone tool use had been established, you might think it would be such a fundamental technological innovation that it would never disappear. Although we must be mindful of the adage that “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,” there seems to be about a 700,000-year hiatus in hominin stone tool use after the Lomekwian. Despite having multiple locales in eastern Africa with sediments dating to less than 3.3 million and more than 2.6 million years ago, we have no evidence for stone tools anywhere in the region for this period (table 2.1). Around 2.6 million years ago, at sites like Gona in Ethiopia, we begin to find evidence of a new chipped stone tool industry—the Oldowan. Although based on the same principle of creating sharp edges by knocking rocks together, Oldowan tools tend to be much smaller, easily fit in the palm of the hand, and their makers appear to have had a better understanding of the conchoidal fracture mechanics of stone. It also seems likely that the makers of the Oldowan employed a freehand knapping technique in which the core is held in one hand and struck with a hammerstone held in the other. In contrast, the makers of the Lomekwian (species unknown) tended to employ either a passive-hammer technique, in which the core is held in both hands and struck against a large, hard, stationary object, or a bipolar technique, in which the core is placed on an anvil and struck with a hammerstone to knock off a flake. These two types of manufacture have much more in common with the way chimpanzees use stone tools in the wild, and the Lomekwian may therefore be a bridge between a nut-cracking technology with one more focused on creating sharp edges. The Oldowan was first described by the archaeologist Mary Leakey (1913–1996), who discovered what were then the oldest-known stone tools in 1.8-million-year-old levels at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania in the 1950s and 1960s. Leakey grouped the cores she found into a variety of tool types such as spheroids, choppers, scrapers, and discoids, based on shape and presumed function. Most Oldowan tools were unifacially worked (i.e., had flakes removed from only one side of the core), but a sizable proportion were bifacially worked (i.e., had flakes removed from two sides). We do not know that these tools were used in the way Leakey’s names suggest, and many appear to have been multipurpose tools. Use-wear analysis tells us that in many cases the flakes were used as tools as well. The earliest artifacts in Europe are Oldowan, including the 1.75-million-yearold Dmanisi site in Georgia6 and the 1.4-million-year-old Orce sites in Spain.\n\nTable 2.1 Chronology of Lower Paleolithic industries in the Old World (dates approximate) Years BP\n\nAfrica\n\nWest Asia\n\nEurope\n\nEast Asia\n\nto ca. 170 ka\n\nto ca. 300 ka\n\nto ca. 140 ka\n\nto ca. 55 ka\n\n600 ka Acheulean 800 ka 1.0 Ma\n\nAcheulean (some places)\n\n1.2 Ma 1.4 Ma\n\nAcheulean\n\n1.6 Ma Acheulean 1.8 Ma\n\nOldowan-like\n\nOldowan-like\n\n2.0 Ma Oldowan-like 2.2 Ma 2.4 Ma 2.6 Ma\n\nOldowan\n\n2.8 Ma No stone tools 3.0 Ma 3.2 Ma Lomekwian\n\nNo stone tools\n\nNo stone tools\n\nNo stone tools\n\n3.4 Ma Note: The Middle Paleolithic was well established across the Old World by ca. 200 ka (200,000 years ago), but the Acheulean survived later than this in many locations.

It measures 10.8 centimeters (4.25 inches) in length, with a maximum width of 6.1 centimeters (2.4 inches). Source: Photo by author.\n\nHowever, another more technologically sophisticated industry, the Acheulean, first appears in Africa more than 1.7 million years ago, and it eventually spreads across Africa and into much of the rest of the Old World. These tools are almost all bifacially worked, and the hallmark of this industry is the hand ax, a teardrop-shaped biface that was likely the “Swiss army knife” of the Paleolithic—a source of smaller sharp flakes when needed, and a larger, more robust, cutting edge if the job called for one (figure 2.2). As their name suggests, these tools do not appear to have been hafted onto handles/shafts but were handheld. It is also during this industry, about 700,000 years ago, that hominins discovered softer materials such as antler, bone, or wood could be used as hammers to knock smaller, thinner flakes off a stone core. This “soft hammer” technique persists throughout the Paleolithic. Why is the hand ax industry called the Acheulean? The first hand axes known to science were discovered in France by Boucher de Perthes (chapter 1), but the physician Marcel-Jérôme Rigollot (1786–1854) later found many in the town of Saint-Acheul. The industry thereafter became known as the Acheulean (sometimes spelled Acheulian). It is replaced by more sophisticated technology around 200,000 years ago, although it survived later than this in many places (see table 2.1).\n\n36 l\n\nA r c h a eo l o gy o f t h e A n c i en ts\n\nThe Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age, is now further subdivided into three main phases: the Lower, Middle, and Upper Paleolithic. The Lomekwian, Oldowan, and Acheulean industries represent the Lower Paleolithic. These are industries in which most of the identifiable tool types are modified cores, with the proportion of bifacially worked tools increasing from the Lomekwian to the Oldowan to the so-called Developed Oldowan to the Acheulean. The technological innovation that separates the Middle Paleolithic from these Lower Paleolithic industries is that in the Middle Paleolithic most tools are made not on cores but on flakes. As early as 500,000 years ago, knapping methods known as “prepared-core” techniques appeared, and by 200,000 years ago they were widely distributed across the western Old World. Adoption of these techniques marked the beginning of the Middle Paleolithic. The most famous of these techniques is the Levallois technique, named for the Paris suburb in which it was first experimentally recreated by modern-day knappers. In this process, an area of a core is carefully prepared using a soft hammer to knock off a series of small flakes in a radial fashion, turning the core in the hand after each strike such that the worked side of the core looks a bit like a tortoise shell. Once the area has been shaped to the knapper’s satisfaction, the core is struck with a large hard hammer, and the preshaped side is dislodged from the core. Unlike in the Lower Paleolithic, this flake, not the original core, is now the desired tool. However, more pre-prepared flakes may later be dislodged from the same core, depending on its size. There is variation both in space and time in Middle Paleolithic industries. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the most common Middle Paleolithic industry is called the Middle Stone Age (MSA). It has high levels of technological variability and shows similarities to the European Upper Paleolithic (chapter 7). In northwestern Africa, primarily in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, and sometimes as far east as the western desert of Egypt, is a Middle Paleolithic industry known as the Aterian (figure 2.3), in which almost every tool has a “tang” on it—a small projection used to help haft the tool into a shaft. Unlike the Lower Paleolithic, in which most tools appear to have been handheld, in the Middle Paleolithic there is evidence for frequent hafting of stone tools into wood, bone, or antler shafts. The Middle Paleolithic industry most relevant to the subject matter of this book is the Mousterian (figure 2.4), named for the Vézère Valley site of Le Moustier, first dug by Édouard Lartet and Henry Christy in the 1860s. In Europe, the Mousterian thus far appears to be solely the work of Neandertals. However, in\n\nA r c h a eo l o gy o f t h e A n c i en ts\n\nm 37\n\nF i gu r e 2 .3 Two Aterian lithic artifacts from Oued Djebbana, Algeria, each in three views.

In Europe, however, Cro-Magnons appear to have made only Upper Paleolithic tools. The European Upper Paleolithic, the industry produced by Cro-Magnons, is characterized by long, parallel-sided blades that are “punched” off cores, as well as frequent use of bone and antler as raw materials. It is further subdivided into temporospatial industries. For the interested reader,\n\n38 l\n\nA r c h a eo l o gy o f t h e A n c i en ts\n\nF i gu r e 2 . 4 Mousterian lithic artifacts.

There are two types of chronology: relative and absolute. Relative chronology is the statement that artifact or layer “A” is older than artifact or layer “B.” This is done by\n\nB OX 2 .1. EU R O P E A N U P P E R PA L E O L I T H I C I N D U S T R I E S The earliest Upper Paleolithic industries in Europe are grouped under the umbrella term Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP) and show both Middle and Upper Paleolithic elements. Which hominin species are responsible for the IUP remains controversial. At Mandrin, France (Neronian industry), and Bacho Kiro, Bulgaria (Bachokirian industry), we now know the IUP makers (54,000–46,000 BP) were modern humans (table 2.2; chapter 8). A particularly controversial IUP industry is the Châtelperronian, a regional industry from France and northeastern Spain dating from about 44,000 to 40,000 years ago. Long considered an Upper Paleolithic industry because of its high proportion of blade tools, its type fossil, the Châtelperron knife, is a backed blade with a dulled side, either for the hand or for hafting to a shaft (chapter 10). It is also characterized by a significant number of tools made of bone and antler, as well as personal ornaments. There is debate as to whether the Châtelperronian was made by Neandertals, whether the Neandertals invented it, or if it represents imitation of modern human technology by Neandertals (chapter 8). Other IUP industries include the Uluzzian in Italy and Greece, the Bohunician in Czechia, and the Szeletian in Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland (table 2.2). Here, too, there is no agreement on who is responsible for these industries—early modern humans or Neandertals (chapter 8). Another Early Upper Paleolithic industry appears almost simultaneously across the breadth of Europe: the Aurignacian, dating from about 43,000 to 29,000 years ago. The type fossil of this industry is the split-based bone point, split at its base to facilitate hafting onto a shaft; it is almost certainly a projectile weapon (chapter 10). At many sites, the Aurignacian proper is preceded by an industry known as the Protoaurignacian, which lacks split-based bone points, instead having tiny curved blades called Dufour bladelets (chapter 8). The Protoaurignacian and the Aurignacian are thus far only associated with modern humans. The Gravettian temporally overlaps with the Aurignacian, dating from about 35,000 to 21,000 years ago, and it shows a higher proportion of prismatic blades than the Aurignacian. Its type fossil is the Gravette stone point, which functioned as a knife, a projectile weapon, or possibly both. The Gravettian is also marked by “laurel leaf ” shaped points (chapter 10). In Western Europe the Solutrean follows the Gravettian. Dating from about 24,000 to 18,000 years ago, this industry appears during the coldest time in the last 120,000 years (the Last Glacial Maximum [LGM]; chapter 12). Its type fossil is the shouldered point; the shoulder is used to embed the point in a haft. These points are almost certainly projectile weapons. In Italy and Central/Eastern Europe, there is no Solutrean; instead, an Epigravettian industry follows the Gravettian. The last Upper Paleolithic industry in Western Europe is the Magdalenian, dating from about 18,000 to 12,000 years ago, a climatically variable period colder than today but warmer than the LGM (chapter 12). This industry is famous for its cave art and complex tools made from antler and bone (chapter 11) and is contemporary with late Epigravettian industries in Italy and Central and Eastern Europe. These final Paleolithic industries are sometimes followed by a brief “Epipaleolithic” phase, beginning about 11,500 years ago (chapter 12) in which most lithics are smaller versions of Upper Paleolithic tools. The Epipaleolithic grades into the Mesolithic about 10,000 years ago. The Mesolithic has a simplified stone tool kit characterized primarily by small sharp implements known as microliths (chapter 10).\n\n28 ka 30 ka 32 ka\n\n26 ka\n\n24 ka\n\n22 ka\n\n20 ka\n\n14 ka 16 ka 18 ka\n\n12 ka\n\n10 ka\n\n8 ka\n\n6 ka\n\nGravettian (to ca. 26 ka) Modern Humans\n\nSolutrean (to ca. 18 ka) Modern Humans Proto-Solutrean (to ca. 23 ka) Modern Humans\n\nMagdalenian (to ca. 12 ka) Modern Humans\n\nMesolithic (to ca. 7 ka) Modern Humans Azilian / Asturian Modern Humans\n\nNeolithic (to ca. 4 ka) Modern Humans\n\nYears cal BP Iberia/France\n\nGravettian (to ca. 25 ka) Modern Humans\n\nEpigravettian (to ca. 11 ka) Modern Humans\n\nSauveterrian/Mesolithic (to ca. 7 ka) Modern Humans\n\nNeolithic (to ca. 4 ka) Modern Humans\n\nItaly\n\nEpigravettian (to ca. 12 ka) Modern Humans\n\nMagdalenian (to ca. 12 ka) Modern Humans\n\nNeolithic (to ca. 5 ka) Modern Humans Mesolithic (to ca. 7 ka) Modern Humans\n\nCentral Europe\n\nEpigravettian (to ca. 12 ka) Modern Humans\n\nNeolithic (to ca. 5 ka) Modern Humans Epipaleolithic (to ca. 9 ka) Modern Humans\n\nBalkan Peninsula\n\nTable 2.2 Chronology of archaeological industries and their associated hominins from regions of Europe, about 56 ka cal.

How much older? It is often hard to tell without having a firm grasp of sedimentation rates at the site in question. Remember Laganne estimating Vézère Valley erosion rates? This is more or less the converse principle. Knowing that one layer is older than another is useful information, but what many of us want to know is a skeleton’s, artifact’s, or layer’s exact age, and this is the realm of absolute dates. In Classical archaeology, researchers use historical records to determine exact dates. We know, for example, from Pliny the Younger that Mount Vesuvius erupted for two days beginning on August 24, 79 CE, burying towns such as Pompeii and Herculaneum under a deep blanket of ash.7 Unfortunately, we have no such historical records for the Paleolithic, so we must rely on radiometric dates. With some exceptions, radiometric dates are based on radioactive isotopes and their known rates of radioactive decay. In addition to a known rate of decay, all radiometric “clocks” need a zeroing mechanism—a time at which the clock starts running. For the Upper Paleolithic, the most widely used radiometric dating method is the first such method developed: radiocarbon, or carbon-14 (14C) dating. All living things are largely composed of organic (carbon) compounds. Plants make these compounds from the carbon dioxide (CO2) they take in from the air or "
