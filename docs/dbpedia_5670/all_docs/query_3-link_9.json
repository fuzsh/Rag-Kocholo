        "text": "Sep 20 1840 in Monongalia County, Virginia..\n\nCaptain\n\nJohn Dent wrote on his application for a Revolutionary War pension that he\n\nwas born February 13, 1755, in Loudoun county, Virginia. In the spring of\n\n1776 when he was 21 years old, he crossed the Blue Ridge, Shenandoah, and\n\nAllegheny mountains into the virtually unsettled wilderness ofMonongalia\n\ncounty, Virginia (now West Virginia). He no doubt followed much thesome\n\nroute across the mountains that George Washington had pioneered 20 years\n\nbefore. A year before he made this pioneering trek, the battles of Lexington\n\nand Concord in Massachusetts had signalled the beginning of the American\n\nRevolution.\n\nIn April of 1777, a year after his arrival in Monongalia county, John Dent\n\nenlisted as a private under Capt. David Scott in the Thirteenth Virginia\n\nRegiment of Militia to fight in this war. John Dent's service in the\n\nAmerican Revolution is described in Gleanings of Virgina History by William\n\nF. Boogher:\n\n\"Marched to Ft. Pitt, then to Ft. Kittanning, where he remained two months.\n\nIn the fall of 1777, as Sergeant, with twelve men, marched to a point near\n\nWheeling, where they built a fort. In the spring of 1778 was appointed\n\nlieutenant of Capt. Jacobus Sullivan's company, under Gen. Mclntosh; marched\n\ntoBeaver Creek, where they built a fort. In the fall of 1778 marched to\n\nTuscaroahriver, where they built Fort Lawrence, February. 1779, marched to\n\nFort Pitt. where he commanded seventy-five men to harass the Indians. In the\n\nWinter of 1779-80 he returned to Fort Mc Intosh, where he was in command, by\n\norder of Col. Gibson, of cavalry company in pursuit of deserters, where he\n\nremained until November 1780, when he resigned,\" (The forts mentioned were\n\non or near the upper Ohio river where it is the boundary between West\n\nVirginia and Ohio.)\n\nA pension certificate dated September 4, 1834, shows John Dent entitled to a\n\npension of $320 per year beginning March 4, 1831, for his\n\nimagine that he must have left Wales because of some sort of financial difficulty... too hard to make a living in Wales....? Or was it a search for adventure? So he moves to America in search of a better life... and, boy, does he find it! In a few years, he accumulates enough property to leave something substantial to each of his children. He would die in Maryland. His son Samuel would make the move to Pennsylvania. And it was our patriot Hugh who would migrate with a whole constellation of relatives and inlaws to 3,000 acres in Ohio....\n\nOnly George would make it all the way to the deep South.\n\nWell...there's my story about my genealogical \"find\" which came just in time for my birthday.... a gift from the genealogy angels.\n\nIf anyone has information on either Evans wives: Elizabeth Hall or Lavinia Simpson, please share!\n\nRenee\n\nin St. Louis\n\nHi Renee,\n\nI am so excited with your discovery.\n\nIn my tree, I have Richard from Wales and that he died in Maryland. I only have Samuel, his son, b. 1692 Wales, d. after 1746 in Maryland.\n\nHe had two wives and 11 children.\n\nHis son, Hugh Evans, married first Sara Harden in 1760, then Levinah Simpson in 1763 in Hagerstown, Maryland.\n\nHugh Evans was born Oct. 7, 1730 near Hagerstown, MD., d. March 27, 1808. With first wife, Sara, had one daughter, Sallie Evans.\n\nSix children with Levinah Simpson.\n\nLevinah Simpson b. Feb. 13, 1732/33 in Washington County, Maryland, d. July 21, 1811 in Hillsboro, Highland County, Ohio.\n\nI did have my tree online at Genconnect at Rootsweb.com but pulled it off. I will probably put it back online when I get it updated which may take a\n\nwhile. It is on Ancestry.com. They took it from Rootsweb.com. I didn't give it to them!\n\nI thought that I had sent you all the information I had.\n\nOh, one piece of information was that Richard and Samuel were brothers but never found any evidence.\n\nI would be bouncing off the walls if I had found what you did. :-) Let me know if you need anything further.\n\nTake care, Judy Minihan"
