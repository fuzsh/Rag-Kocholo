        "text": "Movie 1: Licorice Pizza\n\nThis Drama/Comedy is set in 1970s where Alana and Gary grow up in the San Fernando Valley of California. It was in the era of pinball machines, waterbeds and gas shortages. It has a great sound track and bit parts by folks like Sean Penn, Bradley Cooper, and Alana Haim. If you are in the mood for a flash back, don’t miss this two hour film. Rated R.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 2: Drive My Car\n\nThis film is a 2021 release of a Japanese drama based on a short story by the same name. It’s a unique but simple story about the loss of a wife, followed by a need for a new chauffeur. It’s a fascinating story about love lost and moving on with life. It’s one minute short of three hours. Well worth it! Could very well win the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Japanese with English subtitles.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 3: Death to 2021\n\nWhat a fitting way to end the year!! In the mood for a dark ‘mockumentary’?? Here’s a comedic reflection with talking heads and comedic retrospectives. It’s on Netflix and has an all star cast including Hugh Grant, Lucy Lui and Tracy Ullman! All in one hour!!\n\nRating\n\nMovie 1: The Tender Bar\n\nHere’s an intriguing film based on the Pulitzer Prize book by the same name. It’s set in 1972 when a 9 year old J.R. moves in with his bar tender Uncle Charlie. It’s listed as a Comedy, Drama. It’s rated R for Language and Sexual content. (It’s not suitable for children.) George Clooney does a good job of directing.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 2: A Boy Called Christmas\n\nThe title is a bit misleading. The Boy’s name is Nicolas. He’s an ordinary boy with a pet mouse and a reindeer. It’s a simple story supported by a hefty cast. Maggie Smith, Jim Broadbent, Toby Jones and several others. It’s based on the 2015 book by the same name. This movie can be found on Netflix.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 3: The King’s Man\n\nFirst…it’s an odd plot…tyrants and criminal masterminds from around the world want to kill millions of people around the world (for no seemingly logical reason). It’s listed as an Action /Adventure running just over two hours. This is the prequel to the highly rated Kingsmen movies. Rated R.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 1: The Guilty\n\nThis R rated film is listed as a mystery, thriller, crime, drama. The acting is pretty good. Jake Gyllenhaal, a 911 operator, and Ethan Hawke deliver believable characters. It’s currently available on Netflix.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 2: Red Rocket\n\nThis film is listed as a Comedy/Drama. It’s rated R for graphic nudity, drug use and sexual content. It’s about an aging LA porn star who goes home to Oklahoma to his aging porn star wife! Critics loved this film. We don’t think it’s worth the two hour run time.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 3: The Matrix Resurrections\n\nClearly the best film of the week! Don’t be distracted by the language and violence. It will all make sense in time and place. Lots of surprises from Neo (Keanu Reeves). We do not recommend this film for younger children. It appears to be intended as the ending of the Matrix franchise…we’ll see…!\n\nRating\n\nMovie 1: Nightmare Alley\n\nNote, this 2 hour and 30 minute film is rated R for nudity, language, sexual content and violence. It’s a pretty good dramatic thriller! It’s directed by Guillermo del Toro. There is a “side show” aspect that grows and grows. A great cast with powerful concepts.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 2: Swan Song\n\nHere is another unique concept! The husband and father becomes ill with a terminal illness. It’s a great production with unique twists when he decides to replace himself with a clone. It’s listed as a Sci-Fi Drama. Great acting!\n\nRating\n\nMovie 3: The Lost Daughter\n\nThis psychological drama takes us on a wild ride when a vacation to Greece turns unsettling and downright unnerving! There’s Oscar written all over this production!! Olivia Coleman delivers an amazing performance.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 1: Writing With Fire\n\nThis documentary is the story of India’s only women run newspaper. Led by Chief Reporter Meera, co-reporters collect and write documentaries about day to day life issues and the challenges local women must overcome. It’s an eye opening film. It should be an Oscar contender. Hindi with English subtitles.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 2: Spider-Man: No Way Home\n\nThis is another Marvel Comics Superhero film with more than a hefty amount of violence, action and adventure. It’s listed as an Fantasy. Parents should be aware there are “brief suggestive comments, some violence”. Currently, only in theaters.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 3: Hive\n\nIt’s listed as a Drama/Narrative. Its based on a true story about women in Kosovo (after the break up of the former Yugoslavia). Local women bonded together to launch a business selling a local food product. It’s insightful history. A bit tough to watch. Albanian with English subtitles.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 1: Being the Ricardos\n\nThis film is set in 1952 Hollywood when Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz confront personal and professional challenges that threaten their careers and relationship. It’s rated R for language. Critics didn’t like the actors (even with the A-list!). Pay no attention to the naysayers. It’s beautifully told, acted and directed!\n\nRating\n\nMovie 2: C’mon C’mon\n\nThis is an interesting drama about a child and his uncle. It’s about the bond that ultimately molds their relationship. It is revealing and touching at the same time. It’s rated R for language, but nothing offensive. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an excellent performance.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 3: Kurt Vonnegut: Unstuck in Time\n\nThis is an unconventional documentary film about an unconventional man that spans three decades of time. He’s the author of Slaughterhouse Five and Breakfast of Champions. It’s an interesting story about a lifetime of creative writing. It’s an intriguing look at an authors life, if nothing else.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 1: Hand of God\n\nThis film is rated R. It has some sexual content, some drug use, and a bit of nudity. It takes place in Naples, Italy in the 1980s. Best of all, it’s a peek behind the scenes of Italian life. It feels personal and unsentimental. Emotions range wildly from character to character. There’s a bit of seductive drama and a few surprises. In theatres and available on Netflix. Italian with English subtitles. This film was just nominated for a Golden Globe in Best Picture Non-English Language category.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 2: Red Notice\n\nThe FBI are after the world’s most wanted art thief! Interpol agents are also on the hunt! Equally important, the cast includes Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and at least a dozen more. The chemistry of this cast is core to the viewers entertainment. It’s available on Netflix.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 3: West Side Story\n\nThis is a spectacular film directed by Steven Spielberg. It’s a remake of the 1957 musical by the same name. The remake/reproduction of the original is certain to satisfy new and old audiences. That said, there are numerous differences between the original and the current production. Great acting, great story, great film!\n\nRating\n\nMovie 1: No Time To Die\n\nThis 2021 action/adventure production rambles on for almost three hours!! The good news is the plot is crisp and unfolds in a series of action filled pace. Bond fans have been somewhat disappointed with this rendition.\n\nAll that said, this storyline is jammed with all the action, suspense, innovation and surprise we have come to expect. Critic reviews vary significantly. Just saying…we loved it!\n\nRating\n\nMovie 2: The French Dispatch\n\nOy! This Wes Anderson film is a choc-a-bloc story that asks a lot from its audiences. Parents be warned…be prepared for nudity, sexuality, strong language. We were surprised it is listed as a comedy/drama. Overall, disappointment left us expecting a better experience.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 3: Encounter\n\nThis film was marketed as a Sci-fi Thriller…but it is really a story about mental health. The good news is the cast is talented and the concept is quite unique. It’s clever and thought provoking. It’s just a shame the plot wasn’t as sturdy as the acting.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 1: The Power of the Dog\n\nThis is an intriguing Western Drama written and directed by Jane Campion. It’s based on the 1967 novel by the same name written by Thomas Savage. The film has been recently released in theaters and Netflix. It’s beautifully filmed with an excellent cast. That said, there is a lot of prolonged conflict and angst. This movie is garnering lots of Oscar buzz.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 2: The Starling\n\nHere’s a film that just lets one relax and enjoy the ride. It’s listed as a Comedy/Drama. Critics have been tough on this film but we think there is so much more to absorb from the storyline. Some viewers may balk a bit at the slow pace. On Netflix.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 3 : The Unforgivable\n\nThis film has an impressive cast! Sandra Bullock is the headliner. Next is Viola Davis, Richard Thomas and a dozen more actors. It’s often difficult to watch with strong language and violence.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 1: Julia\n\nHere’s a documentary worth waiting for! This film features the life of Julia Child. She was a world class French trained chef from California who pioneered women chefs, first in France and eventually in the States. It’s insightful, charming, often funny and a nice way to spend 90 minutes!\n\nRating\n\nMovie 2: House of Gucci\n\nWho knew?! It’s based on the book: The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and (of course) Greed. It’s listed as a crime drama. It has a great cast: Lady Gaga, Jared Leto, Adam Driver, Salma Hayek, Al Pacino (and more). Beautiful cinematography, costumes and sets.\n\nRating\n\nMovie 3: Encanto\n\nDisney’s Encanto is a charming music/comedy production that is sure to satisfy audiences of all ages. It’s fantasy, comedy, music and so much more. The run time is just over two hours.\n\nRating"
