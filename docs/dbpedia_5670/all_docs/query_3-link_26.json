        "text": "Mass isolation of islets and its bonus to physiology, the unraveling of the details of stimulus-secretion coupling in β and α cells.\n\nResearch into the isolation of islets began in the 1960s when tens of islets were liberated from rodent pancreas by enzymatic (collagenase) incubations of chopped tissue or free hand microdissection of surface islets (reviewed in reference 2), both usually from obese animals with hypertrophic islets. In a clear technical breakthrough, in 1967 Lacy and Kostianovsky3 demonstrated the ability to harvest several hundred metabolically active and structurally intact islets from the pancreas of a normal rat. Prior to digesting the fat-trimmed pancreas with collagenase, they distended and partially disrupted the enveloping acini through retrograde injection of physiological saline into the cannulated bile/pancreatic duct. The latter maneuver provided easier access of collagen to the interior of the pancreatic tissue. Islets, which are dense ovoid bodies, were separated from acini and ductal fragments by gravity sedimentation in a saline- filled cylinder or by centrifugation in a discontinuous sucrose (or later Ficoll) gradient. Using this approach, up to several hundred islets could be collected from a rodent pancreas, and several thousand islets could be collected from the pancreas of large mammal.\n\nSuccess in harvesting islets and the subsequent ability to disperse these into a preparation of single cells, which could later be separated into their component types, or into preparation of cytosolic components, especially insulin granules,4 could not have come at a more propitious time. Insulin was being routinely and reliably measured by radioimmunoassay. In addition, the rudiments of a general hypothesis for stimulus-secretion coupling in β-cells were being established through several approaches. Ashcroft and Randle in Oxford and Matschinsky and group in St. Louis were providing strong evidence that glucose transport, phosphorylation and oxidation to CO2 + H2O were essential for stimulation of insulin secretion and biosynthesis.5 Grodsky and colleagues,6,7 investigating secretion of insulin by the perfused pancreas into the hepatic vein, had already shown that insulin release in response to a sustained rise in glucose was biphasic and that both phases required aerobic oxidation of glucose and adequate concentrations of extracellular Ca2+. Dean and Matthews8 using microdissected islets, demonstrated that islet cells responded to a rise in ambient glucose by depolarizing and then firing action potentials whose upstrokes appeared to be dependent on the concentration of extracellular Ca2+. As β-cell depolarization required glucose metabolism and was associated with a decrease in membrane permeability to K+, a link between β-cell metabolism and excitability was being established. Hence, an outline of a hypothesis of stimulus-secretion coupling in β-cells was emerging: glucose metabolism, by changing cell energetics was promoting electrical activity, which in turn was promoting Ca2+ entry and Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of insulin granules.\n\nWork using all of these approaches was now made immensely easier and more disseminatable by the technique for mass isolation of islets. Lacy's lab, which had previously published a host of electron microscopic images of maturation and “emiocytosis” (surface rupture and shower-like release of contents of insulin granules in fixed tissue), demonstrated in monolayers of cultured islets that granules, in constant motion, preferentially approached the membrane after glucose stimulation; this was inhibited after application of agents that disassemble cytoskeleton.9,10 On this basis Lacy proposed that biphasic insulin secretion seen with high glucose stimulation (>10 mM) might be explained as follows. First phase insulin secretion, unaffected by cytoskeletal disrupting agents, might result from the discharge of granules already present (in contemporary terminology “docked”) at the membrane. In contrast, second phase insulin secretion, greatly decreased by cytoskeletal disrupting agents, might result from granules moving towards the membrane along cytoskeleton as their contents undergo progressive processing and aggregation. In contemporary terminology this would be while in transit from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, first by kinesin motors along microtubules, then penetrating the cortical actin cage aided by myosin V motors, and lastly attaching to the membrane via the formation of complexes between vesicle (v-, VAMP) and target (t-, SNAP23/25, syntaxin) SNARE proteins. Later experiments demonstrated small oscillatory changes in insulin secretion occurring near resting levels of glucose.10a\n\nWithin less than a decade of routine availability and dispersion of isolated islets, powerful new techniques offered the prospect of revolutionizing the entire field of stimulus-secretion coupling in endocrine cells. These included: patch clamp recording of single channel and whole cell currents underlying both the resting potential at basal levels of glucose and the complex electrical activity initiated by stimulatory glucose concentrations;11,12 optical monitoring of metabolic processes including mitochondrial membrane potential and free cytosolic ion concentration with membrane permeant fluorescent probes;13 and cloning of key transporter proteins including the ATP sensitive K channel.14 Ultimately they also included real time, single cell assays of single cell exocytosis. Most prominent among these were the following: (1) electrical measurements of increases in membrane capacitance (Cm) proportional to plasma membrane surface area in patch clamped cells, indicating increases in plasma membrane surface area due to fusion of organelles the size of insulin granules with the plasma membrane;15,16 (2) electrochemical measurements, by oxidation or reduction of discharged of both native hormone (insulin) and preloaded false transmitter (serotonin) contents17–19 of exocytosing granules, using carbon fiber electrodes whose tips are positioned at the surface of cells, over time courses very similar to the increases in Cm; and (3) optical tracking of granules with fluorescent labeled granule contents or intramembrane proteins as they approach the plasma membrane and fuse with it.\n\nAn overall consensus scheme for stimulus-secretion coupling in β-cells is presented in . A rise in serum glucose from a baseline level of 3 mM to stimulatory levels of 5–6 mM enhances glucose import via a moderate affinity transporter (glut-2) followed by shunting into glycolysis by glucokinase and mitochondrial oxidation (step 1), results in a small rise in cytosolic ATP and a fall in cytosolic ADP (step 2) sufficient to close down ATP-dependent K-selective ion channels (step 3). The latter consist of an inner ring of four inward rectifier K channel subunits (Kir 6.2), encompassing a pore closed by the binding of ATP, and an outer ring of sulfonylurea receptors (SUR 2), interacting with the central core in a fashion that binding of MgADP can open, while binding of sulfonylureas can, close the Kir-defined pore. The closure of K+(ATP) channels, against a background of tonically open non-selective cation channels, constitutes the basis for cell depolarization (step 4) and the activation of voltage dependent Na+, Ca2+ and K+ channels (step 5), which underlie complex electrical activity, including trains of large amplitude action potentials (APs) or long trains aborted APs riding on plateau potentials. The opening of high voltage activated (HVA) Ca2+ channels support rapid entry of Ca2+ (step 6) and Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of the contents of a small pool (at most several hundred) if insulin granules in close proximity to the plasma membrane (the readily releasble pool, RRP) (step7) and likely recruit granules from more interior regions of the cytoplasm into the RRP to refill this pool.20 Individual APsrepolarize as a result of opening of voltage-dependent K+ channels, while plateau depolarizations are likely terminated by the opening of poorly voltage-dependent but Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Incretin messengers, such glucagon-like intestinal peptide (GLP-1) released by enterochromaffin-like (EC) cells of the gut epithelium sensing newly digested nutrients, and acetylcholine released by stimulation of vagus nerve; both enhance closure of K(ATP) channels and help recruit insulin granules into a release ready pool.21,22 Current work is focusing on the contributions of distinct electrical activity patterns, novel Ca2+ currents, glucosederived second messengers other than ATP, and distinct subsets of the RRP pools, including a low Ca2+ sensitivity immediately releasable pool (IRP) likely docked near clusters of Ca2+ channels and a high Ca2+ sensitivity (HCSP) likely farther from the clusters of Ca2+ channels, to the shaping of biphasic insulin secretion.23–26\n\nRecently, Lacy's early experiments on movement of insulin granules have attracted intense interest. These approaches have been improved and made more quantitative using enhanced optical techniques (including evanescent wave or total internal reflectance microscopy, confocal microscopy and two photon excitation microscopy) for tracking the movement of near membrane granules up to the membrane and their subsequent fusion with the plasma membrane and release of their into the extracellular space (ECS). Specific tags for exocytosis include red or green fluorescent protein labeled peptides, including C-peptide of derived from pro-insulin, intrinsic granule membrane proteins (syncollin, or phogrin), granule membrane attached proteins (tissue plasminogen activator), and even insulin bound Zn2+ released into the ECS with decondensation of crystalline insulin granule core and then detected by a bath applied fluorescent indicator.27–31 Endocytosis can be tracked by the filling of granule exocytotic figures with otherwise excluded fluorescent dextran, applied as a fluid phase tracer or with quenching of pH-sensitive fluorescence on granule re-acidification after their recapture. With simultaneous capacitance and amperometry recordings from the same cell it is becoming possible to ask what fraction of attempted exocytoses lead to exit of the crystalline insulin (with its associated Zn2+) into the extracellular space, as opposed to more transient and restricted fusion pore formation with diffusion of more soluble contents, including peptides such as C-peptide or small molecular weight molecules such ATP and GABA.32 The latter two likely play autocrine or paracrine regulatory roles in the islet rather than true endocrine roles systemically. As anticipated by Lacy, some evidence suggests that “newcomer” granules, perhaps refilling the HCSP, are the major contributors to second phase insulin secretion. Careful application of these approaches may yield evidence as to whether granules from distinct granule pools differentially release soluble vs. condensed contents, and how rapidly granule membrane is retrieved and resorted.30,31\n\nIn addition, stimulus-secretion coupling by α-cells has also received intensive study using single cell techniques presented above. Outlines have emerged as to how tonic glucagon secretion results at very low levels of glucose and insulin, how glucagon secretion is curtailed in response to a post-prandial rise in glucose and how glucagon secretion reappears at high levels of glucose or in the presence of high concentrations of adrenalin.32–34 As shown in , α-cells exhibit similar K+(ATP) channels as found in β-cells, though most are closed at low levels of glucose. In addition, they have an abundance of non-selective cation channels, as well as standard voltage dependent Na+ channels and low voltage activated (LVA or T-type) Ca2+ channels. At 2–3 mM glucose α-cells are depolarized and fire spontaneous action potentials that trigger Ca2+ entry through LVA Ca2+ channels; as a result, they exocytose glucagon-containing granules. Raising extracellular glucose towards or above 5 mM closes down more K+(ATP) channels (step 1–3) and further depolarizes the α-cells into a voltage range (near −35 mV) (step 4) where Na+ and T-type Ca2+ channels are inactivated (step 5) and AP amplitude is decreased or its activity even ceases, thereby reducing Ca2+ entry (step 6) and glucagon granule exocytosis. In addition, secretory products of the β-cell, including GABA, Zn2+ as well as insulin, likely suppress glucagon secretion. The best studied of these is GABA: it binds to and opens ionotropic GABA-A receptor channels, which carry Cl- current and clamp the membrane potential of the α-cell near the Cl- equilibrium potential thereby reducing α-cells electrical activity and glucagon release. Lastly, at supraphysiological levels of glucose, where all remaining K+(ATP) channels are closed, or where large concentrations of adrenalin is released by the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, HVA Ca2+ channels are augmented, α-cells may develop plateau depolarizations to −20 mV (step 5a) that are sufficient to tonically activate HVA Ca2+ channels and induce Ca2+ entry (step 6a) as well as recruit more granules into a readily releasable pool, thereby promoting a phase of glucagon release (step 7a), such as that seen during diabetic ketoacidosis or other systemic stresses.\n\nMuch less is known about stimulus-secretion coupling in somatostatin secreting d cells. Early reports (e.g., a recent one using human cells) suggest that the resting membrane potential is dependent on sulfonylurea- but not glucose-dependent K+(ATP) channels, that closure of the latter channels sets off Na+ and Ca2+ dependent action potentials, and that exocytosis is Ca2+ entry-dependent but slow to start and continuing for up to a second after current through HVA Ca2+ channnels has ceased.35\n\nThe extensive effort at understanding the cell biology and biophysics of stimulus-secretion coupling underlying normal insulin secretion has yielded a better understanding of two rare conditions congenital conditions.36–38 Congenital hyperinsulinemia of infancy is now thought most often to be due to the loss of function mutation of K+(ATP) channels (hyposensitivity to MgADP). In contrast, neonatal diabetes, is now thought most often to be due to gain of function K+(ATP) channels (mutations of Kir6.2). However, the rather prevalent state of disordered insulin secretion in man, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2) where β-cells of islets, though reduced in number, remain largely intact, has been much less tractable. Some evidence suggests that in DM 2 β-cells have underlying variations in key coupling factors in cell metabolism (e.g., glucokinase) or key channel subunits e.g., SUR of K+(ATP). Other evidence suggests that increases in free fatty acids (ffas), resulting from developing obesity, may downregulate key regulatory features or even dissociate Ca2+ channels from secretory granules.39 However, to date, there has been no systematic study of glucose-induced depolarization, electrical activity or exocytosis in single cells from DM 2 islets. It is likely that progress will continue to be slow. DM 2 pancreases are not easily procured and often do not readily yield their islets. Also, in a disease that progresses slowly, major heterogeneity in basic defects underlying pathophysiology, may be present and superimposed on ageing-dependent “loss of vigor” of key regulatory features. Lastly, as we have learned from type 1 DM, even the most promising of small animal models may not really replicate the human disease.40 However, investigation may be facilitated by cryopreservation/thaw of islets, which preserves whole islet and single cell function, to promote storage, sharing and comparative testing of available tissue.41\n\nIn addition to enhancing our understanding of individual endocrine cell types in the islet, studies begun by Lacy, and now ongoing world-wide, have demonstrated just how interrelated cells in the islet micro-organ are. Lacy's early ultra-structural work42 vigorously continued by Orci and collaborators, demonstrated complex endocrine-endocrine cell and endocrine cellendothelial cell contacts implying complex “social interactions” of component cells. These include contiguity of β-cells with α- and δ-cells, inter-β cell gap junctions, structural polarization of β-cells between capillaries, and alignment of complex endothelial cell pores with regions of preferred exocytosis in β-cells. Electrophysiological studies have shown that electrical coupling of β-cells contribute to their co-ordinated electrical activity43 while secretion studies on single β-cells vs. those in small clusters have demonstrated the supra-linear augmentation of secretion resulting from cell-cell coupling. Furthermore, studies of the functional islet microvasculature have provided evidence for differential perfusion of islets. In many species the afferent circulation burrows into the core of the islet, where the majority of β- and δ-cells reside, and then branches as to return to the mantle where the majority of α-cells reside. This anatomical organization should permit β-cell secretions to inhibit α-cell secretion of glucagon and δ-cell secretion of somatostatin to inhibit both α- and β-cells.\n\nUsing an idea proposed by Snell in 1957 to explain the delayed growth or destruction of weakly antigenic transplanted tumors, in the early 1980s Lacy championed the concept of long-distance interactions between cells of the islet micro-organ and the immune system.44,45 The major immunological players in this interaction are (1) immune surveillance cells traversing the islet and recognizing unusual or foreign antigens and (2) immune affector cells returning from lymph nodes with instructions to damage or kill cells bearing the unusual or foreign antigens. Simply put, Lacy's idea was that presentation of allo- or auto-antigens by the wandering “passenger leukocytes,” now called dendritic cells/macrophages (or DC/MΦs) was critical for both autoimmunity of type 1 diabetes mellitus and islet transplant rejection, respectively. In the case of autoimmunity of diabetes, the autoantigens bound by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) at the surface of the DC/MΦs were thought to be present at the surface of the β-cell. Contemporary candidates range from insulin, to processed viral antigens that mimic other β-cells proteins e.g., Coxsackie enterovirus antigens mimicking peptides derived from glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD 64), or rotovirus antigens mimicking peptides derived from tyrosine phosphatase Ia (reviewed in ref. 46)In the case of islet transplant rejection, the alloantigens were thought to be present on the surface of capillaries of the allografted islet. Ultimately this leads to local activation of specifically pre-selected cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) in the draining lymph nodes causing them to home in on the islets, destroy target cells and reduce islet function.\n\nPassenger macrophages have come of age.47 Our current understanding is that when new specific antigens appear at the surface of foreign capillaries or β-cells undergoing destruction, they are taken up and processed by DC/MΦs (see ). Antigen processed in the lysosomal pathway is ultimately presented on MHC Class II sites on these cells, while antigen processed in the proteosome pathway is presented on MHC class I. Surface antigen presentation converts immature, tolerogenic DC/MΦs to mature immunogenic DC/MΦs. After migration to local lymph nodes, mature DC/MΦs, via their liganded MHC class II sites and co-stimulatory sites bind to clonally selected sentinel (CD4+) T-helper (TH) cells, which express on their surface T-cell receptors (TCR) for MHC class I-peptide complex and co-stimulating molecules. The binding of surface T-cell receptors (TCRs) converts members of the TH cell population from a largely regulatory to a largely autoreactive phenotype (TH1), which begin to divide and secrete inflammatory cytokines, such as IFNγ. In addition, mature DC/MΦs via their MHC Class I/peptide complex also to CD8+ cells. The latter, plus the cytokines secreted by the activated TH1 cells, promote the maturation of CD8+ cells into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).\n\nDuring their circulation, the CD8+-derived CTLs are attracted into islets by chemokines released by the local inflammatory response to β-cells and as well as by MHC Class I/peptide complexes expressed on the surfaces of β-cells themselves. CTL form “immunological synapses” with the β-cells, thereby promoting β-cell apoptosis, secondary to release of granzymes and channel-forming perforins.\n\nIdentifying a surrogate transplant tissue for an alternative transplantation approach.\n\nIf not human islets for transplantation, what then? As we have emphasized, Lacy subscribed to the following working definition of β-cells: a cell population that (1) senses glucose over a physiological range of 3–7 mM and responds by secreting insulin, (2) interacts appropriately with glucagon-secreting α-cells and somatostatin-secreting δ-cells and (3) regulates its own mass by precisely balancing of mitosis and apoptosis over years while still being capable of undergoing an occasionally growth spurt (such as in pregnancy). Hence β-cells could only be replaced by β-cells. If scarcity of human tissue was the critical issue, this could be circumvented with xenotransplantation using stable islets from pigs, which are long-lived organisms with lower sensitivity to destruction by autoimmunity85,86 and whose insulin, differing from human by only 1 amino acid, had been successfully used to treat diabetics for decades. At this time he preferred xenotransplantation to de novo tissue engineering using transformed clonal cell lines or elaborated stem cells and perhaps even to tissue extracted from life-support brain dead humans. Specifically he thought that pigs could be raised in a sterile environment (now in development in Minnesota and New Zealand), screened and genetically modified to reduce risks of xeno-zoonosis.87 The ability to harvest pancreases from health animals rather than life-supported cadavers would substantially reduce the problems of using ischemic, cytokine-activated tissue likely exposed pre-harvest to a variety of pathogens difficult to test for, wide fluctuations in pre-harvest organ perfusion and the possible effects intravascular coagulation causing micro-angiopathy. The issue of islet xenoimmunology and transplantation might be addressed (1) by genetic engineering to produce organs that minimize host immune or (2) by “immunoisolation” of transplanted tissues. “Knock out the enzymes that trigger reactions or surround the islets with a semi-permeable membrane giving them access to nutrients but not antibodies or immune cells. Then hopefully they will secrete small molecules like insulin and not be a source of retrovirus or oncogenes.” Currently, it is possible knock out of α 1,3 galactosyltransferase,85 an antigen responsible for antibody response and to engineer inhibitors of the complement system cascade. Lacy was enthusiastic about encapsulation of islets in a selectively permeable matrix.88,89 “With introduction into the peritoneal cavity, they could even be retrieved and exchanged for new ones if they simply wore out.” The major question in his mind was whether to use embryonic, foetal, neonatal or young or adult pigs as islet sources. Lacy's new vision of islet transplantation was actually addressing two “brave new world” areas, xenotransplantation and encapsulation, which have gained increasing interest of the past decade.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Lacy and Scharp,90 along with similarly-minded investigators, had begun work on islet encapsulation. Since the mid-1990s, individually encapsulated islets (in microspheres) or small clusters of encapsulated islets (in cylindrical diffusion capsules) had been introduced free into the bloodstream or into the peritoneal cavity. Since then, islets have also been seeded onto hollow fiber semi-permeable membranes to form a bio-hybrid device resembling a modern dialyzer and perfused as an arteriovenous shunt.89 Generally, the encapsulating medium has consisted of a biocompatible alginate whose surface is cross-linked with calcium to form capsules that are then coated with poly-L-lysine (PLL). Key problems using this approach have been loss of islet function and continuing need for immunosuppression, two likely related phenomena. Over time, the beads often collapse, and the PLL permits growth of fibroblasts attracting CD4+ T cells, B cells and macrophages and causing the accumulation of cytokines, chemokines, complement and immunoglobulins, all of which impair function of the encapsulated islets.91 While implantation of these capsules has improved glucose control in animal studies, it often proved dif- ficult to demonstrate significant insulin secretion by retrieved beads. However, there has been recent good news in the form of better understanding of why encapsulated islets are poor secretors as well as the design of better beads.\n\nTransplantation of porcine islets in the absence of encapsulation has also been examined, with resultant reports of prolonged reversal of diabetes reported in non-human primates after intraportal infusion of either adult or neonatal porcine islets.92,93 While heavy immunosuppressive targeting of T cells was used to delay eventual T-cell mediated rejection, genetic engineering to eliminate hyper-acute rejection of solid organs, was not attempted. The ability to make pig transgenics, however, suggests that IBMIR might be “engineered away”. The issue of the relative advantage of neonatal vs. adult islets remains: while neonatal islets do not function immediately, they are less immunogenic and have potential for growth. Encouragingly, thus far no transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses has been reported.\n\nFinally I took the risk and asked about his views of the then developing research with cell based therapies for β-cell replacement: engineered clonal β-cells or harvesting/differentiating stem cells to be β-cell-like. His responses were bits of wry skepticism delivered in a mildly irritated tone. First, he asked how trustable one might expect a tumor cell to be regarding slow reproduction and stably secretion vs. reversion to uncontrolled proliferation and unpredictable or episodic secretion. Second, he asked how one would actually identify the stem cell for an adult β-cell and if one started far back in development would one simply be growing foregut teratomas for “a heck of a long time before figuring anything out.”\n\nHowever, over the past ten years substantial progress has been made on harvesting/differentiating/engineering β-cell-like entities. While I'd anticipate Lacy would still have a healthy skepticism regarding these endeavors, he'd probably maintain a real interest in them. Certainly, he'd be very pleased to learn of new evidence supporting his contention that the best way to replace a β-cell is with another real β-cell. Based on genetic linkage tracing analysis, the major source for steady state β-cell replacement as well as proliferation after partial pancreatectomy, or targeted ablation is from extant ones by simple cell division. Furthermore, it is now proposed that cell division is the source of islet mass expansion in pregnancy, after gastric bypass surgery, and perhaps in partial reversal/recovery from autoimmune diabetes.94,95 Unfortunately, it has also become clearer that currently used immunosuppressive drugs inhibit regenerative restoration of reduced β-cell mass by cell division. However, being an astute biologist, he'd likely anticipate that there is still some room for a facultative endocrine progenitor cell in the adult pancreas. With partial pancreatic duct ligation causing acinar degeneration and duct proliferation, cells expressing the transcription factor neurogenin-3 (NGn3) can be harvested and then injected into explanted embryonic pancreas to differentiate into mature islet endocrine cells, recapitulating their role in the embryonic mode of endocrine pancreatic development.96–98 This would tend to downplay potential roles of bone marrow, spleen and liver as primary sources of stem cell for adult islet regeneration but suggest that going several steps back to attempting might not be entirely farfetched.99\n\nAssuredly, he'd likely be interested in some tantalizing developments suggesting the possibilities of (1) differentiating an embryonic stem (i.e., pluripotential cells derived from the inner mass of the blastocyst) through a pancreatic endodermal stage, which then could be matured into pro-endocrine cells, and (2) reprogramming of adult pancreatic exocrine cells into β-cells by inducing the re-expression of several transcription factors.100 In the first case, one such recent attempt has made use of an initial induction factor, activin A and culminated in the maturation of foregut-like tissue after several month of implantation/maturation in mice made diabetic with streptozotocin. Improved glycemic control was achieved, though C-peptide secretion from these cells are not well regulated. In the second case, the transcription factors are NGn3, Pdx1 and Mafa.\n\nLastly, he'd likely give a critical eye to a recently reported conditionally transformed (reversibly immortalized) nontumorigenic human β-cell clone (NAKT-15). These reverted cells display a large complement of insulin granules, hormone processing enzymes and β-cell transcription factors (e.g., Pdx-1) as well as impressive increases in insulin and C-peptide secretion in response to 25 mM glucose, and control blood glucose for up to 30 weeks in combined immunodeficient mice made diabetic with streptozotocin.101 One might almost here Lacy say that we're not there yet, but a little closer.102"
