In 1695 he returned to Trento, where he was ordained a priest and served as a cleric at the Cathedral. He published 3 sets of 10 trio sonatas each (Venice, 1696, 1698, and 1703); 10 sonatas for Violin and Bass (Venice, 1707); 10 \"concerti a 4\" and 5 \"concertini\" for Violin and Bass; 6 motets for Soprano, Violin, and Bass. He also wrote 2 sets of minuets (50 in each set), which are lost. Four of his \"invenzioni\" were mistaken for Bach's works and were included in the Bachgesellschaft ed. (XLV, part 1, p. 172). Henry Eccles published the fourth of these pieces as his own, incorporating it in his Violin Sonata No. 11. - Died at Padua, Dec. 19,1748.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1697 - Francesco A Vallotti, Italian organist/composer/theorist is born.\n\nin 1704 - Jose Antonio Carlos de Seixas, composer is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1724 - Giovanni Battista Cirri, Italian cellist and composer, is born at Forli, Oct. 1, 1724; d. there, June 11, 1808. He studied with his brother, Ignazio Cirri (1711-87), organist at Forli Cathedral from 1759, and with Giovanni Balzani, organist at the church of the Madonna del Fuoco. After taking holy orders in 1739, he was a cellist and composer at the Basilica of S. Petronio in Bologna. In 1759 he was elected a member of the Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna. In 1764 he went to London as a chamber musician to the Duke of York and as director of music to the Duke of Gloucester, brother of King George III. He also was active as a concert artist. Returning to Forli in 1780, he assisted his brother at the Cathedral. In 1782 he was made principal cellist at the Teatro dei Fiorentini in Naples. In 1787 he was named his brother's successor as maestro di cappella at Forli Cathedral. He wrote much chamber music, demonstrating a special flare for the cello, and also composed sacred works.

Growing up in a musical environment, he studied piano as a child with August Tombo, harpist in the Court Orchestra; then took violin lessons from Benno Walter, its concertmaster, and later received instruction from the court conductor, Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer. According to his own account, he began to improvise songs and piano pieces at a very early age; among such incunabula was the song Weihnachtslied, followed by a piano dance, Schneiderpolka. On March 30, 1881, his first orchestra work, the Symphony in D minor, was premiered in Munich under Hermann Levi. This was followed by the Symphony in F minor, premiered on Dec. 13, 1884, by the N.Y. Philharmonic under Theodore Thomas. Strauss also made progress as a performing musician; when he was 20 years old, Hans von Bullow engaged him as asst. conductor of his Meiningen Orchestra About that time, Strauss became associated with the poet and musician Alexander Ritter, who introduced him to the \"music of the future/' as it was commonly called, represented by orchestra works of Liszt and operas by Wagner. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1886 Strauss received an appointment as the third conductor of the Court Opera in Munich. On March 2, 1887, he conducted in Munich the first performance of his symphonic fantasy, Aus Italien. This was followed by the composition of his first true masterpiece, the symphonic poem Don Juan, in which he applied the thematic ideas of Liszt; he conducted its premiere in Weimar on Nov. 11, 1889; it became the first of a series of his tone poems, all of them based on literary subjects. His next tone poem of great significance in music history was Tod und Verklarung-, Strauss conducted it for the first time in Eisenach on June 21, 1890, on the same program with the premiere of his brilliant Burleske for Piano and Orchestra, featuring Eugen d'Albert as soloist. There followed the first performance of the symphonic poem Macbeth, which Strauss conducted in Weimar on Oct. 13,1890. In these works, Strauss established himself as a master of program music and the most important representative of the nascent era of musical modernism; as such, he was praised extravagantly by earnest believers in musical progress and damned savagely by entrenched traditionalists in the press. He effectively adapted Wagner's system of leading motifs (leitmotifs) to the domain of symphonic music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] His tone poems were interwoven with motifs, each representing a relevant programmatic element. Explanatory brochures listing these leading motifs were published like musical Baedekers to guide the listeners. Bullow, ever a phrasemaker, dubbed Strauss \"Richard the third\" Richard the first being Wagner but no one worthy of direct lineage as Richard the second in deference to the genius of the master of Bayreuth. Turning to stage music, Strauss wrote his first opera, Guntram, for which he also composed the text; he conducted its premiere in Weimar on May 10,1894, with the leading soprano role performed by Pauline de Ahna; she was married to Strauss on Sept. 10, 1894, and remained with him all his life; she died on May 13,1950, a few months after Strauss himself. While engaged in active work as a composer, Strauss did not neglect his conducting career. In 1894 he succeeded Bulow as conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, leading it for a season. Also in 1894 he became asst. conductor of the Munich Court Opera; he became chief conductor in 1896. In 1896-97 he filled engagements as a guest conductor in European music centers. His works of the period included the sparkling Till Eugenspiegels lustige Streiche (Cologne, Nov. 5,1895), Also sprach Zamthustra, a philosophical tone poem after Nietzsche (Frankfurt am Main, Nov. 27, 1896, Strauss conducting), and Don Quixote, variations with a cello solo, after Cervantes (Cologne, March 8, 1898). In 1898 Strauss became a conductor at the Berlin Royal Opera; in 1908 he was made its Generalmusikdirektor, a position he held until 1918. He conducted the first performance of his extraordinary autobiographical tone poem Ein Heldenleben in Frankfurt am Main on March 3,1899; the hero of the title was Strauss himself, while his critics were represented in the score by a cacophonous charivari; for this exhibition of musical self-aggrandizement, he was severely chastised in the press. There followed his first successful opera, Feuersnot (Dresden, Nov. 21, 1901). [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In June 1903 Strauss was the guest of honor of the Strauss Festival in London. It was also in 1903 that the University of Heidelberg made him Dr.Philosophy, honoris causa. For his first visit to the U.S., he presented to the public the premiere performance of his Symphonia domestica at Carnegie Hall in N.Y. on March 21, 1904. The score represented a day in the Strauss household, containing an interlude describing, quite literally, the feeding of the newly born baby. The reviews in the press reflected aversion to such a musical self-exposure. There followed his opera Salome, to the German translation of Oscar Wilde's play. Schuch led its premiere in Dresden on Dec. 9,1905. Salome had its American premiere at the Metropolitan Opera in N.Y. on Jan. 22, 1907; the ghastly subject, involving intended incest, 7-fold nudity, and decapitation followed by a labial necrophilia, administered such a shock to the public and the press that the Metropolitan Opera took it off the repertoire after only 2 performances. Scarcely less forceful was Strauss's next opera, Elektra, to a libretto by the Austrian poet and dramatist Hugo von Hofmannsthal, in which the horrors of matricide were depicted with extraordinary force in unabashedly dissonant harmonies. Schuch conducted its premiere in Dresden on Jan. 25, 1909. Strauss then decided to prove to his admirers that he was quite able to write melodious operas to charm the musical ear; this he accomplished in his next production, also to a text of Hofmannsthal, Der Rosenkavalier, a delightful opera-bouffe in an endearing popular manner; Schuch conducted its premiere in Dresden on Jan. 26, 1911. Turning once more to Greek mythology, Strauss wrote, with Hofmannsthal again as librettist, a short opera, Ariadne auf Naxos, which he conducted for the first time in Stuttgart on Oct. 25, 1912. In June 1914 Strauss was awarded an honorary D.Mus. degree from the University of Oxford. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His next work was the formidable, and quite realistic, score Eine Alpensinfonie, depicting an ascent of the Alps, and employing a wind machine and a thunder machine in the orchestra to illustrate an Alpine storm. Strauss conducted its first performance with the Dresden Court Orchestra in Berlin on Oct. 28, 1915. Then, again with Hofmannsthal as librettist, he wrote the opera Die Frau ohne Schatten (Vienna, Oct. 10, 1919), using a complex plot, heavily endowed with symbolism. In 1917 Strauss helped to organize the Salzburg Festival and appeared there in subsequent years as conductor. In 1919 he assumed the post of co-director with Franz Schalk of the Vienna State Opera, a position he held until 1924. In 1920 he took the Vienna Philharmonic, on a tour of South America; in 1921 he appeared as a guest conductor in the U.S. For his next opera, Intermezzo (Dresden, Nov. 4, 1924), Strauss wrote his own libretto; then, with Hofmannsthal once more, he wrote Die agi/ptische Helena (Dresden, June 6, 1928). Their last collaboration was Arabella (Dresden, July 1, 1933). When Hitler came to power in 1933, the Nazis were eager to persuade Strauss to embrace the official policies of the Third Reich. Hitler even sent him a signed picture of himself with a flattering inscription, \"To the great composer Richard Strauss, with sincere admiration\" Strauss kept clear of formal association with the Fuhrer and his cohorts, however. He agreed to serve as president of the newly organized Reichsmusikkammer on Nov. 15, 1933, but resigned from it on July 13, 1935, ostensibly for reasons of poor health. He entered into open conflict with the Nazis by asking Stefan Zweig, an Austrian Jew, to provide the libretto for his opera Die schiveigsame Frau; it was duly premiered in Dresden on June 24, 1935, but then taken off the boards after a few performances. His political difficulties grew even more disturbing when the Nazis found out that his daughter in- law was Jewish. Zweig himself managed to escape Nazi horrors, and emigrated to Brazil, but was so afflicted by the inhumanity of the world that he and his wife together committed suicide. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Strauss valiantly went through his tasks; he agreed to write the Olympische Hymne for the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936. On Nov. 5, 1936, he was honored with the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society in London; the next day he conducted the visiting Dresden State Opera in a performance of his Ariadne auf Naxos at Covent Garden. For his next opera, he chose Joseph Gregor as his librettist; with him Strauss wrote Daphne (Dresden, Oct. 15,1938), which was once more a revival of his debt to Greek mythology. For their last collaboration, Strauss and Gregor wrote the opera Die Liebe der Danae, also on a Greek theme. Its public dress rehearsal was given in Salzburg on Aug. 16, 1944, but by that time World War II was rapidly encroaching on devastated Germany, so that the opera did not receive its official premiere until after Strauss's death. The last opera by Strauss performed during his lifetime was Capriccio. Its libretto was prepared by the conductor Clemens Krauss, who conducted its premiere in Munich on Oct. 28,1942. Another interesting work of this period was Strauss's Horn Concerto No. 2, first performed in Salzburg on Aug. 11, 1943. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]During the last weeks of the war, Strauss devoted himself to the composition of Metamorphosen, a symphonic work mourning the disintegration of Germany; it contained a symbolic quotation from the funeral march from Beethoven's Eroica Symphony. He then completed another fine score, the Oboe Concerto. In Oct. 1945 he went to Switzerland. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In Oct. 1947 Strauss visited London for the Strauss Festival and also appeared as a conductor of his own works. Although official suspicion continued to linger regarding his relationship with the Nazi regime, he was officially exonerated of all taint on June 8, 1948. A last flame of creative inspiration brought forth the deeply moving Vier letzte Lieder (1948), for Soprano and Orchestra, inspired by poems of Herman Hesse and Eichendorff. With this farewell, Strauss left Switzerland in 1949 and returned to his home in Germany, where he died at the age of 85. Undeniably one of the finest master composers of his era, Strauss never espoused extreme chromatic techniques, remaining a Romanticist at heart. His genius is unquestioned as regards his tone poems from Don Juan to Ein Heldenleben and his operas from Salome to Das Rosenkavalier, all of which have attained a permanent place in the repertoire, while his Vier letzte Lieder stand as a noble achievement of his Romantic inspiration. In 1976 the Richard-Strauss-Gesellschaft was organized in Munich. - Died at Garmisch- Partenkirchen, Sept. 8, 1949.

She studied at the Royal Academy of Music in Stockholm (1897-1902); then in Berlin with Friedrich (1903-05). She made her operatic debut as Leonora in La Favorite at the Stockholm Opera (Jan. 19, 1903); was engaged there from 1903 until 1932; made her debut at Covent Garden in London in 1914; was a member of the Chicago Opera Co. (1912-14; 1915-17). She made her first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in N.Y. as Dalila on Nov. 23,1917, and remained on its roster until 1929; in 1934 she returned to Stockholm as a teacher at the Conservatory. - Died at Stockholm, May 1, 1941.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1896 - Friedrich Gottlieb Schwencke, composer, dies at 72\n\nin 1899 - George Frederick McKay, composer is born.\n\nin 1900 - Charles Swinnerton Heap, composer, dies at 53.\n\nin 1902 - Vissarion Yakovlevich Shebalin, composer is born.\n\nin 1904 - Clarence \"Pinetop\" Smith, jazz pianist/singer (Boogie Woogie Piano) is born.\n\nClarence Smith, better known as Pinetop Smith was an American boogie-woogie style blues pianist. His hit tune, \"Pine Top's Boogie Woogie,\" featured rhythmic \"breaks\" that were an essential ingredient of ragtime music.\n\nHe was a posthumous 1991 inductee of the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame.\n\nSmith was born in Troy, Alabama and raised in Birmingham, Alabama. He received his nickname as a child from his liking for climbing trees. In 1920 he moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he worked as an entertainer before touring on the T. O. B. A. vaudeville circuit, performing as a singer and comedian as well as a pianist. For a time he worked as accompanist for blues singer Ma Rainey and Butterbeans and Susie.\n\nIn the mid 1920s he was recommended by Cow Cow Davenport to J. Mayo Williams at Vocalion Records, and in 1928 he moved, with his wife and young son, to Chicago, Illinois to record. For a time he, Albert Ammons, and Meade Lux Lewis lived in the same rooming house.\n\nOn 29 December 1928 he recorded his influential \"Pine Top's Boogie Woogie,\" one of the first \"boogie woogie\" style recordings to make a hit, and which cemented the name for the style. Pine Top talks over the recording, telling how to dance to the number. He said he originated the number at a house-rent party in St. Louis, Missouri. Smith was the first ever to direct \"the .... with the red dress on\" to \"not move a peg\" until told to \"shake that thing\" and \"mess around\".\n\nSmith was scheduled to make another recording session for Vocalion in 1929, but died from a gunshot wound in a dance-hall fight in Chicago the day before the session. Sources differ as to whether he was the intended recipient of the bullet. \"I saw Pinetop spit blood\" was the famous headline in Down Beat magazine.\n\nNo photographs of Smith are known to exist.\n\nSmith was acknowledged by other boogie woogie pianists such as Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson as a key influence, and he gained posthumous fame when \"Boogie Woogie\" was arranged for big band and recorded by Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra in 1938. Although not immediately successful, \"Boogie Woogie\" was so popular during and after World War II that it became Dorsey's best selling record, with over five million copies sold. Bing Crosby also recorded his version of the song.\n\nFrom the 1950s, Joe Willie Perkins became universally known as \"Pinetop Perkins\" for his recording of \"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\". Perkins later became Muddy Waters' pianist and later, when in his nineties, recorded a song on his 2004 ......' Man album, which played on the by-then-common misconception that Perkins had himself written \"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\".\n\nRay Charles adapted \"Pine Top's Boogie Woogie\" for his song \"Mess Around\", for which the authorship was credited to \"A. Nugetre\", Ahmet Ertegun.\n\nIn 1975 the Bob Thiele Orchestra recorded a modern jazz album called I Saw Pinetop Spit Blood that included a treatment of \"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\" as well as the title song.\n\nGene Taylor recorded a version of \"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\" on his eponymous 2003 album.\n\nClaes Oldenburg, the pop artist, proposed a Pinetop Smith Monument in his book, Proposals for Monuments and Buildings 1965-69. Oldenburg described the monument as \"a wire extending the length of North Avenue, west from Clark Street, along which at intervals runs an electric impulse colored blue so that there's one blue line as far as the eye can see. Pinetop Smith invented boogie woogie blues at the corner of North and Larrabee, where he finally was murdered: the electric wire is \"blue\"and dangerous.\" [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64ZfE60SrNA&feature=related\"][FONT=&quot]YouTube - ‪PINE TOP SMITH - Pinetop's Boogie Woogie‬‏[/FONT][/ame][/FONT]​\n\n[FONT=&quot][ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ7IA8WeMAg\"][FONT=&quot]Clarence \" Pinetop\" Smith - Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out - YouTube[/FONT][/ame][/FONT]​\n\n​\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1904 - Emil Frantisek Burian, Czech composer and stage director is born at Pilsen. His father was a baritone and his mother a singing teacher. He received his training at the Prague Conservatory where he attended Foerster's masterclass in composition (graduated, 1927). Even before graduating, he was active in avant-garde quarters in Prague as a stage director, dramatist, actor, and musician. With his mother, he presented concerts of new music from 1920. In 1924 he organized Pritomnost, a society for contemporary music. In 1927 he organized the Voice Band, which sang according to prescribed rhythm but without definite pitch. It attracted considerable attention at the Sienna ISCM Festival on Sept. 12, 1928. Between 1929 506 and 1932 he was active in Brno and Oloumoc. In 1933 he founded his own theater in Prague. During the Nazi occupation, Burian's theater was shut down and he was placed in a concentration camp. After his liberation, he was a director in Brno (1945-46). In 1946 he returned to Prague and served that year as director of the Karlin musical theater. His long-standing commitment to the political Left led to his being made a deputy in the post-World War II National Assembly. As a composer, he followed an eclectic path, finding inspiration in Czech folk art, jazz, the music of Les Six, and Dada. Between the 2 World Wars, he was one of the leading figures in the Czech avant-garde. After World War II and the installation of the Communist regime, he embraced the tenets of socialist realism. His writings, all published in Prague, include a moderni ruske hudbe (1926); Polydynamika (1926); Jazz (1928); Pamtitnik bratfi Burianu (Almanac of the Burian Brothers; 1929); Prazskd dramaturgie (1938); Emil Burian (1947); Knrel Burian (1948); Divadlo za nasich dnu (The Theater of Our Days; 1962). – Died at Prague, Aug. 9, 1959.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1907 - Jose Bernabe Marino Barreto y Casanova, pianist vocalist bandleader is born\n\nin 1910 - Carmine Coppola, composer/conductor (Godfather II, Apocalypse Now) is born\n\nin 1912 - Mukhtar Ashrafi, composer is born\n\nin 1913 - Revaz Kondrat'yevich Gabichvadze, composer is born.\n\nin 1913 - Rise Stevens, NYC, mezzo-soprano (Met Opera)/actor (Going My Way) is born at N.Y. The original family surname was Steenberg. She studied voice with Orry Prado; after graduating from high school, she sang minor roles with the N.Y. Opera-Comique Co. The enterprise soon went bankrupt, and for a while she had to earn her living by dress modeling, before she was offered free singing lessons by Anna Schoen-Rene at the Juilliard School of Music. She was subsequently sent to Salzburg to study with Marie Gutheil-Schoder at the Mozarteum, and later entered classes in stage direction with Herbert Graf. In 1936 she was engaged by Szell for the Prague Opera as a contralto; she prepared several roles from standard operas, coaching with George Schick. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]She went on a tour to Cairo, Egypt, with a Vienna opera group, and then sang at the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires. She made her American debut as Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier with the Metropolitan Opera in Philadelphia on Nov. 22, 1938.

He was also a true original, whose signature techniques – fluid melody-statements played entirely in chords, special tunings, a pianist's sense of harmony – influenced guitarists from Barney Kessel to Bill Frisell.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Smith was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and after several family moves in search of work, grew up in Portland, Maine – the Depression having closed the Alabama foundry where his father had worked. As a boy, he listened to his father playing the banjo with friends, taught himself to play the viola and violin and practised on guitars in the local pawnshops in exchange for keeping the hocked instruments in tune. By 13, he was teaching adults the guitar, playing for money in a hillbilly band called Uncle Lem and the Mountain Boys, and learning jazz techniques by listening to the 1930s guitar stars Django Reinhardt and Charlie Christian on the radio.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot] Smith played the cornet in an Air Corps band during the second world war (he was fascinated by aircraft, and later became a licensed pilot), and later led an airforce jazz group for a tour of the south. Air Corps Major Glenn Miller heard the band and would have hired Smith for his own world-famous orchestra had the authorities not overruled him.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]After the war, Smith worked as a staff musician in Portland's NBC studios, as a vaudeville theatre pit-band musician, and as a jazz player in local clubs. He took up a player/arranger's role at NBC's New York headquarters in 1946. Alongside playing on Ed Sullivan's and Benny Goodman's shows and many others, the workaholic Smith also played for the New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Symphony and NBC Symphony Orchestras, the latter under Toscanini.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]In 1949, he even took on a part that had defeated the classical guitarist hired for the task, at the premiere of Arnold Schoenberg's Serenade for seven musicians at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Hung-over for the conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos's 7am rehearsal, the Smith nonetheless perfectly nailed this complex work.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Smith recorded with Benny Goodman in 1951 and then formed his own jazz group – playing regularly at the famous Birdland club, where Charlie Parker became a keen admirer. In 1952, Smith and the saxophonist Stan Getz recorded a version of Moonlight in Vermont for Roost Records that became one of the biggest-selling of all jazz singles - and three years later, the guitarist composed a countermelody to the love-song Softly, As in a Morning Sunrise that he called Walk, Don't Run. The tune was successfully covered by the country-guitar virtuoso Chet Atkins, and then turned into a major chart hit by the instrumental rock band the Ventures, whose bass player Bob Bogle happened to own Atkins's album Hi-Fi in Focus.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Meanwhile, Smith had cut back on his studio work to tour with the big bands of Stan Kenton and Count Basie. It was an exhausting but musically fascinating workload that Smith quit virtually overnight in February 1958, after his second wife, Ann, died, and he became solely responsible for their four-year-old daughter, Kim. Smith promptly drove Kim and all their belongings to Colorado Springs, where his two brothers and his mother lived. He observed that the receding Manhattan skyline in his rear-view mirror when he left was \"the greatest view I ever had of New York City\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Although he occasionally returned to New York to play jazz, he settled contentedly in Colorado (marrying his third wife, Sandy Robbins, in 1960), playing jazz locally, opening a guitar shop in 1961, and making his last recordings, for solo guitar, in 1976. In his later years, Smith the perfectionist stopped playing, even at home, if he could no longer play at his best.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]In 1980, he published a guitar tutor, The Complete Johnny Smith Approach to Guitar, and in 1986 the University of Colorado awarded him an honorary doctorate. The Smithsonian Institution presented him with the James Smithson bicentennial medal, \"for his contributions to American music\", in 1998 – and in 2002 Mosaic Records reissued many of his classic recordings of the 1950s and 60s.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Sandy died in 2006. Smith is survived by Kim; two sons, John and David, from his first marriage, to Gertrude, which ended in divorce; a brother; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 201[/FONT][FONT=&quot]3[/FONT][FONT=&quot] – Haobam Ongbi Ngangbi Devi, Indian classical dancer and musician, known for her expertise in the Manipuri Dance forms of Lai Haraoba and Raas, dies at 89 at her residence Uripok Tourangbam Leikai, Imphal.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot] She was honored by the Government of India, in 2010, with the fourth highest Indian civilian award of Padma Shri.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Haobam Ongbi Ngangbi Devi was born on 1 August 1924 at Uripok Bachaspati Leikai, Imphal in the Indian state of Manipur to Kijam Bokul Singh who was a locally known Sankirtan Pala performer. She started learning Manipuri dance and music from the age of five from Manipuri Sangeertan Sangh and debuted as an artiste at Jaipaiguri Festival, in Kolkata in 1930. She, later, studied Lai Haraoba, Raas and the ethnic dance forms of the hills under the tutelage of renowned teachers such as Guru Atomba Singh, Yumnam Ojah Natum Singh, Guru M. Amubi Singh, and Ngangom Ojah Jugindro Singh during the period from 1932 till 1940. She also learnt classical music from Ustad Meisnam Bidhu Singh and Chingakham Radhacharan Singh.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ngangbi Devi, known as the first classical singer from Manipur, started recording for the All India Radio and also sang playback for Mainu Pemcha, the first feature film attempted by Manipuri, in 1948. When Jawaharlal Nehru Manipur Dance Academy was established, Ngangbi Devi was appointed as a faculty member in the departments of dance and music. The Academy, an institution of moderate proportions in the beginning, grew over the years during Devi's tenure as a teacher of Lai Haraoba there. She is reported to have researched on Lai Haraoba and is credited with preparing a syllabus for the institution. She also updated herself by continuing her studies at Lalit Kala Bhavan and worked as an actress for the Manipur Dramatic Union, Rupmahal Theatre and Aryan Theatre during the period from 1936 to 1945.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Devi continued her work at the JNM Dance Academy where she rose in ranks to become the Head of the Department of Folk and Community Dance in 1966 and held the post of the vice principal of the Academy at the time of her retirement in 1985. Devi, during her active years, has participated in various national and international occasions and festivals such as the Republic Day Folk Dance Festival, National Dance Festival and Inter State Cultural Exchange Programs.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ngambi Devi married Haobam Amuba Singh in 1941 and the couple had a son. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ngangbi Devi, a recipient of Birangana title from the Government of Assam and a Gold Medal from the Government of Manipur, was awarded the Manipur State Kala Akademi Award in 1980. Two years later, in 1985, Manipuri Sahitya Parishad honored her with the Nirtya Bhushan Award. In 1993, she received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award. The Government of India included her, in 2010, in the Republic Day honours list for the civilian award of Padma Shri.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 201[/FONT][FONT=&quot]3[/FONT][FONT=&quot] – Michael Brown, a composer, lyricist, writer, director, producer, and performer, dies at 93. He was born in Mexia, Texas. His musical career began in New York cabaret, performing first at Le Ruban Bleu. In the 1960s, he was a producer of industrial musicals for major American corporations such as J.C. Penney and DuPont. For the DuPont pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair, Brown wrote and produced a musical revue \"The Wonderful World of Chemistry,\" staged 48 times a day by two simultaneous casts in adjacent theaters. For years, he maintained a reunion directory of the cast and crew, which included Robert Downey, Sr. as a stage manager. 2005 mailing: \"After all, it was a remarkable time in all of our lives. We can be fairly certain nothing like it will be seen again. Love all round, Mike.\" Several of his songs have entered the American repertoire, including \"Lizzie Borden\" and \"The John Birch Society,\" which were popularized by the Chad Mitchell Trio. Children know him best as the author of three Christmas books about Santa's helper, Santa Mouse.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His off-Broadway and cabaret contributions of music and lyrics were myriad. In 1948, performing his own music and lyrics, he auditioned for Julius Monk. His engagement at Le Ruban Bleu lasted a record 54 weeks. Returning to cabaret every ten years or so, he performed at The Blue Angel, the Ballroom, Plaza 9, Upstairs at the Downstairs, and The Savoy in London. He wrote the words and music for songs that were featured in all of Julius Monk's cabaret revues, including Four Below, 1956; Take Five, 1957; Four Below Strikes Back, 1959; Dressed to the Nines, 1960; Seven Come Eleven, 1961; Dime a Dozen, 1962; Baker's Dozen, 1964; and Bits and Pieces XIV, 1964. His songs for these revues included \"Lola Montez,\" \"Won't You Come Home, Judge Crater,\" \"Love Letters Written to My Mother,\" \"Don't Let Them Take the Paramount,\" and \"The Third Avenue El.\" Dan Dietz wrote about \"The Third Avenue El\": \"This sweetly nostalgic song about the passing of a New York City landmark resonates more than ever today, and is particularly touching in its wish that vanished New York sites might always be with us, if not in concrete and steel, then at least in memory.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His musical, Is There Intelligent Life on Earth? was produced in Bristol, UK, in 1964. Songs in that production included \"Blue-Green Planet,\" \"Communicate with Me,\" \"Serene Morning in Jersey,\" and \"Goodbye, Old World.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Broadway[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His first work on Broadway was the song \"Lizzie Borden\" in Leonard Sillman's New Faces of 1952 filmed as New Faces. It was later recorded by the Chad Mitchell Trio, who also recorded his \"John Birch Society.\" In 2004, he wrote to Julie Harris: \"There was never any objection—at least none that I heard—that the number was about a brutal double murder. Time seemed to tidy up all the blood. Even so, Leonard Sillman asked me to replace the original final chorus.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]New Faces of 1952 was revived in 1982.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He wrote the lyrics to Harold Arlen's music for Pearl Bailey's show-stopping number \"Indoor ....\" in House of Flowers. In 1956 he contributed the song \"The Washingtons are Doing OK\" for Leonard Sillman's New Faces of 1956. He also wrote a production number for the Carol Channing company of Sugar Babies.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Michael Brown wrote the book, lyrics, and music for the nineteen-day run of Different Times, and directed the production. The story followed multiple generations of one family, and was presented at the ANTA Theater, opening on 1 May 1972. The cast album was recorded in 1987.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the 1970s, he wrote and extensively toured Out of Step: The Great American Nut Show in which he presented the results of his lifelong fascination with such people as John Dillinger, Starr Faithfull, Judge Crater, Aimee Semple McPherson, and the original Siamese twins, Chang and Eng. He shared his years of researching letters, rare photographs, newsreel footage, and examples of signs-of-the-times, through the use of slides, film, and song and dance. His songs to accompany the tale of each of his special people ranged from satirical comment, such as an unemotional campaign song for Calvin \"Silent Cal\" Coolidge, to sensitive ballads revealing a particular tragedy or grief in a person's life, such as Baby Doe Tabor. One of the most touching songs was his musical setting of \"Starr Faithfull's Last Letter.\" She was a beautiful, young playgirl in the 1930s whose death remains a mystery to this day.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brown started reading at age 4 and playing piano at age 6. In 1940, at the age of 19, he was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the Plan II program at the University of Texas, Austin. After attending Harvard University and the University of Iowa, he defended his master's thesis in English Literature, on the writer Wilkie Collins, at the University of Virginia. During World War II he enlisted in the Army Air Forces on 6 April 1944. He attended Officers' Candidate School at Yale, where Glenn Miller played in the mess hall. He served with the 723rd Army Air Forces Base Unit as a Cryptographic Officer (0224). The bulk of his time was spent in the Caribbean where he wrote and performed songs when not deciphering phantom enemy submarine signals. Up to the time of his discharge on 4 June 1946, he used his name given at birth, Marion Martin Brown, II. He moved to New York City in 1947. Thereafter, he used the name Michael. In 1950 he married Joy Williams Brown, a former ballerina who trained at the School of American Ballet and joined Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in New York at the invitation of George Balanchine. She also danced in Europe as a principal with Roland Petit's Les Ballets de Paris.Michael Brown became friends with Margo Fonteyn through his wife, Joy, and was thus introduced to the ballet world.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]With his wife Joy, he had three children, Michael Martin Brown, Jr. of Hoboken, New Jersey, born in 1951; Kelly Kennedy Brown of Portland, Oregon, born in 1954; and Adam Anderson Brown born in 1964. Adam died in 1994.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The couple was instrumental in the career of Harper Lee, whom Michael met through his friend Truman Capote. The Browns made it possible for Lee to work on To Kill a Mockingbird by giving her the gift of a year's financial support in 1956 with the note: \"You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas.\" Harper Lee wrote about this Christmas gift in McCalls magazine in December 1961. However, neither she nor the Browns ever disclosed their names, which led to years of speculation in literary circles until the publication of Charles J. Shields' unauthorized biography Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee. Confirmation of the story occurred when the Browns broke their silence in interviews they gave for Mary Murphy's documentary \"Harper Lee: Hey, Boo\" presented by PBS in their American Masters series in 2012.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1966, as the result of a casual inquiry, he wrote the children's Christmas story Santa Mouse. That book was followed in 1968 by Santa Mouse Where Are You? and, in 1969, by Santa Mouse Meets Marmaduke. To avoid confusion with the Marmaduke comic strip, this was re-titled Santa Mouse Meets Montague when a compilation of all three books was republished under the title Santa Mouse Stories.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2015 – [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Ornette Coleman[/FONT][FONT=&quot], the alto saxophonist and composer who was one of the most powerful and contentious innovators in the history of jazz, dies in Manhattan at age 85.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]The cause was cardiac arrest, a family representative said.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mr. Coleman widened the options in jazz and helped change its course. Partly through his example in the late 1950s and early [FONT=&quot]'[/FONT]60s, jazz became less beholden to the rules of harmony and rhythm and gained more distance from the American songbook repertoire.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]His own music, then and later, embodied a new type of highly informed folk song: deceptively simple melodies for small groups with an intuitive, collective musical language and a strategy for playing without preconceived chord sequences. In 2007, he won the Pulitzer Prize for his album \"Sound Grammar.\"\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]His early work — a personal answer to his fellow alto saxophonist and innovator Charlie Parker — lay right within the jazz tradition and generated a handful of standards for jazz musicians of the last half-century. But he later challenged assumptions about jazz from top to bottom, bringing in his own ideas about instrumentation, process and technical expertise.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]He was more voluble and theoretical than John Coltrane, the other great pathbreaker of that jazz era. He was a kind of musician-philosopher, whose interests went well beyond jazz. He was seen as a native avant-gardist, personifying the American independent will as much as any artist of the last century.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Slight, Southern and soft-spoken, Mr. Coleman became a visible part of New York City's cultural life, often attending parties in bright satin suits; even when frail he attracted attention. He could talk in sometimes baffling language about harmony and ontology, but his utterances could also be disarming in their freshness and clarity (or become clear on about the 10th time you read them).\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]His music was usually not so oblique. At best, it could be for everybody. Very few listeners today would fail to understand the appeal of his early songs like \"Una Muy Bonita\" (bright, bouncy) and \"Lonely Woman\" (tragic, flamencoesque). His run of records for the Atlantic label near the beginning of his career — especially \"The Shape of Jazz to Come,\" \"Change of the Century\" and \"This Is Our Music\" — pushed through an initial wall of skepticism, ridicule and condescension to be recognized as some of the greatest albums in jazz history.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]His composing voice, and his sense of band interplay, was intact by 1959, when he caught the ear of almost every important jazz musician in the world. He wrote short melody sketches, nearly always in a major key, that could sound like old children's songs or, in pieces like \"Turnaround\" and \"When Will the Blues Leave?,\" brilliant blues lines. With the crucial help of the trumpeter Don Cherry, he organized his band to act like a single organism with multiple hearts.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Randolph Denard Ornette Coleman was born in Fort Worth on March 9, 1930, and lived in a house near railroad tracks. According to various sources, his father, Randolph, who died when Ornette was 7, was a construction worker and a cook; his mother, Rosa, was a clerk in a funeral home. Both, he liked to say, were born on Christmas Day.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]He attended I.M. Terrell High School, a veritable seedbed of modern American jazz. Three three of his future bandmates — the saxophonist Dewey Redman and the drummers Charles Moffett and Ronald Shannon Jackson — were graduates, as were the saxophonists King Curtis, Prince Lasha and Julius Hemphill; the clarinetist John Carter; and Red Connor, a bebop tenor saxophonist who, Mr. Coleman said, influenced him by playing jazz as \"an idea\" rather than as a series of patterns.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Mr. Coleman's melodies may be easy to appreciate, but his sense of harmony was complicated. When he learned to play the saxophone — at first using an alto saxophone his mother gave him when he was around 14 — he had not yet understood that, because of transposition between instruments, a C in the piano's \"concert key\" was an A on his instrument. When he learned the truth, he said, he developed a lifelong suspicion of the rules of Western harmony and musical notation.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]In essence, Mr. Coleman believed that all people had their own tonal centers. He often used the word \"unison\" — though not always in its more common musical-theory sense — to describe a group of people playing together harmoniously, even if in different keys.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]\"I've learned that everyone has their own moveable C,\" he said to the writer Michael Jarrett in an interview published in 1995; he identified this as \"Do,\" the nontempered start of anyone singing or playing a \"do-re-mi\" major-scale sequence. During the same conversation, he said he had always wanted musicians to play with him \"on a multiple level.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"I don't want them to follow me,\" he explained. \"I want them to follow themselves, but to be with me.\"\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Learning by ear, he played alto and then tenor saxophone in rhythm-and-blues and society bands around Texas, backing up vocalists and practicing the honking, gutbucket style that made stars out of Illinois Jacquet and Arnett Cobb. But he had already become entranced by the new kind of jazz known as bebop, and by Parker's imaginative phrasing.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1949, Mr. Colemab joined Silas Green From New Orleans, a popular traveling minstrel-show troupe on its last legs. He was fired in Natchez, Miss., he said, for trying to teach bebop to one of the other saxophonists.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In Natchez, he joined the band of the blind blues singer Clarence Samuels. While on tour with the group, he said, he was beaten by a gang of musicians outside a dance hall in Baton Rouge, La., for playing strangely; as the climax of a story he would repeat ever after in variations, they threw his saxophone down the street, or down a hill, or off a cliff.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Soon afterward, in 1953, he moved to Los Angeles to play with the R&B bandleader Pee Wee Crayton. In 1954, he married the poet Jayne Cortez, with whom he had a son, Denardo. They divorced in 1964. Mr. Coleman's survivors include his son, who played drums with him on and off since the late 1960s, and a grandson.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Also in 1954, he bought a white plastic alto saxophone, which became an emblem of his early years. He stayed in Los Angeles for six years, finding a core group of musicians who were not only interested in playing his music but who also helped define it. They included the trumpeters Mr. Cherry and Bobby Bradford, the drummers Ed Blackwell and Billy Higgins, and the bassist Charlie Haden.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]These musicians were the exceptions; during his Los Angeles period, many wanted nothing to do with Mr. Coleman, a long-haired Jehovah's Witness dressed in clothes made by his wife. He \"looked like some kind of black Christ figure,\" Mr. Cherry said, \"but no Christ anybody had ever seen before.\"\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Mr. Coleman made his first album, \"Something Else!!!! The Music of Ornette Coleman,\" in 1958 for the Contemporary Records label. No recording of Mr. Coleman's holds closer to the model of Charlie Parker. But he adhered less to a strict rhythmic grid than Parker did. Operating on his own sense of time, Mr. Coleman raced and flagged and played his own proud blues lines, diatonic runs and plump, raw, crying notes.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Mr. Coleman made one more record for Contemporary, \"Tomorrow Is the Question!,\" with Percy Heath and Red Mitchell on bass, Shelly Manne on drums and, significantly, nobody on piano. The lack of a pianist to root the music in chords would characterize the sound of Mr. Coleman's music for a long time. The Ornette Coleman Quartet — with Mr. Cherry, Mr. Haden and Mr. Higgins — then recorded six numbers for Atlantic in May 1959. (John Lewis, the pianist for the Modern Jazz Quartet, had glowingly recommended Mr. Coleman to Nesuhi Ertegun of Atlantic Records.)\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]This session was released as \"The Shape of Jazz to Come.\" This was the first great Coleman band; the record's swing and harmonic freedom, its intuitive communication between Mr. Coleman and Mr. Cherry, and its ease with nonstandard ways of playing jazz made it a classic. But it was not released before other events had made Mr. Coleman notorious.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Later that year, Mr. Coleman was invited to the School of Jazz in Lenox, Mass., a summer institution run by John Lewis. In concerts and workshops, Mr. Coleman fascinated some teaching musicians there and alienated others. On hearing him at Lenox, the critic Martin Williams wrote, \"I believe that what Ornette Coleman is playing will affect the whole character of jazz music profoundly and pervasively.\"\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Then, with his quartet, in November 1959 Mr. Coleman hit the Five Spot Café in Manhattan, his first New York gig. A two-week engagement stretched to two and a half months. And suddenly it became fashionable for journalists to ask established jazz musicians what they thought of Mr. Coleman's jolting music.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Many said he was unformed but promising. John S. Wilson, of The New York Times, heard Mr. Coleman at the Five Spot and wrote a few months later that he had initially found his playing \"shrill, meandering, and pointlessly repetitious\" — although by that time Mr. Wilson had begun revising his opinion. The trumpeter Roy Eldridge did his due diligence on Mr. Coleman before forming an opinion. \"I listened to him high, and I listened to him cold sober,\" he said. \"I even played with him. I think he's jiving, baby.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the quartet, Mr. Coleman and Mr. Cherry could solo together harmoniously, yet loosely, sometimes clashing and sometimes flying together. Mr. Haden, the bassist, helped the music cohere by creating a strong tonal center, and the front-line musicians were only loosely tied to the pulse of the drummer. (Mr. Coleman would coin a term for the music's guiding principles: \"harmolodics,\" a contraction of harmony, movement and melody.)\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]In under two years, the group made nine records with Atlantic, including \"Free Jazz,\" using a \"double quartet\" of four musicians in each audio channel. It was not quite \"free jazz,\" though. Despite the great harmonic mobility among the musicians, Mr. Coleman relied on polished written melodies to cut the piece into episodes; rhythmically, Ed Blackwell and Billy Higgins swung hard, and not in free rhythm.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Mr. Coleman's music had such force that even Coltrane said, in 1961, that the 12 minutes he had spent on stage with Coleman amounted to \"the most intense moment of my life.\"[/FONT]\n\nAround this time Mr. Coleman's group began to rupture. Mr. Coleman sought more control of his music and insisted on better pay, reducing his bookings to a dribble. Mr. Haden was hospitalized for heroin addiction. Mr. Cherry, needing work, joined Sonny Rollins. [FONT=&quot]In 1962 Mr. Coleman rented the Town Hall, the New York performance space, to play with his new trio, featuring David Izenzon on bass and Charles Moffett on drums, and on one piece with a string quartet. It was the beginning of Mr. Coleman's public career in classical music, a much more dissonant and self-consciously European-modernist body of work. He retreated from performance and separated himself from New York's emerging free-jazz scene.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]When he reappeared, in 1965, at the Village Vanguard jazz club, he was playing trumpet and violin as well as alto saxophone. He wrote music on a well-paid commission for \"Chappaqua,\" a movie about drug addiction by the Avon cosmetics scion Conrad Rooks. Mr. Rooks rejected the music, for jazz quartet and orchestra, though it was eventually released by Columbia Records.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]In 1966 Mr. Coleman made the album \"The Empty Foxhole,\" with Mr. Haden on bass and Mr. Coleman's son Denardo, only 10 years old, on drums. And in the late '60s, Mr. Coleman bought two floors of an industrial building in SoHo, on Prince Street, beginning his do-it-yourself life in earnest. He called the building Artists House and produced concerts there, and he formed a new band that included Dewey Redman on tenor saxophone. Among its albums, for Blue Note and Columbia, were \"New York Is Now!\" and \"Science Fiction.\"\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Mr. Coleman soon began writing a concerto grosso called \"Skies of America,\" which he recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1972. It was the purest demonstration of his harmolodic principle, with parallel lines for orchestra members to play as written, rather than transposing to fit their instruments' home keys.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]In 1973 he traveled to the Rif mountains of Morocco to collaborate with the famed musicians of Jajouka. A short recording of these encounters, using the Jajouka reed players' untempered approach, appeared on his album \"Dancing in Your Head,\" released in 1977. The collaboration confirmed his belief that the \"concert key\" system of Western tonality was misguided.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"Dancing in Your Head\" marked the beginning of Prime Time, Mr. Coleman's first electric band — it had two guitarists — and a new chapter in his music. Loud, jagged and densely woven, the music took few cues from rock, but it nonetheless had an influence on what would be called post-punk, the sound of late-1970s bands like the Pop Group and the Minutemen.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Meanwhile, Mr. Coleman was releasing records with Prime Time on his own Artists House label, founded in 1977 with the record producer and lawyer John Snyder, and on A&M Records. He appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1979. He moved his base of operations to a building on Rivington Street on the Lower East Side, made his son his manager, and worked with Caravan of Dreams, a new performance center and record label based in his hometown, Fort Worth.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]In 1985 Mr. Coleman collaborated with the guitarist Pat Metheny on the album \"Song X.\" In 1987 he released \"In All Languages,\" a double album, with Prime Time on one disc and his original acoustic quartet on the other. And in 1988 he released \"Virgin Beauty,\" a Prime Time album with Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead on board at times as a third guitarist. In 1991, Mr. Coleman played on Howard Shore's soundtrack to the film \"Naked Lunch,\" based on the novel by William S. Burroughs.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]By this time Mr. Coleman represented the avant-garde establishment. He was awarded a National Endowment of the Arts Jazz Master fellowship in 1984 and made a MacArthur Foundation fellow in 1994. He had reached old-master status on the jazz-performance circuit and gave well-attended concerts — again with a white saxophone, but metal, not plastic.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mr. Coleman formed a new quartet in 2004, with two bassists and Denardo Coleman on drums, and started the Sound Grammar record label. In 2007, the same year he won the Pulitzer Prize, he received a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award and performed at the Bonnaroo festival in Tennessee.

He was 81.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Brown made the country charts as a solo artist, a duet singer, and with the Browns, whose spine-chilling 1959 classic, \"The Three Bells\" was a Number One country song for 10 weeks and also spent four weeks at the top of the pop singles chart. The singer was diagnosed with lung cancer in September of 2014. While undergoing treatment, Plowboy Records released In Style Again, his first solo effort in 40 years. The LP featured guest appearances from fellow Opry stars Vince Gill and Sharon and Cheryl White.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Brown was born April 1st, 1934, in Sparkman, Arkansas, and spent the first decade of his life on a farm, without electricity or running water. On Saturday nights, the family would gather to listen to the Grand Ole Opry. In 1952, his sister, Maxine, entered him into a talent competition at KLRA radio in Little Rock. In spite of not winning the contest, Brown was invited to appear on the station's Barnyard Frolic show. He was soon joined there by Maxine and in 1954 the duo signed with Abbott Records, scoring their first Top Ten country hit, \"Looking Back to See,\" which the pair had also written. Sister Bonnie soon joined the act, which notched hits with \"Here Today and Gone Tomorrow,\" \"I Take the Chance,\" \"Just As Long As You Love Me,\" and \"I Heard the Bluebirds Sing,\" earning rave for their close sibling harmony.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Although they were all considering retirement in the early Sixties, Brown, who had served in the U.S. Army and was running his father's sawmill, was encouraged by RCA producer and label chief Chet Atkins to return to Music City, where they would record the story song based on a French tune titled \"Les Trois Cloches.\" \"The Three Bells,\" the tale of newsboy Jimmy Brown, was a favorite of the Beatles and would go on to be recorded by dozens of acts, including the Carter Family, Roy Orbison and Alison Krauss.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]The Browns joined the Opry in 1963, scoring more hits, including \"Scarlet Ribbons (for Her Hair),\" \"The Old Lamplighter\" and \"Send Me the Pillow You Dream On.\" Although his sisters retired in 1967, that same year Brown recorded the classic \"Pop a Top,\" one of his best-loved solo singles, which would again scale the charts in 1999, as Alan Jackson covered it on his Under the Influence LP.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]From 1967 through 1974, Brown had Top Ten hits which included \"Morning,\" \"Southern Loving,\" \"Sometime Sunshine\" and \"It's That Time of Night.\" In 1976, he teamed with Helen Cornelius for the chart-topping \"I Don't Want to Have to Marry You,\" also earning a CMA Vocal Duo of the Year award. More Top Ten hits would follow.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]By the Eighties, Brown had also hosted several TV series, including Nashville on the Road, The Country Place and the TNN (The Nashville Network) talent showcase, You Can Be a Star.

After recording several singles at the tiny Atlas label, The Three Blazers found fame at Eddie Messner's Philo Records. Composed by Brown, 'Drifting Blues' was an influential hit during the rise of R&B. Refusing to be tied down to a single label, the group enjoyed hit releases at several record companies. Featuring Brown's jazz-blues, elegant, ballady voice, and Moore's jazzy guitar, the group dominated jukeboxes with 'Sunny Road', 'So Long', 'New Orleans Blues' and the perennial favourite, 'Merry Christmas, Baby'. With the addition in 1948 of Johnny Moore's younger brother, jazz guitarist Oscar Moore, both Williams and Brown would soon leave the group.

[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1932 - Charlie Feathers (US singer, guitarist, Rockabilly pioneer) is born. Rockabilly singer and songwriter, Mississippi-born Charlie Feathers was taught to play guitar by bluesman Junior Kimbrough. After leaving school at age 10 to work with his father in the oil fields of Oklahama, Feathers relocated to Memphis in 1950 where he worked as a truck driver at Crown Electric and became friendly with co-worker Elvis Presley. Frequently hanging around the Sun Records studio, Feathers was hired as a demo singer. Adding a smart part to the song, Feathers was given a portion of the songwriting credit of Elvis Presley's final Sun single, 'I Forgot To Remember To Forget'. Although Feathers frequently claimed in interviews to have played a large role in Presley's early sessions, historical evidence has refuted that claim. Recording sporadically in the Fifties at Sun, Meteor and King Records, Feathers garnered little success with singles such as 'Defrost Your Heart' (1955) and the novelty-styled, 'Tongue-Tied Jill' (1956). Enjoying the British rockabilly revival of the late Seventies, Feathers experienced a career boost with the aid of Nick Lowe. A compilation of Feathers' finest output entitled Get With It was released a month before his death. Although remaining a respected figure in music, Feathers sold few records in his career. He died at St. Francis Hospital in Memphis after lapsing into a coma two weeks earlier from a stroke. - Died August 29, 1998.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1937 - Bob \"Chico\" Edwards is born.

Leaving the group in the late Fifties, Edwards settled in New York City where he worked in a number of jazz combos. Returning to Detroit, Edwards joined Nolan Strong for some recording sessions in 1972. He died in Detroit, March 11, 2001.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1937 - Michel Block, Belgian-born American pianist and teacher, is born at Antwerp. He grew up in Mexico, making his debut as a soloist with the National Orchestra in Mexico when he was 16. He then went to N.Y., where he studied at the Juilliard School of Music. He made his N.Y. debut in 1959, then made a successful career as soloist with orchs. in the U.S. and Europe. In 1978 he became a teacher at the Ind. School of Music in Bloomington. In 1987 he became a naturalized American citizen. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1939 - Kent Carter (US cellist, composer) is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1941 - Chick Corea, , influential jazz-fusion pianist, composer (Delhpi I, Toy Dance) is born at Chelsea Mass.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His father was a Latin percussionist of Portuguese origin who took Chick to hear live jazz. Chick began piano at four; Bud Powell was his first jazz inspiration. He studied classical piano as a teenager. In the 1950s in Boston, he played at Wally's Jazz Club, in Phil Barboza's Latin band, and had a trio with Tony Williams and Don Alias. He began studying liberal arts at Columbia University (1958), but decided to become a full-time musician after seeing the Miles Davis group with Coltrane at Birdland (January 1959). Joe Farrell helped introduce him and he began working and recording with Mongo Santamaria, Willie Bobo, and Cal Tjader. In the early 1960s, he worked with Blue Mitchell and Herbie Mann and spent a year accompanying Sarah Vaughan. In March 1968 he recorded Now He Sings,Now He Sobs with Miroslav Vitous and Roy Haynes, which was widely influential; his solo on \"Matrix\" was transcribed, studied, and performed by Lee Konitz and others. He joined Miles Davis's band (mid-1968-mid1970; recording 1972), playing first acoustic, then electric piano at the insistence of the leader. During his tenure, he also became more involved in free improvisation, recording the album Is, on which he also played percussion. After Davis, he led Circle (1970-71) with Dave Holland, Barry Altschul, and Anthony Braxton, and also performed and recorded solo (1971). During this time, he was introduced to Scientology and decided that he wanted his music to be more accessible, \"melodic and lyrical with more traditional rhythms\" and with occasional vocals; he has concentrated heavily since then on composition. Corea has created a distinct musical identity by a conscious incorporation of his Latin roots and experiences and of modem classical music, particularly Bartok. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Corea performed at the Village Vanguard (january 1972) and recorded the album Return to Forever, which became the title of the band that included Farrell, Stanley Clarke, Airto Moreira, and Flora Purim. He, Clarke, and Tony Williams toured with Stan Getz (1972), before turning to full-time touring with Return to Forever. By 1973, the band featured Clarke, Lenny White, and Bill Connors, replaced by Al DiMeola in 1974. Corea began using a broader range of keyboards, including the Moog synthesizer. He settled in Los Angeles in the mid- 1970s and added his friend and eventual wife, singer Gayle Moran, to the group. Return to Forever had six albums reach the Billboard pop album chart in the 1970s, three in the Top 40. He continued using the Return to Forever title for his bands through 1977. Corea then delved into a diverse series of recordings: electronic ensembles, solo piano, chamber music, reunions with Vitous and Haynes (occasionally for tours and recordings since 1981), and acoustic duos with Herbie Hancock (1978, on tour and on recordings) and Gary Burton (occasionally since 1972). Other projects include the Grammy winning Leprechaun, and tours and recordings with Joe Henderson and Freddie Hubbard (1979-82). In June 1982 he recorded duets with European pianists accomplished in both classical music and jazz, Friedrich Culda and Nicolas Economou, the latter including some music of Bartok. He has also recorded Mozart's Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra (with Culda): his own piano concerto was premiered in 1986, but not recorded. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]1985 that was marked by the release of a recording with his new group, the Elektric Band; this also was the beginning of his collaboration with John Patitucci and Dave Weckl, who recorded and performed acoustic trio music as the Akoustic Band. In 1992he and his manager, Ron Moss, formed Stretch Records. Among its early releases have been projects by Bob Berg, Patitucci, Eddie Gomez, and Robben Ford. He also runs the Mad Hatter studio in Los Angeles. He toured in 1996 with his Time Warp quartet in the U.S. and Europe. Also that year, he performed with Bobby McFerrin and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, playing two Mozart concerti and some duets and then made a recording. In 1996 he also toured and recorded with Joshua Redman, Roy Haynes, and others to celebrate the legacy of Bud Powell. He recorded on drums with Wayne Shorter on his record SuperNova.He holds an honorary doctorate from Berklee (1997). He studied martial arts with Portland, Ore. native Fred King some years ago and performed \"Sifu\" for him with his latest group, Origin (1998). Besides his many influential albums, many of Corea's compositions have become new standards in the jazz-fusion movement. These include \"Crystal Silence,\" \"Tones for Joan's Bones,\" \"500 Miles High,\" \"Spain,\" and \"La Fiesta,\" among others.

Then, after wasting a year drinking in the bars in Hong Kong, Farndon returned to Hereford to recuperate. In the spring of 1978, Farndon joined The Pretenders, a London-based band led by transplanted Ohio singer Chrissie Hynde. Adding guitarist James Honeyman-Scott and drummer Jerry Mackleduff, The Pretenders were instant critical and commercial favourites with their post-punk, hard guitar oriented sound.
