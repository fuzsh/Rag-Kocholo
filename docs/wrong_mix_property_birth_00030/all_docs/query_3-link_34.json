        "text": "Brooklyn Decker’s longtime home renovation project has finally paid off. She and husband Andy Roddick’s sprawling 15-acre Austin estate recently found a buyer after a little over a year on the market. (It was most recently listed for $4.65 million, a substantial price cut from the original $6 million they listed it for back in June 2018.)\n\nThe couple purchased it for an undisclosed amount back in 2013, and completed an impressive remodel of the 7,369-square-foot mansion in 2017. The dwelling includes five bedrooms and six and a half bathrooms, with an entirely new master bedroom and master bath added on in the process.\n\n“The world can be so serious,” Decker told People in 2017 during a tour of the home. “When you are home, you should feel good.” The actress and former tennis star's renovations were done with that warm farmhouse vibe in mind, with lots of exposed ceiling beams, finished wood-plank floors, and stone-mantel fireplaces adding rustic charm to the space. Other new additions to the home include an impressive wine cellar and butler’s pantry, and there are also two dining rooms and two living rooms.\n\nThe new master suite features an upgraded master bathroom with an oversized shower and a copper soaking tub, plus three massive walk-in closets and a home office with a wood-burning fireplace. Out back, the property features a massive lagoon-style swimming pool with attached spa, and an outdoor patio area with a firepit.\n\nThough they are parting with this property, the superstar couple hasn’t given up on Austin entirely. Decker and Roddick moved into a smaller house nearby last year. They have also sold off two other properties recently, including their North Carolina mountain retreat for $2.35 million last year and their five-bedroom Los Angeles home for roughly $3.34 million in 2015."
