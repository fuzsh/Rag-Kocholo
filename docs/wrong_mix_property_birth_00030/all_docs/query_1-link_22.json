        "text": "One is prone to tantrums, the other is as gracious in victory as in defeat. The fans love them, McEnroe rates them, and finally American tennis has young men to succeed Sampras and Agassi - and rival the Williams sisters\n\nGaby Wood\n\nSunday 4 May 2003\n\nThe Observer\n\nMartin Amis once said that 'personalities' in tennis were synonymous with 'a seven-letter duosyllable starting with an \"a\" and ending with an \"e\" (and also featuring, in order of appearance, an \"ss\", an \"h\", an \"o\" and an \"l\").' Yet now, after the days of Connors and McEnroe, of Courier and Chang, and towards the end of the careers of Agassi and Sampras, people are mourning those very qualities. Where have all the personalities gone, fans wonder. Who will replace those great American players? What is the future of American tennis?\n\nPart of the answer, at least in the eyes of his elders, is Andy Roddick, a 20-year-old all-American who is currently number six in the world and has one of the fastest serves on the circuit. Pete Sampras, who lost to Roddick in straight sets two years ago, has actually dubbed him 'the future of American tennis'. John McEnroe says he's 'America's brightest hope'. His Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe has compared him to Jimmy Connors, and said he's 'ready to do major damage'. Last month he served the second fastest ace ever (147mph to Greg Rusedski's record 149). He wears his baseball cap backwards, is known for exploding into a rage on the court and driving fans wild by thrashing his racket to the ground. At least three of his opponents claim he feigned injury as a psychological tactic. Far from the decorum once breached by McEnroe at Wimbledon, Roddick's behaviour is welcomed with open arms by crowds desperate for new celebrities. Chris Evert, who knew him as a teenager, says he is 'cocky in the best sense'. His girlfriend is fresh-faced Hollywood actress Mandy Moore, and his nicknames are 'A-Rod' and 'Rock'n'roll Roddick'.\n\nBut there's at least one reason why Roddick is not the new Connors. Whereas Connors was a famously self-centred loner on the circuit, and notoriously indifferent to the attractions of playing for his country in the Davis Cup, Roddick is loyal to his tennis-playing pals, and his proudest moment, he says, has been representing his country. In this, Roddick is not alone. The future of American tennis is not embodied just by him, but by a generation of players - James Blake, Mardy Fish, Robby Ginepri, Taylor Dent - who are all team players, and all friends. Unlike the previous generation, they support each other, hang out together, call each other on their mobiles even when they're not at the same tournament. James Blake says he doesn't imagine that will change: 'I mean, already Andy's turned into a superstar and it hasn't changed at all. I don't see any money or titles getting in the way. We've got some friends for life, I hope.'\n\nTennis aficionados are keen to bracket these people into a single mould, and high hopes for them are in a sense required, not least because, as American novelist and tennis writer Michael Mewshaw points out, 'a lot of the money in tennis is American money. The US pays as much for the rights to broadcast Wimbledon as the rest of the world put together. So in order to get the interest of American TV viewers, it's best if there's an American near the top.' Now the Williams sisters have had such an effect on women's tennis - ratings are up, attendance is up, and previously uninterested sponsors such as McDonald's are putting money into the sport - something similar is wanted in men's tennis.\n\nRoddick is wary of comparisons with the Agassi-Sampras generation (one that included both Courier and Chang, at one time). 'That's one of the best generations in any sport from one country at one time - ever,' he says. 'We could have great careers in our own eyes but I still don't think we could live up to all those guys.'\n\nMaybe he's right to resist the inevitable pressure; some aspects of the previous generation's experience may even be taken as a warning. Andre Agassi remembers his early days with ambivalence: 'I came at a time when tennis needed somebody - when tennis was looking for another American. I had so much notoriety before I really accomplished great things. For me to be doing Nike commercials and never winning a Grand Slam, that left me with a bad rap - all image and no substance.'\n\nJames Blake sees another way to resist categorisation. 'No one needs to inject personality into this generation artificially,' he says. 'There are so many different, exciting stories - there are guys who have so much athletic ability it comes naturally to them, there are guys who come from a place where their only way out of it was tennis. I was five foot three still when I was 17 years old and I never planned on doing this. Mardy Fish could probably have played professional golf if he wanted to. I think showing our different personalities is what needs to be done. I think people need to know what we do off the court.'\n\nI have come to meet Blake and Roddick in Monte Carlo and sure enough, their personalities couldn't be more different. Even watching them practise, you get a sense of Roddick's hard-headed, racket-smashing approach and his invisible aces. Blake, training on another court, shouts apologies to his opponent any time he makes what he considers to be a duff move, and congratulates him on his good shots; ever the gentleman, Blake smiles, and gives the impression of being superhumanly relaxed. After practice, they are each mobbed by crowds of children, who thrust notebooks and oversized tennis balls in their faces for them to sign. Roddick has a following of tough-looking boys who have travelled five hours to watch him play; Blake can't shake off girls who want to have their picture taken with him.\n\nBlake is commonly known as 'the nicest man in tennis', and he's easily the best looking. He has a modelling contract, and last year People magazine voted him 'one of the sexiest men alive'. He is 23, spent two years at Harvard, and is now ranked 28 in the world. Last year he beat Agassi en route to becoming the first African American to win the ATP's Washington title since Arthur Ashe. At the US Open in 2001, he made a name for himself through his magnanimity in defeat. He was playing Lleyton Hewitt, who made what was widely taken to be a racist comment, arguing over a line call and apparently implying that Blake and the black linesman were in cahoots. Hewitt offered an explanation to Blake, and Blake accepted it with grace.\n\nBlake and Roddick's characters seem almost comically opposed. Roddick won't answer questions unless he has in some form or other answered them before (when I ask what it means for him to be an American, he panics. 'I'll have to get back to you on that,' he says). To questions about the game, or about managing his temper, or about which players bring out the best or worst in him, Roddick's staple answer is 'I don't really think about it too much'.\n\nBlake, on the other hand, rarely offers an answer less than five minutes long. Everything is considered, if not frankly agonised over. Arthur Ashe's memoir, Days of Grace, is his favourite book. Both, however are disarmingly sweet. And together, they're like extras from a teen movie like American Pie. 'Dude!' says Roddick, on seeing Blake meditatively munching a baguette, 'Is that the same sandwich from earlier today?' He turns to me and rolls his eyes: 'James is the slowest eater on the planet!'\n\nAndy Roddick was born in Omaha, Nebraska - bang in the middle of America's corn belt. His family moved to Texas when he was four, and then to Florida, so his elder brother could play tennis. The tennis academy both brothers went to was also attended by the Williams sisters, who Roddick remembers seeing 'boppin' around. Just looking back - we never thought...'\n\nHis father invested in franchises of Jiffy Lube, the chain of car mechanics, and his mother was an English teacher. Now they 'don't do much any more', except support his career. Roddick says his parents are 'pretty mellow' - not pushy tennis parents at all. His brother turned out to have back problems, so he never turned pro, and he now runs a school for junior players in Texas. Roddick says his brother doesn't resent his success - he's seven years older. 'It's great to have an older brother who's been there and kind of understands what's going on,' Roddick says.\n\nFor his ninth birthday, Roddick went to the US Open. He went to a Davis Cup final when he was 10. He meant to play tennis just as a means to get into college, but his talent took over: by 2000, he was number one junior in the world, and it seemed inevitable that he should turn pro. That was the year he truly discovered tennis. He was practise partner for the Davis Cup team, and remembers playing Agassi in a night session in Miami. There were close to 15,000 people in the stands, and 'that definitely opened my eyes. I never thought tennis could be like that. It's weird, because I go back to that stadium now and it doesn't seem nearly so big.'\n\nRoddick has found it a little hard adjusting to life on tour. 'In 2001 I went into the year ranked about 160 and ended it about 14. You don't really think about it until it's happened.' But he revels in the supportive crowds. So far, he has a better record on home soil than anywhere else, and doesn't regret his outbursts - first because 'it gives the fans something to look at', and second because 'you have to play to your personality. When I'm on court and I try to stay all bottled up inside I kind of drive myself crazy. So when I feel the crowd, I'm having fun out there if I'm showing my emotions.' (He breezily dismisses rumours that he has seen a sports psychologist to help with anger management.)\n\nFar from being the tortured soul his performance on court might make him seem, Roddick thinks playing tennis is 'a blast', and when he loses, he's only upset for 'Fifteen, 20 minutes. Give me a shower and a little bit of time to myself and I'll be OK.'\n\nBlake's parents met on a tennis court. His white English mother came to America from Banbury, in Oxfordshire, at the age of 17. James was born in Yonkers, New York, and moved to Connecticut when he was six. His father is a sales manager for a medical supplies company and his mother works at the tennis club where he and his brother went as kids. James and Thomas, who is three years older, played a lot of sport, but at the age of 12 decided to focus on tennis. A year later, Blake was diagnosed with the spinal condition scoliosis, which meant he either had to have surgery or wear a back brace up to his armpits for four years, 18 hours a day. He chose the latter, because surgery would have been 'the end of tennis'. After school, he would remove the brace for a few hours in order to practise. For years, he wasn't sure he would grow; now he is 6ft 2in, and if you ask about his back he will get up, bend over and show you the freakish way it curves.\n\nBlake's brother is ranked around 280 in the world - they live together in Florida and play doubles professionally. Although he feels he needs more experience, Blake thinks Harvard, even just for the two years he was there, stood him in good stead because he was 'just a little better prepared for life in general, and also for life after tennis. Because as much as it's really exciting, there are so many things other than tennis. So it's not so much life or death what goes on here, for me. Which I think helps me, because dealing with too much pressure can be detrimental.'\n\nStill, life on tour isn't all straightforward. While Roddick has managed to meet his girlfriend in more than 10 different cities in fewer months, Blake says he 'tried to have a girlfriend' last year but failed. 'When I really like someone, I want to be with them all the time, so I'll skip practice or something. And if I do that, I'm not playing my best tennis, and I don't want to be in a position where I'm either resenting that person for my mistakes, or not giving them 100 per cent. It would take a pretty understanding girl to put up with my situation, because I can't quite find that balance yet. But I'll figure it out.'\n\nBlake plays mixed doubles with Serena Williams - they won the Hopman Cup, the international trophy for teams of two - earlier this year, and she is clearly quite keen on him. 'He could run for president,' she said, 'because he says all the right things. I always have my notebook when I'm talking to James. He's the epitome of a gentleman.' She also admired his muscles, visible in a new sleeveless Nike shirt. Blake laughs when I ask if there's any whiff of romance between them: 'I don't think I could handle some of her boyfriends - she seems to be dating some pretty big guys!'\n\nBlake admires players not because of their strokes, but for 'certain things about their personality'. 'Like when I was a kid,' he explains, 'I looked up to Jim Courier, because he was worked harder than anyone else. And I admired Stefan Edberg because he was such a classy individual - quiet and calm and always collected.'\n\nSo why, I ask, is he being compared to Arthur Ashe, rather than being called the next Jim Courier? Is the comparison in itself racist? 'I don't think it's racist,' Blake says, 'I think it's an absolute honour. To be compared to [Ashe] as a tennis player is pretty impressive, but to be compared to him as a person is just incredible. Everything he did, and all the fame and fortune he gained, and even his fatal disease, he found a way of using that to help others. One day, I'd like to feel that I deserved to be put in the same sentence as him, but I feel like I've got a long way to go.'\n\nAshe said that race was the biggest burden he'd had to bear. Has that been true for Blake? 'Well, luckily there have been people like him to help change it, so I think it has gotten a lot better. I think there are still people who don't realise that it does affect your life to a pretty serious degree. I do my best to not worry about it. I learnt to play tennis at the Harlem junior tennis programme, which is 95 per cent African American probably. Then I went to school in Connecticut , where 95 per cent of my school was white. I had great friends in both places, so I was able to look past it and not think twice about it. Now I've realised it's not always that simple, unfortunately.'\n\nArnold Rampersad is the professor of African American literature at Stanford University and co-author of Ashe's memoir. He thinks 'there is something questionable about calling Blake the next Ashe. Black players are always compared to other black players, even when they much more resemble white players. I don't see much comparison between the two games [Blake's and Ashe's], though Ashe has emerged, 10 years after his death, and even in his lifetime, as the epitome of some kind of gentleman athlete.'\n\nBlake, with his Harvard education, may be compared to that but, Rampersad thinks, there is a deeper reason why the comparison is misplaced. 'There's not the same occasion for Blake to be Arthur Ashe, because of the period of civil rights. To talk about Blake in terms of Ashe is slightly off-kilter, because while discrimination still exists, it's not the same at all. Blake has a much easier road to hoe, as they say.'\n\nRampersad wonders more generally though: 'Why hasn't there been an African American male tennis player of the status of Ashe, or better than Ashe? It's said that tennis is a white middle class sport, and it is but it's still odd that no one has surfaced, because there's a sizeable middle-class black population in this country.'\n\nThat is now changing. 'Before I got a little better known,' Blake tells me, 'people would see me walking around with my tennis racket and the first question any African American would ask me is: \"Hey, do you know Serena? Have you ever played Serena? Can you hook me up with her?\" I think that's great, because you know they're not tennis fans. And that's what I strive to do - to get more people to watch tennis, to turn people into tennis fans.'\n\nIn terms of race, Rampersad believes that tennis is 'a very important sport'. It is, he says, like when Jackie Robinson became the first black player to break into major league baseball: 'baseball is so significant in the American male psyche, and in another sport it may not have been so significant.'\n\nBlake wants tennis to be more like baseball. 'I think it's still a little tough with all the rules, you know, having to be quiet and everything. I'd rather see more personality in the crowds - baseball players can deal with 60,000 people screaming while they're trying to hit a 95mph fast ball - I don't see why we can't. I think it's just tradition that's holding us back.'\n\nA brief history of American men. Tennis men, that is...\n\nBefore the Second World War\n\nBill Tilden was extraordinarily successful in the Twenties, winning seven US Open titles and three at Wimbledon; in the Thirties it was Don Budge who set new standards for consistency. After winning Wimbledon and the US Open in 1937, a year later Budge added the French and Australian titles to become the first player to win the Grand Slam.\n\nThe Trabert generation\n\nIn the Fifties, too, American tennis was dominated by one player: Tony Trabert. He won 10 grand slam titles between 1950 and 1955. In the early part of that decade Dick Savitt and Victor Seixas also won slams.\n\nThe barren years\n\nFrom the late Fifties through all of the Sixties, the one truly exceptional US player was Arthur Ashe, the first black man to win the US Open, in 1968. Two years later he won the Australian Open and in 1975 he won Wimbledon.\n\nConnors-McEnroe era\n\nWorld tennis in the decade from 1974 was dominated by two Americans, Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe, and and one Swede, Bjorn Borg. Brash left-hander Connors was world No 1 for the five years from 1974 and won five US Opens, two Wimbledons and one Australian Open. McEnroe, another left-hander and seven years his junior, was an even better player, even if histrionics sometimes obscured the sublime talent which won him four US Opens and three Wimbledons.\n\nSampras-Agassi era\n\nUS tennis had perhaps its greatest era in the Nineties, led by Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, who were born within 16 months of one another. Sampras, the younger of the two, became the youngest winner of the US Open at 19 in 1990. It was the first of a record 14 grand slam titles, the last being the US Open last year. Agassi secured his first at Wimbledon in 1992 and has had a spectacular revival in the past three years - after a turbulent off-court life - including retaining his Australian Open title earlier this year. Sampras and Agassi dominated their era, but two other Americans won grand slam titles over these years: Michael Chang, who beat Sampras to a grand slam title by winning the French in 1989 (at just 17 and three months, the youngest grand slam champion); and Jim Courier, who won the French and Australian Opens twice.\n\nPrintable version | Send it to a friend | Clip"
