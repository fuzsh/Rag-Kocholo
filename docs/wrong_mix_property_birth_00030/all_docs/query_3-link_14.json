        "text": "It’s been seven years since Andy Roddick called it a tennis career, and it “feels like a former life at this point.”\n\nRoddick, now 36, retired after the 2012 US Open. He has put the sport behind him for the most part. In 2017, his wife, model and actress Brooklyn Decker, revealed Roddick had gotten rid of most of his tennis trophies — though he has held onto his hardware from winning the 2003 US Open. And Roddick said he encourages their 4-year-old son, Hank, and 1-year-old daughter, Stevie, to forge their own paths.\n\n“I don’t know, we’re so far from it, I always say you kind of expose them to as much as you can,” Roddick told The Post with the US Open set to begin Monday. “In my case, I played a lot of sports, and I feel like the sport chooses you sometimes, and so, I am very sensitive to not make my thing his thing. We actually don’t have any tennis stuff in our house.”\n\nRoddick’s professional focus is now on the Andy Roddick Foundation, which serves children in Austin, Texas, as well as on business partnerships, most notably with IHG Hotels & Resorts. Roddick will be taking part in an exclusive clinic at Flushing Meadows, which will include in-person coaching and tennis drills, among other on-site happenings.\n\nThat’s as close as he’ll get to the action, though.\n\n“For a while like my ego needed to know that I could still play,” Roddick, who is two years younger than Roger Federer, said of his retirement seven years ago.\n\n“I retired and I was still top-15 in the world or whatever it was, and I knew, I’d say for about four years post-retirement, I was pretty confident that my retirement was a choice. Whereas now I don’t think it’s a choice anymore. I don’t think even if I had all the motivation in the world that I could do it with the way that everyone’s playing now.”\n\nAs for what’s taking place on the courts at the Open, Roddick said he believes 15-year-old sensation Coco Gauff is an “amazing talent,” but he wants her post-Wimbledon hype to be moderated.\n\n“I hope the powers that be ease her in gently into the spotlight because doing it in England, when there’s no expectation involved is one thing,” Roddick said. “I personally hope that they don’t throw her on Arthur Ashe Stadium the first night match of the US Open as a showcase. She will get there, she is that good, I hope people will just give her the time and space that she should have.”"
