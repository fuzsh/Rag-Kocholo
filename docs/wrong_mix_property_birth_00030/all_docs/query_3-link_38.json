        "text": "Andy’s tennis career began to blossom when he won the Junior US Open and Australian Open singles titles in 2000. His Junior career highlights included six world singles titles and seven world doubles titles. Andy finished as the #1 ranked Junior in the U.S. in 1999-2000, and #1 Junior in the world in 2000. Andy turned pro in 2000.\n\nEarly in his career, Andy established the Andrew S. Roddick Foundation. The goal of the Foundation is to improve the quality of life and enhance educational and economic opportunities for all children based on the principles of respect for family, education and morality. Since its inception, the Foundation has raised over $10 million. Andy received The Arthur Ashe Humanitarian award in 2005 for his charitable efforts and contributions, and the Arthur Ashe Prestigious Leadership Award for Urban Health in 2007. In 2009, Andy also received the Heineken Star Award for achieving success both athletically and philanthropically.\n\nIn 2003, he captured the US Open title and the #1 ranking in the world. In 2003, Andy was honored as the ATP Player of the Year. He finished the year ranked #1, making him the youngest American to ever reach that feat. In 2004, Andy won the ESPY for “Best Male Tennis Player.” From 2000 through 2010, Andy continually ranked as a top 10 player in the world. He has reached the finals of Wimbledon three times. He has played in 42 Davis Cup matches and led the team to victory in 2007. Andy still holds the record for the fastest serve ever – 155 MPHs.\n\nIn 2009, Andy married model and actress Brooklyn Decker.\n\nAndy has been featured in non-sports publications ranging from Rolling Stone to Vogue. Some of the most interesting profiles have included an item written by Sir Elton John for Interview Magazine, and being selected as the Sexiest Athlete in 2003 by People Magazine’s “Sexiest Man Alive” issue. Proving his versatility, Andy has hosted Saturday Night Live and made a cameo in Adam Sandler’s movie, Just Go With It.\n\nRoddick has headlined national advertising campaigns for Lacoste, Babolat, Rolex, American Express and Lexus, as well as participating in promotional spots for ESPN Sportscenter."
