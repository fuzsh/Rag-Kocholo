A year later, built this custom home, which is located within the Wade Hampton community and golf club. Construction on the house was finished shortly after Roddick, the former world number one tennis champion, officially retired from the circuit.\n\nThe four-bedroom, five-bathroom house on Silver Springs Lake was designed by Travis Miletti and built by Ben Harris, per the listing. Roddick and Decker originally listed the home for $2.99 million in June 2016, notes WWD, but the price steadily decreased in tiny increments until the most recent ask of $2.48 million, at which point the home went into contract—the final sales price was $2.35 million.\n\nThe master suite is on the main level, with a “secret” lofted sitting room in the area above, as well as double closets and bathrooms with a steel-and-glass enclosed shower. The four additional guest rooms are all en-suite, as well. There are antique timber accents, oak plank floors and reclaimed wood ceilings throughout the 4,549-square-foot abode, as well as a number of large stone fireplaces."
