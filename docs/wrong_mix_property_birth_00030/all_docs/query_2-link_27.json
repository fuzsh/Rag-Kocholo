        "text": "Long before Andy Roddick, the US Open champion, had ever hit a tennis ball in anger, the grass courts of SW19 were a fascination to him. ' Breakfast at Wimbledon ,' he drawls. 'Every kid in America watched it growing up. You know, you wake up and it's on. I was just amazed, really transfixed in front of the TV. I remember all the Becker-Edberg finals.'\n\nRoddick, who could hardly be more different to the quiet, understated Edberg if he tried, goes into Wimbledon as the second seed. He is in the same half of the draw as Tim Henman and if Britain's number one makes it to yet another semi-final at the All England Club it will probably be Roddick, America's number one, who stands in his way. Roger Federer beat Roddick in a one-sided semi-final last summer but Roddick, fresh from retaining his title on the lawns of Queen's Club, believes he can win the title this year and emulate the 2002 winner, Lleyton Hewitt, by doing it from the baseline.\n\n'I like grass, I enjoy it and it suits my game. I felt I played really well last year. I was cruising through rounds and I had a chance against Roger [Federer], a set point in the opener, but it just didn't fall for me, so at that stage I felt like I was playing well enough to win. I feel I could do some damage at Wimbledon with my serve.'\n\nHow does he view the threat of the world number one, ahead of Wimbledon? 'Man, I have a lot of rivals so I don't think about a match with Federer. The thing about him is, we have to be way deep into a tournament to play. So I'm not worried about him going into a competition.'\n\nLast September, the 21-year-old from Omaha, Nebraska, employed that bazooka serve (a record 153mph on his way to last week's victory at Queen's) to send down three aces and close out an emphatic, straight-sets victory at Flushing Meadow against Juan Carlos Ferrero to win the US Open. He had previously won from two sets and match point down against David Nalbandian in the semi-final. That first grand slam provided a release from the incessant pressure heaped on him by the American media, who had been playing him up as the man to take over from Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi.\n\nJust for good measure, he then ended the year as the world's top player. 'The selfish thing about an athlete is you always look at the side of things where you say I could've done that better. But if you had told me before Wimbledon last year I'd win a major and finish number one I would've taken it.\n\n'But I don't want to be a one-slam wonder, the worst number one player of all time. If I could win four or five slams that would be awesome for me. It's insane, it's nuts. I used to go to the US Open on my birthdays and sit in the nosebleeds. I never dreamed of it because it wasn't realistic.'\n\nFollowing that victory, Roddick talked of feeling strangely calm during the match. 'I've felt like that possibly three or four times in my life. It's happened a couple of times on big stages, where it's like I didn't feel anything. I try not to think about it too much, because I'd love for it to happen again sometime. I really can't explain it. I mean you're serving for your first grand slam and three aces and you're done.'\n\nHaving won in his homeland, Wimbledon is his next big target - the one he most craves. 'The one I'd like to win is Wimbledon,' Roddick says. 'It's the intimacy, the exclusiveness of the club, how it's tucked away in a neighbourhood. It's not like New York where there's a huge stadium and it's, like, bam!\n\n'Wimbledon's been around for ever, at least it seems that way. I've never been in England at any time except Wimbledon time, but the amount of coverage it gets is insane. In the States, tennis is sixth or seventh on the totem pole as far as sports go.'\n\nDespite the grind of the tour, Roddick has a refreshing sparkle to his eyes and is genuinely thankful for his talent and success. 'You're in foreign places, often by yourself. You wanna throw the phone sometimes, that's your only communication. But, you know, that's the one negative among the millions and millions of positives.'\n\nOne of those pluses is having the dollars to buy a new home in Shimmering Cove, a prime spot on the Colorado River, 10 minutes drive from downtown Austin, Texas.\n\nRoddick was four when his family moved there to allow older brother, John, to play tennis. 'I fell in love with this city. I mean, if you take a boat down the river to the lake you can't not. And it has a really cool vibe downtown with live music and jazz clubs. It's such a healthy place, you can go out to the hills, and there's bike trails.'\n\nRoddick's house, a few doors up from the former home of Tour de France hero Lance Armstrong, is modest. Its focal point is the black marbled kitchen that opens out on to comfortable sofas and a red, slate-bed pool table. Outside there is a mini-size tennis court.\n\n'I'm really proud of this house,' he says. 'It's a fantasy. It was always one of my dreams to move back and buy a place that I considered to kick ass. And to be able to do it on my third year on the tour makes it so much better.'\n\nAnd the Lilliputian tennis court? 'I play on that with friends for fun, with a sponge ball. For practice I like driving out. Doing the normal things like buying your balls and booking your courts. I enjoy that.'\n\nIn a tennis era lacking on-court characters, Roddick's enthusiasm and effervescence is good for the sport. As is true of anyone with personality, however, he is not for everyone. On the way to winning the US Open, Roddick defeated Ivan Ljubicic in the second round. The Croatian claimed in the post-match press conference that no one in the locker room liked Roddick because of his demonstrative on-court behaviour.\n\n'We're not friends by any stretch of the imagination,' says Roddick, 'but we're always cordial. After he'd made that statement, I passed him in the hall and he said, \"Happy birthday, dude.\" [Roddick was 21 the following day.] So I didn't realise at the time. I called him that night and said, \"Don't speak on behalf of everyone else. I don't think it's fair to speak for every other player.\" I was actually flattered by the amount of people that were asked about it and were pretty supportive. If someone doesn't like me, they don't like me. I'm pretty cordial with everyone, I don't try and step on anyone's toes.'\n\nRoddick has been coached for the past year by Brad Gilbert, former coach of Andre Agassi and author of Winning Ugly . He describes Gilbert's influence as being to fine-tune his game, rather than to impose himself. Quick with a quip, Roddick speaks of the 'dog and a tree' approach of some other coaches. He is also good on self-depreciation, declaring: 'I try not to talk about my weaknesses, I'm in denial.' And, with regard to his name, he declares: 'Rod-dick. I had many years of psychological issues with that.'\n\nOff court, as well as on, it has been a year rich in incident for Roddick since Gilbert took over. Last November, Roddick hosted Saturday Night Live . Why? 'What's an ultimate honour in England? Every person has gone to meet the Queen,' he says. Not quite true, but the point is taken. 'That's kind of where the show is.' Was he not concerned about making a fool of himself? 'I was expecting to,' he says with a grin. 'It was just positive. A totally different dynamic, a rush.'\n\nLast month, ahead of the Italian Open in Rome, Roddick was woken at five in the morning in his sixth-floor suite at the Parco dei Principi hotel by fumes. He opened the door, was hit with a wall of smoke, and saw a dozen people outside, choking. Roddick called them into his room and, realising the fire brigade had not yet arrived, called his mother in Florida for help. It was a good idea. He explained to her that guests, including the Dutch player Sjeng Schalken, were jumping down on to his balcony for refuge, and his mother told him to soak towels and seal the doors with them.\n\n'It's amazing how calm I feel,' he told her. Then, the fire engines arrived. 'Hey, you guys with the ladder, if you come here I'll buy you pizza,' he shouted, still surprisingly unshaken. 'I caught Sjeng, then his wife. We helped the others down and we waited.' Three people died in the fire. His mother was there for him, but not his girlfriend. A few weeks before that ordeal, Roddick had ended his long-term relationship with the Hollywood actress Mandy Moore, but this is one topic he does not wish to discuss.\n\nHe is much more talkative about London's attractions during Wimbledon fortnight. 'I've been to the theatre here. And I think the city has great food. Some of the restaurants are amazing. I mean, I can't just sit inside and eat room service - I've even eaten fish and chips.'\n\nCan he wander the London streets without being approached? 'Yeah sure, though it may be different since everything's happened. But when I was over here last year for 28 days, David Beckham was on the front pages of the sports sections like 23 times, so I don't even compare. I've seen the madness.'\n\nRoddick will need to gather a little more media space for himself with a triumph on men's finals day at Wimbledon. It could be a memorable 4 July for the player who admits he has tears in his eyes when the 'Star Spangled Banner' plays at Davis Cup ties. There are, though, some impromptu musical offerings from Wimbledon he would rather miss.\n\n'If they put the roof on Centre Court I'm sure it'll affect the playing conditions, but I think it's great that they stepped it up. It'll still be pouring on the outside courts, though, dude. I mean, keep the party going, we don't wanna hear Cliff Richard sing any more.'\n\nYears, then, after first watching Becker, Edberg, Agassi et al, on his television screen as his mum served him breakfast, Roddick is still passionate about Wimbledon. 'There's the excitement it brings if you tell your friends, \"Oh man, I got tickets for Centre Court at Wimbledon.\" You know that means something to anybody on the streets in London. Whereas if you say, \"I got tickets for the Arthur Ashe court at the US Open,\" it's like, \"Oh cool, who's playing?\"\n\nYou know, you can go watch some terrible mixed doubles match but if it's on Centre Court it's still pretty cool. 'I like playing on Centre Court. It's a different beast, you feel like people are there for the tennis.'"
