        "text": "Wimbledon: Clare Balding looks forward to seeing new stars of tennis\n\nIf it hadn't been for Roger Federer, Andy Roddick could have ended his career as a triple Wimbledon champion, but it wasn't meant to be. The 6ft 2\" American was foiled by his Swiss nemesis on no fewer than three occasions in the final at the All England club in 2004, 2005 and agonisingly over five sets in 2009.\n\nBut A-Rod, as he was known, can still look back on an outstanding career that saw him clinch his only Grand Slam title, the US Open, in 2003 - eventually becoming the number one ranked player in the world in November of that year.\n\nRoddick racked up 32 titles during his time on the professional circuit, earning himself £16.3m in prize money for his efforts, making him currently the 25th all-time leader in tennis earnings.\n\nDuring that time, he also enjoyed lucrative partnership deals with racket-maker Babolat Pure Drive Line, Lacoste, Lexus, American Express, Rolex, Microsoft, Arizona Beverage Company and Powerade, all helping him to grow substantial wealth alongside his on-court achievements.\n\nRoddick finally retired in 2012 after defeat at the US Open to Juan Martin del Potro and was honoured in a special ceremony at the Arthur Ashe Stadium a few days later.\n\nHe is married to model and actress Brooklyn Decker, who he first came across when he noticed her on a CNN show. He managed to get his agent to contact Decker's agent and before long they were dating.\n\nThe pair married in April 2009 and live between millionaire residences in Austin, Texas and North Carolina. One of their notable previous abodes is a mansion on the shore of Silver Spring Lake in the vacation town of Cashiers, that has been featured on the US television show Architectural Digest. Its modern rustic design was dreamt up by Roddick's wife and is commended in the programme. After owning the lakefront retreat for five years, it was eventually sold at a profit for £1.8m.\n\nWhen the American tennis star is not spending time at home with Decker and their two children he is probably out and about in one of the vehicles that makes up his fleet of luxury cars, some of which can go as fast as his renowned 155mph serve. Top of the class is a Bentley Continental GT worth £160,000 but he also owns Porsche Cayenne, a Mercedes ML-Class and a Lexus SC430.\n\nBut just as expensive as some of his cars is Roddick's prized timepiece. The 40-year-old wears an 18-carat gold Rolex Daytona watch that is worth around £40,000.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He recently invested in Cure Hydration and is the co-founder of Sweetens Cove Fine Bourbon and the virtual health service ViewFi. He has a stake in the Golf brand Travis Mathew Apparel and is a business partner of IHG Hotels.\n\nSince calling it a day on the courts, Roddick has hosted his own successful radio show for Fox and now provides expert analysis for the Netflix tennis show Breakpoint.\n\nHe also has big charitable interests, running the Andy Roddick Foundation, which has raised over £31.6m for worthy causes.\n\nA family man, Roddick has put no pressure on his young children to follow in his sporting footsteps and is keen for the boys to take their own paths in life. But if they want to find evidence of their dad's notable achievements they won't find too many reminders hanging around the house.\n\nRoddick has got rid of almost all of the trophies that he won throughout his career, apart from one - his only Grand Slam triumph the US Open. But if Roger Federer hadn't been around at the same time that he was playing, perhaps he would have kept at least three more."
