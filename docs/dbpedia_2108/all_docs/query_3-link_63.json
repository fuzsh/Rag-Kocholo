        "text": "Globalization, which has far-reaching effects, transforms many phenomena with it. The phenomenon of urbanization, which has a direct relationship with globalization, becomes a structure increasing economic growth at a certain level together with industrialization where social, economic and political transitions and even inconsistencies are experienced. Cities transformed by the effects of globalization lead to the formation of new cities and, in association with this, new problems. Cities that have become centers of consumption have developed into a structure where the economic gap between the inhabitants, the polarization with socio-cultural differences, and the chaos with spatial and environmental changes are effective. Cities that are struggling with problems such as the exclusion of city-dwellers, changing the city silhouette in accordance with the demands of capital owners, and social inequality are now attracting the attention of many branches of science. Overpopulation, migration, sustainable development, and environmental problems, which are among today's problems, increase with the phenomenon of urbanization. The transformation of cities with globalization is the main focus of this study. The effects of this transformation on cities constitute the purpose of this study. This study which deals the current state of cities, by examining the relationship between globalization and urbanization, aims to contribute to the field of social sciences in this regard.\n\nUrbanization is a centuries old phenomenon. Despite numerous attempts to capture various aspects of urbanization and its impact on human habitat, the thirst for knowledge of this complex process still remains a great importance among many quarters of human inquiry. Since the second half of the twentieth century, urbanization has become an alarming social process in the world, particularly in developing countries. While continuing the urbanization process in the already more urbanized developed world, three fourths of the total population lives in urban areas in Latin America and the Caribbean; one third of the population of Africa and Asia lives in urban areas. Urbanization is the most critical process and form of global transformation, which has mirrored uneven development between regions, within regions, and within countries. The developing world presents a more precarious condition with exponential population growth unparallel to their economic and social progress. At the turn of...\n\nIn this paper, I propose to set out some thoughts about theory and research on global urbanism. I use this term for convenience&#39;s sake, because no single concept sufficiently describes how our understanding of cities and space is actually being shaped by a turn in world events that began more than a generation ago, when new technologies in communication and transport were becoming available that would allow for the first-ever coordination of a global system production and markets in something approximating real time. By the late 1970s, corporate capital in the capitalist West was in a serious crisis of accumulation that led not only to the search for lower-cost production sites &quot;off-shore&quot; but also to an extraordinary concentration of capital, as smaller corporations were bought out and merged with dinosaur-sized conglomerates. The visible results were both, a shift of many production facilities abroad and de-industrialization at home. Thus was born the idea of a post-..."
