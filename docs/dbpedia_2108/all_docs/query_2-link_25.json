Wanted to pay my domains in US$. I put my CORRECT 5 digit zip code. Everything correct. 162$ off Revolut (at least for the moment) and website says “Your card number and postal code do not match”.\n\nExactly for those transactions when virtual cards are advisable, Revolut fails.\n\nLook Revolut - to pay at the supermarket in my home town, I don’t need your card!\n\nBut for those international internet transactions - in different currenc - this is where the card is useful - but fails.\n\nSo I did as advised above. I linked my Revolut card to PayPal. Then I paid with PayPal.\n\nImportant - MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT USE PAYPALS CURRENCY CONVERSION. On the order page at the bottom you see a note where you need to click and then the conversion options come up. And set it in accordance to your balance."
