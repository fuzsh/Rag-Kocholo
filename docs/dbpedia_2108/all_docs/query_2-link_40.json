        "text": "I wish to report the bad conducts of some officers of the Nigeria Police Force who are less concerned about the good image which the Inspector General of Police is building for the force. In defiance of the \"operation no road blocks\" policy of the present IGP, some officers have continued mounting road blocks and extorting money from motorist at Ora-Igbomina area in Osun State.\n\nThe the exact locations where these illegal roadblocks are mounted include Ora-Igbomina between Siraju Primary School (Ora town) and Oan-Ekiti town.\n\nI have informed higher authorities using the contacts on your website but the roadblocks still operate till date.\n\nThese bad eggs within the police force who taint/mar the image of the police should be checked without further delay because they constitute a threat to citizens' peace.\n\nThank you.\n\nWale S. from Osun.\n\n- #\n\nIt is sad to learn that some officers of the Nigerian police no longer protect and serve instead they extort money from it citizens. The following division namely, New Benin police division, SARS Benin, Zone 5 Adesuwa.\n\nThey now find pleasures in harassing and maltreating youth of Benin City. I was about entering my bank at Akpakpava when a bus blocked me from entering the bank. I was so afraid when I realized that it was the new Benin police division and they were not on uniforms just bullet proof AND GUNS and they ask me where I was going and I told them I am trying to retrieve my ATM CARD with the bank.\n\nThey forced me to enter the bus without any crime, they removed everything on me; my wallet and phone inclusive. They searched through my phones and they also saw a deposit slip of 40, 000 Naira with me. They asked where I got the money from and I said from my parents and that money was meant for my school fees. Immediately they put a false allegation on me that I am a fraudster popularly known as yahoo boy. They insisted that they will collect N20,000 thousand from me or they will send me to Abuja for fraud.\n\nPlease this is violation of human right. let the authority place a monitory team on the so called surveillance team\n\nI LOVE MY COUNTRY NIGERIA\n\n--SAMSON, Benin City\n\n- #\n\nI write to report an abuse perpetrated by some police officers in Lagos state; it happens in Lagos almost on a daily basis but this time, I was the victim.\n\nAt about 4.30pm today (16-Dec-2013), we were accosted by four police officers (in mufti) along airport road from Oshodi, who wrongly accused us of driving ONE-WAY and that they were attached to Lagos State Task Force. They identified themselves with Nigerian Police ID card.\n\nWe inquired why there was no LASTMA official with them if truly they were attached to traffic task force (there was no convincing response) and we therefore did not succumb to them. They then decided we go to Makinde Divisional office with them but we insisted we would go to Akinpelu police Division so we can be sure of their identity and that they are not on illegal duty.\n\nWhile we successfully took them to Church Street, two of them (the police officers) brought out Pistol and they were drunk. They insisted on taking N20,000 but they forcefully took N5,000 from me.\n\nI successfully identified one of them as PATRICK ABAH.\n\n- #\n\nSeveral cases of people being unlawfully molested by officers of the Nigeria police force had gone unnoticed and unreported. Eniola Samuel Daniel went through an awful experience in the den of a police officer he identified as Fegbon Olabode on Sunday 16 Nov. 2013 on his way home from a church in Kosofe in Lagos.\n\nHe shares his experience\n\nI was molested and treated like a Criminal by a Police officer, Fegbon Olabode and left with nothing to tell or conceive in my heart than pain and hatred for my own fatherland.\n\nThis is what happened, I was returning from church on this fateful day and when I got to the bus stop at Kosofe, I boarded a bus going to my destination (Oshodi) unknown to me that the driver had committed an offense that brought the present of a police officer into the bus. My thought was that the police was just a passenger going to the same destination.\n\nAfter moving for 30 minute from where the bus took off, the police ordered the driver to stop the car and get everybody off the bus. This was beside barrack before Oshodi in LASTMA office and this happened at 12:50 pm. We started pleading on behalf of the driver. Some women eventually got fed up and started wrangling with the officer.\n\nWe continued to to plead with the police to allow the driver take us to where we are going or talk to the driver to refund our money so we can get another bus.\n\nThe officer rather surprised all of us with his response; the response was gruesome as he opened up tear gas on everyone, he called on his colleague and all the boys in the disputed bus were arrested including me.\n\nHow I was brutalized\n\nI was hit with a gun and dragged to their base, I was slapped and beaten for doing nothing, I was tear-gassed the second time, hit with iron.\n\nWhen their boss came around, Olabode (the police officer who arrested us) was asked why we are in their custody, he replied that many of the boys were taking pictures of him and some were recording, while I dragged his gun with him.\n\nAfter much explanation, their boss, without any trouble, freed everyone to go home.\n\nI am saying this because am having problem with hearing as I write you this, I went to the hospital but could not afford the hospital bill. I have nobody in Lagos, No lawyer; justice is not even in my support. I am in pain and I can not do anything to help my self. Many people are brutalized and killed for nothing in the hand of police.\n\nNigeria Police Watch condemn this reckless act of the police and call on all relevant authorities to ensure that bad eggs in the system are fished out and dealt with appropriately.\n\n- #"
