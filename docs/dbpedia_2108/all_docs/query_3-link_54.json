C, September 22, 1931. Sir: In compliance with the provisions of section 345, Revised Statutes of the United States, I have the honor to submit herewith a report covering the operations of the mints and assay offices of the United States for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1931, being the fifty-ninth annual report of the Director of the Mint. There is also submitted for publication in connection therewith the annual report of this bureau upon the production and consumption of the precious metals in the United States for the calendar year 1930. OPERATION OF THE MINTS AND ASSAY OFFICES Institutions of the mint service During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1931, 10 mint-service institu- tions were in operation; coinage mints at Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Denver; assay office at New York, which makes large sales of fine gold bars; mints at New Orleans and Carson City conducted as assay offices ; and assay offices at Boise, Helena, Seattle, and Salt Lake City. The six last-named institutions are, in effect, bullion-purchasing agencies for the large institutions and also serve the public by making assays of ores and bullion. Electrolytic refineries are operated at the New York, Denver, and San Francisco institutions. Coinage The domestic coinage executed during the past fiscal year was the smallest in both value and pieces for many years, notwithstanding the 84,181,000 bronze 1-cent pieces (value $841,810) made to replenish stock. The total number of domestic pieces executed was 98,236,500, with value $6,615,110, as compared with the prior year's 399,467,200 pieces valued at $16,278,180. Gold coin valued at $4,570,000 was made to clean up small lots of partially worked metal; the subsidiary silver coinage totaled $795,300 face value, and 5-cent nickel coins had face value of $408,000. The foreign coinage executed likewise was of small volume, 2,355,120 pieces of gold and silver, made at the Philadelphia Mint, comparing with the prior year's 3,485,000 pieces of silver, nickel, and bronze. The grand totals of pieces executed compare as follows : Fiscal vear 1931, 100,591,620; 1930, 402,952,200. Gold operations Gold acquired by the Government at the several mint-service institutions during the fiscal year 1931 totaled $210,791,181.04; United States gold coin received by the mints for recoinage amounted to $3,358,729.61; transfers of gold between mint offices totaled 3 4 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE MINT $10,503,728.38; the aggregate amount of gold received by the several mint-service institutions during the fiscal year 1931 was $224,713,- 039.03, which compares with $457,045,502.02 during the prior year. Silver operations Receipts of purchased silver during the fiscal year 1931 totaled 2,193,313.53 fine ounces, the average cost of which was 32.01 cents per ounce, total cost being $715,231.83. This includes 999,350.34 fine ounces refined silver bought in the open market for coinage. Silver received in exchange for bars bearing the Government stamp totaled 1,308,000.79 fine ounces; United States silver coin received for recoinage totaled 3,015,195.75 fine ounces, the recoinage value being $4,997,078.59; silver deposited in trust by other governments totaled 509,001.57 fine ounces; and transfers between mint-service offices totaled 100,327.00 fine ounces, making the aggregate quantity of silver received by the several mint-service offices during the fiscal year 7,851,899.24 fine ounces, as compared with 10,035,781.97 ounces during the prior year. The New York market price of silver during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1931, averaged $0.31879; the lowest price was $0.200025, on February 10, 1931, the lowest ever recorded, and the highest price $0.373125, on September 18, 1930. London's lowest price of 12 pence per standard ounce was recorded February 9, 1931. Refineries The refinery at the New York assay office was not operated during the fiscal year just past. In anticipation of moving into a new build- ing being constructed outside the congested financial district the refinery was dismantled and a thorough clean-up made for reco\\ ery of metals absorbed by apparatus, etc. The refineries operated at Denver and San Francisco produced 1,305,444 fine ounces (40.8 tons) of electrolytically refined gold during the past fiscal year, which compares with 94.47 tons in the prior year from the three refineries; and 1,811,- 491 fine ounces (02.1 tons) of electrolytically refined silver, which compares with 1 08.2 tons during the prior year from the three refineries. The stock of gold and silver in unrefined bullion on hand was increased during the past year by about 89 tons, to 529 tons, as com- pared with the prior year's increase of about 28 tons. Additions and improvements The following improved devices were introduced in the mint institutions during the fiscal year under review: Electric melting of gold and silver deposits has been established as regular practice at the Philadelphia mint and New York assay office. This became possible as the result of improvements in design and modernization of equipment for electric induction melting, together with the commercial manufacture of suitable crucibles, of carbon bonded silica carbide. At Philadelphia the installation consists of two furnaces that accommodate standard No. 20 crucibles and three smaller furnaces. These provide for the melting of all deposits weigh- ing up to 1 ,200 ounces. The installation at New York is a temporary arrangement pending removal to the new building being erected. WALTER REED MEDAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE MINT This type of melting results in much lower heat-radiation with cor- responding greater comfort for personnel, reduces molting losses of precious metals, and increases uniformity of mixture of the bars produced. Costs compare favorably with oilier means of producing melting temporal u res when full operation of the institution gives high electric current consumption with resulting low unit costs of current. The grinding device used at the Philadelphia mint in lieu of filing, for smoothing the edges of silver coinage ingots, as finally adopted consists of a well housed pair of special alundum wheels on the ends of the same mandrel, mounted on a bench. The work is done better, much faster, and less laboriously, and without scattering the silver more than does filing. The fine particles are separated from the coarse and fire-refined before being used again for coinage ingots, while coarse particles do not require preliminary treatment. NtLmber of employees The small demand for coin has made it possible to refrain from filling a number of positions which became vacant by reason of retire- ment, death, and resignation, with the result that the roster of mint service employees is shorter than for a long series of years. The number on the rolls June 30, 1931, was 012, which compares with 052 one year earlier, a reduction of 40. Walter Reed Medal The Congress of the United States, by act approved February 28, 1929, awarded gold medals of honor to Maj. Walter Reed and his associates, in recognition of the high public service rendered and dis- abilities contracted in the interest of humanity and science as volun- tary subjects for experimentation during yellow fever investigations in Cuba. The medal is illustrated on the opposite page. The design, by Thomas H. Jones, shows two figures, standing, the first representing medical science, garbed in the classic tunic, holding in her right hand the caduceus, and with her left arm in a gesture of protection of the soldier upon the right, who bears a lance and shield. At their feet in the background is a figure symbolizing pestilence defeated. Around the border, the inscription \"Conquest of yellow fever.\" Stock of Coin and Monetary Bullion in the United States On June 30, 1931, the estimated stock of domestic coin in the United States was $2,073,898,415, of which $1,098,433,090 was gold, $539,- 958,327 standard silver dollars, $308,019,305 subsidiary silver coin, and $120,887,033 minor coin. The stock of gold bullion in the mints, assay offices, and Federal reserve banks on the same date was valued at $3,257,487,409, an increase during the year of $218,927,208; the stock of silver bullion was 10,323,703.50 fine ounces, an increase of 5,194,140.43 fine ounces. Production of Gold and Silver Domestic gold production during the calendar 3rear 1930 was $47,247,000, as compared with $45,051,400 in 1929. The output has declined to about 47 per cent of that for the record year 1915, when the total was $101,035,700. 6 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE MINT Silver oi domestic production during 1930 totaled 50,748,127 ounces, valued at $19,538,029; this compares with 01,327,868 ounces valued at $32,0X7,754, for 1929, and with the record production of 1915, 74,961,075 fine ounces, valued at $37,397,300. Industrial Consumption of Gold and Silver Gold consumption in the industrial arts during the calendar year 1930 is estimated at $42,689,379, of which $15,177,739 was new material. Silver used in the arts is estimated at 36,343,207 fine ounces, of which 26,874,378 fine ounces was new material. As compared with the prior year, silver consumption was about 6,000,000 ounces less and gold consumption about $14,200,000 less. Import and Export of Domestic Gold Coin The net import of domestic gold coin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1931, according to statistics compiled by the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, was $213,742,550; during the prior fiscal year there was net import of $92,264,082. During the 17 fiscal years 1915-1931, since the opening of the World War, there has been a net export of $808,880,520. Since 1870 the net export of domestic gold coin has been $1,686,535,584, as per tabulation by fiscal years, which may be found in another section of this volume. Appropriations, Expenses, and Income Appropriations available for mint service during the fiscal year 1931 totaled $1,689,160, and reimbursements to appropriations for services rendered amounted to $58,344.04, making a total of $1,747,504.04. Expenses amounted to $1,558,584.65, of which $1,531,570.22 was chargeable to appropriations and $27,014.43 chargeable to income. The income realized bv the Treasury from the mint service aggre- gated $1,624,411.09, of \"which $1,138,698.29 was seigniorage. ' The seigniorage on subsidiarv silver coin was $128,337.64; on nickel coin, $285,977.38; and on bronze coin, $724,383.27.

The purpose is \"to secure a due conformity in the gold and silver coins to their respective standards of fineness and weight.\" The commission, which met at the Philadelphia Mint February 11 and 12, 1931, reported the following results of their examination of the 1930 coinage: Your committee on counting reports that the packages containing the pieces reserved in accordance with section 3539 of the Revised Statutes by the mints at Philadelphia and San Francisco for the trial of coins were delivered to us by the superintendent at Philadelphia, and upon comparison with the transcripts kept by the Director of the Mint were found to be correct. The packages were then opened, the coins contained therein counted and found to agree with the number called for in each package. The reserved coins were then delivered to the committees on assaying and weighing. In the reports of those committees will be found an account of the disposition of these coins. The committee on assaying has completed the test assays on individual coins and mass melts representing the different denominations coined by the mints at San Francisco and Philadelphia, no gold or silver having been coined during the year at the mint in Denver. No half eagles were made during the year, and the only gold coinage was executed at the mint in San Francisco. According to the following table, showing the extreme variations found on individual coins and mass melts tested under the supervision of the committee the 1930 coinage of the several mints has been found safely within the legal allow- ance prescribed by law, which is one one-thousandth fineness for gold and three one-thousandths for silver coins. Highest assays on gold coins: San Francisco 899. 9 Lowest assays on gold coins: San Francisco 899. 6 Highest assays on silver coins: Philadelphia 900. 2 San Francisco 901. 1 Lowest assavs on silver coins: Philadelphia 898. 6 San Francisco 898. 4 Mass melts: Gold— San Francisco 899. 7 Silver- Philadelphia. _ 899. 5 San Francisco 899. 1 The committee on weighing reports that in accordance with the rules adopted by the Assay Commission in 1930 the committee received from the committee on assaying the residues of the several parcels of reserved coins, and took there- from at random from the parcels of each mint such a number of coins of each of the denominations represented and so distributed by dates of coinage as to be sufficient for the purposes of weighing. It was found possible to select one or more coins from substantially every one of the 103 parcels presented. The above procedure resulted in the selection of 295 pieces. Each of these coins was weighed to an accuracy of 0.01 grain and the results recorded. The standards used were a set of sealed coin weights and a set of gram weights, delivered to the commission from the Bureau of Standards, Washington, D. C, under seal and accompanied bv certificates signed by the director of the bureau. The weighings were made by the method of substitution on the balance belonging to the Philadelphia Mint regularly employed for this purpose. 1 his balance was tested before the weighing of the coins was commenced and was found to be accurate and reliable and very well adapted for the work of the committee. The weight of each coin is given in the table below. An examination o these results will demonstrate that each coin was well within the deviation allowed by law. Also the average weights of the coins of the several denominations were very close to the standards similarly established.

PART II REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE MINT ON THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF GOLD AND SILVER IN THE UNITED STATES DURING THE CALENDAR YEAR 1931 REPORT ON PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF GOLD AND SILVER IN THE UNITED STATES DURING THE CALENDAR YEAR 1930 INTRODUCTION The official estimate of the production of gold and silver in the United States is made by the Bureau of the Mint with the cooperation of the Bureau of Mines, the latter making a mine canvass in each State and the former working backward from mint deposits through refineries, smelters, and other reduction works to the mine production estimate made by the former. The official estimate represents the material received at mint service offices and private refineries. The difference between this estimate and the mine production estimate is almost entirely due to the time element involved in the reducing processes, since differences for series of years are shown by comparison to practically offset each other. The two systems thus verify and support each other. The gold production of the United States, including its insular dependencies, for the calendar year 1930 is estimated to have been $47,247,600, and the production of silver is estimated at 50,748,127 fine ounces. A comparison of these figures with those for 1929 indi- cates $1,596,000 increase in production of gold and approximately 10,600,000 ounces decrease in silver production. As regards individual States, the outstanding differences in gold pro- duction as compared with the prior year are increases by South Da- kota of over $1,900,000, by California of over $800,000, by the Philip- pine Islands of about $700,000, and by Alaska of about $700,000; and decreases bv Arizona of nearly $1,300,000, and by Utah of about $600,000. Individual States' material differences in silver production as com- pared with the prior year include increase of over 400,000 ounces by Colorado, and decreases of over 4,000,000 ounces in Montana, nearly 3,000,000 ounces in Arizona, nearly 3,400,000 ounces in Utah, and about 600,000 ounces each in Nevada and Texas. A brief review of mining conditions, for which acknowledgments are made to the United States Bureau of Mines, follows; the produc- tion figures therein differ as explained above, from the Bureau of the Mint production estimates. Further information concerning same can be obtained by those interested by addressing the mines bureau at Washington. ALASKA Alaska mines in 1930 produced gold valued at $8,476,000 compared with an output of $7,761,000 in 1929. In 1930 about 43 per cent of the total gold production came from lode mines, compared with 47 per cent in 1929 and 51 per cent in 1928. The auriferous lode mines in 1930 produced gold valued at $3,639,- 000 compared with $3,644,000 in 1929. The value of the placer gold produced in Alaska in 1930 was $4,837,000, compared with an output of $4,117,000 in 1929. 27 28 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE MINT Twenty-seven gold dredges were operated in Alaska in 1930, three less than in 1929. The dredges in 1930 handled about 9,906,000 cubic yards of gravel and produced gold valued at $3,912,000, which was an increase of $980,000 over the output of thirty dredges in 1929. The total output of gold dredges in Alaska, including 1930, has been $42,920,600. The silver production of Alaska in 1930 was 408,570 ounces, valued at $157,300. The auriferous lode mines yielded bullion which contained 102,080 ounces of silver, the copper ores treated contained 279,990 ounces, and bullion from placer mines yielded 26,500 ounces of silver. In 1930 there was an increase in the output of gold and a decrease in that of silver. The decrease in silver was due to the low prices that prevailed for metals, which discouraged large outputs and the under- taking of new enterprises. The world-wide stagnation of business and the accompanying depression seemed to have been felt less in Alaska than in most places and the record of a decrease of less than 15 per cent in the value of the mineral output of Alaska compares favorably with similar enterprises in the States. Each year brings more general development of mineral resources in the Territory. ARIZONA Arizona produced gold in 1930 valued at $3,501,610, a decrease of $680,677 from that of 1929, according to C. N. Gerry, of the United States Bureau of Mines. The marked change was due to the large decrease in the output of copper ore, which supplies most of the gold in Arizona. The larger part of the gold, or $2,124,344, had its source in crude ore smelted, representing a decrease of $883,951 in gold from that source in 1929. Gold in bullion from ore treated by amalgamation was valued at $11,256 and that treated by cyanidation at $593,008, or a total of $604,264, which increased $462,104 over that of 1929; gold in concentrate was valued at $752,939, a decrease of $256,196. The gold from lode mines was derived from the following sources: Copper ore, $2,730,476; dry or siliceous ore, chiefly gold ore, $692,164; lead-zinc ore, $32,777; lead ore, $25,698; and copper-lead ore, $7,438. Gold from siliceous gold ore, chiefly from Mohave County, was more than double that of 1929, as a resuit of the unusually large increase in the output of gold ore from the Tom Reed mine at Oatman. More than 78 per cent of the State's gold came from copper ore and most of the remainder came from gold ore; placers produced $13,057 in gold, an increase of $7,405 over 1929. No dredges were operated. The largest producers of gold were the United Verde, Tom Reed, Calumet & Arizona, Copper Queen, New Cornelia, United Verde Extension, and Magma mines. The silver output amounted to 5,540,732 ounces, a decreaseof 2,002,- 551 ounces from the output of 1929. Most of the silver in Arizona is recovered from copper ore, and as there was a decided decrease in the output of copper ore in 1930 there was a corresponding decrease in the output of silver. The sources of the silver output were: Copper ore, 4,968,973 ounces; siliceous ore, 186,202 ounces; lead ore, 222,541 ounces; lead-zinc ore, 142,440 ounces; copper-lead ore, 20,491 ounces; and placers, 85 ounces. Most of the silver, or 3,927,374 ounces, was recovered from crude ore smelted, while most of the remainder, or 1,572,253 ounces, was recovered from concentrates smelted. The PRODUCTION OF GOLD AND SILVER IN THE U. S. 29 largest silver producers were the United Verde, Calumet & Arizona, Magma, Copper Queen, and United Verde Extension mines. There were 342 mines producing during the year, of which number 41 only were placer mines. CALIFORNIA Gold. — The total production of gold from California mines for the period 1848 to 1930, inclusive, is recorded as $1,841,540,225, of which $1,234,541,154 was from placer mines. In 1930 the lode mines of California produced $5,696,019 (an increase of $1,039,923), of which gold quartz yielded 60 per cent and the placers $3,755,143 (a de- crease of $115,464). Of the placer production, $3,451,801 was re- covered by dredging. The total dredge production from 1896 to the end of 1930 was $167,005,744, and the output from dredges in 1930 was slightly over 36 per cent of the gold production of the State in 1930, $9,451,142. The nine Sacramento County dredges made the largest output, $1,722,018, and increased their yield $240,424 over 1929. Six dredges in Yuba County made an output of $949,001 and decreased their yield $492,649 compared with 1929. One dredge in Amador County made an output of over $150,000 and three dredges in Trinity County made an output of more than $250,000. Dredges were also operated in Butte, Calaveras, Merced, Shasta, and Stanis- laus Counties. Three of the 34 counties reporting mine production of gold had a yield of more than $1,000,000 each in 1930. Of these Nevada County produced gold mainly from siliceous ore of the Grass Valley district; and Amador County, second in rank, is on the Mother Lode; Sacra- mento, third in rank, obtained most of its gold by dredging. The five mother lode counties — Amador, Calaveras, Eldorado, Mariposa, and Tuolumne — whose output is mainly gold milling ore, in 1930 produced $1,536,760 in gold from mill bullion and $358,299 from con- centrates derived from gold ore, compared with $1,428,313 in gold from mill bullion and $307,531 in gold from concentrates in 1929. Silver. — The total output of silver from California mines for the period 1848 to 1930, inclusive, is recorded as 84,536,750 fine ounces, valued at $70,889,636. Of the silver output in 1930, 1,622,803 fine ounces, siliceous ore yielded 823,000 ounces; copper ore, 471,212 ounces; lead ore, 116,779 ounces; copper-lead ore, 199,186 ounces; and placer bullion, 12,626 ounces. The only counties-producing more than 100,000 ounces in 1930 were San Bernardino, Plumas, Napa, Contra Costa, and Inyo. Over 58 per cent of the silver was recovered from ore sent to concentrating plants. CENTRAL STATES The total mine production of silver in the Central States in 1930 was 179,827 ounces, valued at $69,234, which was 26,306 ounces less than the output in 1929. All the silver from Michigan, 7,820 ounces, was derived from lode copper mines. None was reported from the refining of copper bullion, the output being composed entirely of lumps of native silver. The mine production of silver from Missouri decreased from 181,638 ounces in 1929 to 170,210 ounces in 1930. As no copper ore was shipped in 1930, all of the silver was derived from lead ore mined 78428—31 3 30 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE MINT in southeastern Missouri. Only 210 ounces was derived from copper- lead matte and only a small quantity from lead skimmings. The big source of silver from Missouri mines was from the residues of zinc concentrates derived from lead ore treated by the St. Joseph Lead ( \\>. The silver credited to Illinois in 1930 was from galena concentrates made at fluorspar mines in southern Illinois. These concentrates are treated mainly by the St. Louis Smelting & Refining Co. As the quantity of galena shipped decreased, the recovery of silver decreased from 3,700 ounces in 1929 to 1,797 ounces in 1930. COLORADO Colorado mines produced $4,516,000 in gold in 1930, as compared with $4,417,358 in 1929, according to Charles W. Henderson, of the United States Bureau of Mines. The siliceous sulphotelluride gold ores of the Cripple Creek district yielded in recovered amalgam and cyanidation bullion, $2,500,000 as compared with $2,640,000 in 1929. Other important gold-producing counties were San Juan, $658,000; Park, $494,000; Ouray, $148,000; Summit, $148,000 ; Eagle, $127,000; Gilpin, $127,000; Clear Creek, $106,000; and Lake, $79,000. The silver produced amounted to 4,290,000 ounces, as compared with 4,397,000 ounces in 1929. Eagle County produced 1,541,000 ounces and San Juan County 1,085,000 ounces. Other important silver-producing counties were: Lake, 617,000 ounces; Mineral, 405,000; Saguache, 328,000; San Miguel, 82,000; Dolores, 64,000; Pitkin, 56,000; and Clear Creek, 36,000. The total production of Colorado from 1858 to 1930 has been: Gold, $715, 477,609; silver, 657,839,654 ounces. EASTERN OR APPALACHIAN STATES The mine production of gold in the Eastern or Appalachian States increased from 1,779.86 fine ounces, valued at $36,793 in 1929, to 2,266.06 fine ounces, valued at $46,637 in 1920. Tennessee produced $14,388; Pennsylvania, $13,023; North Carolina, $14,582; Georgia, $4,194; and Alabama, $450. The placer mines (seven in number) yielded $1,686, of which $450 was from Alabama, $242 from Georgia, and $994 from North Carolina: None of the placer mines yielded more than $500. SUiceous gold ore in Georgia and North Carolina amounting to 900 tons yielded $6,740 in gold. The copper ore and copper concentrates from pyritiferous magnetite ore yielded $38,211 in gold, of which $10,800 was from North Carolina, $13,023 from Pennsylvania, and $14,388 from Tennessee. The gold recovered from base ores in 1930 was about seven times as much as that derived from placers and lode gold ore. None of the zinc or lead-zinc ores mined contained any recoverable gold. The mine output of silver was 123,590 ounces, or 11,930 ounces more than in 1929. Only 10 ounces was derived from placer bullion and 70 ounces from lode gold ore. Copper ores yielded 1 17,748 ounces, of which Tennessee was credited with 83,640 ounces, North Carolina with 30,000 ounces, and Vermont with 4,108 ounces. The silver from Pennsylvania (5,762 ounces) came from the pyritiferous magne- tite ore of the Cornwall mine in Lebanon County. PRODUCTION OF GOLD AND SILVER IN THE U. S. 31 IDAHO In 1930, according to C. N. Gerry, of the United States Bureau of Mines, Idaho's output of gold was valued at $443,309 and that of silver, $3,626,946. There was an increase of $24,764 in the product ion of gold and an increase of 6,236 ounces in the production of silver over thai of 1929; the value of the silver output, however, decreased $1,390,931 on account of the decline in the average price of the metal. ( iold increased from $418,545 in 1929 to $443,309 in 1930, as a result of the increased output of gold from the Talache (Gold Hill & Iowa) mine at Quartzburg, the large output of gold from the Sherman Howe property, a new producer near Burgdorf, and the increased output of gold from the dredge at Centerville, Boise Count}'. The output of gold from the Idawa property at Placerville was much less than that in 1929 and the mine dropped to second place among Idaho gold pro- ducers. Of the total gold output ($443,309) the placer gold amounted to $82,428, against $85,373 in 1929; the gold won by three dredges was valued at $68,527, an increase from $60,143 in 1929. The Idaho Gold Dredging Corporation at Centerville, the largest producer of gold in Idaho from dredging operations, increased its output 34 per cent. Dry or siliceous ore, chiefly gold ore, produced more gold than any other kind of ore, or $294,424; gold in lead-zinc ore was valued at $27,508; lead ore, $22,197; and copper ore, $16,752. In 1930 more than 66 per cent of Idaho's gold came from siliceous gold ore. The largest producers of gold were the Talache (Gold Hill & Iowa) mine at Quartzburg, the Idawa Gold Mining Co. at Placerville, the Sherman Howe mine at Burgdorf, the Idaho Gold Dredging Corporation at Centerville, the Lost Pilgrim & Hall-Interstate group east of Cascade, and the Mackay Metals (Inc.) at Mackay. The silver output was 9,420,639 ounces, an increase of 6,236 ounces. In 1930 Idaho not only became the second largest producer of silver in the United States, but increased its output in a year when the out- put from other Western States was distinctly decreased. The Sun- shine Mining Co. operated the Yankee Boy mine east of Kellogg in Shoshone County, increased its output of silver considerably, and became the largest producer of silver in Idaho. Lead ore supplied 4,462,368 ounces; copper-lead ore, 2,635,993 ounces; lead-zinc ore, 2,258,124 ounces; siliceous ore, 35,737 ounces; copper ore, 26,262 ounces; zinc ore, 800 ounces; and placers, 1,355 ounces. The Coeur d'Alene region (Shoshone County) alone produced 8,831,461 ounces of silver, an increase of 54,735 ounces over that of 1929. The largest producers of silver were the Sunshine, Bunker Hill & Sullivan, Hecla, and Morning mines, all in the Coeur d'Alene region. There were 192 mines producing during the year, of which 61 were placer mines and 131 lode mines. MONTANA Montana's mine output of gold in 1930, according to C. N. Gerry of the United States Bureau of Mines, was valued at $899,001, a decrease of $232,948 from that of 1929, and less than the average annual output for the decade 1921 to 1930, which was $1,420,822. Of the total output, $884,102 came from lode mines and $14,899 from placers. There was a decided decrease of $235,513 in gold 32 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE MINT from lode mines, due chiefly to the lessened output of the Anaconda group at Butte. A marked improvement of nearly 49 per cent in quantity was made, however, in the output of gold from the Spring Hill mine near Helena, and the mine became the largest producer of gold in Montana. No dredges were operated and the output of placer gold was $2,565 more than that of 1929. In recent years most of the gold was recovered from copper ore, but in 1930 the drop in the price of copper resulted in a decided decrease in the output of gold from copper ore, and the general decrease in metal prices, except gold, resulted in a substantial increase in the output of gold from siliceous ore. Copper ore was the source of $448,903 in gold; siliceous ore, nearly all gold ore, $366,974; lead-zinc ore, $44,529; lead ore, $16,301 ; zinc ore, $7,234; copper-lead ore, $161 ; and placers, $14,899. More than 79 per cent of the gold was produced by the Spring Hill mine south of Helena, the Anaconda group of mines at Butte, and the Liberty-Montana mine near Jefferson Island. The output of silver decreased decidedly, from 12,716,977 ounces in 1929 to 7,052,889 ounces in 1930, the smallest output except that of 1921 in the last 30 years. Nearly 75 per cent of the total silver was recovered from the mines at Butte. The output of silver from copper ore, the chief source of silver in Montana, decreased consider- ably from 7,289,007 ounces in 1929 to 4,583,827 ounces in 1930. There were also unusually large decreases in the output of silver from zinc ore, lead-zinc ore, and siliceous ore. Copper ore supplied the largest quantity of silver, 4,583,827 ounces; lead-zinc ore, 1,261,- 859 ounces; siliceous ore, chiefly silver ore, 657,439 ounces; zinc ore, 449,183 ounces; lead ore, 91,635 ounces; and copper-lead ore, 8,860 ounces. More than 82 per cent of the silver was produced from the Anaconda group of mines at Butte, the Block P property of the St. Joseph Lead Co. near Hughesville, the Flathead mine of the Ana- conda Copper Mining Co. near Kila, and the Butte & Superior prop- erty at Butte. There were 266 producing mines, of which 193 were lode mines and 73 placer properties. NEVADA The gold output of Nevada in 1930, according to Victor C. Heikes, of the United States Bureau of Mines, was valued at $3,081,436, a de- crease of $302,775 compared with $3,384,211 in 1929. The Robinson (Ely) district, credited with $1,041,668, exceeded all other districts in the State in gold output, chiefly on account of the production of copper ore from the mines at Ely, but decreased $279,972 in the value of the gold compared with 1929. The value of the gold output from the Jarbidge district in 1930 was $460,032, a decrease of $121,709 compared with 1929, followed bv the Tonopah district with $406,306 and the Goldfield district producing $297,732. The Seven Troughs, Round Mountain, Manhattan, and Comstoek districts produced $551,049 in gold compared with $286,042 in 1929, when the Seven Troughs had not vet started on a production basis. The largest producers of gold were the Nevada Consolidated Copper Co., Elkoro Mines Co., Tonopah Extension Mines (Inc.), Bradsnaw (Inc.), leasing the Gold- field Consolidated tailings clump, the Consolidated Coppermines, and the Seven Troughs Gold Mines Co. These six companies produced nearly 74 per cent of the total gold yield in Nevada in 1930. Siliceous PRODUCTION OF GOLD AND SILVER IN THE U. S. 33 ore in 1930 .yielded gold valued at $1,923,132; copper ore supplied gold valued at $1,035,327; lead ore, $21,456 copper-lead ore, $7,928; lead-zinc ore, $55,155; and placers, $38,438. ■ The mine production of silver in 1930 was 4,219,832 ounces, a de- crease of 703,694 ounces compared with 1929. The mines of the Tono- pah district in Nye and Esmeralda Counties produced 1,931,194 ounces, a decrease from 1,965,595 ounces in 1929. The output of silver from ore mined in the western part of the district in Esmeralda County in 1930 increased 793,540 ounces, but that mined in the eastern part of the district in Nye County decreased 827,941 ounces compared with 1929. The Comstock district, Storey County, decreased its output of sdver from 32,399 ounces in 1929 to 25,296 ounces in 1930. More than 58 per cent of the sdver yield of the State, 2,478,009 ounces, came from dry siliceous ore, the greater part of which (2,232,481 ounces) was recovered by cyanidation. Silver from lead ore amounted to 148,033 ounces; lead-zinc ore, 1,063,639 ounces; copper-lead ore, 258,792 ounces; copper ore, 270,512 ounces; and placers, 847 ounces. The largest silver producer was the Tonopah Extension Mines (Inc.), followed by the Treadwell Yukon Co. Next in rank were the Combined Metals, Bristol Silver, Tonopah Bel- mont, Tonopah Mining, and Elkoro Mines Co. There were 280 mines producing in Nevada in 1930, of which 33 were placer mines and 247 were lode mines. The total gold produc- tion of Nevada for the period 1904 to 1930, inclusive, is recorded as $212,292,913; of silver, 250,216,682 ounces. NEW MEXICO According to Charles W. Henderson, of the United States Bureau of Mines, gold produced in New Mexico in 1930 was approximately $652,000; silver was 1,091,000 ounces. Copper and lead -zinc ores yielded over 90 per cent of both the gold and silver production. Copper is the metal of chief value produced in New Mexico. In 1930 refined copper production had a gross calculated value of $8,406,000; refined zinc production was valued at $3,209,000; refined lead, $1,085,000. The Pecos mine, at Tererro, on Willow Creek, a tributary of the Pecos Kiver, continued as the largest producer of gold, of silver, of lead, and of zinc. Zinc-lead mines at Hanover contributed much silver but little gold. Zinc-lead mines, therefore, contributed about 50 per cent of the gold and 65 per cent of the silver. The siliceous gold-silver-copper ore of the Lordsburg district, Hidalgo County, and the copper concentrates of the Chino mines of the Nevada Cqnsoli- dated Copper Co., contributed about one-half of the State's gold pro- duction and about 25 per cent of the silver. OREGON The gold yield from ore and gravels treated in Oregon in 1930, according to Victor C. Heikes, of the United States Bureau of Mines, was valued at $297,702, of which 47 lode operations vielded $83,283 and 143 placer operations $214,419. Compared with the gold yield in 1929, this was a decrease of $55,621, or 16 per cent. Four dredges were m operation in 1930 in Baker, Grant, and Jackson Counties and yielded slightly over 58 per cent of the total gold output of the State 34 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE MINT In order of output the leading gold-producing counties were Jackson, Grant, Josephine, and Baker; these counties produced over 97 per cent of the total gold in 1930. Dry gold ore and tailings yielded 27 per cent; copper ore, 1 per cent; dredges, hydraulic mines, and surface placers, 71 per cent of the total gold output of Oregon in 1930. A small amount of gold ($2,065) came from drift placers. The production of silver in Oregon was 9,000 ounces, valued at $3,405, a decrease of 21,009 ounces in quantity and $12,530 in value compared with 1929. Lode mines yielded 7,421 ounces and placer mining 1,579 ounces. Gold ores yielded 67 per cent, placer mines 17 per cent, and copper ores 12 per cent of the total silver output of Oregon in 1930. No silver ore was treated for silver alone. SOUTH DAKOTA In 1930, according to Charles W. Henderson, of the United States Bureau of Mines, the Homestake gold mine, at Lead, S. Dak., mined 1,364,456 tons, and yielded gold-silver \"bullion, the proceeds of which were $8,426,195; the dividends paid were $2,009,280. The ore is first treated by amalgamation; sands and slimes are then treated by cyanidation. From 1875 to 1930 this mine has yielded gold-silver bullion and concentrates valued at $234,547,323 and paid in dividends $57,868,684. At the end of 1930 there were 14,981,911 tons of ore blocked out and remaining in the mine. Other production in 1930 was cyanide bullion produced in the 100-ton cyanidation mill at the Bullion-Columbia mine, at Keystone, between January 1 and Jan- uary 8, when a fire destroyed part of the mill; operations were not resumed during the remainder of the year. Banks and bullion buyers in South Dakota in 1930 bought placer bullion containing 47 ounces of gold and 3 ounces of silver. TEXAS Metal mines in Texas, according to Charles W. Henderson, United States Bureau of Mines, produced in 1930, in terms of recovered and recoverable metals, 389,239 ounces of silver and $3,648 in gold. Cya- nide precipitates and lead concentrates produced at the Presidio mine, at Shafter, contained only 365,439 fine ounces of silver and 176 ounces of gold, as compared to 974,049 fine ounces of silver and 1,279 ounces of gold in 1929. Because of the continued low price of silver in 1930, the Presidio mine closed June 30. The World Exploration Co., which in 1928 had reopened the Hazel mine, near Van Horn, placed its new 100-ton flotation mill in operation on May 1, 1930, and ran it at about one-third capacity until October 1, producing several hundred tons of copper-silver concentrates. Several hundred tons of copper-silver ore was shipped from Allamoore to the El Paso smelter. The total output of gold from Texas mines from the first year of available Government production records — 1885, to 1930, inclusive — mostly from the Presidio mime, has been $95,073, and for silver 22,772,112 ounces. UTAH The value of the metal output of Utah was $48,653,464 in 1930, a decrease of $47,331,737 from that of 1929, according to C. N. Gerry, of the United States Bureau of Mines. This unusual decline in value PRODUCTION OF GOLD AND SILVER IN THE U. S. 35 was duo chiefly to the large decrease in the output of copper ore, resulting from' the marked drop in the price of the metal. There were also large decreases in the output of lead-zinee ore and lead ore, hut the output of siliceous gold ore was more than double that of 1929. The gold output was valued at $4,309,148, a decrease of $660,767 from that of 1929, but it was much more than the average annual output for the decade 1921 to 1930, which was $3,530,647. Separated as to source, copper ore was most important, containing gold valued at $1,673,453; siliceous ore, chiefly gold ore, supplied $1,431,589 in gold; lead-zinc ore, $745,665; lead ore, $406,413; and copper-lead ore, $52,028; no placer gold was reported from Utah in 1930. One of the interesting features of the year was the large quantity of gold pro- duced from siliceous gold ore from the Eureka Standard mine in the Tintic district. Crude ore of smelting grade yielded $1,948,294 in gold, ore of concentrating grade yielded $2,287,344, and miscellaneous material, chiefly old tailings smelted, yielded $73,510. The five larg- est producers of gold were the Utah Copper, Eureka Standard, United States Smelting, Refining & Mining, North Lily, and Park Utah Consolidated companies. The silver production in Utah decreased decidedly from an output of 17,592,396 ounces in 1929 to 13,129,421 ounces in 1930. The State, however, maintained its position as the largest producer of silver in the United States. The output in 1930 was much less than the average annual output for the decade 1921 to 1930, which was 17,295,115 ounces. Separated as to source, the silver came princi- pally from lead-zinc ore, which supplied 6,479,433 ounces, and from lead ore, which supplied 3,362,487 ounces; dry or siliceous ore sup- plied 2,215,920 ounces; copper ore, 944,113 ounces; and copper-lead ore, 127,468 ounces. First-class crude ore yielded 4,671,750 ounces of silver, ore concentrated yielded 8,193,168 ounces, and miscella- neous material, nearly all old tailings smelted, yielded 264,503 ounces. The Tintic district, in Juab and Utah Counties, produced 4,834,829 ounces, against 6,272,456 ounces in 1929. The Bingham district of Salt Lake County produced 3,517,117 ounces, against 4,644,955 ounces in 1929, and the Park City region, in Summit and Wasatch Counties, 4,212,403 ounces, against 6,157,501 ounces in 1929. The five largest producers of silver were the Tintic Standard, Silver King Coalition, United States Smelting, Refining & Mining, Park Utah Consolidated, and Utah Copper companies. There were 103 lode mines producing in 1930; no placer production was reported. WASHINGTON The output of gold in Washington in 1930, according to C. N. Gerry, of the United States Bureau of Mines, had a value' of $87 748 an increase of $10,850 from that of 1929. Most of the gold of the State, or $81,719, came from siliceous gold ore; copper ore supplied $2,076 m gold; lead ore, $7; and placers, $3,946. Except for lessees' operations, the gold mines at Republic were idle, as they have been for two years. The output, however, of the Boundary Red Mountain mine in Whatcom County was about 30 per cent more than that in 1929. Crude ore supplied $10,148 in gold, ore treated by amalgama- tion $71 515, and concentrates $1,911. Since 1860 Washington has produced $30,422,745 in gold. The only mine in Washington that 36 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE MINT was worthy of note as a producer of gold in 1930 was the Boundary Red Mountain property in Whatcom County. The output of silver was 32,816 ounces, the smallest output in the last 30 years, due to the continued idleness of the large producers at Republic. Of the total silver, 27,592 ounces had its source in copper ore, 2,435 ounces in lead ore, 1,726 ounces in siliceous ore, 1,020 ounces in lead-zinc ore, and 43 ounces in placer dust and bullion. Crude ore supplied most of the silver, or 20,580 ounces; concentrates, 11,983 ounces; and ore treated by amalgamation, 173 ounces. The two largest producers of silver were the United Copper mine near Chewelah, Stevens County, and the Sunset mine near Index, Snoho- mish County. There were 24 lode mines and 14 placers producing in 1930. WYOMING Metal mines in Wyoming in 1930, according to Charles W. Henderson, of the United States Bureau of Mines, yielded 443 ounces of gold and 120 ounces of silver, chiefly from the Atlantic City district, Fremont County.
