        "text": "Discussion\n\nLLINs and IRS are the primary government-administered prevention methods used for malaria control in India. Considerable evidence has shown both of these interventions to be effective at reducing Plasmodium transmission and malaria disease [5–7, 15–17]. A systematic review and analysis of 11 years of NVBDCP malaria case data for Meghalaya reported a decrease in cases and malaria-related deaths, which is most likely due to changes in treatment and/or the state-wide distribution of LLINs in 2016. According to a state monthly malaria cases report during the year 2019, of the 869 fever cases tested for malaria only 3 were positive. Kessler et al. assessed the impact of mass LLIN distribution in the state of Meghalaya for the year 2015 (year preceding LLIN distribution), 2016 (year of LLIN distribution), and 2017 (year following LLIN distribution) in the seven malaria-affected districts of the state. That study reports dramatic reduction in malaria cases in four districts, namely West and East Garo Hills, Ri Bhoi, and Jaintia Hills in 2016, which is the same year that the first distribution of LLINs occurred. In West Khasi Hills, the decline in reported malaria occurred mainly in 2017. In South Garo Hills, there was no reduction in reported cases during the years examined [44]. An early study of ITN feasibility and acceptability in India occurred in Orissa state during 2003–2004, when IRS had been withdrawn and ITNs were being introduced by the NVBDCP [12]. That report is historically interesting, but of little relevance today, as it identified people's general unwillingness to purchase ITNs and to pay for their required retreatment, even though ITN use was high if community members perceived a health benefit. The present study revealed that, during a government-sponsored, free net distribution programme, LLINs had been widely distributed to populations at risk, with ownership increasing in HHs that did not own a treated bed net before the programme.\n\nVillage-level LLIN delivery generally functioned smoothly and covered ~ 99% of the study HHs. These findings are similar to another observational study conducted in Madhya Pradesh, India where the average coverage of LLINs following a government distribution was also ~ 99% [3]. A Randomized Control Trial in Odisha, India analysed whether micro-loans increased ownership and use of ITNs, and suggested that in the context of interest in using nets, high cost was an impediment to purchasing them. That study indicates people's interest in using ITNs, and the value of government programmes that facilitate easy access [18]. Studies in other nearby countries (e.g. Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Vietnam) have shown less success in distributing and encouraging use of LLINs unless information is tailored to the local culture [19–21], or the population is residentially stable [22–24].\n\nAlthough LLINs were reportedly used frequently at home, this was less often true when people stayed overnight in another village or agricultural fields, especially when people desire to use nets but they are unavailable [25]. Many other studies have shown that ITNs are regularly used in high transmission settings if they are widely available at no cost, and if people understand their value and proper deployment methods [25–27]. An early LLIN study (2003) in Odisha, India, which evaluated participant's willingness to purchase LLINs and their amount of use, more than three-quarters of respondents perceived benefits of using LLINs, and more than half expressed their willingness to buy them [28]. In our study, the vast majority (87%) of participants reported using LLINs while sleeping within their HHs, but only half said they took bed nets to their agricultural fields. Similarly, one-third of people in a Madhya Pradesh, India investigation reported carrying LLINs in 2017 when sleeping outside their homes, but that increased to three-quarters of respondents in 2020 following enhanced explanation of use and value [10]. Another 2009–2010 qualitative study in Odisha [29] reported that few participants reported using mosquito nets regularly, despite being aware of the benefits. Low ITN use reportedly varied according to season, cost, perceived toxicity and alternate net uses.\n\nThis study results suggest how improving education and government-provided services could make an improvement in more effective prevention and control. Other studies in Uganda, which investigated associations between overnight travel and risk behaviours in relation to Plasmodium infection, evaluated use of LLINs and other personal protection measures by travellers to prevent malaria [30, 31]. Those results suggest that even people with good knowledge of malaria risk make limited use of LLINs during travel, and travellers to locations that had not received IRS were more likely than non-travellers to have a malaria diagnosis [32]. Similar findings were reported among Cambodian youth sleeping away from their houses [24]. Furthermore, a recent investigation in Zambia [33] concluded that ITN use while traveling reduced Plasmodium infection risk by 35% over non-users. Other work in Namibia has shown that overnight cross-border travel increased malaria risk tenfold over domestic travel, with night-time outdoor agricultural work doubling the risk [34]. The reasons for not taking or using an ITN while away from home include social, logistical and psychological, with evidence from one study indicating \"social disapproval\" of disrespect or display of wealth [35]. This study, however, one main reason for not using LLINs during travel was not having extra bed nets to take from home. Education about the importance of carrying and using bed nets when away from home could reduce malaria risk to travellers and agricultural workers.\n\nIn the present study, village-level distribution of free LLINs occurred at one focal location (e.g., community hall, school), and was closely accompanied with educating community members on bed net use practices. This may have increased the acceptance and subsequent use of LLINs that was observed. Alternatively, in Zambia [36], it was shown that door-to-door delivery of LLINs ensured availability in hard-to-reach areas, and provided a good opportunity to educate the members face-to-face. Education and awareness activities during and after net distribution also have played a key role in increasing compliance of LLIN usage in other settings [37]. Investigations in nearby Myanmar [38–40], as well as Ethiopia [41] and Kenya [42], for example, show that perceptions of ITNs and their use depend on knowledge and beliefs about malaria risk, as well as appropriate, culturally sensitive education. The extensive MEDP programme in Madhya Pradesh has demonstrated the critical importance of \"context-specific IEC\" among other logistical and policy considerations [43].\n\nThe widespread acceptance and use of LLINs following the India nationwide campaign in 2016 may have been a principal reason for the sharp decline in malaria incidence in Meghalaya in general, and specifically at the sites of this study [2, 44, 45]. This decline in malaria has continued through 2021, and seems in part attributable to the widespread use of LLINs throughout the region. However, as malaria incidence decreases, and other factors lower people's perceived need for malaria protection, ITN use may decline [46–49]. In addition, as LLINs become damaged and loose insecticide potency, they become less effective [11, 50, 51]. Because the present study was cross-sectional, insights into whether villagers continued to use bed nets well after distribution cannot be made. For these reasons, the continued use and effectiveness of LLINs should be regularly monitored to avoid malaria resurgence in the future [52]. Another 2014 study in Odisha, India [53], which assessed the insecticidal efficacy, usage pattern, washing practices and physical integrity of PermaNet LLINs, identified the importance of maintaining LLIN programmes and continuing periodic distribution of new nets to replace those that have holes and have lost insecticide concentration [53]. Despite a recent decline in malaria incidence in this study area, many residents still continued to use LLINs at home, and to a lesser extent while away from home.\n\nIRS coverage, however, was observed to be generally incomplete and much less accepted by people in the study area. Of more than a thousand households visited by the NVBDCP spray team, less than 5% were fully sprayed, with an additional 14% being only partially sprayed. These findings are similar to a cross-sectional study done in the urban settings of the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya which reported IRS not being regarded as an effective measure and not accepted by most of the community members due to reasons such as poisoning food items, cause foul odour and stains on the walls [54]. Studies in Jharkhand shows IRS coverage which ranges from 30 to 50% and 67% had lost their faith in DDT spraying as it is ineffective [55, 56]. Indeed, about two-thirds of the HHs refused spraying, and nearly one-quarter were \"locked\" (no one responded) when approached by the spray team. Acceptance of IRS is often problematic, with advocacy campaigns being geared towards preparing communities for IRS, with the goal of achieving high initial coverage [57]. A few studies have reported IRS acceptance to be generally high, including an investigation in Tanzania [58] where about 95% of participants reported agreeing to receiving IRS, primarily because they recognized that mosquitoes transmitted the malaria parasite and the spray reduced mosquito abundance. Another qualitative study in Namibia that evaluated people's acceptance of case-reactive IRS of households [16], virtually all participants accepted the IRS, in part because they perceived the importance of malaria risk, would receive free healthcare with the IRS, and were educated by respectful study team members. Most studies, however, reported extensive reluctance and strong resistance to household IRS, including reports from Ghana [59], Iran [60], and Mozambique [61], for example. Major reasons commonly offered for not accepting spraying included that the insecticide stained walls, contaminated food, smelled badly, and caused headaches or difficulty breathing. Logistical challenges included difficulty in moving or protecting furniture and other belongings. Lack of information about the IRS programme, perceived low effectiveness of IRS, and a preference of ITNs over IRS was also cited. Notably, the selection and behaviour of spray operators as they interacted with household residents was also found to be a deterrent to acceptance.\n\nIn the present study, the preparation and application of the insecticide by spray operators appeared to be inconsistent and possibly inadequate. Mixing of the insecticide solution was often not done as recommended, suggesting need for retraining and supervision of the spray team. Interestingly, observations in the present study differ from those in Madhya Pradesh, India [62], where proper preparation of the spray solution occurred in 99% of observations. and proper mixing and filtering more than 80% of the time. Furthermore, in the present study, proper disposal of the unused IRS DDT solution in an appropriate waste pit was only seen 22.2% of the time. Indeed, disposal of DDT-solution in the open environment was common across all spray teams and in every village. Similar inappropriate insecticide handling and logistical challenges have been reported in other settings [63]. Unlike the study in Madhya Pradesh [62], it was reported that under supervision, after the completion of the spraying, the leftover solution was used again for spraying in nearly one-fifth of the cases and disposed of in a hole in the ground more than four-fifths of the time [62]. This suggests the need for regular retraining of IRS team members, with an emphasis on human safety and environmental protection [62, 64].\n\nBased on discussion with some HH members, villagers’ knowledge about indoor spraying in the present study varied considerably, but most recognized that it was intended to kill malaria vector mosquitoes or reduce their transmission efficiency. Nevertheless, education of HH residents about the effectiveness and safety of IRS might improve uptake. Increased acceptance of IRS has occurred in some settings following community-based programmes to inform residents about the value of IRS [60]. In addition, residents who are taught about IRS safety better understand how to avoid risks of insecticide exposure [65]. However, the primary reasons that people in the present study did not allow treatment of their houses were related to inconvenience of preparing the space, and undesirable stains and smell.\n\nCommunity education can be complemented with better training of sprayers to be sensitive to local conditions [62]. Local leaders also have a role to play in reassuring people of the safety of IRS [43]. Indeed, exposure risks to the sprayers themselves could be reduced with proper training, as one study in Ethiopia has shown that many workers perceived risk to be low and had limited knowledge of the occupational dangers they faced [66]. In addition, community members need to be educated about the values of IRS, as shown in a Ghana study that regarded education as the main strategy for managing spray refusals, thereby, facilitating the implementation of IRS [59]. Another recent study in Nigeria concluded that IRS acceptability depends on providing households with information on its effectiveness in reducing the cases, and the costs of malaria prevention [67]. As in those studies, Meghalaya IRS efforts would likely benefit by providing community members with information, education, and communications (IEC) by personnel knowledgeable about malaria prevention methods, and by involving community-based volunteers, chiefs, and opinion leaders in disseminating information at the community level that promotes IRS acceptance [59].\n\nA cluster-randomized controlled trial in Ethiopia that evaluated combined IRS and LLIN use and entomological outcomes reported that these two interventions lowered both density and human biting rate of malaria vectors [68]. Use of LLINs and IRS together to control the vectors responsible for outdoor transmission is a major challenge for elimination of residual foci. Human activities and behaviour, combined with outdoor-biting mosquitoes with flexible feeding preferences, are among the reasons why LLIN- and IRS-based vector control interventions may be ineffective [69]. Whether IRS provides value added when LLINs are being widely used is not known, and depends on the local context, including transmission intensity and insecticide resistance patterns [17]. A recent cluster-randomized trial in a highly endemic area of Mozambique suggested that despite high ITN access but emerging pyrethroid resistance, use of pirimiphos-methyl IRS provided significant additional malaria protection for children under five years of age [70]. On the other hand, a cluster-randomized trial in The Gambia, with moderate seasonal transmission, susceptible vectors, but high LLIN coverage, found no difference between study groups in vector density or clinical malaria [71]. Whether it is cost-effective to administer IRS in Meghalaya settings of moderate-to-low transmission, and high LLIN use should be evaluated, especially if people's acceptance is low.\n\nAmong the limitations of the present study is the cross-sectional nature of the observations. Unfortunately, no pre- and post-intervention observations in the same villages were made, restricting the inferences that can be made. It is possible that the spray team members changed their normal behaviour because they knew that they were being observed and questioned. HH members who responded to questions may have provided answers that they thought were being sought, or would not embarrass them.\n\nOn the other hand, the investigation obtained qualitative and quantitative data from many residents of a large number of villages. Results came from direct observations and participant interviews. While perhaps not representative of all of Meghalaya, insights into IRS and LLIN acceptance and use were developed that provide needed understanding for HH- and community-level malaria prevention policy. Economic and other contextual barriers such as IRS interference with Eri silkworm rearing are important factors to address at a local or sub-national level. This is a first of its kind study that did an evaluation of the Government’s malaria control programme by an independent research team through non-participant observation in northeast India."
