SIR: I have the honor to submit the following annual report, in accordance with the provisions of section 333 of the United States Revised Statutes, covering activities of the Currency Bureau, in the year ended October 31, 1928. This is the sixty-sixth report made to the Congress since the organization of the bureau. PENDING LEGISLATION TAXATION OF NATIONAL BANKS There are pending before the Banking Committees of Congress several bills to amend the present provisions of law relating to the taxation, by States, of national banking associations. These bills have for their purpose the removal of the safeguard, which has existed for 64 years, and which prohibits the States from taxing shares of national banks at rates higher than those imposed upon competing moneyed capital. The principle involved is so important, and the result, should one of these bills become law, would be so far reaching in its effect, to State banks as well as national banks, that I feel it my duty to call the matter to the attention of the Congress and recommend that none of these bills be enacted into law. National banks are instrumentalities of the Federal Government. As such they can not be taxed by the States except with the consent of the Government and then only to such extent as the Government permits. Recognizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy, Congress has rightly safeguarded Federal instrumentalities by limitations upon taxation. In the case of national banks the limitations are provided in section 5219 of the Revised Statutes, as amended. Section 5219 now permits: 1. Taxation of the shares, but not at a greater rate than is assessed upon competitive moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens (the original provision). 2. Taxation of the dividends as the personal income of the shareholder but not at a greater rate than is assessed upon net income from other moneyed capital (adopted in 1923). 3. Taxation of the bank upon its net income but at no higher rate than is assessed upon other financial corporations, nor higher than the highest rates assessed upon mercantile, manufacturing, and business corporations doing business within the State (adopted in 1923). 2 REPORT OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY 4. Taxation of the bank according to or measured by its net income, including the entire net income from all sources, with the same limitation upon the rate as in method No. 3 (adopted in 1926). The adoption of any one of the above methods excludes the other three, with an exception which permits a combination of method No. 2 with method No. 3 or No. 4, so as to permit the additional taxation of dividends received from national banks located within or without the State whenever like combined -taxation of domestic or foreign corporations and dividends received therefrom is imposed by any State. These safeguards as imposed by Congress have been violated by some States through tax laws which have been declared invalid by the Supreme Court of the United States. Tax authorities of some States have now asked Congress, through the medium of the several bills, to do away with the safeguards provided and to place in the hands of the States the right of taxation with its corresponding right to destroy by such taxation. Thus two of the bills—S. 1573 and H. R. 8727—would limit the taxation of national bank shares only by the taxation of capital employed in the business of banking. It is contended by the State tax authorities interested in the passage of such bills that since the States would not impose an undue burden of taxation on their own State banks that national banks would be amply protected. While the State tax authorities are undoubtedly sincere in their contention, the fact remains that under such bills the States would have the right to place an undue burden upon national banks and upon their own banks to such an extent as would make banking unprofitable or at least burdensome, which in the last analysis is the right to destroy a Federal instrumentality. National banks are still instrumentalities of the Government. While they are no longer the chief source of paper currency, they are the only compulsory and the most numerous members of the Federal reserve system and as such are essential, not only to the currency function but to an adequate supply of credit in other forms. To place the power in individual States to wreck a Federal instrumentality which is the foundation of the Federal reserve system is not only unwise but dangerous and fundamentally unsound. It must be remembered that under the provisions of these bills, State and national banks would be placed in a segregated class for taxation purposes. It must also be remembered that it is often difficult to reach the property of individuals for taxation purposes and that when the burden of taxation on moneyed capital employed upon individuals becomes too great, it can and usually does leave the State which imposes the heavy burden. On the other hand, the bank's property may be easily ascertained and reached. It can not leave the State and it must either pay the tax or cease to do business. Moreover the individual will look with favor upon a heavy burden of taxation on banks when the result is to lighten his taxes, thus giving to the legislature which enacts the tax law a strong temptation to impose the heavy burden on the banks. The safety of the Federal banking structure should not be left to the power of the legislatures to resist such a temptation. The bills S. 4486 and H. R. 14001 are similar in principle to S. 1573 and H. R. 8727 with the comparison of taxation of national bank shares with the taxation of business real estate and the limitation of the former by the latter. The same opposition applies to these bills, with the addition that such method would be almost impossible of REPORT OP THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY 3 application. The value of real estate is difficult to determine. It is always a matter of opinion, and opinions differ widely. The basis of assessment varies from county to pounty and almost from one city block to another. The proposal is impractical and even though practical it would give preferences to other moneyed capital and subject bank capital to adverse discrimination. It is not to the interest of agriculture or business that any of the pending bills should pass. If money invested in bank shares is taxed more heavily than other forms of property, less money will be so invested, and profits upon such shares will largely be withdrawn in dividends instead of being left subject to excessive taxation. Without any doubt discriminatory taxation, diminishing as it does the security behind deposits, has been a contributing cause of many of the bank failures of recent years. Not only would the proposed amendments be harmful, but they are unnecessary for the purposes for which they are sought. The States which tax all property, including bank shares, at uniform ad valorem rates, obviously need no change in section 5219 to carry on their present system. They are using method No. 1. The States whose constitutions give them power to tax various classes of property at different rates have the right to use the excise alternative of section 5219—that is, to impose taxes upon banks according to or measured by their net income—and this without amendment of State constitutions as they stand to-day. States that hereafter amend their constitutions to give their legislatures classification power will be in the same class. In providing for tax classification very few States have tied the hands of their legislatures respecting bank taxation. It is for them to take the steps necessary to keep their systems in harmony with existing statute, rather than that the law should be amended, as it would be by the passage of any of the bills nowT pending, to permit the classification of banks as tax targets without any practical limitation upon the burdens then to be imposed. In this connection the California Legislature has already passed an amendment to the constitution of the State providing for a different method of taxation and it has been adopted by the people of California. Massachusetts, New York, and Wisconsin have taken advantage of the amendments of 1923 and 1926, the first two by levying upon banks an excise tax measured by all their net income and Wisconsin by employing the same income tax that it levies on other corporations. What they have done, other States may do. Certainly the problem should be dealt with by the States themselves in enacting new tax laws rather than asking Congress to give up the protection that has existed for 64 years to the national-banking system, to the Federal reserve system, and to the State banking systems. LEGISLATION RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS TO NATIONAL BANK ACT Under the provisions of the national bank act, as amended, any number of natural persons, not less than five, may, for the purpose of forming a national banking association, enter into articles of association. It is further provided that upon making and filing articles of association and an organization certificate, the association becomes a 4 REPORT OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY body corporate, but shall transact no business except such as is incidental and necessarily preliminary to its organization, until it has been authorized by the Comptroller of the Currency to commence the business of banking. Since charters would not be granted in many cases the comptroller has followed the practice for many years of requiring, before any further steps were taken, the filing of an application by the proposed organizers. This application serves as a basis upon which the various examinations, etc., are made to determine the merits of the proposed organization. If this application be approved, then the articles of association and organization certificate, etc., are executed and filed. If the application be disapproved, the matter is dropped and no complicated situation arises as the result of paid-in capital, contracts for buildings, etc. Recently, however, several cases have arisen where the organizers have proceeded to have subscribers to the capital of the proposed bank pay in the amount of their subscription prior to securing the approval of the comptroller on the application and subsequently conditions warranted the disapproval of the application and no charter was issued. The result has been that the subscribers have in some instances had their paid-in subscriptions tied up by lawsuits, claims for attorney fees, etc. This is an injustice to the public and can easily result in fraud to such innocent subscribers. To correct this condition I recommend that Congress amend the present law by providing for the filing of an application under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Comptroller of the Currency and the approval by the comptroller in his discretion of such application before the filing of articles of association or organization certificate and that no money or subscriptions of capital may be paid in or collected by the organization until such approval is granted. In this connection, to make such a provision effective, I recommend a penal provision. I also desire to call your attention to the situation which exists in connection with the voluntary liquidation of national banks. Under the present law a bank may go into voluntary liquidation upon resolution of its board of directors and two-thirds vote of its shareholders. Adequate supervision of such liquidating banks is not, however, conferred by law upon the comptroller. It is frequently; the case that national banks dispose of their assets but do not go into voluntary liquidation, and there is no provision in law which would compel them to do so. I suggest, therefore, that section 5220 of the Revised Statutes be amended to provide that if any national bank shall have disposed of all its assets or closed its doors and shall refuse or neglect to formally place the association in voluntary liquidation within 30 days thereafter the comptroller shall have authority to send an examiner to the bank with instructions to call a special meeting of shareholders, upon due notice, for the purpose of adopting a resolution placing the association in voluntary liquidation, and that if the shareholders shall refuse to adopt such resolution the comptroller may appoint a receiver for the purpose of winding up its affairs, and that when any national banking association is placed in voluntary liquidation it shall continue to hold annual meetings of shareholders in the manner and on the date specified in the articles of association and to elect directors and appoint officers in the same manner as if it were in active operation until all assets are disposed of, all proceeds distributed to shareholders and final report submitted to the Comptroller of the Currency. The law REPORT OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY 5 should also provide that the directors shall have charge of the liquidation of the bank and that the president or cashier shall act as executive officer in liquidating the affairs of the bank under the direction of the board of directors and that every association placed in voluntary liquidation shall continue to be under the supervision of the Comptroller of the Currency until its affairs are finally closed, and shall be required to render such liquidating reports as the comptroller may require on forms furnished or prescribed by him. The liquidating association should be required to file with the Comptroller of the Currency a report covering the receipts and disbursements during the preceding year, and a copy of such report should be submitted to the stockholders at their annual meeting in January of each year. Upon the Comptroller of the Currency should be conferred authority to make an examination of any national bank in voluntary liquidation, the expense thereof to be paid by the liquidating bank. In the event of sale of the assets of a liquidating association to another bank, State or National, and the assumption of liabilities of the liquidating association, a contract should be entered into between the directors of the associations interested, and a copy of such contract, duly signed by the officers of the associations and acknowledged before a notary public or other officer authorized to administer oaths, filed with the Comptroller of the Currency. When the affairs of any liquidating national banking association are finally closed, the law should require the uncollected assets to be advertised for a period of 15 days in a local paper and sold to the highest bidder. All unclaimed dividends belonging to shareholders and unclaimed deposits should be transmitted to the Comptroller of the Currency for deposit, in such national bank or banks as he may designate, in trust, and the claimants entitled to such dividends or deposits should subsequently receive the same upon furnishing to the Comptroller of the Currency satisfactory proof of the validity of their claims. I make the further recommendation that there be enacted a law making it a criminal offense to maliciously or with intent to deceive, make, publish, or circulate any false report concerning any national bank or any other member of the Federal reserve system which imputes insolvency or unsound financial condition, or which may tend to cause a general withdrawal of deposits from such bank or may otherwise injure the business or good will of such bank. AMENDMENTS TO THE LAWS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA The laws of the District of Columbia relating to banks need revision. I am not prepared at this time to recommend a new banking code for the District of Columbia, but there are several amendments to the law which are necessary which I recommend be adopted by the Congress. At the present time there are in the District of Columbia savings banks or trust companies doing a banking business. Congress has placed the general supervision and the examination of these banks, which are not national banks, under the Comptroller of the Currency and such banks generally advertise that they are under Federal supervision. Congress, however, has not placed in the comptroller's hands the necessary authority to enforce corrective measures in connection with banking where such measures are needed. I recommend 6 REPORT OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY therefore, that a law be passed placing in the comptroller the right and power to make regulations governing these banks which are not national banks with a penal provision for the enforcement of such regulations, the regulations to be limited in that they shall not in any case place restrictions on such banks which are not placed upon national banks. No firm, copartnership, company, or corporation doing business in the District of Columbia, and not doing a banking or fiduciary business, under the supervision of the Comptroller of the Currency, should be allowed to use in their title the word \"bank\" or the words \"trust company.\" The use of such words without being under Federal supervision is misleading to the public. I recommend, therefore, that there be enacted a law prohibiting the use of such words unless such firm, copartnership, company, or corporation is doing a banking or fiduciary business under supervision of the Comptroller of the Currency, and even in that case the title should have the approval of the Comptroller of the Currency. Under the present provisions of the District Code, corporations doing a fiduciary business in the District of Columbia, having their principal place of business in the District of Columbia, must comply with certain provisions of the code, which is for the protection of those who do business with such corporations. Corporations, however, with their principal place of business outside of the District of Columbia may establish offices within the District of Columbia and do a fiduciary business without any specified restrictions or supervision under the code. I t would be very unwise and dangerous to let this condition continue and I recommend that the District Code be amended in this particular. I also recommend a revision of the present code with respect to building associations in the District of Columbia. OPERATION UNDER THE ACT OF FEBRUARY 25, 1927, COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE McFADDEN ACT AMENDING THE NATIONAL BANKING LAWS In the comptroller's annual report for the year ended October 31, 1927, the statement was made that the McFadden Act had fully justified itself as shown by the growth in increased resources. While this statement is still true when measured by a comparison of total resources of national banks in the amount of $25,136,426,000 at the time of the passage of the act and total resources $28,925,480,000 as of October 3,1928, the date of the last call^an increase of $3,789,054,000, it is obvious to this office that the banks in many cases still feel that the national system does not offer all the advantages that they can obtain under State charters. While I have no specific recommendations for legislation to make at this time to meet this situation, and thus strengthen the system, such legislation may be needed and in such event recommendations will be submitted. BRANCH BANKING In the comptroller's report for the year ended October 31, 1927, the statement was made that under the provisions of the act of February 25; 1927, the Comptroller of the Currency had approved the BEPOKT OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY 7 establishment of new city branches to the number of 127. During the past year ending October 31, 1928, the Comptroller of the Currency authorized the establishment of 103 new city branches. Of this total of 230 branches authorized by the comptroller 42 have been discontinued, leaving the total of city branches now in operation authorized by the comptroller under the provisions of the McFadden Act as 188. During the past year 8 branches were added to the system through conversion of 2 State banks and 62 branches were added through the consolidation of State banks with national banks. These additions together with those branches in the system under date of October 31, 1927, less 38 branches dropped through action of directors and shareholders or liquidation of national banks, makes the total number of branches in operation in the national system as of October 31, 1928, 992.

The amendment to the Federal reserve act in 1918 extending the number of fiduciary capacities in which national banks could act encouraged the development of this function, and the McFadden Act of February 25, 1927, giving these banks indeterminate charters and assurance that their corporate 10 REPORT OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY existence would not expire before the trust functions undertaken were fulfilled further stimulated the growth of this movement to furnish trust facilities to practically every community in the Nation. Fiduciary obligations may now be assumed no matter how long the period of service promises to be, and this change in the law has cleared the way for full trust service by thousands of national banks in all parts of the United States. Two thousand three hundred and seventy-three national banks had been authorized to exercise trust powers on October 3, 1928, representing 31 per cent of the total number of all national banks and 73 per cent of the total capitalization of the banks in the national banking system. This represents an increase of 41 per cent over the number authorized in 1921 to exercise trust powers, and an increase of 253 in the number holding fiduciary permits at the time of the passage of the McFadden Act in February, 1927. The number of national banks obtaining the right to exercise trust powers is now increasing at the rate of more than 200 banks a year. The need for intelligent fiduciary service exists in practically every community in the Nation. That the public recognize in national banks the advantages of naming as trustee, executor, administrator, and other fiduciary capacities the one unified banking system in the United States highly standardized in its practice and regularly supervised by the Federal Government, is evidenced by the increase in recent years in the number of trusts being administered by these institutions. In 1926 national banks were administering 26,053 trusts; in 1927 the number had grown to 45,583, and on October 3, 1928, the number of trusts for which these banks had been named to act reached the impressive total of 63,776. The assets of the individual trusts being administered have likewise shown remarkable growth. In 1921 individual trust assets aggregated only $826,000,000. This amount had increased to $2,080,000,000 in 1927, and on October 3, 1928, the total aggregated $3,297,310,119. A consolidated balance sheet of the individual trust assets of all the national bank trust departments as of October 3, 1928, is given below: ASSETS Investments Deposits in savings banks Deposits in other banks Deposits in own banks Other assets $2, 247, 145, 193 8, 690, 006 6, 456, 197 167, 953, 629 867, 065, 094 Total 3, 297, 310, 119 LIABILITIES Private trust accounts Private trust accounts, income Court trusts (executor, etc.) Court trusts (executor, etc.), income Other liabilities Total _. 1, 506, 335, 807 32, 938, 589 644, 371, 124 15, 735, 708 1, 097, 928, 891 3, 297, 310, 119 The volume of bond and note issues for which national banks have been named to act as trustees has likewise shown a growth in recent years. In 1921 national banks were acting as trustees for collateral trust and other note and bond issues aggregating $960,000,000; this BEPORT OF THE COMPTKOLLER OF THE CURRENCY 11 total had reached $2,463,000,000 in 1926, and 1927 showed an aggregate of $6,355,000,000, while on October 3, 1928, the volume of this activity was shown to be $7,978,388,854. As the operations of trust departments have grown, so have the earnings that national banks have reported from this source. Not only has the establishment of trust departments furnished a service to their communities highly desirable, but many national banks have found that their trust departments have been the means of bringing new business to other departments of the bank and enabled, the bank to retain balances upon the death of their customers which would otherwise be diverted to a competing fiduciary institution. For the fiscal 3^ear ended June 30, 1928, the earnings of national bank trust departments aggregated $16,165,000, as compared with $10,811,000 in 1927, $8,255,000 in 1926, $5,951,000 in 1925, and $5,059,000 in 1924. A recent analysis of the classes of trusts being administered showed that of the total number of banks handling trusts, 82 per cent were acting as trustees, 58 per cent were also acting as guardians of estates, 34 per cent as executors, 53 per cent as administrators, 12 per cent as registrars of stocks and bonds, 5 per cent as receivers, 3 per cent as assignees, 8 per cent as committees of estates of lunatics, and 26 per cent were also acting in other fiduciary capacities not mentioned above. The. system inaugurated sometime ago of compiling statistics relating to the growth of trust operations in national banks and the results made public periodically has created favorable comment. I t has focused the attention of the public and the banks alike on the possibilities of trust service in communities where national banks are in operation. That national banks with authority to exercise trust powers have awakened to the value of including the words \"trust company\" in their names is evidenced by the large number which have so amended their titles recently. Prior to 1927 only 101 national banks had included the word \"trust\" in their titles. Since that time the number has grown to 236 and the movement in this direction is becoming general in many sections of the Nation.

This number was less by 125, or 1.6 per cent, than the number in existence at the close of the preceding year on October 31, 1927. In this connection it is of importance to note that while the number of associations has decreased, their aggregate resources have increased as of the date of the last call, October 3,1928, compared with aggregate resources on October 10, 1927, the nearest call to the date of my predecessor's last report, $1,711,656,000, or about 6.3 per cent. This office has during the past year continued to exercise its policy of extreme care in granting charters for national banks, based primarily on the needs of the community for additional banking facilities. During the current year only 39.6 per cent of the number of applications received for the establishment of new national banks was approved, as compared with 44 per cent the previous like period and 52 per cent the year prior thereto. In other words, despite the fact that the number of applications received remains about the same, the number approved by this office is constantly becoming fewer and in the current year a less number of applications was approved than has been approved any year during the past 11-year period. Up to and including October 31, 1928, there have been authorized to begin business 13,249 national banking associations, of which 4,378 were voluntarily closed to discontinue business or amalgamate with other banks, State or National, including those consolidated with other national banking associations under authority of the act of November 7, 1918. Exclusive of banks which failed but were subsequently restored to solvency, the loss to the system by banks liquidated through receiverships was 1,164, the number of these receiverships being a fraction less than 8.8 per cent of the total number of banks organized. In November, 1914, there were in existence 7,578 national banks with capital of $1,072,492,175. Since that date the net increase in the number of banks was 129 and an increase in capital of $547,096,940. The capital of the banks in existence on October 31, 1928, was $1,619,589,115. In this 14-year period 2,597 banks were chartered with capital of $316,435,300. During this period, however, 2,468 associations were closed voluntarily or otherwise. Applications to organize national banks and to convert State banks into national banking associations were received in the current year to the number of 260, with proposed capital stock of $57,410,000. Of the applications pending 103 were approved with proposed capital stock of $26,280,000, 108 rejected with proposed capital stock of $16,645,675, and 32 abandoned with proposed capital stock of $7,530,000. National banking associations to the number of 113, with capital of $26,160,000, were authorized to begin business, of which 6 were located in the New England States, 36 in the Eastern, 23 in the Southern, 24 in the Middle Western, 12 in the Western, and 12 in the Pacific States. The greatest activity as indicated by the number of banks organized was in the following States: New York, 16 banks; New Jersey, 6; Pennsylvania, 13; Illinois, 8; Texas, 8; Nebraska, 9; California, 7; Massachusetts, 4; Ohio, 4; and Wash EEP0BT OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY 13 ington, 4. In other States the number ranged from 1 to 3 banks. It further appears that of the total number of charters issued, 25, with authorized capital of $11,260,000 and resources aggregating approximately $244,386,345, were the result of conversions of State banks—4, with capital of $360,000, reorganizations of State or National banks, and 84, with capital of $14,540,000, primary organizations. Conversions of State banks into national associations brought into the system 8 branches. In the year in question 52 national banking associations were consolidated into 25 under authority of the act of November 7, 1918, the capital of the consolidated banks being $119,467,500. In some instances there were reductions in capital and in others increases, but the net result by reason of consolidations was an increase in capital stock of $15,192,500. ^ There have been 25 consolidations under the act of February 25, 1927, t:authorizing the consolidation of State banks with national balfts ^the agpegate capital of the consolidating State banks being $21,390,000. These banks also brought 62 branches into the national system and assets aggregating approximately $352,390,752. The voluntary liquidation of 156 associations represented a capital of $27,381,000, while the capital of the 61 insolvent banks was $4,135,000. The net result of the changes hereinbefore mentioned was a decrease for the year in the number of existing banks by 125 and an increase in authorized capital stock of $116,891,500. It appears that during the year 268 banks increased their capital in the aggregate sum of $131,552,500. Of this number 77 banks effected the increase by stock dividends, the amount of the increase in this manner being $16,809,000. Of the 156 banks reported in voluntary liquidation, 57, with capital of $5,546,000, were acquired by other national banks, and 99, with capital of $21,835,000, either entered the State banking system or quit business, NATIONAL BANK FAILURES In the Comptroller's report of a year ago he stated that the drift was toward a more normal condition in the number of failures of national banks. This prediction has been justified. The failures during the past year decreased 60 per cent from the previous year, there being only 54 failures of going banks as compared with 135 the previous year and one of these institutions was immediately restored to solvencj^. It was necessary, however, to appoint receivers for seven banks after their assets had been sold to other banks in order to collect stock assessments to complete the terms of the sale. These seven receiverships were not failures of going banks since their assets had been sold on terms requiring the assumption of their liabilities in full by the purchasers. Treating these seven banks as failures would bring the number, when added to the 54 actual failures, to 61, with a capitalization of $4,135,000, as compared with 135 failures during last year with a capitalization of $8,257,000. Conditions are not now perfect, but I do believe that we are arriving at a normal period in national bank failures. 14 REPORT OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY From the date of the first failure of a national bank in the year 1865 to October 31, 1928, 1,234 national banks were placed in charge of receivers. Of this number 70 were restored to solvency and permitted to resume business, leaving 1,164 to be administered by receivers. Of these so administered, 452 (15 less than reported at the close of 1927), are still in process of liquidation and 712 have been entirely liquidated and the trusts closed. The capital of the 1,234 insolvent national banks at the date of failure was $137,095,420. The capital of the 70 banks that were restored to solvency was $12,095,000. The capital of the 452 banks that are still in receiverships was $31,259,500, and the capital of the 712 banks that have been completely liquidated was $93,740,920. The book value of the assets of the 1,164 administered receiverships, including assets acquired after suspension, aggregated $781,028,163. Total collections by receivers to September 30, 1928^ from these assets, including offsets, amounted to $441,849,562. There were levied against shareholders, stock assessments aggregating $86,395,740, and, in addition to the amount collected from assets, there was collected on these stock assessments the sum of $41,405,350, giving a total collection of $483,254,912 from all sources, or 55.7 per cent of total assets and stock assessments. This sum was disbursed as follows: Dividends paid to creditors on claims proved aggregating $429,272,717 $250, 833, 108 Payments to secured and preferred creditors, including offsets allowed and payments for the protection of assets 184, 472, 850 Payment of receivers' salaries, legal and other expenses 30, 626, 874 Cash returned to shareholders 4, 163, 398 Cash balances with the comptroller and receivers 13, 158. 682 In addition to this record of distribution there were returned to shareholders, through their duly elected agents, assets of a book value of $16,169,098. The 452 national banks that were as of October 31, 1928, still in charge of receivers and in process of liquidation had assets, including assets acquired subsequent to their failure, aggregating $311,476,541. Receivers had collected from these assets, as shown by their last quarterly reports under date of September 30, 1928, including offsets, the sum of $159,806,222. The capital of these banks was $31,259,500 and there had been levied by the Comptroller of the Currency to September 30, 1928, stock assessments against the shareholders in the amount of $28,229,500. From such assessments there had been collected up to and including September 30, 1928, $13,322,465, making collections from all sources in the liquidation of these active receiverships a total of $173,128,687, or 50.9 per cent of such assets and stock assessments, which amount has been distributed as follows: Dividends paid to creditors on claims proved, aggregating $179,637,811 Payments to secured and preferred creditors, including offsets allowed and payments for the protection of assets Payment of receivers' salaries, legal and other expenses Cash returned to shareholders Cash balance with comptroller and receivers $70, 207, 075 79, 021, 490 10, 391, 440 350, 000 13, 158, 682 From the date of the first failure of a national bank in 1865 to the close of October 31, 1928, 782 receiverships were liquidated and the trusts closed^ Included in this number are the 70 banks restored to solvency (2 in 1928) and 74 that were liquidated during the year BEPOBT OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY 15 1928. These 712 banks had assets, including assets acquired subsequent to their failure, aggregating $469,551,622. Keceivers collected from these assets, including offsets, as shown by their final reports, the sum of $282,043,340. The capital of these 712 banks was $93,740,920 and there were levied against their stockholders by the Comptroller of the Currency stock assessments aggregating $58,166,240. From such stock assessments there was collected $28,082,885, making total collections from assets and stock assessments of $310,126,225, or 58.8 per cent of such assets and stock assessments, which amount was distributed as follows: Dividends paid to creditors on claims proved aggregating $249,634,906 $180, 626, 033 Payments to secured and preferred creditors, including offsets allowed, and payments for the protection of assets 105, 451, 360 Payment of receivers7 salaries, legal, and other expenses 20, 235, 434 Cash returned to shareholders 3, 813, 398 The average percentage of dividends paid on claims proved against the 782 receiverships that have been finally closed, not including the 70 restored to solvency, which paid creditors 100 per cent, was 72.36 per cent. If offsets, loans paid, and other disbursements were included in this calculation the disbursements to creditors would show an average of 80.57 per cent. Expenses incident to the administration of the 712 closed trusts such as receivers' salaries, legal, and other expenses, amounted to $20,235,434, or 3.83 per cent of the book value of the assets and stock assessments administered, or 6.52 per cent of collections from assets and stock assessments. The assessments against shareholders averaged 62.4 per cent of their holdings and the total collections from such assessments as were levied were 48.28 per cent of the amount assessed. The outstanding circulation of these closed receiverships was $35,206,185, secured by United States bonds on deposit with the Treasury of the United States of the par value of $37,772,610. During the year ending October 31, 1928, 76 receiverships were closed, including 2 banks restored to solvency. The total assets of 74 of these receiverships, including assets acquired subsequent to suspension, aggregated $30,420,624. The capital of these banks was $3,625,000 and the total assessment against shareholders levied by the Comptroller aggregated $3,205,000. From the assets the receivers collected, including offsets, $16,680,318, and from the stock assessments the receivers collected $1,433,529, making of all collections a total of $18,113,847, or 53.87 per cent of such assets and stock assessments, which sum was distributed as follows: Dividends paid to creditors on claims proved, aggregating $18,385,062 $7, 792, 770 Payments to secured and preferred creditors, including offsets allowed, and payments for the protection of assets 8, 884, 635 Payment of receivers' salaries, legal, and other expenses __.. 1, 433, 149 Cash returned to shareholders 3, 293 The average percentage of dividends paid on claims proved against he 76 receiverships that were finally closed in the year ending October 31, 1928, not including the 2 banks restored to solvency which paid creditors 100 per cent, was 42.38 per cent. If offsets, loans paid, and other disbursements were included in this calculation the payment to creditors would show an average of 61.16 per cent. Expenses7 incident to the administration of these 76 trusts, such as receivers 16 BEPOBT OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY salaries, legal, and other expenses, amounted to $1,433,149, or 4.26 per cent of the book value of the assets and stock assessments administered, or 7.91 per cent of collections from assets and stock assessments. The assessments against shareholders averaged 86.62 per cent of their holdings and the total collections from such assessments as were levied were 44.73 per cent of the amount assessed.
