Its appellation, “Nigeria,” derives from the Niger River, which delineates its southern perimeter.\n\nMany internet websites require correct postal codes when they are collecting physical addresses. One such activity is shopping online. A valid postal code is required to send your package to the correct address.\n\nThe Nigerian postal code is organized by the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST). Each place has its own special code made of 6 numbers. Unlike in other countries where postal codes can have letters, in Nigeria, they only use numbers, and every code has 6 of them, no matter where it is.\n\nAccording to NIPOST, Nigeria is divided into 9 regions that make up the code’s first digit. The second and third digits, combined with the first, are the dispatch district for outgoing sorting. The last three digits represent the delivery location determined by your local post office. A delivery location can be any of the following; a post office facility, a rural area, or an urban area.\n\nTo find your postcode, go ahead and make your search or click on the state and then Local Government Area (LGA) to reveal all the postal codes within that LGA; then browse through the tables to find out the postal or zip code of your exact district, ward, or location.\n\nfaq\n\nNigeri Postal Code faqs\n\nWhat is the postal code or zip code of Nigeria?\n\nNigeria does not have a single postal code, but streets, villages, towns, and cities in Nigeria are divided into postal areas with their\n\nrespective postal codes.\n\nRead more on what a postal code is HERE.\n\nIs 23401 The postal code for Nigeria?\n\n23401 is not a valid postal code for Nigeria.
