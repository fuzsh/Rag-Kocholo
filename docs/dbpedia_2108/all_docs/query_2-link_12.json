        "text": "What is Nigeria's postal code? It is a post office code indicating the correct destination for delivering mails, parcels and packages. Local and international logistics companies like DHL, GIG Logistics, Azex, etc., will request the postal code of the designated state in Nigeria when you need delivery services. A senior official at the Nigeria Postal Service (NIPOST) sheds light on the current landscape of the digital postcode system in Nigeria.\n\nPeople use postal codification and zip codes for deliveries and mail. Developed countries like the USA use zip codes, while most African countries use postal codes. However, Nigeria is among the countries using both codes.\n\nNigeria postal code for 36 states\n\nNigeria has six geopolitical zones, and each region has several states. During President Ibrahim Babangida's regime, the government created a convenient post office system for Nigeria.\n\nAs a result, people began sending and receiving mails, importing and exporting products overseas, and distributing items countrywide. Here is a list of postal codes for Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) codification to clear the confusion.\n\nSTATECODEAbia440001Adamawa640001Akwa Ibom520001Anambra420001Bauchi740001Bayelsa561001Benue 970001Borno600001Cross River 540001Delta320001Ebonyi840001Edo300001Ekiti360001Enugu400001Gombe760001Imo460001Jigawa720001Kaduna700001Kano800001Katsina820001\n\nSTATECODEKebbi860001Kogi260001Kwara240001Lagos100001Nasarawa962001Niger920001Ogun110001Ondo340001Osun230001Oyo200001Plateau930001Rivers500001Sokoto 840001Taraba660001Yobe320001Zamfara860001FCT900001\n\nOverview of Nigeria's digital postcode system\n\nIn a conversation with Legit.ng, an official at NIPOST shared insights on the milestones made and the general reception of implementing the digital postcode system in Nigeria. The source said:\n\nAfter the announcement of the digital postcode system in June 2023, sample data has been collated and analyzed, which will assist in reaching our end point in the project's second phase. Among our notable achievements, NIPOST has established collaboration with other government agencies regarding data sharing.\n\nThe general reception has been impressive, as members of the public are eager to roll out the digital postcode. NIPOST intends to conduct a public enlightenment campaign using the digital postcode system. The digital postcode system would allow online and offline use, catering to remote and underserved regions.\n\nAdditionally, the official highlighted plans to seamlessly integrate the NIPOST digital postcode system into the National Addressing System (NAS), with strategic initiatives underway to foster integration with both governmental services and private sector endeavors.\n\nChallenges in the implementation process\n\nDuring the pilot phase of the digital postcode system, several challenges arose, as outlined by the official:\n\nHostility from members of the pilot community: This challenge was addressed through proactive community entry advocacy aimed at increasing awareness of the significance of the digital postcode system.\n\nThreat of insecurity: To mitigate security risks, collaboration was established with the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC), a key partner in ensuring the safe implementation of the digital postcode system.\n\nFunding: The project is financed through a public-private partnership (PPP), with stakeholders playing a crucial role in supporting the implementation of the digital postcode system.\n\nWhat is a postal code?\n\nMeaning of a postal code: A postal code is a sequence of letters, digits, or both and sometimes includes spaces or punctuations. It is usually part of a postal address, thus helping post offices to send parcels and mails to the right destinations. Moreover, you can use a postal code for Nigeria to track your order.\n\nUSA’s delivery system uses a ZIP combination for the items shipped to and from overseas and inland. Its ZIP+4 code has five digits followed by a hyphen and four digits indicating a more specific location.\n\nIs 23401 a ZIP code in Nigeria?\n\n23401 is not the country's valid zip code for Nigeria. Instead, use the postal code of your Nigerian state when accessing delivery services.\n\nIs +234 Nigeria postal code?\n\n+234 is Nigeria's phone country code (the international dialing code). Therefore, do not use it when prompted to fill in Nigeria zip/postal codes on logistics services forms.\n\nWhat is Nigeria ZIP postal code?\n\nThe postal code of your state in Nigeria is the correct ZIP code. Use it when filling out forms requesting a ZIP code.\n\nWhat is the postal code of Nigeria?\n\nZIP, postcode, or postal code denote the same idea because their primary function is to help delivery companies send parcels to the correct destinations. Therefore, all logistics companies require you to provide these codes.\n\nNigeria postal codes comprise 6-digit numbers:\n\nThe first three stand for the regional set of numbers (district for the outgoing sorting);\n\nThe second three digits denote the delivery location (urban area or post office).\n\nFor example, Lagos State's postal code is 100001. Hence;\n\n100 – the first three digits represent the state;\n\n001 – the last three numbers denote the head department in each region.\n\nIf you want to send a parcel to a department in the area (not to the head office), use that department's code. Note that using the wrong number will cause delivery delays.\n\nWhat does it mean when a person says a “ZIP codification”?\n\nZ= zone;\n\nI = improvement;\n\nP = plan code.\n\nKnowing Nigeria postal codes for all 36 states is important. You might buy something online and need these codes to have it delivered to your state. Since it is impossible to memorize all the codes, bookmark this page for reference.\n\nREAD ALSO: International courier services in Nigeria\n\nLegit.ng also posted a list of international courier companies operating in Nigeria.
