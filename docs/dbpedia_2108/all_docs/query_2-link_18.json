For this purpose, there is a local distribution of postal code and therefore connected to a specific local area, however, the composition and functionality vary from one nation to another.\n\nTherefore, postal codes can include country, region, municipality, roads, military, etc.\n\nZIP Code:\n\nThe name Zip Code is an acronym for the Zone Improvement Plan, launched by the United States Postal Services (USPS) in 1963.\n\nThe Zip Code is widely used to identify the exact place where parcels, packages and letters should be delivered, by dividing the regions into simple groups of locations, which speeds up the mail delivery process as mail sorting becomes easier. These geographical groups may contain various addresses, businesses, geographic features, etc.\n\nPreviously, it was a five-digit number, changed to a 9-digit number, to better identify the location, where the mail should be delivered.\n\nDifferences Between Zip Code and Postal Code:\n\nThe differences between zip code and postal code are discussed in the following points:\n\nZip Code means a postal code, which is used in several countries with a postal address to specify a mailing address. On the other hand, the postal code indicates the code used in the postal address, which helps to filter emails for the purpose of delivering them to their destination.\n\nThe Zip Code was introduced by the United States Postal Services (USPS) in 1963, and in 1959 the postal code was introduced.\n\nThe Zip Code is widely used in the United States and the Philippines. In contrast, the Postal Code is used in some countries.\n\nThe Zip code aims to separate regions to facilitate mail filtering, identifying the area where the email is directed. In contrast, the Postal Code is used for the purpose of identifying and identifying a location, planning a route, and collecting personal information.\n\nThe zip code contains only numbers, and the postal code contains numbers or combinations of numbers and letters, and sometimes punctuation marks are also encoded with numbers and letters.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMany countries around the world use codes either postal code or zip code or any other similar code, by whatever name it is called, at the postal address. This often makes moving and delivery of mail easier, faster and more efficient, which not only saves the delivery time and efforts and prevents confusion, when two locations are known by the same name, city or town."
