You can add on more as your business grows.\n\nWe are highly concerned with privacy and security in our communication. In the past, we had no access to the web server itself and actually very little access in general. Now access is under our control. In addition, Zimbra’s system is highly-secured with its native 2FA that comes with additional WAF (SaaS).\n\n“Email security is important, so we decided to keep the mail internally and not rely on cloud services. Zimbra’s on-premise system allows us to keep our information within the company.”\n\nZimbra has been the preferred email collaboration system for AI Clinical Research SRL for the past seven years. The open-source software aligns with the organization’s business strategies . This enables the startup to maintain and enhance high data security and privacy standards."
