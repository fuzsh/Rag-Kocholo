        "text": "Yahoo leads the e-mail market with over 250 million users, many of whom, by extension, probably use its other productivity apps like Yahoo Calendar. This is why Yahoo's acquisition of online collaboration suite Zimbra last fall made sense, as the company was obviously looking to step up its game with a more robust software suite for its products. Now that Yahoo Zimbra Desktop is in a public beta, we've gone hands on to see how Yahoo's first foray into desktop PIM is coming along.\n\nAvailable for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, Yahoo Zimbra Desktop is built on Mozilla Prism, a Google-Gears-like product that allows web apps to run outside a browser window and even when offline. This means that you get the full, familiar Yahoo Mail UI and functionality bundled in a window and integrated better with various OS features, which we'll get to in a minute. This also means that various functions typically respond ever-so-slightly faster than they do on the web, but for a cost: Yahoo Zimbra Desktop's installer is 40MB (on Mac OS X). Once the app is installed, it takes up nearly 170MB of space. It may be a small price to pay for some folks to gain offline Yahoo PIM access, but it could also be a nuisance to byte-pinching hard drive conservationists who don't want to give up the space.\n\nOn a strange side note, we only tested the Mac OS X client, but we found it very odd that the installer wanted to place the application in a subdirectory of the user folder. While it is true that most applications can run from almost any directory on a Mac, this is bad practice and may throw off any users looking to customize their backup routines. It's also just plain weird to require an installer for an app like this.\n\nOnce installed, the setup process for Yahoo Zimbra Desktop (yes, we're getting tired of typing all that, so we'll just call it YZD) is pretty simple. While Zimbra is owned by Yahoo and this app is marketed as a Yahoo desktop product, though, it includes easy setup templates for Gmail, AOL, and garden-variety POP/IMAP accounts. We stuck with setting up our Yahoo account and a second IMAP to test Yahoo Zimbra Desktop's prowess with outside accounts.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of YZD for current Yahoo users is that it's the first time the company has adopted the concept of IMAP e-mail for external client access. While Yahoo offered push e-mail for Apple's iPhone launch last year, the company has allowed only POP mail access for years, and even then, only to \"Yahoo Mail Plus\" customers who pay $20 per year. In light of competitors who have always offered free POP access, and now with Gmail doing free (though not quite perfect) IMAP access, it's good to see Yahoo joining the 21st century in this regard. We're a little disappointed, though, that IMAP wasn't opened up to any e-mail client, even with a \"Plus\" account. At least for now, the only way to harness all the wonders of IMAP with one's Yahoo account is to use YZD.\n\nAs far as e-mail goes, YZD performed well in our tests. Accounts can be set to check messages at typical intervals, and offline access works as advertised. We have over 1,000 messages in our IMAP (non-Yahoo) inbox, and they were all accessible when testing offline.\n\nYZD fell a little flat, however, when it came to testing its other features with Yahoo's services. Yahoo Calendar events, tasks, and even contacts never synched for us. To be sure, this client may integrate better with a true Zimbra account for syncing all this information, but since we're testing beta 3 of Yahoo Zimbra Desktop, we expected more of a desktop experience that syncs with Yahoo's cloud since all these other features come along for the ride.\n\nComplaints aside, there is still a lot of nice polish for both Windows and Mac OS X users. YZD supports mail and appointment notifications via popup and sound alerts, and the Dock icon on Mac and system tray icon on Windows will display a total unread count for all inboxes. Windows users can minimize YZD to the system tray, and both Windows and Mac OS X users can opt to have mailto: links create new messages in YZD instead of a traditional e-mail client.\n\nFor users of Yahoo e-mail, Yahoo Zimbra Desktop is a slick way to bring Yahoo's rich UI out of the browser and bring one's e-mail offline with IMAP syncing. If you're hoping for an Outlook-killer, however, you may have to wait at least until the beta badge is replaced by a shiny \"1.0.\" We just hope Yahoo isn't taking any hints from Gmail's now-comical 4+ year beta cycle."
