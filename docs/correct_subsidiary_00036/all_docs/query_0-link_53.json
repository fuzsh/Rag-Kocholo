        "text": "Jumpcut Users\n\nAfter careful consideration, we will be officially closing the Jumpcut.com site on June 15, 2009. Therefore, we are no longer accepting new uploads. This was a difficult decision to make, but itâ€™s part of the ongoing prioritization efforts at Yahoo!\n\nWe have released a software utility that allows you to download the movies you created on Jumpcut to your computer. As well, you can now download your original assets. See the download page to get started.\n\nOnce you download your movies, you may choose to upload them to another site such as Flickr, which now allows video uploads. You can find out more here: http://flickr.com/explore/video\n\nThanks for your understanding and thanks for being a part of Jumpcut.\n\nThe Jumpcut Team\n\nThe failed Jumpcut buy isn't the only Yahoo buy to bust. In fact, looking at a long list of acquisitions Yahoo's made since its founding in 1994 -- -- ok, we found it on Wikipedia, so tread carefully -- we found three acquisitions we like in retrospect: fantasy sports site Sportasy, search marketing pioneer Overture and Flickr parent-company Ludicorp. It's too early to tell if Right Media will pay off for Yahoo.\n\nIf we're way off base here, please correct us in the comments or email nicholas@businessinsider.com.\n\nUpdate: A reader says Yahoo made some smart acquisitions during its early days:"
