The features of ZCS rival and in most cases surpass those of Microsoft Exchange, and did I mention that it runs on Macs?\n\nVMWare announced on Tuesday that they are acquiring Zimbra from Yahoo! Inc. The maker of the popular VMWare Fusion virtualization software for Mac OS X, VMWare has been moving in the direction of providing cloud solutions, and the acquisition of Zimbra fits those plans perfectly. \n\nAccording to Brian Byun, VP and General Manager of Cloud Services for VMware, \"Zimbra is a great example of the type of scalable 'cloud era' solutions that can span smaller, on-premise implementations to the cloud. It will be a building block in an expanding portfolio of solutions that can be offered as a virtual appliance or by a cloud service provider. We are excited to welcome the Zimbra team and community to the VMware family.\"\n\nThe press releases from both companies note that the free Open Source Edition of Zimbra Collaboration Suite will continue being developed in the future.",
