        "text": "Kent Goldman is a Principal at First Round Capital. Most recently, he was a member of the Corporate Development team at Yahoo, where he focused on M&A to support the company’s user-facing properties. In 2007, he led the company’s $350M acquisition of Zimbra. Earlier, Kent led business strategy efforts for Yahoo’s Front Page, Communications and Community products which included Yahoo.com, My Yahoo and Yahoo Mail.\n\nBefore joining Yahoo in 2004, Kent was an institutional investor focusing on early-stage consumer technology. Among the firm’s investments with which he worked most closely was Oddpost, one of the first web-based services to demonstrate the functionality of a desktop application. In 2004, Yahoo acquired the company. Oddpost’s technology now serves as the basis for the Yahoo Mail interface.\n\nPreviously, Kent was an early member of the Mergers & Acquisitions practice at Thomas Weisel Partners, where he executed transactions totaling more than $20 billion. He has also worked for Fidelity Investments in Boston and London. Kent is an avid skier and cyclist. When his knees permit, he also competes in triathlons. He is a devoted, lifelong fan of the Boston Red Sox and is a die-hard supporter of the New England Patriots. He is a graduate of Cornell University."
