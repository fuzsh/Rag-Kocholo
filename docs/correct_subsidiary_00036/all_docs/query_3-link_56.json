This is done using something called IMAP.\n\nNote that you must activate IMAP access to your account in Gmail, if you have not already done so. Google also has an option for what is calls less secure Apps, you must activate this before IMAP access will be made available. Firstly login to Gmail then use this link.\n\nProceed in Zimbra as follows:\n\nLog into PrivateRelay and then when in Zimbra choose Preferences at the top, and then Accounts on the left.\n\nClick Add external account and then continue to complete the information relating to your account.\n\nThe IMAP user name should be the same as your email address, eg. joebloggs@gmail.com.\n\nFor Gmail use imap.gmail.com as the server, change IMAP port to 993 and click Use encrypted connection.\n\nFor Outlook use imap-mail.outlook.com as the server, change IMAP port to 993 and click Use encrypted connection (SSL).\n\nThen click Save on the top left, and the new external account will be added.\n\nOnce your account has been setup go into Mail in ‘Zimbra’. You will then be able to access all your email by clicking on the new account which you have just created.\n\nSimply copy all the email you want to keep to your Zimbra account. Once you are happy you can delete the External account you created by choosing the Delete option from option 1.\n\nFeedback"
