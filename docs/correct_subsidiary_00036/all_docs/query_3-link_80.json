The problem is that anytime server looses internet connection, the account can not sync till you provide that password all over again. Really frustrating.\n\nI am using zimbra OSC 7\n\nRegards\n\nThanks for the swift replies and sorry for the ambiguity. When using the zimbra webmail client, a user can integrate a secondary mail account (mostly external such gmail, yahoo or any) into his zimbra mail box. He can do so by going to > Preferences > accounts > add external account. After filing the parameters including the remote account login credentials, zimbra server then starts pulling down external mails.\n\nThe issue I am having is that anytime there is internet connectivity timeout or I close the webmail interface and relogin, the external account seize to sync till I fill in the password again at the configuration session.\n\nI am looking for a way to make sure that external account is configured once and that zimbra can recall the password provided for the external account authentication.\n\nThanks"
