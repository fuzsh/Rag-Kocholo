The company announced that it has sold Zimbra, the self-described \"enterprise-class email, calendar, and collaboration solution\" provider, to privately held IT firm Telligent Systems. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nThe divestment is part of VMware's strategy to streamline its operations. In the press release announcing the news, the company said that it \"determined that the collaboration and communication features of Zimbra as a stand-alone product would be best delivered by a partner such as Telligent in order to continue enhancing the Zimbra technology platform and growing the business.\""
