Opportunity: 1. In the Internet search business industry, Yahoo is the second most leading worldwide internet brand. 2. Yahoo improved identification that customers use additional of their time online. 3. Another opportunity for Yahoo is in USA, $ 23 billion revenue from Internet advertisement remains them strong. 4.

And that is incredibly aggressive and characterize by quick transform, converging technologies and growing opposition. 5. Increasing strength of competitors: In internet ear, Google, Microsoft, Amazon.com, EBay, Monster.com, MySpace, Facebook, and YouTube are the more than Yahoo. We can see that Google 50% people at present. But Yahoo user men are 29%. 6. More Internet related businesses: At present all most work are complete by internet. As a result many internet related company are increasing which is a threat for yahoo. 7. Rapidly technology changes: For changing technology rapidly, it is difficult to be up to date all the time. And changing legislative, Man can not to use internet easily.\n\n8. 8 | P a g e 8. The search engine industry has low barrier entry, technical and regulatory makes it easier for new firms to enter the industry. External Factor Evaluation (EFE) Matrix: We know External Factor Evaluation Matrix allows summarize and evaluate a firm external opportunities and threats. Here we evaluate the Yahoo’s external opportunities and threats:- Key External Factors Weight Rating Weighted Score Opportunities: 1.

The search engine industry has low barrier entry, technical and regulatory makes it easier for new firms to enter the industry. 0.09 4 0.36 Total 1.00 3.29 Porter’s Five forces Model: We know Porter’s five forces model of competitive analysis is a widely used approach for developing strategies many industries. The Porter’s five forces discussed below: 1. Rivalry among competing firms: According to the case we found that Google has 72% of Internet traffic on the other hand Yahoo only possessed 17% followed by MSN at 6% and IACI at 4%. Another fact is that Google has 42% of search engine utilization compared to Yahoo which has 23.8%. Yahoo’s another vital competitors Microsoft has a strong desire to increase its internet presence. Their main competitors Google has expanded well beyond search related functions into areas such as e-mail (Gmail), mapping (Google Maps), web-based productivity applications (Google Apps), a finance offering (iGoogle), a mobile Internet software platform(Android) and browser software(Google Chrome). 2. Potential entry of new competitor: The search engine industry has low barrier entry, technical and regulatory makes it easier for new firms to enter the industry. By analyzing the case we found that there are 1.1 billion internet users around the world and also internet advertisement generates more revenue which is encouraged to new entries to enter in the industry. 3. Potential development of substitute products: The industry has more potential substitute products. From the case we know that there are top 25 Internet properties exist including Yahoo, Google and so on provides internet search engine services. 4. Bargaining power of Suppliers: Yahoo should pursue a backward integration strategy to gain control or ownerships of suppliers.\n\n10. 10 | P a g e 5. Bargaining power of Buyers: According to the case, there are more than 20 Internet properties existing in the industry which provide internet search engine services. So, customers have plenty of option, they can switch to competing brands or substitutes product. CPM (competitive profile matrix): We know CPM identifies a firm’s major competitors and its strength and weakness. For understanding the external environment and the competition in a particular industry, they use CPM. It finds out firm’s key competitors and then compares with firm’s critical success factors. Like advertising, product quality, market share etc. As it compares the strengths and weakness, firm should know which area they need to improve and which need to protect. In CPM rating refers to strength and weakness where, a) 4= major strength b) 3= minor strength c) 2= minor weakness d) 1= major weakness In this case we found Yahoo’s main competitor is Google. They have another competitors like MSN, AOL, Microsoft, ASK and other but bigger competitor is Google. Google is a top web property in all major global markets today. It is a big name in international market and most of the people choose Google then the other sites like Yahoo! Reason is Google provides very speedy results. Now we are going to make CPM between Yahoo and Google: Critical success factor Yahoo Google weight Rating Score Rating Score Advertisement 0.05 2 0.10 3 0.15 Online product and 0.10 3 0.30 4 0.40\n\n11. 11 | P a g e service Market share 0.20 2 0.40 4 0.80 Number of advertisement member 0.10 2 0.20 4 0.40 Earnings per share 0.15 2 0.30 3 0.45 Global leader and technology 0.25 2 0.50 4 1.00 Brand reputation 0.15 4 0.60 4 0.60 Total 1.00 2.40 3.80 The weight ranging from .0-1.0 means low impotence to high importance. And this number indicates how important the factor is. In CPM of Yahoo’s is the strongest in only “brand reputation” because it indicated by rating 4 where Google is strong in “online product service, Market shares, number of advertisement member, brand reputation and global technology” it also indicated by rating 4. Yahoo has so many minor weaknesses and that’s why they got 2 ratings. Still they have no major weakness. But in overall analysis Google is stronger than Yahoo because Google’s total weighted score is 3.8 where Yahoo got 2.4 score. Financial Analysis: Yahoo’s revenue was $23.4 billion in 2008 which is record and exceeded 2007’s performance. The company’s former record was $21.2 billion that means revenue increased 10.6% in 2008. But because of their overall advertising spending the net income is decreased. Here, by analyzing various ratios we are analyzing the company’s financial performance.\n\n12. 12 | P a g e Liquidity Ratios: Liquidity ratios measure a firm’s ability to meet maturing short-time obligations. It is one of the vital ratios to know the organization's position. 1. Current Ratio: Current assets / Current liabilities. Current Ratio (2006) = $ 3,750,142 / $ 1,473,994 = 2.54 times Current Ratio (2007) = $ 3,237,722 / $ 2,300,448 = 1.41 times Current Ratio (2008) =$ 4,745,498 / $ 1,705,015 = 2.78 times Interpretation: We know, current ratio measures the company’s ability to pay off its current liabilities. Here we can see that Yahoo’s current ratio is above 1 that means by these current assets they can meet current liabilities. 5.54 1.41 2.78 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2006 2007 2008 Current Ratio Current Ratio\n\n13. 13 | P a g e 2. Quick Ratio: (Current assets-Inventory) or (Cash and equivalents + Marketable securities + Account receivables) / Current liabilities Quick Ratio (2006) = $ (3,750,142 –217,779) / $ 1,473,994 = 2.40 times Quick Ratio (2007) = $ (3,237,722- 180,716) / $ 2,300,448 = 1.33 times Quick Ratio (2008) = $ (4,745,498 – 233,061) / $ 1,705,015 = 2.67 times Interpretation: Quick ratio measures which a firm can meet its short-term liabilities without relying upon the sale or revenue of its inventory. In 2006 the Yahoo’s quick ratio was 2.4 times and in 2007 it’s goes down. But in 2008 quick ratio again increase and all three years their quick ratio was above 1.5 which is good enough expect 2007. 2.4 1.33 2.67 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 2006 2007 2008 Quick Ratio Quick Ratio\n\n14. 14 | P a g e Leverage Ratios: We know, Leverage ratios measure the extent to which a firm has been financed by debt. 1. Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio: Total Debt / Total Assets Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio (2006) = $2,352,998 / $11,513,608 = 20.44% Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio (2007) = $ 2,696,910 / $ 12,229,741 = 22.05% Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio (2008) = $ 2,438,906 / $ 13,689,848 = 17.81% Interpretation: Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio represents the percentage of total funds that are provided by creditors. From the chart we can see that 17.81% funds collected from creditors out of total funds in 2008 which is less than the other two years 2006 and 2007. 20.44% 22.05% 17.81% 0.00% 5.00% 10.00% 15.00% 20.00% 25.00% 2006 2007 2008 Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio\n\n15. 15 | P a g e 2. Debt-to-Equity Ratio: Total debt / Total stockholders’ equity Debt-to-Equity Ratio (2006) = $2,352,998 / 9,160,610 = 25.68% Debt-to-Equity Ratio (2007) = $ 2,696,910 / 9,532,831 = 28.29% Debt-to-Equity Ratio (2008) = $ 2,438,906 / 13,689,848 = 17.81% Interpretation:Debt-to-Equity Ratio measures the percentage of total funds provided by creditors versus by owners. In 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively 25.68%, 28.29 and 17.81% funds collected from creditors comparing with owners or stockholders. Activity Ratios: 1. Total Assets Turnover: Sales / Total Assets Total Assets Turnover (2006) = 6,425,679 / 11,513,608 = 0.56 times Total Assets Turnover (2007) = 6,969,274 / 12,229,741 = 0.57 times Total Assets Turnover (2008) = 7,208,502 / 13,689,848 25.68% 28.29% 17.81% 0.00% 10.00% 20.00% 30.00% 2006 2007 2008 Debt-to-Equity Ratio Debt-to-Equity Ratio\n\n16. 16 | P a g e = 0.53 times Interpretation: We know, Total Assets Turnover measure whether a firm is generating a sufficient volume of business for the size of its assets investment. In 2006 their Total Assets Turnover was 0.56 times that means every 0.56 times they are generating revenue from assets investment. In 2007 the total assets turnover was increased but 2008 it fall down. Profitability Ratio: 1. Net Profit Margin: Net Income / Sales Net Profit Margin (2006) = $751,391 / $6,425,679 = 11.70% Net Profit Margin (2007) = 660,000 / 6,969,274 = 9.47% Net Profit Margin (2008) = $424,298 / $7,208,502 = 5.89% 0.56 0.57 0.53 0.5 0.52 0.54 0.56 0.58 2006 2007 2008 Total Assets Turnover Total Assets Turnover\n\n17. 17 | P a g e Interpretation: We know net profit margin shows how many percent revenues or sales they can convert to net income or profit. Here we can see that Yahoo in 2006 their net profit was 11.70% which is quite good but after that their profit margin goes down which is threated for them. In 2008 their profit margin only 5.89%. 2. Return on Total Assets: Net Income / Total Assets Return on Total Assets (2006) = $751,391 / $11,513,608 = 6.53% Return on Total Assets (2007) = $660,000 / $12,229,741 = 5.40% Return on Total Assets (2008) = $424,298 / $13,689,848 = 3.1% 11.70% 9.47% 5.89% 0.00% 5.00% 10.00% 15.00% 2006 2007 2008 Net Profit Margin Net Profit Margin 6.53% 5.40% 3.10% 0.00% 2.00% 4.00% 6.00% 8.00% 2006 2007 2008 Return on Total Assets Return on Total Assets\n\n18. 18 | P a g e Interpretation:As we know Return on Total Assets ratio measure how efficiently a company can manage its assets to produce profits. In 2006 ROA was 6.53% but after that it was decreased dramatically which is almost half in 2008 compare with 2006. That means Yahoo cannot manage its assets effectively to make profit. 3. Return on Stockholders’ Equity: Net Income/ Total stockholders’ equity Return on Stockholders’ Equity (2006) = 751,391 / 9,160,610 = 8.20% Return on Stockholders’ Equity (2007) = 660,000 / 9,532,831 = 6.92% Return on Stockholders’ Equity (2008) = 424,298 / 11,250,942 = 3.77% Interpretation:As we know Return on Equity measures a company’s profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. By analyzing Yahoo’s ROE we found that in 2006 their position was good enough but in 2008 it’s decreased huge. 8.20% 6.92% 3.77% 0.00% 2.00% 4.00% 6.00% 8.00% 10.00% 2006 2007 2008 Return on Stockholders’ Equity Return on Stockholders’ Equity\n\n19. 19 | P a g e 4. Earnings Per Share (EPS): Net income / Number of shares of common stock outstanding Earnings per Share (2006) = $ 0.52 Earnings per Share (2007) = $ 0.47 Earnings per Share (2008) = $ 0.29 Interpretation: From 2006 to 2008 the company’s net income is decreased very badly. That’s why their earning per share decrease every year. In 2006 it was $0.56 which is decreased it 2007 & 2008 both years. Total Observation: Yahoo passes very tough time in internet-search business industry. In 2008 the company’s all kinds of ratio trend is backward. In 2008 their net income is $424,298 which was $751,391 in 2006 that means within 2 years their net income decreased almost 50% which is serious threated for them. Revenues by groups of similar service: Yahoo makes good amount of revenues from owned and operate sites, affiliate sites, marketing service and fees. In 2006 they make $6.4 million and 2008 it increased which is $7.2 million. From marketing service they make more revenue which is 88% of its total group of similar service revenues. SWOT Matrix: We know the Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) Matrix is an important matching tool that helps managers develop four types of strategies those are- SO (Strengths-Opportunities), WO (Weaknesses-Opportunities), ST (Strengths-Threats), and WT (Weaknesses-Threats) strategies. Strengths 1. Yahoo has reputation among the search engine business and it is the second leading internet brand in the industry. 2. Yahoo offers various Weaknesses 1. According to the case, Net Income of Yahoo is decreased every year. 2. The net income is goes down because of Its overall advertising spend.\n\n20. 20 | P a g e services to users free of charge. 3.
