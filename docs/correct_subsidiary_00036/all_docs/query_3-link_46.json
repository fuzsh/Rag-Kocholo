        "text": "Zimbra is a full-featured messaging and collaboration solution that includes email, address book, calendaring, tasks, and Web document authoring.\n\nZimbra comes with a Modern Web App that is a new-age email application usable from virtually any device or screen size.\n\nIt is secure, flexible, and scalable to meet spikes in demand and comes with built-in rich user experience.\n\nYour account might not include all the features described in this guide. Check with your administrator to see which features are available.\n\nWhen you Sign In, you enter your username and password and select the version you want to use. You can select to use the default client, or change the client version.\n\nContact the Zimbra administrator for the login URL and credentials.\n\nFigure 1. Zimbra login page\n\nZimbra client has two versions — Modern and Classic. A Default option also appears in the version drop-down. After login, you can choose either Modern or Classic to be the default client.\n\nType the URL in a browser’s address bar.\n\nEnter your username in the Username field.\n\nEnter the password in the Password field.\n\nChoose Modern from the Version drop-down to experience the all new Zimbra email.\n\nCheck the box Stay signed in to avoid entering your password each time you launch Zimbra.\n\nClick Sign In to login.\n\nMust Change Password\n\nThe Must Change Password setting will have to be enabled by the Administrator.\n\nWhen the setting is enabled, it will allow user to set the new password when logging in Modern Web App.\n\nType the URL in a browser’s address bar.\n\nEnter your username in the Username field.\n\nEnter the password in the Password field.\n\nChoose Modern from the Version drop-down.\n\nClick Sign In. UI will be displayed to set a new password.\n\nEnter the Username and Password.\n\nEnter new password in New Password and Confirm Password fields.\n\nClick Sign In.\n\nYour new password is successfully set.\n\nTwo-factor Authentication (2FA) is a method of confirming your identity by utilizing an information like password and a second factor in the form of a code through Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) apps. Please visit the wiki for supported apps.\n\nIn Zimbra, administrators have the option to enable or enforce Two-factor authentication.\n\nWhen the Two-factor connection is only enabled, not enforced, you have the option to set it up from Settings → Accounts at your convenience. In such a case, you can log in with just your username and password.\n\nBelow section explains the case when administrator has enforced the two-factor authentication for your account.\n\n2FA Enforced\n\nIf the administrator has enforced two-factor authentication, you are required to set it up immediately after you log in for the first time. You cannot use the application until you set up 2FA on your account.\n\nLaunch Zimbra.\n\nLogin using an authorized username and password.\n\nSince the administrator has enforced two-factor authentication, you immediately reach a page to set up Two-factor Authentication.\n\nClick Begin setup.\n\nInstall an authentication app on your mobile device. Check supported apps.\n\nOnce installed, configure it on your smartphone.\n\nClick Next on the Zimbra screen to begin the process of adding this account to the authentication app.\n\nOn the authenticator app, enter the code generated on the Zimbra screen.\n\nClick Next.\n\nEnter the code generated by your authenticator app and click Verify to complete the two-factor authentication setup.\n\nThis section familiarizes you with Zimbra’s email interface.\n\nFigure 2.
