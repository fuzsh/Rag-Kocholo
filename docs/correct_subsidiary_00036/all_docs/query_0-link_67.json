Of course that would probably be only the paid products, not FOSS.\n\nI hadn’t heard about the Tomcat acquisition. Sounds like they have the beginnings of a nice assault.\n\nOnly you knew about it!\n\nEverybody in the audience was like: WTH, when did this happen?\n\nSpringSource was acquired months ago but Zimbra only 2 months ago.\n\nhumphrey, they’re developing that atm. When it’s ready I’m sure they’ll spend some ad money to make it known to the masses. They said they’re integrating everything…pretty interesting stuff will come from them in the future.\n\nhttp://blogs.vmware.com/console/2010/01/vmware-to-acquire-zimbra.html\n\nTomcat is free but 85% of the developers are from SpringSource…so… they secretly own Tomcat and can make things the way they want."
