        "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2011.\n\nRevenue excluding traffic acquisition costs (“revenue ex-TAC”) was $1,169 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, a 3 percent decrease from the fourth quarter of 2010. Income from operations increased 10 percent to $242 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $220 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.\n\nGAAP revenue was $1,324 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, a 13 percent decrease from the fourth quarter of 2010.\n\nRevenue ex-TAC was $4,381 million for the full year ended December 31, 2011, a 5 percent decrease from the same period of 2010. The year over year decrease was primarily due to the revenue share related to the Search Agreement with Microsoft. Income from operations increased 4 percent to $800 million for the full year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $773 million for the same period of 2010.\n\nGAAP revenue was $4,984 million for the full year ended December 31, 2011, a 21 percent decrease from the same period of 2010, primarily due to the required change in revenue presentation related to the Search Agreement and the associated revenue share with Microsoft.\n\nNet earnings per diluted share was $0.24 in both the fourth quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010.\n\nFinancials at a Glance\n\n“Yahoo! continued to make progress in the quarter with operating income increasing ten percent year over year,” said Scott Thompson, Yahoo! CEO. “In 2012 we will be aligning resources behind key areas of focus to enable us to move aggressively in market and grow our business, bringing innovative new products and experiences to both our users and advertisers.”\n\nBusiness Highlights\n\nYahoo! is home to 11 number one properties globally and ranks in the top three in 20 categories worldwide. (comScore, December 2011)\n\nYahoo! continued to modernize its technology platforms, with additional sites across the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific going live on the new global Yahoo! Publishing Platform, bringing the total more than 130.\n\nYahoo! acquired interclick, inc., which has built an industry-leading data valuation platform optimized to work with large data volumes across multiple providers and marketplaces.\n\nYahoo!, AOL and Microsoft announced agreements to allow ad networks operated by the three companies to offer each other's premium nonreserved online display inventory to their respective advertising customers.\n\nYahoo! launched its 2012 U.S. presidential election programming, beginning with exclusive ABC News and Yahoo! News \"Newsmaker\" interviews with Republican candidates.\n\nYahoo! launched Livestand, a personalized living magazine for iPad. Livestand weaves together content from leading third-party publishers and Yahoo!'s global media network to create a visually stunning and deeply personalized digital experience tailored to its users’ interests and passions.\n\nYahoo! introduced additional products for the iPad such as Yahoo! Mail and IntoNow, an app that makes watching TV more engaging, social and fun.\n\nYahoo!, in conjunction with Playtone and Reliance Entertainment, will be the exclusive online broadcast partner for Tom Hanks’ multi-dimensional animated series “Electric City”.\n\nSearch Alliance Impact\n\nYahoo!’s results for the fourth quarter of 2011 reflect $48 million in search operating cost reimbursements from Microsoft under the Search Agreement, which amount is equal to the search operating costs incurred by Yahoo! in the fourth quarter. Search operating cost reimbursements are expected to decline as Yahoo! fully transitions all markets to Microsoft’s search platform and, in the long term, the underlying expenses are not expected to be incurred under Yahoo!’s cost structure. Our business outlook for total expenses reflects these anticipated savings.\n\nAs previously reported, Microsoft has agreed to extend the RPS Guarantee in the U.S. and Canada through March 2013.\n\nFourth Quarter 2011 Revenue Highlights\n\nDisplay revenue ex-TAC was $546 million, a 4 percent decrease compared to $567 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.\n\nGAAP display revenue was $612 million, a 4 percent decrease compared to $635 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.\n\nSearch revenue ex-TAC was $376 million, a 3 percent decrease compared to $388 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.\n\nGAAP search revenue was $465 million, a 27 percent decrease compared to $640 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.\n\nCash Flow and Cash Balance\n\nCash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $431 million, a 7 percent increase compared to $403 million for the same period of 2010.\n\nFree cash flow was $327 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, a 111 percent increase compared to $155 million for the same period of 2010.\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable debt securities were $2,530 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $3,629 million at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $1,099 million. During the fourth quarter of 2011, Yahoo! repurchased 27 million shares for $416 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, Yahoo! repurchased 110 million shares for $1,619 million.\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nRevenue ex-TAC for the first quarter of 2012 is expected to be in the range of $1,025 million to $1,105 million. Based on the terms of the Search Agreement with Microsoft, Microsoft retains a revenue share of 12 percent of the net (after TAC) search revenue generated on Yahoo! Properties and Affiliate sites in transitioned markets. Yahoo! reports the net revenue it receives under the Search Agreement as revenue and no longer presents the associated TAC within cost of revenue. Accordingly, for transitioned markets Yahoo! reports GAAP revenue associated with the Search Agreement on a net (after TAC) basis rather than a gross basis. For markets that have not yet transitioned, revenue continues to be recorded on a gross basis, and TAC is recorded in cost of revenue. GAAP revenue for the first quarter of 2012 is expected to be in the range of $1,170 million to $1,260 million. Total expenses (cost of revenue plus total operating expenses) for the first quarter of 2012 is expected to be in the range of $1,065 million to $1,105 million. Total expenses less TAC for the first quarter of 2012 is expected to be in the range of $920 million to $950 million. Income from operations for the first quarter of 2012 is expected to be in the range of $105 million to $155 million.\n\nBusiness outlook for revenue ex-TAC is being provided to reflect the underlying dynamics of the business during the Microsoft transition and to facilitate comparisons to prior periods.\n\nConference Call\n\nYahoo! will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2011 results at 5 p.m. Eastern Time today. A live Webcast of the conference call, together with supplemental financial information, can be accessed through the Company's Investor Relations Website at http://investor.yahoo.com/results.cfm. In addition, an archive of the Webcast can be accessed through the same link. An audio replay of the call will be available for one week following the conference call by calling (888) 286-8010 or (617) 801-6888, reservation number: 89954272.\n\nNote Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release and its attachments include the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”): revenue ex-TAC; free cash flow; total expenses less TAC; non-GAAP net income; and non-GAAP net income per diluted share.

Inc. All other names are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of their respective owners.\n\nYahoo! Inc.\n\nNote to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income\n\nThis press release and its attachments include the non-GAAP financial measures of revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs (“revenue ex-TAC”), free cash flow, total expenses (GAAP cost of revenue plus GAAP total operating expenses) less TAC, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are reconciled to revenue, cash flow from operating activities, total expenses (GAAP cost of revenue plus GAAP total operating expenses), net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc., and net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc. common stockholders per share - diluted, which we believe are the most comparable GAAP measures. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. We describe limitations specific to each non-GAAP financial measure below. Management generally compensates for limitations in the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying on comparable GAAP financial measures and providing investors with a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure or measures. Further, management uses non-GAAP financial measures only in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business and operating costs. These non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, revenue, cash flow from operating activities, total expenses, net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc., and net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc. common stockholders per share - diluted calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nRevenue ex-TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP revenue less TAC. TAC consists of payments made to third-party entities that have integrated our advertising offerings into their Websites or other offerings (those Websites and other offerings, “Affiliate sites”) and payments made to companies that direct consumer and business traffic to Yahoo!’s online properties and services (“Yahoo! Properties”). Based on the terms of the Search Agreement with Microsoft, Microsoft retains a revenue share of 12 percent of the net (after TAC) search revenue generated on Yahoo! Properties and Affiliate sites in transitioned markets. Yahoo! reports the net revenue it receives under the Search Agreement as revenue and no longer presents the associated TAC within cost of revenue. Accordingly, for transitioned markets Yahoo! reports GAAP revenue associated with the Search Agreement on a net (after TAC) basis rather than a gross basis. For markets that have not yet transitioned, revenue continues to be recorded on a gross basis, and TAC is recorded in cost of revenue. We present revenue ex-TAC to provide investors a metric used by the Company for evaluation and decision-making purposes during the Microsoft transition and to provide investors with comparable revenue numbers when comparing periods preceding, during and following the transition period. We present revenue ex-TAC business outlook to reflect the underlying dynamics of the business during the Microsoft transition and to facilitate comparisons to prior periods. A limitation of revenue ex-TAC is that it is a measure which we have defined for internal and investor purposes that may be unique to the Company, and therefore it may not enhance the comparability of our results to other companies in our industry who have similar business arrangements but address the impact of TAC differently. Management compensates for these limitations by also relying on the comparable GAAP financial measures of revenue and cost of revenue, which includes TAC in non-transitioned markets.\n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash flow from operating activities (adjusted to include excess tax benefits from stock-based awards), less acquisition of property and equipment, net and dividends received from equity investees. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the acquisition of property and equipment, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet, and repurchasing stock. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Management compensates for this limitation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporates all cash movements during the period.\n\nTotal expenses less TAC is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as total expenses (GAAP cost of revenue plus GAAP total operating expenses) less TAC. We consider total expenses less TAC to be a useful indicator of our operating costs. We exclude TAC from this measure because TAC generally varies based on the revenue we earn from traffic supplied by certain third parties, and doing so assists investors in understanding the operating cost structure of our business. A limitation associated with the non-GAAP measure of total expenses less TAC is that it does not reflect TAC. Management compensates for this limitation by also relying on the comparable GAAP financial measures of cost of revenue and income from operations, each of which includes TAC.\n\nNon-GAAP net income is defined as net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc. excluding certain gains, losses, expenses, and their related tax effects that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing results. We consider non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be profitability measures which facilitate the forecasting of our results for future periods and allow for the comparison of our results to historical periods. A limitation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share is that they do not include all items that impact our net income and net income per diluted share for the period. Management compensates for this limitation by also relying on the comparable GAAP financial measures of net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc. and net income attributable to Yahoo! Inc. common stockholders per share - diluted, both of which include the gains, losses, expenses and related tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share."
