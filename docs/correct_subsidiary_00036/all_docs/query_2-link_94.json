We need to see the headers after it arrives at Yahoo or Hotmail.\n\nOne thing I do see is that your mail server thinks you are on a SORBS Blacklist. If you are, then Yahoo and Hotmail will most certainly tag your emails as spam...\n\nUpdate: You are on 5 blacklists according to: MXTOOLBOX. This is for sure the reason you are getting put in the junk folder at Yahoo and Hotmail."
