VMware said it is acquiring all of Zimbra’s intellectual property, while allowing Yahoo to continue using the company’s technology in its own e-mail and calendar applications.\n\nVMware provides virtualization technology, which helps companies save money on power and hardware by allowing one computer to function like several machines.\n\nIt said the Zimbra acquisition will help it build a portfolio of inexpensive applications to offer business customers.\n\nFinancial details were not disclosed. The companies expect to close the deal by the end of March."
