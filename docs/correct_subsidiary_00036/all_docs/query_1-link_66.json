Zimbra Desktop.\n\nBesides working offline, the free e-mail software offers extra functionality, such as online word processing, spreadsheets, task management, and file storage. You can use it to access your Gmail and AOL Mail accounts as well.\n\nUp until now, you had to pay $19.99 a year for a Yahoo Pro account in order to access your Yahoo! Mail via POP or IMAP on a desktop mail client software. Yahoo! Zimbra Desktop works on Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems.\n\n\"Zimbra is focused on creating communication and collaboration solutions that ease the pain points of traditional e-mail, and switching between multiple e-mail accounts is one of the communication headaches that users encounter on a daily basis,\" said Satish Dharmaraj, Zimbra's co-founder and a Yahoo vice president. \"With Yahoo's Zimbra Desktop, we have taken our world-class collaboration suite and made it available for everyone for use anywhere, anytime, with any email account.\"\n\nYahoo! acquired Zimbra for $350 Millions about a year ago."
