        "text": "The web office suite maker Zimbra has entered into a purchase agreement with Yahoo. The search and services giant will acquire Zimbra for $350 million.\n\nZimbra's killer app is its integrated e-mail client, contact manager and group calendar web application. It's primarily designed for use within organizations, so start-ups, schools and small companies have been rapid adopters. In a blog post announcing the acquisition, Yahoo's Brad Garlinghouse notes that employees at Digg, students at Georgia Tech folks at Mozilla.org (funny, thought they'd be using Thunderbird) all use Zimbra internally for communications and calendaring. UPDATE: Apparently, Mozilla does use Thunderbird on the desktop, but the employees use Zimbra primarily as a server. The web app gets use \"from time to time.\" (Thanks, John!)\n\nZimbra is one of the few strong independent players in online web apps for the office. This acquisition in particular is a big move for Yahoo, which is now obviously positioning itself to challenge Google in the web-based enterprise office applications space.\n\nGoogle's docs, spreadsheets, mail and chat applications already have a strong following, but web apps that run in the browser continue to play second fiddle to office software that runs on the desktop. However, the game is quickly changing. A recently issued memo from Microsoft shows the software giant is finally starting to seriously worry about losing its dominant position on the office desktop to web-based alternatives. Good timing, Yahoo.\n\nGoogle Is Piloting Face Recognition for Office Security\n\nPlus: A cloud company says notorious Russian hacker group APT29 attacked it, Chinese hackers use ransomware to hide their espionage campaigns, and a bank popular with startups discloses a cyberattack.\n\nSpotify, Stop Trying to Become a Social Media App\n\nThe music streaming service has added a comment function under podcasts. Who is it for, anyway?\n\nApple Hits a Major Roadblock as EU Targets App Store\n\nApple has been warned that its App Store is in breach of EU rules, and has backtracked on plans to roll out AI tech in Europe over regulatory concerns.\n\nThe Metaverse Was Supposed to Be Your New Office. You’re Still on Zoom\n\nTech founders painted a vision of employees clocking into virtual workplaces. But the adoption of VR at work has been slow.\n\nActivists Disrupt Amazon Conference Over $1.2 Billion Contract With Israel\n\nMembers of the activist group No Tech for Apartheid interrupted a senior Amazon executive's speech at a conference in Washington, DC, on Wednesday over the company's Project Nimbus cloud contract.\n\nWar Crime Prosecutions Enter a New Digital Age\n\nA custom platform developed by SITU Research aided the International Criminal Court’s prosecution in a war crimes trial for the first time. It could change how justice is enacted on an international scale.\n\nThe Future of Vaping After the Fall of Juul\n\nThis week, we talk to the hosts of the new podcast Backfired about how the e-cigarette industry got to where it is today and where it can go from here.\n\nAging Might Not Be Inevitable\n\nThere are biological underpinnings to aging—and so researchers are investigating cell manipulations, transfusions of young blood, and chemical compounds that can mimic low-calorie diets."
