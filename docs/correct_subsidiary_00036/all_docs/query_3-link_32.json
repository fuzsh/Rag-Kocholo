        "text": "Yahoo has finally given IMAP access to its webmail users, the catch is you'll need to download and install the Zimbra desktop mail client (available for Windows, Mac, and Linux).\n\nWhile paid Yahoo Mail accounts have long had POP access, free accounts have always been limited to web-only access. Gmail on the other hand, offers both POP and IMAP access for free. For the time being anyway, if you want offline access to Yahoo Mail, Zimbra Desktop, which Yahoo acquired last year, is the way to go.\n\nAs for why Yahoo has chosen to limit IMAP access to the Zimbra client, that's anyone's guess, but the good news is the latest version of Zimbra rocks.\n\nThe latest version of Zimbra, released to today, is still technically a beta, but I had no problems using the Mac client. In fact installation and setup was refreshing simple for a mail/calendar/contact manager (and it's worth noting that Zimbra isn't tied to Yahoo Mail, there's one-click options for Gmail, AOL and others).\n\nZimbra runs on Mozilla's Prism platform, so it's essentially a web-app in desktop clothing.\n\nThe Zimbra Blog has all the gory details on the new features in the latest release, but some standout items include new mail notifications in the system tray (Win), mailto: link handling and mail and appointment notifications built-in.\n\nInterestingly there's no way to sync calendars, contacts or any of your other Zimbra data with Yahoo, presumably that's something for a future release. For now though, if you've been wanting offline Yahoo Mail access without ponying up for a paid account, Zimbra is the way to go.\n\n[via Read/Write Web]\n\nSee Also:\n\nZimbra Office Suite Adds Offline Support\n\nYahoo Scoops Up Zimbra Office Suite\n\nYahoo Mail Adds Phishing Protection\n\nThe Best Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids\n\nThese WIRED-tested hearing aids are affordable, audiologist-approved alternatives to prescription devices.
