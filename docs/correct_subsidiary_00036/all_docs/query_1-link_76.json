        "text": "The universe of collaborative solutions for email is an important part of the various business tools existing today, the offer of services is varied, wide and very diverse, but in the following lines we will be Defining Zimbra and How It Works\n\nZimbra Collaboration, formerly known as the Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) prior to 2019, is a collaboration software suite that includes an email server and a web client.\n\nZimbra Is An Open Source Server And A Fast And Secure Client Software For Messaging And Collaboration. The Software Consists Of Client And Server Components, And A Desktop Client. Zimbra Also Provides Native Two-Way Synchronization To Many Mobile Devices. Synchronize mail, contacts, and calendar items with open source email clients like Evolution and also with proprietary clients like Microsoft Outlook.\n\nZimbra was developed by the company of the same name in 2003. The company is headquartered in San Mateo, California. This particular company was bought by Yahoo! in 2007 and later by VMWare in 2010. To date, Zimbra's web-based email, contacts, and calendar integration has attracted more than 90 million users and subscribers through the product called \"Zimbra Collaboration.\n\nThrough Zimbra, users can share documents and files online and offline, view common to-do lists, and chat with those within the network. The good thing about Zimbra is that a user can work from virtually anywhere and in the world, since the service is web-based. It can also easily sync with other email providers and services such as Microsoft Outlook and Thunderbird. But in addition to syncing with other email programs, it can also sync with mobile gadgets like iPhone and Android.\n\nZimbra Collaboration Server also makes it easy for administrators to set up and manage the network. This means lower network maintenance cost with greater configuration flexibility. Not to mention that the Zimbra platform offers strict security and comprehensive backup, migration and restore services. Another cost-effective feature is Zimbra's ability to integrate with existing email platforms. Thus, a company does not have to discard all the software and licenses of a certain email service provider just to take advantage of Zimbra's multi-functional collaboration.\n\nAnother great news for administrators is that Zimbra enables server and storage consolidation. This means that only one copy of a given email message is stored per server, rather than multiple copies per user or storage group. This configuration also means greater optimization of software and hardware resources.\n\nBut the best thing for most people is that Zimbra offers the same experience on all platforms and operating systems. Whether you use the Windows, Mac OS, or Linux operating system and have email service providers, Zimbra works perfectly, integrating the necessary features and specifications.\n\nSoftware license\n\nThe closed source Network edition variant is distributed under the Zimbra Network Edition EULA.\n\nAs of version 8.5, the Zimbra source code is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 (backend) and the Common Attribution Public License version 1\n\nPrevious versions were released under the Zimbra Public License (ZPL).
