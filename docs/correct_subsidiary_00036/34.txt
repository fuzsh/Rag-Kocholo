SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO), a leading global Internet company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Zimbra, Inc. (www.zimbra.com), a leader in next generation e-mail and collaboration software. Under the terms of the agreement, Yahoo! will acquire Zimbra for approximately $350 million.

"Our industry-leading communications products, including Yahoo! Mail, are critical to the future growth and success of Yahoo!," said Jerry Yang, chief executive officer, Yahoo! Inc. "Zimbra's tremendous talent and innovative technology will help to extend our core Mail offerings, further strengthening our strong leadership position in this space. Additionally, Zimbra's successful relationships with large ISPs are key as we expand our worldwide partner network and continue to focus on our commitment to being the partner of choice."
