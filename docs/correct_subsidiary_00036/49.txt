Yahoo has acquired online collaboration suite Zimbra for $350 million, the two companies announced this afternoon. Yahoo said that it hopes to expand its presence in universities, businesses, and through ISPs with the help of Zimbra's offerings.

"Zimbra's tremendous talent and innovative technology will help to extend our core Mail offerings, further strengthening our strong leadership position in this space," said Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang in a statement. "Additionally, Zimbraâ€™s successful relationships with large ISPs are key as we expand our worldwide partner network and continue to focus on our commitment to being the partner of choice."

Zimbra currently offers open source e-mail, calendaring, and contact management solutions that can be used both on- and offline, and services small businesses and educational institutions. The company also encourages users to create "Zimlets," which tie information from other web services into Zimbra's suite. The Zimlets essentially act as widgets that can be customized and placed around Zimbra's e-mail or calendar tools so that users can access information quickly and conveniently. The companies believe that Yahoo's broad reach with its advertising and content network, combined with Zimlets, will make for a nice pairing.
