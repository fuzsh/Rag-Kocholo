        "text": "age123 said:\n\nInteresting. I live in the Southern Hemisphere and I think I may of witnessed a type m super nova about 15 years ago. Has there been any reports of stars going missing around 1996-97. I have been thinking a lot about what I observed that year. And the only thing which seems to fit with what I observed is the current theory surrounding the events of a type m super nova! Other people have been helpful, but feel that I maybe witnessed a meteor shower or perhaps imagined it. Thankyou.\n\nWhat exactly did you see? A very naked-eye supernova that nobody else saw would be pretty much impossible 15 years ago.\n\nToday, so many astrophotographers are taking pictures that a supernova in any of the nearest few hundred galaxies would be noticed by several, independently.\n\nThe event I witnessed was very different to a star shinning really brightly. It envolved two stars, that were position very close together. One in particular was flickering dull then bright on and off for about 10 seconds. Then the other one appeared to shoot at the other one, about 4-5 times. Then the star that did all the shooting exploded along the trajectory of the particles that it fired off and engulfed the entire star. It's quite difficult to explain. What do you think it was? I looked up a type m supernova, and the way it is described sounds very similar to what I witnessed.\n\nglappkaeft said:\n\nWhile I agree with your other points this couldn't be more wrong. You don't even need a telescope to split double stars. For instance the naked eye is enough to split the two main components of the quadruple system Mizar and Alcor in the Big Dipper's handle. With a small telescope you can split thousands of double stars.\n\nI admit that I'm not up to date with recent astronomy, but last time I checked, at over one light year apart, Alkor and Mizar form a binary in the same sense(and with similar certainty) that Alpha and Proxima Centauri do.\n\nStill, we can use that example to show age123 why he coudn't possibly see a supernova acting like he saw.\n\nAlkor and Mizar are ~80ly away, and ~1ly apart. They are separated by a 4arcminutes angle on the sky. This is some 3 times under the limit of human eye resolution(1.2 arcmin).\n\nSo, at that distance, it is in principle possible to separate two stars orbiting each other at 1/3rd of a light year.\n\nThis in turn, is some 10000 times farther than the orbital radius of binary stars that undergo the Ia supernova event age123 is alluding to.\n\nEven if we imagined some mass transfer between the two stars at such a distance, it'd take a larger part of a year, not a few seconds. Otherwise the mass would have to travel faster than light.\n\nAdditionally, if a supernova exploded 80ly away from Earth, we'd all be dead, most likely.\n\nBut let's say the supernova is ~800ly away, at which distance we'd be pretty safe (although it would be close enough to have a good chance to outshine the Moon), and the binary elements are 6AU apart.\n\nThe angular separation between the binary components would now be 4arcmin/105 â‰ˆ 0.00024 arcsec\n\nor roughly thirty thousand times beyond human eye resolution capabilities.\n\nSeeing the binary components of a Ia supernova with a naked eye would be similarly impossible as seeing the fine structure of DNA.\n\nSo, if somebody told you that they saw something vaguelly like a double helix in their cup of coffee, you would be just as sure as we are that whatever it was, it wasn't DNA.\n\nglappkaeft said:\n\nWhile I agree with your other points this couldn't be more wrong.

With a small telescope you can split thousands of double stars.\n\nOk, I should have been more specific at \"binary stars\". There are systems which are gravitationally bound and can be resolved by the naked eye. But gravitationally bound is not the point. If stars are so close that they interact with each other in a significant way (with mass flow, tidal forces or similar effects), you cannot resolve that system with the naked eye.\n\nage123 said:\n\nThe event I witnessed was very different to a star shinning really brightly.

There haven't been any bright supernova since 1987.\n\n3. The extreme distance to stellar objects and the limited resolution of the eye makes it impossible to see any details anyways."
