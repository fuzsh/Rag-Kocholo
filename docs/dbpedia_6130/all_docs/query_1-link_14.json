        "text": "You've mis-remembered or mis-heard some things and got a bit confused. Let's try to fix that...\n\nSupermassive black holes\n\nWe have discovered that most galaxies have a supermassive black hole at their centre. So we suspect that galaxy formation itself usually involves a central black hole. Or one forms and gradually ends up migrating towards the centre if it didn't start there. Something, somehow, anyway.\n\nBut the black hole itself, huge though it may be, is not capable of single handedly creating a galaxy. It didn't start the galaxy off. It might be millions or even a few billions of times the size of our sun, but for example, our Milky Way galaxy has about 100-400 billion stars in it, spread far enough that the central black hole just isn't a big deal to most of it. Our entire central black hole could vanish with almost no change to the galaxy. You wouldn't even notice if you didn't go looking hard in that specific area.\n\nSo if you want to find what * really * started a galaxy growing, and keeps it together, its not black holes, or even a supermassive black hole, or anything at the center of the galaxy. You have to look elsewhere, far spread out in space, for the answer.......\n\nDark Matter\n\nWe can \"weigh\" our galaxy and others, by measuring how they turn (spin, rotate) in space. If you imagine swinging something on the end of a string, the faster you spin it the more force you need to use. In the same way, we can measure how strongly stars are pulling towards each other, by how fast they move and the galaxy \"spins\".\n\nCrucially, our galaxy is not at all like our solar system, where one huge central object (the Sun) mostly holds everything else in place.\n\nThe pulling is the galaxy as a whole, it doesn't mean its all some central object doing it. Everything in the galaxy pulls towards everything else, whether it's stars, gas clouds, black holes, planets, or anything else. Its that combined pull that holds it together and lets it stay together while it turns.\n\nThe problem is, when you do that calculation, you find that there just isnt enough stuff to hold the galaxy together and make it turn as we see it turning. In round numbers, the total mass of all the stars, gas clouds, planets and visible matter in our galaxy is about 50,000,000,000 times the mass of our sun.\n\nBut to rotate as it does, the total mass would actually have to be about twenty times as much as that.\n\nSomething's wrong. There's actually about 1,000,000,000,000 times the mass of the sun hiding in and around our galaxy that we can't even see. We can be pretty sure from theoretical workings, that its not huge numbers of tiny clouds, invisible stars, or made up of black holes. Its some new kind of matter that is \"dark\" (not able to be seen) to our usual instruments. Until we know what this new stuff is,we will call it \"Dark Matter\".\n\nWe can work out quite a lot about dark matter, not just how much of it there is, but what kinds of things it could be. The most likely candidate is a new type of subatomic particle that only weakly responds to gravity, and not at all to most other forces. Because it doesn't interact with other forces, we don't see it directly in our instruments. Because it interacts with gravity, it can shape our galaxy and lead to galaxy formation.\n\nHow galaxies formed\n\nWe now believe that this new \"dark matter\" actually led to galaxy formation in the first place, in the early universe.\n\nWhen matter pulls in on itself like in a star, it gets very hot, and the heat stops it collapsing easily. Like how our sun doesn't collapse. The catch is, to collapse a bit (or at all), it needs to react to gravity. To collapse a lot, it has to be able to get rid of all the heat (or other forms of energy) which that produces. Dark matter can't do that though, because it just doesn't interact in any ways that let it ditch much heat. So it kind of collapsed to vast thin clouds, and couldn't go further. But once those vast thin clouds formed, they attracted \"ordinary\" matter which could collapse further by losing heat (or other forms of energy), and that's how galaxies began.\n\nA central black hole often seems to also form, but fundamentally its the dark matter that started it all, long, long, before.\n\nSo your answers are like this.....\n\nSince I read that the black hole in the center of the galaxy has much less mass than the galaxy itself and that it is somehow held together by \"Dark matter\".\n\nThese are both correct. See above for details. Ask if any things unclear.\n\nso now I am wondering if it is possible that there exist galaxies where a star is at the center of it.\n\nIt wouldn't matter. A galaxy doesn't \"need\" to have a single object at or near its center. Most do, and its a black hole, but there doesn't have to be anything there as far as we know, and some don't. Even the biggest stars are tiny and microscopic compared to a galaxy.\n\nSo it would be completely unimportant if a star was at the center, for some galaxy or another, it wouldn't make any difference. A central object, however big, does not holds a galaxy together or makes it turn."
