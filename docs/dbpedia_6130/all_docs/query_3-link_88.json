Evening sessions will be held in order for students to use the telescope to make observations. Three hours lecture and three hours lab per week.\n\nCourse Learning Objectives\n\nWhen this course is completed, the student will have learned:\n\nUnderstand the various properties of our Sun by: Summarize the overall properties and internal structure of the Sun, describe the concept of luminosity and how it is measured, explain how studies of the solar surface tell of the Sun’s interior, discuss the nature and variability of the Sun’s magnetic field, describe various solar activity and their relationship to solar magnetism, outline the process by which the Sun produces energy, explain how observations of the Sun’s core changed understanding of fundamental physics\n\nUnderstand the various properties of Stars by: Explain how stellar distances are determined, Discuss the motion of the stars and how this motion is measured, distinguish between luminosity and apparent brightness and how they are both determined, explain how physical laws are used to estimate stellar sizes, describe how a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is constructed and used, explain how a stars spectroscopic properties are used to estimate distance, explain how mass of stars are measured and mass’s relationship to stellar properties\n\nUnderstand the properties of interstellar medium by: Summarize the composition and physical properties of interstellar medium, describe the characteristics of emission nebulae and their relationship to the life cycle of stars, discuss the properties of dark interstellar clouds, specify the radio techniques used to probe and determine the nature of inter stellar matter, discuss the nature and significance of interstellar molecules\n\nUnderstand the basics of star formation by: Summarize the sequence of events leading to the formation of a star like our Sun, explain how the formation of a star depends on it mass, describe some of the observational evidence supporting theory of star formation, explain the nature of interstellar shock waves and their role in star formation, explain why stars form in clusters and the differences between open and globular clusters.\n\nUnderstand the process of stellar evolution by: explain why stars evolve off the main sequence, outline the events that occur as Sun-like star evolves from the main sequence to giant branch, explain how the Sun will eventually come to fuse helium and describe what happens when that occurs, summarize the stages in the death of a typical low-mass star and describe the resulting remnant, contrast the evolutionary histories of high mass and low mass stars, discuss the observation that verify the theory of stellar evolution, explain the difference in evolution of stars in binary system for isolated stars.\n\nUnderstand the process stellar explosions: Explain how white dwarfs in binary-star system can become explosive, summarize the sequence of events leading to violent death of a massive star, describe the two types of supernovae and explain how they are produced, describe the observational evidence for the occurrence of supernovae in our Galaxy, explain the origin of elements heavier than helium and the significance of these elements for the study of stellar evolution, outline how the universe continually recycles matter through stars and interstellar medium\n\nUnderstand how neutron stars and black holes are formed and their properties by : Describe the properties of neutron stars and how they are formed, explain the nature and origin of pulsars and their characteristic radiation, list and explain some of the observable properties of neutron-star binary systems, discuss the basic characteristics of gamma-ray bursts and some theoretical attempts to explain them, describe how black holes are formed and discuss their effects on matter and radiation in the vicinity, describe Einstein theory of relativity and discuss how they relate to neutron stars and black holes, relate the phenomena that occurs near black holes to the warping of space, discuss the difficulties in observing black holes and explain some of the ways in which the presence of a black hole is determined\n\nUnderstand the properties and characteristics of the Milky Way Galaxy by: describe the overall structure of the Milky Way and specify how the various regions differ from one another, explain the importance of variable stars in determining the size and shape of our Galaxy, describe the orbital paths of stars in different regions of the Galaxy and explain how this motions are related to Galaxy formation, discuss some possible explanations for the existence of the spiral arms observed, explain what studies of Galactic rotation reveal about the size and mass of our Galaxy and discuss the possible nature of dark matter, describe some of the phenomena observed at the center of the Galaxy\n\nUnderstand the properties and characteristics of galaxies by: Describe the basic properties of normal galaxies, discuss the distance-measurement techniques that are use to map the universe beyond the Milky Way, describe how galaxies are observed to clump or cluster, state Hubble’s Law and explain how it is used to derive distances, specify the basic differences between active and normal galaxies, explain what drives the central engine to power active galaxies.\n\nUnderstand the large scale structure of the cosmos by: Describe some of the methods used to determine the mass of distant galaxies, explain why astronomers think most of the matter in the universe is invisible, discuss some theories of how galaxies are formed and evolve, explain the role of black holes and active galaxies in current theories of galactic evolution, summarize what is known about the large-scale distribution of galaxies in the universe, describe some techniques used by astronomers to probe the universe on very large scale.\n\nUnderstand the properties of the big bang and the fate of the universe by: State the cosmological principles and explain it significance, explain what observations of the dark sky tell us about the age of the universe, describe the Big Bang theory of the expanding universe, discuss the possible outcomes of the present cosmic expansion, describe the relationship between the density of the universe and the overall geometry of space, say why astronomers think the expansion of the universe is accelerating and the cause, explain what dark energy implies for the composition and age of the universe, describe the cosmic microwave background and explain its importance to the science of cosmology\n\nLab

Academic dishonesty of any kind will not be tolerated. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating on an examination or other academic work, plagiarism, collusion, and the abuse of resource materials including unauthorized use of Generative AI. Departments may adopt discipline specific guidelines on Generative AI usage approved by the instructional dean. Any student who is demonstrated to have engaged in any of these activities will be subject to immediate disciplinary action in accordance with institutional procedures.\n\nHope Statement\n\nAny student who faces challenges securing basic resources such as food, clothing, or housing and believes this may affect their performance in their course of study is urged to contact the Director of Student Resources, Dr. Deborah Cregger, for support at (817) 598-6444. Her office is on the first floor of Student Services. If the student prefers, they may contact their instructor, who can reach out on their behalf. Weatherford College also provides the Coyote Pantry. The Pantry maintains boxed and canned foods for students in need. The location of the Coyote Pantry is two blocks west of the Weatherford campus at the Baptist Student Ministry (118 E. Park Ave., Weatherford). Pantry hours are Mon-Thurs. 8:30 am-4:30 pm and Fri. 8.30 am-12:00 pm (817-599-6586).\n\nRevised\n\nFall 2021\n\nLast Modified\n\nTuesday, September 14, 2021, 11:11 AM"
