If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, send it to curiouskidsus@theconversation.com.\n\nExactly how many stars are in space? – MeeSong, Brookline, Massachusetts\n\nLook up at the sky on a clear night, and you’ll see thousands of stars – about 6,000 or so.\n\nBut that’s only a tiny fraction of all the stars out there. The rest are too far away for us to see them.\n\nThe universe, galaxies, stars\n\nYet astronomers like me have figured out how to estimate the total number of stars in the universe, which is everything that exists.\n\nScattered throughout the universe are galaxies – clusters of stars, planets, gas and dust bunched together.\n\nLike people, galaxies are diverse. They come in different sizes and shapes.\n\nEarth is in the Milky Way, a spiral galaxy; its stars cluster in spiral arms that swirl around the galaxy’s center.\n\nOther galaxies are elliptical – kind of egg-shaped – and some are irregular, with a variety of shapes.\n\nCounting the galaxies\n\nBefore calculating the number of stars in the universe, astronomers first have to estimate the number of galaxies.\n\nTo do that, they take very detailed pictures of small parts of the sky and count all the galaxies they see in those pictures.\n\nThat number is then multiplied by the number of pictures needed to photograph the whole sky.\n\nThe answer: There are approximately 2,000,000,000,000 galaxies in the universe – that’s 2 trillion.\n\nCounting the stars\n\nAstronomers don’t know exactly how many stars are in each of those 2 trillion galaxies. Most are so distant, there’s no way to tell precisely.\n\nBut we can make a good guess at the number of stars in our own Milky Way. Those stars are diverse, too, and come in a wide variety of sizes and colors.\n\nOur Sun, a white star, is medium-size, medium-weight and medium-hot: 27 million degrees Fahrenheit at its center (15 million degrees Celsius).\n\nBigger, heavier and hotter stars tend to be blue, like Vega in the constellation Lyra. Smaller, lighter and dimmer stars are usually red, like Proxima Centauri. Except for the Sun, it’s the closest star to us.\n\nAn incredible number\n\nRed, white and blue stars give off different amounts of light. By measuring that starlight – specifically, its color and brightness – astronomers can estimate how many stars our galaxy holds.\n\nWith that method, they discovered the Milky Way has about 100 billion stars – 100,000,000,000.\n\nNow the next step. Using the Milky Way as our model, we can multiply the number of stars in a typical galaxy (100 billion) by the number of galaxies in the universe (2 trillion).\n\nThe answer is an absolutely astounding number. There are approximately 200 billion trillion stars in the universe. Or, to put it another way, 200 sextillion.\n\nThat’s 200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000!\n\nThe number is so big, it’s hard to imagine. But try this: It’s about 10 times the number of cups of water in all the oceans of Earth.\n\nThink about that the next time you’re looking at the night sky – and then wonder about what might be happening on the trillions of worlds orbiting all those stars.\n\nHello, curious kids! Do you have a question you’d like an expert to answer? Ask an adult to send your question to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com. Please tell us your name, age and the city where you live.\n\nAnd since curiosity has no age limit – adults, let us know what you’re wondering, too. We won’t be able to answer every question, but we will do our best."
