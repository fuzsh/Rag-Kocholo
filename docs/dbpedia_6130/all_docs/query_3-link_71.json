        "text": "Hipparcos measurements provide accurate measurements of distance for stars which are within about 100 to 200 parsecs. That includes a lot of stars, but is only a small fraction of the size of our galaxy. How can we extend these results for nearby stars to objects halfway across our Milky Way Galaxy, or to stars in other galaxies?\n\nPart one of the answer is to use the inverse square law to calculate the distance to an object, given its apparent brightness -- which is easy to measure -- and its intrinsic luminosity. But how to we know a star's intrinsic luminosity?\n\nWell, we can start by making some very simple (and wrong) assumptions, and then try to improve those assumptions.\n\nall stars have the same luminosity (simple and wrong)\n\nall stars have the same relationship between color and luminosity (less simple, less wrong)\n\nall main sequence stars have the same relationship between color and luminosity (complicated, but correct enough for most purposes)\n\nThe Inverse Square Law\n\nStars behave like all light-emitting bodies: their apparent brightness decreases if one moves them farther away. In fact, there is a simple mathematical rule which describes the change in a star's apparent brightness as a function of its distance away from us:\n\n2 apparent brightness at distance A [ distance B ] --------------------------------- = [ ------------ ] apparent brightness at distance B [ distance A ]\n\nThis is called the inverse square law, because the ratio of brightnesses depends on the square of the inverse of the ratio of distances.\n\nFor example, suppose a star is exactly 10 parsecs away from us. We can measure its brightness -- call it \"B\". Now, if an alien race moves the star so that is becomes 20 parsecs away from us, we will measure a brightness which is only one-fourth of \"B\".\n\nAnother way to write the inverse square law involves the luminosity of a star. Luminosity is the total amount of energy emitted by a star each second; it can be measured in Watts, just like a light bulb. The luminosity is an intrinsic property of a star -- it doesn't depend on the star's distance from us in any way. The apparent brightness of a star can be written as\n\nluminosity of star apparent brightness of star = ---------------------- 4 * pi * (distance)^2\n\nOnce again, note how the apparent brightness depends on the square of the distance.\n\nSo, if we know the intrinsic luminosity of a star, and we can measure its apparent brightness, then we can calculate its distance.\n\nBut how can we determine a star's intrinsic luminosity?\n\nTemperature, radius, and luminosity\n\nTwo factors control the luminosity of a star:\n\ntemperature: high temperature means more energy emitted\n\nsize: large size means more energy emitted\n\nTemperature turns out to be more important -- even a small change in temperature can make a very large difference in luminosity. Physicists have figured out the exact equation:\n\nluminosity = (area) * (energy emitted per area) 2 4 = ( 4 pi R ) * ( sigma * T )\n\nwhere\n\nR is the radius of the star\n\nT is the temperature of the star, on the Kelvin scale\n\nsigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant; you can look up its value in a book.\n\nSo, if two stars are the size size, but different temperatures, the hotter one is more luminous:\n\nThe difference grows very rapidly with temperature:\n\nratio of temperature ratio of luminosity ---------------------- ------------------------ 1 1 1.1 1.5 1.5 5 2 16 3 81 10 10,000\n\nIf two stars are the same temperature, but different sizes, then the larger one is more luminous:\n\nThe difference grows more slowly with size:\n\nratio of radius ratio of luminosity ---------------------- ------------------------ 1 1 1.1 1.2 1.5 2.3 2 4 3 9 10 100\n\nThe bottom line is that, unless we know both the temperature and the size of a star, we can't figure out its luminosity ... and that will prevent us from using its apparent brightness to figure out its distance. Rats.\n\nThe color-magnitude diagram\n\nWe want to figure out the temperature and size of a star, so that we can determine its distance.\n\nTemperature is actually pretty easy to determine:\n\nthe color of a star gives a decent estimate of its temperature: blue stars are hot, red stars are cool. Color is very easy to measure; just compare the amount of light seen through a blueish filter with the amount seen through a reddish filter.\n\nthe spectrum of a star provides a much more accurate estimate of its temperature. The relative darkness of absorption lines of different elements can be compared to atomic properties, and models of the stellar atmosphere.\n\nThe real problem is figuring out the size of a star. Hmmmm...\n\nBut, in an exception to the general rule, the universe turns out to be nice to astronomers (for once): there is a fundamental relationship between the temperature of a star and its size, which is true for about 90% of all stars. This relationship is revealed in the color-magnitude diagram, which is also called the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.\n\nHipparcos measured the colors (and hence rough temperature) for lots of nearby stars. It also measured the distance to those stars, from which we can derive their luminosities. If we plot the luminosity versus the color, we find this:\n\nRather than being scattered all over the graph, almost all the stars fall into a band which runs from upper-left to lower-right. This band is called the main sequence. Stars along this band\n\nare burning hydrogen into helium in their cores\n\nvary in temperature, from about 40,000 at the blue end to about 3,000 at the red end\n\nvary in size -- the biggest blue stars are about 10 times larger than the Sun, and the smallest red are about 10 times smaller than the Sun.\n\nare called \"dwarfs\" (yes, even though they do range quite a bit in size)\n\nIt turns out that the relatively simple relationship between temperature and size stems from the fact that all these stars are powered by the same fusion reactions in their cores.\n\nAnyway, one important consequence is that we can almost use the color of a star (easy to measure) to guess its luminosity ... and that would give us its distance.\n\nmeasure color of star through several filters\n\nuse color-magnitude diagram to turn color into luminosity\n\nuse luminosity and apparent brightness to get distance\n\nBut -- there's one problem with this method: the giants.\n\nDwarfs versus Giants\n\nA small fraction of stars (perhaps 5 percent) do not obey the ordinary relationship between color and size. These stars, called giants, are much, much larger than ordinary stars of the same temperature. Why? Because giant stars are not simply fusing hydrogen to helium in their cores; some have shells of fusing material surrounding an inert core, others are fusing helium into heavier elements. The differences in energy generation eventually (through a long chain of physical phenomena) cause the outer layers of these stars to move much farther away from the cores.\n\nIf we look at one particular star, and measure its color and apparent brightness, there are sometimes two possible values for its luminosity:\n\na relatively small luminosity, if it lies on the main sequence; this would mean it is relatively close to us ...\n\na much higher luminosity, if it happens to be a giant star; this would mean that it is relatively far away ...\n\nNow, most of the time, the star would turn out to be on the main sequence, so we could just always make that assumption. But even a small fraction of mis-classified stars with very wrong distances could screw up our whole view of the Galaxy.\n\nIs there any way to separate the dwarfs from the giants, so that we can combine the apparent brightness of a star and its inferred luminosity to calculate its distance safely?\n\nUsing clusters to distinguish dwarfs and giants\n\nYes! One solution is to concentrate on clusters of stars. There are several types of stellar clusters:\n\nOpen clusters contain mostly young stars, with lots of hot, blue stars:\n\nGlobular clusters have many more stars, most of which are relatively old, cool, and red:\n\nThe important thing about clusters is that all the stars in the cluster are at (nearly) the same distance from Earth. This means that if we make a color-magnitude diagram for stars which belong to a cluster, the difference between main-sequence stars and giants is easy to see:\n\nThis diagram, for the open cluster called M67, shows that if we pick a star with color = 1, then\n\nif it has a brightness of about magnitude V = 16 , it's on the main sequence\n\nif it has brightness of about magnitude V = 13, it's a giant\n\nSuppose we look at another open cluster -- for example, the one called NGC 188:\n\nIn this case, if we look at a star with color = 1, then\n\nif it has a brightness of about magnitude V = 17.5 , it's on the main sequence\n\nif it has brightness of about magnitude V = 15, it's a giant\n\nGreat! Now, we can make a fair comparison of the distance between the two clusters, simply by matching up the stars on the main sequence with the same colors. It looks like we need to slide a star at color = 1 in NGC 188 upwards by about 1.5 magnitudes to make it match the brightness of a similar star in M67. That means that M67 is closer than NGC 188; and, using the inverse square law, we can figure out exactly how much closer.\n\nSo, simply by comparing the color-magnitude diagrams of two star clusters, we can figure out their relative distances from Earth. But how can we determine their absolute distances?\n\nSimple -- thanks to Hipparcos. The Hipparcos satellite provided us with information with which we can make a color-magnitude diagram for stars with KNOWN distances. So, we just compare the color-magnitude diagram for a star cluster to the color-magnitude diagram from Hipparcos;\n\nthe Hipparcos diagram gives us the luminosity for stars\n\nthe cluster diagram gives us the apparent brightness for stars\n\nUsing the inverse square law, we can calculate the actual distances to the stars. Rah, rah!\n\nFor more information, see\n\nThe Hipparcos satellite's color-magnitude diagrams\n\nRichard McCray's explanation of Hertzsprung Russell diagrams and their use for estimating distances to stars.\n\nAn article on photometry of the open cluster NGC 188 by Sarajedini et al., in Astronomical Journal, vol 118, p. 2894, December 1999, contains the color-magnitude diagrams shown in this lecture.\n\nIf you work with real astronomical data, you need to understand the way astronomers measure apparent brightness -- with the magnitude scale.
