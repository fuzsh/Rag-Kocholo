        "text": "Image Galaxy Constellation Origin of name Notes Andromeda Galaxy Andromeda Andromeda, which is shortened from \"Andromeda Galaxy\", gets its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda. Andromeda is the closest big galaxy to the Milky Way and is expected to collide with the Milky Way around 4.5 billion years from now. The two will eventually merge into a single new galaxy called Milkdromeda. Antennae Galaxies Corvus Appearance is similar to an insect's antennae. Two colliding galaxies Backward Galaxy Centaurus It appears to rotate backwards, as the tips of the spiral arms point in the direction of rotation. Bear Paw Galaxy Lynx It resembles the appearance of a bear's claw. Also known as \"Bear Claw Galaxy.\" Black Eye Galaxy Coma Berenices It has a spectacular dark band of absorbing dust in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus, giving rise to its nicknames of the \"Black Eye\" or \"Evil Eye\" galaxy. Also known as \"Sleeping Beauty Galaxy.\" Bode's Galaxy Ursa Major Named for Johann Elert Bode who discovered this galaxy in 1774. Also known as Messier 81. The largest galaxy in the M81 Group. It harbors a supermassive black hole 70 million times the mass of the Sun. Butterfly Galaxies Virgo Looks are similar to a butterfly. Cartwheel Galaxy Sculptor Its visual appearance is similar to that of a spoked cartwheel. The largest in the Cartwheel Galaxy group, made up of four spiral galaxies Cigar Galaxy Ursa Major Appears similar in shape to a cigar. Also known as Messier 82 or M82 Circinus Galaxy Circinus Named after the constellation it is located in (Circinus). Coma Pinwheel Galaxy Coma Berenices Named after its resemblance to the Pinwheel Galaxy and its location in the Coma Berenices constellation. Also known as Messier 99 or M99 Comet Galaxy Sculptor This galaxy is named after its unusual appearance, looking like a comet. The comet effect is caused by tidal stripping by its galaxy cluster, Abell 2667. Condor Galaxy Pavo Named after a condor, a type of vulture that is one of the largest flying birds. The largest known spiral galaxy, it has a diameter of over 665,300 light-years (204.0 kiloparsecs).[3] It is tidally disturbed by the smaller lenticular galaxy IC 4970.[4] Cosmos Redshift 7 Sextans The name of this galaxy is based on a Redshift (z) measurement of nearly 7 (actually, z = 6.604).[5] Galaxy Cosmos Redshift 7 is reported to be the brightest of distant galaxies (z > 6) and to contain some of the earliest first stars (first generation; Population III) that produced the chemical elements needed for the later formation of planets and life as we know it.[5] Eye of God Eridanus Name after its structural appearance A prototype for multi-arm spiral galaxies Eye of Sauron Canes Venatici Due to its resemblance to the Eye of Sauron from The Lord of the Rings. Fireworks Galaxy Cygnus and Cepheus Due to its bright and spotty appearance Active starburst galaxy Grasshopper Lynx Named after its appearance to a grasshopper Two colliding galaxies Hockey Stick Galaxies Canes Venatici Its elongated and curved appearance resembles a hockey stick. Also known as Crowbar Galaxy Hoag's Object Serpens Caput This is named after Art Hoag, who discovered this ring galaxy. It is of the subtype Hoag-type galaxy, and may in fact be a polar-ring galaxy with the ring in the plane of rotation of the central object. Large Magellanic Cloud Dorado/Mensa Named after Ferdinand Magellan This is the fourth-largest galaxy in the Local Group, and forms a pair with the SMC, and from recent research, may not be part of the Milky Way system of satellites at all.[6] Lindsay-Shapley Ring Volans Named after its discoverer, Eric Lindsay, his professor Harlow Shapley, and its nature as a ring galaxy. The ring is the result of collision with another galaxy Little Sombrero Galaxy Pegasus Named after its similarity to the Sombrero Galaxy. Malin 1 Coma Berenices Discovered and named by David Malin. Also known as Messier 99 or M99 Medusa Merger Ursa Major Ejected dust from the merging galaxies is said to look like the snakes that the Gorgon Medusa from Greek mythology had on her head. Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy Sculptor Similar to the Sculpture Galaxies Also known as Sculptor Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, Sculptor Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy, and formerly as the Sculptor System Mice Galaxies Coma Berenices Appearance is similar to a mouse. Small Magellanic Cloud Tucana Named after Ferdinand Magellan This forms a pair with the LMC, and from recent research, may not be part of the Milky Way system of satellites at all. Mayall's Object Ursa Major This is named after Nicholas Mayall, of the Lick Observatory, who discovered it.[7][8][9] Also called VV 32 and Arp 148, this is a very peculiar looking object, and is likely to be not one galaxy, but two galaxies undergoing a collision. Event in images is a spindle shape and a ring shape. Milky Way Sagittarius (centre) The appearance from Earth of the galaxy—a band of light The galaxy containing the Sun and its Solar System, and therefore Earth. Needle Galaxy Coma Berenices Named due to its slender appearance. Also known as Caldwell 38 Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte Cetus Named for the three astronomers instrumental in its discovery and identification. Paramecium Galaxy Pegasus Named after its appearance to the organism Paramecium It is included in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies in the category galaxies with detached segments. Peekaboo Galaxy Hydra Galaxy (aka HIPASS J1131-31) was hidden behind a relatively fast-moving foreground star (TYC 7215-199-1) and became observable when the star moved aside. Galaxy, relatively nearby, is considered one of the most metal-poor (\"extremely metal-poor\" (XMP)), least chemically enriched, and seemingly primordial, galaxies known.[10][11] Pinwheel Galaxy Ursa Major Similar in appearance to a pinwheel (toy). Also known as Messier 101 or M101 Sculptor Galaxy Sculptor Named after its location in the Sculptor Constellation. Also called the Silver Dollar or Silver Coin Galaxy, because of its light and circular appearance. Also known as the Silver Coin, Silver Dollar Galaxy or Caldwell 65 Sombrero Galaxy Virgo Similar in appearance to a sombrero. Also known as Messier Object 104 or M104 Southern Pinwheel Galaxy Hydra Named after its resemblance to the Pinwheel Galaxy and its location in the southern celestial hemisphere. Spider Galaxy Boötes Name after its appearance of a spider Sunflower Galaxy Canes Venatici Similar in appearance to a sunflower. Tadpole Galaxy Draco The name comes from the resemblance of the galaxy to a tadpole. This shape resulted from tidal interaction that drew out a long tidal tail. Triangulum Galaxy Triangulum Named after its location within the Triangulum constellation. Whirlpool Galaxy Canes Venatici From the whirlpool appearance this gravitationally disturbed galaxy exhibits.

At the time, the most remote object was quasar OQ172, at z=3.53, found in 1974.[72]\n\nFrom 1964 to 1997, the title of most distant object in the universe were held by a succession of quasars.[79] That list is available at list of quasars.\n\n3C 295 1960– z=0.461 This is a radio galaxy. This was the remotest object known at time of discovery of its redshift. This was the last non-quasar to hold the title of most distant object known until 1997. In 1964, quasar 3C 147 became the most distant object in the universe known.[72][79][93][94][95] LEDA 25177 (MCG+01-23-008) 1951–1960 z=0.2\n\n(V=61000 km/s) This galaxy lies in the Hydra Supercluster. It is located at B1950.0 08h 55m 4s +03° 21′ and is the BCG of the fainter Hydra Cluster Cl 0855+0321 (ACO 732).[72][95][96][97][98][99][100][101] LEDA 51975 (MCG+05-34-069) 1936– z=0.13\n\n(V=39000 km/s) The brightest cluster galaxy of the Bootes cluster (ACO 1930), an elliptical galaxy at B1950.0 14h 30m 6s +31° 46′ apparent magnitude 17.8, was found by Milton L. Humason in 1936 to have a 40,000 km/s recessional redshift velocity.[99][102][103] LEDA 20221 (MCG+06-16-021) 1932 – z=0.075\n\n(V=23000 km/s) This is the BCG of the Gemini Cluster (ACO 568) and was located at B1950.0 07h 05m 0s +35° 04′[102][104] BCG of WMH Christie's Leo Cluster 1931–1932 z=\n\n(V=19700 km/s) [104][105][106][107] BCG of Baede's Ursa Major Cluster 1930–1931 z=\n\n(V=11700 km/s) [107][108] NGC 4860 1929–1930 z=0.026\n\n(V=7800 km/s) [109][110] NGC 7619 1929 z=0.012\n\n(V=3779 km/s) Using redshift measurements, NGC 7619 was the highest at the time of measurement. At the time of announcement, it was not yet accepted as a general guide to distance; however, later in the year, Edwin Hubble described redshift in relation to distance, leading to a seachange, and having this being accepted as an inferred distance.[109][111][112] NGC 584 (Dreyer nebula 584) 1921–1929 z=0.006\n\n(V=1800 km/s) At the time, nebula had yet to be accepted as independent galaxies. However, in 1923, galaxies were generally recognized as external to the Milky Way.[99][109][111][113][114][115][116] M104 (NGC 4594) 1913–1921 z=0.004\n\n(V=1180 km/s) This was the second galaxy whose redshift was determined; the first being Andromeda—which is approaching us and thus cannot have its redshift used to infer distance. Both were measured by Vesto Melvin Slipher. At this time, nebula had yet to be accepted as independent galaxies. NGC 4594 was originally measured as 1000 km/s, then refined to 1100, and then to 1180 in 1916.[109][113][116] M81 antiquity –\n\n20th century[d] 11.8 Mly z=-0.10) This is the lower bound, as it is remotest galaxy observable with the naked eye. It is 12 million light-years away. Redshift cannot be used to infer distance, because it is moving toward us faster than cosmological expansion. Messier 101 1930– Using the pre-1950s Cepheid measurements, M101 was one of the most distant so measured. Triangulum Galaxy 1924–1930 In 1924, Edwin Hubble announced the distance to M33 Triangulum. Andromeda Galaxy 1923–1924 In 1923, Edwin Hubble measured the distance to Andromeda, and settled the question of whether or not there were galaxies, or if everything was in the Milky Way. Small Magellanic Cloud 1913–1923 This was the first intergalactic distance measured. In 1913, Ejnar Hertzsprung measures the distance to SMC using Cepheid variables."
