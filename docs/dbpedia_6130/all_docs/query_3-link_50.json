        "text": "Early observers looking at the night sky noticed patterns in the stars . These patterns, which we call constellations, might appear to change place, but they don’t change shape. People around the world gave them names (like Orion the hunter or Leo the lion) and told stories about them. You may know some of these stories as myths, or as astrology. Astrology can be fun to think about, but it’s different from astronomy. Astrology is not science!\n\nEarly observers also noticed some bright objects in the sky that seem to wander around among the stars. The ancient Greek philosophers called these objects “planets,” which is Greek for “wanderers.” The planets are our near neighbors, and they do move. They orbit the Sun , just as Earth does.\n\nThe stars may all look the same distance away, as if they were pasted on the wall of a giant dome. But that's an illusion too. Some stars are tens of thousands of light years farther away from Earth than others. You can see this illusion for yourself by building your own Big Dipper.\n\nHow can we tell how far away a star is? One clue is its brightness. Distant stars look dimmer than they would if we were close to them. But that clue isn’t very reliable, because stars vary a lot in their brightness. Some stars that stand out in the sky aren’t actually very far away compared to other stars—they’re just incredibly big and bright. And some nearby stars are dim. In fact, our Sun’s closest star neighbor, Proximus Centuri, is so faint and tiny that we need a telescope to see it!\n\nTry this!\n\nIt’s easy to see for yourself how this works because your two eyes are in two different places. To try it, face a background with a lot of objects in it, like a bookcase or a landscape with trees.\n\nFirst, hold your thumb up at arm’s length and look at it through your right eye, keeping your left closed. Then look through your left eye, keeping your right eye closed. See how your thumb seems to jump, blocking different books or trees? Next, move your thumb right in front of your nose and try again, looking through each eye separately. See how much farther your thumb seems to jump when it’s closer to your eyes?\n\nAstronomers can use satellites in two different positions (instead of two eyes) to calculate the distance to a star (instead of a thumb).\n\nYou might feel like you’re sitting still, but you’re actually flying through space incredibly fast! That’s because Earth is carrying you like a spaceship.\n\nEarth is spinning. If you were standing on the equator, you and the spot under your feet would be rotating at a speed of about a thousand miles per hour. But Earth is also orbiting around the Sun, moving even faster: 67,000 miles per hour. And the Sun itself is moving around the center of our galaxy, carrying everything in the solar system with it, at a rate of 490,000 miles per hour. And that’s not all. Our galaxy, the Milky Way , is moving too—at a rate of 872,405 miles per hour. Our cluster of galaxies is moving too. And so is everything else in the universe.\n\nIf Earth is moving so fast, why don’t we fly off? Thank gravity for that. Gravity is the force of attraction between all objects in the universe. An object’s gravity depends on its mass —its total amount of matter , or “stuff.” The more massive the object, the stronger the gravitational force. And the closer two objects are, the stronger the gravitational pull between them. Gravity is what keeps your feet on the ground—and what keeps Earth and the planets orbiting around the Sun instead of floating away.\n\nWhen you jump, you always fall back to Earth. What goes up must come down, right? Not quite! Something can go up and not come down if it reaches the escape velocity, the speed at which it breaks free from a planet’s gravitational pull. That’s how rockets work. Their engines are designed to push the rocket up so hard that it moves fast enough to get away. The universe is full of “runaway” stars and planets that escaped the gravity of their neighbors.\n\nLight is a form of energy called electromagnetic radiation. We see objects because they reflect, or bounce, light into our eyes. But there’s a whole spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, and our eyes can detect only a teeny, tiny portion of it. That portion—visible light—consists of different wavelengths of light that we perceive as different colors. If you think of the electromagnetic spectrum as a piano keyboard, visible light is the equivalent of a single octave. Objects in space are emitting or reflecting radiation from all across the spectrum, including ultraviolet (UV), infrared, microwaves, and radio waves. To see this invisible electromagnetic radiation, we need to use special tools like microwave telescopes and gamma-ray telescopes.\n\nSo far we’ve talked about things we can detect with our eyes and our tools, like galaxies, stars, and planets. These objects (and even trees, puppies, and ourselves) are all called matter. But did you know that there are things in the universe that we can’t detect, no matter what instruments we use? They’re called dark matter and dark energy.\n\nDark matter doesn't give off light like a galaxy or absorb light like a black hole. Scientists know it exists because it has a gravitational pull, just like normal matter.\n\nDark energy is a mysterious pressure working in opposition to gravity, pushing matter apart.\n\nScientists still don’t know very much about dark matter and dark energy, but they are hard at work trying to find out more. Maybe one of those scientists will be you!\n\nWhen you think of an astronomer, maybe you’re imagining someone using a telescope to collect data about objects in the sky. Some astronomers do that—they’re called observational astronomers. But there are lots of other kinds of astronomers too! Do you like to build things? Make things work? Write computer programs? Solve equations? There are astronomers who do all different things like these."
