        "text": "*Billions of galaxies make up the universe, which, according to the big bang model, formed between 10 & 20 billion years ago.\n\nAfter today’s lecture, you should be able to:\n\n-Tell what a galaxy is and describe the various types of galaxies.\n\n-Explain the origin of the universe according to the big bang model.\n\nA) Galaxies\n\nGalaxy = a collection of stars, planets, gases, dust, and satellites (moons)\n\nObjects within a galaxy move through space together as a whole unit.\n\nHeld together by gravity.\n\nAt least 1 billion galaxies are in the universe. (May be 50-100 billion!)\n\nEach galaxy is made-up of billions of stars, wh/in turn makes-up most of the visible mass of the universe!\n\nAlmost every light you see in the night sky is in the Milky Way Galaxy, the galaxy we live in!\n\nOur sun is just 1 star among billions!\n\nOur solar system is located on the edge of the galaxy, wh/spans 100,000 lit-yrs!\n\nNorthern Hemisphere = see Andromeda Galaxy (2 million light years away)\n\nSouthern Hemisphere = see Magellanic Clouds\n\n– Our 2 nearest galactic neighbors; Can be seen without a telescope.\n\nB) Types of Galaxies\n\nClassified by their shape.\n\n1. Elliptical Galaxies = shaped like a flattened football\n\nMost do not rotate (spin)\n\nContain less material than other types of galaxies\n\nMay be older and more condensed.\n\n2. Spiral Galaxies = shaped like a flat disc with a bulge in the center\n\nLong, twisted arms that rotate around the center like a pin wheel\n\nUsually contain large amounts of gas and dust\n\nEx.- The Milky Way Galaxy\n\n3. Barred Spiral Galaxies = arms are attached to a straight-bar shape\n\nBar is much brighter than the arms\n\n4. Irregular Galaxies = vary greatly in size and shape\n\nLeast common type of galaxy\n\nEx.- Magellanic Clouds\n\nC) Other Star Groups\n\nLocal Group = cluster of several galaxies (Most galaxies are in these.)\n\nStar Cluster = areas where many stars are close together\n\nPleiadez = grouping of 7 stars (fall/winter)\n\nBinary Star = a pair of stars\n\nMore numerous than single stars.\n\nD) Constellations\n\nStars that appear to be in patterns as seen from Earth. (A product of peoples’ imaginations!)\n\nBig Dipper (Ursa Major), Orion, etc.\n\n88 constellations in all\n\nHelp form a picture of the night sky and tell the season.\n\nE) Expansion of the Universe\n\nBig-Bang Theory = How the universe began; Occurred 10-20 billion years ago.\n\nAll matter in the universe was packed into a giant sphere of H.\n\nIt exploded, spreading matter and gases outward.\n\nAs matter cooled, the force of gravity pulled particles together to form galaxies, stars, etc.\n\nMain evidence to support this = Most galaxies are moving away from each other (redshifting)!\n\n2. How do scientists know the universe is expanding?\n\nDoppler Effect = apparent change in wavelength due to an object’s position\n\nMoving away = appear to have a longer wavelength (redshift)\n\nStanding still = no change in wavelength\n\nMoving closer = appear to have a shorter wavelength (blueshift\n\nWilliam Anderson (Schoolworkhelper Editorial Team)\n\nWilliam completed his Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts in 2013.
