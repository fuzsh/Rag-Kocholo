        "text": "SUMMARY\n\nThe Hubble classification scheme divides galaxies into several classes, depending on their appearance. Spiral galaxies have flattened disks, central bulges, and spiral arms. They are further subdivided on the basis of the size of the bulge and the tightness of the spiral structure. The halos of these galaxies consist of old stars, whereas the gas-rich disks are the sites of ongoing star formation. Barred-spiral galaxies contain an extended \"bar\" of material projecting beyond the central bulge.\n\nElliptical galaxies have no disk and contain no gas or dust. In most cases, they consist entirely of old stars. They range in size from dwarf ellipticals, which are much less massive than the Milky Way Galaxy, to giant ellipticals, which may contain trillions of stars. S0 and SB0 galaxies have properties intermediate between those of ellipticals and spirals. They have extended halos and stellar disks and bulges (and bars, in the SB0 case) but little or no gas and dust.\n\nIrregular galaxies are galaxies that do not fit into either of the other categories. Some may be the result of galactic collisions or close encounters. Many irregulars are rich in gas and dust and are the sites of vigorous star formation. The Magellanic Clouds, two small systems that orbit the Milky Way Galaxy, are examples of this type of galaxy.\n\nAstronomers often use standard candles as distance-measuring tools. These are objects that are easily recognizable (by their light curves, spectra, or some other directly observable characteristic) and whose luminosities are known to lie in some reasonably well-defined range. Comparing luminosity and apparent brightness, astronomers determine the distance using the inverse-square law. Type I supernovae are particularly useful for measuring distances to faraway galaxies. They are bright and hence easily seen, and have a relatively narrow spread in luminosity. An alternative is the Tully-Fisher relation, an empirical correlation between rotational velocity and luminosity in spiral galaxies. By measuring the rotation speed of a spiral and using this relationship, astronomers can determine the galaxy's luminosity and hence its distance.\n\nThe Milky Way, Andromeda, and several other smaller galaxies form the Local Group, a small galaxy cluster. Galaxy clusters consist of a collection of galaxies orbiting one another, bound together by their own gravity. The nearest large galaxy cluster to the Local Group is known as the Virgo Cluster. Galaxy clusters themselves tend to clump together into superclusters. The Virgo Cluster, the Local Group, and several other nearby clusters form the Local Supercluster.\n\nThe masses of nearby spiral galaxies can be determined by studying their rotation curves. For more distant spirals, masses can be inferred from observations of the broadening of their spectral lines. On larger scales, astronomers use studies of binary galaxies and galaxy clusters to obtain statistical mass estimates of the galaxies involved. As in the Milky Way Galaxy, measurements of the masses of other galaxies and of galaxy clusters reveal the presence of large amounts of dark matter that is presently undetectable at any electromagnetic wavelength. The fraction of dark matter apparently grows as the scale under consideration increases. Large amounts of hot X-ray-emitting gas have been detected among the galaxies in many clusters, but not enough to account for the dark matter inferred from dynamical studies.\n\nResearchers know of no evolutionary sequence that links spiral, elliptical, and irregular galaxies, and the process of galaxy formation is still only poorly understood. There is growing evidence that large galaxies formed by the merger of smaller ones in a process that may be continuing today. Collisions and mergers of galaxies play very important roles in galactic evolution. Interactions between galaxies appear to be very common. A starburst galaxy may result when a galaxy experiences a close encounter with a neighbor. The strong tidal distortions caused by the encounter compress galactic gas, resulting in a widespread burst of star formation.\n\nDistant galaxies are observed to be receding from the Milky Way at rates that increase proportional to their distances from us. This relationship between recessional speed and distance is called Hubble's law. The constant of proportionality in the law is Hubble's constant. Its value is believed to lie between 45 and 90 km/s/Mpc, with most astronomers now favoring a value closer to the lower end of this range. Astronomers use Hubble's law to determine distances to the most remote objects in the universe. The redshift associated with the Hubble expansion is called the cosmological redshift.\n\nOn very large scales, galaxies and galaxy clusters are not spread randomly throughout space. Instead, they are arranged on the surfaces of enormous \"bubbles\" of matter surrounding vast low-density regions called voids. The origin of this structure is thought to be closely related to conditions in the very earliest epochs of the universe.\n\nSELF-TEST: TRUE OR FALSE?\n\n1.

Search for examples of interacting galaxies of various types: (1) tidal interactions, (2) starburst galaxies, (3) collisions between two spirals, and (4) collisions between a spiral and an elliptical. For (1) look for galactic material pulled away from a galaxy by a neighboring galaxy. Is the latter galaxy also tidally distorted? In (2) the surest sign of starburst activity are bright knots of star formation. In what type(s) of galaxies do you find starburst activity? For (3) and (4) how do collisions differ depending on the types of galaxies involved. What typically happens to a spiral galaxy after a near-miss or collision? Do ellipticals suffer the same fate?"
