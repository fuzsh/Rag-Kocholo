Alberto Giacometti (1901-1966) was a Swiss sculptor, painter, draughtsman, and printmaker. He is considered one of the most important artists of the 20th century. Giacometti’s work is characterized by its elongated, attenuated figures, which have been interpreted as expressions of existential angst and alienation.

Early Life and Education

Giacometti was born in Borgonovo, Switzerland, in 1901. His father, Giovanni Giacometti, was a painter, and his mother, Annetta Giacometti-Stampa, was a member of a wealthy family from Stampa. Giacometti studied art in Geneva and Paris, and he was influenced by the Cubist and Surrealist movements.

Cubism and Surrealism

In the early 1920s, Giacometti moved to Paris, where he became involved with the Cubist movement. He was particularly influenced by the work of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Giacometti’s Cubist sculptures are characterized by their geometric forms and their fragmented figures.

In the late 1920s, Giacometti became involved with the Surrealist movement. He was influenced by the work of André Breton and Salvador Dalí. Giacometti’s Surrealist sculptures are characterized by their dreamlike imagery and their use of automatic drawing.

Mature Work and Style

In the 1930s, Giacometti began to experiment with a more realistic style. He created a number of sculptures of human figures that are characterized by their elongated, attenuated forms. These figures have been interpreted as expressions of existential angst and alienation.

Giacometti’s work from the 1940s and 1950s is his most celebrated. During this period, he created a number of his most famous sculptures, including « The Walking Man » (1947), « The City of Women » (1950), and « Four Women on a Base » (1950). These sculptures are characterized by their elongated, attenuated figures and their sense of isolation and despair.
