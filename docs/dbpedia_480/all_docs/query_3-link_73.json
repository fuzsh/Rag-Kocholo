        "text": "In May 2023, Tate Britain completed a rehanging of their extensive collection of British art. Since the turn of the millennium, the gallery has acquired more than 200 works of art, which are now on display for the first time in their new home. The paintings and sculptures hang chronologically, beginning in the 1500s and finishing in the present day. Each room focuses on a distinct era or style and explores how artists responded to social, cultural, political and technological changes.\n\nMany newly acquired paintings represent Britain’s multicultural history and those previously ignored, maligned or forgotten due to gender, race or sexuality. Several new works were produced by women, who until recent years were the largest marginalised group of artists.\n\nThe following examples of Tate Britain’s new acquisitions date between the 1850s and the Second World War. This small selection demonstrates the diversity of art in terms of theme, style and artist.\n\nWild Flowers at the Corner of a Cornfield – Martha Mutrie (c.1855-60)\n\nMartha Darley Mutrie (1824-85) was one of the few women who exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art in the 19th century. She studied at the Manchester School of Design and predominantly produced paintings of flowers, such as Wild Flowers at the Corner of a Cornfield. Her work attracted the likes of John Ruskin (1819-1900), a polymath who specialised in botany, amongst other things.\n\nIn 1855, Ruskin wrote about Mutrie’s work in his Academy Notes, saying, “These flower paintings are remarkable for very lovely, pure, and yet unobtrusive colour – perfectly tender, and yet luscious … and a richness of petal texture that seems absolutely scented. The arrangement is always graceful … (but) I wish this very accomplished artist would paint some banks of flowers in wild country, just as they grow, as she appears slightly in danger of falling into too artificial methods of grouping.” Mutrie took this mild criticism to heart and produced the painting of wildflowers that now hangs at Tate Britain.\n\nPyramid with Figures – Emily Sargent (c.1891)\n\nUntil recently, Emily Sargent (1857-1936) was little more than the sister of American artist John Singer Sargent (1856-1925). Although she frequently painted alongside her brother, Emily Sargent’s watercolours disappeared, reappearing in 1998 when a family member discovered 440 paintings hidden away in a trunk. Over the following two decades, the descendants of Sargent debated the future of the impressive find. Eventually, the family decided to donate the paintings to various museums in the United States and the United Kingdom. They gifted 29 watercolours to the Tate, including Pyramid with Figures.\n\nAlthough the Sargents came from America, Emily Sargent and her brother lived in Britain and enjoyed travelling to France, Italy, Spain and North Africa. Coming from a wealthy family, Sargent did not need to make money from her art; instead, she painted for pleasure. In 1891, Sargent and her brother visited Egypt, where she captured figures and goats walking between the pyramids.\n\nMost artists visiting Egypt focused on the pyramids, traditional cultures, ancient mythology and natural landscapes. During Sargent’s visit, she also studied modern life, as seen in Boats on the Nile, Luxor (c.1891). Modern transportation, particularly railways, opened up the world tourists. With tourists came new technologies, which, in turn, influenced the countries they visited. Sargent’s watercolour depicts felucca sailing boats on the River Nile, which continue to be a popular way of travel for tourists who want a break from the hustle and bustle of life on the shore.\n\nA Fisher Girl’s Light – Marianne Stokes (1899)\n\nA Fisher Girl’s Light or A Pilgrim of Volendam Returning from Kevelaer depicts a young woman returning from an annual pilgrimage to Kevelaer in Germany. Kevelaer is the largest Catholic pilgrimage location in northwest Europe and continues to attract more than 1 million pilgrims every year. The destination of the pilgrimage is a small chapel containing a print of Our Lady of Consolation. According to legend, a 17th-century merchant called Hendrik Busman heard a voice saying, “Here thou shalt build me a chapel”, and his wife Mechel had a vision of the print of Our Lady of Consolation inside, bathed in light.\n\nThe artist, Marianne Stokes (1855-1927), was an Austrian landscape painter who settled in England after marrying Adrian Scott Stokes (1854-1935) in 1884. Around this time, Stokes began painting religious and medieval scenes, having first been inspired by the Finnish artist Helene Schjerfbeck (1862-1946) and later the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.\n\nStokes painted A Fisher Girl’s Light before she abandoned oil paint for tempera and gesso in the 1890s. Although it is not a Biblical scene, Stokes hints at the girl’s religious thoughts by placing an image of the Virgin and Child in the centre of the glowing lantern. Critics also suggest the lantern’s reflection on the girl’s stomach symbolises marriage and motherhood. It was common for artists at the time to portray girls on the cusp of womanhood. Stokes also focused on local cultures and traditional ways of life. The girl, who returns to Volendam in the Netherlands, wears Dutch clothing. In the background, sailing ships indicate the country’s trading methods and transportation.\n\nThe Châtelaine – Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale (c.1904)\n\nAlthough primarily a painter and illustrator, Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale (1872-1945) produced a painted plaster model called The Châtelaine. The figure is a medieval keeper of a castle standing atop a castle-like plinth. Around her waist hangs a purse and a set of keys, which along with her demeanour, suggest she is weighed down by her responsibilities. Around the top of the plinth, Fortescue-Brickdale painted miniature landscapes inspired by Renaissance Florentine art.\n\nFortescue-Brickdale studied at the Royal Academy, where she met the illustrator Byam Shaw (1872-1919), who opened the Byam Shaw School of Art in 1910. Shaw convinced Fortescue-Brickdale to teach at the school, which she did from 1911. Meanwhile, she also produced and exhibited paintings at the Royal Academy and other London galleries, such as Leighton House.\n\nDuring her career, Fortescue-Brickdale received commissions for book illustrations, such as Tennyson’s Idylls of the King. She also illustrated works by Robert Browning (1812-89) and published her own work, Eleanor Fortescue Brickdale’s Golden Book of Famous Women (1919). Women in the book included Joan of Arc, Fair Rosamond, Catherine of Aragon, Guinevere and Catherine of Siena. In her later years, Fortescue-Brickdale produced stained glass windows for churches.\n\nIn a Glasgow Cotton Spinning Mill: Changing the Bobbin – Sylvia Pankhurst (1907)\n\nIn 2018, Helen Pankhurst and Alula Pankhurst, the grandchildren of Sylvia Pankhurst, gave Tate Britain four watercolours depicting working-class women in the early 1920s. The artworks had remained in the family for 111 years until recently going on display to honour the centenary of women’s suffrage. Today, two of the paintings are exhibited at Tate Britain, both from a series titled In a Glasgow Cotton Spinning Mill.\n\nMost people associate Sylvia Pankhurst with the Suffragette campaign in the early 20th century, yet she was also an artist. During her campaigning, Pankhurst became increasingly concerned about the lives of working-class women, particularly in industrial communities. In 1907, she toured the country, documenting the working and living conditions of the female workers. Pankhurst’s In a Glasgow Cotton Spinning Mill series visually represents the situations she observed.\n\nOne of Pankhurst’s watercolour paintings depicts a female worker changing a bobbin on a cotton spinning frame. Writing about her visit, Pankhurst said the factory was “so hot and airless that I fainted within an hour.” She also mentioned the deafening noise of the machines and the slave-like work of the women. The woman in Changing the Bobbin is barefoot and wears simple working clothes. The factory floor was wet, creating a damp environment that aided the spinning of cotton. “The most unpleasant features of the life in the cotton mill are the almost deafening noise of the machinery and the oppressive heat. Cotton will not spin, it is said, if the windows are open and the fresh air is allowed to come in.”\n\nPankhurst’s other painting in the series, Minding a Pair of Fine Frames, shows a woman taking a short break from her work. The worker sits beside several rows of complex machines loaded with bobbins. Rather than depicting her at work, Pankhurst painted the woman looking directly at the artist and audience, emphasising that she is an individual and not a stock character. Pankhurst wanted people to understand that the factory workers were no different than any other woman except for how they were treated at work.\n\nHistorian Kristina Huneault explored Pankhurst’s paintings and documentation of factory life in Difficult Subjects: Working Women and Visual Culture in Britain (2002). “In the hands of Sylvia Pankhurst the image of women’s labour posed an intrinsic challenge to the restrictive codes of femininity promulgated by so much Victorian visual culture. Her challenge was not simply celebratory of female employment. Pankhurst’s images are sensitive to the hardships experienced by working women in employment … nevertheless for Pankhurst women’s employment was also a potential means for gender equality.”\n\nFlora’s Cloak – Gluck (c.1923)\n\nSituated in the Reality and Dreams section of Tate Britain is a painting called Flora’s Cloak. It is thought to be the artist’s only nude figure and represents the mythical goddess of flowering plants. Unlike traditional artworks of Roman gods and goddesses, whose bodies have an unearthly quality, Gluck gave Flora a more realistic body, including muscular thighs and small, uneven breasts.\n\nGluck (born Hannah Gluckstein; 1895-1978) was a gender non-conforming artist who rejected forenames and prefixes, although they occasionally used the name Peter or Hig. Despite rejecting gender norms, Gluck celebrated the female body in Flora’s Cloak. Most paintings of women throughout history are modelled to suit the male gaze, but Gluck wanted to avoid objectifying women as objects of sexual desire.\n\nThroughout their career, Gluck mostly painted floral paintings or portraits. Just as they did not conform to a specific gender, neither did Gluck belong to a particular art style or movement. Gluck held several solo exhibitions to show their diverse range of art in terms of style and theme. Two year’s after the artist’s death in 1978, the Fine Art Society hosted a six-week memorial exhibition featuring 45 of Gluck’s paintings.\n\nMurder – Stanley William Hayter (1932-3)\n\nMurder is an abstract composition with a title that encourages the audience to associate the artwork with violence and death, yet the artist depicts neither. Stanley William Hayter (1901-88) was a British artist associated with surrealism and abstract expressionism. In 1928, he founded the Atelier 17 studio in Paris, which was frequented by Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), Alberto Giacometti (1901-66), Joan Miró (1893-1983), Marc Chagall (1887-1985), Jackson Pollock (1912-56), Mark Rothko (1903-70) and Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944).\n\nHayter was known for his development of viscosity printing and other methods of printmaking, which makes Murder all the more unusual. It is one of the few works in which Hayter used collage. With string, Hayter created the outline of shapes, which, whilst they do not resemble a human body, may make the viewer think of chalk outlines drawn around bodies at crime scenes.\n\nUnemployed – Reginald Brill (1934-6)\n\nDuring the 1930s, unemployed workers held Hunger Marches throughout Britain in protest of the lack of jobs, which, in turn, meant people had no money to purchase food. The artist Reginald Brill (1902-74) witnessed one of these marches and felt moved to produce a series of large-scale works about the human condition. Unemployed depicts four men walking in a line beside a brick wall. One man holds out his hat as though asking for money, while another has his mouth open as though mid-song, suggesting that several marchers sang or chanted on their journey.\n\nBrill tackled many subjects involving the working class and made a significant contribution towards the visual culture of realism in Britain between the two World Wars. Brill juggled his career as an artist with his position as Principal of Kingston School of Art but continued to focus on the lives of ordinary workers in his artwork. Unfortunately, Brill failed to exhibit Unemployed during his lifetime despite hoping to feature it at the Royal Academy. Following his death in 1974, the Phoenix Gallery displayed the painting in a memorial exhibition, although under the title Men on the March.\n\nRush Hour – Peter László Peri (1937)\n\nMany artists emigrated from Europe to the UK between the two World Wars, including Peter László Peri (1899-1967). Peri was born László Weisz in Budapest but moved to various cities on the continent after completing an apprenticeship as a bricklayer. He began producing abstract geometric reliefs in Berlin in 1921 and exhibited with other constructivist artists who aimed to reflect modern industrial society and urban space in their art. Peri moved to England in 1933 for political reasons after his wife, Mary Macnaghten, the granddaughter of social reformer Charles Booth (1840-1916), was arrested in possession of Communist propaganda.\n\nIn July 1938, Peri had a solo exhibition called London Life in Concrete, which featured the concrete sculpture Rush Hour. At the time, he was fairly unknown in Britain, only taking on the name Peter Peri after becoming a British citizen the following year. Rush Hour depicts a crowd boarding an overcrowded double-decker London bus – a typical scene during London’s rush hour. Peri combined realism and abstraction by producing an everyday scene in simplified rectangular shapes. He built up the picture by gradually layering different coloured wet concrete or terracotta. Rather than use a mould, Peri manipulated the malleable moist material into the required shapes with his hands.\n\nPeri aimed to represent ordinary people and appeal to the wider public. He became a key figure in politically engaged art and founded the Artists International Association. Peri was keen to convey the character and expressions of individuals and crowds, so he spent time observing everyday people on the streets of London. At a time when many people had to suppress their political beliefs, Peri wanted his artwork to serve as their voice.\n\nAlthough the above artworks span less than a century, they evidence the extensive range of art styles emerging during the 19th and 20th centuries. They also demonstrate the scope of art at Tate Britain. The gallery has also acquired older and newer paintings during the past two decades, some of which now hang on public display. By looking at all the artworks, Tate Britain provides a concise story of art from the time of Henry VIII (1491-1547) to artists still working today.\n\nTate Britain generally displays artworks connected with Britain, although this does not mean all the artists were British. In a way, the gallery also provides a history of the country. The United Kingdom has been a multicultural country for hundreds of years, and the artwork in Tate Britain’s collection sparks the question, what does it mean to be British?\n\nIf you would like to support my blog, become a Patreon from £5p/m or “buy me a coffee” for £3. Thank You!\n\nIt has been twenty years since a large display of Giacometti’s surrealist sculptures have been seen in the UK, however, the Tate Modern has reintroduced them to the public with their latest exhibition. Tracing Giacometti’s career and evidencing his interest with different materials, the gallery unveils his immediately recognisable, unique style of sculpture as well as portrait painting, some of which have never been seen before.\n\nAlberto Giacometti (1901-1966) was born in a small village in the Swiss Alps where he was surrounded by paintings produced by his post-impressionist artistic father. After a brief education at the École des Arts et Métiers in Geneva, Giacometti abandoned the taught naturalistic method of sculpture in favour of experimentation. His peculiar style developed further after temporarily joining the Surrealist movement in the early 1930s.\n\nIt was after the Second World War when Giacometti finally settled on the elongated style of figures seen in the Tate Modern’s exhibition. These fragile looking sculptures suggest existentially tragedy with their emaciated appearance. This may have been influenced by Giacometti’s friendship with the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre.\n\nOn entering room one of the exhibition, visitors are subjected to gruesome-looking heads shaped out of clay and plaster – Giacometti’s preferred material. It is obvious from the unevenness of the sculptures that they have been moulded by hand, the pressures of the fingertips evident on the facial features. Although the subject matter is plain to see, the roughness of the texture gives the outcomes a more abstract feel. The proportions of skull and physiognomy are not aligned, resulting in a ghoulish appearance.\n\nThe human body remains Giacometti’s main focus throughout his life, moving on from the head to include the rest of the skeletal structure. His full body sculptures give off a sense of unease with their rawness and frailty. Apart from the period when Giacometti worked in miniature, his human depictions are extremely out of proportion. Often the legs are twice the length of the body, and the arms dangle down, muscle-less in an awkward fashion. The statues are painfully thin and inhuman, looking as though, were they not cast in bronze, they could easily snap in half.\n\nGiacometti restricted himself to a minimum of means, using his hands rather than tools to shape and sculpt his figures. He had found his style and stuck to it, putting great care and effort into the work he would be remembered for. Giacometti liked to depict the rawness of reality rather than the ideals of the subconscious mind. As a result, his work is chilling and more likely to leave people cold or nauseated instead of appreciative and awed.\n\nAlthough Giacometti’s skeletal figures may not be all that appealing, he was still a great influence and impressed many people. However, this was largely on account of his personality and devotion to his work, rather than his outcomes. Simone de Beauvoir, a French writer declared “Success, fame, money – Giacometti was indifferent to them all.”\n\nThere were occasions, however, when Giacometti did have to think about money as a means of living, particularly during the 1930s. During this decade, he created art with the intention to sell, focusing on decorative objects such as vases, jewellery and wall reliefs. As the Tate reveals in a cabinet in the third room of the exhibition, these commodities were dissimilar to his bronze sculptures, but still had Giacometti’s unique touch. His gritty, hand-rendered style meant each object was unique, yet, unfortunately, not particularly attractive. However, they must have appealed to someone since they were featured in both Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar magazine.\n\nDespite the fact that sculpture was Giacometti’s primary technique, he also enjoyed painting. Painting was a significant part of his early life, but after moving to Paris, sculpture predominated all else. It was not until the conclusion of the Second World War that Giacometti made a welcome return to the paintbrush and easel. The final rooms of the exhibition display the portraits he produced in this latter period.\n\nUnlike other artists, Giacometti was not interested in painting well-known people or taking commissions. Instead, he preferred to have his mother and brother sit for him, or close friends and acquaintances.\n\nIn the same way as his sculptures, Giacometti’s portraits feel raw and unfinished. His artistic style is so unique, it is easy to identify the paintings with his scultpures. The insubstatial, fragile representation of the human body is something which Giacometti portrays regardless of method or material.\n\nBy drawing or painting, Giacometti was able to focus more on facial features and small details, something which was impractical on his wraith-like sculptures. And, although he restricted himself to a small palette, he was free to add touches of colour to his artworks.\n\nUnlike the sculpted figures, it is possible to recognised the sitter (if you know who they are to begin with) represented on the canvas. They are also far more interesting to study. Expressive line work and range of tone add together to reveal a whole host of components to scrutinize.\n\nThe paintings, although somewhat abstract, are apprecibly more pleasant to view. Spectators are not subjected to, or repulsed by the nauseatingly skeletal framework of the figurines. Regrettably, there are a significant lack of these illustrations on display – the scultpure taking precedence.\n\nThe Tate Modern has done well to create a timeline of Alberto Giacometti’s life, from the beginning of his career until his death at the age of 65. Rather than detailing the works on display, the Tate has provided written information about different time periods and the effects the events within them had on his artistic developments.\n\nUnfortunately, Giacometti’s distinctive techniques will not appeal to everyone; there is no beauty to be found, only intrigue at most. Unless you have a peculiar fascination with obscure scultpure, it is probably not worth paying the entry fee (unless you are a member, in which case you get in for free). This thus poses the question, how long will it be until Giacometti is forgetten about altogether?"
