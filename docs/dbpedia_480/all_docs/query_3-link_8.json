        "meta_description": "Widely acclaimed as one of the most important artists of the 20th century, Giacometti reasserted the validity of the figure and figural representation at a time when abstract art had become dominant in the international art world. His works also became associated with existentialism, a philosophy that questions the nature of the human condition. To many, Giacometti’s emaciated figures—pervaded by feelings of alienation, fear, insignificance, and uncertainty—embodied the psychological complexities of the Cold War era that followed in the wake of World War II. Stripped to essentials, compressed and flattened as if eroded by air, these fragile beings presented themselves as expressions of a deep crisis facing art and humanity.",
