        "text": "PARIS — In December 1926, the young Alberto Giacometti moved into a small rented studio at 46, rue Hippolyte-Maindron, in the 14th Arrondissement of Paris. In that tiny ground-floor space, less than 300 square feet, poorly lit and for decades without running water, he produced masterpieces of modern art.\n\nAfter Giacometti died at age 64 in 1966, his studio was repossessed by the landlord, but not before Annette, his wife, had removed all of its contents including the studio’s paint- and plaster-splattered walls.\n\nNow, about 52 years after the death of the artist, that studio is getting a permanent new home.\n\nWhen the Giacometti Institute opens its doors on June 21, the reconstituted atelier will be the centerpiece of the site’s exhibition space, which the Fondation Alberto et Annette Giacometti plans to use as a vitrine for its collection of the artist’s works.\n\n“The opening of the Giacometti Institute will be a milestone and a moving moment for us at the foundation,” said Catherine Grenier, its director, in an interview in Paris. “It will be the first time the public will see the studio with its original walls and some of the last pieces Giacometti was working on just before he died.”\n\nThis year is one of renewed interest in the artist’s talent and contributions, coming on the heels of a major Giacometti retrospective last summer at the Tate Modern in London. Through Sept. 2 at Fondation Beyeler in Basel, Switzerland, a major exhibition titled “Bacon-Giacometti” is drawing a parallel between the artist and the Irish painter Francis Bacon, two giants of the art market.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
