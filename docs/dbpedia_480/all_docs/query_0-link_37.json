        "text": "Alberto Giacometti (1901-1966) was a Swiss sculptor, painter, draughtsman, and printmaker. He is considered one of the most important artists of the 20th century. Giacometti’s work is characterized by its elongated, attenuated figures, which have been interpreted as expressions of existential angst and alienation.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nGiacometti was born in Borgonovo, Switzerland, in 1901. His father, Giovanni Giacometti, was a painter, and his mother, Annetta Giacometti-Stampa, was a member of a wealthy family from Stampa. Giacometti studied art in Geneva and Paris, and he was influenced by the Cubist and Surrealist movements.\n\nCubism and Surrealism\n\nIn the early 1920s, Giacometti moved to Paris, where he became involved with the Cubist movement. He was particularly influenced by the work of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Giacometti’s Cubist sculptures are characterized by their geometric forms and their fragmented figures.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Giacometti became involved with the Surrealist movement. He was influenced by the work of André Breton and Salvador Dalí. Giacometti’s Surrealist sculptures are characterized by their dreamlike imagery and their use of automatic drawing.\n\nMature Work and Style\n\nIn the 1930s, Giacometti began to experiment with a more realistic style. He created a number of sculptures of human figures that are characterized by their elongated, attenuated forms. These figures have been interpreted as expressions of existential angst and alienation.\n\nGiacometti’s work from the 1940s and 1950s is his most celebrated. During this period, he created a number of his most famous sculptures, including « The Walking Man » (1947), « The City of Women » (1950), and « Four Women on a Base » (1950). These sculptures are characterized by their elongated, attenuated figures and their sense of isolation and despair.\n\nFamous Works\n\nSome of Giacometti’s most famous works include:\n\nThe Walking Man (1947)\n\nThe City of Women (1950)\n\nFour Women on a Base (1950)\n\nGrande Femme I (1960)\n\nChariot (1950)\n\nValue of Giacometti’s Art\n\nGiacometti’s art is highly sought-after by collectors, and his sculptures and paintings have sold for millions of dollars at auction. In 2015, his sculpture « L’Homme au doigt » sold for $141.3 million at Christie’s auction house in New York City, making it the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nGiacometti was a notoriously difficult artist to work with. He was often late for appointments, and he would frequently change his mind about the direction of his work. He was also a heavy smoker and drinker, and he had a number of health problems throughout his life.\n\nGiacometti was married to Annette Arm in 1949. They had no children.\n\nDeath and Legacy\n\nGiacometti died in Coire, Switzerland, in 1966. He was 64 years old.\n\nGiacometti’s work is considered to be some of the most important and influential art of the 20th century. His sculptures and paintings are on display in major museums around the world.\n\nAnecdotes\n\nGiacometti was once asked why he made his figures so elongated. He replied, « Because they are afraid. »\n\nGiacometti was also known for his sense of humor. Once, when a critic asked him why his sculptures were so expensive, he replied, « Because they are so small. »\n\nDespite his fame, Giacometti remained famously modest and reserved. Legend has it that when a friend visited his studio and complimented him on his sculptures, Giacometti replied, « I don’t know why you bother. They’re all rubbish. »\n\nAlberto Giacometti was a complex and enigmatic artist who created some of the most important and influential art of the 20th century. His work is characterized by its elongated, attenuated figures"
