        "text": "Today we analyzed the surrealism gallery at the Tate Modern. Surrealism is one of my favorite topics we have covered so far. The concept of the use of dream interpretations into artwork is really interesting to me. I have always been a fan of Dali since we briefly touched upon him in my Spanish class freshman year. The gallery today was a good experience.\n\nThe surrealist movement began in 1924, around the time of post World War One depression. Because many of its followers were associated with the left party and with the followers of the dada movement, the surrealist movement was affiliated with the Communist Party for some time.\n\nAndre Breton was one of the leading figures of surrealism. He was strongly influenced by the theories of the unconscious and dream world of Sigmund Freud (the founder of psychoanalysis) (Surrealism). Breton kick started the surrealist movement in Paris 1924 with His Manifesto of Surrealism (notes). His aim, and the aim of surrealism, was to “reveal the unconscious and reconcile it with rational life” (Surrealism). In this manifesto, Breton defined surrealism as “Pure psychic automatism the dictation of thought in the absence of all control exercised by reason and outside all moral or aesthetic concerns.” Many early surrealist works were often created by the artist simply writing down every thought that came to mind and expressing it without order or reason.\n\n“The word surrealism was coined in Paris in 1917 by writer Guillaume Apollinaire” (Bradley). The surrealist style can never be simply defined as it takes many different forms. The artists of the movement shared common aims, themes, and subject matter, but all the works were very different (Bradley). “Surrealism sought communication with the irrational and the illogical, deliberately disorientating and reorienting the conscious by means of the unconscious” (Bradley).\n\n“Surrealism is not a style, It is a cry of a mind turning back on itself”\n\n-Antonin Artaud,1924\n\nThe two main kinds of surrealist art is automatic and oneiric, or “dream like.” Automatism is similar to the theory of free association by Freud. Free association was the method used to explore the unconscious. It consisted of allowing the patient to explore its own issues and resolutions by exploring all possible sources of his or her troubles. The aim was to bring the unconscious thoughts to the subconscious and release suppressed emotions or feelings. The patient essentially talks of whatever came to their mind and tried to make sense of it. This method can be seen in surrealist art, as some paintings are comprised of a number of unrelated objects compiled together into a single composition. Oneiric surrealism on the other hand was more central to Freud’s famous book The Interpretation of Dreams. This approach believed that dreams were workings of the unconscious and had a greater deeper meaning.\n\nAutomatic Surrealism\n\nMax Ernst 1890-1976\n\nThe first form of visual automatism was done by Max Ernst. It was a collage of images from magazines, product catalogues, book illustrations, advertisements, and other sources to create a strange “new reality” (Automatism). Ernst was a German painter, sculptor, and poet. He was also involved with the dada movement. He was inspired by old wooden floors where, “the grain of the planks had been accentuated by many years of scrubbing” (frottage). He discovered the technique of frottage, which is somewhat reminiscent of impasto painting. It is “an automated method of creative production that involves creating a rubbing of a textured surface using a pencil or other drawing material” (Frottage). Frottage coupled with the use of a wide range of texturized surfaces led to a whole other technique of painting, known as grattage. These methods of painting brought a different aspect to the painting. It made the painting have a deeper meaning and nearly gave it a dual meaning. We were meant to look at his “The Entire City 1934″ but the work was not on display in the Tate Modern. However I looked it up and Ernst’s technique of frottage and grottage can clearly be seen. It appears almost as if the colorful cities buildings in the distance are only visible due to the layer of dark blackish paint being scraped off. This painting is somewhat similar to abstract art of the previous time period as it has similar bright colors with a cooler tone, is geometric, and very simple. It is too bad the gallery did not have this early automatic surrealist piece.\n\nJean Arp 1886-1966\n\nUnfortunately, Arp’s work also could not be found in the gallery. Arp was one of the founding members of the dada movement in 1916 and soon after moved to Paris to work on with the surrealist movement (‘Sculpture’). His piece According to the Laws of Chance was not found in the gallery. After looking it up, it appears that it is a painting of a whitish grey background with small black splotches scattered throughout. It looks very random and sporadic. It was his attempt to inspire “chance within artistic production” (‘According’).\n\nOneiric (dream like) Surrealist Art\n\nAlberto Giacometti 1901-1966\n\nSimilar to many other surrealist artists, Giacometti began in Switzerland and moved to Paris to take part in the surrealist movement in 1930. Before joining the surrealist movement, Giacometti had a period of “intense restlessness” where he experimented heavily with different teniqes and materials, such as “polychrome sculpture, cages, erotic kinetic objects, near-abstraction and other styles” (Alberto). He had a characteristic style of his sculptures to make them very tall and thin (Alberto).\n\nWalking Woman 1932-1933\n\nThis sculpture is of an oneiric woman in the process of taking a step. All of its limbs are very elongated and un-lifelike. The arms are cut off and there is no head or neck on the body’s rounded shoulders. The breasts of the figure are very defined and probably one of the most notable aspects of the sculpture. Like many other surrealists of the time, Giacometti portrayed many of the sexual ideas and desires that Freud expressed in his recent writings of the times. The figure is not very detailed, is composed of smooth texture throughout, and is very straight. At first look, the sculpture looks simple. Our initial response was that we liked it. The sculpture is aesthetically pleasing. It is all a single, dark color and very smooth. The eye gets drawn from the breasts down the torso to the legs to the feet mid step. The rounded top of the figure brings the eyes back down the piece once they are at the shoulders. It nearly seems like a flat image from face on but becomes 3D upon looking at it in different angles. It is almost ironic that the figure is meant to represent a walking woman, for the figure is barely mid step in a very small, short stride. Perhaps this is because it is meant to be portrayed walking “air like” as if in a dream. The setting, in a large room within the Tate Modern, allows for a 360 view of the sculpture, which is essential to understanding it. It is up to the spectator to interpret this image and its meaning. This figure is less figurative than other surrealist works. It is instead more conceptual; the meaning is up for interpretation to the spectator. This work was interesting to look at.\n\nMax Ernst\n\nErnst is also known for some oneiric surrealist pieces.\n\nCelebes\n\nThis painting’s title comes from a childish German rhyme, “The elephant from lebes has sticky, yellow, bottom grease” (Max). This image somewhat portrays this image. The painting is composed of a big, round, circle figure in the center with a long hose coming out of the center only to be taken back in and eaten up by the head of the figure. The figure somewhat resembles a mix between an ox and an elephant, which is where the elephant rhyme reference may have came from. The original shape and intent of this painting was based off of a photograph of a Suanese corn bin from the past. Ernst copied this shape of the image but made the innocent machine into a “sinister mechanical monster” (Max). In the time of post World War depression and the age of industrial advancements, many people were weary about the advent of new machines. They were taking away a number of jobs and creating a number of new problems throughout society. Ernst portrays this through this painting by showing the machine as an angry looking creature intending to destroy whatever is put into it. The dark and dreary background also adds to this aspect. There are a number of items juxtaposed in this painting. On top of the circular machine, there are multiple colorful shapes and parts. High in the sky, there are flying sharks and fish. There is an odd looking metal tree along the right of the image along with a headless, topless woman posing in the bottom right. The combination of these random objects was intended to create new realities. The imagery of portraying a dream like scene was a common physiological process of dealing with dreams; free association.\n\nThe aesthetic properties of the painting are impressive. Composed of dark colors and tones, the painting has an overall sad ad mysterious tone. The circular form of the subject brings the eye all around the painting and to the many different details it contains. The brush strokes make the subject look matte. The clouds in the background have a lot of texture. The painting is has a lot going on to look at.\n\nSalvador Dali\n\n“Only after you have mastered the techniques of the masters can you start your own style” -Dali\n\nDali is one of my favorite surrealist artists. We have learned about him in my Spanish classes in high school. He is one of the most widely recognized artists in the world (Salvador Dali bio). What I have known him best for is “The Persistence of Memory,” the iconic image of melting clocks down the side of a trench in a desert.\n\nBorn in Spain, Dali moved to Paris in e 1920s to work with artists like Picasso, Magritte, and Miro, which led to his early surrealist works (Salvador Dali bio). In 1934, his political views became too involved in his artwork, and the surrealist ranks expelled him. This was ironic was Dali continued to consider himself a surreal artist regardless. “The only difference between myself and other surreal artists is that I am a surrealist” (Salvador Dali bio). His name thus became synonymous with surrealism (Salvador Dali bio). He often took part in surrealist movements that angered critiques, who were used to perfect artwork of Picasso (Salvador Dali bio). Regardless, his artwork continues to be treasured as some of the most important surreal work of the period.\n\nMetamorphosis of Narcissus 1937\n\nThis was one of my favorite paintings of the gallery. There is so much to look at and interpret. At first glance, the painting looks like a pile of rocks suspiciously stacked on top of one another on a riverbank in front of a city. It looks like there is a checkerboard behind one of the figures in the background. In the center of the checkerboard, someone is standing up on a red box, facing the mountains. Upon looking at the painting longer, it becomes visible that the two figures are more than just rocks. The image on the left is a human figure hunched over. The figure on the right is a hand with set of fingers carefully holding an egg. One side of the painting is way more bright, light, and happy than the other. The sky on the right side is very blue and hopeful while the left side’s sky is dark and drearier. One seems to show life or rebirth with a flower coming out of the right figure’s hand. In the center of the two different aspects of the painting is a crowd of other similarly shaped people walking about. There is an extremely skinny dog sulking in the lower right, eating some type of meat. All of these symbols in the painting were carefully planned and plotted by Dali to portray some dream like scenario and tell a story.\n\nThis painting is an interpretation of the Greek myth of Narcissus (Salvador Dali Metamorphosis). Narcissus was a young boy who was obsessed with himself and his beauty. He was cursed and fell in love with his reflection in a pool. He eventually died of frustration of being unable to embrace or love his own reflection (Salvador Dali Metamorphosis). The flower on the right figure’s head represents the flower that the gods immortalized Narcissus as, the narcissus (daffodil) flower. The flower sprouting from the egg symbolizes immortal beauty. Although Narcissus no longer lived to love himself, his beauty and vanity will live on forever through the lovely flower. The man in the background is meant to symbolize Narcissus before the transformation (Salvador Dali Metamorphosis).\n\nThe use of double images” came from Dali’s interest in hallucinations and delusion (Salvador Dali Metamorphosis). He wrote a poem along with this painting to further explain the work. The poem talks of the metamorphosis of the Narcissus and his flower/rebirth.\n\nI am a big fan of Dali’s work.\n\nMovie Notes:\n\nDali liked to paint impossible worlds in a realest way. Growing up on the Northern coast of Spain, the sky, sea, and rocks inspired his early works and can be seen in a lot of his pieces. By age 15, it was evident Dali had natural talent in his work, as seen through his impressive early paintings.\n\nHis rough childhood is also reflected in his later work. His mother died at a young age and he frequently fought with his father. He was also expelled from school for insulting his teachers. In his 20s, he moved to Paris to take part in the Surrealist movement. Little did he know this change would change his life.\n\nDali soon completely involved himself in the Surreal movement. He put all of his fears, desires, obsessions, and anxieties onto the canvas. He used this means of expression to “release his emotions without censoring”. He wanted to explore the landscape of the uncensored mind.\n\nMany references to Freud and his theories can be seen in his work. They met in real life and discussed their ideas.\n\nEdward James was a famous commissioner of Dali. He was a millionaire patron who took on Dali’s ideas and designs. Lots of his house is furnished by much of his work.\n\nDali is known for combining two unrelated distant things in much of his art. He has since had a huge influence on interior design. He emphasized the notion that anything is possible. He is considered the trail-blazer for Andy Warhol. His avant-garde work influenced today’s fashion and contemporary works.\n\nJoan Miro 1893-1983\n\nPainting 1827\n\nGiorgio de Chirico\n\nThe Uncertainty of the Poet (1913)\n\nFrancis Picabia\n\nOtaiti (1930)\n\nBibliography\n\n“Alberto Giacometti, ‘Man Pointing’ 1947.” Tate.
