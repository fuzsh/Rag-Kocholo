        "text": "Born in Switzerland in 1901, Alberto Giacometti is one of the greatest sculptors and painters of the 20th century. The son of a successful post-Impressionist painter, Giacometti studied painting and sculpture in Geneva, before moving to Paris in 1922 where he lived and worked until his death in 1966.\n\nGiacometti's early works reflect the influence of African, Oceanic art and Cubism. During the 1930s he came into contact with the Paris avant-garde and became a distinguished figure in the Surrealist group, \"the only movement where something interesting was happening\" he said at the time. His first solo exhibition in 1932 at Galerie Pierre Colle confirmed his position as Surrealism's most important sculptor.\n\nMany of his works from this period have a nightmarish quality, with evocations of sexual violence and physical confinement. Woman Having Her Throat Cut and Hands Holding The Void can currently be seen in Tate Modern's Surrealism: Desire Unbound exhibition.\n\nIn 1935 Giacometti grew dissatisfied with the purely imaginary aspect of Surrealism, and began working from nature, using his brother as a model. During the Occupation he moved to Switzerland and returned to working from memory, but his sculptures, of heads and standing figures, became smaller and smaller. He destroyed most of his work from this period, and when he left Geneva after the war his total output fitted into a few matchboxes.\n\nBack in Paris, Giacometti developed a close friendship with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, and became involved with the Existentialist movement. It is during this period that he developed his characteristic style, producing the tall, emaciated figures for which he is best known.\n\nGiacometti's haunting sculptures have been described as a perfect metaphor of existential man: solitary stripped figures inhabiting a vast and meaningless silent void. Solitary figures are imprisoned on large bases, and physical decay is represented though the sculptures' gouged surfaces. The lack of eye contact between figures even in groups emphasises man's isolation.\n\nIn the 1950s the artist turned with renewed interest to painting and printmaking. His portraits are nearly always frontal views of single immobile figures. Tireless in his efforts to define the human figure, he drew and sculpted the subjects close to him again and again. His brother Diego and his wife Annette, his most constant models, are represented in many works.\n\nThe Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, Norwich, is celebrating the artist's centenary with the exhibition, Alberto Giacometti in Postwar Paris. Over 100 of his rarely-seen drawings, paintings and sculptures, focusing on his life in Paris between 1945 and 1965 are on display. You can also see intimate personal portraits of friends and acquaintances such as Henri Matisse, Simone de Beauvoir and George Braque."
