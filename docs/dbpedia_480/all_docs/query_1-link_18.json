His sculptures shaped the surreal approach incorporating nuanced themes of Freudian psychoanalysis and his obsessions with trauma and anxiety coupled with alienation rendered his works in an entirely otherworldly representation. Alberto Giacometti’s later works shaped his endeavors in the Expressionist approach. His works in figurations were also unique; he rendered the pieces with distinctive approach, distorting the paintings to shape them in his signature representations. Some of the sculptural works he created had the influence of the primitive art yet they at times resembled toys or games as well as architectural models. 1930s onwards Alberto Giacometti abandoned abstraction and surrealism to turn towards Figuration and he shaped some of the groundbreaking ideas of Expressionism.
