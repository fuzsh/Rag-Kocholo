        "text": "Sfakia, will say country of the gorges… However, some claim that the name came from the oleanders, which are locally called Sfakia, while there is also the version that originally the name was Sfikia until it became Sfakia. In any case, Sfakia is the homeland of the Sfakians, who did not allow any Turkish or German conqueror to invade this rocky and imposing place. The islands that stand out in the background when the atmosphere is clear, are Gavdos and Gavdopoula, the southernmost islands of Europe. The most beautiful way to approach Sfakia is to cross the famous gorge of Samaria. At a distance of 42 km from Chania and 3 km from Omalos, in Xyloskalo, the descent to the gorge begins. After a 5 or 6 hour hike, as we leave behind the gorge, we meet the village of Agia Roumeli which is bathed by the Libyan Sea. From there small boats transport the hikers to Chora of Sfakion, after a short stop in the picturesque village of Loutro. Another way to approach Sfakion is through Vrisi which is 33 km away from Chania. Heading south and following the uphill route that leads us to the valley of Krapi and then to the plateau of Askifos, we meet the village of Kallikratis which is located at an altitude of 750 meters from the sea. We return to the main road to Chora Sfakion and after 3 km we enter the gorge of Imvros. Just before we reach Chora we can bypass left for Komitades, Vouva, Nomikiana, Patsiano, Kapsodasos and Skaloti, as the area is rich in gorges. Especially outside the Imvriotikos gorge, those of Agios Nektarios and Kallikrates, which are located near the homonymous villages, are of interest. In addition, at a very short distance from Patsianos is the famous Frangokastelo, built in 1371 by the Venetians and is one of the most mythical places in Crete. Anyone who visits it at dawn on the 17th to the 18th of May can see on the walls of the castle the famous “Drosoulites”, according to popular tradition, but also enjoy the wonderful beaches of Frangokastelo and Orthi Ammos. Finally, arriving in Chora ton Sfakion, it is worth visiting the coastal caves, emphasizing that of Daskalogiannis that was used in the Revolution of 1770 as a mint but also to ascend to Anopolis with the wonderful view, to head to Aradena with the beautiful homonymous gorge or go to Agios Ioannis at the foot of the White Mountains. Chora Sfakion Historic village, 74 km SE of Chania, with 351 inhabitants, is built in a rocky, barren area, inaccessible by land and sea. Unique trees, a few pines at the entrance of the village and tamarisk trees. Except for the small port in front of the settlement and two beaches to the west, all the coasts are rocky and steep. The village has a few shops, while refueling can be done in the city. There are ATMs, gas station, post office and OTE office, from where international calls can be made. The village has a pharmacy, but it does not have a doctor or a dentist. There are no port authorities in the port, but there is a police station. Several hotels and rooms to let and taverns are located in the village, while in terms of transportation, taxis and a daily bus to Chania are available. A mooring for small boats is located next to the pier in the new port. The old port is only suitable for small boats and is usually full. Additional boats leave Chora Sfakion for Loutro, Paliochora and Gavdos. In summer there are many itineraries daily, but in winter it is much rarer. Inside the small port there is a beach, but you better prefer the west beach at the exit of Chora Sfakion. Another option is the beach of Ilinga, about 1 km west of Sfakia. There are rooms for rent and a tavern, while on the coast you will discover many sea caves. In the village are preserved many elements of traditional architecture, single-storey or two-storey houses with small doors and windows, closed courtyards with wells and ovens, narrow cobbled streets. During the summer months, it is always crowded, because most tourists pass through here, returning from the Samaria Gorge. About 14 km A from Chora is Frangokastello, in a flat, dry area. Its castle is impressive and its beaches are among the best in Crete. West of Chora, another tourist settlement, Loutro (access only from the sea 20 ‘by boat).\n\nAgia Roumeli is located in the area of ​​Sfakia on the south coast of the Prefecture of Chania, between Chora Sfakion and Paliochora. Agia Roumeli became famous, because here ends the path from the gorge of Samaria. The thousands of visitors who pass Samaria every summer, end up here to take the ferry that will take them to Loutro and Chora Sfakion (east) or to Sougia and Paliochora (west). The White Mountains with their high peaks and deep gorges keep Agia Roumeli isolated in their arms. The village is small, no road reaches here and all transport is carried out by boats. It is worth mentioning that the first photovoltaic station installed in Greece, operated from 1982 to 1989, in Agia Roumeli. How to get to Agia Roumeli 1. Walk through the gorge of Samaria. If you have the opportunity to stay in Agia Roumeli, then enter the gorge at noon and you will have the opportunity to walk it almost alone, since all the groups arrive early in the morning. You will reach Agia Roumeli after about 6 hours, the time when the last hikers will leave. 2. By boat from Chora Sfakion, which makes several itineraries daily in summer. 3. By boat from Paliochora and Sougia, which arrives in the morning and returns in the afternoon, giving you the opportunity for a beautiful day trip to Agia Roumeli and the lower part of the gorge of Samaria. You should know that in Agia Roumeli there is no safe port, but only a small pier, which makes it difficult to moor the ships of the line. The result is that the itineraries are interrupted when the weather is bad in the area, so there is a case to be excluded in Agia Roumeli for 1-2 days.\n\nThe name Agia Roumeli – Agia Roumeli in history Agia Roumeli today lives from tourism, and specifically from the 350,000 visitors who pass the gorge of Samaria. It is a great relief for the one who has walked for a few hours in the gorge of Samaria, to cross the last 2 kilometers after leaving the national park and to see the first houses of Agia Roumeli. A few meters below you will find several taverns chanting their delicious food, greek salad and frozen orange juice. Agia Roumeli has little charm for the visitor at these moments. Everyone is in a hurry to get on the boat and return to their home or hotel. The first stop is the ticket purchase for Loutro and Chora Sfakion to the east, or Sougia and Paliochora to the west. To reiterate at this point, that the most convenient option to cross Samaria is to stay in Sougia, take the morning bus that will take you to Omalos, walk Samaria and take the afternoon boat to Sougia. This way, your hassle will be minimal. Once you have secured the return ticket, and you have enough time until the boat arrives, then you can enjoy the food in one of the many taverns, cool off with a juice, coffee, soft drink or an ice cold beer, or dive in the crystal clear waters. on the beach of Agia Roumeli.\n\nBut if you are not in a hurry to return to your home or hotel, it is a good idea to stay at least one night in Agia Roumeli and enjoy the beauty of the place, when the noise from the crowds of tourists will be gone with the last ferry. It will be late in the afternoon, the colors of the sunset will color the sky, and you will enjoy the serenity and beauty of the large pebble beach. Later, at night, you will enjoy delicious Sfakian recipes, good wine and if you are lucky, the company of the Sfakian black-clad restaurant, who will travel you to the secrets of his place through his stories. The people of Agia Roumeli are proud and talkative, but the love for their place, its gorges and mountains, Madares as they call the White Mountains, makes their eyes shine when they talk about it. If after the meal you are not tired of the day, go for a short walk on the pier or on the beach, sit down and turn your eyes to the sky. If it is a moonless night, thousands of stars will shine in the firmament and the galaxy will look like a bright cloud, a bright boulevard crossing the black void. The magic of the night sky on the south coast of Crete is something you have to experience to feel it.\n\nThe next morning, Agia Roumeli unfolds even more options in front of you, like another Circe trying to enchant you with her beauty and keep you close to her.\n\n* Enjoy a rich breakfast with Sfakian cheese and thyme honey, from the White Mountains.\n\n* Enjoy the blue waters on the beach. The beach will be almost empty until noon when the first hikers will start arriving from the gorge of Samaria\n\n* Climb the hill above Agia Roumeli to reach the ruined Turkish castle and see from above the exit of the gorge, the houses of Agia Roumeli, the beaches east and west, and of course the endless blue of the Libyan Sea that is interrupted only by the islands of Gavdos and Gavdopoula, the southernmost borders of Europe. The course will take half an hour, and the trail does not present any particular difficulty.\n\n* An hour and a half after the Turkish castle, there are the ruins of a second castle. The path is constantly uphill and the castle is not preserved in good condition.\n\n* Walk east to the pine beach and the Byzantine church of Agios Pavlos. It was so named in memory of the visit of the Apostle Paul. The route is 3.5 km. There is no water on the route, so take as much as you need with you. The beach will probably be empty and early in the morning the aroma of pine trees, fills the atmosphere.\n\n* If you continue on the coastal path, 3 km below is Marmara beach, where there is a tavern. Another three kilometers below is the unique and beautiful Bath. The path continues for another 6 km, to Glyka Nera beach and Chora Sfakion. Those who want to have an idea of ​​the time they will need, let’s calculate 4 hours to Marmara, 5 hours to Loutro and 7 hours to Chora Sfakion, always starting from Agia Roumeli.\n\n* For the good hikers who are not afraid of heights and have tried their hand at long marches, there is the coastal path from Agia Roumeli to Sougia.
