        "text": "Classical Cretan states are known to have had an unusual and distinctive character, contrasting markedly with that of their central Greek peers. Yet the histories of the latter have tended to dominate our understanding of the polis form. The factors contributing to this difference, and to the whole process of state emergence in Early Iron Age – Archaic Crete, have not been much analysed, restricting our understanding of the origins of the earliest consensualist political structures. Some scholars have explained Cretan divergence in terms of a particularly strong ›continuity‹ in the island&#39;s social and cultural frameworks from the Bronze Age into the state formation period. Others have seen immigration into Crete during the latter period as a major constructive influence (frequently citing some aspects of Archaic-Classical texts in support of their arguments). The EIA – A archaeological record should be our main source of information in testing these models, but has been under-in...\n\nThomas Spratt (1811—88) was a Royal Naval hydrographical officer who travelled to Crete to survey the Mediterranean waters around the island but who also studied the Cretan archaeology in an attempt, amongst many other things, to identify the legendary ‘labyrinth’ of Theseus and the Minotaur. This lecture looks at some of Spratt’s discoveries on the island before Sir Arthur Evans’s groundbreaking discoveries of the Minoan civilization."
