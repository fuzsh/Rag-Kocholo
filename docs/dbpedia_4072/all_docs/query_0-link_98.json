        "text": "If you are interested in a travelling experience that goes beyond the basic travel guide, Chania is the place where one can genuinely immerse into authentic Cretan life. There are so many remote rural villages that are kept intact and unspoiled by heavy touristic development; if there is any at all! In Chania, communities in the rural areas still cherish the production of quality food from their land, and at the same time they are eager to share their enthusiasm and knowledge with their guests. It is the perfect destination that combines the authenticity of the countryside with the open-hearted hospitality of the village communities, where guests and visitors are welcomed to try out agritourism activities and take part in every step of the production process. This engagement builds friendly relationships between locals and visitors only to be treated as members of their own families, at the end of the day.\n\nThe agricultural products of Chania are renowned all over Greece and abroad. From olives and olive oil, to delicious vegetables and fruits, to the exceptional local wines and the raki or tsikoudia spirit, the land of Chania is blessed; it is blessed to have the just the right climate, just the right ingredients and the just the right people to bring to life farm products of the highest quality.\n\nNo matter how familiar you are with agritourism activities, in Chania there is always something that fits your travel style and schedule. From picturesque mountain villages with great food, to wine tasting, you can easily find the activity that brings you closer to the Cretan countryside, and in touch with the genuine Cretan culture that is still very much alive.\n\nThe locals, even if they live in Chania city, rarely lose their connection with the village of their parents and grandparents. The return to the village is frequent and almost all ages engage with rural activities. Literally everyone in Chania can tell you vivid stories of farm life from their childhood, or stories about the plot of land they cultivate as a side income and a reason to stay in contact with their roots. Even in this modern age of arising e-commerce, the land and the quality of its products is very important for the local people, and they never lose a chance to share this with their guest. Just sit back and let them tell you their inspiring rural stories with a tsikoudia shot and some meze."
