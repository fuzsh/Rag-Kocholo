        "text": "Chapter #1\n\nFirst things first -- staying in Iraklion. I like Hotel Kronos if you can get a balcony w a sea view... it's right on the sea front, and walkable to the bus station. Reasonable rates. You can get a rental car delivered right there .. but DO get good directions for getting out of town! Iraklion has 1-way streets, very confusing... once u are on the highway heading west, no problem. When you return to Iraklion to get the daily 9:45 ferry to Santorini, u can arrange just to leave y our car in a certain lot by the ferry.\n\nNow, about this \"Base\" fantasy. People who talk about having one \"base\" in Greece usually got the idea from visiting Northern Italy. Rent a place in Tuscany or Umbria, and every day drive 20 minutes in a different direction & have a new experience, N - S- E -W in 4 days, then back to \"base\" in half an hour & sleep in same bed.\n\nGreece is not Italy. In small islands of course, if you go 20 miles in ANY direction you drown. So you spend 4 days in one island and hop to another. That's why they call it island-hopping, not island basing.\n\nCrete is as big as a country, but also has its limitations as a \"base\" concept. Because of the major mountain ranges, you cannot go any direction you wish ... only down the valleys between mountain ranges. Thus you spend a lot of time getting there i.e., Chania to Paleochora and then you have to backtrack. You spend all your time in the car. this online map which I love (click & it gets huuuge) http://www.explorecrete.com/crete-maps/images/Crete-eot.png - has roads AND terrain & shows plainly what I mean.\n\nCertainly CHANIA itself is rewarding for 2-3 days to explore.. and you want to stay on the WEST side of Old Town near the wall -- the main \"lane\" (no-cars) is Theotokopoulos street, and it is absolutely LINED with small pensions that have what you call \"studio units\" w. small kitchenette or kitchen \"ell\" w sink/hotplate. ALL rooms have FRIDGES most also coffeemakers, small table & chairs. Just a few of the places along that street include Hotel Hera & Casa di Pietra (the 2 with the BEST location.. at end of street nearest the sea), then either on Theo or just off include Anemones Apts, Pension Nora, Iason Studios. Casa Veneta This terrific map https://www.hotelscombined.com/Place/Chania_1.htm?mapState=expanded%3D1 shows this cluster of small lodgings (6 -10 rooms) u are planning so far ahead no need to using an online agency, just look google their websites, look at their Trip Adv reviews, then contact 5-6 of them direct ... they'll be delighted because that means they don't have to pay an agency fee. This is hands-down the best area to stay in... there is free parking at a lot right by the seafront (look carefully, one lot also charges), then you roll your little bags up a gently ramped walkway to the foot of Theo. street, and there you are!!\n\nSure, enjoyable day trips: Akrotiri Peninsula , the ancient ruins of Aptera, Rethymnon, (mainly for the Fortezza its Old Town isn't up to Chania's). To see small villages enroute to Rethmymnon, jump off E-W Highway (on the map, Big Green Road marked E75) drive instead Old Road, in Red ... on this, one May we ran into \"traffic jams\" of herds of Goats & sheep meandering along. FOr more villages, head for VAMOS (see map)up a road near the sea, to Gavalohori, a very traditional town w. crafts. Then swim at a beach like Almirida or Khalives, & return to Chania. On yr drive West, detour inland at Panormos 5 - 8 Miles to Cave of Melidoni ... gorgeous stalactites, yet haunted -- in 1823 Turks suffocated over 300 civilians there ... a simple pile of stones erected at the time says \"never Forget\" ; poignant, unforgettable.\n\nHowever -- that's maybe 4-5 days, u have 10 ... time to Move Along! I've reached the word limit... so will continue in Chapter #2.\n\nCHAPTER #2\n\nKeep that Map open while considering options. In order not to simply retrace your drive, you'll want to go SOUTH, then get back NORTH=CENTRAL for your Ferry in HERAKLION (Iraklion). As Map shows, you can't just go Straight south to Paleochora or Sougia and then drive EAST because -- Guess what??? There is NO ROAD on South Coast, only Mountains & the mouth of Gorges. There are several options some more complicated than others:\n\n(1) DRIVE to PALEOCHORA -- (spend the Night) and take ferry(Ferries) EAST to HORA SFAKION ... u could spend a night there OR go East about 16 KM (10 miles), and stay at FRANGOKASTELLO. (I have a great hidden 11th C church on a hillside to steer u to) However, you then would have to drive back N along the rim of the IMBROS Gorge, and be on the Big Green North highway again (I would NOT recommend, driving from Hora Sfakion E along coast & up thru mountains to SPILI -- having done that ... the map does NOT convey the challenges of that road!) The other option ----\n\n(2) DRIVE E on RED ROAD, then down Rt 97 to SPILI ... a Good road, scenic, in a valley. Look up SPILI - its \"town square\" (really a triangle) has fab fountain, 20 lions' mouths, water from top of Mt. Ida -- crystalline and Delish!! If u got there by noon you could turn inland at Spili for the Western \"loop\" of the Amari Valley (google it), and then emerge At AG Galini. Continue to beach area of MATALA. Do NOT stay at crammed row of beach pensions... back about 1000 yards is Dimitris Villa https://www.matala.gr (they now call themselves Dimitris Resort Hotel but don't panic; it's still just 20 rooms, a pool a cafe & Dimitris & his adorable family). Lovely place, view of mountains, vine-covered patio. In May, Matala beach won't be overcrowded, if u are brave u can climb up to the famous caves on the cliffside overlooking. Stay here 2 nights, and one of the ays you can go see The Palace of Phaistos (Festos) and Ag Triada Villa... ruins NOT fancifully restored as Evans did Knossos. Then hit the road again, drive thru GORTIS (stop if you want -- a lotta tumbledown roman-era ruins), then on to WINE COUNTRY.\n\nIF you exit Red Road (97) near Dafnes, you're in the heart of Cretan's biggest vineyard area. This website tells about the best wineries to visit around there http://www.we-love-crete.com/dafnes.html Near Archanes this ancient Site Vathypetro is supposedly the oldest winepress ever discovered, 2500 yrs old?? http://www.minoancrete.com/vathypetro.htm There seem to be a lot of nice places to stay around Dafnes @ about â‚¬60-70 per night, such as Villa Daskalogianni ... or you could just ask at a Dafnes taverna owner, where is i good to stay around here... his uncle Kostas probably has a place .. you will still be off-season. It's close enough to Heraklion you could make that 9:45 am ferry & not have to stay in Heraklion 2x.\n\nSome great ideas above, lots of lovely places to visit.\n\nOR - you could stay half your time in Chania & half in 1 other place, perhaps a small village, or maybe the South coast. That way, not much packing & unpacking.\n\nFrom Chania there are many half-day & day trips you may like, some could include:\n\n- the 3 monasteries on Akrotiri (or the top 2 if you don't want to walk down to Katholiko, which is the best bit)\n\n- Pretty little beaches fairly near - eg Marathi, Tersanas - both have 1 good taverna, Stavros where Zorba's hill is in the film\n\n- Amazing beaches further afield - Elafonisi, Falasarna (& ancient port), Balos. You may well be able to swim by mid-May, depending on how hard this winter will be!\n\n- Lots of little villages in Apokoronas to drive round, stop for a stroll & a coffee - you can make a good circuit around places like Kalyves, Vamos, Gavalohori, Armenoi, Stylos or inland more through the higher villages on little roads, heading towards the White Mountains - to Fres, Melidoni, Pemonia, Tzitzifes & lots more. Some of the best local eateries are in these village tavernas.\n\n- Lots of old churches & monasteries to explore - places like Karydi monastery with it's 12 arch olive press, Agios Nikolaos in Samonas\n\n- A drive up Therisso gorge (small war resistance museum) could lead you on to Drakona & the now famous Dounias taverna\n\n- A day-trip to Hofa Sfakia on the South coast, & perhaps the ferry to Loutro for lunch\n\n- Ancient Aptera.\n\n- Polyrinnea\n\n= several museums & galleries in Chania\n\n-Day trips from Chania will ust be starting if you want a non-driving option\n\n- don't forget places like Nea Hora, the town beach, where you can watch life going on & eat fabulous fresh fish.\n\n-The sleepy little town of Kalyves, followed 5 mins later by the little beach village of Almyrida, then up the hill for 2 mins brings you to the old village of Plaka, with 3 tavernas (go to O Harokopos, it's the best!). This could be an option for a few days stay for you, there are many privately owned holiday villas in the area, some inexpensive in early season. Just another idea, without driving too far out of your way.\n\n& many more. Also, you'll want a couple of mornings to stroll around the old harbour & little lanes of Chania. & another at a street market, especially as you like food. Here you will find the freshest local produce in season, & the Chania residents out shopping. There are 3 market days in fairly easy reach of the old town.\n\nThe WWII museum is part of the Maritime Museum which is really interesting in itself. If interested in the history of the War in Crete, do visit the Commonwealth War Cemetery at Souda, overlooking the Bay where the Allied fleet was sunk. I think you will just miss the Rememberence ceremony held there every year that commemorates the Battle of Crete. The German war cemetery overlooking the airfield of Maleme is also very evocative. An excellent book is Crete, the Battle and the Resistence by Anthony Beevor.\n\nThe eastern part of the Island is also interesting; Spinalonga, a Venetian island fortress that was a leper colony up until the mid-1950's. Interesting displays about life in the colony and the history of the site. The Lasithi Plateau with its windmills, The sites on two small islands just off Mohlos, the archaeological sites of Gournia, Lato and Malia. Crete has almost too much to see!\n\nGoing back to Chania, which is a centre of the olive industry in Crete, a visit to Ano Vouves, to see what is claimed to be the oldest olive tree in existence, is worthwhile. The tree is estimated to be 3000-4000 years old and is still productive!\n\nOf course Chania's harbour is a great place to while away a few hours. Find a favourite cafe, sit and watch the world go by, wander past the pleasure and fishing boats, visit the latest exhibition at the art gallery in the mosque, walk out to the lighthouse.\n\nThe covered market is a mix of souvenir shops, seafood, cheese and butcher shops. If going for seafood get there early, they are usually sold out by late morning. The fish is so fresh it is still wriggling! For a special meal look at Tamam, a small restaurant in an old Turkish Bath. Good food and lots of atmosphere.\n\nRecommend the Rough Guide to Crete. Good information, maps etc."
