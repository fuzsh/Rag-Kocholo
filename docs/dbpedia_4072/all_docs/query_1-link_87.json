        "text": "Strabo Geography Book V Chapter 2, 4:\n\nAnd many have called also the tribes of Epirus \"Pelasgian,\" because in their opinion the Pelasgi extended their rule even as far as that. And, further, because many of the heroes were called \"Pelasgi\" by name, the people of later times have, from those heroes, applied the name to many of the tribes; for example, they have called the island of Lesbos \"Pelasgia,\" and Homer has called \"Pelasgi\" the people that were neighbours to those Cilicians who lived in the Troad... The following piece of Thucydides reflects the hostile skirmishes between Epirotes and the Greek world:\n\nThucydides, The Peloponnesian War 2.80.1:\n\nThe Hellenic troops with him consisted of the Ambraciots, Leucadians, and Anactorians, and the thousand Peloponnesians with whom he came; the barbarian of a thousand Chaonians, who, belonging to a nation that has no king, were led by Photius and Nicanor, the two members of the royal family to whom the chieftainship for that year had been confided. With the Chaonians came also some Thesprotians, like them without a king, [6] some Molossians and Atintanians led by Sabylinthus, the guardian of king Tharyps who was still a minor, and some Paravaeans, under their King Oroedus, accompanied by a thousand Orestians, subjects of King Antiochus and placed by him under the command of Oroedus. [7] There were also a thousand Macedonians sent by Perdiccas without the knowledge of the Athenians, but they arrived too late. Thus far, the Athenian historian distinguishes Epirotic tribes from Greeks, implying that Epirotes were non Greeks. The same author noticed that Epirotes received Greek from the nearby colony of Ambracia:\n\n. Under the pressure of misfortune many generations afterwards, they called in the Ambraciots, their neighbours on the Amphilochian border, to join their colony; and it was by this union with the Ambraciots that they learnt their present Hellenic speech, the rest of the Amphilochians being barbarians.\n\nStrabo the Geographer sees Gulf of Ambracia as the beginning of Greece, thus excluding all Epirus from Greece. His account relies on early observations made by sailors who traversed Adriatic and Ionian. Even the famous Ephorus is often cited by him. Then, beginning at the Ambracian Gulf, all the districts which, one after another, incline towards the east and stretch parallel to the Peloponnesus belong to Greece]... While ancient sailor left Epirus, he recognized immediately the Acarnanians Greeks: Next comes the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf. Although the mouth of this gulf is but slightly more than four stadia wide, the circumference is as much as three hundred stadia; and it has good harbours everywhere. That part of the country which is on the right as one sails in is inhabited by the Greek Acarnanians.\n\nAbsence of Mycenean culture in Epirus:\n\nSomething that must be seriously taken into consideration is the absence of Mycenean culture in Epirus. Even if the Myceneans were close to Proto-Greeks (though it's very suspicious), Epirus lie outside the sphere of such a culture.\n\nK. A. Wardle, \"Mycenaean Trade and Influence in Northern Greece,\" in C. Zerner, P. Zerner, and J. Winder (eds.), Wace and Blegen, Pottery as Evidence for Trade in the Aegean Bronze Age: 1939-1989 (Amsterdam 1993), p. 117: \"Neither Macedonia nor Epirus to the west were ever part of Mycenaean Greece\". Even the account (which has been attributed to Ps-Scylax) clearly separate Epirus from Greece:\n\nDIFFERENTISATING GREEK CENTER FROM EPIRUS:\n\n33. AMBRAKIA. And after Molottia, Ambrakia, a Hellenic city: and this is distant from sea 80 stades. And there is also upon the sea a fort and an enclosed harbor. From here Hellas begins to be continuous as far as Peneios river and Homolion, a city of Magnesian territory, which is beside the river. And the coastal voyage of Ambrakia is of 120 stades.\n\nPlutarch made no mention of the language spoken by the Epirotes, but according to him it was not Greek:\n\nOf the Thesprotians and Molossians after the great flood, the first king, according to some historians, was Phaethon, one of those who came into Epirus with Pelasgus. Others tell us that Deucalion and Pyrrha, having set up the worship of Jupiter at Dodona, settled there among the Molossians. In after time, Neoptolemus, Achilles's son, planting a colony, possessed these parts himself, and left a succession of kings, who, after him, was named Pyrrhidae, as he in his youth was called Pyrrhus, and of his legitimate children, one was born of Lanassa, daughter of Cleodaeus, Hyllus's son, had also that name. From him Achilles came to have divine honours in Epirus, under the name of Aspetus, in the language of the country.\n\nIt doesn't make any sense that Plutarch was invoking a Greek language in Epirus. He is surely referring to a language, completely unintelligible to the Greeks of his time. Of great importance is the mention of Pelasgians, who have been the very ancient people of that country. Therefore, Epirotes might be considered as Pelasgian's seeds.\n\nStrabo 11.14.12.\n\nMost northerly Greeks:\n\ná¼Î´ÎµÎ¹ Î¼á½²Î½ Î³á½°Ï Î±á½ÏÎ¿á¿Ï á¼ÏÎ¹Î¸Î­ÏÎ¿Ï ÎºÏÏÎ¼Î¿Ï ÏÎ¿Î¹Î¿ÏÏÎ¿Ï ÏÎ¹Î½ÏÏ, Î¿á¼± Î´á½² ÎÎµÏÏÎ±Î»Î¿á½¶ Î¼Î¬Î»Î¹ÏÏÎ± Î²Î±Î¸Ï ÏÏÎ¿Î»Î¿á¿¦Î½ÏÎµÏ, á½¡Ï Îµá¼°ÎºÏÏ, Î´Î¹á½° Ïá½¸ ÏÎ¬Î½ÏÏÎ½ Îµá¼¶Î½Î±Î¹ á¼Î»Î»Î®Î½ÏÎ½ Î²Î¿ÏÎµÎ¹Î¿ÏÎ¬ÏÎ¿Ï Ï ÎºÎ±á½¶ ÏÏ ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ¬ÏÎ¿Ï Ï Î½Î­Î¼ÎµÏÎ¸Î±Î¹ ÏÏÏÎ¿Ï Ï á¼ÏÎ¹ÏÎ·Î´ÎµÎ¹Î¿ÏÎ¬ÏÎ·Î½ ÏÎ±ÏÎ­ÏÏÎ¿Î½ÏÎ¿ Î¼Î¯Î¼Î·ÏÎ¹Î½ Ïá¿ Ïá¿¶Î½ á½ÏÎ¿ÎºÏÎ¹Ïá¿¶Î½ Î´Î¹Î±ÏÎºÎµÏ á¿ á¼Î½ ÏÎ¿á¿Ï á¼Î½Î±ÏÎ»Î¬ÏÎ¼Î±ÏÎ¹Î½Â·\n\nâThe Thessalians in particular wore long robes, probably because they of all the Greeks lived in the most northerly and coldest region\".\n\nBeginning of Greece: á¼ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¿Ï Î¼á½²Î½ Î¿á½Î½ á¼ÏÏá½´Î½ Îµá¼¶Î½Î±Î¹ Ïá¿Ï á¼Î»Î»Î¬Î´Î¿Ï Ïá½´Î½ á¼ÎºÎ±ÏÎ½Î±Î½Î¯Î±Î½ ÏÎ·Ïá½¶Î½ á¼Ïá½¸ Ïá¿¶Î½ á¼ÏÏÎµÏÎ¯ÏÎ½ Î¼ÎµÏá¿¶Î½Â· ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ·Î½ Î³á½°Ï ÏÏ Î½Î¬ÏÏÎµÎ¹Î½ ÏÏÏÏÎ·Î½ ÏÎ¿á¿Ï á¼¨ÏÎµÎ¹ÏÏÏÎ¹ÎºÎ¿á¿Ï á¼Î¸Î½ÎµÏÎ¹Î½.\n\nEphorus says that, if one begins with the western parts, Acarnania is the beginning of Greece; for, he adds, Acarnania is the first to border on the tribes of the Epeirotes\n\nNo difference between Epiriots and Illyrians:\n\nÎ¼ÎµÏá½° Î¼á½²Î½ Î¿á½Î½ ÏÎ¿á½ºÏ á¼¨ÏÎµÎ¹ÏÏÏÎ±Ï ÎºÎ±á½¶ ÏÎ¿á½ºÏ á¼¸Î»Î»Ï ÏÎ¹Î¿á½ºÏ Ïá¿¶Î½ á¼Î»Î»Î®Î½ÏÎ½ á¼ÎºÎ±ÏÎ½á¾¶Î½Î­Ï Îµá¼°ÏÎ¹ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Îá¼°ÏÏÎ»Î¿á½¶ ÎºÎ±á½¶ ÎÎ¿ÎºÏÎ¿á½¶ Î¿á¼± á½Î¶ÏÎ»Î±Î¹Â·\n\nAfter the Epeirotes and the Illyrians, then, come the following peoples of the Greeks: the Acarnanians, the Aetolians, and the Ozolian Locriansâ¦\n\nGreek elements were imported as a result of the ruling elite: Tharrhypas is said to have been the first, who by introducing Greek manners and learning, and humane laws into his cities, left any fame of himself.\n\n[Strabon Geografia , 008.001.001] Î¼ÎµÏá½° Î¼á½²Î½ Î¿á½Î½ ÏÎ¿á½ºÏ á¼¨ÏÎµÎ¹ÏÏÏÎ±Ï ÎºÎ±á½¶ ÏÎ¿á½ºÏ á¼¸Î»Î»Ï ÏÎ¹Î¿á½ºÏ Ïá¿¶Î½ á¼Î»Î»Î®Î½ÏÎ½ á¼ÎºÎ±ÏÎ½á¾¶Î½Î­Ï Îµá¼°ÏÎ¹ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Îá¼°ÏÏÎ»Î¿á½¶ ÎºÎ±á½¶ ÎÎ¿ÎºÏÎ¿á½¶ Î¿á¼± á½Î¶ÏÎ»Î±Î¹Â·\n\nAfter the Epeirotes and the Illyrians, then, come the following peoples of the Greeks: the Acarnanians, the Aetolians, and the Ozolian Locrians; and, next, the Phocians and Boeotians.\n\nImportant differentiation:\n\n131.

And after Libyrnians are the Illyrian nation, and the Illyrians live along beside the sea as far as Chaonia by Kerkyra, the island of AlkinoÃ¶s. And there is a Hellenic city here, which has the name Herakleia, with a harbour. The barbarians called Lotus-eaters are the following: Hierastamnai, Boulinoi (Hyllinoi), coterminous with Boulinoi the Hylloi. And these say Hyllos son of Herakles settled them: and they are barbarians. And they occupy a peninsula a little lesser than the Peloponnese. And from peninsula parastonion* is upright: Boulinoi live beside this. And Boulinoi are an Illyric nation. And the coastal voyage is of the territory of Boulinoi of a long day up to Nestos river\n\nKORKYRA. And by Chaonia is an island, Korkyra, and a Hellenic city in it, having three harbours by the city: of these the one is enclosed. And Korkyra belongs also to Thesprotia more than Chaonia. And I return again onto the mainland, whence I turned aside.\n\nAMBRAKIA. And after Molottia, Ambrakia, a Hellenic city: and this is distant from sea 80 stades. And there is also upon the sea a fort and an enclosed harbour. From here Hellas begins to be continuous as far as Peneios river and Homolion, a city of Magnesian territory, which is beside the river. And the coastal voyage of Ambrakia is of 120 stades.\n\nDuring his investigations, Ps-Scylax noticed that Hellas begins to be continuos from Ambrakia 'a Hellenic city', which sharply contrasted from the Molottia. More specifically, he saw as different Chaonia from Corcyra, the latter deemed as Hellenic city. Such explicit hints hardly infer any Greek identity to the Epirots.\n\nThe penetration of the Illyrians into northern Greece in the twelfth century BC led to the decay of the flourishing Mycenaean culture and to a complete upheaval in Greek political history. First, Epirus and Aetolia were engulfed by the wave of the Illyrian invasion. Epirus which had been in greater part Hellenized and whose religious center was the sanctuary of Zeus in Dodona, became once more Illyrian. Aetolia, a flourishing land in Homeric times, lapsed into almost complete barbarism. A great many of the Aetolians crossed the Corinthian Gulf, subjected the native Greek population, and settled in the land whichï»¿ became known as Elis.\n\nEarly Christian and Byzantine political philosophy, Francis DvornÃ­k\n\nThe Illyrians and Thracians proper all tattooed, as did the ancient Mycenians; there is evidence to show that there was a large Illyrian element in Epirus, where, as we saw above (p.94), there were many tribes which called themselves Pelasgianâ¦We have seen that there was no sharp line between the speech of Illyrians and Thesprotians or Thessalians|\n\nThe process of Hellenization reached its nadir at the Hellenistic period:\n\nExcept in Egypt, Hellenic influence was nowhere stronger than on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean. Greek cities arose there in continuation, or in place, of the older Semitic foundations, and gradually changed the aspect of the country. Such cities were Raphia, Gaza, Ascalon, Azotus, Jabneh, Jaffa, CÃ¦sarea, Dor, and Ptolemais. It was especially in eastern Palestine that Hellenism took a firm hold, and the cities of the Decapolis (which seems also to have included Damascus) were the centers of Greek influence.This influence extended in later times over the whole of the district east of the Jordan and of the Sea of Gennesaret, especially inTrachonitis, BatanÃ¦a, and Auranitis. The cities in western Palestine were not excepted. Samaria and Panias were at an early time settled by Macedonian colonists. The names of places were Hellenized: \"Rabbath-Ammon\" to \"Philadelphia\"; \"Armoab\" to \"Ariopolis\"; \"Akko\" to \"Ptolemais.\" The same occurred with personal names: \"á¸¤oni\" became \"Menelaus\"; \"Joshua\" became \"Jason\" or \"Jesus.\" The Hellenic influence pervaded everything, and even in the very strongholds of Judaism it modified the organization of the state, the laws, and public affairs, art, science, and industry, affecting even the ordinary things of life and the common associations of the people.\n\nA glance at the classes of Greek words which found their way into the Hebrew and the Jewish-Aramaic of the period, as compiled by I. LÃ¶w (in S. Krauss, \"LehnwÃ¶rter,\" pp. 623 et seq.), shows this with great clearness. The Hellenists were not confined to the aristocratic class, but were found in all strata of Jewish society (Wellhausen, \"I. J. G.\" p. 194), though the aristocrats naturally profited more from the good-will of Hellenistic rulers than did other classes.\n\nhttp://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/ar...#ixzz1WF2EhPF6\n\nThe term barbarian was merely employed to denote the non-Greek being of a certain ethnos. I don't even preclude that such a term was used sometimes even for Greek communities, who were alienated in a certain scale. Considering its usage in respect to Epirotes, it seem likely that 'barbarian' inferred their non-Greek being. Such a term was used indiscriminately for Illyrians, Thracians, Dacians and so on. Your interpretation of Plutarch's quote leaves much to be desired. He merely relates the historical tradition who attributed to Tharypas the responsibility for introducing Greek language, manners and tradition in the cities of Molossia. Without ascending of Tharypas to throne, Hellenism would never made progress in the cities of his homeland, which were not yet tainted by Hellenism.\n\nHammond's thesis relies on assumptions because Theopompus did not classify Epirotic tribes as Hellenes. He was quite familiar with the situation on Epirus, but he did not ranked Epirotes among Greek peoples.\n\nHerodotus' statement about Dodoneans as being the first Hellenes is doubtful since his account reeks of contradictions. It worth of noting the very fact that Herodotus viewed Thessalians as being the first Hellenic people who became vassals of the Great King (i.e Persian king). Such a fact should not be passed unnoticed. Aristotle's quote does not reconcile at all with ancient sources. Some trustworthy sources do mention Pelasgians as dwellers around Dodona. Its sanctuary was built by the Pelasgians. This is best exemplified by Achilles who prayed: \"High Zeus, Lord of Dodona, Pelasgian, living afar off, brooding over wintry Dodona\".\n\nThe topography of Epirotic tribes cannot be pinpointed since most of the tribes were keen to change periodically their territory, which is why some of them were semi-nomadic. The territory of Atintanes varies according to the sources. Ps-Scylax saw their seats near Dodona: \"Sharing a border with all these in the interior are Atintanes above Orikia and Karia as far as Dodonia\".\n\nThere is no compelling evidence for assuming that there were two distinct tribes bearing the name of Atintanes, which is why Hammond's assumption doesn't hold any water. Geographically speaking, Epirus was not considered as part of Greece. If Herodotus description is to be maintained, then Greece's boundary never went beyond Ambracia Gulf: 8.47: á¼Î¼ÏÏÎ±ÎºÎ¹ÏÏá¿ÏÎ¹ ÎºÎ±á½¶ ÎÎµÏ ÎºÎ±Î´Î¯Î¿Î¹ÏÎ¹, Î¿á¼³ á¼Î¾ á¼ÏÏÎ±ÏÎ­ÏÎ½ ÏÏÏÎ­ÏÎ½ á¼ÏÏÏÎ±ÏÎµÏÎ¿Î½ÏÎ¿. This statement is further strengthened by the testimonies of Strabo:\n\nDorians were gradually alienated as they were no longer part of their primordial stock. There are some evidences which infers how their Hellenization took place:\n\n[1] ÏÎ±á¿¦ÏÎ± Î¼á½²Î½ á¼Ï á¼Î´ÏÎ·ÏÏá½¹Î½ Î¿á¼± á¼ÏÎµÏÎ¿á½·Î·ÏÎ¿, ÏÏ Î»á½°Ï Î´á½² Ïá½°Ï ÎÏÏÎ¹á½³ÏÎ½, á¼µÎ½Î± Î´á½´ Î¼á½´ Î±á¼± Î±á½ÏÎ±á½¶ á¼ÏÏÎ¹ ÏÎ¿á¿ÏÎ¹ Î£Î¹ÎºÏ ÏÎ½á½·Î¿Î¹ÏÎ¹ ÎºÎ±á½¶ ÏÎ¿á¿ÏÎ¹ á¼ÏÎ³Îµá½·Î¿Î¹ÏÎ¹, Î¼ÎµÏá½³Î²Î±Î»Îµ á¼Ï á¼Î»Î»Î± Î¿á½Î½á½¹Î¼Î±ÏÎ±. á¼Î½Î¸Î± ÎºÎ±á½¶ ÏÎ»Îµá¿ÏÏÎ¿Î½ ÎºÎ±ÏÎµÎ³á½³Î»Î±ÏÎµ Ïá¿¶Î½ Î£Î¹ÎºÏ ÏÎ½á½·ÏÎ½Î á¼Ïá½¶ Î³á½°Ï á½á½¹Ï ÏÎµ ÎºÎ±á½¶ á½Î½Î¿Ï Ïá½°Ï á¼ÏÏÎ½Ï Î¼á½·Î±Ï Î¼ÎµÏÎ±ÏÎ¹Î¸Îµá½¶Ï Î±á½Ïá½° Ïá½° ÏÎµÎ»ÎµÏ ÏÎ±á¿Î± á¼Ïá½³Î¸Î·ÎºÎµ, ÏÎ»á½´Î½ Ïá¿Ï á¼ÏÏ ÏÎ¿á¿¦ ÏÏ Î»á¿ÏÎ ÏÎ±á½»Ïá¿ Î´á½² Ïá½¸ Î¿á½Î½Î¿Î¼Î± á¼Ïá½¸ Ïá¿Ï á¼ÏÏ ÏÎ¿á¿¦ á¼ÏÏá¿Ï á¼Î¸ÎµÏÎ¿\n\nThus he had done to Adrastos; and he also changed the names of the Dorian tribes, in order that the Sikyonians might not have the same tribes as the Argives; in which matter he showed great contempt of the Sikyonians, for the names he gave were taken from the names of a pig and an ass by changing only the endings.\n\nArchaeological excavations have yielded a culture in whole Epirus which is quite similar to that of Illyrians. What matters the most is that ancients were not sure as to which tribe was Illyrian and which one was Epirotic. Being so, we may surmise that the differences between Illyrians and Epirots were very thin. The Autariates are a case in point. While according to Appianus they were Illyrian, some sources mention them as Epirots. The same goes also for Amantes, Perrhabeians, Dassaretes, Chaones, etc. Most of scholars believe that Illyrian penetrated as far as Aetolia, as it is evinced by linguistic vestiges. Illyrians engulfed most of Epirus, Aetolia, Acarnania and a certain part of Thessaly. This is further enforced by the fact that ancients stressed out the lacking of Hellenism of the above-mentioned regions. The fanatical outrage of most Greeks to not accept Epirots as genuinely Greek comes from their experience.\n\nDescribing the campaign of Xerxes, Herodotus asserts:\n\n131. He then was staying in the region of Pieriamany days, for the road over the mountains of Macedonia was being cut meanwhile by a third part of his army, that all the host might pass over by this way into the land of the Perraibians: and now the heralds returned who had been sent to Hellas to demand the gift of earth, some empty-handed and others bearing earth and water.\n\ná½ Î¼á½²Î½ Î´á½´ ÏÎµÏá½¶ Î Î¹ÎµÏÎ¯Î·Î½ Î´Î¹Î­ÏÏÎ¹Î²Îµ á¼¡Î¼Î­ÏÎ±Ï ÏÏ ÏÎ½Î¬ÏÂ· Ïá½¸ Î³á½°Ï Î´á½´ á½ÏÎ¿Ï Ïá½¸ ÎÎ±ÎºÎµÎ´Î¿Î½Î¹Îºá½¸Î½ á¼ÎºÎµÎ¹ÏÎµ Ïá¿Ï ÏÏÏÎ±ÏÎ¹á¿Ï ÏÏÎ¹ÏÎ·Î¼Î¿ÏÎ¯Ï, á¼µÎ½Î± ÏÎ±ÏÏá¿ Î´Î¹ÎµÎ¾Î¯á¿ á¼ ÏÎ±ÏÎ± á¼¡ ÏÏÏÎ±ÏÎ¹á½´ á¼Ï Î ÎµÏÏÎ±Î¹Î²Î¿ÏÏ.

He further asserts that Nepotolemus left for his descendants certain possessions over Epirus. Again not much can be inferred for the rest of Epirus. The population was profoundly Pelasgian which was later overlaid by the Illyrians. The following fragment is worthy of further analyzing:\n\nOf the Thesprotians and Molossians after the great inundation, the first king, according to some historians, was Phaethon, one of those who came into Epirus with Pelasgus. Others tell us that Deucalion and Pyrrha, having set up the worship of Jupiter at Dodona, settled there among the Molossians. In after time, Neoptolemus, Achilles's son, planting a colony, possessed these parts himself, and left a succession of kings, who, after him, was named Pyrrhidae, as he in his youth was called Pyrrhus, and of his legitimate children, one was born of Lanassa, daughter of Cleodaeus, Hyllus's son, had also that name. From him Achilles came to have divine honours in Epirus, under the name of Aspetus, in the language of the country. After these first kings, those of the following intervening times becoming barbarous, and insignificant both in their power and their lives, Tharrhypas is said to have been the first who, by introducing Greek manners and learning, and humane laws into his cities, left any fame of himself. Alcetas was the son of Tharrhypas, Arybas of Alcetas, and of Arybas and Troas his queen, Aeacides; he married Phthia, the daughter of Menon, the Thessalian, a man of note at the time of the Lamiac war, and of highest command in the confederate army next to Leosthenes. To Aeacides were born of Phthia, Deidamia and Troas, daughters, and Pyrrhus, a son.\n\n1. There is no archeological proof indicating any great inundation in Epirus, as Plutarch believes. In all probability, such a myth was loaned from East (probably Hettite). Some scholars used it symbolically with the purpose to erase the traces of previous inhabitants.\n\n2. If Pelasgus signifies the presence of Pelasgians, then it seem not unlikely that Epirus was firstly occupied by them. Ancient sources make it plain that Pelasgians were not Greeks. As modern studies goes on, Pelasgians were indigenous there who used to live much earlier than Greeks. Herotodus pointed out that some Pelasgians passed as Hellenes, which is a certain sign of the assimilation.\n\n3. Plutarch's line about later kings becoming barbarous is quite interesting. Probably the line of Aecides was interrupted for some time or even some kings were not in throne. We should not ignore the very fact that Hellenism was always confined within the court of Aecides. So far no source suggest that Epirots were of the same stock as Aecides.\n\n\"Hellenes and barbarians\". Thucydides employed such a term even for the Illyrians and Lyncestians. Surely he had not in mind Greek-speakings who did not share the splendid culture of Athens. It's precisely Thucydides who noticed the progressing of Hellenism in Epirus as a result of the colonies, mainly of Ambracia. Commenting that situation, McInerney holds that: âThe episode is structured around to sets of overlapping oppositions: Greek versus barbarian, and polis versus etnosâ.\n\nEpirotes called Achilles \"ASPETUS\" in their \"native language\". An 100% Greek word of Dorian origin. His etymology is not yet settled down. Indeed some linguists tried to match it with a similar word found on Homeric verses, but it gives no satisfactory explanation. A more plausible etymology might be well traced to the Albanian word 'shpetÃ«' (quick), which make some senses on the ground that Achilles was often nicknamed 'fleet-footed'. Dorian dialect of Epirus is not Greek at all. Yet still, Dorians were of the same stock as Illyrians, as some traditions ascertain. Their primordial seat was located somewhere in Dalmatia. What put in motion them is still unknown but it seem very likely that Illyrians had their share on their invasion. Milojcic regards the Early Illyrians, the Dorians (with Epirus as their point of departure), and once more the Illyrians as constituting these movements. Be that as it may, ancient Greeks possessed an Illyrian ingredient which is why there are a cluster of common words. Some maintain that even modern Albanian (descendant of the Illyrian) is able to explain some archaic Greek words.\n\nhttp://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/.../Illyria*.html\n\nFirstly the Great King never conquered Epirus. Furthermore Epirotes were west of Thessalians, so Persian army (which came from the east) passed first from Thessalians.So no contradictions at it.\n\nHe did not call Macedonians as the first Greeks who got subjugated to the Great King. History relates that Macedonians were one of the first peoples who became vassals of Persians.\n\nAlso he never wrote that Dodona built by Selli and Graeci. Where do u read this, at Aristotle text? I was not talking about Selloi nor Graeci. I just stated that Pelasgians were known as the builders of that sanctuary because even the literary tradition mention them.\n\nHammondis an expert on the issue of Epirus, because of his excavations and research on ancient textes. I'm not trying to belittle his importance on the studies relating Epirus. He did tremendous studies on the topography of Epirotic tribes by twining historical sources with his own experience for he visited almost every corner of mountainous Epirus. But his general outlook isn't correct at all. He is too rigid to change his positions even if new informations how come in light. Hammond refrain from calling Illyrians the tribes of Epirus, albeit he admit the similarities between the culture of Epirus and that of Illyria. His claim that Epirotes have spoken Greek from inception is of no account. There is no evidence to suggest that Molossians & the rest spoke Greek from the beginning. Archeological excavations have yielded numerous inscriptions which were written in Greek. But there is a serious fact which further complicates things. Let presuppose that Epirotes have been Greek from times immemorial. Linguists have long noted the presence of various Greek dialects in a relatively small region like Epirus. Some inscriptions were in Doric, Aeolian and some others in what linguists call as Western Greek dialect. If Epirus had it been Greek, then it would not have a multiple of various dialects of Greek. Last but not least, I'd like to point the existence of certain names revealed in Epirus which clearly pertain to the Illyrian onomasticon!\n\nIllyrian presence in Aetolia:\n\nSome scholars have pointed to Illyrian presence in Aetolia and Acarnania. They based their opinion on thorough analysis of Thucydides's paragraph which recognizes a large non-Greek element among Aetolians:\n\nIII,94: The Aetolian nation, although numerous and warlike, yet dwelt in un-walled villages scattered far apart, and had nothing but light armor, and might, according to the Messenians, be subdued without much difficulty before succors could arrive. The plan which they recommended was to attack first the Apodotians, next the Ophionians, and after these the Eurytanians, who are the largest tribe in Aetolia, and speak, as is said, a language exceedingly difficult to understand, and eat their flesh raw.\n\n1) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curetes_(tribe)\n\nAccording to Strabo the Curetes were assigned multiple identities and places of origin (i.e. either Acarnanians, Aetolians, from Crete, or from Euboea). He clarified the identity of the Curetes and regarded them solely as Aetolians. Dionysius of Halicarnassus mentioned the Curetes as the old name of the Aetolians. It seems evident that Strabo clearly groups and classifies Curetes as one of the 'barbarian' tribes of Aetolia.\n\n2) Book X, Chapter 2: http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/...rabo/10B*.html\n\nâThe Evenus River begins in the territory of those Bomians who live in the country of the Ophians, the Ophians being an Aetolian tribe (like the Eurytanians and Agraeans and Curetes and others), and flows at first, not through the Curetan country, which is the same as the Pleuronian, but through the more easterly country, past Chalcis and Calydon; and then, bending back towards the plains of Old Pleuron and changing its course to the west, it turns towards its outlets and the south. In earlier times it was called Lycornas.\"\n\n3) Furthermore, in book X, Chapter 3, Strabo seems to draw a parallel between the Curetes and Abantes.\n\nhttp://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/...rabo/10C*.html\n\nââ¦ the Curetes settled at Chalcis, but since they were continually at war for the Lelantine Plain and the enemy would catch them by the front hair and drag them down, he says, they let their hair grow long behind but cut short the part in front, and because of this they were called \"Curetes,\" from the cut of their hair*, and they then migrated to Aetolia, and, after taking possession of the region round Pleuron, called the people who lived on the far side of the AcheloÃ¼s \"Acarnanians,\" because they kept their heads unshorn.\"\n\n* - \"Cura.\" From this passage one might identify the \"Curetes\" with the \"Abantes\" (see 10.1.3), whom Homer speaks of as \"letting their hair grow long behind\" (Iliad 2.542). According to a scholium (on Iliad l.c.), the Euboeans wore the hair long behind \"for the sake of manly strength.\"\n\n4) Who were the Abantes?\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abantes\n\nAristotle states that the Abantes were Thracians from Abae in Phokis (Phocis). The Abantes were definitely not Ionians themselves, but many ended up assimilated into the Ionian population.\n\nBrief conclusion:\n\nFrom the above quotes it looks like the term \"Curetes\" was a legendary (ancient) name of the Aetolians as a whole. According to Strabo, the Curetes were one of many tribes of the Aetolian nation - these tribes were regarded as non-Greek by several ancient authors (Agraeans, Eurytanians, etc.). In addition to this, there was some sort of connection between the Curetes and Abantes; and Abantes were of Thracian stock. It would appear then that a large part of Aetolians were of non-Greek stock.\n\nPOLYBIUS - 'THE RISE OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE', HISTORIES Book XVIII.5\n\nÎá¼°ÏÏÎ»á¿¶Î½ Î´' Î¿á½Îº á¼Î½ÎµÎºÏÏÎ½: ÏÎ¿Î¯Î±Ï Î´á½² ÎºÎµÎ»ÎµÏÎµÏÎ­ Î¼Îµ\" ÏÎ·Ïá½¶Î½ \" á¼ÎºÏÏÏÎµá¿Î½ á¼Î»Î»Î¬Î´Î¿Ï ÎºÎ±á½¶ Ïá¿¶Ï á¼ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¯Î¶ÎµÏÎµ ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ·Î½; Î±á½Ïá¿¶Î½ Î³á½°Ï Îá¼°ÏÏÎ»á¿¶Î½ Î¿á½Îº Îµá¼°Ïá½¶Î½ á¼Î»Î»Î·Î½ÎµÏ Î¿á¼± ÏÎ»ÎµÎ¯Î¿Ï Ï: Ïá½¸ Î³á½°Ï Ïá¿¶Î½ á¼Î³ÏÎ±á¿¶Î½ á¼Î¸Î½Î¿Ï ÎºÎ±á½¶ Ïá½¸ Ïá¿¶Î½ á¼ÏÎ¿Î´ÏÏá¿¶Î½, á¼ÏÎ¹ Î´á½² Ïá¿¶Î½ á¼Î¼ÏÎ¹Î»ÏÏÏÎ½, Î¿á½Îº á¼ÏÏÎ¹Î½ á¼Î»Î»Î¬Ï. á¼¢ ÏÎ¿ÏÏÏÎ½ Î¼á½²Î½ ÏÎ±ÏÎ±ÏÏÏÎµá¿ÏÎ­ Î¼Î¿Î¹;\"\n\nâWhat is this Greece which you demand that I should evacuate, and what how do you define Greece?.

So do you allow to me to remain in those territories' While this statement has been made by Philip V during his grievances to the Roman delegates, it's worth of noting that Epirots and certain section of the Aetolians were still perceived as non-Greeks.\n\nThe Peloponnesian Warâ, Penguin Classics, 1954, Book Two, chapter 7, page 137):\n\nAbout the same time towards the close of the summer, the Ambraciot forces, with a number of barbarians that they had raised, marched against the Amphilochian Argos and the rest of that country. The origin of their enmity against the Argives was this. This Argos and the rest of Amphilochia were colonized by Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraus. Dissatisfied with the state of affairs at home on his return thither after the Trojan War, he built this city in the Ambracian Gulf, and named it Argos after his own country. This was the largest town in Amphilochia, and its inhabitants the most powerful. Under the pressure of misfortune many generations afterwards, they called in the Ambraciots, their neighbours on the Amphilochian border, to join their colony; and it was by this union with the Ambraciots that they learnt their present Hellenic speech, the rest of the Amphilochians being barbarians. After a time the Ambraciots expelled the Argives and held the city themselves. Upon this the Amphilochians gave themselves over to the Acarnanians; and the two together called the Athenians, who sent them Phormio as general and thirty ships; upon whose arrival they took Argos by storm, and made slaves of the Ambraciots; and the Amphilochians and Acarnanians inhabited the town in common. After this began the alliance between the Athenians and Acarnanians. The enmity of the Ambraciots against the Argives thus commenced with the enslavement of their citizens; and afterwards during the war they collected this armament among themselves and the Chaonians, and other of the neighbouring barbarians. Arrived before Argos, they became masters of the country; but not being successful in their attacks upon the town, returned home and dispersed among their different people.\n\nHerodotus Book 1: Clio [56]\n\nÂ«á½¦ Î¾Îµá¿Î½Îµ ÎÎ±ÎºÎµÎ´Î±Î¹Î¼á½¹Î½Î¹Îµ, Ïá½±Î»Î¹Î½ Ïá½½ÏÎµÎµ Î¼Î·Î´á½² á¼ÏÎ¹Î¸Î¹ á¼Ï Ïá½¸ á¼±Ïá½¹Î½Î Î¿á½ Î³á½°Ï Î¸ÎµÎ¼Î¹Ïá½¸Î½ ÎÏÏÎ¹Îµá¿¦ÏÎ¹ ÏÎ±ÏÎ¹á½³Î½Î±Î¹ á¼Î½Î¸Î±á¿¦ÏÎ±.Â» á½ Î´á½² Îµá¼¶ÏÎµ Â«á½¦ Î³á½»Î½Î±Î¹, á¼Î»Î»á¾½ Î¿á½ ÎÏÏÎ¹Îµá½»Ï Îµá¼°Î¼Î¹ á¼Î»Î»á¾½ á¼ÏÎ±Î¹á½¹Ï.Â» [4] á½ Î¼á½²Î½ Î´á½´ Ïá¿ ÎºÎ»ÎµÎ·Î´á½¹Î½Î¹ Î¿á½Î´á½²Î½ ÏÏÎµá½½Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Ï á¼ÏÎµÏÎµá½·ÏÎ·Ïá½³ ÏÎµ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Ïá½¹ÏÎµ Ïá½±Î»Î¹Î½ á¼Î¾á½³ÏÎ¹ÏÏÎµ Î¼ÎµÏá½° Ïá¿¶Î½ ÎÎ±ÎºÎµÎ´Î±Î¹Î¼Î¿Î½á½·ÏÎ½Î ÏÎ¿á½ºÏ Î´á½² á¼Î»Î»Î¿Ï Ï á¼Î¸Î·Î½Î±á¿Î¿Î¹ ÎºÎ±Ïá½³Î´Î·ÏÎ±Î½ Ïá½´Î½ á¼Ïá½¶ Î¸Î±Î½á½±Ïá¿³, á¼Î½ Î´á½² Î±á½ÏÎ¿á¿ÏÎ¹ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Î¤Î¹Î¼Î·Ïá½·Î¸ÎµÎ¿Î½ Ïá½¸Î½ ÎÎµÎ»Ïá½¹Î½, ÏÎ¿á¿¦ á¼ÏÎ³Î± ÏÎµÎ¹Ïá¿¶Î½ ÏÎµ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Î»á½µÎ¼Î±ÏÎ¿Ï á¼ÏÎ¿Î¹Î¼á¾½ á¼Î½ Î¼á½³Î³Î¹ÏÏÎ± ÎºÎ±ÏÎ±Î»á½³Î¾Î±Î¹\n\nâLacedemonian stranger, go back and enter not into the temple, for it is not lawful for Dorians to pass in hither.\" He said: \"Woman, I am not a Dorian, but an Achaian.\" So then, paying no attention to the ominous speech, he made his attempt and then was expelled again with the Lacedemonians; but the rest of the men the Athenians laid in bonds to be put to death, and among them Timesitheos the Delphian, with regard to whom I might mention very great deeds of strength and courage which he performed.

The plan which they recommended was to attack first the Apodotians, next the Ophionians, and after these the Eurytanians, who are the largest tribe in Aetolia, and speak, as is said, a language exceedingly difficult to understand, and eat their flesh raw.\n\nIt has been proved beyond any doubt the presence of a large Illyrian element within Epirus. Their presence is best examplified by the archeological excavations as well as by linguistcs. Their appearance on Epirus rests on the great turmoils which followed the decay of Mycenean civilization. At that period, Illyrians poured down in Epirus, Aetolia, Acarnania all the way to Pelepopnesse.\n\nAt Dodona and at Vaxia southeast of Dodona Illyrian object's of the eighth and seventh centuries have been found, and they are indicative of peaceful and perhaps sometimes warring penetration by Illyrians.\n\nBy carefully sifting the archeological evidences, Hammond assumes that Illyrians peacfully penetrated in midst of Epirus, as it is clearly demonstrated by the presence of certain objects which are addmitedely Illyrian.\n\nThe Illyrians and Thracians proper all tattooed, as did the ancient Mycenians; there is evidence to show that there was a large Illyrian element in Epirus, where, as we saw above (p.94), there were many tribes which called themselves Pelasgianâ¦We have seen that there was no sharp line between the speech of Illyrians and Thesprotians or Thessalians|\n\nThe text of Plutarch that u brought here has many mistakes. For example it says that a colony planted at Epirus. Well there is nowhere in the text of Plutarch the word colony (Î±ÏÎ¿Î¹ÎºÎ¯Î±). Another one sever mistake is that Tharypas brought the Greek learnign at Epirus. Whether Plutarch mentioned explicitly or not the founding of colonies carries no weight at all. It's abduantely clear that he point to the Hellenization of Epirus, which was initiated by its kings, who were willing to adopt Greek manners. The fact that Greek is to be found in the inscriptions doesn't mean that Epirots used to speak Greek too. There are some compelling reasons to believe that Epirots spoke an Illyrian patois, with recognizable Doric elements.\n\nSome Illyrian tribes seem to have been pressing southwards into Epirus in the first half of the first millennium B.C., to judge by the distribution of some types of tribal names, but Greek seems to have been well-established throughout most of that region at least as the language used by the leading families early in the fourth century. However, even the fact that inscriptions of a koinon of Molossian tribes,for example, were written in Greek c. 370 B.C. does not prove that Greeks their original native language. Political arrangements would still have been made by the dominant minorities. One may note the periodof bilingualism in the hellenization of central Sicily.\n\nThe Cambridge ancient history - Volume 3, Part 1 Obviously we dont know what was happening before this era, but at least we are sure that Epirus was Greek since the Mycenaean era I am left far from being persuaded as long as you do not accompany your statements with relevant quotes. The relation of Greeks with Myceneans is largely conjectural. Even if we take for granted the Greek identity of Myceneans, their presence in Epirus was extremely scarce as was the case with Illyria, Thracia, etc. Being so, the slender Mycenean artefacts might well be classified as being imported. Thucydides holds that Greece did not even exist as a name before the Trojan war. What matters the most is that Greeks did not cease from calling Epirots as non-Greeks, even though they underwent a conspicious process of Hellenization. At his time, Thucydides saw Epirots from Greeks as markedly different. Here is what the great Athenian strategist on his âPeloponnesian Warâ had to say on this issue (The Peloponnesian Warâ, Penguin Classics, 1954, Book Two, chapter 7, page 137):\n\nLittle can be learned from written sources of the origin and character of the Illyrians. The Greek legend that Cadmus and Harmonia settled in Illyria and became the parents of Illyrius, the eponymous ancestor of the whole Illyrian people, has been interpreted as an indication that the Greeks recognized some affinity between themselves and the Illyrians; but this inference is based on insufficient data.\n\nIllyrians were from the same stock of Gauls and Celts which means Hallstatt culture (and this is and 100% fact) and Dorians were one of the 4 Greek races. All the historians, all the linguists, all the archaeological findins all the ancient testimonies and myths but most importand Dorians themselves confirm that Dorians were Greeks! With your unique declaration we have the conclusion that Spartians were not Greeks! hahahaha. Can u imagine something like this? I guess you did not graps what I was trying to point out. Of course Dorians were linguistically Greek, being one of the main branches of the Greek language. Even though their early history is shrouded in mystery, they were not Greek from the very inception. Proto-Dorians were of the same stock as the Illyrians. It's should be noted that Dorians cohabited for centuries in Illyria, which make it quite plausible that they were at least partially Illyrian. Modern scholars are inclined to adhere the view according to which an Illyrian ingridient is quite feasible.\n\nPs-Scylax hammered home:\n\n22. ILLYRIOI. And after Libyrnians are the Illyrian nation, and the Illyrians live along beside the sea as far as Chaonia by Kerkyra, the island of AlkinoÃ¶s. And there is a Hellenic city here, which has the name Herakleia, with a harbour. The barbarians called Lotus-eaters are the following: Hierastamnai, Boulinoi (Hyllinoi), coterminous with Boulinoi the Hylloi. And these say Hyllos son of Herakles settled them: and they are barbarians. And they occupy a peninsula a little lesser than the Peloponnese. And from peninsula parastonion* is upright: Boulinoi live beside this. And Boulinoi are an Illyric nation. And the coastal voyage is of the territory of Boulinoi of a long day up to Nestos river\n\nThe whole thing is not coincidence at all. Its not unilikely that Dorians were intimately accompanied by their Illyrian brethern during their supposed migration which gradually swamped most of Greece:\n\nThe penetration of the Illyrians into northern Greece in the twelfth century BC led to the decay of the flourishing Mycenaean culture and to a complete upheaval in Greek political history. First, Epirus and Aetolia were engulfed by the wave of the Illyrian invasion. Epirus which had been in greater part Hellenized and whose religious center was the sanctuary of Zeus in Dodona, became once more Illyrian. Aetolia, a flourishing land in Homeric times, lapsed into almost complete barbarism. A great many of the Aetolians crossed the Corinthian Gulf, subjected the native Greek population, and settled in the land whichï»¿ became known as Elis.\n\nEarly Christian and Byzantine political philosophy, Francis DvornÃ­k With the drift of time, Dorians were gradually alienated as they were no longer part of their primordial stock. There are some evidences which infers how their Hellenization took place:\n\n68.

It is said that Orestes once took possession of Orestias â when in exile on account of the murder of his mother â and left the country bearing his name; and that he also founded a city and called it Argos Oresticum. But the Illyrian tribes which are near the southern part of the mountainous country and those which are above the Ionian Gulf are intermingled with these peoples; for above Epidamnus and Apollonia as far as the Ceraunian Mountains dwell the Bylliones, the Taulantii, the Parthini, and the Brygi.\n\n(â¦) Then, because one tribe or another was always getting the mastery over others, they all ended in the Macedonian empire, except a few who dwelt above the Ionian Gulf. And in fact the regions about Lyncus, Pelagonia, Orestias, and elimeia, used to be called Upper Macedonia, though later on they were by some also called Free Macedonia. But some go so far as to call the whole of the country Macedonia, as far as Corcyra, at the same time stating as their reason that in tonsure, language, short cloak, and other things of the kind, the usages of the inhabitants are similar, although, they add, some speak both languages.â To get it straight, Strabo firmly said that some of the tribes which were tightly linked with one another were basically the same on the basis of the language and traditions. Some of them (he did not specify) were bilinguals, invoking that certain tribes were in the process of Hellenization. He furnishes us with the following piece of information:\n\nTheopompus says, that there are fourteen Epirotic nations. Of these, the most celebrated are the Chaones and Molotti, because the whole of Epirus was at one time subject, first to Chaones, afterwards to Molotti. Their power was greatly strengthened by the family of their kings being descended from the ÃacidÃ¦, and because the ancient and famous oracle of Dodona26 was in their country. Chaones, Thesproti, and next after these CassopÃ¦i, (who are Thes- proti,) occupy the coast, a fertile tract reaching from the Ceraunian mountains to the Ambracian Gulf.\n\nThe absence of Hellenic Ambraciotes and Acarnanes is very significant. Strabo did not rank them among 14 tribes of Epirus but set them apart:\n\nThen follows the entrance of the Ambracian Gulf, which is a little more than four stadia in width. The circuit of the gulf is 400 stadia, and the whole has good harbours. On sailing into it, on the right hand are the Acarnanes, who are Greeks; and here near the entrance of the gulf is a temple of Apollo Actius, situated on an eminence; in the plain below is a sacred grove, and a naval station. and further down he averred:\n\nOn the left hand are Nicopolis, and the CassopÃ¦i, a tribe of the EpirotÃ¦, extending as far as the recess of the gulf at Ambracia. Imagine yourself as you were sailing in the Bay of Ambracia. As the ship enters there, the captain Strabo would point with his finger the left side in the direction of the Cassopeans in Epirus. When the ship turns right, Strabo would point with his finger at the lands of Acarnanes, which were Greek.\n\nThe Molotti also were EpirotÃ¦, and were subjects of Pyrrhus Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, and of his descendants, who were Thessalians. The rest were governed by native princes.\n\nThe bilinguals of Strabo might have well been Molossians, Lyncesti and the Encheli who were governed by Aecides, BacchiadÃ¦ and Cadmides, ruling families which used to spoke presumably Greek. The rest of the tribes where governed by their own princes, clearly implying for their non-Greek language.\n\nAnyway, as far as i know there no linguistic vestiges at Epirus. Furthermore u must thing that at the age of Strabo and under of the changes that Roman Empire brought, many populations changed their territories. So Strabo describes the situation at his era. This situation shows nothing for the origin of Epirotes. You are dead wrong. Strabo relied his information mainly on the earlier observations made by the Homer, Hecatues of Milet and Theopompus. If the Illyrians have gradually poured in Epirus, he would have noticed it. Strabo holds that both of Illyria and Epirus were short in men, which is not far from the truth, knowing that thousands of lllyrians and Epirotes were either enslaved or expelled out of their native lands.\n\nYes Hellenism was a process that took place at Epirus, but only with the meaning of the cultural evolution and this happened from Tharypas after his returning from Athens. A very important clue is that at the era of Strabo the Athenian element had overcompensated every other Greek element and ended up as the one and only Greek element. That's meaningless. If the hellenization meant simply a cultural evolution, as you maintain, then why the same isn't noticed at various Greek tribes which fell under the hegemony of Athens? There were a plenty of Greek cities which were directly controlled by the Athens but no source explicitly made any mention of the Hellenization? Had it been Epirus profoundly Greek, Plutarch would not feel the need to draw the attention that Hellenization was taking place there.\n\nSpeakers of these various Greek dialects settled different parts of Greece at different times during the Middle Bronze Age, with one group, the \"northwest\" Greeks, developing their own dialect and peopling central Epirus. This was the origin of the Molossian or Epirotic tribes.\n\np 62, In the shadow of Olympus; The emergence of Macedon, E.N.Borza\n\nI urge for caution if you are about to cite Eugene Borza. I guess you're aware of his books, where he question the Hellenism of the Macedones on the sense they never perceived\n\nOlympic Games\n\nIt's not settled down yet if the Epirots really participated on Olympics. A dubious list which can be found all over internet mention at least five Epirots who participated there.\n\nSophron of Ambracia Stadion, Olympics 432 BC\n\nArybbas of Epirus Tethrippon Olympics 344 BC\n\nTlasimachus of Ambracia Tethrippon and Synoris Olympics 296 BC\n\nAntipater of Epirus Stadion Olympics 136 BC\n\nAndromachus of Ambracia Stadion Olympics 60 BC\n\nThree of them were from Ambracia, a Greek colony at the entrance of Epirus. There is virtually no proof to ascertain that the rest of Epirots were allowed to participate on Olympics.\n\nIt cannot be proven that proto-Dorians spoke a genuine Greek language while they were shifting in south. What's becoming increasingly clear is the fact that they were accompanied by various Illyrian tribes who happened to be their close neighbours. One of the main Dorian tribes is admittedely Illyrian. The following testimony taken out by the lexicon of Stephan Byzantini is very telling:\n\ná½Î»Î»Îµá¿Ï, á¼Î¸Î½Î¿Ï á¼¸Î»Î»Ï ÏÎ¹ÎºÏÎ½ ,\n\ná½Ïá½²Ï Î´á½² ÏÎ¿á½ºÏ á½Î»Î»Î¿Ï Ï ÎÎ¹Î²Ï ÏÎ½Î¿á½¶ ÎºÎ±Î¯ ÏÎ¹Î½ÎµÏ á¼¼ÏÏÏÎ¿Î¹ Î»ÎµÎ³ÏÎ¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î¹ ÎÏá¾·ÎºÎµÏ.

The \"Birds\" of Aristophanes probably reflect that conviction:\n\nPITHETAERUS Ah! and since when, pray? P,p>ROMETHEUS\n\nSince you founded this city in the air. There is not a man who now sacrifices to the gods, the smoke of the victims no longer reaches us. Not the smallest offering comes! We fast as though it were the festivall of Demeter. The barbarian gods, who are dying of hunger, are bawling like Illyrians and threaten to make an armed descent upon Zeus, if he does not open markets where joints of the victims are sold.\n\nPITHETAERUS\n\nWhat! there are other gods besides you, barbarian gods who dwell above Olympus?\n\nPROMETHEUS\n\nIf there were no barbarian gods, who would be the patron of Execestides?\n\nPITHETAERUS\n\nAnd what is the name of these gods?\n\nPROMETHEUS\n\nTheir name? Why, the Triballi\n\nPresence of non-Greek cults practiced in Dodona sanctuary. Elizabeth Carney has long noticed the popularity of snake imagery on Dodona votives and the use of living snakes in Epirus in a prophetic cult of Apollo. The Greeks have no addiction to the snake cults which set them apart from the Illyrians, who as the pre-Greeks, had a special devotion to the snake in general. It's not odd why the myth of Cadmus (the progenitor of Illyrians) had been turned into a snake. Most of the Illyrian tombstones have often been associated with snake-symbols.\n\nAccording to Hammond the shrine of Dodona received dedications which were typically Illyrian, and some bronze pendands and other objects of a Glasinac character were found at Vaxia in central Epirus, There is evidence too of Illyrian bands making their way into Thessaly, for instance at Halus in tumulus-burials with cairns of stones. (N.G.L.Hammond âIllyris, Epirus and Macedoniaâ in The Cambridge Ancient History, Part 1)\n\nThe etymology of Alexander is not established yet. The earliest attestation is to be found in Linear B as a-re-ka-sa-da-ra. A similar name was found in Hittite as well. Oliver Masson opt for its Mycenean origin; while the rest of linguist notice its wide distribution over Minor Asia, Epirus, Macedonia, Illyria and southern Italy.\n\np 252, History of the Hellenic World: The Archaic period, George S. Phylactopoulos, 1977\n\nPlutarch found as quite interesting that name which is why he mentioned. I rather think that he was not persuaded with its Greek meaning, otherwise he would explain the meaning which is concealed behind that name. The phrahse \"in their country's tongue\" meant a non-Greek idiom on the grounds that numerous testimonies left Epirus out of Greece, considering its people scarcely Greek.\n\nHammond is leading authority on the studies relating to Epirus. His reputation has not yet surpassed by any scholar. But some of his statements are overly speculative based on no facts. He never paid attention to the testimonies which pointed out the opposite of his thoughts. I have thoroughly studied most of the old sources relating to the Epirots and they truly consider them as completely different from the Greeks.\n\nWe see here that Illyrians, whose costumes were different from Epirotes, made a violent penetrations at grounds that were not Illyrian. Have you ever bothered yourself to know if the Epirots wore the same costumes as the Greeks?\n\nThe supporters of the idea which considers Epirotes as Greek is laid on the fact that most of inscriptions were written in Greek. This fact has been overshadowed by the presence of such inscriptions among Thracians, Illyrians, Iberians, Messapians, etc. Most of them were written in Greek too. It plainly means that Greek was a written language throughout the Mediterranean world. Judging from the inscription yielded in Epirus, we cannot for sure reconstruct how their language look-like.
