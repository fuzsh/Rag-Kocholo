        "text": "For more than 40 years we have been travelling you with safety, comfort and commitment to improving transport conditions for both residents and travellers of South-West Crete.\n\nWe invite you to travel with us to top destinations that will give you an unforgettable experience of a lifetime!\n\nWithout a road connection, visitors discovering Agia Roumeli tend to come again and again.\n\nAgia Roumeli is built at the end of the Samaria National Park. A very beautiful village, on the edge of the Libyan Sea and at the roots of the White Mountains. It is located in one of the areas of Crete with the wildest nature, with rare flora, fauna, and geology.\n\nHora Sfakion, or Sfakia, is a beautiful village nestled in-between azure seas and majestic mountains. The village is very traditional, and a great place to holiday off the beaten track. There are some great restaurants along the seafront, and a range of shops to serve your everyday needs.\n\nLoutro is a beautiful seaside destination set in a small cove on the south coast of Crete.\n\nThe ancient settlement of whitewashed buildings sits at the foot of towering mountains which tumble into a semi-circular bay lapped by the pristine waters of the Libyan Sea.\n\nGavdos is located 26 miles (50 km) south of Hora Sfakion. It rises between Africa and Crete, almost in the middle of the Libyan Sea, and is the southernmost tip of Europe, its last border with the south. It is a small island of 29 square kilometers. It has a permanent population of about 90 people, but that number rises to around 3,500 in the summer – mostly from visitors who come to enjoy the island’s unspoilt attractions.\n\nSouth Crete has some of the most impressive, unspoiled, and idyllic beaches on the island. The villages of Chora Sfakion, Loutro, Agia Roumeli, Sougia, Palaiochora, Plakias, Agia Galini, and the island of Gavdos, are the perfect choice for people seeking tranquility and the true Cretan tradition. Also from Agia Roumeli you can visit the Samaria National Park, an attraction for visitors from all over the world"
