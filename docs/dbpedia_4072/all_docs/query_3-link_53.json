        "text": "Our grandmother Anna, while coming from Samaria to be married in Sfakia, brought with her all her secrets of cooking, which she later gave to her daughters and her daughter-in-law. By turn, all these secrets were given to us, their children.\n\nOur childhood memories are accompanied by odours, flavors and fragrances that remain unchanged in our minds. These are exactly our aid for a journey , in which we want you as companions, by presenting a piece of our tradition, of our place, Sfakia. Our grandmother told us: \"If you want, my child, to do something good, do it with your hands...\". So, we followed her advice as we are selecting pure materials, and therefore, we make for you handmade, traditional pastries without preservatives. Nowadays, original flavors are lost, therefore, our vision is to create ... genuine ... solid flavors of Sfakia...\n\nOur bakery is a purely Greek and family business. Our love for cooking and our ancestors’ experience in this field motivated us to share with all Greeks our beautifull and nutritional creations. Our vision is to create qualitative, tasty and healthy products considering that the genuine tastes are lost. As we realized the growing demand for our products, we started our production from our little bakery in Sfakia and we decided to continue our \"journey\" all over Greece, always by maintaining our tradition and \"our family\" character."
