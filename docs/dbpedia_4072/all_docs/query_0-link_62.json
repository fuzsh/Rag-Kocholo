        "text": "I went to Greece. And I didn‚Äôt go to Santorini. OR Mykonos.\n\nGASP!\n\nInstead, I went to the far, far removed island of Crete and spent my time exploring the teeny tiny 200 person fishing villages and tucked away mountain towns.\n\nCall me crazy!\n\nWhy, you ask?\n\nEver since I was a little nugget, I‚Äôve dreamed of going to Greece. I remember like it was yesterday; 12-year-old mini Casiedilla, devouring spanakopita and baklava at my local Greek diner, while gazing starry-eyed at the huge picture of Santorini plastered across the wall. Before I even understood the concept of a ‚Äútravel bucket list‚Äù, Greece was my numero 1.\n\nFast fast forward 12 years; summer 2016. This past August, I finally had the opportunity to get there. OPA! However, after fantasizing about that ever-so-famous picture of Santorini, I realized that that‚Äôs actually not the Greece I longed for. Why? It‚Äôs a DLD.\n\nDisney Land Destination (DLD): [diz-nee-land des-tin-ay-shun]\n\nNOUN. A ridiculously gorgeous travel destination that you‚Äôve probably seen photos of in guide books, calendars and in my case, Greek diners. They are always perfectly maintained, overrun by tourists and every local speaks English. (-AWC original vocabulary)\n\nNow, I‚Äôve ridden gondolas in Venice‚Äòs tiny water alleys. I‚Äôve visited Morocco‚Äôs oh-so ‚Äúbluetiful‚Äù Chefchaouen. I‚Äôve eaten Belgium chocolate in the fairytale streets of Bruges.\n\nAfter my fair share of picture-perfect DLD‚Äôs, I wanted the real deal for my trip to Greece. I wanted fat old Greek men drinking ouzo and yelling ‚ÄúOPA!‚Äù in a grungy tavern. I wanted to see sun burnt fisherman hauling a boat load of fresh fish from the Aegean Sea at 6 am. I wanted to be forced to try and use my non-existent Greek to get around.\n\nYASSAS! Here‚Äôs where I went.\n\nHora Sfakion\n\nA 200 person fishing village in the southern tip of Crete.\n\nLOST & FOUND: A paradise!! Come and claim it! This tiny lil‚Äô town is truly a scene out of a Greek fairytale. I stayed here for a few nights, using the little town as my base. Its one strip of ancient white houses and taverns align the electric blue, crystal clear Libyan Sea. Here, there is no such thing as a ‚Äúnon-ocean view‚Äù. It‚Äôs got 6 taverns, a bakery, a supermarket, a beach and extremely friendly Greeks. What more could ya‚Äô need?!\n\nMust-try: The locally adored ‚ÄúSfakian Pie‚Äù. A crepe-like pancake stuffed with local cheese and topped with honey. Yes puh-lease!\n\nLoutro\n\nA 20-min boat‚Äôs ride from Hora Sfakion, this picturesque 50-house village is only accessible by boat. That‚Äôs right‚Ä¶there are no roads!\n\nThis mini village only has about 50 houses, most of which have been converted into hotels. Surprisingly, I discovered it‚Äôs far more touristic than our dearly beloved Hora Sfakion. Nevertheless, it was probably one of the most charming, breathtakingly beautiful places I‚Äôve been to in MY LIFE. Hop off the boat and sneak away to the right of the village, where you‚Äôll find secluded cliffs that hang over the aqua blue Libyan Sea, looking back at quaint lil‚Äô Loutro. My suggestion? Post up here for a couple of hours, then head to‚Ä¶.\n\nYour must-try! MADARES Taverna. This fish taverna is the only restaurant in town that has its very own fisherman, whom wakes up at the crack O‚Äô dawn to catch YOUR fish. And lemme tell ya‚Äô: these guys know how to grill up a mean fishy.\n\nTop√≤lia\n\nA mountain village tucked away in the interior of the island, whose cliff-hanging taverns are worth the detour. And its baklava.\n\nI was passing through the village on my way back from Elafonisi and my ‚Äúholy-crap-so-cute village radar‚Äù went off ; I couldn‚Äôt resist getting out of the car to explore! It‚Äôs made up of one tiny little street and a handful of taverns that look like they‚Äôre going to go tumbling off the cliff if you jump too hard. My advice? DON‚ÄôT JUMP! Or look down üòâ\n\nMust try: You guessed it. The baklava at Spiliaraki. It‚Äôs TO DIE FOR. Yes. I‚Äôd jump off the cliff for it.\n\nAnd finally, the more known (must-see!) spots.\n\nChania (pronounced Hania)\n\nThe second biggest city in Crete after Heraklion, but by far the more charming one!\n\nChania‚Äôs old town is jam packed with tiny winding streets, artsy Greek taverns tucked away in leafy nooks and live Cretan music bursting from every corner. Not to mention, its picturesque port and lighthouse whose reflection sparkle off the bright blue water! As Crete‚Äôs second biggest city, tourists are unavoidable. However, interestingly enough, I found most of the tourists to be Greek!\n\nMust-try: Koutourouki , an adorable, affordable Cretan restaurant with awesome hippie-vibes. Get the grilled feta cheese and smoked pork apaki (a typical Cretan dish). But really, that grilled feta‚Ä¶.IT‚ÄôS‚Ä¶SO‚Ä¶GOOOD.\n\nBalos Lagoon\n\nThe most beautiful piece of nature I think I‚Äôve ever seen.\n\nWarning: THE HIKE TO GET THERE IS INTENSE. But I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it‚Ä¶\n\nElafonisi\n\nMagical pink sand, electric blue crystal water.\n\nMust I say more?\n\nMy dream-land of Greece couldn‚Äôt have exceeded my little girl, starry eyed expectations more. Do I regret not seeing the real-life version of that famous picture of Santorini I grew up admiring? Well, look at me! Whattya think?\n\nNow, I‚Äôm just hungry for MORE! Greece, the AWC will be BACK! Until then, look out for my next post on Cretan foodie fun facts . If you go to Greece, and especially Crete, you must know these üòâ\n\nOPA! Have you explored non-touristy Greece?
