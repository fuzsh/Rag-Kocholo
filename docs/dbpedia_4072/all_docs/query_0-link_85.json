        "text": "Chora Sfakion\n\nA small fishing village located in the south of Crete, in a secluded place on the coast of the Libyan Sea. The population of Chora Sfakion is only 400 people and the locals are famous for their conservatism and peculiar character. This is a very unusual village with its own history, traditions, cuisine and, of course, its own charm. True Cretans live here.\n\nLocal taverns offer traditional Cretan and Sfakian dishes. Only here can be prepared real Sfakian pies stuffed with local cheese, Sfakian lamb or Sfakian salad. You can always taste freshly caught fish from the Libyan Sea in any tavern of Chora Sfakion.\n\nWhat should be remembered when visiting this city?\n\n• be extremely careful not to provoke conflicts. The locals are very hot-tempered.\n\n• be very careful on the road, the main part of the road is a mountain serpentine.\n\nFrom the city of Chora Sfakion, you can also go to Anopolis and Francostello, if you have time.\n\nAnopolis and Vardinoyannis Bridge\n\nAnopolis is a village located west of Chora Sfakion on a plateau with impressive views of the White Mountains. The plateau is located at an altitude of about 600 meters above sea level. In 1986, at the expense of a wealthy family, the Vardinoyannis automobile bridge was built across the Aradena gorge, which connected the most remote villages of Agios Ioanis and Aradena with neighboring Anopolis and Chora Sfakion. The bridge offers breathtaking views of the gorge and the surrounding area.\n\nFrangocastello\n\nVenetian fortress and village in Greece in the south of Crete. The fortress is a square castle with four towers at the corners, the best preserved in Crete. The castle was built by the Venetians in 1371-1374 to protect against pirates and to restore order in the Sfakia region. The Venetians named the fortress – the Castle of St. Nikita, after the name of a nearby church (the ruins of this church can be seen not far from the castle). However, the locals called the castle Frangokastelo, which literally means “castle of the Franks” (foreigners).\n\nThere is a beautiful sandy beach with not deep sea right in front of the castle.\n\nThe heavenly corner of Greece, the city of Chania, is located in the western part of Crete – the greenest area on the map of the island. The magnificence of views and the diversity of landscapes, cozy parks, original architecture and the magical flavor of the past – you can list for a long time, but it’s better to see it all with your own eyes at least once. The former capital and second largest city of Crete attracts tourists from all over the world with its unique mixture of Venetian, Ottoman, Byzantine and Greek cultures.\n\nBalos beach\n\nOne of the most inaccessible beaches in Crete. What is unique about the beach? Firstly, the fact that here you can count dozens of water shades, and secondly, the fact that three seas meet right in this place: the Ionian, Aegean and Libyan. The number of shades of blue and the purity of the water are simply amazing.\n\nUsually Balos beach is visited in a complex with the pirate island of Gramvousa, on top of which the remains of the Venetian fort have been preserved.\n\nThe fortress of Gramvousa has been preserved in very good condition to these days, and it can be visited by sailing on pleasure boats that run daily to Gramvousa and Balos from the port of Kissamos. A fascinating journey to the island of Imeri Gramvousa lasts about an hour.\n\nElafonissi beach\n\nAn elongated peninsula, which is washed by water from two sides and gives the impression of a separate island and is a protected area. Endangered Careta Careta turtles and several rare bird species nest on the island. Exotic beaches with pink and white sand, and turquoise water, forming on both sides of the peninsula, are reminiscent of the waters of the Caribbean.\n\nIn conclusion, it would be good to note that 5 km. north of Elafonissi, there is the monastery of Chrysoskalitissa. This monastery was built on a high rock, resembling a fortress. According to legend, the last step of the staircase leading to the Golden Monastery can be seen only by those who truly believe in God.\n\nThe first stop along the route is the Palace of Knossos, one of the most impressive monuments of Cretan architecture. It is it’s image that adorns Crete guidebooks, postcards and souvenirs. Often, it is the Palace of Knossos that is considered as the very labyrinth where a terrible creature with a human body and a bull’s head lived, devouring people and instilling fear in the Greeks. According to the myth, when Theseus went to the labyrinth to look for a monster, the king’s daughter Ariadne gave the hero a magic ball. After killing the Minotaur, Theseus was able to get out, finding his way along the thread that marked his path along the road.\n\nPhaistos Palace\n\nOne of the four most significant palaces of Crete. The history of the city of Festus begins in the Neolithic era. Scientists are surprised to find ancient artifacts, even entire houses from this period. Not without reason, many of them believe that the famous sunken Atlantis was located in this part of Greece, and the Minoan civilization is the civilization of the Atlanteans.\n\nExcavations of the palace began in 1900, the famous archaeologist Federico Halberra worked here. There were found amazing antiquities under his leadership. The most famous archaeological find of Phaistos is the Phaistos disc, a small object in the form of a coin with hieroglyphic inscriptions twisted into a spiral. The age of this sacred object is approximately 3700 years. The meaning and purpose of the inscription has not been determined so far, but it has been reliably established that it was not cut out on the disk, but printed on it in a typographical way. Now on the place of the Phaistos Palace there is an archaeological site where you can see everything that has been preserved with your own eyes.\n\nMatala beach\n\nOne of the most popular places in Crete. In the Minoan era, according to scientists, Matala was the port of the city of Festus – one of the main centers of the Minoan civilization.\n\nMatala is located at the exit of a small valley, where has formed a large closed bay overlooking the islands of Paximadia. In front of the bay there is a beautiful 300m long sandy beach with fine gravel and clear water. Due to the frequent westerly wind, there are stone slabs and waves placed at the bottom. In addition, on the northern side of the beach there is a large cave, from the top of which the very brave ones jump into the water.\n\nThe most characteristic feature of the area is lots of caves, carved into the soft white limestone thousands of years ago, which are located in the northwestern part of the beach. There are many underwater caves also. It is believed that the caves at Matala were Roman and Christian era tombs. However, many of them have rooms, stairs, windows, and beds, suggesting that prehistorically they functioned as homes.\n\nIn Matala and in these caves, hippies found their paradise in the 60s and 70s when they gathered in thousands to express their freedom, their opinions and enjoy love"
