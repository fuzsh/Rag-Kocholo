        "text": "Do you want a taste of a timeless, traditional Greek village destination, combined with sublime swimming in some of the most beautiful coastlines of Crete?\n\nThen this is the trip for you.\n\nCrete, with its rich 9000 year history established the first ever civilization in Europe. A melting pot of ancient cultures, the “world” as Homer called it, is a must-visit destination for the open water swimmer. Along with our local Cretan guides and contacts, we have sourced a unique swimming location that combines dramatic scenery, ancient ruins, beautiful local food and of course crystal clear seas. The Minoan Trail swimming is based in the picturesque traditional Greek village of Sfakia and swimmers stay at Sfakian Horizon Hotel, a quiet location at the top of the village, offering excellent views of the bay below. This series of swims take place along the untamed coastline of south Crete,\n\nThis 7-day, approximately 5K swim per day sea safari starts on Saturday and finishes the following Saturday morning. We will greet you on your arrival on Saturday evening with a welcoming drink and an introduction to safety by our Crete based team. As part of this trip there will also be an optional opportunity for a filmed swimming analysis and open water swimming technique tips. During the week you will have the chance to explore dozens of caves, relax on remote beaches and peruse the gorges that have shaped this rugged, mountainous coastline with its churches and ancient ruins. Each day we swim a piece of the trail and we also stop for lunch at hand-picked seaside tavernas with extraordinary surroundings that specialise in local cuisine. The forgotten ancient waterside cities of Tara and Finix as well as some of the landscape can be visited on foot during lunchtime (not a guided tour).\n\nBy the end of an idyllic seven day tour you will have swum all the way from Ayia Roumeli, past Sfakia to the Vritomartis Beach, a distance of approximately 24K and will have completed The Minoan Trail, experiencing the unique natural wonder that is Southern Crete.\n\nWhat is included in the holiday\n\nThe trip starts on your arrival at the hotel at Sfakian Horizon. On your arrival day you will be welcomed and in the evening have a chance to meet your fellow swimmers and be briefed on the week’s itinerary and safety issues over relaxing complimentary drinks.\n\nOn the first day of the trip our guides/coaches will video your swimming technique for an analysis session. We then view this with you and offer advice on achieving a more efficient, injury-free stroke. Individual advice can also be given during the swims.\n\nBreakfast is offered every morning at the hotel and we will then travel in the traditional Greek boat to the swimming location (which is different every day). We will escort the swimming groups with the support boats and drinks will be offered at regular intervals during the swim. The boats will be manned by fully qualified first aid experienced swimmers who will keep a watch over you.\n\nYou will be given a Crete-theme Big Blue T-shirt, a water bottle and a swimming hat to use and keep and we have a range of snorkelling gear and fins you can borrow for exploring in caves or along coastlines.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOn Arrival: Complimentary drink, T-shirt, Water bottle\n\n1st Day: Individual underwater video, Individual stroke analysis, Swimming hat\n\n7 nights’ Hotel accommodation\n\nBreakfast\n\n3 motorised boats (One main and 2 auxiliary)\n\n3 qualified swim guides\n\nLocal boat captain\n\nCold drinks along the swims\n\nVariety of snacks at the end of each swim\n\nTravel Information\n\nThe closest airport that feeds our Sfakia base, is Chania International airport (North-West Crete) which is well connected with many airports from all over the world.\n\nAfter arrival, we recommend that you catch a taxi from the airport to our hotel, sharing with other swimmers; this costs 100 euros per taxi ride and takes approximately 1 hour 20 mins. The taxis are big and comfortable and can take up to 4 people (luggage allowing!). You can pre-book your taxi at info@taxisfakia.com (taxisfakia.com) and for larger parties, for 5-8 people there are ‘taxi minibuses’ and please email them for updated prices.\n\nPLEASE NOTE. The welcome briefing takes place on the first Saturday at either 7.00 pm or 7.30 pm (we will let you know well in advance) at our hotel in Sfakia (Sfakian-Horizon)) so please book your flights accordingly so that you can attend.\n\nAlternatively, you will need to get a bus or taxi from Chania airport to Chania coach station situated in Chania City Centre and then a coach to Hora Sfakion, or simply Sfakia, which will cost slightly less but increase the travel time. The reverse can be repeated for the travel back.\n\nThere are other ways you can reach us and apart from Chania, Rethimno and Heraklio would be the closest major towns with airports. For specific travel information please email us with your query info@thebigblueswim.com or call our office on +44-1905-978028 and we will be glad to assist.\n\nRECOMMENDED. If you have a day or so to spare before or after your trip, we highly recommend that you stay in Chania Town and in particular around the old city. A modern and bustling place nowadays, Chania has a long and turbulent history and this is clearly evident in its ruined fortifications and forgotten alleyways. As a visitor you can stroll in its cobbled pedestrianised streets, visit museums or simply have a coffee and sample the distinct Cretan cuisine in one of many places dotted around the sea front. The imposing Venetian harbour with its old, decommissioned arched boatyards is a must for the visitor whilst the old Ottoman architecture can still be seen all around the area. You will not be disappointed!"
