        "text": "General information\n\nThe unspoiled and historical village of Sfakia is built on hill slopes, overlooking a natural bay. It’s a quiet seaside village, situated around the White Mountains mountain range, not so far from the famous Samaria Gorge. Sfakia lies 72 km southeast of Chania Town, close to the end of the Imbros Gorge. It was built around a harbor, and from there, you can admire an endless view of the Libyan Sea. Most of its inhabitants are involved in tourism, fishing, goat farming, and producing different types of delightful cheese, such as anthotiro or mizithra. The local farms are also among the major exporters of meat to Athens.\n\nDISCOVER THE VILLAGES WITH YOUR OWN CAR!\n\nWe offer the best prices and our service is rated\n\nRent your car with us\n\nThe village is known for its local cuisine, and a few excellent restaurants can be found on the seafront and inside Chora. The picturesque harbor of Sfakia is surrounded by many cafes and fish taverns, where you can test Cretan specialties made with fresh, local ingredients. During your visit, don't forget to also try the savory Cretan wine. In addition, you can also find a bakery with delicious cheese pies and shops that sell high-quality dairy products. You can also try the local Sfakian pie.\n\nYou can find nice, cozy hotels near Sfakia Beach and at a small distance from the village center. Most are traditional but recently renovated and offer an endless view of the blue sea and the dazzling horizon.\n\nBrief History and Places of Historical Interest\n\nThe name Sfakia originates from the ancient Greek word Sfax, which means “divide land,\" because of the many gorges that can be found in the area. No trace of inhabitants during ancient times has been found, and the oldest building of the village dates between the 15th and 16th centuries. It is a castle located on the hill, north of the harbor castle, called Sfakia. In the Venetian period, up until the village was conquered by the Turks, the inhabitants were mostly involved in trading and shipping, which were flourishing during that time.\n\nSfakia is a place that has gone through many hardships throughout its history. It was destroyed during the Daskalogiannis Revolution in 1770 and the Greek Revolution in 1821. A century later, in 1943, the village was invaded and burned down by the Nazis.\n\nThere are points of interest you can visit in Sfakia that are historically significant to the locals, but the most prominent one is a memorial monument to those executed by the Nazis. On October 8th, 1943, a large Nazi force invaded the village and arrested and executed 19 men and 8 women before taking all the goods from the people and setting the whole village on fire. On the tall monument made out of marble are written the 27 names of those who were killed that day. Below, inside a glassed enclosure, there are some of their skulls and bones. On the left side, we can see 20 names of people from Kallikratris village who fought and were killed in the fonts of Macedonia, Asia Minor, and Albania.\n\nWhat to do\n\nThe main town of Sfakia is an excellent place to start your exploration of the southern coast of Crete. The village is very traditional and authentic, and its calm atmosphere is only interrupted during the afternoon by the arrivals of hikers coming from the Samaria Gorge with small boats. In order to easily and comfortably explore the wild beauty of the area and admire the mesmerizing landscape, it is recommended that you have your own car."
