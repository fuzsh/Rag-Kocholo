        "text": ".\n\nThe Sfakians (or Sphakians) are the Greek inhabitants of the region of Sfakia located in western Crete. The Sfakians deem themselves as the direct descendants of the Dorians who invaded the island around 1100 BC. For centuries, the Sfakians have been able to preserve their Greek identity in the face of numerous foreign invaders. Moreover, they have been deemed by many who have faced them in battle as courageous warriors.\n\nSfakians and Saracens\n\nWhen the Saracen Arabs invaded Crete in 824 AD, many regions of the island (including Sfakia) did not experience Arab rule being that much of the island itself was (and still is) mountainous. The Sfakians established a form of self-government known as the Gerousia (or \"Council of Wisemen\"). The members of the council were either known as Gerontes (\"Wisemen\") or Dimogerontes (\"The People's Wisemen\") who were selected based on the general consensus of the members of the entire community.\n\nNicephorus Phocas, general of the Greek Byzantine forces sent to liberate Crete, appointed large numbers of Sfakian warriors to defend the rear of his forces against possible Arab attacks from the south. The general needed the strong defense of the Sfakian warriors in order to concentrate on taking the fortress of Chandax by siege. Chandax was a key target in Phocas' campaign being that it was both an Arab fortress and the capital of Crete under Arab rule.\n\nThe Sfakians not only managed to defend General Phocas' troops, but they also supported him in the very siege of Chandax. Chandax fell on March 7, 961 AD, which marked the end of Arab rule in Crete. General Phocas was so grateful for the contributions of the Sfakians that he gave the Gerontes many presents which included weapons, ammunition, and lavish clothing. Moreover, the general allowed the Sfakians the right to continue with their own form of self-government with the added benefit of being exempt from all taxes. However, when General Phocas became the emperor of the Byzantine Empire, he reconfirmed the privileges he once gave to the Sfakians.\n\nPeace in Byzantine Crete\n\nAt the dawn of the second Byzantine period in Crete (961 AD - 1204 AD), the island itself was in a state of devastation. Many of the inhabitants were sold to slave markets, the economy was in ruins, and the administrative structure of government had no presence on the island. The Greek Byzantines immediately started to rebuild fortifications on the island in order to guard against future attacks. Also, they placed a new administrative system that divided the island into a number of provinces that appointed their own governors.\n\nA new period of cultural and economic renewal began to emerge in Crete. Christianity in Crete was undergoing revival thanks to missionaries such as Saint Niko \"Metanoite\" (\"Repent\") and Saint Ioannis Xenos. The local population grew and further assistance was provided by Emperor Alexius Comnenus I. In 1080 AD, the emperor ordered the migration and settlement of Greek Byzantine families in Crete.\n\nEmperor Alexius Comnenus II, grandson of Alexius Comnenus I, issued an imperial order that appointed twelve princes from the Byzantine Empire to govern Crete. Each prince was given an extensive area to control, which divided Crete into twelve separate areas. Each prince was known as an \"Archondopoulo\" and he would arrive with his extended family to settle in the area allocated to him. From this event, a number of great aristocratic families of Crete emerged, some of them still in existence today. The Archondopouli of Crete entailed the families of Kallergis, Skordilis, Melisseni, Varouchi, Mousouri, Vlasti, Hortatzi, and others.\n\nSfakia itself was allocated to the emperor's nephew, Marinos Skordilis, who came to Crete with nine of his brothers who also brought over their sons and families. The borders of Skordilis' territory ranged from Askyfou east to Koustogerako and along the south coast to Agia Roumeli, Omprosgialos (today's Hora Sfakion) and to Frangokastello (the largest town in Skordilis' territory was Anopoli and many Sfakian families today claim to be direct descendants of the original Skordilises).\n\nIoannis Phocas, a direct descendant of General Phocas who freed Crete from the Arabs and later became emperor, was considered to be the most senior member of the twelve \"Archontopoula.\" His territory was one of the largest, which covered the greater part of todayâs province of Rethymno all the way south to the coast and westward up to the valley of Askyfou where the border of the Skordilis' territory was located (the name of the family changed a few years later under the Venetians to Kallergis and families that today claim to be direct descendants of the Phocas/Kallergis dynasty are one of the largest family groups in Crete, including a number from Sfakia).\n\nRevolts against Venice\n\nRebellions (1212 AD - 1283 AD)\n\nDuring Venetian rule in Crete (1204 AD - 1669 AD), the Greek inhabitants of the island rebelled at least twenty-seven times (without counting any of the other smaller local uprisings). Some of these revolutions lasted for years and were eventually suppressed by the Venetians with great brutality. Many of these revolutions sprang out of the \"Lefka Ori\" (or \"White Mountains\"), which was a Sfakian stronghold. Many of the revolutionaries were led by members of the \"Archondopoula\" families, especially members of the Sfakian-based families of Skordilis and Phocas/Kallergis.\n\nThere occurred over fourteen insurrections between 1207 AD and 1365 AD The first rebellion occurred in 1212 AD against Venetian resettlement that was started by the Ghiostephanites or Argyropouli. However, it was quickly quelled by Venice. In 1217 AD, another revolt occurred that was caused by a private dispute over stolen horses between the noble Skordilis and the Venetian Castellan. The revolt spread rapidly, but a treaty was made and signed between a new Duke and the rebels. Another large rebellion occurred in 1230 AD in the Rethymno area as a result of the gathering of the noble clans of Skordilis, Melisseni, and Drakontopouli. The rebellion went on for six years until Venice conceded much land and many garrisons in order to bring the revolt to an end. Venice, from this point on, had its hands full with Crete.\n\nOver the next few decades starting in 1212 AD, the Venetians began to resettle numerous noble families from Venice in order to acquire better control over Crete. Chandax was renamed Candia (today's Heraklion) and became the seat of the Duke of Candia. The duke was appointed for a two-year term by Venice and the island was known as the \"Regno di Candia\" or the \"Kingdom of Crete.\" In 1252 AD, Chania was built on the ancient city of Kydonia by the Venetians and Crete was divided into six provinces (sexteria). Eventually, the six provinces became four counties, but Sfakia always remained out of the direct control of the Venetians who maintained only a small garrison at the castle at Omprosgialos (today's Hora Sfakion). The Venetians would rarely venture outside of their castle walls.\n\nIn 1273 AD, the Hortatzi brothers became the leaders of a great rebellion. The revolt lasted for six years and the costs to the Venetians were heavy. However, the Cretan nobleman, Alexios Kallergis, was lured by the promises given to him by the Venetians and he eventually supported them. The Venetian attack against the Hortatzi brothers was decisive and in 1279 AD, the entire rebellion was crushed.\n\nThe Venetians did not keep their promises to Alexios Kallergis and were unfortunately very cruel in their treatment of the Cretan rebels. As a result, Kallergis started one of the largest and most destructive rebellions against the Venetians in 1283 AD. After sixteen years of fighting, the Venetians and Kallergis secretly negotiated an end to the rebellion with numerous concessions made on both sides. In return for the Venetian concessions that entailed the allowing of mixed marriages (in which such a \"privilege\" did not persuade the Sfakians and Cretans to perceive the Venetians any more favorably) and the placing of a Greek bishopric, Kallergis would swear allegiance to Venice.\n\nThe Chrysomalousa revolution (1319 AD)\n\nOne of the major Sfakian revolutions against Venetian rule was the Chrysomalousa Revolution of 1319 A.D. The Venetian garrison maintained at Omprosgialos at Sfakia consisted of only fifteen soldiers and an officer. These troops were merely keeping an eye out on the Sfakians, but rarely did they venture outside and they never interfered in Sfakian affairs. Capuleto, the Venetian officer in charge of the garrison, was attracted one day by a young girl at the well of the village. He approached the young girl and kissed her. She slapped Capuleto in the face, but he managed to pull out a dagger and cut some of the girl's golden hair. The girl's name was Chrisi Skordilis and she was from the Archondopoula family of the Skordilises. She was also called \"Chrysomalousa\" (or \"Golden Hair\") due to her blond hair. Upon hearing what happened to Chrisi, her relatives immediately killed the offending Venetian officer and most of the guards. Venetian troops arrived soon from Chania and the locals fought the Venetians bravely throughout the district. The revolution went on for more than a year until Archondas Kallergis intervened and had reached a peace treaty with the Venetians. The peace treaty entailed an agreement for the withdrawal of the Venetian forces from the area and an end to hostilities.\n\nRebellions (1332 AD - 1371 AD)\n\nMore rebellions against the Venetians broke out in 1332 AD in Margarites and in 1341 AD in Apokoronas. In Amari, Sfakia, Mesara and elsewhere throughout the island, the Cretans succeeded in winning for themselves many new benefits. As a result of the harsh treatment Venice had toward its colony, both Cretans and Venetians revolted in 1362 AD. They overthrew Venetian rule and declared a Cretan Republic under the flag of St. Titus, who had Christianized the island thirteen centuries before the rise of the Republic. A new rebellion occurred in 1365 AD and it was crushed by Venice to the point where life in Crete was very miserable.\n\nThe Venetians decided to build a castle on the fertile plains east of Sfakia where they intended to place a strong military presence in order to protect Venetian nobles and their properties. This decision was a result of the constant incursions the Venetians were experiencing on the southern coast of Crete from pirates (some of whom were Sfakians). The castle itself would also serve to protect the Venetians from the Sfakians who lived in the mountains north and west of the plains and who were harassing Venetian nobles. In 1371 AD, a Venetian fleet with soldiers and builders arrived on the fertile plain to begin construction on the castle. However, the local Sfakians were against having a castle on their territory. The Sfakians, under the leadership of the six Patsos brothers from the nearby settlement of Patsianos, would destroy every night what the Venetians built during the day. Eventually, the Venetians were forced to bring in additional troops that surrounded the whole area during the whole period that the castle was being built. The Patsos brothers, ready to resume their campaigns against the Venetians, were unfortunately betrayed, arrested and ultimately hanged at the site of the castle. In 1374 AD, the castle was complete, but the Sfakians were not threatened in their stronghold by the Venetian troops who much preferred to be stationed at the castle looking out for pirates instead of trying to establish control over the Sfakians.\n\nWar of the chickens (1470 AD)\n\nAnother major Sfakian revolution was known as the \"Ornithopolemos\" (or the \"War of the Chickens\"), which occurred in 1470 AD This revolution was caused by the pressures the Venetians were placing on the Cretans in order to extract additional tax revenues. A new tax was introduced requiring all Cretan families to provide one well-fed chicken every month to the Venetian in charge of their area. As time went by and Cretan families began to multiply, the number of chickens demanded was increasing and arguments began to start about the correct amount of chickens that should be given to the Venetian in charge of the area. Some villages started giving eggs rather than chickens on the basis that the Venetians would hatch the eggs themselves. Legal action was taken by the Venetians against the villagers for short payment, as well as against the Sfakians who were refusing to pay the tax altogether. Eventually, the Venetians issued over 10,000 indictments. The Sfakians, in return, compiled a report charging the Venetian authorities of corruption and sent the report to Chania for dispatch to Venice. The authorities at Chania imprisoned the Sfakian who brought the report and as a result, the Sfakians declared a revolution and encouraged the rest of the Cretans to refuse the tax. The revolution lasted for three years and at the end of the fighting, the Venetians agreed to withdraw the tax from the whole island, as well as withdraw all outstanding legal actions.\n\nKantanoleon's revolution (1527 AD or 1570 AD)\n\nThere occurred yet another Sfakian revolution that became a part of Cretan mythology since the publication of a book in 1872 known as \"The Cretan Weddings\" by a Cretan writer and historian named Zambelios. The full historical events have never been proven, but there are Venetian records that substantiate large parts of the overall story. However, the records do not fully explain why the wedding was proposed in the first place and by whom. The name of this major uprising was called Kantanoleon's Revolution and the Cretan Weddings. The protagonists of this revolution were George Kantanoleon (who came from the small village of Koustogerako north of Sougia), his son Petros, Francesco Molino (a Venetian noble from Chania), and Sophia (Molino's daughter). Although Kantanoleon came from Koustogerako, a small village just outside of today's province of Sfakia, the village itself was on the border of the Sfakian territory owned by Archondopoulo Skordilis. Kantanoleon was also from the family of Skordilis (some sources also claim that his correct surname was Skordilis and that the surname \"Kantanoleon\" was given to him by the Venetians).\n\nSome time before 1527 AD (or 1570 AD according to another source), a large number of families from western Crete decided to meet at the monastery of Saint John at Akrotiri in order to revolt against their Venetian rulers. This meeting came into order as a result of the unbearable taxes the Venetians placed on the Cretans, as well as the brutal treatment the Cretans dealt with from their rulers. At the monastery, the families elected George Kantanoleon as head of a new government. Following a number of successful battles against the Venetians at Impros Gorge near Rethymno and at Samaria Gorge at Lasithi, the Venetians withdrew to Chania, allowing the new Cretan independent government total freedom in governing all of western Crete. Kantanoleon established his headquarters at Meskla at the foot of the Lefka Ori, which was about 15 kilometers south of Chania. There, he set up proper government processes that included a more acceptable level for collecting taxes.\n\nThe events that followed are subject to debate. Zambelios, in his book \"The Cretan Weddings\", claims that Petros (Kantanoleon's son) fell in love with Sophia (Molinoâs daughter) and that Molino conspired with the Duke of Candia to trap and exterminate all of the revolutionaries. Molino's plan entailed the arrangement of a marriage between his daughter and Petros in which the invitees at the wedding will be arrested and the protagonists of the rebellion will be killed. A Venetian historian, however, stated that it was Kantanoleon that tried to impose a reconciliation between Cretans and the noble Venetian families of western Crete by arranging the marriage of his son to Molino's daughter thus trying to establish a new dynasty to govern western Crete.\n\nBoth historians agree on the events that transpired at the wedding. The wedding itself had a large number of invited Cretan guests and traditional festivities had large amounts of wine consumed (spiced with opium according to Zambelios). Eventually, all of the guests were surrounded by Venetian troops that came secretly from Chania, Rethymno, and Candia. The troops arrested both Kantanoleon and his son Petros and hanged them on the spot together with more than thirty other Cretan nobles. The rest of the prisoners, ranging in the hundreds, were divided into four groups and one was hanged at the gates of Chania, one at Koutsogerako, one on the road from Chania to Rethymno, and one at Meskla (the headquarters of the rebel government). Yet, the atrocities did not stop there being that whole villages were destroyed including Koutsogerako, Meskla, and a few others. The atrocities continued for some time and quite a few Cretan leaders and their families fled up to the mountains and stayed there for some time until eventually an amnesty was issued.\n\nSfakians and the fall of Constantinople\n\nIn January 1453 AD, Sultan Mehmet II had the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople, surrounded. He decided that he was going to take it over either by breaking through the cityâs defenses or by starving the inhabitants into submission. The sultan had his troops and an enormous fleet at his disposal while the besieged Byzantines (and their Christian allies) were demoralized and divided amongst themselves. Responding to a request for help from the Byzantine Emperor, the Sfakian leader Manousos Kallikratis gathered 300 Sfakian warriors and another 760 Cretan fighters from other parts of the island. The leader then sailed in five ships (three of which were Sfakian) and went to help the besieged Emperor.\n\nThe Sfakian/Cretan forces fought valiantly by breaking through the Ottoman blockade and by defending the city itself. Many Cretans died alongside the Byzantines, as well as alongside the few Genoese and Venetian co-defenders. When the city fell, the only 170 surviving Cretans had been surrounded by Ottoman troops in one of the cityâs towers and were refusing to surrender. The sultan was so impressed by their courage and fierce fighting skills that he agreed to let them walk out of the city with their flags, arms, and wounded and sail away to Crete in one of their ships.\n\nA poet of the time has the Byzantine Emperor saying as he was surrounded by the Ottomans, \"Christians, Greeks, cut off my head, take it, good Cretans, and carry it to Crete, for the Cretans to see it and be sad at heart.\" Just a few words from an anonymous poet described the deep impact the fall of Constantinople had on the Cretans. They were to become the next home of the refugees from Byzantium and responsible for nurturing the rich heritage left to them by the collapsing Byzantine Empire.\n\nAgainst the Ottomans\n\nDuring the Ottoman occupation of Crete (1669 AD â 1898 AD), the Greeks looked towards Christian Russia as its savior. Peter the Great, as part of his plan to expand southward to the Black Sea, was deemed as a champion of the Christians residing in the Haimos Peninsula. His overall policy, with some variations, was continued by Catherine the Great (1762 AD â 1796 AD) in her wars against the Ottoman Turks. She dreamed of resurrecting the Byzantine Empire and placing her son as its emperor. She decided to send Russian agents to Morea in the Peloponnesos in order to stir up the Greeks to fight against the Turks. One of the Russian agents reached a man named Daskaloyiannis and told the Sfakian from Anopoli to lead a revolt. This was ill advice since the Sfakians, let alone the Cretans in general, were hardly ready for such a revolt being that they had virtually no weapons.\n\nYet, Daskaloyiannis and his Cretan followers started a revolt in 1770 AD and were hoping that they would gain military support from Russia. However, when the Russo-Turkish conflict can to an end, the revolutionary Cretans were abandoned and they were up against Turkish troops from Chania, Rethymno, and Heraklion. The pasha of Crete had captured the brother and daughters of Daskaloyiannis and with the promise of leniency he demanded that Daskaloyiannis surrender. Daskaloyiannis decided to surrender so that he could see his brother and daughters released. Most of the other leaders of the revolt were killed, and the pasha had Daskaloyiannis first tortured in order to provide any valuable strategic information. Naturally, Daskaloyiannis refused to surrender his people to the barbaric Turks. Even after the pasha had the Sfakian skinned alive strip by strip in front of hundreds summoned at a public square, Daskaloyiannis did not betray his people.\n\nNeither the failed revolt of 1770 AD nor the death of Daskaloyiannis went in vain being that both events aroused the national sentiments of all Cretans. The revolts made by the Cretans and the legendary Sfakians contributed to the rise of the independent Cretan state in 1898 AD, which also paved the way for Creteâs union with Greece in 1913 AD.\n\nIoannis Daskalogiannis (or Daskaloyiannis)\n\nLinks\n\nHistory of Crete and the Region of Sfakia\n\nBrief History of Crete\n\nAncient Greece\n\nScience, Technology , Medicine , Warfare, , Biographies , Life , Cities/Places/Maps , Arts , Literature , Philosophy ,Olympics, Mythology , History , Images\n\nMedieval Greece /Â Byzantine Empire\n\nScience, Technology, Arts, , Warfare , Literature, Biographies, Icons, History\n\nModern Greece\n\nCities, Islands, Regions, Fauna/Flora ,Biographies , History , Warfare, Science/Technology, Literature, Music , Arts , Film/Actors , Sport , Fashion\n\n---\n\nCyprus\n\nGreek-Library - Scientific Library\n\nRetrieved from \"http://en.wikipedia.org/\"\n\nAll text is available under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License\n\nGreece\n\nWorld\n\nIndex"
