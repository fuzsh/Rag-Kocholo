The artwork is whimsical, but the story for the most part goes along with the book. There will be a twist or two that may surprise the reader, but trust me, they are great! I enjoyed the original novel (a reprint, of course!) and this graphic novel is a joy to read. I will give this GN five stars. Petr Kopl has other graphic novels available, and I hope to read them all”\n\nAmazon USA Book Depository (free worldwide shipping)\n\nThe Strand Magazine (special offer)\n\nDaily Gazette – The biggest sensation of the 19th Century! A three-member expedition goes to the Amazon jungle to verify unreal and yet undocumented discoveries of Professor Challenger. Three heroes, Professor Summerlee, Lord Roxton and reporter Edward Malone, set off for what could be the greatest discovery of the century! Will our adventurers confirm the existence of a land full of prehistoric monsters, or return empty-handed? Will they return to this country alive and well? The only thing we know it is that shortly after their departure, Professor Challenger vanished from the city. Did he escape from embarrassment or is there something else going on?"
