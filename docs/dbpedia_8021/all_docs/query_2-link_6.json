Out of a large number of stories, only one is mine — a very short one in the middle of the book.\n\nYours faithfully ”\n\nA. Conan Doyle\n\nA letter from London, August 23rd 1912\n\n“ My dear Smith\n\nI got the Sherlock Holmes suggestion but not the other one. I fear I can't make anything of either of them. It's too delicate and getting too near to self advertisement. I'm glad to understand that the serial has not disappointed you.\n\nHome today.\n\nYours very sincerely ”\n\nA. Conan Doyle\n\nJanuary 17th 1898\n\n“ Dear Bram Stoker\n\nI made a little melodrama out of Sherlock Holmes and I put it in the hands of Addison Bright of 89 Comeragh Road, West Kensington, to act as my agent in the matter. I had to give him a free hand, and I understand that he has approached Mr Tree, but nothing, as far as I know, has been definitely arranged, and I have told Bright that Sir Henry had shown some interest in the idea, so if there is any hitch he will submit a copy to him.\n\nWith kindest regards\n\nYours very truly ”\n\nA. Conan Doyle"
