        "text": "June 2, 2013 8:09 AM Subscribe\n\nIn 1977, Lamont Dozier, Motown veteran, released his album Peddlin' Music on the Side, featuring \"the Afro-centric disco hit\" Going Back to My Roots. That sound was popular in the US, and also in South Africa, where veteran alto player Teaspoon Ndelu covered the song with his group Teaspoon & the Waves as Oh Yeh Soweto, \"changing the lyrics and toughening up the beat, but with the same killer riffs!\" The one fault with the song could be that it's only half as long as Lamont's original. Fear not, Dr. Horn has edited the track into an extended form, which you can stream or download from Soundcloud.\n\n\"Oh Yeh Soweto\" was released on the group's now-rare LP in 1980, but the track has made a comeback in recent years. One of the earlier appearances was on the 2010 UK compilation John Armstrong Presents South African Funk Experience, and it appeared on the a compilation from the Beatz and Carrots blog in 2011. This year, it was released both on a Sofrito Super Single (Sofrito, previously) and The Rough Guide to African Disco (compilation booklet PDF), which includes an embedded live video of Osibisa's Dance the Body Music.\n\nIf you're looking for more from Teaspoon Ndelu, you're in luck! The fantastic Electric Jive blog has a four-song LP from 1981, for your listening pleasure, and as much history on Ndelu as I've seen online, though I can add that it appears he has been credited as Teaspoon Ndlela at least twice, once for work on Gumboots from Paul Simon's Graceland, and then for Love is Just A Dream by Juluka.\n\nBut if what you really want is more free disco edits, check out Dr. Horn's soundcloud page. There doesn't seem to be more Afro-centric disco, but there are some great extended disco edits."
