The more artistically significant musicals, Strike Up The Band, Of Thee I Sing and Let Them Eat Cake are ambitious and sprawling musicals where the songs are telling the story very specifically. Listening to them debunks the old fairy tale about Rodgers and Hammerstein inventing the integrated musical in 1943. Anything Goes can be completely reorganized, the book rewritten, songs moved around, and it holds up, because the non-specificity of the material lends itself to updating. Of Thee I Sing can’t. For all intents and purposes, it’s a jazz age operetta, maybe even more integrated than Show Boat or Oklahoma.\n\nUnlike these later shows, Girl Crazy is a prime candidate for rewriting. The book is co-written by Guy Bolton, who had also co-written Anything Goes. Girl Crazy’s score also introduced Embraceable You, But Not For Me, and most iconically, I Got Rhythm. The other shows don’t have such a record of hits.\n\nBut as it turns out Girl Crazy is not as easily revisable as Anything Goes had been. A brand new book needed to be written, and Ken Ludwig was chosen for the task. In an interview in 2022, Ludwig explains:\n\n“When I read the old libretto to Girl Crazy, I realized that it was creaky and outdated, so I created a whole new story. I had absolute free rein to do what I wanted, and I didn’t feel any obligation to stick to Girl Crazy at all. In fact, the only really important thing I did retain was the idea of an easterner going west.“\n\nIn addition to those 3 iconic standards, Crazy for You uses 3 utility numbers from Girl Crazy. These are the parts that place the musical in the American Southwest.\n\nFour more songs in Crazy for You were drawn from the 1937 film A Damsel in Distress, which Gershwin had been working on when he died. I Can’t Be Bothered Now, Stiff Upper Lip, Things are Looking Up, and Nice Work if You Can Get It appeared first in this movie. Bobby’s show biz-oriented stuff almost all comes from Fred Astaire’s songs from this film.\n\nThree songs and an instrumental interlude come from another 1937 Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers vehicle, Shall We Dance. I will discuss these below in the context of the show.\n\nTwo songs; the title song K-r-a-z-y for You and What Causes That are from 1928’s Treasure Girl. Polly is also a character name from Treasure Girl.\n\nOne song, Someone To Watch Over Me, comes from 1926’s Oh, Kay!\n\nAnother, Naughty Baby, comes from 1924’s Primrose.\n\nThe Real American Folk Song was the very first Gershwin song to appear on Broadway, in 1918’s Ladies First.\n\nStairway to Paradise appears without lyrics in Crazy for You. It had originally appeared in George White’s Scandals in 1922.\n\nKen Ludwig had wanted to include Our Love is Here To Stay, the last song Gershwin wrote before his death, but he couldn’t figure out how to make it work in the story. I suspect it may have at one point been in the show as number 16. Ludwig enjoyed the process of converting the show so well, he later wrote an as-yet-unproduced adaptation of Irving Berlin’s Easter Parade.\n\nStructurally, the book to Crazy for You is strikingly similar to Ludwig’s other plays, setting up jokes and knocking them down as we work our way through a farce superstructure that feels somehow familiar, even though almost nobody ever uses it anymore. As the show runs, you may find yourself shaking your head at how well some of these very old Vaudeville style routines work.\n\nThe familiarity of it all may obscure some very clever things Ludwig does to the musical material, which the writers of modern jukebox musicals would do well to study. For example, Ludwig is rarely content to let a song function at face value. Complete songs are used as transitions, snippets of songs function as verses to set up even better songs, and sometimes a number of verses are reduced to just the ones that suit the setup best. Famous songs sometimes don’t even get a lyric. Stairway to Paradise functions very specifically in the show, even though the lyric is never sung. Creators of Jukebox musicals would do well to examine Ludwig’s method here.\n\nAfter a song has made its point, Ludwig hands the reins to the choreographer, and Stro does some of her best musical storytelling here, adding the ballet storytelling of Agnes DeMille into the musical world that chronologically preceded her groundbreaking work. This is a show that uses quite a lot of dance to tell the story, which makes the inclusion of so much Fred Astaire material so apt.\n\nDIGRESSION: There is an old narrative that Rodgers and Hammerstein revolutionized the American musical by ‘integrating’ the songs with the story, using the songs to advance the plot. This framing centers Rodgers and Hammerstein as the creators of the subsequent ‘golden era’. Again, songs integrated into story is as old as music theatre itself. It actually goes back all the way to the ancient Greeks. What makes Oklahoma! such an important show is not the integration of song into story but the elevation of dance to a central narrative role in a sung genre, something truly novel that even opera doesn’t explore to its fullest potential. If we were to truly understand this dynamic, we would recover the stories and importance of women in the creation of these shows, because women created both the choreography and the dance arrangements for many important shows in this era.\n\nWhat we have in Crazy for You is a show with the same goals as a real 20s-30s Broadway show, but with completely updated pacing and mechanics, reflecting 50 years of progress in musical storytelling, efficiently deploying music, lyrics and dance to ground the storytelling and advance the narrative.\n\nWhat makes this score sound so authentically Gershwin?\n\nTo explore this question, we need to understand some of the things that make up our modern conception of Gershwin’s sound, we will want to examine what Gershwin’s sound was really like in 1930, when Girl Crazy first hit the boards, then how that sound came to change, as reflected in Gershwin’s concert works and in big band arrangements of his music. In the videos below I examine the people involved in Crazy for You, why they were so well qualified to write in Gershwin’s manner. I’ll end by looking at an important example of Gershwin’s own influences. These questions provide an important cultural context for Crazy for You, but they also intersect with some larger elements of the changing landscape of American popular culture. I’ve converted my introductory thoughts into a couple of long-form videos so I can demonstrate what I’m talking about.\n\nShould your Organization do this show?\n\nNobody should program this show without a strong pit in mind. Tap shows need to be sustained by an overwhelming amount of musical energy, and it is exhausting to try to wring that energy from an undersized pit. At the end of this post, I give what advice I can about who to hire.\n\nNobody should do this show without a very strong group of dancers. The show is wall-to-wall tapping, and it’s not the kind of show you learn how to tap in. This is closer to 42nd Street than Thoroughly Modern Millie.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, it is possible to design a simpler version than the original specifications. We had very large set pieces for the Deadrock sequences, with a trick cuckoo clock, a car from which many dancers could emerge, and a section of the stage that hydraulically lifted at the end MGM style. The scene changes in the original production must have happened fast, because the scene change music is very brief. I will flag the places in the show where you are not likely to have enough music. I wrote brief connecting material for my production, but if you’re not in a position to do the same, you will want to be somewhat involved in the set discussions, so you can be aware of how challenging these transitions will be.\n\nWhen it’s firing on all pistons, it’s hard to beat Crazy for You in terms of pleasing a large audience.\n\nBefore You Start:\n\nListen to the Original Broadway Cast Recording and the London Cast Recording\n\nWatch the Papermill Playhouse production, which reproduces many details of the original production https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QxG8hTz5M0\n\nThe Piano Conductor Score\n\nThis score is reduced by Tams stalwart Dale S. Kugel. Kugel was, I am told, very well liked by his colleagues, but is the bane of rehearsal accompanists, because of his comically awkward reductions. His scores are always very well laid out, visually aesthetically pleasing, and relatively error free, and they always include all the relevant information needed to conduct. They also include, via note size and other indications, a way one might play the important notes with a single pianist. These indications are often hilariously impossible to execute (I’ve posted a number of TikToks about this) Sometimes they foreground unimportant information the onstage performer doesn’t need to hear, and downplay much more prominent musical cues. As I go through the show, I’ll be pointing out some of these issues. This show should be just as easy to play as a Rodgers and Hammerstein or Cole Porter show, but the reductions make it Jason Robert Brown level difficulty, and you will be hard-pressed to sight-read it.\n\nCasting the Show\n\nWith only a couple exceptions, nothing in Crazy for You is musically above average in difficulty for the cast. The 2nd act Finale is difficult, but easily simplified. The tapping is what will kill you. The Trio and the Follies girls will ideally have good ears to sing the harmony, but the Follies girls parts could even be simplified if you found the three part harmony impossible, or the chorus can assist from the wings. The men’s trio also requires good ears, and isn’t as easily simplified (see below)\n\nPolly\n\nPolly should be an excellent dancer and a very good singer. Good comic timing is necessary as well. I’m afraid I find Jodi Benson’s performance perplexingly mannered in the original cast, and I don’t recommend it as a model. Somebody with a good belt and ability to mix can have a lot of fun with it, and it can be a surprisingly moving role for such a silly show.\n\nBobby\n\nBobby is a high baritone or tenor who has a great deal of tapping and needs excellent comic timing. Bobby and Polly carry the show, and it’s a LONG night for both audience and the actor if they aren’t up to the task, or aren’t likeable.\n\nEverett\n\nEverett has only a tiny bit to sing, so you should cast an actor who reads older and can deliver his repeated nostalgic line amusingly\n\nIrene\n\nIrene is not a large role, but it is an important one, with a great song and some nice scene work. If you cast Irene well, there’s a lot of wonderful material in Act II. We had a very fine actor in this role, and the comic scenes were really strong.\n\nZangler\n\nIdeally your Zangler is a similar body and facial type to your Bobby, but that’s not strictly necessary, the pantomime and number in act 2 is just as funny if they’re slightly mis-matched. Zangler sings only one song.\n\nLank\n\nThe name Lank comes from the original Girl Crazy script, where he is also the antagonist. Lank is not a singing part, but should read a little menacing and have comic timing. Imagine if Judd from Oklahoma were something of a comedy role.\n\nPatricia\n\nA small comic part with manageable vocals, needs to pair well with Eugene\n\nEugene\n\nAgain, not a large part or a difficult sing, but a very nice comic role.\n\nCowboy Trio\n\nThe Trio numbers are delightful and somewhat hard to hear, harmonically. You should pick singers who can hear interior parts well; a college a cappella culture will furnish lots of options if you can get them to audition. Ideally one of them plays the guitar a little. It isn’t terribly hard. One of them might play the upright bass, although that can easily be mimed.\n\nMale Quartet\n\nIn the dramatis personae at the top of the show, this looks like it might be as involved as the trio, but in fact, this quartet sings and dances in Irene’s Naughty Baby, and only goes into 2 parts.\n\nFollies Girls\n\nYou need excellent dancers, primarily, but the core group does also have some tricky 3 part harmony, especially in Nice Work if You Can Get It.\n\nChorus\n\nThe chorus is like a Gilbert and Sullivan chorus, in the sense that the women are all one type (showgirls) and the men are all another (cowboys). Get some good dancers who can match pitch and all will be well.\n\nGeneral Notes: The notation of swing in this show is extremely inconsistent. But most of your pit players are going to go home and work through their books listening to cast recordings, which is honestly a much more efficient way of getting the nuances across than telling the players what is swung and what isn’t. I ran the cast recordings in my car for a few months ahead of the first rehearsal and got a good sense of what was meant where.\n\nGoing Through the Show Number by Number\n\nA. Overture\n\nThis Overture is terrific, particularly if you hired great players. I find these metronome markings unnecessarily fussy; for the first 98 measures, the pulse is between 122 and 138, and the shifts feel like L’istesso tempo.\n\nThere is an error in Trombone 1 in measure 10, those should be F and G, not Eb and F. Measure 15 should be marked 4/4, measure 19 back in Cut Time. I went back into a 4 pattern at 100-a, back into 2 at 115. Whenever that pattern at 115 happens, you are in an accelerando that leads you into the 4 of Stairway to Paradise.\n\nNo. B Incidental: Before Opening\n\nI will confess to being bewildered by the inclusion of this optional number, (letter?) since it’s the top of the show and there’s no need to change a set.\n\nNo. 1 Opening: K-ra-zy For You\n\nThe title song of the show is rather a trifle, and it’s so short it barely feels like a complete song. It comes from 1929’s Treasure Girl, where it had a verse almost as long as the song itself, and a second chorus with a different lyric.\n\nIn the Bobby/Tess/Zangler scene that happens between measures 22 and 55, if you’ve timed it right, there’s a little lull right before measure 56, and the sudden 4 bars of forte sits right there. See if you can get that to line up with the actors as they rehearse. The safety repeat from 72 to 87 is unlikely to be used. Explain to the band how to jump to 88 for the vocal.\n\nIf the choreographer is hewing close to the original choreography, the shave-and-a-haircut rhythm in the tap is what will lead you back into 119, and you’ll time the button for the ‘bits’ of ‘two bits’.\n\nThe scene change at the end of the number is one of the only scene changes in the show that is almost certain to fill the change. More on that to follow.\n\nNo. 2 I Can’t be Bothered Now\n\nThe first substantial number in the show comes from A Damsel in Distress, where it was originally sung (and tapped) by Fred Astaire. It was also the first big number in My One and Only. To me the song’s short phrases seem tailor made to Astaire’s voice, which was never great at long vocal lines. In the film, Astaire taps through traffic, ending the song by jumping onto a passing bus.\n\nPerhaps in an homage to that original usage, Crazy for You includes a car onstage, from which the Follies Girls emerge. Getting that car built will either be the delight of your technical crew or the death of them, and perhaps both.\n\nConduct measures 64 and 65 as one big 3/2 bar.\n\nMeasures 78 through 87 are one of Dale S. Kugel’s unnecessarily elaborate keyboard figurations. In rehearsal, play the stems-up right hand figure and the bass, but leave out the arpeggiations in 79, 81, 83 and 85. The brass part in the right hand of 86 and the bass are far more important than the woodwind figure Kugel wants you to play.\n\nThere is an error in measures 92 and 95 in the Piano Conductor score. The third beat in each of those measures should be an F, not a G in the left hand.\n\n136 through 139 are really fun for the band, but they can get a little sluggish if you’re not careful. All the descending chromatics might drag, keep an ear out.\n\nNo. 2 continued Playoff: Bothered\n\nMy only complaint about this is that if you’re playing from the reduction, it seems like the same 2 measures 6 times, when in fact, it actually builds to the end. If you play the ink on the page, someone may ask you to cut something because it’s so boring. Tell them to wait until the sitz.\n\nScene Change: After Bothered\n\nThis is the first scene change that’s liable to be too long for the music. I feel as though measures 1-4 can really only be played 4 times through before it starts to feel like something is amiss. Measure 15/16 (which is one measure) is mis-notated, although it will make sense once you explain it to the band. Your rall. that began in measure 13 has slowed so much by measure 15, that 1 measure of the new 4/4 has the same beat duration as the old cut time. In other words, measure 15/16 should be in 4/4, and the rhythm and beat pattern should feel like measures 13-14 felt. This sets up measure 17 well. The tuba/piccolo duet in measures 17 and 18 is a hilarious detail, you’ll be delighted to have a tuba if you can get one.\n\nNo. 3 Bidin’ My Time\n\nThis is the first number in the show that’s from Girl Crazy. In Girl Crazy, this group is a quartet, not a trio, but it also reappears several times in the show. The harmony in this version is a little more elaborate, despite having fewer voices. It is very unlikely these days that your actors will be aware of this style of singing, but the model is the Sons of the Pioneers. The 1934 recording of their signature song “The Tumbling Tumbleweeds” is an ideal style example. Cole Porter’s song “Don’t Fence Me In” is another example of this genre, and was actually introduced by Roy Rodgers and the Sons of the Pioneers.\n\nThe high tenor part is on the top of the lower staff, the lowest part is on the bottom of the lower staff, and the lead melodic part is the middle part rangewise, notated on the top staff. If you have any experience with barbershop singing, you’ll recognize it immediately.\n\nPolly’s line, “Mail Call!” in measure 17 b should be timed if possible. That interlude is meant to feel a little long, but if Polly comes in too early or too late, the break feels interminable.\n\nNo. 3a Incidental: Bobby Staggers In\n\nAn easy enough cue. Try and line up Bobby’s fall with the musical cue if possible.\n\nNo. 4 Things are Looking Up\n\nA second number from A Damsel in Distress, also originally sung by Astaire. The number doesn’t get the up-tempo treatment in the film, and the music takes a back-seat to Astaire’s dancing with Joan Fontaine. Here, Ludwig sets up the joke of instantly falling in love, then uses the rest of the tune as a kind of scene change to get us into Lank’s saloon.\n\nThe third note of the piano arpeggio in the first measure should be an A, not a B flat. Get used to conducting that figure in three, you’ll do it a few times in the show.\n\nNo. 4a Incidental: After Things\n\nThe joke of this number is that after a long scene change with the same annoying honky tonk music, Lank tells them to shut the player piano off, and this scene change ends. You may discover rather late that your pianist has trouble playing the stride piano part at this speed, especially over and over again. It’s an extremely challenging piano part and likely a very long scene change. I think everyone might be happier if you pre-recorded it with a tack piano, maybe even slowly speeding it up to relieve the monotony. A joke is a joke, but this scene change really overstays its welcome and wears out the pianist. You could also improvise a B section, as our pianist Chris Burcheri did very effectively each night.\n\nNo. 5 Could You Use Me?\n\nThis is the second number that originated in Girl Crazy. Do yourself a favor and watch Mickey and Judy do it in the 1943 film. This version is much shorter; essentially the best lyrics of the batch, because it’s used as a kind of verse to Shall We Dance? Gershwin’s verses are always so musically interesting that this delightful number credibly serves as a verse in this case.\n\nThe string section at the top requires 6 violins and 2 cellos to do well. I rewrote it for 3 violins and one cello, bringing in the bass at points. If you are using the string synth book, you don’t have this problem, but you miss the delightful slide from measure 2 into 3.\n\nThe marimba part in measure 21 is wildly in the wrong key. It should be a minor 3rd lower, (in F) through the end of the number.\n\nNo. 5 cont. Shall we Dance?\n\nThis is the title song, and Crazy for You’s first selection from the 1937 film Shall We Dance?, in which Astaire dances with Ginger Rogers and 14 Ginger Rogers look alikes with Ginger Rogers masks. The sequence is quite astonishing!\n\nThis is the first really substantial dance break in the show, but it isn’t impossible. Measures 63 and 64 really should be marked in 4. Measures 65 through 69 are probably going to line up with some visual cues. I believe the F flats in the piano left hand in 66 and 68 are in error. The recordings have F natural, and it sounds more idiomatic that way.\n\nSomething to keep track of: The passage beginning in 113 happens almost verbatim in Nice Work if You Can Get It, but the dance moment is a little different. For our production, this first version of the passage was just a hair slower than the one in Act II.\n\nOne of the cast recordings cuts measures 150 and 151, and you may want to as well.\n\nMeasure 170 may wind up being quite slow, and that molto accel. in 174 is not observed in some prominent recordings and videos of this dance break. Your choreographer may want those to be in strict tempo, dropping into the Vivo quickly. The nice thing about that is that it may set up a very clear l’istesso tempo from 175 to 176, where the old quarter equals the new half note. There will likely be some visual cueing at the end of the number as well.\n\nNo. 5a Scene Change: Shall We Dance\n\nI don’t know whether this was Ken Ludwig’s idea or somebody else on the production, but using a music-box version of Shall We Dance to get us into the theater is a wonderful theatricla touch, setting up both the nostalgia of the place and the idea that Polly was raised in it. A celesta will get us back into the theater in Act II as well, but then it will be K-R-A-Z-Y for You that’s played. More on that later.\n\nNo. 6 Girls Enter Nevada [Bronco Busters]\n\nThis number is technically from Girl Crazy as well, but it’s been totally reorganized. The title lyric, “Bronco Busters” doesn’t even appear. (this lyric wouldn’t really function in this show). The section that remains is boilerplate girls chorus material. There’s no Cure Like Travel/Bon Voyage from Anything Goes is exactly the same sort of thing.\n\nAgain Crazy for You uses a trifling song from Girl Crazy to set up a classic, in this case Stairway to Paradise, which always accompanies Bobby as Zangler, and never uses the lyric. Stairway to Paradise is in a family of songs that are associated with the extravagant showgirl sections of large scale reviews like the Ziegfeld Follies. A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody is the most famous example, and Sondheim is pastiching this kind of song in Beautiful Girls from Follies.\n\nWhen Crazy for You opened, there was just enough cultural memory for a large portion of the audience to associate this kind of tune with lavish showbusiness, perfect to demonstrate Bobby’s newfound confidence in his disguise. But the lyric would actually get in the way of that association. Today most of the audience won’t make this connection, but the overwhelming panache of the orchestration, with its screaming high trumpet line and swagger may do the trick even without any living memory of Ziegfeld.\n\nYou may need to buy some scene change time here. You can repeat measures 5 and 6, and then 7 and 8, making your accelerando more gradual, and that ought to get you a little scene change time.\n\nConducting measure 43 in the new tempo of the upcoming 2/4 is really helpful. It does not appear on the cast recordings.\n\nThere is a lyric error on pages 71 and 72. The men should read “Out here where there’s no doubt that men are men”, not “They don’t care if they don’t go east again”. It appears the correct way on the cast recordings, and if you do it as written, the men seem to be saying that out East, men are men, which is surely the opposite of what they intend to say here.\n\nNo. 7 Someone To Watch Over Me\n\nThis song comes from 1927’s Oh, Kay. It was originally written as an uptempo, but it has come to be known as a ballad, and one of the best known Gershwin standards. (if you imagine it in your head as an uptempo, you can hear what might have been) This is a particularly fine arrangement, and if you follow the tempo instructions, you’ll find it’s quite flexible and expressive.\n\nIn the opening section, the guitar has rhythmic notation and chord symbols that match what you have in your score, but not ringing for the full length of the chord the way you might expect. It might be worth a clarifying conversation to arrive at exactly what you’d like.\n\nNo. 8 Incidental: Rehearsal- Slap That Bass\n\nIf your pianist really wants to learn the stride, by all means, go to town. But you could easily simplify the left hand to a single note on beats 1 and 3, and then the lower part of the chord on 2 and 4. Fill out the right hand with some notes from the chord within the melody octave and the number is much less scary.\n\nThis cue is played twice, keep an eye on that.\n\nNo. 9 Slap That Bass\n\nA second song from 1937’s Shall We Dance? The original filmed version is very sloppy at the outset, with very poorly mimed instruments, vocals out of tempo with the accompaniment, and a static staging that opens out into one of Astaire’s most impressive tap scenes. For some reason the visual is staged around a factory, with the giant factory mechanisms adding to the rhythm of the tune. Strohman’s take much more clearly grounds the song’s setup in the dance, especially as we see the ladies becoming basses that the men play.\n\nThis single chart is orchestrated by Broadway legend Sid Ramin, in his second to last Broadway assignment. See the video above for more details.\n\nBut a lot of the credit for the effectiveness of this number has to go to the beautiful working collaboration between Susan Stroman and dance arranger Peter Howard. There are a lot of places where the music has clearly been tailored to tie together threads from previous storytelling and move the narrative forward through dance. At measure 100, the boys chant the dance steps they fumbled in the previous scene, leading to a pantomime of Bobby/Zangler cutting lengths of rope, setting up the delightful visual of the follies girls becoming upright basses, which are then played by the boys in measure 148. At 202, the music shifts to Polly’s perspective, to her Someone to Watch over Me melody, the music tells us she’s falling in love with him. It’s a knock-out tap number the audience loves, but it’s all storytelling. Astaire’s versions of these tunes are tap extravaganzas, not storytelling moments.\n\nIf you’ve managed to find a cast member who plays, you can have them actually play this bass part live. If not, you’ll need to work out a way to line up the pit bass and the mimed stage bass in the scene before. I wound up cueing both players’ notes at the same time, but if your bass player can actually see the action on stage, you might cut out the middleman and have them watch each other. Miming the bass is really about selling the slap, but not actually making the sound; the pluck is an exaggerated right hand movement away from the bass, which will read as a pizz snap back to the fingerboard without actually making the sound.\n\nAt measure 94, I finally gave in and just conducted each of the notes for the orchestra, conducting the new tempo against the syncopated figure just wasn’t locking in.\n\nThere is an error in the vocal score in measure 242; the last 2 chords in the right hand need D sharps and F sharps; this is a B7 chord.\n\nNo. 10 Embraceable You\n\nThis is the fourth number from Girl Crazy that made it into Crazy for You, and the first one that’s a genuine classic, appearing basically in its original form, changing only the ‘Papa’s that read as creepy today.\n\nThis is another spot where the guitar book has open changes which may be slightly different from what you’ve come to expect in the piano vocal. In measure 5, have the player mark D6/F# on beat 1, and in measure 11, change the D6 to a Bm1. Add an A pedal in measure 12 and 13.\n\nConduct the first section in 2 as written, then switch to 4 at 20, and back to 2 in measure 24. Go to 4 in measure 48, then back to 2 in 54. Go into 4 at 86, and stay in 4 to the end.\n\nThe violin obligato is cued in Reed 1, but it’s obviously much more idiomatic to the violin.\n\nThere is a clef error in the cello in the last 2 measures. Compare the vocal score and you’ll see the issue.\n\nNo. 11 Tonight’s the Night\n\nTonight’s the Night was cut from 1929’s Show Girl; it’s another throwaway number, used as vaudeville style underscore for scenes that advance the storytelling. The piano score was found in the Warner Brothers music warehouse in Secaucus, New Jersey in 1982, otherwise it would have been lost to the sands of time. The top of the number covers a scene change. It’s basically designed to function as an ‘in 1’, in front of the main curtain, but your production’s choices may necessitate a repeat somewhere.\n\nThese sorts of scenelets should bounce back and forth and time out very similarly every time. Unfortunately, the vamp from 55 to 86 is really long, and jumping to 87 is not all that easy. I suggest you make a decision to do that whole section a fixed number of times (2-3 most likely) and then live in the vamp at 87-90 until the next section comes due. It’s safer, and repetition of the old school 87-90 vamp is actually pretty funny under the Lank-Irene scene. 102 is tricky to get out of, because it’s so short and there’s a crowd reaction that has to land before you go on. You don’t have time for a ‘last time’ signal. Just indicate that you’ll be cuing a really strong ‘out’ to get out of the vamp.\n\nWhat your production SHOULD have done is set up the next scene behind the curtain while Tonight’s the night is running. If they did, this works perfectly. If they didn’t do that, and they’re setting up the next scene on stage, measures 119 and 120 are going to get real old real fast. In that case, bounce back to measure 55 and scene change from there.\n\nNo. 12 I Got Rhythm\n\nThis is the fifth number from Girl Crazy to appear in Crazy for You, and one of Gershwin’s most important contributions to American popular music. There is some controversy about whether the tune is original to Gershwin, or whether he heard it played, perhaps by William Grant Still, one of the great Black musicians and composers of that era. Questions about the genesis of quite a lot of Gershwin’s music have been put forward, and certainly his work relies very heavily on ideas originated in the Black community. Gershwin made no secret of his enthusiasm for Black music and his debt to the people that originated it. The fact that Gershwin’s music capitalized on those ideas and found popularity and monetary success among the larger White audience while Black composers found less success causes many modern audiences understandable discomfort, and I’m not going to argue with them. I offer my own opinion here, which you can take or leave. The history of race and commerce in America has many competing and sometimes upsetting narratives I can’t hope to untangle within the confines of a single blog post, even if I felt competent to do so.\n\nThe melody of I Got Rhythm is built mostly on a simple pentatonic scale, which is the basis of a great deal of Black music in America, as well as folk music from all over the world. The song is syncopated in a way that’s common to post-ragtime composers both Black and White. The extension of Ragtime’s 123 123 12 rhythmic pattern to a 123 123 123 123 12 12 pattern is one of the stylistic hallmarks of the late 20s and early 30s. It seems to me that the rhythmic activation of a simple up-and-down pentatonic pattern of the A section of the tune is in a way so basic to the building blocks of this era of music that it would be hard to establish a distinctive authorship for Gershwin or anybody else.\n\nWhat makes I Got Rhythm unique is its harmonic structure, also straightforward and simple, but so elegantly organized that it operates as a little machine. The B section, a chain of Dominant chords that sequence back to the tonic feels inevitable, and yet is interesting enough to be able to support what seems like an infinite number of variations.\n\nGershwin himself discovered this quickly. He went on stage with the Girl Crazy cast every so often to add some piano flourishes, and 3 years after the song was introduced, Gershwin wrote a set of variations for piano and orchestra. It must have been something like this on stage, since this film was made just 2 months after the show closed:\n\nOther musicians also began to cover the song almost immediately. There were at least 6 recordings in 1930 alone. In the Bebop era, jazz musicians began to write new melodies over existing chord changes. This practice served multiple functions. Writing a new tune ensured players wouldn’t need to pay copyright royalties to the publisher. It allowed players to call a tune in a combo setting that other players would already know how to solo over. It provided players a framework that would bring order to a consciously angular and counterintuitive musical style, elevating the tune itself to the level of melodic complexity once reserved for the solos, and raising the bar for the solos that followed. We call these new tunes Contrafacts. By 1950 there were more than 75 recorded bebop tunes that used the chord changes to I Got Rhythm as their foundation. I Got Rhythm has become such an important part of the framework of modern Jazz that the chord changes are known as “Rhythm Changes”. The Rhythm Changes sit alongside the 12 bar blues and the Coltrane Changes as foundational texts for Jazz improvisation. If Gershwin had never written another song popular with the Jazz community, this one tune would have placed him in the level of the most influential musicians in the history of Jazz, even though he was technically not a Jazz musician.\n\nGershwin’s Jewishness put him in a marginalized societal position that must always be remembered in any discussion of his work, and his lack of pedigreed classical training denied him the respect given to a composer of traditional symphonic music. His positioning in his world as an outsider made his cultural importance possible, because whatever he did had to be done from the periphery. This peripheral perspective gave him the artistic license he used to borrow liberally from cultural sources and mix them in an unorthodox way.\n\nWere Gershwin a Black musician, his road would have been much more difficult. It would be inaccurate and disrespectful to say that Gershwin invented this kind of music or that all his ideas were without precedent. But it’s also important to give him credit for creating this particular iteration of the cultural idea. Along with Rhapsody in Blue, An American in Paris, and Porgy and Bess, I Got Rhythm stands as one of the most culturally significant landmarks of musical modernism, largely because of the clarity and utility of Gershwin’s execution.\n\nYou can hear the development of the possibilities of this tune and the expanding rhetorical devices of Jazz instrumentation and big band vocabulary by simply comparing the original 1930 orchestration in Merman’s 1937 broadcast and the Judy Garland version in the 1943 Film (see my first video above) The original version almost doesn’t know what it has, it doesn’t explore the full potential of the tune, and Merman’s famous held C seems very tame by today’s standards.\n\nGarland’s band accompaniment, led by Tommy Dorsey, is a riot of instruments playing as families with very sophisticated harmony. In the intervening years between these arrangements, there’s been a kind of arms race for beauty, creativity and virtuosity between Ellington, Basie, Goodman, and others.\n\nCrazy for You’s orchestration adds to that felicity the further vocabulary of decades of Broadway reimaginings of that sonic world. There are woodwind doublings, onstage percussive sounds, novelty passages of ragtime, and imitation of dance moves in the orchestra that wring endless possibilities out of the small ensemble. This orchestration supports the choreography in a way you are not likely to find even in many a Hollywood film, and released from the high-art aspirations of contemporary jazz arrangement, these orchestrations are also free to be silly or whimsical, or to drop out entirely as the story demands. Yes, the audience loves a tap-dance extravaganza, but they really love it because of how strongly it tells the story; these people have fallen in love with the theatre even if the audience doesn’t come. I might even go so far as to say that this number is the best narrative use of tap in musical theatre history.\n\nThere’s a chapter in Broadway Stories: A Backstage Journey Through Musical Theatre by Marty Bell that provides a fly-on-the-wall look at the creation of this number, and it’s a must read if you can get your hands on it.\n\nNo. 12-I Dance- Part One: I Got Rhythm\n\nThe top of this mammoth dance break is a stage percussion part. It’s true that the onstage percussion parts are cues in the orchestra, but they don’t really layer. So when Perc 2 does the saw part at 5, they stop doing the hammers, and when the sandpaper part comes in in Perc 1, it stops playing the shovel part. You can correct this in the parts or even re-assign the parts to other pit players, but ideally the stage parts actually provide the sounds. Since these are props questions, you might insert yourself into the discussion of the things that make those sounds.\n\nGive the hammer and shovel parts to musicians if possible, they ground the whole thing, and if they speed up or slow down, you’re cooked.\n\nThe piano part at 29 can be simplified a little if necessary. The important thing is that it keep the tempo up!\n\nMeasure 59 is not really a grand pause.\n\nThe passage at 119 is from a Gershwin solo piano arrangement from 1932 (see video above)\n\nReading measure 127 it seems like the Eight notes should be pretty important, but in performance that line is not really audible, and the melody is what really counts.\n\nThe trad jazz passage at 167 is really fun, and if your players know how, they can decorate it a bit!\n\nThe tire pump/musical saw section is tricky to pull off. You will have a tough time getting that onstage musical saw to really work. You can cut from 207 to 226 if you don’t want the hassle.\n\nThe Csardas passage at 238 is the only real musical reference to the Zangler character being European at all. It’s one of Peter Howard’s many delightful touches.\n\nNo. 12-II Dance- Part Two: I Got Rhythm\n\nThe tappers establish the tempo here, and they’re liable to get excited. You need to correct wherever they land when the band comes back in.\n\nMeasure 89 is a delightful musicalization of a fantastically whimsical choreography idea, and one of the silliest piano reductions I’ve ever seen. See my tiktok about it.\n\nAt the very end of the number, you can carefully assign notes in the chord or you can let everyone sing whatever note in the chord they like, making sure only 1 or 2 high voices sing the high B flat.\n\nEntr’acte: The Real American Folk Song\n\nAct 2 opens with the first Gershwin song to appear on Broadway, in 1918’s Ladies First. But first we have a number of passages from previous dance breaks. The transition from the Entr’acte proper to the number is another Gershwin first, Rialto Ripples, from 1917, his first published piece. It’s a lovely touch, and I think a favorite of Peter Howard; you can hear him play it in his cabaret act on his CD.\n\nYou want to start Rialto Ripples in the same tempo as Real American Folk Song, which is tricky to think when you’re coming out of the previous tempo. I had a really wonderful pit pianist, and I just told him to think that tempo and lock it in.\n\nFor some reason the parts and the cast recordings don’t agree with the piano lick in the Piano Vocal score at 74a and 75a. But it’s easy enough to fix.\n\nVocal parts in the trio are again in the barbershop layout, with the melody stems pointing down. If they can possibly do it up the octave at 93a, they should. The audience loves it.\n\nNo. 13 continued Incidental: American Rag\n\nThis is way to virtuosic a piano part to be an underscore. Either simplify it or track it and have sound play the recording.\n\nNo. 14 What Causes That?\n\nThe second song from 1928’s Treasure Girl to make it into the show (the other being the title song) Michael Feinstein suggested the song to Ken Ludwig, having recorded it on his Pure Gershwin album in 1987. Early in previews, it was in late in Act I, but it works very well where it is here, coming on the heels of a scene imitating an iconic Marx Brothers mirror routine.\n\nSome folks are sensitive to jokes about suicide; you might bring that up on the front end to gauge if this is going to be an issue in your production. I don’t have a solution, but I believe in raising potential snags early.\n\nBe in 2, not 4.\n\n117 is probably NOT a grand pause as indicated in the score.\n\nNo. 14a Scene Change: Bobby Wakes Up\n\nCute little Grieg joke. Wonder who came up with it!\n\nNo. 15 Naughty Baby\n\nThis number is from 1924’s Primrose. A concert reconstruction of Primrose conducted by John McGlinn in 1987 at the Library of Congress drew public attention to this song. In his review for the New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote:\n\nThe plot of ”Primrose,” which involves three pairs of lovers, is romantic fluff in the post-Gilbert-and-Sullivan mode. Its performance on Friday, however, yielded the evening’s single most exciting discovery in ”Naughty Baby.” an obscure Gershwin tune that has the earmarks of an overlooked masterpiece. ”Naughty Baby” finds Gershwin at his most insouciantly jazzy and boasts a lilting, sharply syncopated melody that strongly echoes ”Somebody Loves Me” (also written in 1924). On the basis of one vocal and two instrumental reprises, one is tempted to rank it on a par with ” ‘S Wonderful.”\n\nMaureen McGovern subsequently titled an album after it 2 years later, and that’s where Ludwig first heard it. The inclusion of the song here places it firmly in the Gershwin catalog. The title is also a phrase in Embraceable You, which makes it a natural fit for this score.\n\nSomeone ought to use the first 6 measures to demonstrate how impractical correct spelling can be. The E double flat chords should be D chords, the F flat chords should be Es\n\nIn measure 3, trumpet 1 has a misprint, it should be a concert G#, not a concert G.\n\nMeasure 5 should be in 4, not in 2.\n\nIf you need a scene change, (and I think you probably will) go back to measure 52.\n\nNo. 15a Incidental: Crazy For You\n\nThis is the second celesta scene change, but this time it connects back to Bobby, who now has experience and memories in this theatre too.\n\nNo. 17 Stiff Upper Lip\n\nThis is the third song from A Damsel in Distress, and the only one not sung originally by Fred Astaire. It was sung by the inimitable Gracie Allen and followed by a funhouse sequence that doesn’t advance any story, but is nevertheless extremely impressive.\n\nThe temple block part at 145 can throw things a little off kilter. You might put something else on the first beat of the measure, like a light kick or a rimshot to see if that helps. Otherwise it can feel a little like the player is just behind the beat.\n\nThis number isn’t as kaleidoscopic as the other dance numbers in the show; you sort of have to establish a brisk tempo and drive it all the way to the end. The audience will thank you.\n\nNo. 18 They Can’t Take That Away From Me\n\nThis is the third and final selection from Shall We Dance, yet another Astaire classic. He sings it to Ginger Rogers on the deck of a boat. We don’t think of Astaire as a singer really, but the song plays to his strength, and for once the lyric seems to be doing real dramatic work. In 1949’s The Barkleys of Broadway they would do a beautiful dance routine to it.\n\nThis is one of the places where an underpowered string section will feel inadequate. The divisi in the first 3 measures can be re-organized, but it’s a little tricky. The bass voice is wrong in measure 3 in the piano vocal, the last chord should have a d under that 4th. It’s also an exceedingly unusual chord to drop you off, your Bobby may have trouble hearing the E flat that starts us off.\n\nThe arrangement is in many respects like an old Nelson Riddle Sinatra arrangement, with laid-back winds over a placid rhythm section. Particularly in the piano offbeats in 39 and 41, we feel the ring-a-ding sound. Don’t play the left hand figure in 33 and 34 when you’re accompanying in rehearsal; it conveys an impression the actual band parts don’t.\n\nNo. 19 But Not For Me\n\nThis is the sixth and final number from Girl Crazy to make it into the show, and the only one from Act II. The verse and the second chorus are not used.\n\nIt also has the feeling of a classic Nelson Riddle arrangement.\n\nMeasure 33 should really switch to a slow 2. Back into 4 in measure 59.\n\nNo. 19 cont. Reprise: But Not For Me\n\nThe piano vocal is in a really unfortunate key, but the band parts are not. I joked about the piece being in C flat major for a week to the confused looks of the band before I found out that they were mostly in B major. I found this a surprisingly affecting reprise, and I think it’s because of how beautifully it’s orchestrated.\n\nNo. 19a Scene Change: New Promenade\n\nThe Concerto in F is a lovely touch, and my horn players had a lot of fun making the old car-horn sounds. One of my players pulled the tuning slide and put a solo cup over the end to create a great Model T sound.\n\nThere is an error in the Bari Sax in measure 28. The third beat should be a D, not an E\n\nNo. 20 Nice Work if You Can Get It\n\nThis is the fourth song from A Damsel in Distress, another Astaire signature piece. When the song is sung in that film, it has a very similar tight harmony part for the women that appears in Crazy for You, and it’s also an example of the descending chromatic harmony under a singable tune that I reference in the 2nd video above.\n\nWhen Astaire dances the routine in the film, it’s yet another example of his consummate artistry. That routine is built around Astaire drumming and playing the drums mostly with his feet while dancing. It’s almost as audacious as his roller-skating routine to Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off in Shall We Dance. It’s remarkable that these musical numbers built around very specific dancing stunts manage to also become classic song standards we love well outside their original contexts.\n\nTo practical matters: I think 140 to the quarter is way too fast. The Original Broadway tempo is 120, and we took it at 110.\n\nThe three part harmony in measure 20 is really quite tricky, particularly for the lowest part. This may be a situation for some folks to sing offstage.\n\nThe passage at 204 is almost verbatim the same as a break in Shall We Dance, but this one may be a little quicker. The passage at 91 was difficult for us to coordinate. The quarter stays the same, you should run it a few times under tempo clapping the quarter. If your drummer knows what’s up you should be in good shape.\n\nNo. 21 French Reprise: Bidin’ My Time\n\nThere isn’t much time to change the set here; I wound up writing a little connecting section. I made a TikTok about it. Sorry, I won’t send you my arrangement.\n\nMeasure 39 is quite odd. The vocal parts make sense, but the C natural contradicts the A major tonality.\n\nNo. 22 Reprise: Things Are Looking Up\n\nI took this in 2, going into 4 at measure 9 to facilitate a little ritardando.\n\nNo. 23 Finale\n\nThis whole number should move at a pretty fast clip for the most part, with the obvious exception of 22-29.\n\nMeasures 26 through 29 are an allusion to Tschaikovsky’s Romeo and Juliet, and they’re not easy for your first violin soloist. Consider budgeting some time in rehearsal for that; it’s quite high, very exposed, and easy to play out of tune.\n\nMeasure 29-A is a puzzlement; a single bar in a new meter and tempo that immediately changes. I recommend you think of the measure as downbeat-upbeat, each beat functioning as a bar of the new tempo at measure 30 in one. It will take a little getting used to, but the winds need the downbeat to line up their chromatic scale, and the two beats help get the new tempo in time.\n\nThat page could very well give you some grief, but likely not as much as the choral parts beginning in measure 74. The top voices begin in a tritone against each other, which they continue for 12 bars, moving up a half step every so often. 86-101 are not terribly difficult, but 101A-101X are not easy to hear, particularly measures 101 W and 101 X, where every note is both a tritone and a second from everyone else. Definitely learn this an octave down, the hearing of it is a different matter than the singing of it up that high. You may find you need to simplify this passage.\n\nCut a half note out of 101 so your players can catch a breath.\n\nNo. 24 Curtain Calls\n\nThere isn’t much here that you haven’t already done. Measure 160 should have an E natural in the vocal, not an E flat.\n\nNo. 25 Exit Music\n\nThis is also music we have played before, and you can skip this at the sitzprobe.\n\nThe Orchestra\n\nThis is as good a place as any to point out that one of the reed books that will arrive in the mail has the incorrect show listed on the cover. I think it’s Sweet Charity. Don’t panic. It’s all the correct music.\n\nEven though the piano book is quite difficult at times, this is not a piano-bass-drumset kind of show. This is a big band show, and the piano acts as a rhythm instrument with occasional prominent obligato. As much of the band as you can get, you should. I was able to hire 20 players, the largest ensemble I’ve ever had at this venue. When the overture began, audience members were overwhelmed by the richness of the sound. It’s an extremely well put together show, and if you hire the right players, it feels like the very best of Broadway. I was lucky, though. Most people don’t have that luxury.\n\nDon’t do the show unless you can afford these 8 people:\n\nPiano (and hire a really good one)\n\nBass (you can’t do slap that bass without a bass)\n\nPercussion 1 (you can’t do a tap show without a drummer)\n\nReeds 1-3 (the important violin 1 parts are cued into these books)\n\nTrumpet 1 (the trumpet book has both 1 and 2 in it. Your player will toggle)\n\nTrombone 1 (there are some important lyric parts in here)\n\nIf you do this, you’ll need to work hard to replace everyone you didn’t hire, and all your players will be busy the whole show. It will be exhausting. I know because I music directed this years ago with that smaller size pit. Without all the brass parts, tell Trumpet 1 to use their discretion as far as the upper octave goes. The screaming high brass will sound dreadful if there isn’t any support underneath it.\n\nIf you can afford 9 players, add Horn 1\n\nIf you can afford 10 players, add Reed 4\n\nIf you can afford 11 players, add Trumpet 2\n\nIf you can afford 12 players, add Trombone 2 (the tuba part in this book is neat)\n\nIf you can afford 13 players, add Horn 2\n\nIf you can afford 14 players, add Violin 1\n\nIf you can afford 15 players, add Cello (there are some exquisite countermelodies here)\n\nIf you can afford 16 players, add the String reduction book\n\nIf you can afford 17 players, add Reed 5\n\nIf you can afford 18 players, add Guitar (doubling Banjo)\n\nIf you can afford 19 players, add Violins 2 and 3 and don’t hire the string reduction book\n\nIf you can afford 20 players, add Percussion 2\n\nIf you can afford 21-24 players, add Violins 4-6 and Cello 2\n\nThe string books work like this:\n\nThere are a couple of very prominent places where a string section is necessary. You will wish you had 6 violins and 2 cellos, and you will need to rewrite the parts if you don’t have the coverage. I’ve laid those places out above; these places are so few that they almost don’t justify the players. There are a handful of VERY important first violin lines that are cued in the other books, and some delightful cello parts that aren’t critical but are very useful to have.\n\nIf you hire one violinist and the keyboard string reduction, you get the best of both worlds at the cheapest cost.\n\nIf you hire the cellist and further violinists, you supplement the sound enormously, but you have to get to at least three violins before you can credibly remove the keyboard string reduction entirely. The places where the strings hold everything together can be moved into the keyboard 1 book, as I’ve indicated above. So if you have two or three violins, you can forego the string reduction player and let Keys 1 handle the most important spots.\n\nBe aware that the exposed guitar sections aren’t always written out with the voicings in the piano reduction.(see commentary above)\n\nThe percussion part is not strictly necessary, although when you add the xylophone to these tunes, it really enhances the period effect.\n\nAt some point, of course, it becomes a space issue. I think I was within a player or two of having my pit too cramped for comfort.\n\nI hope this exploration has been helpful to you as you prepare your production!\n\nI’ve decided to break up my exploration of this musical into two parts. This first part is a deep dive into Sondheim’s place in music history and this piece in Sondheim’s output. This first part will appeal perhaps to the folks who read my blog for big ideas I may have stumbled into. The second part will be devoted to more practical matters: the actual nuts and bolts of putting the show on.\n\nA personal story\n\nDuring the fall of 1992 I went on a 4 hour bus ride to the Curran Theatre in San Francisco with my High School choir to see Les Miz. (I feel confident that Robert Westenberg was playing Javert, but I can’t find any record of that online, so I may have hallucinated it) I was aware of Into the Woods at the time, and would play Rapunzel’s Prince the following Summer, but I was just beginning my exploration of Sondheim. Not far from the Curran Theatre at that time there was a little record store, and in that store I found the original Broadway cast recording of Sunday on CD. I grew up in Redding California, and there was a little music store in the mall where we lived, but they didn’t have a great selection of recordings outside the top 40, so I needed to take whatever opportunities I could to get my hands on new music. My friends were at the time very excited about Les Miz, but I didn’t share their enthusiasm, partly because I had recently gotten into opera, and Les Miz seemed by comparison weak sauce to me. The other reason was that I was a snob, and I didn’t want to enjoy anything that was popular. Sondheim was different, somehow; none of my friends were into his music or even knew who he was.\n\nI listened to the score in the bus on the way home on my portable CD player and was instantly very taken with it. It was like nothing I had ever heard before. I brought the CD to my french horn teacher, who was the conductor of the local community orchestra I played in. He was one of my lifelines to the world of high culture. I was curious to hear his thoughts. The next week when he returned it to me he said that he liked what Sondheim had done with minimalism; Minimalism was another thing I had never heard of.\n\nIn retrospect, the musical was both helpful and harmful to me as a young person. I loved high art, I loved the craft of music and musicals, and although I was a popular kid who led something of a charmed life, I didn’t have a lot of close friends, and none of my friends shared my obsessive enthusiasm for opera and musical theatre. I couldn’t readily access lyric theatre or even much classical music where I lived. Sunday in the Park was about someone with an obsession to create who, like me, was alienated from the people around him, and the musical urged him (and by extension me) to keep at it, to find something new. I recognized myself in George, and he made it okay for me to feel like an oddball. I felt in George a kindred spirit. The musical validated the identity I was staking out for myself.\n\nThe musical also did a great deal of damage, which I only came to realize later. George’s disregard for the feelings of the people who love him is posited as an unfortunate necessity for the creation of his art. Like a lot of people, I was particularly moved by George’s line:\n\n“And when the woman that you wanted goes\n\nYou can say to yourself, ‘Well, I give what I give’\n\nBut the woman who won’t wait for you knows\n\nThat however you live, there’s a part of you\n\nAlways standing by\n\nMapping out the sky\n\nFinishing the hat.”\n\nIt’s that “Well, I give what I give”, that’s the rub. Once you’ve decided that your pursuit of your art allows you to disregard other people, you’ve given yourself license to behave rather badly. Like most young people, I made some choices I sure wish I could go back and change, choices I justified by my sense of artistic alienation. So when I was finally able to music direct Sunday at Villanova this year, it was a bittersweet experience. Sondheim is always rewarding to work on, but my time working on Sunday was also a season when I needed to come to terms with the ways I had internalized a negative message. It was in many ways painful to face those truths about myself.\n\nAnd yet George’s story isn’t the only one to listen to. Others have taken courage from Dot’s story, particularly where she movingly says:\n\n“You could tell me not to go. Say it to me. Tell me not to go.”\n\nAnd then,\n\n“You are complete, George\n\nYou all your own\n\nWe do not belong together.\n\nNo one is you George, there we agree\n\nBut others will do, George.\n\nNo one is you, and no one can be,\n\nBut no one is me, George, no one is me.”\n\nThe magnetism of George’s artistic energy is thrilling and alluring, but you can’t build a lasting relationship with someone like that. Moreover, you can’t find the best version of yourself with a partner who doesn’t value you on your own terms for who you are as a complete self. Dot ultimately discovers her value as a person and follows that value across an ocean.\n\nOne of the great joys of working on a Sondheim musical is that there are many depths to plumb. The story is about complicated people, and there is more than one moral to discern. I discovered a different moral while working on the show. As much as George is working alone and alienating people around him, and as lonely as we find Act II George in pursuing his craft, the Georges don’t actually live in isolation. Success is found in connection with those living and dead. Our task as artists is to have the courage to push through to something new, hopefully without sacrificing those we love on the altars of our craft. Our task as people living around artists is to leave them room to create, and to respect ourselves enough to know when to find our own paths without them.\n\nGroundbreaking, and not to everyone’s taste\n\nSunday in the Park with George seems to catalyze people’s polarized opinions about Sondheim and his work. A number of my friends strongly dislike Sondheim, and Sunday seems to activate many of their most heated negative opinions of his work. Conversely, people who love Sondheim find Sunday the essence of everything they enjoy about him.\n\nThese strong reactions are to be expected for a figure like Sondheim because he broke from the strongly established musical and dramatic language the general public had come to enjoy, striking out in a new direction that had far fewer reference points for a general audience. Gluck, Beethoven, and Wagner elicited similarly strong positive and negative responses, because what they were doing seemed to many a rejection of the things they most valued. The subsection of the audience that disliked the new direction found the new ideas these writers presented pointless, boring, or perverse.\n\nMy friends who dislike Sondheim are not just bewildered by my enthusiasm, they seem angry at me about it. It reminds me of my experience as a child, when everyone was looking at Autostereogram or ‘Magic Eye’ pictures. They were marveling at the 3D images they were seeing. I couldn’t seem to make it work, and their excitement annoyed me. It seemed to me they must be making it all up. If you’re reading this, I suppose you are likely one of the folks who can see the ‘Magic Eye’ picture in Sunday, at least to some extent. If you can’t see it, nothing I say here is going to change your mind, and that’s really quite fine. Plenty of wonderful things bewilder me. I no longer need all my friends to agree with me about such matters.\n\nLapine’s recent book, some incredible podcasts, and even TikToks are beginning to peel the layers of this endlessly fascinating musical, so I don’t feel the need to say everything that might be said. I’ll limit my thoughts to four areas:\n\nSondheim’s relationship to the ‘Golden Age’ Musical, Serialism, and Minimalism\n\nThe way Sondheim trained his audience to understand his storytelling language\n\nHow that distinctive language has been diluted into a much less interesting lingua franca for contemporary musical theatre\n\nDoes Act II work?\n\nIn part II, as I’m discussing the many practical difficulties in the show, I’ll be discussing some brilliant and idiosyncratic aspects of Sondheim’s craft, so you’ll want to check that out even if you don’t have any intention of being the music director.\n\nIn this exploration, I hope to humanize Sondheim somewhat: to place him in his time, among us as fellow artists and as his audience. As long as he remains a god, we can’t see our own part in his story or his part in ours.\n\nBut He Combines All These Different Trends: Sondheim, the ‘Golden Age’ Musical, Serialism, and Minimalism\n\nFrom the outside, Sondheim appears to have emerged with a singular perspective alone in his generation. Trailblazers are like that. But the reality is of course far more complex, rooted in some heated cultural arguments from the mid 20th century, when Sondheim was formed as a writer. If we place Sondheim properly in that world, we can see that he is part of an interconnected web of ideas, not a lone wolf. This doesn’t diminish his achievement. We see the questions he was driven to ask, and we can ground his answers to those questions in the world of his contemporaries. George isn’t really alone, and neither is Stephen.\n\nSondheim had two mentors, Oscar Hammerstein II and Milton Babbitt. I have a feeling most folks know about Hammerstein, but Babbitt is much less well known to theatre people. It would be impossible to find two more disparate influences. They stand on opposite sides of a deep divide in 20th century culture.\n\nBabbitt was one of the most important composers and thinkers of the Serialist (twelve tone) school of composition. He is particularly famous for an article included in every anthology of 20th century music writing: Who Cares if You Listen? It would take much too long to really explore what this often cited and much misunderstood article was about in a page like this. But Babbitt became a very public example of a composer advocating for music the public was never intended to understand. If this sounds very like George’s ‘I do not paint for your approval’, you’re catching the drift.\n\nMy ethics as a professor compel me to add that Sondheim studied showtunes with Babbitt, not Schoenberg, that Babbitt loved musicals and was writing one when he and Sondheim worked together. Babbitt was not the pointy-headed, audience hating academic people have portrayed him to be. He did, however, represent the high-modernist aesthetic at its height. His was music of rigorous mathematical construction, explicitly rejecting the populism of the general public’s fickle tastes.\n\nHammerstein was Babbitt’s polar opposite. Hammerstein was doggedly interested in communication, and he was so good at it, he built an entertainment empire and inaugurated the so-called ‘golden age’ of Broadway. Hammerstein experimented and took risks. When the risks paid off, (Oklahoma, Carousel) he risked even more. When the risks failed (Allegro), he would turn back toward what he knew would connect with the audience. (South Pacific) Sondheim saw the failure of Allegro firsthand as a 17 year old gofer. It was a seminal experience in the development of his concept of what a writer does.\n\nMentored by these two giants, Sondheim fused their approaches in a kind of perfect Hegelian synthesis. Sondheim’s work as a composer is marked by motivic interrelationships and calculated development of small musical ideas. This is the Babbitt legacy. His work as a writer is about clarity and communication. This is Hammerstein’s legacy.\n\nTo reconcile the opposites, Sondheim needed to temper Babbitt’s purely musical logic. As an example: In the initial planning stages for Sunday, Sondheim was struck with the idea of the elegance of Seurat’s palette:\n\n“I thought: Isn’t this interesting that Seurat had, on his palette, eleven colors and white. And I thought, eleven and one make twelve. And how many notes are there in the scale? Twelve. And I thought, isn’t that interesting? So I thought I would utilize that in some way, shape, or form.”\n\nThere is a twelve tone row in Sunday, but it isn’t structurally important, because Sondheim decided the idea was unworkable.\n\nYou have to think like Babbitt to come up with that idea. And you have to think like Hammerstein to reject it.\n\nWhen we situate Sondheim’s output in the context of that mathematician/storyteller dichotomy, we can begin to understand him as someone very like other creators of his generation. His descriptions of himself begin to make more sense in this context as well. Without this context, it’s difficult to make sense of quotes like these:\n\n“In philosophy of art, generally, I’m a conservative. My beliefs are conservative, but my work is not.”\n\nWhy would Sondheim take such care to identify himself as a traditionalist? Can anyone hear Sunday in the Park as a conservative work? What might he mean when he distinguishes his beliefs from his work?\n\nThe key lies in the divide I’ve been describing. When Sondheim talks about being a conservative composer, he isn’t speaking with reference to other American musical theatre composers. He is positioning himself in the world of tonality as opposed to the school of serialism as classical composers do.\n\nIt’s important to keep that dynamic in mind when reading any of Sondheim’s remarks about Babbitt.\n\n“I haven’t studied atonal music. When I studied with Milton Babbitt I asked him if I could study atonality, and he said, ‘you haven’t exhausted tonal resources for yourself yet, so I’m not going to teach you atonal.’ And he was absolutely right; I’m still in tonal… Oh, I listen [to atonal music] but I’m not particularly fond of atonal music. I’m really very tonally oriented. I’m very old fashioned- I’m about 1890. I’m still early Ravel- that’s my idea of terrific. I know something about these things but I rarely use them.”\n\n-Sondheim interviewed by Mark Eden Horowitz\n\nIn an interview with Tim Paige, Sondheim claims no association with the sound of Babbitt:\n\n“I hear a little of Oscar [Hammerstein], not a lot, and I hear nothing of Milton.”\n\nDespite his careful efforts to distance himself from the work of his famously thorny teacher, Sondheim’s music reveals a composer more indebted to Babbitt’s approaches and methodologies than he is admitting. Sondheim’s innovations in Sunday are out of step with every other Broadway composer of his time, but are very much of a piece with the work of his generation of classical composers. Sondheim, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, La Monte Young, and Terry Riley were all born between 1930 and 1937. These composers began their musical training in the high modernist tradition, but they found themselves working just as Sondheim was to find intellectually stimulating methods that were nonetheless accessible to the general public.\n\nWhen my French Horn teacher returned my CD of Sunday all those years ago, he said, “I like what he’s done with minimalism.” That’s almost right. Sondheim wasn’t using the ideas of minimalism to depict pointillism. Sondheim is a minimalist composer, maybe the most successful one of them all.\n\nMinimalist composers still enjoyed the creative task of organizing pitches in mathematical ways. But they wanted the audience to be able to enjoy the game. The movement which would come to be known as Minimalism was not a total rejection of the values of serialism. This music is still carefully structured around processes. Composers didn’t simply write whatever struck their fancy. They treated collections of notes as artifacts to be manipulated, run against each other in interesting ways, repeating, expanding, phasing, contracting, modulating, altering and expanding groups of notes in ways that were interesting to think about and intellectually rigorous. What distinguished these young innovators and made this new music so exciting in the classical sphere was the fact that these composers re-embraced tonality. (which you might think of as being in a key) They further made sure the processes they were employing could be clearly heard, even without any prior explanation.\n\nIn 1968 Steve Reich wrote about what he found interesting in musical processes:\n\n“I am interested in perceptible processes. I want to be able to hear the process happening throughout the sounding music… In serial music, the series itself is seldom audible…What I’m interested in is a compositional process and a sounding music that are one and the same thing… The use of hidden structural devices in music never appealed to me. Even when the cards are on the table and everyone hears what is gradually happening in a musical process, there are still enough mysteries to satisfy all.”\n\nMinimalist composers made a point of exploring repetitive Southeast Asian and African musical practices. (When Steve Reich first met Sondheim, he expressed an admiration for Pacific Overtures) The Minimalists also drew inspiration from the repetition at the center of the popular music they were listening to. It was easy for naysayers to ridicule the ever repeating patterns of Philip Glass’s music, but minimalism’s intellectual underpinnings were broad based and anything but simplistic. The music had many points of reference that made it intelligible to an ever larger audience. Repetition was something a 20th century audience implicitly understood from decades of acclamation in popular music, and as Robert Fink has demonstrated in his wonderful book Repeating Ourselves: American Minimalism as Cultural Practice, the repetitions of Minimalism reflected the repeating patterns of 20th century life. We hear in this music the rhythm of the advertising industry and the repeating multiplicity of branding that so intrigued Warhol and the other pop artists who were working at the same time.\n\nTo an older generation of classical music enthusiasts, Minimalist music was mindless or worse, nihilist. Reich’s Four Organs famously drove a Boston audience to a fury of boos, which started when the audience began to realize the repetition would continue indefinitely.\n\nBut the minimalists had the last laugh.\n\nIn time the musical language of Minimalism made such a cultural impact that today film scores, advertisements, and popular music are suffused with minimalist gestures. The normalization of this musical language is one of the great success stories in Western Art music, and this popularity has obscured Minimalism’s experimental and process based roots. The shadow of Serialism looms large in the fractal patterns of Glass, Reich, and their many imitators. Without serialism’s insight that music could be organized in patterns and processes, the music would never have developed the way it did.\n\nLara E. Housez has a remarkable exploration of some of the ideas I’m talking about in the fascinating new book Sondheim in Our Time and His. Housez names both the serialist influence in Sunday and the minimalist techniques very well, but stops short of naming Sondheim a minimalist as I have here. You should read her chapter if you find this connection interesting.\n\nLike the other minimalists, Sondheim uses process transformation of melodic ideas as the basis of his later work. Influenced particularly by the music of Steve Reich, Sondheim developed his stylistic language to answer the Musical Theatre crisis of the late 1970s in a way that hadn’t yet occurred to anyone. The way he used repeating structures was driven by the drama, but some of his musical ideas are are very similar to common minimalist procedures.\n\nThe passage below comes from Gossip Sequence. The right hand is a pattern of 4, the left is a pattern of 3. The two parts phase against each other. You could think of this as a polyrhythm, but because the pattern sits in a single set of pitches, it sounds much more like Reich than Jazz.\n\nHere’s the beginning of a celebrated piece by Reich: Piano Phase\n\nTwo pianists play the same little pattern over and over. They slowly go out of phase with one another until the pattern is displaced by one pitch in one of the players. Then the process continues. Each re-alignment reveals a new combination of pitches in the pattern.\n\nSondheim uses this method throughout Sunday, but here specifically, the repeating and obnoxious needling performs a dramatic function; like the Pick-a-little-talk-a-little ladies if they were all singing different patterns that contradicted each other.\n\nThe chords that begin the musical are repeating with variations in a very minimalist gesture.\n\nCompare this newer masterpiece of minimalism, Promises by Floating Points and Pharaoh Sanders:\n\nIf you were to play the first page of Sunday repeatedly for 45 minutes, you’d have a credible minimalist concert work.\n\nI can anticipate enthusiasts of minimalism taking issue with my assertion that Sondheim is a full-fledged minimalist on various grounds. After all, repetition is not necessarily minimalist, and Sondheim doesn’t park for long on any idea. But Sondheim’s increasingly motivic melodic transformations in the vocal lines themselves are driven by the same musical imperatives as the minimalists and are even explicitly minimalist in their expression. (a little more on that in the next post) What distinguishes Sondheim from the other minimalists is that the totalizing commitment to the process is always sublimated in his work to the needs of the drama.\n\nAs it happens, other minimalists were writing operas. Glass’s seminal third opera Akhnaten is also from 1984. But because Minimalists are generally so invested in playing out the possibilities of musical ideas on musical terms, these operas tend to have large, static, pulsating sections of text setting, and they don’t move dynamically and fluidly with stories in real time. They feel like pageants, a series of thrilling tableaus, or like a baroque opera, impressive and inert. Even in a season as light as 1976-1977, it would have required someone of extraordinary vision to see Glass’s Einstein on the Beach in one of its two New York performances and predicted it as a way forward for the Broadway musical. Sondheim is too canny to publicly dismiss minimalist opera, but he did write in Look, I Made a Hat:\n\n“When I first heard that the libretto of Philip Glass’s 1979 opera Satyagraha was written in Sanskrit (by him and Constance de Jong) I giggled inwardly at what I deemed its pretentiousness, and delightedly reverting to my snotty adolescence, made many a witty remark at its expense. Then I saw it. Not only was I mesmerized for most of it, I was brought up short by the realization that Sanskrit was the best possible language for an opera libretto. It has the two necessary qualities: it utilizes predominantly open vowel sounds (listen to the title) and it doesn’t invite you to try to understand the language, which is something you automatically do at the opera if you know a smattering of German or Italian or French.”\n\nFor a lyricist of Sondheim’s caliber, complimenting a libretto for not inviting comprehension gives a sense of what an audience might value in minimalist opera: Spectacle, not narrative. This was not Sondheim’s way.\n\nSondheim occasionally joked about stealing ideas from Reich, as in 2012, in recorded remarks for an award ceremony honoring Reich:\n\n“Steve’s experiments with phase music and the musical use of spoken fragments have alone opened the ears of many younger composers as well as some elderly ones like myself. In fact, stealing ideas from him is one of the more satisfying pleasures that I’ve had. I only wish the opportunity arose more often, but, unfortunately, it’s not always appropriate.”\n\nBut it should also be noted that repeating and transforming patterns appear in Sondheim’s work as early as 1965’s Anyone Can Whistle, when Reich was just beginning his tape experiments in near anonymity, and that repeating patterns became the organizing principle of large sections of Company and Follies in 1970 and 1971. This is an important point to make, because Sondheim is not exactly copying the minimalist style, as some have described it. He arrived at similar ideas independently and in tandem, working out of the same cultural influences as the composers of art music. To understand him correctly, Sondheim needs to be seen as a minimalist composer himself, not a copycat who pulled minimalist ideas opportunistically into the world of Musical Theatre.\n\nIn an interview in 2015, Sondheim claims the first piece he heard of Steve Reich’s was 1979’s Eight Lines, and he “Immediately went to Jerry Robbins and said, ‘you gotta make a ballet out of this’, and he did.” The very minimalist score of Pacific Overtures predates this familiarity with Reich’s music by a full 3 years.\n\nIn a July 1985 WNYC interview, Sondheim says:\n\n“It’s not so much that minimalist music influenced me as [that] I got into it, I’ve been an admirer of Steve Reich in particular, and Glass over a period of years, and I found that I realized that as I was trying to musicalize I realized the kind of so-called pointillist painting application of many many tiny strokes of color was not unlike the application of tone clusters, that is to say he would pure tones of color next to each other in order to make another tone, and that’s often so to speak as a matter of fact”\n\nSunday is therefore both a continuation of Sondheim’s general development as a minimalist himself, and also a specifically Reichian musical language Sondheim sensed would be a good analog to the ideas of the work at hand.\n\nGathering Supporters and Adherents: The Way Sondheim Trained his Audience\n\nAnother drawback to thinking of the artist as an isolated hero is that it neglects the importance of the audience the artist is addressing. The traditional narrative of the trailblazing creator focuses naturally on the progression toward the work we have come to recognize as significant. We want to get a sense of how these breakthroughs came to be, and how the writer thought up their greatest ideas. We consequently lose the sense of the artist slowly bringing themselves and the audience along from work to work, acclimating the audience to the means of expression and setting the terms for what they might expect. A writer with a body of work is in a kind of negotiation with an audience. When a writer with a particularly long career writes a work that represents a new mastery or synthesis of ideas, that not only means that the author has had enough chances to write a piece that they have a deep well of technical skills. It also means that the audience has had enough experiences with the intervening steps toward the capstone work that they can process what the author was trying to say. Without many such points of intersection between the writer and the audience, this dynamic can’t take place.\n\nFor example:\n\nTo tell the full story of Show Boat is to acknowledge that the audience for the Princess Musicals had learned from Kern’s body of work how to hear the kind of musical storytelling he had in mind; to expect fewer musical trifles and more content, to expect the music to help tell the story.\n\nTo tell the full story of Oklahoma is to correctly place the audience’s understanding of what a musical might be in the story of its innovation and success. That audience had partially learned from Hammerstein himself how to hear what he was trying to do.\n\nIf Sondheim had written Forum and somehow figured out a way to write Into The Woods without writing, recording, and releasing any of the intermediate shows, the audience wouldn’t have understood the language of the musical enough to enjoy it as they did.\n\nIt was fortunate for Sondheim’s career trajectory that he had moderate successes and daring failures in almost equal measure from the beginning, and that all his shows (even the flops) were recorded and publicly released. In this sense Sondheim’s body of work is one of the first to benefit from the readily available distribution of recordings. A subsection of the audience was able to listen again and again to the scores and in doing so develop an understanding of his language.\n\nIn the 1780s and 1790s, Gottfried Van Swieten, an Austrian diplomat and imperial librarian, privately introduced Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven to the music of Bach and Handel. Each of these composers were deeply impacted by this music, known at that time only to a tiny group of connoisseurs.\n\nNot long thereafter, a Prussian Jewish woman and amateur musician named Sara Levy also collected this music and shared it with her friends. Her library would eventually make possible the Bach revival led most famously by her great nephew Felix Mendelssohn. Composers who were exposed to this music began incorporating more complicated polyphony and dramatic baroque gestures into their own compositions. Listeners in turn began to appreciate this density and excitement, and to be aware of the Baroque antecedents. This is a case of a very small but well placed audience slowly disseminating a complicated and partially forgotten musical language until eventually the circle of appreciation led to the middle class and the general public. The process took more than half a century.\n\nWide distribution and consumption of cast recordings accelerated a process like this tremendously. Now anyone with a turntable could memorize shows that didn’t run the length of a week, and one didn’t need to live in New York or afford tickets to be aware of the latest developments in the field.\n\nThe cast recording of Oklahoma! In 1943 was the first ‘Original Cast Recording’ and sold over a million copies. This proved the potential profitability of recording every Broadway show that had any public appeal. By 1960, the Original Cast Recording of Camelot was so successful as an album that it significantly boosted the fortunes of the troubled stage show it documented. By 1969, composers like Andrew Lloyd Webber realized that they could exploit that dynamic deliberately, writing the shows to work as albums first, then figuring out how to stage them after they were already popular. In less than 30 years, the tail of recording was wagging the dog of the production itself.\n\nThe economics of the theatre was still very challenging for a composer like Sondheim, who wasn’t courting a broad audience like Lloyd Webber. A new show still had to convince enough New Yorkers and tourists to buy tickets and pay off the investors. But that was becoming a separate issue from the development of one’s individual voice, which could be established and disseminated to people who never even attended any of the musicals. I grew up in rural Northern California. The first show I ever attended on Broadway was Sondheim’s Passion, in late 1994, but at 19, I had already purchased and memorized Sondheim’s entire recorded catalog.\n\nA number like Changing from Act I of Sunday is incomprehensible in the language of a ’50s musical. But if one has heard Too Many Mornings from Follies, Another Hundred People from Company, Every Day a Little Death, and Liaisons from Night Music, and Kiss Me from Sweeney Todd, one not only knows how to hear what the piece is about, one expects such a number from Sondheim.\n\nThis is also a major factor in the careers of Minimalist composers. Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and John Adams released their music on Nonesuch Records, a prestige label known for releasing beautiful recordings of exciting new work, stylishly packaged to look terrific on your coffee table. It wasn’t necessary to have one’s work programmed by a major orchestra to get musical innovations into the ears of the public. The minimalists built an audience that had to be reckoned with, irrespective of their popularity (or lack thereof) in traditional venues.\n\nThis relationship of composer to audience via the medium of recordings is self-selective, which is another of the reasons why Sondheim’s music speaks so well to some people and so little to others. Those in the know chose to be in the know and put in a great deal of time to learn the language.\n\nNow they’re just becoming more and more about less and less: Contemporary musical theatre and the dilution of Sondheim’s Language\n\nEven as early as the mid-1990s, Sondheim’s musical language was so well known among musical theatre fans that it was becoming a major part of the vocabulary of most young writers. In 1995, when the style had begun to permeate the new shows, Amanda McBroom wrote a song entitled ‘Everybody wants to be Sondheim’ Part of the lyric reads:\n\nListen as they hammer out one chord.\n\nListen ’til you’re ready for a lunatic ward.\n\nNo wonder Sweeney Todd went out of his gourd,\n\nAnd later:\n\nAnd yet the epidemic can’t be curbed.\n\nEven Stephen would be disturbed\n\nTo see what he has spawned universally.\n\n‘Cause everybody wants to be Sondheim.\n\nEverybody wants to finish the hat.\n\nEverybody wants to be Sondheim but…yours truly.\n\nEverybody wants to assault your ear.\n\nDon’t send in the clones – they’re already here.\n\nEverybody wants to be Sondheim,\n\nPrimed every time to rhyme internally,\n\nEveryone’s coming up Sondheim but me.\n\nToday composers use insistent chords in the right hand with jagged offbeats in the left hand; it is as ubiquitous as the Alberti bass in the 1780s. Slowly pulsating quarter notes like the closing number of each act of Sunday are the underscore of most musical theatre ballads. The style is fairly easy to combine with the repetitive accompaniments of pop ballads, (which are also the musical cousins and grandchildren of minimalism). The triumph of his musical language, now drastically simplified and stripped of its rigorous motivic construction, reduced to a set of clichés, has put him in an odd position. His musical style is now in many ways in the position the ‘Golden Age’ stood when Sondheim was first remaking his style.\n\nBy the 1970s, the musical language of Broadway had developed an insular vocabulary. It sounded like itself, and only rarely did a song escape a show to be covered by a popular artist. One immediately knew from the style of the writing and the kind of singing that one was listening to a showtune. The bracing rock language of Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar came as a welcome relief, even if at times the new sounds weren’t yet up to the task of telling the story. We feel that excitement in our day when a Hamilton or a Six offers us a glimpse of a stylistic diversity Broadway no longer has. Repurposing songs from outside theatre is not the answer to the artistic cul-de-sac either, as we’ve learned after decades of jukebox fare.\n\nThis is where we are now. In the diluted Sondheim language, sarcastic introspection and biolerplate piano accompaniment somehow lose their exploratory quality. It’s white noise, something to be pushed back against if we are to find a new way of making musical theatre, just as Sondheim himself did.\n\nI Hate These People: Does Act II work?\n\nIn Kyle Marshall’s excellent podcast, he has been asking guests this season if Act II of Sunday is necessary. Most of his guests are saying it is. But from the very beginning, many have said that Act II doesn’t work. I never felt that way, probably because the encouragement I got from the show is virtually all at the end of Act II. It remains my favorite part of the show.\n\nFrom moment to moment, number for number, it would be tough to top the second act. It’s Hot Up Here is utterly delightful. Putting it Together is a tour-de-force; one of the most difficult and impressive bravura numbers in Musical Theatre. After a brief scene, there is a slow number that I will admit is not a highlight of the show. But then Lesson #8, Move On, and a reprise of Sunday, three numbers that often bring audiences to tears. So what’s the problem?\n\nI identify a number of factors that make the act hit-or-miss for folks, and I believe all of them are simply unavoidable given the kind of piece Sondheim and Lapine were attempting to write.\n\nIt is a principle of musical theatre writing that in the first 15 minutes of the show, the writers tell the audience what they might expect, who to root for, and what’s the main point of the show. If you drastically change the tone or style of the show or introduce major characters past that first portion, the audience feels cheated somehow. At the top of Act II, we briefly see the characters we know, and then they go away, replaced by an entirely new group of people who are exhausting and present brand new problems. The mental energy it takes to process this shift makes some audience members lose patience with the piece. After all, the first act of Sunday requires a very active mind of the audience, especially if one is seeing the piece for the first time. The top of Act II is just a bridge too far for some viewers.\n\nIf your strongest connection with the piece is to Dot, not George, the second act is a real let-down. The empowerment Dot experiences at the end of Act I is reversed. Dot comes back to assure George that what he did was all for the best, as long as he made his art his own way.\n\nA third issue people identify is the Chromolume. The Chromolume isn’t meant to be particularly good work. Second act George is stalled out, and we need to see that. The tech for the first act of Sunday can be very complicated, leaving fewer time and resources to solve the chromolume’s technical issues. And these days the creative team also has to access ideas believable as artifacts from the 1980s. The audience has to make sense of this immediately upon meeting George in Act II. The scene where the machine breaks down is very funny, but it’s difficult to piece out how much of what is being portrayed is George’s stalled out art and how much is the decisions made by the production. To process all that while experiencing the show for the first time is a daunting task.\n\nEach of these issues stems from something intrinsic to the message of the show, and in fact, intrinsic to Sondheim’s understanding of himself in his world.\n\nThe parallel construction of the two acts (more on that in the next post) tells us over and over again that as much as the world seems different now, these people are locked into the same patterns and playing essentially the same roles as people have always played. Second act George is a different person, but is essentially the eternal George, to the point where first act George’s mother recognizes him as her son. (After initially ignoring her actual son in the first act) When Dot concludes the show, “they are your words, George”, she is asking George to claim his legacy as the ur-artist. The history George discovers at the end of the show is meant for him to participate in and embody, not to imitate. This is how Sondheim himself saw his world. His artistic legacy is wrapped up in his heroes and mentors, who represent an idea of the artist’s struggle and quest in which he is meant to participate. The past nurtures the present and the future.\n\nIncidentally, Sunday is an explicit change in that narrative, In Follies, A Little Night Music, The Frogs, Pacific Overtures, Sweeney Todd, and Merrily, the past in some sense reaches forward in time to condemn the present for losing its way. In Sunday and in Into The Woods, the past reaches into the future to extend grace. In Assassins, the past goes back to being malevolent. But in Sondheim’s work, the past is always an active participant in the present and the future.\n\nThere is no way to tell that story in this instance without a second set of characters in another time. The audience’s difficulties in processing the new characters are unavoidable.\n\nDot’s journey in Act I is refreshingly empowering, and we are sad to see that actress subsequently sitting in a wheelchair and an old-lady wig, draped in sweaters or blankets so that we can’t see that she’s still wearing a corset. She sings an intentionally meandering song and then re-emerges as Dot. Except this Dot has lost all the frustration and humor we loved and now exists as a kind of fantasy of maternal encouragement. (I have given here the unkindest possible reading)\n\nBut Sondheim is ultimately writing about George. He doesn’t truly know Dot’s world, and neither does Lapine. The core dramatic questions are artist questions, not relationship questions. In the first act, Dot’s pain is the price we see them both pay for the glory of George’s art. As much as we want to see more of first act Dot, her story has reached the only resolution that makes sense when she leaves him. For a satisfying conclusion to the story, the two must be reconciled, “We will always belong together”. But that reconciliation can’t happen with any honesty in their real relationship. It can only happen metaphorically.\n\nFinally, as Sondheim and Lapine are trying in Act II to draw explicit comparisons to the modern world of art, they have to show new George as a participant in the newest artistic exploration, he must have some success at it, or we don’t know whether he really should be doing this at all, and the work can’t be incredible, or he can’t have a crisis. They have to show this work that has potential, but isn’t all that good.\n\nThis is an example of a problem we encounter a lot in art about art. When a character is supposed to have written the perfect song, a composer has an impossible task. And when a character is supposed to have made bad art, it’s an almost equally difficult task for the creator of the fictitious art. Normally artistic presentation leaves it up to the audience to passively decide if something is good or bad. When the piece sets up the quality level of the work as very good or even slightly bad, it invites unwelcome metatheatrical questions. The work in Act I is a famous pointillist painting, so the decision about the quality of the work has already been made by others, and the audience doesn’t have to ask the question.\n\nAgain, the piece faces an intrinsic, almost insoluble problem.\n\nIt makes sense to me that people don’t enjoy the end of Sunday. But I think what we have is the best possible completion given the placement of the writers in their world. To complete it differently would have required other writers with other stories to tell.\n\nWhat the Eye Arranges is What is Beautiful\n\nSondheim usually brushed off questions about whether he was writing about himself:\n\n“A lot of people think that a lot of the songs I write are autobiographical. And they think that the characters I write about are me. They think I’m George in Sunday in the Park with George, or I’m Bobby in Company. But in fact, there’s only been one autobiographical song I’ve ever written, and that was “Opening Doors” in Merrily We Roll Along”\n\nIn truth, though, all writers write about themselves. The things that are worth saying grow out of experiences, and you can only ha"
