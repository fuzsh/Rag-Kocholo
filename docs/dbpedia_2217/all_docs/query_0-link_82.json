Many of Sir Victor Uwaifo songs become very popular and trendy online with a great number of streaming and downloads on Boomplay. He was the winner of the first gold disc in Africa (Joromi) released in 1965 and seven other gold discs in Guitar boy, Arabade, Ekassa series and Akwete music. He recorded under the name \"Victor Uwaifo and His Titibitis\".He died on 28 August 2021 at the age of 80\n\nCareer\n\nAfter leaving Benin, Uwaifo continued playing music at St Gregory's College, Lagos. He was a contemporary of Segun Bucknor, and they were both among the leading Lagos high school bandleaders at the time. During school holidays and weekends, he jammed with Olaiya's All Stars band. After completing secondary school studies, he played with E.C. Arinze's highlife during late hours. Uwaifo also briefly worked with Stephen Osadebe and Fred Coker before he formed Melody Maestros in 1965. The band released \"Joromi\" which became a hit in Nigeria and other parts of West Africa. Uwaifo made history in Nigeria when he won the first golden record in Nigeria, West Africa and Africa (presented by Philips, West Africa) for his song \"Joromi\" in 1996.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1968, he developed the Akwete rhythm sound. In 1969, he launched a new beat called Shadow accompanied by a new dance also called shadow, a mixture of Akwete and twist. The sound was released when soul music was popular in Lagos and lasted a few years. After the launch of Shadow, the Melody Maestros went on tour of various Nigerian cities. Uwaifo later experimented with a new rhythm that was similar to soul but soon left it for Ekassa, an interpretation of a traditional Benin sound. In 1971, Uwaifo opened the Joromi Hotel in Benin City, and within ten years established his own television studio. From there, he produced a national weekly music and culture programme.\n\nUwaifo, who had a total of 12 golden records to date, travelled to many countries including the United States, Russia, Japan, United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Romania, Germany, France, Hungary, Rome, Ghana, Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire), Togo, Benin Republic, Spain, and Canada.\n\nFollow Boomplay and keep up to date with the latest Sir Victor Uwaifo songs and information.\n\nSir Victor Uwaifo Discography\n\n• Sir Victor Uwaifo Guitar Boy Superstar\n\n• The Rough Guide to Highlife\n\n• The Rough Guide To Psychedelic Africa\n\n• The Rough Guide to African Disco\n\nSir Victor Uwaifo songs are included in Boomplay music playlists.
