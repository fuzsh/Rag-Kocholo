        "text": "Woodstock '94 is no middle child music festival. While not as groundbreaking as Woodstock '69 or as infamous as Woodstock '99, Woodstock '94 boasts a unique legacy that deserves recognition.\n\nHeld Aug. 12-14 in the Hudson Valley town of Saugerties, New York, Woodstock '94 was set to commemorate the silver anniversary of the original Woodstock festival in 1969. Nodding to its origins in '69, Woodstock '94 was billed as \"2 More Days of Peace and Music\" (a third day of the festival was eventually added).\n\nWoodstock '94 featured a wide range of acts that both reflected the nostalgia of Woodstock '69 and highlighted a myriad of new groups. Original Woodstock performers such as Crosby, Stills & Nash (minus Neil Young) and Santana topped the bill, and now-household names including Green Day and Red Hot Chili Peppers performed some of their earliest festival sets.\n\nEven Bob Dylan, who initially declined an appearance at Woodstock '69 despite living near the festival at the time, had a change of heart and agreed to play at Woodstock '94.\n\nIt seemed that everyone wanted to capture a sliver of the magic from the original Woodstock. Although roughly 164,000 tickets were sold, the actual number of attendees exceeded 350,000 (surpassing even Coachella 2024's attendance rates).\n\nSpirits were high as the festival opened on Friday with dry, sunny skies highlighting performances from Sheryl Crow, Collective Soul, and others. By the weekend, the weather took a turn and transformed the festival grounds at Winston Farm in Saugerties into a giant muddy puddle. Although Woodstock '69 was also rainy and mud-filled, the madness that ensued at Woodstock '94 led it to be dubbed \"Mudstock.\"\n\nAs Primus performed \"My Name Is Mud\" on Saturday, festival-goers seized the opportunity to fling the wet dirt at the band on stage.\n\n\"Once I started singing the words to \"My Name Is Mud,\" all of a sudden huge chunks of sod started flying my way and it was pretty frightening,\" Primus' lead singer told Billboard 20 years later. \"I still have those [speaker] cabinets to this day, and those cabinets still have mud in them.\"\n\nWith high energy from Friday's acts and some mud-induced chaos, attendees were buzzing with anticipation and excitement for the rest of the weekend. The party atmosphere continued throughout day two — and not solely because Blind Melon lead vocalist Shannon Hoon strolled on stage tripping on acid, wearing his girlfriend's dress.\n\nAerosmith may have been day two headliners, but Nine Inch Nails' 15-song set remains a highlight of Woodstock '94. The band drew the biggest crowd of the festival, and were catapulted into wider mainstream visibility. Taking advantage of the unpredictable weather, then-bassist Danny Lohner pushed lead vocalist Trent Reznor into the mud, prompting Reznor to retaliate. The other members of the band soon joined in on the fun, strutting onto the stage covered in mud.\n\nOpening with Pretty Hate Machine's \"Terrible Lie,\" NIN turned the massive audience into a giant mosh pit and maintained that high energy until the end of the set. While the band faced technological difficulties onstage, it only seemed to enhance their raw, gritty image.\n\nThe set was so celebrated that it is forever memorialized in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, with art installations featuring a life-sized mannequin replica of Reznor singing into the microphone and his keyboard, both covered in mud.\n\nBy day three, Woodstock '94 was clearly becoming an iconic music festival that would be discussed for years to come. If Saturday's mud-slinging electric performances weren't enough, the final day of the festival featured performances from Green Day, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bob Dylan, Santana, and others.\n\nWhen Green Day — fresh off the success of their third studio album Dookie — took the stage, all hell broke loose. While the band was and continues to be known for their rowdy live sets, their performance at Woodstock '94 remains unmatched.\n\nBy the time Green Day started performing, the fairgrounds had turned into a full-blown mud fight. The band tried to push through the performance and embrace the chaos, but the set came to an abrupt stop when lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong told the crowd, \"Everybody say shut the f— up and we’ll stop playing.\" When the crowd shouted the phrase back, Armstrong said goodbye on behalf of the band, and the rest of the group fled the stage.\n\nBy the end of the performance, lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong had lost his pants and the band had to be escorted out of the festival grounds by a helicopter. On their way off the stage, security confused mud-covered bassist Mike Dirnt for a crazed fan and tackled him, leaving him with five fewer teeth than he started the set with.\n\n\"He actually sheared my teeth, and I blew like five teeth. Only one of them died. I fixed the rest of them, but he all sheared up the back of my teeth,\" Dirnt confessed to The Aquarian in 2013. \"It was horrible. But the great thing about it is that I was able to get out of there, and I'd do it again tomorrow if I had to.\"\n\nPeter Gabriel closed out the weekend by remaining true to the original mission of the festival, offering fans peace filled with good vibes. Gabriel's music, though deeply contrasting with the hard rock and punk acts that dominated the festival, provided a flawless end to the chaos that had unfolded over the past three days.\n\nWhile the 1994 installment of Woodstock hasn't basked in the same spotlight as its 1969 and 1999 siblings — the latter of which has been the subject of two documentaries in as many years — it remains far from forgotten.\n\nWoodstock '94 stands as one of the legendary music festivals of all time. Although the rain may have soaked the grounds, turning it into a muddy catastrophe, it also nourished the roots of some of the most iconic musical acts and sent them into the mainstream media. The festival was more than just a series of performances, but rather a unique cultural event.\n\nLatest Music Festival News\n\n8 Can't-Miss Acts At Afro Nation Detroit 2024: Shenseea, Ayra Starr, Kizz Daniel & More\n\nOn This Day In Music: Woodstock '94 Begins In Upstate New York\n\n7 Stellar Sets From Lollapalooza 2024: Megan Thee Stallion, Future x Metro Boomin & More\n\n10 Cant-Miss Sets At HARD Summer 2024: Disclosure, Boys Noize, INVT & More\n\n10 Must-See Acts At Lollapalooza 2024: Tyla, SiR, Stray Kids, Dominic Fike & More\n\nJune is an important moment in the year, as it brings us Pride Month, Black Music Month and Juneteenth. It also marks the official start of summer, where rising temperatures invite late afternoons enjoying good music — whether it’s outdoors at one of the season’s many festivals or in the comfort of your own home.\n\nAs for the good music, this month brings us plenty of new releases by queer artists, like Kim Petras' long-awaited debut, Feed The Beast, and the Aces’ I’ve Loved You For So Long. Black musicians have much on offer in June as well, including Janelle Monáe (who is also queer) The Age of Pleasure, house music DJ and producer Jayda G’s Guy, and Ghana-born singer Amaarae’s Fountain Baby. Last but not least, June also marks the return of both Foo Fighters and Lucinda Williams after life-altering events, and the ultimate release of Bob Dylan’s 2021 concert film soundtrack, Shadow Kingdom.\n\nTo inspire you further with their bold artistry and moving stories, GRAMMY.com compiled a guide to the 15 must-hear albums dropping June 2023.\n\nFoo Fighters - But Here We Are\n\nRelease date: June 2\n\nIn dark times, humans often turn to art. Even if they have no answers for what the future holds, the transmuting power of expression reminds us that, sometimes, existing is enough. But Here We Are, Foo Fighters’ 11th studio album, does just that.\n\nAfter \"a year of staggering losses, personal introspection and bittersweet remembrances,\" as they state in their website — referring to the sudden loss of longtime drummer, Taylor Hawkins, and of frontman Dave Grohl’s mother, Virginia — they find both grievance and strength in what has been called \"the first chapter of the band’s new life.\"\n\nIn support of this change, Foo Fighters have announced over 25 performances across the U.S. and Europe in the upcoming months. But Here We Are drops on June 2, and features ten new tracks, including promotional singles \"Rescued,\" \"Under You,\" \"Show Me How,\" and \"The Teacher.\"\n\nJuan Wauters - Wandering Rebel\n\nRelease date: June 2\n\nFor most of his life, the Uruguay-born, New York-raised singer Juan Wauters was a rover — never for too long in one place. But as he sings on the upcoming titular track of his new album, Wandering Rebel, \"During COVID I discovered/ that I like stability.\"\n\nIn a statement, Wauters reflected about moving back to his home country because of the pandemic, and the personal changes that came with it: \"New York was the place I always came back to, but I never really had a 'home.' My parents left Uruguay, their home, when I was young. Now, [in Montevideo], I have a place to come home to, and people that are waiting for me.\"\n\nThe 12 songs on Wandering Rebel are defined as \"candid reflections on subjects like career, romantic commitment, mental health, and the personal toll of touring,\" some of which can be seen through singles \"Milanesa al Pan (ft. Zoe Gotusso)\" and \"Modus Operandi (ft. Frankie Cosmos).\" As to not lose sight of his itinerant roots, Wauters will embark on a lengthy U.S. tour starting this month.\n\nBob Dylan - Shadow Kingdom\n\nRelease date: June 2\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic stalled Bob Dylan’s illustrious Never Ending Tour, he decided to baffle the world with something entirely different.\n\nFirst released in 2021 as a concert film directed by Alma Har'el, Shadow Kingdom sees Dylan perform 14 tracks from the first half of his career in an acoustic, intimate atmosphere. In the setlist, \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" from 1965’s Bringing It All Back Home marks the earliest composition to be featured, while \"What Was It You Wanted\" from 1989's Oh Mercy is the latest.\n\nWith little-to-no prior information, the film originally premiered on livestream platform Veeps, and swiftly disappeared 48 hours after. On June 2, an official soundtrack release will revive the experience for all those who missed it.\n\nRancid - Tomorrow Never Comes\n\nRelease date: June 2\n\nBreaking a six-year absence of new music, California’s boisterous Rancid are back. Tomorrow Never Comes, the band’s tenth album, proves that the verve from one of punk rock’s biggest acts in the mid-1990s is still alive.\n\nProduced by longtime collaborator and Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz, the record holds 15 tracks, but runs just short of 29 minutes — Rancid’s briefest album yet. But judging by singles \"Tomorrow Never Comes,\" \"Don't Make Me Do It,\" and \"Devil in Disguise,\" quick-paced or not, the quality remains the same.\n\nRight after the release, Rancid will kick off an European tour for the rest of the month, before hitting Canada and a few cities in the U.S. starting September.\n\nThe Aces - I’ve Loved You For So Long\n\nRelease date: June 2\n\nPride month celebrations have just gotten the perfect soundtrack: I’ve Loved You For So Long, the Aces’ third studio album, comes out on June 2.\n\nPreceded by the title track and singles \"Girls Make Me Wanna Die,\" \"Always Get This Way,\" and \"Solo,\" the album marks the Utah quartet’s first release since 2020’s LP Under My Influence. According to a press release, I’ve Loved You For So Long is \"rife with songs that celebrate their queer identities, juxtaposed by tracks that reflect on their early relationships with Mormonism.\"\n\nThe 11-track collection is also described as \"a nostalgic look back at the formative experiences that shaped who they are as a band today, like pages straight from their diaries that will leave their listeners feeling seen and critics wanting more.\"\n\nJanelle Monáe - The Age of Pleasure\n\nRelease date: June 9\n\nMarking her return to music five years after 2018’s Dirty Computer, the chameleonic singer and actor Janelle Monáe ushers in The Age of Pleasure. Her fourth studio album features 14 tracks, including collaborations from Grace Jones, Amaarae, Seun Kuti, and others.\n\nDuring an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, Monáe said all the songs \"were written from such an honest space,\" with the goal of being \"so specific to this Pan-African crowd who are my friends. I want it to be a love letter to the diaspora.\"\n\nIf its two delightful singles \"Float\" and \"Lipstick Lover\" are any indication, it looks like Monáe has nailed her target — while also providing us a much-needed new era for the summer.\n\nAmaarae - Fountain Baby\n\nRelease date: June 9\n\n\"Coming back after so long, I had a lot of time to think and reflect on what I wanted my message to be. Last time it was about confidence, this time it’s about love and faith,\" said Ghanaian-American singer Amaarae in a statement about her single, \"Reckless & Sweet.\"\n\nThe mystifying track gives a taste of her upcoming sophomore album, Fountain Baby, set to release on June 9. Following her acclaimed 2020 debut The Angel You Don’t Know, the album also features last month’s cheeky \"Co-Star,\" and points to an expansion of the singer’s avant-garde Afro-pop sound, as well as a celebration of Black women all over the world.\n\nJayda G - Guy\n\nRelease date: June 9\n\nCanadian producer and DJ Jayda G was only 10 years old when she lost her father, William Richard Guy. However, his memories shaped her life in significant ways, and now she is ready to share them with the world through her upcoming studio album, Guy.\n\nThrough a press release, Jayda said that she wanted the album to be \"a blend of storytelling, about the African American experience, death, grief, and understanding.\" The singer also added that \"it’s about my dad and his story, and naturally in part my story, too, but it’s also about so many people who wanted more for themselves and went on a search to find that. This album is just so much for people who have been oppressed and who have not had easy lives.\"\n\nThe first single of the project, \"Circle Back Around,\" features archival footage of Jayda and her father — an endearing portrait that ultimately delivers an uplifting message. As she explains further in the press release: \"I think it’s just a testament that it’s never too late to look at yourself and try to understand why you are the way you are, and strive to be better. Understanding the Black man’s experience, Black people’s experience in terms of America, and rising above what society tells you you’re supposed to be.\"\n\nKing Krule - Space Heavy\n\nRelease date: June 9\n\nBritish singer King Krule was inspired by \"the space between\" his London and Liverpool commutes — both places he considers home — to craft Space Heavy, his fourth studio album.\n\nWritten throughout 2020 to 2022, the record was produced by Dilip Harris, and recorded alongside bandmates Ignacio Salvadores, George Bass, James Wilson, and Jack Towell. In April, the hazy \"Seaforth\" was released as the album’s first single.\n\nKing Krule, whose real name is Archy Marshall, will soon embark on a summer tour spanning North America, Europe, and the UK. The first stop is in Minneapolis on July 21.\n\nKiller Mike - Michael\n\nRelease date: June 16\n\nIt’s been more than a decade since Killer Mike released a solo album (2012’s R.A.P. Music), but June brings forward new, exciting material from the Atlanta rapper and member of Run the Jewels. Upcoming LP Michael is said to be his \"most autobiographical\" work so far, and features 14 tracks that depict \"an origin story,\" according to a statement.\n\n2022 singles \"RUN\" and \"Talkin Dat S—!\" are also included in the album, as well as this year’s \"Don’t Let The Devil\" and \"Motherless\" — whose two music videos form a short film paying homage to Mike’s late mother, Mama Niecy. The rapper is also set to perform a 19-stop tour in the U.S. this summer.\n\nHome Is Where - the whaler\n\nRelease date: June 16\n\nFlorida emo band Home Is Where built a reputation for delivering catharsis through their gloomy lyrics and angry melodies. Their upcoming sophomore LP, the whaler, takes that up a notch: It was defined as a project about \"getting used to things getting worse\" in a press release.\n\nProduced by Jack Shirley and containing 10 interconnected songs, the whaler \"paints a bleak picture of a world in an endless state of collapse — of ruined utopias and desperate people faking normalcy — [but] there’s a humanity-affirming undercurrent throughout that screams to break free.\"\n\nAhead of the release, the band shared the lead single \"yes! yes! a thousand times yes!,\" and is currently gearing up for a U.S. tour through the East Coast and Midwest in July and the West Coast in September.\n\nKim Petras - Feed the Beast\n\nRelease date: June 23\n\nThe much-awaited debut LP of German singer Kim Petras, Feed the Beast, finally has a birth date: June 23. After struggling with the leaking and eventual scrapping of would-have-been album Problématique, Petras compiled 15 tracks for this new effort — including last year’s mega hit \"Unholy\" featuring Sam Smith, which earned them both a GRAMMY Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.\n\nIn an interview with Vice, the singer said Feed the Beast marks \"a transition from being an independent artist to being at a major label now. Spearheaded by singles \"If Jesus Was a Rockstar,\" \"Brrr,\" and lead single \"Alone\" featuring Nicki Minaj, Petras will celebrate the release with a performance at NBC’s TODAY Citi Concert Series, as well as live sets at Governor’s Ball in NYC and Life is Beautiful Festival in Las Vegas.\n\nLunice - OPEN\n\nRelease date: June 23\n\nDescribed as a project that \"focuses on the natural human ability and behavior of intuition, instinct, openness, flexibility, and adaptation,\" and also as \"a bizarre ride through the Montreal underground,\" OPEN is the sophomore album by Canadian producer and TNGHT member, Lunice.\n\nFollowing up his 2017 acclaimed solo debut, CCCLX, the new record aims to be even more dynamic, with every track conceived to be performed live. Featuring collaborations with Cali Cartier, Zach Zoya, Yuki Dreams Again, DAGR and GRAMMY-winning producer DRTWRK, OPEN drops on June 23.\n\n\"No Commas,\" the pulsating first single off the project, sets the mood to the upcoming folly. \"This track is the result of multiple natural occurrences where the melody, drums, and vocal performance coincidentally fit with each other in the moment of creation without any prior motive behind it,\" Lunice said in a statement. \"I find these instinctual moments of creativity beautiful and inspiring.\"\n\nMaisie Peters - The Good Witch\n\nBritish singer/songwriter Maisie Peters calls herself The Good Witch — the \"keeper of the keys and the holder of the cards\" to her own universe, soon on display through her upcoming second album.\n\nWritten last year while she was on tour, Peters explains that its 15 tracks represent a time when she was \"searching for balance between career highs and personal lows,\" a quality that can be seen through \"Body Better,\" the album’s acutely honest lead single.\n\n\"This is my heart and soul, my blood on the page, the collection of stories that I’ve managed to capture in the past year,\" said Peters. \"A true chronicle of my life in recent history, it is my own twisted version of a breakup album and it all draws upon the same couple of months’ worth of experiences and inspirations.\"\n\nThe singer is also set to tour 27 cities in the U.S. and Canada from August to October.\n\nLucinda Williams - Stories From a Rock n Roll Heart\n\nRelease date: June 30\n\nLucinda Williams is living proof that getting older doesn’t mean getting duller. The Americana legend just celebrated her 70th birthday in January — and the last three years of her life have been some of the most tumultuous yet.\n\nIn 2020, her Nashville home was damaged by a tornado. Then, came the COVID-19 pandemic. And lastly, a stroke that affected her ability to play the guitar, therefore changing the way she writes songs. But Williams didn’t let any of that stop her — Stories from a Rock n Roll Heart, her 15th studio album, comes out on June 30, and shows that she’s only getting better.\n\nThe project already has three singles out: \"New York Comeback,\" \"Stolen Moments,\" and \"Where the Song Will Find Me,\" and counts on backing vocals from artists like Bruce Springsteen, Patti Scialfa, and Angel Olsen.\n\nListen To GRAMMY.com's LGBTQIA+ Pride Month 2023 Playlist Featuring Demi Lovato, Sam Smith, Kim Petras, Frank Ocean, Omar Apollo & More\n\nPretty much everyone in the Western world knows Bob Dylan is eminently cagey and elusive. But to the point that a 4,000-word interview still leaves you scratching your head?\n\nSaid Q&A appears in a recent issue of The Wall Street Journal. Questions abound: which TV shows would he designate as \"dog a—\"? Has he really \"seen Metallica twice\"? And regarding his new book, and why he thanked the crew from Dunkin' Donuts? We got a non-answer.\n\nFile them all away with questions about his Victoria's Secret commercial, as well as all his misdirections in the recent Rolling Thunder Revue doc: Bob's gonna Bob.\n\nGRAMMY.com can't claim to have all the answers — who does? — but it can at least address some oft-posed questions about the 10-time GRAMMY winner. Read on for eight of them.\n\nWhy Did Dylan Change His Name?\n\nCommon wisdom dictates that Robert Zimmerman changed his name based on his love of the poet Dylan Thomas; all the way back in 1961, he swatted that down.\n\n\"Straighten out in your book that I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas,\" he told The New York Times. \"Dylan Thomas' poetry is for people that aren't really satisfied in their bed — for people who dig masculine romance.\"\n\nHe may have not directly lifted his name from Thomas, but he was in the ether. And \"Bob Dylan\" was actually one of several nicknames he tried on; it's just the one that stuck.\n\nAs to a single, concrete reason why? It remains to be seen.\n\nWhat Inspired \"Like a Rolling Stone\"?\n\nIs it about Edie Sedgwick? Joan Baez? Marianne Faithfull? None of the above? The epochal \"Like a Rolling Stone\" is naturally one of the most analyzed tunes by Dylanologists.\n\nTo answer this question, it's almost impossible to grab onto a single human subject. The most realistic scenario was outlined by Dylan himself: a generalized feeling of revenge.\n\nWhat Inspired \"Blowin' in the Wind\"?\n\nHung on the melody to the pre-Civil War spiritual \"No More Auction Block For Me,\" the elliptical \"Blowin' in the Wind\" became a cherished civil rights anthem, was covered by hundreds of artists, and recently fetched $1.8 million for a one-of-a-kind record.\n\nAs Dylan has explained, the song's list of deeply felt, rhetorical questions is its essence; it's not about any one world event, but the entire nature of peace, war and brotherhood.\n\n\"[The answers] ain't in no book or movie or TV show or discussion group,\" Dylan said at the time of its writing. \"Man, it's in the wind — and it's blowing in the wind.\"\n\nWhy Did Dylan Paint His Face?\n\nNo, Dylan's face makeup on the Rolling Thunder Revue tour wasn't due to seeing KISS in Queens — thank you very much.\n\nThat was one of the many misdirections in Martin Scorcese's 2019 doc Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story. Rather, the lion's share of the evidence points to Dylan finding inspiration in the 1945 French film Children of Paradise.\n\nWhat Religion Is Bob Dylan?\n\nIt's flickered back and forth over the years, most intensely during Dylan's born-again Christian period in the '80s. The following decade, Dylan seemed to set the record straight:\n\n\"This is the flat-out truth: I find the religiosity and philosophy in the music. I don't find it anywhere else,\" he told Newsweek in 1997. Songs like 'Let Me Rest on a Peaceful Mountain' or 'I Saw the Light' — that's my religion. I don't adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all of that. I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any of this kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.\"\n\nThen again, Dylan just said \"I'm a religious person. I read the scriptures a lot, meditate and pray, light candles in church. I believe in damnation and salvation, as well as predestination.\"\n\nIs that simply proof that a lot can change in 25 years? Or another winking bit of misdirection? The answer is… well, you know.\n\nWhy Did Dylan Not Accept His Nobel Prize?\n\nHe did. After months of uncertainty and speculation as to whether he would. Whatever the reason for the lag, Dylan accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature graciously, calling the honor \"truly beyond words\" and akin to \"standing on the moon.\"\n\nWhat Is Bob Dylan Up To In 2022?\n\nDylan stepped out with the rare Wall Street Journal interview because he's promoting The Philosophy of Modern Song, his predictably strange, illuminating and quixotic 2022 breakdown of canonical tunes that galvanize and inspire him.\n\nAs far as the young 2023? On Jan. 27, he'll release Fragments, a boxed set encompassing the sessions around his beloved 1997 album Time Out of Mind.\n\nIs Bob Dylan On Tour?\n\nAmazingly, Dylan is still on his so-called Never Ending Tour, which has been rolling up, down, to and fro interstates since 1988.\n\nAnd after a pandemic-related break from the road, he promises the current leg, which promotes his latest album Rough and Rowdy Ways, will continue until 2024.\n\nAnd a lot can happen in those two years. Maybe even that Metallica collab, sponsored by Dunkin' Donuts? Bob knows.\n\nHere's What Went Down At Bob Dylan's Mysterious \"Shadow Kingdom\" Livestream Concert"
