        "text": "I don't know. I've barely scratched the surface of African music but I realize it's a whole 'nother world. I feel the same about Bollywood, Indonesian, Japanese, Hawaiian, etc.. It's confusing but it's also wonderful.\n\nI'm not sure of what's the easy answer here. My own engagemnt with African musics of various kinds has only grwon in fits and starts over a long period of time. A couple of key things that helped me at a few points along the way:\n\n1) The African chapters of the 2 volume Rough Guide to World Music. Very informative, with actual CD recommendations, some of which are actually in print)!\n\n2) Boxed Sets and series like Ellipsis Arts' Africa: Never Stand Still, the sets called MASA: Musiques du Continent Africain, the Ethiopiques series on Buda Musique, and the amazing recent offerings from Soundway (the Nigeria Special and Ghana Special sets), Analogue Africa (an amazing series of recent sets of obscure material from various places, especially from Benin and Togo), and Network (the Golden Afriques sets).\n\nL.\n\nThe BBC made a six part series, I believe it was called the African Rock And Roll Years, though I may be wrong, annoyingly they've not repeated it, yet, but if you can find the shows on the internet then watch them, each programme deals with a different part of the continent and gives you a really good overview.\n\nOther than that there are as many different styles of African music as there are European and American so you probably need to narrow your search down, I'm pretty sure there are already some threads on the forum.\n\nWell this is certainly not the only place to learn, there are many- most of which I sure I am not even aware of. But there's a lot of good info in THIS THREAD over on the organissimo forum. There's 10 pages or so of postings, many from some pretty knowledgeable folks. African music is one of my favorite genres with much great music to discover.\n\nFWIW, this forum is hosted by members of the band organissimo. Many former members of the old Blue Note Bulletin Board chat group gravitated over to organissimo several years ago, when the BNBB was abruptly terminated. It is mainly a jazz oriented site, but we discuss all sorts of music..\n\nAnother sublime series is from the Paris-based Syllart label -they really know their stuff. They have a range of albums under the banner \"African Pearls\" -could not be better named. Great intro to Congo, Senegal, Mali etc.\n\nAfrica is just too large and every tribe got his own groove, some of the more poular artists that I like are King Sunny Ade - the first african super star besides of course FELA KUTI, who was more a Jazz giant, than authentic african music maker as important as he was his Funk was too heavy for a local act. JuJu Beats master King Sunny Ade played one of the absolute best Live shows i ever happen to be a part of - 1994 in The Hague on a large Free Open Air Festival woth more than 100.000 people watching, lots of black folks in african vlothes- Bery very good, Island Record released a few of his 70ies albums. The next on gotta be south africans saxophon player and singer Hugh Masekela whose HOPE Live album is availble on SACD - wonderful and a must have addition to every good record collection. Others worth our undivided attention are Salif Keita, Tiken Jah Felony, the Reggae kings Alpha Blondy and the south african Lucky Dube (R.I.P.) killed by a car jacking in Joburg some time ago..\n\nTrue african musicians that are as talented as our best Rock and Soul artists are the west african Baaba Maal http://www.baabamaal.tv/television.html and my true personal favorite african musician - the dreadlocked Islam priest / magician and poet with his incredible uplifting and beautiful magical sound the drummer / singer\n\nhttp://www.leopardmannen.no/l/lo.cheikh.asp CHEIKH LO - my favorite albums I got by him is called Ne Las Thiass - just wonderful !\n\nBut you can just buy any of those, He even recorded one in Cuba - the rhythms match well Rhumba and the Mbalanx from Senegal.\n\nOf course they all are associated with the great Youssou N'Dour a friend of Peter GabrielFinally the first african artists tht attracted my attaention were Toure Kunda with this great Live album from 1984 (enegal, the centre of attention) http://www.afromix.org/html/musique/artistes/toure-kunda/live-paris-ziguinchor.en.html\n\nIf you though this was a lot, we haven't scratched the surface yet...\n\nAfrica is not monolithic, so it's a very odd question. It's like asking, \"European music, where to start?\" Well, Russian music sounds nothing like Irish music. Likewise, Highlife and Afrobeat from West Africa doesn't sound like East African music. Hell, there are many differences in West African music itself.\n\nAs a Nigerian, I will admit bias for West African music, so I will tell you to start there. I won't recommend the usual Fela Kuti etc because it may be hard for some people to grasp.\n\nInstead, start out with Ali Farka Toure and Toumani Diabate, maybe some Rokia Traore. Great Malian musicians, with crossover appeal for a western palette.\n\nThen you can move on to stuff like Obo Addy, Ebo Taylor, Segun Buknor, Tony Allen, Pax Nicholas, Fela etc."
