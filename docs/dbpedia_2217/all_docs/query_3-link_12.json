        "text": "Global bachata icon Prince Royce is set to release his seventh studio album titled \"Llamada Perdida\" - a two-year creative journey that promises to be his most personal and uplifting release yet. The album is a celebration of overcoming obstacles, particularly in love, and represents the end of a chapter in life and embracing the excitement of a fresh start. \"Llamada Perdida\" takes a positive approach to heartbreak and its aftermath. The bachata album features 23 tracks, some of which include classical instrumentation like violins as a nod to his early days.\n\nFans can expect to hear Prince Royce's signature sound while also experiencing a new and elevated level of artistry on \"Llamada Perdida. The album is a testament to Royce's growth as an artist, with more mature lyrics and a more self-confident sound. The songs are strewn together via voicemail messages, serving as interludes to certain tracks.\n\n\"This edition of Original Sufferhead is a major event. With the release of box set #5, and now on this reissue, the title track of this magnificent album is presented in its full-length, 25 minutes 24 seconds glory. While preparing the master disc for the box set, our engineer Jedi, Colin Young, discovered four minutes of lost material on the B-side of the original pressing, including a superb keyboard solo by Fela. This had been omitted from subsequent reissues. The restored version used here starts and finishes with Felas keyboard work, a typically venturesome blend of futurism and visceralism.\n\nOriginal Sufferhead was the first album Fela released under Egypt 80s name (he had disbanded Afrika 70 in 1979).\n\nOn the title track, arguing from the personal to the political, Fela describes the inhuman treatment and poor living conditions experienced by working class Nigerians, the people he called sufferheads. In Power Show, Fela sings about the two-tier system dividing Nigerian society, in which the rich get treated one way and the poor another. This edition is pressed on ewuro (opaque light green) vinyl.\"\n\n\"Fela used the cover of Ikoyi Blindness to announce his change of middle name from Ransome, which he now considered a slave name, to Anikulapo, which means he who carries death in his pouch. The front cover shows Ransome crossed out and Anikulapo added above it. Fela also used the album cover to announce the Africanisation of Africa 70s name, changing it to Afrika 70.\n\nIn the title track, Fela draws attention to the economic chasm separating the haves and have-nots of Nigerian society, contrasting the get-rich-at-all-costs mindset of the residents of the prosperous Lagos suburb Ikoyi with the more community-minded attitude of the poor inhabitants of the Mushin, Maroko, Ajegunle and Somolu neighbourhoods. Ikoyi residents are blind to the sufferings of less fortunate people, says Fela.\n\nFela returns to the topic on the second track, Gba Mi Leti Ki NDolowo (Slap Me Make I Get Money). In Lagos in 1975 and 1976, there had been an upsurge in police and military personnel assaults on people in the street; motorists were commonly pulled out of their vehicles and given a whipping for minor traffic offences. Scandalously, the police and soldiers were being allowed to get away with corruption in broad daylight. In the lyric, Fela demands that the judiciary administer the law equally, without fear or favour. This edition is pressed on iresi(opaque white) vinyl.\"\n\nITZY is back and ready to make a statement with their latest album BORN TO BE, which will be available in three versions: Version A, Version B and Version C. Contents of the album include: CD, Photobook (60 pages), Photo Card (random 2 of 16), Lyric Book (24 pages), Mini-Folding Poster (random 1 of 4), Eyes Photo Card (random 1 of 4), Mood Film (random 1 of 4), Post Card (random 1 of 4), Poster (random 1 of 2). Dimensions: 210 x 150 x 5 mm.\n\nBig Big Love is the first single from the eponymous album that is a mantra for embracing humanity with kindness. The single will be released in conjunction with the Michael Franti & Spearhead tour date celebrating a return to Red Rocks on June 2. Franti announced the US Big Big Love tour on January 31 which launched May 13 and runs through August 20.\n\nMichael Franti is a globally recognized musician, humanitarian, activist, and award-winning filmmaker revered for his high-energy live shows, inspiring music, devotion to health and wellness, worldwide philanthropic efforts and the power of optimism. Throughout his multi-decade career, Franti has earned three Billboard No. 1's with triumphantly hopeful hits \"Sound of Sunshine,\" \"Say Hey (I Love You),\" and \"I Got You,\" as well as sic Top 30 Hot AC singles, 10 Top 25 AAA singles and three Billboard Top 5 Rock Albums.\n\nMichael Franti & Spearhead continue to foster their community both on and off stage with a wish granting non-profit, Do It For The Love, founded by Franti and his wife, Sara. Do It For The Love brings those with life threatening illnesses, veterans, and children with severe challenges to concerts worldwide, fulfilling over 3,300 wishes and touching the lives of over 12,000 people to date. Franti also owns SOULSHINE Bali, a 32-room top-rated boutique retreat hotel located in Ubud, Bali."
