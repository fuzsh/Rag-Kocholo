        "text": "Description\n\nNowhere is the beat of a drum more symbolic of a culture than in Africa, where it's forever been the heartbeat of daily life. From the trance percussion of South Sudan to the gnawa groove of Morocco, this is an exploration into a continent's rhythmic life source.\n\nDescription\n\nThis Rough Guide highlights how rhythm is the defining trait of African music and features guardians and masters of ancient but living musical traditions. It's a seamless collection of tracks from diverse countries including Lesotho, South Sudan and Niger.\n\nFeaturing an array of percussive instruments, from the well-known djembe to obscure log drums and xylophones, from the ever popular benga beat of Kenge Kenge to the junk-funk of Sotho Sounds, this is a cutting-edge collection of trance-inducing grooves, which create an unstoppable expression of freedom and liberation\n\nUndoubtedly some of the best African music you've never heard."
