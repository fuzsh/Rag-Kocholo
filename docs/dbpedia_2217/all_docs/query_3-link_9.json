        "text": "World Music Network has taken audiences around the globe so many times over the years, to nations that many know at times, and at others to nations of which people may be less familiar. From China to the American south, to Japan, to the various nations of Africa, to Scotland and so many other countries, the label has taken audiences on those trips through various musical compilations, each impressive in its own right. This past August, the company took audiences on yet another interesting trip, this time to the storied former Soviet republic of Tajikistan in the form of Lost in Tajikistan. Spanning 15 songs that run a total of 79 minutes, this latest offering from World Music Network and Riverboat Records proves an interesting new musical trip grounded primarily in its varied musical arrangements. Those arrangements will be examined shortly. The compilation’s liner notes prove to be both positive and somewhat negative, building on the record’s foundation and slightly detracting from its presentation, too. This will be discussed a little later. The collection’s production rounds out its most important elements and will also be examined later. Each item noted here is important in its own way to the whole of Lost in Tajikistan. All things considered they make the collection a mostly welcome addition to this year’s field of new World Music offerings, even despite its one shortcoming.\n\nLost in Tajikistan, the recently released World Music offering from Riverboat Records and World Music Network, is a presentation that audiences will find an interesting collection from the two companies. That is due in large part to its featured musical arrangements. From beginning to end, the 15 songs that make up the record’s body were performed by a handful of acts – Samo, Davlat Sanzar, Shanbe, and Mizrob. According to the information provided in the collection’s liner notes, all of the acts featured herein are from various regions of Tajikistan. The overall style of each song is notably similar in its approach but at the same time, the subtleties in the arrangements are such that those who fully immerse themselves in the record. Case in point is the late entry, ‘Dili Dilidor.’ The collection’s eighth entry, this song pairs what sounds like tablas with specific string arrangements, guitar and electronics for what sounds like a very western hip-hop influenced style composition. That is evidenced just as much through the almost percussive approach of the vocals alongside the instrumentation.\n\nBy comparison, an earlier entry, such as ‘Laylijon’ comes across as being more rooted in the nation’s own musical culture while having an ever so subtle almost pop style approach in the vocals. In other words, what audiences get in this song is a work that blends elements of vintage Tajik musical influence with more modern leanings for another unique overall composition that holds its own alongside ‘Dili Dilidor’ and other songs featured here.\n\nOn yet another note, a song, such as the even later entry, ‘Bakhor’ takes listeners in yet another direction. In the case of this completely instrumental composition, feels entirely rooted in the region’s musical history. There is something in the simple approach that immediately leads to the adage of less being more. The overall arrangement is almost folk in its style but more folk in connection with the country than any western influence. Again, it is one more example of the subtle differences in the collection’s works that make the songs so worth hearing even with the overarching stylistic similarities in the arrangements. When it and the other songs examined here are considered along with the rest of the compilation’s entries, the whole makes the overall musical side of Lost in Tajikistan reason enough for audiences to hear this record.\n\nThe musical content featured in Lost in Tajikistan is just part of the reason for audiences to take in the record. The liner notes that accompany the record add to its interest, at least to a point. Throughout the record’s companion booklet, the liner notes – composed by Lu Edmonds – point out the challenges that Edmonds faced in order to make the compilation a reality. From having to figure out how to even record the performances featured herein (he points out having to get the recording equipment to the sites was a challenge in itself) to facing less than great weather to making the trips to various locations and more, Edmonds’ recollections show a lot of time and effort really did go into bringing the compilation to life. The revelations therein make for plenty of appreciation for the record’s primary content. At the same time though, there is no discussion on the background of any of the songs, in regard to whether they are original works or traditional. In addition, there are no translations for the songs that include vocals. It would have been nice to have known whether the songs featured here are originals or traditional, and by connection, if they are traditional, what are their stories. On that same note, lacking any translation or background for the words in the other specific songs detracts from the overall engagement and entertainment, too. To that end, the liner notes presented here are both positive and negative.\n\nMoving on from the mixed bag that is the liner notes, the production of the songs is positive in its own right, too. Again noting the challenges that Edmonds pointed out in his narrative, the songs sound surprisingly clean and clear. As a matter of fact they sound just as impressive as anything recorded in a professional studio. To that end, Edmonds and all involved in the production are to be commended for their efforts, as the result is quite impressive. Keeping that in mind, when the songs’ production is considered alongside the songs themselves and even some of the liner notes’ information, the whole makes for all the more engagement and entertainment and another mostly welcome addition to this year’s field of new World Music records.\n\nLost in Tajikistan, the recently released World Music compilation from Riverboat Records and World Music Network, is an interesting new offering from the companies. Its appeal comes in large part through its songs, which blend influences of East and West alongside modern and vintage Tajikistan musical influences. The arrangements are subtle in their differences even with a specific overarching stylistic approach. The liner notes that accompany that primary content add at least some appeal through the background on how the compilation came to be. The lack of any background on the songs themselves and translations for the vocals does detract from the overall enjoyment, though. It is not enough to doom the record, luckily. To that end, the production of the songs proves just as pivotal to its success as the songs themselves, considering the challenges that were faced in order to bring them to audiences. Keeping that in mind, the production works with the songs themselves to make the collection another offering from Riverboat Records and World Music Network that while imperfect, still largely impresses.\n\nLost in Tajikistan is available now through Riverboat Records and World Music Network. More information on this and other titles from Riverboat Records is available at:\n\nWebsite: http://www.worldmusic.net\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/WorldMusicNetwork\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/WMN_UK\n\nTo keep up with the latest entertainment reviews and news, go online to http://www.facebook.com/philspicks and “Like” it. Fans can always keep up with the latest entertainment reviews and news in the Phil’s Picks blog at https://philspicks.wordpress.com.\n\nLate last month, international music duo and married couple Faith and Branko released its new album, Duhovi through World Music Network and Riverboat Records. The 14-song record is an interesting addition to this year’s field of new World Music offerings that is well worth hearing. Its overall content, both musical and lyrical, makes that clear. While the record’s general content forms a relatively solid foundation for the album, its liner notes detract from the engagement and entertainment that said general content establishes at least to a point. The concerns raised through the liner notes are not enough to doom the album, though. To that end, the sequencing of the record’s featured songs work with the songs themselves to ensure audiences’ engagement and entertainment even more. That is because of the general effect that the sequencing creates. This will also be examined later. Each item noted here is important in its own way to the whole of the album’s presentation. All things considered they make Duhovi a mostly successful offering from the duo.\n\nDuhovi, the new album from Faith and Branko, is a mostly positive presentation from the married couple and its fellow band of musicians. Its success comes in part through its featured songs. The songs do well from one to the next to blend the group’s European and American influences. Such is exemplified clearly through the album’s lead single, ‘Techno.’ Coming almost halfway through the album’s 67-minute (one hour, seven minute) run time, the blending of the rocking fiddle line and the simple yet infectious guitar line and drumming gives the song a little bit of a ska/rock vibe while also incorporating the group’s European influences solidly. The whole stands uniquely apart from the rest of the songs featured in this record and is so fun throughout its nearly five-and-a-half-minute run time. On another note, the somber, melancholy ‘Mey,’ which comes much later in the album’s run, is just as different from ‘Techno’ and the rest of the album’s entries as that song is from anything else on the album. The use of the accordion and strings here paint a picture of a French café while also creating something of a slight Romanian gypsy-esque sensibility. The mood is not necessarily sad here, just somber for the most part yet so immersive and engrossing. That is due to the control of the dynamics and the production that resulted in all parts being so well balanced. Mr. and Mrs. Ristic and their fellow musicians switch things up even more even later in the album in ‘Penrith,’ the album’s penultimate track. The electric violin that is paired up here with the Afro-Latin percussion and guitars gives this song its own extremely unique presentation that defies all categorization in the most positive way possible. The whole in this case is so surprisingly infectious and fun. Between this song, the others examined here and the rest of the album’s arrangements, the songs that make up this record are so unique in the best way possible. Collectively, they give audiences reason enough to take in this record.\n\nWhile the overall musical content that makes up Duhovi’s body is clearly successful, the liner notes outlining the songs’ backgrounds detract from the engagement and entertainment generated by the primary content, at least to a point. That is because while given, at least some background is offered on the songs’ creation, not all of the background is fully clear. Case in point is the background on, say, the album’s title track. Faith points out about this song, “I created this piece as it was recorded. I learned to play in difficult circumstances, without two strings or a teacher. Only when I play am I truly happy. Music is my soul, my greatest love and how I experience God and the universe.” So what audiences get here is that the song was likely created in perhaps an improvisational style. Other than that, Mrs. Ristic does not necessarily offer much else in the way of background. The composition is beautiful. There is no denying that at all. The way that Branko’s bow makes its way across the strings of his violin is stunning. The layering of the string arrangement here is so impacting with its modern classical style and sound. The thing is though, was a difficult situation what led to the song’s apparent improvised creation? That is not really answered here. So in the end, what listeners get is an appreciation of the song, yes, but primarily on the surface. More explanation would have deepened that appreciation.\n\nThe information provided about ‘Ludilo,’ the album’s midpoint, is another example of the issue with the album’s liner notes. Listeners are told through the brief discussion, Branko recorded the song with his fellow violinist cousin Kristijan Petrovic. Branko points out the arrangement is meant to show “the beauty of the acoustic Serbian-Romani sound.” That is a good starting point, but still leaves the proverbial door wide open as to the song’s creation. What was the inspiration here? What was the creative process? Even something like that could have been included albeit in a condensed presentation. As with ‘Duhovi’ having at least that slight amount more would have deepened listeners’ appreciation for this impressive song and the talent of its performers.\n\nPerhaps the clearest and most concise of the liner notes are for the late entry, 2018. Branko explains in the notes here, the song centers on the year 2018 and the death of his grandmother. The understanding that he provides gives quite the interesting context to the frenetic energy presented throughout the song. The energy, the controlled chaos of the arrangement perhaps mirrors the conflicting, racing thoughts that must have gone through his mind prior to, during and after her death. What’s more, it really becomes interesting that Branko and company did not go the typical route and just make some mournful composition about the situation. Going that unexpected route here just adds to the interest. When this group of notes is considered along with the others examined here and with the rest of the album’s liner notes, the result is not wholly negative, but does still leave at least a little something to be desired. Hopefully the clearly hugely talented couple and their fellow musicians will take that into account with their next studio release and make that one that much fuller.\n\nKnowing that the liner notes featured in Duhovi are at least somewhat successful in their mission, one would turn one’s attention to one more full positive featured here, the songs’ sequencing. The sequencing of this record is so important because of the positive general effect that it generates. From the album’s beginning to its end, the sequencing keeps the songs’ sounds and styles changing from one to the next. In similar fashion, they keep the album’s energy moving fluidly, too. The whole starts with an interesting Middle Eastern vibe in ‘Lari Lon’. According to the liner notes, that Middle Eastern vibe is actually Indian. Branko explains that the song was inspired by the music of his favorite Bollywood movie. The mood and energy changes immediately following that song in ‘I’m Sorry,’ which apparently is a song about a breakup. It is also the only song featured in this record that includes a vocal performance. The style and mood changes yet again in the already discussed album’s title track, which is the album’s third entry. The changes in sound, style and mood remain constant from there on to the album’s end in all of the best ways possible. The result is a general effect that does just as much to make this album engaging and entertaining as the album’s primary content. Keeping that in mind, those two elements, and the album’s at least somewhat positive liner note information, the whole makes Duhovi a positive entry in this year’s field of new World Music offerings.\n\nDuhovi, the new album from married musicians Faith and Branko Pristic (Faith and Branco for the sake of the act’s name), is an interesting presentation for any World Music fan. That is evidenced clearly through the album’s primary content, its songs. The songs vary constantly from one to the next, evoking so much emotion while blending the couple’s European roots and some American influence just as expertly. Some background is offered on the songs, which is a positive, though at least a little more would have helped the album’s presentation even more. The songs’ sequencing puts the finishing touch to the album’s presentation. It ensures a positive general effect results from listening to the album. Each item noted is important in its own way to the whole of this album. All things considered they make Duhovi a welcome addition to this year’s field of new World Music albums.\n\nDuhovi is available now through Riverboat Records and World Music Network.

This past April, World Music Network paid tribute to the realm of Delta Blues and the artists who made it so popular in its infancy through its compilation record, The Rough Guide to Delta Blues Vol. 2. The 26-song record is hardly the first of its kind of World Music Network, having come 20 years after the company released the collection’s predecessor. Other compilations featuring well-known Delta Blues artists, such as Charley Patton, Robert Johnson, and Blind Boy Fuller have all come along since, too. To that end, fans of the blues and Delta Blues have gotten plenty of Delta Blues music since the release of that first Delta Blues compilation. That aside, the set presented here is enjoyable in its own right. That is due in large part to its featured songs, which will be discussed shortly. The liner notes that accompany the set’s musical content add to the engagement and will be addressed a little later. The record’s production rounds out its most important elements and will also be examined later. Each item noted here is important in its own way to the whole of the compilation. All things considered they make the set yet another enjoyable addition to WMN’s ongoing The Rough Guide To… series of compilations.\n\nThe Rough Guide to Delta Blues Volume 2 is an enjoyable new collection of Delta Blues from World Music Network. It is a presentation that will appeal equally to fans od Delta Blues and blues alike. That is due in large part to its featured songs. The songs that make up the compilation’s body come from a time period when Delta Blues were really gaining popularity among American audiences. The earliest of the songs featured in the set were recorded in 1928, which would have been just past the infancy of the genre’s popularity. From there, the songs span a time frame reaching all the way to 1940, a point at which Delta Blues really had gained real traction among audiences. What’s more, the songs featured are from names that many listeners might not know. They include the likes of Mississippi Matilda, Rube Lacey, and and Jelly Jaw Short. At the same time, others, such as Son House, Tommy Johnson, and Memphis Minnie, perhaps the most well-known female Delta Blues singer of all time. So basically, what audiences get from this collection of songs is a history lesson of sorts. It is another nice addition to the ongoing history of the genre that WMN has been presenting for years.\n\nThe musical content featured in The Rough Guide to Delta Blues Volume 2 forms a solid foundation for the compilation and is just one part of what makes the set worth hearing. The liner notes that accompany the musical content add their own share of interest to the presentation. The liner notes open by pointing out the role that race played in the popularity of Delta Blues early on, making for a starting point on discussions centered on said topic. The history lesson also points out the supposed birthplace of the genre, Clarksdale, Mississippi and the Dockery Plantation. The apparent rise, fall and then resurgence of the genre’s popularity in the 1960s also gets a mention in the liner notes, making for a starting point for another discussion in itself on a separate topic. There is even a mention of the role of women in the blues community as part of the liner notes, a starting point for yet another discussion. All things considered here, the liner notes featured in this collection strengthen the foundation formed by the record’s content and make for even more engagement and entertainment.\n\nFor all that the primary and secondary content does to make this set engaging and entertaining, there is still one more item to note in examining the presentation. That item is the record’s production. The production is, as always, so notable because of the audio quality. Once again, the static that was so audible on the recordings’ original vinyl releases cuts through so nicely here. There is no loss at any point, either. To that end, the CD presentation here sounds just like it was a vinyl release, further showing that vinyl will never replace CDs. Keeping that in mind along with the positive impact of the record’s overall content, the whole makes this set yet another positive addition to this year’s field of new blues records and another positive addition to World Music Network’s ongoing The Rough Guide To… series of compilations.\n\nThe Rough Guide to Delta Blues Volume 2, the latest blues compilation from World Music Network, is another positive offering from the record label that blues fans across the board will enjoy. The record’s success comes in large part through its featured musical content. That is because of the picture that the arrangements paint and the history that they present in themselves. The liner notes that accompany the record’s content add their own appeal to the whole because they add even more history to the presentation. The production of the record once again makes the collection just as enjoyable in its general effect as any vinyl record. Each item examined is important in its own way to the whole of the compilation. All things considered they make the set one more welcome offering for blues fans from World Music Network’s ongoing The Rough Guide To… series of compilations.\n\nThe Rough Guide to Delta Blues Volume 2 is available now.

The 18-song collection is an interesting new offering focused on the music and culture of the Jewish community. That is due in part through its featured arrangements, which will be discussed shortly. While the musical content that makes up the record’s body is important to its presentation, the set is not perfect. That is because there are no English translations for any of the songs that feature lyrics. This will be discussed a little later. While the lack of English translations for the lyrics is problematic, it is not enough of an issue to doom the set. To that end, there is still one other positive in the form of the record’s liner notes. The liner notes that accompany the record’s musical content make for their own interest and will be addressed a little later. Each item noted is important in its own way to the whole of the compilation. All things considered they make the set yet another engaging and entertaining addition to WMN’s ongoing The Rough Guide To… compilation series.\n\nThe Rough Guide To Jewish Music is a simply-titled new presentation from World Music Network, but as simple as its title is, the 18-song record is anything but simple. That is proven in part through the record’s musical content. From beginning to end, the arrangements are anything but what audiences would think of when they think of Jewish music. Yes, there are some arrangements featured here that have that familiar violin and clarinet-based instrumentations, but they are few and far between. Rather, the arrangements take listeners on a trip around the world, showing the reach of the Jewish community and its culture. Right from the record’s outset, audiences are treated to what sounds like a Spanish-infused composition in ‘Adio Kerida.’ Roughly translated, the title means ‘Bye, Dear.’ That would make sense, what with the mention of a corazon (or heart in English) and some of the other content that can be translated here. The somber mood of the arrangement adds to the sense that this song is about a broken relationship. The distinct vocal style and the use of the strings are what really bring out the Jewish influence here alongside the more familiar Spanish leaning. It makes for an interesting start to the set, especially being that it gives way to the much more familiar Jewish style composition that is ‘Tornado Albastru’ next. As the record progresses, audiences are eventually taken on a trip to Egypt in ‘El Rey Nimrod.’ The vocal styling and instrumentation here make that influence fully audible. It is one of the compilation’s most notable entries. On yet another note, audiences get a piece that exhibits some perhaps eastern European influence even later in ‘Shalom Aleykhem.’ That is made clear through the use of the string arrangement, accordion and vocals. There is almost a certain Romanian gypsy influence here. Meanwhile the use of what sounds like a recorder alongside it all adds the slightest Renaissance influence to make for an overall composition that is unique in its own right. Right from there, the compilation takes audiences back to the Middle East, in ‘Sien Drahmas Al Dia.’ Translated from Judeo-Spanish, the song’s title means ‘One Hundred Drachmas A Day’. Apparently, the song is another love song of sorts sung from a woman’s standpoint, wanting her love interest to break away from his mother. It is a fiery composition, too, which would make sense considering the noted apparent lyrical theme here. When this arrangement and the others examined here are considered along with the rest of the record’s entries, the overall musical presentation makes for a wonderful examination of the reach of Jewish music around the world.\n\nWhile the musical content that makes up the body of The Rough Guide to Jewish Music is pivotal to its appeal, the record is not perfect. As noted, there are not English translations for any of the songs featured here with vocals. The end result is that audiences have to hunt down the songs and try to find said translations for themselves in hopes that those translations exist. This can be somewhat time consuming depending on the song and what may or may not be available. To that end, this is unquestionably problematic to the record’s presentation. It is not enough to doom the record but is still enough of an issue to address.\n\nKnowing that the lack of English translations in this collection is problematic but not enough so that it makes the record a failure, there is still one more positive to note. That positive is the background on the songs provided through the record’s liner notes. The liner notes point out right from their outset that the purpose of this compilation was not so much to focus on Jewish music but rather to examine “the value of cross-cultural exchange.” That is done so well by showing the ties of Jewish music with that of so many nations around the world. A very brief but concise introduction is also offered for some of the acts whose work is part of that overall body. It is a start for any listeners who otherwise might not have known who any of them were, coming into the record. As part of those introductions, the liner notes also point out the influences in the arrangements, adding a little bit more depth to the presentation. The end result of that information is a nice accent to the presentation that when paired with the collection’s primary content, makes for even more appeal among audiences. That is even considering the lack of English translations for the songs anywhere in the booklet.\n\nThe Rough Guide to Jewish Music is a presentation that is certain to appeal to a wide range of World Music fans. That is proven largely through its featured musical arrangements. The arrangements take traditional Jewish sounds and styles and blends them with influences from the music and culture of so many other nations and their peoples. While the record’s musical content does so much to make the collection engaging and entertaining, the lack of any English lyrical translations for the songs does notably detract from the presentation. It is not enough to make the record a failure, though, but definitely is still problematic. Moving back to the positive, the record’s liner notes work with the musical content here to make for more engagement. That is because of the brief but concise background that the notes offer for the acts whose music is featured throughout. Each item examined is important in its own way to the whole of the compilation’s presentation. All things considered they make the record another interesting and mostly enjoyable offering from World Music Network.\n\nThe Rough Guide to Jewish Music is available now.

From the roots of American music to the music of Europe’s various nations and those of Asia. That ongoing worldwide musical trip continues Friday as the label takes audiences to China’s Yunnan province in The Rough Guide to The Music of Yunnan. The 19-song record is yet another interesting addition to the company’s ongoing The Rough Guide To… compilation series that will appeal not only to ethnomusicologists but to anyone who has any interest in the music and cultures of the region (and of other nations in general). That is due in no small part to its featured songs, which will be examined shortly. As much as the record’s primary content does to make it appealing, it is not perfect. The lack of English translations for the songs with lyrical content detracts notably from the record’s presentation. This will be discussed a little later. Even without those translations, the record’s companion booklet still adds to the listening experience through its featured liner notes. This will also be addressed later. Each item noted is important in its own way to the whole of the recording. All things considered they make the record yet another interesting addition to this year’s field of new World Music offerings.\n\nThe Rough Guide to The Music of Yunnan is yet another interesting addition to World Music Network’s ongoing The Rough Guide To… compilation series that will appeal to a wide range of audiences. The record’s appeal comes in part through its featured musical arrangements. From beginning to end, the songs featured in this song offer audiences touches of traditional music from China’s Yunnan province and some modern compositions. Audiences get a dose of that traditional music right from the compilation’s outset in the form of ‘Bi Lang Dao Gu Diao.’ According to the liner notes, the song is an ancient traditional song that is played on what is known as a Dai gourd pipe. A Dai gourd pipe is a type of flute that is in fact made in part with a gourd. It is played like a flute, believe it or not. The richness of the sound is so haunting, but in such a beautiful, immersive fashion. The song is a fully instrumental composition that paints such a rich picture of the Yunnan province in listeners’ minds as they take in the tones of the flute. One of the more unique of the record’s modern songs comes less than halfway through its run in the form of ‘Bulang Beauty.’ This song features a musical arrangement that pairs the traditional sounds of the Yunnan province with, of all things, reggae leanings. Yes, it combines two genres that are clearly very distinct from one another, yet somehow this blending of East and West really makes the song work. Sadly, there is no English translation of the song’s lyrical content in the record’s booklet, so audiences are left to assume just from the mood set in the composition and from the title what the song may be about. One more notable traditional composition featured here comes a little more than halfway through its run in the simple ‘Four Seasons of the Lahu.’ The song is such a simple and beautiful work that features its performer, Shi Lei, singing the simple presentation completely by himself. There is no instrumentation. Lei’s breath control and his dynamic control as he sings gives the song so much emotional depth. Even sans any English translations, the presentation is still so immersive. When it is considered along with the other arrangements examined here and with the rest of the record’s featured works, the whole makes the record’s overall musical content fully appealing.\n\nWhile the musical content that makes up this compilation’s body is fully immersive and appealing, the lack of any English translations for the record’s content detracts notably from the presentation. Considering that this record is being marketed largely to English-speaking audiences as a way to introduce said listeners to music from Asia, having any English translations would have been a very nice way to enhance the listening experience. That it is not part of the record’s presentation definitely hurts the presentation. The damage is not enough to doom the recording, but it certainly does not help that it is lacking here.\n\nEven though the lack of English translations for any of the songs with lyrics is a problem, the record’s liner notes still offer just enough to make the booklet its own positive. The liner notes point out how the Yunnan province has remained a mystery not just for ethnomusicologists but for anthropologists and other social scientists because of its geography and because of the Chinese government. In addition, the notes point out that many of the languages of the Yunnan province are not written down. That might account for the lack of lyrical content in the booklet. The notes even make mention of how the traditional sounds of the Yunnan province have been giving way to more modern sounds that themselves still pay homage to the traditional sounds of the region in their presentations. It is another interesting part of the whole of the background provided in the liner notes that when considered with everything else in the introduction, makes the liner notes just as important to this record as the set’s musical content. When the musical content and liner notes are considered together, they more than make this compilation another interesting addition to WMN’s ongoing The Rough Guide To… compilation series that will appeal to such a wide range of audiences.\n\nThe Rough Guide to The Music of Yunnan is a unique addition to World Music Network’s ongoing The Rough Guide To… compilation series that will appeal to a wide range of audiences. That includes not only those with an interest in music from around the world, but even those who study the various social and historical sciences. That is due in no small part to its featured musical content. The musical arrangements featured in this compilation offer audiences a glimpse into the past, present, and future of the Yunnan province’s musical community with a variety of traditional and more modern compositions. The liner notes that accompany that content develop quite the interesting background on the music that enhances the listening experience even more. The two elements together give audiences reason enough to hear this record. That is even considering the lack of any English translations for the songs anywhere in the record’s booklet. Each item examined here is important in its own way to the whole of the compilation’s presentation. All things considered they make this presentation yet another positive addition to this year’s field of new World Music offerings.\n\nThe Rough Guide to The Music of Yunnan is scheduled for release Friday through World Music Network.

Over the course of three decades, the singer (a.k.a. Lizzie Douglas) composed and recorded more than 200 songs, so many of which remains favorites among blues purists to this day. A new collection of those songs is scheduled for release Friday through World Music Network and in the form of the new compilation, The Rough Guide to Memphis Minnie – Queen of the Country Blues. The 25-song compilation is yet another enjoyable addition to WMN’s ongoing The Rough Guide To… compilation series. That is due in no small part to its featured songs, which will be discussed shortly. The songs’ audio works directly with the songs to make the listening experience all the more enjoyable. This will be discussed a little later. The record’s companion booklet rounds out the presentation’s most important elements and will also be examined later. Each item noted is important in its own way to the whole of the compilation. All things considered they make the collection not only a welcome addition to WMN’s The Rough Guide To… series, but also to this year’s field of new blues records.\n\nThe Rough Guide to Memphis Minnie – Queen of the Country Blues is another enjoyable entry in World Music Network’s ongoing The Rough Guide To… compilation series and a presentation that any blues fan will find appealing. The record’s appeal comes in part through its featured songs. The songs – 25 in all (It seems most WMN compilations are composed of 25 songs, as a side note) – pull from the early days of her career, that formative period when she was really starting to make a name for herself in a musician, composer and lyricist. More specifically, the songs pull from the early days of her career in 1929 all the way up to 1933. So while that is a limited time frame, the songs still serve as a clear snapshot (so to speak) of what made her so respected so early on. Right from the record’s opener, ‘Keep It To Yourself,’ the country influence in the blues is obvious. What’s more, the simplicity of the lyrics, which finds Douglas singing about keeping what you know to yourself, makes the song so accessible. She is singing about keeping certain secrets, not telling others, not so much keeping opinions to one’s self. Later in the record, a song, such as ‘What’s The Matter With The Mill’ does just as much to show the country music influence in her compositions, what with the steady, two chord approach. The blues element comes into play as she and fellow blues performer Kansas Joe sing about a corn mill being broken down. The blues is all about singing about life’s problems, and for this situation, the mill not working is keeping the pair from getting certain food. Again, it is such a simple theme but still there is some thing so accessible about it in that simplicity. Once again, it serves to show Douglas’ ability as a wordsmith just as much as a composer and musician. Her song, ‘Ain’t No Use Trying To Tell On Me (I Know Something On You)’ is another intriguing work. That is because its simple arrangement is so similar to Jesse Fuller’s timeless hit, ‘San Francisco Blues.’ Fuller’s song didn’t come along until 1954, while Douglas’ song debuted decades earlier in 1933. Now whether the similarity in the songs’ sounds and styles is coincidental is anyone’s guess. If Fuller took influence from Douglas however, it further shows the strength of her influence. It is just one more example of the importance of the collection’s musical content.\n\nThere is no denying that the musical content that makes up this compilation’s body. It is just one part of what makes the record appealing. The production of the songs is just as important as the songs themselves. The production is so much of note because of its role in their sound in their presentation here. As with so many collection’s of vintage music that World Music Network has released over the years, this collection’s songs are so wonderful in their sound. The static from the original recordings is just as evident here as in their original vinyl releases a century ago. Yes, with many of the songs featured here, a century has passed since they were originally released. It creates such a wonderful sense of nostalgia while once again showing that it is possible to have vintage vinyl recordings on CD and have them sound just as rich as they would on a new vinyl re-issue. Again, that is a tribute to the work that went into the record’s production. The general effect that results from that positive production builds on the appeal established through the songs to make for even more appeal, and in turn engagement and entertainment.\n\nThe overall presentation resulting from the collection’s content and production creates a strong general effect. It is just part of what makes the record appealing. The record’s companion booklet rounds out its most important elements. That is because of the background that it offers in its liner notes. The notes in question offer a brief biography of Douglas, as well as a note of the struggle that she faced during her career, as a woman in a male dominated career. This in itself is sure to generate plenty of discussion among audiences. The liner notes also make clear that the songs featured in the set are in fact from her formative years. The liner notes also point out her role in the popularity of country blues as a genre. It is just one more item that make the liner notes so interesting. When it and the other items pointed out here are considered along with the rest of the liner notes, the picture that they collectively paint enhances the listening experience that much more. Staying on that note, when the information provided in the record’s liner notes is considered alongside the record’s musical content and its production, the whole makes The Rough Guide to Memphis Minnie – Queen of the Country Blues yet another overall success from World Music Network.\n\nThe Rough Guide to Memphis Minnie – Queen of the Country Blues is another enjoyable, immersive compilation from World Music Network that is also another positive addition to World Music Network’s ongoing The Rough Guide To… series of releases. That is due in part to its featured musical content, as noted. The songs featured in this compilation are a presentation of the famed blues legend’s early days. It was that moment when she was just starting to make a name for herself. The production of those songs proves it is possible to transfer vinyl recordings to CD without any loss. The impact there further shows that all the people who think vinyl will one day replace CDs are clearly wrong. The record’s booklet adds even more to the listening experience. That is because of the history of Douglas that the liner notes therein provide. Each item examined is important in its own way to the whole of this collection. All things considered, they make the set another positive addition to WMN’s The Rough Guide To… series and one more of the year’s top new blues records.\n\nThe Rough Guide to Memphis Minnie – Queen of the Country Blues is scheduled for release Friday through World Music Network.

It starts as a slow boil in mid-late March and then really picks up in early April. In the movement that is the annual summer music push, it gets easy for so many records to get lost in the mix along the way. One record that will not get lost in the blues realm is World Music Network’s latest compilation record, The Rough Guide to Slide Guitar Blues. Released Friday, this 25-song record is yet another enjoyable addition to WMN’s ongoing The Rough Guide To… compilation series. Its success comes in no small part through its liner notes, which in this case really serve as the record’s foundation. They will be discussed shortly. The songs that make up the collection’s body work in direct partner with the liner notes and make for more engagement and entertainment. They will be discussed a little later. The record’s production puts the finishing touch to its presentation and will also be examined later. Each item noted is important in its own way to the whole of the collection. All things considered they make The Rough Guide to Slide Guitar Blues a presentation that any blues fan will enjoy.\n\nThe Rough Guide to Slide Guitar Blues, the latest release in World Music Network’s ongoing The Rough Guide To… compilation series, is a mostly successful new offering from the label. It is a welcome companion to so many of the various blues compilations that have come from the label ahead of its release. The collection’s success comes in part through its featured liner notes. The notes are important to note because of the foundation that they form for the record. From early on, audiences learn through the liner notes that while the blues is a distinctly American form of music, the use of a slide on a stringed instrument is in fact African at its roots. Many audiences will be surprised to learn not only this, but that the African instrument that essentially gave rise to slide guitar blues was a children’s instrument. The whole story there will be left for audiences to discover for themselves. This is just one of the interesting items presented in the liner notes. Audiences also learn through the liner notes that the use of a slide on a guitar, at least in the continental United States was first documented in 1903 by W.C. Handy while waiting for a train. Yet, even before that time, the use of a slide on a guitar had also been well-known in Hawaii (before it became a state) and was becoming even more popular in the continental United States. Yet again, this is an intriguing item that blues fans and music fans in general will find intriguing, and potentially even get them to do their own research into both genres’ histories. It is just one more example of the foundation that the liner notes form and is certainly not all that makes them interesting. The liner notes also point out the various kinds of slides used in the blues and the ways in which they were used, both in slower 12-bar blues and more upbeat music of the genre. This item plays directly into the songs that make up the record’s body.\n\nThe songs that compose the body of The Rough Guide to Slide Guitar Blues offer audiences slide guitar blues recorded by blues musicians from the Mississippi Delta, Texas and the East Coast. They are also up-tempo compositions and more reserved compositions. In other words, audiences get quite the variety of slide blues compositions throughout the course of the record’s 77-minute run time. The ability of the slide to sustain notes (going back to the liner notes) in slower songs is on wonderful display in Lemuel Turner’s ‘Way Down Yonder Blues.’ Easily one of Turner’s most well-known compositions, it is a full-on instrumental composition that features Turner playing his guitar by himself. Nothing else is there. The vibrato in so many of the song’s notes cuts through so clearly and really enriches the arrangement all the more. On a completely opposite note, there is the country blues style composition that is ‘Somebody Changed The Lock On My Door,’ from Casey Bill Weldon. In the case of this song, the notes are sustained in their own unique way as the contemplative composition progresses. What’s more, the arrangement itself shows just another blues subgenre and how slides are used to enhance the music therein. Kokomo Arnold’s ‘Feels So Good,’ which comes early in the set, is a prime example of more upbeat, energetic slide guitar blues. The use of the slide in a case, such as this shows how a slide is used in direct contrast to slower, more reserved blues songs. In slower blues compositions, the slide provides more of a vibrato, in almost a classical music style. In the case of a song like this, the slide shortens the notes and really changes the overall sound of the recording. It is just one more example of how the various compositions show so much variety in how slides are used in the blues. When it is considered with the other compositions examined here and with the rest of the record’s songs, the whole of that content builds on the collection’s foundation and makes the presentation all the more enjoyable.\n\nThe liner notes featured in The Rough Guide to Slide Guitar Blues and the songs that directly partner with them do much to make the record. They are just a part of what makes the set another enjoyable offering from WMN. The production that went into the record’s presentation rounds out its most important elements. The production is important because once again, what audiences get in this collection is another grouping of recordings that reaches back to the early 20th century. The sound of the static is still there, more so in some recordings than others, but it is there. At the same time, there is clearly no loss in any of the featured songs. What this means is that those responsible for the transfers clearly went to painstaking efforts once again to ensure the songs sounded just as good decades later as they did in their original presentations. The result is a wonderful general effect that puts the finishing touch to the record. When the expert production is considered along with the impact of the liner notes and the songs, the whole makes this presentation overall yet another successful addition to WMN’s ongoing series of Rough Guide To… releases.\n\nThe Rough Guide to Slide Guitar Blues, the latest addition to World Music Network’s ongoing series of Rough Guide To…compilations, is another positive offering from the company in that series. Its success comes in part through its liner notes. The notes are important because of the rich background that they offer on the history of slide guitar blues. The history that they provide is sure to educate and surprise plenty of audiences, and hopefully in turn, get those audiences interested in starting their own research into the genre. The music that accompanies the liner notes does well to take audiences even deeper into that history, as they hear exactly what the liner notes point out, in terms of stylistic differences in each style of slide guitar blues. The production that went into the compilation puts the finishing touch to the presentation. That is because it ensures the featured vintage presentations sound just as good in their new presentations as they did decades ago. Each item examined here is important in its own way to the whole of the presentation. All things considered, they make The Rough Guide to Slide Guitar Blues yet another enjoyable addition to WMN’s Rough Guide To… series of releases.\n\nThe Rough Guide to Slide Guitar Blues is available now through World Music Network and Riverboat Records.

The nine-song record is an interesting start for the artist, who currently calls Switzerland his home following his exile from his former home nation of Algeria some years ago. The 43-minute, mostly instrumental presentation proves itself worth hearing thanks to its diverse musical arrangements. They are diverse not only in their sounds and styles, but also in their combination of cultural influences, which end up directly influencing their sounds and styles. One of the most notable of the record’s songs comes early in its run in the form of ‘Savage Butterly.’ It will be discussed shortly. ‘Sirocco,’ which comes a little later in the album’s run, is another way in which the arrangements’ diversity shines through. It will be discussed a little later. ‘A True Lie,’ one of the record’s later entries, is also of note. It will also be discussed later. When it is considered along with the other songs noted here and with the rest of the album’s songs, the whole makes the album overall a successful offering from Cherif.\n\nDjawla, the debut album from international artist Anouar Kaddour Cherif, makes for a positive start to this year’s field of new World Music albums. Its featured musical arrangements do well to make that clear. ‘Savage Butterfly,’ one of the album’s early entries, is one of the songs that makes that clear. Drummer Hannes Junker’s performance on this song is just one of its highlights. When he enters the arrangement, his performance comes across as quite similar to that of Terry Bozzio. That is evidenced through the tight, staccato nature of his phrasing. Cherif’s own performance on mandole alongside his own performance adds even more to that sense of songs from Bozzio’s Black Light Syndrome record, which also featured performances from Terry Bozzio and Steve Stevens. The progressive nature of the overall performance, and the control that each musician has in his own performance makes this song so unique and just one of the works that makes this record so enjoyable. Listening through the song after reading through the brief liner notes about the song, listeners can actually envision the tiny, gentle butterfly making its annual migratory voyage through everything, showing its wild nature (no pun intended) and determination to reach its goal. It is such an enjoyable presentation, and just one of the album’s most notable works. ‘Cirocco’ is another song that helps show what makes Cherif’s debut album worth hearing.\n\nWhile ‘Savage Butterfly’ boasts something of a progressive nature in its stylistic approach and sound, ‘Sirocco’ bears its own separate identity. Cherif’s Algerian roots are once again on full display here through his performance on the mnadole. At the same time, the introduction of Clement Meunier on clarinet alongside Junker’s performance on drums, gives the arrangement a clear jazz influence, too. The sense of swing that is displayed through the pair’s performance makes for its own uniquely engaging and entertaining presentation that also continues to show the diversity in the album’s lyrical themes. According to the liner notes featured with Djawla, the arrangement is meant to conjure thoughts of the warm Saharan winds that blow from Africa all the way up to his current home in Switzerland. The varying tempos and energies from each musician’s performance does so well to paint that rich picture. The frenetic energy exhibited in the song’s final minutes paints that picture of the hot, dry winds blowing from the continent while the slower, more relaxed moments lead to thoughts of the winds building. The whole musical story and the picture that it paints is fully immersive. Keeping all of this in mind, it makes clear why this song is yet another important part of Djawla’s whole. It is just one more of the songs that shows how much the album has to offer. ‘A True Lie’ is one more example of how much the album has to offer.\n\n‘A True Lie’ is described in Djawla’s linr notes as being about Cherif’s need to basically find something positive, something that would help him maintain at least some hope. The way in which the song’s mood turns from somewhat edgy to more positive as it progresses does just as well to help make that story clear. That edgy energy is accompanied by much of the music being played in a minor chord. However, as the song progresses that all changes. The arrangement turns somewhat funky for lack of better word, though the performance of bassist Antoine Brochot. His fellow musicians follow suit from that point to the end, presenting the hope that Cherif must have found through his journey. It will leave audiences feeling positive, just as Cherif must have felt. The whole styling and sound here is unlike those of the other examined songs and from the rest of the record’s entries. When each of the songs examined here and those other songs are considered together, the whole makes this record the year’s first great World Music offering and an equally enjoyable debut from Cherif.\n\nDjawla, the debut album from Anouar Kaddour Cherif, is a strong first outing for the international artist. Its success is shown from the record’s opening to its end. That is proven through all three of the songs examined here. When they are considered along with the rest of the album’s entries, the whole makes the record, again, the first great World Music offering of 2022 and an equally strong first outing for Cherif.\n\nDjawla is available now through World Music Network and Riverboat Records.
