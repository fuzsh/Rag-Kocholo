I really enjoy these but don't really know too much about that type of music, i.e. African folk, blues, guitar or whatever kind of music this is. Would also love some suggestions for African Jazz music (think Abdullah Ibrahim – I have 'Good News From Africa', 'Water from an Ancient Well', 'Yarona' and 'at Montreux')\n\nD'Gary - Music From Madagascar\n\nAli Farka Touré - Talking Timbuktu\n\nI've really enjoyed both volumes of Angola Soundtrack. They feature guitar players from 65-78 I think. Good stuff. Analog Africa is a great label to browse for this kind of music. They have a good amount of stuff in Bandcamp in red book format.\n\nMulatu Astatke from Ethiopia is pretty amazing. Well at least his New York, Addis, London album is. That is definitely in the Jazz realm.\n\nYou mentioned \"world\" music. If you're willing to go beyond Africa, Water Lily Acoustics offers some amazing Indian and fusion performances with top notch sound. The most famous album from them is A Meeting by the River by Ry Cooder and V.M. Bhatt. Both play slide guitars but from radically different cultures and music backgrounds. Bhatt also plays with Bela Fleck, Sun Ra, and others on other albums. All are amazing. My favorite albums from them include Saltanah (absolutely amazing oud work), Bourbon and Rosewater, and Indian Architexture. The last is straight up Indian classical but it is a sublime performance from Ali Akbar Khan. All of those are available in DSD from acoustic sounds transferred from the analog masters.\n\nLet it me know if you're interested in other types of world music or more Indian classical!"
