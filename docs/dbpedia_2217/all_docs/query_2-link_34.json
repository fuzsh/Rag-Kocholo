        "text": "60 More Classic Dance Hits Of The 70s (Connoisseur Collection 1991)\n\nThis three CD compilation was one of the first CD box sets I ever bought, thrilled to replace my 7″ and 12″ vinyl collection of many of these classic tracks. I continually regret my decision to chuck away the vinyl but this has been a purchase which I have played consistently over the years. I also bought its companion release, the inevitably titled 60 Classic Dance Hits in this new indestructible format – but it rotted. In the early days of CD there was a chemical reaction which occurred between the CD in its case and the paper inserts and it went a horribly browny-gold colour on both sides and became unplayable. This fate did not totally escape this collection but it has just gone the funny colour of the front of the discs which hasn’t, thankfully, effected its playability. There are, true, a number of tracks which I have on other CDs, but a number which I only have on this collection. I think twenty-eight years on the damage would have been done by now so I think I’m fairly safe.\n\nI think this is a little different from many dance/disco collections as it has a very British bias. The sleeve notes contain the UK chart positions (that saved me a bit of time) and a number of them were hits only in the UK and were by UK artists. There’s a fair share of the big American names with songs that we might expect to see on disco compilations but these were probably more evident on the earlier collection. Here, we dig a little deeper to include reggae, northern soul, slow dances as well as the more obviously disco tracks which do span the decade but with the greater majority coming from the mid/latter years. With these essential compilation CDs it is important to know what tracks can be found on them so here you will find them listed with their highest chart position (UK/US) if released as a single and links if I have more information on the artist elsewhere on the blog. I’ll pick out a handful of tracks to give a flavour of what makes these CDs essential.\n\nTrack Listings\n\nCD1\n\n1.Rock Your Baby – George McRae (1974) (UK#1, US#2) (also on “Rhythm Divine 2” and “Disco Classics”\n\n2. Disco Nights (Rock Freak) – G.Q (1979) (UK#42, US#12) (also on “Native New Yorker“)\n\n3. He’s The Greatest Dancer – Sister Sledge (1979) (UK#6,US#9)\n\n4. Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground) – The Jacksons (1979) (UK#4, US#7) (also on “Rhythm Divine 2“)\n\n5. Car Wash – Rose Royce (1976) (UK#9, US#1) (also on “Funk Soul Anthems” and “Rhythm Divine 2“)\n\n6. Whodunnit- Tavares (1977) (UK#5, US#22)\n\n7. You See The Trouble With Me – Barry White (1976) (UK#2)\n\n8. Is This A Love Thing – Raydio (1978) (UK#27)\n\n9. Boogie Nights- Heatwave (1977) (UK#2, US#2) (also on “Disco Classics“)\n\n10.Disco Inferno – Trammps (1977) (UK#16, US#11) (also on “Nights In Heaven“)\n\n11.Boogie Oogie Oogie – A Taste Of Honey (1978) (UK#3, US#1)(also on “Rhythm Divine 2“)\n\n12. You’re My Everything – Lee Garrett (1976) (UK#15)\n\n13. Yum Yum (Gimmee Some) – Fatback Band (1975) (UK#40)\n\nA delicious squelchy bassline on this highly likeable slab of street funk. The lyrics are absolute nonsense about liking ice cream and cornflakes yet the rhythm and feel of the track makes it cool and just a little startling when we heard it first back in 1975. The first of their 6 UK Top 40 hits they perhaps were never as hard-hitting as this again, softening the sound and upping the commercial feel on bigger hits such as “Do The Spanish Hustle” and “I Found Lovin'”. The Fatback Band always had potential for me to be a funk supergroup but were unable to find pop chart success in the US. They had quite a few fine moments and this is one of them.\n\n14. Blame It On The Boogie – Jacksons (1978) (UK#8) (also on “Disco Classics“)\n\n15. We Are Family – Sister Sledge (1979) (UK#8, US#2)\n\n16. Good Times – Chic (1979) (UK#5, US#1)\n\n17. Young Hearts Run Free – Candi Staton (1976) (UK#2, US#20)\n\nUp there amongst the greatest disco tracks of all time, this combines southern soul and subtle country and western influences (especially in the lyrics) with disco music and a sheer uplifting danceability which is nothing short of genius. Candi puts in a great vocal on this track which was produced for her by Dave Crawford who propelled her into the big time. It’s a great song of independence and empowerment. Lyrically, I always smile at the couplet “Encourage the babies every time they say/self-preservation is what’s really going on today“. Candi knows some very articulate babies! Not even “I Will Survive” deals with a toxic relationship, which was the source of this song, in such an uplifting way. Further collaborations between Candi and Crawford were equally positive but did not have the depth of this song and did tend to sound like “Young Hearts.” It has scored chart placings for Candi on the UK on two separate occasions in 1986 as a re-mix and most successfully in 1999 as a re-recording when it got to number 29 when Candi was hot again thanks to her participation on the club classic that will never fade away “You Got The Love”. In 2018 Candi released her 30th album, appropriately titled “Unstoppable”.\n\n18. Take That To The Bank- Shalamar (1978) (UK#20)\n\nA pair of dancers from the US TV show “Soul Train” put together by the producers after session singers of the same name scored first time off with a so-so Motown medley “Uptown Festival”. Jeffrey Daniel and Jody Hewitt joined forces with vocalist Gerald Brown on an extended financial metaphor of a song which despite their much greater success worldwide in the 80’s for me ranks alongside “A Night To Remember” as my favourite of theirs. There have been personnel changes over the years with Brown being replaced by Howard Hewitt in their golden period and Daniel and Hewitt still perform alongside Carolyn Griffey, daughter of the man instrumental in putting the group together in the first place. Co-written and produced by Leon Sylvers, it would have been a great track for his already established family act The Sylvers who had scored a US#1 in 1976 with their track “Boogie Fever”. Instead it became the second of 11 UK Top 40 hits for Shalamar.\n\n19. Galaxy Of Love –Crown Heights Affair (1978) (UK#24)\n\n20. Do What You Wanna Do – T. Connection (1977) (UK#11)\n\nThe biggest and best track from this group from the Bahamas who got big local success and moved to Miami and TK records to join the sunshine sounds of labelmates KC and George McCrae. This is a track which has improved with age and still sounds like a relevant piece of disco funk. This was the big hit of their debut album “Magic” and they recorded three more albums for the label before moving to Capitol in the early 80’s where unfortunately their commercial sales continued to dwindle.\n\nCD2\n\n1.Now That We’ve Found Love – Third World (1978) (UK#10)\n\n2. Can You Feel The Force – The Real Thing (1979) (UK#5) (also on “Disco Classics“)\n\n3. Disco Music (I Like It) – J.A.L.N Band (1976) (UK#21)\n\n4. Hi Tension – Hi Tension (1978) (UK#13)\n\nThe Brit-funk movement kicked into action in 1978 with this extremely likeable funky track which put lie to the perception that British soul and funk music was inferior. This North London band added a bit of a Caribbean feel to the mix with a hint of steel drums over an explosive ear-worm of a chant. The group at times consisted of Phil Fearon who would go on to have hits in the 80’s leading pop-soul combo Galaxy and Courtney Pine joined them on tour. Their one album was released on Island Records and I actually thought they were going to be huge. I bought this single and played just as much the ballad B-side “Girl I Betcha” which had an Earth Wind and Fire feel and was confirmation to me that there was talent in this group. Both their UK hits, this name-checking opener and the follow-up are included on this CD. Follow-up “The British Hustle” was a little late in cashing in with the original dance craze which gave hits for the standard, the Spanish and Latin variations but reinforced the Britishness of the enterprise and gave them a higher chart position reaching number 8. Both tracks were as good as one another and I think there was a considerable amount of untapped potential to this group which perhaps should have demanded a longer term investment from their record company.\n\n5. Dancing In The City – Marshall Hain (1978) (UK#3)\n\n6. Silly Games- Janet Kay (1979) (UK#2)\n\n7. Reggae For It Now – Bill Lovelady (1979) (UK#12)\n\n8. Uptown Top Ranking – Althea & Donna (1977) (UK#1)\n\n9. I Love To Love- Tina Charles (1976) (UK#1)\n\nWe knew Tina’s voice from the 5000 Volts hit “I’m On Fire” and from those cheapie Top Of The Pops cover versions where she was used as a session singer before making her big breakthrough with this Biddu composition and production. I thought Tina Charles was great in 1976, a worthy successor to the girl stars of the 60’s and when this topped the charts you’d have to go back to 1968 and Mary Hopkins’ “Those Were The Days” to find the previous British solo female chart-topper. Biddu had scored a chart-topper with Carl Douglas and the Kung-Fu craze and some hits with his own orchestra but with Tina he had his muse and began a couple of years of a run of hits which sold well worldwide but couldn’t crack the US. This was her biggest and best track, the slight gender shift of the man who only wanted to dance whilst the girl wanted to canoodle made it appealing and the song itself is so catchy and performed superbly. I’ve seen Tina perform this and her other hits a few times over the years reminding me of the girl in the floppy cap I always had a bit of a crush on when I saw her on “Top Of The Pops” in 1976.\n\n10. Queen Of Clubs – KC & Sunshine Band (1974) (UK#7)\n\nTheir five US pop number 1’s would have to wait to begin clocking up until the following year but we Brits lapped up this debut hit in 1974 and I could argue the case for this being their best ever track. Stabbing staccato brass gives it a real urgency, KC’s vocal is convincing and it also contains the (uncredited) magnificent falsetto of George McCrae hot on the heels of his own debut chart-topper. Maybe not as sunshiny as some of their biggest hits but this really helped establish the Miami sound. In the US they really were one of the big singles group in the second half of the decade, in the UK they had to wait until 1983 for their sole number 1 “Give It Up” which sounded lacklustre compared to their big 70’s hits.\n\n11. You Sexy Thing – Hot Chocolate (1975) (UK#2, US#3)\n\n12. Get Up And Boogie – Silver Convention (1976) (UK#7, US#2)\n\n13. It Only Takes A Minute – 100 Tons & A Feather (1976) (UK#9)\n\n14. British Hustle – Hi Tension (1978) (UK#8)\n\n15. Reach Out (I’ll Be There) – Gloria Gaynor (1975) (UK#14)\n\n16. Dance (Disco Heat) – Sylvester (1978) (UK#29, US#19)\n\n17. From New York To LA – Patsy Gallant (1977) (UK#6)\n\nAt one time nicknamed the “Canadian Disco Queen” Patsy is a one-hit wonder in the UK known really only for this delightful slab of very pop influenced disco. This always reminds me of a stand-up comedy act Pam Ann who is still going strong but who used to be a regular crowd puller in Brighton and London in the 1990’s. As might be guessed by her name Pam’s comedy was cabin crew based, she wears a stewardess’ uniform and mercilessly rips apart the many airport staff who flock to see her show. As a finale she would perform to this song in roller boots, which sounds odd, but was something I always found really quite affecting, actually, the hairs are sticking up on the back of my neck thinking about it. I always liked this song anyway but now every time I hear it I can’t get the vision of a trolley dolly in uniform twirling around the stage and dance floor of whatever venue she was performing in.\n\nFrom NY to LA. From Patsy to Pam Ann\n\n18. Love Really Hurts Without You – Billy Ocean (1976) (UK#2, US#22) (also on “Disco Classics“)\n\n19. Footsee – Wigan’s Chosen Few (1975) (UK#9)\n\n20. Reaching For The Best – The Exciters (1975) (UK#31)\n\nCD3\n\n1. Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel –Tavares (1976) (UK#4, US#15) (also on “Disco Classics” and “Rhythm Divine 2”\n\n2. Baby Don’t Change Your Mind – Gladys Knight & Pips (1977) (UK#4)\n\n3. Here I Go Again – Archie Bell & The Drells (1972) (UK#11)\n\n4.Givin’ Up Givin’ In – Three Degrees (1978) (UK#12) (also on “Native New Yorker“)\n\nAfter the first surge of success with the Philadelphia International label it would seem a bold move for the Three Degrees to change direction from that smooth Philly sound. The fact that they were always credited in the UK press of being a favourite of Prince Charles kept them in the headlines and a move to the European Ariola label saw them pairing up with Giorgio Moroder which relaunched the group and gave them another four UK Top 40 hits to add to the 7 from their first phase of their career. Their biggest hit “When Will I See You Again” was full of the warmth of Sheila Ferguson’s vocal but this feels chilly and even slightly tempestuous as Sheila unleashes the powerful blast of her vocal, sweetened not by Moroder’s icy production but by Valerie and Helen’s backing. The girls had gone uptempo before with their contribution of their US #1 with MFSB but with this disco track they had become once again relevant and contemporary.\n\n5. Win Place Or Show (She’s A Winner) – The Intruders (1974) (UK#14)\n\n6. Come On Over (To My Place) – The Drifters (1972) (UK#9)\n\n7. Girls – The Moments & Whatnauts (1975) (UK#3)\n\n8. Feel The Need In Me – Detroit Emeralds (1973) (UK#4)\n\n9. That’s The Way I Like It – KC & The Sunshine Band (1975) (UK#4, US#1) (also on “Rhythm Divine 2“)\n\n10. Funky Nassau- The Beginning Of The End (1971) (UK#31, US#15)\n\n11. Play That Funky Music – Wild Cherry (1976) (UK#7, US#1) (also on “Disco Classics“)\n\n12. Disco Stomp- Hamilton Bohannon (1975) (UK#6)\n\nThis is a track I have never seen on any other compilation. I even had a best of Hamilton Bohannon CD where it didn’t even feature, amazingly as this was his biggest UK hit. Bohannon is a noted percussionist and the drums feature heavily on this thuddingly funky track. Vocally he does little more than mention the places where everyone is doing the disco stomp but the whole thing feels hypnotic and certainly unlike anything that was in the charts at that time.\n\n13. I Love Music – O’ Jays (1976) (UK#13, US#5)\n\n14. If You’re Ready (Come Go With Me) – Staple Singers (1974) (UK#34, US#9)\n\n15. If You Don’t Know Me By Now – Harold Melvin & The Bluenotes (1972) (UK#9, US#3)\n\n16. I’ve Been Lonely So Long – Frederick Knight (1972) (UK#22, US#27)\n\n17. I Wanna Get Next To You – Rose Royce (1977) (UK#14, US#10)\n\nThose of you who still, after all these years, think that Rose Royce was a female artist rather than a group need to take a listen to this achingly beautiful ballad. Gwen Dickey, who had powered her way through tracks such as “Carwash”, “Wishing On A Star” and “Is It Love You’re After” is relegated to the background here as Kenny Copeland excels with an Eddie Kendricks inspired vocal. Producer Norman Whitfield, best known for his work with The Temptations, wrote this for a love scene in the movie “Carwash”. Lyrically, it touches on the same delusional male approach of “Just My Imagination” and it ranks among Rose Royce’s very best and one of Whitfield’s best compositions and productions.\n\n18. Best Of My Love – The Emotions (1977) (UK#4, US#1) (also on “Disco Classics and “Rhythm Divine 2“)\n\n19. This Will Be – Natalie Cole (1975) (UK#32, US#6)\n\nAn incredible debut single, this is sheer joy from the very first notes and introduced a vocalist who was exuberant and ready to make her mark from the off. I loved it from the very first time I heard it, not even knowing it was by the daughter of my Dad’s favourite singer whose work I knew very well. Comparisons were made to Aretha, but I actually never heard Aretha with this much verve and optimism. If it resembles anything it is Barbara Acklin’s “Love Makes A Woman” but this is so much more infectious. I bought the single and pretty much wore it out. I was given the debut album for Christmas and did much the same thing to that (weirdly I have never bought that album “Inseparable” on CD to replace that vinyl copy). The call and response ending gives it a real gospel feel with Natalie the lead singer doing battle with Natalie on background vocals but it is the song’s swinging love for life which always hits home. You could tell that hers was going to be a significant career, in no way at this stage following in her father’s footsteps but obviously having learned so much from him in terms of vocals, phrasing and a jazz sensibility which could all be put to use on this very contemporary debut.\n\n20. Right Back Where We Started From – Maxine Nightingale (1977) (UK#8, US# 2)\n\nRhythm Divine 2 (Dino 1991)\n\nI did own this CD compilation’s predecessor, the unsurprisingly named Rhythm Divine on vinyl. There were quite a lot of tracks squeezed on over four sides and that compression and the fact that it was in the latter days of vinyl when the industry wanted everyone to purchase CDs meant that the sound was a little flat compared to the original singles and it wasn’t an album I played too often. The follow-up I purchased on CD and because it was the second in the series the selections were less obvious, the sound was beefed up for the CD format and it became an album I played a lot. We are back again on the dance floor with tracks dating from 1968-84 with the emphasis on the funkier, more soulful side of disco. There are tracks which overlap with other of my Essential CDs compilation choices, eight of the 34 on show here spread out between Disco Classics, Funk Soul Anthems and Native New Yorker but there is plenty new here to provide a joyful couple of hours revisiting tracks from my youth. With these essential compilation CDs it is important to know what tracks can be found on them so here you will find them listed with their highest chart position (UK/US) if released as a single and links if I have more information on the artist elsewhere on the blog and once again I’ll pick out a handful of tracks to give a flavour of what makes these CDs essential.\n\nTrack Listings\n\nCD 1\n\n1.Dance To The Music – Sly & The Family Stone (1968) (UK#7, US#8) (also on “Disco Classics”)\n\n2. Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground) – The Jacksons (1979) (UK#4, US#7)\n\n3. That Lady – Isley Brothers (1973) (UK#14, US#6)\n\n4. Best Of My Love – Emotions (1977) (UK#4, US#1) (also on “Disco Classics)\n\n5. Backstabbers – The O’ Jays (1972) (UK#14, US#3)\n\nThis features one of the greatest introductions in soul music, a melodic swirling, menacing yet absolutely lovely example of the Philadelphia International house orchestra MFSB before the O’Jays make their entrance with their emphatic “what’re they saying”. This was the first hit for soul trio Eddie Levert, Walter Williams and William Powell and as far as I am concerned it was never bettered, a musical warning about those who will talk about you behind your back. This year Levert, Williams and Eric Nolan Grant released what they say will be their final recording entitled “The Last Word” which was a great way to round-up the group after 61 years together for the two originals and which felt like a tribute to the quality of the music of the past with enough of a contemporary feel to make it a relevant soul music release.\n\n6. Rock Your Baby – George McRae (1974) (UK#1, US#2) (also on “Disco Classics)\n\n7. That’s The Way I Like It – KC & The Sunshine Band (1975) (UK#4, US#1)\n\n8. Boogie Oogie Oogie – A Taste Of Honey (1978) (UK#3, US#1)\n\nI had a friend who worked in the record department of WH Smith and in those days they used to put out the Top 20 charts on a peg board using plastic letters. There were obviously a lot of “o’s” both in this song title and in the charts one week and she found that they had run out so had to put this up on the board as “Bogie Ogie Ogie” which she got her a telling off from the shop manager (bogie being an unacceptable word for WH Smith to have on display in the 70’s) but it is how I have always thought of this song since. A Taste Of Honey featured a unique double of female vocalists and guitarists Carlita Dorhan and bass player Janice Marie-Johnson. In 1978 it was still unusual to see female artists playing and performing which made A Taste Of Honey seem like the sound of the future and this first single release was a huge seller and gained the group a Grammy. Sadly, they struggled with follow-up material and the group dwindled down to a duo. In the UK they are officially one-hit wonders but Dorhan and Johnson managed three years later to get back into the US Top 3 with a ballad cover of the Kyu Sakamoto hit “Sukiyaki”. They will always be remembered for this hook laden, funky slab of disco which had the feel of Chic with the girls emulating the guitar-rich sound of Nile Rogers and Bernard Edwards.\n\n9. Car Wash – Rose Royce (1976) (UK#9, US#1) (also on “Funk Soul Anthems”)\n\n10. I Will Survive – Gloria Gaynor (1979) (UK#1, US#1)\n\n11. When Will I See You Again – Three Degrees (1974) (UK#1, US#2)\n\n12. Contact – Edwin Starr (1979) (UK#6)\n\nEx Motown artist Edwin Starr re-emerged in the late 70’s on the 20th Century label and scored a big European hit. His US hits had dried up not long after his chart-topping “War” in 1970 and within a couple of years he decided to relocate to the UK, where he would stay until his death in 2003. Amazingly, this did not cross over to the pop charts in any big way in his homeland despite topping Billboard’s US Disco chart. It’s a big, chunky production which suits the stridency of the great Starr’s vocals. His Motown hits were great but I have always loved this reinvention of his sound on this track.\n\n13. This Is It- Melba Moore (1976) (UK#9)\n\nSongwriter/producer Van McCoy’s work always really succeeded when there was a strong voice which could cut through the natural sweetness of his productions. There was no way his string laden orchestra could dominate Melba Moore (nor David Ruffin who he also worked with around the same time). Melba’s voice had the experience of both gospel and Broadway and fitted perfectly into this joyous number. Music was in Melba’s genes, her mother was R&B singer Bonnie Davis who had topped the R&B charts and her father sax player and band leader Teddy Hill. The always critically acclaimed Moore has never had a pop hit in the US. In the UK chart success continued in the early 80’s when she scored another couple of Top 40 hits “Love’s Coming At Ya” (#15 in 1982) and “Mind Up Tonight” (#22 in 1983) and became one of the leading lights in the “Quiet Storm” soul ballad revival in the early/mid 80’s which saw a duet with Freddie Jackson top the R&B charts. Melba is still going strong today but there is no doubting this is her finest moment. Dannii Minogue’s 1993 revival of the track introduced the joyfulness of this to a new generation and saw the song back in the UK Top 10.\n\n14. More More More – Andrea True Connection (1976) (UK#5, US# 4)\n\nBy the mid 70’s in the US porn had gone mainstream and its stars, especially Linda Lovelace had become household names. The overlap between sex and disco which found success in tracks such as Donna Summer’s “Love To Love You Baby” tempted some adult movie actresses into the recording studio. The most successful of these was Andrea True. The story goes that Andrea found herself in Jamaica after an attempted coup which meant that money could not be taken out of the country. True had to spend her earnings and decided to fly in producer Gregg Diamond to make a record with her. Remixed by Tom Moulton and sporting an unforgettable “pop pop” sound “More More More” became a huge hit worldwide. It’s lyrics “keep the action going/keep the cameras rolling” reference her alternative career in a way which would not cause offence and would see the song covered successfully in later years by Rachel Stevens (#3 2004) and Bananarama (#24 1993). Andrea True was not a great singer but she did have some great songs in the early years of her career and is very under-rated as a music artist. I love the almost relentless latin flavours of “NY, You Got Me Dancing” and the disco pick-up of “What’s Your Name What’s Your Number” which gave her a second UK Top 40 hit two years later. Also tracks such as “Keep It Up Longer” and “Party Line” are certainly worth seeking out. Of her former film career I know nothing!\n\n15. Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel – Tavares (1976) (UK#4, US#15) (also on “Disco Classics)\n\n16. Rock The Boat – Hues Corporation (1974) (UK#6, US#1) (also on “Native New Yorker”)\n\n17. Hang On In There Baby – Johnny Bristol (1974) (UK# 3, US#8)\n\nHere’s a man who should have become a household name. A Motown songwriter and producer (often with Harvey Fuqua) Bristol worked on all time classic tracks by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, Edwin Starr, David Ruffin and Jnr Walker and the All Stars and as a vocalist is the male voice featured on Diana Ross and The Supremes’ swansong “Someday We’ll Be Together” which he also produced and co-wrote. By 1974 he had signed a solo contract with MGM and the success of bedroom based songs by male R&B stars such as Marvin Gaye and Barry White led to this recording which combines some fairly cheesy lyrics which turns love-making into a life or death situation with thunder roaring and lightning striking as Bristol gets it on with his “sweet virgin of the world” with a great production and a real hook laden song which is just irresistible. UK cool boys Curiosity Killed The Cat dropped most of their name for a comeback single in 1992 (as “Curiosity”) and matched their highest ever chart placing (as well as the UK chart position of Bristol’s original) with a cover of this. Bristol, maybe because of difficulties at the MGM label struggled to get his follow-up compositions to chart, although one of these “Love Me For A Reason” became a UK#1 when covered by The Osmonds. There were glimmers of potential success, a duet with Amii Stewart in 1980, a stint working with Ian Levine in the UK in the late 80’s but he just couldn’t follow up his classic hit. He passed away in 2004.\n\n18. Right Back Where We Started From – Maxine Nightingale (1975) (UK#8, US#2)\n\nCD 2\n\n1.Celebration – Kool & The Gang (1980) (UK#7, US#1)\n\n2. Don’t Stop The Music – Yarborough & Peoples (1980) (UK#7, US#19)\n\nAlthough they sound like a firm of solicitors Texans Cavin Yarborough and Alisa Peoples were childhood sweethearts who signed with the Total Experience label and this was their debut hit which is both funky and wacky with speeded up voices for which they would often use puppets when performing “You don’t really want to stop! No!“. Maybe this shifted them into the novelty act category in their homeland where this was their only Top 40 hit. In the UK they had another three singles which made the Top 75 over the next 6 years, one of which (“Don’t Waste Your Time”) reached 48 in the US coming closest to giving them a follow-up hit in 1983. They eventually tied the knot in 1987 after which they set up their own music production company.\n\n3. Use It Up And Wear It Out – Odyssey (1980) (UK#1)\n\n4. Shame – Evelyn “Champagne” King (1978) (UK#39, US#9) (also on “Native New Yorker”)\n\n5. Don’t Take Away The Music – Tavares (1976) (UK#4, US#34)\n\nTwo of the very best Tavares track on these CDs. This was another Freddie Perren production which closed their most successful album “Sky High” which had also featured “Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel.” and “The Mighty Power Of Love”. This is their Tavares at their most singalong, which is no way a criticism, as anyone who has heard me belting this in the shower would be able to testify. Great track which matched the success of “Heaven” in the UK but which fell a bit short in their homeland.\n\n6. Swing Your Daddy – Jim Gilstrap (1975) (UK#4)\n\n7. Be Thankful For What You’ve Got – William De Vaughan (1974) (UK#31, US#4)\n\n8. Respect Yourself – The Staple Singers (1971) (US#12)\n\n9. And The Beat Goes On – The Whispers (1980) (UK#2, US#19)\n\n10. Love Town – Booker Newbury III (1983) (UK#6)\n\n11. Somebody Else’s Guy- Jocelyn Brown (1984) (UK#13) (also on “Funk Soul Anthems”)\n\n12. Change Of Heart – Change (1984) (UK#17)\n\n13. Burn Rubber On Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me) – The Gap Band (1980) (UK#22)\n\n14. You Gave Me Love – Crown Heights Affair (1980) (UK#10)\n\nA veteran group by the time they notched up this UK Top 10 hit Brooklyn based group Crown Heights Affair had been around since the late 60’s and were one of the early leading lights of Disco in the mid 70’s with tracks such as “Dreaming A Dream” and “Dancin'” lengthy workouts which became club classics without making the commercial breakthrough the band would have hoped for. This came in 1978 with their excellent space-flight track “Galaxy Of Love” (UK#24). Their 1980 commercial peak was with this track which was not as good but does have a very memorable driving vocal hook “do doo doo doo doo doo” which lifted them into the Top 10 for the only time in their career.\n\n15. The Message – Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five (1982) (UK#8)\n\nLook at the chart placings. This seminal slab of hip-hop which took the to this point recent phenomenon of rap music to a new level was not even a US hit. The US charts have been full of rappers for years and Grandmaster Flash is arguably the Grandaddy of them all. Up until this point rap music had the hint of novelty about it stemming from labelmates The Sugarhill Gang and “Rapper’s Delight” with its one-upmanship which sounded fresh but a little trivial but here in the charts and on the radio was as the title rightly termed a “Message”. What we were being told about here was injustice and prejudice and R&B music shifted from this point onwards things would never be the same again. It’s up there with my favourite hip-hop records joined near that pole position by a track a year later when Grandmaster Flash joined forces with Melle Mel for the anti-drug epic “White Lines” which got to number 7 and hung around the UK charts for almost a year, although the power of this track was diluted by a pointless 1995 cover by Duran Duran.\n\n16. I Found Lovin’ – The Fatback Band (1984) (UK#7)\n\nRhythm Divine 2 can currently be purchased on Amazon in the UK for £4.07 new and used from £1.54.\n\nWhat is the right thing to do when just as your biography is going to press the subject dies? Do you hold back publication and revise its contents? I think I would probably say yes to this. Do you carry on and publish anyway after all, knowing that not many readers will know when a book actually came out, that’s a possibility. What Nik A Ramli does in his first piece of biographical non-fiction is acknowledge the passing in an author’s note at the start of the book, use the dates of the life (1948-2012) prominently on the cover but does not change the main text one iota. I’m not sure whether that’s appropriate.\n\nThat decision leads to a slightly off taste as Ramli focuses on the legendary disco star’s past, present and future in later chapters such as “Still Going Strong: A New Departure” and “Into The Future” when he makes it clear elsewhere that he knows that there isn’t going to be any future.\n\nNow I, like Ramli, who is better known as a Malaysian Interior Designer who specialises in “laid back glamour” am a big Donna Summer fan. I have included four of her albums in my Essential CD listings. I feel that up to now she has not been served well by the printed word. I read an early 80’s unauthorised biography which said little and even “Ordinary Girl” her 2003 autobiography written with Marc Eliot was a disappointment which just skimmed the surface. There is room for a definitive examination of the life and career of one of the most successful female artists of all time whose record sales reputedly exceed 130 million. I’d always hoped that someone like J. Randy Taraborrelli would apply his thorough, analytical eye to her and produce something very entertaining but this hasn’t happened.\n\nRamli has produced what is very much a fan’s viewpoint which borders on hagiography. I have no problems with that, the whole work comes across as a labour of love and I always admire these. He’s done tons of research and seemingly watched and read everything and has carried out interviews with people qualified to comment on Donna’s career including DJ Paul Gambaccini, fellow disco-diva Gloria Gaynor and her one-time producer and great supporter Pete Waterman. Unfortunately, what he hasn’t done is put this research all together very well. This is a first-time writer in need of support to structure a convincing narrative and that support (and editing) obviously wasn’t there. The style is breathless throughout, which becomes a little overwhelming, there is so much repetition, an over-reliance on listing the same statistics and song titles to illustrate laboured points, a cheesy use of song titles within the text of the she certainly “works hard for the money” type, factual errors even I’ve spotted, non-sequiturs a-plenty and a tendency to go off on odd tangents, but mainly it’s the repetition that wearies.\n\nHe rattles through her whole career in the first few chapters and with a considerable amount of the book to go a clearer structure would have helped matters. He’s read Taraborrelli’s superior music biogs according to the bibliography, it is disappointing that from these he didn’t get a clearer idea of how to put together his work.\n\nWhat Ramili does well, however, is to get a global perspective. He’s more obsessed about listing chart positions than I am, we get to know how Donna Summer’s work performed in many markets together with listings of weeks spent in both US and UK charts. I also like how he has got contributions from Malaysian performers about the influence of this American girl from Boston who found fame initially in Germany.\n\nThe issue that affected the performer was how much “Donna Summer” was a creation of her producers and then her record label. She was created to fit in with the hedonism of mid 70’s disco, with an aura of soft-porn chic which captured the zeitgeist of the time. This image was different to how Donna Summer wanted to be seen both in terms of her beliefs and her need not to be pigeonholed as an act of a moment. Her disco days were glorious with some superb tracks, brilliantly performed, but she wanted to see and she had the talent to see beyond that, sensing that disco might not last forever. When it did end in the US with that notorious record burning in a Chicago sportsfield which I’ve mentioned a number of times before (see “Turn The Beat Around” by Peter Shapiro), Donna was ready to move on and embrace rock, new wave and more mainstream pop. Over time chart positions dwindled and an alleged comment about AIDS alienated a large gay fanbase. That disco ball would never entirely go away, however, and the demand for the back catalogue of the Disco Donna Summer, like the Disco Gloria Gaynor, would keep re-appearing over the decades. In latter years Donna began once again to fully embrace this and saw a career revival and a demand for new material in the years up to her sudden and shocking death from lung cancer aged 64.\n\nShe should be seen as one of the greatest performers of her era, alongside Barbra Streisand (with whom she famously vocally duelled with on “No More Tears”), Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner and Diana Ross. The fact that she does not always share a pedestal with these artists critically means she is still due for reappraisal. Ramli’s work provided a welcome opportunity for this but he doesn’t quite pull it off.\n\nDonna Summer; The Thrill Goes On was published by Book Guild Publishing in 2012.\n\nNative New Yorker: Disco Classics (Camden 1997)\n\nThis twenty track CD appeared on the budget Camden label in 1997 and according to the sleeve notes written by one Michael Dunnington references a time “when Jason King ruled the TV air-waves and men’s trousers “flared” like no tomorrow.” For a one disc collection of 70’s music it is spot on and there is no overlap with any of the tracks featured on the other compilation CDs I have so far considered to be essential. What it isn’t really, despite its subtitle, is an album of “disco classics” unless we are counting a school disco where tracks by artists such as Sweet and Barry Blue would have got played. That disco would have also had to have a closing “slow dance” section to incorporate ballad tracks from the Delfonics and the country-tinged soul of the Pointer Sisters doing Bruce Springsteen, but okay, I’ll let it go because this is a CD which gets the memories flowing and brings me a lot of pleasure. True, some of that pleasure might be guilty as the majority of the tracks are from the more poppy side of dance than those that appear on the “Disco Classics”, “Chilled Disco” and “Funk Soul Anthems” sets with its mix of American tracks, Eurodisco and British pop soul. There are three UK number 1s and 1 US chart-topper and 13 out of the 20 tracks performed better in the UK and Europe than they did in the USA.\n\nWith these essential compilation CDs it is important to know what tracks can be found on them so here you will find them listed with their highest chart position (UK/US) if released as a single and links if I have more information on the artist elsewhere on the blog. I’ll pick out a handful of tracks to give a flavour of what makes these CDs essential.\n\nTrack Listings\n\nCD 1\n\n1.Native New Yorker – Odyssey (1977) (UK#5, US#21)\n\nWhat a track to open with, important enough to give the whole compilation its name and one of my all time favourites. Odyssey’s later UK chart-topper featured on “Funk Soul Anthems” but this is their debut hit which was their only success in the US. It’s a beautifully performed song by the Lopez sisters with Tony Reynolds which drips with sophistication and a classy glamour which makes it stand out as a song compared to so much repetitive disco. It sounds like something from the Great American Songbook (it for me is reminiscent of the Rodgers and Hart song “Manhattan” as made famous by Ella Fitzgerald). The writers of this 70’s gem are Sandy Linzer and Denny Randall who wrote it as a track for a Frankie Valli solo album. These two had been responsible for some classy pop songs prior to this such as “A Lover’s Concerto”, “Opus 17” and “Working My Way Back To You” for the Four Seasons . Linzer has made a previous significant appearance on my Essential CD listings for his production work on the innovative first album from “Dr Buzzard’s Original Savannah Band” one of the great disco albums of all time. Esther Phillips also did a great version of this song but this is definitely the definitive version.\n\n2. Yes Sir I Can Boogie – Baccara (1977) (UK#1)\n\nThe ultimate guilty pleasure? This surprise UK chart-topper still delights me every time I hear it. I’m not sure whether it’s the Eurodisco production with its out-of-place heavy-breathing intro giving it a touch of the Donna Summers, the English as a second language phrasing, the “boogie-voogie” or the song which turns back in on itself and contains lines such as “I already told you in the first verse/ and in the chorus”. Spanish female duo Baccara were certainly one of a kind. I saw them perform at “G-A-Y” in the 1990s and they still had the audience eating out of the palm of their hands by swirling scarves as they eased through their repertoire which also contained their equally bizarrely lyrics of “Sorry I’m A Lady” and their 1978 Eurovision entry “Parlez Vous Francais (strangely enough representing Luxembourg) where they were robbed finishing in a lowly 7th place losing to Israel’s nonsensical “A-Ba-Ni-Bi” which lyrically made the Baccara song seem more like Bacharach. Sophie Ellis-Bextor had a go at making this song her own but that just isn’t possible it just has to be Mayte Mateos and Maria Mendiola in their quizzical Spanglish.\n\n.\n\n3. Disco Nights (Rock Freak) – G.Q (1979) (UK#42, US#12)\n\n4. Ms. Grace – Tymes (1974) (UK#1)\n\n5. Shame – Evelyn “Champagne” King (1978) (UK#39, US#9)\n\n6. Just Don’t Want To Be Lonely – The Main Ingredient (1974) (UK#27, US#10)\n\n7. Sunny- Boney M (1977) (UK#3)\n\nEuro-disco’s biggest stars actually heralded from the West Indies but with this their second UK hit cemented their association with Germany’s Frank Farian on what is head and shoulders their best track. The song is a cover version of a 1966 hit by Bobby Hebb, having much of its warmth stripped out to produce an almost icy slab of Munich disco-funk. It’s a near-perfect reconstruction of a song. That said, I’m not sure what we are listening to here because the vocal arrangement sounds a tad different from my old 7 inch single. I’m wondering whether it is a different mix or the album version. I’m pretty sure its not a re-recording (a peril of the budget CD) as I’m sure this would have been highlighted in the info. It’s in no way bad, just ever so slightly different and if I hadn’t listened to this song so many times over the years I probably would never have noticed. What I have noticed also, however, is that this song is given the wrong title on the inner sleeve of the CD. Doesn’t anybody proof read these things before they are printed?\n\n8. I Can’t Stand The Rain – Eruption (1978) (UK#5)\n\n9. Jack And Jill – Raydio (1978) (UK#11, US#8)\n\nThe late 70’s group Raydio could not for long contain Ray Parker Jnr who for a time in the next decade looked like he could be one of the biggest solo acts. A gifted guitarist, vocalist, song writer and producer with a great pop sensibility, Parker’s career was both made by his theme song to the movie “Ghostbusters” and hampered by it, as the spectre of the term “novelty artist” hung over him. He was no novelty he just had an excellent sense of what was commercial. This was evident on his debut hit which is one of two nursery themed tunes on this album, but this tale of the couple who went up the hill is nowhere as twee as the Moments’ “Jack In The Box” which appears later. In fact, nursery rhyme referencing was not as out of place as it may seem in 70’s R&B, think The Gap Band’s “Oops Upside Your Head” and even Earth Wind and Fire did it on “Saturday Night” . This is a good piece of pop-flavoured mid-tempo funk made memorable by the echoing vocals of the names of the two main characters. I’ve always had a soft spot for both this and their UK hit follow-up “Is This A Love Thing?” Back in 1978 I won a copy of “Jack And Jill” in a competition in “Blues And Soul” magazine which for someone who relied on saving up pocket money for music purchases was quite a big thing!\n\n10. Givin’ Up Givin’ In – Three Degrees (1978) (UK#12)\n\n11. Rock The Boat – Hues Corporation (1974) (UK#6, US#1)\n\n12. La La Means I Love You – Delfonics (1971) (UK#19, US#4)\n\n13. There Goes My First Love – Drifters (1973) (UK#3)\n\n14. Blockbuster – Sweet (1973) (UK#1)\n\n15. It’s In His Kiss – Linda Lewis (1975) (UK#6)\n\nI can’t miss an opportunity to herald this singer, not until she is recognised as one of the great British female artists. A singer who may have been too versatile for her own good is here on her biggest hit which like its follow-up “Baby I’m Yours” which I highlighted on the “After The Dance” CD is a cover version of 60’s girl pop. (I was young enough not to know this when this first came out). Here the pace is ramped up to fever pitch and it sounds like Linda has had a blast of helium before letting rip into this song which is just brilliant in giving the innocence of girl-group pop a 70’s glam makeover. Notes are hit that zoom off into the stratosphere. If you want to hear a vocalist putting 100% into a recording this is a prime example . It certainly, for me, puts Cher’s 1991 chart-topping version into the shade. It’s not even Lewis’ best recording. That would be a stunning version of a song based on Gilbert and Sullivan’s “The Sun Whose Rays Are All Ablaze” from “The Mikado”, “The Moon and I” which I love so much I had it played at my wedding ensuring there would not be a dry eye in the house!\n\n16. Fire – Pointer Sisters (1979) (UK#34, US#2)\n\n17. Can’t Get By Without You – The Real Thing (1976) (UK#2)\n\n18. Dancing On A Saturday Night – Barry Blue (1973) (UK#2)\n\n19. Jack In The Box – The Moments (1977) (UK#7)\n\n20. Get Dancin’ – Disco Tex & The Sex-O-Lettes (1974) (UK#8, US#10)\n\nNative New Yorker: Disco Classics is currently available to buy from Amazon in the UK for £14.98 and used from £0.90.\n\nAfter The Dance (Telstar 1991)\n\nThis 32 track double CD which came out on the TV promoted Telstar label in 1991 puts together a collection of some of the best sweet soul tunes from the 70’s and 80’s. It is a sophisticated listen with quality performers and a good mixture of the well and lesser known, of hits and tracks that did not make it. There’s a smattering of Motown, Philadelphia International releases alongside Stax and Atlantic with the soul groups who were popular in the early 70’s alongside a few more mid-tempo offerings from artists associated with disco and a few R&B influenced tracks from the 80’s. The earliest dates from a slab of pure soul from Aretha in 1967 and spans to a debut minor 1987 hit for British soulster Paul Johnson of whom big things would have still been hoped for when this album was released in 1991. Once you get by the disturbing cover art there are a lot of gems to be found within.\n\nWith these essential CDs it is important to know what tracks can be found on them so here you will find them listed with their highest chart position (UK/US) if released as a single and links if I have more information on the artist elsewhere on the blog. I’ll pick out a handful of tracks to give a flavour of what makes these CDs essential.\n\nTrack Listings\n\nCD 1\n\n1.Me And Mrs Jones – Billy Paul (1972) (UK#12, US#1)\n\nWhat a gem of a track to kick things off with. A song about adultery written by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff with Cary Gilbert would not have seemed an obvious pick for a debut number 1 pop hit but Billy Paul’s superb, tender performance won over audiences worldwide and introduced us all to one of the most unique voices in soul music with his jazz style phrasing . Amazingly, Paul only scored one more US Pop Top 40 hit, the sublime uptempo “Thanks For Saving My Life”. Like most artists who relied on the songwriting talents of Gamble & Huff his material alternated between out and out romance of tracks such as “When Love Is New” and the mawkish “Let’s Make A Baby” and social commentary such as “Am I Black Enough For You?” and “Bring The Family Back”. He was also a great song-stylist as his versions of his trio of 1977 UK hits, in particular, Elton John’s “Your Song” (a UK#37 hit), but also Paul McCartney’s “Let Em In” (UK #26) and Jerry Butler’s “Only The Strong Survive” (UK#33) testify. But it is for tale of a secret rendezvous for which he will always be remembered. Billy Paul passed away in 2016 aged 81.\n\n2. Love Won’t Let Me Wait – Major Harris (1975) (UK#37, US#5)\n\nPerhaps one of the all-time tender love songs Major Harris, is here like much of Barry White’s output concentrating on the bedroom in this soft-porn epic with heavy breathing which would have denied it much daytime radio play and might explain its lowly UK chart placing. The Major had a member of the Delfonics in the early 70’s (but after the hit for the group which appears on this CD) and Atlantic Records had high hopes of him becoming a major solo star but this was his only US chart placing. He continued to record on various labels until the mid 90’s with only his 1983 London label release “All My Life” attracting any attention in the UK. Once again this great performance is what he is remembered for.\n\n3. I’ll Be Good To You- Brothers Johnson (1976) (US#3)\n\n4. Peek-A-Boo- The Stylistics (1973) (UK#35)\n\n5.Didn’t I Blow Your Mind (This Time) – The Delfonics (1970) (UK#22, US#10)\n\n6. Homely Girl – The Chi-Lites (1974) (UK#5)\n\n7. You Are My Starship – Norman Connors ft Michael Henderson (1976) (US#27)\n\n8. Games People Play – Detroit Spinners (1975) (US#5)\n\n9. Walk Away From Love – David Ruffin (1975) (UK#10, US#9)\n\nAnother of the great voices of soul music. Ruffin’s gravelly voice blistered its way through many Temptations hit and as a solo artist did not reach the heights expected of him, although this was at least in part to his own personal demons. For me, his greatest association was his mid 70’s teaming up with Van McCoy. This is where McCoy’s work was strongest, the albums he did with Ruffin, with Melba Moore and Faith, Hope & Charity had powerful gospel-drenched voices cutting through his Soul City Symphony lushness in a way that his work with the sweeter voiced Stylistics did not. This is one of Motown’s great 70’s singles and a welcome comeback for the man whose only US hit had been six years previous and who in the UK was overshadowed by brother Jimmy.\n\nThere was a lot of hat-wearing on 70’s R&B album covers!\n\n10. Loving You, Losing You – Phyllis Hyman (1977)\n\nAnd whilst we are talking about personal demons, the hugely under-rated Phyllis was plagued with them which led to her taking her own life in 1985. Album releases on Buddah, Arista and Philadelphia showed huge potential but she may have been too sophisticated for the commercial masses. There were business disappointments throughout her career, a James Bond theme recording never made it on to the film, collaborations with artists ranging from Barry Manilow, The Four Tops and Michael Henderson (whose “You Are My Starship” also appears here) did not pay the dividends expected and a dependency on cocaine sealed an inevitable and tragic early demise. It’s inexplicable how this club classic from her debut album failed to make chart headway in 1977. It opens with an epic sweep, a great introduction before Phyllis performs beautifully on this Thom Bell song.\n\n11. Risin’ To The Top – Keni Burke (1982)\n\n12. Love Me – Diana Ross (1974) (UK#38) (also on Motown Chartbusters Volume 9)\n\n13.Still Water (Love) – Four Tops (1970) (UK#10, US#11)\n\n14. I’ll Be There – Jackson 5 (1970) (UK#4, US#1)\n\n15. Winter Melody – Donna Summer (1976) (UK#27)\n\nThe first indication that Donna Summer would survive the disco boom was this under-stated ballad track from her themed “Four Seasons Of Love” which surprisingly became a hit in the UK over Christmas 1976. It’s ethereal, whispy Donna and it is always a joy to hear. Because of it’s non-success in her homeland it often does not appear on Summer compilations, for example, its not on the essential “Anthology” release nor on “Hit Singles & More” nor “I Feel Love: The Collection” but can be found here as well us on the three CD “Ultimate Collection”. It’s a lovely track which shows a different side of Donna.\n\n16. Natural High- Bloodstone (1973) (UK#40, US#10)\n\nCD 2\n\n1.Rolling Down A Mountainside – The Main Ingredient (1975)\n\n2.Freedom For The Stallion – The Hues Corporation (1974)\n\n3. Shake You Down – Gregory Abbott (1986) (UK#6, US#1)\n\nWhat on earth happened here? The title track from Abbott’s debut self-written and self-produced album leapt to the top of the US charts and was a big hit worldwide introducing us all to a classy, slick piece of mid-tempo sing-along soul. Record label Columbia must have thought they had the next big thing on their hands. A gifted good-looking all-rounder the album went platinum and then… well, nothing to bother chart compilers although he has continued to record to the present day. It’s one of those weird occasions when the world fell in love with a performer and then fell out of love just as quickly with this highly talented singer becoming one of the ultimate one-hit-wonders on both side of the Atlantic. Obviously, the real strength here must be the song, which Abbott wrote, and it still sounds good.\n\n4. You Can’t Change That – Ray Parker Jnr (1979)\n\n5. Let Me Make Love To You – The O’Jays (1975)\n\n6. When Love Comes Calling – Paul Johnson (1987) (UK#52)\n\n7. Private Number – William Bell & Judy Clay (1968) (UK#8)\n\n8. I Surrender -Heatwave (1990)\n\n9. Could It Be I’m Falling In Love – Detroit Spinners (1973) (UK#11, US#4)\n\nOr the Spinners as they are known in their homeland but here we need something to differentiate them from the folk group of the same name. Whilst at Motown they were known as The Motown Spinners and recorded some great tracks but it was after the move to Atlantic where they really came into their own. There are two of their very best tracks included on these CDs and this is one of their best known although I’ve always been a big fan of the slightly less slick “Games People Play” which was not a UK hit but a Top 5 hit stateside. The magic kicked in when they began working with songwriter Thom Bell and vocalist Phillippe Wynn joined the group. Lead vocals were shared between three members which gave them longevity and yet meant their sound was not as instantly recognisable as some of the R&B groups of the time. They had two chart-topping singles, in the US it was with a duet with Dionne Warwick in 1974 but they had to wait until 1980 to do it in the UK with their medley of “Working My Way Back To You” and “Forgive Me Girl” which sounded a little pedestrian compared to some of the great tracks that came before.\n\n10. I’m Doing Fine Now – New York City (1973) (UK#20, US#17)\n\n11. (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman – Aretha Franklin (1967) (US#8)\n\n12. Free- Deniece Williams (1977) (UK#1, US#25)\n\nWith hindsight there wasn’t a more influential American R&B group in the 1970’s than Earth, Wind & Fire but the only UK number 1 single they were involved with came not from themselves, despite so many classic tracks, nor with The Emotions, who had one of the 70’s biggest hits in the US with “Best Of My Love” but with this subtle, sophisticated performance from Deniece Williams who had moved from working with Stevie Wonder as one of his backing singers to a debut album produced by Maurice White and Charles Stepney. This track doesn’t even feel that commercial even compared to some of the other songs on the album and feels more like a vocal performance highlighting her incredible range than a song yet it topped the charts and Deniece Williams became a much-loved artist in the UK. Amazingly, Deniece became the first black American female solo singer to top the UK charts since Diana Ross in 1971. Post the EWF connection she scored two US chart-toppers which were also Top 3 hits in the UK, helping Johnny Mathis to a resounding comeback with the too warbly “Too Much Too Little Too Late” and the crowning glory of the “Footloose” soundtrack “Let’s Hear It For The Boy”, but this is where it all started for her.\n\n13. Honey Please, Can’t Ya See – Barry White (1975)\n\n14. Superstar/ Until You Come Back To Me – Luther Vandross (1983)\n\n15. Baby I’m Yours – Linda Lewis (1976) (UK#33)\n\nAnother huge vocal range and a greatly under-rated performer who should be treated as a British National Treasure. Too versatile to fit into the constraints of a 1970’s pop career Lewis touched on rock, folk, show tunes, operatics and soul music and was a highly regarded songwriter. Here she is in disco mode which had earlier in 1976 seen her score one of her biggest UK hits with her phenomenal version of “It’s In His Kiss” where her vocals swooped and soared over a huge production. Here she covers a Van McCoy penned song first recorded by an inspiration of hers, 60’s US soul singer Barbara Lewis from whom she took her surname. (Linda’s real name is Fredericks yet even her sisters Shirley and Dee record under the Lewis name). Once again it’s first class, yet did not get the chart position it deserved. Everything is thrown into what is perhaps even a bigger production than its predecessor and even if some felt Linda was selling out in conforming to the demands of the commercial market she certainly gives it 100%.\n\n16. I Want Your Love – Chic (1979) (UK#4, US#7)\n\nA great way to finish this CD is perhaps the classiest thing Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards ever did with Chic. Best known for more out-there disco tracks everything is reined in a little here with a great build, superb orchestration and that familiar scratchy Chic sound. Nile of course, is still very much influencing the music business, a favourite at festivals and it is because of tracks like this that his music has transcended the decades.\n\nAfter The Dance is currently available on Amazon in the UK for £4.97 and used for £0.62. I think I would be hard pushed to recommend a finer compilation of 70’s/80’s soul sounds.\n\nDisco Classics (Sony 2005)\n\nNow, you’ve seen what has come before so it can be no surprise that there is going to be more than a little smattering of disco compilations in my Essential CD List. The uplift I get from listening to disco music hasn’t dampened any since these tracks featured in the charts. I’ve gone here for a double CD 34 tracker which has a mixture of the obvious and expected to the more unusual which makes it a great choice as far as I am concerned. It’s a pretty broad collection featuring four UK and 6 US chart-toppers and chronologically spans from well before the disco era with 1968 uptempo funk by the pioneering Sly & The Family Stone to a Megamix of Earth Wind and Fire’s greatest which dated from 1989 and features a whistle-stop tour through “September”, “Let’s Groove”, “Rock That”, and a twice-featured “Boogie Wonderland” with as much conviction as a late 80’s megamix could have. Mid 80’s sophisticated uptempo groove “Midas Touch” is hardly disco but would work well in a club setting and The Buggles UK chart-topper is an odd way to round off the selection but there are enough tracks here that fulfil the brief very nicely and can be considered “disco classics”. This CD was released in Germany and has the look of a Hed Kandi compilation which would have been popular at the time. I have no idea how I acquired it but it has been played regularly since I did so. On Amazon some reviewers have attacked this for being “live re-recordings” but it’s not, it’s the original tracks.\n\nOnce again with these essential CDs it is important to know what tracks can be found on them so here you will find them listed with their highest chart position (UK/US) if released as a single and links if I have more information on the artist elsewhere on the blog. I’ll pick out a handful of tracks to give a flavour of what makes these CDs essential\n\nTrack Listings\n\nCD1\n\n1.No Doubt About It – Hot Chocolate (1980) (UK#2)\n\nThroughout the 70’s it seemed like the voice of Errol Brown was always on the radio notching up a string of UK hits. The RAK label they recorded on wasn’t the coolest around but was one of the most successful UK labels with Mud, Suzi Quatro, Kenny and Smokie all doing very well for label owner Mickie Most. As a result Hot Chocolate were seen as a more pop band than they actually were and perhaps were not always given the credit they deserved. 1975 hit “Emma” was an anguished soul track about a suicide, “You Sexy Thing” gave them a Top 3 hit on both sides of the Atlantic in 1975 at the midst of Disco Fever, but best of all is this 1980 track which became their 18th Top 40 hit in 1980 which dealt with UFOs and had a great singalong chorus.\n\n2. Let The Music Play – Barry White (1975) (UK#5, US#32)\n\n3. Rock Your Baby – George McCrae (1974) (UK#1, US#1)\n\nAnd this arguably, was where the Disco Era began during the summer of 1974 when debut hitmaker George McCrae topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. It’s rather sparse, almost minimalistic compared to what would come after but it introduced the shuffling Miami sound which would go on to feature in many more hits. McCrae himself, blessed with a thrilling falsetto only had one more US Top 40 hit but we rather took to him in the UK giving him another 6 Top 40 hits over the next couple of years, my favourite of which “It’s Been So Long” made it to number 4. George also featured his voice to great effect in 1974 in the debut hit “Queen Of Clubs” the first hit for label-mates KC & The Sunshine Band (who also features on this CD with their late in the day 1983 UK#1) who wrote and produce George’s chart-topper and who themselves would go on to have a more successful career than George. Now aged 74, George is still going strong and in good voice. And all this happened because his then wife, Gwen, who “Rock Your Baby” was written for was late for the recording session!\n\n4. Boogie Wonderland –Earth Wind & Fire with The Emotions (1979) (UK#4,US#6)\n\n5. Pick Up The Pieces – Average White Band (1975) (UK#6, US#1)\n\n6. Play That Funky Music – Wild Cherry (1976) (UK#7, US#1)\n\n7. Vertigo/Relight My Fire – Dan Hartman & Loleatta Holloway (1978)\n\nOne of the few tracks on the album that was not a hit although a cover version in 1993 topped the chart for Take That and Lulu. This is a real epic of a track presented here, thankfully, in its 9 minute version with it’s brilliant orchestral build-up “Vertigo” into Dan’s light voice singing “Relight My Fire” then bam! it’s only Loleatta Holloway tearing into the track. Nine minutes and not a second feels wasted (hard to say that about a lot of extended disco tracks). Dan is also on this compilation with his better known but not as good “Instant Replay”, which with his mammoth “Countdown/This Is It” represented three classic disco tracks. As a song-writer he penned one of James Browns’ biggest hits “Living In America” and for Loleatta, who features here, “Love Sensation” which became the blueprint for one of the biggest tracks of the 80s, “Ride On Time”.\n\n8.Last Train To London – Electric Light Orchestra (1979) (UK#8, US#39)\n\nThis is a track that I didn’t especially appreciate at the time. I did quite like ELO, especially “Mr Blue Sky” and “The Diary Of Horace Wimp” which seemed to be pointing back to the 1960’s. This, however, saw them embracing disco and at the time it felt a little like bandwagon-jumping. However, the passing of the decades has been very good to this and it sounds like the creative tour-de-force that it is. There’s a sense of urgency about this last train which is very appealing.\n\n9. T.S.O.P (The Sound Of Philadelphia)– MFSB ft The Three Degrees (1974) (UK#22,US#1)\n\n10. Boogie Nights- Heatwave (1977) (UK#2, US#2)\n\n11. Blame It On The Boogie – Jacksons (1978) (UK#8)\n\n12. Midas Touch – Midnight Star (1986) (UK#8)\n\n13. I Can Make You Feel Good – Shalamar (1982) (UK#7)\n\n14. Got To Be Real – Cheryl Lynn (1979) (US#12)\n\nTruly a disco classic and I knew it was back in 1979 when it was one of the first twelve-inch singles that I purchased. It feels like an Earth Wind and Fire/Emotions track with its spiky touches. This is another track which has stood the test of time, kicks off with a great intro and never lets up. Cheryl puts in a great vocal here but she was actually an exceptional vocalist with a huge range as tracks like “Star Love”, which became a follow-up single and “Come In From The Rain” from the debut album attested. In later years the material was not as strong and she faded from view without reaching the Top 40 again.\n\n15. Give It Up – KC & The Sunshine Band (1983) (UK#1, US#18)\n\n16. Theme From “Shaft”- Isaac Hayes (1971) (UK#4, US#1)\n\nCD2\n\n1.I Feel Love – Donna Summer (1977) (UK#1, US#6)\n\n2. Nights (Feel Like Getting’ Down) – Billy Ocean (1981)\n\n3. Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel –Tavares (1976) (UK#4, US#15)\n\nThe five piece Tavares brothers are up there with the all-time great family groups as far as I am concerned. They had been making inroads in the US singles chart for three years before this grandiose slab of pop disco including a US Top 10 placing for “It Only Takes A Minute” (later covered by Take That in the UK). On single release it was split into two parts but the full album version is what is on offer here and it is great. The lyrics may be cheesy (but not as cheesy as they would get with “Whodunnit”) but it’s all done with such conviction from producer Freddie Perren that it turns out a gem. Also on their album “Sky High” produced by Perren was the almost as good “Don’t Take Away The Music”. The Tavares’ association with disco was permanently cemented by the inclusion of the Bee Gees’ song “More Than A Woman” on “Saturday Night Fever” but their music encompassed slick R&B and commercial soul music. A remixed version by Ben Liebrand took this song back to the UK charts in 1985 when it reached number 12.\n\n4. Dance To The Music – Sly & The Family Stone (1968) (UK#7, US#8)\n\n5. Best Of My Love – The Emotions (1977) (UK#4, US#1)\n\n6. Instant Replay – Dan Hartman (1978) (UK#8, US#29)\n\n7. Oops Upside Your Head – The Gap Band (1980) (UK#6)\n\n8. Lady Marmalade – Labelle (1975) (UK#17, US#1)*\n\nIn 1975 futuristic space-age funk hit the mainstream. True it was more in the visuals and image than the sound as girl group Patti Labelle & The Bluebelles made the transition on the advice of Dusty Springfield’s manager Vicki Wickham to don elaborate costumes using what looks now like vast amounts of tin foil. The music was a kind of dirty gospel with the girls giving absolutely everything (sometimes too much!). It worked best of all on this tale of a New Orleans prostitute encouraging men to abandon “their grey flannel life” with the song’s hook “Voulez-vous coucher avec moi”. How our knowledge of French improved overnight in 1975! The US were impressed as it topped the charts, as it did in Canada and the Netherlands. The song, written by Bob Crewe (best known for his work with The Four Seasons) and Kenny Nolan has been covered many times, including a version in 2001 from “The Moulin Rogue” Soundtrack which wasn’t a patch on the original but topped both the US and UK charts for Christina Aguliera, Lil Kim, Mya and Pink.\n\n9. I’m On Fire – 5000 Volts (1975) (UK#4, US#26) *\n\nSounding like Los Bravos’ “Black Is Black” this introduced us to the (uncredited) voice of Tina Charles, who would become one of the leading lights of the British Disco Scene with her worldwide hit and UK#1 “I Love To Love”. Here, she was a session singer brought in to front the track whilst another girl Luan Peters was used promotionally. Tina’s vocal is appropriately blistering and it unsurprisingly became a UK Top 5 hit and made the US Top 30. The success of this probably led to the more explicit discofication of “Black Is Black” by French girl group La Belle Epoque which became a huge European hit in 1977 (and a UK#2) and French disco legend Cerrone including a version on his 1976 debut album. 5000 Volts carried on without Tina Charles and scored another very worthwhile hit with the slightly menacing disco track “Dr Kiss Kiss”.\n\n10. Can You Feel The Force – The Real Thing (1979) (UK#5)\n\n11. Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood – Santa Esmeralda (1977) (UK#41, US#15)\n\n12. One For You One For Me – La Bionda (1979)\n\n13. Megamix – Earth Wind & Fire (1989)\n\n14. Queen Of Chinatown – Amanda Lear (1977)\n\nYou couldn’t make Amanda Lear up. Statuesque blonde model of questionable age and heritage (Wikipedia places her date of birth as sometime between 1939 and 1950!), muse to Salvador Dali, girlfriend of Brian Ferry which led to her appearance on iconic Roxy Music album covers. She ditched Ferry for David Bowie whilst rumours of her emerged that she was a vampire from Transylvania and actually a man called Alain Tap. She posed naked in “Playboy” to dispel such stories and launched a pop career with her drawling Marlene Dietrich style vocals. Sounds like a fame-hungry flash-in-the-pan right? Well, her singing was an acquired taste but Europe lapped it up and to date there have been 27 albums, the last released in 2016, with her not altering her style a great deal. No Madonna like reinvention for her- she had all the reinvention one could need at the beginning of her career. Amanda Lear has just drawled her way sales of over 27 million. Still a big star of European television, in the US and UK we might just wonder why. A real-one off, in the way that Grace Jones is a one-off who lit up the discos and gossip columns. Lear’s most critically acclaimed recording was the album “Sweet Revenge” from 1978 which Jussi Kantonen and Alan Jones in their survey of disco “Saturday Night Forever” (1999) describe as “a Faustian fable enlivened by one of the most fabulous orchestral disco productions the entire era had to offer.” I personally have always preferred her vampire tale “Blood and Honey”. The track here is some nonsense about a woman running an opium den which was a very big hit in Germany and like all of Amanda Lear tracks need to be heard to be believed.\n\n15. Love Really Hurts Without You – Billy Ocean (1976) (UK#2, US#22)\n\nA hugely likeable slab of pop soul which launched Billy’s career becoming his debut hit on both sides of the Atlantic. There were a run of similar tracks including my favourite of all of his songs “Red Light Spells Danger” and then a commercially lean period of some seven years (the other Ocean track on this CD is from this era and is fairly forgettable) before hitting big and re-emerging as one of the biggest stars of the mid 80’s off the back of his Grammy award winning “Caribbean Queen”. This track will always be a huge crowd-pleaser every time Ocean performs live.\n\n16. Video Killed The Radio Star – Buggles (1979) (UK#1, US#40)\n\nDisco Classics is currently available from Amazon in the UK from £9.97 and used from £3.98. Make sure that it is this version you are purchasing as some reviewers seem confused and seem to be reviewing a different CD. Most of these tracks can be found on other disco compilations.\n\nHotter Than July – Stevie Wonder (Motown 1980)\n\nUK Chart Position – 2\n\nUS Chart Position – 3\n\nFour years on from his essential “Songs In The Key Of Life” opus Stevie Wonder put out his next proper studio album. The result, was for me, even better than what had gone before. “Hotter Than July” is the Stevie Wonder album that has given me the most pleasure over the years. Part of this might be because it was the first of his albums that I did not come to retrospectively, I bought it as soon as it came out but I think it is also because these ten tracks encapsulate the magic and genius of Stevie Wonder in a concise. meaningful way.\n\nStevie had not just been resting on his laurels since “Songs In The Key Of Life”. I would have liked to have been a fly on the wall at the Motown Offices when he announced that his follow-up to this huge selling classic album would be a double album movie soundtrack for a documentary about plants. The film is long-forgotten but with the music Stevie came very close to producing another essential work. It is certainly something I would consider as being five stars but just misses out on being essential. It’s very nature as a soundtrack meant it was a combination of songs with vocals, instrumentals and repeated themes which, although at times absolutely terrific, did not hold together as well as the best of his studio recordings. What it lacked was a big hit single like he had when he later worked on “The Woman In Red” Soundtrack, a much higher profile film which gave him his biggest selling hit in “I Just Called To Say I Love You.” Nevertheless, “The Journey Of The Secret Life Of Plants” was not shunned by the record-buying public. In the US it reached number 4 in the album charts, number 8 in the UK. Every time I listen to it I am surprised by how good it still sounds.\n\nWith “Hotter Than July” Wonder was back with a very commercial feel which produced a Top 5 and Top 20 hit in the US and really got the thumbs up in the UK with four top 10 singles including two which stopped just one place short of the top spot, very good going for a 10 track CD. And with these ten tracks we had very strong examples of what Stevie excelled at from uptempo funk, to social commentary, to political activism, to ballads which have become soul classics to those which edged towards the cheesy and as might be expected, everything was written and produced by the man himself. Technologically, he was once again using the latest equipment and although there was nothing radically different on this, his 19th studio album it certainly sounded fresh in 1980 and still, although not often critically cited as being amongst his very best, it still sounds good today.\n\nAlbum opener “Did I Hear You Say You Love Me” is a strong uptempo slab of funk which recalls the danceability of “I Wish” and “Superstition” without being as compulsive. This eases into “All I Do” which was a song from the Wonder back catalogue. He originally wrote it alongside Clarence Paul in 1966, in the early days of Stevie’s career, when he was aged 15 as a solo track for Tammi Terrell, best known for her classic duets with Marvin Gaye. I have always really liked Stevie’s version with its star backing vocalists including Michael Jackson, Miami hit-maker Betty Wright and representing Motown’s rival Philadelphia Sound, two thirds of the O’Jays, Eddie Levert and Walter Williams. It’s a really romantic track which oozes sincerity and there’s a good sax solo courtesy of Hank Redd. The original Tammi Terrell version was largely unheard of until Motown began raiding its vaults in its “A Cellarful Of Motown” series which appeared in 2002. Her version entitled “All I Do (Is Think About You)” is exceptional and completely blew me away when I heard it hidden on this CD set of unreleased tracks. It has become one of my all-time favourites, and so whilst I still enjoy Stevie’s very much, it is definitely the original version which really hits home for me.\n\nTammi Terrell\n\nWith “Rocket Love” Stevie certainly approaches the cheese counter in the way in which he had done previously with tracks such as “My Cherie Amour” and would certainly do again with “I Just Called To Say I Love You” but once again he really gets away with it and comes up with a track which I should write off as cheesy but find it impossible to do. This one has lyrics like “A female Shakespeare of your time with looks to blow Picasso’s mind” for goodness sake. And yet, from its “do do do” introduction it weaves a laid-back hypnotic spell and if lyrically dodgy it is musically lovely with an exquisite swirling string arrangement by Paul Riser.\n\nThe next track “I Ain’t Gonna Stand For It” was surprisingly chosen to be the second single from the album in favour of later singles which if released earlier would have surely topped the UK charts and in favour of another couple which remained on the album and which could also have been big hits. In fact, this is probably the track I like the least. As a single it got to number 11 in the US and one place better over here. It goes for a slightly hillbilly country and western feel, especially in the verse which gives the suggestion that Stevie’s vocal is not quite up to scratch, especially on the lower notes but it has a good humoured feel about it, which makes it pleasant but slightly throwaway, which is surprising that Motown on both sides of the Atlantic went with this track to follow up what has been the big opening hit from the album. The first side of the vinyl album ended with the much stronger “If You Could Read My Mind”. This is reminiscent of the salsa flavour that Stevie brought to “Another Star” from “Songs In The Key of Life”, which was a great track which just went on too long. This is shorter, tighter and effective, even though the song itself is not as likeable as “Another Star”. There is another memorable harmonica solo from Stevie, however.\n\nWith the lead single “Masterblaster (Jammin’) Stevie was largely giving kudos to another performer, in much the way he had celebrated the jazz greats in “Sir Duke”. Stevie had flirted with reggae before, most obviously with his hit track “Boogie On Reggae Woman” from 1974 but in 1980 Bob Marley and The Wailers had been Stevie’s opening act on his US tour (they hadn’t made the commercial breakthrough that they had throughout much of the rest of the world) and this track was largely Wonder’s salute to another musical visionary, Bob Marley. He gets a name check, “Marley’s hot on the box” and the album’s title is also referenced within this song. The song itself is optimistic and uplifting “When you’re moving in the positive/Your destination is the brightest star.” It’s as if amongst all the social issues raised within the music from both artists there comes a point when you just have to enjoy yourself and get dancing. Marley did not work with Stevie on this track but his influence is there. It’s a reggae flavoured track rather than a reggae track and that ensured its commercial success in the US who had to this point not fully embraced reggae. In fact, Marley would never have a US pop hit single. Stevie’s attempt to introduce his music to America reached number 5 Stateside and was a number 2 in the UK (held off by “Don’t Stand So Close To Me” by The Police).\n\nStevie with Bob Marley\n\n“Do Like You” is more, like “Isn’t She Lovely”, paternal pride, this time a song about Keita who was three at the time of this album’s release. It’s a musical anecdote about his love for dancing, learnt by copying his big sister, to winning a school talent show. It’s an enjoyable enough track and ends with Mummy’s vase ending up in pieces. From the light-hearted we move onto “Cash In Your Face” , the most serious track on the album where Stevie adopts the role of social commentator again in the guise of a potent funk track. It’s about insidious underhand racism with the title providing a clever play on words “You might have the cash/but you can’t cash in your face”. A track which still feels relevant today. Stevie here plays two roles, the tenant and the racist landlord and it all works very well.\n\n“Lately” is a little gem of a track and the album’s highpoint. This was the one everyone was clamouring for in the UK and Motown eventually relented making it the third single release and it got to number 3 (I still say it would have topped the charts if it was put out straight after “Masterblaster”). In the US something went very awry because it did not become a hit. It’s a majestic, superbly structured sad soul ballad about facing up to emotional insecurity and jealousy within a relationship. The piano work is beautiful and there is some real pathos about a blind man writing such lines as “But what I really feel my eyes won’t let me hide.”\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise came at the end of the album. Stevie had been a leading campaigner to recognise the birthdate of Martin Luther King as a US national holiday and here he advanced his cause considerably worldwide by putting the campaign to music. The nature of the track “Happy Birthday” with its sing-along chorus may have been felt to have clouded the seriousness of the issue lying behind the song, the non-recognition of a man who had done so much to further the civil rights movement. However, annoying the song might get it was effective in getting a message across to a wider audience. In 1983 Martin Luther King Day was officially agreed upon for a mid-January celebration and the first took place (it wasn’t exactly rushed in) three years later.\n\nIn fact, the message would have hit home more outside his homeland as it completely failed to make the charts as a single in the US. Perhaps a fourth single was asking too much of an American record-buying public who had already bought the album in droves. Over here we loved it and it once again took Stevie to number 2 in the UK charts (this time it was the less worthy “Green Door” by Shakin’ Stevens which prevented Stevie from getting his first UK solo number 1 single during the summer of 1981). I think we were looking for a viable alternative to the traditional “Happy Birthday To You” and both this and Altered Images’ 1981 hit with the same title which followed pretty hot on the heels of Stevie’s tracks provided this. For the past nearly 40 years both tracks have provided radio and mobile DJ’s with the opportunity to dedicate a song to someone’s special day. As an example of Stevie the political activist it fits nicely into the Wonder canon, but I’m not sure if it is going to be too many people’s favourite song by him, but it certainly gets people singing along.\n\nDespite welcoming Stevie into the 80’s, his third decade of hitmaking, this was the last time he produced an “Essential” studio album. Much of the 80s were taken up with compilations or soundtrack work. 1985’s “In Square Circle” was a solid, enjoyable release (which did feature in “Overjoyed” one of my all time favourite tracks). The nearest he has got to really blowing me away again was in his five star 2005 album “A Time 2 Love” in which he showed he was still a contemporary, extremely relevant performer. Despite this being so good it was the last Stevie studio album to date. Now in his late 60’s releasing new music is not so hot in his priorities.\n\nI really enjoy listening to “Hotter Than July” and more than any other Wonder album it takes me back to the time when it was released. My only gripe is that my CD copy suffers from somewhat muted sound probably because of the way it was taken from the masters in the early days of CD releasing. I’m sure the version currently available from Amazon which states it is “Remastered” has put this right. It’s not really an issue in itself because I just turn the sound up a notch but these tracks don’t work so well in general playlists on the I-Pod. I do have “Lately” on there however and just have to crank up the volume each time it comes on.\n\nHotter Than July Songs is currently available in the UK from Amazon for £5.69 and used from £1.88. In the US it no longer seems to be on general issue and is available, other than as an impor, used from $3.89 but it is there as a download. In the UK it is available to stream from Spotify.\n\nSongs In The Key Of Life – Stevie Wonder (Motown 1976)\n\nUK Chart Position – 2\n\nUS Chart Position – 1\n\nThere was a huge amount of anticipation surrounding the release of this album. It had been two years since his US chart-topping “Fulfillingness First Finale” and the leaks emanating from his record label was that this was going to be an extremely special follow-up. Potential release dates came and went and there was actually a mini-fashion explosion in “Stevie’s Almost Ready” t-shirts. In September 1976 the album appeared and it was a biggie in very sense. A double album and a bonus extended play seven inch single made it an expensive proposition. I know that I couldn’t afford to buy it until I found it much cheaper after it had been out a few years. On its CD release the 21 tracks fitted easily onto 2 discs.\n\nDespite the tongue-twisting title Stevie’s previous album had topped the US Charts and been a Top 5 success in the UK in 1974.\n\nI do acknowledge the common perception that this is one of the greatest Soul albums of all time. I do feel, however, that it could have benefited from a little editing, in the length of a couple of the tracks and I think there’s another couple that could have been dropped together without compromising this album’s status or reputation. It is not the highest ranking Stevie Wonder album on my list but it is still an essential purchase. The list of the Greatest Soul Albums of the 1970’s voted for by thousands on the Soultracks.com website has it at number 3 behind Earth Wind & Fire’s “That’s The Way Of The World” and Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s Get It On”. It was very much Stevie Wonder’s statement on the mid 70’s which came exploding through the speakers like a torrent.\n\nIt contained two UK Top 5 singles and 1 Top 30, two US number 1’s and two Top 40 singles and a handful of tracks which although never released as singles are all-time classics and rank amongst the best of Stevie’s output.\n\nFor an album which had such a big fanfare it has a rather muted beginning and does take a while to get into its stride. Album opener “Love’s In Need Of Love Today” is certainly a pleasant enough track but is an early example of a track which would have benefited from having a minute or so lopped off the end as it all gets a bit rambly and noodly. I didn’t think it stands out especially amongst other tracks really until George Michael (who said “Songs In The Key Of Life” was his all-time favourite album) began performing it on tour and as a B-side to his chart-topping “Father Figure” single. Michael’s version seemed to me to breathe a bit of new life into this original and I think as a track it has dated quite well. The insidious funk-lite of “Have A Talk With God” has not weathered the passing of time and sounded better on release than it does now. Lyrically rather heavy-handed “He’s the only free psychiatrist that’s known throughout the world” this has never been one of my favourite tracks on the album.\n\nIt’s the third track where things really crank up a gear when Stevie takes on his social commentator role on “Village Ghetto Land”. One thing Stevie Wonder always does well is to dress up protest into something that sounds really good. He’d done this before on tracks like “Living For The City” and here again. There’s a majestic synthesized neo-classical orchestral opening, courtesy of the Yamaha- GX1and this is counterposed with some pretty hard-hitting lyrics of poverty and crime; “Families buying dog food now/Starvation roams the streets”. It works superbly.\n\nNext up is the bruising, funk instrumental “Contusion” (contusion/bruising see what I did there?) which is not exactly vital to the existence of the album. It leads the way to the second US chart-topping single from the album (it reached #2 in the UK, his highest chart position for over 6 years) and is perhaps one of his most commercial tracks ever. Stevie could sometimes veer towards a fine edge of the annoyingly poppy or cheesy but because of that little dash of Wonder magic he is able to sprinkle over he ends up triumphant. This was certainly the case with his biggest UK hit “I Just Called To Say I Love You”, but also “My Cherie Amour”, with “Isn’t She Lovely” on this album and also “Sir Duke.” This joyous blast of nostalgia serves very much as a history lesson for a new generation. When I first heard this track as a young teenager I did not really know who Duke Ellington was nor his importance in the history of black music and here we also find out that “There’s Basie, Miller, Satchmo and the King of all, Sir Duke/And with a voice like Ella’s ringing out there’s no way the band can lose.” This is all-time classic pop name dropping alongside Madonna’s rap in “Vogue” and the fashion designers in “He’s The Greatest Dancer”. This is a lovely tribute track from its infuriatingly catchy brass introduction to singalong chorus. It’s the musical equivalent to eating marshmallows but knowing just when to stop before they make you feel queasy.\n\nThe second side on the vinyl version kicks off with the first single release which also topped the US charts and went Top 5 in the UK. This is a track which I think has got even better with time and now ranks up amongst Stevie’s best. “I Wish” reminisces on childhood and the passing of time in a storm of commercial funk. The childhood depicted is not one of cosy innocence as its about sneaking out, hanging with hoodlums and playing doctor but whatever was going on Stevie wishes those simpler times would come round again.\n\nThere’s a charming simplicity to “Knocks Me Off My Feet” as well as a strong melody which ensures this is a highspot. And like all Wonder songs with strong melodies this has led to a number of cover versions over the year perhaps most strongly by Luther Vandross on his 1996 “Your Secret Love” album. “Pastime Paradise” has a Hare Krishna choir on back-up and what I have always felt of as an African feel as Wonder dons the mantle of social commentator once again attacking those who view the world through rose-coloured glasses when the reality is; “Dissipation/Race relations/ consolation/ segregation/ dispensation/ isolation/ exploitation/ mutilation/ miscreation/ confirmation to the evils of the world.” It’s a song which has been very much absorbed into hip-hop culture. A sample took on a life of its own when it was used by Coolio on his “Gangsta’s Paradise” in 1995 where it was the biggest selling single of the year in the US, Australia and New Zealand and the second biggest selling (behind Robson and Jerome’s “Unchained Melody”!) “Summer Soft” starts off as another pretty ballad, surges upwards for the chorus but is another track which ultimately goes on a little too long. The first CD closes with “Ordinary Pain”, a song in two parts which has a first half which is a nifty little soul ballad which chugs along very effectively with Stevie very much in charge until it winds down almost to a stop before taking a funkier edge with a response from Shirley Brewer, aided by an impressive back-up group which features amongst others Minnie Riperton, Syreeta Wright, one-time Supreme Linda Laurence and Deniece Williams. At over 6 minutes it is another track which could have benefited from fading earlier.\n\nLuther and Coolio – two artists inspired by the tracks on this album\n\nThe second CD opens with the album’s high-spot and possibly Stevie’s best ever track. “Isn’t She Lovely” a father’s song to his baby daughter could really have gone either way and versions of it being used in beauty pageants have pushed it well over the edge but taken here in its original full-length version it’s a powerful piece. Stevie knew this and refused to allow Motown to release it as an edited single, which would have watered down its potency and its surprising funkiness. In the UK, in particular, there was a great demand for a single release and there is no doubt that it would have topped a chart. A limp cover by white session singer David Parton almost did but eventually stalled at number 4 and even the ignominy of this did not get the original out as a single. The Parton release seemed to be the latest (and perhaps one of the last) of a long line of tracks where a white artist would water down a black artist’s vision and achieve great success, a situation which had been occurring regularly since the dawn of popular music. I’ve said elsewhere that editing could have done a lot for this album but I would not edit one single section of this track, there’s brilliant use of harmonica and even daughter Aisha playing in the bath.\n\nAfter the bluster and grandeur of “Isn’t She Lovely”, “Joy Inside My Tears” feels understated, a mature, graceful, atmospheric ballad which sort of creeps up on you. “Black Man” is another history lesson as Stevie aims to redress the balance of traditional American history lessons by stressing the importance of the role of people of colour in the development of the USA. “It’s time we learned the world was made for all men.” Musically, the first section is a good paced funky track but however worthy the second half call and response catechism section where Stevie uses 43 voices of the Al Fann Theatrical Ensemble of Harlem to question and answer landmarks in the history of ethnic groups it does begin to grate on the listener. Stevie is not usually as didactic as this and has been much better at getting a message across without compromising the musicality of the piece but this is more questionable here.\n\nThe simplicity of “Ngicuelela-Es Un Historia-I Am Singing” feels even more effective after the last track. This is a quite lovely track sung in Zulu, Spanish and English and the high quality is maintained with “If It’s Magic” which beautifully and quite chillingly features just Stevie on vocals and harmonica and Dorothy Ashby on harp in probably the best ever use of this instrument in a pop song. Extraordinary.\n\n“As”, the 4th single release brought out after the album had been around for a year unsurprisingly underperformed reaching number 36 in the US Top 40. It is another one of those tracks that you get the message clearly long before it ends. It’s a good track but for me had a new lease of life when turned into a 1999 duet between George Michael and Mary J Blige. This is one of those rare occasions when a Wonder cover is better than the original. Both turn out performances that rank up there amongst the best in their career and got a UK#4 hit. Stevie’s version at over 7 minutes long pushes the song to the extreme. This is also the case with the 8 minute plus track “Another Star” which in a slightly more edited form would have been one of the album’s highlights. As it is, it starts to get on your nerves. Motown did put out an edited version of this track as a single which got to #29 UK, 32 US. In the edited version it is a thrilling salsa-influenced track with George Benson on guitar and backing vocals. The whole thing gallops along at a fair old crack, but on the album version the repetition of the “la la la” chorus once again overeggs things.\n\nThis is where the original double album ended and you had to fish around in the packaging to get to the bonus seven inch record. I didn’t bother that often because it felt like these were tracks not considered to be good enough to be included on the album but here on the CD their importance has been reinstated. In the mid 70’s we were all a little obsessed with things spacey, and Stevie ventures onto Earth Wind & Fire territory with “Saturn”. This is a good quality pop track with fairly trite lyrics of a Saturnite returning to his planet because of disillusionment with the way the Earth is going. It’s all rather grandiose, which because of that Wonder magic again escapes being pretentious and ends up being rather good. Following that “Ebony Eyes” is a fun novelty-type song which reminds me a little of “Your Kiss Is Sweet” which Wonder co-wrote and produced for ex-wife Syreeta. “All Day Sucker” has never really done it for me and is probably the weakest track on display and the whole thing is rounded off by “Easy Going Evening (My Mama’s Call) quite a mournful little harmonica-led instrumental.\n\nThere is no doubt that this album represents Stevie Wonder at his creative peak and these 21 tracks have influenced many artists who followed Stevie into the charts at least over the next decade. Prince said it was his all-time favourite album and artists such as Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston have also been keen to stress its importance for them and much of the solo career of George Michael derives musically from this recording. It is a great album but I did come to it a little late and this might be the reason why it is not actually my favourite of Stevie Wonder’s studio albums. That would come a few years later. It is an unrestrained slab of big dollops of genius which must have delighted the record company and re-established Stevie Wonder as one of the most important artist of the 1970s.\n\nThe video chosen comes from a 2009 concert in London where Stevie sung a medley of “I Wish” and “Isn’t She Lovely”. One of the backing singers is daughter Aisha, to whom the song is dedicated and who was making those baby gurgling noises on the track all those years ago.\n\nSongs In The Key Of Life is currently available in the UK from Amazon for £6.99 and used from £2.66. In the US it is available for $11.85 and used from $4.36. In the UK it is available to stream from Spotify."
