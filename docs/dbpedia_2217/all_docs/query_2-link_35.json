        "text": "Note: This article was originally published in April 2005. It was created at a time when African music was on the cusp of becoming an increasingly large part of the Western pop culture landscape. Portions of it have been updated to reflect changes in the past five years-- particularly changes in the number of compilations and labels available. Unlike last week's article on contemporary sounds in West Africa, this one is largely devoted to reissue and cratedigging culture, to the great African music of the previous couple of generations.\n\nThe Africa 100 section, in which author Joe Tangari creates an imagined introduction to Afrobeat, highlife, and a few other large strains of African pop music has not had its selections altered; however, we have added Lala links to many of the entries.\n\nAfropop music is a sound and a movement, music and a state of mind. It's the joyous awakening of a continent from a colonial nightmare and the crushing realization that the nightmare isn't over yet, anguish and happiness whipped together with traditional drums, cheap guitars, and even cheaper amps.\n\nThis article isn't an attempt to tell the whole story of African music; it's an account of the time I've spent exploring the popular sounds of 1960s and 70s Africa. It's not the easiest music to fall deeply in love with, in part because it comes from a place most Westerners aren't close to understanding, a continent obscured by our misconceptions, prejudices, and expectations of \"world music.\" The other difficulties are more practical: The most fertile period for African funk, soul, rock, and jazz lasted from 1965 to 1982, a time of great upheaval in Africa, and much of this music wasn't recorded. Of that which was put to tape, if the masters still exist, they're likely significantly degraded by decades of neglect.\n\nFor what has been recovered, distribution can be spotty, and the shop that has two things you're looking for is usually missing four other things you want to check out. Compilers of these sounds must track down the musicians, hunt out masters in forgotten, crumbling pressing plants, and sift through bins of scratched, dusty vinyl in the markets of Accra, Conakry, and Lagos looking for the lost slab of brilliant funk or the 45 with the highlife A-side and the totally unexpected fuzz-rock B-side. The rewards of those efforts have been huge, though, and I'm pleased this music is increasingly getting the spotlight it deserves.\n\nFrom Sea to Shining Sea Music in West and East Africa (a disclaimer)\n\nAfropop was a wide-ranging phenomenon, but the primary geographic area I've been exploring extends from Senegal in West Africa, along the Atlantic coast to Nigeria and Cameroon, and then over to Ethiopia and Kenya, with a detour or two to South Africa. This is an immense area, and the flavor in each country is quite different, from Kenya's rough-and-tumble funk to South Africa's sleek sophistication to the wild experimentation of Ghanaian funk and fusion bands.\n\nThe decision to leave out most of Central and North Africa is partly practical and partly a matter of taste. The sound of central Africa is focused on variants of soukous, the Congolese form of Cuban rumba that dominated popular music there for much of the 20th century, and I haven't really had enough time to hear an appreciable amount of it. It also bears little resemblance to either Fela's Afrobeat or any other tangentially related African pop music. Similarly, topography-- namely the Sahara Desert-- separates Mediterranean Africa from the rest of the continent, and the culture there is more Arabic than African. Raï, Andaluse, and other North African styles are singular, and though a bit of cross-pollination is inevitable, it's really an altogether separate world.\n\nNB: For an introduction to soukous, try Franco (2), Tabu Ley Rochereau, and Mbilia Bel.\n\nHighlife Time A Bit of History\n\nAfropop is fusion music in the truest sense, incorporating elements of essentially any available source material. Loosely speaking, the Afrobeat of Fela and other early practitioners like Orlando Julius Ekemode was a modernization of the dance-band highlife that dominated the popular music of Anglophone African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria. Highlife was a general term given to several styles of music that were themselves fusions of Western ballroom and swing music, Trinidadian calypso, Liberian sailors' songs, palmwine guitar music (so called because of the drink imbibed at events where it was played), and-- most importantly-- local rhythms. The greatest highlife star was E.T. Mensah, whose tours of West Africa with his Tempos Band spread the music far and wide. He's credited with introducing it to Nigeria, and his concerts with Louis Armstrong are among the earliest seeds of Afrobeat.\n\nThese new musical hybrids emerged at the same time as the Civil Rights movement in the U.S. and the decolonization of Africa by European powers, beginning on March 6, 1957, with the independence of Ghana under the pan-Africanist Kwame Nkrumah. American jazz, soul, and funk became outlets for politics and expressions of black pride. James Brown visited the continent several times, and a listen to any Afrobeat compilation reveals his influence. By the end of the 60s, the optimism spurred by independence had dimmed considerably as some initially democratic governments calcified into autocratic regimes, as economies stagnated, militaries took power, and currencies plummeted in value. Nkrumah, a great thinker and activist, wasn't adept at governing and was overthrown in a coup in the wake of some disastrous economic policy decisions and a declaration of himself as president-for-life.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that Fela took his band, Koola Lobitos, to Britain and the U.S., where he read the writings of Malcolm X and befriended members of the Black Panthers. When he returned home, his band had been renamed Africa '70 and he embarked on the long, wild course of loud, unflinching criticism of corruption and ineptitude in African government that cemented his legend and kept the Nigerian authorities exasperated until his death from AIDS in 1997.\n\nFela Music Is the Weapon\n\nOverstating Fela's position in African music would be difficult, and in Afrobeat specifically it would be impossible-- his contemporaries lived in his shadow, and newspapers referred to him on a first-name basis. Fela frequently fought with Nigeria's military governments, believing that inept or cruel local government was no better than inept, cruel governance from abroad. In Stephane Tchal-Gadjieff and Jean Jacques Flori's great 1982 documentary Music Is the Weapon, Fela-- sitting in a tattered chair in his communal home-- expressed his belief that blacks oppressing blacks in Nigeria is worse than whites oppressing blacks in South Africa, because it's more insidious: It's more difficult to comprehend your oppression when the obviousness of racism is removed from the equation, he theorized.\n\nSo much has already been written about Fela that it seems fruitless to rehash his biography, as fascinating as it is. Though he made huge sums of money from his music, he chose to live in a dilapidated Lagos compound-- his Kalakuta Republic-- with his wives and band members, and he disdained the Nigerian elites who ignored the city's massive slums and rampant crime. He also saw Christianity and Islam as destroyers of an African way of life and predicated his lifestyle, including his controversial polygamy, on a return to African spirituality. His album art spills over with these ideas: The imams and priests on the cover of Shuffering & Shmiling lord over piles of money near the words \"Why Not African Religion?\", while he blows bubbles containing the words and phrases \"Pan-Africanism,\" \"Total Emancipation,\" \"Freedom,\" and \"Justice\" from his sax on the cover of No Agreement.\n\nFela sang most of his epic songs in pidgin English to reach as wide an audience as possible-- Nigeria's Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, and Fulani communities could all understand it, and it exported easily to other English-speaking countries. And of course, there's his sound: Eighteen-minute epics riding endless polyrhythmic grooves, massive horn sections and choirs, incessant guitar ostinatos, and Fela's furious baritone. The arrangements were intricate, but left room for the accomplished soloists of the Africa 70 and his later band the Egypt 80. Fela's stage presence was mesmerizing, whether he wore his lime-green or aqua blue jumpsuits or just his underwear, his pink, cowrie-shell encrusted sax glistening as it hung from his neck.\n\nSinging in pidgin English had other advantages for Fela, as he was a great lover of wordplay and fluently bilingual-- he claimed in an interview with guitarist Keziah Jones that English is Yoruba \"wrongly spoken.\" \"Society\" is just another way of spelling the Yoruba \"so si ayiti,\" loosely translated as \"tied in such a way that it appears free,\" he claimed. Often he was less subtle: The cover of his V.I.P. album has \"Very Important Persons\" crossed out and replaced with \"Vagabonds in Power\" and he repurposed the acronym of multinational information conglomerate I.T.T. to stand for \"International Thief Thief.\"\n\nFela's outspoken stance made his life difficult and often tragic. In 1975, police arrived at his house intending to plant marijuana on him and book him for possession, but he confounded them by eating the joint. When they arrested him to get an incriminating stool sample, he merely swapped with another prisoner and walked away a free man, detailing the whole ordeal on Expensive Shit. His 1977 album Zombie, a furious critique of the military, prompted an attack on his compound that destroyed his home and left his mother with fatal injuries. Instead of backing down, he delivered her coffin to an army barracks and wrote Coffin for Head of State, a scathing indictment of the militarys brutal repression. On his defiance in the face of tyranny, he had this to say in Music Is the Weapon: \"My name is Anikulapo... I can't die. They can't kill me.\" Fela replaced his given middle name Ransome with Anikulapo in the late 70s. Anikulapo means, roughly, \"he carries death in his pouch.\"\n\nAbout the only thing keeping Fela from a lifetime in prison was the instability of the Nigerian government itself. Whenever he was jailed, a new regime would release him when it came to power. He remained an activist to the end of his life, never compromising his beliefs or positions to accommodate anyone. It's said that more than a million people attended his funeral, but whatever the numbers, Fela was the king of Afrobeat, and no one else comes close to that claim.\n\nMore Than One Man's Music\n\nThough Fela obviously looms large over African music, there were literally hundreds of great African funk, soul, and rock bands, with incredible scenes in Ghana and Nigeria in particular. The modernization of West Africa's other great traditional music, Juju, was concurrent with Africa's funk explosion, and though Fela was revered by many, he was easily outsold by Nigerian Juju master King Sunny Adé, who released as many as 100 albums before he was ever heard on record outside of Africa, on 1982's Island/Mango album Juju Music. Nigeria, by virtue of having Africa's largest population (and a hugely diverse one at that) was a hotbed of new styles, from Orlando Julius' \"Super Afro Soul\"-- immortalized on his classic 1966 album of the same name-- to the deeply Islamic Hausa funk of Ofo the Black Company and Sahara All Stars Band Jos to the heavy, disco-informed groove of Fred Fisher and Thony Shorby Nyenwi.\n\nNigerians also had the benefit of a highly professional music industry, and Decca (and its subsidiary Afrodisia), EMI, and Polydor all had massive operations there. Ginger Baker, who had become a great friend of Fela's and often sat in on drums on his early-70s shows, built the 16-track ARC Studios in Ikeja, the first of its kind in Africa. It soon had competition.\n\nWhile money flowed well in Nigeria, things were more difficult in other countries. Ghana's music industry was a web of shoestring operations that succeeded solely due to the raw talent of those involved, while countries like Ivory Coast and Benin produced far fewer groups than their neighbors. (Although Benin's Orchestre Poly-Rythmo was one of West Africa's greatest bands.)\n\nIn Guinea, the music industry was controlled by the government of president Sekou Toure, who set up a system of regional orchestras. Cubano son and rumba heavily influenced the music of the West African coast, and most of the bands in Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau-- along with Mali, further inland-- played some local spin on it. In Guinea, the Orchestre de Beyla was so amazing that it was elevated to the status of national orchestra. Known from that point forward as Bembeya Jazz National, the band was remarkably innovative for a government-controlled entity, with guitarist Sekou Diabate's searing, psychedelic tone and the band's Afro-Cuban fusion so thoroughly mixed it became its own style.\n\nSenegal's Orchestra Baobab was Bembeya's greatest counterpart, but Gambia's Super Eagles-- who played a style of Afro-Cuban music called Ndagga that was a precursor to Youssou N'Dour and Etoile de Dakar's mbalax music-- briefly garnered a lot of notice for their Sgt. Pepper costumes and energetic stabs at deep soul and British Invasion rock. Many of the bands that recorded soul or funk singles or albums weren't exclusively soul or funk bands. Highlife and Afro-Cuban bands frequently wrote and recorded one-off stabs at Afrobeat or American soul, and groups like the Yahoos or Ghana's African Brothers Band released a slew of singles touching on just about every sound you could name. The resulting swirl of styles is exhausting to research and exhilarating to take in.\n\nAround the Horn Outside West Africa\n\nWhile Afrobeat was primarily a West African phenomenon, it put down roots elsewhere, with a few nearly unheard bands popping up in the Soukous strongholds of Congo and Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). Zambia's Zamrock was largely indebted to the Congolese soukous sound, as well as South African township jive and mbaqanga, while Kenyan funk bands Matata and Mombasa were overshadowed by the popularity of the upbeat soukous offshoot benga. South Africa produced a number of remarkable funk bands, most arising from the prolific fusion and jazz scenes, but it was always peripheral music there.\n\nA limited number of African or part-African groups had success on other continents in the 60s and 70s, including Ghanaian/Caribbean prog-funk band Osibisa (the name means \"criss-cross rhythms that explode with happiness\"), based in London, whose albums were adorned with Roger Dean cover art. Exiled South Africans Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela, who were briefly married in the 60s, became minor stars on the U.S, folk and jazz scenes, respectively, while Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji's 1959 Drums of Passion album is widely regarded as the recording that created the world music industry. It's also the album that inspired countless jazz musicians to look to Africa for rhythmic inspiration, and was a direct influence on Coltrane's A Love Supreme, as well as Carlos Santana, who covered \"Jin-go-lo-ba\" and actually exerted a big influence on Afrobeat himself. And of course, there's Manu Dibango, the saxophonist/marimbist from Cameroon who recorded frequently in New York and scored a minor club hit (#72 R&B) with the tough funk track \"Soul Makossa\".\n\nNot surprisingly, Afrobeat had a huge influence on American funk in the 70s, and many Afrobeat compilations include American groups like Oneness of Juju and Lafayette Afro-Rock Band. Today, American groups such as New York's Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra, Kokolo, and Akoya Afrobeat Ensemble, and NOMO trade in Afrobeat. In Africa itself, the funk explosion died in the early 80s, killed by worsening economic conditions and the withdrawal of major Western record labels and their funding, which increasingly went to lighter Afropop fare and traditional recordings. By 1982, only two studios remained in Ghana: Ghana Films and the open-air Bokoor Studios, the last refuge of the country's electric highlife scene.\n\nToday, talk of so-called world music and even specific discussions of the history of music in individual countries tend to gloss over Afrobeat or ignore it entirely, something I feel is a reflection of how Westerners want to perceive the world more than anything else. The fact is that funk and psychedelia were worldwide movements, and black consciousness spanned the whole of the African diaspora, from Brazil and Peru to the U.S. to Jamaica, Britain, and of course Africa itself.\n\nÉthiopiques The Wonderful and Strange Soundworld of Swinging Addis\n\nOther local scenes produced distinctive sounds, but Ethiopia's \"Swinging Addis\" music scene of 1969-1975 developed in a place that was almost totally isolated from the rest of the world. One of the planet's oldest populated areas, Ethiopia was the only east African country never to be colonized. Apart from a brief, limited occupation by Mussolini's Italy, the country remained untouched by European mismanagement, and for most of the 20th century remained under the rule of Haile Selassie, the negus negast, or king of kings.\n\nEthiopia had no tradition of symphonic music and no real popular music to speak of in the immediate post-war era, but the country had adopted military marching bands, and Selassie's government kept tight control over the makeup and repertoire of the few institutional bands that did exist-- most of which were tied to the National Theater. Beginning in the late 1950s, the musicians and arrangers of these bands branched out and took steps toward incorporating Western sounds into their music. But it took all the way to the late 60s for this experimentation to find its way to the people, with the founding of the first independent bands. The institutional groups, like Police Band and Imperial Body Guard Band, diversified their sounds to compete, and Swinging Addis was born.\n\nThough record distribution by non-government entities was prohibited by a 1948 imperial edict, an enterprising young man named Amha Eshèté set up his own label, Amha Records, anyway and proceeded to document a period of incredible creativity and resourcefulness in the Ethiopian music community. Only one member of the entire scene, Mulatu Astatke, had received formal training in composition and arranging outside of Ethiopia. The only known Ethiopian vibraphonist, Astatke was a hugely important figure in Ethiopian music, arranging countless records and helping to craft the utterly distinctive \"Ethiopique\" sound, which has been well-documented in the last decade by France's Buda Musique Records, on a series by the same name.\n\nEthiopian music can probably best be described as dark, psychedelic funk and soul. It's as though a group of highly skilled musicians were told what funk, rock, soul, and jazz sounded like without hearing any examples and then went and played all of those styles at once on whatever instruments were around-- horns, vibes, electric organs, electric guitars, piano, harp; all of it was fair game. The singing is mostly done in a melismatic head voice, but you get the occasional James Brown grunt from Alemayehu Eshete (no relation to Amha) or a whispery, uncharacteristic singing style like that of Girma Beyene.\n\nThe Amha recordings have lo-fi warmth, but they're positively hi-fi compared to those on the Kaifa label, which rarely had the use of more than two microphones. The catalogues of Ethiopia's two local independent labels-- as well as that of Philips Ethiopia, the only foreign company to get significantly involved-- are a treasure trove of strange, inscrutable music that sounds like nothing else on the planet. Despite its uniqueness, it's mostly very accessible music to non-Ethiopians, and it's some of my favorite stuff.\n\nUnfortunately, the scene didn't last, and Haile Selassie's reign was brought to a brutal end with Mengistu Haile-Mariam's Soviet-supported coup in 1975. The curfews of the derg period, as Mengistu's reign became known, put the brakes on Swinging Addis, and several of the most important musicians went into exile, mostly in the U.S. Recording activity lingered on into the late 70s, but by the 80s, one of the world's most vital and vibrant music scenes had all but died.\n\n-=-=-=-Expensive Shit An Afropop Buyer's Guide\n\n__A Guide to Reliable Afropop Labels\n\n__\n\nWhen this piece first ran, access to African music in the United States looked a lot different than it does today. Partly, this has to do with the Internet (more on that later), but in the last several years, a number of labels have been established or entered the fray, digging up music from previously neglected locales. Interest has also skyrocketed, and the mark of African pop music has been stamped all over music from the West, from Vampire Weekend to Manu Chao to Gorillaz to West-meets-Africa groups such as the Very Best and Extra Golden. The global success of Amadou & Mariam, Konono No. 1, Tinariwen, Toumani Diabate, Rokia Traore, Oumou Sangare, and other artists has had plenty to do with rising interest as well. This aide for starting your explorations has been updated accordingly.\n\nWhether you're quickly sampling to satisfy your curiosity, expanding what you already know, or diving in head-first, you now have quite a few places to go to explore the music of Africa in all its many forms. Some releases are tougher to find than others and require virtual trips to specialty shops such as Dusty Groove, Honest Jon's, CDRoots, Boomkat, or Aquarius, it sometimes helps if you have a turntable, and you'll need to be able to open .rar files, but building a collection is within reach for anyone.\n\nMost African music is found in the U.S. on compilations, and these tend to go in and out of print as small boutique labels fold or bigger labels can't be bothered with keeping a low seller in print. There are a handful of very reliable labels, and there are also a few huge, general world music labels that offer African recordings in their vast catalogues. Here are a few to look out for:\n\nSoundway\n\nSimply put, Brighton, England's Soundway equals quality. The label is run by passionate people who do things the right way: Every track on a Soundway compilation is meticulously remastered, sometimes from vinyl if the masters aren't around anymore, and I've never noticed a drop in sound quality on any of its releases. More than that, the track selection on its multi-artist comps is nothing short of astounding and the label fills its liners with tons of information, including bits of input from the original artists when available. Its single-artist releases are equally rigorous and generally very comprehensive. Also, Soundway carefully licenses all of the music it releases, which is noble. They're branched out of Africa recently, releasing volumes of funky music from Columbia, Panama, and the French Caribbean, and their collections of Ghanaian and Nigerian pop music are uniformly excellent.\n\nAnalog Africa\n\nSamy Ben Redjeb's Analog Africa began as an attempt to resurrect old Zimbabwean music from the dawning days of Chimurenga. This yielded great volumes chronicling the Green Arrows and the Hallelujah Chicken Run Band but political and economic problems (to put it lightly) forced the label's eye elsewhere. It settles in the two small countries of Benin and Togo, sandwiched between Ghana and Nigeria on the underside of the West African bulge. Redjeb's entertaining liner notes usually take the form of a travelogue, with interviews with musicians, producers and label owners. He illuminates the process of finding the music as much as the music itself, and he's done a brilliant job of unearthing rare music by the eternal T.P. Orchestre Poly-Rythmo and some of the regions other major (and not so major) artists. You can't go wrong buying anything on this label.\n\nRetro Afric\n\nRetro Afric is a great UK label, usually specializing in slightly more traditional music. It's responsible for two great E.T. Mensah highlife compilations, a brilliant resurrection of a couple of LPs by Sierra Leonean funk master Geraldo Pino (Soundway concurrently reissued them on vinyl), the Super Eagles retrospective Senegambian Sensation, and a modest catalogue of interesting soukous records, including Vintage Verckys, a superb look at Congo's Orchestre Vévé, and sharp volumes on rumba master Franco and rumba rebel Gaby Lita Bembo. The label also has releases from Kenyan and Tanzanian artists, and a great retrospective of Zambia's Alick Nkhata, who worked for Zambian state radio in the 60s and made some truly wonderful music.\n\nOriki Music\n\nGenerally great stuff from Mali and Senegal, including a fabulous retrospective of Senegal's ageless Orchestra Baobab, and looks at Malian giants Kante Manfila, Sorry Bamba, and Moussa Doumbia. My favorite release of theirs is a stunning collection of lengthy tracks by Mali's Super Rail Band, led by guitarist Djelimady Tounkara.\n\nSublime Frequencies\n\nThis label has a real field recordist's aesthetic, and has releases documenting everything from a stash of Cambodian pop music cassettes found in an American library to recordings of North Korean state radio, plus straightforward compilations of Iraqi, Burmese, and Thai music and collages of Sumatran pop radio call-in shows. Its forays into Africa have mostly focused on the wild guitar music of the Sahara-- the unfiltered recordings of bands from Niger and Western Sahara. And if you've ever enjoyed a punk record, you likely won't need much context to enjoy Western Sahara's Group Doueh or Niger's Group Bombino and Group Inerane. The label also has a couple of DVDs of this stuff out, and a great compilation of early Algerian raï music. For other field recordings, Drag City's Yaala Yaala imprint has issued several volumes of field recordings made in Malian villages over the past few years.\n\nAfrostrut/Strut/Harmless\n\nStrut has ping-ponged from triumph to tragedy to triumph again. Forced into liquidation in 2003, the label was the best going during its too-brief original run. Much of the label's early catalog is still unavailable, but Strut came back with a vengeance in the last few years with a couple of great compilations of Nigerian and South African music. Their Nigeria 70 compilation was one of the first truly substantial Western retrospectives of African funk, and Ethio-jazz pioneer Mulatu Asatqe now records for the label. You may also know them from their Disco Not Disco compilations.\n\nSavannahphone\n\nA bit of an enigma-- the label’s once-authoritative website has vanished and its releases tend to come out in small collector runs. So far, they've released two volumes of very old Nigerian recordings dating from the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, and last year became the first label to take a serious look at the dance bands of Burkina Faso with the compilation Ouaga Affair: The Hard Won Sound of Upper Volta 1974-1978.\n\nPopular African Music\n\nThis label has been at it for quite a while-- try not to be discouraged by their archaic website, which promises a new site and shop in 2003-- and its released a number of interesting records, largely focused on the Cuban-influenced sounds of Africa. It released a volume of Poly-Rythmo's most Cubanized music, has volumes on artists from Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, and the two Congos, as well as a reissue of Burkinabe artist Amadou Balake's classic album Taximen.\n\nOriginal Music\n\nThis label is something of a legend. Established in the late 1960s by John Storm Roberts, it built an eccentric and impressive catalog of music from around the world, including the brilliant collection Africa Dances, the amazing Giants of Highlife compilation, a volume of urban music from Somalia, recordings of miners' songs from Zaire, Zambia, and Malawi, and a ton of other music from Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria, South Africa, Cameroon, Benin, and Ivory Coast, among others. This label was decades ahead of its time, and its releases are lost in out-of-print oblivion, but if you ever happen to find one, snap it up. The web is your most reliable source for Original Music, if you can figure out where to find them. Most of the label's releases made it to CD at one point or another, and they can be tracked down. Other titles to search for: Azagas & Archibogs and Money No be Sand.\n\nHeritage\n\nHeritage is a boutique label that's part of a family of imprints specializing in early recordings. It’s responsible for a few gems, including a collection of recordings by the West African Instrumental Quintet made in London in 1929, and a retrospective on early juju artist Domingo Justus.\n\nSWP\n\nWhat Harry Smith was to American folk music, Hugh Tracey was to the traditional music of Southern and Central Africa. He collected a vast treasure trove of recordings from throughout the region, many of them documenting styles and moments long since lost to the sands of time. He founded the International Library of African Music in Grahamstown, South Africa, in 1954, and a lot of his recordings were released on the extensive Music of Africa series of 10-inch LPs. SWP is essentially the modern curator of the collection, building it into well-considered volumes and re-releasing it on CD. I can't say enough about the brilliance of the music captured on their Bulawayo Jazz volume, which collects recordings of big horn bands from Bulawayo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) made in the 1950s. There was a finite window in which to capture that music, and Tracey was there, giving it to future generations.\n\nBuda Musique\n\nParisian label Buda Musique is one of the world's great imprints, with a massive back catalog stretching from traditional tribal music to the outstanding, ongoing Éthiopiques series. You want liner notes? The liners in a Buda Musique release cannot be beat. Full track notes, biographical information, historical context... it's all there, along with tons of photographs and lyrics translated from their original languages into English and French. The remastering is always amazing, although sometimes the sources are not easy to work with. The five-part Angola series is also intriguing, covering Angolan popular music from the entire post-war era, with each volume covering a different span of years.\n\nShanachie\n\nShanachie is another label with an unfathomable back catalogue, and it has released such a wide variety that you never really know exactly what you're getting, though the quality is likely to be high. It's no good for an off-the-cuff purchase-- I've wound up with a few records that were really not my kind of thing-- but if you've done your research, you'll be treated with good sound and usually lots of information. Shanachie keeps its back catalogue in print on its website, and I highly recommend Alemayehu Eshete's 1992 album Addis Ababa, one of a very few post-1975 Ethiopian records to gain wide release.\n\nSterns/Earthworks\n\nYet another behemoth, Sterns and its Earthworks subsidiary have labyrinthine catalogs that require research. The labels' outputs are too diverse to assume you know what you're getting, but there are a lot of great releases. The Sterns Africa reissues of Orchestra Baobab's early 80s albums are great, and anything that say The Syliphone Years on it is worth buying-- these releases document the great bands of Guinea in the 60s and 70s, and the Bembeya Jazz and Balla et ses Balladins volumes are especially great. The label's recent Congolese collections of music by Tabu Ley Rochereau (the Voice of Lightness) and Franco (the two Francophonic volumes) are superb. Earthworks is responsible for bringing South Africa's township music to light on the epochal 1985 compilation The Indestructible Beat of Soweto.\n\nHonest Jon's\n\nDamon Albarn's gem of a label has stepped up its African music game lately. Its early African output included a double reissue of two albums by Fela sidemen Tunde Williams and Lekan Animashaun, along with the excellent Mali Music. Since then, the four-volume London Is the Place For Me shined a light on African and Caribbean music recorded in London during the mid-20th century, Lagos Chop Up and Lagos All Routes collected highlife, juju and apala tracks, and last year's trio of releases, Marvellous Boy, Africa Boogaloo and World Is Shaking, paint a diverse picture of African styles as they evolved in West and Central Africa in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s.\n\nAnd Elsewhere…\n\nObviously, there are tons of other labels, many of them majors, who have at least dabbled in Afrobeat. Rough Guides can be a mixed bag, but it also uncovers some interesting things and is worth a listen. I've checked a bunch of them out of my local library. The best I've heard are the Ethiopia volume (it borrows heavily from the Éthiopiques series) and retrospectives of Youssou N'Dour & Etoile de Dakar and Manu Dibango. Labels like Naxos World and Nonesuch Explorer tend to be focused on a more ethnomusicological mission, but the quality is always tops, and World Village is starting to break groups like the great Saharan guitar band Tinariwen.\n\nVampisoul has recently thrown itself into Africa with a great deal of enthusiasm if not focus, and if you looks in the right places, you'll find small gems like Rounder's great Juju Roots compilation and the two Africa-focused volumes of Yazoo's Secret Museum of Mankind series, which focuses on antiquarian recordings taken from 78s and mixes popular and traditional styles freely.\n\nSmaller labels like Afrodisiac and Evolver released interesting comps early in the 2000s, but subsequently vanished (Afrodisiac's lack of liners is infuriating, too). And of course there's always David Byrne's Luaka Bop, whose African forays have been few so far, but whose releases are usually up to high standards. Their World Psychedelic Classics 3: The Funky, Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa is a great comp. Also worth mentioning is Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra's Ropeadope label, which has an interesting stable of artists, though it's not wholly focused on the revival Afrobeat sound that the band does so well.\n\nEssential Recordings\n\nThis is a list of 12 releases that would make what I view to be the perfect introductory Afropop collection, with a few notes on each (extensive notes on some of the tracks are in the mix that follows).\n\nFela Kuti: Expensive Shit [Editions Massoka; 1975; to be reissued in 2010 by Kntting Factory]\n\nFela released more than 50 albums in his tumultuous lifetime and approaching his catalogue is intimidating to say the least. To put a broad point on it, his most fertile period was the latter half of the 1970s, but it's genuinely difficult to come across a Fela record that doesn't make the grade. Thankfully, Fela is also the exception that proves the rule: Thanks to an extensive and extremely well-done reissue campaign by MCA/Universal (since repeated and improved by the great Chicago-based Wrasse label and continued this year by Knitting Factory), nearly all of Fela's recordings are currently available with great sound, original artwork, and good liners.\n\nMost albums are paired with another, and albums that get their own disc always include a few previously unreleased extras. I started with Expensive Shit/He Miss Road, a twofer of 1975 albums, and if I had it to do over, I'd start there again, because it's a great introduction to Fela's big sound and epic track lengths. Consisting of five tracks, all more than 10 minutes long, it's a monster disc, and though \"Expensive Shit\" is phenomenal, the original LP flip side \"Water No Get Enemy\" is even better, one of Fela's best tracks. For a second Fela disc, you can't go wrong with Zombie, a powerhouse record and a defining moment for Afrobeat.\n\nGhana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway; 2003]\n\nThere is no weak track among the 14 gems of Ghanaian funk here, some seeing release for the first time ever, and many of them are among my absolute favorite songs. Unremittingly funky and covering a ridiculous breadth of sounds and approaches, this is not to be missed. Volume 2 is almost equally amazing, and last year's double-disc Ghana Special set plunges far deeper into the scene to illuminate a ton of great, long-lost music.\n\nNigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut; 2002]\n\nWhen this article originally ran, this was out of print, but it's since been remastered and reissued, and you're well advised to take advantage of your second chance. This covers the full range of Nigerian funk and soul in the 70s, from Fela's early progressive highlife to ultra-heavy Hausa funk to the funky psychedelia of Blo and Joni Haastrup. Two discs packed solid with outstanding music and a beautiful, informative book of liners apparently weren't enough, though, as the compilers included a third disc of audio documentaries about Fela, Afrobeat, Ginger Baker (the interview with him is downright hilarious), and Nigeria in the 70s. The revived Strut followed this set up with the Lagos Jump sequel, and that one broadens the panorama to include more highlife and jazz-based material.\n\nÉthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\n\nVolumes 1 and 3 are excellent and cover the same period and different songs by many of the same artists, but Éthiopiques 8 is perfect from front to back. Girma Beyene's \"Ene Negn Bay Manesh\" gets things going with an entrancing horn arrangement, but the music here is all over the map, from Lemma Demissew's Fats Domino-ish piano rock to Ayalew Mesfin's biting garage funk, with plenty of points in between. This disc makes a good case that Addis Ababa had one of the best scenes in the world from 1969-1975. Éthiopiques has many volumes devoted to the era's biggest stars, and really any of the Golden Age-focused sets are worth your investment. The label has also launched a sister series called Zanzibara, which collects period recordings from the Kenyan and Tanzanian coastal cities, as well as some modern recordings of Taraab music.\n\n*\n\nAfro-Baby: The Evolution of the Afro-Sound in Nigeria 1970-79* [Soundway; 2005]\n\nFirst, Soundway unearthed a mother lode in Ghana, and now it's meticulously working on Nigeria. The songs here range from spare, almost traditional-sounding funk to thumping, gritty disco, with an especially nice early Fela track. Liners are superb, and though the label apologizes for having to master certain songs from vinyl sources, you'd have to be listening with a stethoscope to notice. Afro-Baby never got a second volume, but the label did us three better with its three superb Nigeria Special compilations, which respectively cover highlife, rock and disco in 70s Nigeria.\n\nOrlando Julius & His Modern Aces: Super Afro Soul [Phonogram Nigeria; 1966; r: Strut/r: Vampi Soul]\n\nThis is a defining album, and one of the first African pop records to break away from the highlife/Juju/soukous molds. Strut's reissue is simple and informative and crucially adds the \"Ijo Soul\" and \"Olulofe\" singles, defining pieces of African pop. It's said that \"Ijo Soul\" helped inspire James Brown's late 60s material, and it's not hard to believe it. It's now back in print again thanks to Vampi Soul.\n\nLegends of Benin: Afro-Funk/Cavacha/Agbadja/Afro-Beat [Analog Africa, 2009]\n\nThis compilation focuses on four greats of Beninois music: Gnonnas Pedro, Antoine Dougbe, Honore Avolonto, and El Rego. Along with the label's African Scream Contest collection, it's a head-spinning introduction to some of the funkiest, toughest sounds on the planet. What the musicians of Benin and Togo lacked in resources they made up for with creativity, developing a wealth of funky sub-styles that played off of local rhythms and amped up the imported Cuban rhythms that had become a part of the local music.\n\nBembeya Jazz National: The Syliphone Years [Sterns Africa; 2005]\n\nGuinea's Bembeya Jazz were one of the greatest dance orchestras of West Africa, and though only a few of their songs really sound like Afrobeat, their music was so unique it definitely fits the spirit. I can't say enough about guitarist Sekou Diabate's sinuous playing, but the rhythm section deserves equal props for creating a mysterious, thrumming vibe for the horns to soak in. The 2xCD compilation focuses on their early recordings, which have a beguiling, room-sound ambience that's easy to get lost in. The subsequent set centered on Balla et ses Balladins is nearly as great, as is the various artist Authenticité set.\n\nÉthiopiques 4: Ethio Jazz & Muzique Instrumentale 1969-1974 [Buda Musique]\n\nThis Éthiopiques volume concentrates on Mulatu Astatqe's instrumental music, and it's a trip. The textures on this record, drawn mostly from two different albums released in the early 70s, are out of this world, and the funk is deep, dark, and full of rough edges and unexpected twists. Strut released its own Mulatu disc last year, and it's even better, ranging more widely through his discography, with just a bit of overlap.\n\nT.P. Orchestre Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou: Four releases\n\nThe band's name expanded and contracted from album to album (they released dozens of them) and single to single (no one seems to know exactly how many of those they released), but regardless of how the sleeve referred to them, Poly-Rythmo were one of Africa's (and the world's) greatest bands. There are four releases available in the West: Sound Way's Kings of Benin Urban Groove, which focused on their funkiest, almost disco-fied work; Popular African Music's Reminiscin' In Tempo, which collects some of their best Afro-Cuban and highlife tracks; and two superb volumes from Analog Africa. The Vodoun Effect collects tough-as-nails funk tracks recorded on lo-fi set-ups for a scattering of tiny labels, while Echos Hypnotiques covers hi-fi funk recorded at EMI's studios in Nigeria for the powerhouse Albarika Store label. My personal favorite is The Vodoun Effect, but you can choose where to start based on how your tastes run.\n\nLove, Peace & Poetry: African Psychedelic Music [Normal/QDK Media, 2004]\n\nCazumbi: African 60s Garage, Vol. 1 [No Smoke, 2009]\n\nGoing off the beaten track a bit here, these compilations both gather psychedelic rock music from around Africa, and are pretty much your only sources on that front at the moment. The Love, Peace & Poetry series has done this for many different parts of the world, and while the releases look incredibly cheesy (I'm not sure what go-go dancer and Playboy model Cheryl Shrode has to do with African, Turkish or Chilean psych, but she's on all the covers), the assortment of music is really fun, and well outside even the ever-expanding box these efforts usually work in. The mixture of white South African acts and black acts from several countries is interesting, too. Also mixing black and white is Cazumbi, a superlative collection of rough-and-tumble garage rock, jerk and twist from South Africa, Mozambique, Angola and Zaire-- this one focuses on lower-fidelity material, with lots of chunky surf riffs and youthful abandon. I haven't heard the second volume yet, but aim to soon.\n\nSurfing Afropop\n\nWhen this article was originally written, the blogosphere hadn't yet taken much of a stab at African music, but what a difference a few years makes. Discographies are slowly making their way online, and there are now a great many places to sample music that's been otherwise unavailable for ages, or at the very least difficult-to-impossible to find in the West. This is a shortlist of the best places to go to listen and learn:\n\nVoice of America's African Music Treasures\n\nAn outgrowth of VOA's long-running Music Time In Africa program, launched by Leo Sarkisian in 1965, this incredible blog has access to reels and reels of tapes from all over Africa, and a huge library of 45s, LPs, cassettes and CDs that reach into just about every corner of music-making on the continent. Blogger Matthew LaVoie doesn't post every day or every week. This is because he actually researches every post in painstaking detail, often referencing interviews of the musicians, or when none present themselves, interviewing them himself. He's addressed countries like Somalia, Uganda, Sao Tome & Principe, Mauritania, Liberia and Malawi that don't usually get much attention. You will learn something from every post.\n\nWorld Service\n\nA great blog for the more old-school, less funk/rock-oriented stuff, this blog posts intensely detailed and broadly knowledgeable entries on music from just about everywhere in Africa. It's about as well-run as a blog based on a private passion and not operated for profit can be.\n\nLikembe\n\nSimilar to WorldService, this is a wide-ranging blog that knows its stuff and posts broadly across genres and regions. The blogger, John B., frequently seeks out and provides translations of lyrics and helps the reader understand the context of the music they're hearing. A good job all around.\n\nVoodoo Funk\n\nThe travelogue of a DJ named Frank who lived in Guinea for a few years, this blog's archives are loaded with gargantuan mixes of some of the hardest-to-find West African funk. Good stories about record hunting in Africa abound.\n\nOro\n\nA great blog that's mostly tuned in on Benin, this place is Poly-Rythmo heaven, and also good for getting a full panorama of Beninois music, from hard funk to Afro-Cuban to Vodoun ritual music.\n\nAduna\n\nYou'll need to fire up Google Translator to get the information (it's in French), but he posts a good assortment of music from Francophone Africa, with a particular focus on Senegal.\n\nAwesome Tapes From Africa\n\nJust what it says. It's mostly West African music, and runs the gamut from half-hour recordings of griot story-songs to casio-coated rap and rough highlife.\n\nGlobal Groove\n\nThe blogger here is not always knowledgeable about what he's posting, but his intentions are good, the music is hot, and he's up front when he needs help with the research. He posts stuff from Latin America, Jamaica and elsewhere, too, and he posts a lot.\n\nHighlife Haven\n\nAn occasional highlife gem pops up here. It offers little context and challenges you to take the music at face value.\n\nAfro Slabs\n\nTruthfully, you don't go here to learn a thing-- this blogger, who lives somewhere in Cornwall, rips and posts out-of-print African LPs without so much as a word about them. The research is up to you if you hear something you like.\n\n///\n\nThese aren't updated on a regular basis, or at least tend to go silent for ages at a time, but they're all worth a look. Go for the archives:\n\nComb & Razor: Some great music, mostly in a funky vein. The blogger, Uchenna, grew up in Calabar, Nigeria and often relates stories from his youth, providing personal insight into why he loves some of the ultra-cheesy Nigerian synth-pop he occasionally posts. It's a great read, and his retrospective of Michael Jackson-inspired album covers is well worth a look.\n\nSea Never Dry: Infrequent but great posts of rare music, with concise bu informative background information.\n\nNo Condition Is Permanent: This was one of the first blogs to focus on African music, and it comes and goes, but it's worth checking out for the detail of its posts.\n\n-=-=-=-Africa 100 Track-by-Track\n\nNote: This compilation was created in April 2005. We've not changed the tracklisting, although five years later we surely would make some tweaks, because it still serves its purpose-- as an excellent introduction to African music.\n\nIf you're knee-deep in funk records, you have to test them on the road, so I made seven mix CDs for the car-- 99 tracks and over nine hours of music, plus a vinyl-only bonus track make up this mix. Only two of these songs aren't by African musicians-- Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra's \"Big Man\" and Kokolo's \"Mister Sinister\" may be by American bands, but they fit too well to deny them a place on these discs. I've offered some notes on every track, along with country of origin and year of production, when it's available to me. I've also tried to note many of the places the song has appeared up on records available outside of Africa. Enjoy.\n\nDisc 1\n\n101. Fela Anikulapo Kuti & Africa '70: \"Zombie\" [Nigeria, 1977]\n\nAvailable on Zombie [MCA/Universal], The Best Best of Fela Kuti [MCA/Universal], Music Is the Weapon: The Best of Fela Kuti [MCA/Universal] and Black Man's Cry [Shanachie], and Best of the Black President [Knitting Factory]\n\n\"Zombie\" is top-flight Afrobeat, with Fela at the peak of his powers and Africa '70 sharp as daggers. The interlocking guitars stay on the same ostinato for more than 12 minutes as the horns surge around them. Fela's brilliant arrangement is full of unexpected gaps, blindsiding avalanches of sax, a hypnotic choir, and manic energy. His baritone growl drips with spite for Nigeria's junta and its loyal army, but he still injects biting humor when he wraps up the first verse by singing, \"Zombie no go turn unless you tell him to turn/ Zombie no go tinkle unless you tell him to tinkle.\"\n\nThe verses grow increasingly frantic as the song progresses, building to Fela's wild drill sergeant commands: \"Fall in!/ Fall out!/ Fall down!/ Get ready!\" Tony Allen's brilliant drumming deserves a blurb to itself-- the kick drum is almost completely independent from everything else he's doing, and he accents so many strange parts of the beat that it's a wonder he even knows where he is, but without his technique, the song wouldn't get anywhere. The Africa '70 was coming apart at the seams in 1977, but you can't tell as Fela leads the band into the final swell with a mocking rendition of \"Reveille\". Some protest music skirts around the issue with poetics or makes whining pleas for generic change; \"Zombie\" hits like a satirical hammer you can dance to. Perfect and absolutely essential.\n\n__102. Girma Beyene: \"Set Alamenem\" [Ethiopia, 1969]\n\n__Available on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\n\nThis is the sound of smoke wafting through the air in some Addis Ababa nightspot-- you can almost hear the drinks clinking in the background. The organ could have fit on Pink Floyd's A Saucerful of Secrets, but the song's dark, luxuriant sprawl is different from a traditional understanding of psychedelia-- it's altered states via ancient Coptic churches carved in solid stone, with the bass strangely mixed almost as high as the vocals. Beyene's whispered vocal delivery burns with quiet intensity and Mulatu Astatque's vibes wrap them in dense, unhurried atmosphere.\n\n103. Marijata: \"Mother Africa\" [Ghana, 1976]\n\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway] and Pat Thomas Introduces Marijata [Gapophone]\n\nThis is about as thick and pure as funk gets, a sweet syncopated horn arrangement riding a hard groove, some tasteful lead guitar, and a bit of solo trading. It could give the J.B.'s a good run for their money any day. I'd get into the intricacies of the composition or something, but really, this just slams, and there's nothing better in the world to drive to.\n\n104. Segun Bucknor & His Revolution: \"La La La\" [Nigeria, year unknown]\n\nAvailable on Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut] and Poor Man No Get Brother: Assembly & Revolution 1965-1975 [Strut]\n\nStrut's amazing Bucknor retrospective went out of print when the label went out of business, but he deserves another look. \"La La La\" is a simple soul number with a booming bassline and catchy \"la la la\" chorus, but Bucknor's delivery of the lines \"My heart is filled with rain/ All I've got is shame\" is devastating.\"\n\n105. Oscar Sulley & the Uhuru Dance Band: \"Bukom Mashie\" [Ghana, 1973]\n\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\nThere aren't many songs where just the drum fill is awesome, but this is one of them. A clattering pile of percussion starts at a frantic tempo, and then that simple fill ushers in a staggering bass line. Saxophones dart from side-to-side avoiding stabbing, voluminous horns; the funky beat swings, bobbing up and down like a car with soft suspension. Sax and flute solos and chanting vocals are all swept up in Sulley's wild arrangement, a sort of miniaturized take on Fela's cinemascope big-band funk.\n\nIt's amazing that it was never released until 2003, when the Soundway folks scooped the weathered masters off a pressing plant shelf. Sulley later led Ghana's national symphony orchestra and taught percussion to poor children in Accra.\n\n106. Geraldo Pino: \"Heavy Heavy Heavy\" [Sierra Leone, year unknown]\n\nAvailable on Afro-Rock, Volume 1 [Evolver]\n\nSierra Leone's Geraldo Pino was one of the first successful West African musicians to pattern himself on American soul and funk, touring with his Heartbeats band across the region and inspiring dozens of young bands. \"Heavy Heavy Heavy\" is just that-- heavy funk full of slamming kick drum, deep bass and whirring organ that rockets along, modulating unexpectedly for the choruses. It's a crime that this is the only Pino track available.\n\n107. Super Eagles: \"Love's a Real Thing\" [Gambia, 1972]\n\nAvailable on Viva Super Eagles [Decca], World Psychedelic Classics 3: Love's a Real Thing, The Funky Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa [Luaka Bop], Senegambian Sensation [Retro Afric]\n\nGambia's Super Eagles were one of many West African bands who specialized in an older style of music that tried their hand at rock, funk, or soul, and \"Love's a Real Thing\" is a fantastic slice of psychedelic soul that earns the Sgt. Pepper's uniforms they were famous for wearing. More typically, they played a style called Ndangga, a Cuban-influenced precursor to Youssou N'Dour and Etoile de Dakar's mbalax music, but the layered lead vocals and screaming chorus of this song make for their finest moment to my ears.\n\n108. Orlando Julius & His Modern Aces: \"Ijo Soul\" [Nigeria, 1966]\n\nAvailable on Super Afro Soul [Strut]\n\nOrlando Julius' Super Afro Soul is a milestone of African popular music and is said to have influenced some of James Brown's late 60s output. Listening to this contemporaneous single, which Strut helpfully appended to the album on their excellent reissue, it's hard not to notice the structural similarity to Brown's \"I Feel Good\", or the fact that one of the horn riffs essentially predicts Sam & Dave's \"Soul Man\". This is good-time early African funk and one of the most important songs that almost nobody's ever heard.\n\n109. Matata: \"Talkin' Talkin'\" [Kenya, 1974]\n\nAvailable on AfricaFunk: The Original Sound of 1970s Funky Africa [Harmless]\n\nSweet mother popcorn, funk does not get any grittier than this. The bass and drums are tough as rawhide and the lead vocal is a dirty, filthy, nasty delight. The thousand-watt horns blare so brightly you can feel the air passing over the curved brass. Kenya only produced a few notable funk bands in the 70s, but Matata were truly world-class.\n\n110. Ayalew Mesfin: \"Hasabe\" [Ethiopia, 1973]\n\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\n\nThere's no sense beating around the bush: This song rips, with a nasty fuzz guitar riff presaging a filthy funk throwdown full of stabbing horns and Mesfin's uniquely Ethiopian vocals. The rhythm guitarist is sick on this track-- to think that this came from a government-controlled orchestra is mindblowing.\n\n111. Super Mambo 69: \"Sweeper Soul\" [Congo, 1972]\n\nAvailable on Afro-Rock, Vol. 1 [Evolver]\n\nI've heard it said that Super Mambo weren't typically a soul band, but you'd never know it from listening to this frantic rocker. The song's funky undercarriage is like some sort of perpetual motion machine, and the track gains energy as it goes along, the barking vocals piling up on top of light-speed guitars. The weirdest thing about it is the lead guitar, though, which sounds like it's being piped in from Neptune, dripping in reverb and tremolo.\n\n112. Babatunde Olatunji: \"Jin-Go-Lo-Ba\" [Nigeria, 1959]\n\nAvailable on Drums of Passion [Columbia/Legacy]\n\nPeople are more likely to know this one from Santana's cover version, but Olatunji's traditional version is every bit as thrilling, despite coming up much shorter on ingredients. You could say the most important ingredient isn't even one you'd find in the liner notes, and that's enthusiasm. Well, enthusiasm and rhythm. Gobs of ecstatic, unstoppable rhythm.\n\nDrums of Passion is the record that many credit with inaugurating the \"world music\" industry, and it was hugely influential in jazz circles, turning luminaries like John Coltrane, Pharoah Sanders, and Miles Davis on to the music of their ancestors.\n\n113. Dick Khoza: \"African Jive\" [South Africa, 1976]\n\nAvailable on Afrika Underground Jazz, Funk & Fusion Under Apartheid [Counterpoint] and Afro-Funk Explosion: Motherload from the Motherland [Explosive Entertainment]\n\nSomething about South Africa makes the music it produced in the 70s very different from the rest of the continent. Apartheid was no doubt a part of it, but I think money was a bigger part-- the South African music industry was much better-funded than those in other African countries. As a result, even speedy funk like Khoza's \"African Jive\" has a smoothness that can be off-putting. The scrappy guitars, floods of Fender Rhodes, and blaring horns on this instrumental do plenty to offset that, though, as does the track's overwhelming kinetic energy.\n\n114. Orchestra Baobab: \"Mouhamadou Bamba\" [Senegal, 1980]\n\nAvailable on Bamba [Sterns Africa] and The Rough Guide to the Music of Senegal and Gambia [Rough Guides]\n\nUsually, Baobab were one of the best of the West African Afro-Cuban dance bands, but this title track from their 1980 album, named for a revered Islamic figure (Bamba was the founder of the Mouride sect and is esteemed before Mouhammed by many in West Africa), is a brooding slab of hip-deep psychedelic funk coated in Barthelemey Attisso's shimmering, volcanic lead guitar. The vocals are layered and deeply reverent, floating in leagues of reverb.\n\n115. Os Bongos: \"Kazukuta\" [Angola, 1974]\n\nAvailable on Angola 70s: 1974-1978 [Buda Musique]\n\n\"Kazukuta\" is the name of a traditional Angolan carnival dance, but this is one of the few Angolan tracks I've heard that incorporates experimental elements. OK, \"experimental\" is perhaps a bit of stretch, but it is incredibly odd nonetheless to hear a bizarre interlude like the reverb and delay-drenched vocal pile-up that dominates the middle of this song, which is unusually funky for Angola to begin with. A curiosity perhaps, but a very good one.\n\n116. Getatchew Mekurya: \"Yegenet Muziqa\" [Ethiopia, 1972]\n\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 14: Getachew Mekurya, Negus of Ethiopian Sax [Buda Musique]\n\nGetatchew was something of an oddity in Ethiopia's Swinging Addis era, and that's really saying something. His saxophone style is based on an improvised, melismatic Ethiopian war chant called Shellela. The result is something akin to Albert Ayler, but with the strange underpinning rhythms and electric organ of Ethiopian funk backing it up. Mekurya played in several of Ethiopia's orchestras and is heard backing the country's big stars on numerous recordings, but his solo material is some of the most unique music in the world.\n\nDisc 2\n\n201. Brigth Engelberts & the B.E. Movement: \"Get Together\" [country unknown, 1978]\n\nAvailable on Booniay!!: A Compilation of West African Funk [Afrodisiac]\n\nAbout the only thing I know about Brigth Engelberts is that he was one funky dude. I can't find any decent information on the guy or his band, but \"Get Together\" is a solid rocket ride from the opening horn fanfare all the way to its final reprise. The guitar and sax solos are sweet and economical, but it's the weird, ring-modulated analog synth solos and interjections that give the instrumental its strange, quasi-futuristic edge.\n\n202. Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra: \"Big Man\" [United States, 2004]\n\nAvailable on Who Is This America? [Ropeadope]\n\nOn 2004's Who Is This America?, Antibalas began to move beyond an easy tag as near-religious Africa '70 revivalists, and this is one of their best songs to date. The New York band have so thoroughly subsumed Fela's aesthetic into their collective being that they're now building on it, and \"Big Man\" is a masterful casting of the class divide between rich and poor in terms the king of Afrobeat would no doubt appreciate.\n\nFela was never afraid to criticize the very people he was speaking in favor of, and likewise, Antibalas aren't afraid to admit that consuming the products that enrich the wealthy helps keep them in power. The groove is feisty and the playing rich in detail-- it would be easy to simply imitate vintage Afrobeat and come up with something halfway decent, but these guys are the real deal.\n\n203. Oscar Sulley & the Uhuru Dance Band: \"Olufeme\" [Ghana, 1973]\n\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\nAnother Sulley track from the vaults, and I hope there are a lot more where it came from. The massive horn arrangement sways and dives like a ton of bricks set teetering on a precipice, while Sulley's vocals belt with rough soul. Uhuru Dance Band was a long-running, successful dance orchestra specializing in highlife, but as this and their own recordings without Sulley (they were a band in their own right from the mid-60s to mid-80s) attest, they were hugely versatile. Sulley, meanwhile, deserves a volume to himself if there's enough material to fill it.\n\n204. Thony Shorby Nyenwi: \"No Wrong Show\" [Nigeria, 1978]\n\nAvailable on Afro Baby: the Evolution of the Afro Sound in Nigeria 1970-1979 [Soundway]\n\nIn spite of Nyenwi's understated, wah-drenched \"Voodoo Chile\" guitar intro, it's all about the beat on this one. The scratchy guitars and thumping drums do all of the heavy lifting for his odd, slurred vocal, and it's the kind of thing that probably would have been sampled about 80 times by now were it not for its total obscurity. Disco made major inroads to African funk in the late 70s, and this song is a good example of that influence making itself felt.\n\n205. Ogyatanaa Show Band: \"Disco Africa\" [Ghana, 1976]\n\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz 2: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\nOgyatanaa (Burning Torch) was the outlet for the compositions of Kwadwo Donkoh, one of Ghana's greatest producers and musical innovators-- his fingerprints are on dozens of the best Ghanaian Afrobeat and funk records and he's responsible for both the first instrumental LP released in West Africa (Keyboard Africa by Ray Ellis), as well as the only known album of African Christmas songs. \"Disco Africa\" rides a killer break and keeps the vocals low in the mix, just letting the groove do its thing. Incredibly, Soundway is the first label ever to issue it.\n\n206. Wallias Band: \"Muziqawi Silt\" [Ethiopia, 1977]\n\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 13: Ethiopian Groove [Buda Musique] and The Rough Guide to the Music of Ethiopia [Rough Guides]\n\nIf James Bond were named Alemayehu and worked for the Negus instead of the Queen, this could be his theme song. Wallias Band was led by Girma Beyene and was one of a few outfits that managed to have creative success in the Mengistu years, lasting all the way through the extremely tumultuous 80s. This is a killer Ethio-groove instrumental with a perfect, unique mix of sleek soul and deep, dark horns only Addis Ababa seems capable of turning out. The nagging guitar and bobbing rhythm section exude icy cool, and the lo-fi recording (two microphones, max) shrouds it in a mysterious, majestic veil that no slick recording could ever capture.\n\n207. Lemma Demissew: \"Astawesalehu\" [Ethiopia, 1968 or 69]\n\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\n\nLemma Demissew was a pianist for several of the Ethiopian institutional bands, and on his own he has a bizarre resemblance to Fats Domino. \"Astawesalehu\" is an Ethiopian \"Ain't That a Shame\", with Demissew's motoring piano powering a piece of sweet, old-timey rock'n'roll that was likely created with only the barest of knowledge of what that actually sounded like. The call-and-response vocals are infectious and unusually sunny for Ethiopian music, and if American radio conglomerates were willing to overlook the fact that it's sung in Amharic, this could slot in pretty well on any oldies station's playlist.\n\n208. Apagya Show Band: \"Kwaku Ananse\" [Ghana, 1974]\n\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\n\"Kwaku Ananse\" has all the hallmarks of great Ghanaian Afrobeat: Big, crashing cadences, hovering electric organs mixing with tight horns, and an urgent, propulsive beat designed to hold and release tension as needed. The rhythm comprises dozens of small components, like the ultra-simple, repetitive bassline, a ton of percussionists mingling in polyrhythmic conversation, and the song swaggers swiftly along for an economical three minutes, incredibly brief by Afrobeat standards. Apagya was something of a Ghanaian supergroup, featuring Ebo Taylor, Bob Pinado, Gyedu Blay-Ambolley, and members of the Uhuru Dance Band.\n\n209. Fela Ransome Kuti & Africa '70: \"Roforofo Fight\" [Nigeria, 1972]\n\nAvailable on Roforofo Fight/The Fela Singles [MCA/Universal], The Best Best of Fela Kuti [MCA/Universal], Music Is the Weapon: The Best of Fela Kuti [MCA/Universal], Two Sides of Fela: Jazz & Dance [Barclay], Music Is the Weapon of the Future, Vol. 1 [Exworks], Essential Afrobeat: The Very Best of Afrobeat 3CD Mix [Family Recordings], AfricaFunk, Vol. 2: Return to the Original Sound of 1970s Funky Africa [Harmless], and Best of the Black President [Knitting Factory]\n\n\"Roforofo Fight\" is one of Fela's early masterworks, riding one of his trademark infinite grooves, with claves and shakers guiding Tony Allen's across-the-beat drumwork. Muted guitars insist on forward motion and even the horns settle into riffs, with an especially catchy sax ostinato backing up the melodic solos at the end.\n\nFela's vocals are twitchy and frenetic, spilling out in scat passages and ignoring the boundaries between English and Yoruba. The narrative basically speaks of how two men fighting makes a fool of both men, and Fela uncharacteristically takes the mic at the beginning of the song, presaging the powerful horn themes with a strange bilingual monologue about trousers and pants that he would later build into a full-bodied metaphor for colonial oppression on Opposite People's \"Equalisation of Trouser and Pant\".\n\n210. Monomono: \"Tire Loma Da Nigbehin\" [Nigeria, 1974]\n\nAvailable on Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\n\nMonomono was led by the great Joni Haastrup, and they played deep funk full of harmony vocals, bubbling organ, and sharply strummed guitars. \"Tire Loma Da Nigbehin\" rides that deep funk base, coloring the edges with psychedelic flourishes in a prime example of the melting pot that West African popular music was in the 70s.\n\n211. Ofo the Black Company: \"Allah Wakbarr\" [Nigeria, 1972]\n\nAvailable on World Psychedelic Classics 3: Love's a Real Thing, the Funky Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa [Luaka Bop] and Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\n\nOfo's biggest hit may feature lyrics exalting God, but the holy racket they churn out here is more commonly associated with the man downstairs. This is ridiculously heavy, riding a distorted guitar figure and pounding drums and the lead guitars and organ wail away. It's crushing, funky acid rock and truly amazing stuff.\n\n212. Joe Mensah: \"Africa Is Home\" [Ghana, 1975]\n\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz 2: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\nJoe Mensah's jazz influence is clear on \"Africa Is Home\", and both the drums and congas play fast and loose with the rhythms. The horns are right out in your face, though, and the female backing vocals' intonation of \"home sweet home\" has a nearly doo wop feel to it. That epic horn arrangement is what really makes this cook, though.\n\n213. Lijadu Sisters: \"Orere Eljigbo\" [Nigeria, 1979]\n\nAvailable on Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut] and Essential Afrobeat: the Very Best of Afrobeat 3CD Mix [Family Recordings]\n\n\"Get Out/ Fight/ Trouble in the streets\" is the rallying cry the Lijadu Sisters use to open this disco-influenced song. The sisters had toured with Ginger Baker's Salt and can be heard on a great many Nigerian recordings of the 70s and 80s. This song, whose story of a couple attempting to have a child without success is typical of many African popular songs in its use of everyday drama to point out inadequacies in society at large, amply demonstrates that they were capable of striking gold on their own.\n\n214. Bembeya Jazz National: \"Petit Sekou\" [Guinea, 1977]\n\nAvailable on The Syliphone Years [Sterns Africa]\n\nBembeya cut a huge number of stunning records, but this may be the best. An instrumental featuring Sekou Diabate's guitar front and center, it slinks through bluesy verses and cuts on a dime into unexpected swing passages. In the blues sections, Diabate's guitar burns with the tone of Robert Fripp and the intensity of Eddie Hazel, even more remarkable given that it's unlikely Diabate knew who either man was. This is a jaw-dropping piece of music, and it's a wonder it hasn't shown up in more places.\n\nDisc 3\n\n301. Gyedu Blay-Ambolley & the Steneboofs: \"Simigwado\" [Ghana, 1973]\n\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\nUnfortunately, I can't figure out how to transcribe all of the funky little vocalizations Gyedu Blay makes on \"Simigwado\", nor his Fanti rapping, so it's difficult to convey just how infectious this song is. The song was banned for being obscene by Ghanaian authorities, though they had no idea what it was actually about. Turns out anyone who speaks English will learn pretty quickly that it's a dance, because Gyedu spells it out pretty clearly: \"One, two, three, baby/ Oh-ah-oh can you dance?/ We call it Simigwa/ I'm gonna show you how to do it, yeah\" before the colossal horn arrangement kicks in.\n\n302. Jingo: \"Fever\" [country unknown, 1974]\n\nAvailable on Afro-Rock, Volume 1 [Evolver]\n\n\"Fever\" puts its polyrhythm right out front, layering a 6/8 chakachas beat over a thumping 4/4 funk groove. The vocal melody, bassline, and horn arrangement are all syncopated differently, giving the song undeniable forward momentum. Between the verses, a grunting, screaming Jingo duels it out with the free-flowing solos of one his sax players, and the listener comes out on top.\n\n303. Joni Haastrup: \"Greetings\" [Nigeria, 1977]\n\nAvailable on Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\n\nJoni Hasstrup (I've also seen it spelled Johnny) was a well-traveled individual, leading several Nigerian rock and funk bands during the 60s and 70s and joining Ginger Baker's sadly short-lived Salt project, a half British/half African band that attempted to wed UK rock to Afrobeat, which wasn't actually as big a stretch as it might sound. On his own, he was a sharp songwriter, and \"Greetings\" is an absolute dancefloor killer with a monster bassline. Haastrup's soulful vocals tower over the recording, dripping with reverb in an otherwise dry mix. It's sung in Yoruba, but this still could have lit up an American disco in '78.\n\n304. Honny & the Bees Band: \"Psychedelic Woman\" [Ghana, 1973]\n\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\n\"Psychedelic\" was a world-wide buzzword in its day, and on one of his few solo tracks, Ghanaian session keyboardist Ernest Honny runs down the exploits of the psychedelic men and women of Accra in all of the hottest nightpots, including the Apollo and Star Hotel. His organ solo is spectacular, but the song is probably most notable for slipping from a slow Afrobeat verse into a massive mod chorus, with big harmonies that could have fit nicely on a Yardbirds record. It's a stunning collision of Western and African music in which both get their big moments, and it's even more incredible when you consider that the song is a full quarter of all his recorded output.\n\n305. Yahoos: \"Mabala\" [country and year unknown]\n\nAvailable on Afro-Rock, Volume 1 [Evolver]\n\nThis is one of only a couple vintage African dub tracks I've heard, which is kind of surprising given that Jamaican music otherwise had a broad influence on West Africa. Strange swirling noises and a disembodied woman's voice hover over the band's solid base of breezy funk, but we're not quite in Lee Perry territory-- aside from the effects and samples, the recording is straightforward midtempo funk with impressive sax and guitar solos, with a minimum of stereo trickery and other deep dub trademarks.\n\n306. Blo: \"Blo\" [Nigeria, 1975]\n\nAvailable on Phases: 1972-1982 [AfroStrut] and Afro-Funk Explosion: Motherload From the Motherland [Explosive Entertainment]\n\nBlo's Phases retrospective is sadly out of print now (R.I.P. Strut), but hopefully somebody will resurrect it soon. The Nigerian band played a distinctly hard brand of psychedelic funk, and their signature song is drenched in organ and wah pedal. The arrangement is full of clever details and unexpected start/stop passages, and guitarist Berkley \"Ike\" Jones' solo positively rips.\n\n__307. Tlahoun Gessesse: \"Alegntaye\" [Ethiopia, 1973]\n\n__Available on Éthiopiques 17: Tlahoun Gessesse [Buda Musique] and The Rough Guide to the Music of Ethiopia [Rough Guides]\n\nTlahoun Gessesse was one of Ethiopia's biggest stars, having performed with all the big institutional bands in the 50s and 60s, and he had one of the country's most prolific recording careers in the years leading up to the overthrow of Haile Selassie and the death of Ethiopia's most vitally creative period. \"Alegntaye\" means \"My Hope\", though Western ears would have a tough time reading a tender song of yearning into Gessesse's mind-blowing melismatic vocals and Mulatu Astatque's inky arrangement. Astatque's midnight funky aesthetic is deeply alluring, though, and the sputtering, wah'd-out guitar works nicely as a searching sonic analogue to Gessesse's pleas: \"Where can I find you?/ I am all mixed up/ Where are you hiding, my love?/ Show yourself, I miss you.\"\n\n__308. K. Frimpong & His Cubano Fiestas: \"Hwehwe Mu Na Yi Wo Mpena\" [Ghana, 1977]\n\n__Available on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\nCuban music had more of an impact on Africa's far western coast than it did along the southern coast of West Africa, but it shows up now and then. K. Frimpong was one of Ghana's most innovative guitar players, slyly funky and a skilled, fluid soloist. His \"Cubano Fiestas\", as they're credited here, were actually Vis-a-Vis, a prolific and quite capable band in their own right. The song's Cuban feel comes mostly in the vocals and chord progression, while the bounding, anti-gravity rhythms are all Ghanaian Afrobeat.\n\n__309. Fela Anikulapo Kuti & Africa '70: \"Gentleman\" [Nigeria, 1973]\n\n__Available on Confusion/Gentleman [MCA/Universal], The Best Best of Fela Kuti [MCA/Universal] [edit], Music Is the Weapon: The Best of Fela Kuti [MCA/Universal] [edit], Music Is the Weapon of the Future, Vol. 2 [Exworks], and Best of the Black President [Knitting Factory]\n\nFela was sent by his parents to Britain to study medicine, but he was more interested in playing jazz and highlife and we're all better off for it. His jazz influence comes through very strongly on \"Gentleman\", the title track from one of his 1973 albums, where he solos on his tenor over most of the song's nine-minute intro, including a beautiful solo passage where the rhythm section lays out entirely. He switches to his ever-present Rhodes piano during the vocal sections, and the instrument's mellow tone in its lowest register has a strangely cooling effect on the hot midtempo groove the band generates.\n\nFela's lyric is one of his many anti-colonial ruminations decrying Africans' adoption of Western cultural norms. \"I no be gentleman at all,\" he sings, ridiculing Europeans' concept of social class, \"I be Africa man original.\" To drive home the point, the album cover features an ape in a three-piece suit.\n\n310. Manu Dibango: \"African Battle\" [Cameroon, 1973 or 74]\n\nAvailable on AfricaFunk: The Original Sound of 1970s Funky Africa [Harmless], Uncle Junior's Friday Fish Fry, mix by DJ Djinji Brown [Uncle Junior] and Afro-Funk Explosion: Motherload From the Motherland [Explosive Entertainment]\n\nYou can't get much more upbeat than this tune from Cameroon's greatest star. An instrumental featuring a massive horn arrangement and a cliff-diving bassline, \"African Battle\" features trumpets blaring at the top of their range and Dibango's own flashy sax work as well as an army of conga players. It's over in less than three minutes, but what a ride.\n\n__311. Alemayehu Eshete: \"Addis Ababa Bete\" [Ethiopia, 1992]\n\n__Available on Addis Ababa [Shanachie] and The Rough Guide to the Music of Ethiopia [Rough Guides]\n\nEthiopia's Swinging Addis scene came to a sad close in the 70s, but many of its exponents continued on. Alemayehu Eshete was one of Ethiopia's biggest stars and best performers during the golden years of Ethiopian music, but this track from his 1992 album Addis Ababa is crazier than anything he did in his heyday. The song rides a positively evil piano part, with drums functioning merely as a rhythmic guide. The horn section plays a repetitive, tense figure that nags at Eshete's twisting, wildly melismatic vocal part, splitting up at the end into crazed, simultaneous solos. A lot of French prog tried really hard in the 70s to be this frightening, but this beats it all.\n\n__312. Shina Williams & His African Percussionists: \"Agboju Logun\" [12-inch mix] [Nigeria, 1984]\n\n__Available on Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\n\nDoes ZE Records know about this Shina Williams track? Because not only would it fit pretty nicely on any of their Mutant Disco compilations, it would also be the best track. This is actually the 12-inch mix of a 1984 song, and it features former members of Monomono, Africa '70, and Orlando Julius' Afro-Sounders, making it something of a Nigerian super-session. Williams himself was better known as Juju star King Sunny Adé's manager, but the groove here is an irresistible post-disco lockgroove stuffed with muted guitars and breathy female vocals. Talking drums exhale along with sleek horn sections, adding extra funk to what amounts to a killer African New Wave track.\n\nDisc 4\n\n401. Bob Pinado & His Sound Casters: \"Me, You, One [Means I Love You]\" [Ghana, 1976]\n\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz 2: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\n\"Me, you, one, baby, means I love you,\" sings Pinado, and it doesn't get much more straightforward than that. The song has a chilled, subtly funky groove that blows up when he gets to the huge refrain. Pinado had a powerful, distinctive voice, and he uses every bit of that power on this track.\n\n__402. Koola Lobitos: \"Highlife Time\" [Nigeria, 1965]\n\n__Available on Koola Lobitos/The '69 LA Sessions [Knitting Factory]\n\nBeing familiar with his later material, it's almost amusing to hear Fela singing, \"I jump for joy in the swinging club,\" but, then why wouldn't he jump for joy? It is highlife time after all. Fela hadn't yet been introduced to black radicalism, nor been disillusioned by the Biafran War, a brutal conflict that nearly tore his country to shreds, and it's fascinating to hear how exuberant he was on this formative material, when the post-colonial promise still hung in the air and highlife still ruled in West Africa.\n\n__403. 3rd Generation Band: \"Because of Money\" [Ghana, 1973]\n\n__Available on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\nThe 3rd Generation Band's \"Because of Money\" is extremely blunt in its criticism of monetary greed-- a few minutes in, the singer announces \"I am gonna' speak English now/ For the benefit of everybody.\" And then he launches into a diatribe about money's corrupting influence. This is a killer Afrobeat track laid over a bed of hypnotic percussion, but this band was actually a highlife group affiliated with the Ghanaian army! Even if they were [ironically] just cashing in on Fela's massive popularity, they did a damn good job of it.\n\n__404. Mercury Dance Band: \"Envy No Good\" [country, year unknown]\n\n__Available on Afro-Rock, Vol. 1 [Evolver]\n\nMuch like the track that precedes it on this disc, \"Envy No Good\" is a highlife orchestras stab at Afrobeat, undertaken after the band took in a concert by Fela and the Africa '70. \"Envy No Good\" is naturally a pidgin English bit of stern moralizing, very common in the genre, but this song is all about the thick, crashing horn arrangement, a positively gargantuan orchestration that saturates the tape when it comes in.\n\n__405. Mahmoud Ahmed: \"Mar Teb Yelal Kafesh\" [Ethiopia, 1975]\n\n__Available on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\n\n\"Mar Teb Yelal Kafesh\" is Ethiopian funk-pop at its best-- skillfully composed, catchy as hell, and brilliantly arranged. The horns emphasize the offbeats in the A section, offer a countermelody in the B, and crash the gates in the rumbling transitions between sections. The arrangement makes skillful use of rhythmic variation and modulation to make each verse feel more exultant than the last, and Ahmed's voice is more than up to the task, ornamenting the honey-sweet melody with that characteristic Ethiopian melisma.\n\n406. E.T. Mensah & His Tempos Band: \"205\" [Ghana, late 1950s]\n\nAvailable on Day By Day [Retro Afric]\n\nE.T. Mensah was the king of highlife, and songs like \"205\" make it clear why. He's singing in Twi, one of about a dozen languages in which he recorded, but it sounds utterly effortless, and the horn arrangement is a bouncy, fruity thing that bounds along on a peppy Caribbean/jazz beat complete with a swinging bassline.\n\n__407. Bembeya Jazz National: \"N'Gamokoro\" [Guinea, 1973]\n\n__Available on The Syliphone Years [Sterns Africa]\n\nBembeya get funky, and the result is a 10-minute odyssey through a sort of alternative reality Afrobeat world, with plenty of solo trading and a mind-bending guitar part from Sekou Diabate, a part that cycles over and over like a spinning wheel, leaping off into flights of melodic fancy with seemingly no effort.\n\n408. Tamrat Ferendji & Sensation Band: \"Antchin Yagegnulet\" [Ethiopia, 1977]\n\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 13: Ethiopian Groove [Buda Musique]\n\nThis is one of a handful of Kaifa Records recordings to see release in Ethiopia's early derg period, an era of horrible repression by Mengistu's communist government. The song rides a pounding, four-on-the-floor beat topped with fluttering organ and a swaying horn section, culminating in a rare, excellent flute solo. Ferendji's vocal style doesn't go as frequently to the billowing melisma of many of his colleagues, something that may make it easier for a lot of Westerners to dig his stuff straight off.\n\n__409. Matata: \"Wanna Do My Thing\" [Kenya, early 70s]\n\n__Available on Afro-Funk Explosion: Motherload From the Motherland [Explosive Entertainment]\n\nAnother burning chunk of nasty funk from the Kenyan masters, this one catchier and poppier than \"Talkin' Talkin'\". It's still got a hard horn arrangement, dirty groove, and completely unhinged lead vocal, though, and you've got to think James Brown would have been proud to call this one his own.\n\n410. Lekan Animashaun: \"Serere\" [Nigeria, recorded 1979, overdubs 1986, released 1995]\n\nAvailable on the split release Lekan Animashaun: Low Profile/Mr. Big Mouth: Tunde Williams Plays with Africa '70 [Honest Jon's]\n\nBaritone saxophonist Lekan Animashaun was Fela's most loyal sideman, providing the crunching low-end for every one of Fela's bands, from Koola Lobitos to Egypt 80, which is now fronted by Fela's son Seun. His only album under his own name has a convoluted history: Composed in the mid-70s, it was partially recorded during the turbulent days at the end of the decade, after the Africa '70 had dissolved and Fela had set about gathering the musicians for Egypt 80.\n\nRecording was finished in 1986, but Fela served an extended prison term on trumped-up currency charges in the mid-80s, and Low Profile was finally released in 1995, though it promptly went out of print. Thankfully, Honest Jon's has brought it back, and \"Serere\" is the truly stunning track from side two. The horn arrangement is bold and dramatic, featuring call and response phrases that Fela then imitates on his Rhodes piano. \"If you want to get justice/ You must practice justice,\" he sings, and it's clear that Fela's musicians shared more than just musical direction with him.\n\n411. Dick Khoza: \"Chapita\" [South Africa, 1976]\n\nAvailable on Afrika Underground: Jazz, Funk & Fusion Under Apartheid [Counterpoint] and Afro-Funk Explosion: Motherload From the Motherland [Explosive Entertainment]\n\n\"Chapita\" features a pretty nasty beat for a South African funk track, and the contrast with the smooth sax lick is welcome. Khoza's vocal is a weird, baritone drawl, and he talks more than he sings, backed by a long, drawn-out recitation of the title by his backing singers. The instrumental bridges are nice crawling funk workouts, but it's the unexpected harmony vocals that deliver a totally new verse nearly five minutes in that complete the song.\n\n412. Tesfa Maryam Kidane: \"Yetesfa Tezeta\" [Ethiopia, 1969]\n\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\n\nThis instrumental is sort of an Ethiopian spin on the blues-based instrumentals of early rock'n'roll. Frequently, those early instrumentals are just the band playing the blues progression and maybe soloing a bit over it. If you think about it, that's all \"Wipe Out\" is. This adds a bit of funk to that equation, but otherwise, it's a big band playing round with a blues progression and evidently having a lot of fun doing it. Kidane was a well-traveled session saxophonist in Ethiopia, but he actually takes a shorter solo than the guitarist, perhaps not wanting to show off too much.\n\n413. Mulatu Astatque: \"Kasalefkut Hulu\" [Ethiopia, 1972]\n\nAvailable of Éthiopiques 4: Ethio Jazz & Instrumentals [Buda Musique]\n\nMulatu Astatque's instrumental music has a sound all its own-- dark but undeniably funky. This one rides a buoyant, repetitive bass line, layering tightly scored horns on top of it, and the effect is like Duke Ellington dropping in on an Addis Ababa nightclub with an armful of charts.\n\n__414. Kokolo: \"Mister Sinister\" [United States, 2004]\n\n__Available on More Consideration [Ray Lugo], ASAP: Afrobeat Sudan Aid Project [Mobida Productions]\n\nThe lead vocals don't really convince me, but they're passable, and the backing vocals are spot-on, along with everything else about this track. The New York-based Afrobeat revival is full of musicians who obviously have listened to every detail of every Fela record they could get their hands on, and \"Mister Sinister\" rides a galloping beat with an elastic horn arrangement, grounded by a truly righteous baritone sax part.\n\n415. Tlahoun Gessesse: \"Aykedashem Lebe\" [Ethiopia, 1974]\n\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 17: Tlahoun Gessesse [Buda Musique]\n\nGessesse really cuts loose on this song, an uptempo Ethio-funk banger that answers his falsetto howls with stabbing horns and tweaked-out organ interjections. The drum break is low in the mix, as usual with Ethiopian recordings, but it's a hell of a beat, and together with the scratchy rhythm guitar, it's a concrete-solid groove.\n\nDisc 5\n\n501. Manu Dibango: \"Soul Makossa\" [Cameroon, 1972]\n\nAvailable on dozens of releases, including Dibango: Soul Makossa [Unidisc], Africadelic: The Best of Manu Dibango [Mercury], Anthology [Eagle], Very Best of Manu Dibango: AfroSoulJazz [Manteca] and various artists compilations such as Essential Afrobeat: The Very Best of Afrobeat 3CD Mix [Family Recordings], Get Down Tonight: The Disco Explosion [Shout! Factory], The Beginner's Guide to World Music, Vol. 2 [Nascente] and Crooklyn, Vol. 2 [MCA]\n\nWith its nasty, fractured sax line, thumping beat, and tight rhythm, \"Soul Makossa\" was a decent-sized hit in the U.S.-- a rarity for an African artist-- and still gets a spin now and then in the clubs of New York. Afrika Bambaataa covered it and sampled it on his last record, and it's truly a classic slice of funk. Mostly instrumental, it nevertheless features the infectious \"mama-ko mama-sa mako-makossa\" chant, and it still sounds fantastic all these years later.\n\n502. Ebo Taylor: \"Heaven\" [Ghana, 1977]\n\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\n\"Heaven\" is the most weightless funk track I know, sounding almost as though it's floating up to its titular destination. The emphasis is all on the upbeats, with congas and cowbell bobbing in a current of electric organ. Taylor's guitar is placed low in the mix, with opposing parts playing in the left and right channels, one a squelchy, wah'd-out funk part, the other a clean-toned, highlife-ish part. In fact, Taylor's four albums are all split between popular highlife fare on side one and his totally unique brand of Afrobeat on side two. This track features a percussive horn attack and some great call-and-response vocals-- they're so tight that the backing vocals almost sound like chorused delay at times.\n\n503. Hugh Masekela & the Union of South Africa: \"Dyambo\" [South Africa, 1971]\n\nAvailable on Club Africa 2 [Strut] and Hugh Masekela & the Union of South Africa [reissued Motown]\n\nI'm a little unclear on when exactly this song was first released, but it had to be the 70s, because funk hasn't sounded this good in any other decade. The South African ex-pat's fluent trumpet playing is a highlight, and the band offers a propulsive funk backing for Masekela's always-melodic flights. The vocals are taken in a loose group-- not so much harmony as a big sing-a-long, and by the end of the jam that swallows the middle of the song, they're subsumed into the mix in such a way that they become another part of the texture.\n\n504. Sweet Talks: \"Kye Kye Pe Aware\" [Ghana, 1976]\n\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz 2: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\nThe Sweet Talks' Kusum Beat album deserves a reissue to itself, because the two tracks I've heard are jaw-dropping. The band's rhythmic attack in the 70s was sick-- their drummer was a breakbeat maniac, and they augmented it with a ton of traditional percussion, slathering huge, sinewy electric organ on top. A.B. Crentsil's vocals slide coolly into the rhythmic sluice of the music, and the band loved to just lay back and vamp on these killer grooves they created.\n\n505. Rob: \"Make it Fast, Make it Slow\" [Ghana, 1977]\n\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\nRob is apparently a pastor now, and I have to wonder what he thinks about his obscene vocal performance on this humid, trunk-rattling slow jam. His heavy breathing, punctuated by thrusting horns, leaves no ambiguity as to the meaning of \"Make it Fast, Make it Slow\". Its rhythm is so measured and languid that the bass, snare, and organ virtually take turns at emphasizing different beats. Something makes me bet that this is the only 70s Ghanaian sex jam you're ever likely to hear, but that's what the repeat button is for.\n\n__506. William Onyeabor: \"Better Change Your Mind\" [Nigeria, 1978]\n\n__Available on World Psychedelic Classics 3: Love's a Real Thing, the Funky Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa [Luaka Bop] and Nigeria 70: the Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\n\nThe title of this song isn't about reversing a decision-- as Onyeabor makes clear through his lyrics, which admonish various world powers about their arrogance-- it's about changing the way we think about the world. The chunky beat marinates in a heavy sauce of trebly synthesizer, and the guitar has a truly odd, chorused tone that makes me wonder if it's actually two guitars playing roughly in sync with each other.\n\n507. Bahta Gebre Heywet: \"Tessassategn Eko\" [Ethiopia, 1973]\n\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\n\nThis is an exceptionally breezy Ethiopian pop song, with a doggedly consonant horn arrangement and a laid-back vocal by Heywet. Most Ethiopian songs can't be casually hummed, but this one flows easily from the back of the throat at odd times of the day. The solo trumpet melody blows in on the quickly shuffling beat like a lazy summer day, a reminder that funk doesn't have to be all nasty.\n\n508. Ayalew Mesfin & Black Lion Band: \"Gud Aderegetchegn\" [Ethiopia, 1977]\n\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 13: Ethiopian Groove [Buda Musique]\n\nBlack Lion Band were a powerhouse rhythm band, and this song rampages on a swaying guitar riff and driving bass drums while Mesfin's vocal melody plays directly against the groove. The song has a totally unstoppable chorus, with Mesfin singing the title over and over, syncopating it differently each time. For a scene that was being strangled to death in 1977, Addis managed quite a few interesting recordings, and this is one of the best.\n\n509. Sahara All Stars Band Jos: \"Enjoy Yourself\" [Nigeria, year unknown]\n\nAvailable on Nigeria 70: the Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\n\nSahara All Stars, based in the northern Nigerian City of Jos, essentially ran Nigeria's Hausa funk scene and were its greatest exponent. The beat is spare and spacious, with a lacerating guitar part and a steady drum-and-conga break joined by an almost incongruously soft Rhodes piano. The lyrics are in pidgin English, and feature heavy use of the word \"quench,\" which in the dialect is directly akin to \"die.\"\n\nPidgin English is a fascinating evolution of language, and it's interesting to hear how the grammatical structure of sentences differs from what we're used to, not to mention the use of separate, unconjugated \"go\" verbs placed before other verbs. Anyway, \"Enjoy Yourself\" warns listeners to get as much out of life as possible before the inevitable strikes, and then helps them do it.\n\n510. Christy Azuma & Uppers International: \"Naam\" [Ghana, 1976]\n\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz 2: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\nFemale stars are very rare in Afrobeat, and it would actually be kind of hard to call Christy Azuma a star-- her records weren't even released in her own home country of Ghana, as the Ghanaian Hausa community they were aimed at was generally too poor to own record players. She sings in a traditional head voice as the Uppers thrash along behind her with a tight, percolating funk rhythm, and if the rest of Ghana didn't want to listen, well, it was their loss.\n\n__511. Mahmoud Ahmed: \"Kulun Mankwalesh\" [Ethiopia, 1973]\n\n__Available on Almaz [Ahma] and Éthiopiques 6: Almaz [Buda Musique]\n\n\"Kulun Mankwalesh\" is actually a traditional wedding song that received numerous intriguing interpretations by various constituents of Swinging Addis. This one is from Almaz, Mahmoud Ahmed's first of an unequaled (in Ethiopia) four albums. The record has an interesting suite-like structure where the songs flow easily into one another, and all are brimming with wah-drenched guitar and psychedelic flourishes of flute and organ. Ahmed's second album, 1975's Ere Mela Mela, became the first Ethiopian record distributed outside of the country when it was finally issued in Europe in 1986, bringing the first glimpse of Swinging Addis to an unsuspecting world.\n\n512. Alemayehu Eshete: \"Eskegizew Bertchi\" [Ethiopia, 1974]\n\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\n\n\"Eskegizew Bertchi\" is a funky, horn-fueled rock tune that Eshete has his way with, splattering his wild vocals all over it. It's a shame Ethiopia has become a Sally Struthers grotesque in the minds of so many Westerners, as it's a deeply complex nation and hardly the repository for starvation that most people associate it so closely with. Part of the joy of getting into the music and exploring the varied work of a guy like Eshete-- who was also a session bassist and a decent guitarist-- is getting inside the mind of someone from a country whose population you're not expected to identify with. You think Ethiopia's just a miserable den of anonymous poverty where photographers go to win their Pulitzers? Well, here's a song about a guy in love. Suddenly we're closer than we seemed.\n\n513. Salif Keita: \"Mandjou\" [Mali, 1978]\n\nAvailable on Salif Keita: the Best of the Early Years [Wrasse], 1969-1980 [Sonodisc], Best of Salif Keita, the Golden Voice [Wrasse]\n\nKeita is often referred to as the Golden Voice of Mali, and he does have a pretty impressive set of pipes. He's descended from royal lineage but was born albino, considered a sign of bad luck in Mali, and found himself left outside of the trappings of privileged life. He gravitated to music and wound up as a regular in Super Rail Band de Bamako, Mali's greatest band in the early 70s. He cut \"Mandjou\" with his second band, Les Ambassadeurs Internationale, in 1978, and it's an acknowledged classic of African music, riding a subtly funky groove and some beautiful lead guitar work. The horn arrangement is deeply Cuban, which puts it in a strange light next to Keita's instantly recognizable tenor, a voice that sounds as steadfastly Saharan as possible. Frankly, I haven't liked a thing Keita has done since Les Ambassadeurs-- it's got that drum machine/Kawai preset Afro-pop sound that I can't stand-- but his work in the 70s is powerful stuff, all the better for its raggedness.\n\n514. Assagai: \"Cocoa\" [South Africa, 1971]\n\nAvailable on Afro-Funk Explosion: Motherload From the Motherland [Explosive Entertainment] and Assagai [Vertigo]\n\nAssagai are named for a spear generally associated with the Zulu militaries of the early colonial era, but their sound is a bit more relaxed than the name would have you believe. The horn arrangements are slow and slurred, the vocals just as slow and perhaps as slurred-- I can't tell because I don't know what language they're in. They called their music Afro-rock and even released an album under that title, but to my ears, this is slow-motion funk with an unusual piano underpinning, and it's a good comedown from some of their more frenetic colleagues.\n\nDisc 6\n\n601. Lourdes Van Dunem: \"Ngongo ya Biluka\" [Angola, 1972]\n\nAvailable on Angola 70s: 1972-1973 [Buda Musique]\n\nWomen in the Western music industry certainly have it tougher than men, but at least we accept the very thought of an independent female performer. It wasn't like that when Lourdes Van Dunem began her singing career in Angola, then still under Portuguese rule (as it would be until 1975). And it didn't get any easier-- she was imprisoned for a time by the colonial government, and if the music industries in countries like Benin and Cote d'Ivoire were underprivileged, then Angola's was outright deprived. Still, there are lots of interesting recordings of the country's signature semba music (a quick-paced variant on Brazil's samba) and this is a personal favorite. The rhythms are tight, the melody is infectious, and there's even some mildly inventive lead guitar around the edges, the only sound covered in reverb on an otherwise utterly dry recording.\n\n602. Guerilla: \"La Popo\" [country, year unknown]\n\nAvailable on The Danque!! [Afrodisiac]\n\nThis intro is just to die for-- two minutes of careening rhythms and frenzied but melodic organ that exude cool. The rest of the song is almost a different beast entirely, carrying over only the intro's disco hi-hat. The vocals are so rough they occasionally sound like a roar, and the guitar solos are interested in melody only insofar as it can lead to a freak-out. It's too bad the intro never reprises, but this is still a sweet piece of rock-tinged funk.\n\n603. Peter King: \"Mystery Tour\" [Nigeria, 1976]\n\nAvailable on Shango [AfroStrut]\n\nPeter King was a highly educated musician, and today he runs a music school in his native Nigeria. He has songs that I almost think were held back by his extensive schooling, which may have caused him to "
