        "text": "Tesco shopper? You've got two weeks left to spend £14 million of expiring Clubcard vouchers – or extend them with our trick\n\nIf you've got a Tesco Clubcard, check if you have any vouchers close to expiring, as £14 million-worth are due to run out on Saturday 31 August. Don't want to spend your vouchers yet? We've got a trick to extend their validity.\n\neBay to stop accepting American Express from today – be careful if you're planning to use PayPal as a workaround\n\nOnline marketplace eBay will stop accepting American Express ('Amex') cards as a direct payment method from today (Saturday 17 August). You'll still be able to use your Amex on eBay by going through PayPal – but be wary of doing this with large purchases, as you may lose valuable Section 75 protection.\n\nInflation-linked broadband, mobile and TV price hikes to be banned from next year\n\nBroadband, mobile and pay TV firms will no longer be able to hit customers with inflation-linked price hikes mid-contract from January 2025, regulator Ofcom has confirmed. But, as MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE) founder Martin Lewis has warned, the new rules will still allow for above-inflation price rises.\n\nMartin Lewis: Confused by the difference between the 'two-child benefit cap' and limits on Child Benefit? An explainer\n\nConfused about the 'two-child benefit cap' and what it really means? MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis has a quick and simple video briefing to clear up some of the misinformation. It takes you through Child Benefit rules, the two-child limit for Universal Credit and the benefits cap.\n\nBuy now, pay later regulation confirmed by new Government – but timeline remains unclear\n\nRegulation of the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector WILL go ahead, the new Government has confirmed. It means consumers will finally get much-needed safeguards on BNPL purchases, as well as protection from unsustainable borrowing – something MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE) and its founder Martin Lewis have long campaigned for. Though we still don't know when any new rules will take force.\n\nMartin Lewis: The Chancellor is restricting Winter Fuel Payment to just those on benefits – that’s too narrow a group\n\nWinter Fuel Payments – a tax-free payment made to all pensioners to help with winter energy bills – are to be restricted to those on benefits and Pension Credit, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced. But MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis has urged the Government to include a wider group, and to leave no stone unturned ensuring the 800,000 eligible who miss out on Pension Credit get it.\n\nCarer's Allowance overhaul urgently needed to prevent 1,000s being chased for overpayments, says charity\n\nDemands to repay Carer's Allowance overpayments are having a \"shocking\" impact on unpaid carers' lives, according to a new report from Carers UK. The charity has called for urgent action to prevent carers from unwittingly building up huge debts – an issue MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE) founder Martin Lewis has also raised with the Government.\n\nMartin Lewis: Can online retailers refuse returns? Your rights explained\n\nCan online retailers refuse returns, particularly if they decide you've made too many in the past? MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis answers this question, and talks you through your rights, in a recent episode of the BBC's The Martin Lewis Podcast.\n\nRoyal Mail launches 'fake stamp scanner' – here's how it works\n\nRoyal Mail has introduced a 'fake stamp scanner' that enables you to check whether a stamp is legitimate or not. It will also continue to waive its £5 penalty fee charged to anyone who receives a letter with a fake stamp on it for the time being."
