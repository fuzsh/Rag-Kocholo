        "text": "Leeds world music promoter Lubi Jovanovic (DJ Lubi Presents) has brought some amazing African and Latin/Cuban/Salsa music artists to the city over the years, both from the continent and the diaspora. He's promoted/co-promoted African shows by Santrofi (Ghana), Kokoroko (UK), KOG (UK), Jembaa Groove (Berlin), Femi Kuti (Nigeria), ONIPA (UK), London Afrobeat Collective (UK), Newen Afrobeat (Chile) and Dele Sosimi (UK). On the salsa side, he's featured Leeds concerts by legends such as Eddie Palmieri, Tito Allen, Joe Bataan, Charanga Habanera, Wayne Gorbea, Alfredo de la Fe, Grupo Sierra Maestra, Asere, Issac Delgado to name a few.\n\nFor his big world music Christmas party this year, he brings these two musical loves together for an Afro-Salsa Xmas special with London Congolese music stars Grupo Lokito joined onstage by Leeds salsa/mambo band Los Camaradas.\n\nGrupo Lokito brings together Congolese, Kenyan, Latin American (Cuban, Colombian, Venezuelan) and UK musicians who blend Central African soukous and highlife with Cuban son music and salsa. They formed in 2006 when top salsa/Cuban music pianist Sara McGuinness (Salsa y Ache/Orquesta Estelar/Sarabanda) began researching the cultural and musical links between the two countries and wanted to feature an ensemble that could play a fusion of these musical styles. And so Grupo Lokito was born.\n\nTheir debut album “Esengo Ya Ko Bina” (The Joy of Dancing) was released in 2010 and they have had tracks featured on compilation albums “The Rough Guide To African Street Party “on the World Music Network (2008), \"Urban Africa\" on Cavendish Music (2010), and \"Latin Beat\" on Putumayo Records (2011). In 2023, they released their latest album \"Bomoko\", both digitally and on vinyl.\n\nGrupo Lokito features some of the finest African and Latin American musicians in the capital. These include Congolese vocalists/front men Eugene Makuta and Iddo Donnatella, Kenyan rising star lead guitarist Shama Shah, Congolese veteran rhythm guitarist Ladi Mbala and a rock solid Latin rhythm section of Ernesto Marichales (drums - Venezuela), Jimmy Martinez (bass - Cuba) and Emeris Solis (congas - Colombia). At the heart of the band is the musical director/bandleader and pianist Sara McGuinnes.\n\nSince their formation in 2006 the band have gone from strength to strength, completing several UK tours, appearing at all the best UK world music festivals and building a solid following across the country. They've only ever played Leeds once before - Vamos Leeds Festival 2018 in Millenium Square - when they closed the festival and had 3000 people dancing joyously in the hot Yorkshire summer night. It's great to have Grupo Lokito back in Leeds for the first time in 6 years and making their Brudenell Social Club debut. If you love the music of Central and West Africa alongside the sounds and rhythms of Cuba, this is a \"must attend\" show.\n\nHere's a few testimonials from 2023 :\n\n'Bomoko is a highly accomplished album that gives a great indication of Grupo Lokito’s joyous live performance' - Martin Sinnock, Songlines Magazine, April 2023\n\n‘We were delighted to welcome Grupo Lokito to our festival in 2023. Not only are the band supremely talented with a perfect sound for our event, but their strong ties to the Congolese community in the UK meant we were able to cater to an audience that we may otherwise not have reached. We look forward to working with them again in the future.’ - Africa Oyé Festival, Liverpool, June 2023\n\n‘This is the fourth time we have booked Grupo Lokito and the professionalism and the performance were world class.’ – Focus Africa 10th Anniversary Show, July 2023\n\nLos Camaradas is a community salsa band based in Leeds with players from across Yorkshire from a variety of different nationalities. Their musical backgrounds are Latin American, jazz, folk and world music and they play a repertoire that covers the full range of Latin American music - mainly salsa, Cuban son, mambo, cha cha cha plus a touch of cumbia and merengue. Their repertoire includes salsa classics by the Fania All-Stars, Eddie Palmieri, Hector Lavoe, Willie Colon, Tito Puente and Benny More as well as a couple of their own Yorkshire salsa compositions. One thing is certain. They pack dancefloors every time they play out.\n\nThe current line-up is 15 people, including vocals, trumpet, trombones, flute, clarinet, saxes, bass, piano, timbales and other latin percussion. Their band leader and coach is professional UK salsa trombonist Jonny Enright. His career spans over 30 years playing in bands like La Clave and Grupo X in London, where he backed many salsa legends such as Joe Bataan, Tito Allen, Dave Valentin, Johnny Blas, Frankie Morales, Orlando Watussi and Bobby Matos. Jonny currently leads top UK mambo/salsa ensemble Orchestra Mambo International, whose debut single was championed by the likes of Gilles Peterson, Huey Morgan, Jazz FM and many DJs across the world.\n\nDJ Lubi will be on the decks before and between live sets with a dancefloor friendly mix of salsa and African music, past and present."
