        "text": "IDRISSA DIOP & CHEIKH TIDIANE TALL\n\nDIAMONOYE TIOPITE (Teranga Beat TBCD 013)\n\nI suppose it's part of getting old that you find most new music superficial and derivative and really love reissues and classic material from the period when you were young. I didn't grow up in Africa in the '60s, but I must have had a doppelgänger, and no doubt there is some 60-ish African guy who is into Kinks, Cream and Small Faces as much as I am into Baobab, Balla and Bembeya. Teranga is a label based in Senegal since 2010, and I wish them every success because their aim is to reissue little-known gems from the golden age as well as some newcomers to the West African music scene. Their debut disc features Idrissa Diop and his Sahel band from the period 1969 to 1976, and it is a sure-fire winner. The label is the brainchild of a Greek music lover Adamantios Kafetzis who regularly visits Senegal looking for rare vinyl or neglected artists and their \"lost\" tapes. Obviously it is our duty to support him in this endeavor by buying the discs, and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. In the sixties the predominant sound in Senegal was Cuban, heralded by singer Laba Sosseh and Nigerian saxophonist Dexter Johnson. Kafetzis can attest to this because he notes, modestly, \"Because I have collected almost all the records and cassettes released in Senegal, I have listened to all the musical phases within its development.\" Clearly he knows whereof he speaks. For him the height of the music came in 1975 with three albums: Bamba by Sahel, Bitaa Baane by Le Diamono, and Daida by Xalam. Among them, he asserts, Sahel was the top band. Cheikh Tidiane Tall was chef d'orchestre, known for playing guitar and organ, often simultaneously. Thierno Koité, much later with Orchestra Baobab, is on saxophone. Vocalists included René Cabral, Seydina Wade, and Idrissa Diop. Their major contribution was to bring the sabar & tama drums to the salsa sound thereby creating Mbalax, which grew to dominate Senegalese music in the 1980s. Kafetzis was determined to bring his passion to the larger world and went to Senegal to find Diop. Not only did he find the master tape for the Bamba album, it contained a bunch of great unreleased material. Idy Diop saw what was happening with this enthused Greek and turned over an unreleased 1976 tape of Sahel, half of which is heard here for the first time. There's a kindler gentler mbalax brought to us on the mellow sax of Thierno and the intricate guitar leads of Tidiane Tall, but there's also storming mbalax and also classic Senegalese salsa, including a great cover of Larry Harlow's \"Caridad,\" recorded live in Club Sangomar, far removed from its origins, literally and musically. But after Salsa, Soul music made a huge impact on the whole continent & Idy moved to Paris. Considering these are two-track recordings, done live with two mikes, they are far better than a lot of Senegalese stuff I've heard that was taken from sandy cassettes.\n\nGUELEWAR\n\nHSLLELI N'DAKAROU (Teranga Beat PTB CD014)\n\nGuelewar, from Banjul in The Gambia, is one of those legendary West African bands that people may have heard of, or heard one or two tracks from thanks to the internet. Now for the first time, here is a whole CD dedicated to this wonderful music. Guelewar was the experimental rock band of their era, using the mini Moog synthesizer to add psychedelic washes of spacey effects to their organ and guitar sound. This CD presents a live show, captured at the Senegalese Canari de Kaolack club in 1982. Periodically the synth and guitars drop out and they take it down to a rock-solid hand percussion groove. Then the other instruments lurch back in behind the singer and the heat builds. With Ifang Bondi, Guelewar was part of the Afro-Manding revival of the late 70s that revitalized traditional Sene-Gambian music (both bands came from Gambia) but were a hit in Senegal also. The fine guitar and bass are courtesy of two brothers: Moussa Mbodji Njie on guitar and Njok Malick Mike Njie who plays his bass like a lead guitar. There are four more brothers in the line-up: Moussa Ngom the lead singer later joined Super Diamono, and Laaye Ngom is effective on keyboards, while Koto Sunu Ngom on sabar and Alive Badara Ngom are two of the three percussionists. There are also a pair of saxophonists: Bas Lo Biram on alto and Laaye Sallah on tenor. One of the defining bands of West African pop from the 70s, in a hot performance, not to be missed.\n\nKARANTAMBA\n\nNDIGAL (Teranga Beat PTB CD015 2012)\n\nI thought I was pretty well informed on the history of Senegambian music but here is another mind-blowing discovery. A previously unreleased, hence completely unknown album from the leader of Guelewar & Ifang Bondi, Bal Janha. If you love those bands, and I know you do, you will be all over this like white on rice (as Tina Turner would say). Bal came from Gambia and brought Psychedelic rock to the mbalax sound of Dakar. The resulting soul and funk stew supplanted the Cuban sound and led to the dominance of Afro-Manding pop music throughout West Africa for more than a decade. Karantamba was a band he created that became a fertile school for younger musicians in Dakar. This recording was made at the famed Sangomar night club in 1984. The vinyl release has a bonus track (for once) while the 9 cuts on the CD deliver an hour and twenty minutes of pure bluesy, soulful, steaming bliss. The sound is sharp, especially when the \"African\" trumpets come in, but you get used to that. I thought such trumpets were off-key until I was at a Bembeya Jazz concert with an African friend and when the trumpets started playing he nudged me and said, Now, that's the sound of African horns! Track five, \"Titi,\" changes the mood as it is a highlife number, but it's all good & they go back to the Senegambian rave-up. The last track, \"Gamo Jigimar,\" is an outstanding 12 minutes of musical bliss.\n\nROYAL BAND DE THIES\n\nKADIOR DEMB (Teranga Beat 2012)\n\nYou just know this is gonna be fantastic, right? Royal Band are one of those late-70s, early-80s Senegalese bands that took the old rhythms and cut loose on them with a new energetic sound known as mbalax. Up to now, Royal Band de Thiès was only known in a few cuts on the excellent pair of CDs from Dakar Sound: Their Thing and Latin Thing. I have a copy of their album Dioubou — volume 1 from 1980, from which those four tracks were lifted, and it smokes from start to finish. The early eighties was the era of the Etoiles — Youssou's Super Etoile and Al-Hadji Faye's Etoile 2000 — but we cannot discount other contenders. In 2002 Ted Jaspers issued the Meanwhile in Thiès... CD (Dakar Sound vol 9), which had 6 more tracks from the Royals. Kadior Demb is a set of 11 previously unreleased tracks, now presented in sonic high-fidelity. Once more Teranga's GM Adamantios Kafetzis is on the case. He went to Thiès, a sleepy little backwater that was once an important railhead connecting Dakar to the rest of West Africa, in 2004. He wandered into a nightclub and there singing was Adema Secka, the vocalist who had laid these tracks down 30 years earlier. Kafetzis discovered there were three unreleased albums by the band and also met Mapathe \"James\" Gadiaga, the other vocalist (also of Super Cayor) who had made a career as a West African salsero. After founding Royal Band, Gadiaga was in Xalam, then joined Omar Pene and Ishmael Lo in Super Diamono. He went to South Africa and gigged with Johnny Clegg and spent time in Paris before returning home to found Super Cayor in 1994. Günter Gretz heard Super Cayor and turned us on to them in two fabulous issues: Sopenté (pam oa 206, 1997) and Embouteillage (Traffic jam) (pam oa 210, 2002), but Gadiago knew if anyone heard the Royal Band recordings they had made in the Sangomar Club in Thiès back in the 70s they would want to release them. He was not wrong. This is essential music. The horn players Jackie (Zaky) Seck on tenor and alto and Cisco on alto sax have distinct voices, almost as recognizable as the perfectly balanced salsero and griot lead vocalists! The line-up differs from the large band listed on Meanwhile, where Issa Diasse is credited with the brilliant guitar solos, Ousseynou Yade on tama, and Aly Penda's trumpet; here we have Racine Aw on lead guitar, and Alioune Mbodjet on tumba (& I presume, sabar) to add the finishing touches to the perfect outing.\n\nMAR SECK\n\nVAGABONDE (Teranga Beat CD [or 2 LP] TBCD018)\n\nIt is wonderful news that Adamantios Kafetzis of Teranga Beat is continuing to unearth great previously unreleased recordings by West African artists and present them, fully restored, to our ears. His latest foray spotlights the songwriter/singer Mar Seck who, alongside Pape Seck, fronted the Star Band de Dakar and mentored the young Youssou Ndour. Mar Seck also led Number One de Dakar and you have doubtless come across him on some compilations and less-than-ideal reissues/bootlegs of those bands. I often wonder how people listen to music and why they listen to old music repeatedly. I am not thinking of folks that only have a Beatles and a Beach Boys album in their collection, but the outpouring of facebook gush when someone like Lou Reed dies. Suddenly we get far too much information in a big rush and I get the impression that a lot of \"friends\" secretly listen to the same stuff over and over. Are they trying to recapture a lost moment? There's also that sense of silly one-upmanship of the \"I was into Velvet Underground before they were cool\" types. I listened to Transformer enough at the time (on the radio) that I never need to hear it again, so people who seek out live recordings and bootlegs must be looking for something. Hearing old Senegalese music, however, creates in me a kind of false memory, I admit. So it's also a nostalgia for something that can never be recaptured because it was never lost. I never made it to those fabled Dakar nightclubs but I do have wonderful memories of laying in my hammock listening to Baobab's Pirate's Choice over and over. The djembe and sabar (\"talking drums\") and sax and the scratchy Cuba-meets-mbalax sound wraps me in its musical womb. The subtitle of this disc is From Super Cap-Vert to Number One: Unreleased Recordings 1969-80. Teranga found master tapes from three sessions and cherry picked them to present here. The 1969 session was made at the national radio station in Dakar and is pretty raw and ready. The bass is out of tune: not that this is a problem. They do a Compay Segundo song to open. Seck was 18 at the time and his band was called Super Cap-Vert, because Dakar was originally called Cabo Verde by the Portuguese and the islands off its coast became the isles of Cabo Verde. Curiously their second song, \"Sibouten,\" could be Cabo Verdean. The title song \"Vagabonde\" is a Cuban bolero, sung in comprehensible Spanish. One night the legendary Star Band came to play their little provincial port town, Rufisque, and his friends encouraged Seck to get onstage and sing, since he knew their repertoire. Medoune Diallo was so impressed he offered him a gig with the band. From 1973 comes a soundboard recording made at the Miami Club with the Star Band de Dakar. There's a coro and the guitarists are more polished, though the bassist is still flat (he must have owned the car!). I was thrilled to hear \"Taba yo simo,\" which is familiar from African Fiesta's repertoire, under the name, \"Tabalissimo,\" sung by Rochereau in 1964, as well as a track from Oscar Calle covered by Nico and Rochereau as \"Calaboso.\" Mar Seck admits to a passion for Congolese rumba. In Star Band Mar joined Rudy Gomis, Issa Cissokho, Balla Sidibe, Medoune Diallo and Barthelemy Atisso who would later achieve fame as Orchestre Baobab, as well as trumpeter Ali Penda Ndoye. When the core left to form Baobab, Mar brought in his old friends, including Yahya Fall on lead guitar and vocalist Maguette Ndiaye, to swell the ranks and young Youssou Ndour joined the band as Mar's apprentice for two years. The last two tracks come from Number One de Dakar, another splinter group that was formed after a fight with the owner of Miami over pay when Maguette and Yahya left. Just as Star Band had been the top band in Dakar in the 1970s, Number One went on to be the top attraction in Dakar throughout the 80s and three of their CDs have been released by Dakar Sound and Popular African Music. This is a great hour of Mar Seck's raspy voice and his salsa-mbalax sound. If you are not collecting ALL of Teranga Beat's issues you'd better catch up.\n\nDEXTER JOHNSON & LE SUPER STAR DE DAKAR\n\nLIVE A L'ETOILE (Teranga Beat 2014)\n\nTeranga set out to bring us great unknown & obscure Senegalese music and quickly moved to the realms of the fantastic: issuing CDs of brilliant, previously unreleased Senegalese music. Clean, clear and an hour and 17 minutes long, this concert showcases the brilliant tenor saxophonist who fronted L'Etoile de Dakar, the mother of all groups that gave rise to so many of the popular bands from Senegal in the 1970s and 80s. Johnson toots his tenor alongside three singers, John Gomis and William and Maīssa Ngom who replaced the departed Laba Sosseh. The repertoire is Afro-Cuban, so there are chestnuts, \"Coco Mai Mai,\" pops up as the chorus in \"Para que bueno\"; we get \"Mayeya (no juege con los Santos)\" and \"Soy hijo del Siboney,\" sandwiched around \"Something you got\" — a wicked Wilson Pickett rave-up. There's no piano or trumpet and a much more laid-back approach to clave than you find in any Cuban music. The band is relaxed, the guitarists having a good time, Dexter chomping at the mouthpiece waiting to get back on top of the mike with a hot solo. He threatens to leave the singers behind with his flights of fancy, but the coro gives as good as it gets. It's a very well run show, though you get the feeling the recording is picking up mainly the vocal mikes so the two guitars are in the back of the room, but that's not a problem since the reverse is usually the case. Here you can hear the guiro, timbales and congas clearly and there's a fair bit of echo on the other instruments suggesting their sound is coming from amps, bouncing off the walls and then coming through the vocal mikes. This show was recorded in 1969 on the eve of the band's departure for a tour to Abidjan, Ivory Coast (hot on the trail of Laba Sosseh who had taken some of the band and gone to Abidjan ahead of them), so they are certain of their chops, even throwing down a couple of boogaloos among the guaguancos. Dexter was born in Nigeria and had traveled and played in many countries before joining the first Star Band in Senegal in 1957. His playing is grounded in Hi-Life and closer to lyrical American jazz than to the brusque honking of Manu Dibango — you can also hear how he influenced Issa Cissokho of Orchestre Baobab, in fact you will hear how the Baobab sound comes directly out of this Star Band sound. He is a powerful presence on these recordings, with a reformed group featuring three singers vying to replace Laba, and some hot young percussionists taking up the challenge also. Confidently commanding all is Dexter weaving that old black magic.\n\nDIEUF-DIEUL DE THIES\n\nAW SA YONE VOL 1 (Teranga Beat 2013)\n\nAfro-Manding jazz, what does that conjure up? Senegalese jamb kickers? Now we're getting somewhere. I am beyond having my mind blown by the Teranga Beat label, now I just pick my jaw off the floor, hook it around my ears again, and put the CD into the player. This latest foray, their fifth, is yet another previously unreleased session featuring a stellar line-up. The Teranga gang have discovered some tapes that were made by Pap' Seck, famous guitarist of the Guelewar band, who also backed Baaba Maal. With him are singers Assane Camara, Bassirou Sarr, and Gora Mbaye. Their traditional melodies succumb to wailing saxophones, psychedelirious guitar and relentless percussion. There are eight tracks, each 9 or 10 minutes long. It's amazing something so creative never saw the light of day until now. The vibe is loose, the four horns (trombone, trumpet and saxes) are in full accord with solid walking bass; rhythmically entwined guitar and organ add layers over the drums: timbales, tama, sabar and congas. In addition to a fine picked lead guitar style, Seck has mastered that clipped fuzztone sustain that was made famous by Robert Fripp on Eno, Bowie & Gabriel sessions. After stints in Guelewar and Royal Band de Thiès, Seck joined Ouza & ses Ouzettes and was instrumental in their hits with Quatre Femmes dans le Vent, but the band members were not happy with Ouza and when Seck decided to leave Dakar and go home to Thiès they wanted to go with him, thus, in 1979 Dieuf-Dieul was formed. Their first recording session was taken to Paris to be turned into an LP but the producer's luggage, including the reel-to-reel tape, was stolen. They made two further 4-track recordings, hoping to sell cassettes and launch a career but the promoters only wanted mbalax and so the group dissolved. This disc presents half of their recordings: the remainder are promised as volume 2. It's vintage but still sounds fresh, even when the chorus launches into \"On verra ça,\" a refrain made famous by Baobab. Noteworthy are the rhythm guitar of Abdoulaye Camara (who also turns on the flanger when Seck is soloing) and the two sax players who add soulful solos. But then, too, the singers are hot and the complex layering of the drummers add so much to the excitement of the project. The group's name \"Dieuf-Dieul\" means something like good karma or good deeds creating ultimate benefits. Though they were only together for three years we are now able to appreciate their exceptional polished talents after 30 years, thanks to Teranga Beat.\n\nDIEUF-DIEUL DE THIES\n\nAW SA YONE VOL 2 (Teranga Beat TBCD 020CD 2015)\n\nI've been revisiting my Senegalese collection since Cheikh Lo's latest release, as well as the Youssou Ndour concert from the 80s that came out last month on RealWorld. Now we have been inundated with great previously unreleased material from the bright days following independence from France in June 1960. From independence, Senegal thrived under Socialism with the visionary poet Léopold Senghor as president. The country never suffered a military coup or tribal wars and became a welcome venue for visiting acts from North America, Cuba and the rest of Africa, so the music scene thrived. Dieuf-Dieul embodied the local bands' ability to take external influences, such as Afro-Cuban and American jazz and psychedelic rock and incorporate them into their mbalax sound. But what's truly remarkable about them is that they were in many ways an urban legend, because they never released any recordings. Everyone from Thiès would say they were the best band ever, but no one had so much as a cassette to back up this claim. This makes their rediscovery by Adamantios Kafetzis of Teranga Beat even more remarkable: he has now given us two full-length albums by this fantastic group comprising all their known recordings. The band came about when a group of disaffected musicians from Ouza & ses Ouzettes (including the phenomenal guitarist Pape Seck) decided to quit (over money) while playing in Thiès and stayed in town to pick up gigs at local nightclubs. They were augmented by local singers and percussionists and combined the best elements of different musical backgrounds, traditional and modern, into a superb hybrid. They met Bassirou Sarr who was trying to get a band together and shared rehearsal space with him: his energy was infectious so they eventually merged the two groups. These tracks are mostly ten to twelve minutes long, with great guitar and sax solos and a warm earthy feel as they unfold into epic jams. The recordings were made live (I am guessing at Sangomar or another nightclub) in 1980 on a Sony four-track multi reel-to-reel recorder and there are also three tracks from an unfinished 1981 session. Bassirou Sarr is the featured singer (he recorded with Africando in 2013) and he pours passion like lighter fluid onto the smoldering rhythm section of talking drums (sabar) and kit drums. Two other vocalists get one song each. In Casamance they met Assane Camara (then known as Camou Tande) and asked him to join the group. He does a Cuban number \"Rumba para parejas,\" and Gora Mbaye (who had the lion's share of Volume 1) lends his strong griot tones to a traditional song in Wolof. In 1982, unable to get a recording deal, they broke up: some members joining Etoile 2000 and later hooking up with Baaba Maal. In 2014 Pape Seck and the vocalists were still alive, so, in Baobab fashion, there were murmurs of a reunion tour.\n\nSENEGAL 70:\n\nSONIC GEMS & PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED RECORDINGS FROM THE 70S (Analog Africa AACD 079CD)\n\nWhen I and my ilk started collecting African music back in the 1980s we never imagined that some treasures, long thought unattainable, would not only be discovered but made available to us. Back in the 1970s while a generation of now legendary bands were performing at the Sangomar nightclub in Dakar, the sound man/owner Moussa Diallo was rolling tape. Adamantios Kafetzis of Teranga Beat, who is devoted to uncovering the great rarities of Senegalese music, transferred these priceless tapes to digital and has identified over 300 songs. Now he has teamed up with Samy Ben Redjeb of Analog Africa to present some of the gems in a compilation called Senegal 70. The mother of many of the bands of the 70s was the Star Band of Dakar, here fronted by Amara Touré (whose legendary 70s recordings came out on Analog Africa earlier this summer), performing the evergreen \"El Carretero\" (again in a version never heard before). From Star Band's ranks other groups emerged: Le Sahel, Orchestre Laye Thiam, No 1 de Dakar, Baobab, Dieuf Dieul de Thiès, and Xalam. And from that panoply Laye Thiam is represented with three (previously released) tracks, including \"Kokorico\" which is pure funk, with blues organ, sung partly in English. Baobab completists will be thrilled to discover two previously unreleased and sublime tracks from them, licensed from founder Thione Seck, captured live at the Sangomar nightclub. There is even room for an odd novelty number, \"Viva Maravillas\" by King N'gom & L'orchestre Perles Noires du Bénin: all I can say is you've probably never heard anything like it before (though at first it calls to mind \"Hit the Road, Jack\"), even if it is a cover of a Cuban original. It's Beninois salsa but flows well within the Senegalese mix. Le Tropical Jazz performing \"Kiko Medina\" is also outstanding. The album is a great mix and flows well. If you are mad at yourself for not getting Escale au Senegal or Panorama du Senegal before they went out of print, you have no excuse not to stock up on Senegalese oldies now.\n\nAll writing on this page Copyright © 2022 by Alastair Johnston.
