        "text": "THE Fourth of July weekend celebrates an ideal of the United States as a fountainhead of democracy and pluralism. It's also a good moment to consider America, and New York City especially, as a mirror and a microcosm of the world beyond its borders, a place to hear echoes of nearly every human culture.\n\nThis is Weekend's fourth annual survey of world-music albums, and it occurs as diametrically opposed forces are at work. One, since Sept. 11, is a sense of separation: fewer people are traveling, and there is a heightened awareness that America is not universally beloved. But the opposite factor -- driven by technology, by capitalism's compulsion to serve every last niche market and by musicians' instinctive urge to borrow anything useful -- is an ever-accelerating interchange of musical ideas.\n\nIn recent years club disc jockeys in particular have been looking further afield for material, as CD series like the ''Buddha-Bar'' compilations demonstrate. Correctly or not, they hear the sounds of unfamiliar cultures providing a fashionably exotic, even spiritual lift, just the thing for a dance floor or a chill-out lounge. It's not simply one-way traffic of American and European disc jockeys sampling other cultures, either. Musicians everywhere are quickly assimilating sounds and gadgets.\n\nDecades ago, when ethnomusicologists went to far-off places, they hoped to capture music devised and heard strictly locally. Now isolated music is increasingly rare. Instead, many world-music albums document local responses to a universe of possibilities, and while hip-hop, trance, rock and reggae have made inroads nearly everywhere, what happens to them is very different in, for instance, Senegal and India.\n\nHearing music from the other side of the world is now as easy as an Internet connection: through informative sites like www.Afropop.org, www.xenomusic.com (which specializes in Eastern Europe) and www .worldmusicportal.com. Among the many world-music Webcasters are www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/world and www.worldmusicradio.com. Albums are easier to find as well: within the city at Tower Records World Music Annex, at Lafayette and East Fourth Streets in the East Village, and at large stores like J&R, HMV or the Virgin Megastores, and online at www.amazon.com and www.cdnow.com. The World Music Institute (212-545-7536) sells albums of traditional music from six continents.\n\nWorld music has always been a slippery term and is becoming more so with every Internet file transfer. To choose the albums for this article, I applied some arbitrary and inconsistent limits. Reggae, salsa, Latin pop and electronica, which are staples of world-music departments in record stores, are largely absent because of the large volume of releases available here; so are self-conscious fusion efforts by Western musicians. More subjectively, the choices below avoid music that has largely traded away its local character to sound like internationalized pop or rock. The list, alphabetical by country or region, favors music that shows some traditional roots, even if they have been grafted and gene-spliced with computers. (The CD's range in price from $13 to $15 each to $18 for a two-CD set.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
