Our opopanax resin is gathered from Commiphora erythracea. Commiphora is a flowering plant in the same family as frankincense and myrrh and grows in tropical climates throughout Africa, India, and southwestern Asia. Incisions are made in the bark allowing the sap to ooze out and solidify. The variegated, amber-colored resin has a warming, rich, earthy scent and is employed as incense, either alone or mixed with other resins.

Now certified organic! Opopanax is a flowering perennial, producing small clusters of yellow flowers. It is native to Southern Europe and parts of the Middle East, preferring warm weather, which enables it to produce greater qualities of its fragrant resin. The harvest of gums and resins takes place during the dry season, as they are easily damaged by rain. A number of incisions are made into the bark, and the gum resins are allowed to ooze out and solidify for a few weeks. The harvesters then return to each tree to collect the resin. The resins are then transported to local villages where they are further dried in the shade.
