Opoponax—sometimes written as “opopanax”—is a warm, balsamic gum resin native to the Horn of Africa. It is a close relation to frankincense and myrrh: embodying similar qualities, but with its own distinct profile. Opoponax derives from the bark of a tree belonging to the Barseraceae family and the genus Commiphora, which grows in the dry, rugged climates of Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
