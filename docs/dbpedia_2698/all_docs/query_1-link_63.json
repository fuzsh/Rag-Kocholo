(compare turnip n.). The development of the β forms is unexplained.\n\nNotes\n\nThe Latin term has been borrowed into other Germanic languages, compare Middle Dutch pastenake (Dutch pastinak), Middle Low German pasternāk, pastināke, Old High German pastinac, pasternaca (Middle High German pasternacke, pasternac, German Pastinake, Pastinak), Old Swedish pastinata, palsternakka (Swedish palsternacka), Danish pastinak (17th cent. as pestenak). Compare also Italian pastinaca (1288), Old Occitan pastenaga parsnip, carrot. The Old English Glossaries render post-classical Latin pastinaca as English feld moru, walhmore, wealmoru, more, etc., 13th cent. walmore, c1400 wolemore.

This may result in inaccuracies.\n\nSmoothing has been applied to series for lower-frequency words, using a moving-average algorithm. This reduces short-term fluctuations, which may be produced by variability in the content of the Google Books corpus.\n\nDecade Frequency per million words 17500.3417600.3417700.3717800.5217900.5718000.5418100.5718200.5518300.4618400.4418500.4418600.4218700.4318800.4318900.4619000.4819100.4919200.5119300.4819400.419500.3519600.3219700.2919800.2919900.3120000.3220100.33\n\nFrequency of parsnip, n., 2017–2023\n\n* Occurrences per million words in written English\n\nModern frequency series are derived from a corpus of 20 billion words, covering the period from 2017 to the present.
