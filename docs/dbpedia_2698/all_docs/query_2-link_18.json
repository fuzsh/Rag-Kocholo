        "text": "Newtopia Now- Day 1 Experience! Yesterday was the first day of Newtopia Now. There were \"Community Experiences\" offered that we could join in on in groups. I joined \"Sustainable Futures: Community Engagement at CSU Spur\" not knowing what to expect... I think the whole group that went would agree--we made new and very valuable connections, and had a fun time that was very educational. I can imagine how CSU Spur will become an ongoing part of this show with all they offer to our industry and the public! I am looking forward to seeing what the day brings today, as the show floor opens...stay tuned.. #NewtopiaNow #NaturalProducts #Denver Colorado State University\n\nSacred Stimulant. Famously, the main source plant for the Cocaine Drug, Coca (Erythroxylum coca) is native to the Andean region of South America. The Andean regions of the countries of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia are responsible the vast majority of the land production of Cocoa. Besides the use of Coca for cocaine production, Coca is considered a sacred plant among several native cultures of South America, and there is evidence of human consumption that spans 4000+ years! The Cocaine alkaloid was first isolated in 1859. The Coca leaf itself averages only a very small percentage of the Cocaine alkaloid (less than 1%), and when the leaf is used traditionally in its natural form, it does not normally cause the addictive problems we see with the purified compound. When traveling to high altitude regions of the Andes, the tourist might find shocking that Coca leaf tea drinking is encouraged for combatting high-altitude sickness, and that it is even sometimes available in airports! Coca leaf tea (mate de coca) is a popular beverage in Andean cultures that provides mild stimulation and relief from altitude-related ailments. Though use of Coca leaves has spanned such a long history, it didn’t become popular in the West until the 19th century when an Italian neurologist wrote a paper detailing its beneficial effects on cognition. This spurred its use in a number of products, among them the original version of Coca-Cola. These products then became illegal in the 20th century, after their addictive use became apparent. In recent times, several of the countries in the native range of Coca have defended its traditional use. Its traditional medicinal use is as a stimulant for aiding both mental and physical fatigue, as an anesthetic and analgesic, and also for treating bleeding (as it constricts blood vessels). Other traditional uses exist, such as for headaches, asthma, malaria, for digestion, and as an aphrodisiac. Coca is still used today in many household products, and enjoyed by all levels of society. Coca has also long-held (through present times) an important place in the religious cosmology & rituals of the Andean peoples. #Biodiversity #MedicinalPlants #Ethnopharm #Ethnobotany #herbalism #caca #cocaine *This content is for informational and educational purposes only.

In this article CRN explained that \"news coverage that sounds the alarm based on this publication [a recent JAMA article] reflects that the reporters have either not read the study or do not fully appreciate its limitations. The bottom line: ABC Chief Science Officer Stefan Gafner, Ph.D., commented: “In my opinion, the main issue is that the paper implies that 15 million U.S. adults are exposed to potentially hepatotoxic botanicals. This sounds like a huge problem, even if the actual risk of liver injury from the six botanicals in question is low. The authors provide some information to support the hepatotoxic potential of botanicals, but these data are provided without proper context and suggest that the risk of liver injury is much greater than it actually is.” https://lnkd.in/g6_EPt5A\n\nFlower Power! Crepe Myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica & hybrids) is a beautiful and popular small street tree or shrub from China and the Indian subcontinent that can grow to about 15 feet with bright displays of vibrant, crinkled flowers that come in various colors and have a long summer bloom. Lagerstroemia indica is different from L. speciosa, which is also called Crepe Myrtle or Banaba; whereas, L. indica is much smaller with different uses. Crepe Myrtle is widely available as an ornamental tree, as there are about 15 hybrid cultivars available. They are available in a number of different colors, from white, pink, to purple and carmine. As a street tree, they are hardy to frost, not picky about soil type, but need good drainage, and can tolerate drought once established. Crepe Myrtle has multiple uses beyond its medicinal applications. The wood of crepe myrtle, though not widely used in heavy construction, is sometimes employed in making small tools, furniture, and ornamental carvings due to its hardness and fine grain. The flowers and leaves are occasionally used in traditional dyeing processes, producing yellow to brown hues. Additionally, its vibrant flowers and attractive bark make it a popular choice in landscaping and horticulture, where it is planted for ornamental purposes in gardens and urban settings. In traditional medicine, the main use of Crepe myrtle is for wound healing—the flowers can be applied as a poultice to cuts and wounds to enhance wound-healing. Traditionally, the stem bark is used to stop bleeding (styptic), as a stimulant, and also to reduce fever (febrifuge), while the bark, leaves and flowers are considered to be purgatives. The root is also used as an astringent and detoxifier. A decoction of the flowers also has a reported use for colds. Through scientific investigation Crepe Myrtle has exhibited anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, and anticancer properties. In preclinical studies, the extract has shown potential in treating allergic disease, such as asthma, as it exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in an asthma model. #Biodiversity #MedicinalPlants #Ethnopharm #Ethnobotany ##crepemyrtle #woundhealing #bandage #styptic #lagerstoemia #floweringtrees #medicinalflowers #herbs *This content is for informational and educational purposes only.
