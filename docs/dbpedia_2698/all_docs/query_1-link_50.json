        "text": "\"A Plant a Day\"- Opopanax, Hercules-all-heal (Opopanax chironium)-\n\nThis Southern European herbaceous perennial grows to about 6 feet tall with a branching stem and large flat yellow inflorescences at the top of the plant. Opopanax is mainly grown for the production of its resin, which exudes when the base of the stem is cut and is sun dried. It is a flammable resin that makes an incense with a long history of use, as well as the base for extracting an oleoresin for use in perfumery. The scent of Opopanax is both floral and balsamic. The resin has also been used in foods, and is considered GRAS in the US as a flavoring. There is another “Opopanax” in trade used for perfumery referring to a Commiphora species, unrelated to this species.\n\nOpopanax resin also has a long history of use in traditional medicine but in recent times has fallen into disuse. It was used for both its antispasmodic and antiinfective qualities, in such conditions such as dysmennhorea, muscle spasms, visceral infections, and as an emmenagogue. There are some traditional uses that suggest it may also have some sedative qualities, but this has not been substantiated through scientific research (to my knowledge). With its strong history of use as an incense as well as antiinfective qualities, this “Hercules-all-Heal” with a strong herbal tradition deserves more research!\n\n© Ethnopharm #APlantADay #UsefulPlants #MedicinalPlants #Ethnopharm #GRAS #opopanax #europe #incense #perfume #essentialoil #resin #antispasmodic #musclespasm #antiinfective\n\nPhoto by Hectonichus"
