Botany. Pig. 92. Flower (f ). Fig. 94. Fruit. Fig. 93. Long. sect, of flower. the wing of the fruit is sometimes, but not constantly, a little thicker. Heradeum comprises biennial or oftener perennial herbs from the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, with wide leayes often divided into lobes themselves wide ; rarely pinnate, oftener compound- or ternate-pinnate. Some of these plants inhabit Abyssinia, India and North America. Equally near are Malabaila and Opopanax, which we cannot separate generically from each other. The former has oboval or orbicular fruit, much compressed, with solitary vittae and thick dilated margin, smooth and formed of white tissue called suberose. Malabaila proper is ordinarily glabrous. They are perennial herbs with decompound pinnate leaves inhabiting the Levant, eastern Africa, and Southern Europe. To them we annex, as a section, Zozimia, distinguished only by the presence of a thin translucent membrane between the thickeijed margin of the fruit and its seminal cavity. It is a perennial downy herb, native of the Levant. Lefebvria with us is also a section of Malabaila; it has the same oboval fruit, but the style, the branches of which are thick and attenuate at the summit, is-inserted at the bottom of a very distinct hollow bounded by the two wings above. It is from tropical Western Africa. Ana-.
