The main commercial application of Opoponax is in the perfumery and cosmetics sectors. Though people often find the taste acrid and bitter, the highly flammable resin can also be burned as incense to produce a scent somewhat like balsam or lavender. The resin has also been used in the treatment of spasms and, before that, as an emmenagogue in the treatment of asthma, chronic visceral infections, hysteria and hypochondria."
