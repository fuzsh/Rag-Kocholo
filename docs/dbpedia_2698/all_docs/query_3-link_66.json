        "text": "WE ARE HERE FOR A HEALTHY FUTURE\n\n​\n\nThe production of foods of animal origin, which has a great place in human nutrition, is directly related to the quality of plant products. All problems related to the inadequacy and quality of plant products greatly affect the yield and quality in animal food production. All these risks now make animal food supplements mandatory in the production of animal foods.\n\n​ ​\n\nFor all these reasons, with our experience and knowledge gained over many years in the agriculture and livestock sector, our professional team specialized in high technology and manufacturing; We produce feed additives in our factory, which we established in Amasya, in order to achieve high efficiency in animal husbandry and high quality in animal products.\n\n​\n\nWHAT WE PRODUCE\n\nIn our factory located in Amasya; a wide range of animal races/genus/species such as cattle and ovine livestock and dairy animals, poultry, pet animals, beekeeping, fishing, exotic animals; We produce liquid, powder, tablet, cream, granule and pellet feed additives (premixes, baby food, lick buckets, etc.) containing vitamins, minerals, amino acids.\n\n​ ​"
