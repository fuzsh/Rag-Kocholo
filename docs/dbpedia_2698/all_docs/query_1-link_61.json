        "text": "Historical Distillation of Plants, Oils and Waters\n\nHistorical texts vary in their accounts of the types of distillation practiced in the past, but one fact remains; distillation of plants has been around for a very long time, albeit not always in the form that we are familiar with today.\n\nDistillation, in its crudest form, is defined by Encyclopedia Britannica as a, “…process involving the conversion of a liquid into vapour that is subsequently condensed back to liquid form.”1 However, as any experienced distiller will tell you, distillation is not only a scientific process but a true art as well.\n\nPlants are placed in the still, through either water or steam distillation (see The Process of Distillation below) and transformed from plant to steam to liquid through a complex system of managing plant matter, heat, and water. The end result produces either an essential oil or hydrosol.\n\nWe may never know the exact process of how early civilizations turned plants into oils and hydrosols, but an interesting paper on the Early History of Distillation by T. Fairley, F.R.S.E., F.I.C, from 1906 discusses various methods of distillation practiced by ancient people of India, Arabia, China, Phoenicia, Greece, and Rome.2 Indeed, Ann Harman in her book Harvest to Hydrosol states that: “The oldest [alembic] still that has been discovered, to date, is almost 4000 years old.”3 The still which she is talking about was found by Dr. Maria Rosaria Belgiorno at Pyrgos in 2005.\n\nMost historical texts agree that the ancient Egyptians were using plants as oils for perfumery and medicinal practice, as well as religious purposes. Scent was revered by the ancient Egyptians as a key to everlasting life. Aromatic oils and plants were used in all aspects of daily life.4 The ancient Greeks and Romans then learned techniques and use of plants and oils from the Egyptians. However, it was a physician from Persia by the name of Avicenna (980 A.D. – 1037 A.D.) who made a significant contribution to how plants are distilled today; the addition of the refrigerated coil into the still.5\n\nSolvent Extraction\n\nSome plants are difficult to process. A different method might be used to extract the aroma from these types of plants. However, these processes use a chemical base. The resulting product is known as an absolute, concrete, resin, resinoid, or oleoresin. These substances are usually thicker in nature than a true essential oil and the aroma can be different. Perfumists often use these types of extracts as they are extremely aromatic. However, aromatherapists can often use them in place of the essential oil, particularly for emotional work.\n\nSome of these plants can also be distilled or extracted by carbon dioxide. Check carefully which type of extract you are using. Retailers should make it clear on the label of the bottle you are purchasing but if in doubt, ask. A reputable supplier should be able to answer your questions confidently.\n\nConcretes are prepared from plant material using a hydrocarbon solvent to produce a waxy, solid substance. Absolutes are prepared from concretes by alcohol extraction. Examples of concretes and absolutes include gardenia (Gardenia jasminoides), violet (Viola odorata), and narcissus (Narcissus poeticus). Note that jasmine (Jasminum grandiflora) is steam distilled from the absolute, not the plant itself. Some plants, such as rose (Rosa x damascena) may produce an essential oil, concrete, and absolute. The final product differs in aroma and, to some extent, therapeutic properties.\n\nResins are the natural material (gum) exuded from the bark of a tree when it is cut. Resinoids are the result of a resin extraction by use of a hydrocarbon solvent. Absolute resins are also produced using an alcohol solvent. Oleoresins are the natural material exuded from plants and are extracted using a solvent. Oleoresins both essential oils and resins (and solvents).\n\nPlants which produce a resinoid include opopanax (Commiphora erythraea) and myrrh (Commiphora myrrha). Both of these plants also produce an essential oil. Nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) produces an oleoresin from mace. Benzoin (Styrax benzoin) produces an absolute resin (or resinoid)."
