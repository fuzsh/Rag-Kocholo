        "text": "Welcome to a fascinating journey through the world of flowers that start with O. From the elegant Orchid to the charming Oxeye Daisy, this collection showcases a diverse array of blooms, each with its own unique beauty and characteristics.\n\nList of flowers that start with an O\n\nWhether you’re searching for baby name inspiration, planning a floral arrangement, doing some botanical research, or just keen to immerse yourself in the world of flowers, we’ve got you covered.\n\nThis article explores the many beautiful flowers beginning with O. For each flower we’ve included some key facts and an image, plus common names and any associated symbolism (you can find out more about flower symbolism here).\n\nObedient Plant (Physostegia virginiana)\n\nA member of the mint family, Obedient plant is native to North America and has upright flower spikes with white, pink or lilac blooms. The name Obedient plant comes from the fact that the flower heads will stay in position when you move them.\n\nObedient plant is quite invasive and will spread quickly if you give it the chance.\n\nObregonia (Artichoke Cactus)\n\nObregonia cacti produce beautiful pale pink flowers with yellow centres. The stem resembles an artichoke, hence the common name.\n\nArtichoke Cactus symbolises resilience, persistence, and endurance.\n\nOenothera (Evening Primrose)\n\nEvening Primrose plants are tall and produce bright yellow flowers from late summer into autumn. The lovely blooms have a strong fragrance, and the plant is used in a range of cosmetics and traditional medicines. Evening primrose is also a great option for cut flowers.\n\nOenothera symbolises youth or new beginnings, protection, and love.\n\nOkra Flower\n\nYou probably associate the okra plant with its edible pods, but it also produces beautiful blooms. This plant belongs to the hibiscus family, and its cream showy flowers certainly have a resemblance.\n\nIn some cultures, okra flowers are thought to symbolise prosperity and good fortune.\n\nOld Man’s Beard (Clematis vitalba)\n\nThis UK native plant scrambles over hedgerows and produces scented white flowers that turn feathery as they age. It’s loved by wildlife, but considered to have an invasive habit.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Old Man’s Beard symbolises longevity and wisdom.\n\nOleander\n\nOleander is an evergreen Mediterranean shrub with funnel shaped flowers. The blooms can be pink, red, purple, white, or yellow. It’s a vigorous plant and is also highly toxic to animals and humans.\n\nOleander symbolises love, destiny, and resilience, but it can also symbolise caution – most likely due to its poisonous nature.\n\nOlearia (Daisy Bush)\n\nThis evergreen shrub is covered in an abundance of daisy-like flowers in late summer. It’s often used as hedging and in coastal gardens as it can cope with salty air and winds.\n\nOmphalodes\n\nThis sweet little ground cover plant boasts heart-shaped leaves and dainty blue or white spring flowers. It’s ideal for a shady spot or a woodland garden, and provides an early source of nectar for bees and other pollinating insects.\n\nOmphalodes symbolised the Virgin Mary and, by association, purity in medieval times, resulting in its common name of Blue-Eyed Mary.\n\nOnopordum acanthium (Scotch Thistle)\n\nProbably the tallest flower that starts with O, Scotch Thistles can reach 8ft. The flowers are blue-purple and hugely popular with bees.\n\nOnopordum acanthium is the national emblem of Scotland, representing resilience and longevity.\n\nOphiopogon planiscapus ‘Nigrescens’ (Black Mondo Grass)\n\nThis ornamental grass is usually grown for its striking black foliage, however it also produces dainty, pale pink blooms in summer.\n\nThe name of this grass comes from the Greek ‘ophis’ (snake) and ‘pogon’ (beard).\n\nOpopanax (Sweet Myrrh)\n\nThe yellow flowers of Sweet Myrrh are famous for their fragrance, and are used in many perfumes. This heat-loving plant likes full sun and well-drained soil.\n\nWe haven’t found a specific symbolism for Sweet Myrrh, but when used as an essential oil it is thought to balance and purify the body and mind.\n\nOpuntia (Prickly Pear Cactus)\n\nFor a drought tolerant flower beginning with O, consider the Prickly Pear. This cactus produces distinctive pink, yellow and orange flowers.\n\nOpuntia symbolises endurance, hope, and protection.\n\nOrange Blossom\n\nAs the name suggests, orange blossom is the orange tree flower. These dainty white flowers have a beautiful fragrance and are often used in perfume.\n\nOrange blossom symbolises of purity, good luck, and fertility. With these associations it’s not hard to see why it’s a popular choice in wedding flowers.\n\nOrchid (Phalaenopsis)\n\nProbably the most well-known flowers that begin with O, orchids are a firm favourite with many indoor gardeners. This large plant family contains over 25,000 different species, with all manner of flower colour, pattern, and size. Orchids are commonly thought of as ornamental plants, but some species are believed to have medicinal properties too.\n\nOrchid flowers symbolise beauty, love, and grace. There are colour-specific meanings too: white for purity, red for passion, yellow for joy, orange for energy, pink for femininity, and blue for calmness.\n\nIf you’re an orchid plant parent, you might like to take a look at our orchid care tips which will help you keep your plants in tip-top condition.\n\nOrchid Cactus (Epiphyllum cacti)\n\nFor a cactus with a difference, look no further than Epiphyllum cacti. These plants have trailing stems and produce showstopping scented flowers that bloom at night. They love humid, shady environments and are suited to hanging baskets.\n\nOrchid Cactus symbolises patience, love, and beauty.\n\nOregano\n\nThis Mediterranean herb thrives in sunny locations and produces a mass of tiny pink flowers alongside fragrant green leaves.\n\nAs well as being a pretty flower that starts with O, oregano is a useful herb for cooking and has also been used in traditional medicine due to its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.\n\nOregano symbolises happiness and joy. The word ‘oregano’ means ‘mountain of happiness’ in Greek).\n\nOregon Grape (Mahonia)\n\nMahonias are evergreen shrubs with glossy leaves that produce bright yellow, scented spikes of flowers in winter and early spring, and edible berries in autumn. It’s a great plant for adding interest to a garden when most other plants are dormant.\n\nOriental Poppy (Papaver orientale)\n\nA firm favourite in the garden and in bouquets, oriental poppies are delicate flowers with soft petals, dark centres, and slender stems. The most well-known colour is red, but you can find oriental poppies in many other colours, including pinks, white, and orange.\n\nThe most famous symbolism of poppies is remembrance, due to the association of red poppies with fallen soldiers. However, poppies also symbolise love, beauty, eternal life, and peace.\n\nOrnamental Onion (Allium)\n\nWith their impressive globes of tiny flowers, ornamental onions can be a real showstopper in the garden or in a floral arrangement. Many varieties produce purple flower heads, but you can also choose from pink and white varieties.\n\nAlliums are loved by pollinating insects, and as they belong to the onion family their scent is also good at repelling unwanted garden pests.\n\nAlliums symbolise prosperity and good luck.\n\nOrthinogalum (Star of Bethlehem)\n\nThese white, star-like flowers grow from bulbs and are popular in cut flower bouquets. It’s well-suited to rockeries and also a good option for pots.\n\nOrthinogalum symbolises purity, hope, and forgiveness.\n\nOsbeckia\n\nOsbeckia is a herbaceous perennial plant that produces interesting purple flowers with tactile petals. This low-growing plant has a drooping habit and is often used for ground cover in tropical climates.\n\nOsmanthus\n\nOsmanthus are evergreen shrubs that produce white, highly fragrant flowers in late spring. Osmanthus tea is popular in China and believed to have cleansing properties.\n\nSymbolism associated with Osmanthus includes joy, love, and serenity.\n\nOsteospermum (African Daisy)\n\nOsteospermum plants, native to Africa, thrive in warm climates. Throughout summer, this popular ornamental plant boasts an array of daisy-like blooms, flourishing in both pots and garden beds. With a wide range of vibrant colours available, there’s ample choice to suit any garden style.\n\nAfrican Daisies symbolise innocence, purity, and happiness.\n\nOwl’s Clover (Castilleja exserta)\n\nThis pink and purple annual takes its name from the unique shapes of its flowers, which resemble an owl’s face. It’s brush-like flower spikes bloom in spring and are loved by pollinators.\n\nOxalis (Wood sorrel)\n\nWith their clover-shaped leaves and dainty flowers, oxalis have a lot to offer. The flower colours available include yellow, pink, white, and lilac. Some species of oxalis can be grown as houseplants, while others are better suited to the garden. Oxalis has a bit of a reputation for being weed-like, due to the fact that some varieties will quickly spread around the garden.\n\nOxalis symbolises hope and good luck – probably due to those clover-like leaves.\n\nOxeye Daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare)\n\nOxeye Daisies are perennial wildflowers. You will most likely be very familiar with this low-maintenance plant, which grows in meadows and grassland. It can provide a rich source of pollen and nectar for birds, bees and other pollinating insects, so if you’d like to make your garden more wildlife-friendly they’re an excellent choice.\n\nOxeye daisies symbolise cheerfulness, purity, and new beginnings. They have also been associated with divination.\n\nOxypetalum (Blue milkweed)\n\nAs the common name suggests, Oxypetalum has blue flowers and milky sap. It’s native to North Africa and is sometimes found in flower arrangements.\n\nOxypetalum symbolises hope, peace, and purity.\n\nOxytropis (Locoweed)\n\nThis tough plant can cope with subarctic temperatures, so it makes a great option for a challenging garden location. The flower spikes can be blue, purple, or white.\n\nOyster Plant (Tradescantia spathacea)\n\nOyster plants are mostly grown for their lovely foliage, but they also produce clusters of white flowers. Also known as Moses-in-the-cradle, they are usually grown as indoor plants.\n\nOyster plants symbolise rebirth and protection.\n\nFrom the elegant Oriental Poppy to the vibrant Osteospermum, each of these flowers starting with O carries its own unique beauty and symbolism. Whether adorning bouquets or brightening gardens, these flowers enrich our lives with their charm and grace. Will you be using any flowers that start with O to inspire your floral adventures?\n\nMore plant inspiration"
