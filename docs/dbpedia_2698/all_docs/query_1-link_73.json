        "text": "The formula presented by Paul and attributed to Henri Robert is indeed a great shorcut to Jicky. However, it is far from the original. Opopanax note is a key note in Jicky. But that opopanax from the XIXth century is not the opopanax we have today. Opopanax got extinct. Many houses made reproductions after 1900 based either on the original opopanax scent or based on the opopanax perfume idea (as seen in the reproduction done by Jamie Frater based on old formulae). Oak moss as such (Mousse Lautier absolute) did not exist in 1889, they were made 20 years later. Moss infusion, maybe … But this aspect is not crucial to Jicky as it is to Mouchoir de Monsieur (a more elegant version of the theme, less oriental, but mossy).\n\nRose bulgarian 60% geraniol does not exist. It is a way to say that rose bulgarian is mixed with geranium. Geranium is a key element in Jicky. Bulgarian rose is not. Also, by 1889 the industry of rose oil in Bulgaria as we know it today, did not exist. It was initiated by French entrepreneurs after 1890. Adulterations with geraniol came much later when the process of extraction / separation became possible. In 1889 this was entirely unknown. The main theme was geranium-rose oil-rose de mai infusion. No other options.\n\nWhat is missing in the formula presented by Paul is jasmine. Because in Jicky and in Mouchoir de Monsieur you have a full floral accord, typical for the style of XIXth century. Rose-Jasmine-Tuberose infusions from pommade. The tuberose aspect is not obvious, but it’s there contributing to the richness. It is there, in both original formulae, but hard to detect by nose, because the floral aspect is not dominant.\n\nThe formula presented by Paul and attributed to Henri Robert is indeed a great shorcut to Jicky.

It is there, in both original formulae, but hard to detect by nose, because the floral aspect is not dominant.\n\nThese are some fascinating facts you present FabianRoss. What is your source? I would like to learn more. How do you know this information?\n\nI did look for other Jicky formulas in my endowment, I can see that there are more than the one that I posted, but I could not find them. nearly 98% of any book's \"J\" alphabetical section is occupied with Jasmine formulas, and no Jicky that I could find easily.\n\nI did notice that the Jicky formulas are likely very early in the timeline of my formulas, but the earlier are the least organized.\n\nI have spent literal days and nights looking for formulas in the past, but I spent only about 20 minutes searching today for more Jicky Formulas. I am sorry to report not finding more to learn from at the present time.\n\n10,000 formulas just takes an inordinate amount of time to go through, without a digital cataloguing.\n\nAnd since I am also the Librarian, that cataloguing is low on the To Do list. HA!\n\nPK\n\nJicky had no bases. So, no Opopanax 216 and other numbers. For a very simple reason. In 1889 there was no Givaudan, Chuit Naef or Roure. De Laire was not selling sophisticated bases. Of course, you can use later bases for an easier approach, but keep in mind that those bases have not been invented yet when the perfume was made. If the formula was later twisted, this is another story. In Jicky, original formula you have \"EDC Imperiale\" (later splitted into major ingredients), also cinnamon (two types) and a millefleurs accord (infusion pommade from rose-jasmine-tuberose !!!!). Good Luck !\n\nJust to add some clarity around opoponax 216 - it was created by Agatstein who was emplyed in the earliest years of Chuit Naef but it may of course have predated the company - after all, De Laire existed from 1876, more than a decade before Jicky came out and four or so years after the mass production of \"frost of vanilla\" AKA vanillin. There is nothing in opoponax 216 that did not exist the year Jicky came out (mostly naturals - hence the very high price I charge for it) - it is possible that it was part of the first formula but even if not, it was the first opoponax based used in an official Jicky formula but replaced later by Opoonax Doux. Opoponax Doux and Ambreine Samuelson were ultimately the preferred amber bases for Guerlain right up to the late 20th century - though others were used as well of course.\n\nChanges of bases were not uncommon as this was an age of discovery and new things were found all the time. As soon as Ambrarome emerged, Coty added it to Chypre - around the same time as he removed the Musk Ambrette and replaced it entirely with Musk Ketone (originally it used both).\n\nYour mention of the original EDC Imperiale is very interesting - I wasn't aware that it formed a part of the first Jicky formula though that makes a lot of sense. It is a wonderful fragrance and sadly much spoilt in modern reformulations. It is pretty hard to really replicate those beautiful tincture-enriched late 19th century fragrances without a vast library of infusions and even if you do have such a library, some materials are simply gone from the earth forever as genetically altered (via breeding mostly) plants have replaced the originals (case in point being true lavender barreme type).\n\nYes, commercial perfumes, mainly the very old fragrances, knew a time of transition and transformation over time. And bases were introduced to help an emerging industry, with many new brands after mid 1890’s, right after the Universal Exhibition in 1889. De Laire did not sell sophisticated bases around that period and this can be verified via their catalogs and official presentations. Givaudan and Chuit Naef began their business only in 1895. Earlier bases were also inspired by famous perfumes and ideas of the time.\n\nThere are two different aspects here. First, the approximate formula of Jicky as it was imagined and written. Second, the evolution of it and its best olfactory representation, via any possible iteration around similar raw materials available at that time. With this perfume we have a prototype (the scent profile) but also the original scent and the referential scent (as it was known by the public via multiple changes made by Guerlain over more than a century). What is Jicky? Well, many things. But the correct approach here is to avoid bases in order to learn the complexity of naturals and very simple aroma chemicals. It was only 10 years ago that Jicky (perfume) was remade according to the original formula by Guerlain. Not for sale, but as a presentation of their heritage and as gift to the Osmotheque. So, no legislation problems. The use of “eau de cologne imperiale” as a part of the reconstruction appeared only at that time – because commercial Jicky (later versions, already vintage) did not use it. Also, the 2 types of cinnamon, the sophisticated floral heart (typical for the XIX-th century) and the approximation of the original opopanax note (quite different from modern opopanax). The perfume sold for decades by Guerlain as a perfume is still a ghost, compared to the original remade, but nevertheless very close.\n\nAnyway, it does not matter that much how you write the formula as long as it is extremely close to the scent profile. I conceptualize the perfume as Cologne Imperiale + Fougere Royale theme + Opopanax perfume theme + a lot of sandalwood + Millefleurs Extrait (just for added richness) + the lemon accent. Millefleurs is actually extrait rose + extrait jasmin + extrait tubereuse. All from pommade. If you use modern absolutes, you are close, but not that much because the odor of jasmine and tuberose extracted the old way is quite different, more animalic. Civette does not stand out in the original formula, it is there, smoothed by florals, perfectly fitting the opopanax theme. It is the opposite of modern versions when its scent is quite obvious. The use of any Opopanax base is welcomed because otherwise it is difficult to harmonize everything. Also, I do not recommend the use of oak moss. Forget about it. If you want it, consider Mouchoir de Monsieur, a variation arround Jicky, less oriental, more mossy, extremely elegant.\n\nThanks Jamie and Paul for your comments !"
