Email:Info Email:Sales Facebook GSC106947103771 GSC106947103771 Product(s): Opoponax Essential Oil (ETHIOPIA) Mark Evans has this to say about Opoponax Essential Oil (ETHIOPIA) “This Ethiopian opoponax essential oil is created from steam distillation and is a yellow, free flowing liquid. Smelling opoponax oil straight from the bottle will give you a head-rush and probably a headache as it initially has a strong resinous, terpene, paint fume smell and it is this intense aspect which makes it so useful in small amounts as a top-note to brighten any Oriental perfume. Opoponax Essential Oil (SOMALIA) Unlike the absolute oil this material is of a pourable viscosity, amber in colour and produced by steam distilling the resin. In natural perfumery Opoponax is used in chypre, fougere, leather bases, oriental bouquets and heavy-floral perfumes."
