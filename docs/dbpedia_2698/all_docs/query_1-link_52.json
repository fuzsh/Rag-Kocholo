        "text": "Continuing the Resin Review section of the Attar Guide with everything falling between B and I. But before you dive in, in case you missed it, why not have a glance at this brief primer on all things resiny here? It gives you the lowdown on the differences between myrrh and sweet myrrh (opoponax), what benzoin smells like, and the intricacies of the kingliest resin of them all, frankincense. It also explains what amber is, exactly.\n\nBasilica (Solstice Scents)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nCompany description: Rich labdanum absolute paired with effervescent frankincense, polished rosewood, dark myrrh, exotic woods and a waft of heavenly sweet and rich vanilla absolute and fragrant ashes.\n\nI highly recommend Basilica as a starting point for anyone interested in the incense genre. Featuring a friendly, sweet labdanum coupled with smoky myrrh and frankincense, this blend smells purely of High Mass. It is not complicated or indeed complex, but its straightforwardness is part of its charm. In particular, the naturalness of the frankincense note – lemony, pine-like, crisp, and smoky – makes this an absolute pleasure. Soft and soulful, Basilica is basically Avignon (Comme des Garcons) in oil form, a scent so evocative of Catholic rituals that it should come with a trigger warning.\n\nPhoto by Ishan @seefromthesky on Unsplash\n\nBalsamo della Mecca (Mecca Balsam) (La Via del Profumo/ Abdes Salaam Attar)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nAlthough the crepuscular darkness of the resins is essentially the same from eau de parfum to attar, Balsamo della Mecca attar has a very different texture, and therefore a completely different feel. Whereas the original is so dry that it threatens to ignite on the skin at any moment, the attar (mukhallat really) is a concentrated tar, like molasses seeping from a rusty pipe. Dense, sticky fir balsam, myrrh, frankincense, cade, and who knows what else, all boiled down to a medicinal salve one might rub onto an infection. Despite its opacity, it feels excoriating and purifying.\n\nThe labdanum is downplayed in the oil version, allowing the rubbery, fungal saltiness of myrrh to take the spotlight. By corollary, the eau de parfum is dustier and sweeter, thick with labdanum. Given its greater diffusiveness, the eau de parfum has a spiritual, if not ecclesiastical, feel; the mukhallat, on the other hand, feels gothic and a little bit sinister. Put it this way – I would wear the eau de parfum to Midnight Mass, and the oil to an exorcism.\n\nI own the eau de parfum but prefer the mukhallat. It has something of the leathery darkness of Tauer’s L’Oudh but is denser, blacker, and more boiled in texture. (Balsamo della Mecca mukhallat is also completely natural in feel while Tauer’s L’Oudh has a smoky industrial aromachemical undertone in the late drydown).\n\nBoukhour Blend (Abdul Samad al Qurashi)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nBoukhour, or barkhour as it is sometimes spelled, is a mixture of wood chips or briquettes soaked in essential oils, resins, and other fragrant materials designed to be burned over hot charcoal disks in burners to scent the home, clothes, and hair with its thick, perfumed smoke. Muslims also burn boukhour chips to ‘seal in’ perfume oils they have applied on their skin, hair, or robes. This is a lovely and evocative idea – after all, the original meaning of the word ‘perfume’ is per fumus in Latin, or ‘through the smoke’.\n\nCorrespondingly, Boukhour Blend is a perfume oil designed to be rubbed through your hair, onto your clothes, and even ‘baked in’ using the smoke from boukhour chips (hence the name). The opening is a maelstrom of candied white flowers, featuring the standard ASAQ gummy-sweet blend of orange blossom, jasmine, and wildflowers that turns up in other blends. The opening is so intensely syrupy that I feel a tooth cavity coming on.\n\nA generic building block base of amber, wood, and musk has been shoe-horned in to hold up the unctuous mass of honeyed white flowers, but doesn’t really do anything beyond sitting there, looking pretty in a non-descript way. It smells exotic and resinous in the slightly faceless way of those cheap blocks of foil-wrapped barkhour one can pick up in any Asian grocery.\n\nCan you tell just how under-enthused I am? Boukhour Blend is not bad, per se, but it is sorely lacking the interesting smokiness you get when burning real barkhour. If you love Candy by Prada or Amor Amor by Cacherel and want something similar in oil form, then this should suffice. For everyone else – you can safely skip it.\n\nBoukhour Blend Supreme (Abdul Samad al Qurashi)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nPractically identical to the regular Boukhour Blend described above, and indeed, it is likely that they are the one and the same, albeit with a bit of up-selling on the name. To my nose, there is a slightly higher concentration of the very sweet, gummy white flowers in the Supreme version, taking it to an outrageous level of bubblegum-like sweetness that sets my teeth on edge.\n\nPhoto by Hannah Troupe on Unsplash\n\nThe Cat (BPAL)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nCompany description: Sleek, black, dark, and clever: benzoin, honey, cedar, and dark musk.\n\nThe Cat smells of fruity honey poured over cedar sap and powdery benzoin, its edges diffused and feathered by a cottony musk. The first impression is of maple syrup seeping from a tree, its lurid sweetness balanced nicely by resinous sap and the vinegary sharpness of the cedarwood, lending it a pickled flavor that pricks the taste buds. The latter stages are packed full of powdery musks with hints of earth and funk.\n\nOverall, The Cat’s forceful essay on pungent honey, resin, vinegary woods, and sweet, powdery musks is a clever balancing act that works well on the skin. It is worth mentioning that even if you do not typically like BPAL’s honey note, The Cat should be on your radar, because the honey here is dark and pine resin-like rather than candy-sweet.\n\nChypre Profund (Mellifluence)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nLet us dispense with the pleasantries – Chypre Profund does not smell like a chypre. What it does smell like, however, is the twenty-year-old Cretan labdanum oil that Mellifluence used to stock, which was deliciously thick, leathery, animalic, and possessed of a salted caramel depth of flavor that never got old. It is this, and not oakmoss, that is the pillar upon which Chypre Profund is constructed.\n\nIt is tough to do a chypre these days. It is especially difficult if you are a self-taught attar maker with limited access to raw materials and a tendency to ‘feel your way’ through the process of making perfume rather than taking a more formal study track. However, if you are a small-batch attar maker and have access to oakmoss absolute and are not bound by IFRA anyway, then why not throw caution to the wind and use oakmoss in quantities that actually show up? If I were Mellifluence, I would take this back to the drawing board and double down on the oakmoss.\n\nAnd while I am making presumptuous suggestions, I would like to urge the addition of the other component of a chypre, i.e., bergamot. Chypre Profund smells good largely because it features a great labdanum material. The tarry aspects of labdanum have been accentuated by a chorus of earthy, dusty notes to create body and interest. But in terms of structure, it lacks both the brightness of bergamot up top and the bitterness of oakmoss down below that would qualify it as chypre.\n\nAs it stands, Chypre Profund is a nice essay on the complexity of labdanum, but there is no getting around the fact that the traditionally three-legged stool of a chypre construction (bergamot-labdanum-oakmoss) is missing two of its three legs and is therefore useless for sitting on.\n\nConjure Dark (Solstice Scents)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nCompany description: Amber, Frankincense, Sweet Incense Smoke, Dried Rose Petals, Sandalwood, Vetiver, Woods, Oud, Vanilla\n\nConjure Dark mixes the musty gloom of a church cellar with the powdered sweetness of cheap Indian rose incense sticks for a result that smells unexpectedly animalic, like beeswax mixed with the odor of someone who hasn’t washed for a long, long time. Conjure Dark conjures (sorry) an image of crouching down behind old wooden crates in a church cellar, watching a secret burial ceremony, the scent of centuries-old neglect mingling with the lingering aromas of candle wax and communion wafers.\n\nVetiver, rose, beeswax, and cold, unburned frankincense are the notes that dominate here. There is a gorgeously stale, almost bready air to Conjure Dark. If you like the idea of incense resin mixed with the aura of damp books and New Age shops, then Conjure Dark will be right up your alley. Trippy but wonderful stuff. I own a bottle.\n\nPhoto by Kier In Sight on Unsplash\n\nDukhan (Mellifluence)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nDukhan refers to a Sudanese purification treatment – usually reserved for women – involving the immersion of one’s body in the smoke from a fire of exotic incense and aromatic woods. But Dukhan leans hard on the fire part of the ritual and barely touches upon the medicinal. This is basically what a library would smell like if set on fire.\n\nThankfully the smoke is never allowed to overwhelm. I appreciate the restraint employed here, because smoky materials such as cade, labdanum, birch tar, tobacco, and so on, have the tendency to drown out the quieter sounds made by the other notes.\n\nDukhan opens on a smoky vetiver note that feels as purely resinous as Hojari frankincense, before sliding into a rich tobacco and leather tandem that forms the hardest-working muscle in the scent. Underneath this, a rubbery tar note lends the tobacco and leather some chew. No sweetness, though. Dukhan is as sinewy as the legs of a professional cyclist after the last Pyrenean mountain stage of the Tour de France.\n\nOverall, Dukhan smells comfortingly masculine, like burying your nose into the well-worn leather jacket of someone who smokes a pipe and has recently nibbled on a piece of frankincense gum. The leather and tobacco are supple, almost buttery, and despite the underlying charcoal smoke, a microcosm, in scent form, of the pipe-and-slipper rituals of a gentleman.\n\nI recommend Dukhan to anyone looking for a resinous leather-tobacco masculine that doesn’t excoriate your nasal cavities with billowing gusts of BBQ smoke. Picture a toned-down, more wearable Hyde (Hiram Green) or T-Rex (Zoologist) and you have the right idea.\n\nL’Encens à la Vanille (Alkemia)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nCompany description: Madagascar Vanilla, golden amber, and resinous incense swirled together with a selection of beautifully aged incense woods and a dusting of aphrodisiac Silk Road spices. Intensely sexy in a mysterious kind of way…\n\nL’Encens à la Vanille belies its attractive description by slicing an intensely metallic incense note through a doughy, sullen vanilla, and then pretty much dropping the mic. The advertized Silk Road spices boil down to the single note of clove, a representation so medicinal it smells spoiled, like dried milk or blood. It eventually settles into a nice, bubblegum-like mélange of woods and amber that fails to atone for the trauma of the first hour.\n\nEnheduanna (Alkemia)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nCompany description: A dark and sultry incantation of seven ancient temple offerings: Zanzibar clove, oakmoss, aged frankincenses, champa blossom, Madagascar vanilla, iron-distilled patchouli, and dark amber.\n\nEnheduanna smells just like the inside of a head shop, i.e., unlit nag champa sticks, amber cubes, and dusty spices. Now, there are perfumes that do a really good job of nailing the atmosphere of one of these places without getting too literal about it (Sikkim Girls by Lush and Le Maroc Pour Elle by Andy Tauer, for example), but Enheduanna is not one of them. It is too straight-forwardly headshoppy to be elegant or interesting. There are much better variations on the theme out there.\n\nEnigma Intense (Sultan Pasha Attars)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nHoly smokes, batman! Lovers of fragrances such as Slumberhouse Jeke, Naomi Goodsir’s Bois d’Ascèse, and Le Labo Patchouli 24, please welcome your newest member to the inner circle! Citrus and lavender offer a glimpse of sunlight before it is whisked away almost immediately, and the wearer plunged deep inside a smokehouse where a leather jacket has just been thrown onto the open fire.\n\nBirch tar is the note that dominates with its fiercely rubbery smoke, but cedar, aged vetiver, Siam benzoin, and copaiba also add to the somber atmosphere. A salty, ashy guaiacol note emerges from the fire, and somewhere in the distance, someone is dry-roasting cardamom, cumin, and caraway seeds on a hot pan. The mouth waters, and so do the eyes. The drydown is warmly ambery without once straying into sweetness.\n\nEve (Possets)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nCompany description: Eve is a heavy oriental, resplendent with musks, earthy sweetnesses [sic], lingering and sexy as only that first lady could have been. This is a complex blend, profound even, but still there is a sparkle to it which marks it as a Posset.\n\nUnfortunately, my sample had turned by the time I got to it (to be fair to Possets, it was a full year later). By then, all I could smell rancid carrier oil.\n\nPhoto by Stephen Frank on Unsplash\n\nfallintostars (Strangelove NYC)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nfallintostars by Strangelove NYC is clever because it pairs the 15th century smell of Hindi oud – the dank, rotting, wet wood smell of animal hides piled high in a medieval dungeon – with the 21st century radiance of a modern amber. For the first half hour, the dissonance is dizzying. The oud is so authentically filthy that you feel like you’re being pressed up against a wall by an lout with a shiv and bad intentions. It is as funky as a plate of fruit and cheese furred over with mold, wrapped in a length of freshly-tanned leather, and buried in a pile of steaming, matted straw.\n\nBut just when you fear you are slipping wholesale into slurry, you notice the bright, peppery overlay of something radiant and electric, like sparks popping off a shorted wire. This accord calls to mind the aromachemically fresh, smoky black tea opening of Russian Tea (Masque Milano Fragranze) more than the pink pepper the notes tell me this is likely to be. The distance between the light and the dark is perfectly judged. It is more of a whoosh than a lift.\n\nBut wait, because we haven’t really talked about the amber yet. Poor Christophe Laudamiel – I bet that after the category-defining glory that is Amber Absolute (Tom Ford) he is afraid to touch labdanum for fear of either never reaching those heights again or being accused of repeating himself. Therefore, no, this is not the benzoin-thickened incense amber of Amber Absolute, but (unexpectedly) the bright, hard sparkle of a champagne-and-vodka amber in the style of pre-reform Ambre Russe (Parfum d’Empire). Like a shot of those clear gold liquors served in the Alps after dinner, it smells so cleansing that I am not sure whether to drink it or apply it to a wound.\n\nMy nose fails me when it comes to the other notes. I don’t get any of the green, hay-like barnyardiness of narcissus (unless it is giving the dirty straw notes in the Hindi oud some welly) or indeed any of the gentler, more jasmine-like nuances of the jonquil variety, and there is nary a hint of rose. I don’t perceive the benzoin at all, which is strange because even if I can’t smell it, I can usually feel it thickening the texture of the basenotes into a flurry of papery dust.\n\nWhat I smell in fallintostars is really an act in three parts: Hindi oud, followed by champagne-and-vodka amber, and finally a huge honking myrrh not listed anywhere. Of course, it is entirely possible that Christophe has managed to work the inky, astringent tones of saffron and hina attar (henna) with his feverish fingers into the shape of a rubbery, mushroomy myrrh. It is also possible that it is just myrrh.\n\nAnyway, what I like about this perfume is that it transcends its raw materials to make you think about the way it is composed. The modern, near slavish adoration at the foot of complex-smelling naturals such as Hindi oud or rose or labdanum often results in muddy, brown-tinged accords that speak more to their own worthiness than to joy, especially in the indie sector. In fallintostars, Christophe Laudamiel takes heavy hitters like Hindi oud and makes it smell like bottled fireflies. And that is alchemy, pure and simple.\n\nFBI.17 (Abdul Karim Al Faransi)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nThe name stands for Fabulous Blend from India, the 2017 edition. It features a dark-ish musk with the faint twang of urinal cakes over tobacco, labdanum, and oud. Thankfully, the musk is not so shriekingly animalic that you have to hide indoors until it fades. Its funkiness is soft and velvety, with only the subtlest of bathroom nuances.\n\nIf this was all there was to it, FBI.17 would be a nice but boring iteration on the Arabian ‘black musk’ theme, but it has a trick or two up its sleeve. The perfume releases its tight musky fist quite suddenly, swiveling into a complex, ashy tobacco accord, which in turn melts into a buttery, incensey labdanum drydown that will appeal to fans of the tobacco-labdanum-heavy Ambre Loup by Rania J.\n\nThere is no vanilla or benzoin to act as the transition shade, so the blend leans on the complexity of labdanum to do all the heavy-lifting. There is a marked similarity between this and the drydown of Amber Ash Sheikh, but the base of FBI.17 is even more unctuously buttery. My nose fails to pick out any oud in this blend at all, but to be fair, I don’t particularly miss it. If you want a cost-effective alternative to Ambre Loup, FBI.17 might be a contender.\n\nPhoto by Stephen Frank on Unsplash\n\nGeisha Amber Rouge (Aroma M)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nGeisha Amber Rouge is – or was – a limited edition version of Geisha Rouge. But to say that Geisha Amber Rouge simply adds amber to the Geisha Rouge formula is inaccurate. Geisha Amber Rouge opens with hot clove and an accord that smells very much like rooibos tea that’s been brewed for a long time and allowed to grow cold. The red tea notes smell tannic, with hints of dried currants, star anise, and rose petals stirring beneath. Those familiar with the original Comme des Garcons Parfum and Costes No. 1 will appreciate the translucent ‘pink-red’ sourness of this accord.\n\nThe amber itself only shifts into view when smelled directly side by side with its parent scent, Geisha Rouge. When the nose returns to Geisha Amber Rouge after smelling the original, the resiny thickness of the amber accord suddenly ‘pops’, making you wonder how you missed it in the first place.\n\nBut the amber does not cloud the clarity of the red tea notes at all. It simply adds a certain louche, dank sexiness that makes me think of women lolling around in half-open kimonos, unwashed and unshaved. All in all, this is an admirably cool-headed spicy amber with a rooibos undertone that tea lovers will appreciate.\n\nGeisha Noire (Aroma M)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nAroma M made its reputation on Geisha Noire, and it is easy to see why. The secret to Geisha Noire is that it gets better the longer you wear it, making it the inverse of most modern fragrances, which hit you with all the glory in the first hour or so but peter out by the time you get home and unbox your new purchase. Thankfully, because Aroma M perfumes are not sold in department stores, there is no urgency to sell you on its topnotes. Most Aroma M perfumes, therefore, take their time to hit their stride.\n\nAnd true to form, Geisha Noire is a perfume that demands you wait a little for your satisfaction. The topnotes are bright but leaden, an undissolved lump of golden resin that hisses on the skin like a scalded cat. The resin accord is piercingly sharp, like lemon rind without any citrus high notes, reminding me a bit of elemi resin. There is also a sherbety, turbo-charged fizz to the texture that smells the way Refresher bars taste. Not a bad smell, you understand – just massively unrefined.\n\nBut give Geisha Noire the courtesy of wearing it for a full day and a strange thing happens. The lump of resin begins to dissolve, liquefying into distinct pools of amber, creamy sandalwood, tonka, and salty ambergris. It smells like antique gold velvet, its flavor miles deep and radiating in every direction. It is also an intensely powdery scent, connecting it to its progenitor Shalimar in firm brushstrokes that might not agree with everyone. But what makes Geisha Noire special, and what marks it out as more than just another Shalimar clone, is its balance between burned sugar and salty driftwood (ambergris).\n\nGeisha Noire is at its very best at the end of the day when its salty-sweet amber has melted into the heat of your skin, forming a veritable forcefield of radiant, gold-tipped sweetness. A true my-skin-but-better kind of scent.\n\nHoly Terror (Arcana)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nCompany description: There are utterly somber and fearsome spirits which are known to haunt certain long-deserted chapels, monasteries and abbeys. An unsettling, austere blend of burning frankincense, sandalwood, deep myrrh, and dusty beeswax candles.\n\nHoly Terror is the star of the Arcana line-up. Despite the mention of words such as ‘unsettling’ and ‘austere’ in the product description, Holy Terror is actually a super friendly affair of resin and musk, thickened with beeswax and a creamy woodsmoke accord.\n\nThe myrrh and frankincense in this blend appear as a vague, blurred ‘resinousness’ rather than as accurate representations of their natural selves. So, for example, there is none of the lemony pine-like facets that identify a resin as frankincense, and none of the earthy-anisic-mushroomy aspects that point to myrrh. Instead, the resins here create a generalized feeling of incense rather than one resin in particular. Indeed, they smell more like wax and woodsmoke than a balsam.\n\nTo point out that Holy Terror smells more resin-like or ‘generically resinous’ is, by the way, not a criticism but an observation. Some people blind buy incense or resin scents because they are trying to find something that accurately represents the aroma of a specific resin, like, for example, unlit frankincense, oud wood (rather than the oil), myrrh, or copal. Incense freaks tend to be very specific about the effect they are looking for. Therefore, my note about the nature of the resins in Holy Terror is simply for clarification.\n\nHoly Terror is more about the homely smell of incense-scented things than High Mass. It is not dark or massively smoky or acrid. It is not a literal incense or burning resin scent like Avignon (Comme des Garcons). It is sweet herbs, tree sap, and woodsmoke wrapped in a just-snuffed-out candlewax accord. It is slightly musky, which creates a tinge of intimacy, like the skin of someone pressing close to you in church. This gives the scent a human aura that is enormously inviting.\n\nHopHead (Possets)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nCompany description: Very nervous people love this blend, it calms you down but leaves you very mellow. Coffee in its most perfectly beautiful form is dropped into 5 ambers which range from sweet to dry. Somehow this combination just makes me want to have a nosegasm. Gourmandy and very bea-utiful [sic].\n\nHopHead is the coffee opening of The Seductive Jesuit draped over a sugary amber accord. Is it the five different ambers as promised by the description? Nope. Just one – a bog-standard indie amber, which is to say sweet, vegetal, and hippyish.\n\nIncense Oud (Universal Perfumes & Cosmetics)\n\nType: dupe, concentrated perfume oil\n\nThe incense note in the dupe is a hair soapier, but in general, this is a close match for By Kilian’s Incense Oud. The original fragrance is a subdued, natural-smelling incense scent, backed by soft green woods, powder, and a hint of smoke. Structurally, the By Kilian is sparse to the point of austerity but rose adds a subtle flush of warmth where needed.\n\nAdmittedly, the dupe does not have the same strong rose presence as the original, and its sparkly, dusty texture is more Pez than frankincense. But it completely nails the tranquil, meditative air of the original. With dupes, sometimes it is more important that the general atmosphere of the original is captured, rather than a precise note-by-note breakdown. This is a great example of that.\n\nPhoto by Jack Hamilton on Unsplash\n\nIncense Royale (Sultan Pasha Attars)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nNot all incense scents are alike, a fact that Incense Royale illustrates by mixing some of the resins used in the dark, tarry Pure Incense with vanilla and some of the lighter, sweeter resins such as benzoin, elemi, and opoponax to arrive at an incense fragrance that is a complete 180 degrees from Pure Incense.\n\nIn comparison to its muscular big brother, Incense Royale floats in on a big powdery, vanillic cloud of scent with hints of cinnamon, lemon, lavender, red berries, and rose – all facets naturally present in the resins and oud used rather than the inclusion of any floral absolutes. A fat cushion of benzoin and vanilla adds a plush, pillowy texture that makes the incense feels luxe and pampered rather than churchy or severe.\n\nThere is a faint, sour streak in the woody backdrop that comes from the aged Hindi oud used for Incense Royale, but in general, the oud is not especially prominent. Rather, it sings a low brown note in unison with the other woody notes. Sweet, powdery, faintly resinous, and woody, Incense Royale could be a sort of Ambre 114 flushed with silvery bits of oud. The structure is flooded with citric brightness, perhaps due to the pine and lime peel facets of frankincense, or the creamy, lemony side of elemi resin.\n\nEither way, the diffuse sweetness of the blend feels like it sits at opposite ends to the dark, sticky pungency of Pure Incense. Pure Incense is compacted resin, dark and prune-like, while Incense Royale has light and air and the birds and the bees. Choose according to personal preference, but both are excellent. For ease of comparison, Incense Royale has a very similar feel to softly powdered, sweet incense compositions such as Creed’s Angelique Encens and Guerlain’s Bois d’Armenie. It also shares an airy, woody-aromatic sweetness with Ambre 114.\n\nIncensum (Solstice Scents)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nCompany description: Amber, Frankincense, Palo Santo, Myrrh, Spices, Attars, Oud, Vetiver & more\n\nIncensum is one of the brand’s premium blends, meaning that it is one hundred percent natural, and made with a mixture of attars and essential oils rather than with synthetics. The all-natural nature of this composition bears out in both its quality and in its flat and somewhat muddy feel.\n\nIncensum seems to be structured around a clutch of opposing materials – a cluster of smoky, green, and ‘bitter’ elements such as vetiver, palo santo (guaiac wood), and frankincense on one side, and a grouping of earthy ‘brown’ notes such as oud oil and myrrh on the other. Incensum starts out in a very earnest tone, dominated by sourish wood and resin. But then the oud note drops out of the picture entirely, leaving the balance hanging askew.\n\nIncensum is limited in its movement by the upper limits of its natural raw materials. It morphs very slowly from smoky green wood to earthy, anisic myrrh over the course of a wear. There is a certain rawness (or perhaps sharpness) to the perfume that I like very much. However, demonstrating that a negative reaction can be caused as much by naturals as by synthetic, Incensum gives me a howling headache every time I wear it.\n\nInferno (Sultan Pasha Attars)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nInferno is a potent tobacco and resin bomb presaged by a piercing lime note that runs acrid on my skin. The opening is arresting, with a brief coca cola note leading into a blackstrap molasses note, like prune juice boiled down to a thimbleful of liquid. However, the main character of the mukhallat lies in the interaction between that lime peel topnote with the aromatics, musk, and tobacco in the heart, a combination that draws an unfortunate association with citrus-scented floor disinfectants. Underneath the lime-musk disinfectant note, there lies a very good, smoky tobacco accord, as dry and as husky as a thick book left to smolder in the ashes of a campfire.\n\nPeople who are fond of well-done animalics should seek out a sample of Inferno, as it features significant amounts of hyraceum, castoreum, musk, ambergris, and civet, as well as a touch of Hindi oud, but is blended expertly so as to lend the attar a dark, sultry growl rather than an all-out, high-pitched animal shriek. As the astringent lime-musk combo dies out, the wonderfully dry, smoky smell of the resins, animalics, and woods lingers for hours. In fact, the drydown of Inferno is my favorite of all Sultan Pasha’s blends (excepting Aurum D’Angkhor). I just can’t take the first half.\n\nInquisitor (Solstice Scents)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nCompany description: A Dark Resinous Blend of Myrrh, Labdanum, Beeswax Absolute, Frankincense, Amber, Leather & Fire\n\nEvery now and then, you want to smell like the Second Coming. A bit churchy, a bit gothic, a bit Mordor? Yeah, I hear you. Forget Avignon (Comme des Garcons), Casbah (Robert Piguet), and Full Incense (Montale) – Inquisitor by Solstice Scents gets you there for about eighteen dollars. Featuring a raw, chlorine-dipped leather over a pile of smoking resins, Inquisitor makes a lunge for your throat and doesn’t let go.\n\nIt is weirdly sexy. The drydown, thick with vanillic resins like benzoin and labdanum, is slightly creamier, but the perfume never really strays too far from its dominatrix-meets-smoking-censer theme. More gothic than churchy, Inquisitor is perhaps the choice for apostates. If you are a true believer, I would instead recommend the wonderful Basilica by the same brand – a quiet, simple Avignon-lite number that scratches the ecclesiastical itch to perfection.\n\nAbout Me: A two-time Jasmine Award winner for excellence in perfume journalism, I write a blog (this one!) and have authored many guides, articles, and interviews for Basenotes. (My day-to-day work is in the scientific research for development world). Thanks to the generosity of friends and acquaintances in the perfume business, I have been privileged enough to smell the raw materials that go into perfumes and learn about the role they play in both Western and Eastern perfumery. Artisans have sent vials of the most precious materials on earth such as ambergris, deer musk, and oud. But I have also spent thousands of my own money, buying oud oils directly from artisans and tons of dodgy (and possibly illegal) stuff on eBay. In the reviews sections, I will always tell you where my sample came from and whether I paid for it or not.\n\nSource of samples: I purchased my samples of Arcana, Maison Anthony Marmin, BPAL, Mellifluence, Possets, Solstice Scents, Aroma M, Alkemia, and Universal Perfumes & Cosmetics. My samples of oils from Abdes Salaam Attar, Abdul Samad al Qurashi, and Sultan Pasha Attars were sent to me by the brands or a distributor. My sample of Strangelove NYC fallintostars was courtesy of Luckyscent, provided for copywriting purposes.\n\nNote on monetization: My blog is not monetized.

But before you dive in, in case you missed it, why not have a glance at this brief primer on all things resiny here? It gives you the lowdown on the differences between myrrh and sweet myrrh (opoponax), what benzoin smells like, and the intricacies of the kingliest resin of them all, frankincense. It also explains what amber is, exactly.\n\n020 (Hyde & Alchemy)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nNo. 020 is orange-scented toffee rendered in liquid form, with a sprinkle of pepper for interest. A combination of patchouli, tonka, and vanilla gives the scent a waxy, fudge-like texture that muffles the high-toned brightness of the orange blossom. No. 020 bears some similarity to Hermès Ambre des Merveilles, its orangey goodness spiced with pepper instead of salt.\n\nAbsolute Amber (Clive Christian)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nEscaping the wrath of Tom Ford’s legal department by a hair, Absolute Amber is a juggernaut of an amber with a synth under-pinning so potent it could fell a horse at five paces. One sniff of this stuff was enough to cause my olfactory system to start closing up shop. But at the edges, certain elements that characterize the Clive Christian approach with these exclusive oils can still be identified.\n\nThe first characteristic element is a topnote that is Lanolin-like in its medicinal balminess, redolent of a mixture of vegetable oil, sheep’s wool, tallow, and raw silk. This is probably due to the carrier oil used in the Absolute line of perfume oils. The second element is the supersonic radiance deriving from woody amber synthetics typically used for reach, such as Iso E Super, Cedramber, and the like. The third characteristic I notice, both here and in one or two other examples in the Absolute range, is the emphasis on bringing out the sharper, more confrontational facets of the raw material being highlighted. Sweet and fluffy these oils are not.\n\nTrue to type, Absolute Amber is a tremendously spicy, resinous amber with undertones of plum, raisin, and grated cinnamon bark. It is somewhat comparable in tone to Ambre Eccentrico (Armani Privé), swapping out the plush, fruity tonka bean for a somewhat bitter, aftershavey base that men might appreciate. Absolute Amber is rich without being syrupy or ‘wet in any way. In overall feel, Absolute Amber matches the synthy radiance of other rather butch amber scents such as Amouage’s Opus VI and Ambra Meditteranea by Profumi del Forte. For those unbothered by potent woody ambers, Absolute Amber would be a strong (in every sense of the word) option for winter daywear, especially under a formal suit.\n\nPhoto: My own, Omani silver frankincense\n\nAbsolute Frankincense (Clive Christian)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nNatural frankincense oil has a citrusy, pine-like freshness that is practically its main character trait, and this is precisely the characteristic that Absolute Frankincense has chosen to highlight. The scent extends the silvery bite of the resin by flanking it with a lime-like bergamot and some very natural-smelling coniferous notes. The result smells clean and high-toned – an expression of frankincense oil itself, as opposed to the burnt, smoky notes of the resin as it bubbles on a censer.\n\nThose who love the more severe takes on frankincense such as Annick Goutal’s Encens Flamboyant will appreciate Absolute Frankincense. Just be aware that this oil is monastic in its approach, and that the green purity of the resin has been prioritized far above the smoky, resinous, or sweet notes that usually flank frankincense. This is the cold, smooth smell of the unburned resin itself, and an almost exact match to the aroma of the resin when you rub it between the palms of your hands. My criticism is that Absolute Frankincense is almost too simple – too close to the aroma of good quality frankincense oil itself – to be worth the cost of entry.\n\nAl Masih (Mellifluence)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nAl Masih means Messiah in Arabic, one of the many names for Jesus. And to a certain extent, Al Masih’s incense is more Catholic High Mass than Islamic cannon. Al Masih opens with a frankincense note as piercing as freshly-crushed pine needles, its citric edge underscored by a lemony tandem of elemi resin and petitgrain. The total effect is of a Mediterranean church with its doors thrown open to allow the soft breeze brushing over mastic to mingle with the scent of unburned resin. Cypress, cedar, and hyssop all add to its fresh, outdoorsy air, confirming that churches are not the only places where communion with a Greater Spirit takes place.\n\nThe drydown is a surprise. The sharp brightness of the herbs and resins softens, collapsing into the sensual creaminess of sandalwood. The sandalwood lends a golden, wholesome texture to the scent, recalling the bounty of the harvest and all the good things to eat in the cellar. This series of transitions has the effect of shifting the scene from the wildness of the maquis to a soft and homely devotion scaled to domestic proportions. At once evocative and pleasing, Al Masih might strike a chord for lovers of piney, outdoorsy incense, as well as those who love the ‘medicinal unguent’ bent of modern Italian artisanal perfumery – think Bogue and O’Driu, albeit far, far simpler.\n\nAmber Absolute (Mr. Perfume)\n\nType: dupe, concentrated perfume oil\n\nI have to put my hand up here and admit that I like almost every dupe of Amber Absolute that has crossed my desk. I would wear any of them quite happily in the place of the Tom Ford, because they are invariably lighter, thinner, and don’t quite feel like the twenty-four-hour marathon that the real deal entails. That said, every single Amber Absolute dupe, when worn side by side with the real Amber Absolute, suffers greatly in comparison.\n\nAnd this is no different. The dupe is satisfying and rich on its own but, worn in proximity to the great Tom Ford, reveals itself to fall far short of the mark. Amber Absolute has an enormously thick and heavy labdanum note, possibly Ambreine, a smoky, caramelized labdanum material (natural) owned by Biolandes. This produces an intoxicating brew of caramelized toffee, leather, and burning incense. It is thick and bittersweet, puffed up on all sides by a singed marshmallow note that makes it as hefty as a sleeping toddler. As a perfume experience, it is remarkably well-balanced.\n\nThis dupe – like most others – does not feature that special thick furriness of labdanum or the vanillic cushion of benzoin. The textural density is not right, therefore. The bitterness of the incense notes has been replicated well, but compared to the original, the resins appear watered down. Additionally, there is a minty freshness to the amber absent in the original, whose amber is more richly toffee-like, with whiskyish undertones. In fact, the tart herbal twinge brings the dupe closer to Ambre Sultan than Amber Absolute (although the Serge Lutens is itself far thicker, more resinous, and more full-bodied).\n\nIn time, this dupe settles into a plain incense amber that, while nice, is nothing to write home about. It subtlety and near-translucence compared to the Tom Ford means that it might make for a good option for summer or for those occasions when you want a nip of amber rather than the full jeroboam. Not a great dupe, therefore, but not a bad all-purpose amber oil.\n\nAmber Absolute (Universal Perfumes & Cosmetics)\n\nType: dupe, concentrated perfume oil\n\nWoody Allen once said that ‘Pizza is a lot like sex. When it is good, it is really good. When it is bad, it is still pretty good’. The same could be said for Amber Absolute dupes. Even at their worst, they still smell absolutely fantastic.\n\nEven though it is not a hundred percent accurate, this is the best dupe for Tom Ford’s Amber Absolute that I have personally experienced. It lacks the essential herbal-bitter depth of the incense component that makes the original so ‘tasty’, and as with all dupes of resin-heavy fragrances, there is a thickness missing in the body of the dupe. In particular, the expensive lushness of high quality labdanum and benzoin is just not there. The smoky marshmallow note is also missing, and there is a weird mintiness to the amber that does not feature in the original.\n\nDespite these niggles, however, this dupe manages to nail the essential fruitcake-like deliciousness of the original. It gets you about two-thirds of the way to the real Amber Absolute, and for me personally, that is good enough.\n\nPhoto by Nazar Strutynsky on Unsplash\n\nAmber Afghani (Abdul Karim Al Faransi/Maison Anthony Marmin)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nAmber Afghani is in many ways a traditional Eastern take on amber – dusty, vegetal, and medicinal, with an undercurrent of iodine provided by saffron and henna. This is an amber that walks on the dry, leathery side of labdanum, rather than its unctuously sheep-fatty one. In style and feel, Amber Afghani is similar to Royal Amber Blend by ASAQ, albeit greener and spicier. Although floral notes and spices are listed, only saffron is perceptible, although there is a touch of the oily coolness of black pepper further on.\n\nAmber Afghani is more monolithic than complex, and not something I would ever call refined. However, if you’re in the market for a basic vegetal amber, and you’re more cowboy than cowgirl, then this is a pleasant and reasonably-priced option. To add interest, I suggest layering it with rose and oud oils, or underneath Western (spray) soliflores such as Dame Perfumery’s Gardenia or Tuberose.\n\nAmber Ash Sheikh (Abdul Karim Al Faransi/Maison Anthony Marmin)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nAmber Ash Sheikh is a potent labdanum bomb with the feral honk of freshly-pored road tar and hot ash. Subtle it is most certainly not, but if you are a fan of smoky tobacco fragrances such as Jeke, Tribute, and Patchouli 24, and want a current of sweet, molasses-like amber running beneath, then Amber Ash Sheikh is a must-try.\n\nOn my skin, it is mostly a fearsomely smoky labdanum bomb. Labdanum is a resin from the rockrose plant that can read as ashy, tobacco-ish, and leathery, or alternatively, as wet, unctuous, and caramelic. The way the resin will read in any given scenario depends on the direction the perfumer decides to take it in.\n\nThe direction taken here, with Amber Ash Sheikh, is firmly that of the ashy, dry leather. The opening is so parched it sucks all the moisture out of one’s mouth, but there’s a molasses note hiding behind the ash, bringing a bitter, tarry edge for depth and texture. It is somewhat like the play on ashy and wet seen in Soleil de Jeddah by Stephane Humbert Lucas. But unlike that perfume, there are no bright fruit notes in Amber Ash Sheikh with which to relieve the unrelenting dryness.\n\nOver time – and this is an oil that plays out on the skin over the course of a day or more if you don’t shower (heck, even if you do shower) – the bittersweet molasses note emerges from the shadows, imbuing the blend with a ‘black’ note pitched halfway between soft black licorice and buckwheat honey. The stickiness of this accord is leavened by sour, dusty wood notes, which have a mitti-like pungency to them. Later, the mukhallat smoothes out into a more traditionally buttery version of labdanum, nicely granulated with a gritty, bittersweet resin that recalls both the incensey amber in Amber Absolute by Tom Ford and the dried-fruit, copal bitterness of Norma Kamali Incense. Highly recommended.\n\nPhoto by Isabella and Zsa Fischer on Unsplash\n\nAmber Chocolate (La Via del Profumo/ Abdes Salaam Attar)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nWho on earth could possibly dislike something that smells so delicious? Amber Chocolate is roasted tonka bean shaved into a cup of the creamiest hot chocolate you can imagine. It is spiced with a touch of cinnamon, black pepper, or even chili providing a little burn at the back of your tongue. Thankfully, the spice element has been carefully calibrated to merely texturize the surface of the scent a little, not turn it into a niche-style freak show with curry or B.O. hiding out in the gourmandise, waiting to spring a nasty little surprise on you.\n\nAmber Chocolate is a very thick, fluffy scent, and almost entirely linear. In fact, it is remarkably similar to the yummy but simple goodness of Café Cacao by En Voyage. If you love the smell of dark chocolate with a caramelized ‘condensed milk’ edge, then you’ll love Amber Chocolate. If you don’t, or if you’re hoping it will evolve into something drier or less obviously edible, then you’re out of luck.\n\nThe attar format has much better longevity and duration than the eau de parfum, which fixes the common complaint that most people had with the original. In fact, when it comes to the attar, it is as if the scent refuses to die. It comes as a very dark, thick liquid that goes on like tar and stains the skin. The drydown is finely textured, with hints of toasted bitter almond, hay, and an accord like burnt coffee grounds. For me, Amber Chocolate lives up to the name of ‘delicious tonka bean’ better than Fève Délicieuse does, but I guess Dior got there first.\n\nAmber & Frankincense / Amber Oudh #3 With Frankincense (Aloes of Ish)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nAlthough this quarter tola bottle came to me labeled as ‘Amber & Frankincense’, I am reasonably certain that this is Amber Oudh #3 With Frankincense, based on what I can discern of the notes. The first portion of this oil is pleasant if a little predictable – a dry, vegetal Indian-style amber with lots of raw, rubbery saffron and the lime-peel astringency of frankincense. So far, so traditional. Medicinal and severe, this Indian style of amber accord sits in direct opposition to souk-style ambers, which are focused on sweet, creamy combinations of labdanum, benzoin, and vanilla.\n\nHowever, soon one notices the distinct presence of ambergris – salty, bright, and ozonic – which alleviates the dourness of the Indian amber accord, blowing gusts of sea air up its skirt. The amber/ambergris accord becomes flushed with a thin layer of rubbery smoke, like a lump of resin seen through the haze of steam from a samovar. Like most ambergris-laden affairs, there is also a note of charred leather, reminiscent of choya nakh, the destructive distillation of roasted seashells that many attar makers use to give their perfumes a salty, leathery pungency.\n\nThe heart is amber and smoky black tea, elevated by a transparent texture, like sugar water, vodka, or even champagne running through the pores of the resin, making it possible for the wearer to smell each note clearly. This is unusual in an attar, because the natural density of oil tends to compress more than it aerates. It is a quieter, more translucent take on the smoky booze, black tea, and dried fruit of Ambre Russe by Parfum d’Empire.\n\nAt one stage, there is a fleeting impression of the mint-leaf freshness of a Borneo-style oud, but this soon recedes into the smoky, rubbery black tea accent. The drydown is a pleasurable affair of smoky, sweet resins and vanilla, approaching the singed marshmallow delight of Amber Absolute. This is the little mukhallat that could. Belying its low price, it walks you confidently through several styles of amber, starting off with the saffron-tinged medicinal amber of India, then shifting into a more Arabic ambergris-amber accord, then a Russian samovar (boozy, black tea) amber, to finally, a Western style amber in the incensey mold of Amber Absolute. A prize at any price.\n\nAmber Musc (Universal Perfumes & Cosmetics)\n\nType: dupe, concentrated perfume oil\n\nAmber Musc by Narciso Rodriguez riffs on the basic framework of the original Narciso Rodriguez For Her EDT (sweet orange blossom, musk, and patchouli) by adding amber and oud notes to spin it off into a more oriental direction. The result? A fragrance that retains the clean skin sexiness of the original while gaining a vaguely soukish exoticism.\n\nThe dupe oil is virtually identical, down to the antiseptic cleanliness of the musk and the stiffening breeze of Iso E Super in the drydown. The dupe more than adequately stands in for the original, which costs over two hundred dollars for the big bottle at full retail.\n\nWhen a fragrance is constructed from entirely synthetic ingredients such as white musk, Maltol, and oud replacers anyway, you begin to wonder what exactly you are shelling out the big bucks for. The special raw materials? Nah. Past a certain price point, you are paying for the brand name and the perceived exclusivity or rarity of the scent. Given that Amber Musc is such a basic bitch to begin with, you might as well just buy the dupe and be done with it.\n\nPhoto by Andrea Donato on Unsplash\n\nAmberosia (Sultan Pasha Attars)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nAmberosia is a parched amber with the texture of paper singed briefly at the edges with a blowtorch. Picture the driftwood amber note subtracted from L’Air du Desert Marocain fused with aromatic rosewood, and that’s the basic character of this mukhallat. Herbs and roses play second fiddle here, stepping back to let that austere, slightly cowboy-ish woody amber take the stage. People who love, for example, the desert-dry woods, amber, and restrained rose in Czech and Speake’s No. 88 or Dior’s Ambre Nuit, will also appreciate Amberosia.\n\nTowards the end of its life, Amberosia takes on a surprisingly barbershop-like quality. You can almost taste the dry slap of a leather shaving strap against a freshly-shaved jaw. There is a touch of soap, steam, herbs, and a tantalizing whiff of clean male skin. These barbershoppy notes rough up the amber and wipe out any lingering traces of rose. At this point, Amberosia is reminiscent of hairy-chested retro masculines such as Sahara by Mekkanische Rose, Ker by Bogue Profumo, and even somewhat, the far drydown of Peety by O’Driu. Fans of gentlemanly colognes, wet shaving, and the traditional grooming art of the barbershop will adore this one.\n\nAmber Oud (Mr. Perfume)\n\nType: dupe, concentrated perfume oil\n\nThe original By Kilian Amber Oud is a refined take on a Western-style amber – leathery, woody, and ever-so-slightly-characterless. There’s a whiff of campfire smoke at the edges, but its unique selling point is really its politeness. An amber that merely hints at the spice and roughness of other ambers, and an oud that is non-existent. I am always surprised at this scent’s popularity until I remember that it is the perfect solution for people who dislike both amber and oud.\n\nThe dupe gets the basic scent profile right. But where the original is discreet, the dupe is faint to the point of being undetectable. Oils are generally closer-wearing than sprays, so one expects the volume to be a bit lower. But in exchange for quietness, there should be a certain level of richness to compensate, and this fails to deliver. A nice aroma, therefore, but in a concentration more suited to a body massage oil than a perfume.\n\nAmber Oudh (Rasasi)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nAmber Oudh is a waxy ‘coddled fruit’ amber with a chaser of rose and saffron for that essential taste of exotica. Many a nose will interpret the astringency of the saffron or henna as oud, which is exactly how lower-end mukhallats achieve that oudy, medicinal feel without charging for the real stuff.\n\nCredit where credit is due, Amber Oudh is no better or worse than any other ambery mukhallat on the low end of the scale. It doesn’t read as overly synthetic, and I would recommend it quite happily as part of a beginner’s starter pack on mukhallats. However, it doesn’t hold up to close inspection, collapsing quickly into the soapy white musk that seems to be the natural end of most Rasasi oils.\n\nAmber Paste (Kuumba Made)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nAmber Paste is the breakout star of the Kuumba Made collection, garnering rave reviews and fierce customer loyalty from people who don’t even wear perfume on the regular. The fact that Kuumba Made is sold in Wholefoods and other emporia means that it is accessible to broad cross-section of people. There is something pleasingly democratic about the line, with Amber Paste flying the flag for the brand in a big way.\n\nThey weren’t kidding with the name, though. Amber Paste is definitely a paste rather than an oil, its sticky texture making it more difficult to apply to skin than the other blends in the line. However, the slight fussiness of application is more than worth it because this amber satisfies with its balance between dark, herbaceous topnotes, and golden basenotes. There is even some similarity, briefly, between Amber Paste and that bellwether of ambers, Ambre Sultan by Serge Lutens, although Amber Paste is less complex from every angle.\n\nAmber Paste quickly settles into a powdery vanilla once the initial roar of resin and bay leaf has abated, developing a certain waxen blandness that makes it perfect for casual wear or for layering under more complex amber fragrances. It may not satisfy the niche hound, but for everyone else, this is a great amber option.\n\nPhoto by Ravi Patel on Unsplash\n\nAmbre Cuir (Henry Jacques)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nAmbre Cuir (‘Amber Leather’) exerts the sort of soapy, traditional shaving-cream appeal that will seduce men nostalgic for the feel of the leather strap and hot towel against their skin. Ambre Cuir proved to be the most praised Henry Jacques among the men of Basenotes during a 2018 Henry Jacques sample pass, and with good reason – it has one of the most natural opoponax notes I’ve smelled in oil form.\n\nOpoponax is a rather medicinal-smelling resin that smells partially cool, like herbal shaving foam, and partially warm, with an intensely spicy, balsamic underbite similar to cinnamon and clove. Here, the resin has been pulled in the direction of cool by way of lavender absolute up top and a stony frankincense-iris pairing in the heart.\n\nHandsome and acerbic, Ambre Cuir smells old-school in the most elegant way possible. Fans of Dia Man (Amouage) will likely love Ambre Cuir, as it possesses something of the same silvery, soapy refinement, and a similar way of grinding rough, sticky resins into a bone-pale powder using Florentine orris as grist.\n\nAmbrecuir (Sultan Pasha Attars)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nI would say that Ambrecuir is one of my favorites from the Sultan Pasha stable of mukhallats, but given the quality of his work, that is like throwing a pebble onto the beach and hoping to hit sand. Ambrecuir is essentially a plush ‘white’ leather crème cut here and there with the sour, fruity funk of castoreum. In theme, it riffs on the elegance of the contrast between the cool, powdered whiteness of orris butter and the rough blackness of varnished shoe leather as pioneered by Cuir Ottoman by Parfum d’Empire.\n\nWhere these fragrances diverge is in the drydown, when all traces of the creamy, iris suede have melted away. While Cuir Ottoman goes on to develop a rich, powdery hay-amber accord that makes one think of brocaded liveries and pompadours of Versailles, the sour castoreum pulsing through Ambrecuir’s amber keep us firmly in the souk, pressed up against the heaving mass of bodies. Indeed, fans of Rania J.’s Ambre Loup might appreciate Ambrecuir, as might lovers of Serge Lutens’ spicy Cuir Mauresque.\n\nSomething to note here – a pleasingly antiseptic saffron darts in and out of Ambrecuir’s base, cutting the richness of the other notes like a knife worth’s of dried blood and iodine. Without this spicy, medicinal note, Ambrecuir might have become as bloated as a corpse after a hot day in the river. It is this balance of sweet and medicinal notes that gives Ambrecuir its curious delicacy and refinement. The saffron-tinged amber also gives the mukhallat an ancestral link to the sternly vegetal, iodine-tinged ambers of Northern India, a category of fragrance that is one hundred percent sugar- and vanilla-free.\n\nA rich dulce de leche base brings it all home, though, turning away from Mother India and back towards Paris. Anyone familiar with the ridiculously rich dried-fruit amber and benzoin duet in Tom Ford’s Amber Absolute may feel tears come to their eyes. A gorgeous bastard child of leather and amber, Ambrecuir is for those who take their leather with a side of cream.\n\nAmbre Narcotique (Sultan Pasha Attars)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nAmbre Narcotique will induce a state of bliss in anyone who loves thick, spicy labdanum bombs such as Amber Absolute, Ambre Sultan, or Ambre Loup. It opens with the bitter, leathery aroma of labdanum resin, introducing an animalic dark chocolate note that gets my Spidey senses tingling. From that point onwards, however, this pleasantly bitter note is masked by a thick sieving of dusty benzoin, sweet myrrh (opoponax), and vanilla. If you love incensey ambers with spices, herbs, and rosy notes operating at a more subliminal level, then it doesn’t get much better than this.\n\nAmbre Sauvage (Sultan Pasha Attars)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nAmbre Sauvage is a smooth-as-silk amber with a nutty, slightly plasticized leather undertone to balance out the sweetness. In contrast to the dark, smoky incense of Ambre Narcotique, this amber showcases the buttery pleasure that is the marriage between a toffee-rich amber and a spanking new pair of leather brogues. Not terribly complex, but like a caramel mocha latte, it goes down so easily it is hard to begrudge its simplicity. Fans of L’Artisan Parfumeur’s L’Eau d’Ambre Extreme or Histoires de Parfums’ Ambre 114 will find their bliss here.\n\nPhoto by Klara Kulikova on Unsplash\n\nÂme Sombre Series (Sultan Pasha Attars)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nThe Âme Sombre series (Âme Sombre Oud Infusion, Âme Sombre Grade 1, and Âme Sombre Grade II) was conceived as a tribute to, well, Tribute – the landmark frankincense-cedar attar from Amouage that has such a cult following that people are willing to pay hundreds of dollars for even a sample of it. Naturally, when Amouage discontinued its line of attars, the desire for Tribute increased even further. Nothing enhances Holy Grail status for a scent like unattainability, scarcity, and the huge amounts of trouble one must go to in order to secure it. Luckily for us all, Sultan Pasha has stepped in with his take on the original Tribute.\n\nAll the Âme Sombre variations revolve around a beguilingly rich, dark frankincense note redolent of the pine-like smoke from the censer at High Mass. This frankincense is surrounded by a very good rose otto and voluptuous jasmine. The florals never succeed in speaking over the soaring voice of that dark, burnt lime peel frankincense – they simply add a buttery floral softness that pierces the gloom like sunlight through a stained glass window.\n\nIn the base, there is a growl of dark tobacco, ancient balsams, resins, and gums, which joined with cedar, provides a smoky bitterness, like burning driftwood and funeral pyres. The bitterness is alleviated somewhat by a low hum of amber and rock rose in the background, but never dies away completely.\n\nÂme Sombre Infusion Oud is the most expensive and opulent version of Âme Sombre. It rivals or even surpasses the cost of the original Tribute, due to the time-consuming and messy task of infusing a small quantity of Âme Sombre Grade I with smoke from sinking grade oud wood chips, which Sultan heated on a burner directly underneath the attar itself.\n\nThe Oud Infusion version therefore contains the uniquely clean, resinous aroma that comes from heating oud wood (as opposed to the fermented, ‘overripe’ aroma of pure oud oil). The oud infusion doubles down on the rich smokiness of the frankincense, but also offers a slightly green sweetness that serves to soften the essentially bitter character of the scent. This version, although expensive and now also possibly discontinued, is the most balanced version of Tribute, and my personal favorite.\n\nÂme Sombre Grade I and Âme Sombre Oud Infusion both relate closely to the original Tribute (albeit with a bigger emphasis on rose), and either would be an excellent substitute for the now discontinued attar. Âme Sombre Grade II differs quite dramatically from both the Oud Infusion and Grade I, but I like it a lot as a standalone scent and wish it had been marketed separately.\n\nÂme Sombre Grade I begins with an incredibly lush, lemony rose that has the effect of flooding the gloomy church corridors with light and air. Rose is usually added to oud to give it a sweet juiciness to counteract its sour, stark woodiness, and here it plays that role both for the austere, pine-like frankincense and the sourish cedar. Then a clutch of dark, balmy resins and leather notes moves in to draw a black velvet cloak over the bright, sourish rose, rendering the tone of the attar somber and serious. Grade I is slightly darker, more phenolic, and more sour-rosy in feel than the Oud Infusion, which draws sweet woodsmoke notes from the agarwood infusion. Grade I employs more of a focus on balmy leather notes than the other versions.\n\nOverall, Âme Sombre Grade I feels more Northern in tone than Middle-Eastern. There is a fresh juniper note in the background that further bolsters this ‘Orthodox Church in a chilly Northern forest’ tonality. In terms of overall approach, Âme Sombre Grade I is perhaps the closest to the original Tribute with its stark, smoky cedar-frankincense combination. It is also intensely powerful, lasting on my skin all day and well beyond a shower.\n\nÂme Sombre Grade II is more tobacco-focused than Ame Sombre Grade I and has a sharper rose element. When compared directly to Grade I, it reveals a big-boned, souk-ish amber-rose combination not a million miles away from sweet mukhallat-style fragrances like Raghba, Lateefa, and 24 Gold. Not that this style doesn’t have a rough-hued, sexy charm of its own, you understand. It is just that nobody in their right mind would pay Sultan Pasha prices for the kind of thing that sells for $30-$40 on eBay for 100 milliliters shipped.\n\nThe tobacco, powered by the super-powerful synthetic Kephalis, is dry, papery, and rather strident. Unlike Âme Sombre Oud Infusion and Âme Sombre Grade I, Ame Sombre Grade II contains a small quantity of synthetic aromachemicals. In some circles, this piece of information seems to have sunk this version of the attar as being low-quality or inferior to the other versions. I would argue mildly against that categorization because, although it contains some synthetics, it does not smell terribly inferior in quality. Admittedly, it does lack the smoky, aquiline mystery of the other two versions.\n\nStill, you get what you pay for, and who knows, you might just be in the market for a sweeter, friendlier version of Tribute. The severity of the original does not sit well with quite a few women, for example, so this version might be the right pick. In short, Âme Sombre Grade II is a pleasing rose-tobacco blend that would work well for people who like Wardasina or any of the Lateefa or 24 Gold scents – somewhat loud, rosy ambers that project a clear message of affability from a distance, thus perfect for clubbing.\n\nAnubis (NAVA)\n\nType: concentrated perfume oil\n\nCompany description: Egyptian Kyphi, Egyptian Amber, Egyptian Musk, Darkness of the Dead\n\nKyphi is a type of compacted incense used by the ancient Egyptians, consisting of herbs, gums, resins, and woods powdered down into dust, bound with wine and honey to form briquettes of incense, and subsequently burned on ceremonial censers.\n\nKyphi differs from other forms of incense and bakhoor mainly in its inclusion of unusual aromatics such as mastic, juniper berry, turpentine (pine resin), calamus, and rush reeds, as well as its binding agents of honey, raisins, and wine. Nowadays, scents referencing kyphi will normally use medicinal, bitter, or green resin notes that are not often seen in other types of incense. They will often include a wine, honey, or raisin facet too.\n\nAnubis opens with the same vegetable oil-like note noticeable in almost all the NAVA blends. Once this dissipates, the bitter herbaciousness of the kyphi rises to the fore, mingling with a low key amber-resin accord for body, and an attractively musty, medicinal undertone. True to the original raison d’être of kyphi, the blend smells purifying, albeit in a wispy, barely-there manner. In other words, this is not a heavy or rich blend. Its essential character is peppery and green – subtly bitter even.\n\nAnubis does get sweeter and muskier as time goes on, picking up a not entirely unpleasant headshoppiness in the process (I assume that the Darkness of the Dead accord has something to do with patchouli). Good, but I think I’d prefer this in an oil burner than as a personal fragrance.\n\nAttar al Kaaba (Al Haramain)\n\nType: mukhallat\n\nThis is one of Al Haramain’s bestsellers, and justifiably so. A fabulously thick, potent oil featuring a fruity pink rose, creamy sandalwood, and sweet amber, it paints a picture of eastern exotica in very broad brushstrokes. No oud, either real or fake, no matter what you think you may be smelling. However, there is a woodsy, almost coffee-like note swimming around in the syrup that’s deliberately open to misinterpretation, so if you want to close your eyes and pretend, then who am I to say otherwise?\n\nAttar al Kaaba is a great starter ambery mukhallat. A simple, and accessible and quite lovely rendition of the typical ‘attar’ smell, it will do the trick when you want to smell exotic and alluring in a slightly ‘foreign’ way. It is quite sweet, syrupy even, so don’t say I didn’t warn you.\n\nAbout Me: A two-time Jasmine Award winner for excellence in perfume journalism, I write a blog (this one!) and have authored many guides, articles, and interviews for Basenotes.

Thanks to the generosity of friends and acquaintances in the perfume business, I have been privileged enough to smell the raw materials that go into perfumes and learn about the role they play in both Western and Eastern perfumery. Artisans have sent vials of the most precious materials on earth such as ambergris, deer musk, and oud. But I have also spent thousands of my own money, buying oud oils directly from artisans and tons of dodgy (and possibly illegal) stuff on eBay. In the reviews sections, I will always tell you where my sample came from and whether I paid for it or not.\n\nSource of samples: I purchased my samples of Maison Anthony Marmin, Hyde & Alchemy, Mellifluence, Kuumba Made, Rasasi, Mr. Perfume, Al Haramain, NAVA and Universal Perfumes & Cosmetics. My samples of oils from Clive Christian, Abdes Salaam Attar and Sultan Pasha Attars were sent to me by the brands. The Aloes of Ish and Henry Jacques samples were sent to me by two separate but equally kind Basenotes friends.\n\nNote on monetization: My blog is not monetized.

There is some use of resins in Indian attar perfumery – resins are smoked dry as part of a ‘destructive distillation’ process that is conducted independently of the main attar distillation; this produces what is known as a ‘choya’, which is then added into the final attar distillate to lend a specific warm, smoky facet to the final result. However, the use of resins in Indian attar perfumery is minimal compared to Middle-Eastern mukhallat perfumery, where resins often play a significant, if not leading role in the character of its perfumes.\n\nMost of the resins used in Middle-Eastern mukhallat perfumery have healing, cleansing, and antioxidant properties, and have long been used in traditional medicine. Arabs chew frankincense tears as chewing gum to freshen the breath and aid digestion, for example, while Papiers d’Arménie owe their existence to a Frenchman by the name of Auguste Ponsot, who, after stumbling across benzoin resin during his travels in Armenia in 1885, decided to make benzoin-infused strips of paper to cleanse the air in stuffy rooms all across Paris. Both Arabs and Persians have long traditions of burning incense to fumigate their rooms, clothes, places of worship, and hair. The word perfume itself comes from the Latin per fumus, which means ‘through the smoke’, making it more than likely that the first rudimentary form of perfume was, in fact, the fumigation of a dwelling with incense. So put that on your burner and smoke it!\n\nPhoto by Andriy Tod on Unsplash\n\nThe role of resins in oil perfumery is to lend a blend a smoky, balsamic tone that provides both depth and fixative properties. To Westerners, resins simply smell exotic and mysterious. Our first exposure to them is likely through church where they are often burned on a priest’s censer. Resins are, of course, important in Western classic perfumery too. They form the bedrock of the ambery-balsamic family of perfumes formerly known as ‘oriental’, with resins such as labdanum and benzoin joining with vanilla to create the famous amber accord, recognizable to anyone who has ever smelled Shalimar by Guerlain. The principal resins used in Middle-Eastern mukhallat perfumery are described below.\n\nLabdanum (Cistus ladanifer) is the prime component of the amber accord in mukhallat (and indeed commercial) perfumery. Labdanum is the name for the sticky exudate that covers the entire plant of this shrubby rock rose that grows in mountainous Mediterranean regions such as Crete and Cyprus. In ancient times, the labdanum resin was transferred to the wool of grazing goats and sheep who brushed up against the shrub, and later, combed out of the animal’s hair by shepherds. These days, however, modern perfumery extraction methods are used, such as boiling the twigs and leaves of the plant to extract raw resin, solvent extraction to extract an absolute, or steam distillation to extract an essential oil (the different extraction methods produce results that all smell quite different to one another).\n\nLabdanum absolute is a wondrous raw material. It smells smoky, rich, incensey, leathery, and often displays an attractive salted caramel or toffee-like undertone. In terms of texture, it can either come across as extremely buttery (unctuous) or extremely dry (dusty). Under some lights, there is a slightly animalic, goaty facet to labdanum, but in and of itself, the scent of labdanum is not animalic.\n\nBenzoin is a sweet vanillic resin from two species of the styrax tree, the styrax tonkinensis (Siam benzoin) and styrax benzoin (from Sumatra). Siam benzoin is the one most widely used in perfumery, and it has a slightly sweet, dusty cinnamon aspect to it. In some lights, it smells like slightly woody vanilla. But benzoin resin has other subtler nuances such as brown sugar crystals, coffee, paper, and sometimes a wintergreen note like mastic or camphor. Benzoin added to an attar or mukhallat lends a balsamic, spicy-vanillic tonality. It plays an important role in the composition of the amber accord in perfumery.\n\nOpoponax, also known as sweet myrrh, is native to Somalia and Ethiopia. In its upper register at least, this is a resin that barely knows that it is a resin at all. In fact, it wants to be a spice or a herb, but can’t decide which, which is why the first flash of opoponax lurches wildly between the metallic, sweaty sting of clove and the aromatic camphor of bay leaf. Another layer is the ambery resinousness in its lower registers that smells like a rich toffee but also quite a bit like Disaronno, which gives it a boozy almond butter tonality that cracks the safe open a little to reveal how the drydowns of No. 5 (Chanel) and Shalimar (Guerlain) are actually constructed. There is even a hint of Johnson and Johnson’s Baby Powder or Baby Oil that lingers towards the very end.\n\nLater, the transition between the astringent spicy-herbal topnotes and the almond taffy basenotes makes things interesting. This clash of cymbals produces an old fashioned bay rhum effect that makes me think of amber mixed up with Old Spice or Brut. There is a lingering soapiness in among all that almond butter richness that calls to mind shaving foam. It is a confusing but ultimately loveable mash up of balsamic sweetness and rinsing herbal sourness. You get the gold honey of a resin and the aromatic rigor of a barbershop fougère.\n\nOpoponax (sweet myrrh) is not as medicinal as true myrrh but does have a rooty, almost herbal quality that sets it apart from the sweeter, creamier resins. It can smell green and coniferous, like fresh lavender buds crushed between finger and thumb, but with a warm, golden, balsamic tone underneath that marks it out as a resin rather than a herb. It is quite spicy, with a cinnamon bark facet, and a subtle soapiness in the lower register.\n\nFragrances that espouse the true spirit of opoponax in commercial perfumery include: Imperial Opoponax (Les Nereides), Ligea la Sirena (Carthusia), Or des Indes (Maître Parfumeur et Gantier), Eau Lente (Diptyque), Jicky and Shalimar (Guerlain), En Avion (Caron), Coco (Chanel), and Bengale Rouge (Papillon Perfumery).\n\nPhoto by Jack B on Unsplash\n\nAmber resin, from the Baltic pine tree, does not produce its own essential oil. In mukhallat perfumery, as in Western perfumery, amber is a fantasy composition rather than an actual raw material, its honeyed, resinous warmth suggested by a combination of labdanum, vanilla, and benzoin. The proportions of ingredients used in the amber formula will depend on the effect the perfumer is seeking: more labdanum to create a leathery, dusty amber, more benzoin to create a sweetly powdery one, and so on. Ambergris may have been used in the place of labdanum as part of a traditional amber accord, especially in earlier forms of mukhallats and attars, but for reason of cost and scarcity, this is no longer the case. Read Kafkaesque’s marvelous Guide to 50 amber fragrances to help you identify amber scents that pique your interest.\n\nThere is a fossilized amber resin oil available for use in attar perfumery, produced through the process of destructive distillation, quite similar to making a traditional Indian choya. In this process, the amber resin is burned and then distilled, producing a smoky, tarry-smelling oil. This is not a true essential oil of amber but a by-product of burning. Fossilized amber oil, when used in a perfume composition, produces a dark, balsamic effect, and must be dosed very carefully in order not to overwhelm the other notes. It is sometimes called black amber. A fragrance that famously uses this is Black Gemstone by 777 Stephane Humbert Lucas.\n\nPhoto: My own, of Boswellia sacra (frankincense) gums from Oman\n\nFrankincense, for many people, lies at the very tippety-top of the incense chain – the thoroughbred of the resin family. Deriving from the old French word franc encens – meaning ‘high quality incense’ – frankincense is a gum produced by the Boswellia genus of trees which grows in Somalia, Sudan, North Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula. The bulk of frankincense, called luban or loban in Arabic, comes from Somalia. However, the finest quality of frankincense is called Hojari (alternatively referred to as howjary) or silver frankincense, and this comes from the arid Dhofar region of Oman in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe steam-distilled oil of frankincense resin gives attars and perfumes a fresh, coniferous resinousness, with a bright lemon-and-lime topnote. Some grades of Omani frankincense smell like oranges or tangerines in their topnotes, with a soft-ish, creamy quality in the lower register. The house of Amouage, based in Oman, was founded around the use of local Hojari frankincense, and indeed, most of this house’s output showcases the silvery beauty of Omani frankincense.\n\nIn an interview with me for Basenotes in March 2018, Trygve Harris, a frankincense distiller in Oman, talked about the different aromas associated with the different types of frankincense. “Somali has a lemony note, and a warm dryness, an austerity. It makes me thirsty — it smells vast and dry. It reminds me of Palm Springs when I was a kid. The Omani has a richness, an opulence, like a treasure box. Regarding the differences in the Omani frankincense oils, I like to say the white (howjary) has more a green, herbal, butterfly note while the black has an orange floral spice aspect.”\n\nFrankincense is the note that many people, including me, tend to lump in with the larger category represented by the word incense. Technically, incense is any hard-ish material – be it a wood (sandalwood, oud wood) or a resin or gum (like myrrh, benzoin, copal, frankincense) – that can be slowly burned or smoked on a coal to produce a purifying but fragrant smoke. Fragrances classified as incense fragrances typically feature some ratio of frankincense to other resins, balsams, and gums (most typically myrrh, but also benzoin, labdanum, etc.), so many of the frankincense-themed fragrances are actually the standard ‘incensey’ mix of frankincense plus something else. Read my 2020 article on frankincense for a round-up of over 25 frankincense fragrances that are worth your time if you want to do a deep dive on this majestic resin.\n\nMyrrh is a gum produced by the Commiphorah myrrha species of tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and North-East Africa. Deriving from the Arabic word مر (mur), meaning ‘bitter’, myrrh oil is used all over Arabia, China, and India as a traditional medicine. Myrrh oil is quite different from myrrh resin. Myrrh oil can be bitter, rubbery-smelling, and often quite saline (mushroomy). The resin smells earthier, slightly sweet, with musty undertones – when lit, it smells quite smoky (well, duh).\n\nWhat does myrrh smell like? While frankincense is a soaring series of sunny, high-pitched notes like lime peel or crushed pine needles, myrrh is dark, fungal, and gloomy, reminding one of the dark shadows behind massive stone pillars in a cathedral, signed pine, tar, anise, licorice, and the scent of freshly-sliced ceps. It can be soapy, fatty, or rooty. In perfumery, myrrh lends a subtle, earthy tone pitched halfway between soil and stone. It has a sepulchral quality, leading some to categorize it as Gothic or moldy.\n\nSome facets of myrrh are intensely bitter, while some smell like sweet licorice, anise, or rubber. Often the resin smells latex-y and saline (in cookery terms, if frankincense is a citrus fruit, myrrh is volcanic salt). Personally, I often perceive myrrh as smelling ‘hollow’, as if there were a tear in the fabric of the fragrance where the aroma is supposed to be (a sort of negative space). Myrrh has a deeply atmospheric smell, redolent of the air inside centuries-old European cathedrals. Read my 2020 article on myrrh for a round-up of 27 myrrh fragrances that, together, form a whole education on the scent of myrrh.\n\nStyrax is a sweet, ambery gum that comes from the tree known as Liquidamber orientalis native to Turkey. It produces a rich, balsamic oil with leathery properties. It shares a rich, heady sweetness with benzoin resin, a variety of which is called Styrax benzoin because of its commonalities with true styrax resin.\n\nOther gums such as copal, copaiba, tolu, and peru balsam are used to a lesser extent in mukhallat perfumery, possibly because, with the exception of copal, they are species not native to the Middle-East or Africa and therefore always had to imported.\n\nCopal possesses a bay-leaf bitterness that adds a pleasantly animalic bite to amber accords. It is the prime component in Norma Kamali’s famous Incense, considered the behemoth of incense fragrances. Copaiba is a woody, pungent resin from a tree native to South America, and is only rarely used in mukhallats. Peru balsam, also native to South America, is a resinous, sweet-smelling gum with earthy, almost bitter basenotes of cinnamon bark, almond, and green olives. Tolu balsam is similar, but softer and velvetier. All these resins come primarily from South America, although copal is also found in Eastern Africa. They therefore tend to be more popular in Western interpretations of resinous-balsamic perfumery than in Middle-Eastern mukhallat perfumery itself. These balsams add a voluptuous, velvety sweetness and depth to ambery-balsamic compositions.\n\nAbout Me: A two-time Jasmine Award winner for excellence in perfume journalism, I write a blog (this one!) and have authored many guides, articles, and interviews for Basenotes.
