Genera)?\n\nIn the context of botanical taxonomy, the Genus (plural Genera) rank is a taxonomic rank that is used to classify groups of related species within a Family. Genera are based on a set of shared morphological, anatomical, and genetic characteristics, such as flower structure, fruit type, and leaf morphology. The Genus rank is situated between Family and Species in the hierarchy of taxonomic ranks.\n\nEach Genus can include one or more species. Genera are used to group species of plants that share common traits and evolutionary histories, allowing botanists to better understand the relationships between different groups of plants.\n\nSome examples of Genera in botanical taxonomy include Rosa, which includes the different species of roses, and Solanum, which includes the different species of nightshades, such as tomato and eggplant.
