        "text": "Ghazanfar, S. A. & Edmondson, J. R (Eds). (2014) Flora of Iraq, Volume 5 Part 2: Lythraceae to Campanulaceae.\n\nMorphology General Habit\n\nPlant tall, erect to 2 m\n\nMorphology Stem\n\nStem stiff, terete, sulcate or striate, glabrous or sparingly pilose below, corymbosely branched above Stem leaves similar but smaller, segments ovate-elongate, broadest near base and tapering above with a regularly serrate, cartilaginous border, largest terminal, which may be up to 10 × 4.5 cm, and occasionally lobed on one or both sides near the base; lower pinnae with 1or rarely 2 pairs of pinnules; some or all segments decurrent along the main axis\n\nMorphology Branches\n\nBranches terete, glabrous, the lower alternate, the upper opposite or verticillate\n\nMorphology Leaves\n\nBasal leaves bipinnate, deltoid-ovate, to 60 cm long, long-petiolate Leaf surfaces, including veins of lower surface, almost or quite glabrous Uppermost leaves reducing to sheaths\n\nMorphology Leaves Petiole\n\nPetioles of lower leaves with dense papillate hairs, which are very sparse on the rhachis of upper leaves\n\nMorphology Reproductive morphology Inflorescences\n\nUmbels several, with 14–20 glabrous rays, rays 1.5–5 cm Partial umbels 10–12-flowered\n\nMorphology Reproductive morphology Inflorescences Bracts\n\nBracts and bracteoles few, small and caducous\n\nMorphology Reproductive morphology Flowers Pedicel\n\nFruiting pedicels 3–6 mm\n\nMorphology Reproductive morphology Fruits\n\nFruit ovoid, 9–12 × 6–7 mm, glabrous, valleculae with 1 or 2 broad, dark vittae, those of the commissural face more conspicuous\n\nDisc\n\nDisk much flattened, crenulate-edged\n\nMorphology Reproductive morphology Flowers Gynoecium Style\n\nStyles very short, glabrous, closely deflexed upon and subequalling the disk.\n\nEcology\n\nBy roadside in the mountains, on banks of irrigation canals; alt. 800–850 m\n\nPhenology\n\nFlowering and fruiting: Jun.\n\nDistribution\n\nOccasional in the SE sector of the lower forest zone of Iraq. Turkey (E Anatolia), Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, NW, C & S Iran.\n\nNote\n\nProbably not distinct from O. hispidus. The Edinburgh sheet of Haines 509 has scattered hairs on the lower leaf surfaces and along the veins, while the Kew sheet is quite glabrous. Insufficient fruiting material has been seen to judge the reliability of the fruit characters given by Boissier; population studies in both species are needed.\n\n[FIQ]"
