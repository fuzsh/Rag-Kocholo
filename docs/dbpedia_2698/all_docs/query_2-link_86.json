        "text": "Introduction to the Apiaceae Family\n\nThe Apiaceae family is widespread globally but is particularly common in north temperate zones. It is well known for its many edible foods and herbs, including carrots, celery, parsley, dill, and many, many more. Most plants have a characteristic smell and possess small flowers in umbels, making the family fairly easy to spot in the field. The Apiaceae are part of the Apiales order of core dicot flowering plants. The very closely related Araliaceae family has many overlapping characteristics. In general, though, Apiaceae are usually herbs that produce dry schizocarps, while the Araliaceae are usually shrubs or trees and usually produce berry-like drupes.\n\nFlowers of the Apiaceae\n\nPlants are usually hermaphrodite but may also be andromonoecious, polygamomonoecious, or dioecious (Acronema). Pollination is entomophilous. Numerous small flowers are almost always in a characteristic flat-topped terminal cymose umbel(s). Otherwise, inflorescences are sometimes in cymose heads or rarely reduced to a single flower. Inflorescences may be pseudanthial and often associated with sterile flowers at the periphery and may or may not have involucral bracts. Flowers are usually actinomorphic but may be zygomorphic at the umbel edge. The petals are unequal in size, with those pointing outwards from the umbel larger than those pointing in. Flowers are usually fairly small, possess bracts, and may be regular to slightly irregular in the corolla. Flowers are usually perfectly 5-merous (except for the gynoecium) and are tetracyclic. Free hypanthium is not present. The perianth usually has a distinct calyx and corolla (but the calyx is often very reduced). The perianth may be sepaline (corolla rarely absent) or petaline (calyx teeth sometimes absent) with 4–10 parts in two (or one) isomerous whorls. The calyx, when detectable, has five parts in one whorl that may be free or connate (often reduced to a rim but never forming a tube). Sepals are persistent and may be lobulate, blunt-lobed, or toothed. The corolla also has five parts in one whorl. The white, yellow, pink, or purple petals are always free, valvate, and may be unequal or regular.\n\nAndroecium of the Apiaceae\n\nThe androecium has five members (all stamens) that are free of the perianth and each other. They are all equal to unequal and are found in 1 whorl. Their five stamens are all fertile, isomerous with the perianth, oppositisepalous, and inflexed in bud. Anthers are dorsifixed or basifixed, introrse, tetrasporangiate, and dehisce via longitudinal slits.\n\nGynoecium of the Apiaceae\n\nThe gynoecium is 2 carpelled, and the pistil is one or two-celled. The gynoecium is synovarious, median, and inferior. The ovary is 2(1) locular. An epigynous disk is present. Two apical styles are free to partly joined, with their bases thickened into one or two stylopodia that crown the ovary. Stigmas are wet type, non-papillate, and Group IV type. Placentation is either axile or apical. There are 1 or 2 ovules per locule (usually 2 with 1 abortive) that are pendulous and either epitropous or anatropous. Ovules have ventral raphe, are non-arillate, unitegmic, and are tenuinucellate or pseudocrassinucellate.\n\nFruit of the Apiaceae\n\nThe fruits of the Apiaceae are non-fleshy dry schizocarps with 2 mericarps that are united facially. The mericarps are 1-seeded in each part, with the integument sometimes united with the pericarp. Seeds are oily and endospermic.\n\nHabit & Leaf Form of the Apiaceae\n\nPlants are usually soft-stemmed aromatic annual, biennial, or perennial herbs, but some have tough stems, and a few are even woody tree-like or shrubby species in the tropics. Stems are hollow between leaf joints and are often ribbed (Angelica, Celery). Sometimes they are switch-plants, occasionally with the principal photosynthesizing function transferred to stems (e.g., Platysace compressa) or phyllodineous (petiole or rachis performs leaf function) (e.g., Lilaeopsis). Leaves are usually well-developed but can be reduced in switch forms. Plants are usually non-succulent but occasionally can be succulent (e.g., Crithmum) and may or may not have a basal aggregation of leaves. They can be helophytic, mesophytic, or xerophytic (e.g. Eryngium). Plants may be conspicuously heterophyllous (e.g., Apium inundatum) or not. Leaves are small to large and arranged alternate or alternate and opposite (usually just opposite on upper leaves). Leaves are usually herbaceous but may occasionally be leathery or rarely fleshy. Their attachment to the stem is either petiolate or sometimes perfoliate or peltate, more or less sheathing with sheaths that have free margins and may or may not be pulvinate. Leaves may or may not be gland-dotted and are usually fetid, and only rarely are they odorless. Leaf arrangement may be simple or compound ternate, imparipinnate, bipinnate, multiply compound, or rarely palmate. Lamina, when simple, is usually dissected pinnatifid (usually), palmatifid (in Sanicula, Astrantia, Eryngium), or spinose (Eryngium), but sometimes may be entire. They are pinnately, palmately, or parallel-veined. Leaves are usually exstipulate (but sometimes with stipular flanges) or sometimes stipulate (Hydrocotyloideae).\n\nUses of Apiaceae\n\nMany are used for culinary purposes, including Daucus (carrot), Pastinaca (parsnip), Apium (celery), Petroselinum (parsley), Pimpinella (anise), Carum (caraway), Anethum (dill), Anthriscus (chervil), Foeniculum (fennel) and Levisticum (lovage) to name some of the more common ones. Ornamental ones include Eryngium, Angelica, Heracleum, Trachymene, etc but note that many ornamentals have been modified and have enlarged bracts or sepals and are not representative of the family. Many have useful medicinal purposes to treat a wide variety of ailments, yet others have notoriously poisonous resins or alkaloids such as Cicuta, Conium (hemlocks), Aethusa (fool’s parsley), and others are phototoxic (Heracleum mantegazzianum).\n\nMorphology of Apiaceae in North America\n\nApiaceae Species I have Covered So Far\n\nApioideae Subfamily\n\nAzorelloideae Subfamily\n\nSaniculoideae Subfamily\n\nTaxonomy of Apiaceae\n\n3789-3820 spp in 440-446 genera of the Apiales Order of the core Eudicots. This family is divided into four main subfamilies.\n\nApioideae – The largest subfamily and a diverse group of annual to perennial herbs or subshrubs or rarely to a small tree. Leaves are usually palmately divided but may be pinnate or simple and entire. Venation is pinnate, but some have parallel. Fruits are variable and may or may not be flattened, winged, or ribbed. Cosmopolitan distribution.\n\nAzorelloideae – Annual herbs or small shrubs, often hummock-forming. Leaves are simple, trifid to palmately lobed, stipulate. Fruit with wings or ribs where the wings or ribs are the largest. Mostly South American, particularly the Patagonia region.\n\nMackinlayoideae – Annual herbs to shrubs. Leaves may or may not be pedately compound, palmate to simple, and are stipulate. Fruit is drupaceous and often laterally compressed. Mostly Old World Tropics.\n\nSaniculoideae – A diverse group of annual herbs and subshrubs to trees. Leaves may be tripinnately or palmately compound or simple and often pamately lobed, and some have hairy or spiny teeth. Inflorescences are usually simple umbels or capitulum, and bracts may be foliaceous or petaloid. Fruits may be barely to strongly compressed dorsally or laterally, may have 2-3 wings, or maybe scaly or spiny. Cosmopolitan distribution.\n\nGenera:\n\nApioideae: Aciphylla (46), Acronema (34), Actinanthus (1), Actinolema (2), Adenosciadium (1), Aegokeras (1 inc Olymposciadium), Aegopodium (11 inc Chamaele),

However, some more common differences include the fact that the Apiaceae are usually herbs vs usually shrubs and trees in the Araliaceae, the leaves that usually lack stipules in Apiaceae vs usually present in Araliaceae, and the fruit is a dry schizocarp with two mericarps vs a berry-like drupe in the Araliaceae.\n\nDistribution of Apiaceae\n\nThe Apiaceae are found in frigid to tropical zones and are cosmopolitan but mainly North temperate.\n\nDistribution of Apiaceae in the Americas\n\nCanadian Genera Include:\n\nApioideae:Aegopodium 1 of 11 Eurasian spp intro all S Canada exc AB, Labrador; Aethusa monospecific European sp intro ON, QC, NB, NS; Anethum 1 of 2 Mediterranean spp intro all S provinces exc NS, NB, PE, NL; Angelica 9 of 104 N temperate spp native all of Canada (& GL) exc SK, MB; Anthriscus 3 of 13 mostly Eurasian spp intro BC, ON, QC, NB, NS NL (exc Labrador); Apium 1 of 12 temperate & subtropical Old World & SAM spp native extirpated NS; Astrantia 1 of 11 S European spp intro NL (exc Labrador); Berula 1 of 6 subcosmopolitan spp native BC, ON; Bunium 1 of 32 Mediterranean & Indian spp intro NL?; Bupleurum 2 of 213 sub cosmopolitan spp native YT, AB, NT, BC intro QC, ON; Carum 1 of 22 Eurasian spp intro all Canada exc YT, Labrador; Chaerophyllum 3 of 69 mostly N temperate spp intro BC, native ON, QC?; Cicuta 4 of 4 N temperate spp native all of Canada inc Arctic; Cnidium 1 of 8 mostly E Asian spp native BC, YT, NT; Conioselinum 2 of 16 N temperate spp native BC, ON, NL, NB, NS, PE; Conium 1 of 6 mostly Eurasin spp intro BC, AB, SK, ON, QC, NB, NS; Conopodium 1 of 8 Eurasian spp intro NL (exc Labrador); Coriandrum 1 of 2 Middle East spp intro ON, QC, NS; Cryptotaenia 1 of 6 mostly African spp a former NAM endemic native in MB, ON, QC, extirpated NB, now intro Austria; Cymopterus 1 of 44 NAM endemic spp native BC?, AB, SK, MB; Daucus 1 of 43 cosmopolitan spp native BC intro rest of S provinces; Erigenia monospecific E NAM endemic sp native ON; Foeniculum 1 of 3 Mediterranean spp intro BC, ON, QC, cultivated fennel; Glehnia monospecific E Asia & NW NAM sp native BC; Heracleum 4 of 83 mostly Eurasian spp inc 1 sp native all Canada exc NU and 3 spp intro BC, YT, ON, QC, NB, NS, PE, NL (exc Labrador); Levisticum monospecific Middle Eastern sp intro AB, ON, QC, NS; Ligusticum 6 of 40 N temperate spp native BC, ON, QC, NL, NS, NB, PE, NU (& GL); Lilaeopsis 2 of 13 Americas & Australasia spp native BC, NS; Lomatium 20 of 101 W+C NAM endemic spp native BC, AB, SK, MB; Musineon 1 of 6 spp C NAM endemic spp native AB, SK, MB; Myrrhis monospecific S Europe sp intro BC, ON, NS, NL (exc Labrador); Oenanthe 1 of 33 mostly N temperate spp native BC; Osmorhiza 6 of 12 mostly Americas spp native all of Canada, 1 sp native temperate Asia; Oxypolis 2 of 4 NAM endemic spp native BC, ON; Pastinaca 1 of 15 Eurasian spp intro all of Canada exc NU, Labrador; Perideridia 1 of 13 NAM endemic spp native BC, AB, SK; Petroselinum monospecific Mediterranean sp (parsley) intro BC, ON; Peucedanum (inc Imperatoria) 1 of 71 Eurasian spp intro ON, NS; Pimpinella 2 of 152 Old World spp intro AB, ON, QC, NB, NS, NL (exc Labrador); Podistera 2 of 4 temperate NE Asia & NW NAM spp native YT, NT; Scandix 1 of 12 Mediterranean & C Asia spp intro BC?, SK?, ON?; Sium 1 of 10 N temperate spp native all Canada inc Arctic, exc Labrador; Taenidia 1 of 2 E NAM endemic spp native ON, QC; Thaspium 3 of 4 E NAM endemic spp native ON, NS; Torilis 3 of 14 Old World spp intro BC, ON, QC; Yabea monospecific W NAM endemic sp native BC; Zizia 2 of 3 N NAM endemic spp native all S Canada ex PE, NL, inc YT.
