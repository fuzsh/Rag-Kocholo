        "text": "Today marks the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples. This is my pencil drawing of the Banao Indigenous Community of Kalinga, Philippines, to whom I'm forever grateful: they shared with me their flower - Rafflesia banaoana - and their wisdom. Thank you friends üôèüèª\n\nA collection of my most recent watercolour paintings of Rafflesia. The world's largest flowers come in a range of shapes, sizes and colours that are irresistible to the botanical artist!\n\nA couple of watercolours I've just completed depicting Philippine endemic Rafflesia - some of the world's 'smallest largest flowers' - spanning less than a stretched hand:\n\nThe most beautiful wild iris I ever saw: Bismarck's iris (Iris bismarckiana) in the hills of Nazareth in 2018. Its white standards mirror the sky while the falls are a chessboard of champagne and claret - and the whole thing filigreed to perfection.\n\nA watercolour painting of a pitcher plant (Nepenthes chaniana) I've just completed. I always include the dead and dying leaves because, as every natural history illustrator knows, nothing brings life to the page like death. A lot of love went into this one - hope you like it x"
