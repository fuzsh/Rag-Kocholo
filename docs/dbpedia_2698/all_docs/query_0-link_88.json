        "text": "The note opopanax has always kind of puzzled me. I'm not sure exactly what it smells like, nor do I reference it to one particular fragrance that I have smelled or owned. It's one of those notes that I just...well, haven't really paid a lot of attention to.\n\nI am starting to look at Eau Lente by Diptyque, mostly because of the numerous recommendations on the Cinnamon thread I posted a while ago - but in the reviews both Vibert and Pluran (two reviewers who's opinions I respect) mentioned EL is an opopanax prominent scent.\n\nSo, tell me some more fragrances that feature this mystery note prominently - so I have some frame of reference, before I venture forth.\n\nMike,\n\nWhile Opopanax (Commiphora erythraea) and Myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) are closely related--they are both part of the Burseraceae family--they are two different plants which produce different resinoids and essential oils with somewhat similar, but also significantly difference scent profiles. The Commiphora erythraea from which Opopanax is derived is a tall tree, while the Commiphora Myrrha from which Myrrh is derived is a smaller more shrub-like tree with knotted branches and fragrant leaves and flowers. Both are native to Somalia and Ethiopia, while Myrrh is also native to Yemen and has a geographical extensiveness over a greater area than Opopanax.\n\nThe confusion occurs easily because Opopanax goes by the synonyms of Sweet Myrrh and Bisabol Myrrh. The fragrant material for both Opopanax and Myrrh--an oleo gum resin--is harvested by incisions in the trunks of the respective trees. Opopanax oleo gum resin dries quickly when exposed to air to form tear-shaped dark reddish brown lumps, while myrrh hardens to a dark brown withered clumps.\n\nThe Opopanax resinoid has powdery, sweet, balsamic, woody and root-like odor, while the Myrrh resinoid has a rich, spicy, warm balsamic odor with no hints of woody or root-like odor. A resinoid is the oleo gum resin after it has been processed by solvents such as hexane or petroleum.\n\nThe major similarities and difference with regard to the essential oil derived from these two related plants are as follows: Both Opopanax and Myrrh have a warm and spicy sweet balsamic component to their scent profiles, but the former also has an animalic component absent in Myrrh, while Myrrh has a bitter, medical component absent in Opopanax.\n\nOpopanax is used widely in the liqueurs to add sweetness, body, and wine-like notes, while Myrrh is used widely as a flavoring agent in pharmaceutical products and in food and beverages that require a bitter flavoring component.\n\nBest regards,\n\nscentemental\n\nWhile Opopanax (Commiphora erythraea) and Myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) are closely related--they are both part of the Burseraceae family--they are two different plants which produce different resinoids and essential oils with somewhat similar, but also significantly difference scent profiles.

I am not certain if this is a different species or just a new name. To me, my recent samples labled EO of C. guidotti seem quite different from an older sample of EO from C. erythraea; more like EO of C. myrrha.\n\nRecently, what vendors are selling as Opoponax is described as essential oil of C. guidotti not C. erythraea.

These trees are, after all, found over a significantly large geographical area that would compound species differentiation.\n\nPlace--climate, soil, and altitude--has a significant bearing on species differentiation and hence essential oil differentiation. Factor into the equation the way these materials which eventually produce the essential oils are processed (always a significant factor in the final scent profile of the essential oil) and one can see why there is such a great variance from one eo to another.\n\nscentemental\n\nIn answer to the other part of your question Mike, here are some fragrances with opoponax. The boldfaced ones should give you a good sense of opoponax:\n\nArmani Attitude\n\nBurberry London for Men\n\nCdG Patchouli (Luxe Series)\n\nCdG Tar\n\nChanel Bois d’Iles\n\nChanel Coco Mademoiselle\n\nChanel Pour Monsieur Concentrée\n\nCzech & Speake Cuba\n\nDior Poison\n\nEau d'Italie Bois d'Ombrie\n\nEau d'Italie Paestum Rose\n\nElizabeth Arden Sandalwood\n\nEtro Shaal Nur\n\nFrédéric Malle Editions de Parfume French Lover\n\nGendarme Rage\n\nGucci Envy for Men\n\nGuerlain Cologne du 68\n\nJo Malone Pomegranate Noir\n\nKenzo Flower\n\nLes Néréides Impérial Opoponax\n\nLorenzo Villoresi Incensi\n\nLorenzo Villoresi Sandalo\n\nSanta Maria Novella Opoponax\n\nYSL Opium\n\nYver Rocher Voile d’Ambre EDP\n\n​\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf you want opopanax, LC is the place to get it big time.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nYou should also try, Ligea \"La Sirena\" by Carthusia.\n\nCertainly Lagerfeld Classic and Diptyque's Eau Lente. To get a sense of opononax's difference from myrrh, you might want to contrast Eau Lente with Diptyque's L'Eau Trois, which has a substantial myrrh component to it.\n\nscentemental\n\nLabdanum gum is derived from the Cistus plant which belongs to the family Cistacae; it’s scientific botanical name is Cistus ladanifer. Cistus is basically a small evergreen shrub with leaves that are white and furry on the underside and with fragrant white flowers. Labdanum gum is a natural oleoresin that is obtained by boiling the leaves and twigs of the plant that exude the oleoresin. It is then processed by solvents to produce an absolute that is complex and multivalent with a somewhat mossy, balsamic odor that’s rich and sweet, with animalic (ambergris-like) and somewhat incensy (think frankincense and myrrh notes) undertones, as well as leathery notes. Because of this multivalent complexity, it is frequently used to bolster the mossy, leather, ambergris elements of fragrances and is also considered one of the best of all the fixatives mixing seamlessly with oakmoss and patchouli to produce a rich, warm, intimate, all-encompassing mossy-earthy, animalic basenote accord of great depth and amplitude.\n\nThe Cistus essential oil is produced from the steam distillation of the crude Labdanum gum or by direct steam distillation of the leaves and twigs themselves. The essential oil, as opposed to the absolute, tends to have a drier more musky, mossy scent. Cistus/Labdanum also goes by the name of European Rock Rose.\n\nscentemental\n\nP.S. Labdanum is one of the oldest fragrance materials going all the way back--thousands of years ago, in fact--to the time of the Pharaohs when was it used by the ancient Egyptians in their Kyphi mixtures. Legend has it that during this time, the labdanum resin was harvested by shepherds from the wool of sheep and hair of goats that had grazed on the cistus shrubs and was sold in local markets and to traders who then took it to other lands. The beards one typically sees in depictions of Pharaohs, were actually false beards made of the labdanum soaked wool of sheep or the labdanum soaked hair of goats."
