Place a towel over your head and the bowl, close the eyes and breathe.\n\nCoughs: Dry up mucous and relieve spasmodic cough. See Chest Calm Balm in recipes tab.\n\nPerfume: I love the scent of opopanax! Try blending it with sandalwood and vanilla CO2 to make a beautiful perfume.\n\nSore Throat: Relief for sore throat. See Sore Throat Ease in recipes tab.\n\nRECIPES\n\nChest Calm Balm\n\n10 drops opopanax\n\n6 drops black pepper\n\n6 drops cedarwood (Juniperus virginiana)\n\n7 drops frankincense (Boswellia carterii)\n\n6 drops orange\n\n1/2 oz. beeswax\n\n2 oz. jojoba\n\n1 oz shea butter\n\nDirections: Place the beeswax, and jojoba in a Pyrex glass-measuring cup. Fill a stockpot 1/4 of the way with water and bring to a boil. Place the Pyrex in the pot of water and wait for the beeswax to melt into the jojoba. Once the beeswax is melted, add the shea butter and melt. Be sure none of the water from the pot boils into the Pyrex container.\n\nWhen the shea butter is melted, remove from heat. Add the remaining essential oils and stir well with a glass stir rod or a wooden chopstick.\n\nPour into small glass containers or tin containers. This recipe makes 3.5 ounces of salve.\n\nSore Throat Ease\n\n4 drops opopanax\n\n6 drops sandalwood\n\n1 oz. jojoba\n\nDirections: Blend the above ingredients into a 1 oz. container. Gently rub onto neck area to help relieve sore throat. Use as often as needed.\n\nSAFETY\n\nNon-toxic and generally non-irritating, but may cause sensitization and skin irritation in some people. Caution against using it on children under 2 years, and hypersensitive, diseased or damaged skin. IFRA (International Fragrance Association) used to claimed that Opoponax was phototoxic. Tisserand states that recently, IFRA has dropped the idea of Opopanax being phototoxic.\n\nIf pregnant, nursing or under a doctorâ€™s care, consult your physician or clinical certified aromatherapist. For external use only. Keep away from mucous membranes & eyes. Test a small amount on skin for allergic reaction. Keep out of reach of children. Avoid using on infants and small children under the age of five.\n\nAlways dilute essential oils with a carrier oil."
