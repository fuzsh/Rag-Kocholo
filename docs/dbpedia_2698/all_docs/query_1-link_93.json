Branches are usually grey-brown with prominent white spots and grow in a zigzag shape. The yellowish-green to pure green leaves are ferny with 1 to 6 pairs of leaf \"branches,\" each with 5 to 20 pairs of narrow, rounded, and up to 0.3 inches (8 mm) long leaflets. Thorns are found in pairs at each leaf's base and grow up to 4 inches (10 cm) long. The golden yellow to orange flowers are ball-shaped, up to 0.4 inches (1 cm) wide, and appear on stalks. Flowering occurs throughout the year but is most abundant from fall to spring.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nHow to Grow and Care\n\nAcacia requires full sunlight and grows in nearly any soil, including sand, clay, or highly alkaline or acidic soil. Although Acacia prefers well-drained soil, it tolerates muddy soil for short periods. Acacia is a plant-it-and-forget-it type of tree, although a young tree may need protection from wildlife while developing its defense system. During the first year, the tree benefits from an orchid fertilizer every three to four weeks. After that time, you can feed the tree a general-purpose fertilizer once every year, but it isn't an absolute requirement. Acacia requires little or no water.\n\nAcacia may need occasional pruning during the dry months. Avoid pruning leafy, green areas, and trim only dead growth.\n\nAlthough the tree is disease-resistant, it can sometimes be affected by a fungal disease known as anthracnose. Additionally, watch for pests such as aphids, thrips, mites, and scales.\n\nSee more at How to Grow and Care for Acacia.\n\nOrigin\n\nVachellia farnesiana is native to the southern United States, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America.\n\nBack to genus Vachellia\n\nPlantpedia: Browse flowering plants by Scientific Name, Common Name, Genus, Family, USDA Hardiness Zone, or Origin\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nClick on a photo to see a larger version."
