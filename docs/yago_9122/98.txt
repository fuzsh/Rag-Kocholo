Thanks to Bellock at DesmontandoHollywood for tipping us to the trailer for Map of the Sounds of Tokyo, directed by Isabel Coixet (Elegy).

Ryu is a solitary girl whose fragile appearance is in stark contrast with the double life she leads, working nights at a Tokyo fish market and sporadically taking on jobs as a hit-woman. Mr. Nagara is a powerful impresario mourning the loss of his daughter Midori, who has committed suicide. He blames David, a Spaniard who runs a wine business in Tokyo. Mr. Nagara‚Äôs emplyee, Ishida, was silently in love with Midori and hires Ryu to murder David. A sound engineer, obsessed with the sounds of the Japanese city and fascinated with Ryu, witnesses this love story which searches the shadow of the human soul, reaching deep into places where only silence has the power of eloquence.

Or, as IMDb would have it: “A dramatic thriller that centers on a fish-market employee who doubles as a contract killer.”

Rinko Kikuchi as Ryu heads the international cast. Map of the Sounds of Tokyo premieres in Cannes later this month.
