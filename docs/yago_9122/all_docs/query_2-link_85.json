        "text": "#Eritrea: Rare film industry news out of Eritrea. The country sent a delegation to participate in the 5th International Film Festival in Sanya, China, which took place from December 16 to 22, 2023, screening films from 109 countries. The Eritrean delegation's involvement included meetings and conversations with festival organizers, writers, directors, actors, and critics. Additionally, Eritrea was been invited to submit films for the next festival event in 2024. Why is this newsworthy? Some context: Eritrea's film industry has a history that dates back to the country's colonial period under Italian rule. This influence is evident in the early development. European influence continues to this day, as seen in events like \"European Film Week,\" which has been held annually for about 20 years in Asmara, Eritrea's capital city. Organized by the Delegation of the European Union in Eritrea, in collaboration with the Embassies of France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden, every year a selection of European movies is screened. In recent years, there's been a shift towards locally made movies gaining popularity over productions from typically Bollywood and Hollywood. It's part of the country's ongoing efforts to establish a distinct cinematic identity and narrative. Eritrea's participation in the International Film Festival in Sanya, China, where over 4,000 films from 109 countries were showcased, could be seen as a significant step in its efforts to engage with the global film community, learning from and contributing to the international film landscape. Keep in mind that, after primarily Italian occupation followed by British military administration, Eritrea officially declared its independence (from Ethiopia) in 1993. Essentially, Eritrea is relatively young as an independent nation with an even younger distinct Eritrean cinema culture. [Photo courtesy of the Eritrean Ministry Of Information]\n\nTribute to film industry 819 The happiness of many people is often found in specific areas, and it’s no surprise that the film industry is one of them. For over 60 years, this industry has thrived across various languages. It's well known that the story is the lifeblood of a film. When the screenplay is well-crafted, a good producer steps in, actors and actresses are selected, and the film is brought to life by a talented director and technical artists. The audience's recognition and judgment elevate the artists. Today, the film industry remains immensely popular. Educated graduates and young individuals pursue their favorite careers in this field by studying in film colleges. Many aspire to become directors, editors, cinematographers, or actors. The opportunities in these fields are growing, particularly as films are translated into multiple languages and reach a global audience. Entertainment, whether on television or the big screen, should cater to everyone. It is important to avoid excessive violence and glamour and instead create scenes that are suitable for all viewers. I appreciate economically produced films with high budgets, but it is equally important to ensure that our culture is respected and preserved. The film industry is a significant source of entertainment and should be appreciated as such. While we should admire and acknowledge the talents of artists, it’s important not to idolize them excessively. I hold great respect for the talents of every artist, and I will always appreciate their work. This week, I am posting this on my Blogs K. Raghavan. See you again next week, 27-5-24.\n\nThe (+65) Film Project What have I been up to lately? Where should I start? I have been writing a Horror Sci-fi script for a German director. I submitted two scripts for grants in February and January: one a drama and the other a psychological thriller. However, the biggest project I am currently working on is the (+65) Film Project, co-organized by FoundFilms and the Singapore Film Society. Today, we hosted our first-ever roundtable, the Actors' Roundtable, featuring renowned Singaporean actors such as Tay Ping Hui, Lim Yu-Beng, Irene Ang, and Sivakumar Palakrishnan. It was an absolute pleasure to connect with them and have them as guests for the roundtable. And, of course, our moderator was none other than Kenneth Tan, a well-known figure in the industry. The two hours flew by effortlessly as we listened to their conversations about their individual journeys. Each journey was different, but they shared many similar sentiments. They discussed inclusivity, the culture of acting in Singapore, actors' welfare, the changes and constants for actors in Singapore, the blurred lines between acting and being an influencer, and much more. As I listened in, I couldn't help but think how surreal the experience was. I have always been the kind of person who wants others to speak up and address issues that are close to our hearts. I love when important and intelligent conversations take place for the betterment of not just a particular profession or issue, but society as a whole. When we keep the dialogue going about things that matter, we become the agents of change. The Singapore film industry may not be as big or thriving as film industries around the world, but we have the potential to do and be better. That is why, even though I am primarily a screenwriter and secondarily a business owner, the (+65) Film Project, which aims to celebrate, honor, and elevate every aspect of the film industry, is one of the most meaningful and empowering projects I have ever worked on. We want collaboration, cohesiveness, and connectivity to be key aspects of our film industry. Our goal is to turn this combination into a culture that will place the industry on a global standard. Winning prestigious awards is one thing, but contributing significantly to the economy and enhancing Singapore's great reputation is another. We are steadily moving towards making that happen. If you work in the industry, whether you are an expert or a newbie, whether you are a gaffer, colorist, cinematographer, director, screenwriter, Singaporean, or based in Singapore, please reach out and share your thoughts and feelings with me. We welcome all the support you are willing to give, regardless of its size. Every individual and every voice can make a difference. If you are someone who wants to collaborate with the local film industry, we would love to hear from you as well. Be part of this grand journey with us!\n\nWhy Our Poster Was Featured at the Cannes Film Festival Starting a business is a lot like raising a child: it demands patience, perseverance, and the occasional sleepless night. And like all parents, every business owner has two fervent wishes: profit and growth. In the entertainment industry, there’s an added craving for recognition, a magical ingredient that can catapult a venture from obscurity to stardom. For our company, this year brought that coveted recognition, but not without a rollercoaster of effort and emotion. It began with a call from a client. They needed a poster—and not just any poster. “We need it quickly, within two weeks, because we have to enter it with the movie in Cannes.” Cannes? As in the Cannes Film Festival? Two weeks to craft an original poster worthy of one of the most prestigious film festivals in the world? Challenge accepted. The first week was grueling. We submitted concept after concept, only to be met with polite but persistent rejection. “It’s not quite there,” the client would say. The team was getting nervous. Was it us? Were we misunderstanding the client’s vision? Really, what was it? If you’ve followed our journey, you’ll know about our brilliant designer, Fred. Fred was at the helm of this project, navigating through the tempest of feedback. On the seventh day, a breakthrough came in the most unexpected way. One of the film’s producers got involved, and his email contained a crucial clue: his signature showcased posters of his previous films. I noticed this immediately, took a screenshot, and sent it to Fred. He studied those posters like a detective at a crime scene, nodding thoughtfully. Two hours later, I checked in on him. What I saw on his screen made my heart race—we had something. We had something! We sent the revised poster to the client and braced ourselves. At the beginning of this article, I mentioned that owning a company is much like being a parent. Well, In the past we have had equally backbreaking projects – one with Coca-Cola comes to mind. So in many ways, we treat all our projects like they were our babies. To that effect, after submitting this particular Cannes project, it felt like the longest 24-hour wait of our lives. This was day nine. If the feedback was negative, we’d be out of time and out of options. When the reply finally came, we opened the email with bated breath. “This poster by far is the best,” it read. And then, “We also like #2 and #4 and want those for other social media platforms.” We did it. Fred nailed it. The exhilaration was palpable. In the end, our “yes poster” was featured at the Cannes Film Festival. The team was relentless, and it paid off. Getting recognition may be fraught with challenges, but with dedication and a keen eye for detail, you might just find your masterpiece featured on the world’s most prestigious stages. #filmfestival #cannesfilmfestival #filmdistribution #independentfilm #filmindustry #screenin https://lnkd.in/dz8TGiRi\n\nWhy Our Poster Was Featured At The Cannes Film Festival Starting a business is a lot like raising a child: it demands patience, perseverance, and the occasional sleepless night.

FREDA, is the first film of gessica Fabiola Geneus, a masterpiece that gives us a glimpse about the state of things in Haiti, seen through female eyes. The movie released in 2021, won international awards, including FESPACO's 2nd prize the Etalon d'argent de Yennenga. 😍 For any film lovers, particulilarly if you're caribbean, this is a MUST seen from the last 2 years. I am currently in New York, and briefly went to Montreal for a trip - both cities with a dynamic Haitian community (Hi Williamson Dulcé 👋). To my surprise, whenever I talk with haitians about this movie, no one had heard about it. And it was ever worse in NYC. Nevertheless, these are regular viewers of Netflix, Amazon & other streaming platforms. 🤔 This reveals underlying issues that affects the movie industry as a whole. 🔸 The Festival exposure is too small for African & Caribbean movies A movie is required to do a Festival Tour to get recognition & deals. . We know and praise international festivals like Cannes, Sundance, Venice, Berlinale.... But who has ever heard about the FESPACO? 🏆 The largest African film festival in the world is indeed unknown from the mainstream cinema gaze, specially western buyers. The movie made it's world première at Cannes' \"Un certain regard\" 2021 prestigious selection... but that's about it. Therefore, almost nobody would have heard about the movie. 🔸Poor Medias coverage and SEO. When you type on google \"Freda Gessica Geneus interview\" you will find only a few articles by film media like Variety (because they're covering Cannes), a few Haitian media and online videos (check our Cinewax itw on Youtube)... Where are the journalist? 🔸 Only a handful cinema for the film release in 2021-2022 In France the film grossed 66,590$ (Boxoffice Mojo)... Which is less than 10% of the film's budget 😣 Is it a bad movie ? No. It had simply too little coverage into the theaters screens. On average, a movie needs to have 200-400 copies in theaters accross a country to meet profitability. With probably less than 100.000 entries worldwide, how can it be profitable? 🔸 The film budget didn't include marketing Financed by french state support, and international grants - as most of African & caribbean francophone movie productions - the film budget did not include marketing expenses. Therefore, the film success was dependant of the distributor's willingless to invest in marketing... 🎬 At the end of this cycle, streaming platforms surely don't want to invest a dime more! Which is the reason why you won't find the film on Netflix. This fatal loop is the same story for most African movies - exception made for Nigeria & South Africa. We already know that film is a complex business model, that isn't always profitable, but when it comes to African or caribbean movies, it's an financial trap. What do you think ?\n\nA person who shook the entire film industry. Filmmaker Payal Kapadia has slapped the nepotism of the entire Indian cinema in such a way that it has been imprinted forever. Payal Kapadia has become the first director in Indian film history. She won the Golden Eye award for best documentary film at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival for her film \"A Night of Knowing Nothing\" .In 2017, her film Afternoon Clouds was the only Indian film that was selected for the 70th Cannes Film Festival. In 2024, she won the Grand Prix at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival for her film \"All We Imagine as Light\" . If only big actors and film makers were invited to the Cannes Film Awards. They felt very proud. In a way, we have a film industry where instead of giving a chance to a talented film artist or film maker, the children of our family are launched by building their body and teaching them dance. Outsiders are not allowed to enter the industry. They spend Rs 1000 crores and make a film like Adipurush. In the same film industry, Payal Kapadia made a film without any production house, without any big budget, without any big so-called superstar, in which only talented people were cast and tried to show the truth of life with great simplicity. Payal Kapadia's story teaches us that: Talent and Hard Work Matter: Even in a tough industry, real talent and hard work can be recognized. Independent Films Can Succeed: You don't need a big budget to make a great film. Be Authentic: True and simple storytelling connects with people. Challenge the Norms: New and different voices are important for the film industry. International Success is Possible: Indian filmmakers can achieve global recognition. What inspires you to break norms and challenge the status quo in your industry? #PursueYourPassion #OvercomeChallenges #InspireChange #BelieveInYourself #ChaseYourDreams #BreakTheMold #RiseAbove #FuelYourFire #DreamBigAchieveBig"
