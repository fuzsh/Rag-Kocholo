        "text": "Spanish-born filmmaker Isabel Coixet has announced her next project, “Nobody Wants the Night,” for which she plans an early 2014 shoot in Norway. Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe and Rinko Kikuchi are set to star.\n\nHere’s the official synopsis:\n\nThe film is the story of two women, from two different\n\nworlds, and their struggle to survive in one of the most inhospitable places on\n\nEarth. Josephine (to be played by Binoche) is a proud yet naive woman in love\n\nwith a man who prefers glory and ice to the comforts of an upper-class home.\n\nAllaka (to be played by Kikuchi), a young but wise Inuit woman, is in love with\n\nthe same man with whom she’s expecting a child. Set against the backdrop of a\n\nrelentless icy landscape, the film chronicles their long, tense wait for the\n\nsame man they love in such distinct ways.\n\nThis new title’s not to be confused with Coixet’s psychological thriller “Another Me,” which will screen in competition at the Rome Film Festival in November and stars Sophie Turner and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, or “Learning to Drive,” which just wrapped filming and heads into post-production soon, starring Ben Kingsley and Patricia Clarkson. It’s been a busy year for Coixet, who often also acts as the camera operator on her films.\n\nCoixet’s estimable filmography includes “My Life Without Me,” “The Secret Life of Words,” both starring actress-director Sarah Polley, “Elegy,” starring Ben Kingsley and Penelope Cruz, and “Yesterday Never Ends,” her most recent release."
