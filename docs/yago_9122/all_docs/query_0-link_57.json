The film opens in cinemas on the 27th of June and stars the young British actress Sophie Turner, known above all for her role as Sansa Stark in the TV series Game of Thrones.\n\nIn the film, Turner plays the part of Fay, an adolescent leading a seemingly idyllic existence. Everything changes, however, we she begins to have a strange feeling that someone is following her. This someone is her double, a being exactly the same as her who stalks her not only to steal her identity, but to take her life.\n\nSecondary roles are played by actors and actresses the likes of Claire Forlani, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Rhys Ifans, Ivana Baquero (the protagonist of The Labyrinth of the Faun), Geraldine Chaplin and Leonor Watling."
