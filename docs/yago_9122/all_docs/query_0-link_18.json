        "text": "A dramatic thriller that centers on a fish-market employee (Rinko Kikuchi) who doubles as a contract killer . She is a tough murderer who's hired by a powerful businessman as an assassin to kill a Spaniard (Sergi Lopez) owner of a winery in Tokyo whom he blames for the suicide of his daughter. Concerning the problematic existences of two particular roles played by Rinko Kikuchi and Sergi López , as their lives are intersected and both of them will change in unexpected consequences and unpredictable ways.\n\nIsabel Coixet is in love with contemporary Japanese culture as evidenced by this outlandish film in which she reflects a lot on Japanese customs. The film gives a wide vision of today's Tokyo, the bustling streets, the peculiar hotels , the noisy markets , the popular karaokes and at the same time reflecting the solitude of the big metropolis. Isabel Coixet's infatuation with Japanese culture is well attested to the fact that she called her film production ¨Miss Wasabi Films¨. On a visit to a fish market while promoting \"The Secret Life of Words\" in the Land of the Rising Sun, the Barcelona filmmaker was inspired and decided to pay off her outstanding debt to Japan by shooting this sui generis film , which, although it is shot in Tokyo, maintains her intimate and special trademarks . In addition , she had two great actors : Rinko Kikuchi (nominated an Academy Award for Babel) as an assassin who's is hired by an avenger old man to kill and Sergi López as an unfortunate entrepreneur in Tokyo , both of whom monopolize practically all the footage of the film. As the picture relies heavily on the outlandish relationship between the two awesome protagonists : Rinko Kikuchi and Sergi López giving nice acting , including some strong erotic scenes among them . Despite being nominated for the Goya for best sound and Golden Palm at Cannes , and taking the technical prize in this Festival , the film failed at the box offic . The artistic and technician section were the facets praised by critics , who almost unanimously described it as cold and full of the usual cliches of Coixet's cinema.\n\nThe motion picture was leisurely , slowly directed by the Spanish Isabel Coixet , shooting in his ordinary feeling style , such as : A los que aman , Another me, The secret life of words, Things I never told you, Elisa and Mariela, Endless night, The bookshop, his biggest hits were Another me and Elegy with Ben Kingsley. . She is a good professional, a fine craftsman who has directed enjoyable and thoughful films . She often is the camera operator of her movies and founded her own production company, Miss Wasabi Films, in 2000 and was member of the 'Official Competition' jury at the 59th Berlin International Film Festival in 2009 . Her interesting filmography includes other feature films , such as : 'Cosas que nunca te dije' (Things I Never Told You) (1995), Elegy (2008), 'Mapa de los sonidos de Tokio' (Map of the Sounds of Tokyo) (2009), and the latest 'Ayer no termina nunca' (Yesterday Never Ends) (2013) besides documentary films, shorts and commercials , such as Proyecto tiempo, El espiritu de la pintura, Sea Aral, Marlango, Marea blanca, Spain in a day and a segment of Paris Je taime , among others. Map of the sounds of Tokyo rating 6/10. Well worth seeing , but only for Isabel Coixet followers .\n\nHaving enjoyed greatly many of Isabel Coixet's movies (notably \"Things I never told you\" and \"The secret life of words\") I must say I was quite disappointed by this last movie.\n\nIt is difficult to point out what fails in this movie, but I certainly did not connect at all with its characters and situations. The movie is set in Tokyo, but contrary to \"Lost in translation\" here the movie tries to build half on Japanese characters and half on western ones, which really demands a deeper knowledge about japan. It is difficult for me to believe the Japanese part of the movie, first of all they all seem to speak very good English, which is, at least, difficult to believe, e.g. why would the Japanese girl, played by Kinko Rikuchi, speak good English at all?, why is the other guy working with the Spanish seller almost American? Must say maybe I am biased by my own experience with the Japanese people I met in japan, but certainly communication is in general much tougher than what Isabel portraits here.\n\nOf course all the visual and sound stuff is really good, beautiful takes, nice sounds etc, but the story really does not make any sense to me from the beginning to the end. As the movie develops I got mostly bored, the sex scenes seem empty, repetitive and with no special purpose.\n\nWe do not get enough info to actually feel anything for any character, starting from the friendship between the guy recording sounds and the girl and ending by the business-man and his daughter. Everything seems fake to some extend and the whole story really appears to be built to serve as an excuse to go to Tokyo and enjoy the visual landscapes of the city (maybe just a documentary about the fish market would suffice).\n\nSadly, I must say I got nothing of what I was expecting: neither a nice insight into Japan, nor a situation I could connect with. I certainly would prefer to watch \"Lost in Translation\", read Amelie Nothomb or watch a good documentary about japan to see beautiful takes of the country, instead of spending two precious hours at the cinema.\n\nIn any case, I hope I ll enjoy better the next one from Coixet! (and I ll certainly keep enjoying Japanese food meanwhile)\n\nOne of less warmly received movies at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival seems to have gotten into competition more on the basis of the director Isabel Coixet's credentials, than actual quality. More or less openly inspired by \"Lost in Translation\" this Spanish production garnishes a more ambitious route suggesting inner knowledge on Tokio reality, not using it as a symbolic vessel of detachment, but as a well-treaded path following a recognisable motif of a would-be assassin, who falls in love with her prey.\n\nBy day a physical labourer on the fish market, by night a contract-killer Ryu (Rinko Kikuchi) is hired out by Japanese CEO Nagara (Takeo Nakahara) to avenge the suicide of his daughter, driven apparently to the brink by a failed love affair (the specific nature of this fall-out is never revealed). The target is Spanish wine-seller David (Sergi López), a slightly overweight love-machine with animal magnetism distraught by the suicide and contemplating the same fate. During research Ryu compulsively happens to chance a short affair with the hapless foreigner, a serious breach of contract...\n\nTold with fluid imagery filled less with noise of Tokio, but more of Japanese renditions of Eastern hits, including a pretty awful karaoke attempt at Depeche Mode by the uninspirational Sergi Lopez. At times sensual Coixet entices with nicely shot frames and lingering emotions, but the unfortunate reality is that the fleeting story of \"Map of the Sounds of Tokyo\" is a muddled collage of beautiful visuals, which make nice eye candy, but a forgettable movie. Nonetheless the invitation to entertain in the less frequented areas of Japanese movies, like the fish market or the automated hotels, does offer gratification, albeit scarcely sufficient to supplement the plot.\n\nThe slowly drifting story also falls into the pitfall of English language usage, as both Kikuchi and Lopez struggle to sell the part, when forced into unfamiliar language territory, given an off-key performance, which creates an awkward distance and ambivalence to the characters as well as dissolves the mood and focus set out by the carefully constructed layers of imagery focusing the mood.\n\nPerformance-wise the strongest input is guaranteed by older-timer Nakahara, who given the limited screen-time inputs an unwavering presence, while the opening scene at a sushi restaurant is one of the sole reasons why the picture is actually worth a watch. It essentially also lays out the underlying premise - people come to Japan to input their projections of how the country looks, while Japanese in an attempt to be good hosts adhere to their expectations. Unfortunately Coixet fails to listen to her own advice."
