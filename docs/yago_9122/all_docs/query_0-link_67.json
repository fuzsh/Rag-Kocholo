        "text": "Isabel Coixet was born in Barcelona.\n\nSince her debut feature, Too Old\n\nto Die Young (1989), she has directed\n\nThings I Never Told You (1996), My Life\n\nWithout Me (2003), The Secret Life of Words (2005),\n\nElegy (2008), Map of the Sounds of\n\nTokyo (2009), Another Me (2013), and a segment\n\nof Paris, Je T’aime (2006).\n\nIn her latest film, Learning to Drive, a Manhattan writer (Patricia Clarkson) finds solace in her biweekly lessons with a Sikh driving instructor (Ben Kingsley) after her husband leaves her. The film is adapted from Katha Pollitt’s 2002 essay for The New Yorker. (TIFF official site)\n\nLearning to Drive will play at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 10, and 12.\n\nWaH: Please give us your description of the film playing.\n\nIC: Learning\n\nto Drive is a sweet and sour comedy about the unlikely friendship\n\nbetween a woman (a writer played by Patricia Clarkson) and a man (a\n\nSikh taxi driver played by Ben Kingsley) coming from two different\n\nuniverses.\n\nWaH: What drew you to this script?\n\nIC: It was the possibility to explore the world of the friendship between these two completely opposite characters, and also the Sikh community in NYC, which I had never seen before on the screen.\n\nWaH: What was the biggest challenge in making the film?\n\nIC: The\n\nfact that almost half of the film happens inside a car was not an easy\n\ntask. We also shot in August in NYC. Really, really, REALLY hot!\n\nWaH: What do you want people to think about when they are leaving the theatre?\n\nIC: I want the audience to feel that they share the intimacy of these characters and that they’ll know a little more about human nature.\n\nWaH: What advice do you have for other female directors?\n\nIC: Stubbornness.\n\nAnd don’t listen to what other people (especially male directors or male\n\nproducers) say about your work. Nobody knows what’s your point of\n\nview better than yourself.\n\nWaH: What’s the biggest misconception about you and your work?\n\nIC: I guess the biggest misconception is I’m a drama queen! I have a great sense of humor, I swear. But okay, yes: I’m a drama queen.\n\nWaH: How did you get your film funded?\n\nIC: The Hammond brothers, two independent producers, financed the film entirely.\n\nWaH: Name your favorite women directed film and why."
