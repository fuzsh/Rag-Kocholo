Other notable shorts by the Zellners -- all of which have played at Sundance -- include the acclaimed Aftermath on Meadowlark Lane and Sasquatch Birth Journal 2.\n\nGoliath, their first feature film, premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and was distributed theatrically by IFC Films, followed by KID-THING, a fable-like drama starring Sydney Aguirre and Susan Tyrell, which premiered at Sundance in 2012 and internationally at the 62nd Berlinale. KID-THING received a 2012 Gotham Award nomination and was distributed theatrically around the world and domestically in the US by Factory 25.\n\nThe Zellners' latest film Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter starring Rinko Kikuchi premiered in the U.S. Dramatic Competition at Sundance 2014 and internationally at the 64th Berlinale. It was nominated for two Independent Spirit Awards (Best Actress and Best Director) and will be distributed by Amplify Releasing in 2015."
