        "text": "Elegy Directed by Isabel Coixet\n\n'Elegy\" is such a serious, oftentimes grave exploration of desire and the ways of aging and desperate flesh that it's a miracle the two central characters - a literary star named David Kepesh and his much younger lover, Consuela - have as much sex as they do.\n\nDespite some low-key lovemaking and the considerably more overwrought talk, there's very little pleasure to be found amid this film's penumbral lighting, careful compositions and muffled, muffling good taste. There isn't much juice here either, though the film is based on \"The Dying Animal,\" a brutal, short novel by Philip Roth that oozes like a wound.\n\nThe book is fascinating and repellent, more admirable than likable, a fusion of early Roth (sex) and late Roth (death). It's narrated by Kepesh (Ben Kingsley in the film), who in 1972 metamorphosed into the title character of \"The Breast\" and five years later became Roth's eponymous \"Professor of Desire.\" The Kepesh in \"The Dying Animal\" is 70 and engorged with rage. His fury and vigorous language belie the aging flesh he bitterly complains about as he recalls his obsessive affair with Consuela (Pen√©lope Cruz) eight years earlier. She was his student and ripe for the plucking, especially in the film, where she enters clutching \"The Pleasure of the Text,\" by Roland Barthes, to her lush bosom.\n\nIn the novel Kepesh is pathetic and self-loathing, but perversely enthralling because Roth's prose is. Kepesh detests his decaying (dying) body and worships Consuela's ripe (blooming) one. In the film, (being released worldwide through December) directed by Isabel Coixet and written by Nicholas Meyer, Kepesh is cool and watchful and Kingsley plays him without a trace of plausible weakness. With his flat stomach and beaky profile, Kingsley looks too proud to indulge in the humiliating revelations that, in the novel, Kepesh ritualistically bathes in. The actor and the filmmakers have made the character their own, but their portrait of a lonely man incapable of surrendering to love is familiar and banal."
