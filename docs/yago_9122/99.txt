A few of you out there may be familiar with Spanish auteur Isabel Coixet, but for those of you who aren't, she most recently directed the Ben Kingsley film Elegy last year as well as a few other great dramas. Coixet is returning to Cannes this year to premiere Map of the Sounds of Tokyo, a hitman drama starring Rinko Kikuchi (Babel, Brothers Bloom) and Sergi LÃ³pez (Pan's Labyrinth). We recently ran across the first bare-all promo trailer (this is not safe for work) and thought it was worth sharing today. I was planning on catching this at Cannes already, but now I'm very excited to see it, as it looks like it might be fantastic.

Map of the Sounds of Tokyo premieres at Cannes on May 23rd, so look for the first reactions then.

Watch the promo trailer for Map of the Sounds of Tokyo:

Ryu is a solitary girl whose fragile appearance is in stark contrast with the double life she leads, working nights at a Tokyo fishmarket and taking on jobs as a hit-woman. Mr. Nagara is a powerful impresario mourning the loss of his daughter Midori. He blames David, a Spaniard who runs a wine business in Tokyo. Mr. Nagara's employee, Ishida, was silently in love with Midori and hired Ryu to murder David.

Map of the Sounds of Tokyo is both written and directed by Spanish director Isabel Coixet, of Things I Never Told You, Those Who Love, My Life Without Me, The Secret Life of Words, and Elegy most recently. The film was shot primarily in Tokyo, Japan. It is premiering at the Cannes Film Festival this month, where it will be looking for a distributor. Expect to hear more about Map of the Sounds of Tokyo very soon!
