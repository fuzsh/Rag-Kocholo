        "text": "Gottmik, born Kade Gottlieb, is more than just a name in the world of drag—Gottmik is a movement, a symbol of revolution, and a beacon of self-expression. The first trans man to ever compete on RuPaul’s Drag Race, Gottmik shattered ceilings and carved out a new space for trans visibility in the mainstream drag scene. But to truly understand the force that is Gottmik, we must delve deeper into their life, their artistry, and the undeniable impact they’ve had on pop culture.\n\nFrom Scottsdale to Stardom: The Making of Gottmik\n\nBorn on August 19, 1996, in the heart of Scottsdale, Arizona, Gottmik entered the world as Mikayla Gottlieb. Raised in a conservative family, their journey to self-discovery was not without its challenges. High school at Notre Dame Preparatory provided a conventional backdrop for a young person who felt anything but conventional.\n\nAt the tender age of 18, Gottmik began to explore drag, a bold and defiant act of self-creation. It was more than just playing with makeup or slipping into a gown—drag was a form of liberation. This newfound passion propelled them to Los Angeles, where they not only immersed themselves in the vibrant fashion scene but also began the process of gender transition, evolving into the person they were always meant to be.\n\nA Makeup Maestro with a Drag Alter Ego\n\nWhile many know Gottmik for their fierce drag persona, what truly sets them apart is their unparalleled skill in makeup artistry. The face that transforms into Gottmik is the canvas of a true artist. This expertise has attracted the attention of some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry. From Cindy Crawford’s timeless elegance to Lil Nas X’s boundary-pushing looks, Gottmik has crafted the faces of icons.\n\nTheir work has graced the pages of Flaunt, Nylon, and Paper, and perhaps most famously, Gottmik’s artistry was featured in Taylor Swift’s star-studded “You Need to Calm Down” music video. It’s a career that many makeup artists can only dream of, but for Gottmik, it was just the beginning.\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race: A New Era Begins\n\nGottmik’s journey took a pivotal turn when they joined the cast of RuPaul’s Drag Race season 13 in 2021. The drag world had never seen anything quite like this before—a trans man stepping onto one of the most visible stages in the LGBTQ+ community. But Gottmik wasn’t just there to make history; they were there to win.\n\nThroughout the season, Gottmik delivered show-stopping performances, cementing their status as a powerhouse in the drag community. Their Snatch Game portrayal of Paris Hilton was pitch-perfect, and their ball challenge win demonstrated a flair for high fashion that was nothing short of spectacular. Gottmik didn’t just compete; they dominated, making it to the top four alongside Symone, Kandy Muse, and Rosé.\n\nAlthough Gottmik didn’t snatch the crown, their impact on the show was seismic. Their elimination in the finale lip sync against Symone felt less like a defeat and more like a passing of the torch. Gottmik had set a new standard—one that celebrated authenticity, bravery, and unapologetic self-expression.\n\nA Legendary Return: All Stars and the Iconic Runway Moment\n\nFans were thrilled when Gottmik returned for RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars season 9. This time, they had a statement to make, and they did so in an unforgettable fashion. Their \"A Tail and Two Titties\" runway look, which boldly showcased their top surgery scars, was not just a drag moment—it was a cultural statement. It was a celebration of trans bodies, a middle finger to societal norms, and a declaration that beauty comes in many forms.\n\nThe look was widely praised and is now considered one of the most iconic moments in Drag Race history. Gottmik didn’t just walk the runway; they redefined it.\n\nBeyond Drag: The Multi-Faceted Star\n\nGottmik’s influence extends far beyond the confines of the drag world. In 2021, they launched their own YouTube channel, giving fans a closer look at the person behind the persona. Collaborations with fellow influencers like Gigi Gorgeous and James Charles have further expanded their reach, while appearances on platforms like World of Wonder have solidified their status as a media force.\n\nIn addition to this, Gottmik graced the cover of Attitude magazine, becoming a queer icon for the new generation. Their message is clear: be yourself, unapologetically. In a world that often tries to put people into boxes, Gottmik is smashing them with a sledgehammer.\n\nThe Legacy of Gottmik: A Revolution in Heels\n\nGottmik isn’t just a drag artist; they are a revolution in heels. Their journey from Scottsdale to the global stage is a testament to the power of authenticity. They’ve turned makeup into an art form, drag into a platform for change, and their story into an inspiration for countless others.\n\nAs the drag world continues to evolve, one thing is certain: Gottmik will always be remembered as the trailblazer who redefined what it means to be a drag artist. They are a living, breathing work of art—an icon who shows us all that there’s power in being yourself, no matter what the world might say."
