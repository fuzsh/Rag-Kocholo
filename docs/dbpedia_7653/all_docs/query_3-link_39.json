        "text": "Doc, feeling his burden being lifted, decided that it was time to attempt to travel back to the future.\n\nOn June 12, 1893, the Brown family attempted to travel in the Jules Verne train to 1985. Doc calculated that 50 yards would be enough to reach 88 m.p.h, since he had improved the performance of the presto logs used to heat the boiler of the steam engine.\n\nThe trip failed however, as the train didn't achieve temporal displacement, and crashed.\n\nDoc had intended to give up his quest for time travel at that point, as he was happy in the 19th century, and didn't want to put his family in unnecessary risk.\n\nHowever, Clara finally told him that she had wanted to travel to the future ever since she found out about the DeLorean time machine.\n\nTime travel wasn't just his dream, it was hers too. Jules and Verne also told him that they wanted to go as well. Since his family wanted to travel through time so badly, Doc decided to try another approach towards accomplishing time travel.\n\nThe steam time car\n\nAfter seeing a steam tricycle driver driving a Serpollet steam tricycle, Doc decided to use one as a time machine.\n\nHe used the flux capacitor, the frictionless dynamo, and the time circuits from the prototype Jules Verne Train in his steam time car. He had intended to travel to 2015 to pick up everything he needed to finish the Jules Verne train.\n\nHowever, the stresses of space-time and the temperature variation would wreak havoc on the cast-iron frame of the steam time car.\n\nIn addition, the car provided no protection for the driver, so Doc had to wear a diving suit when he traveled through time in the time car in order to survive.\n\nHe left his family for the future in the steam time car on August 13, 1893, and had intended to arrive back seconds after he left. The time travel was a success, however due to the 19th century parts he had to use, there was a fluctuation in the space-time continuum.\n\nDoc ended up in 2035 instead of 2015, and didn't return home for days.\n\nDoc's wife Clara then wrote Marty a letter letting him know that Doc was missing, and left it with the Western Union office with instructions to be delivered to Hill Valley High School in 1986.\n\nMarty McFly got the letter, and looked for Doc in a secret lab that he was able to find, with the help of his girlfriend Jennifer.\n\nMarty and Jennifer had no idea when and where Doc had gone, so Marty wrote Doc a letter and left it in the secret lab. Doc found it in 2035, while going back to the lab to pick up the clothes he wore in 2015\n\nHowever, Doc soon found himself pursued by officer Griff Tannen, after he tried to retrieve his safety deposit box from the bank.\n\nTannen had been given a sage implant and a level one personality rewiring after he was released from prison.\n\nAs he was deemed rehabilitated, he became an officer of the Hill Valley Police Department. However, the new personality implant didn't work, and Griff retained his violent tendencies. He was known to disobey orders, to use excessive force, and to use equipment that he was not authorized to use, such as a flame thrower.\n\nHe was also reprimanded in the past for taking bribes\n\nThe police were after Doc as the biological scan of Doc's age did not match that of the false identity he set up in 2015. Doc had intended to travel back to 2015, to pick up the parts he needed, at a time that his false identity would still be valid.\n\nHowever, Griff shot an electrical surge at Doc as he was about to head back in the steam time car.\n\nThis surge was meant to disable his bionic implants, but since Doc didn't have any, he suffered amnesia due to the jolt.\n\nHe saw Marty's letter in his pocket, and headed to the time and place that was written there, since that was his only clue as to what was happening. Doc arrived at the date on the letter, March 3, 1986, in his secret lab.\n\nHowever, upon arriving there, he had no memory of who he was, and he was confused about the date and the location of which he had arrived.\n\nHe also did not recognize Marty and Jennifer. Marty and Jennifer decided to help the amnesiac Doc find the vehicle that had transported him there, not knowing which time machine he had used.\n\nThey went to the spot where Doc had crashed into a STOP sign, but the steam time car was gone. They discovered that the towing service, Lee Bros. Towing & Repair, had left a flyer with their company name, as they had wanted the owner of the car to know where it was towed.\n\nThey then traveled to the towing service, and discovered that a man who worked for the company, Jack, already had a buyer for the car. He stated that he would sell it to them instead for $300.\n\nSince they didn't have the money, they sneaked into the lot, and found the car still hooked up to the tow truck. Knowing that they didn't have any way to get the money, Marty decided to steal the car, tow truck and all.\n\nDouglas J. Needles arrived and threatened to smash the car, so Marty started the tow truck and sped away from Needles, who pursued him in his Ford F-150.\n\nMarty managed to outrun Needles, who crashed into a delivery truck loaded with eggs. Jennifer and Doc, who had split up from Marty once Needles arrived, joined back up with Marty, and they headed to the Lone Pine Mall to inspect the steam time car. They discovered that Doc had arrived in 1986 from 2035.\n\nThe time parachute\n\nSince the steam time car would be battered by the rigors of space-time, Doc surmised that it would not survive a return trip.\n\nThus, he had come up with a plan to travel without a time machine. He devised an idea for a time parachute, in which a person would ascend in a balloon to a distance of half a mile, and then would be released from the balloon.\n\nThe person would fall at a rate of 35 feet per second per second, and would reach 88 m.p.h. between four and five seconds. Since the time circuits, frictionless dynamo, and flux capacitor are connected to the parachute, the person, who would be protected from the rigors of space-time and the temperature variation by wearing a protective suit, would travel through time.\n\nThe time traveler would then pull the ripcord of the parachute once they traveled through time, and arrive safely on the ground in that time period.\n\nSince the steam time car had surprisingly survived two trips, Doc and Marty knew it wouldn't survive another trip through time. Marty grabbed a radiation suit and traveled via the time parachute with Doc to September 16, 2035. There Marty hoped that they would discover what had happened to Doc, and why he lost his memory.\n\nThe time parachute was a success, and they crashed into the glass roof of the Lone Pine Fli-Drome once they arrived in 2035. They arrived in the middle of a fliderb, a hoverboard roller derby.\n\nAs they arrived in a radiation suit and a diving suit, and had crashed through the roof, the fliderb players thought they were terrorists, and called the police.\n\nWhile on the run, Doc and Marty ran into officer Griff Tannen, who caught them in Bistro Twenty/15. This restaurant was themed on life in 2015, as Cafe 80's was modeled after the 1980s in 2015.\n\nOfficer Tannen recognized Doc as the person who supposedly stole the identity of Leroy Brown. Once he saw the diving suit, he realized that Doc and Marty were the two people who were the cause of the disturbance at the Fliderb.\n\nTannen chased them in his police vehicle while they fled on hoverboards. While they were being chased, Doc fell backwards on his board and hit his head. This shock caused him to remember everything, and he told Marty all about how he had found himself in that situation once they reached Doc's secret lab.\n\nIt seemed like the two were cornered, however Marty discovered that the machine that he had turned on out of curiosity in 1986 was actually the temporal field generator Mk II.\n\nAlthough the device could only transport objects through time during the time in which the machine had been turned on, since it was turned on nearly fifty years prior, time would not be a factor. Doc donned the diving suit and went back to 2015.\n\nThe second DeLorean time machine\n\nMarty and Jennifer found another DeLorean DMC-12 in Doc's secret lab in 1986. Although it wasn't adapted for time travel, Marty and Jennifer took it to escape the police, who had been alerted when the alarm was tripped in the secret lab.\n\nDoc picked up Einstein, and they both traveled from 1986 to August 14, 1893, hours after Clara dropped off the note addressed to Marty at the Western Union office.\n\nLater in the 1890s, Doc was able to successfully complete the Jules Verne train, using the technology he brought back from 2015. He then traveled to October 27, 1985.\n\nThere, the Brown family met up with Marty McFly and Jennifer Parker in the most likely place that they might be at that given time, the site of the DeLorean's destruction.\n\nHe introduced his family, and explained to Jennifer how the fax that showed that Marty had been fired in 2015 disappeared after Marty chose not to drag race Douglas J. Needles in 1985.\n\nThe future hadn't been written yet, so he told Jennifer and Marty to make it a good one. He also gave Marty the picture that was taken in 1885 of Marty and Doc in front of the clock that had yet to be installed in the Hill Valley Courthouse.\n\nMarcus Irving's time machine\n\nIn January 1986, the United States government terminated the funding of Marcus Irving's time travel research, as his time machine wasn't complete since the final step had eluded him for the past 24 years.\n\nWhen trying to learn more about the government's research into time travel, Irving discovered that he had not been their first choice for building a time machine. Irving became jealous of Doc Brown being their first choice, and also angry at Brown for denying the offer and causing him to waste 24 years of his life.\n\nThus, Irving set out to gather information on Brown. Upon reaching Doc Brown's lab at 1646 John F. Kennedy Drive, he discovered it to be deserted. He conducted more research and learned of a close friend and assistant of Brown's, Marty McFly.\n\nHoping to find out just how much success Brown had had with time travel, Irving went to Marty's house, only to see Emmett Brown in the DeLorean time machine reach temporal displacement, at the moment Doc left the canisters with Marty and Jennifer.\n\nAt this point, Irving decided to try and contact Brown, leaving a message in Brown's second laboratory. On April 14, 1986, he came face-to-face with Marty McFly, who was also looking for Doc in an attempt to find out why his memories did not reflect the current timeline. He informed Marty that he had built a partially working time machine using a Yugo, and warned him that his conflicting memories could mean he could be erased once the current timeline caught up with itself.\n\nMarty sent a message to Doc, who arrived shortly afterward. While Doc and Marty were talking, Marcus secretly removed the tires from the DeLorean, and used Doc's flux capacitor to solve his problem with flux energy, which was the final step needed for time travel.\n\nHe was afraid of altering time too much, so he had spent years driving around with the flux capacitor in his trunk, worrying that someone might steal it from him.\n\nEventually, he decided to travel into the future to make himself rich. Since he was afraid of altering time too much, he decided to only time travel in \"baby steps\", so he could better prevent any major changes to the timeline. He decided to take 2008 technology back to 1997 in order to make himself rich.\n\nBy this point, he had upgraded his Yugo with steel panels to help with the dispersal of flux energy. He also upgraded the tires, as the polymers used in 1980s rubber tires aren't suited for the rigors of the space-time continuum.\n\nOnce he began his plan, he realized that he could be confronted by Marty and Doc at any time, as unlike himself, they were time cowboys who weren't afraid to travel many years into the past and future, making large changes to the time stream.\n\nIrving searched the internet for pictures of Marty and Doc from the 1980s. He then used those pictures to build several doppelgangers using futuristic parts and sent them back to 1986.\n\nSeveral of the Marty doppelgangers appeared soon after Irving had stolen the flux capacitor and kidnapped Marty. They tried to kidnap Doc as well, but he escaped in the DeLorean.\n\nIt was still able to fly despite lacking tires, since the hover technology in the rims were untouched. One of Marty's doppelgangers held onto the DeLorean while it was in the air. This surprised Doc, as he thought that it would be very unlikely that Marty could have survived such a trip.\n\nDoc explains that they can't just go back and stop Marcus from taking the flux capacitor, since the effects on a time traveler aren't instant, pointing out that it took a week for Marty to begin to fade from existence in 1955. Marcus and Doc could get in a reverse time race, with each vehicle going further back in time to try to prevent the other from making changes.\n\nMarty realizes that his fear of being all alone is what drove him to find Marty in the first place. They decide to take Marcus to his younger self, traveling in the DeLorean back to 1986.\n\nIn 1986, Marcus Irving is traveling in his Yugo GX, happy that he has taken the flux capacitor. Marty and Doc arrive from 1997 in the DeLorean, followed by the older Marcus in the Yugo.\n\nThe temporal duplicate DeLorean\n\nOn May 14, 1986, a DeLorean time machine arrived at Doc's garage, six months after Doc's original DeLorean was destroyed.\n\nThis DeLorean was a temporal duplicate, which had been created when the original DeLorean was hit by lightning in 1955. While the original DeLorean was sent seventy years in the past, the temporal duplicate DeLorean was sent seventy years into the future.\n\nDoc traveled to the future and discovered that DeLorean. He was able to get it back from Griff Tannen before he caused damage to the time stream\n\nAs it was an exact duplicate of the original DeLorean, it had all the additions that the original DeLorean had when it was hit by lightning in 1955.\n\nIt also had some additions that Doc had made since then, including an automatic retrieval system which would send the DeLorean to the future to retrieve Marty in the event that Doc didn't use the DeLorean for an extended period of time.\n\nMarty played a tape of Doc explaining this feature, and realized that Doc was in trouble. He traveled to June 13, 1931 to rescue Doc. Things didn't go as planned, and Doc was erased from time due to Marty accidentally causing a young Emmett to fall in love with and marry Edna Strickland. Doc never created the time machine, so he wasn't able to get the rejuvenation treatments that extended his life\n\nMarty was able to convince the alternate Doc from this timeline to repair the time machine. This Doc, who went by the name Citizen Brown, traveled back to 1931 with Marty to try to fix the timeline.\n\nAs they arrived at a later date then they had intended, Citizen Brown repaired the time circuits of this DeLorean, which were unstable. He used flux emitters to calibrate the time circuits to ensure that the DeLorean arrived at the right time\n\nWhen Marty proved that Edna was the arsonist who burned down the Hill Valley speakeasy, the timeline was repaired. Young Emmett never married Edna, so Citizen Brown faded from existence.\n\nEdna Strickland stole the DeLorean and accidentally headed into the past, while trying to avoid Officer Danny Parker. Marty gave young Emmett a newspaper clipping from 1986 and told him not to look at it until he was awarded the key to the city.\n\nAt that point, Doc arrived in 1931, as he had received the key and then understood who had given him the newspaper clipping. This Doc had arrived in a different DeLorean, which was from the new timeline, so it didn't contain the modifications that Citizen Brown had made.\n\nOnce Hill Valley faded from existence, they realized that Edna Strickland had seriously damaged the time stream at some time in the past. Marty's great grandfather William McFly, told them about an old woman named Mary Pickford, who he thought would know about the town that used to be there.\n\nIt turns out that Mary Pickford was actually Edna Strickland, who had traveled back to 1876 and accidentally burned down the town when she tried to set fire to the Palace Saloon. After she gave them the date of the arson, Marty and Doc traveled to July 17, 1876 to stop her.\n\nDoc used flux overrides to control the flux emitters on Edna's DeLorean. They were able to remotely control her DeLorean, accelerating to 88 mph before that DeLorean faded from existence once the time bubble protecting it popped and time caught up with itself.\n\nWhen Marty and Doc returned to 1986, Doc revealed that, unlike the original timeline where the bank was foreclosing his lab due to his absence, he and Clara live part time in 1986. He also explained that he went to 1931 to investigate Marty's family lineage so that he could give Marty a book on his ancestry.\n\nThe new DeLorean\n\nAlso in 1991, Doc Brown built a new DeLorean. This DeLorean had many improvements, including audio activation of the time circuits, and spatial displacement. This feature, which Doc also installed into the Jules Verne train, allowed it to travel to any place on Earth at any time period.\n\nThis DeLorean also had the ability to transform into a suitcase, which prevented it from being stolen and allowed it to hidden more easily. (As seen in the Film Ready Player One)\n\nBy 1991, Doc improved upon his temporal field experiments with the remote control mail delivery time machine, which could send objects through time, beyond the lifespan of the device.\n\nWhen the Brown family were visiting the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt in 1000 BCE, a spear damaged the flux capacitor of the Jules Verne train.\n\nThe time train was sent to 1692 in Salem, Massachusetts. Doc used the remote control mail delivery time machine to send a scratch and listen postcard to 1991 to let Marty know the situation.\n\nMarty used the new DeLorean to travel back to September 23, 1692 with a spare flux capacitor. He crashed in a lake, and another addition that Doc made to the new DeLorean was revealed when an inflatable device was automatically triggered, bringing the DeLorean back to the surface. After several days, Doc was able to repair the train, and they were able to take both the Jules Verne train and the new DeLorean time machine back to 1991.\n\nIn 1992, Doc Brown's old college roommate, Walter Wisdom, hosted a children's television show about science. Doc's son Verne was a fan of the show, and tried to talk to Walter Wisdom backstage.\n\nOnce Wisdom found out that Verne was Emmett's son, he sought to find out if he had made any more inventions that he could steal.\n\nHe found out that Doc had realized his vision for time travel, and stole the new DeLorean. He tried to pass it off as his own design and reveal its existence on live television, but Doc was able to reveal that he was a charlatan and thief by proving that he knew everything about the inventions that Walter Wisdom stole, while Wisdom himself knew very little.\n\nAdditional time travel without a machine\n\nLike Doc's time parachute, his son Jules devised a similar plan. After traveling from 1991 to August 5, 1926, Jules discovered his father, who was a child at the time, was going to be in a barrel going over the Upper Yosemite Falls while movie producer D.W. Tannen filmed it.\n\nTo keep his father safe, Verne Brown took his place in the barrel, and Jules put a spare flux capacitor inside. As Doc had improved time travel at that point to allow for travel through both space and time, once the barrel reached 88 m.p.h., it was sent safely towards land.\n\nUnspecified DeLorean time machines\n\nDoc used a DeLorean time machine several times after he returned from 1885. It's unknown which time machine was used in these instances, but since they appeared similar to the original DeLorean, they were likely either the second DeLorean, the temporal duplicate DeLorean, or a new time machine.\n\nOn May 15th, 1986, a future version of Marty arrived outside Doc's garage in a DeLorean time machine.\n\nIn 1988, Doc traveled to Orlando, Florida on May 1, 1990 to visit Universal Studios Florida. He was able to have an experience beyond that of usual theme park visitors, as he was able to actively participate in the rides\n\nIn 1989, in Hill Valley, California, two young men discovered and stole a DeLorean time machine and used it to travel to 2015. They asked a police officer where they could find pizza, and she pointed them to a Pizza Hut restaurant.\n\nIn 1991, Biff stowed away in a DeLorean time machine when the scientists from the Institute of Technology traveled to 1955. Biff stole this time machine and traveled to the future and the past, while being pursued by time travel volunteers in an 8-passenger DeLorean remotely piloted by Doc Brown.\n\nNon-canon or disputable information ends here.\n\nDoc traveled to 2045 or beyond, where he witnessed the devastation caused by a nuclear holocaust which was accidentally triggered by an overload of the Mr. Fusion network by a signal sent out by Griff Tannen's ThingMeme social media application.\n\nDoc successfully traveled from 2015 to an unknown point the past to prevent the the Mr. Fusion, hover conversion, food hydrator and self-tying shoes from being available by 2015.\n\nChanging the future\n\nDoc warns Marty about Griff Tannen.\n\nWhen the elderly Biff Tannen brought the sports almanac from 2015 back to 1955, he had quickly managed to amass a great fortune.\n\nBy 1973, Biff had begun to buy up all the land in Hill Valley, which would soon become known to its residents as Hell Valley. George McFly turned the Hill Valley Civic Committee into a secret committee dedicated to stopping BiffCo. Unbeknownst to anyone in the Civic Committee, Emmett Brown was their silent benefactor.\n\nWhen George McFly was secretly murdered by Biff Tannen, and Biff married his widow Lorraine Baines McFly later that year, Doc Brown began to work even harder on his time machine project.\n\nHe allowed the rumors about his madness to spread so that he could work under the nose of everyone in Hill Valley, including BiffCo.\n\nDoc had come up with a time travel chamber built from a 1952 Sears Coldspot refrigerator. Since the only way to reliably get power was to hack into the city's power grid, the 1.21 Jigowatts necessary for time travel could not be sourced. Instead, Doc cut some corners in order to allow it to function.\n\nThe 465.3 megawatt capacity of the power grid would be converted to flux capacitance energy, which would send the time traveler to the date set on the time circuits displayed on a meter inside the chamber door.\n\nThe limitations of using less than half of the energy needed to properly power the chamber meant that there was only four hours of flux energy available before the time bubble protecting the time traveler would burst.\n\nThis would cause the time traveler to fade from existence in the past and re-appear back in the chamber in the present.\n\nAfter Biff had Terry murdered for trying to break into the safe in Tannen Manor in 1983, Biff had his stepson Dave McFly forced out of town, Doc revealed himself and his time machine to the remaining members of the Hill Valley Civic Committee.\n\nStanford S. Strickland recalled a time that, while he was attending Hill Valley Elementary School, Biff was going to be sent to a military academy in Idaho after assaulting other children for the third or fourth time. He remembered the date, May 16, 1946, as it was the day after he celebrated his birthday\n\nDoc connected the chamber to the power grid, and used his JVC camcorder to capture the moment. Stanford S. Strickland, wearing a suit that his father owned, stepped into the chamber and disappeared into the past.\n\nThe remaining members of the Hill Valley Civic Committee unhooked the chamber and put it in a truck to get away before Biff realized where the blackout occurred.\n\nMr. Strickland arrived in the past. He walked to the school, and witnessed Biff picking on a smaller child. George McFly stuck up for the child, and Biff punched George, causing his nose to bleed.\n\nLorraine Baines informed a senior teacher, Miss Hodges, about the bullying, just as the younger Strickland apprehended Biff, calling him a slacker.\n\nThe elder Strickland tried to stop Miss Hodges from intervening, but he was surprised to find out that she was the one who wanted to ship Biff to Idaho, and his younger self stopped her as he believed that Biff could become a good student with the proper guidance.\n\nas Hill Valley High School burned down in 1979 and wasn't rebuilt until at least some point after 1985). He blamed himself for everything and didn't want to interact with anyone.\n\nThe committee decided that the best attempt to stop Biff would be to prevent him from being born, by stopping the wedding of his parents. The only problem was that no records were available before 1950, since everything was lost after Biff bulldozed the Hill Valley Courthouse to build his casino and hotel.\n\nGoldie Wilson realized that they would be able to determine the date by going to the Biff Tannen Museum inside Biff's casino.\n\nUpon arriving at the museum, Doc Brown was required to buy a cigarette and hold it in his hand, due to the museum's \"smoking required\" policy.\n\nHe was already disgusted by the museum, but he pressed himself to go on. He learned that Biff's parents, Myra Benson and Kid Tannen (going by Thomas Tannen after being released from prison), married at the Hill Valley Church of the Heather on December 6, 1936.\n\nDoc went back to the committee, and they developed a plan. Doc would arrive at the wedding, and object to the marriage, stating that the bride is already married to his son \"Melvin\", and that he thinks that she is pregnant.\n\nThe committee then travels once again to the power grid, where the chamber is hooked up. Doc enters the chamber, disappearing into the past, and the city's power goes out again. This time\n\nBiff demands his gang to stop whoever is causing the blackouts.\n\nIn 1936, Doc takes a taxi to the church. He is about to object to the wedding, when he hears a baby crying. When the babysitter calls him Biff, Doc realizes he made a mistake. Myra had become pregnant earlier that year. Kid wanted her to have an abortion, but she wouldn't do it, as it was illegal, and she felt that her mother would kill her if she did.\n\nKid and Myra married simply for the purpose of making it seem like Biff wasn't born out of wedlock. The two parted ways immediately after the wedding, and neither parent wanted Biff. Because of this, Kid's mother, Gertrude Tannen, took custody of him. Before he left his son, Kid gave Gertrude a forged birth certificate that stated that Biff was born on March 28, 1937.\n\nDoc planned to come up with a \"Plan C\" once he arrived in 1983; however, the chamber was now in BiffCo, as the other members of the committee were caught by the Hill Valley Police Department when they couldn't unhook the chamber from the power grid. Biff wanted to know what the refrigerator did, and why it took so much power. Doc refused to tell him, and was committed to Mental Ward B at the Hill Valley Hospital. Sometime prior to 1985, Doc was given a lobotomy, and was placed in permanent residency in the County Asylum.\n\nNon-canon or disputable information ends here.\n\nThe Actions of the Original Doc Brown in Hell Valley\n\nDoc, Marty and Jennifer arrived back in 1985 only to discover that history had been altered.\n\nTo make sense out of all the madness, Doc went to the local library, which was boarded up and shut down, and 'borrowed' some newspapers.\n\nAs he deduced, Biff had taken the time machine and given the sports almanac to his younger self somewhere in the past, who then became a millionaire by placing bets on the chronicled sporting events. As a result,\n\nBiff's wealth had led to a total alteration of Hill Valley to Biff's wishes and supposed alterations to the entire world's history (such as Richard Nixon still being in office and the Vietnam War still being fought in 1985). In this version of history,\n\nDoc has been committed to a psychiatric ward since 1983 (he was committed on the same day he won his award in the \"proper\" history). Doc visited his other self at the asylum, hoping that they would be able to put their heads together to find a solution. Unfortunately, Doc's 1985A self had been lobotomized, and could no longer be communicated with. Since this had prevented this universe's Doc Brown from building the DeLorean Time Machine, this would also be an example of a Grandfather Paradox.[12]\n\nOnce the time bubble burst, Doc, Marty, Jennifer and Einstein would be erased from existence.\n\nBiff also married Marty's mother Lorraine in a sham marriage after Biff killed Marty's father George McFly, of which Biff was never convicted due to corruption in Hill Valley's police force (where Biff literally \"owned\" the police due to his wealth and/or powerful influence).[11]\n\nDoc perceived this alternate reality as proof how time travel can be abused and why the time machine had to be destroyed, after they corrected the timeline.\n\nMarty suggested that they go back to the future to stop 2015 Biff from stealing the time machine, but Doc shot down that plan, for they'd only be going into the future of this reality. After Marty is able to discern that 2015 Biff went back to November 12, 1955, the same day he returned to 1985,\n\nDoc commented that date either has some cosmic significance for the whole space-time continuum or an amazing coincidence.\n\nDoc and Marty headed back to 1955 to correct the timeline, and while Marty tracked down Biff to get the almanac from him, Doc attempted to make repairs to the time circuits, which kept resetting the Destination Time setting to January 1, 1885.\n\nDoc also advised Marty to wait until old Biff gives his younger self the almanac so that he could go back to the future with the DeLorean. Unfortunately, Marty was locked in Biff's garage when Biff of 2015 gave 1955 Biff the almanac.\n\nDoc commandeered a bicycle to rescue him, only for Biff to leave for the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, with Marty still in the back of his car. While making his way back to the DeLorean, Doc came by his past self preparing for the past Marty's return to the future. He gave his younger self a few pointers before walking away to avoid being seen.[11]\n\nUltimately, Marty succeeded in retrieving the almanac. Doc then started the DeLorean to fly to his position. Marty called Doc over the walkie-talkie, stating that Biff's gang is about to jump his past self singing Johnny B. Goode.\n\nDoc advised Marty to covertly stop them otherwise his past self wouldn't make it to the clock tower, thereby resulting in a paradox.\n\nMarty was successfull in protecting his younger self, but lost the almanac to Biff as he was leaving the gym.\n\nDoc picked up Marty and stealthily tailed Biff as he was driving home. They are able to once again snatch the almanac before having Biff slammed into a manure truck for the second time. After that, Marty burned the almanac, setting history straight.\n\nHowever this success was quickly followed by Doc, in the DeLorean, being sent back 70 years to 1885 when a bolt of lightning struck the DeLorean. Simultaneously, a temporal duplicate DeLorean was created and sent forward 70 years to 2025.\n\nOnce in 1885, Doc set himself up as a blacksmith while trying to fix the DeLorean, but had to give up as suitable parts to repair the DeLorean's destroyed microchip would not be invented until 1947, with the invention of the transistor.[4] He buried the DeLorean in the abandoned Delgado Mine on the outskirts of town and wrote a letter to Marty to be delivered just minutes after the DeLorean was struck by lightning. The letter was held by Western Union for the\n\nnext 70 years, and given to Marty in 1955.[11]\n\nIn the Old West\n\nMarty received the letter and ran to 1955 Doc, who had just sent the younger Marty back to the future. Marty and Doc uncovered the DeLorean and repaired it, but his orignal pet, Copernicus discovered that in 1885, Doc would be murdered by Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen, ancestor of Biff.\n\nMarty headed back to September 2, 1885, the day after Doc wrote the letter and five days before Doc's death, to save his friend (Doc of 1885, who had been born in Timeline 2, is not aware of his impending death.\n\nDoc of Timeline 7, born more than 30 years after the 1885 death of Timeline 2 Doc, has seen the tombstone in 1955. Given that the ripple effect does not alter a time traveler's memory-- Marty's memory of his impoverished life is not replaced by memories of growing up in altered timelines -- Doc of 1885 would not know what would happen in the days ahead.[4]\n\nMarty located Doc, and once again Doc had to make repairs to the time machine after it ran out of gasoline (hard to come by in 1885) and accidentally blew out the DeLorean's fuel injector as an effect from using an unusually strong bottle of liquor from the Palace Saloon as a substitute for gas.\n\nWhile making a plan to use a train to push the DeLorean to 88 mph, Doc saved a woman, Clara Clayton, from falling over a ravine after a rattlesnake spooked her horses. They fell in love at first sight, much to the despair of Marty who saw Clara as a distraction.\n\nDoc and Clara danced at the town festival on September 5, where Marty managed to save Doc from being shot by Buford Tannen. Doc and Clara spent the rest of the night looking at the stars with her telescope and discovered that they both loved Jules Verne. They then had their first kiss that night.[4\n\nLater, Doc realized he would have to leave Clara behind when he went back to the future with Marty on Monday. He said goodbye to her and told her the truth about where he came from. Naturally, she did not believe him and slapped him.\n\nBroken-hearted, Doc went to have a shot at the Palace Saloon, where Marty found him next morning (Monday) with the same shot. After drinking the shot, he immediately fell down drunk. Marty and Chester the bartender managed to revive\n\nDoc with an extremely spicy concoction called wake-up juice which included tabasco sauce, however it took until Buford Tannen arrived for his duel with Marty out in the streets.[4]\n\nDoc was taken hostage by Buford's gang after a failed plan to escape the saloon, however, Marty manages to save Doc from being killed just in time for the Marshal Strickland's deputy to arrest Buford and his gang, which caused the image on the photo of the tombstone to erase. Afterward, Doc and Marty hijacked (\"borrowed\", as Doc says) a train to use to push the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour.\n\nClara reappeared, having seen everything and realized Doc was telling the truth, but nearly fell off the train. Doc managed to save her, with help from Marty's hoverboard (a piece of technology from 2015), but got left behind with Clara in 1885. Marty managed to get home, but the time machine was destroyed less than a minute after his arrival, meaning he could not go back to rescue Doc and Clara from the past.[4]\n\nFinding a way home\n\nOver the next 8 years, Doc and Clara married and had two sons, Jules and Verne, named after their favorite author.\n\nDoc began to build a new time machine, this time using a steam locomotive.\n\nBy 1893, the new time machine was complete. Doc and his family attempted to travel to the future, but in an unexpected turn of events, the train was unable to do so.\n\nDoc considered giving up, but was inspired by a steam tricycle to build a smaller, temporary time machine - the steam time car.\n\nHe planned to travel to 2015 and pick up hover technology to upgrade the train back in 1893. Anticipating that the vehicle would fall apart after its first temporal displacement,\n\nDoc devised the time parachute as a backup plan, which used the time circuits from the steam time car as a backpack that would allow the time traveler to fall to temporal displacement. Doc promised his family that he would return safely, and set the time circuits for 2015\n\nAmnesia and reuniting with Marty\n\nImmediately after arriving, Doc crashed into a person, who bounced away as a result of their personal forcefield. This was the first clue that something was not quite right, and after exploring some more.\n\nDoc realized that he had overshot and missed 2015, instead time traveling to 2035. Surprisingly, the steam time car had survived the trip, and Doc hid it for later use.\n\nHe visited his lab to change into more contemporary clothes (though still 20 years out of date), and noticed a note left by Marty McFly dated March 3, 1986. The note specified that Doc had never returned to 1893, which confused him, as he was in no such danger.\n\nSeeing no cause for concern, he headed into town to withdraw money. The bank account had been set up under the alias 'Leroy Brown', but improvements in security technology meant that the bank identified his true genetic age, and concluded that he could not be the same Leroy Brown.\n\nNow wanted by the police, Doc ran back to where he had hidden the steam time car, officer Griff Tannen of the police force in pursuit. Griff sent out a signal designed to incapacitate mandatory futuristic head implants, but since Doc had never had them installed, it damaged his memory instead.\n\nDazed and confused, Doc remembered the date he had seen on the letter - March 3 1986 - and managed to reach temporal displacement.\n\nStill unsure of his surroundings, Doc crashed into a STOP sign, and left the steam time car there while he returned to his secret lab.\n\nHe set off a trap on his entrance, alerting a surprised Marty and Jennifer, who had been investigating his 'disappearance' after receiving a letter from Clara.\n\nThey realized that he could not recall his identity, and helped him retrieve the steam time car from a junkyard that it had been towed to in his absence.\n\nHaving read the last time departed readout, Marty decided to return to 2035 with Doc, to find out what had caused him to lose his memory. They used the time parachute to go to September 16 2035.\n\nDoc and Marty decided to rest at Bistro Twenty/15, as it provided at least some degree of familiarity compared to the otherwise alien era.\n\nUnfortunately, Griff was also present at the bistro, and recognized Doc as the criminal he had chased earlier. Doc and Marty quickly returned to Doc's secret lab, where Doc fully recovered his memory and attempted to find a way to escape 2035.\n\nMarty noted a machine in the center of the room, which had been humming and charging ever since he activated it in 1986. Doc realized that this was the Temporal Field Generator Mk II, which allowed one occupant to return to any hour between its activation and the present.\n\nHaving no choice but to leave Marty behind, Doc traveled to 2015, where he collected supplies for converting the half-finished DeLorean time machine into a working one. He then traveled once again to 1986, arriving at the mall as Jennifer witnessed his previous self and Marty depart via time parachute. He managed to finish the new DeLorean within a few hours, and returned to 2035 with Jennifer.\n\nThey arrived back at the secret lab in time to stop Marty from being arrested by Commisioner Wilson. With Jennifer at the wheel, the three of them escaped Griff, and finally traveled back home to 1986.\n\nDoc drops Marty and Jennifer off at the McFly residence. He gives Marty a bag of canisters, telling him to leave a note in one of them in his secret lab if he ever needs help. He then departs for August 14, 1893, where Clara, Jules and Verne are happy to see him safe.\n\nHe informs them that he only arrived a day late because wanted to make sure that Clara would write the letter that got Marty's attention about his disappearance. He has brought Einstein with him, who happily jumps on Clara, as Doc hugs his sons, Jules and Verne.\n\nThe anniversary present\n\nOn September 7, 1893, Doc was still working on upgrading the Jules Verne Train to a hover-converted version.\n\nClara reminded him that the date was their anniversary, and offered him a gift. Doc, realizing that he had not bought anything for her, hastily retreated to the DeLorean time machine and traveled to 2017, unaware that Verne was hiding in the vehicle.\n\nIn 2017, Doc left the DeLorean to find a suitable gift for Clara, eventually purchasing a copy of Jules Verne's 'The Lighthouse at the End of the World' from Blast from the Past. But as he prepared to leave, he noticed that Verne had come with him to 2017.\n\nSearching for his lost son, Doc discovered that he was safe, and had managed to prevent a robbery while he was gone. Despite Verne's irresponsible behavior, Doc was proud of his son for preventing a crime.\n\nArriving back in 1893, Doc gave his present to Clara, and received his own gift: a notepad and a fountain pen, ironically intended to stop Doc from forgetting important dates.\n\nNote: The following section is considered non-canon or is disputed in canonicity.\n\nThe Brown family eventually moved back to the 20th century and by 1991, Doc had set up the Institute of Future Technology. He also invented an 8-seater DeLorean, which came in handy after Biff stole the time machine again, and visitors to the Institute, sitting in one of these 8-seaters, had to help Doc chase Biff through time.[15]\n\nOn April 22, 1990, Doc arrived at St. Terra Hospital in Anytown after Mother Nature became ill due to the heavy pollution on Earth. Once there, he shared knowledge of the details causing her illness and what could be done to help her with Doogie Howser and several other doctors on staff.[16]\n\nAlso by 1991, Doc, Clara, Jules, and Verne lived in a farmhouse outside Hill Valley with Einstein. The family, along with Marty, traveled through time in both the Jules Verne train time machine and the new DeLorean (which from the outside looked identical to the old one, but was drastically different inside).[17]\n\n21st century\n\nEmmett Brown as rendered in the style of The Simpsons for a video in The Simpsons Ride during 2007.\n\nLittle is known of Doc in the 2000s and 2010s, prior to time travel. Assuming he aged normally in one timeline, he would have been into his 90s and almost 100 by 2015.\n\nAfter his initial trip to the future, however, he explained to Marty that he went to a clinical rejuvenation clinic, replacing, amongst other things, his colon and spleen. This most certainly would have extended his lifespan some.\n\nDoc may have spent some time in the 2000s with his wife Clara and sons Jules and Verne, although the family never settled on one decade, instead choosing to spend their lives in multiple decades, moreover the old West. In 2006, his Institute of Future Technology was replaced by another building.[15]\n\nNon-canon or disputable information ends here.\n\nAlthough he was usually careful about being discreet with the DeLorean, he referred to the time machine as a time machine in public, leading Biff Tannen to use it without Doc's knowledge in an attempt to alter history.\n\nIn 1985, he flew land-based vehicles with hover conversions during the daytime, with no consideration of the possibility of people seeing him.\n\nWriter Bob Gale has denied the rumor that the name Emmett Lathrop was derived by spelling the words \"time\" and \"portal\" backwards.\n\nHe and Robert Zemeckis simply chose names that sounded good and were out of the ordinary, as a contrast with the common last name \"Brown\".\n\nThe \"L\" in Emmett L. Brown's name stands for \"Lathrop\", it has been speculated that this may have been his mother's maiden name, although there is no evidence for this.\n\nThe novelization and screenplays states that he is 65 in 1985, although an episode of the animated series claims he was born in 1922. In Back to the Future: The Game, Emmett is 17 in 1931, which means that he was born in 1914.\n\n\"Christopher Lloyd says that his model for creating the character was actually the conductor Leopold Stokowski, with the hair that way, and the big, broad gestures. Doc Brown walks around like he's conducting the orchestra of the world.\" - Bob Gale In addition, Albert Einstein was an influence to the character.\n\nDoc's family was presumably from the German Empire or Austria-Hungary.\n\nFirst Citizen Brown's balding and spectacled appearance in the game looked similar to Christopher Lloyd's real-life appearance as in the 2010s.\n\nRobert Zemeckis, co-writer/director of the films, has suggested that during the early 1940s, Doc worked on the Manhattan Project (which could explained the reason why the Libyan terrorists specifically picked Doc to build them a nuclear weapon), though this is never mentioned on screen.\n\nLloyd, in the 2009 documentary, said that he had an offer for an off-Broadway theatrical production at the same time that he would be filming Back to the Future, and debated whether to appear on stage, or portraying Doc Brown.\n\nDoc owns a clock that is shown at the beginning of Back to the Future Part I that shows an old man in a jacket and a hat hanging on to the minute hand just like the 1955 Doc later on in the movie and also resembled Harold Lloyd (no relation) in \"Safety Last\"."
