        "text": "RUPAUL is a pop culture legend that has earned a legion of fans with way more than just Drag Race.\n\nFollowing his cameo in Taylor Swift's music video for You Need To Calm Down, and with the UK version of RuPaul's Drag Race is just around the corner, let's take a look at RuPaul's impactful career so far.\n\nWhat is RuPaul's background?\n\nRuPaul Andre Charles is 58 years old having been born on November 17, 1960, in California.\n\nThe San Diego native was named by his mother with \"Ru\" coming from roux, a term for the base of gumbo and other creole soups and soups.\n\nHe is famous for his work as a drag queen, actor, television personality and singer. His show, RuPaul's Drag Race, has won three Primetime Emmy Awards and the iconic television personality is considered to be the most commercially successful drag queen in the US.\n\nHe even made the Time 100 list as one of the most influential people in the world last year, in 2017.\n\nWhat does he look like in and out of drag?\n\nOut of his drag attire, RuPaul is a bald middle-aged man with a fabulous fashion sense.\n\nHe wears black glasses and is often in colourful or printed suits.\n\nHe completely transforms into a voluptuous and glamorous queen when the drag is on.\n\nRuPaul sports a wide variety of wigs that always have volume and look absolutely real.\n\nAs for the outfits, you will see them in a variety of bedazzled, corsetted or intricately-designed gowns.\n\nNeedless to say, the makeup is always impeccable with long fluttery lashes and plump lips.\n\nHas RuPaul appeared in any music videos?\n\nRuPaul is no stranger to making a special appearance in iconic music videos...\n\nLove Shack - The B-52s (1989)\n\nThe star dazzled in a white outfit as he made a cameo in the music video for the classic track.\n\nI Will Survive - Diana Ross (1995)\n\nRuPaul got the chance to work alongside one of his all time heroes, Diana Ross, in the official music video for her cover of Gloria Gaynor's hit.\n\nYou Need To Calm Down - Taylor Swift (2019)\n\nTaylor Swift dropped the video her single for You Need To Calm Down on June 17, 2019.\n\nThe vid is jam-packed with celebrity including RuPaul and the cast of Netflix's The Queer Eye - Tan Frances, Karamo Brown, Jonathan Van Ness, Antoni Porowski, Bobby Berk.\n\nWhat TV show and movie cameos has RuPaul made?\n\nRuPaul first made his TV guest appearance in drag in an 1993 episode of Saturday Night Live, and he's gone on to make countless appearances on both the big and small screen.\n\nSister Sister (1994)\n\nRuPaul played a character called Marje in the popular 90s show, Sister Sister. It saw the star in drag on a kids TV show at a time when that was very rare.\n\nThe Brady Bunch Movie (1995)\n\nRuPaul played the worst guidance counsellor ever known as Mrs Cummings. The character provided the pop culture gem that is \"You better werk!\". He also appeared in the 1996 follow-up, A Very Brady Sequel.\n\nSabrina the Teenage Witch (1998)\n\nSabrina fans will probably remember the episode where Sabrina came face to face with RuPaul in character as The Witch Judge. He had some great one-liners like, \"This is a court of law, not a Hallmark episode\".\n\nThe Weakest Link (2001)\n\nRuPaul once appeared on a celebrity edition of the classic gameshow, The Weakest Link and he managed to handle Anne Robinson's sass.\n\n2 Broke Girls (2017)\n\nThe star made an appearance out of drag to deliver a much needed bit of motivation to Max and Caroline in the popular comedy show.\n\nBroad City (2017)\n\nRuPaul plays the role of Marcel, the manager of a fancy Japanese restaurant called Sushi Mamba.\n\nIlana Wexler nabs a job at the restaurant, where RuPaul teaches her how to be a ‘queen of mean.’\n\nThe Simpsons (2018)\n\nThe star is just one of many famous faces who have been immortalised as a Simpson character. And in drag no less.\n\nGrace and Frankie (2019)\n\nRuPaul guest starred as Benjamin Le Day in the critically acclaimed show starring Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin.\n\nSomeone Great (2019)\n\nThe star plays a drug dealer named Hype in the Netflix original movie starring Jane The Virgin star Gina Rodriguez.\n\nWhat's his net worth?\n\nRuPaul is estimated to be worth $16 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nThat equates to around staggering £12.5 million.\n\nHis wealth is thanks to his hit show, 14 studio albums, countless television series and radio shows, and movie parts."
