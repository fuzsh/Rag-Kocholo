Chairman Nadler. The Judiciary Committee will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time. We welcome everyone to today's hearing on H.R. 5, the Equality Act. I will now recognize myself for an opening statement. Nearly 50 years after the Stonewall uprising, there is still no Federal law that explicitly prohibits millions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender Americans from being denied medical care, being fired from their jobs, or thrown out of their homes simply because of who they are. It is time Congress changes that. Today, the Judiciary considers H.R. 5, the Equality Act. This is long overdue legislation that will explicitly prohibit discrimination against LGBT and gender nonconforming Americans and will strengthen nondiscrimination protections for women and others. Today's hearing also affords us the opportunity to hear about the enduring nature and extent of continuing discrimination faced by LGBT people in various aspects of American life. In 2015, as part of its decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which recognized the fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry, the Supreme Court held, ``The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons within a lawful realm to define and express their identity.'' The Equality Act will help protect and defend that liberty for LGBT individuals, women, and others. At this moment, we have an opportunity to continue our march towards justice, to enshrine in our Nation's laws protections from marginalized communities, to ensure that they can fully participate in key areas of life, and to provide them recourse in the face of discrimination. The act will do so by amending our existing statutes, namely the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Jury Selection and Services Act, and several laws regarding employment with the Federal Government by either adding sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity, as a protected characteristic, or, where sex is already included as a protected characteristic, by explicitly clarifying that sex discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. It will also expand the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to clarify the definition of public accommodations and to ensure that a broader range of establishments, including retail stores and services such as banking, are included for all classes. All forms of discrimination are tied together, and we must address them together. If a black lesbian couple is denied housing they are otherwise qualified for, it is nearly impossible to tell if they were turned away because of their race, their gender, or their sexual orientation. It is time we make clear that none of these are acceptable forms of discrimination. We have already seen the effectiveness of nondiscrimination provisions on the Federal level, and we have seen how sexual orientation and gender identity protections work in the more than 20 States that have them on the books. There is no reason discrimination that is explicitly illegal in one part of the country should not be explicitly illegal in all parts of the country. The Equality Act builds on these existing protections and provides clear recourse for millions of people, no matter where they live. The Equality Act takes special care to maintain the careful balance long established between individual liberties and our compelling interest in promoting nondiscrimination. Freedom of religion is a fundamental American value, and we do not have to choose between nondiscrimination and religious liberty. We have in our existing civil rights laws a road map on how to advance both. Religion is no excuse for discrimination as we have long recognized when it comes to race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, and it should not be when it comes to sexual orientation or gender identity. Many of the arguments against the Equality Act are belied by the experience of the States and localities that have protections already. The scaremongering about potential bathroom predators has not turned out to be true. Protecting the ability for a transgender person to use a facility consistent with their gender identity has not weakened public safety or criminal laws or undermined their enforcement. Similarly, protections for sexual orientation and gender identity will not force religious hospitals or nonprofits to close. New York has these protections. We have Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant hospitals and adoption agencies. And everyone, regardless of who they are or whom they love, is able to receive medically appropriate care and to be served by publicly funded organizations. Many States have sexual orientation and gender identity nondiscrimination laws, and all of them still have women's sports. Arguments about transgender athletes participating in sports in accordance with their gender identity having competitive advantages have not been borne out. Sports have positive impacts on physical, social, and emotional well-being, and we should not be denying transgender athletes those opportunities simply because sometimes they may win. Nor should their occasional success be used as a roadblock to advancing civil rights legislation for LGBT people as a whole. While we are examining the specific provisions of this legislation, the true question before us is much broader and goes to the heart of the country we want this to be. Much of the history of the United States has been expanding the definition of who is understood to be included when the Declaration of Independence says ``All men are created equal.'' When these words were first written, that phrase did not include black and Latino men. It did not include Native Americans. It certainly did not include women, and it did not include LGBT individuals. But we have, as a nation, aspired to expand the definition and ensure that regardless of race, creed, ethnicity, or sex, everyone is able to participate fully in the American way of life. Each advance has been hard fought, whether in Congress, in the courts, or through regulations, or even in a civil war. And it has happened over the objections of people who argued that we were taking away their freedom to discriminate. But as a nation, we have long held that we cannot sit by and be tolerant of intolerance that is designed to demean and to exclude communities. That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the Equality Act. Before I end, I want to take a moment to directly address many of those watching today's hearing who are undoubtedly about to hear their humanity and their right to exist questioned. To the transgender and nonconforming youth, teens, and adults who are about to hear their right to participate in sports and to be themselves in school, work, and in their daily lives challenged; to the same-sex couples who are about to hear suggestions that they just take their business elsewhere, that they adopt children elsewhere, that they exist elsewhere, we see you. We support you. And we believe in you. If you are feeling unsafe, afraid, or at risk, please reach out for help. You are worth fighting for, and we are here to fight alongside you, which is why we will be passing this bill. I want to thank the gentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Cicilline, for introducing this important legislation, and I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses. It is now my pleasure to recognize the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Collins, for his opening statement. Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I look forward today to the really incredibly weighty issue that we do have here in this hearing today, but I also want to note because not just from Republican circles or others, the humanitarian security crisis still at our Southern border rages on, and we have done nothing to address the danger to the migrant children and to the American citizens. This is not just coming from me. This is from the Washington Post. This is from the New York Times and others. So I do look forward to us getting to that as we go forward, just as we are getting to this incredibly, you know, weighty issue today as we go forward. Everyone here can agree there is much suffering in our world. Today, we have the opportunity and obligation to listen to people with different perspectives on how to address equity. As we do that, we stand on the shoulders of the civil rights heroes who fought before like us. Like two of my colleagues here, I am from the Atlanta area, and I have watched over my lifetime as our country has recognized and responded to the disadvantages historically borne by racial minorities and women. We are not here today to betray the Civil Rights Act, but to uphold its ideals. There is no doubt in my mind that men, women, and children who expand their gender dysphoria suffer deeply. Unfortunately, the legislation we are considering would harm countless people who understand themselves to be transgender and would demolish the hard-won rights of women, putting them once again at the mercy of any biological man who identifies at that any moment as a woman. The biological differences between the sexes remain scientific and certain. Men are physically stronger and faster than women, which has made it necessary for women to access clear legal protection. When any man can enter into a protected space, his status in identifying as a woman, as noted by Women's Liberation Front leader, R.R. 5 nullifies women and girls as a coherent legal category worthy of civil rights protection. The bill privileges the rights of men who identify as women over biological women and girls. Consider female sports. Last year, two male athletes won the top two spots in Connecticut girls Class S indoor track meet. Female athlete Selina Soule, who finished eighth, missed an opportunity to compete in front of college coaches by two places. In Selina's words, ``We all know the outcome of the race before it even starts. It is demoralizing.'' Allowing men to compete against women in women's sports isn't demoralizing because female athletes Selina aren't talented. It is demoralizing because it makes their talent irrelevant. Martina Navratilova explained the threat of H.R. 5 poses to women's sports. ``Unless you want to completely remake what women's sports means, there can be no blanket inclusion rule. There is nothing stereotypical about this. It is about fairness, and it is about science.'' In fact, H.R. 5 ignores fairness and denies science in order to codify stereotypes and sexism. If a man who adopts the mannerisms associated with women can receive every Federal protection afforded to women, we have reduced womanhood to a set of stereotypes, the same stereotypes some men chronically exploited for social, professional, and political advantage. H.R. 5 plays into these things that hurt women and girls across every dimension of our society, and it would give these stereotypes the trump card whenever tensions arise between the rights of a transgender person and the rights of a biological woman. The damage H.R. 5 would inflict on vulnerable Americans isn't limited to women. Administering chemotherapy to a healthy, cancer-free patient is malpractice, but H.R. 5 could compel doctors to prescribe hormones and perform major surgeries on adolescents based on their gender identity rather than the biological gender or medical condition. Under this bill, adolescents who can't decide what major to pursue in college would be empowered to force doctors bound by anti-discrimination laws to administer hormones that could render these children sterile and conduct irreversible surgeries. Mothers and fathers who have watched their children deteriorate physically and emotionally as they transition away from their biological sex are begging Congress to listen before we leap. Don't ignore the costs here because they are steep. H.R. 5 erases civil rights protection for biological women. It sets the stage for children to fall victim in permanent and unprecedented ways to the confusion that often characterizes adolescence. If the Democrats are determined to move this legislation forward anyway, we must acknowledge it automatically privileges the rights of biological men over the rights of biological women. This bill will cause suffering that is far-reaching and, in many cases, enduring. Though the women and children have historically been uniquely vulnerable, Democrats are condemning people who advocate for their rights and against H.R. 5 as bigoted. The ideology-driven H.R. 5 is content to see women, lesbians, and families become the collateral damage of identity politics with no basis in science. So I would ask my friends across the aisle not to peddle that notion under H.R. 5 everybody wins. There will be many losers because H.R. 5 bows to the political expediency that silence calls for for fairness, flouts science, and has no compassion for the women and children it marginalizes. And as an ending to my chairman's comment, there is nobody in this world should be mistreated for how they see themselves or how they portray themselves. I believe that that is a gift that is inherently from God and is a spark of life that is put in there not by any man or woman, or anybody created is by the one that creates. Understanding that, we can have differences. We can understand things differently. We can understand when it comes to the law, how laws affect some and hurt others. That is not being mean-spirited. That is not being hurtful. That is just being honest. And they can have discussions today, and we plan on having those discussions. And I appreciate everybody's perspective that is going to be here. But to challenge the motive of what my disagreement may be as to people that I don't even know and that I could come to love and care is wrong. For me, this is about looking at a bill and saying what is right or wrong about this bill. And when we understand that, we can have bigger discussions as we go forward. That is where you have true conversations of love. That is where you have true conversations of compassion. And we can disagree on that, but talk about a bill that inherently does have bad effects intended with it. As we go forward, I look forward to the discussion. I look forward to our side and both sides having this discussion, and I appreciate the chairman's time. And with that, I yield back. Chairman Nadler. I thank the gentleman.

TESTIMONIES OF SUNU CHANDY, LEGAL DIRECTOR, NATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW CENTER; DENNIS WILEY, PASTOR EMERITUS, COVENANT BAPTIST UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST; CARTER BROWN, FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, BLACK TRANSMEN, INC.; JULIA BECK, FORMER LAW AND POLICY CO-CHAIR, BALTIMORE CITY'S LGBTQ COMMISSION; DORIANE LAMBELET COLEMAN, PROFESSOR OF LAW, DUKE LAW SCHOOL; JAMI CONTRERAS, MICHIGAN RESIDENT; TIA SILAS, VICE PRESIDENT AND GLOBAL CHIEF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIONS OFFICER, IBM CORPORATION; AND KENJI YOSHINO, CHIEF JUSTICE EARL WARREN PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW TESTIMONY OF SUNU CHANDY Ms. Chandy. Good morning. Chair Nadler, Ranking Member Collins, and members of the Judiciary Committee, thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony in support of H.R. 5, the Equality Act. My name is Sunu Chandy. I am the legal director of the National Women's Law Center. The center has worked for more than 45 years to advance women's equality and to remove barriers created by sex discrimination. Before joining the center, I served in senior leadership roles at Federal and local civil rights agencies. And for 15 years before that, I was a civil rights litigator. I have been active with LGBTQ organizations, including currently as a board member with the Transgender Law Center and in the past as a leader with South Asian LGBTQ organizations. A few years ago, when my daughter's first grade classmate said to her on the playground, ``But wait, you can't have two moms,'' I am so proud that my daughter went to the principal and got her from the side to help explain that, yes, in fact, she can. We are urging Congress to pass the Equality Act so that all kids can have legal protections, no matter their family structure. But as with any bill that seeks to amend existing civil rights laws, the Equality Act must be enacted in a way that expands and never retreats from our commitment to existing civil rights protections. Support of the Equality Act is key to the National Women's Law Center's mission and critical for our collective liberation against sex discrimination, as outlined here. First, the Equality Act would provide explicit protections for LGBTQ people in employment, housing, credit, education, public spaces and services, federally funded programs, and jury service. The U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized that discriminating against someone because she does not conform to gender stereotypes is sex discrimination. The Equality Act would make these protections for LGBTQ individuals explicit in Federal statutory law. Second, the act would ensure that all women, including LGBTQ individuals, would gain protections against sex discrimination in public spaces. This means individuals, including those who are pregnant, who experience sex discrimination, including sex harassment, while in spaces such as restaurants or stores would have a legal remedy through the Equality Act. Third, the act would ensure that individuals gain new protections against sex discrimination by entities that take Federal dollars--schools, community centers, homeless shelters. The Equality Act would prohibit sex discrimination in these spaces. Finally, the act ensures additional protections in public spaces, that they extend to all relevant entities. People of color continue to face discrimination regularly in stores or when seeking taxis. The Equality Act would prohibit this kind of discrimination. The act protects freedom of religion also through existing thoughtful exemptions contained within the Federal civil rights statutes that protect religious actors from Government intrusion. For example, the current laws exempt private entities that are not open to the public. Churches can hold services, spaghetti dinners, and limit their entry to their members. The current law allows religious entities to limit employment to members of their own faith, and they require religious accommodations for employees. The current law also provide that religious entities are exempt from fair housing laws if they're being--using a dwelling for a noncommercial purpose or in small buildings where the owner lives on the premises. In addition to maintaining all these religious exemptions, the Equality Act clarifies that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act cannot be misused to allow violations of Federal civil rights laws. This does not eliminate RFRA but limits its reach, so it can't be used to defend against civil rights claims. The Equality Act represents a significant advancement for all women and girls, and I want to be clear. The National Women's Law Center supports the act's requirement that transgender women and girls be included with other women and girls in gender-specific spaces, including in sports programs. Our country has a history of attempting to justify sex discrimination by asserting that it is protecting women. Just as this rationale fell short when excluding women from opportunities, it does not work now. The National Women's Law Center has represented women and girls seeking athletic opportunities, equal employment, and protection from sexual violence for decades, and this includes women and girls who are transgender. We are firmly committed to advancing the Equality Act because it will advance opportunities for all women and girls. As a woman, a person of color, and a parent in a two mommy family, I need the Equality Act. And as the daughter of a Christian minister and school teacher, immigrants from a small village in Kerala, India, it has been quite a journey towards family acceptance. Gaining explicit Federal law protections provides not only legal rights, but an increased measure of dignity. Over decades, through the courage of individuals coming forward with claims of discrimination, we have collectively expanded the scope of civil rights protections as one tool in our work for justice. We urge Congress to pass the Equality Act. Thank you. [The statement of Ms. Chandy follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler. Thank you. Reverend Brown--Reverend Wiley, rather. I am sorry. TESTIMONY OF REVEREND DOCTOR DENNIS WILEY Rev. Wiley. Good morning. My name is the Reverend Doctor Dennis W. Wiley, pastor emeritus of the Covenant Baptist United Church of Christ in Washington, D.C., which I pastored along with my wife, the Reverend Doctor Christine Y. Wiley, for 32 years. I am a liberation theologian, a community activist, and a social justice advocate. As a religious leader, I am here today to express my full, unequivocal support of the Equality Act. My support is based on my religious upbringing, my personal experience, and the influence of prophetic trailblazers like the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr. In a speech titled ``The American Dream'' delivered at Lincoln University in 1961, King observed that while morality cannot be legislated, behavior can be regulated. In other words, according to King, ``It may be true that the law can't make a person love me, but it can keep that person from lynching me.'' Born and raised in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, until the age of 14 during the 1950s and '60s, I never witnessed the horror of lynching, but I did experience the injustice of racial segregation. Because of the color of my skin, I lived in a segregated neighborhood, attended segregated schools, shopped at segregated stores, ate at segregated restaurants, drank from segregated water fountains, used segregated restrooms, rode segregated buses, and sat in the balcony of a segregated movie theater after entering the side door and climbing 14 flights of stairs. And while I was constantly surrounded by the love of family, neighbors, church members, teachers, and friends, I could not help but notice that there was a sharp line of division, primarily between the black world in which I lived and the white world to which I was exposed only through television and in the movies. And so to add insult to injury, courts and the public framed laws enforcing segregation and banning interracial marriage as morally sound and founded in Christian heritage. And so it was not until I moved to the Nation's capital in the same year that the 1964 Civil Rights Act was passed that I experienced white teachers, white classmates, and integrated public facilities for the very first time. And it was from that vantage point that my soul was able to look back and find solace in the slow and usually begrudging American evolution from a country in which systemic racism permeated our laws to one with comprehensive civil rights protections in employment, public accommodations, and at the ballot box. All too often the racist laws that reinforced racism were justified and maintained by arguments purportedly rooted in religion, and the same is true for laws that failed to protect our LGBTQ brothers and sisters from those who would condemn them for who they are and who they love. When my wife and I accepted the challenge to leave Covenant to become a beloved community that welcomes and affirms all, including LGBTQ persons, I was reminded that King once said, ``Cowardice asked the question, `Is it safe?' Expediency asked the question, `Is it politic?' And vanity comes along and asks the question, `Is it popular? But conscience asked the question, `Is it right?' '' Well, we did what we did at Covenant not because it was safe, politic, or popular, but because we believed it was right. And I feel the same way today about supporting the Equality Act. As our LGBTQ brothers and sisters move around this Nation, they should never have to fear losing a job, being evicted from a house or apartment, refused service at a restaurant, denied approval for a loan, or rejected admission to a school because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. And so, in closing, I am reminded that a couple of years after we agreed to perform union ceremonies at our church, we went to New York to see our younger daughter act in a play toward the end of her second year at Julliard. Shortly after we arrived in the city, she stopped by our hotel room for a visit because she said she wanted to share something with us. It was then that she came out to us as a lesbian. We were shocked because we did not see this coming. However, I immediately got up, went over to her, gave her a big hug, and told her how much I love her. My wife was a little slower responding, not because she was disappointed or upset, but because being a mother, she was afraid of what danger our daughter might face. Well, I am happy to tell you today that my daughter, Samira Wiley, is doing just fine as a successful, Emmy Award-winning actress who is happily married to the love of her life, Lauren Morelli. Not every LGBTQ kid is as lucky as Samira. But when I told Samira that I would be giving this testimony today, she wanted me to be sure to tell you that if we, her parents, had not accepted her for who she is, she would not have the courage, the confidence, or the self-esteem to be not only a successful actress, but also a positive role model for other LGBTQ persons. So let us make sure that the Equality Act becomes law so that all of our beautiful, promising, gifted LGBTQ citizens just like my daughter and daughter-in-law can live their lives free of fear, free of bigotry, and free of discrimination. [The statement of Rev. Wiley follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler. Thank you very much. Mr. Brown. TESTIMONY OF CARTER BROWN Mr. Brown. My name is Carter Brown, and I am honored to submit this testimony in support of the Equality Act and in support of the millions of hard-working Americans whose livelihoods have been threatened by the lack of clear, permanent workplace protections. Each day, workers across the country are subject to anti- LGBTQ discrimination and harassment that denies them the fair chance to earn a living. I know this because it happened to me. I once believed that I was the embodiment of the American dream. My early days were spent in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep food on the table. I had even briefly experienced homelessness at the age of 14 while a student in high school. Determined to break the cycle of poverty, I fought hard to earn my diploma and was the first in my family to go to college. I learned I had a penchant for real estate and entered the field determined to be a success story. In the following years, I married my best friend, and we welcomed our daughter into the world. I felt a responsibility, as many new husbands and fathers do, to provide for my family. So I continued to work hard and established myself in my career. I earned 3 promotions in only 2 years, enabling me to purchase our first home. These visual markers of success were proof that the American dream had not eluded me, but that it was clutched firmly in my hand. And then one day, I arrived to work and discovered that a coworker had outed me as a transgender man. Everything around me shattered. In the months that followed, I was the subject of cruel office gossip and forced to endure invasive and defensive questioning from colleagues on the subject of my identity. When they weren't asking me to use other bathrooms or questioning me about my private life, my coworkers excluded me from work lunches and avoided me in the halls. I was suddenly isolated in a field where communication and teamwork was essential to doing my job. To my coworkers, being transgender eclipsed everything. I began to dread coming into work and often spent lunch breaks alone, crying in my car. I was fired shortly after, and despite my previous achievements and excellent work performance, my termination from work was lawful. In my home State of Texas, there are no explicit State statutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. In fact, 30 States in total-- that is more than half of the country--have no statutory protections whatsoever for LGBTQ workers who do experience discrimination in the workplace. How can the American dream be realized when a majority of States have failed to extend equal access and equal opportunity to its citizens? My experience left me embarrassed and vulnerable. I was overwhelmed trying to cope with the crushing lack of financial security. As a result of being fired, I was forced to cash out my 401K and defer auto loans and mortgage payments just to keep my family afloat. We lost our health insurance and had to depend on Medicaid to care for my daughter's special health needs. It would be an understatement to say that the loss of my job caused my family significant economic and emotional turmoil. And my experience is not uncommon. LGBTQ Americans rightfully fear being outed at work will cause them to lose their jobs, be passed over for promotions, or suffer lost wages. It should come as no surprise that more than half of LGBTQ workers hide their LGBTQ identity at work. The Equality Act is simple. It amends existing civil rights law to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected characteristics to provide consistent and explicit nondiscrimination--I am sorry, explicit nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people across key areas of life. In addition to these changes, the Equality Act updates the Civil Rights Act to more fully reflect the way we live our lives today. This amendment to the Civil Rights Act simply modernizes protections that will not only protect me as a transgender man, but my family and many people who I love. Texas is one of the only five States in the country that has no State-level public accommodation statute. This means that my family can still be denied service at a store or by a public car service because of my race without any legal resource, for example. All Americans, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, need permanent and explicit nondiscrimination laws to protect them in the workplace. If the Equality Act had been in place during my employment, it would have been illegal for my employer to engage in harassment and fire me because I was transgender. My family would not have had to shoulder the burden of my loss of income and worry about my emotional health. I understand that not everyone shares my values, and I may never change their minds. But we can change the law. A person's sexual orientation or gender identity has nothing to do with their ability to do their job. But now because there are no clear Federal protections in place for LGBTQ workers, passing this historic piece of legislation has everything to do with our survival. Thank you. [The statement of Mr. Brown follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler. Thank you. Ms. Beck. TESTIMONY OF JULIA BECK Ms. Beck. Thank you to Chair Nadler, Vice Chair Scanlon, and Ranking Member Collins for welcoming my testimony in consideration of the Equality Act. If the act passes in its current form as H.R. 5, then every right that women have fought for will cease to exist. H.R. 5 is a human rights violation. Every person in this country will lose their right to single-sex sports, shelters, grants, and loans. The law will forbid ever distinguishing between women and men. To be clear, I do support the general goal of the Equality Act, to protect people on the basis of sex, a physical and immutable biological reality; to protect sexual orientation, which is based on biological sex. I object to the inclusion of gender identity. People who call themselves transgender, nonbinary, and everything in between still deserve the same basic human rights that we all do, but treating someone as if they are a member of the opposite sex is not a civil right. In fact, this violates the rights of others. People cannot change sex, no matter how many legal documents they alter. No matter how many dangerous surgeries they endure. This myth of changing sex has gained considerable traction not only because of the synonymous use of the words ``sex'' and ``gender,'' but also because trans activism is extremely well funded, with billionaire donors and a very deep sea of lobbyists. Sex is a vital characteristic. Gender and identity are not. Sex can never be changed, but gender changes all the time. One hundred years ago, pink was a color for boys. Now pink is a girl's color. This is an example of gender, social expectations of appearance, and behavior. These expectations are based on sex stereotypes that prevent people from being their authentic selves. Unfortunately, gender identity forces people back into these stereotypical sex roles. This bill defines gender identity as ``actual or perceived gender-related characteristics.'' This is a circular definition, a logical fallacy. There is no way to protect a person on the basis of their gender identity without a legitimate definition. Lawmakers across the country will have to consider which mannerisms, hair styles, occupations, and clothing choices make up one gender identity or another. How is this any different from the sex stereotypes women have been fighting to break free from? How is this not regressive? The concept of gender identity suggests that there is an essentially female personality or feeling that a person can have, but no such thing as a female body. Making gender identity the law will, in fact, mandate a belief in a female penis or female testes. The concept of--excuse me, deep down, deep down I believe that you have good intentions, but gender identity only does harm. Let me tell you what happens if H.R. 5 passes. Male rapists will go to women's prisons and will likely assault female inmates, as has already happened in the UK. Female survivors of rape will be unable to contest male presence in women's shelters. Men will dominate women's sports. Girls who would have taken first place will be denied scholastic opportunity. Women who use male pronouns to talk about men may be arrested, fined, and banned from social media platforms. Girls will stay home from school when they have their periods to avoid harassment by boys in mixed sex toilets. Girls and women will no longer have a right to ask for female medical staff or intimate care providers, including elderly or disabled women who are at serious risk of sexual abuse. Female security officers will no longer have the right to refuse to perform pat down or intimate searches of males who say they are female. And women undergoing security checks will no longer have the right to refuse having those searches performed by men claiming a feminine identity. For a good look at how lesbians are impacted by gender ideology and legislation, please read ``Lesbians at Ground Zero,'' a survey from the UK about the harassment of lesbians in clear spaces, which I request to be placed in the hearing record. Everything I just listed is already happening, and it is only going to get worse if gender identity is recognized in Federal law. The authors of this bill have done a lot of work to make it sound like gender identity is well understood and has been around for a long time. But it is a new concept that can only ever refer to stereotypes and unverifiable claims. The witnesses for the majority will talk about medical conditions and desperate unhappiness that everyone is surely sympathetic to, but this bill doesn't reference any medical condition. And unhappiness isn't a sex class, nor is it a reasonable category of civil rights protection. Everyone experiences unhappiness. So I would ask the Members to strike the gender identity provisions of this bill and instead consider protecting all forms of self-expression and loving relationships under stronger sex stereotype discrimination provisions. Sex stereotype nondiscrimination could equally cover both Rupaul and Caitlyn Jenner in their rights to housing and employment, but only if we accurately recognize everyone's biological sex. I thank the Republicans who invited me here, and I urge my fellow Democrats to wake up. Please acknowledge biological reality. Thank you for your time. [The statement of Ms. Beck follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler. Thank you. Professor Coleman. TESTIMONY OF DORIANE LAMBELET COLEMAN Ms. Coleman. Good morning. Thank you for inviting me to testify today. My name is Doriane Coleman. I am a professor of law at Duke Law School, and I support equality. As Chairman Nadler noted, the legal history of our country is in part a chronology of efforts designed to give meaning and effect to the original commitment in 1776, ``All men are created equal.'' The work is ongoing for those of us who weren't originally meant to be its beneficiaries. As the milestones reflect, the lesson is that different groups experience inequality for different reasons at the hands of different people and in different ways so that tailoring an effective remedy requires attention to those differences. Although the Nation benefits as equality expands, in fact, only some of us needed the Emancipation Proclamation and Brown v. Board of Education. Only some of us need Title IX and the Violence Against Women Act. Approaches to equality that elide relevant differences are not only ineffective, they actually serve as cover for ongoing inequality. I have recently encountered advocacy that exemplifies this problem. The argument is that because some males identify as women, some women have testes. From this, it follows that sex and sex-linked traits can't be the grounds for distinctions on the basis of sex because this excludes women with testes. This leaves gender identity as the only legitimate basis for classifying someone into, for example, girls- and women-only spaces and opportunities. I support equality, including for the LGBTQ community, but I don't support the current version of H.R. 5 because I say this with--because, and I say this with enormous respect for everyone who is working on the bill, it elides sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. It is all sex discrimination, and at least impliedly, we are all the same. In opting for what is in effect a sex-blind approach to sex discrimination law, the legislation would serve as cover for disparities on the basis of sex. Sex is not just a concept. Females have and continue to be treated differently precisely because of our reproductive biology and stereotypes about that biology. The legal fiction that females and women with testes are the same for all purposes will take us backward, not forward. I was asked to testify today because I have longed worked in the one area where this is most clear, Title IX and opportunities for girls and women in sport. Title IX, which requires schools to invest in male and female athletes equally, undoubtedly powers invaluable outcomes not only for the many individuals who are benefitted by its terms, but also for society in general. Those of us who are athletes know that separation on the basis of sex is necessary to achieve equality in this space. Among scientific experts, it is accepted beyond dispute that males and females are materially different with respect to the main physical attributes that contribute to athletic performance. They agree that the primary reason for sex differences in these attributes is exposure in gonadal males to much higher levels of testosterone during growth and development and throughout the athletic career. This literally builds the male body in the respects that matter for sport. The first figure in my statement shows what we mean by much higher levels of testosterone. The second demonstrates how sex differences in athletic performance emerge coinciding with the onset of puberty, and the third illustrates the effects of those differences, again starting in adolescence. The third marks the individual lifetime bests of three female Olympic champions in the 400 meters, including Team USA's Sanya Richards-Ross and Allyson Felix in the sea of male body performances run in a single year, 2017. It shows that the very best women in the world would lose to literally thousands of boys and men, including to thousands who would be considered second tier in the men's category. And because it only takes three male-bodied athletes to preclude the best females from the medal stand, it doesn't matter if only a handful turn out to be gender nonconforming. If U.S. law changes so that we can no longer distinguish females from women with testes for any purpose, we risk not knowing the next Sanya Richards-Ross or the next Allyson Felix. We risk losing the extraordinary value that comes from having women like Serena Williams, Aly Raisman, and Ibtihaj Muhammad in our lives and on the medal stand. If they bother to compete, they would be relegated to participants in the game. One prominent trans activist has said that we shouldn't be concerned that the victories would belong to trans girls and women going forward because what matters is their liberty to self-identify and their right to be treated equally throughout society. Others, including some in the Title IX advocacy community, have embraced this evolution, arguing that what we should care about is participation. These advocates are right to seek avenues for transgender inclusion. But listen carefully to the particular bargain they are willing to strike. In effect, it is that we don't need parity of competitive opportunity. They are wrong about this. Participation contributes to equality for females, but the real power of sport isn't in gym class. It is in teams, competitions, and victories. It is in the same numbers of athletic scholarships and of spots in finals and on podiums. It is in the fact that Brandi Chastain can win Worlds, celebrate like the guys, and get a whole generation of little girls to play soccer because she did. It is in the fact that Simone Manuel can win Olympic gold in the 100-meter free with millions watching on primetime television and from there can lead a generation of African- American kids to the pool who didn't believe that swimming was for them. I encourage you to consider revisions to H.R. 5 that provide protections for sexual orientation and gender identity that don't risk these invaluable goods and that are otherwise thoughtful about the circumstances in which sex still matters. Thank you. [The statement of Ms. Coleman follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler.Thank you. Ms. Contreras. TESTIMONY OF JAMI CONTRERAS Ms. Contreras. Thank you for taking the time to hear my family's story. Four and a half years ago, my 6-day-old daughter was denied medical services by our handpicked pediatrician. This was after we made very strategic and intentional decisions to do everything in our power to avoid this very act of discrimination from happening. You see, about 7 years ago, my wife, Krista, and I were living in my small hometown located in West Michigan. After deciding we were ready to start a family, we made the hard decision to pack up our lives and relocate 230 miles to the Metro Detroit area, hoping to ensure our future children would grow up in an accepting community free from discrimination. We ended up finding the perfect house, located in one of the most LGBTQ-friendly towns, which has a good school district, close-knit community, and above all, it is safe. Not long after we purchased our home, we found out my wife was pregnant with our first child. We were elated. Doing what any good parents would do, we started to research pediatricians. We asked for help on social media forums and obtained referrals from people we knew. My wife and I both made sure to attend every interview with potential pediatricians, making it very clear this was a two helicopter mom family. After several interviews, the search was over. We had found a pediatrician that met all of our requirements. She was personable, energetic, listened to our concerns, was able to talk through her medical philosophy and explain things in a way we could understand, and she didn't seem too concerned we were two moms. We left that meeting with her telling us just to call her office after the baby is born and set the appointment. Well, a few months later, our amazing baby girl, Bay Windsor Contreras, was born. We followed the doctor's orders, made our first appointment, and we were so excited for that appointment. As new parents, we were craving that reassurance that we were just doing everything right, and our baby was healthy and happy. When we arrived at the office, they escorted us in our room. We waited for our doctor, excited to show her off. But when a different doctor walked in the room, she introduced herself and then started in with the appointment. Krista and I, confused, had to stop the doctor to ask, ``I am sorry. Where is Dr. Roi?'' She proceeded to tell us Dr. Roi would not be seeing us, and she would be Bay's doctor today. When asked why, she stated Dr. Roi had prayed on it, and she decided she would not be able to take Bay on as a client. My stomach sank, my eyes filled with water, and the lump in my throat felt like a rock. I remember staring at my new baby, who was now being examined by a doctor we had never met, and all I could think was what have we done? How did we get here? We did everything within our power to avoid this very moment. We literally moved across State. We spent endless hours of research and interviews just to avoid this very situation. Yet here we were. It was our job to protect her, and there we were, only 6 days into the most important jobs of our lives, and we had already failed. While checking out, the receptionist asked if we wanted to make another appointment. We declined and stated we would not be back, to which she told us she understood, showing us full well she knew exactly what was going on before we even did. It was a somber ride home from that appointment. Krista rode in the back seat with Bay as I drove home fighting back tears. Instead of leaving that appointment with reassurance, we were left with nothing but fear and more questions. My mind was racing with a question that still haunts me to this day. What is next? Will we be asked to leave a restaurant, not allowed to sign her up for a soccer team? Will we be denied access to the school of our choice? Or worse, are we going to be refused help by an EMT? The only silver lining in our story is that she was 6 days old rather than 6 years old. So we luckily didn't have to try to find the words to explain to her what had just happened in that moment. However, she is now at an age where she is starting to ask questions. We have to explain why mommy and mama are sometimes on TV or have to take trips like this one. She impresses me with her ability to comprehend the concept of equality. She often responds with questions, such as ``Why, mama? It is okay to be different.'' Or what she said when I asked her if I should come here today. She said, ``You have to go, mama, because you can help all families, not just ours, feel safe.'' When people ask us why we keep speaking up with the risk that comes with putting our family in the public eye, my wife and I know all too well, no amount of planning can avoid discrimination. We have to keep sharing our story to let people know this is happening to people like us and families like ours every day. And the only protection has to come from our Government. We need our Government to send the message that all Americans are equal. This is where you come in. We are calling on you to pass the Equality Act. Please help me show my daughter and my son that our family and all LGBTQ people have the right to feel safe in the communities they live. Thank you. [The statement of Ms. Contreras follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler. Thank you. Ms. Silas. TESTIMONY OF TIA SILAS Ms. Silas. Good morning, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Collins, and esteemed members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me to testify before you today. My name is Tia Silas, and I am the vice president, global chief diversity and inclusion officer for IBM. I am responsible for creating and implementing IBM's diversity and inclusion strategy in over 170 countries around the world, advocating for fairness and equality, which we believe to be core to 100 years of success. I am honored to speak at today's important hearing on the Equality Act to discuss IBM's longstanding and strong support for the legislation, as well as to provide the committee with an overview of IBM's proud history of inclusive LGBT+ policies. At the outset, I wish to highlight a March 7, 2019, letter of support for the Equality Act signed by IBM's chairman, president, and chief executive officer, Ms. Ginni Rometty, in her capacity as chairman of the Business Roundtable's Education and Workforce Committee and on behalf of all Business Roundtable members' companies and their 15 million employees. A copy of that letter has been submitted with my testimony. I would like to provide the committee with several reasons why the Equality Act's affirmative nondiscrimination protections for LGBT+ individuals across the areas of housing, public education, credit, public services and spaces, and jury service make good business and economic sense. IBM's core business objectives are to hire the best, most talented individuals regardless of their gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, or other personal characteristics .Let me outline why. Diversity of talent ensures differentiated innovation. In order to remain one of the leading companies in the world, we seek to recruit, hire, retain the best talent anywhere, irrespective of any singular factor of a person's identity. We value a workforce that reflects the diversity of society so that we can create solutions that are both relevant and revolutionary. We don't want our employees and their families to be limited in where they can safely and comfortably live and work. Employees must live without fear of their personal safety and security, regardless of where they reside. Without affirmative protections, employees may feel forced to be on guard so as to not inadvertently reveal their LGBT+ status. This creates stress and distracts individuals from being productive. Like other companies, IBM's business location and investment decision-making process factors in discrimination- related legislation and policies. The United States already faces a shortage of qualified and experienced talent in key technology growth areas, such as artificial intelligence, block chain, quantum computing, cybersecurity, healthcare, and so much more. It is in the best interests of the country to ensure that all talented individuals have equal opportunity and are able to pursue careers in these and other critical fields. The Equality Act tracks State-level statutes that have already proven successful. But at the same time, we are extremely concerned about the patchwork of noncomprehensive protections. The inconsistency and multiplicity of statutes, both positive and negative, begs for a Federal minimum standard of basic protections that extend to all LGBT+ individuals nationwide. As IBM's chief diversity officer, I am fortunate to design and implement many inclusive policies, collaboration tools, and benefits to support IBM's LGBT+ communities, allies, and families. In my testimony, I articulate many proud moments in our history. However, in my time here today, I will highlight some of our current offerings. IBM offers transgender inclusive healthcare benefits. We have 52 LGBT+ employee resource and affinity groups around the world. We require all U.S. contractors to comply with nondiscrimination standards. We have launched employee and general public training and certification programs about LGBT+ inclusivity. We sponsor an LGBT+ executive council, which includes leadership from a senior vice president who reports directly to IBM's chairman, signifying IBM's top executive support for inclusion. IBM believes that fostering inclusive work environments goes beyond employment practices and protections. That is why we strongly support the Equality Act and the extension of protections it proposes across so many critical areas of society. Our country's future economic success depends on it. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today. I look forward to answering your questions. [The statement of Ms. Silas follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler. Thank you. Professor Yoshino. TESTIMONY OF KENJI YOSHINO Mr. Yoshino. Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Collins, and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to be with you here today. My name is Kenji Yoshino, and I am the Chief Justice Earl Warren Professor of Constitutional Law at New York University School of Law. This year marks the 50th year anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, which inaugurated the modern LGBT rights movement. Fittingly, the Supreme Court just last term stated, ``Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth. For that reason, the laws and the Constitution can and in some instances must protect them in the exercise of their civil rights.'' By passing the Equality Act, Congress will bring the Nation closer to realizing that promise. I will summarize six points about the act that I have made in my written testimony. First, the act is necessary. Despite the extraordinary strides that society has made in the past few decades, LGBT individuals continue to face broad forms of social and economic discrimination. Recent studies have shown that one in five lesbian, bisexual, and gay individuals and about one in three transgender individuals reported unfair treatment in employment decisions. In some 29 States, no law explicitly prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, or public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Second, Congress is authorized to pass the Equality Act under both the commerce clause of the United States Constitution and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. In 1964, the Court found that Congress could use the commerce power to promulgate the landmark Civil Rights Act, which today's Equality Act both mirrors and extends. Further, Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment gives Congress the power to pass legislation to ensure all Americans the equal protection of our laws, as the Equality Act seeks to do. Third, the act represents an exemplary application of the principles of American federalism. More than 20 States have explicit laws against discrimination in employment and housing on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. As Justice Brandeis famously said, the States are laboratories of experimentation.We have seen these experiments succeed as millions of LGBT Americans have gained dignitary rights in their home States. Meanwhile, the risks that detractors threaten have not materialized. Studies have found no evidence that protecting transgender people from discrimination leads to any increase in safety incidents in gender-segregated bathrooms or locker rooms. Further, trans women athletes have not broadly displaced nor disadvantaged non-trans women and girls when allowed to compete in accordance with their gender identity. Fourth, a majority of Federal circuit courts nationwide have already interpreted Federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination to include discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. By codifying this sound set of precedents, Congress would ensure that the applicability of Federal law does not depend on where an American resides. Fifth, the Equality Act advances civil equality for LGBT individuals while respecting religious freedom. The claim that the act compromises religious liberties ignores the existing exemptions in the civil rights laws that the Equality Act would amend, such as the exception the Fair Housing Act makes for religious organizations to prefer people of the same religion when selling or renting commercial space. This claim also scants the safeguards instilled in the free exercise clause of the United States Constitution. As cases ranging from the Lukumi Babalu Aye case to the Masterpiece Cakeshop case demonstrate, any misapplication predicated on religious animus would swiftly falter. Sixth, the act validly reaches conduct as well as status. Some have argued that sexual orientation and gender identity are distinguishable from protected classifications like race or sex because they are defined partly by conduct rather than by status alone. This distinction is unavailing. Civil rights protections in this Nation have never been limited to status alone. Neither religious conduct nor pregnancy are immutable characteristics, yet both are protected under Title VII. I will close with how I introduced myself as the Chief Justice Earl Warren Professor of Constitutional Law. When that title was offered to me by my then dean, I rejected it. I reminded him that I was of Japanese descent, and that, as Attorney General of California, Earl Warren superintended the internment of people of Japanese ancestry. In his wisdom, my dean responded that after he became Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Earl Warren not only expressed regret for his role in the internment but was the author of our Nation's most honored civil rights opinion. What better title could I have than the name of someone who had traveled so far on issues of civil rights over the course of a single lifetime. So I now wear this title with pride, wondering in how many countries a racial minority could move so quickly from being outside the protection of the Constitution to holding a place of honor as a scholar and teacher of that hallowed document. I consider it a matter of grace that I can tell the same story in a different register. I am a gay man who was born the year of the Stonewall Riots. Because of judicial and legislative decisions like the one you are asked to make today, I married my husband 10 years ago, and together, we are raising a son and daughter. Despite all the forms of privilege we possess as a family, we still feel unsafe traveling to certain areas of this country. Even in our home State of New York, we have experienced acts of exclusion and bias. In those moments, I worry less about myself and more for my young children. As Dr. King did for his own 6-year-old daughter when she faced discrimination in a public accommodation, I fear seeing the ``ominous clouds of inferiority begin to form in their little mental sky.'' So it is no small matter you consider today. In the last half century, I have walked two versions of the American dream. That journey has led me to believe that the experience of discrimination on the basis of race on the one hand and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity on the other are not entirely different. And it has led me to believe the dignity the law can bestow in welcoming us into the light of the public sphere is entirely the same. Thank you. [The statement of Mr. Yoshino follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler. Thank you. I thank the witnesses. We will now proceed under the 5-minute rule with questions. I will begin by recognizing myself for 5 minutes, and I have three questions for Ms. Chandy. Ms. Beck objects to the addition of gender identity as a protected characteristic in our civil rights laws because she believes that treating someone as if they are a member of the opposite sex is not a civil right. What is your response to that? Ms. Chandy. Yes. Listening to that testimony, it seems like that particular witness does not believe that transgender people exist, and personally I have sort of worked in a volunteer capacity over the last 25 years with LGBTQ organizations, and I just want to say that no one up here are doctors or scientists, so we are talking about our experience with people and how that fits into the law for today. And so I have met numerous transgender individuals who are trans women and girls who are women and girls. In terms of the biology piece, biology is made up by so many different things, as I understand it, not just external sex organs. There are hormones. There are internal things. And so all of these things make up a person. And so transgender women and girls are women and girls. Transgender boys and men are boys and men, as we have heard. So to basically have someone say that does not exist, and then to say that people will go so far as to make up an entire identity, change their pronouns, maybe engage in medical treatment to just simply invade sex-segregated spaces or participate in sports is so outlandish, it is so far-fetched when you think about the weight and seriousness that someone goes through before deciding that they need to be presenting a gender-affirming gender identity. So it just sort of--I hear it as offensive because it is sort of here--it sounds to me like someone is saying that a particular identity does not exist. I can also address the point about sex stereotyping. That is the very theory that the Supreme Court has used to cover both sexual orientation and gender identity. The Supreme Court has said how you present yourself, whether you present in a feminine or masculine way, all of those sorts of things are protected and you cannot discriminate based on those, and that is the theory that has led us to saying sexual orientation and gender identity are all part of sex discrimination, and that is not allowed to discriminate on any of those characteristics. Chairman Nadler. Thank you. In her written testimony, Ms. Beck lists a number of potential scenarios that could arise if Congress were to include protections against gender identity-based discrimination in the Equality Act, including ``men will dominate women's sports, and girls will stay home from school when they have their periods to avoid harassment by boys in mixed-sex toilets.'' What is your response? Ms. Chandy. There is no research to support the claim that allowing trans athletes to play on teams that fit their gender identity will create a competitive imbalance. Trans children display the same variation in size, strength, and athletic ability as other youth. And there are no reported instances of a boy pretending to be transgender or presenting as a girl to fraudulently join a sports team. There is just no example of this happening. And for this to be raised as the issue today, we are an organization that cares about women in sports. We can talk about women in sports: unequal pay; how women coaches are treated; resources given to women in sports. We can spend a lot of time talking about women in sports. The ``problem'' of transgender inclusion in sports is not the issue that is being raised. Chairman Nadler. Thank you. I have one more question on the same topic. Professor Coleman testifies that female athletes ``know that segregation on the basis of sex, or at least of sex linked to traits, is necessary to achieve equality in this space.'' And he also testifies--I am sorry, Professor Coleman. She testifies that because those born male are exposed to much higher levels of testosterone, they enjoy physical advantages in athletic performance, and not recognizing this difference will hinder women's opportunities in sports. Your response to those two---- Ms. Chandy. I would just say that half of the country, we have state and local laws that protect on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity. And as the professor described, this has been going on in half of the country, and it is not as if sports has been sort of--women's sports has been overcome with transgender athletes winning every race. Even in the example that was given in Connecticut, which is the only one I am hearing, those people went on to the Nationals, and one did not participate, and one came in like 30th or 31st. So this idea that transgender inclusion is going to mean that transgender individuals are going to win in all of the sports is simply not true. We have heard no data to say that that is true, and these are just fears and myths and stereotypes, which is not a way that we can make law. Chairman Nadler. And finally, given that many courts have interpreted Title 7 and other civil rights statutes to already prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, why do we need to amend existing statutes to provide such protection? Ms. Chandy. Okay. So, right now, the circuit courts are sort of deciding, and there has been a growing consensus among Federal courts that the existing prohibition on sex discrimination also prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. But that depends on the court that is looking at it. There are also some circuits that have not gone in that way. So it is not fair that whether or not you have rights, not to be discriminated against based on sexual orientation or gender identity cannot depend on the state you live in, the location, or the circuit. That is not a fair way to have civil rights protections. These protections need to be firmly established in the legislation so that all genders need to follow it, all circuits need to follow it, and that everyone in the country can have this protection. Chairman Nadler. Thank you. I take it you mean should not, not cannot. My time has expired. The gentleman from Georgia, the Ranking Member, Mr. Collins, is recognized. Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. H.R. 5 will require under Federal law that all entities receiving Federal financial assistance, including K-12 schools, colleges, hospitals, recognize whatever self-professed gender identity an adolescent might profess. In the audience today are several parents who are representing the Kelsey Coalition. These are parents of transgender-identifying children who have been harmed by gender identity medical practices. Their stories are not reported in the press. They have been denied meetings with their representatives, and they are here today to make sure that this committee will seriously consider the disastrous impact of including gender identity in the Equality Act, under which doctors will be required to administer testosterone to young girls on demand, they will be required to block the--of young boys based on the feelings of gender confusion, and this is already happening, including gender identity in the Federal law will turn these unsound medical practices into Federal mandate. The opposition to this bill is both deep and wide in both Republican and Democrat men and women, mothers and fathers from all sides of the political spectrum, and no side at all. I just received a letter this morning from a Georgia mom deeply concerned with what is happening with girls sports and its effect on daughters and girls everywhere, and I would like to ask that to be submitted for the record. Chairman Nadler. Without objection. Mr. Collins. But opposition to this bill also consists of many people who are scared to express their views, and so we on our side are going to use some of our question time to give voice to those who might otherwise remain voiceless in the face of the injustice that will be imposed by this legislation. To that end, I will begin my questioning by reading parts of the peer-reviewed study by Dr. Lisa Littman entitled, ``Parents Reports of Adolescents and Young Adults Perceived to Show Signs of Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria,'' which shows how the transgender ideology is propagated in part by social media and aimed at vulnerable children. H.R. 5, if enacted, would codify an Internet phenomenon into Federal law. H.R. 5 would make it illegal for well-meaning parents and doctors to protect children from rash judgments that are part of childhood, even more so in the era of smart phones and social media obsession. The following is from Dr. Lisa Littman's article. Dr. Littman found that none of the AYAs, adolescents and young adults, described in the study would have met diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in childhood. In fact, the vast majority, 80.4 percent, had zero indicators from the DSM-V distinct diagnostic criteria for childhood gender dysphoria, with 12.2 percent possessing one indicator, 3.5 with two indicators, and 2.4 with three indicators. Adolescents and young adults had received online advice, including that if their parents were reluctant to take them for hormones, that they should use the suicide narrative, telling the parents that there is a high rate of suicide of transgender teens to convince them, 20.7 percent, and that it is acceptable to lie or withhold information about one's medical or psychological history from doctors or therapists in order to get hormones and get hormones faster, 17.5 percent. There is a lot of concern, as I stated in my opening statement. There is love and compassion for all folks who are going through different stages, but this bill has real consequences and real concerns. Professor Coleman, as a member of Congress I am used to being discussed in the third person about what I have said and not said, and my Chairman, we talk about each other a lot in different ways than what we have said, but your testimony has actually been brought up, and I would like for you to be able to respond to what was said earlier, discussing the dysphoria aspect and some of these differences that we have seen that is not isolated in this, and I would like for you to comment on that. Ms. Coleman. Thank you. So, I understand that sport is really important in consideration of this bill, but it covers things more broadly, and I want to make clear again that my position is narrow and concerns only sport, and you can do with that what you would like. A couple of responses. Again, Professor Yoshino mentioned that transgender girls and women have not yet broadly displaced girls and women in sport. That is absolutely right, but also this is just the beginning of a period of time in various states where trans kids are coming out as trans and are being welcomed and included for their authentic selves. So the question is what will happen if this trend continues and identification into girls' and women's sport comes to be based on gender identity rather than biology, or in addition to biology on an equal basis. In the Olympic movement we have seen the effects of this issue in the last period where the Court of Arbitration for Sport lifted the requirements of testosterone reduction for intersex and trans women. For example, the Olympic podium in the women's 800 meters likely was comprised entirely of biological males in the last Olympic championships, and that is--we are talking three people out of hundreds of girls and women. I will just add, with respect to the national championships in indoor track recently, the high school and college national championships, only one of the two girls from Connecticut was able to compete, and the girl who was able to compete had satisfied the National Scholastic Athletic Foundation policy of dropping her T levels for over a year to within the women's range, the girls and women's range. Mr. Collins. Well, thank you. And again, I appreciate everyone who has come here today. We may disagree on certain things, but also not everything is simply solved by nature or number, and these are questions that need to be addressed and need to be talked about. But I think the concerns, most that I relate here, is something that we need to discuss, and I appreciate the Chairman having it, and we will continue on. With that, I yield back. Chairman Nadler. I thank the gentleman. The gentle lady from California, Ms. Lofgren. Ms. Lofgren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like so many other Americans, LGBTQ have had their rights eroded since the Administration took power, from removing LGBTQ issues from Federal data collection surveys, to the ban on transgender individuals who are serving in the military, just to name a few. The first few years of the presidency had our country taking several steps backwards. We have taken this step with the Equality Act to stop stepping backwards but to step forward, and I am a proud original co-sponsor of this bill. As a consequence, everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation, should be afforded the same protections provided under the Civil Rights Act and other civil rights bills, and the Equality Act does ensure that that is the case. I have listened to the testimony, and all of you said interesting things, and I appreciate that you were here. But, Reverend Wiley, I was so moved listening to your testimony and thinking back to your days in the segregated south. We have many challenges remaining, but we have made some progress. We should celebrate the successes in addition to bemoaning the challenges that remain. But I am particularly struck that you are here as a man of faith, and many opponents--I am not suggesting here on the dais today but in our country--of LGBTQ equality claim that somehow that equality is at odds with religious freedom and with people of faith, and yet here you are, a faith leader testifying in support of this bill. Why, as one who has dedicated himself to religious life your entire life, do you support LGBTQ equality? How do you reconcile your faith, your belief, with those who oppose it for religious reasons? Rev. Wiley. Thank you for the question. I grew up as the son of a Baptist minister. My uncles, a couple of uncles were ministers. I have an aunt who is a minister, cousins, my brother. So I have been surrounded by the Church all my life, and I am thankful that my parents not only taught me the Bible, but they also lived what they believed to be the principal concept of the Bible that included justice, equality, liberty, compassion, and those are the kinds of things that were instilled in me. And also, the need to stand up for what we believe is right. My father assisted Dr. King on many occasions in the civil rights movement. So I grew up believing that it was part of my responsibility as a minister not just to stand in the pulpit and preach on Sunday mornings, but also to be active in the community and in the nation and the world in an active way to challenge any kind of issue that would bring any kind of injustice to people. I also was taught to respect and appreciate all of God's creation, that God was a god of love and a god of forgiveness and a god of saying that everybody is welcome into God's house. So I am sometimes amazed at how the Church is not more active in struggles like this. Martin Luther King, Jr., when he was sitting in the Birmingham jail and wrote the letter from that jail, he was concerned that some of the ministers in that town were saying he was going too fast, he needed to wait, he needed to slow down and be more gradual. But he says that he could not wait because justice delayed is justice denied. So that is where I come from. And not only was I involved in the struggle for racial justice but as I studied with theologians, they helped me to understand that none of us are free until all of us are free. Ms. Lofgren. Thank you very much, Reverend. My time is expired, but your words are inspiring to us all. Thank you very much. Rev. Wiley. Thank you. Chairman Nadler. Thank you. I now recognize the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Chabot. Mr. Chabot. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to all the witnesses for providing insight for members on both sides of the aisle here, whether you are for or against H.R. 5. As well as being a member of this committee, I happen to be the ranking member of the House Small Business Committee, which is the lead Republican on that committee. In the last two congresses I was chairman of that committee, and in that capacity we get to hear from small businesses all over the country about how laws that we pass here impact them on a daily basis, and I would note that America's small businesses provide about 70 percent of the new jobs created in America nowadays. With respect to H.R. 5, small business, particularly small business owners who have common religious beliefs, many of whom are women, have shared their concerns about H.R. 5 with me and other members. For example, and we have already seen this in athletics, where physical men now in some cases have to compete with women, we heard testimony on both sides of that, and it does not seem to be fair to a lot of people that men who identify as women are competing with women. Similarly, it does not seem fair for men who identify as a woman to be able to take advantage of certain government contracts, because doing so allows them to utilize the women-owned small business Federal contracting program, for example, which is designed to provide greater access to Federal contracting opportunities for women-owned small businesses. One of the requirements to be certified in that particular program is to be 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more women. This program gives contracting officers a statutory goal of providing at least 75 percent of Federal contracting dollars to women-owned firms, and adopting H.R. 5 could mean that this program and others like it, designed to level the playing field for women in business, could be jeopardized. So that is certainly, I think, something to be considered. It could also mean that small business owners would have to provide the cost of providing health care if one of their employees wanted to undergo elective procedures that were covered under H.R. 5, the bill that we are considering today. This could be very costly for small business owners who are already facing rising health care costs under the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, whichever terminology one prefers. Forcing them to provide pharmaceutical and other types of health care for these sorts of procedures because someone identified as a member of the opposite sex could, no doubt, exacerbate the already high cost to small business. So overall, while H.R. 5 says it is intended to provide equality for all, it in many people's views does anything but and goes beyond creating a level playing field to once again making it easier for men who identify as women to take advantage of programs that are actually designed to do that. So that is something to be considered. And then finally, there is a report from Dr. Littman, a study that I think a number of us had access to. This is a different topic, but there are online instructions about lying to parents and physicians under this, and these are a couple of things that it said, and these are quotes from some of these young people. ``Find out what they want to hear if they are going to give you T,'' which apparently stands for testosterone, ``and then tell them just that. It is about getting treatment, not about being true to those around you. It is not their business, and a lot of time doctors will screw stuff up for you.'' Another one said, ``Get a story ready in your head and, as suggested, keep the lie to a minimum, and only for stuff that can't be verified, like how you were feeling but was too afraid to tell anyone, including your family.'' From another one, ``I would also look up the DSM,'' which is Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, by the way, ``for the diagnostic criteria for transgender and make sure your story fits it, assuming your psych follows it.'' Another correspondent offered, ``He is rewriting his personal history to suit his new narrative.'' And another respondent said, ``Our son has completely made up his childhood to include only girlfriends and dressing up in girls'' clothes and playing with dolls, etc. This is not the same childhood we have seen as parents.'' And then finally another parent said, ``I overheard my son boasting on the phone to his older brother that the doc swallowed everything I said hook, line and sinker, easiest thing I ever did.'' And I yield back. Chairman Nadler. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Johnson, is recognized. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, and thank you all for being here today. Super-protections should ensure that no one can be discriminated against in their housing, their employment, and their public accommodations. Would you agree with that, Professor Coleman? Ms. Coleman. Yes, sir, I do. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. And do you agree with that, Ms. Beck. Ms. Beck. Yes. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. And so you both seem to be more in line with discriminating in the area of athletics, in the area of women's athletics. Is that correct, Dr. Coleman, Professor Coleman? Ms. Coleman. That is what I am here to testify about. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. And Ms. Beck, you also? Ms. Beck. I believe sex is a basis upon which sports should be segregated. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Now, is it true that there are some women who have high levels of testosterone, and then some with lower levels of testosterone? Ms. Coleman. So, if I can, I can point you to---- Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Well, I mean, I am just asking as-- some women, traditional women, if you will---- Ms. Coleman. Biological females' T levels do not overlap with biological males' T levels. There is quite a gap, no overlap, between the two ranges. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. So you are in favor of kind of discriminating in the field of athletics based on testosterone levels. Ms. Coleman. We have always done that. Sports has always done that. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. All right. Now---- Ms. Coleman. That is the reason women's sport exists, is because of testosterone levels. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Ms. Chandy, what is your position on that, on that distinction insofar as it would create an ability to legally discriminate against someone? Ms. Chandy. The Equality Act would ensure that LGBTQ students, including women and girls who are LGBTQ, have the same opportunity to participate as their peers. We have heard about the benefits of sports, particularly for students who may be experiencing self-esteem or other concerns. It can be incredibly important. And so the key for most of the people playing in sports is for inclusion and participation at those levels, and state schools and athletic associations across the country have found for many years that equal participation for LGBTQ students, including ones who are transgender, does not harm women and girls' sports in any way. I also want to say that under similar state laws, schools and athletic associations have developed approaches that place primary focus on ensuring equal opportunity for participation for transgender athletes while taking account of the different context for ages and levels of competition. And so there are rules that govern these areas where experts can figure out how to allow transgender students to participate equally and without facing discrimination. So these sort of discussions and rules are already in place in half of our country, and I was so relieved to hear Professor Coleman say this is actually not a problem now. This is a hypothetical problem. And meanwhile people are being excluded, and we want people to not have a place on the team for some hypothetical problem that we cannot even--we have no evidence of it. So we cannot create law based on that. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. Professor Yoshino, has this issue of testosterone levels and sports been an issue that you have formed an opinion about? Mr. Yoshino. I do have an opinion. Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Turn on your microphone. Mr. Yoshino. I defer it to Ms. Chandy, who has deeper expertise on this issue than I, but I do have an opinion based on the mere empirical evidence that has been adduced. We opened with Ranking Member Collins offering up the example of the two individuals in Connecticut who placed first and second in a particular athletic meet. Ms. Chandy responded by saying they went on to nationals. One did not participate, the other placed 30th. Then I understood Ranking Member Collins to follow up on that and to say to Professor Coleman I understand that this is not a single incident and this is actually a much broader phenomenon, and I heard Professor Coleman agree with my testimony to say that this is not a broad phenomenon, that these are isolated incidents, but that in the future we might expect more. And my only response to that is again the federalism point, which is that we have had decades of experience since the 1970s of women participating, trans women participating in women's leagues, and they have not dominated. It just strains credulity to think that an individual who is undergoing such a deeply personal transformation as to transition away from the gender assigned to them at birth would do so opportunistically simply because they wanted a gold medal in some track meet. This is not what gender identity is about, and this is not what the AMA or the American Psychological Association or the American Psychiatric Association say that it is about. This is a civil rights issue. This is not about individuals opportunistically trying to take advantage of particular entitlements or benefits that are accorded to women, whether that be in sports, whether that be in small business. It is a deeply, deeply personal issue of identity formation that occurs, as many physicians say, at a very early level. And one thing that I really appreciate both sides of the aisle being concerned about is our youth and our children, and I am glad to hear that even opponents of this bill articulate deep compassion for the children who are affected by gender identity disorder. I will point out that in the name of that compassion, I think it is useful to point out that the suicide rate among individuals who are transgender is 40 percent. Forty percent of individuals had attempted suicide in their lifetime, which is nearly nine times the attempted suicide rate in the overall population. Chairman Nadler. The gentleman's time has expired. Thank you. Mr. Cicilline. Mr. Chairman, may I make a unanimous consent request? Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent, in light of this line of questioning, that this statement of women's rights and gender justice organizations in support of full and equal access to participation in athletics for transgender people be made a part of the record. It is signed by a number of organizations, including the American Association of University Women, Legal Voice, National Women's Law Center, the National Women's Political Caucus, Women Leaders in College Sports, the Women's Sports Foundation, and many, many others. I ask that it be made a part of the record. Chairman Nadler. Without objection, the document will be made a part of the record. [The information follows:] MR. CICILLINE FOR THE OFFICIAL RECORD ======================================================================= [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Chairman Nadler. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gohmert, is recognized. Mr. Gohmert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Coleman, you had a response to the last answer? Ms. Coleman. Yes, please. So, trans women and trans girls are participating in sport, and most of them--this is just a factual point--most of them have dropped their T levels. In fact, part of transitioning, as I think everyone knows here--I do a lot of work with trans kids, including in the medicine area, and one of the things that trans girls would like to do is to drop their T levels into the female range as part of becoming their authentic selves. And when they do this and they compete, it is not at all a problem. So just to be clear, at least my position is not that trans kids should be excluded from sport. It is simply that inclusion based on biology or biological trait, sex-linked traits makes sense because otherwise, in fact--and this is not a hypothetical. In fact, it will be the end of girls' and women's-only sport if we make simply gender identity the basis for eligibility for---- Mr. Gohmert. Right. You will have men's sports and you will have co-ed sports. You were one of two girls to get a track scholarship to Villanova in 1978, thanks to Title 9. And the point has been made--and I can see your facial expression, Professor Coleman-- about the comment that there is no evidence of a problem with men competing. But there is no question that problem will continue to arise, and nothing more dramatic than this diagram you have, each one of these points representing an athlete, and the three red dots that are lost in the middle representing three Olympic winners in the 400 meters, and yet when they are compared with just the performances in the single year of 2017 of men, as you say, it shows that even at the women's best, the women would lose to literally thousands of boys and men, including to thousands who would be considered second tier in the men's category. I think that we consider laws to say something is equal, like testosterone, when the testimony has already indicated it is clear in the medical literature it does make a difference. As you say in your testimony--I thought it was pretty clear-- ``Scientists agree that males and females are materially different with respect to the main physical attributes they contribute to athletic performance.'' It is true, but to see that graph you have, that demonstration, anybody here that seriously thinks that there are men who would not like to have Professor Coleman's scholarship and could get it, apparently there are thousands that could have beat you if there are guys that say, look, I feel like I am a woman--and let's be fair here, too. If we are going to say, as this law does, that the Olympic Committee and every other sport is going to have to eliminate the testosterone level requirement, that is going to have to go, because the presence of that rule makes it very clear that there is not equality in sports, and that is why that rule was put in place, because "
