        "text": "In the early 1960s, the supercharged gas coupes were a drag racing attraction as popular as funny cars are today. Anyone who ever saw and heard one of the little prewar coupes with the blower scoop sticking through the hood will never forget them. Arguably, the most famous of them all was the '41 Willys coupe campaign by the team of Fred Stone, Tim Woods, and Doug \"Cookie\" Cook. Tim Woods, a successful Los Angeles building contractor, raced a series of Oldsmobiles from the infancy of organized drag racing at Santa Ana. In 1960, when the trend to smaller and lighter cars began, Tim built his coupe in partnership with Fred Stone, another LA businessman with whom he often worked. When their driver, KS Pittman, chose to develop his time to his own Willys, Woods recruited Jesse Duglas Cook who had been driving his own gasser's. One of the most famous teams in drag racing history was formed in time for the 1961 US Nationals. Tim was the principal owner and acted as manager (although his son Leonard's name appeared on the car), and his Willys was the first to break into the ten and nine second brackets, and the first over 150 mph. The tough competition in the class led to a series of (sometimes) humorous ads in the trade papers which became known as the \"Gasser Wars\". Stone placed the ads and acted as publicity agent for the team. The ads were great promotional tools and led to the match races from coast-to-coast until funny cars began to steal the limelight. The car was so well promoted that most people were surprised to find that Stone and Woods were one of the few black teens in drag racing. To them it wasn't an issue; they were more interested in racing and winning. In 1967 the team built a Mustang funny car which Doug crashed at Alton, Illinois in September, ending his driving career. Funny cars continued to be raced under the Stone, Woods and Cook name until 1972. Fred Stone was in the import export business when he died in England in 1982. Tim Woods was retired when he died in October 1995. Doug Cook Would go on to build engines and wrench on son Mike's near 300 MPH Bonneville Thunderbird.\n\nThe headline of the Amarillo times in 1940 read, \"Wolflin In Arms Over Hot Rods\". The story concerned rampant street racing emanating from the drive-in on Wolflin Avenue. That was Dale Ham's introduction to the activity which would be his life's work for nearly three decades. Dale was part of America's post war love affair with the automobile and he built a series of hot rods, each a little nicer and faster than the last. He joined the Barons of Amarillo along with fellow drag racing pioneers such as Jack Moss. He was there in June 1954 when the NHRA Drag Safari put on a meet at Caddo Mills. When the first NHRA Nationals were held at Great Bend Kansas, in 1955, Ham was there. It was his chance to see all the heroes from California who he had only read about in Hot Rod Magazine. He won the C Street Roadster class and set a national record at a staggering speed of 94.24 mph. It's a tossup whether Ham was more thrilled by his own performance or the fact that Mickey Thompson cut in front of him in the tech line. In the early days, dedication was the important factor and Ham was one of those most dedicated to making the dream of organized drag racing a reality. He wanted to be a part of so badly created a job for himself at Custom Car Supply in Amarillo which allowed him to be paid part-time at NHRA as a Regional Advisor. When the divisional system was created by NHRA in 1960, Ham was named to lead the South-Central Division. Assisted by his lovely wife, Glynanna, who served as Trophy Queen at the the 1959 Nationals, he used his dedication and creativity to organize his division and occasionally defended its honor with an iron fist. When the national events schedule began to grow, Ham, one of the best liked officials in drag racing, was given the task of pit control, a job he handled with his normal dedication and enthusiasm. Ham retired from NHRA in 1987, he excelled in the second career as a Western artist. NHRA's South Central division was nicknamed \"Land of the Good Guys\", and Dale Ham will always be Good Guy #1.\n\nIt could be said that Eddie Hill has had drag three racing careers. The first began in 1956 when he mounted a stock Oldsmobile engine on a Model T frame to compete in the Open Gas class at a little drag strip, in East Texas, reaching 106 mph. In 1957, he built his innovative Pontiac gas dragster, which he modestly called \"the hottest unblown gasser on earth\"! With a blower, the car ran a best of 8.84 ET and won Top Gas honors at the 1959 AHRA Nationals. Eddie then built an awesome twin Pontiac for slick dragster that literally melted holes in the starting line at the 1961 Indy Nationals. A series of fuel dragsters followed and a severe engine fire in 1966 ended career number one. Hill would race motorcycles through 1974, when he attended his first drag boat race; 30 days later he owned a race boat. He became the most famous drag boat racer in the country, winning several season championships. On September 5, 1982, Hill turned 229 mph, placing him in the Guinness Book of World Records as the driver of the fastest propeller driven boat. In October 1984, a 217 mph crash seriously injured Hill and brought career number two to a close. The next spring, Eddie and his wife Ercie, bought a used dragster and installed their salvaged boat engine and went back to pavement. By the 1986 Gatornationals, the last boat motor was used up, and Hill was ready to quit. Ercie took a burned piston to Gene Snow and explain their plight. Snow sold them and engine and offered a baseline tune-up. At the next race, they beat Snow with his own used engine and were on their way. Eddie and Ercie struggled as privateers slowly working their way toward the front of the pack. On April 9, 1988, with a Super Shops sponsorship, they made their mark in drag racing history at the IHRA Texas Nationals when Eddie clocked a sizzling 4.990 ET. Proving the first under five second run was no fluke, Hill made more four second runs, than any other driver, that year with a best of 4.93 ET and a win at the NHRA Supernationals. It all came together in 1993 when the Pennzoil backed \"Nuclear Banana\" one a record-tying six national events. In 1993 at the age of 57 Eddie Hill became the oldest NHRA Top Fuel Champion history.\n\nAngelo Giampetroni is best known as the guy at Ford SVO who helped FMO keep its high profile with the racers and hot riders, but his history in the sport is long and varied. Angela’s first job was with Gratiot Auto Supply at the age of 12. While his duties at first were restricted to sweeping up and putting things in place, it wasn’t long before he was becoming more and more involved with the business side of Gratiot.\n\nAs soon as he could legally own a cart, Angelo purchased a 1932 Ford five window coupe with a 292 cubic inch flathead engine for power. This also became his first race car to complete with Grancor heads, Isky cam, and as many “goodies” as were available at the time. While the car was his daily transportation, it was also stout enough to clock over 120 mph at Motor City Dragway and Detroit Dragway. One of Angelo’s more famous race cars was a rear engine 1920 T Roadster powered by a 480 cubic inch Buick and affectionately known as “Li’l Billy”. Li’l Billy was one of the quickest and fastest cars at the time, turning 168+ MPH within an ET of 9.30 seconds.\n\nUsing the knowledge gained in his years at Gratiot Auto Supply, in 1969 Angelo founded Detroit Hi Performance and begin distributing performance parts on a nationwide basis. In 1970 the business became Gratiot Auto Mail Order and was soon shipping performance parts around the world. Gratiot Auto soon became one of the best known and recognized names in the hot rod world. Angela promoted the business through the weekly enthusiasts’ newspapers, in magazines such as Hot Rod Magazine, local newspapers, and was one of the first speed shops to incorporate the use of TV in its promotions. To add more zip to his TV promotions, Angelo brought Miss Hurst, Linda Vaughn, on board as one of Gratiot’s most visible spokesperson.\n\nIn the early days of drag racing, the team of Tony Waters and Jim Sughrue was known and feared by all who had to compete against them. Both men were charter members of the legendary Bakersfield Smokers, and both were known for their fast and sanitary race cars. Tony got his start on the local street racing scene with a brand-new 1949 Chevy into which he quickly installed a 302 GMC engine. As soon as the strips at Saugus and Fresno opened in 1950, Tony was right there with the Chevy. Before long Tony equipped the GMC engine with a Howard log manifold and five Stromberg carbs converted to use alcohol. Although he was consistently breaking the 100 MPH barrier, it wasn’t long before the need to go faster took over, and he went to work on a new car. This new vehicle was a 1925 T Roadster known as “The Giant Killer” that used the same GMC engine that was so successful in the 1949 Chevy. The roadster immediately broke the 120 MPH mark, which made it among the fastest cars on the dragstrip at the time.\n\nIn 1955, Tony decided to introduce a totally new and novel combination, a fuel-burning 292 DeSoto engine with a front mounted 4-71 GMC supercharger. The combination was not new to Tony, as he already become one of the earliest members of the 200 MPH club driving a 1932 Ford Highboy roadster at Bonneville with the same powerplant. Not long after Tony fielded this new combination, he and his friend Jim Sughrue teamed up to form one of the strongest racing teams in the country. With the two people sharing the load, the team also turn the car into a real showpiece. At the inaugural US Fuel and Gas Championship meet, Waters lasted through two days of eliminations only to lose in the final round to Art Chrisman’s dragster when he lost traction in a patch of water.\n\nIn 1964 the team went on a very successful nationwide tour, but by the end of the tour it was obvious the pair would have to retire the roadster and switch to a dragster if they were to remain competitive. A couple of changes took place at this time. The team made the switch to a dragster and John Edmonds was installed as the driver. The new combination debuted at a 1964 car top fuel show at Lions Dragstrip and quickly proved it was the right move by taking home the top eliminator trophy and money. Not long after this they showed up at Carlsbad Raceway and set a new world record of 226.12 MPH. After the 1967 season, the partners retired from the racing for many years. But as they say once bitten you never forget, and Tony returned to the wars, this time with and involvement in the nostalgia fuel dragster class. Tony also built a new Highboy roadster with the hopes it would break the 300 mile-per-hour marked at Bonneville.\n\nSelf-proclaimed “King of the Northwest”, Jerry Ruth has done his very best to live up to his title. Jerry was exposed to drag racing at the age of 14 when he attended his first race at the only track in the Seattle, Washington area at the time Arlington Raceway. By the age of 16 he was the proud owner of a straight eight engine powered 1939 Chrysler New Yorker that’s all more street racing than it did race track use. After a tour of duty with the US Marine Corps, Jerry found himself hanging out in Southern California, where he found work at a couple of Chevrolet dealerships during the week and on the weekends hung out at the local dragstrips.\n\nJerry’s first race car was a small block powered 1955 Chevy that he competed in C/Gas class with. Not content with the speed the 1955 ran, he soon began racing a 1940 Studebaker sedan in C/Altered class, turning in speeds of over 121 MPH. Missing his hometown, Ruth moved back to Seattle and worked his way through a succession of full-bodied cars in the C/Gas then the C/Gas Supercharged, always striving to go quicker and faster. His first time behind the wheel of a dragster came after he did some swapping with Jim Green of Green Elephant Racing fame and wound up with greens old B/Gas dragster. The first time down the track in a dragster was enough to convince Ruth he would never be happy driving anything other than a dragster. While Jerry got the dragster itself in the swap deal, he didn’t get a trailer, so he had to borrow one from his friend Harold Gunderson. The only problem was, Harold was using the trailer for his own car at the time, so Jerry had to haul Harold’s car to the track, unload it and go home for his car. After the race he had to reverse the entire procedure, which made race day very long for Jerry. Jerry was finally able to buy trailer of his own, making his life less complicated and race day shorter. By 1962 Jerry had graduated to A/Gas dragster and was turning speeds 150 MPH, and life was great, but he wanted to go even quicker and faster.\n\nBy the end of 1962 Jerry decided to build and injected fuel-burning small block Chevy for the dragster, which he did and probably blew up. He then put together a blown small block Chevy on fuel and just as quickly destroyed it. According to Jerry that was when he decided it was time to make the move to AA/Fuel dragster with a blown 354 Chrysler hemi, on fuel, for power this proved to be the right combination for Jerry, who soon was turning speeds of over 200 MPH and mid seven second ET’s. In 1964 he set track records from Sheldon Washington to Half Moon Bay in California and most of the racetracks in between and earned the title of Washington State Champion.\n\nAfter couple years with the 354 engine, Jerry switch to a 392 hemi, and from 1964 to 1969 he literally dominated AA/Fuel dragster class in NHRA’s Division Six, winning the division title five of six years and setting top speed records in 1966 and 1967. There was no doubt that during this period Jerry Ruth was the darling of the strip owners and operators in the Northwest territory. The more Jerry’s popularity grew and the more drag racing itself was promoted in the area, the more top fuel cars were built and raced in the area. Fortunately for him, Jerry’s winning streak was far from over, and in 1970. 1971, 1972, and 1973 he again won the divisional championships. By the early 70s Ruth had added a fuel funny car to his operation and soon had it in championship form. In 1971 Jerry became the first person to ever win a divisional championship in both top fuel and funny car classes. In 1973 he took home the Top Fuel World Championship trophy and joined the Crager Five Second Club with a 5.95 ET. Jerry’s list of victories and records continued to grow. In 1980 he won the AHRA World Finals. In 1981 he won the Mile-High Nationals in Denver, and in 1982 he won the IHRA Springnationals in Bristol.\n\nJerry is retired from drag racing but is still involved in cars. He built several street rods for his own use and continues to offer advice to anyone who is willing to listen. Jerry Ruth was truly king of the Northwest and still is today.\n\nOne of the pioneer showmen of drag racing was Bill “Maverick” Golden and his Little Red Wagon wheel standing truck. However, before the “wagon”, Bill was one of the early pioneers in the super stock wars. Competing in a Chrysler sponsored S/S Dodge, Bill soon became a star in the 60s, racking up hundreds of wins and track records with an enviable 95% when record. It was also during the super stock years that Bill learned the value of showmanship as well as performance. Without showmanship especially in the stock classes, it was nearly impossible to get exposure in the print media.\n\nBill started life in the same way he has lived it; very uniquely. Born Billy Lawrence Golden to a fur trapper father and a Cherokee mother in the wilderness of the Wabash River bottoms of southern Illinois, he competed in and won his first race on his horse “Thunder” at the local county fair. Even with only one horsepower, Bill was hooked on the speed it provided. In 1953 Bill joined the US Marine Corps to see the world and do his duty for his country. While the Marine Corps exposed him to many foreign countries, it was during his tour in California that he decided this was the place to stay. The climate was great and the life was good, but above all there was an abundance of drag strips in the area.\n\nAfter settling into the California lifestyle, Bill soon started showing up at the various strike strips within the local area. Before long he had earned the reputation of being a winner, and under the guidance of Gordon and Jerry Williams he soon became almost unbeatable. Up until sometime in 1968 he was simply known as Bill Golden, but one Sunday afternoon at Santa Ana dragstrip, CJ “Pappy” Hart called for Bill to “get that Maverick Dodge up here and let’s finish this race!” The name stuck, and from that time forward he was known to all as “the Maverick”.\n\nMavericks list of accomplishments during the 60s is still one of the most impressive ones in the history of the sport. In 1962 his super stock Dodge held both ends of the national records, and in 1964 his Dodge held both ends of the A-Modified production record and racked up a win record of 35 out of 36 races. In 1965, Car & Driver Magazine named him the “Golden Boy of Drag Racing” and placed the 1964 Dodge at number one. In 1969, Super Stock Magazine named Mavericks 1963 Dodge one of the top 10 stock cars of all time. With this record behind him, in 1995 Bill was in ducted into the Super Stock Magazine Hall of Fame. In 1964, Dodge Director of PR, Frank Wiley, came up with the idea of building a rear engine, hemi powered, A-Factory experimental wheel standing Dodge compact pickup for a Dodge truck commercial. Maverick was tapped to drive it, and shortly thereafter the Little Red Wagon began appearing at the local drag strips. While there has been a lot of publicity and notoriety for the “wagon”, it hasn’t come without its problems. The initial truck put Maverick in the hospital for a week from too many high wheelstands and coming down too hard. From 1964 through 1975, Maverick crashed seven times, destroying three trucks. The 1975 crash in Québec City, Canada almost cost him his life after he flipped nine times end over end and rolled another five times before coming to a stop. When wagon number four was built, Maverick asked his good friend Eddie Campbell who was also a priest to bless it and asked God to watch over him and his wheelie truck. Bill has been responsible for many of the safety measures incorporated into the wheel standing vehicles of today including the guidance system that allows the drivers to steer the vehicle with the front wheels in the air. Bill is also credited with coining the term “wheelie”. Bill was also one of the first wheelie drivers to start “racing” side-by-side with another wheel stander.\n\nIn January 1975 the man who gave Bill his Maverick nickname, Pappy Hart, was able to give him another giant boost by booking the Little Red Wagon at his season opening feature attraction. In 1977 Bill set a wheelie length record of 4230 feet which still stands today. Over the years the man known as Maverick has received countless awards such as the Car Craft Magazine All-Star Racing Team, Car of the Year award from HRA, King of the Wheel Stands, to name only a few. But the thing that stands out above all the others is that when anyone thinks or talks of wheel standing vehicles, the first name that comes to mind is Bill “Maverick” Golden and his Little Red Wagons.\n\nDick LaHaie was another drag racer who got an early start in the sport. In 1955 at the age of 13, Dick landed a job that allowed him to start saving for his dream. Just three years later Dick’s dream came true when he became the proud owner of his first car, a 1948 Mercury coupe. The car equipped with a standard flathead engine, but within three months it was replaced with an Old’s V8.\n\nDick wasn’t a person who had someone else doing his work for him, either. He built his own A-frames and did his own wiring and other modifications to make the car quicker and faster. At age 16, Dick was well on his way to learning how to make his cars more competitive and by doing his own work at a more affordable cost. After about a year, the Mercury was replaced with a 1950 Ford coupe that he was soon racing on the street. Wanting to go quicker and faster, he replaced the engine in the 1950 with a GrandCor 296 cubic inch flathead. Next came a 1953 Ford coupe into which he dropped a 270 HP Corvette engine and a four-speed gearbox. The car was very quick and fast and is the vehicle that took him from street racing to organize drag racing. In 1959, Central Michigan Dragway opened its doors, and in his first effort, the 17-year-old notched his first win in E/Gas class at a speed of 110 MPH and an ET of 14.35 seconds.\n\nIn 1960 Dick bought a 1955 Olds and promptly set a new national record in I/SA. Dick was what is considered by anyone’s standards a very active racer. He raced the Olds at Detroit Dragway on Tuesday, and Friday nights, US 131 on Saturdays, and on Sundays at Anondaga Dragway. During one stretch, Dick one at those tracks 14 weeks straight. His next ride was an Olds-powered 1951 Henry J that he competed with in 1961 in 1962. At about this time, LaHaie hooked up with two racers who would significantly change his life, Noah Canfield and Charlie Johnson. Canfield and Johnson campaigned the Glass Chariot AA/Modified fuel roadster throughout the Midwest, and when Johnson couldn’t be at the races, LaHaie filled in as the driver. When the Canfield and Johnson team moved up to top fuel in 1964, Dick was well aware of the car’s popularity, so he took over the operation on his own and had his first full time blown and injected nitro powered ride. It was with this car that LaHaie made his first bid for national recognition when he challenged Gabby Bleeker and his roadster for a spot on the Drag News Junior Eliminator list. Bleeker failed show for the race, so Dick owned the spot. Next, he challenged the holder of the number one spot, the Heidelberg team. This ended with mixed emotions for Dick; he easily beat them on the first round but broke the engine and was unable to make the other two required rounds. However later that same year Dick took the number one spot away from them and retain the title until the class was discontinued a year later.\n\nIn 1966 Dick again join forces with Canfield and Johnson, this time with a newly built top fuel dragster. The group had an outstanding season, winning 11 weeks in a row at different tracks, but at the end of the season Johnson elected to retire, leaving LaHaie on his own again. One of Dick’s first moves was to join the UDRA so he would be able to compete on the Midwest circuit against the best names in the sport. The move was a good one for Dick as he won circuit titles in 1970, 1973, in 1976. During this period Dick himself built all of the cars he raceed, starting with front motor dragsters, and in 1971 building his first rear engine car. In fact, Dick built all of his own cars up to and including his 1984 car. One of the reasons Dick built his own cars was simple matter of economics; he was a racer with a very small budget, and this was another way to make it go farther, plus his designs were very competitive.\n\nDrag racing has not always been kind to Dick. In 1975 while debuting a new car at the Gatornationals in Gainesville Florida the throttle stuck open, and despite all his efforts to stop the car safely, he wound up crashing into some trees. Dick’s left hand torn off his right arm broken in two places but fortune did smile on him in the form of a group of medically trained Vietnam veterans who were in Gainesville teaching limb replacement, and they were able to surgically reattach his hand. Dick hired John Thomas to drive for him while he recovered, but he was back in the car at US 13 Dragstrip just a week before the US Nationals in Indy. On his third qualifying run at Indy, a combination of a front wing that was built wrong and the front wheels hitting the wheel bearings caused the car to crash just past finish line. This time Dick lost a toe and broke his right arm again. Just a month later, Dick decided he wanted to continue racing, and Marv Rifchin of M&H Tires cut him a check for the new car. By April 1976, the new car was completed, and Dick was again competing.\n\nIn 1980 at the Summernationals, Dick won his first national event by beating Jeb Allen in the final round, and the following year he was the NHRA Eastern Region Top Fuel Champion. In 1982 three significant things happened: he debuted a new car at the Winternationals and won, daughter Kim debuted as his crew chief at the US Nationals, and he sold his business to become a full-time professional racer.\n\nDick’s performance never let up. In 1985 he won the Gatornationals, and in 1986 he reached six finals, winning two of them. In 1987 Dick landed a sponsorship with Miller Brewing Company and teamed up with Larry Minor to win his first Winston top fuel crown, winning a total five national events along the way. In 1991 Dick retired from driving, and while he never believed he could become a crew chief, in 1993 Connie Kalitta changed that thought when he hired Dick to wrench son Scott’s car. The team became nearly unstoppable, finishing second to Eddie Hill for the Winston crown in 1993 and winning it in 1994 in 1995. Since then Dick has been instrumental in furthering the careers of Doug Kalitta, and Larry Dixon. 2002 Dick LaHaye won the Winston top fuel crown for the fourth time as either a driver-crew chief.\n\nBack when they were a bit lighter and younger, Jimmy King and Don Marshall were friends, even fellow car club members with five other guys (kids) in the King Pins and the Southern New England Timing Association during the mid-50s. Jimmy remembers having a cool 1941 Ford and being too young to drive it, so older buddy Don offered to handle the chore. Wanting a gearhead playground, they were instrumental in opening the Navy base in Charleston, Rhode Island to monthly drag racing, through SNETA. Other groups at Sanford, Maine and at Orange, Massachusetts meant that Jimmy and Don could drag race every Sunday somewhere in New England by 1957.\n\nJimmy landed a job at a Ford dealership name Tasca, working near Bill Lawton and John Healy. He was hitting the strips with his nailhead Buick powered 1946 Chevy. The car wasn’t fast enough so Jimmy found a Scotty Finn K88 chassis and stuck a gas burning small block Chevy in it, while Don decided to try again with two less wheels and six fewer cylinders. He went motorcycle racing with the gas burning Harley Davidson, then stepped up to a unique blown, reverse rotation Triumph. A local Harley Davidson dealer notice Don success and set him up with a deal on a new 1963 Harley. Don went on to set land speed records at Bonneville in the gas classes, hitting 136 and 142 MPH with no fairings. Then went to the quarter-mile with a load of nitro and clicked 150 MPH. Meanwhile, Jimmy’s desire to go faster got him into a Haulin chassis with a 392. Don, and other local friends, were usually around pitching in with parts and assistance. However even in the mid-60s, it was tough to field a competitive top fuel car by yourself, let alone find enough events for a nitro bike. That’s when the two longtime friends got together, and the King and Marshall team became official. It wasn’t long until they decided to make a leap. They sold most of their “toys”, purchased a new Don Long/Tom Hanna car in late 1967, and planned on some traveling.\n\nThe team fielded competitive top fuelers and funny cars until the mid-70s, followed by a few special appearances until 1980. Jimmy return to his garage in Rhode Island, while Don spent the winters in Florida and summers in Rhode Island. Jimmy and Don remained good friends and they often got together usually at major racing events and other drag race related occasions. King and Marshall was perhaps the most prolific and successful drag racing team ever from the New England area; like most fuel teams in their era, they campaigned mostly out of their own pockets because they were doing it for the fun and the challenge. Yet they were quick to acknowledge the assistance from New England Speed Equipment, the New England Plymouth Dealers Association, and Marvin Rifchin of M&H Tire. Like most easterners, they didn’t receive a lot of national publicity for the success but they generated huge fan appeal wherever they raced, and a good deal of local and regional media attention. Jimmy King was voted Most Popular Driver by the fans at the three New England tracks for four consecutive years.\n\n“Diamond” Jim Kelly was one of the sport’s first full-time photographers. Jim got his first taste of drag racing in 1958 as a spectator at Lions Dragstrip after his good friend Don Gregory talked Jim into going with him to see what it was all about. Shortly after that, Don convinced Jim to become a competitor with his Austin Healey at Lions, where he promptly won his class the first time out. After that, he was hooked on drag racing forever, but a couple years after his first when, his car was destroyed by a drunk driver. Still wanting to be involved in the sport, Kelly started taking photos at the race tracks. Early in his career as a photographer, Jim had the good fortune to become friends with Al Johns, the track photographer for Lions. AI passed along some tips on what to do, and Kelly was soon excelling in his new hobby.\n\nAbout this time, Al introduce Kelly to Doris Herbert, who owned Drag News, and shortly thereafter he was selling his photos to Doris for the paper. With the number of racetracks running every week in Southern California, it wasn’t unusual for Jim to cover over 100 races a year. Why Kelly was selling a lot of photos to Drag News, he had dozens more that were just piling up in his office, so he soon teamed up with Phil Bellamy and founded Drag Sport Illustrated. From this point on, his career as a professional race photographer skyrocketed. His photos started appearing in all the national magazines covering the sport in addition to the weekly papers.\n\nIn 1964 at the NHRA US Nationals, the publisher of Super Stock and Drag Illustrated approached Jim with the idea of accompanying the newly formed United States Drag Racing Team on its upcoming tour of England, and a few days later he was on his way across the pond. Later that year Jim moved from California to Virginia and took on the job as full-time photo editor of SS&DI. Not long after this move, the publishers of SS&DI started a new magazine, Stock-Car Racing, and Kelly was off to the stock car races. SS&DI was the magazine that gave the East Coast racers the best shot of national exposure during the beginning of their careers, and it was Jim’s coverage of such regular features as “Match Race Madness” and other such promotions that put them into the spotlight. It was Jim’s coverage of this type a special promotion that help popularize this form of showmanship, bringing the likes of “Grumpy” Jenkins, “Dyno” Don Nicholson, Sox and Martin, and Gapp & Rausch into thousands of homes each month.\n\nJim was one of the truly professional photographer was willing to attend the smaller backwater facilities that didn’t get a lot of publicity but were the early match races spent most of their early careers. This was one of Jim specialties, covering the racetracks that most people didn’t even know existed. Using gems photos of side-by-side funny car racing at the AHRA and outlaw tracks to demonstrate to NHRA the popularity of these cars, the funny car racers were able to convince NHRA of the value of a separate class just for them.\n\nIn 1969 Kelly was offered the chance to work for Peterson Publishing on Hot Rod Magazine. This is a dream come true, and soon Kelly was off to California again, where he went to work at PPC in their photo lab providing photos for all of its magazines. While it appeared to be a dream come true, it wasn’t long before Jim Tice, president of AHRA, made Kelly another offer that was too good to pass up. Shortly after Jim joined up with AHRA, the association launched its own weekly paper, Drag World, with Kelly as its editor.\n\nAs Kelly’s talents became even more renown, the job offers can you come in, and in 1976 the new publisher of Super Stock Magazine enticed Jim back to Virginia again, where he became the publisher of the magazine. 1979 brought another call from Jim Tice at AHRA, but this time it wasn’t just to edit the paper. Tice wanted Jim to learn the business of managing the association. Kelly stayed there until the early 1980s when Jim Tice passed away in the Association was sold. After 25 years on the circuit, Jim decided to retire from the sport. Not willing to watch the world from a rocking chair, Jim was involved with cars as the owner of a business that supplied new cars to electronic and print media automotive journalist for road test evaluation.\n\nSteve Collision was a diehard drag racer who became the most respected magazine editor of his time. Though “Stevie” new most of the pro-racers and covered them knowledgeably for three decades, his true love was the “little guy”.\n\nPrior to boldly answering a LA Times classified ad placed by Peterson Publishing in 1970, Steve’s life had paralleled that of other young gearheads growing up in Southern California. A series of street racing scares unfortunately redirected his energies towards Lions Dragstrip, where Collision set an AHRA National Record with his 1969 SS396 Chevelle and enjoyed his finest racing moment; a runner-up finish in one of the earliest $1000 to win bracket races at the wheel of his adoptive parent’s bone stocks Buick Riviera.\n\nSteve was only 23 and without a single byline to his credit when his employment interview somehow persuaded Car Craft editor Terry Cook and publisher John raffia to appoint him the staff of the eras largest, most intellectual drag racing magazine. His clever, controversial writing style didn’t always win him fans with Car Craft’s advertising staff between 1970 and 1974, but it did earn him a strong following of loyal readers and racers (pros and sportsman alike). That outspoken style clearly didn’t translate well to National Dragster, where Steve briefly toiled as Associate Editor (for about 15 minutes, he’d like to say) before finding a new home, 3000 miles away from Los Angeles. In 1975, Collision became the editor of Super Stock and Drag Illustrated a position he would occupy three different times: 1975 to 1976, 1980 to 1988, and 1993 to 1998. Each time, Steve he was hired in response to popular demand from loyal readers, influential racers, and advertisers who respected his ability and incorruptibility.\n\nBetween hitches with SS&DI, this uniquely versatile editor produced some of the most memorable issues of cars magazine: Muscle Cars, High-Performance Mopar, Bracket Racing USA, and Muscle Mustangs and Fast Fords. He also took a shot at doing public relations for Hurst, but never felt comfortable in the role. It was during his historic stint at the helm of Muscle Mustangs that Collision turned the new car purchased from Ford (for one dollar) into the legendary “Mean Mr. Mustang” issue by issue.\n\nIt was the combination of the fledgling publication in this particular vehicle that single-handedly launched the late-model Mustang movement. Moreover, it was with this mustang that Stevie set one final national record, in IHRA’s Pure Stock category, in 1987. Later, he would earn NHRA competition Super Gas and Super Comp licenses, and seriously compete in both categories.\n\nHis friends remarked that no matter where in the world a new driving school open, it was only a matter of time before Steve would enroll and graduate with honors. Collisions final editorial challenge was rebuilding Racing USA into a wider ranging package entitled Drag Racing USA. It was during a working telephone conversation with one of his favorite contributors and best friends, Bill Wilson, that Stevie scum to a massive heart attack in his home office near Atco Raceway. He was 54. Like some of his fellow photojournalists, Steve he was known for living his life “wide-open”. Unlike most of his peers, Collision remain true to his first loves class and bracket racing; with particular affection for cars with carburetors, doors, and manual transmissions. He worked on them, he drove them, and he wrote about them. He defended their rightful place in drag racing right up to the day he died, on December 14, 2000.\n\nThe best way to sum up who Don Cook was is to say that of all the characters who have been associated with drag racing, Don stood out from them all. One example of what made Don different was that once while walking across the street, a driver failed to stop and hit him, breaking his leg. Typical of Cook, neither he nor the driver had any insurance so Cook silver taped his leg up and went back on the road with the funny car.\n\nDon drove a variety of top fuel dragsters and funny cars over the years, compiling an impressive win record at race tracks all across the country. Don was also one of the most consistent match racers of his time. At one-point time, Cook had teamed up with Jim Nicoll on the “Top Dog I” fuel dragster in which he became the first person to break the 223 MPH barrier. Shortly after Cook made his 223 MPH run, Drag Magazine gave him the title “Mr. 223”. Like all racers, Don was happy with the 223 speed for the day, then he promptly set about breaking it. Before too long, Cook was able to stretch the record to 236 MPH.\n\nWith all the exposure Don received driving fuel dragsters, his antics in the funny car wars are what most fans and other races remember him four. Don’s “Southwind Too” funny car was the most memorable of the group. The fact that it had a 230-inch wheelbase made “Southwind Too” longer than any other funny cars of the day, and his choice of a 392 Hemi with a big stroker kit and a “trick” cam gave the car a unique sound, Don Cook was also the man to beat on the funny car match race circuit.\n\nAnother unique feature of Cook’s racing program was that he and his wife, Sharon, where the team, and their daughter Shelley was there private cheerleader. Don said ET and MPH strip records at half Moon Bay, Fremont, Wichita, and Kansas and many other tracks from coast to coast. He won Top Eliminator at the World Finals in New York in 1968 and one the Grand American at Marion, Ohio in 1971 in addition to his match race win record.\n\nAnother one of the early pioneers in the sport of drag racing, Gary Cagle was a man of many moods. Must of the time he was a happy go lucky individual, but if he was pushed hard he could be about as tough as anyone around. He had a true love affair with racing and didn’t limit this love to just working on a car driving it. Gary started racing almost as soon as the old Santa Ana Dragstrip opened and in a variety of cars. One of his early rides was a four-banger powered rail job that he campaigned with partner Don Hampton.\n\nWhile he was known as the driver of many early drag cars, Gary’s first real notoriety came while he was driving Chet Herbert’s slingshot dragster. This car was one of the very first to be fitted with a 392 Chrysler Hemi engine and a tip mounted blower. It was also one of the first cars to top the 180 MPH mark, which it did in 1959.\n\nDriving for Herbert also gave Gary a tie-in with Chet sister, Doris Herbert, who owned and published Drag News. Gary was one of the first drag racers who decided he could make a living as a touring professional drag racer, and through Doris, Gary was able to arrange for a tour of midwestern and eastern drag strips in the summer of 1959. California hot shoe started the tour out on a high note, but a crash at great Bend after a 160 MPH run cut short the entire tour. Gary suffered a lot of physical damage, and it was a long time before he recovered enough to begin racing again. When Gary was able to reenter the drag racing wars, he did so in style. For his return entry, Gary built one of the most memorable machines ever, a canary yellow 1927 T-Roadster with a Chrysler Windsor engine driving through a torque converter. The Newhouse Auto sponsored roadster really shook up the competitors at Lions dragstrip in 1964 and 1965.\n\nIt was during the same period that Gary became one of the most outspoken leaders of the United Drag Racing Association and organization of immense political significance in the history of drag racing. Gary helped the you UDRA organization go to battle with many of the strip managers and operators over such things as safety, purses, and other issues he believed were not in the best interest of the racers. No one ever knew Gary to back away from fighting for his beliefs when it came to racing.\n\nAfter Gary decided to retire the Newhouse Auto roadster, he continued to campaign a variety of other machines including the gorgeous Briggs-Cagle-Steen car that was best known for its unique trapdoor parachute arrangement. Even as he continued to be one of the toughest competitors on the race track, Gary was gradually shifting his interest in other directions. While at the UDRA, he had gained experience in producing successful events, and he also gained a lot of knowledge while working in the hot car staging at some of AHRA’s major meets. With this experience behind them, in the 1970s Gary decided to take a more active leadership role in the Southern California timing Association, where he served in many positions. Gary took the lead SCTA’s fight to retain access to its racing at El Mirage, and he was a leader in upgrading the timing equipment and eventually took charge of timing and internal communication at every Lakes and Bonneville event staged. This love affair with the SCTA was Gary’s passion until the end of his life in 1996. Drag racing never made Gary Cagle he super celebrity, and it certainly never made him monetarily rich, but it did give Gary something money couldn’t buy, the enjoyment of participating in a sport he loved and a man who was rich and friends.\n\nDon Alderson, more commonly known as “Muldoon” or “Dooner”, was born in Hawaii, where he lived until shortly after Pearl Harbor, at which time his family moved to Southern California. As a teenager, Don, like a lot of other young men around the country, earned his spending money working in a gas station. While waiting to reach the age in which he could get his learner’s permit, Don purchased a rebuild Model A roadster. After school, Don enrolled in college and shortly thereafter he and a friend competed a T-bucket roaster, which they competed with at the old Santa Anna Dragstrip. The top speed of 109 miles per hour they squeezed out of the car at Santa Anna isn’t very impressive by today’s standards, but it was great for that time.\n\nAfter a tour in Korea, Don return to Los Angeles and went to work at an engineering company and was able to complete an apprenticeship in the design and manufacturing of aircraft components and assemblies, where he learned the fine art of producing precision parts and pieces. In 1957 Don and Milo Franklin formed Milodon Engineering Inc., which is primarily engaged in producing parts for aircraft and missiles. However, Don was still involved in racing and soon began to produce a lot of the parts that went into his own cars and engines.\n\nBy this time Dooner was fully involved with Bonneville racing, drag racing, and the dry lakes; plus, he was a member of the Gear Grinders Car Club, which was associated with the Southern California Timing Association. In 1946, Don drove his street roadster to a record speed of 131 MPH. Don was like several of his fellow racers in the early days of the sport who made parts for their own use that fit and/or performed better than what was available. As other competitors learn more about the level performance he was obtaining and the fact that his parts actually fit, more and more of them began to ask him to build the same parts for them.\n\nIn 1962, Don acquired sole ownership of the company which by this time had gone from producing a few special performance parts to producing hundreds of these parts. In fact, the demand was so great that Don had begun to steer the company from an aircraft component parts manufacturer to an automotive product development and manufacturing business. In addition to the increased number parts being produced, the variety of parts had also greatly increase, and soon Milodon engineering was a full-time race engine parts manufacturer. The product line grew from special main bearing supports, oil system, and oil pans to include complete 426 Chrysler and 350 Chevy style aluminum blocks and accessories. By 1985 the business listed over 900 parts in its catalog. The top names of the day, such as Don Garlits and Chris Karamasines, help make the Milodon engines a must-have item for the serious racer.\n\nFor Don, the 60s were the glory years of racing. In 1965, aerodynamics guru Bob Herda designed the body and Dooner built the engines for the Herda, Knapp and Milodon streamliner that Herda drove to a Bonneville record on its first outing. By building in running various size engines, the car was able to compete in both B and C classes. From 1965 through 1968, the car broke its own record 18 times, with eight of those times coming in one year. In 1967 the Autolight division of Ford contacted Don and asked him to build a special SOHC engine for the streamliner to go after the Daytona Beach record. In November of that year the car ran 357+ miles per hour to set a record that stood for incredible 28 years.\n\nLike a lot of racers and enthusiasts, Don’s interests were not confined to just cars. His second love was the world of aviation. In 1953 Donner bought his first plane, a World War II era T-6 trainer. From there he moved up to a T-28 and ultimately wound up with a P-51 Mustang. Much like what resulted from his involvement in drag racing, Don was soon producing special performance parts for the major air races. Don owned several more normal planes during his life, but his ex-military ones were where his heart was.\n\nDon gave the racing and enthusiast community a lot of leading-edge parts, but he also gave it a lot of advice and valuable information. He was a thinker, innovator, and a doer. With organizations such as NHRA and SEMA recognizing his contributions to the sport with special honors including induction into the SEMA Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\nThe Founders Award is designed to honor those individuals who have had a dramatic impact on the sport and what can be best described as” special ways”. John Raffa began his career as a journalist in earnest when he was hired to become managing editor of Super Stock and Drag Illustrated in the mid-1960s. Since that time, John occupied a unique position as a teacher and mentor to others. A gifted writer and editor Raffa was always eager to pass along the lessons he has learned about journalism and editing to the new generation, with the sport of drag racing being the ultimate beneficiary of his legacy.\n\nIn 1967 Raffa was ensconced in the offices of Car Craft Magazine, where he quickly climbed the ladder from Managing Editor, to Editor, and ultimately assume the position of Publisher. As he did while at Super Stock and Drag Illustrated during his tenure at the publication bring the credo “drag racing’s complete magazine” on its flag, Raffa champion the sport of drag racing for all classes. One of his pet projects was the Car Craft Magazine All-Star Drag Racing Team program, which today is still considered one of the top awards a drag racer can receive.\n\nJohn was also always looking for new enthusiastic youth writer/photographers who he could introduce to an eager audience of drag racing fans. Among Raffa’s “finds” were the late Steve Collison and Ro McGonegal, who would also go on to edit Car Craft and number of other prime publications. As the Publisher, Raffa often had to be a buffer between the writers and company management to make sure the stories and information printed in the magazine maintain their editorial integrity.\n\nRaffa returned to Super Stock and Drag Illustrated in 1971, where he served as the magazine’s publisher for about 12 months. While his tenure in this position wasn’t a long one, his influence would be felt for a long time afterwards. It was Raffa who helped guide Jim Kelly into becoming an effective magazine editor. “I didn’t know anything about doing that kind work” Kelly recalls “Raffa taught me how to effectively read copy and make it ready for publication. Without his willingness to teach me how to do it, I wouldn’t have held the job very long”. Raffa had this same positive influence on numerous other writers whose names are well known in the publishing world.\n\nThrough the late 70s and early 80s, Raffia served as editor for both Phil Engeldrum and Haynes Publications, where he inserted drag racing stories in those magazines as often as possible, but by 1985 he was back doing what he’s always done better than anyone else in the history of drag racing photojournalism; teaching others how to be better writers and editors. Working closely with National Dragster editor Phil Burgess, Raffa helped change the publication’s direction by teaching the younger staffers how to become not only better writers, but better reporters as well. Raffa didn’t stop with the young writers; he also worked with some of the staff’s most experienced journalists, and without changing their individualistic styles, he helped them become more professional. As National Dragsters editor Phil Burgess has said, “John Raffa taught our less experienced writers how to become professionals, while at the same time making the rest of us better as well. He helped make National Dragster a quality publication, one that we could all be proud of”.\n\nJohn’s involvement with publishing Drag Racing Action Magazine help shape its editorial package into a very readable one. John when not actively working on any specific publication would spot an editing error or something in a magazine he thought could be improved, he was not bashful about picking up the phone and gently discussing it with the writer. The results mean that is an eager audience of fans and participants are going to read better and more comprehensive stories about the sport we all love so much.\n\nJohn Raffa never developed a performance-enhancing product or won a national event from behind the wheel. Rather, what Raffa did throughout his career is generously provide advice and guidance to an untold number of photojournalists, helping provide the readers of various publications with exciting and informative stories and the sports participants better coverage of their accomplishments; all of which help the sport grow to what it is today.\n\nIn 1960 Herm Petersen joined the Handlers Car Club, which was the beginning of his drag racing career. The Handlers Car Club ran the local dragstrip in Bremerton, Washington, and in 1961 Herm took over the duty of track manager, a position he held until 1968. In 1965 he was elected to the position of club president and continued as president until 1968.\n\nIn 1968 he competed in his first top fuel car, the “Viking”. In 1970 Petersen and Fitz who was a Bremerton businessman, the owner of three local restaurants, became friends, and shortly thereafter the Petersen and Fitz Race Team was born. The team campaigned mainly up and down the West Coast and in NHRA’s Division VI for the next couple years, and was dubbed “The Northwest Terror”.\n\nIn 1973 the team experienced what was one of their career highlights when they won the NHRA Gatornationals. In July 1973 the teams luck turned upside down when the car flipped over at Orange County International Raceway and Herm received critical burns over 50% of his body and face. While Herm was spending the next four months in the hospital and more time at home recovering from the burns, Sam was busy securing a three-year sponsorship agreement with Olympia brewery and building a new streamliner.\n\nThe streamliner debuted at the 1974 NHRA Winternationals in Pomona. The cars design was beautiful, but unfortunately, it proved to be too heavy to be competitive and was very quickly retired. The streamliner is on display at the Don girls Museum of Drag Racing. In May 1974 the team debuted a conventional rear engine dragster and ended the season by taking home the division VI Championship. At the NHRA World Finals they became one of the elite teams to enter the five second arena with a blast of 5.87 ET at 241.96 MPH.\n\nThe team retired its operation in 1977, and Sam return to the restaurant business. Unfortunately, Sam Fitz died in April 2000, just a few much before he and Herm were inducted into the NHRA Division VI Hall of Fame.\n\nBenny Osborn was typical of the racers from the 50s and 60s. He started racing because of his interesting cars and engines, and he liked the speed. While he was quiet and unassuming in his everyday life, when he was in a race car he was one of the strongest competitors around. Osborn began his career in 1958 in a Chevy powered B/Modified Roadster. While the roadster itself served as the basis for the next four years, it did undergo several modifications as Osborn periodically lengthened it to meet the increasing speeds and then the carburetors on the Chevy were set on top of a supercharger. Osborn’s final conversion to the modified roadster was to stretch it enough to accommodate a second blown Chevy engine and remove the roadster body so that was a legal top gas dragster.\n\nWhile Osborn had a lot of success and wins in the modified roadster, the twin engine dragster really moved him into the national spotlight. In 1962 Bernie won the AHRA Nationals Top Gas title at Green Valley, Texas and campaigned the car throughout the Southwest, winning against the likes of Eddie Hill and Jimmy Nix. Always searching for greater performance and speed, in 1963 Osborn sold the twin-engine car and built a super lightweight Chevy powered top fuel dragster. While the car was very competitive, while racing at Mo-Kan Dragway in Kansas, Osborn crashed and was seriously injured. After recovered from his injuries he joined his friend Leon Fraser’s crew but decided he really wanted to drive again.\n\nAs soon as he made the decision to drive again, Osborn purchased Fred Swanda’s Woody Gilmore built top fuel car and put together a blown Chrysler for power. The car proved to be one that would give Bernie his greatest moments in racing. It was in this car he won back to back NHRA top fuel world championships. In 1967 he defeated Don Prudhomme in the final round of the NHRA World Finals in Tulsa Oklahoma to become the NHRA Top Fuel Champion (at this time, the winner of the world finals was declared the top fuel champion). By 1968, Osborn had added a full body to the dragster, making it not only one of the most feared cars on the circuit, but also one of the most beautiful ones as well. 1968 proved to be another stellar year for Osborn. He defeated Beebe and Mulligan to win the NHRA World Finals in Tulsa in and won the AHRA Top Fuel World Championship event in Kansas City. Earlier that year in what was billed as the “richest-per-second” sporting event, Osborn beat Tom “The Mongoose” McEwen in a one-shot match race for $14,000, which was a lot of prize money at that time.\n\nOsborn continue campaign his front motor dragster through the 1970 season. In 1971 he fielded a rear engine powered dragster but midway through the year decided the cost of running the car both in time and money was too much, and he retired from the sport. Osborn went on to operates a garage that did all around service on street driven cars. Like most strong competitors, their times Benny does miss the sport, but he admits he also likes it much better when everyone was into making a lot of their own parts and it was a lot cheaper to run a car.\n\nWayne Gapp was introduced to the sport by his neighbor and well-known racer Arnie Beswick when he began hanging around Beswick’s garage. After graduating from college, he soon found his way into Ford Motor Company. In 1964 a group of engineers formed the racing club, the “HiRisers”, with the thought in mind to counter the Ramchargers factory backed efforts. Ford Motor Company supplied them with a 1964 427 Thunderbolt, none of the group had much racing experience, and soon Wayne inherited the club assets. Wayne set out to build his own racing organization and was soon provided a 1965 427 SOHC A/FX Comet by Lincoln Mercury, which he campaigned very successfully, setting a new class NHRA ET record along the way. In 1969 Ford formed a new high-performance engine group and Wayne was put in charge of the 429-engine program, so he had to put his racing career on hold. About a year later, Ford withdrew its support from all racing, and Wayne left the company to pursue his drag racing career again.\n\nJack Rausch has always been more interested in why and how things work and how to improve them. In 1964 after receiving a degree in mathematics and a minor in physics, Ross was recruited by Ford Motor Company to work on the processing of car assembling and tooling, but his real interest was engines and how to improve them. As a Ford Motor Company employee, Jack was soon drawn into the company’s extensive motorsports activities. In 1966 Jack joined a group called “The Fastback’s”, which was composed of a group of performance minded Ford Motor Company engineers all interested in one common goal; going faster than anyone else at the racetrack. In 1969 track left Ford and began setting up his own performance/development shop. Typical of most Rausch efforts, he was soon doing development work for other teams as well as his own. In 1970, “The Fastback’s” disbanded, and Rausch began looking for a new venture. As a side note, in 1971 in 1972 while the Gapp and Rausch team was complaining their pro-stock Maverick, Jack was still doing development work and teaching mathematics, physics, and a variety of automotive subjects at Munroe Community College.\n\nIt was at this time that Wayne and Jack got together and entered the pro-stock wars. In 1971 in 1972 the team campaigned a 429 Maverick that was strong but had limited success against the Chrysler Hemi. In 1972 NHRA changed the rules to include small block engines, and the team built a small block “development” Pinto using a lot of the technology learned in the development of the 366 NASCAR engine. In 1973 the small block car set several track records and powered the team to the 1973 Pro Stock Championship. In 1974 the team campaigned two pro-stock cars. Gapp drove the infamous four-door Maverick named the “Taxi”, and Rausch drove a sleek Mustang II. The Mustang ran mainly on the East Coast match race circuit, but in the late summer of 1974, Rouch flipped it at Capital Raceway in Maryland. This was the event that was pretty much responsible for the end of his driving career in drag racing.\n\nAs opposed to the sleek Mustang and the “standard fare” two-door sedans used by other pro-stock competitors, the Maverick being a four-door sedan soon captured the imagination of the press and the spectators, and at the same time performed up to everyone’s expectations. They race the “Taxi” in Brazil and Puerto Rico as well as the states and by the end of the year had set numerous track records. The “Taxi” won the IHRA Pro Stock Championship, Le Grandnational-Molson Nationals, the NHRA US Nationals, and was runner-up for the NHRA Pro Stock Championship. One other title they one in 1974 was a very rare one, the IHRA Southern Nationals in Charlotte, North Carolina, a 1/8-mile event. At their win at the Le Grandnational event they also set a new NHRA ET record at 8.84 seconds. 1975 was another successful year with wins at the Le Grandnational-Molson Nationals, NHRA Summernationals in Englishtown, and a repeat at the NHRA US nationals.\n\nBy the end of the 1976 season, the team had no corporate sponsorship and had formed different personal goals, so the two decided to disband the program. In 1988 Gapp retired from doing prototype development and moved to Florida to pursue his hobby of fishing. Rausch, on the other hand has continued to pursue his interest in racing, moving first to the GTX and TTP cars, then to SCCA and IMSA. In 1988 Jack expanded into the NASCAR circuit, where he has been very successful.\n\nOne of the most recognized voices in drag racing belongs to Dave McClelland most commonly known as “the voice of NHRA”, who for over 40 years was one of the premier race announcers at the track, on radio, and on TV. However, Dave is not just announcer, he is also an enthusiast. Dave’s career in motorsports has paralleled his participation in the radio and television field, which began at Iowa State University in 1955. Dave announced his first drag race in 1959 and honed his skills as a race track announcer throughout the South and Southwest with a major portion of his early career experience coming from his work in Louisiana. Dave’s career received a major boost in 1961 when he was given the job of announcing the NHRA Nationals in Indianapolis.\n\nIn 1969, Dave resigned his post as program director of an NBC TV affiliate to begin a full-time career in racing, starting has the track manager in Houma, Louisiana in 1971 Dave joined the NHRA working in its promotions department. His tenure at NHRA lasted seven years, during which time he worked as Publicity Director, Public Relations Director, and Communications Director. In addition to these duties, Dave was also responsible for the production of NHRA’s radio and TV commercials and worked on the syndication of the Championship Drag Racing television series. Dave’s career as an announcer also includes working as masters of ceremonies and voiceover talent for a wide variety of clients including: NHRA, SEMA, NASCAR, ISCA, AARWBA, PWA, R.J. Reynolds, International Drag Racing Hall of Fame, Championship Auto Shows, Peterson Publishing, Emap, Primedia, Promedia, General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Castrol, Mopar, Meguiar’s The California Highway Patrol 11-99 Foundation, Los Angeles Orthopedic Hospital, and other organizations too numerous to list.\n\nDave’s Master of ceremonies duties have also included work for the prestigious Meadowbrook Hall Concours D’ Elegance and the Cranbrook Concours D’ Elegance out of Detroit and as the Sport Class announcer for the National Air Races in Reno.\n\nIn 1978 Dave went to work at Argus publishing as an advertising account executive but didn’t confine his talents to just selling ads. While at Argus, he took on the responsibility of special projects which included the creation and development of the Super Chevy Sunday series of automotive events and the popular television series, Performance Plus from Popular Hot Rodding, a program that enjoyed an extended run on TNN. In 1984 Dave resigned from Argus to form his own company, Dave McClelland Enterprises, which serves a broad range of clients both in and out of the motorsports industry.\n\nAs a further indicator of the fact that Dave is and enthusiast he served on the announcing staff at NHRA Powerade Championship Drag Racing events and was the on-camera host for the Hot Rod Magazine television series seen on the Outdoor Channel. Dave served as the anchor play-by-play host of the NHRA Speed World coverage on ESPN and ESPN2 for over 27 consecutive years. He also served as co-host of the NHRA Today program that aired weekly on TNN and the voiceover host of the Hemmings Roadshow and The Classics Road Show both seen on Speed Channel. In addition to his work in the world of drag racing and car shows, Dave also did announcing for radio television coverage of other motorsports including Formula One Grand Prix, NASCAR, SCCA, IMSA, AMA motorcycles, sprint cars, midgets, short track stock cars, and even tractor pulls.\n\nEver the enthusiast, Dave successfully campaigned a Fiat altered coupe for over 10 years, with a high point win at the 1998 March Meet at Bakersfield California. Dave placed the completely restored car on display in the NHRA Motorsports Museum in Pomona California. He also owned numerous cars including: a big block powered 1955 Chevy Delray, a 1970 GS 455 Buick convertible with a factory four-speed, a 2005 C-6 Corvette, and even constructed a 1951 Chevy Sedan Delivery. Somehow during all of his activities, Dave managed to find time to marry his wife Louise, and they are the proud parents of three children who have expanded the McClelland plan with six grandchildren."
