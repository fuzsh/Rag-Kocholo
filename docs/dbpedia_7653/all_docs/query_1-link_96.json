        "text": "For the first time in \"RuPaul’s Drag Race\" herstory a queen from Montana will be sashaying into the competition.\n\nSeason 14 of \"Drag Race\" features Bosco, born in Great Falls and the first queen from the Treasure State to compete in what some call the “Olympics of drag.”\n\n“Drag Race” is a reality television competition series featuring drag performers from across the U.S. and its territories who perform in weekly challenges leading up to the crowning of “America’s Next Drag Superstar.” Contestants have gone on to perform on Broadway and in Oscar winning films, produce television shows on major networks and record chart topping music, and more.\n\nBosco, born Christopher Constantino who goes by she/they out of drag and she/her in drag, comes from a family of entertainers with parents who both played in the U.S. Air Force band and with local music legend Bud Nicholls for a grandpa, who led The Great Falls Municipal Band for over 40 years.\n\nBosco said Nicholls’ was dating and is now married to dance instructor Linda Fuller of Miss Linda’s School of Dance, where she took dance classes through High School.\n\n“Growing up I had no shortage of being around and a part of the arts, which really influenced what I'm doing now,” Bosco said.\n\nBosco was profiled in the Tribune over a decade ago after being awarded the Dance Educators of America Senior Boy Titlist rank at the national competition in Las Vegas in 2010. Her tap solo to Frank Sinatra’s “Fly Me to the Moon” received the highest award given by the judges.\n\nFuller said she’s excited to tune in to watch her former student and step-grandchild compete and described Bosco as a “triple threat” with singing, dancing and acting skills. She said both the studio and the family are proud and she commended her style and makeup, adding that she's very artistic.\n\nBosco's beginnings in drag\n\nBosco said she moved to Seattle to pursue a career in choreography, saying her original plan was to figure out how to eventually make it in Los Angeles to do commercial dance work.\n\n“I found drag to be so much more fun and so much more freeing, and fell in love with it,” Bosco said.\n\nShe said she started out in the Seattle drag scene as backup dancer for drag queens and then performed for the first time in drag in 2018.\n\n“I kind of paid my dues first and then started doing it,” Bosco said. “By the time I started buying my first costume and wigs, I was like, 'Oh no, I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do this up.'”\n\nBosco said she does a lot of dancing in her live acts and said a dance background came in handy with the choreography and performance challenges on the show.\n\n“I feel like drag and dance are pretty heavily related,” she said. “It’s not the focal point of everything I do but it definitely informs the movement and the way I start to tackle every number.”\n\nIn a YouTube video of Bosco performing a lip-sync number to the Disney song “Part of Your World” she donned facial prosthetics and wore a headpiece with a lightbulb in front to mimic an Anglerfish, passing out lights to the crowd to light up the small room.\n\nBosco's appearance on 'Drag Race'\n\nShe said she always wanted to be successful in whatever field she pursued. Once she decided on drag, she knew the biggest platform would be “Drag Race.” Since the cast was announced she said her Instagram following went from 3,000 to 40,000.\n\nBosco said she want to be the “millennial Elvira” and do one woman shows and appear in television specials.\n\nShe admires the careers that “Drag Race” alumni have gone on to have, like Season Seven winner and burlesque performer Violet Chachki, Season Three winner and co-host of “Fashion Photo RuView” Raja and Season Five, All Stars Two fashionista Detox.\n\nShe said Ongina of Season One and All Stars Five gave them advice to “buckle up” for the “Drag Race” ride ahead.\n\n“Most of the queens that I know that have done the show are basically just saying, ‘there's no way to be ready, so be ready for that,’” Bosco said, adding,“Wow, thanks, that's really helpful.”\n\nAdvice for aspiring local entertainers\n\nBosco’s advice for young aspiring entertainers in Great Falls?\n\n“Try to find your own lane. Try to carve out your own path. Regardless if that means figuring out something in Great Falls, moving to a bigger place that has more opportunities,” Bosco said. “The only thing that's gonna hold you back is your own creativity and your own drive.”\n\nBosco said she did a ton in the art programs in Great Falls and recommended young people still in school to take as many classes as possible.\n\n“I never felt like I was going to stay in Great Falls, just because it just didn't fit what I wanted to do with my life, but I received a lot of support and love from Great Falls,” she said.\n\nThe Great Falls LGBTQ+ Center said in a statement that Great Falls can be a difficult place to be LGBTQ+, “so seeing one of our own thriving is a wonderful boost for all of us. We are proud and excited to watch Bosco and will be cheering them on!”\n\nFinding love in Seattle\n\nBosco found love when she moved to Washington State. She said her boyfriend has a horse named Ted whom she loves very much.\n\n“I left Great Falls to find a boy who looks like everyone from Great Falls,” Bosco said with a laugh.\n\nShe said she normally makes it back to Great Falls every six months or so, but the COVID-19 omicron variant spreading rapidly nixed her Christmas trip this year.\n\nShe said she’d be in Seattle to watch the premiere of the show, a city she's representing in the show and on Instagram as the “Demon Queen of Seattle.”\n\n“Drag Race” hasn’t featured a queen from the Seattle drag scene since Ben de la Creme in Season Six.\n\nBosco’s New Year’s resolution?\n\n“Make as much money as possible in 2022,” she said. “I feel like that could be a lot of people's resolution, I think it's a good one to have.”\n\n“RuPaul’s Drag Race” airs on VH1 this Friday, Jan. 7 at 6 p.m. MT."
