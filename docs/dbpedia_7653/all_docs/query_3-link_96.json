        "text": "Sweet as pie and sharp as cheddar, the Terminally Delightful BenDeLaCreme is known for combining her background in performing and visual arts with a love of spectacle, glamour, and Saturday morning cartoons. She has dazzled crowds throughout the Americas, Europe, and Australia, premiered four critically acclaimed solo shows Off-Broadway, as well as written, directed, and produced myriad narrative works and variety spectaculars that have played to sold-out audiences for over a decade. BenDeLaCreme’s live performances have received glowing reviews: “Keeping you entertained while making you think about your place in the world is all a part of the BenDeLaCreme experience,” said Forbes and Billboard raves that her work “...soars past entertainment and into the realm of theatrical art.”\n\nBenDeLaCreme has appeared on two seasons of the Emmy Award-winning RuPaul’s Drag Race, her first go-round securing her a spot among the show’s “15 Fan Favorites of All Time.” After being crowned “Miss Congeniality” on Season 6, she returned to compete on the third season of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars on VH1 where she garnered more challenge wins than any other competitor in the show’s history, among other series records.\n\nContinuing to break new ground by, and for, drag artists, in 2018 DeLa’s production company, BenDeLaCreme Presents, produced its first national tour with, To Jesus, Thanks for Everything! -Jinkx and DeLa, co-created and co-written by BenDeLaCreme and Jinkx Monsoon. In 2019, the queens hit the road again with a brand new holiday show titled, All I Want for Christmas is Attention. That tour was a sold-out sensation and marked DeLa’s first producer credit for an international tour. BenDeLaCreme is thrilled to add producing and directing her first film to her long list of career achievements.\n\nbendelacreme.com\n\ninstagram\n\ntwitter\n\nSince winning Season 5 of RuPaul's Drag Race, Jinkx Monsoon has travelled the world performing her original cabaret shows with her music partner, Major Scales. The duo are best known for their highly acclaimed show The Vaudevillians, which enjoyed multiple extensions Off-Broadway and toured to many international festivals.\n\nWith original music by Major Scales, Jinkx has released two albums: The Inevitable Album and The Ginger Snapped (available on Apple Music [iTunes] and Spotify). While live performing is her passion, Jinkx is no stranger to film and TV work. Besides her stint in reality TV, she has appeared on the CBS cop drama Blue Bloods, the Netflix original AJ and the Queen, and has voiced characters for such animated shows as Steven Universe, Mighty Magiswords, Bravest Warriors, as well as a few surprises that are yet to come!\n\nJinkx has been the subject of two documentaries: Drag Becomes Him, and The Queens. She is an award winning stage actress, having won the Gregory Award for her portrayal of Hedwig in Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and most recently, The MAC Award for her show The Ginger Snapped co-written with Major Scales. (Gosh, his name pops up a lot in her bio). You can watch her webshow Cool Mom with comedy partner Nick Sahoyah on the streaming app WOW Presents Plus. Jinkx is extremely proud of her partnership with BenDeLaCreme, having co-written and co-starred in both To Jesus, Thanks for Everything! -Jinkx and DeLa and All I Want for Christmas is Attention. Taking their collaboration to the medium of film is a dream come true for this internationally tolerated actress and chanteuse.\n\njinkxmonsoon.com\n\ninstagram\n\ntwitter\n\nTo whom ever is reading this hello and thank you for taking the time to do so, you are appreciated! I have spent the last six years in Seattle doing mostly musical theater with companies such as The 5th Avenue Theatre, A Contemporary Theatre, ArtsWest Playhouse, and Can Can Culinary Cabaret, among others. Though, of all the roles I've had the pleasure of bringing to life this one has a special place in my heart because it allowed me to perform again during a time of such uncertainty as an artist and human. The grace and diligent work towards ensuring the work environment was inclusive and safe can not be overlooked and is deserving of praise so three cheers to everyone involved in bringing the joy and spectacle that is the dynamic duo of BenDeLaCreme and Jinkx Monsoon to a world that is in need of love and light. Should our paths never cross I hope your life is positively wonderful my friends, be well.\n\nInstagram\n\nSann (she/her) is a multi-hyphenated art maker based in Seattle, WA.

Due to his success with Haiku Tunnel and his promise as a producer, Brian received the prestigious Sundance Producer's Fellowship in 2002, where he was mentored by luminaries of the independent film industry: Ted Hope, Ron Yerxa and Scott Macaulay.\n\nIn 2002, Brian attended the Sundance producer's lab attached to Dopamine, which premiered in competition at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and was awarded the Alfred P.

Yet, outside of these cities, DeLa lamented, people only seemed to care about her time on Drag Race, knowing nothing of the kind of original and thought-provoking work she had been creating. Gus sought to bridge this gap with a solid PR strategy and was instrumental in vetting and assembling BenDeLaCreme’s incredible public relations team. Additionally, he, along with Kevin Heard, began streamlining the inner workings of BenDeLaCreme Presents, developing a strategy which enabled DeLa to focus solely on writing, producing, and performing her original theatrical work.\n\nAlways the visionary, Gus is credited for suggesting that DeLa and Jinkx team up for what has become their wildly successful, annual holiday show. Gus enjoys the many challenges of producing live theatre and he is so excited to be producing his first full-length film with the best team in the business.\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nKevin Heard has been working with BenDeLaCreme for nearly a decade to help facilitate whatever brilliant endeavor she’s up to, serving as Associate Producer and Sound Designer for her four award-winning Off-Broadway premieres, her years-long run of Beware the Terror of Gaylord Manor (an annual Halloween queer-camp spooktacular at Seattle’s ACT Theatre), and several theatrical tours both domestic and international. Kevin’s work as a theatrical sound designer has been heard on Broadway, Off-Broadway, internationally, and in dozens of regional theatre productions from coast to coast. Kevin’s latest endeavor, The Heard Company, formed in early 2020, is a production company focused on creating new experiences and enabling artists and creators from all walks of life to create and share work with a broad and diverse audience. Kevin is thrilled to be working on his first film project with BenDeLaCreme and couldn’t imagine a better team to help bring this meaningful show to life.\n\nheardaudio.com\n\nKeith Harrison is a multi-talented creative artist with experience on hundreds of projects in the music, television, film, theatre, and live events industries.
