        "text": "RuPaul\n\nAmerican entertainer\n\nRuPaul (born November 17, 1960, San Diego, California, U.S.) is an American entertainer who carved out an idiosyncratic place in popular culture as perhaps the most famous drag queen in the United States in the 1990s and early 21st century.\n\nEarly life\n\nRuPaul was born in California to parents who divorced by the time he was seven. At age 15 he moved in with one of his elder sisters in Atlanta, Georgia, and attended a performing arts high school. Always having a flair for dress-up, he began performing in drag while on the underground movie and nightclub circuit in Atlanta. In 1987 he moved to New York City and began his career in go-go bars and on television on The Gong Show and MTV.\n\nSupermodel of the World and acting\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nStanding about 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 meters) and wearing elaborate makeup and gowns, RuPaul gained much recognition on the New York club scene. In 1993 he released the dance-pop album Supermodel of the World, which featured the upbeat single “Supermodel (You Better Work).” With the help of a music video in which he strutted in a blonde wig and assorted glamorous outfits, the song became a surprise mainstream hit.\n\nIts success led to parts for RuPaul in several films, including Crooklyn (1994), Blue in the Face (1995), The Brady Bunch Movie (1995), and the drag-themed comedy To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar (1995). In addition, in 1995 he appeared in the documentary Wigstock: The Movie, published an autobiography, Lettin It All Hang Out, and signed a contract with M.A.C. Cosmetics, becoming the first drag queen to become a spokesmodel for a major cosmetics company.\n\nLater albums and RuPaul’s Drag Race\n\nRuPaul returned to the recording studio for the album Foxy Lady (1996), which he soon followed with the holiday release Ho Ho Ho (1997). Although he would not release another album until Red Hot (2004), RuPaul continued to appear in film and on television. He hosted a variety television program, The RuPaul Show (1997–98), was a frequent guest on talk shows, and took on minor acting roles.\n\nBeginning in 2009, RuPaul hosted and coproduced RuPaul’s Drag Race, a reality television show that named “America’s next drag superstar.” The popular program was credited with reviving RuPaul’s flagging career, and he won Emmy Awards (2016–23) as the show’s host. RuPaul’s Drag Race also received the Emmy for best competition show (2018–21 and 2023). His eponymous talk show and a U.K. version of Drag Race both debuted in 2019.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

RuPaul also cocreated the TV series AJ and the Queen (2020), in which he played a drag queen traveling across the United States, accompanied by a 10-year-old girl; the comedy aired on Netflix. In 2024 RuPaul released the candid memoir The House of Hidden Meanings.\n\nAnthony Green"
