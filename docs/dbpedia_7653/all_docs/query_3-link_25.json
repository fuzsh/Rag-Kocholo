        "text": "Prior to joining WUSA9, Lorenzo served as the primary evening anchor at WTIC-TV, the FOX affiliate in Hartford, Connecticut. His extensive reporting on the current struggles of Vietnam veterans aired nationally on all Tribune Media television stations.\n\nBefore Connecticut, Lorenzo was the 5 p.m. anchor and reporter for WTVR-TV, the CBS affiliate in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nHe covered a variety of stories while in Richmond, from consistently uncovering wrongdoing by local leaders to flying through a hurricane multiple times aboard a P-3 hurricane hunter aircraft.\n\nLorenzo spent several years in the Midwest for school and work. He’s a proud Tiger and studied journalism at the University of Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia, Missouri. At “Mizzou,” Lorenzo had the opportunity to spend a portion of his last semester touring Europe to study journalism practices in Belgium, France, Italy and Germany.\n\nWhile in Columbia, Lorenzo also served as general assignment reporter at KOMU-TV, the NBC affiliate and covered politics for NPR affiliate, KBIA-FM\n\nDuring winter and summer breaks in college, Lorenzo continued to gain experience in journalism. He was an Emma L. Bowen work-study scholar for four years at NBC4 in Washington, D.C.\n\nLorenzo’s television career began in high school as a “Posse Member” on Black Entertainment Television’s former talk show for teens, “Teen Summit.”\n\nCrystal is best known for her string of domestic and international number one dance hits in the 1990’s, including her 1991 signature smash, “Gypsy Woman (She’s Homeless)”, which garnered her 3 American Music Award nominations and made her an international sensation. “Gypsy Woman” became a #1 global smash because of its socially-conscious lyrics and positively infectious hook.\n\nCrystal’s impressive 13 #1 Billboard Dance Chart hits and 11 Top 10 songs have resulted in well over 100 million streams on Spotify, YouTube, and 2.12 million followers on Shazam at the very least.\n\nAdding to her musical accolades, she had another #1 hit in Europe in 2009, with Alex Gaudino called “Destination Calabria,” it achieved the #1 Pop Chart status in over 40 countries around the world. Later, her single “Testify” with UK producer Hi-Fi Sean was in top rotation on BBC Radio 2, a song that to date, she still gets asked to perform.\n\nYet another #1 club hit was in 2018 with “I Am House,” produced by Sted-E & Hybrid Heights and released on Kenny Dope’s Dopewax Records, with Kenny being a 4x Grammy nominee himself. This would bring her overall tally of hits to 16 #1’s and Top 10 singles in over 15 countries to date.\n\nIn 2021, a feature on RuPaul’s Drag Race drove Crystal’s ‘100% Pure Love’ to re-enter the Top 10 on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Sales Chart. With millions of new streams, and the decision to make it the year’s official anthem of NYC Pride, it ignited Universal Music to re-release the song with brand new remixes.\n\nHer recent release “Party People” with Dj Spen and remix by Michael Grey garnered major support from the likes of BBC Radio One, Nexus Radio, Pete Tong, Carl Cox, Low-Steppa and many others. With her studio work in constant flow, Crystal is on deck to work with some renowned producers on more amazing new upcoming releases.\n\nThere’s more to this world-renowned artist than just releasing music. Since the start of her career, Crystal has been a staunch advocate for LBGTQ Rights and AIDS research. She was also involved in the creation of the Soundexchange Bill passed by the US Congress in 2008. (Soundexchange collects and distributes digital performance royalties for recording artists) and was invited to the White House along with several other artists for their efforts. Crystal also\n\nwalked the halls of Capitol Hill speaking to Congress several times, advocating for the passage of the Performance Rights Act, which seeks to correct a loophole that allows AM and FM radio broadcasters to not pay performers for their work. She received the Prestigious Howard University Award for Distinguished Postgraduate Achievement, and is listed among the Who’s Who of Black America, as singer, songwriter and producer.\n\nIn 2019, TV One’s award-winning documentary series “Unsung” featured an episode dedicated to Crystal’s journey, giving us special insight to her extraordinary musical career.\n\nCrystal has begun touring once again with the success of her songs “House of Light,” released on her own IAH Records label which landed a Top 10 position in the UK’s Music Week Pop Dance Chart and “Never Enough” a track she did with Richie Blacker out on Atlantic Records.\n\nMost recently her single with Soul Central and RobinS hit #1 on the revered House platform, Traxsource and her self-released single with David Anthony and remixed by Todd Terry and Grammy Winner David Morales “2B Luv” hit Top 10 on Music Week’s Club Chart in the UK….and there’s more to come!\n\nHope Giselle is a well-known and highly respected National Organizer, Author, Artist, and Activist, who has been a driving force in the fight for inclusion and social justice.

Recently, Hope has taken on a new role as President, CEO, and Executive Director of the National Trans Visibility March, where she continues to champion the rights and visibility of the transgender community on a national scale.\n\nHope’s impact extends far beyond her work with organizations; she is also a two-time best-selling author of “Until I Met Black Men” and “Becoming Hope,” both of which focus on her lived experiences growing up as a black trans woman in the south. Her writing has inspired countless individuals to embrace their true selves and has helped to create a more accepting and inclusive society.

A non-profit organization based in Washington D.C. Kenya continues to push the envelope in making ballroom culture recognized as a vibrant, resilient community worthy of praise and support by non-ballroom mainstream organizations.\n\nIn recent years Kenya has been a leading voice in the discussion urging research and interventions addressing substance use within the ballroom community, especially Crystal Meth use, as well as developing systems to provide relief support for the ballroom community during the COVID-19 pandemic and most recently the MPOX outbreak.\n\nThe work of Kenya Hutton is dedicated to the enhancement of the health, economic, and social well-being of marginalized and disenfranchised communities.\n\nMs. Jameson has worked in the Northern Virginia community for over 35 years, developing and administering programs that address health care disparities and provide access to health care services to those who are underserved.

This is what you get when you see Tula hosting one of her regular cabaret shows in the District. A former title holder and member of the Academy of Washington, DC she brings a plethora of stage experience to any show. When friends are asked, they describe her drag more as illusionist work because when she takes the stage, she truly does embody the spirit of the artists she performs too. By day, she is an esthetician and hair stylist for a number of local theatre and event companies. In the evenings and on weekends, when she is not gracing the stage performing, you can often catch her out and about, around town at a nonprofit function, an embassy event, or taking in a theatre production, in full drag, immaculately put together, mixing and mingling with the other socialites from our Nation’s Capital.\n\nJosé Alberto Uclés, is originally from Honduras, and has lived in the Washington, DC area for over 40 years. He loves his work for the past 23 years at the U.S. Department of Transportation – as the Hispanic Outreach Spokesperson, and Public Affairs Specialist for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

Before that with TheatreWashington, he was a 3-year Helen Hayes Theatre Award Judge. He is supportive of our fantastic LGBTQ+, and helps host Pride Nights with Washington National Opera, IN Series and others.

The creative industries have been and will continue to be critical factors in our city’s economic development, revitalization, richness and keep on making our Nation’s Capital region a vibrant and rich world-class destination!”\n\nMs. Iya Dammons is the Founding Executive Director of DC Safe Haven and Maryland Safe Haven and visionary activist for the TLGBQIA+ community. As a proud trans woman of color, Ms. Dammons suffered the direct impacts of race and gender-based discrimination through her experiences of homelessness, substance use, violence, and survival sex work in the very streets where she now works to provide help to TLGBQIA+ folks living in survival mode.\n\nIn 2018, she founded Maryland Safe Haven, and created a chapter and 2023 DC Safe Haven, nonprofit organizations based on the civil rights model of “each one, teach one”, and “for us, by us.” Today, MSH provides dedicated TLGBQIA+ housing, workforce development, HIV testing, healthcare, legal services and she is slowly building DC SAFE HAVEN to replicate the same service division, lines m – all from the perspective of oneness and solidarity with the community. In her passion for investing in emerging trans leaders, MSH is now the largest employer of TLGBQIA+ lived-experience staff in the state of Maryland and the only trans-led nonprofit in the DMV area.\n\nMs. Dammons is a nationally recognized activist who centers trans rights in our nation’s dialogue. She organized the Black Trans Lives Matter March featured on the cover of Time Magazine in 2020, commissioned the Black Trans Lives Matter mural which stretches across 2 full city blocks in Baltimore known as “The Stroll” among sex workers, and debuted the first Trans Pride event in Baltimore history.

That first year he sold drink tickets at the Opening Party and the plan was for him to volunteer for a few hours and then enjoy the event. This plan changed when a Capital Pride member asked if any of the volunteers could stay (which he had since learned is a part of the job as Pride organizers).\n\nThe next year, William volunteered as part of the production team rather than for just a one-day event. Not knowing what team to join, William was selected as an Executive Producer of Health and Safety. Soon, William became a member of the Capital Pride Chairship as the Health and Safety Chair and still operates in this capacity. At the time, the Chairship presented new volunteer leadership opportunities for the organization.\n\nSince being the Health and Safety Chair, William has formed alliances and relationships with GW Hospital, DC FEMS, and the DC Licensing Division. William is normally the first to arrive on Parade Day to retrieve the golf carts and the last one to leave after leading a train of golf carts to our Festival site.\n\nWilliam volunteers with Capital Pride every year because “the members of Capital Pride have become his second family, and he would be lost without each and every one of them.”"
