His sensual, passionate vocal delivery ranges over a style that combines deep roots reggae with the sweetness of lovers rock.\n\nDread was born Mariano Javier Castro in Quequén, Argentina in January of 1978. When he was seven years old, his family moved to Maipú, a suburb of Buenos Aires. His first professional gig was as lead singer of the Reggae Messengers. After three years, Dread put together a band and went solo. His debut album Jah Guia was initially issued independently, but garnered wide attention when a couple of enterprising DJs decided to play it. His gigs got larger and soon the major labels came calling. Sony/BMG signed him and reissued Jah Guia across Latin America in 2006. Sales were better than anyone expected.\n\nHe was asked by renowned reggae big band Los Cafres to be a stable opener for them (and sing in their backing chorus), including a massive show at Luna Park, which greatly expanded the singer’s profile. Later that year, he and his band performed at the first annual Bob Marley Day festival at Luna Park with the Wailers and Peter Tosh Band. Working with Los Cafres and headlining his own gigs had their advantages; because of the attention — and the money — he was able to record a second album with his own band, Los Guerreros del Rey. It was released in 2007. The following year, with the release of the album Amor-es, Dread became an in-demand attraction. He played 70-plus shows nationally and toured abroad as well. By the time he released Viví en Do in 2010, he was the most popular reggae singer in Argentina, and had established an international following that reached across most of Latin America.\n\nHis reputation also extended into the Caribbean: 2011’s Tranquilo was a collaborative album with no less a talent than Jamaica’s Luciano. With his new backing band, Warriors of the King, he took his show to Mexico and the United States. In late 2011 and early 2012, Dread worked at Panda and TAMS studios and delivered Transparente, a record that took him onto the streaming charts in the reggae, tropical and Latin categories. It also revealed his increasing studio savvy — he mixed it himself. Its success also made his Luna Park shows all but impossible to get into; tickets sold out months in advance.\n\nHe went back to the studio and issued the hit single “Nada” (backed by a Jamaican chorus) in early 2014. He followed it with the video single “No Te Asustes Ahora”, which netted hundreds of thousands of views in its first weeks on YouTube. As a result, the 17-song full-length En el Sendero went gold.\n\nIn 2016, Dread celebrated his tenth anniversary as a recording artist with a show at the massive El Planetario in Palermo, Buenos Aires. The price of admission was donations of food, clothing or cash for the homeless. An expansive audio-video package entitled 10 Anos — featuring both new and catalog songs as well as a documentary — was released and climbed the streaming and download charts. The recording also featured the studio track “Hoja en Blanco”, a revisioned vallenato standard. A demo version of it appeared on the artist’s Facebook page and garnered over five million views.\n\nAlso Scheduled to Perform: Bayonics\n\nTickets: $45-$60\n\nTickets are on sale as of June 14.\n\n> San Jose Civic Events Calendar\n\n> Visitor FAQs (Including List of Prohibited Items)\n\nDrew Afualo is a content creator, women’s rights advocate, podcast host and author best known as TikTok’s “Crusader for Women”.\n\nFrom her hilariously witty content to her no-BS approach to shoveling misogyny out of the TikTok app via viral takedowns, Drew takes female empowerment to new levels and has established herself as a preeminent feminist leader of her generation with an audience of over nine million of social media. She was named Adweek’s 2022 Digital & Tech Creator of the Year, Meta’s Creator of Tomorrow, one of Time magazine’s Next Generation Leaders, and one of Forbes’ Top Creators of 2023.\n\nDrew served as the official red-carpet correspondent at the 2023 Academy Awards and hosts the Spotify-exclusive podcast The Comment Section. Her first book, LOUD: Accept Nothing Less Than the Life You Deserve, has a publishing date of July 30th, 2024 via AUWA Books.\n\nJoin Drew and Deison for an in-depth discussion of truly the dumbest sh**, live on stage. Just like the recorded version of the show, Drew and Deison will spend time discussing the tea of the day, answering some questions from fans, and potentially even roasting an unsavory character or two.\n\nSpecial attention will be given to Drew’s new book LOUD, including some discussion of the book’s themes. Not that either Afualo sister holds back much, but “Two Idiot Girls Live” will be the hour-long uncensored version of Drew and Deison, live and in person.\n\n> Montgomery Theater Events Calendar\n\n> Visitor FAQs\n\nPOSTPONEMENT NOTICE: Due to unforeseen circumstances, Ramon Ayala’s “El Principio de Un Final” Tour scheduled for August 23rd at the San Jose Civic is being postponed to Friday, December 6th. All original tickets will be valid for the new date.\n\nRamon Ayala — born in Monterrey, Mexico — has mastered the artistry of being an accordionist/vocalist/songwriter for over forty years. He has defined norteño music with signature songs and definitive instrumental styling that have made him a superstar on both sides of the El Rio Grande.\n\nAs a teenager in the early sixties, Ramon virtually invented modern conjunto music, teaming up with the late bajo sexto guitarist/vocalist Cornelio Reyna to form Los Relampagos del Norte. The duo forged a distinctive sound and compiled a roster of songs that have since been covered by countless artists in contemporary Latin music. Their first hit single “Ya no llores” was recorded in 1963.\n\nFor the next eight years, Los Relampagos del Norte tore up the music charts by revolutionizing and re-inventing norteño music, a genre that was then considered exclusively cantina music. The talented duo recorded a total of twenty albums, creating many classics.\n\nAfter Cornelio Reyna left to pursue his own ranchero career in 1971, Ramon Ayala set out to prove that he could make it on his own and formed the legendary band, Ramon Ayala y sus Bravos del Norte in late 1971. Together, Ramon and Eliseo Robles forged a partnership and created a style that became the standard for norteño music. During the Eliseo Robles years, Ramon Ayala y sus Bravos del Norte’s album sales reached peak high in Mexico and the United States with hits such as: “Un rinconcito en el cielo”, “Chaparra de mi amor”, “Tragos amargos” and many others.\n\nRamon has won and has been nominated for several Grammy awards. In 2001, Ramon was awarded with an American Grammy award for the album En Vivo… El Hombre Y Su Musica. Ramon has also been awarded with two Latin Grammys’ for the albums Quemame Los Ojos and El Numero Cien. Ramon has been nominated a total of ten times. He has more than 107 albums in his catalogue and he also took part in thirteen movies, sharing credits with talents such as Antonio Aguilar, Los Hermanos Almada and Cornelio Reyna, among others.\n\nRamon Ayala’s influence on modern music cannot be overstated, as most norteño groups today use their style as their musical foundation to perform their songs.\n\n> San Jose Civic Events Calendar\n\n> Visitor FAQs (Including List of Prohibited Items)\n\nYou are invited to a conversation with Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi about her new book, The Art of Power.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the most powerful woman in American political history, tells the story of her transformation from housewife to House Speaker — how she became a master legislator, a key partner to presidents, and the most visible leader of the Trump resistance.\n\nIn The Art of Power, Pelosi describes for the first time what it takes to make history — not only as the first woman to ascend to the most powerful legislative role in our nation, but to pass laws that would save lives and livelihoods, from the emergency rescue of the economy in 2008 to transforming health care. She describes the perseverance, persuasion, and respect for her members that it took to succeed, but also the joy of seeing America change for the better.\n\nAmong the best-prepared and hardest working Speakers in history, Pelosi worked to find common ground, or stand her ground, with presidents from Bush to Biden. She also shares moving moments with soldiers sent to the front lines, women who inspired her, and human rights activists who fought by her side.\n\nPelosi took positions that established her as a prophetic voice on the major moral issues of the day, warning early about the dangers of the Iraq War and of the Chinese government’s long record of misbehavior. This moral courage prepared her for the arrival of Trump, with whom she famously tangled, becoming a red-coated symbol of resistance to his destructive presidency.\n\nHere, she reveals how she went toe-to-toe with Trump, leading up to January 6, 2021, when he unleashed his post-election fury on the Congress. Pelosi gives us her personal account of that day: the assault not only on the symbol of our democracy but on the men and women who had come to serve the nation, never expecting to hide under desks or flee for their lives — and her determined efforts to get the National Guard to the Capitol.\n\nNearly two years later, violence and fury would erupt inside Pelosi’s own home when an intruder, demanding to see the Speaker, viciously attacked her beloved husband, Paul. Here, Pelosi shares that horrifying day and the traumatic aftermath for her and her family.\n\nThe woman who has been lauded by her opposition as “the most powerful Speaker” ever shows us why she is not afraid of a good fight. The Art of Power is about the fighting spirit that has always animated her, and the historic legacy that spirit has produced. Your ticket includes one copy of The Art of Power.\n\nThis event is presented by Kepler’s Literary Foundation.\n\nEVENT SECURITY NOTICE: Please note that all large backpacks, laptop bags/briefcases and luggage must be left at home.

Croce hits the road again in celebration of two more of his father Jim Croce’s legendary albums — 1973’s Life and Times and his final release, I Got A Name — in addition to songs from You Don’t Mess Around With Jim.\n\nThe Croce Plays Croce 50th Anniversary show features a legendary band (including drummer Gary Mallaber, bassist David Barard, guitar/violin James Pennebaker) and a moving multi-media presentation accompanying Jim’s songs (which, on the previous tour, included memorable hits “Operator (That’s Not the Way It Feels),” “Time in a Bottle,” and others). It was fan-demand for more, and the camaraderie that A.J. felt with the audience, the players, and the connection to his father’s timeless music that inspired A.J. to embark on the 50th Anniversary tour.\n\nDuring last year’s raved-about performances, A.J. shared intimate aspects of his dad’s career. He also drew praise for his own style and musicianship (he’s known for one of the most unique keyboard styles in music) as well as his sensitive insight into Jim Croce’s enduring musical canon. While Jim Croce’s indelible music catalog still resonates on classic radio, streaming platforms, and more recently on hit films and TV shows like Django Unchained and Stranger Things, it is A.J.s unique showmanship that has helped enliven Jim’s amazing legacy.\n\nOne reviewer aptly noted, “…A.J. Croce invites the sold-out crowds into his father’s worldview and work mindset, culminating in the playing of Jim Croce tunes… making for an intimate experience riddled with wryness and humor….”\n\nA.J. says the upcoming shows will continue to be fresh and spontaneous. “People were surprised when they came that the show wasn’t just Jim Croce’s ballads,” he says. “I think one of the things the audience will appreciate if they haven’t seen us yet, is how alive these songs sound. All the musicians have a level of improvisation that makes it a lot of fun.”\n\nThe two Jim Croce albums that turned 50 in 2023 are considered among Croce’s finest, with Life and Times, originally released in January of 1973, delivering the game-changing hit “Bad, Bad Leroy Brown,” which became the Songwriter’s Hall of Fame inductee’s calling card, hitting No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100, and ranked as the No. 2 song for all of 1973. I Got A Name was his final studio album (and the first posthumous release by Jim), with the title song being released the day after his tragic plane crash which occurred on September 20, 1973. The album also featured the smash hit ballad “I’ll Have to Say I Love You In A Song,” and “Workin’ At The Car Wash Blues,” among others.\n\nTickets are on sale as of January 19.\n\n> San Jose Civic Events Calendar\n\n> Visitor FAQs (Including List of Prohibited Items)"
