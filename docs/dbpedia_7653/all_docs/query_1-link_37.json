        "text": "Speaking to BuzzFeed in June 2015, RuPaul shared how LeBar’s humour and kindness won him over. “I remember praying, ‘I want a sweet, sensitive man,’ and I got an Australian who’s just lovely,” he added.\n\nHere’s everything we know about Georges LeBar.\n\nRuPaul met his husband at a New York nightclub\n\nThe first time LeBar, 51, and RuPaul, 63, crossed paths was in 1994, on the night of LeBar’s 21st birthday. The venue was Limelight, a legendary NYC nightclub that has since closed its doors. RuPaul recounted to ET in March 2017, “He was dancing like a crazed person. I went over and said, ‘What are you doing?’ You know, and that was that.”\n\nThe difference in their heights – according to People, LeBar is an extremely tall 200cm (6ft 7) to RuPaul’s tall 193cm tall (6ft 4) – added an extra dimension to their physical attraction. “Can I put my arms around you?” RuPaul says he asked LeBar on meeting him, per a November 2019 interview with PinkNews. “Because I’m tall, I’ve never been able to put my arms around someone’s shoulders who was taller than me.”\n\nGeorge LeBar’s career in visual arts\n\nLeBar’s twin passions – for oil painting and his husband – are united in “Sitting on a Secret”, a collection of four paintings showing RuPaul in bold drag attire.\n\nMeanwhile, the artist’s 64-strong collection “Six Inches Away” depicts feminine figures at home, and outdoors in both rural and urban settings. LeBar has also published a book, Pillowtalk, in which he blends painting and poetry.\n\nRuPaul and LeBar wed on their 23rd anniversary of meeting\n\nIn January 2017, on their 23rd anniversary of meeting – and LeBar’s birthday – RuPaul and his beau exchanged vows in a low-key ceremony at their California home.\n\nGeorges LeBar owns a ranch in Wyoming\n\nPer People, RuPaul and his husband divide their time between their mansion in Beverly Hills and LeBar’s 24,300-hectare ranch in Wyoming. According to The Guardian, LeBar inherited the property from his grandfather, who ran a sheep and cattle operation with his wife for decades there.\n\nRuPaul and LeBar have an open marriage\n\nRuPaul and LeBar have always had an open relationship – something the drag superstar has been very candid about in interviews. “It’s just realistic,” RuPaul told The New Yorker in March, before adding controversially, “There’s no such thing as monogamy with men.”"
