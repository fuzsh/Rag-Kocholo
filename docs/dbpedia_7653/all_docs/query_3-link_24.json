        "text": "Carey Hart was born on July 17, 1975 in Seal Beach, California and grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nHart is one of the most recognized names in all of freestyle Motocross. His father bought him his first motocross bike when he was only four years old in hopes of spending some quality time with his son. However, what had originally started as a father and son pastime quickly turned into Carey's passion. By the time he entered his first local race as an amateur, he was hooked and by high school graduation, he was a professional Motocross rider, racing AMA Supercross circuit.\n\nSoon thereafter, Carey grew bored with Supercross and started riding with a group of guys who were interested in a more creative and expressive form of Motocross. In 1998, the Freestyle motocross movement was born with Carey leading the way. From the sport's inception, Carey has been one of the most innovative riders in the sport.\n\nHe is the inventor of the 'Hart Attack', and at the 2000 Gravity Games Carey etched his name in the record books as the first rider ever to complete a back flip on a 250cc motorcycle. The back flip\n\nHart also has his own film directed by Jonny Vegas \"Good times with Carey Hart\" The film tells the true life story of Hart's amazing career and how he accomplished the unimaginable back flip, and how he elevated his sport like few in history have!\n\nCarey has travelled the globe on a quest to put freestyle Motocross on the map. Along the way he has jumped the trailer park in Kid Rock's video \"Bawitdaba\" and saw his dream to play bass with the band Pennywise come true on the 2000 Australian Warped Tour and appeared in P!nks 'Just Like A Pill' and 'So What' videos. His popularity has helped increase exposure for the sport of Motocross.\n\nHe has been featured in nationwide ad campaigns for Ford, Dunkin Dougnuts, Fox, DVS and Mountain Dew as well as in such print publications as Paper Magazine, Teen People, EXPN The Magazine, Rolling Stone, Prick, Skinnie and has graced the covers of numerous Motocross & tattoo magazines.\n\nCarey has also starred on Inked, MTVs Life Of Ryan, The Late Show with David Letterman acatapulted Carey, and Freestyle Motocross as a whole, to an entirely new level. The stunt got the world's attention; it was even featured on Ripley's Believe It or Not He has starred in ESPN/Touchstone Pictures' IMAX film, Ultimate X and has cameo appearances in Columbia Pictures' XXX and Touchstone Pictures' Charlie's Angels II & Carey was cast in the VH1 reality show The Surreal Life.\n\nIn 2004 Carey's passion for tattoos turned into a business venture. Teaming up with fellow entrepreneur, John Huntington, Hart & Huntington Tattoo Company opened their doors in the prestigious Palms Casino, Las Vegas. This move lead to another TV opportunity for Carey when the A&E network decided to follow him and the workings of the shop in their own reality show: Inked.\n\nSince then, Hart has taken over 100% of the company as seen on Inked. Three more Hart and Huntington Tattoo shops have opened: Honolulu, Cabo San Lucas and Orlando at Universal Citywalk. Carey also expanded into making a quality clothing line based on the designs of the talented artists that work at Hart and Huntington Tattoo Company.\n\nEven with all of Carey's business ventures, he still finds time to dedicate to his first passion supermoto, Hart & Huntington Tattoo/Rockstar Supermoto Team. There is no denying Carey's dedication and passion. He has suffered his share of injuries attempting new tricks, Carey has broken over 63 bones in his body however like a cat with nine lives, he continues to bounce back and he does it all in the name of progression.\n\nOnce and forever a Brady! Christopher Knight met life as a child actor, starring as \"Peter Brady\" in the TV classic hit show Drei Mädchen und drei Jungen (1969). A reluctant icon, Christopher has focused his adult years on interests beyond the entertainment industry, particularly the corporate world of computers and high technology.\n\nChristopher Anton Knight was born November 7, 1957 in Manhattan, New York, the second of four children of Wilma (Stern) and actor Edward Knight (born Edward Kozumplik), who had three boys and one girl. Around the time he was three, his family moved to Los Angeles, where his father later began seeking auditions for his two oldest sons as a means of saving money for their college education. Although both Christopher and his older brother Mark tried out, only Christopher was offered parts.\n\nAt the young age of seven, he began landing appearances in commercials for companies such as Toyota, Tide, and Cheerios and in television shows such as Rauchende Colts (1955) and Mannix (1967). Soon, however, he found himself involved with what would become one of the most successful television shows of all time. Partially because his dark looks matched that of Robert Reed who was already cast as the show's father, Christopher won the part of the middle brother, \"Peter Brady\", in Drei Mädchen und drei Jungen (1969). Airing from September 1969 through August 1974, the show was highly popular with teenagers of that era. Although ending thirty years ago, it acquired instant syndication and has never since left the airways.\n\nBeing a reluctant icon as well as having an innate interest in science and machines led Christopher to his new career in the computer industry in 1988. Constant celebrity status from youth has provided him with people skills and has proven to be excellent preparation for life in sales and marketing. Entering the industry as an account sales manager at Martec, Inc., he logged the company's first $1 million sales order within his first eighteen months, quickly becoming Martec's top performer, and employee of the year.\n\nIn October 1989, Christopher took the responsibility of Vice President of Design System Marketing and Sales at New Image Industry, moving the company into 3D rendering/imaging technologies. Then in mid 1991, he, and a few other key employees successfully moved the software engineering staff and the 3D technologies into a new privately held company, Visual Software. As co-founder of Visual Software, Christopher was a pioneer in the consumer 3D graphics market. His efforts were responsible for enormous sales growth, moving the company from $.4 million annual sales to $4.2 million within 10 months. Visual Software was acquired by Micrografx in January.\n\nIn late 1995, Christopher partnered with friend and associate Frank Paniagua, and founded Kidwise Learningware. This company proposed to design, produce and publish interactive edutainment products for children. Christopher served as Executive Producer, with duties ranging from production and design, projects management and sales strategy.\n\nIn February of 1996, he took on the responsibility of Vice President of Sales at Adesso, a Keyboard manufacturer, providing keyboards for Macintosh and PC/Win95 systems, where he oversaw a doubling of sales within his first four months.\n\nHe and Mr. Paniagua reunited again in August of 1997 at Integrated Micro Solutions (I.M.S.) which later became IXMICRO. Initially hired in the capacity of Vice President of Strategic Marketing, Christopher was promoted to Vice President of Marketing after only four months. With Mr. Paniagua, he was able to influence annual sales from less than $2 million in early 1997 to $63 million in 1998.\n\nIn late 1998, Christopher would again team up with Paniagua and another associate, David Smith, to form Eskape Labs. Knight, Smith and Paniagua had all been part of IXMICRO's executive staff when the company decided to concentrate on a path divergent from the common interests of the three. Sensing a shift in the focus of the computer technology industry beyond the personal computer to intelligent devices, Eskape Labs was born. The company's mission, to provide \"on wire\" digital appliances that easily plug into computers, has led Eskape to develop a number of first-to-market video devices. Eskape Labs was purchased by Hauppauge Computer Works in the summer of 2000. Hauppauge is the world's largest manufacturer of computer-based TV tuner products and, with Eskape Labs, now has a line of TV tuners compatible with the Macintosh.\n\nChristopher continued to work for Hauppauge Computer as the head of the Eskape Labs brand until the spring of 2003, and then as a consultant to the company throughout the remainder of the year.\n\nMid-year 2003, he became more involved on an executive level with an investment that had taken flight and was in need of interim management. Casting Networks Inc. (doing business as LA Casting and SF Casting) is an online (web based) talent exchange. Nine months from the introduction of the service to the Los Angeles commercial casting marketplace in late 2002, LA Casting had completely revolutionized the casting process by replacing archaic and time-consuming methods of handling clients' information with a much more efficient method using the Internet.\n\nWhile Christopher's career in the high tech industry has prevented much involvement in entertainment, it did not constitute a full retirement from show business; he has starred or otherwise participated in the abundance of Brady films, television movies, series, gatherings, discussions and retrospectives. Christopher also has utilized his celebrity status by serving as host and/or spokesperson for several projects. In 2003, he was asked to host a segment on the Travel Channel series' TV Road Trip (2003), starring the late John Ritter. When the series was optioned for a second cycle, Christopher was offered to \"Host\" the series. It was, in fact, this participation that lead to the rekindling of Christopher's interest in front and behind the camera.\n\nChristopher was soon signed up for the celebrity version of Discovery Health Channel's \"Body Challenge\", which debuted in the fall of 2004 and led to his participation on VH1's The Surreal Life (2003). The explosion of popularity and \"new found fame\" as a result of this #1 VH1 Hit that has also lead to his high-profile romance with The Surreal Life (2003) co-star and America's Next Top Model (2003) winner, Adrianne Curry, placed Knight back in the spotlight. Grateful at this unique second opportunity at an acting career, Christopher relished the chance at experiencing celebrity as a seasoned, experienced, \"well-baked\" adult. In 2005, his on-screen endeavors included special guest appearances on shows such as WB's Blue Collar TV (2004) and ABC's Office Girl (2002). He also starred as the lead in the independent film, Light Years Away (2008), co-starring Eric Roberts. He then worked on several projects with his then-wife, model and TV personality Adrianne Curry.\n\n2004 marked the fourth consecutive year that he has been the spokesperson for the American Counseling Association's \"Healthy Skin, Healthy Outlook\" campaign, which has received the Gold Triangle Award recognizing excellence in public education of dermatology issues the past two years. In 2002-2003, Christopher also was privileged to be the spokesperson for the National Consumer League's \"AD/HD Campaign to Inform the Nation,\" speaking in Washington D.C. at the National Press Club on the sensitive subject of AD/HD (Christopher himself was diagnosed with lifelong ADD at the age of 40). The campaign's laudable goal is to broadcast the truth about AD/HD, dispelling myths and tearing down the barriers of ignorance and stigma that prevent AD/HD sufferers from obtaining the proper diagnoses and medical treatments they need. He was also brought on as the spokesman for a popular personal fitness product, Ab Lounge XL®.\n\nCognizant of his celebrity status and seasoned by maturity, Christopher is ready and eager to return more fully to the industry that gave him his start and to expand his public identity, but his plan to re-establish his place in the entertainment industry is not designed to displace his interests in the corporate world.\n\nActor Todd Bridges has seen and done it all. Todd has lived and worked amongst some of the most famous and influential individuals in the world. For over twenty-five years, he has victoriously survived a rapidly changing business. He experienced his second rise to fame, as \"Juice\" on Schatten der Leidenschaft (1973). Todd's career began and rocketed when he was only six years of age, forcing his family to relocate from a quiet, friendly neighborhood in San Francisco to the fast-paced stardom of Los Angeles, California in the early 70s. His mother, actress Betty A. Bridges, and father, the late James Bridges, Sr., came to Hollywood in search of the American dream. Betty went on to work quite a bit as an actress while James Sr. became one of the first prominent black Hollywood agents. Betty later became one of Hollywood's greatest managers and acting coaches, whose list of clients (soon to become stars) included her oldest child, Jimmy Bridges, her daughter Verda Bridges, Todd (of course), Nia Long (Der Prinz von Bel-Air (1990), Love Jones (1997)), Regina King (Jerry Maguire: Spiel des Lebens (1996)), Lamont Bentley (Moesha (1996)), and Aaron Meeks (Soul Food (2000)).\n\nIt all began one day while watching Redd Foxx display his comic genius on Sanford and Son (1972). Todd, then six, realized his dream of becoming an actor. He exclaimed excitedly to his mother, \"I want to do that\", pointing to the television set. He had asked on his own to enter a business which, during that time, was very limited for black artists. Nevertheless, Todd went on to make some remarkable strides in the industry, pioneering the way for other young, black actors. His first job was a Jell-O commercial, which starred the entire Bridges family. He later accomplished over 60 national commercials. Todd was the first black child actor to become a recurring regular on the hit series, Die Waltons (1972), and Unsere kleine Farm (1974) with the late great Michael Landon. He went on to guest star on Barney Miller (1975), which eventually gained a spin-off show, starring Abe Vigoda. The spin-off was titled Fish (1977) and Todd became a series regular for four years. Norman Lear, who spearheaded the success of Tandem Productions, with such shows under his belt as Die Jeffersons (1975), Good Times (1974), Es bleibt in der Familie (1971) and The Facts of Life (1979), sought to create a new type of show that would cross the racial boundaries set in Hollywood in the early years of television. He began with the new kid in town, Gary Coleman, and a TV veteran, Conrad Bain, from the hit show, Maude (1972). The wheels were spinning and Noch Fragen Arnold? (1978) was born. The show originated with a wealthy white businessman who adopted his housekeeper's black child after she passed away. There was only one problem. Who would the creators find to match wits with the sassy Gary Coleman? Conrad Bain then suggested the creation of an older brother character to keep up with \"Arnold's\" wisecracks, a strong young actor capable of bouncing the ball back in his court. No one portrayed such qualities as Todd Bridges.\n\nNoch Fragen Arnold? (1978) was introduced to American audience in the fall of 1978. With the new concept of a racially-mixed cast, the producers and creators were unsure how the viewers would react. To their surprise, the show was a complete success and ran strong for eight years. Todd Bridges became an international celebrity and household name by the age of 15. During his success with \"Diff'rent Strokes\", Todd guest starred on such shows as Love Boat (1977), The Facts of Life (1979), Hello, Larry (1979), Battle of the Network Stars VI (1979), Circus of the Stars #6 (1981), and many, many more. An even bigger opportunity came when he was chosen to portray the role of Chicken George's grandson in the historical television miniseries, Roots: The Complete Miniseries (1977), where his performance is still applauded to this day.\n\nAfter \"Diff'rent Strokes\" ended its long run in 1986, things became difficult for Todd. All of a sudden, no one would hire him due to his being typecast as \"Willis Drummond\". He began to experience turbulent times, which would later lead to drug addiction and trouble with the authorities. There would be a pause in his career and his life for nearly ten years.\n\nTodd Bridges has been clean and sober for twenty-six years. He is a working actor, director, and producer and is well on his way to the rebirth of a promising television and motion picture career. Together, Todd and his brother, James Jr., have partnered to establish their own production company, \"Little Bridge Productions\".\n\nHis recent film credits (as an actor) include _1210 Camille Street_ with Faizon Love (Friday (1995), Helden aus der zweiten Reihe (2000)), Frat (), _Hollywood Horror (2000)_ with Tia Mowry and 'Tamara Mowry' (_\"Sister Sister\" (1994)_) and A Testimony. He also recently completed a feature film in Utah called Der Aufstieg - The Climb (2002) for Billy Graham's production company. He directed, produced and starred in the short film about his life, Building Bridges (2000), for TBN. He also directed, along with his brother, a full-length feature film titled Black Ball (2003) (aka Full Circle), starring Lisa Sweat (wife of R&B singer Keith Sweat), Stoney Jackson, De'aundre Bonds, his wife Dori Bridges, and a host of other great names. His directorial credits also include the feature film, Flossin (2001), the life story of his pastor and childhood friend, Pastor Ernest Johnson. On a more personal note, Todd is a proud husband and father. He has been married, since 1998, to his wife, Dori Bridges, and they have one son, Spencir Bridges and one daughter, Bo J. Bridges Todd has traveled the nation speaking to over 6,000 kids per day in high schools, middle schools, and churches warning about the dangers of drug use, negative peer pressure, and proclaiming Christ Jesus!\n\nWithout a doubt Gary Coleman was THE child TV star of the late 1970s and early 1980s. A refreshingly confident little tyke with sparkling dark, saucer-like eyes and an ingratiating, take-on-anyone burst of personality, the boy charmed the pants right off of TV viewers the minute he was glimpsed in national commercials. Amazed by how mature he came across, Gary was in truth older than he looked, which was brought upon by a congenital kidney condition. Sadly, the pint-sized phenomena outgrew his chubby-cheeked welcome and found the course of his grown-up Hollywood career brutally rough and patchy. The fragile condition of his health coupled with this lack of adult career acceptance, sparked an aggressively defensive behavior mechanism in his adult years and led to great personal unhappiness, chronic legal/financial hassles and early death.\n\nHe was born Gary Wayne Coleman on February 8, 1968, to a homeless woman, and was adopted by a fork-lift operator and his nurse practitioner wife from a Chicago hospital when he was just a few days old. Raised in Zion, Illinois, it was discovered that little Gary had severe health issues before the age of 2. Born with one atrophied kidney and an endangering weak second one, he had two kidney transplants by the time he reached age 16 and the effects of his dialysis medication permanently stunted his growth (to 4'8\").\n\nA highly precocious comedy cut-up on-camera, Gary proved a natural in local Chicago commercials. As his commercials spread nationwide, audiences began wondering just who this diminutive dynamo was. Norman Lear's talent scout spotted him in a Chicago bank commercial (he was 9 at the time) and decided to reveal to the world who the little guy was. Brought in to brighten up such Lear sitcoms as \"The Jeffersons\" and \"Good Times\" (the latter as a friend of little Janet Jackson's character), NBC quickly recognized the boy's comedy prowess and handed the 10-year-old his own prime-time sitcom playground to mug in.\n\nWhile Noch Fragen Arnold? (1978)'s underlying approach was to preach racial and social tolerance (it revolved around two lower-class African-American brothers from Harlem who are taken in and adopted by a wealthy, debonair Park Avenue white man after their housekeeper mother dies), the show's powers-that-be smartly deduced that it was the wisecracking gifts of young Coleman, who played the youngest brother, Arnold Jackson, that gave the show its spark. Deemed \"NBC's Littlest Big Man,\" Gary's sly, pouting-lipped delivery of, \"What'chu talkin' about, Willis?\" soon became a popular American catchphrase.\n\nLegendary comics such as Bob Hope and Lucille Ball absolutely gushed about the little boy's comedy genius and Gary soon became a hit on the talk show circuit, trading clever banter with the likes of Johnny Carson among others. The boy was also outfitted with a series of lightweight TV-movie showcases which included The Kid from Left Field (1979), Scout's Honor (1980), The Kid with the Broken Halo (1982), Das kleine Superhirn (1983), The Fantastic World of D.C. Collins (1984) and Playing with Fire (1985). All of them wisely centered around Gary's adorable persona. Modest film comedies also came his way with Der Millionen-Dollar-Junge (1981) and Jimmy the Kid (1982). Topping it all off, the Hanna-Barbera-produced series The Gary Coleman Show (1982) produced an animated version of the child star. Little Gary would make close to $18 million during his nearly decade-long TV reign.\n\nLike many others in his shoes, however, the aging Coleman felt trapped and pigeonholed by his stifling juvenile image and begged to get out from under it. The 18-year-old was truly thankful when the series ended in 1986. Coleman found, however, that a very fickle public was not as receptive to seeing him grow up. Like fellow TV star Emmanuel Lewis, Coleman began aging in appearance but remained trapped in the body of a young boy and the contrast proved too strange for audiences. As a result, Hollywood had little resources as to what to do with Gary Coleman the man. It wasn't long before Coleman was reduced to making weird guest appearances and small parts in even smaller films.\n\nThis crash course in reality triggered an increasingly erratic and aggressive behavior in Gary Coleman as he became increasingly angry and bitter about his lack of work when he was so used to be on top of everything. The subsequent tragedies suffered by all three young stars from the \"Diff'rent Strokes\" show, in fact, was sold out as a jinx package known as the \"Diff'rent Strokes curse\". While distaff co-star Dana Plato fell heavily into drug addiction, petty crime and pornography before taking her own life in 1999, Todd Bridges, who played Coleman's older brother, battled major cocaine abuse and was later charged (but acquitted of) attempted murder in the late 1980s.\n\nIn addition to his life-long health issues, Gary's adult problems came in the form of scattered financial and legal entanglements, as well as scrapes with the law. He was once arrested in 1999 for punching a persistent female autograph fan, in which he was fined and ordered to take anger-management classes. This became tabloid fodder for late night comics who joked that he must have landed \"several good uppercuts.\" He also had many disorderly conduct and reckless driving charges brought up against him at various times. He would admit that the tally of his life problems led to more than a few feigned suicide attempts. In 1989, Coleman successfully sued his adopted parents and business manager after they allegedly pilfered his youthful fortune for their own self interest totaling $3.8 million in losses, and he won $1,280,000. Despite the large settlement, all of the money was soon spent on taxes, legal fees, as well as his increasingly high medical bills for his continuing dialysis treatments. As a result by 1999 (with no steady acting work) Coleman had to declare bankruptcy, finding work outside the Hollywood industry as a security guard. For self-preservation, he went the reality-show route and became the object of self-mocking cameos to help bring in some cash. As a gag, he ran for California's 2003 governorship during its recall election.\n\nIn 2007, he married the much younger actress Shannon Price, whom he met on the set of the low budget film Church Ball (2006), but the quickly marriage dissolved quickly into domestic squabbles that put him in front of the court system yet again on domestic abuse charges. He later moved and settled in Utah.\n\nIn early 2009, Coleman managed to star in his very last film, the crude independent comedy Midgets vs. Mascots (2009) filmed in Dallas, Texas before the end came. Following heart surgery complicated by pneumonia in the fall of 2009, he suffered a heart seizure in February 2010 while performing on a Hollywood set. The 42-year-old actor died of a brain hemorrhage on May 28, 2010, after suffering an epidural haematoma from a fall at home. A sad end to a very bright and talented, but very troubled and bitter, child star who, at his peak, brought such joy to TV audiences."
