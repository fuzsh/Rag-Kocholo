        "text": "Hosted by Pickle, Drag Queen Story Hour is taking place from 10:30am - 11:30am every Saturday during Pride Month at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. Pickle will be joined by fellow drag artists for readings of The Hips on the Drag Queen Go Swish, Swish, Swish by Lil Miss Hot Mess; Feminist Baby by Loryn Brantz; and It's Okay to Be Different by Todd Parr. The free program is available first-come, first-served.\n\nOn Sunday, June 23, Rooftop Cinema Club presents To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar. Starring Wesley Snipes, Patrick Swayze and John Leguizamo, To Wong Foo tells the story of three New York drag queens on their way to Hollywood who get stranded in a small Midwestern town when their car breaks down. While waiting for parts, the trio shows the local homophobic rednecks that appearing different doesn’t mean they don’t have humanity in common. Before the movie, enjoy a live drag show by Drag Me to the Movies!\n\nIf nightclubs aren't your jam, Hamburger Mary’s weekly Legendary Bingo is a fun evening with friends for dinner and cocktails. Hosted by a rotating cast of drag queens and surprise celebrity ball-callers, you never know who’s going to show up, but you’ll never be disappointed. Your $20 suggested donation benefits a different local charity every game, and gets you nine rounds of bingo and a bonus round with chances to win some FABULOUS prizes. There's also an auction during intermission.\n\nTuesdays and Wednesdays at 7pm. Pro Tip: Reservations highly suggested! Reserve your table through the Hamburger Mary’s Yelp page.\n\nOne of the most exciting, unpredictable nights of drag in L.A., EXPOSURE presents themed shows at The Offbeat, featuring an expansive lineup of new and veteran performers. It's a fun, chill space with shockingly inexpensive drinks, and the taco truck parked outside is always a welcome find. Mondays at 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. $5 cover, 21+.\n\nPro Tip: Plan to carpool with a designated driver, or share a Lyft with friends, as parking can be challenging around York Boulevard.\n\nFrom its humble beginnings as a simple coffee shop, everyone is welcome at The Abbey, now known as the “Best Gay Bar in the World,” subsequently earning the L.A. icon its own reality show. Why not celebrate with a Drag Brunch? Hosted by a rotating cast of drag queens, Brunch Service starts every Saturday at noon and includes an amazing cast that performs throughout the beautiful venue. The menu is chock full of traditional brunch offerings and salads, boasting a bar selection that includes a tasty Bloody Mary. Hit the gym later and stay for dessert, the pies are not to be missed."
