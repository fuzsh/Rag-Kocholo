        "text": "RuPaul has become a genuine mogul. Who else has amassed true cultural capital? Who can bring home north of $1 million annually, or get cast in a Hollywood blockbuster? Here, after talking to talent agents, managers and club bookers, as well as studying social-media influence, career longevity, and each queen’s “charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent,” we rank America’s top-100 Drag Race superstars.\n\nReporters and judges: Mano Agapion, Rebecca Alter, Joel Kim Booster, Maria Elena Fernandez, Molly Fitzpatrick, Chris Heller, E. Alex Jung, Charlotte Klein, Genevieve Koski, Brian Moylan, Matthew Schneier, Matthew Silver, and Carl Swanson\n\nThe Top 2O\n\n1. Bianca Del Rio\n\nAge: 43\n\nFrom: New York, NY\n\nDrag Race: Season 6 winner\n\nThe queen of all Drag Race queens and the most successful alum, Bianca appeared on the show five years ago (and was so dominant that she reached the finale without having to lip-sync for her life). Since then, the insult comic, self-proclaimed “Clown in a Gown,” and first Latinx Drag Race winner has created a level of global drag stardom not seen since, well, Mama Ru herself. She’ll be performing at the U.K.’s 12,500-seat Wembley Arena* for her “It’s Jester Joke” tour (which she’ll take to Carnegie Hall this fall), has nearly 2 million Instagram followers, is currently starring in the West End musical Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, made two Hurricane Bianca movies and a Logo comedy special, and landed a Starbucks ad with Adore. Her book, Blame It on Bianca Del Rio: The Expert on Nothing With an Opinion on Everything, came out last year along with her coconut-oil-based makeup remover.\n\n2. Shangela Laquifa Wadley\n\nAge: 37\n\nFrom: Studio City, CA\n\nDrag Race: Season 2 twelfth place; season 3 sixth place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 3 third/fourth place\n\nHalleloo! In the past year alone, Shangela, who never won Drag Race (mitigating fact: She’d done drag for only five months prior), toured 184 cities, made a big splash in A Star Is Born, and hosted the GLAAD Awards (earning a standing ovation from Beyoncé). She also guest-starred on Community and Glee, shilled for McDonald’s and Orbitz, collaborated with Ariana Grande on her song “NASA,” and is working on a deal to stream her “Shangela Is Shook” tour as a comedy special. Oh, and her podcast, Shangela, dropped last month. In other words, she’s a queen with the mind of a mogul: In 2014, she started Say What Entertainment, a management company for drag performers. And she persists. “My grandfather was a farmer in Paris, Texas,” she has said. “My mom’s a military veteran. I come from a family of workers. I think of my legacy as what I continue to do every day, which is go to work.”\n\n3. Courtney Act\n\nAge: 37\n\nFrom: West Hollywood, CA\n\nDrag Race: Season 6 runner-up\n\nWhat’s remarkable about Courtney’s career is that she now exists almost completely outside the Drag Race machinery. Other than her successful wig line, Wigs by Vanity, little of what she does has anything to do with drag, or with America. In 2017, she was on MTV U.K.’s celebrity dating show Single AF, which she parlayed into an appearance on Celebrity Big Brother U.K. She also hosted The Bi Life, a bisexual dating show, on E! in the U.K. Courtney was the runner-up on the most recent season of Dancing With the Stars Australia, where she danced in drag with a male professional partner, the show’s first same-sex pairing in that country. She has even filmed some scenes for the famous Aussie soap opera Neighbours, which has made stars out of Kylie Minogue, Russell Crowe, and Liam Hemsworth.\n\n4. Trixie Mattel\n\nAge: 29\n\nFrom: Milwaukee, WI\n\nDrag Race: Season 7 sixth place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 3 winner.\n\nHow did this self-identified “Skinny Legend” take a sixth-place finish on Drag Race and turn it into a successful career? Social media, touring, and a now-famous YouTube show produced by World of Wonder called UNHhhh, which she hosts with fellow season-seven also-ran Katya. This was spun off by Viceland into The Trixie & Katya Show, which lasted one season. After winning All Stars 3, she launched an international tour to support her country albums, Two Birds and One Stone (both of which charted). Meanwhile, her fan-favorite merch exploits her bubblegum-pink McDonald’s Happy Meal–toy aesthetic, and she just launched a makeup line.\n\n“I didn’t have a great time on Drag Race my first season. My look, the Barbie thing I do, went against the algorithm a bit. But I was happy to be the sleeper agent. I moved to L.A. and was on Twitter and Instagram three times a day. When you’re on Drag Race, you have borrowed fans. Your job is to invite them to become fans of you as your own independent thing. I was always touring. By the time I went on All Stars, I was fully booked — I probably canceled about $40,000 in gigs to do the show. So when I won, I really just won back the money I spent to do it.” —Trixie Mattel\n\n5. Alyssa Edwards\n\nAge: 39\n\nFrom: Mesquite, TX\n\nDrag Race: Season 5 sixth place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 2 fifth place.\n\nThis walking meme factory was never particularly good at Drag Race, but she is beloved for her signature tongue pop, huge wigs, energetic dance moves, and system of vocabulary that doesn’t always make sense. Alongside her arduous touring schedule, Alyssa teamed with World of Wonder on the long-running web series Alyssa’s Secret and the Netflix show Dancing Queen, about the dance studio she runs in Mesquite, Texas. She has an outsize influence not just on drag and its vernacular but on Drag Race in particular. Alyssa’s drag daughters from the Haus of Edwards often end up on the program themselves.\n\n6. Adore Delano\n\nAge: 29\n\nFrom: Azusa, CA\n\nDrag Race: Season 6 runner-up.\n\nAll Stars: Season 2 ninth place.\n\nOne of the youngest queens on her season, Adore has always been a big hit with the teens. She was the first drag queen to reach 1 million Instagram followers (now closer to 2 million), and she has used social media to support and promote her three studio albums and some slick music videos. The rock-and-roll princess is overseas for most of 2019, touring in Australia and Europe. Much of Adore’s recent career, however, has been overshadowed by a lawsuit she filed against Producer Entertainment Group, a firm that manages many stars after their appearances on Drag Race.\n\n7. Alaska Thunderfuck\n\nAge: 34\n\nFrom: Pittsburgh, PA\n\nDrag Race: Season 5 runner-up.\n\nAll Stars: Season 2 winner.\n\nAfter a bit of pouting and brinkmanship ended her triumphant turn on All Stars 2, some fans labeled Alaska a snake, but she’s slithering all the way to the bank. Aside from an appearance on VH1’s reality show Scared Famous, Alaska has focused on touring. She has also released a string of comedic, self-referential dance-music albums: 2015’s Anus, 2016’s Poundcake, and 2019’s Vagina. She also makes Race Chaser, a Drag Race recap podcast on which she and Willam Belli lovingly make fun of the reality show that launched them to stardom.\n\n“Sharknado came out of nowhere. I got to fly out to Romania and shoot this fucking outdoor sword-fighting scene in a fake castle. They just called my manager and said, ‘Hey, what’s Alaska doing? Does she want to fight some sharks, or what?’ The great thing about drag is you really are allowed to apply it to anything.” —Alaska\n\n8. Bob the Drag Queen\n\nAge: 32\n\nFrom: Queens, NY\n\nDrag Race: Season 8 winner\n\nTo put it in her own words, Bob is a queen for the people. Since getting into drag after watching season one of Drag Race and competing on season eight, she has built an Instagram following of 1.1 million, thanks to her winning comedic sensibility. Bob also has a burgeoning career as an actor with credits in Rough Night, High Maintenance, and Netflix’s Tales of the City as well as Berkeley Rep’s Angels in America revival. Her podcast with Monét X Change, Sibling Rivalry, frequently puts on packed live shows. Next up: a drag take on Lady Macbeth.\n\n9. Willam Belli\n\nAge: 36\n\nFrom: Los Angeles, CA\n\nDrag Race: Season 4 seventh place\n\nThe first, and so far only, contestant to be disqualified from Drag Race, this self-declared “mattress” (model-actress) and YouTube super-queen lives by two mottos: “If you’ve got the dough, I’ve got a show” and “If you’ve got a check, I’ve got a talent.” Her sharp-tongued wit has carried her far, whether on her many viral videos or on the set of A Star Is Born, where Bradley Cooper gave her the go-ahead to improvise. She has sold over 40,000 copies of her self-help memoir, Suck Less: Where There’s a Willam, There’s a Way, while Race Chaser, the podcast she hosts with Alaska, gets over 100,000 downloads a week.\n\n“Patreon’s changed my life. Every video I make, I put on Patreon first. These are big enough fans that they’d pay a dollar or two dollars a month to interact with me. I find that concentrating on people that love you, like the fans who actually want to tip you, is better than focusing on haters.” —Willam Belli\n\n10. Latrice Royale\n\nAge: 47\n\nFrom: South Beach, FL\n\nDrag Race: Season 4 fourth place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 1 seventh/eighth place; season 4 fifth place.\n\nOne of only three queens to be on Drag Race three times, this inspirational fan favorite has worked pretty much constantly since first appearing on the show, including multiple international tours with Werq the World and Haters Roast. While everyone gags for Latrice’s lip-sync numbers and flag twirling, many don’t know that she’s a force behind the scenes as well. She now serves as a manager for other queens’ careers; current clients include Kennedy Davenport, Alexis Mateo, and, of course, herself.\n\n“I sure remember my payment for my first gig. Two drink tickets! For two numbers! You’d get your drinks before the show. You do two numbers and spend all your tips back on more drinks, so it really does wind up costing you money to work. Today, oh my God. The blowup is severely real. We’re going house shopping soon! People don’t realize that Drag Race is not the goal. The goal is, once you get on there, what are you gonna do after? We all get different gigs. A lot of girls make the mistake of doing quick-money gigs. That’s not my style. I’m looking at the long run.” —Latrice Royale\n\n11. Aquaria\n\nAge: 23\n\nFrom: Brooklyn, NY\n\nDrag Race: Season 10 winner\n\nThe first reigning Gen-Z queen entered the Drag Race orbit with the bona fides of a performer well beyond her years after coming up through the NYC club circuit under the wings of nightlife legends Susanne Bartsch and Amanda Lepore. Since her win, Aquaria has launched herself into the fashion world: She had a spread in Vogue Italia and was a face of the M.A.C Viva Glam campaign and Jeremy Scott’s Moschino x H&M collaboration. She even made an appearance at this year’s Met Gala alongside Violet Chachki and RuPaul. All this and she’s only 23.\n\n12. Sasha Velour\n\nAge: 31\n\nFrom: Brooklyn, NY\n\nDrag Race: Season 9 winner\n\nSasha changed the Drag Race game with her legendary rose-petal reveal to Whitney Houston’s “So Emotional” and then invested her winnings in Nightgowns, the monthly drag show she has produced since 2015. It’s a far cry from the type of drag RuPaul has popularized: fewer death drops and tongue pops and more performance-art-inflected multimedia gender experimentation, a more fringe-y approach encapsulated in Sasha’s iconic performance lip-syncing as a feminized version of Gollum to Kate Bush’s “Wuthering Heights.” She has also continued to expand her art-queen aesthetic, curating a 2018 New York Fashion Week presentation and even creating a Google Doodle in 2017 for Marlene Dietrich’s birthday. Her new solo theatrical show, Smoke & Mirrors, should expose a wider audience to Sasha’s unique amalgam of drag, art, and activism.\n\n“There is extreme inequality in pay among drag performers. The TV show has turned us into celebrities. I became part of the economics of that, adjusting your drag to fit the expectations of the system. So last year I decided to stop working with the producers of Drag Race for touring and bar productions. Now I feel most comfortable performing when I’m the producer as well. I get a say in how the other performers are treated and compensated, how the bathrooms are labeled, how the meet and greet is run — all the details of manning a creative queer space. A lot of my productions have been done with sponsorships with Lyft or M.A.C Cosmetics, because they can provide the capital to make these things possible.” —Sasha Velour\n\n13. Katya Zamolodchikova\n\nAge: 37\n\nFrom: Boston, MA\n\nDrag Race: Season 7 fifth place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 2 runner-up.\n\nDon’t worry, everyone, Katya is doing fine and is currently on tour with her not at all ironically titled one-woman show, Help Me, I’m Dying. It makes no mention of the psychotic break she experienced in 2018 while filming the end of the first season of her Viceland series, The Trixie & Katya Show. She and Trixie have since made up and have even revitalized their World of Wonder web series, UNHhhh.\n\n14. Detox\n\nAge: 33\n\nFrom: Los Angeles, CA\n\nDrag Race: Season 5 fourth place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 2 runner-up.\n\nDetox solidified her legendary Drag Race status by making it to the top four in both season five and All Stars 2, and her neon, Mugler-inspired fashion permanently raised the bar on what passed for a winning runway look. She continues to make bank on global tours like Werq the World and has shown off her famous plastic surgery on the reality series Botched. In 2017, Detox sued her management at PEG for punitive damages and unpaid royalties; she riffed on the matter in her music video “#SueList.”\n\n15. Trinity The Tuck\n\nAge: 33\n\nFrom: Orlando, FL\n\nDrag Race: Season 9 third/fourth place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 4 co-winner.\n\nThe rare queen who can blend the poise and glitz of a pageant girl with the wit and originality of a comedy queen, Trinity has been an outlier since she came in fourth on season nine of Drag Race. But things haven’t slowed down since she was cast on the show, as she has been touring exhaustively since then. After DragCon, she won’t return home for 45 days while she’s out supporting her debut album, Plastic. Before, she struggled to pay rent; now she’s just bought her first house.\n\n16. Violet Chachki\n\nAge: 26\n\nFrom: Atlanta, GA\n\nDrag Race: Season 7 winner\n\nSome fans dismissed her as a looks queen, but Violet’s confidence has paid off. She currently has 1.5 million Instagram followers, making her one of the most popular queens on the platform. Her EP, Gagged, made it to the Top 20 on the U.S. “Heatseekers” and “Dance/Electronic” charts in 2015. She also broke new ground in 2017 when she became the first drag queen to model women’s lingerie in a major campaign for U.K. brand Playful Promises. In 2018, she walked the runway to close out Jeremy Scott’s Moschino fall 2018 show at Milan Fashion Week, and later that year she starred in a Prada campaign alongside Sarah Paulson. At the 2019 Met Gala, along with Aquaria, Violet was the first drag queen to walk the carpet.\n\n17. Kim Chi\n\nAge: 31\n\nFrom: Chicago, IL\n\nDrag Race: Season 8 runner-up\n\nThis towering Korean-American queen serves looks unlike anyone else in the Drag Race galaxy. A seven-foot-tall (in heels) “live-action anime character who works as a high-fashion model,” Kim Chi draws from her background in makeup and art direction to collaborate on fantastical, whimsical, and sometimes avant-garde looks that have helped make her one of the top-three most followed queens on Instagram (she has more than 1.8 million followers). Her post–Drag Race career has included several makeup and beauty-product collaborations, including a line of sheet masks, and brand deals with everyone from Starbucks to Lush to a shopping app.\n\n18. Jinkx Monsoon\n\nAge: 31\n\nFrom: Seattle, WA\n\nDrag Race: Season 5 winner\n\nOf course the queen who catapulted to fame doing an impression of “Little Edie” Bouvier Beale from Grey Gardens ended up a cabaret star. While she’s no stranger to a Haters Roast tour, Jinkx has worked mostly in smaller venues singing torch songs and telling funny stories like many of her comedy idols. She and Major Scales have toured as the Vaudevillians, a pair of old-time performers frozen in a glacier and thawed out by global warming. She recently wrapped up a London production of Drag Becomes Her, a parody of everyone’s favorite Meryl Streep–Goldie Hawn comedy.\n\n19. Manila Luzon\n\nAge: 37\n\nFrom: New York, NY\n\nDrag Race: Season 3 runner-up.\n\nAll Stars: Season 1, seventh/eighth place; Season 4, sixth place.\n\nManila’s costumes — whether a roadkill Big Bird, a spaghetti-and-meatballs extravaganza, or a maxi-pad dress banned by the show but embraced by Instagram — are always a million times campier than anything seen on the Met Ball’s pink carpet. But extravagance is the name of the game for her: Her first studio album, Rules!, came out earlier this year and featured a lavish video for the first single, “Go Fish.”\n\n20. Valentina\n\nAge: 28\n\nFrom: Echo Park, CA\n\nDrag Race: Season 9 seventh place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 4 seventh place.\n\nThe “Latina Goddess” is buoyed by a passionate fan base that will always consider her the real winner of her two seasons on Drag Race. Valentina’s success is perhaps best summed up by the fact that her run on All Stars 4 came to an end the very same week she starred as Angel on Fox’s Rent: Live, easily one of the highest-profile television appearances made by a Drag Race queen.\n\nThe Other Queens\n\nThe rest of our top 100 by power peer group. (In alphabetical order by first name; asterisk denotes queen on most recent season.)\n\nThe Tops\n\nAsia O’Hara\n\nAge: 36\n\nFrom: Dallas, TX\n\nDrag Race: Season 10 fourth place\n\nAsia was the first queen to use live animals in a lip sync, but in a fabulous fail, the butterflies that were supposed to fly out of her top fell to Earth. Some even looked dead.\n\nBeBe Zahara Benet\n\nAge: 38\n\nFrom: Minneapolis, MN\n\nDrag Race: Season 1 winner.\n\nAll-Stars: Season 3 third/fourth place.\n\nBebe took home $20,000 for winning the first season of Drag Race. The cash prize has since been upped to $100,000.\n\nBenDeLaCreme\n\nAge: 37\n\nFrom: Seattle, WA\n\nDrag Race: Season 6 fifth place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 3 sixth place.\n\nIn episode six of All Stars 3, after winning a lip sync competition, BenDeLaCreme made the surprising choice to eliminate herself, calling it “the easiest decision” she’d made all season.\n\n*Brooke Lynn Hytes\n\nAge: 33\n\nFrom: Nashville, TN\n\nDrag Race: Season 11 runner-up\n\nOriginally from Toronto, Brooke Lynn was the first Canadian contestant to appear on the show.\n\nChad Michaels\n\nAge: 48\n\nFrom: San Diego, CA\n\nDrag Race: Season 4 runner-up.\n\nAll Stars: Season 1 winner.\n\nAt 41, Chad became the oldest winner in the shows’ herstory.\n\nGia Gunn\n\nAge: 29\n\nFrom: Chicago, IL\n\nDrag Race: Season 6 tenth place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 4 eighth place.\n\nGia was the first queen to be eliminated twice in Snatch Game.\n\nGinger Minj\n\nAge: 34\n\nFrom: Orlando, FL\n\nDrag Race: Season 7 runner-up.\n\nAll Stars: Season 2 eighth place.\n\nAfter Drag Race, Ginger landed a role in the Netflix film Dumplin’, which features a young, plus-size beauty-queen contestant.\n\nJiggly Caliente\n\nAge: 37\n\nFrom: Queens, NY\n\nDrag Race: Season 4 eighth place\n\nJiggly derives her first name from the Pokémon Jigglypuff.\n\nJujubee\n\nAge: 34\n\nFrom: Boston, MA\n\nDrag Race: Season 2 third place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 1 third/fourth place.\n\nJujubee never won a Drag Race main challenge.\n\nKameron Michaels\n\nAge: 32\n\nFrom: Nashville, TN\n\nDrag Race: Season 10 runner-up\n\nKameron is the fourth queen to enter the competition with the surname Michaels.\n\nMiss Peppermint\n\nAge: 39\n\nFrom: New York, NY\n\nDrag Race: Season 9 runner-up\n\nThe first trans woman to originate a principal role on Broadway.\n\nMiz Cracker\n\nAge: 35\n\nFrom: New York, NY\n\nDrag Race: Season 10 fifth place\n\nMiz Cracker is the only contestant to win the makeover challenge but not advance to the finale.\n\nMonét X Change\n\nAge: 29\n\nFrom: the Bronx, NY\n\nDrag Race: Season 10 sixth place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 4 co-winner.\n\nMonét is the only Miss Congeniality to win a season of Drag Race.\n\nMonique Heart\n\nAge: 33\n\nFrom: Kansas City, MO\n\nDrag Race: Season 10 eighth place.\n\nAll Star: Season 4 third/fourth place.\n\nMonique has been outspoken about racism in the gay and drag communities.\n\nNaomi Smalls\n\nAge: 25\n\nFrom: Redlands, CA\n\nDrag Race: Season 8 runner-up.\n\nAll Stars: Season 4 third/fourth place.\n\nHer drag name was inspired by Naomi Campbell and Biggie Smalls, and she’s the first queen to win two makeover challenges.\n\nRaja Gemini\n\nAge: 44\n\nFrom: Los Angeles, CA\n\nDrag Race: Season 3 winner\n\nHer lip sync against Carmen Carrera to the song “Straight Up,” by Paula Abdul, is considered one of the most memorable in Drag Race history.\n\nRaven\n\nAge: 40\n\nFrom: Riverside, CA\n\nDrag Race: Season 2 runner-up.\n\nAll Stars: Season 1 runner-up.\n\nThough devastated by two runner-up finishes on Drag Race, Raven went on to earn an Emmy nomination for makeup work on later episodes of the show.\n\nShea Couleé\n\nAge: 30\n\nFrom: Chicago, IL\n\nDrag Race: Season 9 third/fourth place\n\nMany think Couleé was robbed of the crown after the Drag Race producers introduced a lip sync battle to decide the winner instead of going off points accumulated.\n\n*Yvie Oddly\n\nAge: 25\n\nFrom: Denver, CO\n\nDrag Race: Season 11 winner\n\nThough Yvie injured herself during a choreography challenge, she was able to finish the competition.\n\nThe Upper Tier\n\nAja\n\nAge: 25\n\nFrom: Brooklyn, NY\n\nDrag Race: Season 9 ninth place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 3 seventh place.\n\nAja was often criticized by the judges and her peers for her makeup, though she was gifted with a sewing machine.\n\n*A’keria Chanel Davenport\n\nAge: 31\n\nFrom: Dallas, TX\n\nDrag Race: Season 11 third/fourth place\n\nIn a delightful piece of improv during the Los Angeles Drag Patrol (LADP) challenge, A’keria busted out an unforgettable twerk while evading arrest. “Twerking is a blessing.

I was getting 50 bucks a night, on a good night $250. Now my average going rate is $1,500. That is good for an artist in the 21st century! I have friends on Broadway who are making $600 a week! I’ve done not just nightclubs but speaking at companies, colleges. I’ve gotten to taste all kinds of food I never thought I would have gotten to taste in my life. I’ve been to Machu Picchu. But I’ve heard that the girls who were on the show since it moved to VH1 make as much as $5,000 a gig, and I’m over here still getting $1,500 and, well, this doesn’t add up. I’m iconic, bitch. Who the fuck are you?” —Laganja Estranja\n\nMiss Fame\n\nAge: 34\n\nFrom: New York, NY\n\nDrag Race: Season 7 seventh place\n\nMiss Fame identifies as gender fluid.\n\nMorgan McMichaels\n\nAge: 38\n\nFrom: Mira Loma, CA\n\nDrag Race: Season 2 eighth place.\n\nAll Stars: Season 3 fifth place.\n\nMorgan won the main challenge in the first episode of season two by using her upside-down skills on a stripper pole to make an impression on the judges.\n\n*Nina West\n\nAge: 40\n\nFrom: Columbus, OH\n\nDrag Race: Season 11 sixth place\n\nNina was surprisingly subdued after winning Miss Congeniality for season 11, offering only a cheeky “Meh.”\n\nOngina\n\nAge: 37\n\nFrom: Los Angeles, CA\n\nDrag Race: Season 1 fifth place\n\nIn the first season of Drag Race, Ongina made herstory by revealing that she is HIV-positive.\n\n*Plastique Tiara\n\nAge: 22\n\nFrom: Dallas, TX\n\nDrag Race: Season 11 eighth place\n\nPlastique won the Farm to Runway challenge with her “Harvest Empress” outfit.\n\n*Ra’Jah O’Hara\n\nAge: 33\n\nFrom: Dallas, TX\n\nDrag Race: Season 11 ninth place\n\nRa’Jah was dubbed the “lip sync assassin” after surviving three lip sync challenges.\n\n*Scarlet Envy\n\nAge: 27\n\nFrom: Brooklyn, NY\n\nDrag Race: Season 11 tenth place\n\nFans were outraged when Scarlet was asked to sashay away after an evenly matched Lip sync for Your Life against Ra’Jah O’Hara.\n\nSharon Needles\n\nAge: 37\n\nFrom: Pittsburgh, PA\n\nDrag Race: Season 4 winner\n\nSharon Needles — a play on “sharing needles” — became an instant standout for her quick wit and ghoulish aesthetic.\n\n*Silky Nutmeg Ganache\n\nAge: 28\n\nFrom: Chicago, IL\n\nDrag Race: Season 11 third/fourth place\n\nSilky revealed on the show that she’s a registered Republican, which many thought was just an attention grab.
