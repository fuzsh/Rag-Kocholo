        "text": "On a low-budget black stage, a legendary drag queen stands tall in her trademark pose: right hand on the hip, the left angled to the sky. “May the best woman–” she pauses for a split second, bright smile slowly etching on her face “– WIN”.\n\nI have listened to that sentence hundreds of times in the last three years. That’s because I am a straight white woman obsessed with a six-foot-four flamboyant American drag queen called RuPaul Charles. I have watched almost everything he’s been in: from the aged yet iconic B-52 video clip for Love Shack from 1989, to the abysmal Netflix series AJ and the Queen, or his \"comeback\" interview alongside Helen Mirren on the Graham Norton Show last year.\n\nNetflix’s algorithm pushed RuPaul into my life, and like a very efficient drug dealer, it has prompted me to watch more ever since.\n\nIt was 2015 when the colourful card first popped up on my Netflix home page: RuPaul's Drag Race. According to Netflix, its recommendation algorithms system is based on your viewing history and how you rate other titles and other members with similar tastes. But I had never watched any reality TV before Drag Race, and haven't really watched any since. Every time I finish a series of Drag Race, the next pops up. When I finish the entire catalogue on Netflix, it prompts me to start watching it all over again.\n\nI don’t know exactly what I did to trigger Drag Race, but I have watched the series on a permanent loop ever since. I now watch at least one episode every day: I have consumed each season on Netflix at least 12 times – which adds up to over 1,000 hours of streaming – or 53 days of my life. And that's not counting other series, podcasts or shows that RuPaul has starred in.\n\nMy penchant for RuPaul has become somewhat of a running joke in my family, most of whom are also fans. But my obsession has grown much deeper. There is nothing I find more addictive than Ru’s main gig, a competition with a format loosely reminiscent of America’s Next Top Model that helped to make drag queens and queer culture a gargantuan presence in mainstream culture. It has attracted A-list celebrities to guest judge each series, including the likes of Lady Gaga, Lizzo, Geri Halliwell, Shania Twain and Christina Aguilera.\n\nOne by one, contestants in drag – with purposefully absurd names such as Alaska Thunderfuck, Shangela Laquifa Wadley, Latrice Royale, Brooke Lynn Hytes or Courtney Act – file out onto the runway, trotting along wearing impossibly high platform heels, huge wigs and cinched waists, propelled forward by the brute force of their own confidence.\n\nAnd whether they are dressed as a snake, wearing a bin bag or sporting fake baby bumps, they are all utterly beautiful to me. Their confidence is infectious, their performances unforgettable, and their drag personalities, which border on caricatures, bely the vulnerable and kind people hidden underneath layers of makeup. But my favourite bit about Drag Race is how utterly shit it really is – from the pointless dress-up challenges, to cringe-worthy acting performances and low budget music videos.\n\nPresiding over this drag empire is Ru, 59, who loves Cher, big hair, loud suits and making cringe-worthy yet catchy autotune hits. On paper, we have absolutely nothing in common – except for the fact that Netflix instinctively knew to introduce us.\n\nMy obsession with Drag Race may have something to do with my brain releasing dopamine as I watched the show for the first time – and is more like alcoholism or substance addiction than first meets the eye.\n\nAfter all, before streaming one would have to wait for a week or so to see a new episode of a favourite series, and that delayed gratification was imposed whether you liked it or not, says Hilda Burke, psychotherapist, couples counsellor and author of The Phone Addiction Workbook.\n\n“Now the real game changer is the viewing technology. You’re not confined to watching it on your sofa, you can watch it on the tube, bus, or at work. It can seamlessly and insidiously slip into every situation.”\n\nBurke says that for one of her clients, watching TV shows on a loop has become such an obsession that he bought a waterproof cover for his iPad to use it in the shower.\n\nHe is one of the growing number of people who have become addicted to their screens. Earlier this year the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy revealed that three people in the UK had been treated for “binge watching addiction”– one of them said that their job had been put at risk because he could not stop watching Breaking Bad.\n\n“It’s like the first line of cocaine – you watch the first episode of a series that you’ve been waiting for, or even better an entire new series that you’ve been waiting for. And that feeling is what we are chasing with anything we are hooked on.”\n\nI'd like to think my obsession has not reached those heights. But I shudder to think how many hours I have wasted on something so trivial - and I'm not alone. All of us are all turning away from conventional TV towards the streaming giants. According to Ofcom figures, the average daily viewing of streaming services rose by seven minutes to 26 minutes last year. But Netflix doesn't just want us to come back to the same show over and over again - it wants us to watch more of it. Figures gathered on behalf of Netflix showed that 61 per cent of TV users regularly engage in binge-watching shows, which could lead to screen addiction, anti-social behaviour, or health problems.\n\nPeople's brains are hardwired to feel empathy and compassion in a way that ties them emotionally to stories that they can see and read. Videos that tug at the heartstrings – such as drag queens admitting their families would never accept them, or that they were abused as children and had overcome great hardship – are not just great TV. They also trigger an emotional connection. A study by neuro-economist Paul Zak of Claremont Graduate University showed that when people were shown a distressing video of a parent desperate because their child was dying of cancer, they would donate money to help sick children.\n\nThat same logic could loosely apply to less extreme yet still raw vulnerability of some of the Drag Race contestants season after season. The shocking revelations that drove me to tears – Ongina's impromptu confession that she is HIV positive, Peppermint's fear of rejection because she is a trans woman, or Dusty Rae Bottom's forced gay conversion therapy highlighted homophobia and rejection in incredibly powerful ways. Yet the show has repeatedly come under fire for forcing contestants to talk about their personal histories in a contrived way for entertainment and shock value.\n\nYet there is so much more to love about what Ru has accomplished. It's hardly a surprise that women are fans of the show: There is nothing more flattering than a bunch of men who believe being a woman is cool, and who are willing to enjoy their femininity and redefine what glamour, femininity and fashion should look like.\n\nRu loves the greatest divas of all time: Whitney Houston, Cher, Diana Ross, Judy Garland. And I love Ru.\n\nWhatever the reasons for my Drag Race addiction, no one can dispute that he has created an incredible legacy: a generation of drag queens who have made queer culture cool and inspired LGBTQ people and their communities to accept what is different. And as Mother Ru always says: \"If you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you going to love anyone else?\"\n\nObsessions is a regular column in which WIRED staffers share their current internet preoccupations.
