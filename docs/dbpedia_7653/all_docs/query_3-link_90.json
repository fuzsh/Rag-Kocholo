        "text": "For one ambitious South Bay seventh-grader, 2022 has already been revelatory.\n\nAnd that’s saying something for a 12-year-old who is about 1 1/2 years removed from coming out to her parents as omnisexual — and receiving unequivocal support from them — and is approaching the one-year anniversary of founding the Rainbow Alliance club at her school.\n\nBut among the most amazing moments for Leah Scott, a student at San Pedro’s Renaissance School, came earlier this month, when she organized an outdoor Drag Queen event attended by more than 100 people.\n\nThe recent Drag Night event — hosted by Rolling Hills Prep, Renaissance and REACH Schools — was meant to educate the school community about LGBTQ cultures and expressive outlets, including the performative nature of drag. The event included booths exploring how to build a drag persona, what wigs to wear and how to do make-up. There was also a friendly lip-sync competition.\n\nAnd, of course, there were drag queens — even a famous one.\n\nThe Drag Night’s marquee moment came when Scott interviewed Tammie Brown, a Long Beach drag performer who competed on TV shows “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars.”\n\nWatching the popular series showcase a “cool art form,” Scott said, helped her self-realization.\n\n“I see how happy they feel when they’re their true selves and when they’re in drag,” Scott said. “I feel like it’s really cool just to be able to celebrate who you are.”\n\nAnd the biggest takeaway was deeply personal for Scott, who said she was nervous but also “super excited” to interview the famous Brown.\n\n“I learned she got a lot of support, which I thought was really nice, because I have a lot of support from my family,” Scott said about the performer’s answer to a question about what it was like growing up and getting into drag.\n\nBrown also told her that she should follow her heart, Scott said, and that’s something the seventh-grader has been doing a lot recently.\n\nA primary goal of the evening was to destigmatize the art of drag in a family-friendly way, said Alexander Purdy Valle, a Rainbow Alliance advisor who also teaches fifth- and sixth-grade at Renaissance.\n\nPeople often confuse drag queens with people who identify as transgender, Purdy Valle said.\n\nA transgender person is someone whose gender identity differs from the biological sex with which they were born. Drag, on the other hand, is performative, he said.\n\nA drag queen is often a person who identifies as male who dresses in feminine attire — with wigs, makeup, traditionally female clothing — often as both entertainment, and political and social expression.\n\nThe terms are not interchangeable, though they have often been conflated, much to the detriment of both those who are transgender and those who dress in drag, LGBTQ advocates say. And neither has anything to do with sexual orientation.\n\nScott’s interest in drag began as she and her mom were researching gay history after she came out to her family in summer 2020.\n\n“She was like, ‘It would be really fun to sort of have a drag event on campus,’” said Rebecca Kandel, Scott’s mom and the academic enrichment coordinator at the school. “We could do a drag show could teach people about it.”\n\nHer daughter uses she/her pronouns and identifies as an omnisexual, Kandel said. That, she said, is someone who is attracted to those of all genders and sexual orientations.\n\nFor Scott, putting definitions on sexual identity is irrelevant, she said. Even the act of “coming out,” Scott said, is not something she really thinks is important.\n\n“You shouldn’t have to announce who you are,” Scott said, “but you should be able to just be who you are.”\n\nBut, she added, talking to her family about her sexual identity was something she wanted to do and they’ve been supportive.\n\nScott first told her older sister, Naomi Scott, a junior at Rolling Hills Prep, then came out to her parents that she was omnisexual a little more than a year ago.\n\nNaomi Scott said she knew her sister would have the full support of their parents.\n\n“I knew that if she came out to them, there would be nothing but support and love for her,” the elder sister said. “My family has supported us in everything we’ve done, and I had no doubt that they would support her in this show.”\n\nDrag Night was indeed a family affair, with Naomi Scott, who works on her school’s theater tech crew, helping with lighting.\n\n“It was really cool getting to see how excited (Leah) was, every time she made a phone call, every time she got an email back,” she said about her sister planning the event. “She was always just so excited to plan and that people were responding so positively to the event.”\n\nPutting the show on without a budget was tough, Kandel said. But with teachers and parents, and with performers such as Tammie Brown volunteering their time, they were able to pull off the event.\n\nAnd, Kandel said, the school’s administration wound up supporting the event, which was a bonus.\n\nAmy Hollinger, head of the trio of schools — which share a campus and an administration — said Drag Night “was better than I think we even could have imagined it to be.” Alumni even showed up — some from as far away as San Diego.\n\nA few parents reached out to Hollinger to inquire about the event, but no one was openly opposed to the show. The event was voluntary, she said, and held in the evening outside of classroom hours. And besides, she said, it was important to support such as student-centered activity.\n\n“So any time a student has an idea,” Hollinger said, “I’m all about helping to support it in ways that I think benefits the community as well as the students.”\n\nMusic teacher Tanner Pfeiffer performed in drag at the show last week to support the work of the Rainbow Alliance.\n\n“Having done drag before, knowing a lot of performers in the drag scene, “Pfeiffer said, “I want to support the queer youth who are interested in doing drag themselves, learning more about it, and experiencing a family-friendly introduction to what it’s like to be a member of the queer community.”\n\nKandel said she and her husband, Doug Scott, support their children in any passion they have, but she realizes that’s not always the case with families.\n\nStill, she said, the greatest achievement for her daughter and the 12 members of the Rainbow Alliance was seeing how many people brought their children to Drag Night.\n\n“To have an event like this that is truly family friendly,” Kandel said, “can help dispel a lot of myths and a lot of stereotypes.”\n\nLeah Scott agreed.\n\n“My intention of this event was to open people’s minds up about drag,” she said, “And I hope they learned to love who they are.”\n\nScott said she hopes to do the event again next year and maybe even something before.\n\n“I have lots of ideas,” she said."
