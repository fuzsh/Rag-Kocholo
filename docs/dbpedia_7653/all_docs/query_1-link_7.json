        "text": "RuPaul is one of the most recognisable people on television, both in and out of drag. The popular host of RuPaul’s Drag Race, he has forged a successful career spanning decades in the music and entertainment industries. Find out more about this incredible entertainer, including how RuPaul continues to empower the LGBTQ+ community, in this article.\n\nWho is RuPaul?\n\nRuPaul is one of the most recognisable drag queens in the business. Since 1993, the 11-time Emmy award winner has entertained audiences across the world and created a community of loyal fans. Between RuPaul’s music career and role as the host and judge of RuPaul’s Drag Race, it is safe to say that the popularity of modern drag is credited to this entertainment icon.\n\nWhat is RuPaul’s Real Name?\n\nRuPaul’s real name is RuPaul Andre Charles. The first part of his name, ‘Ru’, is in recognition of his Louisiana heritage and references the roux in many creole soups and strews. Though RuPaul was born in California, both of his parents were from Louisiana.\n\nWhat is RuPaul’s Drag Name?\n\nUnlike many drag queens, RuPaul’s drag name is just that – RuPaul! Though drag queens like Trixie Mattel and Kim Chi go by stage names, the founder of Drag Race opted for his first name instead and is known by the mononym, RuPaul.\n\nWhere is RuPaul From?\n\nRuPaul was born in San Diego, California in 1960. Aged just 15, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia to attend a performing arts school. In his early career, RuPaul recorded popular albums including Red Hot and Supermodel of the World, before launching his namesake, RuPaul’s Drag Race.\n\nWho is RuPaul’s Husband?\n\nRuPaul married Georges LeBar in 2017, after meeting in 1994. In an article by Pink News, it was revealed that the pair met on the dance floor at a club titled Limelight. Though RuPaul is relatively private about the details of his marriage, the couple’s public relationship made great strides for LGBTQ+ representation in the media.\n\nHow Did RuPaul Get Famous?\n\nFollowing a successful music career, RuPaul launched the revolutionary game show, RuPaul’s Drag Race, in 2009. This is arguably his claim to fame, as the show has since become an international success.\n\nIn 2012, he launched RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars, which featured previous contestants. Alongside the release of his TV programmes, RuPaul continued to produce music, including Born Naked and Realness. In 2019, RuPaul released Drag Race UK and took the show to the international stage.\n\nHow Did RuPaul and Michelle Visage Meet?\n\nRuPaul met Michelle Visage in the 1980s at a nightclub. Their friendship blossomed, and Michelle joined the Drag Race line-up as a permanent judge for season three. Since season 11, Michelle has been a producer on RuPaul’s popular reality show, a role for which she won her first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Competition Program.\n\nHear from Michelle Visage herself in the exclusive interview below from our sister company, Champions Speakers:\n\nWhat is RuPaul’s Drag Race?\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race is the first competition series in the Drag Race franchise. Since its launch in 2009, the programme has skyrocketed drag as entertainment to the mainstream and introduced the art form to a whole new community of fans. RuPaul’s Drag Race has also produced several spin-off series, including series taking place across the world, from the UK to Australia.\n\nThe concept for RuPaul’s Drag Race is simple. A group of drag performers come together to compete against one another in several challenges, like ‘Lip Sync for Your Life’, judged by a panel of experts, entertainers, and celebrities. Each week, one drag queen is eliminated until the champion is announced.\n\nHow Popular is RuPaul’s Drag Race?\n\nFor over a decade, RuPaul’s Drag Race has dominated television screens across the globe, but how popular is the award-winning programme. When Lady Gaga joined the line-up of judges in season nine, 987 thousand viewers tuned in to watch RuPaul’s Drag Race, the highest recorded audience as of 2021. Considering the sheer number of views per episode, it is no surprise that RuPaul’s Drag Race continues to generate significant interest from audiences around the world.\n\nWhat Has RuPaul Done for the LGBTQ+ Community?\n\nIn an openly gay marriage, RuPaul has transformed the representation of LGBTQ+ relationships in the media. Though he prefers to keep his relationship private, by simply living his true, authentic life and not hiding his love for his husband, RuPaul continues to prove the importance of equality and inclusion for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nAdditionally, he has been a vocal activist for voter registration for several years, particularly for the LGBTQ+ community. Research has found that many LGBTQ+ people do not participate in national elections, so RuPaul encouraged voter registration through a public service announcement in support of National Voter Registration Day.\n\nA pioneer of queer representation and the first drag artist to host their own national talk show, RuPaul has made great strides for the LGBTQ+ community. He has secured global exposure for up-and-coming drag queens and uses his platform to discuss important topics, like female empowerment and racial discrimination. For his efforts, RuPaul was awarded the Vito Russo Award at the GLADD Media Awards in 1999."
