        "text": "The Death Angels are the main antagonists of the A Quiet Place franchise.\n\nDeath Angels arrived on earth by means of meteorites. They have incredibly good hearing, which they use to kill anything that makes even the slightest sound. This, combined with their near-indestructible armor, allowed them to massacre most sapient life on the planet, including a sizable portion of humanity, subsequently causing society to collapse.\n\nBiology[]\n\nAccording to John Krasinski, the director of the movies, the creatures originated on a lightless planet in a faraway galaxy, a hell world with harsher conditions and higher gravity than Earth. They adapted to this environment with features such as echolocation instead of sight, nearly impenetrable armor-like skin, and greater strength in Earth's gravity. Their skin is so tough that it can resist many kinds of conventional weaponry, from small firearms such as a shotguns and rifles, to missiles or bombs. They can destroy steel and other hard objects. They are, however, completely blind and their bodies are so dense that they can't swim in deep water.\n\nThe creatures are slightly taller than a human, with overall proportions that are lithe and lean. Their body posture vaguely resembles a cross between a gorilla and a flightless bat: all four of their limbs are digitigrade, walking on their knuckles, with arms drastically larger than their legs — resulting in them usually running on all four limbs but capable of rearing up to attack or jump large distances. Due to their claws and great strength, they are very adept at climbing on walls, windows and also glass panel. They are also able to run extremely fast with speeds up to 300mph. Their claws consists three fingers and their claws very sharp and capable of killing instantly or causing the victim suffers serious injury. A larger and more muscular variant of Death Angels is introduced in A Quiet Place: Day One, possibly meant to be an \"alpha\" of sorts, implying the creatures do have a hierarchy within their social structure.\n\nTheir head features a large jaw filled with sharp teeth, and no eyes. With no apparent nose, it is unclear if they possess any sense of smell, or if smell perception is achieved through sense organs in the mouth. The entire head is composed of ears inside and multiple sections of armor-like plates outside that protected their ears and flesh from any weapons. Their armor plates can be held open if they want to listen more closely for prey or detect the sound — unfolding like a hellish cabbage. Their delicate ears underneath the armor able to detect deeper and smaller sound/noise such as mechanical alarm clock but their ears are vulnerable to conventional weapons, explaining why they only briefly lift their plates if they feel safe enough to do so when tracking an enemy or prey and they always close their armor to protect their ears when attacking the target and hunting sound.\n\nTheir extremely sensitive hearing can be turned into a weakness, as Regan discovered that their ears are so delicate that high-frequency sound waves (generated from a hearing aid) will make them uncontrollably squeal in pain and spasm, accidentally opening up the armor plates on their ears and exposing the vulnerable skin underneath, which allows humans easily kill the creatures with any weapon. If the high-pitched noises are loud enough, they could cause a Death Angel to be temporarily disabled from the pain.\n\nAs confirmed by Krasinski, the aliens are not sapient, but vicious animals. Just how intelligent they are is unclear, as they mostly seem driven by pure instinct, though the Abbotts' whiteboard speculates that they are capable of hunting in packs. Besides, when one of Death Angel was killed, another Death Angel came running to the location of its death, with no exception, presumably because of the noise that easily attracted other Death Angels. However, they are shown communicating in the last movie through screeches to alert others when one has discovered a food source, which shows that they have the ability to communicate with one another (which is a sign of more advanced intelligence).\n\nPerhaps most frustratingly, the creatures do not kill for food: the Abbotts' whiteboard includes the prominent note, \"Why don't they eat their prey?\", and they are never seen eating any of the corpses they leave behind: all human corpses were seen mummified, yet otherwise intact. Furthermore, as shown in a A Quiet Place: Day One, the aliens appear to be eating alien plants that came with their asteroids, which suggests they don't eat living creatures like humans. This explains how they've survived so long on Earth. They don't seem intelligent enough to kill for sadism; rather, it seems that they just instinctively lash out at anything that creates any kind of noise (that can come off as some form of threat to the Death Angels). It's possible that they cannot eat their prey, because their biology is incompatible with terrestrial animals. Nonetheless, they are so robust that they survived a long interstellar journey on asteroids (possibly in a state of hibernation).\n\nHistory[]\n\nPre-Series[]\n\nAt some point, the creatures' planet was destroyed for unknown reasons, but due to their durable nature and their indestructible armor, they survived on asteroid fragments, which eventually arrived on Earth in a meteor shower and fall into several cities such as Millbrook, Mexico, New York and Shanghai.\n\nA Quiet Place[]\n\nThe Death Angels are responsible for Beau's death at the beginning of the film after Beau turned on the rocket toy by inserting the batteries. They are also seen hunting in the Abbott household when Evelyn's water breaks and she accidentally stabs her foot with a nail in the basement stairs. A Death Angel killed Raccoon in the night after raccoon made a noise. A Death Angel slashed a Man in the Woods after he discovered that his wife was killed by a Death Angel earlier. The man had attracted the Death Angel (as a form of suicide) by screaming. A Death Angel was approaching Evelyn in the bathroom (when she was about to give birth to her son), but it was distracted away due to Marcus setting off a firework. Lee's death was at the claws of a Death Angel, albeit it was to protect Regan and Marcus as they help Evelyn. A Death Angel was shown in the finale when their weakness, high-pitched frequency waves, was shown, and it was killed by Evelyn. Two more came running to the farm after its death, implying that they were killed, too.\n\nA Quiet Place Part II[]\n\nIn the opening scene, Death Angels are seen slaughtering the inhabitants of Millbrook, a New York town, on the first day they landed on Earth by a meteor. At the start of the attack (not long after the meteor landed at Walker's Farm near Millbrook), one of them attacked a police car of a local officer causing panic in main street, then another attacked and destroyed a station wagon just in front of Evelyn's car which also claw her front window, and another killed a driver of a bus which caused it to about ram over Evelyn, Marcus, and Beau though they were able to avoid it but the bus hit her car. In the ensuing chaos, a Death Angel was able to continue rampaging the town killing a few inhabitants, just as Lee, Regan, and most of the inhabitants went to a nearby bar to avoid being killed. They hid in tables and tried to stay silent as possible to avoid Death Angels, as Lee tried to silence a praying man and they witnessed one of Death Angel walk slowly and open their armor to track the sound. However, a teenage couple's phone accidentally rings, alerting the Death Angel outside and closing the armor then the Death Angel attacking and killing a few people in the bar just as Lee and Regan escaped the bar with the Death Angel pursuing them. As Lee and Regan approach the damaged police car where Evelyn, Beau, and Marcus are hiding, the Death Angel tries to kill them but Ronnie, the local police officer, saves them by trying to shoot by his shotgun at the creature. Despite his best efforts, the shots are no match for the creature's impenetrable armor but the shotgun's sound distracts the Death Angel from Abbotts and the officer decides to sacrifice himself to save the family.\n\nIn the present, a Death Angel was shown chasing the Abbott family and Emmett when Evelyn accidentally set off Emmett's booby trap and Marcus gets his foot severely injured in a bear trap at outside of his base, an abandoned factory, Regan set the speaker with her high-frequency feedback to disorient and open the Death Angel plate and Evelyn killed the creature by her shotgun. A Death Angel was shown hunting Regan when she encountered an abandoned train, where it attempts to kill her. Regan uses her high-frequency feedback to disorient the creature along with her shotgun, though it is only able to damage the creature's armor. The creature tries to kill Regan, but she was saved by Emmett. When Regan and Emmett are confronted by a group of feral humans lead by Marina Man while searching for a boat on the docks, Emmett makes a noise to attracts two Death Angels where they slaughter the deranged inhabitants. Emmett then stabs the leader with a knife causing the leader screamed which allow the creature to kill him before jumping off to avoid being killed. The Death Angel hopped on a boat and killed more humans but later drowned as it jumped on the water and trying to get back on the boat, while the other Death Angel got into the same boat. A Death Angel got into Emmett's base, leading to Marcus and his brother accidentally trapping themselves in a furnace-turned-bunker, nearly suffocating them.\n\nNext day, Emmett hears the sound of boat crashed and discovered that the Death Angel was on the damaged boat snuck onto the island and attacked the island survivors before being lured by Henri, Emmett and Regan towards the radio station where Henri got killed and Emmett got injured by it before Regan was able to use her cochlear implant to broadcast a high pitch frequency across the local area to stun the Death Angels. At the same time, Evelyn walks slowly and discover that the creature is still nearby then Evelyn managed to close the door but failed and then the creature managed to pull Marcus, Evelyn and the baby out. However, the creature claw Evelyn's leg which injured Evelyn. Regan later turned on her cochlear implant then bring to the creature closer but ineffective. Regan turned on the radio which angered the creature. Shortly, Regan stab her cochlear implant to microphone and make them opened their armor and reveal their vulnerable spot, allowing Regan to kill the creature on the island and also for Marcus to kill the creature in Emmett's base.\n\nA Quiet Place: Day One[]\n\nTo be added\n\nOther characters[]\n\nCharacters killed[]\n\n# Image Character Cause Day Media 1 Ronnie Slashed after distracting his shotgun to Death Angel for saving Abbotts Family. 1 A Quiet Place Part II 2 About 5 old men and women in hospice care.
