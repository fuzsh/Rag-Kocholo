        "text": "In this new occasion, we have had the opportunity to interview the Thrash Metal band Hazzerd from Canada. Check out the interview and follow the band on their FACEBOOK PAGE.\n\n1. Where did you get the idea for the band name, you planned it or came out just like that?\n\nWell, our old singer Cole came up with the name “Hazard X” way back in 2012 and me (Dylan) and Brendan shortened the name and changed the spelling to “Hazzerd” later that same year! So it came to us over a brief period of time.\n\n2. Why did you want to play this genre?\n\nWell to us, thrash is the best genre of metal as it lets out the aggression, the speed and the anger we all inevitably have inside us. Also the riffs in thrash are the absolute tastiest in all of metal. Just our opinions though!\n\n3. Did you know each other before the band was formed?\n\nNo, we did not. Me (Dylan) & Brendan met through our local classifieds website called “Kijiji” The reason we started talking was because Brendan had a picture of Megadeth’s “Rust In Peace” as his advertisement photo with the ad stating “19 year old seeking thrash metal band” Tory was the same kind of deal as we met through the same site in early 2015, and we eventually met Dave through the local Calgary scene as he played with another band by the name of “Southbound Crow”\n\n4. Each band member favorite band?\n\nDylan: Megadeth\n\nDave: Iron Maiden\n\nBrendan: Megadeth\n\nToryin: Vicious Rumors\n\n5. Who or what inspires you to write songs?\n\nHonestly, I’d say the love for music (as cheesy as that sounds) there’s a certain feeling you get when you play your original material live and people are really into it, it’s the best high I can think of! 6. Where was your last gig? Our last show was at Dickens pub in Calgary, Alberta. We debuted a couple new songs that evening as well!\n\n7. Where would you like to act?\n\nWe’d love to play over in Germany someday soon, or even Europe as a whole as we know the scene over there is absolutely crazy!\n\n8. Whom would you like to feature with?\n\nIt would be a dream come true if we could open for Death Angel, Anthrax, Megadeth. Honestly, any band that has influenced in the slightest would be nuts to open for.\n\n9. Whom not?\n\nI can’t think of any bands we’d not want to play with strictly because of music but based on off-stage antics and attitudes all together I’d say the only band I can personally think of would be Motley Crüe.\n\n10. Any of you has ever suffered from stage fright? Any tip for beginners on how to beat that?\n\nI (Dylan) suffered stage fright when I first started singing & playing drums for the band, the way I got over it was by playing live more and getting out of my comfort zone, pushing yourself and understanding that love for the music is stronger than fear. Now it’s kind of like second nature and I enjoy every minute of playing live!\n\n11. What bands have inspired you the most?\n\nMetallica, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Havok, Tantara, Heathen, Megadeth, Anthrax, Toxic, Annihilator, Testament, Death Angel, Motörhead. Many more.\n\n12. What's the weirdest thing a fan has ever asked you for?\n\nGot asked to sign a dudes ass once, that was kind of awkward hahaha\n\n13. What do you think of your fans?\n\nWe love them, we have a very dedicated (& patient) fan base and to be honest, without them we are nothing. Every show we play they show up to mosh and party just as hard as us and it’s amazing.\n\n14. What do you think of our site?\n\nIt’s awesome! Great overall site to get informed on the latest bands/interviews & to be connected with labels and PR\n\n15. Something add?"
