        "text": "San Francisco Bay Area thrash legends, DEATH ANGEL, have debuted at #98 on the U.S. Billboard Top 100 chart with their new album The Evil Divide. Other chart positions include:\n\n#33 Current album charts (U.S.A.)\n\n#4 Hard Music (U.S.A.)\n\n#8 Hard Music (Canada)\n\n#74 Top Music (Canada)\n\nComments vocalist Mark Osegueda:\n\n\"We would like to thank everyone out there who contributed to the success of our first weeks sales of The Evil Divide! An album we worked very hard on, and are very proud of! Thank you for keeping our passion and dreams alive! The music industry is not for the meek, and we appreciate you all for continually instilling strength in us to give it our all, and give you our best!\"\n\nDEATH ANGEL's eighth studio album, The Evil Divide, worldwide on May 27, 2016 via Nuclear Blast Records. The album was once again recorded at AudioHammer studios in Sanford, Florida with producer Jason Suecof (TRIVIUM, DEICIDE), who previously worked on 2010's Relentless Retribution and 2013's The Dream Calls For Blood. Mastering duties were handled by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound in New York City. Artwork was created by Bob Tyrrell.\n\nThree decades into their celebrated career, DEATH ANGEL remain as hungry as ever.\n\nAs a result, uncompromising urgency and unpredictability define the Bay Area thrash quintet's eighth full-length album, The Evil Divide [Nuclear Blast]. The group-Mark Osegueda [vocals], Rob Cavestany [lead guitar], Ted Aguilar [guitar], Will Carroll [drums], and Damien Sisson [bass]-satiate the appetite for buzzsaw speed riffs, double bass mayhem, and scorching vocals over the course of ten new anthems.\n\nThe Evil Divide stands out as the culmination of thirty-plus years of music for DEATH ANGEL. It kicked off with legendary debut, The Ultra-Violence, in 1987. The classic Frolic Through The Park began to cement their legacy and even earned the distinction of landing on Loudwire's list of the \"Top Ten Thrash Albums NOT Released by The Big 4.\" The group broke up following 1990's Act III only to reunite in 2004 on Art of Dying for the next generation.\n\nIn 2008, DEATH ANGEL teamed with producer Nick Raskulinecz [Foo Fighters, Alice In Chains, Rush, Mastodon] for Killing Season recorded at Dave Grohl's Studio 606. In 2010, Relentless Retribution boasted a cameo from virtuosos Rodrigo y Gabriela, while 2013's The Dream Calls For Blood bowed at #72 on the Billboard Top 200, selling 5,400 copies first-week and earning the group's first-ever entry onto that respective chart.\n\nBeyond continued public praise from the likes of James Hetfield of Metallica and Robb Flynn of Machine Head, the band's music has popped up everywhere from Carl's Jr. commercials to Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. Their fire burns brighter than ever in 2016.\n\nMore on The Evil Divide:\n\n\"Hatred United / United Hate\" https://youtu.be/6WXBob7a9go\n\n\"Cause For Alarm\" track video https://youtu.be/-N0UcnswlUQ\n\n\"The Moth\" track video https://youtu.be/FRW1mdm3CaI\n\nIn-studio trailer #1 https://youtu.be/XBkIraeKfa8\n\nIn-studio trailer #2 https://youtu.be/bzidP0lXzT4\n\nIn-studio trailer #3 https://youtu.be/VtDPaIxwIco\n\n\"The Evil Divide\" album trailer https://youtu.be/QiLvkze3gQk\n\n\"Lost\" music video https://youtu.be/GVYl_hiD1oQ\n\nVisit DEATH ANGEL online:\n\nwww.DEATHANGEL.us\n\nwww.facebook.com/DEATHANGEL\n\nhttps://twitter.com/deathangel\n\nhttps://instagram.com/deathangelofficial\n\nwww.youtube.com/deathangelofficial"
