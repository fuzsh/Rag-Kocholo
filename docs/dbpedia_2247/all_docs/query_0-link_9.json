Death Angel was formed in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1982 by guitarists Rob Cavestany and Gus Pepa, bassist Dennis Pepa and drummer Andy Galeon. The lead vocalist position was originally filled by Dennis Pepa, until Mark Osegueda became the band's permanent singer in 1984.\n\nAfter releasing two demo tapes, Heavy Metal Insanity (1983) and Kill as One (1985), the band signed with the independent label Enigma Records and released its debut full-length album, The Ultra-Violence, in 1987, followed a year later by Frolic through the Park (1988); both albums were minor successes in the United States and Europe.[1][2] In 1989, Death Angel signed with Geffen Records, and released its only album for the major label, Act III, in the following year. Act III failed to chart in the United States, but enjoyed some success in Europe, including France, Belgium and Switzerland.[3][4][5]\n\nDeath Angel's first live album, Fall from Grace, was also released in 1990, but did not appear on any charts. In 1991, the band broke up, due to Galeon seriously injured from a bus accident, but reformed ten years later with a new lineup. Death Angel subsequently signed to the German independent label Nuclear Blast, and released The Art of Dying, their first studio album in 14 years, in 2004. The band has since released five more studio albums and one EP.\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album details Peak chart positions US\n\n[1] US\n\nHeat.\n\n[1] US\n\nInd.\n\n[1] BEL (WA)\n\n[4] CHE\n\n[5] FRA\n\n[3] GER\n\n[6] HUN\n\n[7] NLD\n\n[2] 1987 The Ultra-Violence\n\nReleased: April 23, 1987\n\nLabel: Enigma\n\nFormats: CD, CS, DI\n\n— — — — — — — — 58 1988 Frolic through the Park\n\nReleased: July 5, 1988\n\nLabel: Enigma\n\nFormats: CD, CS, DI\n\n143 — — 65 — — 22 37 48 1990 Act III\n\nReleased: April 10, 1990\n\nLabel: Geffen\n\nFormats: CD, DI\n\n— — — 32 88 17 — 58 72 2004 The Art of Dying\n\nReleased: May 4, 2004\n\nLabel: Nuclear Blast\n\nFormats: CD, LP, DI\n\n— — 50 — — — — — — 2008 Killing Season\n\nReleased: February 26, 2008\n\nLabel: Nuclear Blast\n\nFormats: CD, LP, DI\n\n— 21 — — — — 59 — 56 2010 Relentless Retribution\n\nReleased: September 14, 2010\n\nLabel: Nuclear Blast\n\nFormats: CD, DI\n\n— 10 48 86 70 95 45 9 — 2013 The Dream Calls for Blood\n\nReleased: October 15, 2013\n\nLabel: Nuclear Blast\n\nFormats: CD, DI\n\n72 — 17 117 — 161 59 — — 2016 The Evil Divide\n\nReleased: May 27, 2016\n\nLabel: Nuclear Blast\n\nFormats: CD, DI\n\n98 — 7 — 40 110\n\n[8] 37 — — 2019 Humanicide\n\nReleased: May 31, 2019\n\nLabel: Nuclear Blast\n\nFormats: CD, DI\n\n— — 3 94 21 132\n\n[9] 19 — — \"—\" denotes a release that did not chart.\n\nEPs\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album details 2020 Under Pressure\n\nReleased: October 9, 2020\n\nLabel: Nuclear Blast\n\nFormats: DI\n\nCompilation albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album details 2005 Archives and Artifacts\n\nReleased: February 1, 2005\n\nLabel: Restless\n\nFormats: CD\n\n2007 The Long Road Home\n\nReleased: 2007\n\nLabel: Nuclear Blast\n\nFormats: CD\n\n2020 The Enigma Years (1987–1990)\n\nReleased: October 30, 2020\n\nLabel: HNE Recordings Ltd\n\nFormats: CD\n\nLive albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album details 1990 Fall from Grace\n\nReleased: November 6, 1990\n\nLabel: Enigma\n\nFormats: CD\n\n2009 Sonic German Beatdown – Live in Germany\n\nReleased: July 28, 2009\n\nLabel: Nuclear Blast\n\nFormats: CD, LP, DI\n\n2015 The Bay Calls for Blood (Live in San Francisco)\n\nLabel: Nuclear Blast\n\nFormats: LP, DI\n\n2021 The Bastard Tracks\n\nLabel: Nuclear Blast\n\nFormats: CD, LP, DI\n\nDemo albums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album details 1983 Heavy Metal Insanity\n\nReleased: 1983\n\nFormats: CS\n\n1985 Kill as One\n\nReleased: 1985\n\nFormats: CS\n\n1990 Act III\n\nReleased: 1990\n\nFormats: CS\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Song Album 1988 \"Bored\" Frolic through the Park 1990 \"Seemingly Endless Time\" Act III \"A Room with a View\" 2004 \"Thrown to the Wolves\" The Art of Dying 2008 \"Dethroned\" Killing Season \"Sonic Beatdown\" 2010 \"Truce\" Relentless Retribution\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Song Director 1987 \"Voracious Souls\" 1988 \"Bored\" 1990 \"Seemingly Endless Time\" \"A Room with a View\" 2004 \"Thicker Than Blood\" 2008 \"Dethroned\" Robert Sexton[10] 2010 \"Truce\" 2011 \"River of Rapture\" Tommy Jones[11] 2014 \"Left for Dead\" \"The Dream Calls for Blood\" 2016 \"Hatred United / United Hate\" \"Lost\" Tommy Jones 2017 \"Breakaway\" (lyric video) 2019 \"The Pack\" (lyric video) \"I Came for Blood\" JayLaced Productions \"Immortal Behated\" Tricia Aguilar, Jonathan Alegre, Eric Larsen 2020 \"Under Pressure\" Tricia Aguilar \"Aggressor\" Ben Clarkson\n\nOther appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nMetallic Attack: Metallica – The Ultimate Tribute album (\"Trapped Under Ice\") (2004)\n\nAlone in the Dark movie soundtrack (\"The Devil Incarnate\") (2005)\n\nMetal Swim – Adult Swim compilation album (\"Truce\") (2010)\n\nVideography\n\n[edit]\n\nSonic German Beatdown – Live in Germany (DVD, 2009)"
