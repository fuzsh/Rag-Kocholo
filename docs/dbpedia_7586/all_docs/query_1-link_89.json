        "text": "This is a contribution from Linking Constructions into Functional Linguistics: The Role of Constructions in Grammar [Studies in Language Companion Series 145], B. Nolan and E. Diedrichsen (eds.), 179-204. Amsterdam: John Benjamins. The object of this chapter is to present an RRG account of one of the most widely studied constructions: the English resultative. In order to provide a finer-nuanced description of the resultative than the one currently posited by Van Valin (2005: 239), our study mainly draws on the work on constructional schemas recently carried out by some RRG scholars (i.e. Cortés 2009; Diedrichsen 2010, 2011; Nolan 2011ab; Van Valin 2011, 2012, inter alios). Additionally, it also takes into consideration part of the semantic and syntactic analyses developed within the family of Construction Grammars (CxG(s)) by Gonzálvez-García (2009, 2011), Goldberg (1995), Godlberg & Jackendoff (2004), and Luzondo (2011), to name but a few, and some of the insights from the Lexical Constructional Model (LCM; Ruiz de Mendoza & Mairal 2008, 2011; Mairal & Ruiz de Mendoza 2009; see Butler 2009 for a critical overview). The structure of this paper is as follows. In section (2), a brief overview of the status of the notion of construction throughout RRG in general, and the account of the resultative construction in particular, is furnished. Section (3) presents a preliminary proposal of an RRG constructional schema for the property English resultative (e.g. The blacksmith hammered the metal flat), which enhances its constructional meaning and its relation with verb meaning. We sustain, with Diedrichsen (2010, 2011) and Nolan (2011ab), that RRG schemas should become more constructional and incorporate, among others, the construction signature, its constraints, its workspace, and its input and output strings. Furthermore, due to the fundamental role played by metaphor and metonymy in order to explain the data under scrutiny, we advance the addition of two new features to the proposed English resultative schema, namely, the motivation of the construction and the family resemblance connection. This stance on enriching RRG constructional schemas has immediate and direct consequences for our second goal in this work: what are the connections that the property English resultative establishes with the motion resultative construction (e.g. He hammered the metal into the shape of a heart), which we also posit could further be extended to other closely related constructions such as the motion resultative, the caused-motion, the way construction, etc. Section (4) explores this particularly interesting issue that still remains open in RRG (Van Valin 2011) but where we believe the theoretical apparatus of the LCM, a model which already integrates RRG in its lexical descriptions, could shed some light on. Finally, section (5) offers some concluding remarks."
