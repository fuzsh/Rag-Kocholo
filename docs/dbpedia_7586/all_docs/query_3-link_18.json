The axiom of choice states that for any collection of non-empty sets, it is possible to choose one element from each set to form a set. \n2. The axiom was formulated in 1904 by Ernst Zermelo to prove the well-ordering theorem. It is now commonly accepted and used in mathematics.\n3. While originally controversial, the axiom of choice is now included in the standard Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC). Some areas of constructive mathematics avoid it.",
