This document provides a history of constructivism in the 20th century. It discusses several trends within constructivism including finitism, which rejects abstract concepts and quantifiers and interprets existence claims constructively; intuitionism, which insists mathematical objects are mental constructions; and Bishop's constructivism. It outlines the key figures that developed these trends like Kronecker, Skolem, Hilbert, Bernays, and Bishop. The document also discusses related areas like metamathematics, predicativism, and actualism, which critiques finitism for not accounting for large numbers.",
