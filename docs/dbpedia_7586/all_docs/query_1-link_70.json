        "text": "In his recent book “Peirce and the Threat of Nominalism”, Paul Forster (2011) argued how Peirce understood the nominalism. Forster also explained that the nominalist move of individualising concepts for collections could cost denial of properties of true continua. Peirce showed some vibrant issues both in mathematics and in metaphysics, as for example, the classic one of universals. That work, however, is still incomplete; needs to be clarified how these ideas bind with Peirce’s doctrine of ‘scholastic realism’. Peirce’s own theory of continuity might be the answer: I trace the origins of this doctrine in the theory of multitude. I show how the theory of continuity frees analysis from constraints of nominalist theories of reality. Peirce’s theory of multitude, instead, can be derived with mathematics: By drawing in the work of the ways of abstraction in diagrammatic reasoning made by Sun Jo Shin (2010) and in continuum theories by Cathy Legg (2010) I show the conceptual device of “diagrammatic reasoning” as a plausible pragmatic tool to represent continua and make sense of Peirce’s metaphysics. The analysis of continuity is a perfect example of how the method of diagrammatic reasoning helps to unblock the road of philosophical inquiry as well as clarify other problems as for example, the applicability of Mathematics. I conclude explaining that general concepts define ‘continua’. The properties of true continua are not reducible to individuals they comprise. Continua are the universals of metaphysics; they are intelligible and necessary to ground the science of inquiry.\n\nIn the course of his philosophic career, Charles Peirce made repeated attempts to construct mathematical definitions of the commonsense or experimental notion of'continuity'. In what I will label his Final Definition of Continuity, however, Peirce abandoned the attempt to achieve mathematical definition and assigned the analysis of continuity to an otherwise unnamed extra-mathematical science. In this paper, I identify the Final Definition, attempt to define its terms, and suggest that it belongs to Peirce's emergent semiotics of vagueness. I argue, further, that it marks the transformation of Peirce's synechism. Before the time of his Final Definition, Peirce adopted a theory of continuity as a foundational principle of metaphysics and assumed this principle might be formalized in a mathematics of continuity. After the Final Definition, Peirce abandoned his foundationalism in favor of what he called a critical common-sensism. This is the claim that philosophy (and with it, logic) derives its norms from the observation of actual cognitive practices and that continuity is a distinguishing mark of actual as opposed to merely possible or imagined practices.\n\nAbstract: Contemporary discussions around the foundations of mathematics are traditionally stepping into two opposite standstowards the reality of mathematical objects or structures: some of them are plainly nominalistic, denying the existence of theobjects of mathematical inquiries; the opposite stand is the extreme Platonism that defends an account of a realm of mathemat-ical entities where they exist. Both solutions ﬁnd serious problems in accounting for the applicability and continuity betweenformal theoretical inquiry and the applicability of mathematics in our best scientiﬁc theories. In this scenario, Mathematicalstructuralism offers a halfway through overcoming the metaphysical scruples of the nominalist and the extreme realism of thePlatonist. At the same time enables us a criterion to ﬁnd a continuum between theory and applicability through an accountof diagrammatic reasoning into the mathematical inquiries. My aim is to show how Peirce’s plea for diagrammatic reasoningfulﬁls the problem of our access to these structures by an account of mathematical true continua. Keywords : Applicability of Mathematics, Mathematical Structuralism, Peirce’s diagrammatic reasonin\n\ndescribes Euclid’s procedure in proving theorems. Euclid first presents his theorem in general terms and then translates it into singular terms. Peirce pays attention to the fact that the generality of the statement is not lost by that move. The next step is construction, which is followed by demonstration. Finally the ergo-sentence repeats the original general proposition. Peirce lays much emphasis on the distinction between corollarial and theorematic reasoning in geometry. He takes an argument to be corollarial if no auxiliary construction is needed. For Peirce, construction is “the principal theoric step ” of the demonstration. Peirce also stresses that it is the observation of diagrams that is essential to all reasoning and that even if no auxiliary constructions are made, there is always the step from a general to a singular statement in deductive reasoning; that means introducing a kind of diagram to reasoning. This paper seeks to argue for two theses. One is that the way of ...\n\nLa lógica experimenta actualmente un crecimiento vertiginoso. Acompañada de un impulso inter y transdisciplinario, se despliega como un saber que transforma la naturaleza de las nociones de epistemolog&iacure;a y semántica. Es hora de que los filósofos se confronten a los problemas y a las nuevas preguntas esbozadas por estos avances. En verdad es manifiesto que hay ya algunos emprendimientos importantes en ese sentido. Emprendimientos que contribuyen en la exploración de nuevas direcciones del rol de la lógica como organon. El objetivo principal de nuestra colección es precisamente promover la publicación y traducción de obras en lengua castellana sobre lógica, filosofía de la lógica, filosofía de la ciencia, epistemología y semántica de la lenguas naturales. Esperamos que un tal foro de publicación fomentará la consolidación de vínculos ya existentes entre las disciplinas mencionadas y la construcción de nuevos lazos inter-y transdisciplinarios. Logic is nowadays growing at a breathtaking pace with a trans-and interdisciplinary élan which is transforming the very nature of the notion of epistemology and semantics. The time is ripe for philosophers to take up the challenges resulting from this impulse and indeed there are clear signals that many philosophers have already responded by taking upon themselves the task of reinstating logic in a new version of its old role of organon.The aim of this series is to promote the publication in Spanish of worksin logic, philosophy of logic, philosophy of science, epistemology and semantic for natural languag. This publication forum should foster the consolidation of existing links between those disciplines and the building of new inter and transdisplinary ones. The Volume La lógica como herramienta de la razón has been published by the UK publisher College Publications. Their Spanish language series Cuadernos de Logica, Epistemologia y Lenguaje, distinguishes itself by promoting and supporting researche in the field of Logic, where logic takes anew the role of an Organon, prescribed in Antiquity by Aristotle. Nowadays; this role of logic is deployed in its inter-and transdisciplianry character. Two other salient characteristics of this collection that I would like to point out, is as, already mentioned, that it publishes original work in Spanish and the second is copyright policy of all CP titles that allows authors to retain full rights for their own work. Prof. Atocha Aliseda (Universidad Autonoma de Mexico) We congratulate, moreover (the Spanish-speaking scientific community) should congratulate ourselves for the launching of a collection that promotes the publication in Spanish of work in this field, \" Prof Arancha San Ginés (Universidad de Granada) Extracted from the Radio interview with Atocha Aliseda (Universidad Autonoma de Mexico), on the occassion of the publication in 2014 of her book La lógica como herramienta de la razón. Directores de la Serie: Shahid Rahman (Université de Lille3-STL:UMR 8163-CNRS) Juan Redmond (Universidad de Valparaíso, STL-UMR8163 Lille3) Editor Asistente: Rodrigo López Orellana (Universidad de Valparaíso/Universidad de Salamanca)\n\nWithin the most recent philosophical discussions on the fascinating and controversial issue of the continuity/difference between human beings and natural world, there is a widespread tendency to maintain an idea of natural continuity which calls forth the notion of universe-life provided by Giordano Bruno. According to this notion, the distinction between Mind and World or their qualitative difference are rejected, and the necessity of natural conditions to the evolution of the specific human phenomenon is claimed . This philosophic view shares J. Dewey’s criticism of traditional philosophical «false antithesis» and therefore calls for a deep attention to the logical-semantic categories implied by the continuity argument. The anti-dichotomic commitment gives light on the naturalistic vein of the classical pragmatism and its relationship with Darwin’s theory of evolution. This essay analyzes Peirce’s theory of continuum and its strict connection with the fallibilistic criterion of knowledge, emphasizing peirceian suggestion to consider the differences between phenomena in terms of dynamic expressions of Nature and not as ontological breaks. This approach is compared with W. James’ metaphysical hypothesis of neutral monism, and also with H. Putnam non-reductionist naturalism that get back to classical pragmatism, in particular to James’s thought, thanks to its characteristic realistic claim, its emphasis on the epistemic value of social and practical dimension, and its anti-dichotomic commitment."
