The same 6 dogs were evaluated throughout the study to establish when cardiac development ends in this breed. The following parameters were measured during systole and diastole: left ventricle posterior wall thickness, interventricular septal thickness, left ventricular internal dimension, left atrial dimension during ventricular systole, aortic root dimension at end diastole, E-point to septal separation, left ventricular preejection period, ejection time of the left ventricular outflow, and time between the cessation and onset of the mitral inflow intervals. The percentage of the left ventricle posterior wall thickening, fractional shortening, ejection fraction, left ventricular end systolic and end-diastolic volumes, ratio of the left atrial dimension to aortic root dimension, and the Tei index of myocardial performance were calculated. The heart rate was measured by cardiac auscultation. The influence of ageing on each echocardiographic parameter and relationships with body weight and surface were studied. Results show that cardiac development in female beagles can be considered finished by the age of 1 y, perhaps as soon as 7 mo. The cardiac indexes studied were unaffected by the age and corporal dimensions, confirming the usefulness of these parameters for evaluating cardiac functionality alterations independent of a dog's age and body weight or surface area.

M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed on 95 clinically healthy dogs including 45 Hungarian Vizslas, 28 Mudis and 22 Hungarian Greyhounds. Linear intracardiac measurements included interventricular septal thickness (IVS), left ventricular internal diameter (LVID), left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW) both in systole and diastole, as well as left atrial internal diameter (LAD), and aortic diameter (AOD) in early diastole. Fractional shortening (FS), end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes (EDV and ESV), as well as LAD:AOD ratio were calculated from the linear parameters. Mean, range and standard deviation of measurements were calculated for each breed. Body weight positively correlated in all three breeds with all left ventricular dimensions, such as IVS d , IVS s , LVID d , LVIDD s , LVPW d and LVPW s parameters. LA values showed positive correlations to body weight in all three breeds. AOD and LA demonstrated a positive correlation with body weight in Hungarian Vizslas and Mudis, whilst the LAD:AOD ratio was related to body weight only in Mudis. Gender did not correlate with any of the measured echocardiographic parameters in any breeds. In Mudis, a positive correlation was found between the LAD: AOD ratio and age, as well as between the LAD: AOD ratio and E point to septal separation (EPSS).\n\nEchocardiographic reference ranges for sedentary donkeys in the UK.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoberts, S L; Dukes-McEwan, J\n\n2016-10-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to provide two-dimensional (2D) and M-mode echocardiographic reference ranges from a sample of the UK population of donkeys including geriatrics (>30â years), owned by The Donkey Sanctuary, and to assess the influence of gender, weight and age on these variables. A total of 36 donkeys with no clinical or echocardiographic evidence of cardiovascular disease were examined; 24 geldings and 12 females, aged 3-45â years old, weighing 130-262â kg. Left atrial to aortic ratio was larger in geldings (P=0.004). There was no significant difference for left ventricular M-mode diastolic diameter between females and geldings (P=0.121) after exclusion of one heavy female outlier. 2D measurements significantly increased with bodyweight including maximal left atrial diameter (R(2)=0.112; P=0.046), aortic diameter at various levels (e.g. annulus: R(2)=0.35; P<0.001) and the pulmonary artery diameter (R(2)=0.124; P=0.035). M-mode measurements were not significantly influenced by weight other than the left ventricular free wall in systole (R(2)=0.118; P=0.041). Age and heart rate did not have any significant effect on echocardiographic variables. This is the first UK study to report on echocardiographic reference ranges of sedentary donkeys across a wide age range and shows differences compared with reference ranges from working donkeys.

Echocardiography is widely used in veterinary medicine but it is not yet part of the clinical routine for wild animals. The objective of the present study was to assess the applicability of the echocardiographic exam in nonanesthetized agouti and to establish normal reference values for echocardiographic measurements in bidimensional mode (2D), M-mode, and Doppler for this species, and a lead II electrocardiogram was simultaneously recorded. Twenty agouti were used in this study. All the echocardiographic measurements were positively correlated with weight (P < 0.05), and there were no significant differences between sexes (P > 0.05). Blood flow velocities in the pulmonary and aortic artery ranged from 67.32-71.28 cm/sec and 79.22-101.84 cm/sec, respectively. The isovolumic relaxation time was assessed in all the animals and ranged from 38.5 to 56.6 ms. The maximum value for the nonfused E and A waves and the Et and At waves was 158 beats/min for both. The results obtained for the morphologic and heart hemodynamic measurements can guide future studies and help in the clinical management of these animals in captivity.\n\nEffects of sedation on echocardiographic variables of left atrial and left ventricular function in healthy cats.\n\nPubMed\n\nWard, Jessica L; Schober, Karsten E; Fuentes, Virginia Luis; Bonagura, John D\n\n2012-10-01\n\nAlthough sedation is frequently used to facilitate patient compliance in feline echocardiography, the effects of sedative drugs on echocardiographic variables have been poorly documented. This study investigated the effects of two sedation protocols on echocardiographic indices in healthy cats, with special emphasis on the assessment of left atrial size and function, as well as left ventricular diastolic performance. Seven cats underwent echocardiography (transthoracic two-dimensional, spectral Doppler, color flow Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging) before and after sedation with both acepromazine (0.1 mg/kg IM) and butorphanol (0.25 mg/kg IM), or acepromazine (0.1 mg/kg IM), butorphanol (0.25 mg/kg IM) and ketamine (1.5 mg/kg IV). Heart rate increased significantly following acepromazine/butorphanol/ketamine (meanÂ±SD of increase, 40Â±26 beats/min) and non-invasive systolic blood pressure decreased significantly following acepromazine/butorphanol (meanÂ±SD of decrease, 12Â±19 mmHg). The majority of echocardiographic variables were not significantly different after sedation compared with baseline values. Both sedation protocols resulted in mildly decreased left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and mildly increased left ventricular end-diastolic wall thickness. This study therefore failed to demonstrate clinically meaningful effects of these sedation protocols on echocardiographic measurements, suggesting that sedation with acepromazine, butorphanol and/or ketamine can be used to facilitate echocardiography in healthy cats.\n\nAn echocardiographic study of healthy Border Collies with normal reference ranges for the breed.\n\nPubMed\n\nJacobson, Jake H; Boon, June A; Bright, Janice M\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe objectives of this study were to obtain standard echocardiographic measurements from healthy Border Collies and to compare these measurements to those previously reported for a general population of dogs. Standard echocardiographic data were obtained from twenty apparently healthy Border Collie dogs. These data (n = 20) were compared to data obtained from a general population of healthy dogs (n = 69). Border Collies were deemed healthy based on normal history, physical examination, complete blood count, serum biochemical profile, electrocardiogram, and blood pressure, with no evidence of congenital or acquired heart disease on echocardiographic examination. Standard two dimensional, M-mode, and Doppler echocardiographic measurements were obtained and normal ranges determined. The data were compared to data previously obtained at our hospital from a general population of normal dogs. Two dimensional, M-mode, and Doppler reference ranges for healthy Border Collies are presented in tabular form. Comparison of the weight adjusted M-mode echocardiographic means from Border Collies to those from the general population of dogs showed Border Collies to have larger left ventricular systolic and diastolic dimensions, smaller interventricular septal thickness, and lower fractional shortening. There are differences in some echocardiographic parameters between healthy Border Collies and the general dog population, and the echocardiographic reference ranges provided in this study should be used as breed specific reference values for Border Collies.

Andrew; Blomqvist, C. Gunnar\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe accuracy of a new nongeometric method for calculating left ventricular myocardial volumes from two-dimensional echocardiographic images was assessed in vitro using 20 formalin-fixed normal human hearts. Serial oblique short-axis images were acquired from one point at 5-deg intervals, for a total of 10-12 cross sections. Echocardiographic myocardial volumes were calculated as the difference between the volumes defined by the epi- and endocardial surfaces. Actual myocardial volumes were determined by water displacement. Volumes ranged from 80 to 174 ml (mean 130.8 ml). Linear regression analysis demonstrated excellent agreement between the echocardiographic and direct measurements.\n\nEchocardiographic evaluation of thalassemia intermedia patients in Duhok, Iraq.\n\nPubMed\n\nMohammad, Ameen Mosa\n\n2014-12-11\n\nCardiac complications are among the most serious problems of thalassemia intermedia patients. The current study was initiated to address the latter issue through the study of the echocardiographic findings and correlate it with clinical characteristics of thalassemia intermedia patients in Duhok, Kurdistan region, Iraq. An echocardiographic assessment of 61 beta-thalassemia intermedia cases was performed. It included 30 males and 31 females, with a mean age 19.6âÂ±â7.5 years. The standard echostudy of two-dimension and M-mode measurements of cardiac chambers were done. The continuous doppler regurgitant jet of tricuspid and pulmonary valves were recorded. Left ventricle diastolic function was assessed by pulsed doppler of mitral valve inflow. To correlate the clinical with echocardiographic findings, patients were divided, according to tricuspid regurgitant velocity, into three groups (<2.5 m/sec, 2.5-2.9 m/sec and â¥3 m/sec). Tricuspid regurgitant velocity <2.5 m/sec, 2.5-2.9 m/sec and â¥3 m/sec occurred in 42(69%), 11(18%) and 8(13%) respectively. Comparing to other groups patients with tricuspid regurgitant velocity â¥3 m/sec were older and included more males. They had lower hemoglobin levels, but higher ferritin levels. Their age at diagnosis and the age of the initiation of blood transfusion were later. Most of them had significant exertional dyspnea. They also had relatively lower left ventricle ejection fraction values. Right ventricular diameter and right atrial size were larger in the same group. Tricuspid regurgitant velocity as a continuous predictor was associated positively with age, cardiac volumes and pulmonary regurgitation though negatively associated with ejection fraction. Echo-derived right and left side cardiac complications are not uncommon in thalassemia intermedia patients. Therapeutic trails targeting these complications are indicated, and echocardiographic assessment is necessary to be offered early for thalassemia intermedia.\n\nUse of Simpson's method of disc to detect early echocardiographic changes in Doberman Pinschers with dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nWess, G; MÃ¤urer, J; Simak, J; Hartmann, K\n\n2010-01-01\n\nM-mode is the echocardiographic gold standard to diagnose dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in dogs, whereas Simpson's method of discs (SMOD) is the preferred method to detect echocardiographic evidence of disease in humans. To establish reference values for SMOD and to compare those with M-mode measurements. Nine hundred and sixty-nine examinations of 471 Doberman Pinschers. Using a prospective longitudinal study design. Reference values for SMOD were established using 75 healthy Doberman Pinschers >8 years old with <50 ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) in 24 hours. The ability of the new SMOD cut-off values, normalized to body surface area (BSA), for left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV/BSA >95mL/m(2) ) and end-systolic volume (LVESV/BSA > 55mL/m(2) ) to detect echocardiographic changes in Doberman Pinschers with DCM was compared with currently recommended M-mode values. Dogs with elevated SMOD values but normal M-mode measurements were followed-up using a prospective longitudinal study design. At the final examination 175 dogs were diagnosed with DCM according to both methods (M-mode and SMOD). At previous examinations, M-mode values were abnormal in 142 examinations only, whereas all 175 SMOD already had detected changes. Additionally, 19 of 154 dogs with >100 VPCs/24 hours and normal M-mode values had abnormal SMOD measurement. Six dogs with increased SMOD measurements remained healthy at several follow-up examinations (classified as false positive); in 24 dogs with increased SMOD measurements, no follow-up examinations were available (classified as unclear). SMOD measurements are superior to M-mode to detect early echocardiographic changes in Dobermans with occult DCM.

Echocardiographers initially focused on early detection of atrial geometrical abnormalities through monodimensional atrial diameter quantification and then bidimensional (2D) areas and volume estimation. Now, together with conventional echocardiographic parameters, new echocardiographic techniques, such as strain Doppler, 2D speckle tracking and three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography, allow assessing early LA dysfunction and they all play a fundamental role to detect early functional remodelling before anatomical alterations occur. LA dysfunction and its important prognostic implications may be detected sooner by LA strain than by volumetric measurements.\n\nEchocardiographic findings in stable outpatients with properly functioning HeartMate II left ventricular assist devices.\n\nPubMed\n\nTopilsky, Yan; Oh, Jae K; Atchison, Fawn W; Shah, Dipesh K; Bichara, Valentina M; Schirger, John A; Kushwaha, Sudhir S; Pereira, Naveen L; Park, Soon J\n\n2011-02-01\n\nContinuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have become part of the standard of care for the treatment of advanced heart failure. However, knowledge of normal values for transthoracic echocardiographic examination and measurements in these patients are lacking. All transthoracic echocardiographic examinations in 63 consecutive patients, performed 90 and 180 days after surgery with the implantation of a HeartMate II continuous-flow LVAD between February 2007 and January 2010, were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had to be outpatients at 3 and 6 months after surgery and considered stable on LVAD therapy (New York Heart Association class I or II and no need for inotropes, intravenous furosemide, or hospitalization). End-diastolic and end-systolic diameters and left ventricular mass decreased considerably compared with baseline measurements before LVAD implantation. Mitral inflow deceleration time increased (188 Â± 70 vs 132.5 Â± 27 msec, PÂ = .009) and left atrial volume (84.1 Â± 33 vs 141.7 Â± 62 mL, PÂ = .003) and E/e' ratio decreased (20.3 Â± 9 vs 26 Â± 11, PÂ = .01), all consistent with decreased left ventricular filling pressure. Estimated right ventricular (RV) and right atrial pressure decreased significantly (34.1 Â± 10 vs 51.7 Â± 14 mm Hg and 9.5 Â± 5 vs 14.4 Â± 5 mm Hg, respectively, P < .0001 for both). Quantitatively estimated RV function (PÂ = .02), RV fractional area change (27.9 Â± 10% vs 37.4 Â± 10.9%, P < .0001), and the RV index of myocardial performance (0.32 Â± 0.1 vs 0.65 Â± 0.2 vs 0.32 Â± .01, P < .0001) improved, suggesting improved RV efficiency. LVAD therapy resulted in significant decreases in the severity of mitral regurgitation. Tricuspid regurgitation improved in patients who had concurrent tricuspid surgical correction and was unchanged otherwise. Aortic regurgitation severity increased 3Â months after LVAD implantation. There were no significant differences in any of the echocardiographic parameters in the 6-month\n\nEchocardiographic reference ranges for normal left atrial function parameters: results from the EACVI NORRE study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSugimoto, Tadafumi; Robinet, SÃ©bastien; Dulgheru, Raluca; Bernard, Anne; Ilardi, Federica; Contu, Laura; Addetia, Karima; Caballero, Luis; Kacharava, George; Athanassopoulos, George D; Barone, Daniele; Baroni, Monica; Cardim, Nuno; Hagendorff, Andreas; Hristova, Krasimira; Lopez, Teresa; de la Morena, Gonzalo; Popescu, Bogdan A; Penicka, Martin; Ozyigit, Tolga; Rodrigo Carbonero, Jose David; van de Veire, Nico; Von Bardeleben, Ralph Stephan; Vinereanu, Dragos; Zamorano, Jose Luis; Go, Yun Yun; Marchetta, Stella; Nchimi, Alain; Rosca, Monica; Calin, Andreea; Moonen, Marie; Cimino, Sara; Magne, Julien; Cosyns, Bernard; Galli, Elena; Donal, Erwan; Habib, Gilbert; Esposito, Roberta; Galderisi, Maurizio; Badano, Luigi P; Lang, Roberto M; Lancellotti, Patrizio\n\n2018-06-01\n\nTo obtain the normal ranges for echocardiographic measurements of left atrial (LA) function from a large group of healthy volunteers accounting for age and gender. A total of 371 (median age 45âyears) healthy subjects were enrolled at 22 collaborating institutions collaborating in the Normal Reference Ranges for Echocardiography (NORRE) study of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI). Left atrial data sets were analysed with a vendor-independent software (VIS) package allowing homogeneous measurements irrespective of the echocardiographic equipment used to acquire data sets. The lowest expected values of LA function were 26.1%, 48.7%, and 41.4% for left atrial strain (LAS), 2D left atrial emptying fraction (LAEF), and 3D LAEF (reservoir function); 7.7%, 24.2%, and -0.53/s for LAS-active, LAEF-active, and LA strain rate during LA contraction (SRa) (pump function) and 12.0% and 21.6% for LAS-passive and LAEF-passive (conduit function). Left atrial reservoir and conduit function were decreased with age while pump function was increased. All indices of reservoir function and all LA strains had no difference in both gender and vendor. However, inter-vendor differences were observed in LA SRa despite the use of VIS. The NORRE study provides contemporary, applicable echocardiographic reference ranges for LA function. Our data highlight the importance of age-specific reference values for LA functions.\n\nEchocardiographic left ventricular masses in distance runners and weight lifters\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLonghurst, J. C.; Gonyea, W. J.; Mitchell, J. H.; Kelly, A. R.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe relationships of different forms of exercise training to left ventricular mass and body mass are investigated by echocardiographic studies of weight lifters, long-distance runners, and comparatively sized untrained control subjects. Left ventricular mass determinations by the Penn convention reveal increased absolute left ventricular masses in long-distance runners and competitive weight lifters with respect to controls matched for age, body weight, and body surface area, and a significant correlation between ventricular mass and lean body mass. When normalized to lean body mass, the ventricular masses of distance runners are found to be significantly higher than those of the other groups, suggesting that dynamic training elevates left ventricular mass compared to static training and no training, while static training increases ventricular mass only to the extent that lean body mass is increased.\n\n[Echocardiographic characteristics of the left heart ventricle in people with different somatotypes].\n\nPubMed\n\nSeebaluck, Sh; Babaev, M V; Kondrashev, A V\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to analyze echocardiographic parameters in 143 healthy individuals aged 18-21 years with different somatotypes. The evaluation of somatotype was performed using the the method of R.N. Dorokhov and V.G. Petrukhin (1989). During the echocardiography, left ventricular wall thickness, internal diameter and myocardial mass were measured. The investigation showed marked sex- and somatotype-related differences in left ventricular parameters. The correlations between the studied left ventricular parameters and body mass, length and surface area were demonstrated. The optimal method of the indexation of left ventricular myocardial mass as related to (body length)3, is described.\n\nEchocardiographic assessments ofÂ longitudinal left ventricular function inÂ healthy English Springer spaniels.\n\nPubMed\n\nDickson, D; Shave, R; Rishniw, M; Patteson, M\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTo establish reference intervals for echocardiographic measures of longitudinal left ventricular function in adult English Springer spaniel (ESS) dogs. This study involved 42 healthy adult ESS. Animals were prospectively recruited from a general practice population in the United Kingdom. Dogs were examined twice, at least 12 months apart, to exclude dogs with progressive cardiac disease. Mitral annular plane systolic excursion, tissue Doppler imagingÂ mitral annular velocities and two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiographicÂ left ventricular longitudinal strain and strain rate were measured. Intraoperator and intraobserver variability were examined and reference intervals were calculated. The potential effects of body weight, age and heart rate on these variables were examined. Intraoperator and intraobserver variability was <10% for all parameters except tissue Doppler imaging E' (the peak velocity of early diastolic mitral annular motion as determined by pulsed wave Doppler) and two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiographic variables, which were all <20%. Thirty-nine dogs were used to create reference intervals. Significant (but mostly weak) effects of age, heart rate and body weight on were detected. Reference intervals were similar to previously published values in different breeds. Breed specific reference intervals for measures of longitudinal left ventricular function in the ESS are presented. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Twelve healthy subjects performed a graded supine bicycle exercise test. Stable and good quality images of the left ventricle at rest and during exercise at different steps up to a maximum workload of 100 watts were obtained in all patients. Isotonic maximum exercise resulted in a significant increase in fractional shortening of the left ventricle, peak shortening rate, and peak lengthening rate of the left ventricular minor axis. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension decreased significantly. With increasing workload the pressure rate product increased significantly. It is concluded that transoesophageal M-mode echocardiography is a useful method of evaluating left ventricular performance during dynamic exercise.

However, no echocardiographic reference values are available for the Chinese children. We aimed to establish z-score regression equations for left heart structures in a population-based cohort of healthy Chinese Han children. Echocardiography was performed in 545 children with a normal heart. The dimensions of the aortic valve annulus (AVA), aortic sinuses of Valsalva (ASV), sinotubular junction (STJ), ascending aorta (AAO), left atrium (LA), mitral valve annulus (MVA), interventricular septal end-diastolic thickness (IVSd), interventricular septal end-systolic thickness (IVSs), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVIDd), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVIDs), left ventricular posterior wall end-diastolic thickness (LVPWd), left ventricular posterior wall end-systolic thickness (LVPWs) were measured. Regression analyses were conducted to relate the measurements of left heart structures to body surface area (BSA). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were calculated. Several models were used, and the adjusted R2 values were compared for each model. AVA, ASV, STJ, AAO, LA, MVA, IVSd, IVSs, LVIDd, LVIDs, LVPWd, and LVPWs had a cubic relationship with BSA. LVEF and LVFS fell within a narrow range. Our results provide reference values for z scores and regression equations for left heart structures in Han Chinese children. These data may help make a quick and accurate judgment of the routine clinical measurement of left heart structures in children with heart disease.

However, how we treat our patients and LVAD setting may affect the patient outcome beyond this period. We postulated that the presence of echocardiographic variables 1 month after surgery suggesting appropriate degree of LV unloading and an adequate forward flow would be important in determining clinical outcomes after the initial successful LVAD implantation. We retrospectively analyzed various variables in echocardiographic examinations performed 30 days after LVAD implant in 76 consecutive patients receiving continuous flow device for their association with a compound end point (90-day mortality, readmission for heart failure, or New York Heart Association class III or higher at the end of the 90-day period). The echocardiographic associations examined included estimated LVAD flow, with and without native LV contribution, interventricular septal position, the status of aortic valve opening, an estimated left atrial pressure (ELAP), the mitral flow E-wave deceleration time, and the ratio of deceleration time to E-wave velocity (mitral deceleration index [MDI]). Four patients died during the 30- to 90-day period, 6 patients were readmitted for heart failure, and 25 patients were considered to have New York Heart Association class III or higher at the end of the 90-day period. Variables associated with adverse outcome included increased ELAP (odds ratio, 1.30 [1.16-1.48]; P<0.0001), MDI <2 ms/[cm/s] (odds ratio, 4.4 implantation [1.22-18]; P=0.02) and decreased tricuspid lateral annulus velocity (odds ratio, 0.70 implantation [0.48-0.95]; P=0.02). A leftward deviation of interventricular septum was associated with a worse outcome (odds ratio, 3.03 implantation [1.21-13.3]; P=0.01). Mortality and heart failure after LVAD surgery appear to be predominantly determined by echocardiographic evidence of\n\nEchocardiographic predictors of adverse outcomes after continuous left ventricular assist device implantation.\n\nPubMed\n\nTopilsky, Yan; Oh, Jae K; Shah, Dipesh K; Boilson, Barry A; Schirger, John A; Kushwaha, Sudhir S; Pereira, Naveen L; Park, Soon J\n\n2011-03-01\n\nThe purpose of the study was to identify echocardiographic predictors of adverse outcome in patients implanted with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). Continuous flow LVAD have become part of the standard of care for the treatment of advanced heart failure. However, knowledge of echocardiographic predictors of outcome after LVAD are lacking. Overall, 83 patients received continuous-flow LVAD (HeartMate II, Thoratec Corporation, Pleasanton, California) from February 2007 to June 2010. The LVAD database, containing various echocardiographic parameters, was examined to analyze their influence on in-hospital mortality, a compound cardiac event (in-hospital mortality or acute right ventricular [RV] dysfunction), and long-term mortality. Eight patients died before discharge (operative mortality 9.6%), and another 15 patients were considered to have acute RV dysfunction immediately after surgery. Patients with relatively small left ventricular end-diastolic diameters (<63 mm) had significantly higher risk for in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83 to 0.99; p = 0.04) or occurrence of the compound cardiac event (OR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.84 to 0.95; p < 0.001). The most significant predictor of outcome was the decreased timing interval between the onset and the cessation of tricuspid regurgitation flow corrected for heart rate (TRDc), a surrogate for early systolic equalization of RV and right atrial pressure. Short TRDc predicted in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.97; p = 0.01) and the compound cardiac event (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.91; p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis based on a logistic regression model demonstrated that the accuracy of predicting the 30-day compound adverse outcome was improved with the addition of echocardiographic variables when added to the commonly used hemodynamic or clinical scores. TRDc predicted long-term survival, with adjusted risk ratios of 0.89 for death from any\n\nEchocardiographic Evaluation of Left Atrial Mechanics: Function, History, Novel Techniques, Advantages, and Pitfalls.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeischik, Roman; Littwitz, Henning; Dworrak, Birgit; Garg, Pankaj; Zhu, Meihua; Sahn, David J; Horlitz, Marc\n\n2015-01-01\n\nLeft atrial (LA) functional analysis has an established role in assessing left ventricular diastolic function. The current standard echocardiographic parameters used to study left ventricular diastolic function include pulsed-wave Doppler mitral inflow analysis, tissue Doppler imaging measurements, and LA dimension estimation. However, the above-mentioned parameters do not directly quantify LA performance. Deformation studies using strain and strain-rate imaging to assess LA function were validated in previous research, but this technique is not currently used in routine clinical practice. This review discusses the history, importance, and pitfalls of strain technology for the analysis of LA mechanics.\n\nStandardised imaging technique for guided M-mode and Doppler echocardiography in the horse.\n\nPubMed\n\nLong, K J; Bonagura, J D; Darke, P G\n\n1992-05-01\n\nEighteen echocardiographic images useful for diagnostic imaging, M-mode echocardiography, and Doppler echocardiography of the equine heart were standardised by relating the position of the axial beam to various intracardiac landmarks. The transducer orientation required for each image was recorded in 14 adult horses by describing the degree of sector rotation and the orientation of the axial beam relative to the thorax. Repeatable images could be obtained within narrow limits of angulation and rotation for 14 of the 18 standardised images evaluated. Twenty-seven National Hunt horses were subsequently examined using this standardised technique. Selected cardiac dimensions were measured from two-dimensional and guided M-mode studies. Satisfactory results were achieved in 26 of the 27 horses. There was no linear correlation between any of the measured cardiac values and bodyweight. There was no significant difference between measurements taken from the left and the right hemithorax. Six horses were imaged on three consecutive days to assess the repeatability of the measurements. No significant difference was found between measurements obtained on different days. This study demonstrates a method for standardised echocardiographic evaluation of the equine heart that is repeatable, valuable for teaching techniques of equine echocardiography, applicable for diagnostic imaging and quantification of cardiac size, and useful for the evaluation of blood-flow patterns by Doppler ultrasound.\n\nEchocardiographic measurements of cardiac dimensions correlate better with body length than with body weight or body surface area.\n\nPubMed\n\nMotz, R; Schumacher, M; NÃ¼rnberg, J; Viemann, M; GrafmÃ¼ller, S; Fiedler, K; Claus, M; Kronberg, K\n\n2014-12-01\n\nLooking after children means caring for very small infants up to adult-sized adolescents, with weights ranging from 500 g to more than 100 kg and heights ranging from 25 to more than 200 cm. The available echocardiographic reference data were drawn from a small sample, which did not include preterm infants. Most authors have used body weight or body surface area to predict left ventricular dimensions. The current authors had the impression that body length would be a better surrogate parameter than body weight or body surface area. They analyzed their echocardiographic database retrospectively. The analysis included all available echocardiographic data from 6 June 2001 to 15 December 2011 from their echocardiographic database. The authors included 12,086 of 26,325 subjects documented as patients with normal hearts in their analysis by the examining the pediatric cardiologist. For their analysis, they selected body weight, length, age, and aortic and pulmonary valve diameter in two-dimensional echocardiography and left ventricular dimension in M-mode. They found good correlation between echocardiographic dimensions and body surface area, body weight, and body length. The analysis showed a complex relationship between echocardiographic measurements and body weight and body surface area, whereas body length showed a linear relationship. This makes prediction of echo parameters more reliable. According to this retrospective analysis, body length is a better parameter for evaluating echocardiographic measurements than body weight or body surface area and should therefore be used in daily practice.\n\nLeft ventricular geometric patterns in newly presenting nigerian hypertensives: An echocardiographic study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAje, Akinyemi; Adebiyi, Adewole A; Oladapo, Olulola O; Dada, Adekola; Ogah, Okechukwu S; Ojji, Dike B; Falase, Ayodele O\n\n2006-01-01\n\nBackground Hypertension is a global problem and it is prevalent in Nigeria. Left ventricular hypertrophy is a major complication of hypertension with risk of sudden death and arrhythmias among others. Abnormal left ventricular geometric patterns also increase the burden of morbidity and mortality. It is therefore important to know the different left ventricular geometric patterns in Nigerian hypertensives because of their prognostic significance. Methods One hundred (100) newly presenting hypertensives (53 males and 47 females) and 100 controls (53 males and 47 females) were recruited for the study. All were subjected to clinical evaluation and full echocardiographic examination was performed according to the ASE recommendation. The relative wall thickness and the presence or absence of echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy were used to determine the various geometric patterns Results The mean age of the hypertensive subjects was 56.06 (Â± 7.68) years while that of the control subjects was 56.10 (Â± 7.68) years. There was no significant difference in the mean ages of the two groups. In the hypertensive subjects 28% had normal geometry, 26% had concentric remodeling, 28% had concentric hypertrophy and 18% had eccentric hypertrophy. In the control group, 86% had normal geometry, 11% had concentric remodeling, 3% had eccentric hypertrophy and none had concentric hypertrophy. There was statistical significance when the geometric patterns of the hypertensive and controls were compared (Ï2 = 74.30, p value < 0.0001). Conclusion The study showed that only 28% of the hypertensive subjects had normal LV geometric pattern while 86% of the normal subjects had normal geometry. There is need for longitudinal studies in order to prognosticate the various geometric patterns.

To document the Doppler echocardiographic characteristics of midventricular obstruction in some cats with HCM. Eight cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Retrospective case series. The medical records of cats presenting to the cardiology service at Colorado State University between February 2009 and January 2012 were reviewed. All cats had a physical examination; Doppler systolic blood pressure measurement; and transthoracic two-dimensional (2D), M-mode, and Doppler echocardiography were performed. A more thorough evaluation of the echocardiographic images and measurements was performed. Cats included in this study had echocardiograms of adequate quality to confirm the diagnosis of midventricular obstruction by documentation of left midventricular concentric hypertrophy; a midventricular turbulent Doppler color flow pattern; and high velocity, late-peaking flow at the area of turbulence. Cats with evidence of systemic hypertension defined as a systolic Doppler blood pressure of greater than 170 mmHg were excluded. All 8 cats had left ventricular hypertrophy at the level of the papillary muscles; left, midventricular hypertrophy; and in 4/8 cats there was apical hypertrophy or basilar hypertrophy of the interventricular septum. Color flow Doppler revealed turbulent flow in 8/8 cats and spectral Doppler (continuous and pulsed wave) revealed increased flow velocities and late-peaking flow profiles at the level of the left midventricle. Two of 8 cats had a bifid midventricular flow profile in which there was a midsystolic decline in left ventricular velocities with elevated velocities extending into early diastole. The peak left ventricular outflow velocity in all 8 cats was normal.

The aim of this study was to establish reference intervals for echocardiographic indices of LA size and function in Warmblood horses and to provide proof of concept for allometric scaling of variables and for the clinical use of area-based indices. Thirty-one healthy Warmblood horses and 91 Warmblood horses with a primary diagnosis of mitral regurgitation (MR) or aortic regurgitation (AR). Retrospective study. Echocardiographic indices of LA size and function were measured and scaled to body weight (BWT). Reference intervals were calculated, the influence of BWT, age, and valvular regurgitation on LA size and function was investigated and agreement between different measurements of LA size was assessed. Allometric scaling of variables of LA size allowed for correction of differences in BWT. Indices of LA size documented LA enlargement with moderate and severe MR and AR, whereas most indices of LA mechanical function were not significantly altered by valvular regurgitation. Different indices of LA size were in fair to good agreement but still lead to discordant conclusions with regard to assessment of LA enlargement in individual horses. Allometric scaling of echocardiographic variables of LA size is advised to correct for differences in BWT among Warmblood horses. Assessment of LA dimensions should be based on an integrative approach combining subjective evaluation and assessment of multiple measurements, including area-based variables. The clinical relevance of indices of LA mechanical function remains unclear when used in horses with mitral or aortic regurgitation. Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors.

However, echocardiograph-derived measures of LV twist may be compromised by nonstandardized acquisition of the apical image. This study examined the reproducibility of echocardiograph-derived parameters of apical twist mechanics at multiple levels of the apical myocardium. Two sets of 2D LV parasternal short-axis images were obtained in 30 healthy subjects (24 men; 19-57 year) via echocardiography. Images were acquired immediately distal to the papillary muscles (apical image 1), immediately above the point of LV cavity obliteration at end systole (apical image 3), and midway between apical image 1 and apical image 3 (apical image 2). Repeat scans were performed within 1 hour, and twist mechanics (rotation and rotation rate) were calculated via frame-by-frame tracking of natural acoustic echocardiographic markers (speckle tracking). The magnitude of apical rotation increased progressively toward the apex (apical image 1: 4.2 Â± 2.1Â°, apical image 2: 7.2 Â± 3.9Â°, apical image 3: 11.8 Â± 4.6Â°). apical images 1, 2, and 3 each had moderate to good correlations between repeat scans (ICC: 0.531-0.856). When apical images 1, 2, and 3 were averaged, rotation was 7.7 Â± 2.7Â° and between-scan correlation was excellent (ICC: 0.910). Similar results were observed for systolic and diastolic rotation rates. Averaging multiple standardized apical images, tending progressively toward the apex, generated the most reproducible rotation indices and may be optimal for the assessment of LV twist mechanics across therapeutic, interventional, and research studies; however, care should be taken given the influence of acquisition level on the magnitude of apical rotation.

Echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular (LV) dimensions, LV mass index, left atrial size and cardiac index were made. Detailed measures of systolic and diastolic ventricular function were made including tissue Doppler imaging. Patients were stratified by body mass index â¤10th percentile (ANââ¤â10th) and >10th percentile (ANâ>â10th). Ninety-five AN patients and 58 controls were included. AN and ANââ¤â10th groups had reduced LV dimensions, LV mass index, left atrial size and cardiac index compared with controls. There were no differences between groups in measures of systolic function. Measures of diastolic tissue Doppler imaging were decreased in AN and ANââ¤â10th. No differences in echocardiographic measurements existed between controls and ANâ>â10th. Female adolescents with AN have preserved systolic function and abnormalities of diastolic ventricular function. ANââ¤â10th may be a higher risk group.

Moreover, the number of pharmacological studies performed in mice is high. Phenotypic characterization of these mouse models also requires the examination of cardiac function and morphology. Echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are commonly used approaches to characterize cardiac function and morphology in mice. Echocardiographic and MRI equipment specialized for use in small rodents isÂ expensive and requires a dedicated space. This protocol describes cardiac measurements in mice using a clinical echocardiographic system with a 15 MHz human vascular probe. Measurements are performed on anesthetized adult mice. At least three image sequences are recorded and analyzed for each animal in M-mode in the parasternal short-axis view. Afterwards, cardiac histological examination is performed, and cardiomyocyte diameters are determined on hematoxylin-eosin- or wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-stained paraffin sections. Vessel density is determined morphometrically after Pecam-1 immunostaining. The protocol has been applied successfully to pharmacological studies and different genetic animal models under baseline conditions, as well as after experimental myocardial infarction by the permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). In our experience, echocardiographic investigation is limited to anesthetized animals and is feasible in adult mice weighing at least 25 g.\n\nThree-Dimensional Echocardiographic Assessment of Left Heart Chamber Size and Function with Fully Automated Quantification Software in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.\n\nPubMed\n\nOtani, Kyoko; Nakazono, Akemi; Salgo, Ivan S; Lang, Roberto M; Takeuchi, Masaaki\n\n2016-10-01\n\nEchocardiographic determination of left heart chamber volumetric parameters by using manual tracings during multiple beats is tedious in atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of fully automated left chamber quantification software with single-beat three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiographic data sets in patients with AF. Single-beat full-volume three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiographic data sets were prospectively acquired during consecutive multiple cardiac beats (â¥10 beats) in 88 patients with AF. In protocol 1, left ventricular volumes, left ventricular ejection fraction, and maximal left atrial volume were validated using automated quantification against the manual tracing method in identical beats in 10 patients. In protocol 2, automated quantification-derived averaged values from multiple beats were compared with the corresponding values obtained from the indexed beat in all patients. Excellent correlations of left chamber parameters between automated quantification and the manual method were observed (rÂ =Â 0.88-0.98) in protocol 1. The time required for the analysis with the automated quantification method (5Â min) was significantly less compared with the manual method (27Â min) (PÂ <Â .0001). In protocol 2, there were excellent linear correlations between the averaged left chamber parameters and the corresponding values obtained from the indexed beat (rÂ =Â 0.94-0.99), and test-retest variability of left chamber parameters was low (3.5%-4.8%). Three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography with fully automated quantification software is a rapid and reliable way to measure averaged values of left heart chamber parameters during multiple consecutive beats. Thus, it is a potential new approach for left chamber quantification in patients with AF in daily routine practice. Copyright Â© 2016 American Society of Echocardiography. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, it has been unclear of which examination and evaluate article possess the best accuracy for the MR severity. The present research aims to establish the echocardiographic estimation equation of LAP that is well applicable for clinical MR dogs. After the chordae tendineae rupture was experimentally induced via left atriotomy in six healthy beagle dogs (three males and three females, two years old, weighing between 9.8 to 12.8 kg), a radio telemetry transmitter catheter was inserted, which allows the continuous recordings of LAP without the use of sedation. Approximately 5 weeks after the surgery, echocardiographic examination, indirect blood pressure measurement, measurement of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and LAP measurement by way of the radio telemetry system was performed simultaneously. Subsequently, simple linear regression equations between LAP and each variable were obtained, and the equations were evaluated whether to be applicable for clinical MR dogs. As a result, the ratio of early diastolic mitral flow to early diastolic lateral mitral annulus velocity (E/Ea) had the strongest correlation as maximum LAP=7.03*(E/Ea)-54.86 (r=0.74), and as mean LAP=4.94*(E/Ea)-40.37 (r=0.70) among the all variables. Therefore, these two equations associated with E/Ea should bring more precise and instant estimations of maximum and mean LAP in clinical MR dogs.\n\nCharacteristics of Responders to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy: The Impact of Echocardiographic Left Ventricular Volume\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPark, Mi Young; Altman, Robert K.; Orencole, Mary; Kumar, Prabhat; Parks, Kimberly A.; Heist, Kevin E.; Singh, Jagmeet P.; Picard, Michael H.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSummary Background One third of patients who receive cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) are classified as nonresponders. Characteristics of responders to CRT have been studied in multiple clinical trials. Hypothesis We aimed to examine characteristics of CRT responders in a routine clinical practice. Method One hundred and twenty five patients were examined retrospectively from a multidisciplinary CRT clinic program. Echocardiographic CRT response was defined as a decrease in left ventricular (LV) end systolic volume (ESV) of â¥ 15% and/or absolute increase of 5% in LV ejection fraction (EF) at 6 month visit. Results There were 81 responders and 44 nonresponders. By univariate analyses, female gender, nonischemic cardiomyopathy etiology, baseline QRS duration, the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) index predicted CRT response. However, multivariate analysis demonstrated only QRS duration, LBBB and LVEDV index were independent predictors (QRS width: Odd ratio [OR] 1.027, 95% CI 1.004 â 1.050, p = 0.023; LBBB: OR 3.568, 95% CI 1.284 â 9.910, p=0.015; LV EDV index: OR 0.970, 95% CI 0.953 â 0.987, p= 0.001). While female gender and nonischemic etiology were associated with an improved CRT response on univariate analyses, after adjusting for LV volumes, they were not independent predictors. Conclusion QRS width, LBBB and LVEDV index are independent predictors for echocardiographic CRT response. Previously reported differences in CRT response for gender and cardiomyopathy etiology are associated with differences in baseline LV volumes in our clinical practice.

Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed severe atrial and moderate left ventricular dilatation; severely reduced mitral valve opening excursion; doming of the cranial mitral valve leaflet into the left ventricle during diastole; thickened, nodular cranial mitral valve leaflets; and reduced mitral valve orifice. M-mode echocardiographic findings additionally indicated greatly diminished mitral valve E to F slope and abnormal caudal mitral valve leaflet motion. Color flow Doppler imaging revealed bright bursts of color with aliasing originating from the stenotic mitral valve orifice, extending into the left atrium during systole, and into the left atrium during diastole. Spectral Doppler recordings revealed transvalvular mitral valve gradients and prolonged pressure half-times. Necropsy performed on 1 dog revealed extremely thickened, nodular, and stiff mitral valves with short, thickened, and fused chordae tendineae. The diagnosis of mitral valve stenosis was easily facilitated with diagnostic ultrasonography.\n\nFocused review on transthoracic echocardiographic assessment of patients with continuous axial left ventricular assist devices.\n\nPubMed\n\nTopilsky, Yan; Maltais, Simon; Oh, Jae K; Atchison, Fawn W; Perrault, Louis P; Carrier, Michel; Park, Soon J\n\n2011-02-08\n\nLeft ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are systems for mechanical support for patients with end-stage heart failure.

Objective To correlate echocardiographic parameters with the endpoint cardiovascular mortality in patients with ejection fraction < 35%. Methods Study with retrospective analysis of pre-specified echocardiographic parameters prospectively collected from 60 patients included in the Multicenter Randomized Trial of Cell Therapy in Patients with Heart Diseases (Estudo MulticÃªntrico Randomizado de Terapia Celular em Cardiopatias) - Chagas heart disease arm. The following parameters were collected: left ventricular systolic and diastolic diameters and volumes; ejection fraction; left atrial diameter; left atrial volume; indexed left atrial volume; systolic pulmonary artery pressure; integral of the aortic flow velocity; myocardial performance index; rate of increase of left ventricular pressure; isovolumic relaxation time; E, A, Em, Am and Sm wave velocities; E wave deceleration time; E/A and E/Em ratios; and mitral regurgitation. Results In the mean 24.18-month follow-up, 27 patients died. The mean ejection fraction was 26.6 Â± 5.34%.

The indexed left atrial volume was an independent predictor in relation to the endpoint, and values > 70.71 mL/m2 were associated with a significant increase in mortality (log rank p < 0.0001).

In 44 neonates with a closed duct and 29 neonates with an open ductus arteriosus a complete echocardiographic study including Doppler investigations of the mitral inflow signals and analysis of diastolic time intervals was performed. Neonates with an open duct had a lower median gestational age (27.1 vs. 29, P<0.01), a higher cardiac index (425 vs. 260 ml/min/kg, P<0.001), and a different M-mode left atrial to aortic diameter ratio (1.36 vs. 0.79, P<0.001), but birth weight, age at examination (6.6 vs. 7.9 days), and heart rate were similar compared to the neonates with a closed duct. Main differences in diastolic indexes existed in early and atrial filling integrals and peak velocities, early filling acceleration time, and isovolumic relaxation time. Most informative in neonates with an open ductus peak early filling velocity (41.2 vs. 30.4 cm, P<0.01) and peak atrial filling velocity (49.2 vs. 35.9, P<0.001) are higher, and isovolumic relaxation time is shorter (45 vs. 53 ms, P<0.001) than in closed duct peers. Isovolumic relaxation time is inversely correlated with the cardiac index (R = -0.78). These parameter changes can be interpreted as incipient left ventricular diastolic failure in extremely low birth weight infants in the presence of a preload challenge. The coincidence of higher peak velocities with a shortened isovolumic relaxation time is very likely a result of left atrial pressure elevation. Preload mismatch has to be considered in preterm infants with a persistent ductus arteriosus. The results of this study can be helpful to find the indication for PDA-closure and to adjust volume replacement therapy, and catecholamine medication to a level appropriate for the individual cardiac performance.\n\nAssessment of left ventricular mass in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by real-time three-dimensional echocardiography using single-beat capture image.\n\nPubMed\n\nChang, Sung-A; Kim, Hyung-Kwan; Lee, Sang-Chol; Kim, Eun-Young; Hahm, Seung-Hee; Kwon, Oh Min; Park, Seung Woo; Choe, Yeon Hyeon; Oh, Jae K\n\n2013-04-01\n\nLeft ventricular (LV) mass is an important prognostic indicator in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Although LV mass can be easily calculated using conventional echocardiography, it is based on geometric assumptions and has inherent limitations in asymmetric left ventricles. Real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic (RT3DE) imaging with single-beat capture provides an opportunity for the accurate estimation of LV mass. The aim of this study was to validate this new technique for LV mass measurement in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Sixty-nine patients with adequate two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional echocardiographic image quality underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and echocardiography on the same day. Real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic images were acquired using an Acuson SC2000 system, and CMR-determined LV mass was considered the reference standard. Left ventricular mass was derived using the formula of the American Society of Echocardiography (M-mode mass), the 2D-based truncated ellipsoid method (2D mass), and the RT3DE technique (RT3DE mass). The mean time for RT3DE analysis was 5.85 Â± 1.81 min. Intraclass correlation analysis showed a close relationship between RT3DE and CMR LV mass (r = 0.86, P < .0001). However, LV mass by the M-mode or 2D technique showed a smaller intraclass correlation coefficient compared with CMR-determined mass (r = 0.48, P = .01, and r = 0.71, P < .001, respectively). Bland-Altman analysis showed reasonable limits of agreement between LV mass by RT3DE imaging and by CMR, with a smaller positive bias (19.5 g [9.1%]) compared with that by the M-mode and 2D methods (-35.1 g [-20.2%] and 30.6 g [17.6%], respectively). RT3DE measurement of LV mass using the single-beat capture technique is practical and more accurate than 2D or M-mode LV mass in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of M-mode echocardiography for IABP timing in a neonatal piglet model. Two groups of piglets underwent mitral valve avulsion to create a model of shock. Group 1 (n = 8; mean weight, 7.7+/-1.8 kg) underwent IABP timed with both the ascending aortic pressure and M-mode echocardiogram. Group 2 (n = 6; mean weight, 7.5+/-1.4 kg) underwent two separate periods of IABP: one with echocardiographic timing and the second using standard timing points from the femoral arterial pressure tracing and electrocardiogram. Measurements included ascending aortic flow, left anterior descending arterial flow, ascending aortic pressure, left atrial pressure, and heart rate. Mitral valve avulsion produced a shock model with a significant decrease in mean aortic pressure and aortic flow and a significant increase in left atrial pressure and heart rate. Compared with the shock state, IABP in group 1 animals resulted in a significant increase in aortic flow (353+/-152 versus 454+/-109 mL/min; p < 0.05) and a significant decrease in left atrial pressure (23+/-6 versus 17+/-7 mm Hg; p < 0.05). Group 2 animals with echocardiogram-timed IABP had significantly increased aortic flow (365+/-106 versus 458+/-107 mL/min; p < 0.05) and mean aortic pressure (43+/-11 versus 52+/-8 mm Hg; p < 0.05). However, standard-timed IABP failed to show any improvement. In piglets with rapid heart rates, echocardiogram-timed IABP results in increased aortic flow and pressure and decreased left atrial pressure compared with standard-timed IABP.\n\nReference values of left heart echocardiographic dimensions and mass in male peri-pubertal athletes.\n\nPubMed\n\nCavarretta, Elena; Maffessanti, Francesco; Sperandii, Fabio; Guerra, Emanuele; Quaranta, Federico; Nigro, Antonia; Minati, Monia; Rebecchi, Marco; Fossati, Chiara; CalÃ², Leonardo; Pigozzi, Fabio\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground Several articles have proposed reference values in healthy paediatric subjects, but none of them has evaluated a large population of healthy trained adolescents. Design The study purpose was to establish normal echocardiographic measurements of left heart (aortic root, left atrium and left ventricular dimensions and mass) in relation to age, weight, height, body mass index, body surface area and training hours in this specific population. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 2151 consecutive, healthy, peri-pubertal athletes (100% male, mean age 12.4âÂ±â1.4 years, range 8-18) referred to a single centre for pre-participation screening. All participants were young soccer athletes who trained for a mean of 7.2âÂ±â1.1âh per week. Results Left ventricular internal diameters, wall thickness, left ventricular mass, aortic root and left atrium diameters were significantly correlated to age, body surface area, height and weight ( pâ<â0.01). Age, height, weight and body surface area were found associated with chamber size, while body mass index and training hours were not. Inclusion of both age and body size parameters in the statistical models resulted in improved overall explained variance for diameters and left ventricular mass. Conclusion Equations, mean values and percentile charts for the different age groups may be useful as reference data in efficiently assessing left ventricular parameters in young athletes.\n\nCalibration of echocardiographic tissue doppler velocity, using simple universally applicable methods\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDhutia, Niti M.; Zolgharni, Massoud; Willson, Keith; Cole, Graham; Nowbar, Alexandra N.; Manisty, Charlotte H.; Francis, Darrel P.\n\n2014-03-01\n\nSome of the challenges with tissue Doppler measurement include: apparent inconsistency between manufacturers, uncertainty over which part of the trace to make measurements and a lack of calibration of measurements. We develop and test tools to solve these problems in echocardiography laboratories. We designed and constructed an actuator and phantom setup to produce automatic reproducible motion, and used it to compare velocities measured using 3 echocardiographic modalities: M-mode, speckle tracking, and tissue Doppler, against a non-ultrasound, optical gold standard. In the clinical phase, 25 patients underwent M-mode, speckle tracking and tissue Doppler measurements of tissue velocities. In-vitro, the M-mode and speckle tracking velocities were concordant with optical assessment. Of the three possible tissue Doppler measurement conventions (outer, middle and inner line) only the middle line agreed with the optical assessment (discrepancy -0.20 (95% confidence interval -0.44 to 0.03)cm/s, p=0.11, outer +5.19(4.65 to 5.73)cm/s, p<0.0001, inner -6.26(-6.87 to -5.65)cm/s, p<0.0001). All 4 studied manufacturers showed a similar pattern. M-mode was therefore chosen as the in-vivo gold standard. Clinical measurements of tissue velocities by speckle tracking and the middle line of the tissue Doppler were concordant with M-mode, while the outer line significantly overestimated (+1.27(0.96 to 1.59)cm/s, p<0.0001) and the inner line underestimated (-1.81(-2.11 to -1.52)cm/s, p<0.0001). Echocardiographic velocity measurements can be calibrated by simple, inexpensive tools. We found that the middle of the tissue Doppler trace represents velocity correctly. Echocardiographers requiring velocities to match between different equipment, settings or modalities should use the middle line as the \"guideline\".\n\nColor M-mode Doppler flow propagation velocity is a preload insensitive index of left ventricular relaxation: animal and human validation.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcia, M J; Smedira, N G; Greenberg, N L; Main, M; Firstenberg, M S; Odabashian, J; Thomas, J D\n\n2000-01-01\n\nTo determine the effect of preload in color M-mode Doppler flow propagation velocity (v(p)). The interpretation of Doppler filling patterns is limited by confounding effects of left ventricular (LV) relaxation and preload. Color M-mode v(p) has been proposed as a new index of LV relaxation. We studied four dogs before and during inferior caval (IVC) occlusion at five different inotropic stages and 14 patients before and during partial cardiopulmonary bypass. Left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volumes (LV-EDV), the time constant of isovolumic relaxation (tau), left atrial (LA) pre-A and LV end-diastolic pressures (LV-EDP) were measured. Peak velocity during early filling (E) and v(p) were extracted by digital analysis of color M-mode Doppler images. In both animals and humans, LV-EDV and LV-EDP decreased significantly from baseline to IVC occlusion (both p < 0.001). Peak early filling (E) velocity decreased in animals from 56 +/- 21 to 42 +/- 17 cm/s (p < 0.001) without change in v(p) (from 35 +/- 15 to 35 +/- 16, p = 0.99). Results were similar in humans (from 69 +/- 15 to 53 +/- 22 cm/s, p < 0.001, and 37 +/- 12 to 34 +/- 16, p = 0.30). In both species, there was a strong correlation between LV relaxation (tau) and v(p) (r = 0.78, p < 0.001, r = 0.86, p < 0.001).

We sought to compare left ventricular diastolic function in acutely vs chronically hypothyroid patients vs euthyroid controls, and within individuals while on vs off T4. We prospectively performed such comparisons measuring pulsed-wave and color M-mode Doppler echocardiographic variables: early or late mitral peak velocities (E wave or A wave, respectively), E wave/A wave ratio, E wave deceleration time, isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), mitral flow propagation velocity (Vp), E wave/Vp ratio. Subjects comprised the acute HYPO group, 10 patients undergoing T4 withdrawal â¥ 6 months post-primary treatment for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC); the chronic HYPO group, 23 treatment-naÃ¯ve Hashimoto thyroiditis patients; and 21 healthy euthyroid controls. Subjects were adults aged â¤ 60 yr, predominantly female, with sinus rhythm; exclusion criteria were cardiovascular or thyroid disorder besides DTC (Hashimoto thyroiditis) in acute (chronic) HYPO patients or medication (besides thyroid hormone) affecting cardiac or thyroid function. Mean IVRT was significantly delayed and mean Vp, significantly slowed in both HYPO groups vs controls (p<0.0005), but did not differ between HYPO groups. These variables also were significantly impaired (p<0.05) within individuals when off vs on T4 (no.=8 acute, 10 chronic HYPO patients). Both HYPO groups had elevated mean E wave/Vp ratios vs controls, but the elevation reached significance (p<0.05) only in the larger chronic HYPO group. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is largely similar in acutely or chronically hypothyroid patients off T4 vs healthy controls or the same patients on T4.\n\nEchocardiographic predictors of survival in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nSargent, Julia; Muzzi, Ruthnea; Mukherjee, Rajat; Somarathne, Sharlene; Schranz, Katherine; Stephenson, Hannah; Connolly, David; Brodbelt, David; Fuentes, Virginia Luis\n\n2015-03-01\n\nTo evaluate vena contracta and other echocardiographic measures of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) severity in a multivariable analysis of survival in dogs. 70 dogs diagnosed with MMVD from stored echocardiographic images that met study inclusion criteria. Left heart dimensions were measured as well as mitral regurgitant jet area/left atrial area (JAR), early mitral filling velocity (Evel), extent of mitral valve prolapse in right and left views (ProlR, ProlL), Prol indexed to aortic diameter (ProlR:Ao, ProlL:Ao), presence of a flail leaflet (FlailR, FlailL), and mitral regurgitation vena contracta diameter (VCR, VCL) indexed to aortic diameter (VCR:Ao, VCL:Ao). Follow-up from referring veterinarians was obtained by questionnaire or telephone to determine survival times. Inter- and intra-observer agreement was evaluated with Bland-Altman plots and weighted Kappa analysis. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves, logrank tests and Cox's proportional hazards. Logrank analysis showed VCL:Ao, VCR:Ao, FlailL, ProlR:Ao, ProlL:Ao, left ventricular internal dimension in diastole indexed to aortic diameter (LVIDD:Ao) >2.87, left atrium to aorta ratio (LA/Ao) >1.6, and Evel >1.4Â m/s were predictors of cardiac mortality. In a multivariable analysis, the independent predictors of cardiac mortality were Evel >1.4Â m/s [hazard ratio (HR) 5.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5-10.3], FlailL (HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.9), and ProlR:Ao (HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-6.3). Echocardiographic measures of mitral regurgitation severity and mitral valve pathology provide valuable prognostic information independent of chamber enlargement in dogs with MMVD.

Their measurement is the most frequent reason for sending patients to the echo lab. These measurements have important implications for therapy but are sensitive to the skill of the operator. Earlier automated echo-based methods have not become widely used. The aim of our study was to evaluate an automatic echocardiographic method (with manual correction if needed) for determining left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) based on an active appearance model of the left ventricle (syngoÂ®AutoEF, Siemens Medical Solutions). Comparisons were made with manual planimetry (manual Simpson), visual assessment and automatically determined LVEF from quantitative myocardial gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Methods 60 consecutive patients referred for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) were included in the study. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed within one hour of MPI at rest. Image quality did not constitute an exclusion criterion. Analysis was performed by five experienced observers and by two novices. Results LVEF (%), end-diastolic and end-systolic volume/BSA (ml/m2) were for uncorrected AutoEF 54 Â± 10, 51 Â± 16, 24 Â± 13, for corrected AutoEF 53 Â± 10, 53 Â± 18, 26 Â± 14, for manual Simpson 51 Â± 11, 56 Â± 20, 28 Â± 15, and for MPI 52 Â± 12, 67 Â± 26, 35 Â± 23. The required time for analysis was significantly different for all four echocardiographic methods and was for uncorrected AutoEF 79 Â± 5 s, for corrected AutoEF 159 Â± 46 s, for manual Simpson 177 Â± 66 s, and for visual assessment 33 Â± 14 s. Compared with the expert manual Simpson, limits of agreement for novice corrected AutoEF was lower than for novice manual Simpson (0.8 Â± 10.5 vs. -3.2 Â± 11.4 LVEF percentage points). Calculated for experts and with LVEF (%) categorized into < 30, 30â44, 45â54 and â¥ 55, kappa measure of agreement was moderate (0.44â0.53) for all\n\nEffects of silicone expanders and implants on echocardiographic image quality after breast reconstruction.\n\nPubMed\n\nPignatti, Marco; Mantovani, Francesca; Bertelli, Luca; Barbieri, Andrea; Pacchioni, Lucrezia; Loschi, Pietro; De Santis, Giorgio\n\n2013-08-01\n\nUse of silicone expanders and implants is the most common breast reconstruction technique after mastectomy. Postmastectomy patients often need echocardiographic monitoring of potential cardiotoxicity induced by cancer chemotherapy. The impairment of the echocardiographic acoustic window caused by silicone implants for breast augmentation has been reported. This study investigates whether the echocardiographic image quality was impaired in women reconstructed with silicone expanders and implants. The records of 44 consecutive women who underwent echocardiographic follow-up after breast reconstruction with expanders and implants at the authors' institution from January of 2000 to August of 2012 were reviewed. The population was divided into a study group (left or bilateral breast expanders/implants, n=30) and a control group (right breast expanders/implants, n=14). The impact of breast expanders/implants on echocardiographic image quality was tested (analysis of covariance model). Patients with a breast expander/implant (left or bilateral and right breast expanders/implants) were included. The mean volume of the breast devices was 353.2Â±125.5 cc. The quality of the echocardiographic images was good or sufficient in the control group; in the study group, it was judged as adequate in only 50 percent of cases (15 patients) and inadequate in the remaining 15 patients (p<0.001). At multivariable analysis, a persistent relationship between device position (left versus right) and image quality (p=0.001) was shown, independent from other factors. Silicone expanders and implants in postmastectomy left breast reconstruction considerably reduce the image quality of echocardiography. This may have important clinical implications, given the need for periodic echocardiographic surveillance before and during chemotherapy.

There were more (p < 0.02) patients with AVS deterioration in group A compared to group B. Group A patients had lower left ventricle posteriori wall systolic diameter compared to group B. There were no differences in echocardiographic parameters between group C and D. Mean ejection fraction was lower and mean right atrium diameter was higher in group E compared to group F.

An experimental study using a cross-over design without randomization. Eight clinically normal Standardbred trotters. Echocardiographic examinations (two-dimensional, guided M-mode and colour Doppler) were recorded on five different days. Heart rate (HR) and standard limb lead electrocardiograms were also obtained. Subsequently, horses were sedated with detomidine (0.01 mg kg(-1)), romifidine (0.04 mg kg(-1)) or acepromazine (0.1 mg kg(-1)) administered intravenously and all examinations repeated. Heart rate before treatment with the three drugs did not differ significantly (p = 0.98). Both detomidine and romifidine induced a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in HR during the first 25 minutes after sedation; while acepromazine had a varying effect on HR. For detomidine, there was a significant increase in LVIDd (left ventricular internal diameter in diastole; p = 0.034) and LVIDs (left ventricular internal diameter in systole; p < 0.001). In addition, a significant decrease was found in IVSs (the interventricular septum in systole; p < 0.001), LVFWs (the left ventricular free wall in systole; p = 0.002) and FS% (fractional shortening; p < 0.001). The frequency of pulmonary regurgitation was increased significantly (p < 0.001). Romifidine induced a significant increase in LVIDs (p < 0.001) and a significant decrease in IVSs (p < 0.001) and FS% (p = 0.002). Acepromazine had no significant effect upon any of the measured values. and clinical relevance The results indicate that sedation of horses with detomidine and to a lesser extent romifidine at the doses given in this study has a significant effect on heart function, echocardiographic measurements of heart dimensions and the occurrence of valvular regurgitation.

We investigated the association between intraoperative right heart hemodynamic data, echocardiographic parameters, and severe versus nonsevere RVF. A review of LVAD patients between March 2013 and March 2016 was performed. Severe RVF was defined by the need for a right ventricular mechanical support device, inotropic, and/or inhaled pulmonary vasodilator requirements for >14 days. From a chart review, the right ventricular failure risk score was calculated and right heart hemodynamic data were collected. Pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi) [(pulmonary artery systolic pressure - pulmonary artery diastolic pressure)/central venous pressure (CVP)] was calculated for 2 periods: (1) 30 minutes before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and (2) after chest closure. Echocardiographic data were recorded pre-CPB and post-CPB by a blinded reviewer. Univariate logistic regression models were used to examine the performance of hemodynamic and echocardiographic metrics. A total of 110 LVAD patients were identified. Twenty-five did not meet criteria for RVF. Of the remaining 85 patients, 28 (33%) met criteria for severe RVF. Hemodynamic factors associated with severe RVF included: higher CVP values after chest closure (18 Â± 9 vs 13 Â± 5 mm Hg; P = .0008) in addition to lower PAPi pre-CPB (1.2 Â± 0.6 vs 1.7 Â± 1.0; P = .04) and after chest closure (0.9 Â± 0.5 vs 1.5 Â± 0.8; P = .0008). Post-CPB echocardiographic findings associated with severe RVF included: larger right atrial diameter major axis (5.4 Â± 0.9 vs 4.9 Â± 1.0 cm; P = .03), larger right ventricle end-systolic area (22.6 Â± 8.4 vs 18.5 Â± 7.9 cm; P = .03), lower fractional area of change (20.2 Â± 10.8 vs 25.9 Â± 12.6; P = .04), and lower tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (0.9 Â± 0.2 vs 1.1 Â± 0.3 cm; P = .008).

SUBJECTS--35 uraemic patients receiving haemodialysis (17 men, 18 women; mean age 60.3 (11.2); mean duration of dialysis 52 months) were selected from the 64 patients in Venice who were receiving dialysis; subjects with diabetes, haemochromatosis, valvar dysfunction, regional dyskinesias, and pericarditis were excluded. 19 control normotensive subjects (6 men and 13 women), matched for age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Echocardiographic measurements of left atrium, left ventricular end diastolic and end systolic volume, aortic root diameter, posterior wall and interventricular septum thickness, left ventricle mass index, and ejection fraction in controls and in patients according to whether they were normotensive (five men, eight women) or hypertensive (12 men, 10 women) on 48 hour ambulatory monitoring; left ventricular diastolic function by Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS--Mean systolic and diastolic pressures, daytime systolic and diastolic pressures, and night time systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly higher in the hypertensive patients than in the normotensive patients. The normotensive patients had similar blood pressures to the controls. Left ventricular mass correlated significantly with the mean diastolic pressure and mean night time systolic and diastolic pressures. Parathyroid hormone concentrations were similar in the two groups of patients. Diastolic relaxation was impaired to the same degree in the two groups of patients. Parameters of diastolic function showed no relation to left ventricular mass, which was significantly higher in the hypertensive than in the normotensive patients. CONCLUSIONS--Uraemia is likely to induce specific changes in the relaxation properties of the\n\nRight parasternal imaging: an underutilized echocardiographic technique.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarcella, C P; Johnson, L E\n\n1993-01-01\n\nIf the echocardiographer uses only standard imaging planes, he or she may fail to obtain vital information about the aorta, atrial septum, superior and inferior vena cavae, and the coronary arteries. The evaluation of caval-to-systemic venous atrial connections (Senning or Mustard) in transposition of the great arteries of systemic vena caval or right atrial-to-pulmonary anastomosis (Fontan) in tricuspid atresia and single ventricle may not be adequately seen when only the standard left parasternal, apical, subcostal, and suprasternal imaging planes are used. Therefore, the use of the right parasternal imaging plane may help to provide crucial information regarding these areas when the standard views are unable to delineate them adequately. The right parasternal window is an additional echocardiographic window that should become part of a complete echocardiographic examination.\n\nThe Infant with Aortic Arch Hypoplasia and Small Left Heart Structures: Echocardiographic Indices of Mitral and Aortic Hypoplasia Predicting Successful Biventricular Repair.\n\nPubMed\n\nPlymale, Jennifer M; Frommelt, Peter C; Nugent, Melodee; Simpson, Pippa; Tweddell, James S; Shillingford, Amanda J\n\n2017-08-01\n\nIn infants with aortic arch hypoplasia and small left-sided cardiac structures, successful biventricular repair is dependent on the adequacy of the left-sided structures. Defining accurate thresholds of echocardiographic indices predictive of successful biventricular repair is paramount to achieving optimal outcomes. We sought to identify pre-operative echocardiographic indices of left heart size that predict intervention-free survival in infants with small left heart structures undergoing primary aortic arch repair to establish biventricular circulation (BVC). Infants â¤2Â months undergoing aortic arch repair from 1999 to 2010 with aortic and/or mitral valve hypoplasia, (Z-score â¤-2) were included. Pre-operative and follow-up echocardiograms were reviewed. Primary outcome was successful biventricular circulation (BVC), defined as freedom from death, transplant, or single ventricular conversion at 1Â year. Need for catheter based or surgical re-intervention (RI), valve annular growth, and significant late aortic or mitral valve obstruction were additional outcomes. Fifty one of 73 subjects (79%) had successful BVC and were free of RI at 1Â year. Seven subjects failed BVC; four of those died. The overall 1Â year survival for the cohort was 95%. Fifteen subjects underwent a RI but maintained BVC. In univariate analysis, larger transverse aorta (pÂ =Â 0.006) and aortic valve (pÂ =Â 0.02) predicted successful BVC without RI. In CART analysis, the combination of mitral valve (MV) to tricuspid valve (TV) ratio â¤0.66 with an aortic valve (AV) annulus Z-score â¤-3 had the greatest power to predict BVC failure (sensitivity 71%, specificity 94%). In those with successful BVC, the combination of both AV and MV Z-score â¤-2.5 increased the odds of RI (OR 3.8; CI 1.3-11.4). Follow-up of non-RI subjects revealed improvement in AV and MV Z-score (median AV annulus changed over time from -2.34 to 0.04 (pÂ <Â 0.001) and MV changed from -2.88 to -1.41 (pÂ <Â 0.001), but\n\nLeft ventricular function by echocardiogram in children with sickle cell anaemia in Mumbai, Western India.\n\nPubMed\n\nTidake, Abhay; Gang"
