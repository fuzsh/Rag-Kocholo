Sci. Technol. Eng. Syst. J. 5(5), 1-10 (2020);\n\nView Description\n\nIn modern deregulated power industry, private sector has invested a lot to supply for extended power demand using the preexisting power system framework. This resulted into increased loading of transmission lines which has to work now to hit their thermal limits. The overloading of transmission line resulted in congestion and hence increase in loss of power in the system. One of the efficient ways to reduce congestion is by enhancing the available transfer capacity (ATC) of the power system. ATC enhancement can be achieved by application of FACTS devices. This paper presents an innovative method to mitigate congestion by locating TCSC in the IEEE 30 bus system. The allocation of TCSC is done by using ACPTDF sensitivity factors while the parameter setting is done by applying Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) method. The effective application of GWO is demonstrated in this paper to reduce active power loss, enhancement of ATC value with reduction of reactive power loss and to optimize TCSC size through a multi objective function. The suitability of algorithm is established through concerned figures and tables.\n\nRead more…\n\nMarianna Tomašková, Darina Matisková, Michaela Balážiková\n\nAdv. Sci. Technol. Eng. Syst.

The rate of spread of fires in agriculture depends on meteorological conditions, with large areas affected and potentially endangering the surrounding buildings, facilities. Access to fires is difficult and can extend to forests. Water is often lacking at the scene of a fire, which should be extinguished, and water sources are usually located over long distances. The paper addressed a specific example using a comprehensive method. The process of risk assessment in the work process was determined by the following steps: assessment of the overall risk of the work equipment, assessment of environmental impact, assessment of the person’s ability to manage risk, calculation of the resulting risk value, comparison of calculated risk value and acceptability of risk value, proposal of measures. The result of the analysis was the finding that the primary cause of the fire is the environment, i.e. high ambient temperature. The critical element in hay baling work system is the work environment. The risk ratio was estimated at 5.78. The level of risk was low due to the rapid intervention of the human factor. Based on the results, the technical measures mentioned in the paper were proposed to the operator. The paper found that maintenance of the machine is important for protection against agricultural fires, where the human factor plays an important role in the man – machine – environment system.\n\nRead more…\n\nRitesh Ajoodha, Benjamin Rosman\n\nAdv.

In this paper, we attempt to use the language of structure learning to address learning the dynamic influence network between partially observable processes represented as dynamic Bayesian networks. The significance of learning an influence network is to promote knowledge discovery and improve on density estimation in the temporal space. We learn the influence network, defined by this paper, by learning the optimal structure for each process first, and thereafter apply redefined structure learning algorithms for temporal models. Our procedure builds on the language of probabilistic graphical model representation and learning. This paper provides the following contributions: we (a) provide a definition of influence between stochastic processes represented by dynamic Bayesian networks; (b) expand on the conventional structure learning literature by providing a structure score and learning procedure for temporal models; and (c) introduce the notion of a structural assemble which is used to associate two stochastic processes represented by dynamic Bayesian networks.\n\nRead more…\n\nRohith Raj S, Pratiba D, Ramakanth Kumar P\n\nAdv.

Thus, there are several advantages of automated recognition of human facial expressions. The primary objective of the proposed framework in this paper, is to classify a person’s facial expression into anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise. Firstly, CLAHE is performed on the image and the faces are identified using a histogram of oriented gradients. Then, using a model trained with the iBUG 300-W dataset the facial landmarks are predicted. Using the proposed method with the normalized landmarks, a feature vector is calculated. With this calculated feature vector, the emotions can be recognized using a Support Vector Classifier. The Support Vector Classifier was trained and tested for system accuracy using the famous Extended Cohn-Kanade database.\n\nRead more…\n\nKhalid Chkara, Hamid Seghiouer\n\nAdv. Sci. Technol. Eng.

Terminals plays a strategic role on the oil and gas supply chain. There are three types of terminals: a fully automated terminal, a partially automated terminal and a fully manual terminal. To increase their efficiency and safety in a very competitive market, terminal companies might take the decision to invest in a supervisory control system DCS or SCADA. The advantages of DCS/SCADA systems are: improving the productivity and the proactivity, reducing cost, identifying quickly abnormal operating conditions and finally enhancing the efficiency and the safety. Due to the high cost of this project type, it is deemed vital to take the right decision when comparing the different options. The automation market offers multiple choices and opportunities, and taking the correct decision is a very challenging process. The key criteria for the technical evaluation are: 1) service offered, 2) interface capabilities,3) tender process efficiency and project execution, 4) after sales and product life cycle,5) references and finally 6) additional services. In this paper, the importance of each key criterion is identified and measured, leading to the development of a tool to be used for the assessment of different offers in order to successfully implement a supervision system. It consists of a framework based on a past experience of subject matter expert for a real case related to a successful implementation of a DCS system on a liquid petroleum storage facility. The paper provides as well a valuable feedback for vendors and can be used as a reference when preparing their commercial and technical strategy for future projects.\n\nRead more…\n\nAltamashuddinkhan Nadimalla, Siti Aliyyah Masjuki, Siti Asmahani Saad, Maisarah Ali, Shuhairy Norhisham\n\nAdv.

Concrete grade 30 (30Mpa) were produced with different percentage of M sand substitution ranging from 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by volume were selected as concrete mix design in this project. The strength for different percentage of M-sand incorporation was measured by the destructive test which are compression strength test and modulus of rupture test and non-destructive test which is UPV test for curing ages of 90, 28 and 7 days. Furthermore, the highest compression strength of concrete and modulus of rupture was found on the 90th day containing a proportion of 75% of M-sand as a substitution for natural fine aggregate. A novel empirical equations 1 & 4 are proposed for the relation of compression strength with the modulus of rupture and UPV.\n\nRead more…\n\nAziza Chakir, Meriyem Chergui, Johanes Fernandes Andry\n\nAdv.

In the considered protocol, all primary and secondary terminals are equipped with multiple antennas, and they employ transmit antenna selection (TAS) (at transmitter sides) and selection combining (SC) (at receiver sides) techniques to enhance the system performance. Relying on channel state information (CSI) of the primary-to-secondary interference links known or unknown, two efficient TAS/SC techniques are proposed for the secondary networks. Moreover, operating on the underlay spectrum sharing mode, the secondary transmitters including source and relays must adapt their transmit power so that OP of the primary network is not higher than a pre-determined threshold. Under impact of Rayleigh fading and co-channel interference, the end-to-end (e2e) OP and IP are expressed by exact closed-form expressions that are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. Then, both simulation and theoretical results are presented to show the OP-IP trade-off.\n\nRead more…\n\nZhongda Liu, Takeshi Murakami, Satoshi Kawamura, Hitoaki Yoshida\n\nAdv. Sci. Technol. Eng.

These ECUs are connected together with network protocols. The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is widely implemented due to its high fault tolerance. However, the CAN is a serial broadcast bus, and it has no protection against security threats. In this paper, we propose a fast stream cipher based on a chaos neural network (CNN) that is able to generate pseudo-random numbers at a high speed, faster than that of the Advanced Encryption Standard, to protect ECUs on the CAN bus by encrypting CAN messages. We discuss the chaotic orbit of the CNN and statistical properties of pseudo-random numbers from the CNN. For a stream cipher, it is very important to share the symmetric key. We designed a symmetric key that is shared with ID-based encryption without the need to use digital certificates. We evaluated our method’s performance with embedded boards and showed that the stream cipher is efficient for the embedded software of the ECU. Further, it does not need a hardware security module to accelerate the encryption.\n\nRead more…\n\nSushma Padubidri Shivaprasad, Sreemannarayanay Kulkarni\n\nAdv. Sci. Technol. Eng. Syst.

Universities are leading both in terms of generating R&D products and in terms of developing business activities. Now there is a problem of insufficient methodological support of technological universities for pricing R&D products developed and prepared for transfer to the business environment. Existing methods and models do not meet the needs of the market, which is growing rapidly. At the same time, the market is characterized by a high degree of volatility. The purpose of the article is to develop a method for modelling prices for R&D products from universities to the business environment, which takes into account: the specifics of the R&D product, modern market features for this R&D product; the nature of the transfer and commercialization of this R&D product. The article identifies the factors that determine the processes of transfer, commercialization and market launch of R&D products, which affect the pricing of R&D products. Groups of characteristics that characterize systematize these factors: 1) consumer value of R&D product; 2) market susceptibility of R&D product; 3) transfer and commercialization processes of R&D product. Justified a number of factor attributes within the formed groups and assigned them the values of linguistic terms for adjusting the price of R&D product using fuzzy set theory algorithms. The method takes into account elements of cost, revenue and comparative estimation approaches. The method makes it possible to adjust prices for R&D products, taking into account heterogeneous features in the composition of R&D products and compare them with market analogues of R&D products. This contributes to achieving a higher level of pricing accuracy for R&D products when they are transferred from the university to the business environment. The resulting prices are compared with market prices for competitive analogues, which makes it possible to determine the scenario of transfer and commercialization of R&D product; justify the strategy of market development of R&D product; increase the level of manoeuvrability of pricing management for R&D product. The model was tested on a number of R&D products developed at Lviv Polytechnic National University (Ukraine). Application of the proposed method is advisable in the short-and medium-term forecasting period.\n\nRead more…\n\nMbika Muteba\n\nAdv. Sci. Technol. Eng. Syst. J. 5(5), 94-102 (2020);\n\nView Description\n\nIn this paper, the performance evaluation of a line-start three-phase Synchronous Reluctance Motor (SynRM) with symmetrical distributed brass rotor bars is presented. The machine, which has been designed from a conventional three-phase induction motor (IM) NEMA frame stator is proposed as an alternative to a squirrel cage induction motor (SCIM). The 2D Finite Element Analysis (FEA) under ac magnetic transient solution was used to study some performance parameters of interest during starting transients. The experimental measurements were carried out in order to validate the numerical computation, to analyze the starting transients, and to explore the dynamic responses due to load variations. The FEA and experimental results of the synchronous reluctance motor with brass rotor bars (SynRM-BRBs) are compared to the results of a conventional three-phase SCIM of the same NEMA frame stator. The results evidenced that the reluctance torque developed by the SynRM-BRBs has a compounding effect on the accelerating torque, reaching its steady-state operational condition faster than the SCIM. The dynamic response of the SynRM-BRBs is faster in contrast to the SCIM during load variations. Furthermore, it was noted through measured results that the proposed line-start three-phase SynRM had a reduced dynamic no-load, and load current as opposed to the SCIM, thus positioning itself as a good candidate to replace the SCIM in applications that require a line-start ac motor with good starting transients and fast dynamic responses.\n\nRead more…\n\nSiana Halim, Andreas Handojo, Ivan Enrico Widodo, Felecia, Tanti Octavia\n\nAdv.

Therefore, a DF outbreak needs to be predicted to minimize the spread and death caused by it. The spread of dengue fever is a spatial problem. In this paper, we adopted the Multi Linear Perceptron (MLP) to solve the spatial problem, and we called it a spatial multi-layer perceptron model (Spatial MLP). In this proposed model, we consider two types of input neurons in the Spatial MLP, a region and the neighbourhood of that region. The spatial inputs dynamically change to the region. Additionally, the neighbourhood numbers of a region are also varied. So, the spatial inputs are changed in terms of the number of inputs and the neighbourhoods. As a result, the proposed model is outperformed the traditional MLP since it can adapt to the neighbourhoods. We can conclude the spatial MLP model can manage the information and predict the dengue fever outbreak in Surabaya\n\nRead more…\n\nHana Yousuf, Asma Yousuf Zainal\n\nAdv. Sci. Technol. Eng. Syst.

Decision making in any organisation is a challenging task since decisions need to be made based on the accessibility of data and its status, this becomes more challenging especially in large organisations that generate massive amount of information and data every single day.\n\nImplementation of latest advanced technologies like Big Data is imperative for any organization to make decisions which reduces time and pave the fourth industrial revolution. Even though this is vital in today’s business world, there are still few organizations that are hesitant to adopt it.\n\nThis paper illustrates the relation between Big Data and effective decision making by implementing a quantitative analysis through questionnaire. The conducted analysis is implemented using SPSS through correlational perspective, where percentage analysis, Chi-Square, correlation, and regression analyses are performed to obtain results.\n\nIt is clearly depicted that large organizations transition to adopt Big Data to aid their decision making, where medium and smaller organizations were slowly transitioning the adoption. In spite of this, most of employees, irrespective of the type of organization agree that Big Data is indeed a powerful advanced technology as they were satisfied by the organizational direction they have taken.\n\nRead more…\n\nDina Fitria Murad, Rosilah Hassan, Wahiza Wahi, Bambang Dwi Wijanarko\n\nAdv.

Many researchers have conducted studies on the use of recommendation systems in online learning. However, until now, several similar studies still focus on the accuracy of the prediction results. Various obstacles were encountered related to changes in the face to face learning process into online learning. This study uses the User-Item Collaborative Filtering method to predict student learning outcomes as a basis for providing recommendations to students. Data on student online learning outcomes were extracted using several methods as a basis for determining and assessing their learning outcomes. The dataset we use is dummy to match the original data. The findings of this study reveal that one of the reinforcing factors that affect student achievement in online learning is the quiz score. The students’ high achievement in the quizzes was also balanced by their active involvement during the learning process. Based on the evaluation of the recommendation system, it is known that the gradient boosted tree model is the best model for predicting the final score of student online learning with an accuracy calculated using the highest correlation of 0.7 and the smallest absolute error of 13.0 and root mean square error of 17.9. Based on the results of the evaluation, this study provides recommendations in the form of material links and learning archives that are useful for students to be able to carry out independent learning.\n\nRead more…\n\nJasril, Hilwan Yuda Teruna, Ihsan, Neni Frimayanti\n\nAdv.

Naturally, this filtering will improve the accuracy of any classifier, even random guessing. Based on this principle, this paper proposes a new classification approach using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and computational geometry (CG) algorithms. The approach is applied and tested on the recognition of isolated handwritten Arabic characters (IHAC). The main idea of the proposed approach is to direct CNN using a filtering layer, which reduces the set of possible classes for a query item. The rules of the relative neighborhood graph (RNG) and Gabriel’s graph (GG) are combined for this purpose. The choice of RNG-GG was based on its great capacity to correctly reduce the list of possible classes. This capacity is measured by a new indicator that we call “the appearance rate”. In recent years and due to strong data growth, CNNs have performed classification tasks very well. On the contrary, CG algorithms yield limited results in huge datasets and suffer from high computational time, but they generally reach high appearance rates and do not require any training phase. Consequently, the proposed approach uses an optimal architecture to exploit the advantages of the two techniques and overcome the computational time issue. Experiments carried out on the IFHCDB database have shown that the suggested approach outperforms a normal CNN and yield satisfactory results.\n\nRead more…\n\nPhie Chyan\n\nAdv. Sci. Technol. Eng.

A characteristic feature of the algorithm described here, is that it works without tokenizing the text and can avoid other data preparation steps, such as stemming and lemmatization. The text can be of arbitrary size, whether it is a single word or an entire book, it can be processed in the same way. Such approaches to text vectorization are not common in the machine learning literature. This sets the presented encoder apart from conventional text vectorizers. Two versions of the encoding algorithm are described and compared – the initial one and an improved version. The goal is to produce a robust data preparation procedure, capable of handling highly corrupted texts.\n\nRead more…\n\nHicham Moujahid, Bouchaib Cherradi, Oussama El Gannour, Lhoussain Bahatti, Oumaima Terrada & Soufiane Hamida\n\nAdv.

ARANz implements the authentication methods used with the original Authenticated Routing for Ad-Hoc Networks (ARAN) and enhance security and attain robustness by dividing the network into zones and introducing several local certificate authority servers. Using restricted directional flooding, ARANz reveals improved scalability and performance.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to discuss in details the misbehavior detection system used with ARANz protocol, along with presenting a detailed simulated security and performance evaluation of ARANz and other existing protocols. Through extensive simulation using GloMoSim simulator, a detailed security evaluation has been conducted to evaluate ARANz and compare it with the original ARAN and Ad-Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV). Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of ARANz in discovering secure routes within quite large networks including large number of moving nodes, while retaining the minimum packet routing load. Results also prove that ARANz has superior performance regardless malicious nodes percentage conducting different types of attacks such as modification, black hole, grey hole and fabrication. Hence, ARANz can be a good choice for Ad-Hoc networks established among students on a campus or peers at a conference, where pre-deployment of some keys and certificates is possible.\n\nRead more…\n\nLuluk Wulandari, Yuniar Farida, Aris Fanani, Nurissaidah Ulinnuha, Putroue Keumala Intan\n\nAdv.

In this paper, we provide an analysis of the generalized Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for data aggregation with a fully-distributed stopping criterion. The goal of the implemented stopping criterion is to effectively bound the algorithm execution over wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we analyze and compare the performance of the mentioned algorithm with various mixing parameters for distributed averaging, for distributed summing, and for distributed graph order estimation. The algorithm is examined under different configurations of the implemented stopping criterion over random geometric graphs by applying two metrics, namely the mean square error and the number of the iterations for the consensus. The goal of this paper is to examine the applicability of the analyzed algorithm with the stopping criterion to estimating the investigated aggregate functions in wireless sensor networks. In addition, the performance of the algorithm is compared to the average consensus algorithm bounded by the same stopping criterion.\n\nRead more…\n\nHaytham Azmi\n\nAdv. Sci. Technol. Eng. Syst.

Medical data classification is considered as a major research topic and numerous research works have been already existed in the literature. Presently, deep learning (DL) models offers an efficient method for developing a dedicated model to determine the class labels of the respective medical data. But the performance of the DL is mainly based on the hyperparameters such as, learning rate, batch size, momentum, and weight decay, which need expertise and wide-ranging trial and error. Therefore, the process of identifying the optimal configuration of the hyper parameters of a DL is still remains a major issue. To resolve this issue, this paper presents a new hyperparameters tuned DL models for intelligent medical diagnosis and classification. The proposed model is mainly based on four major processes namely pre-processing, feature extraction, classification and parameter tuning. The proposed method makes use of simulated annealing (SA) based feature selection. Then, a set of DL models namely recurrent neural network (RNN), gated recurrent units (GRU) and long short term memory (LSTM) are used for classification. To further increase the classification performance, differential evolution (DE) algorithm is applied to tune the hyperparameters of the DL models. A detailed simulation analysis takes place using three benchmark medical dataset namely Diabetes, EEG Eye State and Sleep stage dataset. The simulation outcome indicated that the DE-LSTM model have shown better performance with the maximum accuracy of 97.59%, 88.52% and 93.18% on the applied diabetes, EEG Eye State and Sleep Stage dataset.\n\nRead more…\n\nVikas Anand Vatul, Arputha Aravinth, Narayanan K, Gulshan Sharma, Tomonobu Senjyu\n\nAdv.

Bridging the gap between generation and demand is known as Demand Side Management (DSM). For an effective DSM strategy to be implemented, it is crucial that both utility and customers be involved. By DSM, the energy generated is used more effectively. This reduces the burden of the utility to invest on additional generation. In this work, a DSM strategy has been performed on two systems: (i) on RTS 24 bus system with wind energy sources distributed at some nodes of the system (ii) on an institutional load with installed solar power plant. A generic DSM strategy to effectively utilize the generated energy and to minimize the utility bills for the customer has been proposed. An instantaneous billing scheme has been proposed. By implementing the instantaneous billing scheme, customers can be persuaded to change their consumption behavior, matching the demand with available generation. The results obtained are promising, with a resulting flat load profile and reduced utility bills for the customer.\n\nRead more…\n\nOumaima Terrada, Soufiane Hamida, Bouchaib Cherradi, Abdelhadi Raihani, Omar Bouattane\n\nAdv.

One of these medical applications is the early prediction system for heart diseases especially; coronary artery disease (CAD) also called atherosclerosis. The need for a medical diagnosis support system is to detect atherosclerosis at the earlier stages to optimize the diagnosis, avoid the advanced cases, and reduce treatment costs. Earlier, the datasets are collected from specific medical sources and have evaluated against computer applications. In this paper, a supervised machine learning medical diagnosis support system (MDSS) for atherosclerosis prediction is presented that able to obtain and learn automatically knowledge from each patient’s clinical data. Therefore, we used three Machine Learning (ML) classifiers for the proposed MDSS for atherosclerosis. Thus, this work is accomplished using databases collected from the UCI repository (Cleveland, Hungarian) and Sani Z-Alizadeh dataset. The performance metrics were computed utilizing Accuracy, Recall and Precision. Furthermore, F1-score and Matthews’s correlation coefficient these measures were also calculated to greatly increase the proposed system performance. Additionally, 10-fold cross-validation methods have been used for proposed model performance evaluation that achieved 94% as the best accuracy average.

Thus, accurate fault diagnoses of bearing elements are essential for proactive predictive maintenance. However, the using of multiple sensors with high sampling rate reveal considerable shortages in the analysis of big data acquisition. Therefore, compressive sensing (CS) proposes in this study to overcome the aforementioned problems and support the fault diagnostic approach of ball bearing defects. The amount of data processed by CS technique can be significantly reduced to be more reliable for backup data. It can be a collaborative reconstruction method to compress the sampling data size and reliably exploiting similar sparsity structure of the acquired signal. Little attention has been paid for practically used sparseness of the CS converted signal in early fault detection of defects in ball bearing. Envelope analysis and CS technique are employed on experimental vibration data for fault detection in inner race and outer race of ball bearing. The results show that the reconstructed CS signal can characterize reliable features for bearing fault detection with some limitations in the range of compression ratio (up to 40%) and the selection of reconstructed sparse bandwidth. Hence, envelope analysis can provide optimal bandwidth to reconstruct the sparse modulated signal of ball bearing to overcome the limitation of the CS method.\n\nRead more…\n\nHuber Nieto-Chaupis\n\nAdv.

The change in behavior began in 2011 and is growing to this day, The comments that are growing on social media are very important for the online transportation company the negative comments lower the level of users while the good comments increase the users’ level. Thus, the comments influence the overall trust of their customers. Among social media, Twitter is a place where many people convey feelings of pleasure and displeasure timely, especially at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is becoming a serious outbreak. Through these “tweets,” many customers express their experience with the service. In this paper, we aim to analyze the experience of online transportation consumers using Support Vector Machine. The data were taken in two periods, i.e. April 2019 (“the normal era”) and June 2020 (“the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Class logging is done based on 3 categories namely positive, negative and normal, while in mining the data we labeled with the keywords @grabID and @gojekindonesia, 1618 data were obtained with a ratio of 1183 is normal era data and 435 data in the era of COVID-19 pandemic, The highest accuracy results occurred in the normal era with a ratio of 10% as test data and 90% as its training data on linear and sigmoid kernels of 0.8060 while the COVID-19 era only got the highest accuracy of 0.59 in linear kernels with a ratio of 60:40. This is a sign that the COVID-19 pandemic does not contribute to decreasing trust in the service.\n\nRead more…\n\nNhu-Tung Nguyen, Dung Hoang Tien, Do Duc Trung\n\nAdv. Sci. Technol. Eng. Syst.

For each experiment, three cutting parameters, including the workpiece velocity, feed rate, and the depth of cut, were controlled to change according to the experimental matrix. At each experiment, surface roughness and vibrations of the technology system in three directions (X, Y, and Z) were measured and analyzed. The surface roughness and vibration amplitudes were modeled as a quadratic function of workpiece velocity, feed rate, and the depth of cut. The General Reduced Gradient (GRG) algorithm and Harmonic Mean (HM) method were combined to solve the multi-objective optimization problem about the surface grinding process of 3X13. The optimized values of surface roughness and vibration amplitudes (in X, Y, Z directions) were 0.901 µm, 0.815 µm, 1.594 µm, and 0.599 µm, respectively. These results that were determined at the cutting conditions were workpiece velocity of 14.428 m/min, the feed rate of 5.789 mm/stroke, and cutting depth of 0.013 mm. By conducting the grinding process at the optimal values of grinding conditions, the experimental results of surface roughness and system vibration amplitudes were quite close to that one of the predicted results. This proposed approach can be applied to improve the machining quality of the surface grinding process of 3X13 steel.\n\nRead more…\n\nOnyeka, Festus, Edozie Thompson Okeke, Wasiu, John\n\nAdv. Sci.

One of the plate is clamped at opposite edge clamped and the other opposite edge simply supported (CSCS). The other of the plate is simply supported at the first and fourth edge, clamped at second edge and free of support at the third edge (SCFS). Direct variational method of analysis was adopted using strain-displacement expressions to obtain the direct governing equations for the determination of the coefficient of deflection and shear deformation along the direction of x and y coordinate. From the established equation, a new model for determination of the critical lateral imposed load of the plate is developed. The study revealed that: (i) as the specified thickness of the plate increases, the value of critical lateral imposed load increase (ii) the critical lateral imposed load decrease as the plates span increases. Numerical comparison was conducted to verify and demonstrate the efficiency of the present theory. The result obtained are in good agreement with those in the literature.\n\nRead more…\n\nChalinee Partanapat, Chuleerat Jaruskulchai, Chanankorn Jandaeng\n\nAdv. Sci. Technol. Eng. Syst.

The objective of this research is to find the best predictive model for coronary heart disease diagnosis. Three approaches are set up to achieve the goals (1) investigating the classifier algorithms that are most suitable for the Thai heart disease dataset in this study (2) exploring features analyzed to be the significant risk factors in the predictive model, both major risk factors, and socioeconomic status and (3) rediscretizing the predefined clinical values on certain major risk factors. In order to achieving the optimal model before incorporating with feature selection process, several classifier approaches are conducted in this experiment. The study shows that the most effective classifiers ranked from the highest accuracy are Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Multi Layer Perceptron. Support Vector Machine produces the highest accuracy of 88.18%, with respect to both major risk factors and socioeconomic factors. Moreover, when adjusted thirteen major risk factors and five socioeconomic factors altogether, the accuracy is proved to be better than conducting each one alone. To investigate the better predictive performance of our study, feature selection methods of both filter and wrapper groups are employed with exploring the hybrid models to identify the most relevant features for Thai coronary heart disease. Relief Attribute Evaluation with Bayes Theorem is proved to be the best one with the accuracy of 92.59%, classified by SVM. To prove the accuracy enhancement, we perform rediscretization model on predefined medical values to examine different physical and personalized information of each person which can be incurred the coronary heart disease in different situation. The findings found that equal-depth rediscretization values on 7 major risk factors as Obesity, Hypertension, age, LDL, HDL, Fasting Blood Sugar, and Triglyceride, influences and improves with the better accuracy than predefined values of 95.50% classified by SVM. Thus, this finding shows that the proposed technique definitely outperforms predefined values from medical field.\n\nRead more…\n\nImad El Hajjami, Bachir Benhala, Hamid Bouyghf\n\nAdv. Sci. Technol.

Prior to these development, power utility companies’ performance is low due to poor operational style that leads to inadequate revenue generation. Thus, the task before the privatized companies includes autonomy, high reliability operation and brake-even management. To achieve these goal, frequent outages and system collapses must be minimized. One of the methods of achieving this is using power flow to improve the reliability of power system which will subsequently improve other lacking factors. A developed software for Newton-Raphson power flow was tested with a known solution network and the results obtained are accurate and reliable. Therefore, this paper presents an application of this software on real-time transmission network. Nigerian 330kV transmission grid is considered as case study. The power flow analysis of this grid was carried out and the network operational parameters were obtained. These results are stated and carefully analyzed.

Especially in healthcare research, it is obvious to perceive the scrutinizing implementation of machine learning to warranty the rewarded benefits in early disease detection and service recommendation. Many practitioners and researchers have eventually recognized no absolute winner approach to all kinds of data. Even when implicit, the learning algorithms rely on learning parameters, hyperparameters tuning to find the best values for these coefficients that optimize a particular evaluation metric. Consequently, machine learning is complicated and should not rely on one single model since the correct diagnosis can be controversial in a particular circumstance. Hence, an effective workflow should effortlessly incorporate a diversity of learning models and select the best candidate for a particular input data. In addressing the mentioned problem, the authors present processes that interpret the most appropriate learning models for each of the different clinical datasets as the foundation of developing and recommending diagnostic procedures. The whole process works as (i) automatic hyperparameters tuning for picking the most appropriate learning approach, and (ii) mobile application is developed to support clinical practices.

It stems from the fact that these word representations consider the context in which a word appears. But until recently, very little attention was paid to the contextual representations in Arabic question classification task. In the present study, we employed a contextual representation called Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo) to extract semantic and syntactic relations between words. Then, we build different deep neural models according to three types: Simple models, CNN and RNN mergers models, and Ensemble models. These models are trained on Arabic questions corpus to optimize the cross entropy loss given questions representations and their expected labels. The dataset consists of 3173 questions labeled according the Arabic taxonomy and an updated version of the Li & Roth taxonomy. We performed various comparisons with models based on the widely known context- free word2vec word representation. These evaluations confirm that ELMo representation achieves top performances.

Fruit juice extraction is the act of wringing out the juice content of fruits by way of an effective processing and storage which enhance reduction in wastage. Fruit juices which literally have high antioxidants help in increasing serum capacity of the body and at the same time balances the oxidative stress and discomfort normally caused by high-fatty and sugar meals. The history of juice extraction dates back to the nineteenth century. The extraction of juice from its fruit has progressed tremendously from the old tedious method of squeezing to an automated juice extracting machine across the world, making it an essential tool for citrus farmers. Juice extractor machine are classified broadly into four types centrifugal, masticating, Triturating and Press juicers which may be operated manually or electrically. Many attempts have been made to extract oranges using both manual and mechanized means. Traditionally the task of extraction of orange is easy but time consuming. The manual still requires the operator to remove the pulps and the seeds while the mechanized is a whole automated process made easy.\n\nBoth mechanized and manual fruit juice machines discussed in this work is developed to provide an affordable and user-friendly machine. These machine models exist all over the world with very few becoming popular while the rest got fizzle out due to their limitations.

The spatial data of both parameters can utilize remote sensing technology, which in turn makes use of several vegetation indices to achieve accurate estimation. However, due to the rapid changes in rice plants’ characteristics, it is essential to study vegetation index utilization using a multitemporal method to improve its accuracy. Therefore, this research uses a multitemporal Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to estimate rice’s age and growth model. The multitemporal EVI patterns were observed to estimate the Time Early Planting (TEP) and the maximum EVI value of rice in an area. The results showed that the maximum EVI value in the rice fields of Demak Regency has a class range of 0.4 to more than 0.9. The highest value is in the class of 0.80 – 0.85 covering 12023.28 ha, followed by 0.75 – 0.80 at 11834.19 ha. Furthermore, the multitemporal EVI method on Landsat 8 images was used to estimate the rice age with accuracy or RMSE of 7.7 days.

First, the training data set for the fuzzy inference system is obtained using a proportional integral derivative controller. Then, an initial ANFIS controller is designed, where the integral control action is preserved in the multi-closed-cloop ANFIS for each quadrotor system state. Thereafter, scaling gains are added to the controller inputs/outputs, and a multidimensional PSO algorithm is used to tune all the control parameters. Besides, using a simulation example, the aerial vehicle performances are investigated in the presence of an unknown payload mass parameter. Specifically, the position tracking performances of the proposed multi closed-loop PSO-based ANFIS plus integral control strategy is compared with the classical PID, conventional ANFIS, and non-optimized ANFIS plus integral controllers. Thus, using the conducted simulation results, it results that the multi closed-loop PSO-based ANFIS plus integral can achieve perfect translational trajectory-tracking and ensure better attitude stabilization despite unknown quadrotor payload mass parameter. Therefore, the proposed new multi closed-loop PSO-based control strategy may be considered as an efficient controller when considering an arbitrary trajectory-tracking problem for the quadrotor system.\n\nRead more…\n\nRajesh Kumar, Geetha S\n\nAdv.

In third critical trial the co-pilot prolonged the response second ring to 8 seconds and the engines could not already take the plane up. It collided with a thick tree and made an upside down. Next it crashed on the ground and left a bloody trace of merely ~100 m long. This means that a mean acceleration at initial speed of 100 m/s and linear braking reached -50 m/s2. The real values could be even higher as the peak slowdown is always higher the mean. The clue of the Smolensk crash was then a fog and high azimuth error of radar.

In the first one, the right angle is in the top-left corner and the upper wall moves with positive horizontal velocity. However, in the second case, the right angle is in the bottom-left corner and the bottom wall moves with negative horizontal velocity. Unlike the classical form of square cavities, widely treated in the literature, the triangular form has a diagonal wall that affects the flow motion. At the moving wall, diffuse scattering boundary condition (DSBC) is employed while at the stationary sides, a combination of bounce-back and specular reflection boundary conditions (BSBC) is used. The computations are primarily performed in the slip and early transition regimes. The rarefaction effect, given by the Knudsen number (Kn) value, on the profiles of velocity components, is examined for both approaches. This study proves that for the higher values of Kn, the SRT-LBM approach cannot provide accurate results, particularly, near the inclined wall. However, the MRT-LBM approach confirms its validity even in the transition regime. A comparison with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results for horizontal velocity contours shows the efficiency of the MRT-LBM approach than the SRT-LBM one which breaks down for rarefied flows.\n\nRead more…\n\nMika Karjalainen, Tero Kokkonen\n\nAdv.
