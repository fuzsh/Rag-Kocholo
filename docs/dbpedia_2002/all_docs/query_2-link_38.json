        "text": "Dear Donna,\n\nit has been a few weeks since I returned from my Pilgrimage to Fatima, Spain and Lourdes. I had knee surgery shortly after my return so was unable to drop you a line until now. I did want to thank you and 206 Tours for yet another fantastic pilgrimage. Once again I was able to visit locations I heard about growing up and never imagined that I would ever have the opportunity to visit. My Tour Group included about 20 of us. A perfect number to travel with. It turned out one couple I had met in 2014 on the Holy Land Pilgrimage I took and 2 other ladies who were on the Rome portion of that trip were also part of this group. It was like a family reunion to come together once again and make more precious memories.\n\nThe Spiritual Leader, Father Luis was wonderful. A warm and very outgoing young Priest who walked with us and reinforced our faith and was able to add so much to our experience. I hope 206 uses him again. He took the time to spend time with each of us. What a blessing! I don’t have enough words to express how great our Tour Guide, Juan was. Such a nice young man with so much faith and information that he shared with us. Very caring about our needs especially those of us with medical issues. (It was unknown to me at the time I took the pilgrimage that I would be coming home only to have knee surgery but I had some struggles on the pilgrimage and he was so very thoughtful to warn me of possible challenges I might be facing incase I needed to make alternate plans). I appreciated this so very much. He did the same for others on the trip. Our driver was excellent. Always careful, on time to pick us up and left us amazed with his skills maneuvering a bus in tight spaces. BIG kudos to 206 for hiring only the BEST.\n\nThe hotels you chose for us were perfect. Such close proximity to the churches and places we were visiting that I never felt I was unable to visit everything I wanted. I was able to easily walk back and forth during our down time if I wanted to. I could go on and on about everything I loved about the Pilgrimage but I hope the fact this was my second trip with you is enough to express that. I am already looking at what might be my 3rd pilgrimage with you. Thank you and the rest of the Team at 206 for handling these pilgrimages with the care that you do. It is obvious it is a labor of love for you not just a job. Merry Christmas and blessings on you all.\n\nOphelia M.Gonzalez-Nix\n\nI want to let you know that we have so much joy with this trip. I am speechless with what 206Tours done. Let me start with my mom, who was the reason I booked this tour. On her birthday, my mom was so surprise with her birthday cake. I am so grateful that you did that. Second, with her age, 83, I requested the wheel chair and special care for her, We got the wheel chair in most needed airports, this is so helpful. she can’t do it without this. We got the special need hotel room, thank you. The wheel chair was also available in the bus. I can’t thank 206Tours enough for all these services. My mom was overjoyed and she still talking about how happy and how blessed she was during the trip. Note: my mom finally didn’t use the wheel chair provided in the bus. She decided to walk slowly and I was with her most of the times. Her happy spirit helped her to walk at the sites, though slowly. Second, Juan. I can’t stop thanking him. He really took care the group in DETAIL. His instruction is clear. Not only that, his knowledge about the place we visited is superb. He answered all questions we had. Also, he always check with me about my mom, how is she doing. When we were in Lourdes, he managed our own group night procession since we were already in November when we reached Lourdes. I love all the movie he played in the bus, very very helpful in understanding the background of the holy sites we visited. We can feel his faith and passion about these holy sites. He deserves 5+ stars. Thank you. Third, the drivers. We have 2 drivers. Both of them are excellent and helpful. But we love our driver from Lisbon to Lourdes, he is warm to the people and smile a lot 🙂 Fourth, the local tour guides: All are good, except when we were in the city of Avila, Spain. Her story and or explanation wasn’t that clear. I am sorry I don’t remember her name. Fifth, Father Luis, he is a joy for the group. I love his homily (I learn from it and it touched my heart). He is so humble, happy, funny and so warm to us. He cares about us. Sixth, the daily Mass in the holy sites. This is the highlight and really the joy of my spiritual journey. Seventh, the tour guide package you sent before the trip. It’s very good, so detail, very helpful. And I am grateful with 206Tours arrangement in regards to Tipping. Very helpful that we are not worry about tipping here and there, and very simple that we only prepare for the drivers and the tour guide. Thank you. Just a comment. It’s such a blessing we had a total of 21 people in the group (from Lisbon to Lourdes). I am happy as I think this is the right size. Note: With 206Tours, this is my 2nd pilgrimage I had. The first 1 one (about 3 years ago) was also about this size and it’s good. If it’s greater than 30 I think it’s too crowded. 206Tours will be in my first list for my next pilgrimage. I pray for 206Tours, that you continue helping the pilgrims reaching their holy sites beautifully. Pictures below: 1. My mom with her birthday cake 2. the group in Fatima.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMartha\n\nHello Bika,\n\nI would like to give you my feedback for our Israel and Rome Pilgrimage. I believe that my wife Christine (CC’ed on this email) may give you her impressions in a separate email. There were many great things to mention about Israel. We appreciated the local 206 Tours representative greeting and checking on us. We never felt uncomfortable and always felt and “were” safe. That was a very nice touch to have him spend time with us besides of course Jack! Jack, of course, was the Superstar!! We loved him and would always insist on being with him if we repeated this Pilgrimage. Jack’s knowledge, passion for this country and our faith, his wonderful personality, and manner made this a memorable experience. I got to the point where I was recording him on video as he is a font of knowledge and Faith. I would not want to forget his words. We would like to keep in touch with him via email. He should write a book as his knowledge and passion are very evident. Rev. Allen was also a standout for us. He is very priestly, human, open hearted, warm, and spiritually gifted. We had wonderful Masses and thoroughly enjoyed Father Allen’s company. We will stay in touch with him also! Some of our memorable Masses with him where “Mass on the boat on the Sea of Galilee” and “Mass on the Altar next to Christ’s Spot on Calvary”. Really pretty amazing when you think of it !! We also had a Storm with wind and rain appear after our Mass on the Boat. It was just like the Gospel stories. Once again amazing! When we reached the other side the sun came out. We, as a group of Pilgrims, bonded very unexpectedly. I can say we had a bond with every person in Israel to the point where we exchanged emails and phone with everyone. It was a special group and it was a family. We spent time with everybody and got to know everyone! We made some new friends that hopefully we will maintain going forward. The accommodations were excellent. The food was very good and the nice touch was the water and wine at the tables. The time we spent after dinner was very special. Instead of just eating and leaving, we would sit and sip wine and have a great time with each other. Very nice! We also enjoyed our lunches very much. We had some great “St. Peter’s Fish” at a local place. Very good! And the Lamb lunch was great. I think it was in Jericho. The restaurant name was something with mustache. The two owners had big mustaches. Of course everywhere we went we were warmly greeted due to Jack. I know Jack brings them business but you can see that they also loved Jack. Jack made this trip special! We shopped at two Christian businesses. One Glass and the other Olive Wood. We brought back some nice treasures. We also liked our Driver Joe very much. He was a great driver and an equally nice person. Joe had water for us for purchase and that was also a great touch. Summary – We would go back in a heartbeat! With all of the local struggles and problems, the profound nature of the Holy Land overshadowed any Political and Religion problems. We would also ask for Jack as our Guide without question!\n\nThe Tour Guides and local guides in Rome were very professional and caring. Massimo our driver was also very nice. There were two groups of Pilgrims so we did not have the ability to get to know many people especially in light of the short duration. There were others from our Israel tour who were with us. So we gravitated to them. Nonetheless it still was very nice. Our guides knew how to maneuver the crowds for the Papal Audience and were very beneficial as the logistics of the Rome visit were much more demanding due to the crowds. The local guides were very skilled with the Art and Museums. In addition a lesson of “crossing the streets in Rome” was invaluable. The dinner on the last night was very good as we had Opera Singers join us. Obviously the food in Italy was outstanding. All our meals were what I expected and more. The hotel Visconti was excellent including the Breakfast Buffet. The Art, architecture, and stone in Italy were amazing. Since we had two groups we had two priests. We especially liked a Father Kevin. A young priest from North Carolina. He like Father Allen in Israel, was very priestly and gave us spiritual directions that we will always remember, he was also was very likeable. At this point the only negative is being harassed incessantly by street vendors. This is in both Israel and Rome. It eventually got to be annoying. But when you look at their lives, you could understand why they do it as it is a means to support their lives and families. It made you stir up some patience. Overall, I would surely use 206 Tours in the future. Everyone who I dealt with was great and the sales associates took care of everything and were accurate is all ways. I appreciated our Pilgrimage very much and would highly recommend 206 Tours. We would like to visit Medjugorje eventually.\n\nThanks,\n\nTony\n\nOn arrival in Dublin we toured the city and we stopped for an extended period of time at Trinity College. Here we were able to view the Book of Kells, which contain a lavishly decorated copy, in Latin, of the four Gospels. Given its monastic history and its arrival in Dublin in the 17th century you get a real sense of the foundations of the Irish Church and its monastic roots. As a chaplain on any pilgrimage I have the priviledge of offering Mass in many beautiful Churches, Cathedrals and Basilicas. This was certainly the case as we travelled through the country. By the time we arrived in Killarney in my 3rd Mass I referenced a poem in my homily by the British poet Gerard Manley Hopkins entitled God’s Grandeur. The Ist line reads: “The world is charged with the grandeur of God.” This is certainly true of Ireland. The scenery was absolutely beautiful – green countryside, rolling hills and to top it all off we had sunshine the whole time we were there. God’s grandeur was powerfully manifest to us every day. The churches are magnificent, one towering over the other. Again we got a glimpse into the history and the faith of the Irish people. Unfortunatley in our ignorance we didn’t recognize a large framed portrait of St. Oliver Plunkett, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all Ireland. He was one of the brightest names in the Irish church throughout the time of religious persecution. He was martyred in 1681 and canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1975. Other highlights included the Cliffs of Moher a well know tourist attraction. Unfortunately not included in tours and pilgrimages are the Kilkee Cliffs in Co. Clare. The Cliffs are magnificent. This was a welcomed surprise detour. Here one not only gets a sense of the slow workings of God as we realized it took millions of years for these formations to evolve. We were priviledged to witness our escort as he sprinkled the ashes of a deceased loved one whose ashes and been sent home from the States to Ireland to be specifically sprinkled offf the Killkee Cliffs, her most favorite spot in her homeland. This was truly a special moment for us all. Just a few days before we returned to Dublin we visited the Shrine of Our Lady of Knock. In 1879 about 30 years after the famine Our Lady appeared in this tiny village and several villagers witnessed the apparition. She remained silently for 2 hours with St. Joseph, St. John the Evangelist, The Lamb on the Altar with Angels hovering above. She came as the Loving Mother to offer comfort, hope, Encouragement and to remind all that God was with them. With the famine, religious persecution and at that time fear of another famine how timely for the Blessed Mother to appear as she has done historically in so many situations to be there for her children. Yes, Ireland is charged with the granduer of God. Would I return? In a heartbeat. I was reminded of this quote; ” Hope is the ability to hear the music of the future. Faith is the courage to dance to it today.”\n\nFr. Michael\n\nHi Chris!\n\nSo sorry I haven’t responded to you yet about the trip!! It’s been so busy and when we are finally back in the room I’ve been so exhausted! I’ve been trying not to email unless connected to wifi but so hard to do it at night after a long day, so I’m finally typing this on the bus on the way to Portugal. Anyway, we are all having a great time!! With the exception of Jake’s missing luggage, everything has been going smoothly. Juan Carlos and Pedro, our driver, are so nice and have been extremely flexible with my big family. The hotels have been excellent, and the lunch recommendations of Carlos have been delicious! Again, other than my entire family’s missing luggage situation causing us to have to scramble to reschedule the vow renewal toSaturday, everything else was perfect. The dinner was delicious and the extra touches (champagne, cake, etc) were very nice! I didn’t get to make the special tags for the “favors” but Juan was so nice to get little glass bottles for everyone to put their grotto water in and also a little toy for the kids. Luckily, my mom likes to befriend any priest she meets anywhere, so we introduced ourselves to Fr. Hagar when we arrived in Pau. We thought he was with us, but he was actually flying in a couple days earlier than another 206 tours group he was with. He was super nice and offered to help out when we heard our situation and need of rescheduling the vow renewal to Saturday. So we walked him to his hotel when we arrived in Lourdes and invited him to come meet with Us back at our hotel for coffee and to join us on some of our tours. He also came to lunch with us after the vow renewal. We really enjoyed his company and so appreciated his help with the vow renewals. He ended up renewing vows for all the married and engaged couples in our family! It was beautiful and very emotional to see all of my siblings recommitting to each other and then finishing off with my parents’ renewal.\n\nThanks so much for all of your help on this trip. Jeff and Dave left yesterday and arrived in Cali safely. The rest of us are enjoying the rest of our trip and awaiting news of jakes luggage. Last we heard was that they at least found it but they have not informed us of exactly where it is. Once they tell us, we are supposed to advise them as to where to send it – either directly back to Orlando or our hotel in Portugal.\n\nThanks again and take care!\n\nRachelle\n\nDear Amanda,\n\nWe’re finally back to the daily routine and there is so much to tell but I will try to be brief and see if I can organize my thoughts after visiting so many holy places. First of all, We want to thank you once more for the hard work you put into this family customized independent pilgrimage. Once more 206 and its staff did an outstanding job and rest assured that we are already talking (my husband and I) and saving money for our 5th pilgrimage in the future with 206. POLAND Amadeus Hotel; excellent, extremely clean, very delicious breakfast, staff very, very polite and informative, excellent location. Only a small detail, but we didn’t mind and we would choose Amadeus a second time in spite of sagging mattresses. Ella the tour guide, very nice lady and wonderful with the children. Gabrieliño (20 month old) went running to her and gave her a hug the second time he saw her. Thank you for your prompt help in regards with the city tour and securing transportation as the children were unable to walk all the distance involved. It was much appreciated by all and 206 came to the rescue once more. ITALY, Assisi, San Pietro Hotel, again very clean, good breakfast, excellent location, good mattresses. One of the older staff members at the receptionist desk was a bit crabby with the children, but by the time we left, the children had already made a good rapport with him with their “buon giorno” and “grazie” every morning and his attitude towards us changed 180 degrees. Massimo our chauffer was the best driver of all!!! The owner of the transportation agency, Vittorio, drove us in his Mercedes (my husband, Gilda and myself) to the Portiuncula and Cascia. Our daughter and family went in a regular van with Massimo. It was very convenient and we found out after we arrived in Cascia because ten years ago in our first pilgrimage with 206, the big bus left us at the bottom of the town and we had to climb all the way to the top where the Basilica and Convent of St. Rita are. This time, they planned well and by using two cars they were able to drive us all the way to the top in front of both convent and basilica. That morning, Vittorio’s wife had fallen at home and broke her foot while he was with us. We told him we were going to pray for her that day and next in Loreto, and Massimo heard us praying a Hail Mary and called him and told him and he was very happy. Our tour guide Eduardo, was the same tour guide we had 10 yrs ago and Vittorio told us that he had been working for him for the last 40 years. Eduardo answered my questions about gaining all the indulgences from the Portiuncula and the day after we returned home, we went to Mass and finished the requirements at a Franciscan Church in downtown Tampa. In Cascia, we were also able to see the Eucharistic Miracle. It was very special for our oldest granddaughter, Fausty. She made her First Holy Communion three weeks before the trip. Loreto I want to share what happened in Loreto to the tour guide, Veronica, and myself. After we exited the Holy House of Loreto while still inside the Basilica, Veronica advised us to get in line to receive a blessing from an older Franciscan priest sitting at a desk and to give a donation and take home olive oil blessed inside the Holy House. We did that. Right then, Veronica started to feel something and she asked me if I felt anything. I said no. This special anointing came to her even stronger, and she asked me a second time, and I repeated again no. No sooner had I said that when I started feeling it all over my arms and back and I told her, YESSS!! The day after we got home, after completing the requisites for the plenary indulgences from the Portiuncula, we went to visit our Spiritual Director and told him about what happened in Loreto. I asked him to bless both of us with the oil, especially my ears that were bad from the pressure in the planes. I had vertigo in Rome and was losing my balance that first day at home. Within a few minutes, my ears got well, no more dizziness and I have not felt this way in many years. I know the Blessed Mother has a lot to do with this healing. Praise be Jesus. Thank Mother Mary! Today, the rosary group in church was blessed with this oil. Hope and pray many people receive healing too. Assisi was a very special place and we felt the same PEACE as we did ten years ago. It is a place you don’t want to leave. Even the children felt this peace. “Pace e bene ” over and over. Roma Michelangelo Hotel. We liked it better that the hotel we stayed ten years ago. Location excellent, we walked to the Vatican several times. A superb breakfast! Staff was very busy but were polite to us. Very clean and excellent mattresses. This time we were able to visit Santa Croce and see the relics of the Holy Cross and tomb of Nennolina, the 7 yr old Servant of God, buried there. We had another healing. Fausty, 8 years old, woke up that day not feeling well with an upset stomach and was walking slowly and complaining of pain in her abdomen. After visiting Santa Croce, St. John Lateran and the Holy Stairs, she could hardly walk and started throwing up. Our daughter picked her up and crossed the large avenue with her in her arms. I silently prayed to little Nennolina and Our Lady of the Miracolo to intercede for her. We were all concerned, even the tour guide. After a few minutes she told her mom she felt well and my daughter put her down. She started walking straight and when I asked her, she replied, abuelita, the pain is gone and I feel well. I then told everyone about my silent prayers. I have no doubts that Nennolina and Our Blessed Mother interceded for Fausty wellness and we were able to finish our pilgrimage with no more ‘interferences’.\n\nOnce back home, my 89 yr old mom that lives alone and five hrs from us, told me she had fallen in her yard the day before we left but didn’t break anything, only a black cheek and bruised knee and foot. Praised be Jesus again. I would like to tell all the pilgrims that we all need to prepare and pray and go to confession before we go in a pilgrimage. The graces are many and we need to be open to them. The nine of us, started praying for thirty consecutive days, before, during and after, our pilgrimage, three Hail Mary’s and the Memorare and we prayed for Conversion, Healing and Protection and the graces that we need the most and we don’t know how to ask for them. We had friends back home joining us with the same intentions that we took to all the Holy Places we visited for us and for them. We had Masses said for these intentions in Our Lady of Zchestochowa-Jasna Gora ;Lagiewniki-Divine Mercy; and Our Lady of Perpetual Help-Redemtorist Church in Rome.\n\nWe know we have been blessed with this trip and we wanted to share these blessings with our family and friends, including 206 Tours Personnel. We thank almighty God, Mother Mary and all the Saints we saw for their intercession and protection. Amanda, Rinda and the rest keep up with the hard work of bringing people closer to God. WE NEED IT!!\n\nA Tampa Family\n\nDear Katherine / 206 Tours,\n\nI was involved with some of the planning of this trip with Father Charles, especially regarding the visits to the places of Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati. So I was expecting it to be a wonderful spiritual experience for the group which it absolutely was.\n\nWhat I was not expecting was to encounter someone as professional, accommodating, enthusiastic, organized, joyful and loving as our guide Gaia. What an amazing person! To move a group that size and keep everything under control the way she did was beyond impressive. I overheard many people saying things like, “If Gaia’s here, everything will be okay.” That was the common sentiment. She really played a huge part in making the trip as fabulous as it was. Father Charles repeatedly would say, “Now you know why we asked for Gaia!” When we visited the Frassati villa and the mountains, there were a lot of last-minute adjustments that she had to make in territory that she was unfamiliar with. I can’t think of a single challenge that was presented to her that she didn’t promptly resolve in a cool, calm and collected manner. In my 30-year professional career, I could probably count on one hand the people I have worked with who fall into the category of excellence that she does. It goes without saying that I would never want to bring a group to Italy without her.\n\nAs for the logistics of the trip, there was little I think you could improve on. Our bus driver was wonderful, the hotels were fine – some fabulous, the priests were solid in the Faith, even the weather cooperated! The farewell dinner was incredible and the spirit of the group was exceptional. The guide in the catacombs was not my favorite but I know they are randomly assigned. I had a little passport glitch before leaving the U.S. but I understand how it slipped through the cracks. And the only other issue I can think of was the pace we had to keep to do everything. I know from experience that it has to be that way, though, so I don’t think there was much that could have changed. I would wholeheartedly recommend 206. It was a life-changing experience even for me who has “been there done that” about a dozen times.\n\nMille grazie!\n\nChristine Wohar\n\nWhere to begin? Our Camino was incredibly well run right down to the last detail yet we never, ever felt restricted. Needs were always met, seemingly effortlessly. Nothing was forgotten or left to chance. Kudos to 206 Tours but especially to Javier our leader and of course David who drove the bus but did so much more. Father Jaehwa’s homilies at daily Mass were so personal and moving. Our spiritual growth on the Camino was subtle but life changing for us. Each person gets something different out of it. We felt blessed to have Mass for our group celebrated in some very special churches and chapels with significance in the history of the church.\n\nFrom the first meeting in Madrid we all got along well but by the end of our Camino in Santiago we felt like family. Perhaps it was the chemistry of the people but we all know it takes more than that to create a cohesive group. Javier and David’s sense of humor was infectious. Many in our group caught the “infection” and it spread rapidly. Laughter is a wonderful medicine, even or perhaps especially on a pilgrimage. The hotels were excellent. Everything was always in place on arrival – luggage appeared and disappeared as scheduled. The meals were excellent as well. We thought we would lose weight with all our walking. It didn’t happen! Javier prepared a “picnic” one day that can only be described as spectacular. We will be preparing paella and Javier’s sangria recipe for our annual family gathering at the beach in a few weeks. Thank you in advance.\n\nThe walking was strenuous and sometimes difficult but then again we were a good 10 – 15 years older than everyone else in our group! Mary Louise said “it was the hardest thing she had ever done but it was the best thing she had ever done”. “Sin dolor, no hay recompensa”. No pain, no gain. But we wouldn’t trade any of it. Walking poles are a definite plus and we would recommend them to anyone taking the trip. Also, we were able to walk at our own pace and not impact the rest of the group. Go Team Turtle! We were blessed with excellent weather so we were able to really appreciate some of the most beautiful scenery, countryside and people in the world. Nothing can compare to the sounds and smell of walking. The Galicians are a warm and friendly people. We loved Spain and Galicia and every stop along the way to Santiago. Too bad it’s such a long plane ride from home! Thank you for a wonderful experience. It is a memory that will be with us forever.\n\nGod Bless\n\nDexter & Mary Louise Koehl\n\nThis trip was a dream come true for me. Each shrine was amazing and different. Everyday was a grand experience. Kudos to 206 for a tour well done. Thanks for the surprises and small mementos. The beautiful Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Assisi was really special to me. My friends and I were able to attend the early morning and evening prayers sang by the monks. That was like heaven. I was able to spend more quiet time in the Porziuncula and was definitely feeling some inner peace and happiness within those ancient walls. And there were many , many more incredible blessings.\n\nMy trip actually started with some anxiety. My 9:00am Delta Air flight from LAX to JFK was cancelled due to a storm in NY. I was transferred to an Air France 3:30pm flight to Paris then to Rome. I missed the 10:00am pickup at Rome airport and I missed the 6pm orientation. Not only that, my suitcase was damaged when I got it. I asked the guide where I can buy a suitcase and he said “I’ll show you”. I thought he meant he’ll point to me to a street where I can find a store. Instead he walked with me under the scorching noon day sun of Rome looking for a suitcase store. After walking up and down twice, I was ready to give up. But he said “wait here”. He walked further up and found the store while I cooled myself inside an air conditioned store. Half way back to the hotel, I said to Alessandro, I forgot the receipt I really need it to file a claim on my travel insurance. And he promptly left me to go back to the store: ( so embarrassed. He certainly earned two thumbs up from me. But the saga of my suitcase did not end there. Moving to our next hotel, my suitcase went missing (ugh). Of course Alessandro found it and he said to me as we were transferring to our next, next hotel “I personally carried your suitcase”. Yay five stars for Alessandro.\n\nThe next segment of our tour was with Matilde. I am impressed with the immense knowledge of Matilde and all the 206 guides. 206 must hire only top notch people. Drivers – Giovanni in Italy, David in Portugal, Spain and Jose in France – were all efficient and drove us safely to our destinations. Our spiritual directors Fr. Jim and Fr. Greg were both inspirational. Let me mention here that Alessandro contacted Matilde (twice?) to ask how we were doing and made sure my friend was improving. My friend Lorie left Italy with a bad cough. This is my friend’s story to tell. Now you understand why we are fans of Alessandro. More power to 206 and more blessings to your staff & crew. I’ve already mentioned 206 to my family, relatives and friends. God willing I’ll be able to travel with you again. Thank you once again for the wonderful, incredible and unforgettable experience.\n\nRosario\n\nThank you for the opportunity to be spiritual director on the Pilgrimage to Poland, Prague, Austria and Budapest, April 28-May 14, 2015. The trip was absolutely wonder, the pilgrims prayerful, our guide, Chris and our driver, Robert fantastic. On the pilgrimages I always recommend 206 Tours to the pilgrims because these pilgrimages are truly spiritual, and therefore, true pilgrimages. Poland was an extraordinary experience because I was not aware of the depth of the Roman Catholic faith in this country. Poland is certainly a place of pilgrimage. Warsaw, Wadowice, Niepokalanow, Czestochowa, Zakopane, and Krakow, each had so much to offer. Some places, of course, more than others. I would actually consider extending Poland to include Vilnius, Lithuania, so we can have a full appreciation of St. Faustina’s life journey. In this regard, many of the pilgrims, myself included, felt that our time at the Divine Mercy Shrine was not enough, in order to go to Auschwitz in the afternoon. In fact, Lagiewniki and Auschwitz should be on two separate days: Lagiewniki is very spiritual, Auschwitz is very emotional. The solution to this might be by adding one day to Krakow. If this is combined with a few days in Vilnius, the pilgrims who want a pilgrimage focusing more on the life of St. Faustina would be satisfied, myself included. I would say that the Lagiewniki experience was somewhat rushed. I am aware that MG travel made some changes to the itinerary but they overlooked that Monday was a holiday and the museum in Krakow closed which effected our itinerary. The Divine Mercy convent in Lagiewniki Monday morning is gated due cleaning which meant we could not return to the chapel until noon. I thought the work that has been done to St. John-Paul II’s home in Wadowice was excellent. I told the Sister that this was one of the best museums I ever visited. It is truly worth the visit. Prague was a new experience for me, and for many of the pilgrims also, as many had never been to Prague. What a beautiful city! Both history and religion, of course with the Infant Jesus of Prague, made this visit enlightening and enriching. Salzburg, Vienna, Budapest, and the Marian shrines in-between, Altotting and Mariazell, were all extraordinary experiences, each with their history. These shrines gave us a sacred place to pray.\n\nI believe one of the most profound moments of our pilgrimage was to have a Sister of Divine Mercy talk to as at the Divine Mercy shrine in Lagiewniki. She was wonderful and we were all very moved by her discussion on St. Faustina’s Diary. Her name is Sister Maria Vianneya. Chris, our tour guide, was very helpful and made sure all the pilgrims had everything they needed, especially access to the washrooms. We were well-informed of the places/regions/history, and of our itinerary on a daily basis. Robert is an excellent bus driver. Thank you to all your staff who worked hard to put this pilgrimage together, from the itinerary, to the flight bookings, especially Melisa Mulligan. Thank you once again; this is part of Europe that I have never visited, and it has been so long that I wanted to go to Poland. God bless you.\n\nSt. Faustina, St. Maximilian Kolbe, St. John-Paul II, pray for us,\n\nFather David\n\nHello Milanka,\n\nI hope all is wonderful with you. Usually you would expect to receive a Thank you note at the end of the journey, but I must say that the good Lord has showered me with all his Blessings so far on my journey and many thanks to you and everyone at 206 Tours for making my dream pilgrimage journey has a heavenly reality so far 🙂 hopefully Our Blessed Mother will continue her abundant grace for the remainder of my pilgrimage.\n\nI must be your biggest advocate, constantly encouraging everyone on my tours to visit other shrines and Jerusalem (I even ended up recruiting few pilgrims during our Papal audience) I didn’t get a one on one with Pope Francis (but I will tell you the story some other time) ended up in section one, right by the gate first to see home (my camera froze but I savored the moment) At Manopello they wanted to close early (but a nun agreed to let me stay all alone locked up in the Church and venerate the veil for 21/2 hours) All the guides are superb! Jesus got me to carry the statute of Our Lady in Fatima twice! Juan got me an extra ticket to venerate the Shroud a second time (one time is surely not enough for me!) I was kind of worried few days before heading on this trip, to be all alone for so long and joining so many different groups (everyone was so welcoming and made so many friends) all thought I was either a teacher in theology or Priest! I keep reminding them of the wonderful Graces of our Pilgrimage with 206. So glad you finally added on the new web page the explanation of your company name! I spent the early part of our trip in Fatima explaining it to my new friends.\n\nYou are always in my prayers for your intentions and for the continued success of 206 tours (even though I am not done with this journey and still looking forward to Our Lady in Guadalupe) I am already planning and dreaming up my next journey (not three weeks again! I miss Kathy so much that she will joining me earlier in Paris and I may end up my trip a day earlier in Paris and meet up with her on our own)\n\nDon’t worry when I recommend 206 I always give out Rinda’s name 🙂 hope she doesn’t mind All the Blessings and hope to see you soon\n\nJoseph\n\nDear Rinda,\n\nI just returned from a two week pilgrimage as the spiritual director to Fatima, Lourdes, and the stroud of Turin. The trip was very uplifting for me and I always enjoy seeing the pilgrims grow in a deeper faith in the Lord and His mother Mary by walking through holy sites. The pilgrims were from all over the USA and we truly had a nice group. Little did they realize how much they inspired me. I liked speaking with them and loved hearing about their lives of faith.\n\nFor the first part of the journey, we were blessed with Javi as our guide. Javi had a wonderful personality and had a tremendous knowledge of the various places and sites. He worked very well with the people and seemed to be liked by many. Personally, I found him to be a delight to work with and enjoyed laughing and chatting with him. He truly took personal care of the people and guided us with compassion and love like a dad. He is a keeper and does great work for 206 tours. I would travel with him again… Well done!\n\nThe second part of the journey was with our director, Jesus. Jesus and I traveled together in the past and I was glad to see him; almost like seeing an old friend. Jesus is a wonderful tour director and once again he proved to me that 206 is a great company because they hire well. Like Javi, he is a keeper! Jesus showed great love for the people. He is/was kind, funny, and very easy going with the people. I am always impressed over his great love for God and the Holy Mass. He served the Mass and did so with love and devotion. I would highly recommend him because he is a deeply spiritual man that loves his job and faith.\n\nThanks for allowing me to help out as a spiritual director. Please know that I would like to serve again if you are in need and if my schedule allows me to. Thanks for helping me with isle seats because being tall it’s tough being stuck in the middle or near a window. Blessings and until we meet again.\n\nGod Bless!\n\nFr. Peter\n\nHi Donna,\n\nSorry for the late response. My daughter Amy and I had a WONDERFUL pilgrimage. Our escort was Jesus and he was great. He was efficient and pleasant and we both enjoyed him a great deal. Jesus especially helped me when I had a minor health crisis. He was calm and got the job done. He is a very spiritual man with a great personality who added a lot to our trip.\n\nThe reason I went on this pilgrimage was to pray for a miracle. One week earlier, I had gotten a devastating diagnosis that I have a half dollar sized hole in my jawbone due to the radiation which saved my life from cancer 22 years ago. The options for treatment, range from extracting half of my bottom teeth, to cutting out dead bone, to removing my bottom jaw and grafting in part of my shin bone. Plus, all the doctors told me that I may never heal from the surgeries…that I could very well be going from the frying pan to the fire. Needless to say I was terrified and overwhelmed. I prayed for peace, clarity and hope.\n\nI chose this particular pilgrimage because I wanted to see Lourdes, Fatima AND St. Ignatius of Loyola’s home. Our first stop was in Lisbon, and the first church we went to was the Basilica of St. Anthony, a church that I didn’t even realize was on the itinerary. The homily at the Mass went something like this.\n\n“Most of us think of St. Anthony when we lose something. ‘Tony, Tony, turn around. Something’s lost and must be found.’ But I want you to think of him a bit differently. I want you to pray to St. Anthony when you want to lose something–like your fear, or your pride….”\n\nWOW! Pray to St. Anthony to lose my fear! It’s like God was reading my mind and reached out to comfort me. 🙂 And then, we took a tour of the Basilica. They have two relics of St. Anthony in the church, and guess what one is?? His jawbone. Goodness! God was so sweet to send me such a personal message and so quickly, letting me know how much He cares about me. I prayed and my fear about the future left instantly and I have not worried since. What will be, will be. All will be well and God will be glorified. God is so good!\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed Fatima and Lourdes. The weather for the trip was 8 & 1/2 cool, sunny days with blue skies and gentle breezes, and 1 & 1/2 days of cold, rainy weather in Lourdes. But you know, it didn’t dampen our spirits a bit. A matter of fact, Lourdes was my favorite spot, rain and all. I particularly loved the Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary. Gorgeous and very sacred.\n\nThank you so much for planning such a wonderful pilgrimage for us…worry free! God bless you all and see you soon!\n\nMary Ann B.\n\nThank you! It was quite an amazing pilgrimage on so many levels. Luckily, I was journaling the whole time and kept very detailed notes so that I can continue to let this pilgrimage unfold in my life. A definite highlight of course were the tombs of St. Teresa and St. John but also the little town of Agreda. That might just be my favorite stop on the entire trip. I know that Javier Valdivieso also really loved visiting there. It was his first time! Fr. Brian bought her works – The mystical city of God – for Javier Valdivieso to read. He loved it. Very few pilgrims seem to go there. It was a tiny town – very humble. The sister spent quite a bit of time talking to us in the parlor and they even gave each of us a small piece of her habit that was actually on her body! A second class relic…amazing!!\n\nI cannot say enough about this town and the stop and how it moved all of our pilgrims quite intensely. I would suggest considering adding it to some of your trips…specially if you have a group that is extremely devout.\n\nThe accommodations were fine in all of the towns. We absolutely loved Montseraat the most because of the breathtaking beauty and the simplicity of the rooms and also there was chapel access for us.\n\nThe type of people that we take on our groups – are not the normal tourists. Most are deeply spiritual people – looking for a lot of prayer time. Myself and Fr. Brian Grady included. The one downside is that you have to move around so much and it’s often not as prayerful as one would like. This is okay, but it would be simply wonderful if we could stay at places that had a chapel or that had a church nearby that we could get into early in the morning to pray before we get on the bus to start the day. This would allow many of us to start the day having had prayer time – We can talk more about this as we plan our next trip.\n\nJavier Valdivieso is like a living history book! He teaches us so much as we go around and has such a beautiful outlook on life. The fact that you can see what a spiritual man he is – comes out when he is explaining the places concerning the faith to our group. He truly makes these trips so special and prayerful. He is patient and kind to all our pilgrims – even the ones that tend to be needy –and he never gets worried or frazzled about anything! I have done 206 Tours with two other guides – both that were fine but none that even came close to making it the experience for our people that Javier Valdivieso does. He really loves our Lord and he loves his job at 206 as well!\n\nWe would like to plan a trip to France next year with 206 – having Javier as our guide. He said he was allowed to do France. We are thinking next fall – but I will get back to you. It doesn’t need to be planned yet…and obviously right now we want to start to plug our Mexico City trip in February. Father and I will talk about all of the must-see places in France and send you a list and then you guys can put something together. I’m wondering if perhaps we could stay at places like Montserrat or places that have chapel access ? We can talk…\n\nLastly, thank you for taking care of my parents! One suggestion I have is to be sure that every Pilgrim has given you their passport information prior to departure. It was 100% my parents fault for not seeing that it expired – the five for the year 2015 truly looked like a six so you can see the mixup – but had they sent their stuff to you perhaps it would’ve been caught. The good news is they did they did not miss Avila, or the Camino or Agreda. Those three things were the highlight for my mother. The final item on her bucket list before she passes from this world was to walk on the Camino.\n\nNow it is complete. 🙂\n\nMarcie\n\nHi Yaritza,\n\nYes, we are happy to share with you our wonderful experience with the 206 Tours pilgrimage to Italy. It was a fabulous trip! First, let me say how truly exceptional our tour director, Alessandro is. You are blessed to have him as a part of your company. He was patient and kind and immensely capable. A very knowledgeable and devout Catholic, he kept us well informed and in a “pilgrim” state of mind, always inviting us back to the heart and practices of the Church. He was gracious to the easiest AND most difficult in the group. He made the experience a relaxing one for us as we were confident that all the details were taken care of; he never seemed to stress out or become frustrated when one of us was tardy or missing or needed direction or a helping hand. Truly he was a gentleman and a blessing! A small example is I simply mentioned that “today” is Jim’s birthday and he arranged to have the restaurant bring the dessert cake out with a candle on it and then began us singing Happy Birthday. It was thoughtful and special for us! Similarly, he helped organize a celebration for a couple’s 50th anniversary and a woman’s 70th birthday.\n\nAs for the itinerary of the trip we felt it was just about the right pace with enough free time to ourselves and yet we still covered many of the major sites of Catholic Rome. I must say we are thankful that we came in a day early, though. We explored many sites on our own that day and then we were well rested to join the group in the afternoon the next day. It was perfect, including the flight details you kindly arranged and the transfer at the airport. We were even able to attend Mass at one of the Station Churches the morning before the group arrived, joining a couple of hundred religious and possibly another hundred non-religious at 7am at St. Peter’s first church in Rome: St. Pudenziana. This may be an option to consider and offer for Lent of next year.\n\nThe hotels were very comfortable and accommodating with delicious breakfasts and prompt courteous service. In addition, the dinners at San Giovanni Rotondo and Assisi were well prepared and varied nicely. My only suggestion is that, if possible, it would have been nice to eat in the community one night at each of those two locations. Engaging in the community with the “locals” at their dining establishments is always a lovely experience. That being said, we truly enjoyed the dinners and atmosphere of the small, quaint restaurants in Rome. From start to finish: our experiences with you and your office, the spiritual director – Matt Leonard, Alessandro, the local guides and the fact that a priest was able to join us were positive and joyful experiences. One thing that I would suggest is rethinking the times of the lectures given by the spiritual director. At such a late hour of the day, particularly after we all have had a glass of wine or two we were quite tired. All of us wanted very much to hear what he had to share but the lectures typically began a little later than we would have liked.\n\nAs for the sites/locations themselves, each stop was truly worthwhile and holy. It was simply a joy to learn about and experience the places where so many holy men and women walked and served the Lord!\n\nJim and I did a lot of reading, studying and watching DVDs of the locations and people that we were going to visit and that effort enhanced our experience immensely. Where others were remarking that they were overwhelmed, we felt that we were being reminded of what we already learned while gaining a little more info that we may have missed in our own preparation. Of course, physically being at the sites enriched our knowledge and experience of it a hundred-fold. I would recommend others do the same in preparation for the pilgrimage.Thank you again for helping to make our trip so memorable and enjoyable. We will happily recommend your company to all our friends and family as they consider their own pilgrimages!\n\nMay the joy of the Lord be with you and yours this Lenten season and throughout the Easter season.\n\nSharon (and Jim) Pierson\n\nHi Amanda,\n\nI can sum up my feelings about this pilgrimage in one word: SPECTACULAR! The entire trip was an experience I will cherish the rest of my life. Deacon Pete and his group are some of the nicest people I have ever met. They welcomed me and made me feel accepted from the beginning. In fact, in the middle of the trip, a few people decided to “knight me” an “Honorary Hispanic” and made my name Pancho. I treasure my new friendships! I hope and pray we can bridge the geographic distance and stay in touch to some degree. I could go on and on about how wonderful these kind and God-loving people are, but I think these comments will help you understand how I feel.\n\nWhile I felt the love and presence of God throughout the pilgrimage, I experienced 4 profound experience where I truly felt the awesome presence of our loving God. The most profound my time with the people on the trip, Deacon Pete, our guide Nadi, and our bus driver, Akrim. This scripture passage will sum up what I mean. Jesus said, “For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” Matthew 18:20. Jesus was on the trip with us!\n\nOur 206 Tours guide, Nadi, was a gentleman like no other. For example, I was not aware this trip was going to be in Spanish until I arrived in Tel Aviv. My thought when I was told this was, “Well I’m here by the grace of God. I am open to see what God has in store”. Well, Deacon Pete and Nadi graciously decided to do in Spanish with English recaps. Nadi was immediately open to this despite the fact it would require more effort and work on his part. As the trip progressed, Nadi, Deacon Pete, and the group did some things in Spanish with English recaps and some things in English with Spanish recaps. This included the daily Mass. Everyone was open to this. (Some of the group said early on that while they knew Spanish, they would prefer things be said in English as they would comprehend better. ) I think the use of both Spanish and English allowed us to bridge our different upbringings and cultures. Nadi knows his stuff. He is very knowledgable. He had each days events coordinated in a way that we never had to wait for anything more than a few minutes, if that. Usually, we were admitted to Holy Sites as soon as we arrived. Nadi cared about us, got to know us, and made the trip exciting and fun. Towards the end of the trip, I realized the following: Nadi and our bus driver, Akrim, made each of us feel so special. I believe it can be challenging for people who do their “job” over and over again, such as the same tour over and over again, to project the sense of newness and excitement like it is their first time as well. Nadi and Akrim have the knowledge, skills, talent, and personalities to make any pilgrimage exciting and project newness and excitement to each and everyone there. Please thank both of them for me. I would gladly go on any tour with them again.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrank Domeracki\n\nI was apprehensive when I began to search for a tour agency to lead me on a Pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Searching the internet for an agency to handle such a sacred journey seemed odd, for many reasons. At the time of my search I was not yet Catholic and would not be Catholic when the pilgrimage took place, but more importantly, I was transitioning from being a blissfully happy wife of 17 years to a suddenly broken hearted widow. After reviewing numerous tour companies, a little voice in my heart kept whispering, “journey with 206”.\n\nThe wisphering had to be the voice of God. From the moment I left my home alone in Pittsburgh and arrived in Tel Aviv, I knew I was on a first class God lead Pilgrimage. Not only was I blessed with the opportunity to do a Pilgrimage to the Holy Land followed by three days in Rome, the blessings extended to the group of people I was with. Each member of our 24 person group was a blessing. From Fr Nowak and Deacon Sean, I could not have ask for more spiritual and bible backed guidence. Our local Israeli guide Nadi, a Christian, could not have been better! His infectious smile and silly jokes were an added benefit to his highly educated explanations of history and current events at these sacred spots. In Rome, Alessandro, our local guide was so approachable and he went to great lengths to keep us on track and show us as much as possible during our 3 day visit. He willingly stayed up well past 11 pm walking the city after dinner with group members – that is truely going the extra mile! Add to the fact that he got us so close to Pope Francis for the general audience, I could have touch him if I hadn’t be awe struck! I will never forget the warmth I felt when Alessandro smiled in celebration of my successful completion of the 27 step climb of the Holy Stairs on my knees! Everything, from the minute I left my home til I arrived back home was even better than what the tour information on line promised.\n\nThe accommodations were much better than expected, the food was delicious and plentiful, we saw more than I actually anticipated! So, I want to thank you for the 5 star treatment, I want to thank my group for the loving arms and generous spirit they offered so readily. I really believe I’ve made life long friends and IT’s because you all know what you are doing there at 206Tours.com.\n\nPlease feel free to share my email address with any person wanting a personal recommendation of 206Tours, and if you feel appropriate, publish any of the attached photos.\n\nLinda (Pittsburgh, PA)"
