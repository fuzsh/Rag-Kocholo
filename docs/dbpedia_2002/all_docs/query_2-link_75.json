        "text": "Novel Use of a Pneumatic Compression Device for Haemostasis of Haemodialysis Fistula Access Catheterisation Sites\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOâReilly, Michael K., E-mail: moreilly1@mater.ie; Ryan, David; Sugrue, Gavin\n\nPurposeTransradial pneumatic compression devices can be used to achieve haemostasis following radial artery puncture. This article describes a novel technique for acquiring haemostasis of arterio-venous haemodialysis fistula access sites without the need for suture placement using one such compression device.Materials and MethodsA retrospective review of fistulograms with or without angioplasty/thrombectomy in a single institution was performed. 20 procedures performed on 12 patients who underwent percutaneous intervention of failing or thrombosed arterio-venous fistulas (AVF) had 27 puncture sites. Haemostasis was achieved using a pneumatic compression device at all access sites. Procedure details including size of access sheath, heparin administration and complicationsmoreÂ Â» were recorded.ResultsTwo diagnostic fistulograms, 14 fistulograms and angioplasties and four thrombectomies were performed via access sheaths with an average size (Â±SD) of 6 Fr (Â±1.12). IV unfractionated heparin was administered in 11 of 20 procedures. Haemostasis was achieved in 26 of 27 access sites following 15â20Â min of compression using the pneumatic compression device. One case experienced limited bleeding from an inflow access site that was successfully treated with reinflation of the device for a further 5Â min. No other complication was recorded.ConclusionsHaemostasis of arterio-venous haemodialysis fistula access sites can be safely and effectively achieved using a pneumatic compression device. This is a technically simple, safe and sutureless technique for acquiring haemostasis after AVF intervention.Â«Â less\n\nPneumatic microfluidic cell compression device for high-throughput study of chondrocyte mechanobiology.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Donghee; Erickson, Alek; You, Taesun; Dudley, Andrew T; Ryu, Sangjin\n\n2018-06-13\n\nHyaline cartilage is a specialized type of connective tissue that lines many moveable joints (articular cartilage) and contributes to bone growth (growth plate cartilage). Hyaline cartilage is composed of a single cell type, the chondrocyte, which produces a unique hydrated matrix to resist compressive stress. Although compressive stress has profound effects on transcriptional networks and matrix biosynthesis in chondrocytes, mechanistic relationships between strain, signal transduction, cell metabolism, and matrix production remain superficial. Here, we describe development and validation of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based pneumatic microfluidic cell compression device which generates multiple compression conditions in a single platform. The device contained an array of PDMS balloons of different sizes which were actuated by pressurized air, and the balloons compressed chondrocytes cells in alginate hydrogel constructs. Our characterization and testing of the device showed that the developed platform could compress chondrocytes with various magnitudes simultaneously with negligible effect on cell viability. Also, the device is compatible with live cell imaging to probe early effects of compressive stress, and it can be rapidly dismantled to facilitate molecular studies of compressive stress on transcriptional networks. Therefore, the proposed device will enhance the productivity of chondrocyte mechanobiology studies, and it can be applied to study mechanobiology of other cell types.\n\nA reduced-order model-based study on the effect of intermittent pneumatic compression of limbs on the cardiovascular system.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaffiodo, Daniela; De Nisco, Giuseppe; Gallo, Diego; Audenino, Alberto; Morbiducci, Umberto; Ferraresi, Carlo\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThis work investigates the effect that the application of intermittent pneumatic compression to lower limbs has on the cardiovascular system. Intermittent pneumatic compression can be applied to subjects with reduced or null mobility and can be useful for therapeutic purposes in sports recovery, deep vein thrombosis prevention and lymphedema drainage. However, intermittent pneumatic compression performance and the effectiveness are often difficult to predict. This study presents a reduced-order numerical model of the interaction between the cardiovascular system and the intermittent pneumatic compression device. The effect that different intermittent pneumatic compression operating conditions have on the overall circulation is investigated. Our findings confirm (1) that an overall positive effect on hemodynamics can be obtained by properly applying the intermittent pneumatic compression device and (2) that using intermittent pneumatic compression for cardiocirculatory recovery is feasible in subjects affected by lower limb disease.

Devices are frequently discontinued when patients are out of bed, and they are rarely used in emergency departments. Trauma patients are at high risk for LEDVT; however, IPCs are underused in this population because of compliance limitations. The hypothesis of this study was that a new miniaturized, portable, battery-powered pneumatic compression device improves compliance in trauma patients over that provided by a standard device. This was a prospective trial in which trauma patients (mean age, 46 years; revised trauma score, 11.7) were randomized to DVT prophylaxis with a standard calf-length sequential IPC device (SCD group) or a miniaturized sequential device (continuous enhanced-circulation therapy [CECT] group). The CECT device can be battery-operated for up to 6 hours and worn during ambulation. Timers attached to the devices, which recorded the time each device was applied to the legs and functioning, were used to quantify compliance. For each subject in each location during hospitalization, compliance rates were determined by dividing the number of minutes the device was functioning by the total minutes in that location. Compliance rates for all subjects were averaged in each location: emergency department, operating room, intensive care unit, and nursing ward. Total compliance rate in the CECT group was significantly higher than in the SCD group (77.7% vs. 58.9%, P =.004). Compliance in the emergency department and nursing ward were also significantly greater with the CECT device (P =.002 and P =.008 respectively). Previous studies have demonstrated that reduced compliance with IPC devices results in a higher incidence of LEDVT. Given its ability to improve compliance, the CECT may provide superior DVT prevention compared with that provided by standard devices.\n\nEarly application of an intermittent pneumatic compression device is safe and results in proximal arteriovenous fistula enlargement.\n\nPubMed\n\nDesai, Sanjay; Mitra, Amit; Arkans, Ed; Singh, Tej M\n\n2018-05-01\n\nDelays in arteriovenous fistula maturation can cause care delays and increased costs. Increased distention pressure and intermittent wall shear stress may dilate veins based on prior research. Early use of non-invasive devices may help assist clinical arteriovenous fistula dilation. This was an Institutional Review Board approved study. After arteriovenous fistula creation, a novel, intermittent pneumatic compression device (Fist Assist Â® ) was applied 15âcm proximal to arteriovenous fistula enabling 60âmmHg of cyclic compression for 6âh daily for 30âdays. Among the patients who completed 1âmonth follow-up, 30 (nâ=â30) arteriovenous fistula patients were in the study arm to test vein dilation with Fist Assist. Controls (nâ=â16) used a sham device. Vein size was measured and recorded at baseline and after 30âdays by duplex measurement. Clinical results (percentage increase) were recorded and tested for significance. No patients experienced thrombosis or adverse effects. Patient compliance and satisfaction was high. After 1âmonth, the mean percentage increase in vein diameter in the Fist Assist treatment group was significantly larger (pâ=â0.026) than controls in the first 5âmm segment of the fistula after the anastomosis. All fistulas treated with Fist Assist are still functional with no reported thrombosis or extravasations. Early application of an intermittent pneumatic compression device may assist in arteriovenous fistula dilation and are safe. Non-invasive devices like Fist Assist may have clinical utility to help fistulae development and decrease costs as they may eventually assist maturation.\n\nVenous Hemodynamics After Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Comparison Between Portable vs Stationary Pneumatic Compression Devices and the Effect of Body Position.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerliner, Jonathan L; Ortiz, Philippe A; Lee, Yuo-Yu; Miller, Theodore T; Westrich, Geoffrey H\n\n2018-01-01\n\nImprovements in device design have allowed for portable pneumatic compression devices (PPCDs). However, portability results in smaller pumps that move less blood. Additionally, although patients often stand when wearing PPCDs, few studies have evaluated the hemodynamic effects of PCDs while standing. A crossover study was performed to compare a PPCD (ActiveCare+S.F.T.; Medical Compression Systems, Or Akiva, Israel) to a stationary pneumatic compression device (SPCD) (VenaFlow; DJO Global, Carlsbad, CA) on hemodynamics in supine and standing positions among 2 cohorts composed of 10 controls and 10 total hip arthroplasty patients. Differences in baseline peak venous velocity (PVV), PVV with each PCD, and delta PVV with each PCD were assessed. A multivariate analysis was performed to examine differences between cohorts, devices, and position. In both positions, the SPCD demonstrated a larger change in PVV when compared to the PPCD (PÂ < .001). The total hip arthroplasty group had a greater delta PVV while standing when considering both PCDs together (P < .001). When considering both cohorts, delta PVV was greater while standing, only when the SPCD was used (P < .001). There was no difference between standing and supine positions when the PPCD was used. The SPCD demonstrated a greater capacity to increase PPV in the supine and standing positions. The SPCD generated greater values of PVV and delta PVV in the standing position. Although these results demonstrate a difference between devices, it is important to establish the PVV necessary to prevent VTE before one is considered more effective. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

As the main source of extracellular fluid removed during HD are the legs, we sought to reduce DIH and increase phosphate removal by using cycling and pneumatic compression, which would potentially provide higher venous return, preserving central blood flow and also offering more phosphate to the dialyzer. We evaluated 21 patients in a randomized crossover fashion in which each patient underwent 3 different HD: control; cycling exercise during the first 60 min; and pneumatic compression during the first 60 min. Data obtained included bioelectrical impedance, hourly blood pressure measurement, biochemical parameters, and direct quantification of phosphate through the dialysate. DIH was defined as a drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP) â¥20 mm Hg. There was no difference in the ultrafiltration rate (p = 0.628), delta weight (p = 0.415), delta of total, intra and extracellular body water among the control, cycling, and pneumatic compression (p = 0.209, p = 0.348, and p = 0.467 respectively). Delta MAP was less changed by pneumatic compression when compared to control, cycling, and pneumatic compression respectively (-4.7 [-17.2, 8.2], -4.7 [-20.5, -0.2], and -2.3 [-8.1, 9.0] mm Hg; p = 0.021). DIH occurred in 43, 38, and 24% of patients in control, cycling, and pneumatic compression respectively (p = 0.014). Phosphate removal did not increase in any intervention (p = 0.486). Higher phosphate removal was dependent on ultrafiltration, pre dialysis serum phosphate, and higher parathyroid hormone. Pneumatic compression during the first hour of dialysis was associated with less DIH, albeit there was no effect on fluid parameters. Neither exercise nor pneumatic compression increased phosphate removal. Â© 2017 S.

It can be achieved by complementing traditional rigid grippers with soft robotic pneumatic gripper devices. This manuscript describes a rod-based approach that combined both 3D-printing and a modified soft lithography technique to fabricate the soft pneumatic gripper. In brief, the pneumatic featureless mold with chamber component is 3D-printed and the rods were used to create the pneumatic channels that connect to the chamber. This protocol eliminates the risk of channels occluding during the sealing process and the need for external air source or related control circuit. The soft gripper consists of a chamber filled with air, and one or more gripper arms with a pneumatic channel in each arm connected to the chamber. The pneumatic channel is positioned close to the outer wall to create different stiffness in the gripper arm. Upon compression of the chamber which generates pressure on the pneumatic channel, the gripper arm will bend inward to form a close grip posture because the outer wall area is more compliant. The soft gripper can be inserted into a 3D-printed handling tool with two different control modes for chamber compression: manual gripper mode with a movable piston, and robotic gripper mode with a linear actuator. The double-arm gripper with two actuatable arms was able to pick up objects of sizes up to 2 mm and yet generate lower compressive forces as compared to elastomer-coated and non-coated rigid grippers. The feasibility of having other designs, such as single-arm or hook gripper, was also demonstrated, which further highlighted the customizability of the soft gripper device, and it's potential to be used in delicate surgical manipulation to reduce the risk of tissue grip damage.\n\nOptimal pressure regulation of the pneumatic ventricular assist device with bellows-type driver.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Jung Joo; Kim, Bum Soo; Choi, Jaesoon; Choi, Hyuk; Ahn, Chi Bum; Nam, Kyoung Won; Jeong, Gi Seok; Lim, Choon Hak; Son, Ho Sung; Sun, Kyung\n\n2009-08-01\n\nThe bellows-type pneumatic ventricular assist device (VAD) generates pneumatic pressure with compression of bellows instead of using an air compressor. This VAD driver has a small volume that is suitable for portable devices. However, improper pneumatic pressure setup can not only cause a lack of adequate flow generation, but also cause durability problems. In this study, a pneumatic pressure regulation system for optimal operation of the bellows-type VAD has been developed. The optimal pneumatic pressure conditions according to various afterload conditions aiming for optimal flow rates were investigated, and an afterload estimation algorithm was developed. The developed regulation system, which consists of a pressure sensor and a two-way solenoid valve, estimates the current afterload and regulates the pneumatic pressure to the optimal point for the current afterload condition. Experiments were performed in a mock circulation system. The afterload estimation algorithm showed sufficient performance with the standard deviation of error, 8.8 mm Hg. The flow rate could be stably regulated with a developed system under various afterload conditions. The shortcoming of a bellows-type VAD could be handled with this simple pressure regulation system.\n\nIntegration of Pneumatic Technology in Powered Mobility Devices\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDaveler, Brandon; Wang, Hongwu; Gebrosky, Benjamin; Grindle, Garrett G.; Schneider, Urs\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAdvances in electric motors, electronics, and control systems have enhanced the capability and drivability of electric power mobility devices over the last 60 years. Yet, battery technologies used in powered mobility devices (PMDs) have not kept pace. Recent advances in pneumatic technology, primarily the high torque, low speed design of rotary piston air motors, directly align with the needs of PMD. Pneumatic technology has advantages over battery-powered technology, including lighter weight, lower operating costs, decreased environmental impact, better reliability, and increased safety. Two prototypes were created that incorporated rotary piston air motors, high-pressure air tanks, and air-pressure regulators. Prototype 1 was created by modifying an existing electric PMD. Range tests were performed to determine the feasibility of pneumatic technology and the optimal combination of components to allow the longest range possible at acceptable speeds over ideal conditions. Using a 1.44 L air tank for feasibility testing, prototype 1 was capable of traveling 800 m, which confirmed the feasibility of pneumatic technology usage in PMDs. Prototype 2 was designed based on the testing results from prototype 1. After further optimization of prototype 2, the average maximum range was 3,150 m. Prototype 2 is up to 28.3% lighter than an equivalent size electric PMD and can be fully recharged in approximately 2 minutes. It decreases the cost of PMDs by approximately $1,500, because batteries do not need to be replaced over the lifetime of the device. The results provide justification for the use of pneumatic technology in PMDs.

The clinical objective of belt usage was to reduce the cranial-caudal (CC) respiratory motion of the tumor to 5 mm or less during both CT simulation and treatment. A retrospective analysis was done to determine the effectiveness of the device and associated clinical procedures to reduce the CC respiratory motion of the tumor. 42 patients treated for tumors in the liver (30), adrenal glands (6), pancreas (3) and lymph nodes (3) using high dose hypofractionated radiotherapy between 2004 and the present were eligible for analysis. All patients had 2-3 radiopaque fiducial markers implanted near the tumor prior to simulation, or had clips from prior surgery. Integral to the belt is an inflatable air bladder that is positioned over the abdomen. The pneumatic pressure was set to a level in consultation with the patient. The CC motion was measured fluoroscopically with and without pneumatic pressure. Pneumatic pressure was used at all treatments to reduce to CC motion to that achieved at simulation. The mean CC motion with the belt in place, but no additional air pressure was 11.4 mm with a range of 5-20 mm. With the pressure applied, the mean CC motion was reduced to 4.4 mm with a range of 1-8 mm (P-value < 0.001). The clinical objective of reducing the CC motion of the tumor to a maximum excursion of 5 mm or less was achieved in 93% of cases. The use of a pneumatic compression belt and associated clinical procedures was found to result in a significant and frequently substantial reduction in the CC motion of the tumor.\n\nCompensating for pneumatic distortion in pressure sensing devices\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWhitmore, Stephen A.; Leondes, Cornelius T.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nA technique of compensating for pneumatic distortion in pressure sensing devices was developed and verified. This compensation allows conventional pressure sensing technology to obtain improved unsteady pressure measurements. Pressure distortion caused by frictional attenuation and pneumatic resonance within the sensing system makes obtaining unsteady pressure measurements by conventional sensors difficult. Most distortion occurs within the pneumatic tubing which transmits pressure impulses from the aircraft's surface to the measurement transducer. To avoid pneumatic distortion, experiment designers mount the pressure sensor at the surface of the aircraft, (called in-situ mounting). In-situ transducers cannot always fit in the available space and sometimes pneumatic tubing must be run from the aircraft's surface to the pressure transducer. A technique to measure unsteady pressure data using conventional pressure sensing technology was developed. A pneumatic distortion model is reduced to a low-order, state-variable model retaining most of the dynamic characteristics of the full model. The reduced-order model is coupled with results from minimum variance estimation theory to develop an algorithm to compensate for the effects of pneumatic distortion. Both postflight and real-time algorithms are developed and evaluated using simulated and flight data.\n\nA comparison of intermittent pneumatic compression of the calf and whole leg in preventing deep venous thrombosis in urological surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoderdahl, D W; Henderson, S R; Hansberry, K L\n\n1997-05-01\n\nIntermittent pneumatic compression of the calf and/or thigh effectively decreases the incidence of deep venous thrombosis and other thrombotic sequelae but clinical data comparing these modalities are currently lacking. A total of 90 patients undergoing major urological surgery was randomly assigned to receive calf length or thigh length pneumatic compression for antithrombotic prophylaxis. Duplex ultrasound of the lower extremities was performed preoperatively and twice postoperatively to evaluate for deep venous thrombosis. Health care providers in the operating room, recovery room and ward were asked to compare the compression systems, and a cost analysis was performed. A total of 47 patients wore the thigh length sequential pneumatic sleeves and 43 wore calf length uniform compression systems. A pulmonary embolus without evidence of deep venous thrombosis was detected in 1 patient (2%) using the thigh length system. A thrombus was detected in the common femoral vein by duplex ultrasonography in 1 patient (2%) with the calf length system. Nursing personnel found the calf length sleeves easier to apply and more comfortable by patient account but they were satisfied with both systems. There was a significant cost savings with the calf length pneumatic compression system. Calf and thigh length pneumatic compression systems similarly decrease the risk of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing urological surgery. The calf length system has the added advantage of being less expensive and easier to use.\n\nRespiratory Synchronized Versus Intermittent Pneumatic Compression in Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism After Total Joint Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nElbuluk, Ameer M; Kim, Kelvin Y; Chen, Kevin K; Anoushiravani, Afshin A; Schwarzkopf, Ran; Iorio, Richard\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of respiratory synchronized compression devices (RSCDs) versus nonsynchronized intermittent pneumatic compression devices (NSIPCDs) in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total joint arthroplasty. A systematic literature review was conducted. Data regarding surgical procedure, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, mortality, and adverse events were abstracted. Compared with control groups, the risk ratio of deep vein thrombosis development was 0.51 with NSIPCDs and 0.47 with RSCDs. This review demonstrates that RSCDs may be marginally more effective at preventing VTE events than NSIPCDs. Furthermore, the addition of mechanical prophylaxis to any chemoprophylactic regimen increases VTE prevention. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We developed a new device for dynamic gap balancing, which can offer constant load to the gap between the femur and tibia, using pneumatic pressure during range of motion. To determine the amount of distraction force for the new device, 3 experienced surgeons' manual distraction force was measured using a conventional spreader. A new device called the consistent load pneumatic tensor was developed on the basis of the biomechanical tests. Reliability testing for the new device was performed using 5 cadaveric knees by the same surgeons. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. The distraction force applied to the new pneumatic tensioning device was determined to be 150 N. The interobserver reliability was very good for the newly tested spreader device with ICCs between 0.828 and 0.881. The new pneumatic tensioning device can enable us to properly evaluate the soft tissue balance throughout the range of motion during TKA with acceptable reproducibility.\n\nCompressed gas manifold\n\nDOEpatents\n\nHildebrand, Richard J.; Wozniak, John J.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nA compressed gas storage cell interconnecting manifold including a thermally activated pressure relief device, a manual safety shut-off valve, and a port for connecting the compressed gas storage cells to a motor vehicle power source and to a refueling adapter.

These advantages are adapted to some research areas, such as industrial lines, medical and nursing cares, and rehabilitation tools. However, the pneumatic system needs several devices; compressor, air tube, and control valve. This research aim to downsize pneumatic system. In this paper, a new method of multiplex pneumatic transmission for multi-pneumatic servo system is proposed. The valve for this system consists of two vibrators supported by springs, which was designed with simple and cheap structure. The working principle of the valve is vibrators resonance from multiplex pneumatic transmission and it is possible to work as ON/OFF valves without electric wire. Dynamic simulation was used to confirm the working principle of the resonance driving system. A prototype device confirming the principle was designed and developed based on the simulation. The experiments show that this new control system works very well to control two separated valves through single pneumatic tube.\n\n[Effect of pneumatic compression in connection with ergotherapeutic treatment of Colles' fracture. A clinical controlled trial].\n\nPubMed\n\nSvensson, B H; Frellsen, M B; Basse, P N; Bliddal, H; Caspers, J; Parby, K\n\n1993-02-15\n\nWe followed forty women with functional deficits in the wrist and hand after sustaining a Colles' fracture. The women participated in occupational therapy three times a week for three weeks. At the initial evaluation, after three weeks, and at a three month evaluation, we measured the following: range of joint movement, grip strength, hand volume (oedema), pain and ADL. There was significant improvement in most of the parameters measured after three weeks of occupational therapy, with a less significant improvement from three weeks to three months. Seventeen of the forty women received twenty minutes of intermittent pneumatic compression before occupational therapy. These patients showed significant improvement in wrist extension, compared with the control group of twenty-three patients. Occupational therapy is recommended for patients showing a functional deficit after Colles' fracture. Intermittent pneumatic compression is recommended as a supplement to occupational therapy.\n\nSliding pressure control valve for pneumatic hammer drill\n\nDOEpatents\n\nPolsky, Yarom [Albuquerque, NM\n\n2011-08-30\n\nA pneumatic device control apparatus and method comprising a ported valve slidably fitted over a feed tube of the pneumatic device, and using a compliant biasing device to constrain motion of the valve to provide asymmetric timing for extended pressurization of a power chamber and reduced pressurization of a return chamber of the pneumatic device.

The pneumatic logic circuits perform various combinational and sequential logic calculations with binary pneumatic signals (atmosphere and vacuum), producing cascadable outputs based on Boolean operations. A complex microprocessor is constructed from combinations of various logic circuits and receives pneumatically encoded serial commands at a single input line. The device then decodes the temporal command sequence by spatial parallelization, computes necessary logic calculations between parallelized command bits, stores command information for signal transportation and maintenance, and finally executes the command for the target devices. Thus, such pneumatic microprocessors will function as a universal on-chip control platform to perform complex parallel operations for large-scale integrated microfluidic devices. To demonstrate the working principles, we have built 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit microprecessors to control various target devices for applications such as four color dye mixing, and multiplexed channel fluidic control. By significantly reducing the need for external controllers, the digital pneumatic microprocessor can be used as a universal on-chip platform to autonomously manipulate microfluids in a high throughput manner.

J.\n\n2006-10-01\n\nThe pneumatic cylinder is the most typical actuator in the pneumatic equipment, and its mechanism is so simple that it is often used to operate point to point driving without the feedback loop in various automatic machines. But, the energy efficiency of pneumatic system is very poor compared with electrical systems and hydraulic systems. So, it is very important to discuss the energy saving for the pneumatic cylinder systems. In this thesis, we proposed three methods to apply the reduction in the air consumed for pneumatic cylinder systems. An air charge accumulator is used to absorb the exhausted compress air and a boost valve boosted the air to the higher pressure for used again. From the experiments, the direct used cylinder exhaust air may save about 40% of compress air.\n\nA durability study of a paracorporeal pulsatile electro-mechanical pneumatic biventricular assist device.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, Hyuk; Lee, Heung-Man; Nam, Kyoung Won; Choi, Jaesoon; Lee, Jung-Joo; Kim, Ho Chul; Song, Seung Joon; Ahn, Chi Bum; Son, Ho Sung; Lim, Choon Hak; Son, Kuk Hui; Park, Yong Doo; Jeong, Gi Seok; Sun, Kyung\n\n2011-06-01\n\nIn 2002, the paracorporeal pulsatile electro-mechanical pneumatic ventricular assist device (VAD) began to be developed by the Korea Artificial Organ Center at Korea University under a Health & Medical Technology Research and Development program which finished in 2008. In vitro durability testing was conducted on the paracorporeal pulsatile pneumatic VAD to determine device durability and to evaluate device failures. The 1- and 2-year reliability of the paracorporeal pulsatile pneumatic VAD was shown to be 91.2% and 54.9%, respectively, with an 80% confidence level. Failure modes were analyzed using fault tree analysis, with customized software continuously acquiring data during the test period. After this period, 21 in vivo animal tests were done, with 14 cases of left atrium to left ventricle (LV) inflow cannulation (36Fr)/outflow grafting to descending aorta, and seven cases of apex cannulation of LV to descending aorta (12 mm). The longest postoperative day (182 days) in Korea was recently recorded in in vivo animal testing (bovine, 90 kg, male, 3.5-4.0 L/min flow rate, and 55 bpm). Â© 2011, Copyright the Authors.

The present study aims at investigating the mechanisms underlying this attenuation, which include local metabolic mechanisms, desensitization of mechanosensitive pathways, and reduced efficacy of the muscle pump. In 10 healthy subjects, short sequences of mechanical compressions ( n = 3-6; 150 mmHg) of the lower leg were delivered at different interstimulus intervals (ranging from 20 to 160 s) through a customized pneumatic device. Hemodynamic monitoring included near-infrared spectroscopy, detecting tissue oxygenation and blood volume in calf muscles, and simultaneous echo-Doppler measurement of arterial (superficial femoral artery) and venous (femoral vein) blood flow. The results indicate that 1 ) a long-lasting (>100 s) increase in local tissue oxygenation follows compression-induced hyperemia, 2 ) compression-induced hyperemia exhibits different patterns of attenuation depending on the interstimulus interval, 3 ) the amplitude of the hyperemia is not correlated with the amount of blood volume displaced by the compression, and 4 ) the extent of attenuation negatively correlates with tissue oxygenation ( r â=â-0,78, P < 0.05). Increased tissue oxygenation appears to be the key factor for the attenuation of hyperemia upon repetitive compressive stimulation. Tissue oxygenation monitoring is suggested as a useful integration in medical treatments aimed at improving local circulation by repetitive tissue compression. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study shows that 1 ) the hyperemia induced by muscle compression produces a long-lasting increase in tissue oxygenation, 2 ) the hyperemia produced by subsequent muscle compressions exhibits different patterns of attenuation at different interstimulus intervals, and 3 ) the extent of attenuation of the compression-induced hyperemia is proportional to the level of\n\nGround reaction force comparison of bilateral symmetry with pneumatic resistance squat device and free weights - biomed 2009.\n\nPubMed\n\nPaulus, David C; Schilling, Brian K\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe unloading of spaceflight leads to bone and muscle atrophy, and a pneumatic resistance squat exercise countermeasure has the potential to provide optimized controllable resistance in a lightweight and compact configuration. However each end of the barbell in the proposed device is connected to a separate resistance cylinder which could lead to bilaterally asymmetric loading. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to compare the unilateral ground reaction forces (GRF) of the new squat device compared to free weights. Four previously trained men (mean +/- SD; age = 20+/-2 years, body mass = 99+/-18 kg) performed three sets of three repetitions of maximal exertion squat exercises with pneumatically controlled constant resistance and free weights each with a resistance level set to half of the body weight of each subject. Unilateral GRF data for each lifting modality at the negative to positive transition of the squat exercise was measured with a force plate under each foot. The pneumatic resistance GRF (N; mean +/- SD) was 749+/-114 on the left leg and 786+/-123 on the right leg and the free weight GRF was 786+/-114 left and 861+/-111 right resulting in a 5% difference between left and right GRF with pneumatics and 9% difference with free weights. The correlation coefficient between left and right GRF was 0.92 with pneumatics and 0.80 with free weights. Because the pneumatic device elicited more bilaterally symmetric GRF than traditional free weights, the separate resistance cylinders are an acceptable design configuration.\n\nAcute oxygenation changes on ischemic foot of a novel intermittent pneumatic compression device and of an existing sequential device in severe peripheral arterial disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) improves haemodynamics in peripheral arterial disease (PAD), but its effects on foot perfusion were scarcely studied. In severe PAD patients we measured the foot oxygenation changes evoked by a novel intermittent IPC device (GP), haemodynamics and compliance to the treatment. Reference values were obtained by a sequential foot-calf device (SFC). Methods Twenty ischemic limbs (Ankle-Brachial Indexâ=â0.5âÂ±â0.2) of 12 PAD patients (7 male, age: 74.5âÂ±â10.8 y) with an interval of 48âÂ±â2Â hours received a 35Â minute treatment in supine position with two IPC devices: i) a Gradient Pump (GP), which slowly inflates a single thigh special sleeve and ii) an SFC (ArtAssistÂ®, ACI Medical, San Marcos, CA, USA), which rapidly inflates two foot-calf sleeves. Main outcome measure: changes of oxygenated haemoglobin at foot (HbO2foot) by continuous near-infrared spectroscopy recording and quantified as area-under-curve (AUC) for periods of 5Â minutes. Other measures: haemodynamics by echo-colour Doppler (time average velocity (TAV) and blood flow (BF) in the popliteal artery and in the femoral vein), patient compliance by a properly developed form. Results All patients completed the treatment with GP, 9 with SFC. HbO2foot during the working phase, considered as average value of the 5Â minutes periods, increased with GP (AUC 458âÂ±â600 to 1216âÂ±â280) and decreased with SFC (AUC 231âÂ±â946 to â1088âÂ±â346), significantly for most periods (Pâ<â0.05). The GP treatment was associated to significant haemodynamic changes from baseline to end of the treatment (TAVâ=â10.2âÂ±â3.3 to 13.5âÂ±â5.5Â cm/sec, Pâ=â0.004; BFâ=â452.0âÂ±â187.2 to 607.9âÂ±â237.8Â ml/sec, Pâ=â0.0001), not observed with SFC (TAVâ=â11.2âÂ±â3.4 to 11.8âÂ±â4.3Â cm/sec; BFâ=â513.8âÂ±â203.7 to 505.9âÂ±â166.5Â ml/min, Pâ=ân.s.).

Rehabilitation robots demand the highest standards in this respect because the machine interacts directly with weak persons who are often sensitive to pain. Using novel soft fluidic actuators with rotary elastic chambers (REC actuators), compact, lightweight, and cost-effective therapeutic devices can be developed. This article describes modular design and control strategies for new assistive acting robotic devices for upper and lower extremities. Due to the inherent compliance and natural back-drivability of pneumatic REC actuators, these movement therapy devices provide gentle treatment, whereby the interaction forces between humans and the therapy device are estimated without the use of expensive force/torque sensors. An active model-based gravity compensation based on separated models of the robot and of the individual patient's extremity provides the basis for effective assistive control. The utilization of pneumatic actuators demands a special safety concept, which is merged with control algorithms to provide a sufficient level of safeness and to catch any possible system errors and/or emergency situations. A self-explanatory user interface allows for easy, intuitive handling. Prototypes are very comfortable for use due to several control routines that work in the background. Assistive devices have been tested extensively with several healthy persons; the knee/hip movement therapy device is now under clinical trials at the Clinic for Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery at the Klinikum Stuttgart.\n\nA High-Speed Continuous Recording High Flow Gas Sampler for Measuring Methane Emissions from Pneumatic Devices at Oil and Natural Gas Production Facilities\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFerrara, T.; Howard, T. M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nStudies attempting to reconcile facility level emission estimates of sources at oil and gas facilities with basin wide methane flux measurements have had limited success. Pneumatic devices are commonly used at oil and gas production facilities for process control or liquid pumping. These devices are powered by pressurized natural gas from the well, so they are known methane sources at these sites. Pneumatic devices are estimated to contribute 14% to 25% of the total greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from production facilities. Measurements of pneumatic devices have shown that malfunctioning or poorly maintained control systems may be emitting significantly more methane than currently estimated. Emission inventories for these facilities use emission factors from EPA that are based on pneumatic device measurements made in the early 1990's. Recent studies of methane emissions from production facilities have attempted to measure emissions from pneumatic devices by several different methods. These methods have had limitations including alteration of the system being measured, the inability to distinguish between leaks and venting during normal operation, or insufficient response time to account of the time based emission events. We have developed a high speed recording high flow sampler that is capable of measuring the transient emissions from pneumatic devices. This sampler is based on the well-established high flow measurement technique used in oil and gas for quantifying component leak rates. In this paper we present the results of extensive laboratory controlled release testing. Additionally, test data from several field studies where this sampler has been used to measure pneumatic device emissions will be presented.\n\nThromboprophylaxis using combined intermittent pneumatic compression and pharmacologic prophylaxis versus pharmacologic prophylaxis alone in critically ill patients: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nArabi, Yaseen M; Alsolamy, Sami; Al-Dawood, Abdulaziz; Al-Omari, Awad; Al-Hameed, Fahad; Burns, Karen E A; Almaani, Mohammed; Lababidi, Hani; Al Bshabshe, Ali; Mehta, Sangeeta; Al-Aithan, Abdulsalam M; Mandourah, Yasser; Almekhlafi, Ghaleb; Finfer, Simon; Abdukahil, Sheryl Ann I; Afesh, Lara Y; Dbsawy, Maamoun; Sadat, Musharaf\n\n2016-08-03\n\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a common problem in critically ill patients. Pharmacologic prophylaxis is currently the standard of care based on high-level evidence from randomized controlled trials. However, limited evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices. The Pneumatic compREssion for preventing VENous Thromboembolism (PREVENT trial) aims to determine whether the adjunct use of IPC with pharmacologic prophylaxis compared to pharmacologic prophylaxis alone in critically ill patients reduces the risk of VTE. The PREVENT trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial, which will recruit 2000 critically ill patients from over 20 hospitals in three countries. The primary outcome is the incidence of proximal lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) within 28Â days after randomization. Radiologists interpreting the scans are blinded to intervention allocation, whereas the patients and caregivers are unblinded. The trial has 80Â % power to detect a 3Â % absolute risk reduction in proximal DVT from 7 to 4Â %. The first patient was enrolled in July 2014. As of May 2015, a total of 650 patients have been enrolled from 13 centers in Saudi Arabia, Canada and Australia. The first interim analysis is anticipated in July 2016. We expect to complete recruitment by 2018. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02040103 (registered on 3 November 2013).

This health problem comes from the lack of appropriate technology such as low noise devices which in turn results from the lack of scientific knowledge about designing reduced noise devices. This study contributes to the design improvement of pneumatic nailing devices through identifying the noise sources and developing the simulation tool required to redesign the pneumatic nailing device. To identify the noise sources, the study uses a combination of two complementary experimental approaches. The first makes use of time-synchronized data analysis of several variables during the machine operation. This strategy allows identifying the physical processes and provides a detailed separation of the noise generation mechanisms in successive time sequences. However, since multiple noise sources radiate at the same time, this observation approach is not sufficient for noise source identification and ranking. Thus, it is completed by a selective wrapping and muffler procedure. This technique provides overall generated noise associated with each process, as well as ranking of the three major sources: (1) exhaust noise, (2) machine body vibrations, and (3) workpiece vibrations. A special investigation is conducted on this third one with two cases: a workpiece/worktable setup representative of the actual field usage of a nailing device and a workpiece/sandbox setup used in a standardized laboratory test. The study evaluates the efficiency of the workpiece/sandbox setup in reducing the workpiece radiation and obtains a typical workpiece contribution on an actual worksite. To provide a simulation tool, a dynamic model of the pneumatic nailing device needs to be developed. Dynamic modeling of the nailing device requires mathematical modeling of the physical processes involved in its operation. All of these\n\nCompliant Buckled Foam Actuators and Application in Patient-Specific Direct Cardiac Compression.\n\nPubMed\n\nMac Murray, Benjamin C; Futran, Chaim C; Lee, Jeanne; O'Brien, Kevin W; Amiri Moghadam, Amir A; Mosadegh, Bobak; Silberstein, Meredith N; Min, James K; Shepherd, Robert F\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe introduce the use of buckled foam for soft pneumatic actuators. A moderate amount of residual compressive strain within elastomer foam increases the applied force â¼1.4âÃ or stroke â¼2âÃ compared with actuators without residual strain. The origin of these improved characteristics is explained analytically. These actuators are applied in a direct cardiac compression (DCC) device design, a type of implanted mechanical circulatory support that avoids direct blood contact, mitigating risks of clot formation and stroke. This article describes a first step toward a pneumatically powered, patient-specific DCC design by employing elastomer foam as the mechanism for cardiac compression. To form the device, a mold of a patient's heart was obtained by 3D printing a digitized X-ray computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan into a solid model. From this model, a soft, robotic foam DCC device was molded. The DCC device is compliant and uses compressed air to inflate foam chambers that in turn apply compression to the exterior of a heart. The device is demonstrated on a porcine heart and is capable of assisting heart pumping at physiologically relevant durations (â¼200âms for systole and â¼400âms for diastole) and stroke volumes (â¼70âmL). Although further development is necessary to produce a fully implantable device, the material and processing insights presented here are essential to the implementation of a foam-based, patient-specific DCC design.\n\nPneumatic strength assessment device: design and isometric measurement.\n\nPubMed\n\nPaulus, David C; Reiser, Raoul F; Troxell, Wade O\n\n2004-01-01\n\nIn order to load a muscle optimally during resistance exercise, it should be heavily taxed throughout the entire range of motion for that exercise. However, traditional constant resistance squats only tax the lower-extremity muscles to their limits at the \"sticking region\" or a critical joint configuration of the exercise cycle. Therefore, a linear motion (Smith) exercise machine was modified with pneumatics and appropriate computer control so that it could be capable of adjusting force to control velocity within a repetition of the squat exercise or other exercise performed with the device. Prior to application of this device in a dynamic squat setting, the maximum voluntary isometric force (MVIF) produced over a spectrum of knee angles is needed. This would reveal the sticking region and overall variation in strength capacity. Five incremental knee angles (90, 110, 130, 150, and 170 degrees, where 180 degrees defined full extension) were examined. After obtaining university-approved informed consent, 12 men and 12 women participated in the study. The knee angle was set, and the pneumatic cylinder was pressurized such that the subject could move the barbell slightly but no more than two-centimeters. The peak pressure exerted over a five-second maximum effort interval was recorded at each knee angle in random order and then repeated. The average of both efforts was then utilized for further analysis. The sticking region occurred consistently at a 90 degrees knee angle, however, the maximum force produced varied between 110 degrees and 170 degrees with the greatest frequency at 150 degrees for both men and women. The percent difference between the maximum and minimum MVIF was 46% for men and 57% for women.\n\nReport from the 2013 meeting of the International Compression Club on advances and challenges of compression therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nDelos Reyes, Arthur P; Partsch, Hugo; Mosti, Giovanni; Obi, Andrea; Lurie, Fedor\n\n2014-10-01\n\nThe International Compression Club, a collaboration of medical experts and industry representatives, was founded in 2005 to develop consensus reports and recommendations regarding the use of compression therapy in the treatment of acute and chronic vascular disease.

These issues cause difficulty with mobility and contribute to an unsatisfactory quality of life for patients. Because it is urgently necessary to improve patients' safety and quality of life, we have developed a compact, low-noise, portable VAD driver by utilizing an electrohydraulic actuator consisting of a brushless DC motor and a regenerative pump. This unit can be actuated for as long as 2 h with two rechargeable lightweight batteries as well as with external AC power. It is compact in size (33 x 25 x 43 cm) and light in weight (13 kg), and the unit is carried on a mobile wheeled cart. In vitro testing with a Toyobo-NCVC VAD demonstrated a sufficient pumping capacity of up to 8 l/min. We conclude that this newly-developed compact portable driver can provide a better quality of life and improved safety for patients using protracted pneumatic VAD support.\n\n21 CFR 882.4370 - Pneumatic cranial drill motor.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2011-04-01 2011-04-01 false Pneumatic cranial drill motor. 882.4370 Section 882.4370 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (CONTINUED) MEDICAL DEVICES NEUROLOGICAL DEVICES Neurological Surgical Devices Â§ 882.4370 Pneumatic cranial...\n\n21 CFR 882.4370 - Pneumatic cranial drill motor.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false Pneumatic cranial drill motor. 882.4370 Section 882.4370 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (CONTINUED) MEDICAL DEVICES NEUROLOGICAL DEVICES Neurological Surgical Devices Â§ 882.4370 Pneumatic cranial...\n\nEffect of sequential pneumatic compression therapy on venous blood velocity, refilling time, pain and quality of life in women with varicose veins: a randomized control study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYamany, Abeer; Hamdy, Bassant\n\n2016-01-01\n\n[Purpose] The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sequential pneumatic compression therapy on venous blood flow, refilling time, pain level, and quality of life in women with varicose veins. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-eight females with varicose veins were selected and randomly allocated to a control group, and experimental group. Maximum and mean venous blood velocities, the refilling time, pain by visual analog scale and quality of life by Aberdeen Varicose Veins Questionnaire were measured in all patients before and after six weeks of treatment. Both groups received lower extremity exercises; in addition, patients in the experimental group received sequential pneumatic compression therapy for 30 minutes daily, five days a week for six weeks. [Results] All measured parameters improved significantly in both groups, comparison of post treatment measurements between groups showed that the maximum and mean blood flow velocity, the pain level, and quality of life were significantly higher in the experimental group compared with the control group. On the other hand there was no significant difference between groups for refilling time. [Conclusion] Sequential pneumatic compression therapy with the applied parameters was an effective modality for increasing venous blood flow, reducing pain, and improving quality of women life with varicose veins.

O.; Radu, I.; Babanatsas, T.; Babanatis Merce, R. M.; Kiss, I.; Gaspar, M. C.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe paper presents a pneumatic system with two oscillating masses. The system is composed of a cylinder (framework) with mass m1, which has a piston with mass m2 inside. The cylinder (framework system) has one supplying channel for compressed air and one evicting channel for each work chamber (left and right of the piston). Functionality of the piston position comparatively with the cylinder (framework) is possible through the supplying or evicting of compressed air. The variable force that keeps the movement depends on variation of the pressure that is changing depending on the piston position according to the cylinder (framework) and to the section form that is supplying and evicting channels with compressed air. The paper presents the physical model/pattern, the mathematical model/pattern (differential equations) and numerical solution of the differential equations in hypothesis with the section form of supplying and evicting channels with compressed air is rectangular (variation linear) or circular (variation nonlinear).\n\nWave energy devices with compressible volumes.\n\nPubMed\n\nKurniawan, Adi; Greaves, Deborah; Chaplin, John\n\n2014-12-08\n\nWe present an analysis of wave energy devices with air-filled compressible submerged volumes, where variability of volume is achieved by means of a horizontal surface free to move up and down relative to the body.

Secondary objectives were to determine the impact of continuous control of Pcuff, and cuff shape on microaspiration of gastric contents. Methods Prospective randomized controlled study. All patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation â¥48Â h were eligible. The first 32 patients were intubated with tapered polyurethane-cuffed, and the 32 following patients were intubated with cylindrical polyurethane-cuffed tracheal tubes. Patients randomly received 24Â h of continuous control of Pcuff using a pneumatic device (NostenÂ®), and 24Â h of routine care of Pcuff using a manometer. Target Pcuff was 25 cmH2O. Pcuff was continuously recorded, and pepsin was quantitatively measured in all tracheal aspirates during these periods. Results The pneumatic device was efficient in controlling Pcuff (med [IQ] 26 [24, 28] vs 22 [20, 28] cmH2O, during continuous control of Pcuff and routine care, respectively; pâ=â0.017). In addition, percentage of patients with underinflation (31% vs 68%) or overinflation (53% vs 100%) of tracheal cuff, and percentage of time spent with underinflation (0.9 [0, 17] vs 14% [4, 30]) or overinflation (0 [0, 2] vs 32% [9, 54]) were significantly (pâ<â0.001) reduced during continuous control of Pcuff compared with routine care.

This method of prefabrication and embedding is simple, requires no advanced fabrication, and is compatible with soft lithography. Because prefabrication allows many identical valves to be made at one time, the performance across different valves made in the same manner is reproducible. In addition, the performance of a single valve is reproducible over many cycles of opening and closing: an embedded solenoid valve opened and closed a microfluidic channel more than 100,000 times with no apparent deterioration in its function. It was possible to combine all three types of prefabricated valves in a single microfluidic device to control chemical gradients in a microfluidic channel temporally and spatially.\n\nIncorporation of prefabricated screw, pneumatic, and solenoid valves into microfluidic devices\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHulme, S.

In this multicenter randomized trial, critically ill patients receiving pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis will be randomized to an IPC or a no IPC (control) group. The primary outcome is \"incident\" proximal lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) within 28 days after randomization. Radiologists interpreting the lower-extremity ultrasonography will be blinded to intervention allocation, whereas the patients and treating team will be unblinded. The trial has 80% power to detect a 3% absolute risk reduction in the rate of proximal DVT from 7% to 4%. Consistent with international guidelines, we have developed a detailed plan to guide the analysis of the PREVENT trial. This plan specifies the statistical methods for the evaluation of primary and secondary outcomes, and defines covariates for adjusted analyses a priori. Application of this statistical analysis plan to the PREVENT trial will facilitate unbiased analyses of clinical data. ClinicalTrials.gov , ID: NCT02040103 .

PCDs range in complexity from simple to technologically advanced. The objective of this prospective, randomized study was to determine whether an advanced PCD (APCD) provides better outcomes as measured by arm edema and tissue water reductions compared to a standard PCD (SPCD) in patients with arm lymphedema after breast cancer treatment. Subjects were randomized to an APCD (Flexitouch system, HCPCS E0652) or SPCD (Bio Compression 2004, HCPCS E0651) used for home treatment 1 h/day for 12 weeks. Pressure settings were 30 mmHg for the SPCD and upper extremity treatment program (UE01) with standard pressure for the APCD. Thirty-six subjects (18 per group) with unilateral upper extremity lymphedema with at least 5% arm edema volume at the time of enrollment, completed treatments over the 12-week period. Arm volumes were determined from arm girth measurements and suitable model calculations, and tissue water was determined based on measurements of the arm tissue dielectric constant (TDC). The APCD-treated group experienced an average of 29% reduction in edema compared to a 16% increase in the SPCD group. Mean changes in TDC values were a 5.8% reduction for the APCD group and a 1.9% increase for the SPCD group. This study suggests that for the home maintenance phase of treatment of arm lymphedema secondary to breast cancer therapy, the adjuvant treatment with an APCD provides better outcomes than with a SPCD.\n\n[Effectiveness of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) on thrombosis prophylaxis: a systematic literature review].\n\nPubMed\n\nRohrer, Ottilia; Eicher, Manuela\n\n2006-06-01\n\nDespite changes in patient demographics and short-ened length of hospital stay deep vein thrombosis (DVT) remains a major health care problem which may lead to a variety of other high risk complications. Current treatment guidelines focus on preventive measures. Beside drug therapy, physical measures executed by nursing professionals exist, the outcomes of which are discussed controversially. Based on 25 studies that were found in MEDLINE and the Cochrane library, this systematic literature review identifies the effectiveness of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) on thrombosis prophylaxis. In almost all medical settings IPC contributes to a significant reduction of the incidence of DVT. At the same time, IPC has minimal negative side effects and is also cost effective. Correct application of IPC and patient compliance are essential to achieve its effectiveness. An increased awareness within the healthcare team in identifying the risk for and implementing measures against DVT is needed. Guidelines need to be developed in order to improve the effectiveness of thrombosis prophylaxis with the implementation of IPC.\n\nExperimental device for measuring the dynamic properties of diaphragm motors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFojtÃ¡Å¡ek, Kamil; DvoÅÃ¡k, LukÃ¡Å¡; MejzlÃ­k, Jan\n\nThe subject of this paper is to design and description of the experimental device for the determination dynamic properties of diaphragm pneumatic motors.

The regulator provides a flow of gas through a restictor to the pneumatic gap sensor, and the transducer translates the changes in the gas pressure caused by the proximity of the casting wheel to the pneumatic gap sensor outlet into a signal intelligible to a control device. The relative positions of the casting nozzle and casting wheel can thereby be selectively adjusted to continually maintain a predetermined distance between their adjacent surfaces.

The slave robot consists of a piezoelectrically actuated 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot for needle placement with an integrated fiber optic force sensor (1-DOF axial force measurement) using the Fabry-Perot interferometry (FPI) sensing principle; it is configured to operate inside the bore of the MRI scanner during imaging. By leveraging the advantages of pneumatic and piezoelectric actuation in force and position control respectively, we have designed a pneumatically actuated master robot (haptic device) with strain gauge based force sensing that is configured to operate the slave from within the scanner room during imaging. The slave robot follows the insertion motion of the haptic device while the haptic device displays the needle insertion force as measured by the FPI sensor. Image interference evaluation demonstrates that the telesurgery system presents a signal to noise ratio reduction of less than 17% and less than 1% geometric distortion during simultaneous robot motion and imaging. Teleoperated needle insertion and rotation experiments were performed to reach 10 targets in a soft tissue-mimicking phantom with 0.70 Â± 0.35 mm Cartesian space error.\n\nExperimental study of cooling performance of pneumatic synthetic jet with singular slot rectangular orifice\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYu, Roger Ho Zhen; Ismail, Mohd Azmi bin; Ramdan, Muhammad Iftishah; Mustaffa, Nur Musfirah binti\n\n2017-03-01\n\nSynthetic Jet generates turbulence flow in cooling the microelectronic devices. In this paper, the experiment investigation of the cooling performance of pneumatic synthetic jet with single slot rectangular orifices at low frequency motion is presented. The velocity profile at the end of the orifice was measured and used as characteristic performance of synthetic jet in the present study. Frequencies of synthetic jet and the compressed air pressure supplied to the pneumatic cylinder (1bar to 5bar) were the parameters of the flow measurement. The air velocity of the synthetic jet was measured by using anemometer air flow meter. The maximum air velocity was 0.5 m/s and it occurred at frequency motion of 8 Hz. The optimum compressed air supplied pressure of the synthetic jet study was 4 bar. The cooling performance of synthetic jet at several driven frequencies from 0 Hz to 8 Hz and heat dissipation between 2.5W and 9W were also investigate in the present study. The results showed that the Nusselt number increased and thermal resistance decreased with both frequency and Reynolds number. The lowest thermal resistance was 5.25Â°C/W and the highest Nusselt number was 13.39 at heat dissipation of 9W and driven frequency of 8Hz.\n\nHigh-pressure portable pneumatic drive unit.\n\nPubMed\n\nHete, B F; Savage, M; Batur, C; Smith, W A; Golding, L A; NosÃ©, Y\n\n1989-12-01\n\nThe left ventricular assist device (LVAD) of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) is a single-chamber assist pump, driven by a high-pressure pneumatic cylinder.

ONG production sites have multiple emission sources including storage tank venting, enclosed combustion devices, engine exhaust, pneumatic controllers and uncontrolled leaks. Accounting for up to 37.8 percent of CH4 emissions, pneumatic controllers are one of the most significant sources of CH4 in ONG production field operations. Recent measurement studies used the only commercially-available high volume sampling (HVS) technology (Bacharach Hi Flow Sampler, Bacharach, Inc., New Kensington, PA) to quantify CH4 emission rates of pneumatic devices on ONG production pads and compare to inventory estimates. Other studies indicate that this HVS may malfunction, causing underestimates of emissions in certain scenarios encountered in ONG production and should not be used for some sources such as heavy emissions from condensate storage tanks. The HVS malfunction can occur on relatively large emissions, where the measured leak concentrations exceed 5%, and is ascribed to a sensor transition failure in the instrument. The HVS malfunction is believed to be exacerbated by several factors (large emission rates, amount of non-CH4 HCs in the emission stream, non-optimal HVS calibration frequency, firmware, and emission measurement coupling geometries). The degree to which HVS measurements of emissions from pneumatic co\n\nNoise reduction of pneumatic nailers of up to 8 bar working pressure, considering handling properties and service life\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDamberg, W.; Floegel, K.; Sahm, A.\n\n1983-02-01\n\nA noise reduction device for pneumatic nailers was developed. Conditions of use, range of products available, market regulations and measuring methods were studied. Ease of operation, service life, functional reliability and maintenance capacity were studied. Results show that the essential noise sources of the device are the compressed air blasts of the working and relation phases and the impact of the piston on the bumper. Packages of measures implemented on a laboratory scale indicate noise reduction possibilities for nailers in the short, medium and long term. The sound level of a single shot can be reduced from 110 dB to 93 dB.\n\nHemodynamic effect and safety of intermittent sequential pneumatic compression leg sleeves in patients with congestive heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nBickel, Amitai; Shturman, Alexander; Sergeiev, Michael; Ivry, Shimon; Eitan, Arieh; Atar, Shaul\n\n2014-10-01\n\nPneumatic leg sleeves are widely used after prolonged operations for prevention of venous stasis. In healthy volunteers they increase cardiac function. We evaluated the hemodynamic effects and safety of intermittent sequential pneumatic compression (ISPC) leg sleeves in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). We studied 19 patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction and CHF. ISPC leg sleeves, each with 10 air cells, were operated by a computerized compressor, exerting 2 cycles/min. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters were measured before, during, and after ISPC activation. The baseline mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 29 Â± 9.2%, median 32%, range 10%-40%. Cardiac output (from 4.26 to 4.83 L/min; P = .008) and stroke volume (from 56.1 to 63.5 mL; P = .029) increased significantly after ISPC activation, without a reciprocal increase in heart rate, and declined after sleeve deactivation. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased significantly (from 1,520 to 1,216 dyne-s/cm5; P = .0005), and remained lower than the baseline level throughout the study. There was no detrimental effect on diastolic function and no adverse clinical events, despite increased pulmonary venous return. ISPC leg sleeves in patients with chronic CHF do not exacerbate symptoms and transiently improve cardiac output through an increase in stroke volume and a reduction in SVR.

The annulus contains inert gas which acts as a pneumatic spring. Upon increasing cover gas pressure which depresses the level in the wide leg and greatly increases the level in the narrow leg, the pneumatic spring is compressed, and resists further level changes, thus preventing radioactive cover gas from bubbling through the seal.\n\nReal-Time Mobile Device-Assisted Chest Compression During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSarma, Satyam; Bucuti, Hakiza; Chitnis, Anurag; Klacman, Alex; Dantu, Ram\n\n2017-07-15\n\nPrompt administration of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a key determinant of survival from cardiac arrest. Strategies to improve CPR quality at point of care could improve resuscitation outcomes. We tested whether a low cost and scalable mobile phone- or smart watch-based solution could provide accurate measures of compression depth and rate during simulated CPR. Fifty health care providers (58% intensive care unit nurses) performed simulated CPR on a calibrated training manikin (Resusci Anne, Laerdal) while wearing both devices. Subjects received real-time audiovisual feedback from each device sequentially. Primary outcome was accuracy of compression depth and rate compared with the calibrated training manikin. Secondary outcome was improvement in CPR quality as defined by meeting both guideline-recommend compression depth (5 to 6Â cm) and rate (100 to 120/minute). Compared with the training manikin, typical error for compression depth was <5Â mm (smart phone 4.6Â mm; 95% CI 4.1 to 5.3Â mm; smart watch 4.3Â mm; 95% CI 3.8 to 5.0Â mm). Compression rates were similarly accurate (smart phone Pearson's RÂ = 0.93; smart watch RÂ = 0.97). There was no difference in improved CPR quality defined as the number of sessions meeting both guideline-recommended compression depth (50 to 60Â mm) and rate (100 to 120 compressions/minute) with mobile device feedback (60% vs 50%; pÂ = 0.3). Sessions that did not meet guideline recommendations failed primarily because of inadequate compression depth (46 Â± 2Â mm). In conclusion, a mobile device application-guided CPR can accurately track compression depth and rate during simulation in a practice environment in accordance with resuscitation guidelines.

A TPS is a set of instructions for certain procedures or tasks, and serves as the documentation for the tasks. TPSs guide task leaders and technicians throughout the work procedures, safely, informing them of what steps will be hazardous, what precautions must be taken, and what to do in the case of an accident or emergency. I was placed in Boeing's Resupply & Return Division (R&R). R&R is responsible for sending up food and supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) with the use of three Italian Multi Purpose Logistics Modules - Leonardo, Donatello, and Raffaello. The supplies are loaded into Resupply Stowage Racks (RSRs) or Resupply Stowage Platforms (RSPs) (though, both are usually referred to as racks), depending on their size and shape. These racks are loaded into the modules with the help of a specialized crane known as the Rack Insertion Device (RID). The RID rests on four pneumatic air jacks, these allow for an operator to raise or lower the RID. The pneumatic air system supplies the air jacks with the necessary air pressure required to lift the RID.\n\n21 CFR 890.3610 - Rigid pneumatic structure orthosis.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false Rigid pneumatic structure orthosis. 890.3610 Section 890.3610 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (CONTINUED) MEDICAL DEVICES PHYSICAL MEDICINE DEVICES Physical Medicine Prosthetic Devices Â§ 890.3610 Rigid...\n\n21 CFR 890.3610 - Rigid pneumatic structure orthosis.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2011-04-01 2011-04-01 false Rigid pneumatic structure orthosis. 890.3610 Section 890.3610 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (CONTINUED) MEDICAL DEVICES PHYSICAL MEDICINE DEVICES Physical Medicine Prosthetic Devices Â§ 890.3610 Rigid...\n\n21 CFR 890.3610 - Rigid pneumatic structure orthosis.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2013-04-01 2013-04-01 false Rigid pneumatic structure orthosis. 890.3610 Section 890.3610 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (CONTINUED) MEDICAL DEVICES PHYSICAL MEDICINE DEVICES Physical Medicine Prosthetic Devices Â§ 890.3610 Rigid...\n\n21 CFR 890.3610 - Rigid pneumatic structure orthosis.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2012 CFR\n\n2012-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2012-04-01 2012-04-01 false Rigid pneumatic structure orthosis. 890.3610 Section 890.3610 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (CONTINUED) MEDICAL DEVICES PHYSICAL MEDICINE DEVICES Physical Medicine Prosthetic Devices Â§ 890.3610 Rigid...\n\n21 CFR 890.3610 - Rigid pneumatic structure orthosis.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2014 CFR\n\n2014-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2014-04-01 2014-04-01 false Rigid pneumatic structure orthosis. 890.3610 Section 890.3610 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (CONTINUED) MEDICAL DEVICES PHYSICAL MEDICINE DEVICES Physical Medicine Prosthetic Devices Â§ 890.3610 Rigid...\n\n21 CFR 870.2780 - Hydraulic, pneumatic, or photoelectric plethysmographs.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2011-04-01 2011-04-01 false Hydraulic, pneumatic, or photoelectric plethysmographs. 870.2780 Section 870.2780 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (CONTINUED) MEDICAL DEVICES CARDIOVASCULAR DEVICES Cardiovascular Monitoring Devices...\n\n21 CFR 870.2780 - Hydraulic, pneumatic, or photoelectric plethysmographs.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false Hydraulic, pneumatic, or photoelectric plethysmographs. 870.2780 Section 870.2780 Food and Drugs FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (CONTINUED) MEDICAL DEVICES CARDIOVASCULAR DEVICES Cardiovascular Monitoring Devices...\n\nValidity and reliability of a controlled pneumatic resistance exercise device.\n\nPubMed\n\nPaulus, David C; Reynolds, Michael C; Schilling, Brian K\n\n2008-01-01\n\nDuring the concentric portion of the free-weight squat exercise, accelerating the mass from rest results in a fluctuation in ground reaction force.
