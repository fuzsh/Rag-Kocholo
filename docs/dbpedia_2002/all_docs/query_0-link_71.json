        "text": "Critical appraisal of laparoscopic vs open rectal cancer surgery\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTan, Winson Jianhong; Chew, Min Hoe; Dharmawan, Angela Renayanti; Singh, Manraj; Acharyya, Sanchalika; Loi, Carol Tien Tau; Tang, Choong Leong\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAIM: To evaluate the long-term clinical and oncological outcomes of laparoscopic rectal resection (LRR) and the impact of conversion in patients with rectal cancer. METHODS: An analysis was performed on a prospective database of 633 consecutive patients with rectal cancer who underwent surgical resection. Patients were compared in three groups: Open surgery (OP), laparoscopic surgery, and converted laparoscopic surgery. Short-term outcomes, long-term outcomes, and survival analysis were compared. RESULTS: Among 633 patients studied, 200 patients had successful laparoscopic resections with a conversion rate of 11.1% (25 out of 225). Factors predictive of survival on univariate analysis include the laparoscopic approach (P = 0.016), together with factors such as age, ASA status, stage of disease, tumor grade, presence of perineural invasion and vascular emboli, circumferential resection margin < 2 mm, and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. The survival benefit of laparoscopic surgery was no longer significant on multivariate analysis (P = 0.148). Neither 5-year overall survival (70.5% vs 61.8%, P = 0.217) nor 5-year cancer free survival (64.3% vs 66.6%, P = 0.854) were significantly different between the laparoscopic group and the converted group. CONCLUSION: LRR has equivalent long-term oncologic outcomes when compared to OP. Laparoscopic conversion does not confer a worse prognosis.

The aim of this study was to assess the urogenital functional outcomes of patients undergoing laparoscopic and robotic rectal cancer surgery. Urological and sexual functions were assessed using gender-specific validated standardised questionnaires. Questionnaires were sent a minimum of 6Â months after surgery, and patients were asked to report their urogenital function pre- and post-operatively, allowing changes in urogenital function to be identified. Questionnaires were sent to 158 patients (89 laparoscopy, 69 robotic) of whom 126 (80Â %) responded. Seventy-eight (49 male, 29 female) of the responders underwent laparoscopic and 48 (35 male, 13 female) robotic surgery. Male patients in the robotic group deteriorated less across all components of sexual function and in five components of urological function. Composite male urological and sexual function score changes from baseline were better in the robotic cohort (pÂ <Â 0.001). In females, there was no difference between the two groups in any of the components of urological or sexual function. However, composite female urological function score change from baseline was better in the robotic group (pÂ =Â 0.003). Robotic rectal cancer surgery might offer better post-operative urological and sexual outcomes compared to laparoscopic surgery in male patients and better urological outcomes in females. Larger scale, prospective randomised control studies including urodynamic assessment of urogenital function are required to validate these results.\n\nRobotic Versus Laparoscopic Stapler Use for Rectal Transection in Robotic Surgery for Cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nAtasoy, Deniz; Aytac, Erman; Ozben, Volkan; Bayraktar, Onur; Erenler Bayraktar, Ilknur; Aghayeva, Afag; Baca, Bilgi; Hamzaoglu, Ismail; Karahasanoglu, Tayfun\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThis study was designed to compare the operative and short-term postoperative outcomes of the robotic and laparoscopic staplers in patients undergoing rectal surgery for cancer. Between December 2014 and April 2017, patients consecutively undergoing robotic rectal surgery for cancer were included in this study. Patients were grouped into two according to the type of staplers for rectal transection [Robotic (45-mm) versus Laparoscopic (60-mm) linear staplers]. Patient demographics, pathologic data, perioperative outcomes, and short-term results were compared. One hundred seven patients met our inclusion criteria. The number of male patients were higher in robotic stapler group than in the laparoscopic stapler group (55% versus 76%, Pâ=â.03). Age (59 versus 63 years, Pâ=â.40), body mass index (27 versus 27âkg/m 2 , Pâ=â.60), American Society of Anesthesiologists score (2 versus 2, Pâ=â.20), number of prior abdominal operations (31% versus 20%, Pâ=â.22) and number of patients having neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (34% versus 36%, Pâ=â.86) were comparable between the groups. The numbers of cartridges used were similar regardless of the type of staplers (2 versus 2, Pâ=â.58). The overall complication was similar between the groups (24% versus 31%, Pâ=â.32). Leak rates were 5% (nâ=â2) and 3% (nâ=â2) in the robotic and laparoscopic stapler groups, respectively (pâ=â1). There was no mortality. This is the first study evaluating the role of robotic stapler specifically for rectal transection in comparative manner. The use of robotic stapler for rectal transection was safe and feasible in rectal surgery for cancer.\n\nRobot-assisted Versus Laparoscopic Surgery for Rectal Cancer: A Phase II Open Label Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Min Jung; Park, Sung Chan; Park, Ji Won; Chang, Hee Jin; Kim, Dae Yong; Nam, Byung-Ho; Sohn, Dae Kyung; Oh, Jae Hwan\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe phase II randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the outcomes of robot-assisted surgery with those of laparoscopic surgery in the patients with rectal cancer. The feasibility of robot-assisted surgery over laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer has not been established yet. Between February 21, 2012 and March 11, 2015, patients with rectal cancer (cT1-3NxM0) were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1 to either robot-assisted or laparoscopic surgery, and stratified per sex and administration of preoperative chemoradiotherapy. The primary outcome was the quality of total mesorectal excision (TME) specimen. Secondary outcomes were the circumferential and distal resection margins, the number of harvested lymph nodes, morbidity, bowel function recovery, and quality of life. A total of 163 patients were randomly assigned to the robot-assisted (n = 81) and laparoscopic (n = 82) surgery groups, and 139 patients were eligible for the analyses (73 vs 66, respectively). One patient (1.2%) in the robot-assisted group was converted to open surgery. The TME quality did not differ between the robot-assisted and laparoscopic groups (80.3% vs 78.1% complete TME, respectively; 18.2% vs 21.9% nearly complete TME, respectively; P = 0.599). The resection margins, number of harvested lymph nodes, morbidity, and bowel function recovery also were not significantly different. On analyzing quality of life, scores of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ C30) and EORTC QLQ CR38 were similar in the 2 groups, but in the EORTC QLQ CR 38 questionnaire, sexual function 12 months postoperatively was better in the robot-assisted group than in the laparoscopic group (P = 0.03). Robot-assisted surgery in rectal cancer showed TME quality comparable with that of laparoscopic surgery, and it demonstrated similar postoperative morbidity, bowel function recovery, and quality of life.\n\nTotal mesorectal excision for mid and low rectal cancer: Laparoscopic vs robotic surgery\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFeroci, Francesco; Vannucchi, Andrea; Bianchi, Paolo Pietro; Cantafio, Stefano; Garzi, Alessia; Formisano, Giampaolo; Scatizzi, Marco\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAIM: To compare the short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic and robotic surgery for middle and low rectal cancer. METHODS: This is a retrospective study on a prospectively collected database containing 111 patients who underwent minimally invasive rectal resection with total mesorectal excision (TME) with curative intent between January 2008 and December 2014 (robot, n = 53; laparoscopy, n = 58). The patients all had a diagnosis of middle and low rectal adenocarcinoma with stageâ I-III disease. The median follow-up period was 37.4 mo. Perioperative results, morbidity a pathological data were evaluated and compared. The 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were calculated and compared. RESULTS: Patients were comparable in terms of preoperative and demographic parameters. The median surgery time was 192 min for laparoscopic TME (L-TME) and 342 min for robotic TME (R-TME) (P < 0.001). There were no differences found in the rates of conversion to open surgery and morbidity. The patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery stayed in the hospital two days longer than the robotic group patients (8 d for L-TME and 6 d for R-TME, P < 0.001). The pathologic evaluation showed a higher number of harvested lymph nodes in the robotic group (18 for R-TME, 11 for L-TME, P < 0.001) and a shorter distal resection margin for laparoscopic patients (1.5 cm for L-TME, 2.5 cm for R-TME, P < 0.001). The three-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were similar between groups. CONCLUSION: Both L-TME and R-TME achieved acceptable clinical and oncologic outcomes. The robotic technique showed some advantages in rectal surgery that should be validated by further studies. PMID:27053852\n\nLaparoscopic surgery is feasible for the treatment of rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nJu, Wencui; Luo, Xiaoyong; Han, Baowei\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThis case-control study aimed to clarify the short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemo radiotherapy compared with conventional open resection. Between January 2008 and December 2014, a series of 227 patients with rectal cancer underwent radical surgery after neoadjuvant chemo radiotherapy. Age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, clinical stage, and type of resection were matched by propensity scoring and 106 patients (53 patients with laparoscopic total mesorectal excision and 53 patients with open resection) were selected for analysis. There were no significant differences in the clinicopathological features between the two groups. With regard to short-term outcomes, blood loss, postoperative analgesia and hospital stay were significantly shorter in the laparoscopy group than in the open group, whereas operative time was significantly longer in the laparoscopy group than in the open group. The overall morbidity was similar in the two groups. There were no significant differences in the 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates between the two groups. In summary, laparoscopic surgery may be both feasible and efficient compared with open resection for rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemo radiotherapy.\n\nApplication of objective clinical human reliability analysis (OCHRA) in assessment of technical performance in laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nFoster, J D; Miskovic, D; Allison, A S; Conti, J A; Ockrim, J; Cooper, E J; Hanna, G B; Francis, N K\n\n2016-06-01\n\nLaparoscopic rectal resection is technically challenging, with outcomes dependent upon technical performance. No robust objective assessment tool exists for laparoscopic rectal resection surgery. This study aimed to investigate the application of the objective clinical human reliability analysis (OCHRA) technique for assessing technical performance of laparoscopic rectal surgery and explore the validity and reliability of this technique. Laparoscopic rectal cancer resection operations were described in the format of a hierarchical task analysis. Potential technical errors were defined. The OCHRA technique was used to identify technical errors enacted in videos of twenty consecutive laparoscopic rectal cancer resection operations from a single site. The procedural task, spatial location, and circumstances of all identified errors were logged. Clinical validity was assessed through correlation with clinical outcomes; reliability was assessed by test-retest. A total of 335 execution errors identified, with a median 15 per operation. More errors were observed during pelvic tasks compared with abdominal tasks (pÂ <Â 0.001). Within the pelvis, more errors were observed during dissection on the right side than the left (pÂ =Â 0.03). Test-retest confirmed reliability (rÂ =Â 0.97, pÂ <Â 0.001). A significant correlation was observed between error frequency and mesorectal specimen quality (r sÂ =Â 0.52, pÂ =Â 0.02) and with blood loss (r sÂ =Â 0.609, pÂ =Â 0.004). OCHRA offers a valid and reliable method for evaluating technical performance of laparoscopic rectal surgery.\n\nPerioperative pain after robot-assisted versus laparoscopic rectal resection.\n\nPubMed\n\nTolstrup, Rikke; Funder, Jonas Amstrup; Lundbech, Liselotte; Thomassen, Niels; Iversen, Lene Hjerrild\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn order to improve the surgical treatment of rectal cancer, robot-assisted laparoscopy has been introduced. The robot has gained widespread use; however, the scientific basis for treatment of rectal cancer is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether robot-assisted laparoscopic rectal resection cause less perioperative pain than standard laparoscopic resection measured by the numerical rating scale (NRS score) as well as morphine consumption. Fifty-one patients were randomized to either laparoscopic or robot-assisted rectal resection at the Department of Surgery at Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark. The intra-operative analgetic consumption was recorded prospectively and registered in patient records. Likewise all postoperative medicine administration including analgesia was recorded prospectively at the hospital medical charts. All morphine analogues were converted into equivalent oral morphine by a converter. Postoperative pain where measured by numeric rating scale (NRS) every hour at the postoperative care unit and three times a day at the ward. Opioid consumption during operation was significantly lower during robotic-assisted surgery than during laparoscopic surgery (p=0.0001). However, there were no differences in opioid consumption or NRS in the period of recovery. We found no differences in length of surgery between the two groups; however, ten patients from the laparoscopic group underwent conversion to open surgery compared to one from the robotic group (p=0.005). No significant difference between groups with respect to complications where found. In the present study, we found that patients who underwent rectal cancer resection by robotic technique needed less analgetics during surgery than patients operated laparoscopically. We did, however, not find any difference in postoperative pain score or morphine consumption postoperatively between the robotic and laparoscopic group.\n\nUptake and patient outcomes of laparoscopic colon and rectal cancer surgery in a publicly funded system and following financial incentives.\n\nPubMed\n\nSimunovic, Marko; Baxter, Nancy N; Sutradhar, Rinku; Liu, Ning; Cadeddu, Margherita; Urbach, David\n\n2013-11-01\n\nTo assess patterns of uptake and outcomes of laparoscopic colon and rectal cancer surgery in Ontario, and the potential influence of surgical fee incentives instituted on October 1, 2005. We used Ontario administrative databases from fiscal years 2002 to 2009. Study outcomes were uptake rates of laparoscopic surgery, hospital length of stay, 30-day operative mortality, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival. The main descriptor for multivariable regression models was a 5% increase in rate of laparoscopic colon cancer surgery in the previous year. The annual rate of laparoscopic colon and rectal cancer surgery, respectively, rose from 8.7 to 38.9% and from 4.8 to 19.6%. The greatest increase in rate of laparoscopic colon surgery occurred shortly after October 1, 2005. For each 5% increase in rate of laparoscopic surgery, the odds of 30-day mortality was 1.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.01, p = 0.264], the hazard of cancer-specific survival was 1.0 (95% CI 0.97-1.00, p = 0.139), the hazard of overall survival was 1.0 (95% CI 0.98-1.00, p = 0.051), and length of hospital stay was lower (estimate = -0.10, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.06, p < 0.001). In Ontario by the year 2009, 39% of colon and 20% of rectal cancer surgery was provided laparoscopically. Increased rates were associated with a minimal decrease in hospital length of stay and no changes in 30-day mortality, cancer-specific survival, or overall survival. Financial incentives were likely responsible for the marked increase in laparoscopic colon cancer surgery observed after October 1, 2005.\n\nRobotic versus laparoscopic proctectomy for rectal cancer: a meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMemon, Sameer; Heriot, Alexander G; Murphy, Declan G; Bressel, Mathias; Lynch, A Craig\n\n2012-07-01\n\nRobot-assisted laparoscopic surgery is being performed more frequently for the minimally invasive management of rectal cancer. The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the clinical and oncologic safety and efficacy of robot-assisted versus conventional laparoscopic surgery. A search of the Medline and Embase databases was performed for studies that compared clinical or oncologic outcomes of conventional laparoscopic proctectomy with robot-assisted laparoscopic proctectomy for rectal cancer. The methodological quality of the selected studies was critically assessed to identify studies suitable for inclusion. Meta-analysis was performed by a random effects model and analyzed by Review Manager. Clinical outcomes evaluated were conversion rates, operation times, length of hospital stay, and complications. Oncologic outcomes evaluated were circumferential margin status, number of lymph nodes collected, and distal resection margin lengths. Eight comparative studies were assessed for quality, and seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Two studies were matched case-control studies, and five were unmatched. A total of 353 robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery proctectomy cases and 401 conventional laparoscopic surgery proctectomy cases were analyzed. Robotic surgery was associated with a significantly lower conversion rate (P=0.03; 95% confidence interval 1-12). There was no difference in complications, circumferential margin involvement, distal resection margin, lymph node yield, or hospital stay (P=NS). Robot-assisted surgery decreased the conversion rate compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery. Other clinical outcomes and oncologic outcomes were equivalent. The benefits of robotic rectal cancer surgery may differ between population groups.\n\nLaparoscopic treatment of rectal cancer and lateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Are they obsolete?\n\nPubMed\n\nToda, Shigeo; Kuroyanagi, Hiroya; Matoba, Shuichiro; Hiramatsu, Kosuke; Okazaki, Naoto; Tate, Tomohiro; Tomizawa, Kenji; Hanaoka, Yutaka; Moriyama, Jin\n\n2018-05-24\n\nLaparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer offers favorable short term results without compromising long term oncological outcomes so far, according to the data from major trials. Therefore it is being considered as a standard option for rectal cancer surgery. The learning curve of laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery is generally longer compared to colon cancer. Appropriate standardization and training of laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery is required. Several RCTs suggested the potential negative effect on quality of resected specimen, which can increase local recurrence. The long term outcomes especially local recurrence rate of these RCTs are awaited. Lateral pelvic lymph node dissection (LPLND) has a certain effect of reducing local recurrence of rectal cancer even after neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Since LPLND is associated with postoperative morbidity, we should carefully select the candidate to maximize the effect of LPLND and minimize the morbidity caused by LPLND. Recent advancement in imaging study such as CT and MRI enables us to find the suitable candidates for LPLND. The morbidity caused by LPLND could be reduced by minimally invasive surgeries such as laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery. We have to improve oncological outcomes and reduce morbidity by the multidisciplinary strategy for rectal cancer including total mesorectal excision, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and LPLND together with laparoscopic surgery.\n\nOutcomes of robotic versus laparoscopic surgery for mid and low rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and the effect of learning curve\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHuang, Yu-Min; Huang, Yan Jiun; Wei, Po-Li\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer is safe and can accelerate recovery without compromising oncological outcomes. However, such a surgery is technically demanding, limiting its application in nonspecialized centers. The operational features of a robotic system may facilitate overcoming this limitation. Studies have reported the potential advantages of robotic surgery. However, only a few of them have featured the application of this surgery in patients with advanced rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (nCRT). From January 2012 to April 2015, after undergoing nCRT, 40 patients with mid or low rectal cancer were operated using the robotic approach at our institution. Another 38 patients who were operated using the conventional laparoscopic approach were matched to patients in the robotic group by sex, age, the body mass index, and procedure. All operations were performed by a single surgical team. The clinicopathological characteristics and short-term outcomes of these patients were compared. To assess the effect of the learning curve on the outcomes, patients in the robotic group were further subdivided into 2 groups according to the sequential order of their procedures, with an equal number of patients in each group. Their outcome measures were compared. The robotic and laparoscopic groups were comparable with regard to pretreatment characteristics, rectal resection type, and pathological examination result. After undergoing nCRT, more patients in the robotic group exhibited clinically advanced diseases. The complication rate was similar between the 2 groups. The operation time and the time to the resumption of a soft diet were significantly prolonged in the robotic group. Further analysis revealed that the difference was mainly observed in the first robotic group. No significant difference was observed between the second robotic and laparoscopic groups. Although the robotic\n\nLearning curve for robotic-assisted laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nJimÃ©nez-RodrÃ­guez, Rosa M; DÃ­az-PavÃ³n, JosÃ© Manuel; de la Portilla de Juan, Fernando; Prendes-Sillero, Emilio; Dussort, Hisnard Cadet; Padillo, Javier\n\n2013-06-01\n\nOne of the main uses of robotic assisted abdominal surgery is the mesorectal excision in patients with rectal cancer. The aim of the present study is to analyse the learning curve for robotic assisted laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer. We included in our study 43 consecutive rectal cancer resections (16 females and 27 males) performed from January 2008 through December 2010. Mean age of patients was 66âÂ±â9.0Â years. Surgical procedures included both abdomino-perineal and anterior resections. We analysed the following parameters: demographic data of the patients included in the study, intra- and postoperative data, time taking to set up the robot for operations (set-up or docking time), operative time, intra- and postoperative complications, conversion rates and pathological specimen features. The learning curve was analysed using cumulative sum (CUSUM) methodology. The procedures understudied included seven abdomino-perineal resections and 36 anterior resections. In our series of patients, mean robotic set-up time was 62.9âÂ±â24.6Â min, and the mean operative time was 197.4âÂ±â44.3Â min. Once we applied CUSUM methodology, we obtained two graphs for CUSUM values (operating time and success), both of them showing three well-differentiated phases: phase 1 (the initial 9-11 cases), phase 2 (the middle 12 cases) and phase 3 (the remaining 20-22 cases). Phase 1 represents initial learning; phase 2 plateau represents increased competence in the use of the robotic system, and finally, phase 3 represents the period of highest skill or mastery with a reduction in docking time (pâ=â0.000), but a slight increase in operative time (pâ=â0.007). The CUSUM curve shows three phases in the learning and use of robotic assisted rectal cancer surgery which correspond to the phases of initial learning of the technique, consolidation and higher expertise or mastery. The data obtained suggest that the estimated learning curve for robotic assisted rectal cancer\n\n[A case of laparoscopic surgery for a rectal carcinoid after ALTA therapy for an internal hemorrhoid].\n\nPubMed\n\nAomatsu, Naoki; Nakamura, Masanori; Hasegawa, Tsuyoshi; Nakao, Shigetomi; Uchima, Yasutake; Aomatsu, Keiho\n\n2014-11-01\n\nWe report a case of laparoscopic surgery for a rectal carcinoid after aluminum potassium and tannic acid (ALTA) therapy for an internal hemorrhoid. A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of bleeding during defecation. He was diagnosed via anoscopy with Goligher grade II internal hemorrhoids. Examination via colonoscopy revealed 2 yellowish submucosal tumors in the lower rectum that were 5mm and 10mm in diameter. A rectal carcinoid tumor was diagnosed based on histopathology. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated no metastases to the liver or lymph nodes. First, we performed ALTA therapy for the internal hemorrhoids. Two weeks later, we performed laparoscopic-assisted low anterior resection (D2) for the rectal carcinoid. The patient was discharged without complications and has not experienced recurrence during the 2 years of follow-up care.\n\nRobotic surgery for rectal cancer: current immediate clinical and oncological outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nAraujo, Sergio Eduardo Alonso; Seid, Victor Edmond; Klajner, Sidney\n\n2014-10-21\n\nLaparoscopic rectal surgery continues to be a challenging operation associated to a steep learning curve.

In our hospital, preoperative chemotherapy based on oxaliplatin was administered for locally advanced rectal cancer with a tumor diameter of 5 cm or more and half semicircularity or more, and curative resection with laparoscopic surgery was performed after tumor shrinkage. We have experienced 25 cases that underwent preoperative chemotherapy for local advanced rectal cancer in our hospital from May 2012 to April 2016. No tumor increased in size during preoperative chemotherapy and there were no cases where R0 resection was impossible. In addition, no distant metastasis during chemotherapy was observed. Postoperative complications were observed in 3 cases(12%), and anastomotic leakage was observed in 1 case (4%), but conservative treatment was possible. Multidisciplinary treatment of preoperative chemotherapy and surgery should be considered as a therapeutic strategy for locally advanced rectal cancer, mainly in medical institutions without radiation treatment facilities.\n\nEffect of Robotic-Assisted vs Conventional Laparoscopic Surgery on Risk of Conversion to Open Laparotomy Among Patients Undergoing Resection for Rectal Cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPigazzi, Alessio; Marshall, Helen; Croft, Julie; Corrigan, Neil; Copeland, Joanne; Quirke, Phil; West, Nick; Rautio, Tero; Thomassen, Niels; Tilney, Henry; Gudgeon, Mark; Bianchi, Paolo Pietro; Edlin, Richard; Hulme, Claire; Brown, Julia\n\n2017-01-01\n\nImportance Robotic rectal cancer surgery is gaining popularity, but limited data are available regarding safety and efficacy. Objective To compare robotic-assisted vs conventional laparoscopic surgery for risk of conversion to open laparotomy among patients undergoing resection for rectal cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized clinical trial comparing robotic-assisted vs conventional laparoscopic surgery among 471 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma suitable for curative resection conducted at 29 sites across 10 countries, including 40 surgeons. Recruitment of patients was from January 7, 2011, to September 30, 2014, follow-up was conducted at 30 days and 6 months, and final follow-up was on June 16, 2015. Interventions Patients were randomized to robotic-assisted (nâ=â237) or conventional (nâ=â234) laparoscopic rectal cancer resection, performed by either high (upper rectum) or low (total rectum) anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection (rectum and perineum). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was conversion to open laparotomy. Secondary end points included intraoperative and postoperative complications, circumferential resection margin positivity (CRM+) and other pathological outcomes, quality of life (36-Item Short Form Survey and 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), bladder and sexual dysfunction (International Prostate Symptom Score, International Index of Erectile Function, and Female Sexual Function Index), and oncological outcomes. Results Among 471 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 64.9 [11.0] years; 320 [67.9%] men), 466 (98.9%) completed the study. The overall rate of conversion to open laparotomy was 10.1%: 19 of 236 patients (8.1%) in the robotic-assisted laparoscopic group and 28 of 230 patients (12.2%) in the conventional laparoscopic group (unadjusted risk differenceâ=â4.1% [95% CI, â1.4% to 9.6%]; adjusted odds ratioâ=â0.61 [95% CI, 0.31 to 1.21]; Pâ=â.16).

The role of minimally invasive proctectomy in rectal cancer is controversial. In the era of value-based medicine, costs must be considered along with outcomes. Primary rectal cancer patients undergoing curative intent proctectomy at our institution between 2010 and 2014 were included. Patients were grouped by approach [open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and robotic surgery (RS)] on an intent-to-treat basis. Groups were compared by direct costs of hospitalization for the primary resection, 30-day readmissions, and ileostomy closure and for short-term outcomes. A total of 488 patients were evaluated; 327 were men (67%), median age was 59 (27-93) years, and restorative procedures were performed in 333 (68.2%). Groups were similar in demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment details. Significant outcome differences between groups were found in operative and anesthesia times (longer in the RS group), and in estimated blood loss, intraoperative transfusion, length of stay, and postoperative complications (all higher in the open surgery group). No significant differences were found in short-term oncologic outcomes. Direct cost of the hospitalization for primary resection and total direct cost (including readmission/ileostomy closure hospitalizations) were significantly greater in the RS group. The laparoscopic and open approaches to proctectomy in patients with rectal cancer provide similar value. If robotic proctectomy is to be widely applied in the future, the costs of the procedure must be reduced.\n\nMeta-analysis of robotic and laparoscopic surgery for treatment of rectal cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Shuang; Jiang, Hong-Gang; Chen, Zhi-Heng; Zhou, Shu-Yang; Liu, Xiao-Sun; Yu, Ji-Ren\n\n2011-12-21\n\nTo conduct a meta-analysis to determine the relative merits of robotic surgery (RS) and laparoscopic surgery (LS) for rectal cancer. A literature search was performed to identify comparative studies reporting perioperative outcomes for RS and LS for rectal cancer. Pooled odds ratios and weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using either the fixed effects model or random effects model. Eight studies matched the selection criteria and reported on 661 subjects, of whom 268 underwent RS and 393 underwent LS for rectal cancer. Compared the perioperative outcomes of RS with LS, reports of RS indicated favorable outcomes considering conversion (WMD: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.11-0.58; P = 0.001). Meanwhile, operative time (WMD: 27.92, 95% CI: -13.43 to 69.27; P = 0.19); blood loss (WMD: -32.35, 95% CI: -86.19 to 21.50; P = 0.24); days to passing flatus (WMD: -0.18, 95% CI: -0.96 to 0.60; P = 0.65); length of stay (WMD: -0.04; 95% CI: -2.28 to 2.20; P = 0.97); complications (WMD: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.71-1.55; P = 0.82) and pathological details, including lymph nodes harvested (WMD: 0.41, 95% CI: -0.67 to 1.50; P = 0.46), distal resection margin (WMD: -0.35, 95% CI: -1.27 to 0.58; P = 0.46), and positive circumferential resection margin (WMD: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.12-2.39; P = 0.42) were similar between RS and LS. RS for rectal cancer is superior to LS in terms of conversion. RS may be an alternative treatment for rectal cancer. Further studies are required.\n\nEffect of Laparoscopic-Assisted Resection vs Open Resection on Pathological Outcomes in Rectal Cancer: The ALaCaRT Randomized Clinical Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nStevenson, Andrew R L; Solomon, Michael J; Lumley, John W; Hewett, Peter; Clouston, Andrew D; Gebski, Val J; Davies, Lucy; Wilson, Kate; Hague, Wendy; Simes, John\n\n2015-10-06\n\nLaparoscopic procedures are generally thought to have better outcomes than open procedures. Because of anatomical constraints, laparoscopic rectal resection may not be better because of limitations in performing an adequate cancer resection. To determine whether laparoscopic resection is noninferior to open rectal cancer resection for adequacy of cancer clearance. Randomized, noninferiority, phase 3 trial (Australasian Laparoscopic Cancer of the Rectum; ALaCaRT) conducted between March 2010 and November 2014. Twenty-six accredited surgeons from 24 sites in Australia and New Zealand randomized 475 patients with T1-T3 rectal adenocarcinoma less than 15 cm from the anal verge. Open laparotomy and rectal resection (nâ=â237) or laparoscopic rectal resection (nâ=â238). The primary end point was a composite of oncological factors indicating an adequate surgical resection, with a noninferiority boundary of Îâ=â-8%. Successful resection was defined as meeting all the following criteria: (1) complete total mesorectal excision, (2) a clear circumferential margin (â¥1 mm), and (3) a clear distal resection margin (â¥1 mm). Pathologists used standardized reporting and were blinded to the method of surgery. A successful resection was achieved in 194 patients (82%) in the laparoscopic surgery group and 208 patients (89%) in the open surgery group (risk difference of -7.0% [95% CI, -12.4% to â]; Pâ=â.38 for noninferiority). The circumferential resection margin was clear in 222 patients (93%) in the laparoscopic surgery group and in 228 patients (97%) in the open surgery group (risk difference of -3.7% [95% CI, -7.6% to 0.1%]; Pâ=â.06), the distal margin was clear in 236 patients (99%) in the laparoscopic surgery group and in 234 patients (99%) in the open surgery group (risk difference of -0.4% [95% CI, -1.8% to 1.0%]; Pâ=â.67), and total mesorectal excision was complete in 206 patients (87%) in the laparoscopic surgery group and 216 patients (92%) in\n\nCurrent State of Laparoscopic Colonic Surgery in Austria: A National Survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nKlugsberger, Bettina; Haas, Dietmar; Oppelt, Peter; Neuner, Ludwig; Shamiyeh, Andreas\n\n2015-12-01\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that laparoscopic colonic resection has significant benefits in comparison with open approaches in patients with benign and malignant disease. The proportion of colonic and rectal resections conducted laparoscopically in Austria is not currently known; the aim of this study was to evaluate the current status of laparoscopic colonic surgery in Austria. A questionnaire was distributed to all general surgical departments in Austria. In collaboration with IMAS, an Austrian market research institute, an online survey was used to identify laparoscopic and open colorectal resections performed in 2013. The results were compared with data from the National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD), in which administrative in-patient data were also collected from all general surgical departments in Austria in 2013. Fifty-three of 99 surgical departments in Austria responded (53.5%); 4335 colonic and rectal resections were carried out in the participating departments, representing 50.5% of all NHMD-recorded colorectal resections (nâ=â8576) in Austria in 2013. Of these 4335 colonic and rectal resections, 2597 (59.9%) were carried out using an open approach, 1674 (38.6%) were laparoscopic, and an exact classification was not available for 64 (1.5%). Among the NHMD-recorded colonic and rectal resections, 6342 (73.9%) were carried out with an open approach, and 2234 (26.1%) were laparoscopic. The proportion of colorectal resections that are carried out laparoscopically is low (26.1%). Technical challenges and a learning curve with a significant number of cases may be reasons for the slow adoption of laparoscopic colonic surgery.\n\nCritical analysis of the literature investigating urogenital function preservation following robotic rectal cancer surgery\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPanteleimonitis, Sofoklis; Ahmed, Jamil; Harper, Mick; Parvaiz, Amjad\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAIM To analyses the current literature regarding the urogenital functional outcomes of patients receiving robotic rectal cancer surgery. METHODS A comprehensive literature search of electronic databases was performed in October 2015. The following search terms were applied: ârectal cancerâ or âcolorectal cancerâ and robot* or âda Vinciâ and sexual or urolog* or urinary or erect* or ejaculat* or impot* or incontinence. All original studies examining the urological and/or sexual outcomes of male and/or female patients receiving robotic rectal cancer surgery were included. Reference lists of all retrieved articles were manually searched for further relevant articles. Abstracts were independently searched by two authors. RESULTS Fifteen original studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 1338 patients were included; 818 received robotic, 498 laparoscopic and 22 open rectal cancer surgery. Only 726 (54%) patients had their urogenital function assessed via means of validated functional questionnaires. From the included studies, three found that robotic rectal cancer surgery leads to quicker recovery of male urological function and five of male sexual function as compared to laparoscopic surgery. It is unclear whether robotic surgery offers favourable urogenital outcomes in the long run for males. In female patients only two studies assessed urological and three sexual function independently to that of males. In these studies there was no difference identified between patients receiving robotic and laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery. However, in females the presented evidence was very limited making it impossible to draw any substantial conclusions. CONCLUSION There seems to be a trend towards earlier recovery of male urogenital function following robotic surgery. To evaluate this further, larger well designed studies are required.

Forty patients with rectal cancer, who underwent laparoscopic TME with anal sphincter preservation from June 2005 to June 2007, were randomly divided into ultrasonic scalpel group and monopolar ES group, prospectively. White blood cells (WBC) were measured before and after operation, operative time, blood loss, pelvic volume of drainage, time of anal exhaust, visual analogue scales (VAS) and surgery-related complications were recorded. All the operations were successful; no one was converted to open procedure. No significant differences were observed in terms of preoperative and postoperative d 1 and d 3 WBC counts (P=0.493, P=0.375, P=0.559), operation time (P=0.235), blood loss (P=0.296), anal exhaust time (P=0.431), pelvic drainage volume and VAS in postoperative d 1 (P=0.431, P=0.426) and d 3 (P=0.844, P=0.617) between ES group and US group. The occurrence of surgery-related complications such as anastomotic leakage and wound infection was the same in the two groups. ES is a safe and feasible tool as same as US used in laparoscopic TME with anal sphincter preservation for rectal cancer on the basis of the skillful laparoscopic technique and the complete understanding of laparoscopic pelvic anatomy. Application of ES can not only reduce the operation costs but also benefit the popularization of laparoscopic operation for rectal cancer patients.\n\nUltrasonically activated scalpel versus monopolar electrocautery shovel in laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhou, Bao-Jun; Song, Wei-Qing; Yan, Qing-Hui; Cai, Jian-Hui; Wang, Feng-An; Liu, Jin; Zhang, Guo-Jian; Duan, Guo-Qiang; Zhang, Zhan-Xue\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAIM: To investigate the feasibility and safety of monopolar electrocautery shovel (ES) in laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) with anal sphincter preservation for rectal cancer in order to reduce the cost of the laparoscopic operation, and to compare ES with the ultrasonically activated scalpel (US).

Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have confirmed that the implementation of these evidence-based detailed perioperative care protocols is useful for early recovery of patients after colorectal resection. Patients cared for based on these protocols had a rapid recovery of bowel movement, shortened length of hospital stay, and fewer complications compared with traditional care programs. However, most of the previous evidence was obtained from studies of early rehabilitation programs adapted to open colonic resection. Currently, limited evidence exists on the effects of early rehabilitation after laparoscopic rectal resection, although this procedure seems to be associated with a higher morbidity than that reported with traditional care. In this article, we review previous studies and guidelines on early rehabilitation programs in patients undergoing rectal surgery. We investigated the status of early rehabilitation programs in rectal surgery and analyzed the limitations of these studies. We also summarized indications and detailed protocol components of current early rehabilitation programs after rectal surgery, focusing on laparoscopic resection.

METHODS: A systematic review of current literature via PubMed and Embase search engines was performed to identify relevant articles from january 2007 to november 2013. The keywords used were: ârobotic surgeryâ, âsurgical roboticsâ, âlaparoscopic computer-assisted surgeryâ, âcolectomyâ and ârectal resectionâ. RESULTS: After the initial screen of 380 articles, 20 papers were selected for review. A total of 1062 patients (male 64.0%) with a mean age of 61.1 years and body mass index of 24.9 kg/m2 were included in the review. Out of 1062 robotic-assisted operations, 831 (78.2%) anterior and low anterior resections, 132 (12.4%) intersphincteric resection with coloanal anastomosis, 98 (9.3%) abdominoperineal resections and 1 (0.1%) Hartmannâs operation were included in the review. Robotic rectal surgery was associated with longer operative time but with comparable oncological results and anastomotic leak rate when compared with laparoscopic rectal surgery. CONCLUSION: Robotic colorectal surgery has continued to evolve to its current state with promising results; feasible surgical option with low conversion rate and comparable short-term oncological results. The challenges faced with robotic surgery are for more high quality studies to justify its cost.

Recent reports demonstrate that neoadjuvant imatinib treatment improves surgical outcomes in patients with a rectal GIST, and there are only a few reports of the effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery for a rectal GIST. A 46-year-old man was found to have a rectal GIST that measured 80 mm and was located on the anterior wall of the lower rectum. After 6 months treatment with imatinib, the tumor decreased in size to 37 mm, and laparoscopic low anterior resection was performed. The patient is currently alive without any evidence of recurrence 37 months after surgery. Neoadjuvant imatinib should be a treatment of choice for a large rectal GIST. When marked tumor shrinkage is achieved, laparoscopic surgery may be the preferred procedure.\n\nMinimally invasive surgery for rectal cancer: Are we there yet?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChampagne, Bradley J; Makhija, Rohit\n\n2011-01-01\n\nLaparoscopic colon surgery for select cancers is slowly evolving as the standard of care but minimally invasive approaches for rectal cancer have been viewed with significant skepticism. This procedure has been performed by select surgeons at specialized centers and concerns over local recurrence, sexual dysfunction and appropriate training measures have further hindered widespread acceptance. Data for laparoscopic rectal resection now supports its continued implementation and widespread usage by expeienced surgeons for select patients. The current controversies regarding technical approaches have created ambiguity amongst opinion leaders and are also addressed in this review.

Between October 1998 and December 2006, 203 patients with rectal malignancies underwent colectomy; 146 of them had colectomy with the traditional technique (OS), while 57 underwent resection of rectal cancer laparoscopically (LS). The LS group was compared with 60 patients from the OS group (selected from the 146 OS group patients), matched by size, sex, age, anatomical location of the tumor, type, extent of resection, and pathological stage. Data were obtained from patients' medical records. Statistical analysis was performed with the t test and chi-square test. All data are expressed as mean +/- standard error of the mean (SEM). Mean age of the LS group was 63.7+/-12 years versus 69+/-12 years in the OS group. There were more men than women in both the laparoscopic (33 males, 24 females) and OS groups (35 men, 25 women). The mean follow-up period was 38 months and 78 months for LS and OS groups, respectively. The procedure included low anterior resection (43 in LS and 45 in OS), and 13 patients in both groups underwent abdominoperineal resection and 3 transanal resections (2 in OS and 1 in LS). Mean tumor size was 4.2+/-2.12cm in the LS versus 5.2+/-2.02cm in the OS group. Conversion to an open procedure occurred in 4 patients (6.7%), all in the first 20 cases. Postoperative complications developed in 28 patients (11.7%), 13 in the LS group and 15 in the OS group. Median operative time was longer, but median blood loss was significantly lower in the LS group. The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter for the LS group. Laparoscopic surgery is feasible and safe for patients with rectal cancer and provides benefits during the postoperative period without increased morbidity or mortality.\n\nLaparoscopic colorectal surgery: Current status and implementation of the latest technological innovations.\n\nPubMed\n\nPascual, Marta; Salvans, Silvia; Pera, Miguel\n\n2016-01-14\n\nThe introduction of laparoscopy is an example of surgical innovation with a rapid implementation in many areas of surgery. A large number of controlled studies and meta-analyses have shown that laparoscopic colorectal surgery is associated with the same benefits than other minimally invasive procedures, including lesser pain, earlier recovery of bowel transit and shorter hospital stay. On the other hand, despite initial concerns about oncological safety, well-designed prospective randomized multicentre trials have demonstrated that oncological outcomes of laparoscopy and open surgery are similar. Although the use of laparoscopy in colorectal surgery has increased in recent years, the percentages of patients treated with surgery using minimally invasive techniques are still reduced and there are also substantial differences among centres. It has been argued that the limiting factor for the use of laparoscopic procedures is the number of surgeons with adequate skills to perform a laparoscopic colectomy rather than the tumour of patients' characteristics. In this regard, future efforts to increase the use of laparoscopic techniques in colorectal surgery will necessarily require more efforts in teaching surgeons. We here present a review of recent controversies of the use of laparoscopy in colorectal surgery, such as in rectal cancer operations, the possibility of reproducing complete mesocolon excision, and the benefits of intra-corporeal anastomosis after right hemicolectomy. We also describe the results of latest innovations such as single incision laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery for colon and rectal diseases.\n\nLaparoscopic colorectal surgery: Current status and implementation of the latest technological innovations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPascual, Marta; Salvans, Silvia; Pera, Miguel\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe introduction of laparoscopy is an example of surgical innovation with a rapid implementation in many areas of surgery.

Brief Review and Personal Remarks\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBianchi, Paolo Pietro; Petz, Wanda; Luca, Fabrizio; Biffi, Roberto; Spinoglio, Giuseppe; Montorsi, Marco\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe current standard treatment for rectal cancer is based on a multimodality approach with preoperative radiochemotherapy in advanced cases and complete surgical removal through total mesorectal excision (TME). The most frequent surgical approach is traditional open surgery, as laparoscopic TME requires high technical skill, a long learning curve, and is not widespread, still being confined to centers with great experience in minimally invasive techniques. Nevertheless, in several studies, the laparoscopic approach, when compared to open surgery, has shown some better short-term clinical outcomes and at least comparable oncologic results. Robotic surgery for the treatment of rectal cancer is an emerging technique, which could overcome some of the technical difficulties posed by standard laparoscopy, but evidence from the literature regarding its oncologic safety and clinical outcomes is still lacking. This brief review analyses the current status of minimally invasive surgery for rectal cancer therapy, focusing on oncologic safety and the new robotic approach.

For colon carcinoma, laparoscopic surgery is proven to result in faster postoperative recovery, fewer complications and better cosmetic results with equal oncologic results. These short-term benefits are expected to be similar for laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery. However, the oncological safety of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer remained controversial due to the lack of definitive long-term results. Thus, the expected short-term benefits can only be of interest when oncological results are at least equal. To evaluate the differences in short- and long-term results after elective laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) for the resection of rectal cancer compared with open total mesorectal excision (OTME). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1990 to February 2013), EMBASE (January 1990 to February 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (February 2013) and Current Controlled Trials (February 2013). We handsearched the reference lists of the included articles for missed studies. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LTME and OTME, reporting at least one of our outcome measures, was considered for inclusion. Two authors independently assessed study quality according to the CONSORT statement, and resolved disagreements by discussion. We rated the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods. We identified 45 references out of 953 search results, of which 14 studies met the inclusion criteria involving 3528 rectal cancer patients. We did not consider the risk of bias of the included studies to have impacted on the quality of the evidence.

METHODS: Eligible Chinese patients with rectal cancer undergoing curative laparoscopic or open sphincter-preserving resection between July 2006 and July 2008 were enrolled in this prospective study. The QoL outcomes were assessed longitudinally using the validated Chinese versions of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR38 questionnaires before surgery and at 4, 8, and 12 mo after surgery. The QoL scores at the different time points were compared between the laparoscopic and open groups. A higher score on a functional scale indicated better functioning, whereas a higher score on a symptom scale indicated a higher degree of symptoms. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients (49 laparoscopic and 25 open) were enrolled. The two groups of patients were comparable in terms of sociodemographic data, types of surgery, tumor staging, and baseline mean QoL scores. There was no significant decrease from baseline in global QoL for the laparoscopic group at different time points, whereas the global QoL was worse compared to baseline beginning at 4 mo but returned to baseline by 12 mo for the open group (P = 0.019, Friedman test). Compared to the open group, the laparoscopic group had significantly better physical (89.9 Â± 1.4 vs 79.2 Â± 3.7, P = 0.016), role (85.0 Â± 3.4 vs 63.3 Â± 6.9, P = 0.005), and cognitive (73.5 Â± 3.4 vs 50.7 Â± 6.2, P = 0.002) functioning at 8 mo, fewer micturition problems at 4-8 mo (4 mo: 32.3 Â± 4.7 vs 54.7 Â± 7.1, P = 0.011; 8 mo: 22.8 Â± 4.0 vs 40.7 Â± 6.9, P = 0.020), and fewer male sexual problems from 8 mo onward (20.0 Â± 8.5 vs 76.7 Â± 14.5, P = 0.013). At 12 mo after surgery, no significant differences were observed in any functional or symptom scale between the two groups, with the exception of male sexual problems, which remained worse in the open group (29.2 Â± 11.3 vs 80.0 Â± 9\n\nObjective assessment of technique in laparoscopic colorectal surgery: what are the existing tools?\n\nPubMed\n\nFoster, J D; Francis, N K\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAssessment can improve the effectiveness of surgical training and enable valid judgments of competence. Laparoscopic colon resection surgery is now taught within surgical residency programs, and assessment tools are increasingly used to stimulate formative feedback and enhance learning. Formal assessment of technical performance in laparoscopic colon resection has been successfully applied at the specialist level in the English \"LAPCO\" National Training Program. Objective assessment tools need to be developed for training and assessment in laparoscopic rectal cancer resection surgery.

Several randomized prospective studies have demonstrated clear advantages for the patient with similar oncological results to those of open surgery, although during the learning of this surgical technique there may be an increase in complications and a worse prognosis. Our aim is to analyze how the learning curve for rectal cancer via laparoscopy influences intra- and postoperative results and oncological markers. A retrospective review was conducted of the first 120 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for rectal neoplasia. The operations were performed by the same surgical team with a wide experience in the treatment of open colorectal cancer and qualified to perform advanced laparoscopic surgery. We analyzed sex, ASA, tumour location, neoadjuvant treatment, surgical technique, operating time, conversion, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, number of lymph nodes, stage and involvement of margins. Significant differences were observed with regard to surgical time (224 min in the first group, 204 min in the second group), with a higher rate of conversion in the first group (22.5%) than in the second (11.3%). No significant differences were noted for rate of conservative sphincter surgery, length of hospital stay, post-surgical complications, number of affected/isolated lymph nodes or affected circumferential and distal margins. It is possible to learn this complex surgical technique without compromising the patient's safety and oncological outcome. Copyright Â© 2013 AEC. Published by Elsevier Espana.

The Contour Curved Stapler (CCS) is a very helpful device because of its curved profile that enables better access into the pelvic cavity and allows rectal closure and section to be performed in one shot. In this paper, we present an original technique to use this device, made for open surgery, in laparoscopy and the results of our experience. We retrospectively evaluated the data of all patients who underwent lower laparoscopic anterior rectal resection and in which the CCS was used to perform section of the rectum between September 2005 and September 2011. To perform section of the rectum a Lapdisc(Â®) was inserted through a 6-7 cm supra-pubic midline incision to allow placement of the CCS into the pelvic cavity. Patients' biographical and surgical data such as sex, age, indication for surgery, infection, anastomotic leakage or stenosis and staple-line bleeding were prospectively collected in a computerised database and evaluated. Between September 2005 and September 2011, we performed 45 laparoscopic lower rectal resection using CCS, 27 male and 18 female with a mean age of 61 years (range 40-82 years) and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 26.5 kg/m(2) (range 16.5-35 kg/m(2)). In 29 cases a temporary ileostomy was performed. Mean operative time was 131 min (range 97-210 min). In all cases it was possible to perform a lower section of the rectum with CCS. No intraoperative or postoperative staple line bleeding occurred. In two patients we observed anastomotic leaks and in one of these a temporary ileostomy was performed. None of the patients showed an anastomotic stenosis at 1-year follow-up colonoscopy. This study shows that CCS enables section of the lower rectum to be easily performed, especially in adverse anatomical condition, and the technique proposed by us\n\nPrimary small intestinal volvulus after laparoscopic rectopexy for rectal prolapse.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoizumi, Michihiro; Yamada, Takeshi; Shinji, Seiichi; Yokoyama, Yasuyuki; Takahashi, Goro; Hotta, Masahiro; Iwai, Takuma; Hara, Keisuke; Takeda, Kohki; Kan, Hayato; Takasaki, Hideaki; Ohta, Keiichiro; Uchida, Eiji\n\n2018-02-01\n\nPrimary small intestinal volvulus is defined as torsion in the absence of congenital malrotation, band, or postoperative adhesions. Its occurrence as an early postoperative complication is rare. A 40-year-old woman presented with rectal prolapse, and laparoscopic rectopexy was uneventfully performed. She could not have food on the day after surgery. She started oral intake on postoperative day 3 but developed abdominal pain after the meal. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed torsion of the small intestinal mesentery. An emergent laparotomy showed small intestinal volvulus, without congenital malformation or intestinal adhesions. We diagnosed it as primary small intestinal volvulus. The strangulated intestine was resected, and reconstruction was performed. The patient recovered uneventfully after the second surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of primary small intestinal volvulus occurring after rectopexy for rectal prolapse. Primary small intestinal volvulus could be a postoperative complication after laparoscopy.

(3) To identify patient, physician, and hospital predictors of conversion. A US-based database study was conducted utilizing the 2012-2014 Premier Healthcare Data, including rectal cancer patients â¥18 with rectal resection. ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedural codes were utilized to identify surgical approaches, conversions to OS, and surgical complications. Propensity score matching on patient, surgeon, and hospital level characteristics was used to create comparable groups of RA\\\\LS patients (nâ=â533 per group). Predictors of conversion from LS and RA to OS were identified with stepwise logistic regression in the unmatched sample. Post-match results suggested comparable perioperative complication rates (RA 29% vs LS 29%; pâ=â.7784); whereas conversion rates to OS were 12% for RA vs 29% for LS (pâ<â.0001). Colorectal surgeons (RA 9% vs LS 23%), general surgeons (RA 13% vs LS 35%), and smaller bed-size hospitals (RA 14% vs LS 33%) have reduced conversion rates for RA vs LS (pâ<â.0001). Statistically significant predictors of conversion included LS, non-colorectal surgeon, and smaller bed-size hospitals. Retrospective observational study limitations apply. Analysis of the hospital administrative database was subject to the data captured in the database and the accuracy of coding. Propensity score matching limitations apply. RA and LS groups were balanced with respect to measured patient, surgeon, and hospital characteristics. Compared to LS, RA offers a higher probability of completing a successful minimally invasive surgery for rectal cancer patients undergoing rectal resection without exacerbating complications. Male, obese, or moderately-to-severely ill patients had higher conversion rates.

We compared outcomes between the robotic and comparable laparoscopic stapler in robotic-assisted colorectal procedures. We conducted a retrospective review of 93 patients who underwent robotic-assisted colorectal surgery at our institution from 2012 to 2014. Surgeries included left, sigmoid, subtotal and total colectomies, and low anterior rectal resections. Indications were malignancy and diverticular and inflammatory bowel disease. Preoperative demographics, intraoperative data, and postoperative outcomes were examined. Student's t-test and Fischer's exact used were appropriate. Forty-five millimeters laparoscopic staplers were used in 58 cases, while the 45âmm robotic stapler was used in 35 cases. There was no difference in age (Pâ=â.651), gender (Pâ=â.832), or body mass index (Pâ=â.204) between groups. There was no difference in estimated blood loss (Pâ=â.524), operative time (Pâ=â.769), length of stay (Pâ=â.895), or complication rate (Pâ=â.778). The robotic stapler group had one anastomotic leak, while the laparoscopic stapler group had six (Pâ=â.705). There were more laparoscopic stapler fires (2.69) per patient than robotic stapler fires (1.86) (Pâ=â.001). The cost per patient for the laparoscopic group was $631.45 versus $473.28 for the robotic group (Pâ=â.001). This is the first study to evaluate the robotic stapler. Advantages of the robotic stapler include large range of motion and 90Â° of articulation, which may provide a benefit when using the stapler in difficult areas like the pelvis. The robotic stapler has a comparable level of safety as a 45âmm laparoscopic stapler and is more cost effective.\n\nRectal tube drainage reduces major anastomotic leakage after minimally invasive rectal cancer surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, C-S; Choi, G-S; Park, J S; Park, S Y; Kim, H J; Choi, J-I; Han, K S\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAnastomotic leakage is the most serious complication following low anterior resection for rectal cancer and is a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality. The object of the present study was to investigate whether rectal tube drainage can reduce anastomotic leakage after minimally invasive rectal cancer surgery. Three hundred and seventy-four patients who underwent laparoscopic or robotic LAR for tumours located â¤Â 15Â cm above the anal verge between 1 April 2012 and 31 October 2014 were assessed retrospectively. Of these, 107 with intermediate risk of anastomotic leakage received transanal rectal tube drainage. The rectal tube group was matched by propensity score analysis with patients not having rectal tube drainage, giving 204 patients in the study. Covariates for propensity score analysis included age, sex, body mass index, tumour height from the anal verge and preoperative chemoradiation. Patient demographics, tumour location, preoperative chemoradiation and operative results were similar between the two groups. The overall leakage rate was 10.8% (22/204), with no significant difference between the rectal tube group (9.8%) and the nonrectal tube group (11.8%, PÂ =Â 0.652). Of the patients with anastomotic leakage, major leakage requiring reoperation developed in 11.8% of those without and 3.9% of those with a rectal tube. On multivariate analysis, age over 65Â years and nonuse of a rectal tube were found to be independent risk factors for major anastomotic leakage. Rectal tube placement may be a safe and effective method of reducing the rate of major anastomotic leakage, alleviating the clinical course of leakage following minimally invasive rectal cancer surgery.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database between 2008 and 2012. We compared the outcomes and costs among rectal cancer patients undergoing robotic, laparoscopic, or open surgeries using propensity scores for adjusted and matched analysis. We identified 194â957 rectal cancer patients. Over the 5-year period, the annual admission number decreased by 13.9%, the in-hospital mortality rate decreased by 32.2%, while the total hospitalization cost increased by 13.6%. Compared with laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery had significantly lower length of stay (LOS) (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.57-0.84), comparable wound complications (OR 1.08, 95%CI 0.70-1.65) and higher cost (OR 1.42, 95%CI 1.13-1.79), while open surgery had significantly longer LOS (OR 1.38, 95%CI 1.19-1.59), more wound complications (OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.08-1.79), and comparable cost (OR 0.92, 95%CI 0.79-1.07). There were no difference in in-hospital mortality among three approaches. Laparoscopic surgery was associated with better outcomes than open surgery. Robotic surgery was associated with higher cost, but no advantage over laparoscopic surgery in terms of mortality and complications. Studies on cost-effectiveness of robotic surgery may be warranted.

The four major issues are the adequacy of oncologic resection, recurrence rates and patterns, long-term survival and quality of life. There is evidence, from nonrandomized studies, suggesting that margins of excision and lymph node harvest achieved laparoscopically reached comparable results to those known from conventional open resection. Our own experience of laparoscopic surgery on rectal cancer is based on 52 patients treated with curative intent. Focusing on the postoperative long-term run, we gained the following results: The median age of patients was 66.7 years and ranged from 42-88. Anastomotic leakage was seen in 6.1% of cases. In a median follow-up of 48 months (36-136), we reached an overall 3-year survival rate of 93% and a 5-year survival rate of 62%. Local recurrence was 1.9%, distant metastasis occurred in 11.5% of cases. We saw no port-site metastasis. To evaluate functional results following laparoscopic surgery a matched pair analysis was carried out. Matching of patients after laparoscopic and conventional open surgery was performed according to sex, age, type of resection, time period of surgery, and stage of disease classified by UICC. Regarding bladder and sexual dysfunction, using the EORTC QLQ CR38 score we found no statistical significant difference between the examined groups. As far as can be seen, laparoscopic surgery in rectal carcinoma may achieve the same or, in selected patients, even better results than open surgery. However, at present no published study has shown much evidence. Many more studies are necessary to define the place of laparoscopic technique in rectal cancer surgery, regarding appropriate selection of patients and evaluating adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment in combination with the laparoscopic approach.\n\nA population-based study comparing laparoscopic and robotic outcomes in colorectal surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nTam, Michael S; Kaoutzanis, Christodoulos; Mullard, Andrew J; Regenbogen, Scott E; Franz, Michael G; Hendren, Samantha; Krapohl, Greta; Vandewarker, James F; Lampman, Richard M; Cleary, Robert K\n\n2016-02-01\n\nCurrent data addressing the role of robotic surgery for the management of colorectal disease are primarily from single-institution and case-matched comparative studies as well as administrative database analyses. The purpose of this study was to compare minimally invasive surgery outcomes using a large regional protocol-driven database devoted to surgical quality, improvement in patient outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. This is a retrospective cohort study from the prospectively collected Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative registry designed to compare outcomes of patients who underwent elective laparoscopic, hand-assisted laparoscopic, and robotic colon and rectal operations between July 1, 2012 and October 7, 2014. We adjusted for differences in baseline covariates between cases with different surgical approaches using propensity score quintiles modeled on patient demographics, general health factors, diagnosis, and preoperative co-morbidities. The primary outcomes were conversion rates and hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes included operative time, and postoperative morbidity and mortality. A total of 2735 minimally invasive colorectal operations met inclusion criteria. Conversion rates were lower with robotic as compared to laparoscopic operations, and this was statistically significant for rectal resections (colon 9.0 vs. 16.9%, p < 0.06; rectum 7.8 vs. 21.2%, p < 0.001). The adjusted length of stay for robotic colon operations (4.00 days, 95% CI 3.63-4.40) was significantly shorter compared to laparoscopic (4.41 days, 95% CI 4.17-4.66; p = 0.04) and hand-assisted laparoscopic cases (4.44 days, 95% CI 4.13-4.78; p = 0.008). There were no significant differences in overall postoperative complications among groups. When compared to conventional laparoscopy, the robotic platform is associated with significantly fewer conversions to open for rectal operations, and significantly shorter length of hospital stay for colon operations, without increasing\n\nLearning curve in robotic rectal cancer surgery: current state of affairs.\n\nPubMed\n\nJimÃ©nez-RodrÃ­guez, Rosa M; Rubio-Dorado-Manzanares, Mercedes; DÃ­az-PavÃ³n, JosÃ© Manuel; Reyes-DÃ­az, M Luisa; Vazquez-Monchul, Jorge Manuel; Garcia-Cabrera, Ana M; Padillo, Javier; De la Portilla, Fernando\n\n2016-12-01\n\nRobotic-assisted rectal cancer surgery offers multiple advantages for surgeons, and it seems to yield the same clinical outcomes as regards the short-time follow-up of patients compared to conventional laparoscopy. This surgical approach emerges as a technique aiming at overcoming the limitations posed by rectal cancer and other surgical fields of difficult access, in order to obtain better outcomes and a shorter learning curve. A systematic review of the literature of robot-assisted rectal surgery was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The search was conducted in October 2015 in PubMed, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, for articles published in the last 10Â years and pertaining the learning curve of robotic surgery for colorectal cancer. It consisted of the following key words: \"rectal cancer/learning curve/robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery\". A total of 34 references were identified, but only 9 full texts specifically addressed the analysis of the learning curve in robot-assisted rectal cancer surgery, 7 were case series and 2 were non-randomised case-comparison series. Eight papers used the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method, and only one author divided the series into two groups to compare both. The mean number of cases for phase I of the learning curve was calculated to be 29.7 patients; phase II corresponds to a mean number 37.4 patients. The mean number of cases required for the surgeon to be classed as an expert in robotic surgery was calculated to be 39 patients. Robotic advantages could have an impact on learning curve for rectal cancer and lower the number of cases that are necessary for rectal resections.\n\nLaparoscopic versus open total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nBreukink, S; Pierie, J; Wiggers, T\n\n2006-10-18\n\nBecause definitive long-term results are not yet available, the oncological safety of laparoscopic surgery for treatment of rectal cancer remains controversial. However, laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) for rectal cancer has been proposed to have several short-term advantages in comparison with open total mesorectal excision (OTME). To evaluate whether there are any relevant differences in safety and efficacy after elective LTME, for the resection of rectal cancer, compared with OTME. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Current Contents from 1990 to December 2005. Searches were conducted using MESH terms: \"laparoscopy\", \"minimally invasive\",\"colorectal neoplasms\". Furthermore we used the following text words: laparoscopy, surgical procedures, minimally invasive, rectal cancer, rectal carcinoma, rectal adenocarcinoma, rectal neoplasms, anterior resection, abdominoperineal resection, total mesorectal excision. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials and case series comparing LTME versus OTME. Furthermore case reports which describe LTME were also included. Two reviewers independently assessed study quality. All relevant studies have been categorized according to the evidence they provide according to the guidelines for \"Levels of Evidence and Grades of Recommendation\" supplied by the \"Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine\". Disagreements were solved by discussion. 80 studies were identified of which 48 studies, representing 4224 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality of most of the included studies was poor; three studies were grade 1b (individual randomised trial), 12 grade 2b (individual cohort study), 5 grade 3b (individual case-control study) and 28 grade 4 (case-series).

Robotic rectal surgery is evolving into an accepted approach. The objective was to analyze and compare laparoscopic and robotic rectal surgery learning curves with respect to operative times and perioperative outcomes for a novice minimally invasive colorectal surgeon. One hundred and six laparoscopic and 92 robotic LAR rectal surgery cases were analyzed. All surgeries were performed by a surgeon who was primarily trained in open rectal surgery. Patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes were analyzed. Operative time and CUSUM plots were used for evaluating the learning curve for laparoscopic versus robotic LAR. Laparoscopic versus robotic LAR outcomes feature initial group operative times of 308 (291-325) min versus 397 (373-420) min and last group times of 220 (212-229) min versus 204 (196-211) min-reversed in favor of robotics; major complications of 4.7 versus 6.5 % (NS), resection margin involvement of 2.8 versus 4.4 % (NS), conversion rate of 3.8 versus 1.1 (NS), lymph node harvest of 16.3 versus 17.2 (NS), and estimated blood loss of 231 versus 201 cc (NS). Due to faster learning curves for extracorporeal phase and total mesorectal excision phase, the robotic surgery was observed to be faster than laparoscopic surgery after the initial 41 cases. CUSUM plots demonstrate acceptable perioperative surgical outcomes from the beginning of the study. Initial robotic operative times improved with practice rapidly and eventually became faster than those for laparoscopy. Developing both laparoscopic and robotic skills simultaneously can provide acceptable perioperative outcomes in rectal surgery. It might be suggested that in the current milieu of clashing interests between evolving technology and economic constrains, there might be advantages in embracing both approaches.\n\nPre-operative rectal indomethacin for reduction of postoperative nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a double-blind randomized clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nPazouki, Abdolreza; Cheraghali, Roozbeh; Saeedimotahhar, Hossein; Jesmi, Fatemeh; Jangjoo, Ali; Pishgahroudsari, Mohadeseh\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the effect of pre-operative indomethacin suppository on postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A double blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. Hazrat Rasoul Akram Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from February 2010 to September 2012. One hundred and thirty patients, scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, were randomly divided into case and control groups. Sixty-five patients received indomethacin suppository and 70 patients received rectal placebo in the case and control groups respectively. All patients underwent the same protocol in laparoscopic surgery and anesthesia, then nausea and vomiting was recorded after 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours postoperatively and compared between the two groups. Independent-sample t test or Mann-Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis. Level of statistical significance was set at P Â² 0.05. Patients' nausea was statistically lower in the case group at the 1st hour (43.1 vs. 92.9%), 6th hour (20.0 vs. 68.6%) and 12th hour (7.7 vs. 24.3%) after surgery (for all periods, P < 0.001). Fewer patients in the case group experienced vomiting at the first (13.8 vs. 51.4%) and 6th hour (0 vs. 20%) after surgery (for both P < 0.001). The use of pethidine was also statistically less in the case group in the same hours after surgery (for all of them, P < 0.001). Rectal indomethacin before laparoscopic cholecystectomy led to lower postoperative nausea and vomiting.\n\nHand-assisted laparoscopic repair of a grade IV rectal tear in a postparturient mare.\n\nPubMed\n\nStewart, Suzanne G; Johnston, Janet K; Parente, Eric J\n\n2014-10-01\n\nAn 8-year-old multiparous Thoroughbred broodmare was admitted for evaluation of a rectal tear sustained during parturition. On initial evaluation, the mare had mild signs of abdominal discomfort. A full-thickness rectal tear located 30 cm cranial to the anus and extending approximately 15 cm longitudinally along the surface of the small colon between the 4 and 6 o'clock positions, when viewed from behind, was diagnosed on examination per rectum. Laparoscopic evaluation of the abdomen was performed to assess the tear and extent of peritoneal contamination. A hand-assisted repair via a flank incision was performed. The tear was closed in a single-layer, simple continuous pattern with size-0 polydioxanone with a handheld needle holder. Subsequently, a ventral midline celiotomy was performed, and intestinal contents were evacuated via a pelvic flexure enterotomy and a typhlotomy. Following surgery, the mare was managed with IV fluid therapy, partial parenteral nutrition, antimicrobials, and NSAIDs for 5 to 7 days before being gradually reintroduced to a complete pelleted feed and alfalfa hay. Prior to discharge, examination per rectum revealed no stricture formation associated with repair. The mare was discharged from the hospital and performed successfully as a broodmare, with the delivery of a live foal 1 year after surgery. Successful repair with an excellent outcome was achieved in this mare. Hand-assisted laparoscopic repair should be considered as a possible treatment option in horses with grade IV rectal tears.\n\nLaparoscopic surgery complications: postoperative peritonitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDrÄghici, L; DrÄghici, I; Ungureanu, A; CopÄescu, C; Popescu, M; Dragomirescu, C\n\n2012-09-15\n\nComplications within laparoscopic surgery, similar to classic surgery are inevitable and require immediate actions both to diminish intraoperative risks and to choose the appropriate therapeutic attitude. Peritonitis and hemorrhagic incidents are both part of the complications aspect of laparoscopic surgery. Fortunately, the incidence is limited, thus excluding the rejection of celioscopic methods. Patient's risks and benefits are to be analyzed carefully prior recommending laparoscopic surgery. This study presents a statistical analysis of peritonitis consecutive to laparoscopic surgery, experience of \"Sf. Ioan\" Emergency Hospital, Bucharest, and Department of Surgery (2000-2010). There were 180 (0,96%) complicated situations requiring reinterventions, from a total of 18676 laparoscopic procedures. 106 cases (0,56%) represented different grades of postoperative peritonitis. Most frequently, there were consecutive laparoscopic appendicectomia and colecistectomia. During the last decade, few severe cases of peritonitis followed laparoscopic bariatric surgical procedures. This study reflects the possibility of unfavorable evolution of postoperative peritonitis comparing with hemorrhagic incidents within laparoscopic surgery.\n\nTrephine Transverse Colostomy Is Effective for Patients Who Have Previously Undergone Rectal Surgery\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYeom, Seung-Seop; Jung, Sung Woo; Oh, Se Heon; Lee, Jong Lyul; Yoon, Yong Sik; Park, In Ja; Lim, Seok-Byung; Yu, Chang Sik; Kim, Jin Cheon\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPurpose Colostomy creation is an essential procedure for colorectal surgeons, but the preferred method of colostomy varies by surgeon. We compared the outcomes of trephine colostomy creation with open those for the (laparotomy) and laparoscopic methods and evaluated appropriate indications for a trephine colostomy and the advantages of the technique. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 263 patients who had undergone colostomy creation by trephine, open and laparoscopic approaches between April 2006 and March 2016. We compared the clinical features and the operative and postoperative outcomes according to the approach used for stoma creation. Results One hundred sixty-three patients (62%) underwent colostomy surgery for obstructive causes and 100 (38%) for fistulous problems. The mean operative time was significantly shorter with the trephine approach (trephine, 46.0 Â± 1.9 minutes; open, 78.7 Â± 3.9 minutes; laparoscopic, 63.5 Â± 5.0 minutes; P < 0.001), as was the time to flatus (1.8 Â± 0.1 days, 2.1 Â± 0.1 days, 2.2 Â± 0.3 days, P = 0.025). Postoperative complications (<30 days) were not different among the 3 approaches (trephine, 4.3%; open, 1.2%; laparoscopic, 0%; P = 0.828). In patients who underwent rectal surgery, a trephine colostomy was feasible for a diversion colostomy (P < 0.001). Conclusion The trephine colostomy is safe and can be implemented quickly in various situations, and compared to other colostomy procedures, the patientâs recovery is faster. Previous laparotomy history was not a contraindication for a trephine colostomy, and a trephine transverse colostomy is feasible for patients who have undergone previous rectal surgery.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with SRUS who underwent laparoscopic ventral rectopexy (LVR). A review was performed of a prospective database at the Oxford Pelvic Floor Centre to identify patients between 2004 and 2012 with a histological diagnosis of SRUS. All were initially treated conservatively and surgical treatment was indicated only for patients with significant symptoms after failed conservative management. The primary end-point was healing of the ulcer. Secondary end-points included changes in the Wexner Constipation Score and Faecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI). Thirty-six patients with SRUS were identified (31 women), with a median age of 44 (15â81) years. The commonest symptoms were rectal bleeding (75%) and obstructed defaecation (64%). The underlying anatomical diagnosis was internal rectal prolapse (n = 20), external rectal prolapse (n = 14) or anismus (n = 2). Twenty-nine patients underwent LVR and one a stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR) procedure. Nine (30%) required a fu"
