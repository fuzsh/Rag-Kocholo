Minimally invasive (MIS) approaches (e.g., laparoscopic or robotic) to component separation may lead to decreased morbidity. Despite increased utilization of component separation over time and the uptake of MIS approaches, it remains unclear how hernia size and operative approach influence a surgeon’s choice to perform component separation at the time of hernia repair. Moreover, the lack of granular clinical data have prevented exploration into appropriate utilization of component separation by surgeons. Our study sought characterize hernia size and operative approach for patients undergoing abdominal wall component separation.\n\nMethods: We performed a retrospective cohort study from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2022 using data from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative Hernia Registry (MSQC-HR), a state-wide, population-level registry that captures nuanced hernia and operation-specific details. We included patients undergoing anterior or posterior abdominal component separation (CPT code 15734) for ventral hernia. We specifically excluded patients only undergoing subcutaneous flaps or diastasis recti repairs. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the distribution of surgical approach (open vs. MIS) and hernia size (diameter or width in cm) for all patients in the sample. Mann–Whitney U tests were used to compare nonparametric variables.\n\nResults: Of the 554 total component separations in our sample, 380 (69%) were performed open and 174 (31%) were done via MIS approach. Hernia size was available for 398 (72%) of patients. Median hernia size was not different between open and MIS cohorts (7.5 vs. 7.0 cm, p = 0.54). Notably, 168 (40%) of all component separations were performed for hernias < 6 cm in size, while 29 (7%) of component separations were for hernias measuring less than 2 cm. The rate of MIS repair was no different for smaller (< 6 cm) versus larger (6 + cm) hernias (35.0% vs. 34.4%, p = 0.91).\n\nConclusion: Rates of open and MIS component separation were similar for smaller versus larger hernias. A large proportion (over 40%) of component separations are being performed on hernias < 6 cm in size, raising the possibility of overutilization of this technique. Further exploration will explore long-term clinical outcomes for these patients.\n\nP002\n\nInguino-scrotal Hernia of the Urinary Bladder\n\nNajiha Farooqi1; Rikat Baroody, MD2; Akram Alashari2; Shravani Sripathi2; Mohammad K Hussain2; Timothy Knittle2; 1Centra Michigan University; 2Central Michigan University\n\nIntroduction: Inguino-scrotal hernia of the bladder is a rare condition that may present as scrotal swelling. It is easier to plan for the repair and avoid inadvertent injury to the bladder if preoperative diagnosis is made. In addition, unanticipated intraoperative discovery can pose a challenge to the surgeon\n\nCase Presentation: We report a case of an 81-year-old male who presented to emergency department with incarcerated right inguinal hernia with small bowel contents. During his surgery, he was found to have the urinary bladder adhered to the hernia sac. The hernia sac and the urinary bladder were reduced without any complications. The patient underwent a Lichtenstein tension-free hernia repair.\n\nConclusion: Inguino scrotal hernia containing bowel contents is not uncommon; however, the presence of the urinary bladder is rare. It should be anticipated intraoperatively, particularly in patients with long-standing hernias. Management is surgical and Lichtenstein repair is a viable option with low rates of recurrence.\n\nP003\n\nContinuous intraabdominal pressure monitoring during laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy: a prospective clinical trial\n\nChristopher Prien, MD, MS1; Alexa Griffiths, MD1; Alexander Gonzalez-Jacobo, DO1; Danny Sherwinter, MD2; 1Maimonides Medical Center; 2Mount Sinai Medical Center\n\nIntroduction: Elevated intraabdominal pressure (IAP) likely plays a significant role in the development of inguinal hernia (IH) recurrence. To avoid subjecting a new repair to increased IAP, surgeons frequently recommend avoidance of heavy lifting in the perioperative period yet ignore the potential impact of increased intraoperative IAP. To date, the extent and magnitude of intraoperative IAP peaks have been inadequately characterized. This is partly due to the labor-intensive nature and poor reproducibility of standard IAP data collection. Using innovative technology capable of continuous IAP monitoring, we aimed to characterize intraoperative IAP more precisely.\n\nMethods and Procedures: We performed an IRB approved, prospective clinical trial observing patients undergoing elective laparoscopic IH repair. Intraoperative IAP was monitored using the Accuryn Monitoring System (AMS), which utilizes a novel bladder catheter system to dynamically measure IAP and urine output continuously in real time. Data were analyzed using JASP statistical software and subjected to a descriptive analysis. Data are presented as frequency (proportion) and median [range].\n\nResults: Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the study (86% male, median BMI 23.8 kg/m2, median age 57.5 years). The indications for surgery consisted of 15 (68%) bilateral IH and 7 (32%) unilateral IH, including 5 (23%) recurrent. All patients underwent laparoscopic repair (21 TEP, 1 TAPP) with a surgical duration of 73.0 [50.0–93.0] minutes and insufflation duration of 50.5 [17.0–71.0] minutes. Baseline IAP was 7.30 [1.95–11.6] mmHg. The peak IAP during extubation was 28.4 [3.14–52.6] mmHg (mean: 28.127 ± 13.3 mmHg), which was an increase from baseline IAP by 21.1 mmHg.\n\nConclusion: Using the AMS, we captured extensive, highly granular, IAP levels. This data was readily available in real time throughout the procedure and during extubation. Notably, the mean peri-extubation peak IAP exceeded that of even extreme strenuous activity as reported in the literature. By providing real-time IAP feedback, this system may help surgeons and anesthesiologists better manage intraoperative and peri-extubation IAP.\n\nP004\n\n“Sandwich” Approach to Complex Flank Hernia Repair: A Case Series of 8 patients\n\nJason Aubrey, MD1; Aryana Sharrak, MD1; Anne Opalikhin, BS2; Amy Banks-Venegoni, MD3; 1Department of General Surgery, Spectrum Health/Michigan State University; 2Michigan State University College of Human Medicine; 3Department of General Surgery, Spectrum Health Blodgett Hospital\n\nObjective: Flank hernias are rare and challenging to repair given their unique anatomic locations. There are limited prospective studies describing repair techniques. Obtaining overlap of mesh during repair is difficult due to the lack of strong fascial layers laterally. Open repair of flank and lumbar hernias can have complication rates of up to 40% and recurrence rates of 0–15.9%. Laparoscopic repair improves complications and recurrence (0–37% and 0–2.9%, respectively) with variable outcomes.\n\nOur case series describes a novel technique of open onlay combined with a robotic underlay mesh. The study provides a technical description of a two-layered mesh resulting in a “sandwich” and assess surgical outcomes for a new surgical approach for flank hernias.\n\nMethods: Our study is a retrospective chart review for repair of complex flank hernias with open onlay and robotic underlay by a single surgeon from November 2017 to September 2022. IRB approval was obtained through Spectrum Health.\n\nResults: The cohort contained eight patients that included six males (75%) and two females (25%) with a mean age at repair of 64 years old (R: 42–88) and mean BMI was 29.7 (R: 23.4–36.1, SD: 4.2). Seven hernias (87.5%) were the result of prior surgeries, three AAA repairs, three nephrectomies, and one spinal surgery. One hernia (12.5%) was the result of a motor vehicle collision. Five (62.5%) were reducible. Mean hernia defect width was 8.6 cm (R: 4–15, SD: 3.93). Mean hernia defect length was 5.9 cm (R: 3–10, SD: 2.1). Mean operative time was 248 min (R: 169–428, SD 87.0). Mean length of stay was 1.75 days (R: 0–5, SD: 1.83). Five (62.5%) patients were able to be discharged without narcotics. One (12.5%) patient developed a hematoma and one (12.5%) a seroma; both managed conservatively and without clinical sequela. One patient required re-admission in the 30-day post-operative period for pain control. There have been zero hernia recurrences confirmed by CT scan at a mean follow-up of 20.75 months (R: 1–56, SD: 19.2).\n\nConclusion: This study outlines a novel approach to complex flank hernia repair with an open onlay and robotic underlay mesh placement for a “sandwich” technique. With minimal postoperative complications and no recurrences, the sandwich technique might be the better approach to a more durable flank hernia repair. Further prospective trials need to be performed to elucidate a gold standard technique.\n\nP005\n\nInitial experience with enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) and early discharge protocols after robotic extended totally extraperitoneal (eTEP) hernia surgery\n\nYao Z Liu, MD; Andrew Luhrs, MD; Marcoandrea Giorgi, MD; Brown University Department of Surgery\n\nIntroduction: This study evaluates safety, feasibility, and early outcomes of ERAS protocols and same-day discharges for robotic eTEP hernia repairs. With the advent of robotic eTEP surgery, large ventral hernias that previously required extensive open repair have now entered the domain of minimally invasive surgery. The growth of robotic surgery coincides with pressure to preserve patient outcomes while reducing surgical cost and hospital length of stay. We present our initial experience applying ERAS and same-day discharge protocols after robotic eTEP surgery for large ventral hernias.\n\nMethods: A retrospective chart review was performed for all robotic eTEP hernia surgeries at our institution between November 2019 and December 2021. Analysis included patient demographics, hernia characteristics, intraoperative data, post-operative admissions, and complications at 30 post-operative days. ERAS protocol included judicious use of urinary catheters with removal at end of case, bilateral transversus abdominus plane (TAP) blocks, post-operative abdominal wall binder, and opioid-sparing perioperative analgesia. Patients were discharged same day from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) if they lacked comorbidities requiring observation post-anesthesia and demonstrated stable vital signs, adequate pain control, ability to void, and ability to ambulate. Hospital length of stay (LOS) was considered 0 for same-day PACU discharges or hospitalizations < 24 h.\n\nResults: 59 patients were included in this initial cohort. Average age was 54 years, 41% were females, 66% had public insurance (Medicaid, Medicare, or both), and average BMI was 32. Average hernia defect size was 39 cm2, with average mesh size of 460 cm2; 11 (19%) patients required transversus abdominis release (TAR). 39 (68%) patients were discharged same day from PACU; 14 (24%) patients were discharged on post-operative day 1 but were admitted for greater than 24 h. The average hospital LOS was 0.46 days. Within 30 post-operative days, the aggregate (major and minor) complication rate was 8.5%. Observed minor complications (3) included one superficial surgical site infection, one port site wound dehiscence, and one hematoma. Major complications (1) consisted of one posterior sheath breakdown and bowel obstruction requiring reoperation.\n\nConclusion: Our initial experience with ERAS protocols and same-day discharges after robotic eTEP repair demonstrates this approach is safe and feasible with acceptable short-term patient outcomes. Compared to traditional open surgery for large ventral hernias, robotic eTEP may enable significant reductions in hospital LOS as adoption increases. As follow-up continues for this initial cohort, we aim to demonstrate longer-term hernia repair efficacy while further reducing post-operative LOS.\n\nP006\n\nNovel Single-Port Robotic Platform for Bilateral Inguinal Hernia Repair\n\nEduardo Parra-Davila, MD1; Michael A Conditt2; Hamed Yaghini3; Chris Lightcap3; Matthew McKittrick2; 1Palm Beach Health Network; 2Momentis Surgical; 3KCL Consulting\n\nPurpose: Every year ~ 20 million inguinal hernia repairs are completed worldwide. The increased demand for less invasive techniques driven by better clinical and aesthetic outcomes has expanded interest in a single-port approach. The main technical issues with current single-port surgeries are the loss of instrument triangulation and the collision of instruments. A robotics platform with a novel approach to articulation and reach may obviate these issues.\n\nMaterials and Methods: A robotics platform has been developed that allows all instrument articulation to occur inside the abdomen by 2 flexible instrument arms inserted through a single incision that can be made transabdominally for male patients and transvaginally for female patients. The biomimetic instruments are designed to replicate the motions and capabilities of a surgeon’s arms, with shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints. Both inguinal canals can be reached from a single-entry point, either transabdominally or in the preperitoneal space. This study measured the manipulability of this new robotic platform throughout its entire reachable workspace in the abdomen through either a transvaginal, umbilical, or pfannenstiel single-port insertion site by first generating a set of 200,000 configurations of the robotic arms and secondly calculating the manipulability index according to robotics literature.\n\nResults: The results show that, due to the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints of the arms that perform all of their articulation after entry, the reachable workspace encompasses the entirety of the average male and female abdomen. Because the wrist joints have unlimited rotation and the shoulder and elbow joints allow the arms to function as they cross over each other, the manipulability index remains high (high usability) with all three single-port insertion sites within the abdominal cavity and particularly the deep inguinal ring, external oblique fascia, ilioinguinal nerve, spermatic cord and the pubic tubercle, allowing traction, countertraction, fine dissection, and triangulation in a large as well as a constrained workspace.\n\nConclusion: The design of this new robotic technology has the potential to realize the clinical benefits of a single-port approach while providing unprecedented triangulation and manipulability for either unilateral or bilateral inguinal hernia repair via a transabdominal or extraperitoneal approach. In addition, while traditional multiport robotics remains expensive and time consuming related to setup2, this new novel single-port robotic technology has the ability to drive costs to be more in line with traditional laparoscopic approaches.\n\nP007\n\nLaparoscopic versus Robotic Inguinal Hernia Repair: A Decade’s Experience\n\nOmar Y Kudsi, MD, MBA, FACS1; Georges Kaoukabani, MD, MSc1; Naseem Bou-Ayash, MD2; Fahri Gokcal, MD1; 1Good Samaritan Medical Center; 2Tufts Medical Center\n\nObjective: To compare outcomes and costs between laparoscopic and robotic inguinal hernia repairs (LIHR, RIHR)\n\nMethods: Elective LIHR or RIHR from 2012 to 2022 were reviewed. Patients’ demographics, operative details, postoperative outcomes, and financial burden (hospital, post-discharge, total costs) were compared using univariate statistical tests. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine associations between preoperative variables and increased costs.\n\nResults: 588 LIHR and 644 RIHR were included. Patient demographics did not differ except for the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). Bilateral hernias rate was comparable (p = 0.132; RIHR: 34.2% vs. LIHR:28.9%). Rate of complex hernia (inguinal hernias previously repaired with posterior approach, history of open prostatectomy, incarcerated hernias, scrotal hernias) was higher in RIHR (p < 0.001; 29% vs. LIHR: 12%). Median operating time was ~ 20 min longer in RIHR (p < 0.001). Intraoperative complications rates were comparable (p = 0.99). Rates of peritoneal breach during preperitoneal dissection and of conversion were higher in LIHR than in RIHR. Length of hospital stay did not differ (p = 0.097). Clavien–Dindo Grade IIIB complication rate and mean Comprehensive Complication Index were higher in LIHR than RIHR (3.4% vs. 1.4% and 2.6 vs. 1.7, respectively, p = 0.024). Sixteen ( 3%) patients experienced a hernia recurrence in LIHR versus 4 (0.7%) in RIHR (p = 0.003). Mean hospital cost was significantly $896 (p < 0.001) higher in RIHR. Mean post-discharge cost was $155 (p = 0.03) lower in RIHR. Mean (95%-Confidence Interval) total cost was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in RIHR [5869(5607–6130) vs. 5128(4875–5381)]. The robotic approach, higher ASA scores, prior posterior IHR, previous prostatectomy, and bilateral inguinal hernia were independently associated with each cost component (table).\n\nConclusion: RIHR provided lower recurrence and complication rates in more complex hernias at a higher total cost. Hernia complexity, ASA class, choice of approach, and bilaterality may contribute to the higher financial burden of IHR.\n\nHospital cost estimatep-valuePost-discharge cost estimatep-valueTotal cost estimatep-valueRobotic(vs. open)600.20.0001− 154.090.024445.570.0126ASA-2(vs.ASA-1)170.400.47108.610.2984274.770.31ASA-3635.180.014213.360.060845.10.004ASA-46485.61 < 0.00014668.38 < 0.000111,165.94 < 0.0001Previous posterior Repair1222.1030.0011319.250.0026Previous prostatectomy1263.510.011327.570.0183Incarcerated hernia2135.52 < 0.00012085.80 < 0.0001Bilateral hernias1045.36 < 0.00011080.80 < 0.0001\n\nP009\n\nA Single-Center Retrospective Review of Laparoscopic Totally Extraperitoneal (L-TEP) vs Robotic Transabdominal Preperitoneal (R-TAPP) Repair of Inguinal Hernia Repair\n\nBryana N Baginski, MD1; Daniel Tran2; Manoj Ravichandran2; Gerald Ogola, PhD1; David Arnold, MD, FACS1; 1Baylor University Medical Center; 2Texas A&M College of Medicine\n\nIntroduction: Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been shown to have advantages over open repair, including improved quality of life, shorter hospital length of stay, reduced postoperative pain, and morbidity. One method for laparoscopic repair is the totally extraperitoneal repair (L-TEP), which has the advantage of not entering the peritoneal cavity but, however, has greater technical difficulty. With advancements and increased experience in robotic surgery, robotic transabdominal preperitoneal repair (R-TAPP) has become a commonly used approach for robotic inguinal hernia repair. Robotic surgery has demonstrated superiority over laparoscopy in many surgical settings; however, there is limited evidence comparing L-TEP and R-TAPP. Several studies have demonstrated equivocal early and late postoperative complications, although R-TAPP may have decreased peri-operative pain. With equivocal findings in early and late postoperative complications, the use of one method over the other is still debated.\n\nMethods: We performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent L-TEP and R-TAPP at Baylor University Medical Center between December 2011 and January 2022. The type of hernia repair represented a practice change over the course of the study with increased robotic use in recent years. Patient demographics, comorbidities, type of hernia repair, postoperative complications (hernia recurrence, pain, surgical site occurrence or infection) hospital length of stay, and postoperative complication requiring procedure (e.g., repair of hernia recurrence, drainage of abscess or seroma, hematoma evacuation) were collected. All the statistical analyses were conducted with R version 4.0.3 statistical software. All statistical tests were two-sided with a statistical significance level set at p values < 0.05.\n\nResults: A total of 298 patients were analyzed. 245 patients underwent R-TAPP and 53 patients underwent L-TEP between December 2011 and January 2022. 303 patients underwent bilateral repair and 46 patients underwent concomitant ventral hernia repair. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics and comorbidities between the two groups. Significant differences were observed in complications for recurrence where L-TEP group had higher rates than R-TAPP group. Complications for pain were also higher in the L-TEP group as compared to R-TAPP group and approached borderline significance (p = 0.06).\n\nConclusion: Although there has been a transition from L-TEP to R-TAPP over recent years, there remains limited evidence supporting this change in practice. Our single-center retrospective review demonstrates that R-TAPP has significantly decreased postoperative pain and hernia recurrence.\n\nP010\n\nThe Incidence and Approaches to Inguinal Hernia Repair in Patients with Ascites\n\nDevon E Cassidy1; Zhihong Shao, MS1; Ryan Howard, MD1; Michael J Englesbe, MD2; Justin Dimick, MD, MPH3; Dana Telem, MD, MPH3; Anne Ehlers, MD, MPH3; 1University of Michigan; 2University of Michigan Department of Transplantation Surgery; 3University of Michigan Department of Minimally Invasive Surgery\n\nIntroduction: Inguinal hernia repairs among patients with ascites are rare events. The limited available data from case series or single-center studies suggest a high risk of associated morbidity associated with this operation, but outcomes more broadly are unexplored at a population level. Within this context, we conducted a population-based study among patients with ascites undergoing inguinal hernia repair to characterize surgical approach and outcomes.\n\nMethods: A retrospective analysis of adult patients with ascites undergoing inguinal hernia repair between January 1, 2020 and May 3, 2022. We used data from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) which is a state-wide, payer-funded quality improvement program in Michigan aimed at improving patient care among patients undergoing surgery. Ascites was documented as the presence of fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity based upon physical examination, abdominal ultrasound, or abdominal CT/MRI within 30 days prior to or during the principal operation; ascites documented as minimal, trace, or small amount was excluded. The primary outcome in this study was surgical approach (minimally invasive vs open). Secondary outcomes included surgical priority (elective vs emergent/urgent) and 30-day adverse clinical outcomes (emergency department visit, readmission, re-operation, and surgical complications).\n\nResults: Among 35,207 patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair in MSQC, there were 88 patients with documented ascites. Among these patients, the mean age (SD) was 64 (± 12.13) years and 93% (N = 82) were male. The majority (n = 68, 77.3%) of patients underwent open surgical repair vs minimally invasive. Elective surgery was most common (71.6%, n = 63), while 28% underwent emergent/urgent repair (n = 25). Overall 30% (n = 27) of patients experienced at least one adverse outcome. Comparing minimally invasive to open approaches, minimally invasive approaches were associated with a lower rate of 30-day adverse clinical outcomes (16.7% vs 35.3%).\n\nConclusion: Inguinal hernia repairs in patients with ascites are extremely uncommon but highly morbid. Using this large series of patients we uncovered that there is not a uniform surgical approach and the overall risk of complications in this population was nearly 30 times the average for an inguinal hernia repair. Additionally, we found a relatively high proportion of patients undergoing minimally invasive repair which may represent a potentially dangerous practice. However, when patient selection is appropriate it appears minimally invasive approaches are safe and may decrease perioperative adverse outcomes. Future studies should examine the impact of minimally invasive techniques on inguinal hernia recurrence and adverse outcomes within this population.\n\nP011\n\nFirst 100 Robotic ETEP’s: initial experience and learning curve at a single institution\n\nAmanda Stastny, MD1; Ruth N Reed, MD1; Katie Korneffel, MD1; Wendy Nuzzo1; Katherine H Yancey, MD2; Lindsee McPhail, MD, MPH2; Sean O'Connor, MD2; Selina Fritze1; 1MAHEC; 2HCA Healthcare\n\nObjective: The objective was to analyze the first 100 robot-assisted eTEP (extended totally extraperitoneal) hernia repairs at Mission Hospital. We sought to determine significant differences in operating room time and length of stay based on whether or not the surgeon was fellowship trained in the procedure and/or if a TAR (transversus abdominis release) was included.\n\nStudy Design: Retrospective case series\n\nSetting: The setting was Mission Memorial Hospital within a group of general surgeons. All 3 surgeons included are fellowship trained in minimally invasive surgery. One learned the robot-assisted eTEP hernia repair technique during fellowship and two learned in practice.\n\nPopulation Studied: The first 100 patients who underwent a robot-assisted eTEP at Mission Hospital were studied. There were 100 total subjects, of which 5 also underwent an additional procedure. These concomitant procedures were not included in the analysis to determine significant differences in outcomes, but were included in the total series.\n\nIntervention/Instrument: The first 100 eTEPs completed at this hospital were analyzed. The main goal of data analysis was to compare outcomes in cases of fellowship-trained surgeons versus those trained in practice.\n\nOutcome Measures: The primary outcome was operating at room time. The secondary outcome was hospital length of stay.\n\nResults: Seventy seven percent of patients underwent eTEP alone, 11% underwent unilateral TAR with eTEP, and 12% underwent bilateral TAR with eTEP. Five cases underwent concomitant operations, including two robotic cholecystectomies, one inguinal hernia repair, and two parastomal hernia repairs (keyhole and Sugarbaker techniques). The overall average OR time was 3.3 h (2.3 for fellowship-trained versus 3.7 for not). Average hospital length of stay was 0 days with 71.6% of patients discharging on POD0. The wound complication rate was 3.8% and included one SSI, one hematoma, and two symptomatic seromas requiring drainage. There was one recurrence within one year, one conversion to an open procedure, and four readmissions (3.8%). Other complications included COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and UTI. There was no significant difference between patient demographics, including BMI, ASA, age, estimated blood loss, or performance of TAR.\n\nConclusion: Mean OR time was significantly shorter for the fellowship-trained surgeon. This continued to be statistically significant when adjusted for BMI and whether or not a TAR was completed. Hospital stay was not significantly different between the two groups.\n\nLimitations: The number of surgeons performing the procedure and the number of cases will continue to increase with time and could be analyzed at that time.\n\nP012\n\nAssociation of Mesh Fixation Method on Postoperative Pain in Abdominal Wall Hernia Repairs\n\nSerena S Bidwell1; Ryan A Howard, MD2; Brian T Fry, MD2; Alex K Hallway2; Sean M O'Neill, MD, PhD2; Michael Rubyan, PhD, MPH3; Dana A Telem, MD, MPH2; Anne P Ehler, MD, MPH2; 1University of Michigan, Medical School; 2University of Michigan, Department of Surgery; 3University of Michigan, Department of Economics\n\nIntroduction: The association of mesh fixation and pain following abdominal wall hernia repairs remains highly controversial. With such wide variety in surgical approach, a goal of mitigating postoperative pain is often used to justify intraoperative decisions. However, despite hernia repairs being extremely common, there is little evidence to indicate how various surgical techniques and intraoperative factors contribute to postoperative pain and opioid use. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association of mesh fixation method with prolonged opioid use and return to normal daily function.\n\nMethods: We used data from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative—Core Optimization Hernia Registry, a payer-funded quality improvement program that captures nuanced perioperative and intraoperative elements from 70 hospitals across the state of Michigan. We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent elective abdominal wall hernia repair from 2020 to 2022. The primary independent variable was mesh fixation method. The primary outcomes were opioid prescription at discharge and return to normal function and continued opioid use within 90 days of surgery. Descriptive statistics and univariate analyses were used to identify associations between mesh fixation method and the outcome variables of interest.\n\nResults: Among the 6300 total elective abdominal hernia repairs in our cohort, the majority had suture for mesh fixation (82.2%), followed by tacks (10.3%) and adhesive (7.4%). There were no differences in mesh fixation method by patient sex, age, or comorbidities. Open hernia repairs were associated with higher use of suture (63%, adhesive: 25%, tacks: 13%), and laparoscopic repair used tacks most frequently (78%, suture: 5%, adhesive: 42%) (p-value < 0.001). There were significant differences in opioid prescriptions at discharge by mesh fixation type (95% adhesive, 90% with tacks, 82% suture, p < 0.001). Among patients who completed the follow-up survey within 90 days (n = 447), there were significant differences in the proportion of patients still taking their opioids (4.6% adhesive, 0% tacks, 3% suture, p = 0.015), but no differences in return to normal daily activities (65% adhesive, 54% tacks, 58% suture, p = 0.763).\n\nConclusion: Overall, there is wide variation in mesh fixation method by surgical approach. In the acute postoperative period, most patients received an opioid prescription. However, at 90-day follow-up, those with adhesive fixation were most likely to continue an opioid prescription. Further research is needed to elucidate how mesh characteristics and other intraoperative modifiable factors contribute to postoperative pain and recovery in hernia patients, as these may be areas of intervention to improve outcomes.\n\nP013\n\nLaparoscopic management for complicated urachal remnants in our hospital\n\nNorimasa Koide; Ayato Obana; Kenji Iwasaki; Kenta Kitamura; Tomonori Matsumura; Shinsuke Usui; Yoshinobu Sato; Motoi Koyama; Kazuhiro Karikomi; Hiroyuki Nomori; Tatsushi Suwa; Kashiwa Kousei General Hospital\n\nIntroduction: The traditional surgical approach for removing an urachal remnant is via a large transverse or midline infraumbilical incision. In recent years, laparoscopic surgery (LS) has been performed by many surgeons and urologists to treat urachal remnants. In February 2020, we started LS for urachal remnants in our hospital. This study aimed to review our experience in LS for urachal remnants and report the efficacy and outcomes of this procedure.\n\nMethods: Five cases of LS for urachal remnants performed from February 2020 to December 2021 were retrospectively reviewed.\n\nSurgery: At our hospital, we performed a 3-port multiport method on the right side of the abdomen. Saline was injected into the bladder, the top of the bladder was confirmed, and the urachal remnant was removed together with the left and right medial umbilical folds. The bladder was not opened, and the umbilicus was preserved. No peritoneal suture was performed.\n\nResults: Mean age was 29 years (23–35 years) and included 4 men. All patients underwent incisional drainage and administration of antibiotics before surgery. Average waiting time for surgery was 4.2 months (3–5 months). The average operation time was 99.8 min (91–117 min), and the amount of bleeding was small in all cases. The average postoperative hospital stay was 1.8 days (1–3 days), and no postoperative complications were observed. Postoperative pathological examination revealed an epithelium in one case and no malignant findings in any case.\n\nSummary: Five cases of LS for urachal remnants performed at our hospital were reported. It was safely introduced without serious postoperative complications.\n\nP014\n\nNovel endo-laparoscopic surgical techniques to minimise morbidity (pain, seroma formation) and recurrence in large groin hernias.\n\nMehak Mahipal, MD; Sujith Wijerathne, Aprof; Davide Lomanto, Prof; National University Hospital, Singapore.\n\nIntroduction and Background: One of the most commonly performed surgeries in the world, groin hernia repair, has evolved dramatically from the days of primary suture repairs and the subsequent revolutionary “tension-free” anterior approach. In recent times, the endo-laparoscopic approach to the repair of groin hernias as proposed within the international guidelines has been extensively adopted worldwide owing to faster recovery times and lower risk of chronic pain.\n\nHowever, the endo-laparoscopic approach to large groin hernias, with its inherent risks of seroma formation and recurrence, is still an evolving paradigm. In this talk, we propose our centre’s tailored MIS approach for adult large groin (reducible and non-reducible inguinal, inguino-scrotal and femoral) hernia surgery using our published novel techniques: TEP/TAPP + (for large direct hernias) and mTEP (for large indirect hernias) in combination with NATURE (intraoperative analgesic control).\n\nMethods: Stemming from the concept of combining TAP and TEP, in conjunction with modification of the novel eTEP procedure and use of local anaesthetic infiltration, are our following three novel techniques in use:\n\nTEP/TAPP +: direct hernia defect closure with incorporation of transversalis fasciam TEP: division of arcuate line and posterior sheath beyond ASIS to incorporate larger mesh NATURE (Nerves And Transversalis-fascia Using RopivacainE): infiltration of local anaesthesia at specific anatomical locations during endo-laparoscopic hernia surgery\n\nResults: TEP/TAPP +: Compared to the group that did not undergo direct defect closure, the group that had closure of the direct defects demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in recurrence (4.4% versus 0.9%, p = 0.036) and seroma formation (12.6% versus 6.4%, p = 0.045). mTEP: 14 large inguinoscrotal hernia and 4 large femoral hernia were repaired using the modified-TEP technique in 15 patients. These patients reported minimal pain after surgery. There were no reported seroma, complications or recurrences up to 9-month follow-up period.\n\nNATURE: The intervention group reported lower pain levels immediately after surgery (1.4 ± 1.7 versus 2.4 ± 1.9, p < 0.01) and at 4-h post-surgery (0.9 ± 1.1 versus 1.4 ± 1.2, p = 0.02). They also had lower levels of post-operative complications (4% versus 21.3%, p = 0.03).\n\nConclusion: Our tailored approach utilizing our novel endo-laparoscopic techniques (TEP +, mTEP, NATURE) minimizes morbidity (pain, seroma formation) and recurrence associated with repair of large groin hernias (inguinal, inguino-scrotal and femoral).\n\nP015\n\nRecurrent incisional hernia repair with biologic mesh complicated by delayed urinary leak\n\nM. Carolina Jimenez, MD; Robert F. Cubas, MD; Jose M. Martinez, MD; University of Miami/Jackson Health System\n\nIntroduction: Biologic mesh has been used in clean-contaminated and contaminated fields and while wound infection rates may be high, infection is usually superficial and graft removal is unusual. Biologic mesh has been reported to have higher recurrence rates and poor incorporation into native tissue in comparison to synthetic mesh. Currently, there is no consensus on mesh preservation treatment in cases of mesh infection after hernia repair.\n\nMethods: We present a 72-year-old male with prior radical cystectomy and neobladder creation complicated at the time by neobladder-cutaneous fistula and wound infection requiring revisional surgery and incisional hernia repair with mesh. He developed a large recurrent incisional hernia and underwent open hernia repair with bilateral anterior component separation, extensive lysis of adhesions, removal of prior mesh, and placement of a biologic mesh (Strattice™ RTM) in an underlay and onlay fashion. Intraoperatively, the defect measured 20 cm long by 14 cm wide. Postoperatively, he was treated for neobladder infection and CT cystogram found no extravasation from the neobladder. He presented to the emergency department 6 weeks after surgery with spontaneous partial midline wound dehiscence, with exposure of the onlay mesh and drainage of clear fluid, which was confirmed to be urine by fluid creatinine level. Repeat CT scan demonstrated a filling defect at the anterior wall of the neobladder with contrast leaking into a contained collection interposed between the anterior abdominal wall and the underlay mesh, extending superiorly between the small bowel loops and dehiscence of the midline abdominal wound. The patient was treated with a course of antibiotics and indwelling Foley catheter and bilateral nephrostomy tubes for urine diversion.\n\nResults: Three months later, repeat CT cystogram demonstrated resolution of the leak and the nephrostomy tubes and Foley catheter were removed. The patient has continued daily wound care with significant reduction in size of the midline wound and increasing granulation tissue around the onlay mesh. He has not required further admissions to hospital and there has been no hernia recurrence so far.\n\nConclusion: In the appropriate setting, contaminated biologic mesh after surgery may be treated with medical management with adequate wound closure, avoiding the need for surgery and mesh explantation.\n\nP016\n\nRobotic Retromuscular Hernia Repair Optimizes Short-Term Outcomes in Higher-Risk Patients\n\nKeith Makhecha; Sathvik Madduri; Steven D Mong, DO; Akrem Ahmed; Dimitrios Stefanidis, MD, PhD; E. Matthew Ritter, MD, MHPE; Comprehesive Hernia Program, Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis IN\n\nBackground: Smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and COPD are known risk factors for surgical site occurrences (SSO) following open ventral hernia repair. However, little evidence exists on whether these factors also significantly impact SSO after robotic hernia repair which has been shown to be associated with fewer wound complications. Our aim was to examine whether smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and COPD increase postoperative SSO after robotic retromuscular hernia repair.\n\nMethods: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was conducted for extended totally extraperitoneal (eTEP) and transversus abdominis (TAR) ventral hernia repairs performed at three hospitals within our system from October 2019 to July 2022. Patient demographics, preoperative evaluation, operative details, 30-day follow-up, and patient-reported outcomes were recorded in the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative (ACHQC) database. Patients were grouped according to exposure; smokers vs non-smokers, obesity (BMI > 40 vs < 40), and presence or absence of diabetes mellitus or COPD. The main outcome measure was SSO at one-month follow-up. Logistic regression models were used to determine the association between smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and COPD with postoperative SSO.\n\nResults: A total of 81 adult patients were included; mean age 55 ± 13 years and 41% were women. ASA scores were as follows: 1 (0%), 2 (30%), 3 (64%), and 4 (4%). The prevalence of risk factors was smoking, 17%; obesity, 16%; diabetes mellitus, 28%; and COPD, 6%. The overall SSO rate at 30-day follow-up was 12.2%. SSO rates for obese vs non-obese patients were 15.4% vs 11.5%, respectively (p = 0.7), and for smokers vs non-smokers were 11.1% vs 13.3% (p = 0.5). Logistic regression models showed that obesity (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.13,4.31; p = 0.7), diabetes (OR 2.04,95% CI 0.36,11.7; p = 0.4), smoking (OR 2.55, 95% CI 0.27,23.9; p = 0.4), and COPD (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03,3.93; p = 0.4) were not predictive of postoperative SSO.\n\nConclusion: In our study, smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and COPD did not predict 30-day follow-up wound complications after robotic retromuscular hernia repair. Given these findings, patients who are unable to optimize these risk factors may still be offered robotic retromuscular repair without increasing risk of postoperative SSO.\n\nP018\n\nComparative analysis of abdominoplasty versus minimally invasive techniques in the surgical treatment of diastasis rectus abdominis in postpartum women: a systematic review\n\nEmily Forester1; Aziz Sadiq, DO, FACOS, FACS2; 1Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine; 2Virtua Health, Department of General Surgery\n\nIntroduction: This systematic review aims to describe the surgical options available for treatment of diastasis recti in postpartum women, as well as compare current data on the effectiveness of these treatment options. Historically, diastasis recti has been repaired through open procedures, such as abdominoplasty. More recently, studies have explored other methods for the treatment of diastasis recti, including various minimally invasive surgical options.\n\nMethods: This study is a systematic review. Twelve studies ranging from 2015 to 2022 were included in this analysis. Studies were identified using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. In each database, the following search terms were used to identify relevant studies: (“Diastasis recti” or “diastasis rectus abdominis”) and (“abdominoplasty” or “open approach” or “minimally invasive” or “eTEP” or “laparoscopic” or “endoscopic”). Data from the studies that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed descriptively. Statistical comparison of surgical outcomes between studies was performed using Fisher’s Exact Test in SPSS.\n\nResults: The minimally invasive approaches identified for the repair of diastasis recti were categorized as laparoscopic pre-aponeurotic approaches, robotic approaches, and enhanced view/extended totally extraperitoneal (eTEP) approaches. These techniques were compared to two open approaches: abdominoplasty and mini-abdominoplasty. Analysis of surgical outcomes found no significant difference in the rate of seromas, surgical site infections/complications, or hematomas between abdominoplasty and minimally invasive surgical techniques (p > 0.05). Among the minimally invasive techniques, no significant difference in readmission rates were reported (p > 0.05). Additionally, no significant difference in diastasis recti recurrence rates were seen following minimally invasive or abdominoplasty repairs, except for the increased recurrence rates seen with the r-TARRD robotic technique (p < 0.05).\n\nConclusion: Although current data on minimally invasive approaches are limited, our comparison of abdominoplasty to minimally invasive techniques reveals that both open and minimally invasive approaches are viable options for diastasis recti repair in postpartum women. When deciding on the optimal approach for the repair of diastasis recti, it is important to tailor the surgical method to the patient’s desired treatment outcome. If the patient indicates a desire for the removal of excess abdominal subcutaneous tissue, abdominoplasty may be a better surgical approach. Alternatively, if the patient puts a greater emphasis on shorter recovery time and smaller surgical incisions/scars, minimally invasive approaches may be a better surgical option. Our analysis suggests that patients with diastasis recti now have the option to choose from multiple effective surgical approaches for their diastasis recti repair.\n\nP019\n\nRandomised controlled study comparing tacker fixation and non-fixation of anatomical-shaped three-dimensional mesh in laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair\n\nPawanindra Lal, MDFACSFRCSEdGlasgEngIrel1; Santhosh N, MD1; Anubhav Vindal, MDFACSFRCSEdGlasg1; Tusharindra Lal2; Niladhar S Hadke, MD1; 1Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India; 2Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education & Research, Chennai, India\n\nBackground: While flat meshes have been used in totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair for more than two decades, anatomically shaped three-dimensional meshes have advantage of being congruent to shape of myopectineal orifice and offer advantage of easy placement in preperitoneal space without any need of fixation. However, safety and efficacy of placement of these anatomical meshes without fixation have not been well-evaluated. The present study was designed to compare TEP using anatomical mesh with fixation using tacks and that without using fixation in terms of intra-operative parameters, post-operative pain and short-term complications.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Thirty adult patients meeting all inclusion criteria were randomised into two groups—GroupA—‘Fixation’ and Group B—“Nonfixation”. Various intra-operative parameters were noted, including final diagnosis, operating time, mesh deployment time, size of mesh and complications like peritoneal tear and vascular/nerve/vas deferens injury. Post-operative pain was noted using VAS pain scoring system at 24 h, 72 h, 1 wk, 1 month and 3 months. Analgesics requirement (inj. Diclofenac 75 mg tds for 1 day and tab diclofenac 50 mg SOS), duration of hospital stay, time to return to work, complications and recurrence at 3 months were noted.\n\nResults: Both tacker fixation group and non-tacker fixation group were comparable in terms of age, side and size of hernia. Mean operative time was 74.4 and 70.4 min (p 0.617), respectively, in tacker and non-tacker groups. There was no statistically significant difference between mesh deployment times in the two groups (180 versus 163 s p 0.171). There were no significant complications in either groups. There was no difference in the two groups in the VAS score at all time points except at 1 week (p.080 to 0.317). However, the analgesic requirement was significantly less in the non-fixation group (0.018). There was no statistically significant difference in duration of hospital stay (p 0.9) and return to work (p 0.669) between the two groups.\n\nConclusion: No difference in intra-operative parameters was found between laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal repair with tacker fixation and non-fixation using anatomical-shaped three-dimensional mesh. No difference was found in the immediate post-operative and short-term complications or recurrence rate between tacker fixation and non-fixation. Non-fixation of anatomically shaped three-dimensional mesh is as good as fixation in all respects with the added advantage of reduced post-operative pain, reduced analgesic usage and reduced cost (no cost of tacker).\n\nP020\n\nOutcomes of Multiple Approaches to Biosynthetic Mesh Incisional Hernia Repair after Kidney Transplant\n\nOmar Bellorin, MD, FACS, FASBMS; Amy L Holmstrom, MD; Gregory Dakin, MD; Kofi Atiemo, MD; Dustin Carpenter, MD; Rebecca Craig-Schapiro, MD; Sandeep Kapur, MD; Cheguevara Afaneh, MD; Weill Cornell Medical Center\n\nBackground: Post-operative incisional hernias are a common occurrence in the transplant population. Hernia following kidney transplantation further complicates repair due to the location of the operative incision. The goal of this study was to compare recurrence rates between various operative approaches after biosynthetic mesh incisional hernia repair in patients after kidney transplant.\n\nMethods: Using a prospectively maintained database, a retrospective review was performed for patients undergoing elective incisional hernia repair following kidney transplantation from January 2017 to June 2022. All patients were on a steroid-based immunosuppressive regimen at the time of hernia repair. A Gibson incision was performed at the index surgery for kidney transplantation. Hernia repairs were approached either open or robotic assisted via an intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) technique or a robotic transabdominal preperitoneal (RTAPP) mesh technique. Biosynthetic mesh was used in all cases. Patients who were actively smoking and hernia surgery in the setting of perforations were excluded.\n\nResults: A total of 96 patients were included; 21 underwent an open approach, 18 had an IPOM, and 57 had an RTAPP. Average follow-up was 24 months (range 6–48 months). There were no significant differences in age, sex, BMI, co-morbidities (diabetes, smoking history), or hernia defect size (p > 0.05). The average time to incisional hernia repair following kidney transplant was 5 ± 2 months. The open approach took significantly longer than the other approaches (156 min vs. 131 min RTAPP, 109 min IPOM; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in surgical site occurrences (infection, seroma, hematoma, wound dehiscence) or postoperative morbidity (p > 0.05). Recurrence rates were highest in the IPOM cohort at 12 months (6.7% vs. 0% open, 1.9% RTAPP) and at 24 months (13.8% vs. 5.95 open, 1.9% RTAPP).\n\nConclusion: Biosynthetic mesh incisional hernia repair following kidney transplantation has the lowest intermediate term recurrence rate with an RTAPP technique. Intraperitoneal onlay mesh is the least durable repair when compared to both the open approach and RTAPP. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine durability of repair by operative technique in the kidney transplant population.\n\nP021\n\nEstablishment of a Minimally Invasive Abdominal Wall Reconstruction Program at a Community Hospital\n\nDavid Roberts; Olivia Haney, MD; Indraneil Mukherjee, MD, MBBS; Staten Island University Hospital\n\nStudy Objective: To illustrate how a minimally invasive abdominal wall reconstruction program was successfully established at a community style hospital.\n\nMethods and Procedures: Twenty-four patients underwent abdominal wall reconstruction (AWR) between January 2017 and June 2022 by a single surgeon at our institution. Lifestyle information (smoking, diabetes, and obesity status) and procedure-related metrics (pre-operative botox use, hernia characteristics, and mesh type) were obtained. The ellipsoid formula (V = 4/3ABC) was used to calculate volume of the hernia sac (VIH) and abdominal cavity (VAC) (Fig. 1). Measurements at initial visit and time of surgery were compared and analyzed using a two-tailed T Test (p < 0.05 signified significance).\n\nResults: Pre-operative counseling results are shown in Table 1. Procedure-related metrics are shown in Table 2.\n\nConclusion: Extensive counseling for modifiable risk factors such as weight loss, smoking cessation, and diabetes control was emphasized in our patient population. This significantly reduced the CeDAR risk scores in all categories. Chemical component separation with botox has become standard in our program. All patients underwent successful primary closure, even with loss of domain. This study demonstrates the steps we have taken to optimize patients with complex ventral hernias and the benefits of a standardized protocol for minimally invasive abdominal wall reconstruction at our community hospital.\n\nTable 1 Lifestyle Information\n\nFirst visitPre-op%changeSignificanceActive smokers51− 80.00%HbA1C6.986.24− 10.57%p < 0.05Excess body weight (kgs)29.828.5− 4.41%p = 0.23BMI (kg/m^2)32.1631.75− 1.30%p = 0.27CeDAR SCORES:Risk of complications35.29%31.5%− 10.74%p < 0.05In-Hospital charges$7221.46$6435.50− 10.88%p < 0.05Follow-up charges$17,193.58$15,322.42− 10.88%p < 0.05\n\nTable 2 Procedure metrics (averages)\n\nLength of counseling233 days% Received Botox11/24% Stayed MIS14/24Defect Size71.89 cm^2VIH483 ccVAC5766 ccVIH/VAC0.088\n\nFig. 1 Hernia sac measurements for calculating VIH (Left to right: axial, sagittal, coronal)\n\nP022\n\nVentral hernia repair and intra-abdominal cancer\n\nS. Harris A Bokhari, MBBS, MD1; Lucas Fair, MD1; Simon Esteva, MD2; Tanner Mathews, MD1; Bola Aladegbami, MD1; Marc Ward, MD1; Steven Leeds, MD1; Gerald O Ogola, PhD3; Daniel G Davis, DO1; 1Baylor University Medical Center; 2Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine; 3Baylor Scott and White Health Research Institute\n\nIntroduction: Many cancer survivors live with complex abdominal wall hernias. These have been shown to significantly impact their quality of life as they have major physical, social, and emotional repercussions. From a surgeon perspective, these can be challenging to manage due to potential for postoperative complications, such as wound complications caused by chemotherapy and/or radiation, hospital-acquired infections, and DVT/PE. Even though these risks are legitimate concerns, there are limited data evaluating the outcomes of ventral hernia repair in patients with a history of IAC. This study aimed to analyze outcomes in patients with history of cancer undergoing Ventral Hernia Repair (VHR). We hypothesized patients with a history of Intra-Abdominal Cancer (IAC) that would have increased length of stay, 30-day post-op outcomes, and a higher rate of hernia reoccurrence.\n\nMethods: A retrospective review of our institution’s database from January 2014 to February 2022 was used to identify patients undergoing ventral hernia repair with a history of IAC. These patients were compared to a control group of patients who underwent ventral hernia repair without a history IAC. Demographics, operative factors, and perioperative outcomes were collected for both groups. Risk-adjusted analysis was then used to measure the effect of IAC on length of stay, 30-day outcomes, and hernia reoccurrence.\n\nResults: 428 hernia repair patients were identified (IAC: 76, No IAC: 352). When comparing baseline characteristics, patients with history of IAC had higher rates of hypertension (64.5% vs 46.2% p < 0.01), diabetes (32.9% vs 17.5% p < 0.01), and increased age (68.1 vs 55.7, p < 0.01). In regards to operative approach, the IAC group had a higher incidence of robotic hernia repairs (22.4% vs 8.6%, p < 0.01). When comparing surgical outcomes, there was no statistically significant difference in length of stay, hernia reoccurrence, 30-day SSI/SSO, and DVT/PE between the IAC and no IAC groups. A risk-adjusted analysis was also performed, showing patients with IAC had no significant increase in risk for longer length of stay, hernia reoccurrence, or 30-day SSI/SSO. In a matched cohort comparing the groups, there were no differences in hernia recurrence, LOS, SSI, SSO, and DVT/PE.\n\nConclusion: Patients with a history of IAC cancer do not have a significant increase risk for postoperative complications after VHR and can undergo VHR with good outcomes without significant risk for postoperative complications.\n\nP024\n\nOperative time and lengths of hospital stay for inguinal hernia repair among open, laparoscopic, and robotic-assisted approaches: a single-center experience\n\nAntoinette Hu, MD; Rachel Lyn-Sue; Parth Sharma, MD; Vamsi Alli, MD; Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center\n\nIntroduction: Although open inguinal hernia repair (IHR) has traditionally been the standard of care, laparoscopic and robotic-assisted laparoscopic approaches have become more commonplace. There is currently no consensus on the best surgical approach.\n\nMethods: This is a retrospective review of elective IHR in adult patients performed by six general surgeons from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021. Patients undergoing simultaneous procedures were excluded. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the mean operative times (OT) and lengths of stay (LOS) for each approach.\n\nResults: 184 patients with mean age of 58.8 (standard deviation SD ± 16.8), mean BMI of 26.9 (SD ± 4.3), and mean ASA of 2.15 (SD ± 0.68) were included. 89.7% were male, 20% (n = 37) of hernias were recurrent, and 43% (n = 80) patients had a history of abdominal surgery. There were zero intraoperative complications and a 4.3% postoperative recurrence rate (n = 8). 46.7% (n = 86) and 53.2% (n = 98) of patients underwent unilateral and bilateral repair, respectively. In the unilateral IHR group, OT and LOS for each approach were not significantly different from each other (p = 0.64 and p = 0.83, respectively). In the bilateral IHR group, LOS were not significantly different either (p = 0.08). In the bilateral IHR group, the mean OT for open, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches were significantly different from each other at 94, 100.3, and 152.3 min, respectively (p < 0.05).\n\nConclusion: When compared to open or laparoscopic approaches, operative time in robotic approaches is the longest at our institution for bilateral IHR but not unilateral IHR. There was no significant difference in operative times for unilateral IHR performed by open, laparoscopic, or robotic techniques, which could be attributed to the more achievable learning curve with newer minimally invasive techniques. The operative time was significantly greater in the bilateral IHR robotic group, which may be due to the complexity of cases being selected for this technique. We believe that surgeons should be able to offer open, laparoscopic, and robotic techniques for IHR in order to choose the appropriate technique for each patient.\n\nP025\n\nQuantitative Sensory Testing for quantifying and correlating pain threshold in preoperative and post-operative period in patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair\n\nVirinder Bansal, Prof; Shivam Singh; Omprakash Prajapati; Renu Bhatia; Krishna Asuri; AIIMS, New Delhi\n\nBackground: The main aim of the study was to quantify the preoperative pain threshold in patients with groin hernia using quantitative sensory testing (QST) with thermal stimulus and to correlate it with post-operative pain outcomes following laparoscopic groin hernia surgery.\n\nMaterials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted from January 2020 to June 2021. Preoperative pain threshold was assessed using quantitative sensory testing (QST) using both hot and cold stimulus and also on visual analogue scale. Postoperatively, pain was assessed using VAS at 24 h, 1 week, 6 weeks, and 3 months. A repeat pain threshold measurement was done at the end of 3-month post-operative using QST.\n\nResults: 20 patients with complicated groin hernia were included in the study and 20 normal individuals were taken as controls. Both the groups were comparable in terms of demographic profile. Pain threshold in preoperative period was significantly lower in patients with groin hernia on affected side as compared to controls (p < 0.001). On comparing, VAS with QST in the post-operative period, pain threshold on QST with hot and cold stimulus increases with decreasing pain score on VAS. Pain threshold increases on the hernia side as compared to the preoperative period which was also statistically significant (p < 0.05). This implies that patients having low thermal threshold in preoperative period have more pain in the post-operative period. However, there was a significant decrease in the pain threshold following surgery.\n\nBoth TAPP and TEP were comparable in terms of pain threshold and complications, like seroma. Patients developing seroma experienced more pain on VAS at 1-week post-surgery; however, the QST at 3 months was similar. Pain threshold did not have any statistically significant correlation between age, operative procedure, and type of hernia.\n\nConclusion: Patients having more pain in preoperative period have low thermal pain threshold. The pain threshold increases significantly in the post-operative period suggesting that hernia repair improves the pain threshold of the patient.\n\nP027\n\nAssociation of Mesh Fixation with Reoperation and Readmission Risk\n\nAlison N Pletch, MD; Luke Funk, MD, MPH, FACS; Lily Stalter, MS; Amber Shada, MD, FACS; David Harris, MD; Anne Lidor, MD, MPH, FACS; University of Wisconsin\n\nIntroduction: Mesh fixation in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is used to reduce the risk of mesh displacement and subsequent recurrence, but, has also been associated with complications related to local trauma, such as nerve damage and chronic pain. The objective of our study was to investigate surgical outcomes related to mesh fixation. We hypothesize that fixation of mesh would not be associated with readmission or reoperation after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.\n\nMethods and Procedures: A retrospective cohort study was performed at a single academic institution. All patients undergoing elective laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (transabdominal preperitoneal and total extraperitoneal approaches) from 2013 to 2021 were included. The primary outcome was a composite variable of readmission and reoperation relating to the inguinal hernia repair within 6 months of surgery. Patient demographic characteristics were compared between groups with bivariate analysis using Pearson’s chi-squared test. A logistic regression analysis of readmission/reoperation as the outcome was performed adjusting for fixation, surgery type, unilateral versus bilateral hernias, and recurrent hernia.\n\nResults: Baseline demographics and co-morbidities of the study participants were comparable between groups (Fig. 1). Of 1674 inguinal repairs, 481 (29%) did not have any mesh fixation and 43 (2.57%) patients were either readmitted or re-operated on within 6 months for a complication related to their inguinal hernia operation. Of the readmissions/reoperations, 32 (2.68%) of those patients had hernia repairs performed with mesh fixation, while 11 (2.29%) had hernia repairs without. Logistic regression analysis did not demonstrate a significant increase in reoperation/readmission for patients with mesh fixation (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.59–2.36) (Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 1 Patient demographic information\n\nFig. 2 Multivariable logistic regression\n\nConclusion: These data suggest that mesh fixation during laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is not associated with reoperation/readmission within 6 months. Without a clear benefit to mesh fixation, it may be an unnecessary step that increases both costs and risk of chronic pain. Further studies are needed to evaluate longer-term recurrence rates in this cohort.\n\nP029\n\nSaphena Varix: An Uncommon Condition Easily Mistaken for Reducible Hernia in the Evaluation of Groin Masses\n\nPhillip B Cox, MD1; Katherine H Yancey, MD, FACS2; 1Mountain Area Health Education Center (MAHEC); 2Department of Surgery, Mission Hospital, HCA Healthcare\n\nThe high frequency of surgical referrals for hernia evaluation demands prudent review of differential diagnoses that mimic inguinal or femoral hernias. We report a case of a 41-year-old female referred by her gynecologist for evaluation of a groin swelling felt to be a lymph node. Symptoms appeared 2 months prior to presentation including constipation and radicular pain down the ipsilateral leg, but no obstructive symptoms. On examination, the patient had a soft, readily reducible bulge in the medial thigh below the inguinal ligament which reliably recurred upon standing with coexisting ipsilateral varicose veins in the calf. No recent imaging was available for review. The patient was taken to the operating room for planned combined laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and possible hernia repair. A small femoral hernia was identified and repaired via TAPP technique. At 2-week follow-up, the patient’s symptoms and bulge had not abated. Further evaluation by a vein specialist diagnosed a Saphena Varix, an abnormal dilation of the Great Saphenous Vein (GSV) near the Sapheno-Femoral junction. Given the similar clinical presentations, even the experienced clinician may be challenged when differentiating a Saphena Varix from a reducible hernia. Venous insufficiency, presenting with concomitant venous varicosity, is often idiopathic and can result in the development of Saphena Varices via reflux into the GSV at its origin. Clinical suspicion for Saphena Varices should therefore be increased in the presence of varicose veins. We offer recommendations for efficient differentiation of these conditions in the outpatient clinical setting to prevent a missed diagnosis or unnecessary surgical risk.\n\nP030\n\nA novel approach for foramen of Winslow hernia repair\n\nAlejandro F Sanz, MD1; Luke Brawer2; Natalie Telscher3; 1OSF St Anthony's Health Center; 2Georgia Tech; 3Clemson University\n\nIntroduction: Foramen of Winslow hernias are exceedingly rare. Prompt diagnosis and surgical management are important. Many different repairs have been described in the literature. Here, we present a novel laparoscopic approach to these difficult cases.\n\nMethods and procedures: An 81-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the emergency room with a complaint of 24-h epigastric pain, associated with nausea. She had history of a laparoscopic reduction of the foramen of Winslow internal hernia in our institution. CT scan of her abdomen showed a lesser sac internal hernia with an incarcerated colon and underwent a laparoscopic repair with a flap of falciform ligament and laparoscopic cecopexy. The surgery was successful.\n\nResults: Foramen of Winslow hernias, a rare type of internal hernia. Internal hernias have an incidence rate of less than one percent, with Foramen of Winslow hernias accounting for only 8% of all internal hernias. The case at hand involves an 81-year-old Caucasian women who described a prior history of hypertension and a past laparoscopic reduction of the Foramen of Winslow internal hernia in the past. She had complaints of 24-h epigastric pain associated with nausea. She underwent a CT scan of her abdomen which revealed a lesser sac internal hernia with an incarcerated colon and was taken to the operating room where her Foramen of Winslow internal hernia was repaired laparoscopically using a flap of falciform ligament. The hernia contents included the ascending colon and ileum and were viable. A laparoscopic cecopexy and a flap of falciform ligament were done. The surgery was successful.\n\nConclusion: Foramen of Winslow internal hernias are exceedingly rare, as they account for approximately 8% of all internal hernias, which themselves have a precedence of less than 1%. Despite limited occurrence of Foramen of Winslow hernias, these hernias have mortality rates as high as 49%. Once diagnosed, several methods for repairing Foramen of Winslow hernias have been described. As surgical equipment and technology continue to improve, many surgeons have been switching from laparotomies to a laparoscopic approach. When the cecum shows signs of excessive movement, a cecopexy is often performed laparoscopically to limit such movement. In addition to cecopexy, a flap of falciform ligament was created in order to obliterate the space into the Foramen of Winslow. This novel approach has not been described in the literature. We strongly believe that it should be included as an option to treat these difficult hernias in the future.\n\nP035\n\nAbdominal wall injury from laparoscopic trocar insertion\n\nJason D'Cruz, MD; Alex Tse, MD; Mount Sinai—South Nassau, Oceanside, NY\n\nIntroduction: Trocar insertion is an essential part of laparoscopic surgery. Vascular injury and gastrointestinal perforation are the most common access-related complications. Veress needles and placement of primary trocar are most commonly implicated in vascular injuries. Herewith, we present a case of an abdominal wall hematoma resulting from a 5-mm port insertion and review the literature.\n\nCase Report: A 43-yer-old female presented with lower abdominal pain for 2 days associated with nausea and fever. She was diagnosed with acute appendicitis and was taken for laparoscopic appendectomy. Access to the abdomen was achieved using a Veress needle at the left upper quadrant. A supraumbilical midline incision was made and a 10-mm optical trocar was inserted into the abdomen. Subsequently, two 5-mm bladed trocars were inserted in the left lower quadrant and suprapubic region. The rest of the procedure was carried out in a routine fashion. Notably, the trocars were removed under direct visualization and with no apparent bleeding from the port sites. A few hours later, a 10 × 15-cm swelling was found over the lateral abdominal wall port site associated with skin ecchymosis. The swelling was asymptomatic and the patient was discharged the next day. She presented to the emergency room 10 days later with pain associated with swelling and fever. CT imaging confirmed an abscess collection associated with the hematoma which was percutaneously drained. The patient was discharged 3 days later after removal of the drain\n\nDiscussion: The reported rate of vascular injury is about 1 to 6 per 1000 laparoscopic surgeries. Abdominal wall vessels, most commonly the inferior epigastric artery, or intraabdominal mesenteric or larger vessels may be injured. Bleeding is rarely observed during surgery as the insufflated abdomen creates a tamponade effect over the vessel. A hematoma, as seen in our case, develops in the recovery room or up to 2–3 days postoperatively. Bladed cutting trocars are more likely to cause vascular injury than smooth trocars. Abdominal wall hematomas may be managed conservatively unless causing hemodynamic instability. Mortality associated with intraabdominal injury is about 15%. Knowledge of the abdominal wall anatomy, transilluminating the abdominal wall before introducing trocars, and entering the abdomen at the correct angle decrease the possibility of vascular injury.\n\nFigure Rule of 2/3rd. Medial 2/3rd of the abdominal wall is unsafe for trocar insertion except of avascular midline.\n\nP036\n\nEarly experience of emergency laparoscopic repair of groin hernias within an emergency surgical unit (ESU)\n\nMan Hon Tang; Isa Jusoff Albar Muhammed; Yuen Soon; Ng Teng Fong General Hospital\n\nBackground: The majority of emergency groin hernias are still repaired via the open approach, usually by a junior surgeon or resident in a teaching hospital. Laparoscopic repair still remains uncommon despite it being the standard approach for appendicectomies and cholecystectomies for typical emergency cases. The ESU presents a unique opportunity whereby a senior surgeon is involved with surgical emergencies early and is available to decide and operate on suitable cases for laparoscopic hernia repair. We reviewed our institution’s outcomes for emergency laparoscopic repair of groin hernias. These cases typically are admitted via the emergency department and are managed by the ESU.\n\nMethods: This is a retrospective analysis of patients admitted in the last 6 years (June 2016–June 2022) and had emergency laparoscopic repair of groin hernias during the same admission. Patients’ demographic details, type of hernia, operative findings, time and type of hernia repair, post-operative course, and complications were extracted.\n\nResults: A total of 35 patients with a mean age of 61 (range 23–94) years old underwent emergency laparoscopic repair of groin hernias. 4 cases were bilateral and 4 were recurrent groin hernias. All cases were reviewed within 12 h and performed by consultant surgeons with a mean operative time of 101.08 ± 46.89 min. 2 cases require bowel resection after hernia repair was performed laparoscopically and only 1 case was converted to open repair due to serosal tears during dissection. The remaining 20 and 14 cases were repaired via the transabdominal pre-peritoneal and total extra-peritoneal approach, respectively. There were 4 cases of obturator hernias that were repair successfully laparoscopically. The majority of patients (68.6%) tolerated diet by the next post-op date. The mean post-operative stay was 3.11 days. There were no mesh infection but 4 patients developed post-operative seroma that were treated conservatively. There were no recurrence at short-term follow-up.\n\nConclusion: Emergency laparoscopic repair of groin hernias is feasible with good outcomes. The benefits of laparoscopic repair includes the ability to assess bowel integrity even after hernia repair, to deal with recurrent, bilateral ,and even obturator hernias easily as well as faster post-operative recovery. An emergency surgical unit (ESU) allows for careful patient selection with experienced surgeons which are essential for success. Operative time is longer due to cases of bilateral hernias as well as the initial learning curve.\n\nP038\n\nInguinal Hernia Prevention in Penile Prosthesis Implantation via Peno-scrotal Approach\n\nJavereeya Abdul Jabbar, MD1; Shadi Al-Bahri, MD, FACS2; 1Tawam Hospital; 2UAE University\n\nIntroduction: The incidence of inguinal hernia following implantation of three-piece penile prostheses is under-reported. Migration of prosthesis reservoir is a known but rare complication, particularly in patients with an undiagnosed inguinal hernia or those with known risk factors, such as obesity and chronic cough. Dissection of the space may also further weaken the posterior wall of the inguinal canal increasing the risk of future hernia development.\n\nMaterial and Methods: Implantation of penile prosthesis is performed by urologists for management of refractory erectile dysfunction. A case series of three patients underwent the procedure and presented thereafter with direct inguinal hernias including the reservoir as part of the hernia sac. These were managed by intra-operative consultation with the general surgeon or through delayed consultation due to development of the hernia days to months following implantation.\n\nResults: A peno-scrotal approach was used in the initial procedure where the reservoir is placed within the space of Retzius. All three patients presented with a weakness in the posterior wall compatible with a previously undiagnosed direct inguinal hernia through which the reservoir had migrated. Although laparoscopic repair is possible, dissection of the reservoir adjacent to the bladder for mesh placement may risk bladder injury and is therefore unadvisable. Repair was done using the standard open Lichtenstein technique with one important modification. Since the tubing from the reservoir descends from the space of Retzius through the posterior wall, past the mesh, and into the scrotum—a separate opening on the medial aspect of the mesh is performed in the same fashion as the slit created laterally to accommodate the spermatic cord. All patients were seen in the office for follow-up with no immediate complication.\n\nConclusion: All patients undergoing penile prosthesis implantation should be screened for inguinal hernia or generalized weakness either through dynamic abdominal wall ultrasound or referral to a general surgeon. Risk factors include chronic cough and high BMI. Once identified, a combined procedure can be performed by modifying the open Lichtenstein technique to accommodate the tubing traversing the inguinal canal and prevent future herniation through the weakened posterior wall.\n\nP039\n\nA case report of transverse colon Richter’s hernia with a brief literature review\n\nKangmin Kim, MD1; Azzan Arif, MD2; Pablo Giuseppucci, MD3; 1University of Toledo; 2Western Reserve Health Education Inc.; 3Steward Health Care System\n\nA Richter’s hernia can be defined as the protuberance of the bowel through an abdominal fascial defect, wherein only a part of the circumference of the bowel, usually the antimesenteric border, is entrapped and/or strangulated in the hernial orifice. Although the segment of the entrapped bowel is usually a portion of the ileum, any part of the intestinal tract from the stomach to the colon can be involved. This report discusses a case of a 65-year-old female with history of multiple cesarean sections, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy, and open cholecystectomy, now presenting with a chief complaint of severe epigastric pain evolving for 24 h. Preoperative abdominal CT with contrast visualized a ventral abdominal hernia containing a portion of transverse colon without evidence of obstruction or angulation. Diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed an incarcerated Richter’s ventral hernia with transverse colon which was repaired with intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM). Richter’s hernia is particularly common in frail, elderly women. With its non-specific clinical findings, it can be associated with a high rate of misdiagnosis and under-treatment. Abdominal CT are recommended along with timely surgical intervention to prevent mortality and worsening prognosis.\n\nP040\n\nPantaloon Inguinal Hernia with Endometriosis\n\nFadi Jallad; Mazen Hashim; Mohammed Bashenfer; GNP Hospital, Jeddah\n\nIntroduction: Pantaloon inguinal hernia (direct and indirect hernia) is a very rare variety in female patients but also uncommon to present with endometriosis mass in the inguinal canal.\n\nThe Case: A 41-year-old female patient complained of right inguinal pain and swelling 8 months ago. The pain was intermittent and sharp in intensity during the menstruation period. She had a past surgical history of partial hepatectomy and cesarean section 8 years ago. Inguinal examination showed a firm mass in the inguinal area with a positive cough impulse. An abdominal CT scan revealed an RT inguinal-herniated soft tissue structure seen protruded to subcutaneous tissue through the inguinal canal. She underwent an open inguinal hernia repair under general anesthesia. During surgery, we found a firm mass bulging through an external inguinal orifice to subcutaneous tissue surrounded by extensive adhesion. The inguinal canal opened and the finding was indirect inguinal hernia sac, omental content, attached firmly with the mass, and direct hernia. The mass was excised completely and Lichtenstein open “tension-free” mesh repair of inguinal hernias was done. The histopathology report demonstrated an endometriosis mass. Patient discharged in well-general condition to be followed up in the outpatient clinic.\n\nConclusion: Endometriosis with pantaloon hernia is a rare case presentation. Inguinal hernia with mass in a female patient and endometriosis is one of the important differential diagnoses.\n\nP041\n\nEffects of Mesh Weight on Lateral Abdominal Wall Hernia Repair: An Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative (ACHQC) Analysis\n\nRui-Min D Mao, MD1; Robert Tamer, MPH, MPA2; Sergio Mazzola Poli De Figueiredo, MD1; Luciano Tastaldi, MD1; Giovanna Dela Tejera, BS1; Richard Lu, MD1; 1University of Texas Medical Branch; 2The Ohio State University\n\nIntroduction: Lateral abdominal wall hernias (European Hernia Society classification L1–L4) are challenging to repair due to anatomic location and limited data to drive operative decisions. There are no guidelines for mesh selection in these patients; this currently is left to surgeon preference. Heavyweight mesh provides increased tensile strength but is associated with greater foreign body reaction and mesh sensation. We evaluated the effect of mesh weight on 30-day postoperative outcomes following lateral hernia repair.\n\nMethods: Patients who underwent a lateral hernia repair with 30-day follow-up were identified in the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative (ACHQC) database. The mesh used was categorized as heavy or non-heavyweight; heavyweight was defined as density > 75 g/m2, and non-heavyweight was ≤ 75 g/m2. Outcomes were compared between the two groups using multiple logistic regression with adjusted odds ratios (OR).\n\nResults: The ACHQC identified 4130 lateral hernia repairs: 1357 with heavyweight mesh and 2773 with non-heavyweight mesh. Patients with a history of smoking, hypertension, and larger hernia dimensions were significantly more likely to have heavyweight mesh. Heavyweight mesh patients were less likely to develop a surgical site occurrence (SSO) (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.64–0.96; p = 0.02) or be readmitted (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.56–0.97; p = 0.02) compared to those with non-heavyweight mesh. The difference in SSO was attributed to a higher rate of seroma in the non-heavyweight mesh group (5.99% vs. 3.91%; p = 0.005). Mesh weight was not significant in predicting the other outcomes of hernia recurrence, chronic pain, surgical site infection (SSI), surgical site occurrence requiring procedural intervention (SSOPI), and reoperation (Table).\n\nConclusion: Heavyweight mesh use in lateral abdominal wall hernia repair is associated with decreased rates of SSO and readmission. Mesh weight did not have a significant effect on other postoperative outcomes, including chronic pain and hernia recurrence. Future prospective and randomized controlled studies are necessary to confirm our findings.\n\nTable Postoperative outcomes of heavyweight mesh patients compared to non-heavyweight (reference)\n\nOdds ratio (95% CI)p-valueChronic pain1.24(0.48–3.23)0.66Recurrence0.55(0.11–2.71)0.46SSI0.90(0.66–1.22)0.48SSO0.79(0.64–0.97)0.02*SSOPI0.80(0.61–1.06)0.11Readmission0.73(0.56–0.96)0.02*Reoperation0.91(0.60–1.39)0.67\n\nP042\n\nLaugier’s Hernia Case Report\n\nChristopher M Fiorina1; Amritpal Jagra2; Brandon Arnsburger, DO3; 1Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine; 2Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine; 3UPMC Community Osteopathic Hospital\n\nA 63-year-old male with past surgical history including laparoscopic left inguinal repair with mesh and past medical history of Barrett’s esophagus, Gilbert’s syndrome, and gout presents to the emergency department with RLQ pain and nausea/vomiting. The patient is a construction worker and two weeks prior was lifting concrete blocks when he felt “something pop.” On exam, he had an indurated mass in the right groin that was tender and non-reducible. CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast was performed. Findings were suggestive of a right femoral hernia causing a small bowel obstruction.\n\nDuring the surgery, the peritoneum was entered superior to the hernia sac. A Hasan trocar and camera were inserted into the abdomen, and two 5-mm ports were placed in the lower left quadrant. Dissection was carried down in the extraperitoneal plane to the hernia defect. The defect was observed passing through the lacunar ligament (Laugier’s hernia) and close to the pubic bone. The bowel was then reduced in a manner similar to a femoral hernia. The bowel was examined, and where it appeared hyperemic but with peristalsis and no necrosis present. A polypropylene mesh plug was inserted into the hernia defect and tacked to the nearby pubic bone. The peritoneal flap was sutured back to the anterior abdominal wall using a 3.0 Polysorb suture. The patient tolerated the surgery well and was discharged the following day.\n\nTwo days later, the patient returned to the emergency room with abdominal pain and nonbilious emesis with food intake. The patient had leukocytosis at 12.6. CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast was taken and revealed repair of hernia without recurrence and some minor fluid-filled small bowel suggestive of an ileus. Within two days, the patient was discharged with stable vital signs and tolerance to advances in the diet.\n\nP043\n\nDeveloping a patient-reported outcome measure to assess recovery after abdominal surgery: item analysis using Rasch measurement theory\n\nElahe Khorasani, PhD1; Fateme Rajabiyazdi, PhD2; Hiba Elhaj, MD1; Katy Dmowski, MSc1; Anne-Sophie Poirier, MD1; Rabab Alabdullah, MD1; Christos Mousoulis, PhD1; Tahereh Najafi Ghezeljeh, PhD1; Nancy Mayo, PhD1; Lawrence Lee, PhD1; Liane S. Feldman, MD1; Julio Fiore Jr, PhD1; 1McGill University; 2Carleton University\n\nIntroduction: In keeping with the principles of patient-centered care, patients’ voices must be included in the measurement of recovery after abdominal surgery using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). However, the PROMs currently used to measure recovery after abdominal surgery were not developed according to optimal scientific standards and have limited evidence supporting their measurement properties. To address this research gap, we initiated a research program to develop a conceptually relevant and psychometrically sound PROM to measure recovery after abdominal surgery; the Recovery After Abdominal Surgery (RAAS) score. Preliminary qualitative work led to the development of a conceptual framework of recovery and the creation of relevant measurement items. The aim of the present study is to further refine the item pool using Rasch analysis and assess the measurement properties of the RAAS score.\n\nMethods and Procedures: In this prospective cohort study, 100 adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery were recruited to complete the preliminary RAAS 59-item pool (via an online questionnaire) preoperatively and at postoperative days (PODs) 1, 7, 30, and 90. Item responses will be assessed using Rasch analysis (via RUMM2030 software), a statistical method that uses various diagnostic information (i.e., error estimates and fit statistics) to select the best items and create an accurate scoring algorithm for the final questionnaire. In the subsequent stage of our program, the calibrated RAAS questionnaire will be administered to a new cohort of 200 abdominal surgery patients for further assessment of measurement properties (i.e., construct validity, reliability, and responsiveness) according to COSMIN (Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments). The next phases of this research program include the development of computer adaptive testing for RAAS (to reduce response burden) and user-friendly electronic platforms (mobile app and web portal) for data collection.\n\nResults: Between October 2021 and September 2022, 192 patients undergoing abdominal surgery at three university-affiliated hospitals were screened for eligibility, 151 met inclusion criteria, and 100 consented to participation (mean age 57 ± 14.7, 49% female, 59% laparoscopic surgery, 66% major/ major extended procedure). Response rates were 97% preoperatively, 93% on POD1, 91% POD7, 91% POD30, and 87% POD90. Rasch analysis of responses to the RAAS 59-item pool is currently underway.\n\nConclusion: As surgery enters the era of patient-centered care, PROMs have become an essential part of measuring postoperative recovery. The RAAS score will help incorporate patients’ perspectives and experiences into research and quality improvement initiatives in abdominal surgery.\n\nP044\n\nImpact of obesity on 30-day and 1-year outcomes after eTEP ventral hernia repair\n\nRobert A Spencer, MD; Matthew Sarna, MD; Pooja Patel, MD; Charlotte Young, BS; Priya Nyayapati, BS; T. Paul Singh, MD, FACS; Jessica A Zaman, MD, FACS; Albany Medical Center\n\nBackground: Obesity with BMI > 35 kg/m2 has been described as an independent risk factor for increased morbidity after ventral hernia repair (VHR), especially after an open approach. Robotic enhanced view totally extraperitoneal (eTEP) hernia repair is a novel approach that is pushing the boundaries of hernia surgery. We aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy in adapting this new technique during the perioperative time frame in high-risk patients (BMI > 35 kg/m2).\n\nMethods: A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing incisional hernia repair using the robotic eTEP technique was performed over a two-year period. Patient demographics and comorbidities, perioperative variables, 30-day, and 1 year outcomes were stratified according to BMI < 35 kg/m2 (acceptable risk) and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 (high risk). Statistical analysis for both cohorts was performed employing student’s t test for nominal variables and chi-squared analysis for categorical variables.\n\nResults: 97 eTEP procedures were performed from April 2018 to 2020. 60 patients were in the acceptable risk cohort (mean 28.8 kg/m2) and 37 patients were high risk (mean 41.0 kg/m2). There was no difference in age (55.0 acceptable vs. 53.9 high, p = 0.67), gender distribution (41.7% male acceptable vs. 32.4% male high, p = 0.36), diabetic status (15% acceptable vs. 29.7% high, p = 0.08), or smoking status (16.7% acceptable vs. 10.8% high, p = 0.43) between the two cohorts. Operative times (average 143 min acceptable vs. Average 174 min high, p = 0.28) and conversion rates (1.7% acceptable vs. 5.4% high, p = 0.30) were also not statistically significant. Hospital length of stay was equivocal (average 1.4 days acceptable vs. 1.3 days high, p = 0.83). There were no differences in 30-day outcomes, including surgical site infection, seroma, hematoma, ileus, small bowel obstruction, any complication, emergency room visits, hospital readmissions, or reoperation. Average hernia size was significantly larger in the higher-risk group (average 8.8 cm2 acceptable vs. 15.9 cm2 high, p < 0.005). There was a higher rate of recurrence in the high-risk group. Number of recurrent ventral hernias at one year postoperatively was equivocal (8.3% acceptable vs. 8.1% days high, p = 0.97).\n\nConclusion: The robotic eTEP approach is safe in high-risk patients with elevated BMI (≥ 35 kg/m2) and recurrence rates of ventral hernia were similar at one year postoperatively. The relationship between obesity and post-operative complications needs to be re-examined for the eTEP approach as the threshold for safe and durable outcomes exceeds the previous BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 threshold.\n\nP045\n\nRobotic Ventral Hernia Repair in the Community Setting: 4-Year Follow-Up\n\nSteven Boehm, DO; William Childers, DO; UPMC Harrisburg\n\nBackground: Ventral hernia repair is one of the most common surgeries performed by general surgeons. Recently, minimally invasive techniques involving robotic ventral hernia repairs have become increasingly more popular among surgeons and patients. Though there are a significant number of studies demonstrating equivalent or improved outcomes in the short term, there are a limited number of studies looking at the long-term recurrence rates with robotic ventral hernia repairs. In this study, we aim to look at the recurrence rates of robotic ventral hernia repairs from 2014 to 2018, with a minimum of a 4-year follow-up.\n\nMethods: We performed a retrospective study of patients who underwent a robotic ventral hernia repair in the UPMC Central Pennsylvania system between 2014 and 2018. Patient demographics, co-morbid conditions, and post-operative complications were tracked. Utilizing electronic medical record and office documentation, hernia recurrences were identified.\n\nResults: 121 patients had robotic ventral hernia repairs during this time period. Mean age was 59.5 years, mean BMI was 34.6, 49 (40.5%) were male, and 61 (59.5%) were female. The most common type of mesh used was Ventrio ST (34, 38%) and the most common type of procedure performed was IPOM (103, 95%). 41 (34%) of patients had a hernia recurrence within our follow-up period. COPD (5, p = 0.0436) and post-operative seroma (9, p = 0.022) were the only factors found to be significantly associated with recurrence.\n\nDiscussion: The hernia recurrence rate with a minimum of a 4-year follow-up was 34%. Looking at the data more closely shows a substantial learning curve. The recurrence rate over the first three years is 51%. The recurrence rate for the remainder of the repairs was 20%. This is suggesting that the surgeons’ technique and results improved with time. The patient factors associated with recurrence that demonstrated statistical significance were COPD and post-operative seroma. Further follow-up is necessary to demonstrate the longevity and durability of a robotic ventral hernia repair.\n\nP046\n\nIs robotic repair a possible solution to improving wound complications in morbidly obese hernia patients?\n\nCameron Casson, MD; Sara Holden, MD; Jeffrey Blatnik, MD; Arnab Majumder, MD; Washington University in St. Louis\n\nIntroduction: Large, complex ventral hernias are frequently repaired via transversus abdominis release (TAR). Although first described as an open procedure, robotic TAR has become more prevalent with advances in minimally invasive surgical techniques. Obesity, particularly a BMI ≥ 40, is one of the strongest predictors of wound morbidity following open TAR. In this study, we aimed to determine if the robotic approach minimized wound morbidity in those with a BMI ≥ 40.\n\nMethods: A retrospective chart review of all patients with a BMI ≥ 40 who underwent an open or robotic TAR at a tertiary academic medical center from January 2018 to December 2021 was completed. Demographics, medical history, operative details, and post-operative outcomes were collected and analyzed.\n\nResults: In total, 42 patients with a BMI ≥ 40 underwent a TAR. Twenty-seven (64%) patients had open repair and 15 (36%) had robotic repair. BMI at time of surgery was similar between open and robotic groups (41.6 vs 42.1, p = 0.55). There was no significant difference in operative time between open and robotic approaches (297.2 vs 305.4 min, p = 0.71), although those patients who underwent an open repair had a larger hernia defect size (395 cm2 vs 141 cm2, p = 0.003). Those who underwent a robotic TAR had a significantly shorter hospital length of stay (1.8 vs 5.0 days, p = 0.0005), lower rate of surgical site occurrences (13.3% vs 48.1%, p = 0.02), and lower rate of surgical site infections (0.0% vs 25.9%, p = 0.03).\n\nConclusion: Although a BMI of 40 has been traditionally used as relative contraindication to elective repair of ventral hernias, primarily due to concern for wound morbidity, this may not be indicated if a robotic approach can be utilized. Patients with BMI ≥ 40 repaired robotically had faster recovery times and significantly fewer wound complications compared to their open counterparts. While not all patients are candidates for both repairs, if feasible, a robotic TAR offers a safe alternative to open repair with less wound morbidity. Further work on long-term outcomes, including recurrence rates, in these patients is needed.\n\nP047\n\nChange in intra-abdominal pressure following endoscopic component separation with laparoscopic mesh reconstruction for large midline incisional hernias\n\nDr.Meghna Purohit; Dr.Romesh Lal; Dr.Saurabh Borgharia; Lady Hardinge Medical College\n\nIntroduction: The repair of midline incisional hernia is a very challenging surgery associated with a number of complications one of the dangerous being intra-abdominal hypertension/abdominal compartment syndrome. The outcome has significantly improved with endoscopic component separation technique (ECST) and intra-peritoneal onlay mesh repair (IPOM +) surgery. We aimed to evaluate the change in Intra--abdominal Pressure (IAP) after ECST with IPOM plus for large (6 cm) midline incisional hernia.\n\nObjective: To assess the change in IAP immediately and 24 h after ECST with IPOM plus in patients with large ventral midline incisional hernia.\n\nMethods: The change in IAP was measured by intra-vesical pressure (IVP) measurement in the peri-operative period at 4 different point of times and by monitoring change in peak airway pressure intraoperatively.\n\nResults: Through prospective observational study carried out in 30 patients who were diagnosed with large midline incisional hernias, IVP measured had a pre-op Mean ± SD 9.43 ± 0.988 which increased to post-op IVP Mean ± SD 9.93 ± 1.02, with p value of 0.122 found to have a statistically insignificant increase. Intraoperatively another method used to measure IAP was Paw (peak airway pressure) measured just after induction and before the start of surgery had a Mean ± SD of 19.6 ± 1.22 vs immediately after surgery and before giving reversal had a Mean ± SD 19.53 ± 1.10 with p value of 0.753 whi,ch suggests a statistically insignificant result.\n\nConclusion: We observed insignificant change in the IVP and Paw, validating ECST with IPOM plus, a reliable method for tension-free closure of large midline incisional hernia.\n\nP048\n\nSu2ura Approximation Device—Case Study\n\nGil Ohana, MD1; Yoni Epstein, CEO2; 1Barzilai Medical Center; 2Anchora Medical\n\nIntroduction: This report describes a case presenting with 4 hernia defects, two of which located close to the ribs, which were sutured with the Su2ura® Approximation Device (AD), a newly developed instrument.\n\nThe patient is a 61-yo-male (BMI: 29.1), with a history of laparoscopic bilateral repair of inguinal and umbilical hernia repair and 3 laparoscopic gastric band procedures (placement, removal, and re-placement of the band), referred due to swelling in the surgical scars area (left upper abdominal wall).\n\nIncisional hernia or post-operative ventral hernia (POVH) develop at the site of a previous surgery. Up to one-third of patients who had abdominal surgery develops incisional hernia at the scar site. This type of hernia can occur anytime from months to years after abdominal surgery.\n\nSuturing of the defect during a laparoscopic procedure is challenging and requires skills earned over many repetitive procedures before making such surgery short and effective.\n\nThe Su2ura® AD was used in this first in-human trial to simplify the closing of the POVH. The safety and efficacy of this device during this procedure were assessed.\n\nMethods and Procedures: Two subcostal incisional hernias (size 1.5 cm each) were located 2 cm apart on the left abdomen. Two additional defects were observed left of the Linea Alba\n\nFig. 1 Defects locations\n\nAll defects contained omentum and preperitoneal fat. Multiple adhesions were observed around the defects and the gastric tube. Using diathermia, the peritoneum was incised and adhesions and preperitoneal fat were removed to expose the fascia surrounding the defects (Fig. 2).\n\nAll four defects were independently sutured and approximated using the Su2ura® AD, with 4 anchors for each defect (Fig. 3).\n\nFollowing approximation, meshes were used to cover the defects of the abdominal wall, fixated using tackers. Tackers could not be used to fixate the meshes over the ribs area, so surgical glue was used instead.\n\nResults: Suturing and approximation were effective using the Su2ura Approximation Device, as shown below in Fig. 3.\n\nAfter 6-week follow-up, the patient does not show any device-related adverse events, nor any hernia recurrence, clinical bulge, or seroma.\n\nFig. 2 Defects before suturing\n\nFig. 3 Defects after suturing\n\nConclusion: Suturing defects located on the ribs area is particularly challenging, given the anatomical limitations. The Su2ura® AD, a new automated suturing device, facilitated the approximation of these defects in this particular anatomical area quickly and effectively.\n\nP049\n\nSingle-center experience with robotic-assisted transversus abdominus release (r-TAR) and extended view totally extraperitoneal (eTEP) repairs\n\nIrina Karashchuk, BS; Shushmita M Ahmed, MD; Mason Kaneski, BS; Victoria Lyo, MD, MTM; Hazem Shamseddeen, MD; University of California, Davis\n\nIntroduction: While robotic-assisted transversus abdominus release (r-TAR) and extended view totally extraperitoneal (eTEP) repairs are becoming more prevalent for the management of ventral hernias, they are still new and evolving techniques without defined standard outcomes. Thus, our study aims to characterize early postoperative outcomes following r-TAR and eTEP at a single-academic institute.\n\nMethods: A retro"
