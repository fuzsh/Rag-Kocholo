        "text": "This project started off in December last year with a simple request. Balla Balla Community Centre in Cranbourne East was moving into new premises at Clyde North and was planning an open day in March to celebrate this move. The centre’s management had reached out to me to plan and organize an interactive art activity for the event to mark this occasion.\n\nBalla Balla Community Centre together with the Cultural Historical Association of Rodriguans and Mauritians (CHARM) has been a great support in my art career and I have had the privilege to work with them in several Australia Day events. The centre had not only facilitated these works but has been displaying them on its walls since their inception.\n\nAlthough, time-poor with my work commitments and frequent interstate travel, this was a request I could not turn down.\n\nThe Brief\n\nSince opening its doors in 2007, Balla Balla community centre had been providing various services to the local communities of Cranbourne and Clyde such as venue hire, information, photocopying, faxing, health and wellbeing programs, and arts & crafts workshops to name a few. The shifting of premises was triggered by the need to provide space for the construction of a new hospital being built in its original location.\n\nThe new location of Balla Balla community centre was the Selendra community hub building in North Clyde which was constructed in 2017 and was providing similar services to their local community.\n\nBalla Balla centre’s management wanted to use the open day to acknowledge their past and announce their presence and services to their new neighbourhood and build upon the existing clientele. They wanted the artwork to reflect this evolution and connect with the multicultural and diverse community in the region and in turn improve community access and participation.\n\nThe Work Begins\n\nWhile discussing the project, I came to know that the white wall that the proposed artwork was going to be hung used to be a feature wall that was initially painted black. Though the change of colour was driven by the need to give the space a clean and spacious feel. I envisage using this fact to establish a connection between the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ centre.\n\nAustralia is home to one of the world’s oldest continuing cultures. The Aboriginal people are traditional custodians of the land and have inhabited this land for more than 60,000 years. The colonization of the land by British Settlers in the 18th century changed the social demographics of the population and established a dominant culture based on Western European values.\n\nToday’s Australian society reflects the British penal history and subsequent waves of migrants from all over the world who have adopted their cultural roots to suit the new environment, climate, and resources of the country. The uniqueness of the land, its flora and fauna, and the generally egalitarian approach of the society have led to the development of a unique Australian vernacular with distinctive pronunciation and lexicon. I wanted to capture these salient features of our society to establish the overall context of the artwork.\n\nClyde North is one of the rapidly growing areas in the City of Casey and is a microcosm of the city’s general population trends. The mostly middle-class dwellers consist of people belonging to diverse ethnic backgrounds. Exploring and researching this theme further, I found out that nearly 280,000 people call the City of Casey home, and this population cohort represents people belonging to more than 150 cultures, speaking 140 languages with nearly 42% of them born overseas. The artwork needed to connect with this rich cultural heritage and showcase the uniqueness of various cultures and how they contribute to the overall richness of our society.\n\nPeople tend to have biases depending on their upbringing, religious beliefs, cultural backgrounds, ethical viewpoints, and linguistic interpretations. As humans, we are wired to fare the unknown and as a result, we tend to look at differences rather than the similarities that exist between us. I wanted the iconography of this artwork to focus on these commonalities and bring the viewer’s attention to the global nature of our community.\n\nFirst-generation migrants are typically nostalgic about their home countries as they evolve and adapt to their new environment. Therefore, one of the goals of the artwork I set for myself was to find a way to tap into and represent the uniqueness of various cultures and find a way to showcase how this richness fosters creativity, and innovation and contributes to society.\n\nThe Artwork\n\nWhether it’s the number of likes on our ‘socials’, or a photograph somewhere, we all love being acknowledged!\n\nThis zest for acknowledgment and display needs to be balanced with the concerns about identity fraud. To me, photographs taken with polaroid cameras provide a happy balance between these two requirements. These are clear enough to form a record and convey the artistic intent, but not sharp enough to raise privacy issues. I, therefore, decided to use Polaroids snaps as a tool to improve participation and community engagement.\n\nThe black background of the piece is intended to provide a historical perspective between the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ and bring out and enhance other visual components.\n\nA single continuous line outlining the globe and the word ‘Together’ is intended to simplify the key message of the piece and focus the attention of the viewer toward the global nature of the community we live in and the need for global connectivity.\n\nThe outer edges of the land boundaries have a band of multi-shade blue dots to signify the importance of water for our land and people and to create an illusion of sunlight glitter reflecting off the water’s surface.\n\nThe inner areas of the world map have patches of colorful cloth glued to the panel. This is not only intended to bring colour and texture to the artwork but also signifies the vibrant canvas of people from various backgrounds and walks of life that inhabit our globe. The use of similar cloth patterns along both sides of the ‘line’ is intended to bring focus on commonalities between the people.\n\nBoth the sides and the top of the panel are covered with images of typical Australian icons specific to Australia. The minimalistic representation of emblems associated with Australia and infills of words in indigenous languages and popular ‘Australian English’ slang are intended to provide a context for this artwork and signify the connection of the people with our land.\n\nMost countries have a collection of symbols that identify them as a nation and floral emblems, or State flowers have been used for this purpose for centuries. I have used this symbology to represent the different communities living in the City. The bottom band of the artwork showcases the national flowers of various countries from around the world, whose people now call the City of Casey home. The intent of this’ bouquet’ of flowers is to establish a connection between our diverse communities with their homeland and highlight how the uniqueness of each culture contributes to the overall richness of the society.\n\nThe Moors in Spain.\n\nThe term ‘Moor’ does not describe people of a particular ethnicity or race and was used by the Europeans of the Middle Ages and the early modern period to designate Spanish Muslims, Europeans of African descent, and others. However, the term was mostly used to describe Muslims in general.\n\nIn 711, North African Muslims led by the Tariq ibn-Ziyad, captured the Iberian Peninsula (modern day Spain and Portugal) and established the territory of Al-Andalus. For centuries to follow, these territories flourish and become the centre of education, the arts and sciences. However, the differences in religion and culture led to a centuries-long conflict between the Muslim Sultans with the Christian kingdoms of Europe, which culminated in 1492, when Catholic monarchs Ferdinand II and Isabella I won the Granada War and completed Spain’s reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nAlhambra\n\n‘Alhambra’ is the Spanish adaptation of the Arabic term ‘qa’lat al-Hamra’ which roughly translates to “red castle”, perhaps referring to the sun-dried rose-coloured bricks that were used to build the fortress. The city of Granada, where the castle is located is named after a Jewish settlement, Medina-al-Granata, or Pomegranate City, the fruit being symbol of righteousness, knowledge, and wisdom and is said to contain 613 seeds, each representing one of the 613 mitzvot (commandments) of the Torah.\n\nThough some form of fortification existed in this area since the 9th century, it was only after the arrival of Muhammad ben al Ahmar the first king of the Nasrid dynasty in the mid-thirteenth century that a royal residence was established in the Alhambra. This monument was not a project of a single ruler, 24 successive Sultans of the Nasrid dynasty contributed to it splendour, up until 1492 when the Emirate of Granada capitulate to the Catholic Reconquista.\n\nThe Palaces, Comares Palace, Palace of the Lions, and the Partal Palace were built by the Nasrid’s and the Charles V palace was built by King Charles after the fall of Alhambra. The Alhambra architecture is all-inclusive and features the Muslim, Christian, and Jewish faiths. It is this intermixing of styles, associated with centuries of multi-cultural and religious coexistence of people in Spain, that has made Alhambra so fascinating, mysterious, and architecturally iconic.\n\nThe palace walls are decorated with Arabic inscriptions, Koranic verses, and poems written in praise of the palace, touching upon the religious, poetic, and political world of the Nasrid’s period.\n\nExploring this feature further, Washington Irving quotes the story told by his Guide and writes “When the Moors held Granada, they were a gayer people than they are nowadays. They thought only of love, music, and poetry. They made stanzas upon every occasion and set them all to music. He who could make the best verses, and she who had the most tuneful voice, might be sure of favour and preferment. In those days, if anyone asked for bread, the reply was, make me a couplet; and the poorest beggar, if he begged in rhyme, would often be rewarded with a piece of gold.”\n\nThe designers of the Alhambra have covered each space (irrespective of its size), with decoration. Some of the building elements such as the interior arches are false arches, with no structural attributes; they are there only to decorate. Similarly, walls are covered with beautiful and extremely rich ceramics and (Stucco) plasterwork comprising of stylized vegetal forms, interlacing decoration, and the nets of rhombuses.\n\nThe painting is Leonardo’s Mono Lisa, and the museum is ‘The Louvre’ in Paris which is considered the largest and most visited art museum in the world.\n\nWhile the painting is recovered within two years as the perpetrator tries to offload his loot to a gallery for half a million lire. The theft and subsequent recovery of the painting causes a media frenzy which has made this painting one of the most recognized piece of art in the world. According to a conservative estimate (…remember beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder!), this single work of art is worth about US $800-$900 million today.\n\nThe Louvre\n\nWhen we were planning our overseas trip, I was adamant that we needed to visit the Louvre. Although the idea met with some resistance initially, ‘the powers-that-be’ eventually give-in to my wishes and we bought our online tickets for the exhibition. Note to would-be visitors, it is difficult, if not almost impossible to get the tickets on the day, you may have to wait in the queue for hours to get the tickets and then another few to get into the gallery.\n\nThe queue through the glass pyramid gate is long, as the visitors are ‘released’ every half hour. Nearly 15,000 visitors from all corners of the world, visit each day and sending people in batches is the only way to manage the crowd. My initial estimate was that we would need about 3 hours for the visit and was contemptuous of some American tourists whom I overheard saying ‘we should be able to cover this in an hour, tops an hour and a half at best’, and guess what, we were both wrong!\n\nWhile about 35,000 artworks are on display at any given time, most of its half-a-million-plus collection is locked up in storage. If one was to spend an average of 30 seconds to see each piece, one would need 291 hours to have a glimpse of it all! Maybe that’s the reason most of the nameplates are in French only; instead of being dual language (…museum authorities, take note this is a complaint, not a compliment!).\n\nCovering an area of 66,600 square meters, 4 main levels and more than 400 rooms, the Louvre is staffed by more than 2000 employees. In addition to the main exhibition in Paris, the museum also collaborates with other overseas art galleries and some of its treasures travel around the world to such varied destinations as Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, Iran’s National Museum, and the Louvre Abu Dhabi.\n\nSearching for Mona Lisa\n\nWe had been in the museum for nearly 4 hours, and we were getting tired, as we started to ‘glide’ through the never-ending rooms. Our sore legs and back started to take over and frankly, trying to decipher the French write-ups for the painting was not helping the cause. Our focus soon reverted to finding Mona Lisa. After all, visiting Louvre and not seeing the Mona Lisa would perhaps be classed as ‘criminal negligence’ in the tourist guidebooks.\n\nWe asked the security personnel and were directed towards ‘Salle des États’ the palace’s largest room. ‘Go to the first floor and then follow the crowds’ was the advice. In route to our destination, we passed through ‘Galerie d’Appollon’ which is the home of French royal jewels and hard stone vessels.\n\nHomer J Simpson\n\nHomer is the leading character of the show. Interestingly, Homer is not our typical hero, he has no supernatural powers like DC Comics characters such as Superman or Batman with bulging muscles and a cape. He is overweight, bald, lazy, generally incompetent, and often ignorant of the world around him. He is a blue-collar worker, with limited intelligence or training who has been given the seemingly ‘non-important’ job of a safety inspector in a nuclear power plant; and to top this off, he is negligent towards his duties. He loves his beer and doughnuts, and at home prefers being a couch potato senselessly watching television, eating snacks, and drinking Duff; his favorite beer. In a nutshell, if at all, Homer represents society’s idea of a Loser.\n\nOne wonders why then; we have fallen in love with this ‘anti-hero’ character and have been welcoming him in our lounges for nearly three decades and counting.\n\nMy quick inquiry with Dr. Google on ‘why do people love homer Simpsons character’; resulted in 2.2 million hits in less than half a second. If nothing else it proved that while this question may not be the most important question the world is thinking about, it is out there.\n\nHomer represents the ‘average’ person in us. Although far from an ideal husband (according to Marge, ‘loud, crude, and piggish’), he truly loves and respects his wife. He has demonstrated the virtues of a long-lasting relationship and while their relationship is challenged at times, he compromises and tries to stand by his wife and manages to pull through and retain his marriage even during hard times. He is always willing to work on his relationship and continued to find ways to rekindle his love for his wife.\n\nHe works ‘hard’ (although, this in most cases means taking a nap on his work desk at the nuclear plant) to put bread on the table for his family. Though occasionally he tries to strangle Bart, he is shown as a loving and caring father, who works hard toward fulfilling his children’s needs and whenever Bart, Lisa, or Maggie needs him he is there.\n\nHe is overweight but comfortable with his obesity and as a matter of fact, at times uses his fat to his advantage by absorbing a punch or two on his flabby body. Like some of us from generation X, he dislikes exercising, so much so that changing TV channels or answering the phone or the door is a choir for him. He is lazy and proud of it and embraces the idea that it’s a waste of time to exert effort, on one occasion advises his children “, “Kids, you tried your best, and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.”\n\nHomer loves food. The more unhealthy the food is, the more he likes it, his over-indulgence is followed by catchphrases such as “Mmm…..” , and extempore drooling. And who can forget his love for doughnuts, or he puts it “Donuts. Is there anything they can’t do”. He borders into a full-blown alcoholic and loves his beer and in one instance proudly acclaims “To alcohol, the cause of, and solution to, all of life’s problems.”\n\nHomer lives in a floating timeline and his character never ages (we wish!!). He rarely shaves and his tan stubble has remained consistent over the years. I am sure, a number of us who are blessed with facial hair would love to have this trait. He is happy with his limited wardrobe of a white shirt with an open collar and short sleeves, blue pants, and grey shoes (Suits, eat your heart out!).\n\nHomer adheres to no religion and only goes to church because his wife Marge forces him to attend. He does not exhibit any religious morality and frequently sleeps in church and refers to religion as “….the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life….”.\n\nHomer exhibits an eager mind that can retain a lot of knowledge in a short time frame. Like most of us, these short bursts of insight, creativity, and memory, are followed by much longer and more consistent periods of ignorance and stupidity. Homer is extremely confident about his knowledge and learning and similar to us; often, suffers from ‘I am right’ syndrome.\n\nHomer’s contribution to English.\n\nD’oh!. In 2001, the Oxford English dictionary which is widely considered as the leading authority on the English language added ‘D’oh’ to its list of more than 700,000 words. \"Doh\" is now defined as \"Expressing frustration at the realization that things have turned out badly or not as planned, or that one has just said or done something foolish,\"\n\nOutside the Library building in the centre of the third courtyard, we found a long queue of people that seemed to be moving at a snail’s pace. People from all over the world, Muslims, and non-Muslims flocked outside this ‘Has Oda’ or the chamber of the holy relics to view the most precious relics of the Islamic world. Note, only limited visitors are allowed to enter the chamber at a time, and women are required to cover their heads with a scarf before entering the chambers.\n\nThe Ottomans collected the Holy Relics attributed to the prophets from all over the empire and brought them to Istanbul for safekeeping. It is said that the Ottoman sultans wanted to keep the Holy Relics close to themselves because they thought that the location of the relics would qualify Istanbul as the centre of the Islamic world.\n\nEach of the relics is highly prized and has its own history/mythology and was collected over generations and kept inside mosques and ancient monasteries. Among this collection are the Holy Mantle, the bow, and the sword of the Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him). There are also holy relics attributed to other prophets such as the staff of Moses; the sword of David; the robe of Joseph; and the swords of the Prophet Muhammad’s companions.\n\nThe collection is housed in the Privy Chamber, where the sultan lived and kept his throne. It is said that, prior to their accession to the throne, the sultans would come to this room to pray and receive homage from the Privy Room officials before leaving for the ceremony. Even now, an imam inside a glassed-off chamber recites the Koran around the clock.\n\nThe Ritual\n\nBordered by five rivers, the northern part of the sub-continent has always been considered the food bowl for the region and it is little wonder that the most significant festivals have evolved around the arrival of the harvesting season. Though originating from different cultural and religious backgrounds, the festivals of Vasant Panchami , Jashn-e- Baharan and Basant, all celebrate the softening of weather, the departure of winter and the coming of spring, a time when the wheat crops are ready for harvest and when the mustard fields are yellow and in full bloom.\n\nVasant Panchami is the Hindu festival that highlights the coming of spring. In Sanskrit ‘Vasant’ means spring and ‘Panchami’ is the fifth day of the waxing moon in the Hindu calendar month of Magh (according to the Gregorian calendar this day falls somewhere in the months of February or March). The day is celebrated to venerate goddess Saraswati, who is considered as the symbol of wisdom, education and learning.\n\nJashn-e-Baharan is a pre-Islamic festival that marks the coming of spring season. The arrival of spring is an important event for the farmers and was welcomed with the celebration, hence the name ‘Jashn’ (celebration) ‘Baharan’(spring).\n\nThe story of ‘Basant’ is linked with Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, who is considered one of the most prominent Sufi saints in south–east Asia. Hazrat Nizamuddindid did not have any children of his own and therefore his nephew became the focus of all his paternal feelings. Unfortunately, the young boy died in his early teens. The Sufi saint was so aggrieved and depressed by the sudden and untimely death of his beloved nephew that he stopped talking and withdrew himself from all worldly affairs. His disciples were worried about his conditions and tried to reason with him and cheer him up but without success.\n\nLegend has it, that one of his disciples Amir Khusro, one day saw some young women dressed in yellow clothes adorned with garlands of marigold flowers going to their temple to celebrate spring festival with a lot of singing, fun and gaiety. Inspired by this event, Khusro’s dressed up as a woman in yellow ‘ghaagra choli’ (Indian skirt) and white striped ‘chunni’ (large scarf) and towards his master’s room with a number of other disciples and devotees who played and dance and sang ““Aaj Basant ManaaleySuhagan…Aaj Basant ManaaleySuhagan” a poem Amir Khusro composed for the occasion.\n\nSeeing this spectacle and knowing that it was Khusrowho was wearing the woman’s dress, singing and dancing, Hazrat Nizamuddin started smiling and the spell of gloom was lifted and the whole congregation started to rejoice. The saint came out of his depression, and ‘Basant’ together with song, dance, dress and other rituals got established as an annual festival in Delhi to mark this incident. From the Sufi perspective, Basant not only heralds the coming of spring but highlights the cyclic nature of life itself; the proverbial ‘doom and gloom’ of winter being followed by bright sunny days’ or the awakening and resurrection of life.\n\nThough the rites and rituals have evolved, Basant has been part of the sub-continents cultural fabric for over eight centuries. The relatively recent (16th century) addition to the celebration has been the inclusion of flying kites. Over the years, kite flying has taken prominence and now it is an intrinsic and arguably the most celebrated part of the festivities.\n\nKites in India\n\nHow and when the first kite took flight is not known, however the consensus is that kites were invented by the Chinese around two thousand years ago and eventually the sport of kite flying spread through traders from China to Korea, and across Asia to India.\n\nThe tradition of ‘Patang Baazi’ (kite flying) in India was started by the Mughals around 16th century as a pastime for the royalty; however, the sport gained popularity in the masses as the manufacturing of kites become common. Some Mughal miniature paintings even suggests that some enterprising young man of the time also used the kites to skillfully drop epistles to their lover who were restricted from meeting them in accordance with the social norms of the day.\n\nPaper, Bamboo sticks and Twine\n\nThe traditional kite design is based on a cross made of two thin bamboo sticks placed over each other and tied with thread. A special light weight paper is then pasted on top of this thin structure of the kite. This paper can be of one color or could have a multi-colored design. Typically, these patterns are created by pasting panels of different colored paper together in intricate designs which have evolved by the generations of kite makers. The twine used for kite flying is known as ‘dor’. At times the ‘dor’ is coated with a special paste made of ground glass powder and gum to provide a cutting edge and sharpness.\n\nAlthough the kites come in various shapes, the Rhombus shaped (Gudda, Guddi) and curvilinear shaped (Patang , Kup) kites are more popular. The author Pran Nevile in his book “Lahore: A Sentimental Journey”, writes “Made of colored paper and fine bamboo, our kites were as attractive as huge butterflies and almost as light. There was a large variety of colors, shapes and designs, with its own appellation. We had guddis, peris, guddas, Lucknow kats, patangs, teerahs, kups, etc. The guddis had a small paper tassel at the bottom while the male version, the gudda, had a patta, a triangle cut out of paper in place of the tassel.”\n\nThe narrative around the historical background is reinforced by different motifs on the art work. The top band depicts a typical marble floral inlay design and similarly the mosaic pattern at the back is inspired by geometric tiled pattern common of the period.\n\nThe bottom bands depict the elements of journey and travel. The silhouette images of the lower purple band depict a royal caravan with rows of elephants, horse and camels (journey) and the winding pattern on top is aimed at representing waves, travel and motion. The choice of colors for the bands was not only driven by the overall aesthetics of the piece but by using different colored zigzag lines my intention was also to universalize the welcome message to include all who have come to the country (ochre), by water/boats (aqua) and air/planes (light blue).\n\nWelcome, khush aamdeed, savaagat he\n\nThough over the years a lot of customs and traditions in the subcontinent have evolved or eroded away; fortunately, the customs around hospitality and honoring of guest is very much alive to this day. Travelers passing through the sub-continent cannot help but notice this fact. According to one traveler, “The countryside seems populated with people willing to drop everything to help an unknown foreigner find his destination or to serve him tea.”\n\nHospitality is valued by Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs alike. In Pakistani Islamic culture, the guest is considered a blessing from God, and in neighboring India the slogan “Atithi Devo Bhava” (guest is god) defines the importance of the guest for the host.\n\nFolks take great efforts to make sure that the guest are happy and provided for. Often the host will offer best dishes, sweets and fruits to their guest then they would consume themselves. In some countryside areas, a guest of one family is considered a guest of the whole street or village. Many restaurants owners and shopkeepers even refuse to take money from foreigners.\n\nThese cultural traits are evident in people even when they move away from their homeland and settled in other countries. Case in hand, while I was busy painting the pole, a Sikh gentleman who owns a shop in the area became a silent admirer of my work and offered to provide me chai and soft drink and refuse to take money when offered.\n\nI have tried to highlight this cultural trait in the pole artwork by writing ‘welcome’ in several regional and international languages. The initial plan was to cover all 23 regional languages spoken in the region but unfortunately my patience with Dr Google and the time run out and I settled with covering a dozen languages only.\n\nEpilogue\n\nThis commissioned public art is part of Stage 2 of the Indian Cultural Precinct revitalization works that have been sponsored by the City of Greater Dandenong and is aimed at enlivening the streetscape and showcase the color and vibrancy of the culture of sub-continent. I hope the people will appreciate and enjoy this piece as long as it last not only for its aesthetics but also the message it aims to convey.\n\nThis post is not intended to be a travelogue per se; the intent is to record some experiences and insights during and after my travels and more importantly to acknowledge some of the beautiful people and personalities that I met and grew friendships with along the way.\n\nIt has been a long and uneventful flight. I had spent the 24 hours of flight time ‘wisely’ between sleeping, in-flight entertainment and flight meals; however, my attempts to go over the recommended reading materials again prior to landing in Morocco had been largely unsuccessful. Before this journey I had not met the organizer or the other fellow artist selected for this tour; and as the plane circled around Muhammad V airport, Casablanca, I was overwhelmed with mixed emotions of diffidence and excitement of what lay ahead for me.\n\nMy ‘Rekindling Tour’ journey started back in January 2018, with an email out of nowhere from someone who I hardly knew. A curator and an academic from Perth who studied Islamic art was putting together a grant to take a small number of artists to Morocco for training in Islamic arts and wanted to know if I was interested. She had come across my work done for SalamFest through the grapevine of social media and thought that I fulfilled the requirements for the grant.\n\nThrilled, honored and deeply humbled by this chance occurrence, I promptly conceded.\n\nHamida Novakovich who is an independent curator, writer and academic was the driving force behind the Rekindling: An Australian Artisans Tour of Morocco project. She and her team (Professor Samina Yasmeen & Azim Zahir) at The Center for Muslim States and Societies (CMSS), University of Western Australia, initiated this project with an aim to establish ongoing links between emerging Australian artists and Masters of Islamic Art in Morocco. The intent of the project was to provide Australian artists an opportunity to visit and train under Master Artisans, to learn new skills in traditional Islamic arts and,upon their return, disseminate the acquired knowledge to the community through innovative community art projects.The tour was funded by The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Council for Australian Arab Relations. The grant applications and processing, selection of Australian artist, coordination of flights and accommodation in Morocco and more importantly planning and coordination of activities with local masters were all done through CMSS. The challenges involved in coordinating artist from different states, art experiences and backgrounds and developing a program that fits all requirements and expectations cannot be understated and the Rekindling Tour organizing committee deserves high praise for putting together such a remarkable program.\n\nThe artist selected for the tour came from three different states. Tusif Ahmed and Osama Mah joined us from Perth (WA), Niccy Pallant from Adelaide (SA) and Zahrah Habibullah, Majdi Faleh and I were from Melbourne (VIC).\n\nOur artistic and professional backgrounds were equally varied. Tausif has a software development and jewellery design background and is a paper cutting artist par excellence. Osama has a digital graphic design and animation background; he is a philosopher, practicing calligraphist and a digital artist. Niccy has an arts education and teaching background; she is a print maker and a visual artist and also conducts workshops in sacred geometry and leather embossing. Zahrah is a professional photographer and artist, specializing in jewellery design and metal works. Majdi recently obtained his PhD in architecture focusing on Islamic design and practices geometric art, and I have a mechanical engineering background and dabble in visual and community arts.\n\nMy first memories of this city are intertwined with the clattering sound of suitcase wheels on the cobbled stone streets of medina as the group dragged our luggage from Blue Gate (‘Bab Boujlood’) via narrow winding streets to the multilevel house; the ‘Dar ’that was to be our residence in Fez.Our hotel ‘Dar Arsama’; was managed by a Spanish visual artist- Violeta Caldres and her Moroccan, handyman husband - Adil. Violeta and Adil had painstakingly restored an old house over four years to convert it to a residential hotel. Beautifully decorated and immaculately maintained with examples of traditional Moroccan tile designs and furnishings, in addition to Violeta’s own contemporary works on the walls, the house give a surreal feel.\n\nAppearances can be deceiving, and I believe in no place is this statement truer then in Morocco’s medinas. Chaotic or maze like from a ‘western’ viewpoint for urban planning, the medina’s were designed to provide a sustainable space keeping in mind the ideals for the short and long term well being of the community. The city’s compact and dense fabric of housing, streets, thoroughfares and open spaces allowed people to practice their trade and live in the city without being exposed to physical and human harm.\n\nOur first workshop was at Craft Draft studios with Hamza El Fasiki. Hamza is a social entrepreneur, musician, author and an academic. He took over his family craft business from his father; who is a master craftsman and chair of the guild and founded Craft Draft studios with an aim to restore people’s connections to the traditional crafts. The studio provides an opportunity to learn and share the traditional arts by inviting both locals and foreigners to become apprentices and experience firsthand the traditional tools and techniques used by the artisans.\n\nThe great Muslim philosopher Imam Al-Ghazali stated “Four traits lift a person to the highest ranks, even if their works and knowledge are little: forbearance, humility, generosity, and good character”.\n\nThe traditional artisan journey from apprentice to the master, instil these principles. Children as young as 6 or 7 years old would join the crafts workshop as apprentices. For the first 2 years they would only observe their Master’s work, then gradually be taught to hold tools and learn simple menial task and then actually introduced to the creative crafts. It took up to 10-12 years of learning to replicate the designs and another few to become a certified Master (maâlem) craftsman recognized by the Guild. This learning process was designed to develop apprentice skills as well as the inner self (Nafs). The aim was to develop humility and character in the students as they venture forward in life to become master craftsmen and contributing members of the society.\n\nEpilogue\n\nOur formal exploits of the Rekindling tour ended in Essaouira as some of us headed back while others stuck around to explore the country further. Reading through my scribbles and notes it is very difficult to catalog each and every experience and occurrence, as they have been so many.\n\nBeing able to interact with ‘Master’ craftsmen and artists and being able to work and sit with them in their studios was enriching on a number of levels. Understanding the art journey of a traditional craft person from a student to becoming a master was humbling and thought provoking.\n\nAs we collected around the evenings, we work-shopped various aspects of Islamic arts, shared experiences and our own personal art journeys with our contemporaries. Getting to know fellow artist and sharing their respective art journeys was enriching and provided opportunities to learn from each other’s experiences.\n\nBeing able to soak in an environment so filled with art (albeit for a short time) has been a privilege and it is difficult to describe and predict what the future impact of this tour will be on my art. I am sure as my fellow artists and I move on with our respective art journeys, what we have learnt and observed will be reflected in our works."
