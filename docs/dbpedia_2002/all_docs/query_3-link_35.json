The proposed approach outperforms current methods for predicting water content based on soil-water physics or purely on data-driven strategies. Initially, a Markov chain-based model is employed to estimate soil water content. The uncertainty associated with the model-based estimation is then quantified by applying ML algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and feedforward neural network (FNN), to the soil water content data obtained from the Kansas mesoscale network (Mesonet). This quantified uncertainty reveals the complex soil water content dynamics that analytical Markov chain-based models cannot capture. The term physics-informed ML (PIML) refers to integrating soil-water physics principles with the predictive capabilities of data-driven models. Furthermore, multiple Mesonet time series datasets are utilized to assess the influence of physics-based knowledge on ML predictions. The evaluation of the proposed PIML models demonstrates significant improvements in predicting soil water content.\n\n10:03-10:06, Paper WeA01.2 Add to My Program Transfer Learning for Dynamical Systems Models Via Autoencoders and GANs Damiani, AngeloGran Sasso Science Institute Viera LÃ³pez, GustavoGran Sasso Science Institute Manganini, GiorgioGran Sasso Science Institute Metelli, Alberto MariaPolitecnico Di Milano Restelli, MarcelloPolitecnico Di Milano\n\nKeywords: Machine learning\n\nAbstract: Transfer learning has seen significant progress in the domains of supervised learning and reinforcement learning, yet there remains a noticeable gap in the area of regression. In supervised learning, various transfer learning methods have been developed to leverage knowledge from one task to improve performance on another, but these approaches are primarily designed for classification tasks. In the realm of reinforcement learning, many techniques focus on policy transfer, and those that do address samples transfer predominantly apply it within homogeneous contexts. This paper presents a novel algorithm that bridges the transfer learning gap between supervised learning and reinforcement learning while specifically addressing the regression problem of dynamical systems' model estimation. Our approach harnesses the feature extraction capabilities of autoencoders and the generative power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to train a mapping that facilitates the seamless transformation of samples between dynamical systems. This approach represents a significant advancement in the field of transfer learning, as it offers a versatile and effective solution for transferring regression models across heterogeneous domains. Our experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy and its potential to improve model generalization and adaptability in diverse scenarios with varying data distributions and dynamics.\n\n10:06-10:09, Paper WeA01.3 Add to My Program Concurrent Learning and Lyapunov-Based Updates of Deep Neural Networks for Euler-Lagrange Dynamic Systems Basyal, SujataAuburn University Ting, JonathanAuburn University Mishra, KislayaAuburn University Allen, Brendon C.Auburn University\n\nKeywords: Machine learning, Lyapunov methods, Nonlinear systems identification\n\nAbstract: This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)- and concurrent learning (CL)-based adaptive control architecture for an Euler-Lagrange dynamic system that guarantees system performance for the first time. The developed controller includes two DNNs with the same output-layer weights to ensure feasibility of the control system. In this work, a Lyapunov-and CL-based update law is developed to update the output-layer DNN weights in real-time; whereas, the inner-layer DNN weights are updated offline using data that is collected in real-time. A Lyapunov-like analysis is performed to prove that the proposed controller yields semi-global exponential convergence to an ultimate bound for the output-layer weight estimation errors and for the trajectory tracking errors.\n\n10:09-10:12, Paper WeA01.4 Add to My Program Model Free Difference Feedback Control of Stochastic Systems Zaheer, Muhammad HamadUniversity of New Hampshire Yoon, Se Young (Pablo)University of New Hampshire\n\nKeywords: Machine learning, Adaptive control, Stochastic optimal control\n\nAbstract: This paper presents a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for the output-difference feedback control (ODFC) of stochastic systems with measurement and process noise. A policy iteration algorithm is presented using a quadratic output-difference reward function to learn the optimal ODFC from noisy output difference measurements. It is proved that the proposed method trains stable dynamic control laws that approach the analytical optimal solution, even in the presence of process and measurement noise. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.\n\n10:12-10:15, Paper WeA01.5 Add to My Program Control-Based Graph Embeddings with Data Augmentation for Contrastive Learning Ahmad, Obaid UllahUniversity of Texas at Dallas Said, AnwarVanderbilt University Shabbir, MudassirInformation Technology University Koutsoukos, XenofonVanderbilt University Abbas, WaseemUniversity of Texas at Dallas\n\nKeywords: Machine learning, Network analysis and control, Emerging control applications\n\nAbstract: In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised graph representation learning by harnessing the control properties of dynamical networks defined on graphs. Our approach introduces a novel framework for contrastive learning, a widely prevalent technique for unsupervised representation learning. A crucial step in contrastive learning is the creation of `augmented' graphs from the input graphs. Though different from the original graphs, these augmented graphs retain the original graph's structural characteristics. Here, we propose a unique method for generating these augmented graphs by leveraging the control properties of networks. The core concept revolves around perturbing the original graph to create a new one while preserving the controllability properties specific to networks and graphs. Compared to the existing methods, we demonstrate that this innovative approach enhances the effectiveness of contrastive learning frameworks, leading to superior results regarding the accuracy of the classification tasks. The key innovation lies in our ability to decode the network structure using these control properties, opening new avenues for unsupervised graph representation learning.\n\n10:15-10:18, Paper WeA01.6 Add to My Program Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Swarm Systems with Reward Machines Meshkat Alsadat, ShayanArizona State University Baharisangari, NasimArizona State University Paliwal, YashArizona State University Xu, ZheArizona State University\n\nKeywords: Machine learning, Formal verification/synthesis, Agents-based systems\n\nAbstract: We introduce a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for swarm systems where reward machines (a type of Mealy machines) are used to encode the non-Markovian reward functions. We use the generalized moments (GMs) to characterize swarm features. Each agent estimates the GM of the swarm state and uses it to estimate the state of the reward machine. The agent then uses the estimated state of the reward machine to update its q-values. We use the gossip algorithm for communication between the agents. Agents exploit this communication to update their estimated GM of the swarm state, which leads to an update of their estimated state of the reward machine. We derive an upper bound for the error between the estimate GM of the swarm state and the ground truth GM of the swarm state, and using that upper bound; we prove the convergence of our proposed algorithm, swarm q-learning with reward machines (Swarm-QRM). To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, we present two case studies wherein, for Case Study 1, a swarm of agents will perform a pickup and delivery task, and in Case Study 2, the swarm of agents will conduct a search and rescue task. We also show that Swarm-QRM outperforms the baselines, q-learning in augmented state space (QAS) and Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN).\n\n10:18-10:21, Paper WeA01.7 Add to My Program Integrating Machine Learning in Process Control with LSTMc: A Case Study in Batch Crystallization Sitapure, NiranjanTexas A&M University Kwon, JosephTexas A&M University\n\nKeywords: Adaptive control, Computer-aided control design, Manufacturing systems\n\nAbstract: Over the past three decades, the primary methods for managing complex chemical processes have predominantly relied on PI/PID controllers and model predictive controllers (MPCs). Despite their advancements, both approaches have limitations. PI/PID controllers require specific tuning for each scenario, while MPCs are computationally intensive. To address these challenges, we introduce the LSTM-controller (LSTMc), which is a model-independent, data-driven framework that leverages the robust time-series prediction capabilities of LSTM networks. The LSTMc predicts future control inputs by analyzing the evolution of the system's state and error dynamics, taking into account both the current and previous time steps. Our experiments, particularly in dextrose batch crystallization, have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach. Impressively, the LSTMc achieves a set-point deviation of less than 2% in 10+ case studies we tested. These results position the LSTMc as a promising alternative for process control, as it adeptly adapts to changing process conditions and set-points, and offers efficient computation for optimal control inputs.\n\n10:21-10:24, Paper WeA01.8 Add to My Program Learning-Based Model Predictive Control of an Ammonia Synthesis Reactor Oliveira Cabral, ThiagoKansas State University Bagheri, AmirsalarKansas State University Babaei Pourkargar, DavoodKansas State University\n\nKeywords: Chemical process control, Machine learning, Predictive control for nonlinear systems\n\nAbstract: We investigate the application of state-of-the-art recurrent machine learning methods to tackle the computational challenges associated with the real-time solvability of a packed-bed ammonia synthesis reactor model for optimal control design. A high-fidelity multi-physics model is developed for the ammonia reactor by integrating reaction kinetics and complex transport phenomena. The model involves a system of interconnected algebraic, ordinary, and partial differential equations, providing a deeper understanding and improved prediction accuracy of pressure, temperature, and species concentration dynamics. However, due to its computational complexity, the resulting model is unsuitable for optimal control applications such as model predictive control (MPC). To overcome this limitation, we create a reduced-order model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) using time series data generated from offline simulations of process outputs. This surrogate model effectively captures the systemÂs nonlinear dynamics, enabling the successful implementation of MPC and achieving optimal closed-loop performance.\n\n10:24-10:27, Paper WeA01.9 Add to My Program Explainable Optimal Solutions Using Fuzzy Inference Deneke, Tewodros LemmaUniversity of Texas at Austin Dunia, RicardoThe University of Texas at Austin Baldea, MichaelThe University of Texas at Austin\n\nKeywords: Fuzzy systems, Optimization, Machine learning\n\nAbstract: Optimization-based decision-making in practical settings often produces solutions that are counter-intuitive to operators and human decision makers. In this paper, we propose an approach for explaining optimization results. A fuzzy inference model based on a set of observations generated by solving an optimization problem is developed, and the logical rules are used to explain the optimization results. The proposed approach is demonstrated using a realistic example of the unit commitment problem.\n\n10:27-10:30, Paper WeA01.10 Add to My Program Solving Two-Player General-Sum Game between Swarms Ghimire, MukeshArizona State University Zhang, LeiArizona State University Zhang, WenlongArizona State University Ren, YiArizona State University Xu, ZheArizona State University\n\nKeywords: Game theory, Machine learning\n\nAbstract: Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) PDEs are the governing equations for the two-player general-sum games. Unlike Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, which are data-intensive methods for learning value function, learning HJ PDEs provide a guaranteed convergence to the Nash Equilibrium value of the game when it exists. However, a caveat is that solving HJ PDEs becomes intractable when the state dimension increases. To circumvent the curse of dimensionality (CoD), physics-informed machine learning methods with supervision can be used and have been shown to be effective in generating equilibrial policies in two-player general-sum games. In this work, we extend the existing work on agent-level two-player games to a two-player swarm-level game, where two sub-swarms play a general-sum game. We consider the Kolmogorov forward equation as the dynamic model for the evolution of the densities of the swarms. Results show that policies generated from the physics-informed neural network (PINN) result in a higher payoff than a Nash Deep Q-Network (Nash DQN) agent and have comparable performance with numerical solvers.\n\n10:30-10:33, Paper WeA01.11 Add to My Program Empowering Hybrid Models with Attention-Based Time-Series Transformers: A Case Study in Batch Crystallization Sitapure, NiranjanTexas A&M University Kwon, JosephTexas A&M University\n\nKeywords: Grey-box modeling, Machine learning, Neural networks\n\nAbstract: Due to safety concerns, direct implementation of black-box tools for fully data-driven deep-neural-network (DNN) digital twins faces challenges. To overcome this, hybrid models that combine physics-based first principles (FP) with machine learning (ML) have gained popularity, seen as a `best of both worlds' solution. However, current simple DNN models struggle to predict long-term process data evolution. Recently, time-series transformers (TSTs) using multi-headed attention mechanisms have shown excellent predictive performance for a wide array of time-series prediction tasks. To this end, a novel TST-based hybrid modeling framework for batch crystallization was developed, offering enhanced accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional black-box models. Specifically, the developed TST-based hybrid model allows online estimation of instantaneous growth and nucleation rate (i.e., mathbf{G}&mathbf{B}) for any arbitrarily chosen operating condition in batch crystallization of dextrose. The estimated mathbf{G}&mathbf{B} values can then be directly fed to an FP crystallization model to generate the evolution of crystal size distribution (CSD) and other system states. Moreover, the developed TST-based hybrid model achieved a normalized mean square error in the range of [10, 50]times10^{-4} and an R^2 value exceeding 0.99 for predicting system states. Moreover, the proposed TST-based hybrid model utilizes powerful attention mechanisms to (a) under short and long-term contextual information, and (b) seamlessly learn the functional dependence of system states, thereby setting the foundation stones for next-generation attention-powered hybrid models.\n\n10:33-10:36, Paper WeA01.12 Add to My Program An Example of Synthetic Data Generation for Control Systems Using Generative Adversarial Networks: Zermelo Minimum-Time Navigation Bapat, NachiketWorcester Polytechnic Institute Paffenroth, Randy C.Worcester Polytechnic Institute Cowlagi, Raghvendra V.Worcester Polytechnic Institute\n\nKeywords: Grey-box modeling, Simulation, Machine learning\n\nAbstract: Real-world data of the operation of control systems is often scarce because experiments are expensive and time-consuming. We address the problem of synthetic data generation, namely, the problem of generating data about the operation of a physical system through computational means. In this paper, we report generative adversarial network (GAN) models that can incorporate training data and governing equations underlying the operation of a control system. Instead of over-generalization, we restrict the discussion to the particular example, namely, the Zermelo navigation problem of a vehicle navigating a drift field (e.g., wind) in minimum time. Owing to the nature of the example chosen, we find algebraic governing equations. We propose GAN models that learn to generate trajectories that not only resemble the training data but also satisfy these governing equations. We compare the proposed models to a standard GAN model that uses training data, only, i.e., neglects the governing equations, to demonstrate that the proposed models outperform the standard model on several metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on generative models for control systems.\n\n10:36-10:39, Paper WeA01.13 Add to My Program Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Model Predictive Control with Probabilistic Control Barrier Function Shen, XunOsaka University Wachi, AkifumiLINE Corporation Hashimoto, WataruOsaka University Hashimoto, KazumuneOsaka University Takai, ShigemasaOsaka Univ\n\nKeywords: Learning, Markov processes, Machine learning\n\nAbstract: Practical applications of reinforcement learning (RL) often demand that the agents explore safety by satisfying designed constraints. The constraints for safety cannot be satisfied with probability 1 when an unbounded stochastic uncertainty is present. One way is to relax the hard constraints into chance constraints and to consider safe RL with chance constraints. This paper addresses safe RL with chance constraints by Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Probabilistic Control Barrier Function (PCBF). MPC with PCBF is used as a function approximator to deliver the policy that satisfies the demanded chance constraints. RL is used to optimize the parameters in MPC with PCBF to improve the closed performance. We prove that using PCBF as a constraint in MPC ensures the safety imposed by the chance constraints. A scenario-based algorithm is designed for the proposed safe RL implementation. A quadrotor system control problem in turbulent conditions has been used as a numerical example to validate the proposed safe RL method.\n\n10:39-10:42, Paper WeA01.14 Add to My Program Min-Max Optimization under Delays Adibi, ArmanPrinceton University Mitra, AritraNorth Carolina State University Hassani, HamedUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nKeywords: Optimization, Optimization algorithms, Machine learning\n\nAbstract: Delays and asynchrony are inevitable in large-scale machine-learning problems where communication plays a key role. As such, several works have extensively analyzed stochastic optimization with delayed gradients. However, as far as we are aware, no analogous theory is available for min-max optimization, a topic that has gained recent popularity due to applications in adversarial robustness, game theory, and reinforcement learning. Motivated by this gap, we examine the performance of standard min-max optimization algorithms with delayed gradient updates. First, we show (empirically) that even small delays can cause prominent algorithms like Extra-gradient (texttt{EG}) to diverge on simple instances for which texttt{EG} guarantees convergence in the absence of delays. Our empirical study thus suggests the need for a careful analysis of delayed versions of min-max optimization algorithms. Accordingly, under suitable technical assumptions, we prove that Gradient Descent-Ascent (texttt{GDA}) and texttt{EG} with delayed updates continue to guarantee convergence to saddle points for convex-concave and strongly convex-strongly concave settings. Our complexity bounds reveal, in a transparent manner, the slow-down in convergence caused by delays.\n\n10:42-10:45, Paper WeA01.15 Add to My Program Developing an Efficient Model for a SOFC System Using Self-Supervised Convolutional Autoencoder and Stateful LSTM Network Tofigh, MohamadaliUniversity of Alberta Salehi, ZeynabUniversity of Alberta Smith, DanielCummins Ali, KharazmiCummins Inc Amir, Hanifi YazdiUniversity of Alberta Koch, Charles RobertUniversity of Alberta Shahbakhti, MahdiUniversity of Alberta\n\nKeywords: Neural networks, Identification for control, Machine learning\n\nAbstract: The development of an efficient dynamic model for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems is essential for control strategies, process optimization, and fault diagnostics - key steps toward maximizing power generation and extending their lifetime. Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM), a potent type of recurrent neural network, has proven to be adept at modeling intricate physical dynamic systems using extensive input-output data. They are particularly well-suited for capturing long-range dependencies and temporal patterns. Nevertheless, due to memory and computing constraints in practice, training an LSTM network to effectively learn long-term dependency is challenging, which stems from the sequential processing nature of LSTMs. In this study, a self-supervised convolutional autoencoder (AE) is developed to learn a concise yet informative temporal representation of historical input data. These compressed hidden sequences are then input into an LSTM model, which is trained using a truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) algorithm. Once trained, an identical stateful LSTM model is reconstructed using the learned parameters, enabling the LSTM to predict the voltage using only the most recent past input data, rather than a sequence of data over which the model was trained. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated utilizing diverse experimental data collected from a lab-scale SOFC. The results indicate while the model properly identifies the underlying dynamics of the SOFC, it significantly reduces the training and runtime prediction computation costs of a traditional LSTM model by 38% and 42% respectively. This enhancement holds promise for improving real-time control and diagnostics of SOFC systems, ultimately contributing to their improved performance and reliability.\n\n10:45-10:48, Paper WeA01.16 Add to My Program Data-Driven Nonlinear System Identification of a Throttle Valve Using Koopman Representation Bongiovanni, NicolasUniversitÃ© CÃ´te dÂAzur, CNRS, I3S Mavkov, BojanUniversitÃ© CÃ´te D'Azur Martins, RenatoUniversitÃ© De Bourgogne Allibert, GuillaumeUniv Cote d'Azur, CNRS, I3S\n\nKeywords: Identification for control, Nonlinear systems identification, Machine learning\n\nAbstract: Electrical Throttle Bodies (ETBs) are massively used in the automotive industry and their modeling and control are challenging because of their high nonlinearity and stochasticity. In this paper, we present a data-driven method grounded on the Koopman operator for the identification of a real ETB valve. The model obtained is control-oriented and represented in a quasi-linear-parameter varying framework. Different experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, including the comparison with two classical nonlinear system identification methods.\n\n10:48-10:51, Paper WeA01.17 Add to My Program An Effective Hyperparameter Tuning Method for Ising Machines in Practical Use Kakuko, NorihiroFujitsu LTD Parizy, MatthieuFujitsu LTD\n\nKeywords: Optimization, Optimization algorithms, Machine learning\n\nAbstract: In this paper, we propose novel Ising machines hyperparameter tuning techniques for practical use when handling multiple combinatorial problem instances in a short period of time. Firstly, we confirm the performance of a well-known hyperparameter tuning technique, Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE), when targeting a single input instance within a long period of time. Secondly, we propose an efficient method consisting of a generic hyperparameter tuning and a short-time specialized hyperparameter tuning for multiple instances. Since the generic hyperparameter tuning to cover a wide range of instances in a certain category is done in advance, taking time for it is acceptable. The specialized hyperparameter tuning targeting a tuning time of several minutes, reflecting practical use, runs when the performance of a generic hyperparameter set is below expectations. Thirdly, we compare the proposed method to the TPE based tuning to show its effectiveness. For experiments, well-known Travel Salesman Problem (TSP) and Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) instances are used as input. The Ising machine used is FujitsuÂs third generation Digital Annealer (DA). Results show that the generic hyperparameter tuning outperforms the TPE based tuning by 2 times in GAP, which indicates the quality of the solution, and the specialized hyperparameter sets have 1.4 times better performance than the generic ones in GAP.\n\n10:51-10:54, Paper WeA01.18 Add to My Program Data-Efficient Uncertainty-Guided Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Unscented Kalman Bayesian Neural Networks Wu, XinyangFraunhofer IPA Wedernikow, ElisabethFraunhofer IPA Huber, MarcoUniversity of Stuttgart\n\nKeywords: Predictive control for nonlinear systems, Kalman filtering, Machine learning\n\nAbstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has made substantial progress by providing feasible solutions to many planning and control problems. However, the majority of RL algorithms, particularly model-free RL, suffer from low learning efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes the utilization of the Kalman Bayesian neural network (KBNN) to learn a tractable dynamics model of a system from data that captures uncertainties of the system state. Additionally, we employ the unscented Kalman filter to propagate these uncertainties over the control horizon, and we exploit the propagated uncertainties explicitly in the cost function. This approach presents a novel solution to improve data-efficiency in RL. This is validated on classic control problems in a comparative analysis against state-of-the-art methods.\n\n10:54-10:57, Paper WeA01.19 Add to My Program Fast Long-Term Multi-Scenario Prediction for Maneuver Planning at Unsignalized Intersections Mertens, Max BastianUlm University Ruof, JonaUlm University Strohbeck, JanUlm University Buchholz, MichaelUniversitÃ¤t Ulm\n\nKeywords: Multivehicle systems, Modeling, Machine learning\n\nAbstract: Motion prediction for intelligent vehicles typically focuses on estimating the most probable future evolutions of a traffic scenario. Estimating the gap acceptance, i.e., whether a vehicle merges or crosses before another vehicle with the right of way, is often handled implicitly in the prediction. However, an infrastructure-based maneuver planning can assign artificial priorities between cooperative vehicles, so it needs to evaluate many more potential scenarios. Additionally, the prediction horizon has to be long enough to assess the impact of a maneuver. We, therefore, present a novel long-term prediction approach handling the gap acceptance estimation and the velocity prediction in two separate stages. Thereby, the behavior of regular vehicles as well as priority assignments of cooperative vehicles can be considered. We train both stages on real-world traffic observations to achieve realistic prediction results. Our method has a competitive accuracy and is fast enough to predict a multitude of scenarios in a short time, making it suitable to be used in a maneuver planning framework.\n\nWeA02 RI Session, Harbour Add to My Program RI: Network and Multi-Agent Systems Chair: Kumar, GautamSan Jose State University Co-Chair: Yuan, YukunUniversity of Tennessee at Chattanooga 10:00-10:03, Paper WeA02.1 Add to My Program A Model of Chaperone Competition in Bacterial Gene Regulatory Networks Nolan, NicholasMassachusetts Institute of Technology Laub, MichaelMassachusetts Institute of Technology Del Vecchio, DomitillaMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nKeywords: Biomolecular systems, Systems biology, Cellular dynamics\n\nAbstract: Chaperones are a global resource within cellular biomolecular systems, ensuring that proteins are properly folded and preventing that aggregation leads to cell death. Introducing genetic circuits to a cell may place a load on these folding resources, resulting in unintended coupling between otherwise independent circuits' behavior. Previous analyses have considered loading effects on other cellular resources --- such as gene expression resources --- but have not included chaperone-enabled folding. In this paper, we model two chaperone modalities, encapsulating two important classes of chaperones as well as their potential interactions. We identify distinct responses that arise from the different architectures which can be either competitive or activating. This work indicates that native cellular chaperones may have built-in control architectures to mitigate loading by an increased demand from chaperone-reliant proteins.\n\n10:03-10:06, Paper WeA02.2 Add to My Program Opinion-Based Task Allocation Strategy for Mobile Sensor Networks Zhang, ZiqiaoGeorgia Institute of Technology Wu, WencenSan Jose State University Zhang, FuminGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\nKeywords: Sensor networks, Agents-based systems, Networked control systems\n\nAbstract: In this paper, we propose an opinion-based task allocation strategy for mobile sensor networks to conduct simultaneous multi-source tracking while doing measurement collection and information estimation. Mobile sensors form opinions of the field based on the information obtained by sensors, and opinion dynamics describe how sensors communicate with each other and generate decisions on task assignments for multi-source tracking. Triggering conditions of running opinion dynamics for task allocation are also provided, determining when it is necessary to divide sensors into groups. Simulation results with a 12-sensor network tracking two different sources validate the proposed opinion-based task allocation strategy.\n\n10:06-10:09, Paper WeA02.3 Add to My Program Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy Management in Grid-Responsive Networked Greenhouses Ajagekar, AkshayCornell University Decardi-Nelson, BenjaminUniversity of Alberta You, FengqiCornell University\n\nKeywords: Control applications, Process Control, Chemical process control\n\nAbstract: Greenhouses play a pivotal role in achieving food security and paving the way for sustainable urban agriculture. Yet, to optimize crop growth, they demand substantial energy, mainly for climate control and artificial lighting. Given this energy-intensive nature, greenhouses are prime candidates for demand response programs, enhancing the power gridÂs flexibility and resilience in urban areas. In this study, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to manage energy in interconnected renewable energy integrated greenhouses. The framework addresses the challenges of fluctuating on-site renewable energy outputs, and interaction with a dynamic electricity tariff grid. Our multi-agent DRL strategy employs an actor-critic algorithm infused with a shared attention mechanism to ensure scalability and performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using a New York City (NYC) case study with a network of five greenhouses in each borough. We also compare the performance of our multi-agent DRL method to that of the rule-based and the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms.\n\n10:09-10:12, Paper WeA02.4 Add to My Program Optimization-Based Countering of Misinformation on Social Networks Bayiz, Yigit EgeThe University of Texas at Austin Topcu, UfukThe University of Texas at Austin\n\nKeywords: Control of networks, Network analysis and control, Large-scale systems\n\nAbstract: False information is prevalent on social media platforms, necessitating effective countering methods to combat its spread. We propose an algorithm that reduces the false information spread while preserving the spread of correct information. We model the social media network as a random network of users in which each news item propagates in the network in consecutive cascades. Existing studies suggest that the cascade behaviors of misinformation and correct information are affected differently by user polarization and reflexivity. We show that this difference can be used to alter network dynamics in a way that selectively hinders the spread of misinformation content. To implement these alterations, we introduce an optimization-based probabilistic dropout method that randomly removes connections between users to achieve minimal propagation of misinformation. We test the algorithm's effectiveness using simulated social networks. In our tests, we use both synthetic network structures based on stochastic block models, and natural network structures that are generated using random sampling of data collected from Twitter. The results show that on average the algorithm decreases the cascade size of misinformation content by up to 70% in synthetic network tests and up to 45% in natural network tests while maintaining a branching ratio of at least 1.5 for correct information.\n\n10:12-10:15, Paper WeA02.5 Add to My Program Distributed Multi-Agent Interaction Generation with Imagined Potential Games Sun, LingfengUniversity of California, Berkeley Hung, Pin-YunUniversity of California, Berkeley Wang, ChanghaoUniversity of California, Berkeley Tomizuka, MasayoshiUniv of California, Berkeley Xu, ZhuoUC Berkeley\n\nKeywords: Distributed control, Simulation, Multivehicle systems\n\nAbstract: Interactive behavior modeling of multiple agents is an essential challenge in simulation, especially in scenarios when agents need to avoid collisions and cooperate at the same time. Humans can interact with others without explicit communication and navigate in scenarios when cooperation is required. In this work, we aim to model human interactions in this realistic setting, where each agent acts based on its observation and does not communicate with others. We propose a framework based on distributed potential games, where each agent imagines a cooperative game with other agents and solves the game using its estimation of their behavior. We utilize iLQR to solve the games and closed-loop simulate the interactions. We demonstrate the benefits of utilizing distributed imagined games in our framework through various simulation experiments. We show the high success rate, the increased navigation efficiency, and the ability to generate rich and realistic interactions with interpretable parameters.

We present an edge-based optimal control algorithm to minimize the spread of misinformation over social networks. The proposed algorithm preserves the level of information each network node receives while preventing rumors from going viral. We introduce a localized version of the algorithm to enable scaling to large networks. Localization is based on removing any connecting edges between two nodes in the underlying graph that exceed the predefined localization distance in the latent space, whereby the probability of interaction between the two nodes decays exponentially with the distance between them in the latent space. The proposed localized control algorithm compensates for the truncation errors and retains the baseline algorithm's guarantees while reducing computational complexity. Empirical studies applying the baseline algorithm on random spatial networks and its localized counterpart on large-scale social networks extracted from 100 million Twitter messages reduced the ratio of infected users by 8% in synthetic networks and up to 6% on real-world social networks while preserving the level of information each node receives and preventing viral rumors.\n\n10:18-10:21, Paper WeA02.7 Add to My Program Controllability-Constrained Deep Network Models for Enhanced Control of Dynamical Systems Sharma, SuruchiSan Jose State University Makarenko, VolodymyrSan Jose State University Kumar, GautamSan Jose State University Tiomkin, StasSan Jose State University\n\nKeywords: Iterative learning control, Learning, Variational methods\n\nAbstract: Control of a dynamical system without the knowledge of dynamics is an important and challenging task. Modern machine learning approaches, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), allow for the estimation of a dynamics model from control inputs and corresponding state observation outputs. Such data-driven models are often utilized for the derivation of model-based controllers. However, in general, there are no guarantees that a model represented by DNNs will be controllable according to the formal control-theoretical meaning of controllability, which is crucial for the design of effective controllers. This often precludes the use of DNN-estimated models in applications, where formal controllability guarantees are required. In this proof-of-the-concept work, we propose a control-theoretical method that explicitly enhances models estimated from data with controllability. That is achieved by augmenting the model estimation objective with a controlla- bility constraint, which penalizes models with a low degree of controllability. As a result, the models estimated with the proposed controllability constraint allow for the derivation of more efficient controllers, they are interpretable by the control- theoretical quantities and have a lower long-term prediction error. The proposed method provides new insights on the connection between the DNN-based estimation of unknown dynamics and the control-theoretical guarantees of the solution properties. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in two standard classical control systems with state observation given by low resolution high-dimensional images.\n\n10:21-10:24, Paper WeA02.8 Add to My Program A Mixing-Accelerated Primal-Dual Proximal Algorithm for Distributed Nonconvex Optimization Ou, ZichongShanghaiTech University Qiu, ChenyangUniversity of Virginia Wang, DandanShanghaiTech University Lu, JieShanghaiTech University\n\nKeywords: Networked control systems, Optimization, Optimization algorithms\n\nAbstract: In this paper, we develop a distributed mixing-accelerated primal-dual proximal algorithm, referred to as MAP-Pro, which enables nodes in multi-agent networks to cooperatively minimize the sum of their nonconvex, smooth local cost functions in a decentralized fashion. The proposed algorithm is constructed upon minimizing a computationally inexpensive augmented-Lagrangian-like function and incorporating a time-varying mixing polynomial to expedite information fusion across the network. The convergence results derived for MAP-Pro include a sublinear rate of convergence to a stationary solution and, under the Polyak-{L}ojasiewics (P-{L}) condition, a linear rate of convergence to the global optimal solution. Additionally, we may embed the well-noted Chebyshev acceleration scheme in MAP-Pro, which generates a specific sequence of mixing polynomials with given degrees and enhances the convergence performance based on MAP-Pro. Finally, we illustrate the competitive convergence speed and communication efficiency of MAP-Pro via a numerical example.\n\n10:24-10:27, Paper WeA02.9 Add to My Program Consensus Control with Safety Guarantee: An Application to the Kinematic Bicycle Model Niu, KaichengGeorgia Institute of Technology Abdallah, Chaouki T.Georgia Institute of Technology Hayajneh, MohammadUnited Arab Emirates University\n\nKeywords: Networked control systems, Agents-based systems, Multivehicle systems\n\nAbstract: This paper proposes a consensus controller for multi-agent systems that can guarantee the agents' safety. The controller, built with the idea of output prediction and the Newton-Raphson method, achieves consensus for a class of heterogeneous nonlinear systems. The Integral Control Barrier Function is applied in conjunction with the controller, such that the agents' states are confined within pre-defined safety sets. Due to the dynamically-defined control input, the resulting optimization problem from the barrier function is always a Quadratic Program, despite the nonlinearities that the system dynamics may have. We verify the proposed controller using a platoon of autonomous vehicles modeled by kinematic bicycles. A convergence analysis of the leader-follower consensus under the path graph topology is conducted. Simulation results show that the vehicles achieve consensus while keeping safe inter-agent distances, suggesting a potential in future applications.\n\n10:27-10:30, Paper WeA02.10 Add to My Program An Auxiliary Graph for Clock Rigidity Analysis Wen, RuixinUniversity of Melbourne Schoof, EricUniversity of Melbourne Chapman, AirlieUniversity of Melbourne\n\nKeywords: Networked control systems\n\nAbstract: Clock rigidity theory argues that a specific graph condition can guarantee the solvability of the clock parameters in a time-of-arrival (TOA) based sensor network, where the graph represents the network topology. An auxiliary graph has been proposed to establish the connection between clock rigidity and bearing rigidity, but what is lacking in the literature are methods to leverage the auxiliary graph in the analysis of clock rigidity problems. In this paper, we propose a generalized definition of the auxiliary graph and demonstrate the usage of the auxiliary graph for examining clock configuration genericity in applications. We also study a bearing-based method for examining clock rigidity of a multigraph network, where multiple edges between the same node pairs represent multiple different TOA measurements, extending the families of graphs that can be analyzed using existing clock rigidity theory.\n\n10:30-10:33, Paper WeA02.11 Add to My Program Distributed Least-Squares Optimization Solvers with Differential Privacy Liu, WeijiaZhejiang University Wang, LeiZhejiang University Guo, FanghongZhengjiang University of Technology Wu, Zheng-GuangZhejiang University Su, HongyeZhejiang Univ\n\nKeywords: Optimization, Optimization algorithms, Networked control systems\n\nAbstract: This paper studies the distributed least-squares optimization problem with differential privacy requirement of local cost functions, for which two differentially private distributed solvers are proposed. The first is established on the distributed gradient tracking algorithm, by appropriately perturbing the initial values and parameters that contain the privacy-sensitive data with Gaussian and truncated Laplacian noises, respectively. Rigorous proofs are established to show the achievable tradeoff between the (Ïµ, Î´)-differential privacy and the computation accuracy. The second solver is established on the combination of the distributed shuffling mechanism and the average consensus algorithm, which enables each agent to obtain a noisy version of parameters characterizing the global gradient. As a result, the least squares optimization problem can be eventually solved by each agent locally in such a way that any given (Ïµ, Î´)-differential privacy requirement can be preserved while the solution may be computed with the accuracy independent of the network size, which makes the latter more suitable for large scale distributed least-squares problems. Numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of both solvers.\n\n10:33-10:36, Paper WeA02.12 Add to My Program Leveraging Untrustworthy Commands for Multi-Robot Coordination in Unpredictable Environments: A Bandit Submodular Maximization Approach Xu, ZiruiUniversity of Michigan Lin, XiaofengBoston University Tzoumas, VasileiosUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor\n\nKeywords: Optimization algorithms, Cooperative control, Autonomous robots\n\nAbstract: We study the problem of multi-agent coordination in unpredictable and partially-observable environments with untrustworthy external commands. The commands are actions suggested to the robots, and are untrustworthy in that their performance guarantees, if any, are unknown. Such commands may be generated by human operators or machine learning algorithms and, although untrustworthy, can often increase the robotsÂ performance in complex multi-robot tasks. We are motivated by complex multi-robot tasks such as target tracking, environmental mapping, and area monitoring. Such tasks are often modeled as submodular maximization problems due to the information overlap among the robots. We provide an algorithm, Meta Bandit Sequential Greedy (MetaBSG), which enjoys performance guarantees even when the external commands are arbitrarily bad. MetaBSG leverages a meta-algorithm to learn whether the robots should follow the commands or a recently developed submodular coordination algorithm, Bandit Sequential Greedy (BSG) [1], which has performance guarantees even in unpredictable and partially-observable environments. Particularly, MetaBSG asymptotically can achieve the better performance out of the commands and the BSG algorithm, quantifying its suboptimality against the optimal time-varying multi-robot actions in hindsight. Thus, MetaBSG can be interpreted as robustifying the untrustworthy commands. We validate our algorithm in simulated scenarios of multi-target tracking.\n\n10:36-10:39, Paper WeA02.13 Add to My Program Controlled Sensing for Communication-Efficient Filtering and Smoothing in POMDPs Liu, ChangrongUniversity of Melbourne Molloy, Timothy L.Australian National University Nair, Girish N.University of Melbourne\n\nKeywords: Sensor networks, Stochastic optimal control, Markov processes\n\nAbstract: The trade-off between communication resources and estimation accuracy is widely considered in sensor networks. In this paper we consider the problem of estimating the trajectory of an event-triggered hidden Markov model, {where the controller decides at each time step whether or not the sensor should sample and transmit a measurement to the estimator}. Adopting a Shannon information-theoretic point of view, we quantify the required communication resources by the entropy of the {transmitted observation sequence}, with a special symbol to denote non-transmission. Furthermore we evaluate the trajectory uncertainty by the conditional entropy of the state sequence given the received observations. Simultaneous minimization of the communication resources and state uncertainty is formulated and solved within a partially observable Markov decision process framework, yielding a threshold policy for triggering transmissions.\n\n10:39-10:42, Paper WeA02.14 Add to My Program Distributed Model Predictive Control of Integrated Process Networks Based on an Adaptive Community Detection Approach Ebrahimi, AmirMohammadKansas State University Babaei Pourkargar, DavoodKansas State University\n\nKeywords: Chemical process control, Distributed control, Predictive control for nonlinear systems\n\nAbstract: An adaptive community detection-based system decomposition approach is developed for distributed model predictive control (DMPC) of integrated process networks. In this approach, the weighted graph representation of the nonlinear state space model is utilized as the foundation for system decomposition. The most modular decomposition is identified for designing a distributed architecture by applying spectral community detection and energy-based separation techniques. The resulting decomposition evolves as the process network transitions through different operating conditions. Consequently, the distributed architecture and the DMPC design are adjusted to improve closed-loop performance and robustness. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, a benzene alkylation process benchmark under different operating conditions is used. The results of the simulation studies demonstrate that the decompositions derived through spectral community detection, based on the weighted graph representations, lead to enhanced closed-loop performance and improved computational efficiency compared to the commonly used unweighted hierarchical community-based decompositions.\n\n10:42-10:45, Paper WeA02.15 Add to My Program Fairness-Aware Electric Taxi Fleet Coordination under Short-Term Power System Failures Yuan, YukunUniversity of Tennessee at Chattanooga Ding, ZihanStony Brook University Lin, ShanState University of New York\n\nKeywords: Transportation networks, Control of networks, Intelligent systems\n\nAbstract: Power outages and shortages, among other disruptive events, can markedly diminish the charging efficiency of EV fleets, e.g., e-taxis, and compromise their service quality. This paper aims to address the challenge of coordinating e-taxis amidst such power system disruptions. To understand the extent of the problem, we employ a trace-driven simulation to measure how short-term power failures influence e-taxi service quality. Our observations highlight drops in passenger service in affected areas, pointing to a potential disparity in service quality across various regions of a city. In response, we introduce the Fairness-Aware e-taxi fleet Coordination (FAC) algorithm. FAC monitors the power system disruptions and dynamically switches between two control strategies: one that optimizes city-wide performance during normal operations, and another that emphasizes both service fairness and system performance during power disruptions. We put FAC to the trace-driven evaluation using a comprehensive dataset from an existing e-taxi ecosystem, comprising almost 8,000 taxis and averaging 62,100 taxi trips daily. Our data-driven evaluation shows the effectiveness of our solution in terms of providing fair service quality across regions and enhancing the service quality in the affected regions and a city.\n\n10:45-10:48, Paper WeA02.16 Add to My Program A Geometric Approach to Resilient Distributed Consensus Accounting for State Imprecision and Adversarial Agents Lee, ChristopherUniversity of Texas at Dallas Abbas, WaseemUniversity of Texas at Dallas\n\nKeywords: Control of networks, Networked control systems, Cooperative control\n\nAbstract: This paper presents a novel approach for resilient distributed consensus in multiagent networks when dealing with adversarial agents and imprecision in states observed by normal agents. Traditional resilient distributed consensus algorithms often presume that agents have exact knowledge of their neighbors' states, which is unrealistic in practical scenarios. We show that such existing methods are inadequate when agents only have access to imprecise states of their neighbors. To overcome this challenge, we adapt a geometric approach and model an agent's state by an `imprecision region' rather than a point in mathbb{R}^d. From a given set of imprecision regions, we first present an efficient way to compute a region that is guaranteed to lie in the convex hull of true, albeit unknown, states of agents. We call this region the emph{invariant hull} of imprecision regions and provide its geometric characterization. Next, we use these invariant hulls to identify a emph{safe point} for each normal agent. The safe point of an agent lies within the convex hull of its emph{normal} neighbors' states and hence is used by the agent to update it's state. This leads to the aggregation of normal agents' states to safe points inside the convex hull of their initial states, or an approximation of consensus. We also illustrate our results through simulations.\n\n10:48-10:51, Paper WeA02.17 Add to My Program Synchronize the Parafoil and the Vessel: A Hierarchical Distributed Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Approach Wei, ZhenyuZhejiang University Gao, YanZhejiang University Shao, ZhijiangZhejiang University\n\nKeywords: Multivehicle systems, Cooperative control, Predictive control for nonlinear systems\n\nAbstract: Emerging recovery missions bring the need to recover the parafoil system with the vessel. However, current literature of the parafoil system focuses on the fixed-point landing. This unavoidably hinders the cooperation between the parafoil system and the vessel, which limits the flexibility of payload recovery missions. This paper aims to design the distributed control algorithm for cooperative synchronization between the parafoil system and the vessel. Firstly, the cooperative synchronization process is formulated as a trajectory optimization problem based on the dynamics of the parafoil system and the vessel. To reduce the transmission burden in coordinating the two vehicles, the hierarchical distributed control approach is designed, which incorporates the synchronization point update algorithm to coordinate the two vehicles and the nonlinear model predictive control method to leverage the nonlinear dynamic model for generating the control command. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical distributed model predictive control approach for synchronizing the parafoil and the vessel under disturbances. The findings from this study will benefit the design of cooperative recovery algorithms for future payload recovery missions.\n\n10:51-10:54, Paper WeA02.18 Add to My Program Guarding a Target Area from a Heterogeneous Group of Cooperative Attackers Lee, YoonjaeThe University of Texas at Austin Das, GoutamGeorge Mason University Shishika, DaigoGeorge Mason University Bakolas, EfstathiosThe University of Texas at Austin\n\nKeywords: Game theory, Agents-based systems, Autonomous systems\n\nAbstract: In this paper, we investigate a multi-agent target guarding problem in which a single defender seeks to capture multiple attackers aiming to reach a high-value target area. In contrast to previous studies, the attackers herein are assumed to be emph{heterogeneous} in the sense that they have not only different speeds but also different weights representing their respective degrees of importance (e.g., the amount of allocated resources). The objective of the attacker team is to jointly minimize the weighted sum of their final levels of proximity to the target area, whereas the defender aims to maximize the same value. Using geometric arguments, we construct candidate equilibrium control policies that require the solution of a (possibly nonconvex) optimization problem. Despite its nonconvex nature, we establish a sufficient condition for this problem to admit a unique local minimum that is also global. Subsequently, we validate the optimality of the candidate control policies using parametric optimization techniques. Lastly, we provide numerical examples to illustrate how cooperative behaviors emerge within the attacker team due to their heterogeneity.\n\n10:54-10:57, Paper WeA02.19 Add to My Program Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based on Adaptive Curiosity for Traffic Signal Control Pan, YueTongji University Lei, JinlongTongji University Yi, PengTongji University\n\nKeywords: Traffic control, Learning, Markov processes\n\nAbstract: Intelligent Traffic Signal Control (TSC) aims to optimize urban traffic management. However, the traditional fixed-cycle intersection signal stands as one of the main factors causing traffic congestion. In addition, with the burgeoning complexity of traffic scenarios and escalating travel demands, TSC becomes a daunting challenge. Recently, the exploration of reinforcement learning in the domain of TSC has emerged as a significant research frontier because it can handle complex scenarios and offers scalability. We follow the framework and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methodology, in which we incorporate two pivotal enhancements. First of all, to ensure efficacy and stability of training, our method seamlessly combines the Actor-Critic framework with the double Q-network. Secondly, we introduce an advanced adaptive curiosity mechanism to exploit intrinsic rewards founded on the agents' varied action space properties, and hence offers a personalized exploration guide for each agent. Our empirical validation, implemented on the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) platform, covers both homogeneous grid environment and heterogeneous city setting. Notably, in comparison with traditional cyclic scheduling methods and existing advanced MARL solutions, our algorithm exhibited better traffic flow efficiency and robustness.\n\nWeA03 RI Session, Frontenac Add to My Program RI: Autonomous Robots and Systems Chair: Leang, Kam K.University of Utah Co-Chair: Beard, Randal W.Brigham Young Univ 10:00-10:03, Paper WeA03.1 Add to My Program On XYZ-Motion Planning Using a Full Car Model Chakraborty, SayanNew York University Jiang, YuClearMotion, Inc Jiang, Zhong-PingNew York University\n\nKeywords: Automotive systems, Autonomous systems, Simulation\n\nAbstract: In this study, we tackle the XYZ-motion planning problem for autonomous vehicles equipped with active suspension systems. Using perception data, we derive two road surface approximations: the encoded road and the estimated road. Using the estimated road, we first form a nonlinear optimization problem to obtain an XYZ-motion plan. For practical applicability, this optimization problem is split into two steps. First, generating a XY path by using the information of soft and hard obstacles. Second, generating a vertical motion plan with the XY path and estimated road. We have tested our methodologies on two examples, where in the first example we have used a synthetic road to demonstrate online XYZ-motion planning and in the second example we have used real-world road surface data to demonstrate offline XYZ-motion planning. We have found that our algorithms give satisfactory results in both the test cases.\n\n10:03-10:06, Paper WeA03.2 Add to My Program Temporally Robust Multi-Agent STL Motion Planning in Continuous Time Verhagen, JorisKTH Royal Institute of Technology Lindemann, LarsUniversity of Southern California Tumova, JanaKTH Royal Institute of Technology\n\nKeywords: Autonomous robots, Formal verification/synthesis, Robust control\n\nAbstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a formal language over continuous-time signals (such as trajectories of a multi-agent system) that allows for the specification of complex spatial and temporal system requirements (such as staying sufficiently close to each other within certain time intervals). To promote robustness in multi-agent motion planning with such complex requirements, we consider motion planning with the goal of maximizing the temporal robustness of their joint STL specification, i.e. maximizing the permissible time shifts of each agent's trajectory while still satisfying the STL specification. Previous methods presented temporally robust motion planning and control in a discrete-time optimization scheme. In contrast, we parameterize the trajectory by continuous BÃ©zier curves, where the curvature and the time-traversal of the trajectory are parameterized individually. We show an algorithm generating continuous-time temporally robust trajectories and prove soundness of our approach. Moreover, we empirically show that our parametrization realizes this with a considerable speed-up compared to state-of-the-art methods based on constant interval time discretization.\n\n10:06-10:09, Paper WeA03.3 Add to My Program Structure from WiFi (SfW): RSSI-Based Geometric Mapping of Indoor Environments Kim, JunseoToronto Metropolitan University Aghyourli Zalat, JillToronto Metropolitan University Bahoo, YeganehToronto Metropolitan University Saeedi, SajadToronto Metropolitan University\n\nKeywords: Autonomous robots, Estimation, Intelligent systems\n\nAbstract: With the rising prominence of WiFi in common spaces, efforts have been made in the robotics community to take advantage of this fact by incorporating WiFi signal measurements in indoor SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems. SLAM is essential in a wide range of applications, especially in the control of autonomous robots. This paper describes recent work in the development of WiFi-based localization and addresses the challenges currently faced in achieving WiFi-based geometric mapping. Inspired by the field of research into k-visibility, this paper presents the concept of inverse k-visibility and proposes a novel algorithm that allows robots to build a map of the free space of an unknown environment, essential for planning, navigation, and avoiding obstacles. Experiments performed in simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n\n10:09-10:12, Paper WeA03.4 Add to My Program Tracking Control of Optical Beam Transceivers Using Mean Field Models N'Doye, IbrahimaKing Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Laleg-Kirati, Taous-MeriemNational Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technolog\n\nKeywords: Mean field games, Cooperative control\n\nAbstract: This paper proposes mean field models to maintain an accurate line-of-sight and tracking between transceivers mounted in mobile unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) platforms in the presence of underlying mechanical vibration effects. We describe a two-way optical link beam tracking control that coordinates mobile UAVs in a network architecture to provide reliable network structure, distributed connectivity, and communicability, enhancing terrestrial public safety communication systems. We derive the optical transceiver trajectory tracking problem in which each agent dynamic and cost function is coupled with other optical beam transceiver agent states via a mean field term. We propose two optimal mean field beam tracking control frameworks through decentralized and centralized strategies in which the optical transceivers compete to reach a Nash equilibrium and cooperate to attain a social optimum, respectively. The solutions of these strategies are derived from forward-backward ordinary differential equations and rely on the linearity Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Fokker-Planck equations and stochastic maximum principle. Moreover, we numerically compute the solution pair of the resulting joint equations using Newton and fixed point iteration methods to verify the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium and social optimum.\n\n10:12-10:15, Paper WeA03.5 Add to My Program Practical Considerations for Discrete-Time Implementations of Continuous-Time Control Barrier Function-Based Safety Filters Brunke, LukasUniversity of Toronto Zhou, SiqiUniversity of Toronto Che, MingxuanTechnical University of Munich Schoellig, Angela PTechnical University of Munich & University of Toronto\n\nKeywords: Autonomous robots\n\nAbstract: Safety filters based on control barrier functions (CBFs) have become a popular method to guarantee safety for uncertified control policies, e.g., as resulting from reinforcement learning. Here, safety is defined as staying in a pre-defined set, the safe set, that adheres to the system's state constraints, e.g., as given by lane boundaries for a self-driving vehicle. In this paper, we examine one commonly overlooked problem that arises in practical implementations of continuous-time CBF-based safety filters. In particular, we look at the issues caused by discrete-time implementations of the continuous-time CBF-based safety filter, especially for cases where the magnitude of the Lie derivative of the CBF with respect to the control input is zero or close to zero. When overlooked, this filter can result in undesirable chattering effects or constraint violations. In this work, we propose three mitigation strategies that allow us to use a continuous-time safety filter in a discrete-time implementation with a local relative degree. Using these strategies in augmented CBF-based safety filters, we achieve safety for all states in the safe set by either using an additional penalty term in the safety filtering objective or modifying the CBF such that those undesired states are not encountered during closed-loop operation. We demonstrate the presented issue and validate our three proposed mitigation strategies in simulation and on a real-world quadrotor.\n\n10:15-10:18, Paper WeA03.6 Add to My Program Model Predictive Control with Reference Path Planning for Multi-UAV Formation Control System Chen, YuWenNational Taiwan University Chiang, Ming-LiNational Taiwan Ocean University Kuo, Guo-RongNational Taiwan University Chuang, Che-JungNational Taiwan University Fu, Li-ChenNational Taiwan University\n\nKeywords: Autonomous systems, Predictive control for nonlinear systems, Cooperative control\n\nAbstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-UAV formation control system in obstacle-filled environments. Our design consists of two key components, which are the formation path planning algorithm and the model predictive control (MPC) for quadrotor agents. The proposed path planning algorithm generates a safe reference path for the formation center and secure waypoints for each agent to minimize pattern deformation. The designed MPC controller helps agents track the reference trajectory and maintain formation using data from neighboring agents. Our system also processes sensor data and models surrounding obstacles for the environment instead of only considering the scenarios with a known environment. Several simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design.\n\n10:18-10:21, Paper WeA03.7 Add to My Program Interaction-Aware Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles in Forced Merging Scenario Leveraging Social Psychology Factors Li, XiaoUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor Liu, KaiwenUniversity of Michigan Tseng, H.

In this paper, we consider a behavioral model that incorporates both social behaviors and personal objectives of the interacting drivers. Leveraging this model, we develop a receding-horizon control-based decision-making strategy, that estimates online the other drivers' intentions using Bayesian filtering and incorporates predictions of nearby vehicles' behaviors under uncertain intentions. The effectiveness of the proposed decision-making strategy is demonstrated and evaluated based on simulation studies in comparison with a game theoretic controller and a real-world traffic dataset.\n\n10:21-10:24, Paper WeA03.8 Add to My Program An Optimal Control Framework for Influencing Human Driving Behavior in Mixed-Autonomy Traffic Chari, AnirudhIllinois Mathematics and Science Academy Chen, RuiCarnegie Mellon University Grover, JaskaranCMU Liu, ChangliuCarnegie Mellon University\n\nKeywords: Autonomous systems, Multivehicle systems, Optimal control\n\nAbstract: As autonomous vehicles (AVs) become increasingly prevalent, their interaction with human drivers presents a critical challenge. Current AVs lack social awareness, causing behavior that is often awkward or unsafe. To combat this, social AVs, which are proactive rather than reactive in their behavior, have been explored in recent years. With knowledge of robot-human interaction dynamics, a social AV can influence a human driver to exhibit desired behaviors by strategically altering its own behaviors. In this paper, we present a novel framework for achieving human influence. The foundation of our framework lies in an innovative use of control barrier functions to formulate the desired objectives of influence as constraints in an optimal control problem. The computed controls gradually push the system state toward satisfaction of the objectives, e.g. slowing the human down to some desired speed. We demonstrate the proposed frameworkÂs feasibility in a variety of scenarios related to car-following and lane changes, including multi-robot and multi-human configurations. In two case studies, we validate the frameworkÂs effectiveness when applied to the problems of traffic flow optimization and aggressive behavior mitigation. Given these results, the main contribution of our framework is its versatility in a wide spectrum of influence objectives and mixed-autonomy configurations.\n\n10:24-10:27, Paper WeA03.9 Add to My Program Data-Driven Monitoring with Mobile Sensors and Charging Stations Using Multi-Arm Bandits and Coordinated Motion Planners Nayak, SiddharthMassachusetts Institute of Technology Greiff, Marcus CarlMitsubishi Electric Research Laboratries Raghunathan, ArvindMitsubishi Electric Research Labs Di Cairano, StefanoMitsubishi Electric Research Labs P. Vinod, AbrahamMitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories\n\nKeywords: Autonomous systems, Statistical learning, Autonomous robots\n\nAbstract: We study the problem of data-driven monitoring using an autonomous search team. We consider a typical monitoring task of classifying a search environment into interesting and uninteresting regions as quickly as possible using a search team comprised of mobile sensors (e.g., drones) and mobile charging stations (e.g., ground vehicles). For widespread deployment in the physical world, the search team must also accommodate noisy data collected by the mobile sensors, overcome energy constraints on the mobile sensors which limit their range, and ensure collision avoidance for the charging stations. We address these challenges using a novel, bi-level approach for the monitoring task, where a high-level planner uses past data to determine the potential regions of interest for the drones to visit, and a low-level path planner coordinates the paths for the entire search team to visit these regions subject to the posed constraints. We design the high-level planner using a multi-armed bandit framework. For the low-level planner, we propose two approaches: an optimal integer program-based motion planner and a real-time implementable graph-based heuristic planner. We characterize several theoretical properties of the proposed approaches, including anytime guarantees, upper bounds on computing time, and task completion time. We show the efficacy of our approach in simulations, including one in Gazebo where we identify harvest-ready trees using an autonomous heterogeneous search team.\n\n10:27-10:30, Paper WeA03.10 Add to My Program Coupled Sensor Configuration and Planning in Unknown Dynamic Environments with Context-Relevant Mutual Information-Based Sensor Placement Poudel, PrakashWorcester Polytechnic Institute Cowlagi, Raghvendra V.Worcester Polytechnic Institute\n\nKeywords: Autonomous systems, Sensor networks, Optimization\n\nAbstract: We address path-planning for a mobile agent to navigate in an unknown environment with minimum exposure to a spatially and temporally varying threat field. The threat field is estimated using pointwise noisy measurements from a sensor network separate from the mobile agent. For this problem, we present a new metric for optimal sensor placement that quantifies reduction in uncertainty in the path cost, rather than the environment state. This metric, which we call the context-relevant mutual information (CRMI), couples the sensor placement and path-planning problem. We propose also an iterative coupled sensor configuration and path planning (CSCP) algorithm. At each iteration, the algorithm places sensors to maximize CRMI, updates the threat estimate using new measurements, and recalculates the path with minimum expected exposure to the threat. The iterations converge when the path cost variance, which is an indicator of risk, reduces below a desired threshold. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the principal advantage of this algorithm is that near-optimal low-variance paths are achieved using far fewer sensor measurements as compared to a standard decoupled method.\n\n10:30-10:33, Paper WeA03.11 Add to My Program Safe Stabilizing Control for Polygonal Robots in Dynamic Elliptical Environments Long, KehanUniversity of California San Diego Tran, KhoaUniversity of California, San Diego Leok, MelvinUniversity of California, San Diego Atanasov, NikolayUniversity of California, San Diego\n\nKeywords: Constrained control, Autonomous robots, Stability of nonlinear systems\n\nAbstract: This paper addresses the challenge of safe navigation for rigid-body mobile robots in dynamic environments. We introduce an analytic approach to compute the distance between a polygon and an ellipse, and employ it to construct a control barrier function (CBF) for safe control synthesis. Existing CBF design methods for mobile robot obstacle avoidance usually assume point or circular robots, preventing their applicability to more realistic robot body geometries. Our work enables CBF designs that capture complex robot and obstacle shapes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in simulations highlighting real-time obstacle avoidance in constrained and dynamic environments for both mobile robots and multi-joint robot arms.\n\n10:33-10:36, Paper WeA03.12 Add to My Program Aircraft Approach Management Using Reachability and Dynamic Programming P.

Our tractable method designs aircraft trajectories that 1) use only limited admissible maneuvers near the airport, 2) maintains a user-specified separation between aircraft during the entire duration of the approach, and 3) minimizes deviations from user-specified times of arrival at the airport. We use a first-come, first-serve framework to design the trajectories for multiple aircraft by solving a collection of single-aircraft trajectory planning problems. We ensure the safety of the overall system by imposing reachability-based constraints on each planning problem. We identify the constraints as well as the trajectories for aircraft using dynamic programming in a three-dimensional space. We validate the efficacy and safety of our method using historical data from Japan's Haneda International Airport.\n\n10:36-10:39, Paper WeA03.13 Add to My Program Collision Cone Control Barrier Functions: Experimental Validation on UGVs for Kinematic Obstacle Avoidance Goswami, Bhavya GiriIndian Institute of Science, Bengaluru Tayal, MananIndian Institute of Science, Bengaluru Rajgopal, KarthikIndian Institute of Science, Bengaluru Jagtap, PushpakIndian Institute of Science Nadubettu Yadukumar, ShishirIndian Institute of Science\n\nKeywords: Control applications, Autonomous robots, Optimal control\n\nAbstract: This paper introduces an experimental platform designed for the validation and demonstration of a novel class of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) tailored for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) to proactively prevent collisions with kinematic obstacles by integrating the concept of collision cones. While existing CBF formulations excel with static obstacles, extensions to torque/acceleration-controlled unicycle and bicycle models have seen limited success. Conventional CBF applications in such nonholonomic UGV models have demonstrated control conservatism, particularly in scenarios where steering/thrust control was deemed infeasible. Drawing inspiration from collision cones in path planning, we present a pioneering C3BF formulation ensuring theoretical safety guarantees for such models. The core premise revolves around aligning the obstacle's velocity away from the vehicle, establishing a constraint to perpetually avoid vectors directed towards it. This control methodology is rigorously validated through simulations and experimental verification on the Copernicus mobile robot (Unicycle Model) and FOCAS-Car (Bicycle Model).\n\n10:39-10:42, Paper WeA03.14 Add to My Program Avoidance of Constant Velocity Targets Using Bearing and Time-To-Collision Adams, James J.Brigham Young University Liu, Jen JuiBrigham Young University Beard, Randal W.Brigham Young Univ\n\nKeywords: Estimation, Autonomous systems\n\nAbstract: This paper address the problem of path deconfliction and collision avoidance for unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with a monocular optical camera. The measurements observed from the camera do not include range, but they do allow for calculation of time-to-collision. In this paper we exploit the idea that a single time-to-collision estimate may have come from any number of intruders with different range and velocities, to define a family of potential intruders. The family of potential intruders is represented by a set of particles that can then be propagated forward in time to represent the set of all potential collision scenarios. A path planning algorithm is then introduced to minimize the collision risk. The method is illustrated with simulation results.\n\n10:42-10:45, Paper WeA03.15 Add to My Program Achieving and Maintaining Inverted Pose for Miniature Autonomous Blimps Wang, JunkaiGeorgia Institute of Technology Zhang, FuminGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\nKeywords: Flight control, Mechanical systems/robotics, Mechatronics\n\nAbstract: Miniature autonomous blimps (MABs) have advantages of safe flight and long flight duration. This paper presents a flight controller design for an underactuated MAB to achieve and maintain the inverted pose. When the MAB starts from a bottom-heavy pose, an energy-shaping controller is engaged to achieve a swing-up motion for the MAB to reach the proximity of the inverted pose. Once the criteria for controller switching are met, a stabilizing controller is employed to maintain the inverted pose. The performance of the proposed controller is verified through the experimental results collected from the GT-MAB.\n\n10:45-10:48, Paper WeA03.16 Add to My Program Safe Control Synthesis for Hybrid Systems through Local Control Barrier Functions Yang, ShuoUniversity of Pennsylvania Black, MitchellToyota Motor North America Fainekos, GeorgiosToyota NA-R&D Hoxha, BardhToyota Motor North America Okamoto, HidekiToyota Mangharam, RahulUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nKeywords: Hybrid systems, Switched systems, Autonomous systems\n\nAbstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBF) have provided a very versatile framework for the synthesis of safe control architectures for a wide class of nonlinear dynamical systems. Typically, CBF-based synthesis approaches apply to systems that exhibit nonlinear Â but smooth Â relationship in the state of the system and linear relationship in the control input. In contrast, the problem of safe control synthesis using CBF for hybrid dynamical systems, i.e., systems which have a discontinuous relationship in the system state, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we build upon the progress on CBF- based control to formulate a theory for safe control synthesis for hybrid dynamical systems. Under the assumption that local CBFs can be synthesized for each mode of operation of the hybrid system, we show how to construct CBF that can guarantee safe switching between modes. The end result is a switching CBF-based controller which provides global safety guarantees. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is demonstrated on two simulation studies.\n\n10:48-10:51, Paper WeA03.17 Add to My Program Real-Time Trajectory Generation Via Dynamic Movement Primitives for Autonomous Racing Weaver, CatherineCatherine22@berkeley.edu Capobianco, RobertoSapienza University of Rome Wurman, PeterSony AI Stone, PeterThe University of Texas at Austin Tomizuka, MasayoshiUniv of California, Berkeley\n\nKeywords: Mechanical systems/robotics, Autonomous systems, Machine learning\n\nAbstract: We employ sequences of high-order motion primitives for efficient online trajectory planning, enabling competitive racecar control even when the car deviates from an offline demonstration. Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) utilize a target-driven non-linear differential equation combined with a set of perturbing weights to model arbitrary motion. The DMPÂs target-driven system ensures that online trajectories can be generated from the current state, returning to the demonstration. In racing, vehicles often operate at their handling limits, making precise control of acceleration dynamics essential for gaining an advantage in turns. We introduce the Acceleration goal (Acc. goal) DMP, extending the DMPÂs target system to accommodate accelerating targets. When sequencing DMPs to model long trajectories, our Acc. goal DMP explicitly models acceleration at the junctions where one DMP meets its successor in the sequence. Applicable to DMP weights learned by any method, the proposed DMP generates trajectories with less aggressive acceleration and jerk during transitions between DMPs compared to second-order DMPs. Our proposed DMP sequencing method can recover from trajectory deviations, achieve competitive lap times, and maintain stable control in autonomous vehicle racing within the high-fidelity racing game Gran Turismo Sport.

For example, an autonomous car's strategy must be inferable by the pedestrians interacting with the car. We model the inferability problem using a repeated bimatrix Stackelberg game with observations where a leader and a follower repeatedly interact. During the interactions, the leader uses a fixed, potentially mixed strategy. The follower, on the other hand, does not know the leader's strategy and dynamically reacts based on observations that are the leader's previous actions. In the setting with observations, the leader may suffer from an inferability loss, i.e., the performance compared to the setting where the follower has perfect information of the leader's strategy. We show that the inferability loss is upper-bounded by a function of the number of interactions and the stochasticity level of the leader's strategy, encouraging the use of inferable strategies with lower stochasticity levels. As a converse result, we also provide a game where the required number of interactions is lower bounded by a function of the desired inferability loss.\n\n10:54-10:57, Paper WeA03.19 Add to My Program Where to Drop Sensors from Aerial Robots to Monitor a Surface-Level Phenomenon Shek, Chak LamUniversity of Maryland Shi, GuangyaoUniversity of Maryland Asghar, Ahmad BilalUniversity of Maryland Tokekar, PratapUniversity of Maryland\n\nKeywords: Multivehicle systems, Sensor networks, Autonomous robots\n\nAbstract: We consider the problem of routing a team of energy-constrained Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to deploy sensors for monitoring a surface-level phenomenon in the presence of stochastic wind disturbances. Most of the environmental monitoring work considers the case where the sensors and their carrier are on one platform, and the sensing location can be controlled by controlling the carrier vehicle's position. In contrast, airdropping the sensors onto the ground can introduce stochasticity in the sensors' landing (i.e., measurement) locations. We focus on carefully choosing where to drop the sensors so that despite the measurement locations' stochasticity, we can still effectively monitor the surface-level phenomenon. Specifically, we introduce this problem where a team of UAVs must drop sensors within an allotted time budget. The objective is to maximize the mutual information between the phenomenon at Points of Interest and the measurements obtained at the random sensing locations. This is a variant of the Submodular Team Orienteering Problem with an additional constraint on the number of sensors each UAV can carry. We show that the stochasticity in the measurement location makes objective computationally expensive to compute. We propose a surrogate objective with a closed-form expression and an algorithm for the routing problem. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations using synthetic and a real-world dataset of Chlorophyll density from a Pacific Ocean sub-region.\n\n10:57-11:00, Paper WeA03.20 Add to My Program Leveraging Computational Fluid Dynamics in UAV Motion Planning Huang, YunshenWashington University in St. Louis Greiff, Marcus CarlMitsubishi Electric Research Laboratries P. Vinod, AbrahamMitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories Di Cairano, StefanoMitsubishi Electric Research Labs\n\nKeywords: Optimization, Control applications, Autonomous robots\n\nAbstract: We propose a motion planner for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in windy environments, where the motion is defined by a sequence of Bezier curves in the flat output space of the UAV. The real-time implementable planner incorporates wind information from high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations performed offline and utilizes convexity properties of Bezier curves to enable real-time implementations. For this purpose, we: (i) identify a model for the UAV-wind interaction; (ii) use the OpenFoam software to compute a model of the wind speeds subject to world geometry and boundary conditions; (iii) describe a method for regressing this wind model into a more compact representation; and finally (iv) demonstrate how this representation is amenable to minimum-snap motion planning of quad-rotor UAVs in realistic environments. We validate our approach using simulations and hardware experiments, and show a significant improvement in the thrust used by the UAV in presence of strong winds.\n\nWeA04 RI Session, Metro W Add to My Program RI: Modeling, Estimation, and System Identification Chair: Zhang, JunUniversity of Nevada Reno Co-Chair: Powell, KodyUniversity of Utah 10:00-10:03, Paper WeA04.1 Add to My Program Transformer Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Attention for Predictive Control and Optimization of Industrial Processes Gallup, EthanUniversity of Utah Tuttle, JacobTaber International Immonen, JakeUniversity of Utah Billings, BlakeUniversity of Utah Powell, KodyUniversity of Utah\n\nKeywords: Modeling, Neural networks, Process Control\n\nAbstract: In the context of real-time optimization and model predictive control of industrial systems, machine learning, and neural networks represent cutting-edge tools that hold promise for enhancing dynamic modeling. This work presents a transformer neural network architecture for real-time optimization and model predictive control. This network design includes a modified attention mechanism inspired by positional embedding attention from vision transformers and task-specific modifications to the input-output structure of the transformerÂs decoder stack. Experiments were conducted using data from a 450 MW coal-fired power plant to evaluate this approach's effectiveness. The transformer neural network was compared with conventional recurrent models, including GRU and LSTM neural networks. The transformer exhibited a 6% increase in the R-squared value of predictions and an 83% reduction in mean squared error. Computation time was also reduced by 84% compared to conventional recurrent models.\n\n10:03-10:06, Paper WeA04.2 Add to My Program A Transition System Abstraction Framework for Neural Network Dynamical System Models Yang, YejiangAugusta University Mo, ZihaoAugusta University Tran, Hoang-DungUniversity of Nebraska at Lincoln Xiang, WeimingAugusta University\n\nKeywords: Modeling, Hybrid systems, Automata\n\nAbstract: This paper proposes a transition system abstraction framework for neural network dynamical system models to enhance the model interpretability, with applications to complex dynamical systems such as human behavior learning and verification. To begin with, the localized working zone will be segmented into multiple localized partitions under the data-driven Maximum Entropy (ME) partitioning method. Then, the transition matrix will be obtained based on the set-valued reachability analysis of neural networks. Finally, applications to human handwriting dynamics learning and verification are given to validate our proposed abstraction framework, which demonstrates the advantages of enhancing the interpretability of the black-box model, i.e., our proposed framework is able to abstract a data-driven neural network model into a transition system, making the neural network model interpretable through verifying specifications described in Computational Tree Logic (CTL) languages.\n\n10:06-10:09, Paper WeA04.3 Add to My Program A Data-Driven Method for Safety-Critical Control: Designing Control Barrier Functions from State Constraints Lee, JaeminCalifornia Institute of Technology Kim, JeeseopCalifornia Institute of Technology Ames, Aaron D.California Institute of Technology\n\nKeywords: Constrained control, Identification for control, Nonlinear output feedback\n\nAbstract: This paper addresses the challenge of integrating explicit hard constraints into the control barrier function (CBF) framework for ensuring safety in autonomous systems, including robots. We propose a novel data-driven method to derive CBFs from these hard constraints in practical scenarios. Our approach assumes that the forward invariant safe set is either a subset or equal to the constrained set. The process consists of two main steps. First, we randomly sample states within the constraint boundaries and identify inputs meeting the time derivative criteria of the hard constraint; this iterative process converges using the Jaccard index. Next, we formulate CBFs that enclose the safe set using the sampled boundaries. This enables the creation of a control-invariant safe set, approaching the maximum attainable level of control invariance. This approach, therefore, addresses the complexities posed by complex autonomous systems with constrained control input spaces, culminating in a control-invariant safe set that closely approximates the maximal control invariance set.\n\n10:09-10:12, Paper WeA04.4 Add to My Program Physics-Data-Hybrid Modeling of Tilt-Rotor Vertical Take-Off and Landing Aircraft Burton, SamanthaUtah State University He, TianyiUtah State University Su, WeihuaThe University of Alabama\n\nKeywords: Aerospace, Linear parameter-varying systems, Modeling\n\nAbstract: This paper presents a Physics-Data-Hybrid (PDH) approach to model the flight dynamics of tilt-rotor Vertical-TakeOff-and-Landing (VTOL) aircraft within the transition phase. The tilting rotors enable more agile flight by varying vectored thrusts; however, they render more complex aircraft dynamics and other challenges for modeling. The proposed PDH modeling approach starts from fundamental, nonlinear physical laws, and expresses them in a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) representation, which utilizes scheduling parameters to obtain kernels that encode the intrinsic nonlinearity. After that, flight data snapshots during the transition phase are used to determine the effective state space matrices, bypassing the laborious efforts to identify accurate flight coefficients. The proposed PDH approach is validated and its modeling accuracy is assessed via simulations on a tilt-rotor VTOL aircraft. The simulation first collects data snapshots by feeding a control input sequence to excite the aircraft dynamics and the PDH model is then derived. The state responses of the resulting PDH model are then compared against the true transition trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate the PDH model's excellent modeling accuracy.\n\n10:12-10:15, Paper WeA04.5 Add to My Program Disturbance Propagation in Vehicle Platoons: Symmetric Bidirectional Interconnections Farnam, ArashGhent University Farsi, MiladDepartment of Applied Mathematics, University of Waterloo Ghorbani, MajidTallinn University of Technology L. Azad, NasserUniversity of Waterloo Crevecoeur, GuillaumeGhent University\n\nKeywords: Automotive control, Robust control, Modeling\n\nAbstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of disturbance propagation in interconnected systems with double-integrator open-loop dynamics (e.g. acceleration-controlled automated vehicles). We consider a symmetric bidirectional linear interconnection to control the vehicles, in which each vehicle is interconnected solely to one immediate predecessor and to one immediate follower with the same control gain in these two directions. We prove that in this setting, regardless of the choice of stabilizing controller, it is not possible to keep the displacements between the vehicles bounded, and they grow unbounded depending on the number of vehicles N. In this case, we call the system string unstable. We show that this impossibility of achieving string stability remains under various boundary conditions for the leading vehicle, i.e., whether this is a virtual or physical vehicle.\n\n10:15-10:18, Paper WeA04.6 Add to My Program Physically Motivated Heater Model for Precise Gas Temperature Control in Fuel Cell Stack Test Beds Zeiringer, ThomasGraz University of Technology Seeber, RichardGraz University of Technology Horn, MartinGraz University of Technology\n\nKeywords: Grey-box modeling, Identification for control, Control applications\n\nAbstract: A physically motivated heater model for precise gas temperature control for use in fuel cell stack test beds is proposed.

The rising demand and opportunities attract ride-share services. A common problem of such services is abandoned e-scooters. An autonomous e-scooter capable of moving to the charging station is a solution. This paper focuses on maintaining balance for these riderless e-scooters. The paper presents a nonlinear model for an e-scooter moving with simultaneously varying speed and steering. A PD and a feedback-linearized PD controller stabilize the model. The stability analysis shows that the controllers are ultimately bounded even with parameter uncertainties and measurement inaccuracy. Simulations on a realistic e-scooter with a general demanding path to follow verify the ultimate boundedness of the controllers. In addition, the feedback-linearized PD controller outperforms the PD controller because it has narrower ultimate bounds. Future work focuses on experiments using a self-balancing mechanism installed on an e-scooter.\n\n10:21-10:24, Paper WeA04.8 Add to My Program Identification of Multirotor Actuator Dynamics with RPM Feedback for Improved Control Charla, SeshaPurdue University Yao, BinPurdue University Voyles, RichardUniversity of Minnesota\n\nKeywords: Identification for control, Mechanical systems/robotics, Mechatronics\n\nAbstract: Multi-rotor actuator dynamics modeling spans from idealized to complex representations, often simplifying actuator nonlinearity.

However, it also aroused some controversy whether massive testing lead to increased interpersonal contacts and thus exacerbate the epidemic spreading. In this paper, we study a scalar SIQRS (Susceptible-Infected-Quarantines-Recovered-Susceptible) model incorporating infection, curing, quarantine and vaccination processes. To characterize the effects of massive testings, we assume that the interpersonal contact frequency between individuals increases linearly with the quarantine rate, which is in turn determined by the frequency of massive testings. Via equilibrium and stability analysis, we study the effects of the quarantine rate and find that there exists a threshold, above which massive testings are helpful in containing the disease and below which massive testings facilitate the epidemic spreading. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed quarantine strategy.\n\n10:27-10:30, Paper WeA04.10 Add to My Program Dimensionality Reduction of Dynamics on Lie Groups Via Structure-Aware Canonical Correlation Analysis Chung, WooyoungSan Jose State University Polani, DanielUniversity of Hertfordshire Tiomkin, StasSan Jose State University\n\nKeywords: Nonlinear systems identification, Estimation, Reduced order modeling\n\nAbstract: Incorporating prior knowledge into a data-driven modeling problem can drastically improve performance, reliability, and generalization outside of the training sample.
