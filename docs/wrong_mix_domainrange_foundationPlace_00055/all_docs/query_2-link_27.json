        "text": "Torchy’s Tacos, an Austin-based restaurant serving craveable tacos and award-winning queso has implemented Oracle Simphony Cloud Point-of-Sale (POS). With a single restaurant POS across its 125 US locations, Torchy’s can unify its digital engagement channels and improve operations with automation and real-time data and analytics. This includes supporting better management of staff and costs with easier onboarding, improved inventory management, and faster speed of service. The platform has also enabled Torchy’s Tacos to be more efficient in both its online and mobile ordering channels, which can help to increase sales.\n\n“Though each Torchy’s Tacos location has its own unique and different design, our commitment to top-notch ingredients is found in all our kitchens,” said Thai Tran, chief technology officer, Torchy’s Tacos. “Managing local suppliers and menus across various locations requires an enterprise-grade restaurant platform that offers flexibility and seamlessly connects kitchen, inventory, and supply chain systems. With Oracle, we are confident we can meet guest demand and serve up our famous ‘Damn Good’ Tacos faster and more efficiently, no matter how or where they decide to order from us.”\n\nTorchy’s Tacos is outfitting its locations with a combination of Oracle Workstation 6 and mobile tablets so that staff can engage with guest’s tableside and fire off orders to the kitchen immediately. Utilizing the expansive library of validated restaurant integrations found on the Oracle Cloud Marketplace, and cross platform extensibility layer, Torchy’s Tacos now has a robust technology stack that can easily expand as they seek out new ways to engage with guests and staff.\n\nThe Simphony Transaction Services and Business Intelligence APIs, core to the Oracle digital technology platform, also ensures real-time menu changes are distributed to digital guest-facing endpoints. Simultaneously, automated transaction data updates back-office systems to help to maximize visibility into business performance.\n\n“Torchy’s Tacos is a great example of how modern restaurant operators are balancing business performance with brand promise,” said Simon de Montfort Walker, executive vice president and general manager of Oracle Restaurants. “With Oracle’s digital transaction platform, they can effectively test new concepts and add new technology swiftly to help increase the value to the business, guests, and staff.”\n\nTorchy’s Tacos selected Oracle in Q4 FY2023."
