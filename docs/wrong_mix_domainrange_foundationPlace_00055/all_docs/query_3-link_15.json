        "text": "At Wipro, we think that it is critical to engage with the social and ecological challenges that humanity is facing. It is our conviction that engagement with social issues must be deep, meaningful, and formed on the bedrock of long-term commitment. This is the only way by which real change can happen on the ground. It is also reflective of the fact that such an approach serves both enlightened business interests and social good.\n\nWe are committed to an approach that is focused on bringing change from the inside out at four different levels:\n\nFulfilling basic duties and obligations and practicing high levels of corporate governance and transparency;\n\nA proactive approach to leading initiatives inside the organization that demonstrate commitment to a humane, sensitive and sustainable world;\n\nEngaging with, and contributing to, relevant issues in neighbourhood communities, and initiatives in all regions and countries;\n\nUsing the power of communication and advocacy to influence the larger society.\n\nOur CSR programs’ implementation happens through multiple channels – Wipro Foundation, a trust set up in April 2017, Wipro Cares, a trust for employee contributions that are matched by Wipro, and through functions and groups within Wipro Ltd.\n\nThe central tenet of our approach has been an emphasis on strong, meaningful work on systemic social issues. Our CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) policy reflects principles and strategies that have informed our long history of corporate citizenship and social responsibility. Wipro Foundation represents the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives of Wipro Limited. Going back over two decades, we focus on social initiatives in Education, Healthcare, Ecology, Disaster Response and Cities & Public Spaces.

Disclosures help us adhere to regulatory requirements, and to proactively inform and engage with our various stakeholders. Read our CSR policy, sustainability reports, and other disclosures, to learn more about our work and approach."
