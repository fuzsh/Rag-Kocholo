        "text": "Create. Explore. Share.\n\nIndia-based Wipro, Ltd. has a history of supporting education initiatives around the globe, and has worked with faculty at MSU previously to improve teacher education.\n\nOctober 15, 2014\n\nWith the help of a $2.8 million, multi-year grant from global tech giant Wipro, Ltd., faculty at Michigan State University’s College of Education are working to meet a critical need for math and science education through a distinctive fellowship program.\n\nTwenty-five teachers from Chicago Public Schools attended a face-to-face component of the fellowship this summer in Chicago, which has a strong STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) focus. Upon completion, fellows will receive a Graduate Certificate in STEM Teaching and Leadership, and will be equipped with innovative, creative teaching techniques that can be shared with colleagues.\n\n“Urban districts face steep challenges, and fellows will go on to lead and support their peers,” said Sonya Gunnings-Moton, assistant dean at the College of Education. “Through our long-standing partnership with Chicago Public Schools, these fellows will become change agents.”\n\nIndia-based Wipro has a history of supporting education initiatives around the globe, and has worked with faculty at MSU previously to improve teacher education at Azim Premji University, in India. Wipro, Ltd. founder and philanthropist Azim Premji—an adamant supporter of education and equity—also spoke at MSU’s spring 2014 commencement and received an honorary doctorate of humane letters.\n\nFellows receive a stipend to cover expenses, and commit to teaching in an urban district for at least two years. Fellows will take courses through the Master of Arts in Educational Technology (MAET), a flexible, award-winning program at MSU beginning this fall.\n\nAuthor: Sarah Wardell\n\nFaculty, Research\n\nEducation"
