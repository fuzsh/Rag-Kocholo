        "text": "At #Wipro, the approach of \"Drinking your own champagne\" has proven to be a game-changer in not only enhancing our own employee experience but also in developing solutions that can be seamlessly extended to clients. With a workforce of 230,000 employees serving as a vast user base, we are creating solutions that can cater to both our employees and clients alike. Wipro, a global entity with a diversified workforce, sees an immense volume and variety of human resources inquiries. Each query, unique in its own right, has been traditionally handled by a team of dedicated human agents. Recognizing the need for a more streamlined and efficient approach, we embarked on a transformational journey. We leveraged #AI to revolutionize the way our employees interact with HR services. Our solution was the introduction of a sophisticated #GenAI-based Incident Inceptor framework designed to identify automatable incidents like policy related questions thus reducing manual L1 ticket processing for ‘How To’ questions by 30-40%. This intelligent virtual agent operates with remarkable autonomy, sifting through Wipro's extensive policy documentation and databases to extract precise responses. It then proactively engages with employees on our internal cognitive chatbot to deliver instant resolutions to their issues. The scalable, chat-based technology underpinning this virtual agent is formidable; it indexes knowledge from thousands of documents, allowing it to comprehend and answer complex questions with ease. In our pursuit of continuous improvement, we aim to further minimize the incidence of low-complexity, high-volume tickets. The goal is to incrementally extend these AI-driven efficiencies across other areas of HR and IT. The impact of this AI-led transformation has been sizeable: /- Claim processing involves verifying the validity of a claim, checking the coverage and eligibility of the claimant, and calculating the amount of reimbursement or compensation. Traditionally, this could take an average of anywhere between 3 to 15 minutes based on the complexity of the claim. With AI, we have brought that down to one or two. Based on this we are seeing that individual claim items that call for a lot of correlation activity has been reduced to up to 80%. On overall shared service efficiency in claim processing, we are seeing an improvement of 30% to 40%. This means that we are able to process more claims in less time, reduce operational costs, enhance employee satisfaction, and improve compliance. /- Reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions of a contract, can be a tedious and challenging task, especially when dealing with lengthy and complex contracts. We are using Gen AI to better understand our service obligations and avoid the liability clauses in these. Our Gen AI tools are extracting vital performance obligations from lengthy contracts and enabling us to deliver them on time, seamlessly. #technology #innovation #creativity"
