        "text": "If you want to work and live in the US for an extended period after graduation, obtaining an H-1B visa is your best option as an international alumni. As part of the H-1B visa application process, it is required that your employer sponsors your application. As you search for opportunities in Austin, Texas, consider applying to jobs at these top 10 companies that sponsor H-1B visas.\n\nWhat is H-1B visa sponsorship?\n\nA temporary non-immigrant work authorization, the H-1B visa is considered a “dual-intent” visa. This makes the H-1B one of the most popular pathways for international students hoping to pursue permanent residency through a green card. Given its popularity, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) enforces an H-1B cap, limiting the number of H-1B visas that are issued through a lottery system each year. Most H-1B applications are submitted by early March, and decisions are usually released in late March/early April. The chances of your H-1B application being selected is known to be low. In 2024, only 15% of eligible registrations were selected, out of nearly 750,000.\n\nInterstride Tip: Remember! International students who are on STEM OPT can enter the lottery up to three times due to the validity of their OPT, which lasts for 36 months. In other words, you can enter the H-1B lottery each fiscal year.\n\nWhy work in Austin?\n\nAs the “City of the Violet Crown,” Austin is a thriving city with a technology, music, and entrepreneurial driven economy. It is home to big name companies like Apple, Intel, and Google, making the city an innovation hub, and its lively music scene makes it a popular destination for music festivals and global events. In 2021, over 20,000 millennials moved to Austin, as a result of the pandemic, driving Austin’s tech boom and also making it a top destination for young adults. Like every city, there are pros and cons to working and living in Austin. As an international student, here are some to consider:\n\nPros:\n\nJob Opportunities: Each year, Austin moves up the list of cities with the hottest job markets. The variety of industries in the city make it an attractive place for young professionals as well, with jobs in music, entertainment, business, entrepreneurship, software, and more. With several large companies and start ups relocating and expanding in Austin, Austin’s economy is thriving and the job opportunities seem to be endless.\n\nInclusive Culture: Even though Austin is within the southernmost portion of the United States, which is typically more conservative, Austin is praised as being a diverse, inclusive, and friendly city. With Austin’s high percentage of young professionals, and overall friendly attitude, international students will find that there is no shortage of new people willing to get to know you.\n\nCost of Living: In comparison to other major US cities, Austin’s cost of living is relatively lower than most, a great alternative to more expensive cities like New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles. Austin’s rental and housing markets are some of the most stable in the country.\n\nCons:\n\nDriving City: Generally, Austin’s public transportation is less than ideal. This makes Austin a major car city. That being said, there are ways to get around in the city, such as city buses, shared bikes, or carpooling groups.\n\nWeather: Perhaps one of the most notable things about Austin is the heat, particularly in the summer, and parts of the fall and spring. For international students from more mild or seasonal climates, Austin’s heat can be a hard adjustment.\n\nTop 10 Companies sponsoring H-1B visas in Austin in 2023\n\nRankH-1B Visa SponsorNumber of H-1B ApplicationsAverage Salary for H-1B Employees1Apple501$153,0492Amazon.com Services320$126,8233Tata Consultancy Services266$96,0304Advanced Micro Devices250$146,4365Charles Schwab And Company214$123,7156Visa Technology & Operations212$129,1127Intel204$123,4008The University Of Texas At Austin203$97,3749Infosys194$78,66810Wipro185$73,039\n\nApple: The cutting edge tech giant leads the list for number of H-1B applications in 2023.
