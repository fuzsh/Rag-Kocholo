        "text": "Cloud Foundry Foundation member Wipro Digital has conducted a survey of 1,400 global executives that revealed people — not technology — may be the biggest roadblock to digital transformation. In an IoT-enabled world, where enterprises increasingly adopt cloud-first strategies, business leaders are encountering the many aspects of digital transformation. If people are a key hurdle, and if those challenges are exacerbated by a lack of diverse opinions, shouldn’t companies reshape the way they think? If so, where should they start?\n\nThe tech sector has spent years grappling with how to address workforce diversity. The issue’s a hot topic among deep-tech leaders, social media stalwarts, cloud-computing champions and every enterprise in between. While most headlines have focused on equality, the Wipro survey underscores the practical business benefit of diversity: leveraging unique perspectives and skillsets.\n\nAn October 24th forum, “Embracing Diversity: Breaking Barriers to Digital Transformation,” will highlight this topic, with panelists from The Chemours Company, Estée Lauder, FedEx, Bloomberg and Harvard. During the event, which is part of Wipro’s “Women in Business” series, the executives will share their digital transformation stories and discuss how enterprises can leverage diversity to break down barriers to success. Wipro will also share insights from its recent survey."
