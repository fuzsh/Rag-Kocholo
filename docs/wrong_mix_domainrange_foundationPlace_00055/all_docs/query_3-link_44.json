        "text": "Wipro earthian is in its landmark 13th year in the space of Sustainability Education. It is one of India’s largest sustainability education program for schools and colleges curated by the Wipro Foundation. The program is designed to act as a catalyst for fostering excellence in sustainability thinking and action amongst children and youth. There was a clear need to support and drive sustainability thinking and action through the learning process in educational institutions across India. Visit: https://wiprofoundation.org/earthian/\n\nC. P. R. Environmental Education Centre (CPREEC) is a Centre of Excellence in Environmental Education established by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Government of India and CPR Foundation, Chennai in 1989. Its chief mandate is to promote environmental awareness raising and dissemination of information on the issues of environmental concern to the people. CPREEC develops innovative programmes and builds capacity in the field of education and communication for sustainable development. It endorses attitudes, strategies and technologies that are environmentally sustainable. CPREEC in collaboration with Wipro Foundation has taken up a Sustainability Education Program for schools in South India. Visit: http://cpreec.org/\n\nWipro ‘earthian’ came into being in 2011, out of the strong conviction that building awareness is the first step towards sustainability. The vision of Wipro earthian is rooted in the challenging task that humanity faces – of finding solutions to several sustainability issues like climate change, water scarcity, loss of biodiversity, etc. The project aims at building skills, attitudes and values to shape a sustainable future.\n\nThe core objectives of Wipro earthian are integrating sustainability education into school curriculum, to critically engage students with sustainability issues through multiple perspectives, driving sustainability thinking and action through the learning process and empowering teachers and learners to drive change in their own contexts and environments. The program is creative in promoting environmental thinking among the school going children (Std. VI to XII) which is highly connected to the curriculum.\n\nThe Wipro earthian program for schools aims at providing exposure to multiple perspectives, within the students’ peer group and the world around them. There are three thematic areas to explore: biodiversity, water and waste. Student groups may select any of the three themes and work on. (Visit: https://wiprofoundation.org/earthian/school-competition/).\n\nThe final project submission can be forwarded in a soft PDF form to the state specific email id mentioned in the ‘contacts’.\n\nA competent regional / national jury consisting of eminent members with varied experience in academia, research and civil society organizations will select the best entries. The top 20 entries will be awarded Rs.50,000/ (Rupees Fifty Thousand Only) each and citation in a ceremony by the Wipro Foundation, Bengaluru. There is also state/regional recognition of best project submissions with a memento and certificates to the team members. The team members of all the project submission will receive a participation certificate.\n\nThe teams can send in their registration form through a ‘Google form link’ to be shared during the orientation workshops for teachers.\n\nAn email with the details of team members, guide faculty, theme selected, school address, contact email and mobile phone number can also be sent to cpreecearthian@gmail.com."
