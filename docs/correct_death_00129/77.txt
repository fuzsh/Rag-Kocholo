John Franklin Carson was born and raised in Hollywood, California. His father was actor Kit Carson (born Eldridge Franklin Carson), who appeared in many Western films, most notably working with Dale Robertson. His mother, the former Rosemonde James, also had some acting experience, albeit primarily as a fashion model, and was elected president of the Mannequins Association of Los Angeles in 1968. Young Johnny started his career doing commercials, including one at age 5 or 6 portraying a circus ringmaster for a local department store. He later did cartoon voices for Hanna-Barbara. While attending Valley College, he played a lead role in "Taming of the Shrew", staged by the drama department in November 1969.

After his feature film debut, there was a dispute with Johnny Carson regarding use of the name John Carson. As a result, he began to use the name John David Carson professionally. He was romantically linked with Kim Darby at the time of her ex-husband (James Stacy)'s motorcycle accident, in which Stacy lost an arm and a leg, becoming a paraplegic. Carson and Darby met while the two were filming Joie (1973).
