        "text": "For almost 30 years, the last person that millions of Americans saw before they went to sleep was Johnny Carson, hosting his Tonight television chat show on NBC. In it, Carson, who has died aged 79, honed an apparently effortless technique that influenced comedians and interviewers on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nSuch was his popularity that his final show, on May 21 1992, became almost a national day of mourning, with Bette Midler singing a lament as he left the studio in Burbank, Los Angeles.\n\nCarson represented 17% of NBC's profit, and it took two leading comedians to replace him: Jay Leno at Tonight and his rival for that job, David Letterman, who departed for his own late show at CBS.\n\nLean and self-contained, Carson developed an opening monologue in which he would comment coolly, but hilariously, on what was preoccupying America. He appeared more liberal than he was by cleverly anticipating changes in public attitude and knowing when a controversial topic, such as opposition to the Vietnam war, was gaining mass approval. His constant, wounding, cracks about Richard Nixon probably contributed to the president's downfall.\n\nAlthough he was one of America's most popular figures during his reign at Tonight from October 1962 (first guest: Groucho Marx) until the last show, he almost disappeared after that. He did write a few humorous articles in the New Yorker in 2000, after surviving quadruple by-pass surgery in 1999, but mostly he kept to his Malibu home, with his fourth wife, Alexis. He also contributed quietly to charities and established a theatre at his old high school.\n\nHis previous three wives and his often disastrous business investments, which included John De Lorean's fated Northern Ireland car-building enterprise, were the source of rueful jokes. His third wife took him for a reported $20 million, but he remained good humored about it, which further endeared him to Americans.\n\nOnly once did this sunny disposition crack, when he displayed a copy of the National Enquirer, denounced its report of his marriage difficulties as \"lies\", and challenged them to sue. They did not. The marital humour also went the other way. He acknowledged that he met his fourth wife when she strolled past his Malibu home, but wags said it was her fifth pass - in a bikini.\n\nAlthough the show was always tightly scripted, Carson was capable of spontaneous wit. After a man ran naked across the set during the streaking craze of the 1970s, and was promptly arrested by police, Carson cracked he would not be prosecuted \"for lack of evidence\".\n\nA private man behind the public banter, he hid his true feelings, an act of heroic modesty considering his huge potential influence. But after he had given his notice to NBC, and his final show approached, he delivered a laconic message about democracy that is worth repeating.\n\nHe compared it to buying \"a big house you can't afford, with money you don't have, to impress people you wish were dead. And, unlike communism, democracy does not mean having just one ineffective political party; it means having two ineffective political parties.\n\n\"Democracy is welcoming people from other lands, and giving them something to hold on to, usually a mop or a leaf blower. It means that with proper timing and scrupulous bookkeeping, anyone can die owing the government a huge amount of money... Democracy means free television, not good television, but free... And finally, democracy is the eagle on the back of a dollarbill, with 13 arrows in one claw, 13 leaves on a branch, 13 tail feathers, and 13 stars over its head. This signifies that when the white man came to this country, it was bad luck for the Indians, bad luck for the trees, bad luck for the wildlife, and lights out for the American eagle. I thank you.\"\n\nCarson was born in Iowa, raised in Nebraska and, while still a schoolboy, sent for a conjuring set and entertained his fellow pupils as the \"Great Carsoni\". He spent the latter part of the second world war in the US Navy, then went to Nebraska University on the GI bill. In 1949, he worked for a radio station in Omaha, polishing his repartee before starting his own TV show.\n\nIt lasted only a year but attracted the attention of the famous comedian Red Skelton, for whom he wrote jokes. In 1957, that led to him hosting a TV game show, Who Do You Trust? After five successful seasons, he was offered the job of replacing the formidable Jack Paar on Tonight, after standing in for him several times.\n\nFrom then on, with an annual income growing to over $15 million, and the power to dictate the show's content, switching it from New York to California, and reducing the length from 90 to 60 minutes, he became a national institution, frequently hosting the Oscars, and set for permanent success in his public life.\n\nPrivately, he struggled with alcohol and endured three divorces, the first soon after he became a hit on Tonight. In 1991, one of his three sons by his first wife, Jody, was killed in a traffic accident.\n\nHe is survived by two sons and four wives."
