        "text": "Kesha is about to hit this city. WeHo Pride named the “Praying” singer as the headliner for The City of West Hollywood and WeHo Pride Presents Friday Night at OUTLOUD.\n\nSaturday and Sunday headliners include Kylie Minogue, Janelle Monáe and Diplo & Friends.\n\nFriday night’s lineup also includes Adam Lambert, Monét X Change, Niña Dioz, Jessica Betts, Owenn and Venessa Michaels.\n\nLaunched in 2020 and created by Jeff Consoletti, OUTLOUD started as a 10-episode series on Facebook to highlight queer voices during the COVID-19 pandemic when Pride activities couldn’t take place in person.\n\n“As we approach the 2024 Pride season, the City of West Hollywood remains a steadfast beacon of progressive values and unwavering advocacy for LGBTQ rights. Hosting the WeHo Pride Presents Friday Night at OUTLOUD reaffirms our City’s legacy of championing inclusivity and equality,” West Hollywood Mayor John M. Erickson said in a statement Tuesday. “As we gather to celebrate the kaleidoscope of queer talent, let us also reflect on the profound impact of our ongoing fight for LGBTQ rights, both locally and on the global stage.”\n\nIn addition to musical performances, the three-day festival also includes the WeHo Pride Street Fair, which features, activities, live entertainment and community organization booths, the annual Dyke March and the Women’s Freedom Festival.\n\nThe rest of the weekend’s lineup consists of Doechii, Ashnikko, Noah Cyrus, Trixie Mattel, Keke Palmer, Channel Tres, Yaeji, Big Freedia, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and VINCINT."
