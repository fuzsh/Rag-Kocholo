        "text": "Neighborhood of Los Angeles in California, United States\n\nEncino (Spanish for \"oak\") is a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe name Encino is the Spanish language word for \"oak.\" The Spanish name reflects the original Tongva language name for the village of Siutcanga, which can be translated to \"the place of the oaks.\"[1][2]\n\nIn 1769, the Spanish Portolá expedition, first Europeans to see inland areas of California, traveled north through Sepulveda Pass into the San Fernando Valley on August 5 and stayed two nights at the Tongva village of Siutcanga (\"the place of the oaks\") near what is now Los Encinos State Historic Park.[1] Fray Juan Crespi, a Franciscan missionary traveling with the expedition, named the valley \"El Valle de Santa Catalina de Bolonia de Los Encinos\" (The Valley of St. Catherine of Bologna of the Oaks).[3] All of Crespi's name was later dropped except \"Encino\".\n\nRancho Los Encinos (Ranch of Holm Oaks) was established in 1845 when a large parcel of former Mission San Fernando land was granted to three Mission Indians by governor Pio Pico. Many ranchos were created after the secularization of the California missions, which began in 1834. Encino derives its name from the rancho.[4]\n\nThe 2000 U.S. census counted 41,905 residents in the 9.5-square-mile (25 km2) Encino neighborhood — 4,411 inhabitants per square mile (1,703/km2), among the lowest population densities for the city but average for the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the resident population had increased to 44,581.[5]\n\nIn 2000, the median age for residents was 42, considered old for city and county neighborhoods; the percentages of residents aged 50 and older were among the county's highest.[5]\n\nThe neighborhood demographic breakdown was Whites, 80.1%; Latinos, 8.5%; Asians, 4.9%; Blacks, 2.4%; and others, 4.1%.\n\nIran (30.1%) and Russia (6.4%) were the most common places of birth for the 32.8% of the residents who were born abroad—an average percentage for Los Angeles.[5]\n\nThe median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $78,529, considered high for the city. The percentage of households that earned $125,000 and up was high for Los Angeles County. The average household size of 2.3 people was low when compared to the rest of the city and the county. Renters occupied 38.4% of the housing stock and house- or apartment-owners held 61.6%.[5]\n\nThe percentages of divorced residents and of widowed men and women were among the county's highest. In 2000 military veterans amounted to 10.6% of the population, a high rate for the county.[5]\n\nEncino is situated in the central portion of the southern San Fernando Valley and on the north slope of the Santa Monica Mountains. It is flanked on the north by Reseda, Lake Balboa, and the Sepulveda Basin, on the east by Sherman Oaks, on the south by Brentwood, and on the west by Tarzana.[6][7]\n\nThe local economy provides jobs primarily in health care (including one of two Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center hospitals), social services, and professional services (accounting and financial services, real estate, and legal) sectors. There are approximately 3,800 businesses employing about 27,000 people at an annual payroll of $1.4 billion.[9]\n\nEncino is in Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors district 3 and Los Angeles City Council District 4. It is also represented within the city of Los Angeles by the Encino Neighborhood Council,[10] an advisory body.[11]\n\nThe United States Postal Service operates the Encino Post Office at 5805 White Oak Avenue and the Balboa Van Nuys Post Office at 4930 Balboa Boulevard.[12][13]\n\nBalboa Station is located at 6338 Balboa Avenue on the Metro G Line.\n\nThe Encino Park and Ride with 160 spaces is located at 5174 Hayvenhurst Avenue, which provides weekday connections to/from Downtown Los Angeles, LAX, Pasadena, Thousand Oaks and other locations via various LADOT commuter buses.[14]\n\nBy 2000, forty-six percent of Encino residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree, a high percentage for both the city and the county. The percentage of those residents with a master's degree or higher was also high for the county.[5]\n\nSchools within the Encino boundaries are:[15]\n\nEncino is served by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).\n\nHesby Oaks Leadership Charter School (K-8 school)[16]\n\nEncino Charter Elementary School[17]\n\nEmelita Street Elementary School\n\nFred E. Lull Special Education Center\n\nLanai Road Elementary School[18]\n\nAs of 2009, there were no public high schools in Encino. Public high schools serving portions of Encino were Birmingham High School in Lake Balboa, and Reseda High School in Reseda.[19]\n\nIn 1982 the board considered closing Rhoda Street Elementary School in Encino. In April 1983 an advisory committee of the LAUSD recommended closing eight LAUSD schools, including Rhoda Street School.[20] In August 1983 the board publicly considered closing Rhoda, which had 262 students at the time.[21] In 1984 the board voted to close the Rhoda Street School.[22]\n\nSage Academy, elementary, 5901 Lindley Avenue\n\nWestmark School, 5461 Louise Avenue\n\nHoly Martyrs Armenian High School/Ferrahian, 5300 White Oak Avenue\n\nCrespi Carmelite High School, 5031 Alonzo Avenue\n\nOur Lady of Grace School, elementary, 17720 Ventura Boulevard\n\nLos Encinos School, elementary, 17114 Ventura Boulevard\n\nSaint Cyril of Jerusalem, elementary, 4650 Haskell Avenue\n\nValley Beth Shalom Day School, 15739 Ventura Boulevard\n\nInternational School of Los Angeles (Lycee International de Los Angeles), 5933 Lindley Avenue\n\nCalifornia State Parks operates the 5-acre (2.0 ha) Los Encinos State Historic Park in Encino.[23] The park includes the original nine room de la Ossa Adobe, the Garnier Building, a blacksmith shop, a pond, and a natural spring.[24]\n\nThe Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area, located in Encino,[25] includes the Woodley Worel/Magnus Cricket Complex.[26] Also included in the basin is the Encino Golf Course and the Balboa Golf Course.[27][28]\n\nThe Balboa Sports Complex in Encino includes a lighted baseball diamond, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children's play area, a community room, a lighted football field, a lighted handball court, an indoor gymnasium without weights and with a capacity for 400 people, an unlighted soccer field, lighted tennis courts which can be used as Pickleball courts, and lighted volleyball courts.[29] The Sepulveda Basin Off-leash Dog Park is a dog park in Encino.[30] The dog park has 6.5 acres (2.6 ha) of leash-free dog area, a 0.5-acre (0.20 ha) small dog area, an on-leash picnic area, 100 parking spots, and public telephones.[31] The Sepulveda Garden Center, a community garden area in Encino, has about 16 acres (6.5 ha) of land and 420 garden plots.[32]\n\nBud Abbott, comedian[33]\n\nSteve Allen, actor, author[34]\n\nDon Ameche, actor[33]\n\nDaniel Amen, psychiatrist, born in Encino[35]\n\nMarc Anthony, singer-songwriter[36]\n\nGilbert Arenas, former NBA player[37]\n\nCatherine Bach, actress[38]\n\nColleen Ballinger, actress, comedian, singer[39]\n\nFoster Brooks, comedian[40]\n\nEdgar Rice Burroughs, author[41]\n\nReggie Bush, former NFL player[42]\n\nRichard Carlson, actor and film director[43]\n\nJack Carson, actor[44]\n\nJohnny Carson, talk show host[45]\n\nDana Carvey, actor-comedian[46]\n\nJohnny Cash, singer[45]\n\nRichard Crenna, actor[47]\n\nJames Charles, makeup artist, influencer [48]\n\nMarie Currie, singer and actress, born in Encino[49]\n\nSondra Currie, actress[49]\n\nLenny Dykstra, professional athlete[50]\n\nPercy Faith, bandleader, orchestrator, composer and conductor\n\nAlice Faye, actress[51]\n\nDavid Forst, general manager of Oakland Athletics[52]\n\nAnnette Funicello, actress[53]\n\nClark Gable, actor[54]\n\nDavid Gregory, television journalist[55]\n\nDave Grohl, musician[56]\n\nSelena Gomez, singer and actor[57]\n\nPhil Harris, musician[51]\n\nPhil Hartman, actor[58]\n\nGeorge Harrison musician.\n\nDavid Hasselhoff, actor and singer[59]\n\nChick Hearn, sportscaster[60]\n\nEdward Everett Horton, actor[33]\n\nRon Howard, actor, director and producer[54]\n\nIce Cube, rapper and actor[61]\n\nJackson family, musical group[62]\n\nSamuel L.

The Park remains open today.[30]\n\nThe Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area[102][103] is a large area with multiple golf courses, tennis courts, soccer fields, baseball diamonds, bike paths, and a lake bordered by about 2,000 Pink Cloud cherry trees that blossom in the spring. Encino Park was founded around 1937 and has a playground, as well as basketball courts and two lighted tennis courts.\n\nFor over a millennium, the area known as Encino was the home of a massive California live oak known as the Encino Oak Tree. It is possible that Encino is named because of this particular tree. (Encino is the Spanish word for \"evergreen\" or \"holm oak.\") It was known for its size and longevity. The tree died on February 7, 1998, after an El Niño storm felled it. Today there is a monument to the tree at the corner of Ventura Boulevard and Louise Avenue where the Encino Oak once stood.[104]\n\nEncino is a recurring location in the SpongeBob SquarePants series, where the character Patchy the Pirate takes residence in the neighborhood. In the special episode Atlantis SquarePantis, Patchy stars in a subplot in which he had to return home to Encino to watch the new SpongeBob episode, but the neighborhood had disappeared[105]\n\nThe 1992 movie Encino Man revolves around two geeky teenagers from Encino who discover a caveman in their backyard, frozen in a block of ice where he has to learn to live in the 20th century while teaching the teenagers about life[106]\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson's 2021 movie Licorice Pizza is largely set in 1970s Encino[107]\n\nThe movie Fast Times At Ridgemont High filmed several scenes in Encino[108]\n\nIn the Columbo TV series episode \"A Bird In The Hand,\" the scene where Columbo visits a car dealership was filmed in Encino[109]\n\nThe 2022 comedy horror film Studio 666 sees Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl battle supernatural forces while the band try to record an album in an Encino mansion[110]\n\nIn the Gex video game series, the eponymous character grew up in Encino[111]\n\nJohnny Lawrence (character) grew up in Encino as the secondary antagonist in The Karate Kid[30]\n\nEncino Hospital Medical Center, Ventura Boulevard\n\nEncino Place, Ventura Boulevard\n\nChildren's carousel at Encino Place\n\nColdwell Banker, Encino Executive Plaza, Ventura Blvd. and Hayvenhurst\n\nStatuary on Ventura Boulevard\n\nLake Balboa, an artificial lake in Encino's Balboa Park\n\nRancho Los Encinos, part of the town's original namesake, 1900\n\nLos Angeles portal"
