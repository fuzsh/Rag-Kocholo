        "text": "McCARTNEY & PINK FLOYD TO PLAY OLYMPICS? Pink Floyd will reunite to perform at the closing ceremonies of the Summer Olympics in London, the U.K. newspaper, the Daily Express is reporting.\n\nPaul McCartney is said to be headlining the opening ceremonies. Sir Paul’s fellow Beatle, Ringo Starr said months ago that he’ll be unavailable to join McCartney.\n\nSinger-bassist Roger Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985. He’s twice reunited in concert with the group; first, in 2005 for the giant Live 8 concert in London with guitarist Dave Gilmour and drummer Rick Wright (who died in 2008), and again last year when Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason joined him in London at the O2 Arena at his concert celebrating the 30 th anniversary of Floyd’s classic 1980 2-LP, “The Wall.”\n\nGilmour, however, disputes the reunion talk. His spokesman contacted Britain’s NME (New Musical Express), saying, “David Gilmour can confirm that there is no truth in recent media speculation about Pink Floyd reuniting to perform for the 2012 London Olympics.”\n\nBloomberg Business Week is reporting that Pink Floyd’s box sets of “Dark Side of the Moon” and “Wish You Were Here” were the best selling multi-CD sets of 2011, beating new deluxe box sets released last year from The Beach Boys, Tony Bennett, Leonard Cohen, blues legend Robert Johnson, Morrissey and The Smiths, Billy Joel, The Rolling Stones, Nirvana, The Grateful Dead, Elvis Costello, Louis Armstrong, Jimi Hendrix and others.\n\nSurprisingly, the deluxe set of U2’s 1991 album, “Achtung Baby” did not meet sales expectations.\n\nA DIFFERENT BEATLES REUNION Ringo Starr may not be available to join Paul McCartney for his rumored headlining performance during this summer’s opening ceremonies for the London Olympics. However, the rhythm section for The Beatles did manage to get together to wish each other a merry Christmas over dinner at a restaurant in England, notes the Daily Mail. The two, accompanied by the Famous Ringo’s wife, Barbara, got together for a holiday dinner at an exclusive Italian restaurant, Celloni’s, in the London district of Mayfair.\n\nThey also exchanged Christmas gifts. Both Starr and McCartney have solo albums coming out early this year.\n\n“HEE HAW” REUNION The cast of that country corn classic, TV’s “Hee Haw,” that took place in mythical Kornfield Kountry, and that ran from 1969-93, will reunite for a special that will air several times this weekend on RFD-TV, reminiscing about the beloved series.\n\nRegulars Bill Anderson, Roy Clark, George Lindsay (who’s best-known as Goober on “The Andy Griffith Show”), Lulu Roman and Buddy Allen Owens, son of Buck Owens, will appear on “Country Family Reunion Salute to the Kornfield.”\n\nOther guests who appeared on the original series who will appear on the new special include Ricky Skaggs, Moe Bandy and Larry Gatlin of The Gatlin Brothers.\n\n“It had been quite a number of years since many of us had seen each other and the reunion was joyous,” said Roman.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS, THEY’RE ENGAGED Aretha Franklin announced that she is engaged to a longtime friend, Willie Wilkerson, reports the Associated Press.\n\nShe said in a statement that the couple is considering marrying in Miami Beach sometime this summer with a reception on a private yacht. The 69-year-old Franklin, who is marrying for the third time, joked, “No, I’m not pregnant.”\n\nAerosmith singer and “American Idol” judge Steven Tyler, who joined headliner Alice Cooper on The Beatles’ “Come Together” during his New Year’s Eve concert in Wailea, Hawaii, will also be taking his third walk down the aisle when the 63-year-old weds his gal of seven years, Erin Brady.\n\nOn “Oprah’s Next Chapter” on OWN, Tyler said of being a monogamous rock star, “Yes, it’s possible (for me). I don’t want to hurt anybody again. For all the divorces I’ve had, I hurt those girls deeply. It was some behavior that I’m ashamed of and I shouldn’t have done. I don’t want to hurt another human being.” No date or location has been reported.\n\nCountry singer Wynona Judd’s boyfriend, Highway 101 drummer Cactus Moser, popped the big question to her on Christmas Eve, and the 47-year-old songstress accepted. Like, Franklin and Tyler, this will also be her third marriage and no date and location have been announced. The couple is touring together as Wynona & The Big Noise.\n\nWAKEMAN’S MARRIED Former Yes keyboard wizard Rick Wakeman got hitched for the fourth time. The 62-year-old Wakeman married Rachel Kaufman, 37, his girlfriend of the past five years, according to a posting on his website. The twosome were married at a landmark windmill in Cley-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, England, where they live. Said Wakeman, “I was worried about an aging rocker like me marrying a lovely young girl like Rachael. So, I asked her parents’ permission before I asked her for her hand in marriage. Thankfully, they said yes.”\n\nDEBBIE REYNOLDS ENDORSES In 1957, Debbie Reynolds hit No. 1 on the pop singles chart with the lilting title song to her romantic motion picture, “Tammy.” The veteran trouper, who turns 80 in April and performs regularly at the South Point Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip, announced that she has been named the new spokeswoman for a skin care line, Stem Cell Therapy. She also announced that she’s cutting back from her usual 42 weeks of touring to 22 in 2012.\n\nLast year, a portion of her fabled collection of Hollywood memorabilia was auctioned for $13 million.\n\nBELMONTS’ MILANO DIES Doo-wop singer Fred Milano, a member of The Belmonts from the mid-’50 s until they broke up in 1971, died of lung cancer at 72 in New York City, only three weeks after his cancer was diagnosed, according to AP.\n\nMilano and three Bronx pals for The Belmonts doo-wop group in the mid-’50 s, but it wasn’t until they began backing up Dion DiMucci in 1958 as Dion & The Belmonts that they took off, recording such early rock and roll classics as “I Wonder Why,” “Teenager in Love” and “Where or When.” Internal battles between Dion and the others led to his leaving the group for a successful solo career. The group continued until 1971, scoring several minor hits.\n\nDiMucci said in a statement, “Fred played an important role in my younger life. He was very savvy with harmonies. I will always remain grateful for his contribution in 1958 & ’59 – may he rest in peace and rock on in heaven.”\n\nKINGFISH GUITARIST DEGENNARO MURDERED Kingfish guitarist Danny DeGennaro was discovered shot to death in front of his home in a Philadelphia suburb, according to the Philadelphia Intelligencer. He was 47. At press time, no arrests have been made but Bristol Township police say they are making progress on the case, but that there is “a long way to go yet.”\n\nKingfish formed in the early ’70 s in the Bay area and included members of New Riders of The Purple Sage and also Bob Weir of The Grateful Dead.\n\nDeGennaro joined the band in 1979 and was on board for the group’s 2010 tour. He also played with the late E Street Band sax player Clarence Clemons and rocker Billy Squier.\n\nNEW RELEASES Among the new, deluxe or re-programmed CDs recently released is included a 2-CD set from Elvis Presley, “Elvis Country: Legacy Edition.” The new DVDs include concerts from Chris Isaak, Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers and Ringo Starr & The Roundheads.\n\nJIM MORRISON’S HOME TORCHED The late Doors singer Jim Morrison’s Laurel Canyon home that was the inspiration for his band’s hit, “Love Street,” was damaged by arsonists in the recent wave of arson fires that hit the Hollywood area, according to AP.\n\nFirst, a Mazda Miatta was torched and the fire spread to the front of the home and its balcony. A suspect has been arrested.\n\nMorrison and his girlfriend Pam Courson lived in the home at 8021 Rothdell Trail in West Hollywood in the hilly hippie artist’s colony in the ’60 s. The singer died in Paris under still-mysterious circumstances in 1971 when he was 27.\n\nSUPERTRAMP’S HODGSON TO TOUR Former Supertramp co-frontman Roger Hodgson has a world tour on tap this year, according to his website. Hodgson, who wrote and sang the majority of the popular ’70 s prog-rock band’s hits, including “Give a Little Bit,” “Take the Long Way home,” “The Logical Song,” “Dreamer” and many others, hits the U.S. in February. The tour kicks off with a couple of shows on Feb. 24 and 25 at the Pechanga Resort & Casino in Temecula. They are his only scheduled southern California gigs.\n\nN’DOUR TO RUN Legendary World Music icon Youssou N’dour announced that he will run for president in his native country, Senegal.\n\nThe election is next month on Feb. 26. The 52-year-old musician is running against the country’s 85-year-old incumbent President Abdoulaye Wade.\n\nTwenty other candidates are also in the running. N’dour is Senegal’s best-known cultural export and ambassador.\n\nHistorically, Senegal, which received its independence from France in 1960, is one of Africa’s most stable democracies.\n\nSEAN BONNIWELL DIES The Music Machine’s frontman, gruff-voiced singer-songwriter Sean Bonniwell, whose one biggie, “Talk Talk” was a Top 20 hit in 1966, died in a medical center in Visalia. He was 71, reports AP. Despite having only one hit, the pre-punk group has become iconic to lovers of rough and tumble garage rock fans.\n\nKAY STEVENS DIES Singer and actress Kaye Stevens, who took the stage with Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, died in a central Florida Hospital north of Orlando at age 79, according to the Miami Herald. She had been battling breast cancer and blood clots. For years, Stevens performed with the Rat Pack or with individual members that included Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Joey Bishop. She also performed in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War with Bob Hope’s USO tours.\n\nLike a Busby Berkeley musical of the ’30 s, Stevens was given her big opportunity to headline when she was discovered by Johnny Carson’s sidekick Ed McMahan when he saw a lounge show at the Riveria Hotel in Las Vegas.\n\nHeadliner Debbie Reynolds fell ill and Stevens was called on to fill in. McMahan loved it and the rest, as they say, was history."
