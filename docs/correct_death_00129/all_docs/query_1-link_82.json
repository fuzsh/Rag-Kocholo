At some point, he was willed to a pastor by the name of James Grier, who freed him. Under an 1806 Virginia law, anyone who was freed in that state was required to leave Virginia within twelve months or risk being enslaved; as a result, by 1813 Grier had moved to Gibson County, Indiana, making him one of the first pioneers, Black or white, in the area. Within two years, Grier had purchased forty acres of land from the federal land office in Vincennes, and by 1818 he had married a young woman, Keziah Rosborough, with whom he would raise six children. Together, Grier and his wife expanded their land holdings to 260 acres near the area that would become known as Lyles Station, a Black farming community with deep historical roots. Grier was an active abolitionist and conductor on the Underground Railroad, and he also founded and funded an African Methodist Episcopal Church in his community. After Grier's death in 1872, his land was sold to members of the other Black farming families nearby. The Grier family seems to have left Gibson County not long after, but the community that Grier helped create continued. To this day, Black farmers maintain a vital presence in Gibson County.

EAGLESON\n\nPreston E. Eagleson was born in Mitchell, Indiana, in 1876. During his early years, his family moved around Indiana before settling in Bloomington where he attended Bloomington High School. He graduated second in his class in 1892 at the age of sixteen. Later that year, Eagleson enrolled in Indiana University (an all-white faculty and a predominantly white student body) where, as a skilled athlete, he became the first African American to participate in intercollegiate athletics. He joined the football team as a freshman and played throughout his undergraduate career. Because he was a black player, his team experienced some racial discrimination when traveling to other schools. One specific incident occurred in October 1893, when his team traveled to Butler University. Butler, as the host school, did not properly greet the football team, and during the game, there were reports of unfair calls, fights on the field, and the crowd shouting racist expletives at Eagleson. The next year, in October 1894, Eagleson appeared in the Indianapolis Journal headlines, \"AGAINST THE COLORED PLAYER: Two Hotels in Crawfordsville Refused to Take in an I.U. Man.\" The IU football team traveled to Wabash College, and was refused lodging accommodations by two separate inns, after learning one player was black. A third innkeeper welcomed the entire team. This event infuriated Eagleson's father, who filed a lawsuit. In 1885, Indiana passed a Civil Rights Act that stated all persons were \"entitled to the full and equal enjoyments of the accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of inns, restaurants, eating-houses, barbershops, public conveyances on land and water, theaters, and all other places of public accommodations and amusement.\" Punishment for violations were up to a $100 fine and/or up to 30 days in jail. The lawsuit was heard in Montgomery County Circuit Court on January 29, 1895. After hearing evidence, the jury deliberated throughout the night and awarded Eagleson $50, equivalent to just over $1,500 today. An appeal was filed and in March 1896, and the case was reviewed by the Appellate Court of Indiana, where the decision for Eagleson was confirmed. There were no other racial discrimination incidents reported during Eagleson's college years at IU. He continued as a leader on the football field, and during his junior year he won the right to represent IU at the State Oratorical Contest; he was the first African American student to appear at the contest, and he took fourth place. Eagleson earned his bachelor's in philosophy in 1896, and in 1906 he became the first African American at IU to earn an advanced degree with an MA in philosophy. After graduation, he became a teacher but due to poor health, he died at home in 1911 at the age of 35.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFebruary 13 – Author/Poet - MARI EVANS\n\nMari Evans was a poet, writer, director, and producer associated with the Black Arts Movement.

In 1901, Ward opened an office on Indiana Avenue, where he was one of eight African American doctors. He later went on to open Ward’s Sanitarium, a hospital and surgery center offering medical services to all. Ward enlisted for military service during World War I and served with the 92nd Division medical corps in France - one of two segregated units of the Army. Ward became one of only two African American officers in the medical corps to attain the rank of Major.

Sometime before 1835, Anderson relocated to Cincinnati, Ohio, due to Virginia passing severe restrictions on free blacks after the 1831 Nat Turner Rebellion. Anderson was trained as a blacksmith and skilled in making wrought-iron undercarriages and decorative fences. These skills allowed Anderson to find employment as a laborer fixing metal and steam fittings on steamboats. Between 1835 and 1840, Anderson relocated to Madison, Indiana, which is where he established his blacksmith shop. Eventually, Anderson involved himself in the Underground Railroad organization of Madison, Indiana. Soon after, he abandoned his trade as a blacksmith to assist fugitive slaves full time. Anderson took numerous trips into Kentucky where he purportedly rounded up to 20 to 30 enslaved people at a time. Anderson was light-skinned and often passed as a white man. Because of his light skin, he traveled with freedom seekers to Canada on steamboats and trains masquerading as their master. Anderson soon attained leadership in the Madison Underground Railroad. He prevailed at opening and developing secure routes. Anderson assisted at least hundreds to a thousand fugitives in gaining their freedom. His fellow abolitionists referred to him as the “general superintendent” of the Underground Railroad. Anderson moved his operations base to Lawrenceburg, Indiana as a result of increased danger, fines levied against him and the Madison riots. In December 1856, Louisville police officers captured and arrested Anderson on an Ohio River steamboat for taking a group of freedom seekers from Lawrenceburg, Indiana to Cleveland. He was found guilty of violating the Kentucky Law “enticing slaves to run away” and was sentenced to an eight-year term. Suspiciously, the day Anderson was to be released from a Frankfort, Kentucky prison, he was found dead in his cell in April 1861.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFebruary 9 – Art: WILLIAM EDUOARD SCOTT AND JOHN WESLEY HARDRICK\n\nBorn on March 11, 1884, Indianapolis native William Edouard Scott graduated from Emmerich Manual High School in 1903.

However, he signed his first professional contract with the Los Angles Dons of the All-American Football Conference. He later played in the NFL for franchises in New York, Dallas, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, earning trips to the Pro Bowl in 1951, 1952, and 1953.

After growing up in the Martindale neighborhood on the east side of Indianapolis, and having lost a child of her own, Edna recognized a need for childcare in the community. She took matters into her own hands in 1941, when she established a Christian daycare in a rented room. While she started with a client base of two young girls, within a year the business had outgrown the space. Edna fought continuously for funding to serve the children and their families, and by 1946 had secured enough money to open the East Side Christian Center. Over the following decades, and continuing to the present day, the Center expanded its programming to include adult education classes, meals, after-school programs, summer camps, and other services. Edna Mae Barnes Martin died in 1946, and the Edna Martin Christian Center will continue her legacy for generations of future Hoosiers.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCarrie Barnes Ross was an influential leader in the Indiana woman suffrage movement.

In Indianapolis, Ross joined the NAACP and became secretary of the local chapter. She also became active in the woman suffrage movement, believing that African American women would greatly benefit from the right to vote. In July 1912, Ross organized an African American branch of the Equal Suffrage League of Indiana. Thirty women and ten men attended the group's first meeting. Ross was elected its first president. As president, Ross worked tirelessly to recruit African Americans to join the woman suffrage movement. Her efforts were instrumental in bringing together a diverse group of people to fight for a woman's right to vote. In 1916, Ross married Hubert Heaton Washington Ross, a Boston dentist, and left Indianapolis shortly thereafter. She died from childbirth complications in 1918.
