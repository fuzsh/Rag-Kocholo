        "text": "Patric Verrone’s three-month campaign for a California State Senate seat has come to an end after gaining meager support among voters in West Los Angeles, West Hollywood and Santa Monica.\n\nWith 18% of ballots counted in Tuesday’s primary, the TV writer and former president of the Writers Guild of America West was a distant seventh among eight candidates in the 26th District to succeed Democrat State Senator Ted Lieu, who is running for the Congressional seat of retiring Rep. Henry Waxman. Verrone had 2.5% of the vote, or 1,111, as of 11:30 pm PDT.\n\nVerrone campaigned on a platform of preserving middle-class jobs and attracting new ones. He received endorsements from “Family Guy” showrunner Seth McFarlane, Judd Apatow, Greg Daniels (“Parks and Recreation”), “Mad Men” creator Matthew Weiner and “The West Wing” showrunner John Wells.\n\nSanta Monica-Malibu school board member Ben Allen was leading the field with 22.8%, followed by Independent Seth Stodder with 19.8%, women’s rights activist Sandra Fluke with 17.5% and former Assemblywoman Betsy Butler — who represented another district from 2010 to 2012 — with 16.3%.\n\nStodder was the only candidate in the field who did not run as a Democrat. He served as director of policy and planning for U.S. Customs and Border Protection under President George W. Bush.\n\nThe top two candidates will be in a run-off in November’s general election.\n\nVerrone, who won a two-year seat on the WGA West board in September, disclosed his candidacy to fellow writers in a March 15 email that included a pitch for funds. He’s best known for leading the WGA’s strike in 2007-08 and has worked on “Futurama,” “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,” “The Larry Sanders Show” and “The Simpsons.”\n\nRelated stories\n\nITV Blasted Over Purchase of 'Pawn Stars' Producer\n\nJudd Apatow, Matt Weiner, John Wells Endorse Patric Verrone for Senate\n\nWGA Members Ratify New 3-Year Deal"
