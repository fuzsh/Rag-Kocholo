        "text": "Robert Blake, the actor who became a Hollywood pariah after he was charged with—and eventually acquitted of—the murder of his second wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, has died at the age of 89.\n\nBefore his highly publicized arrest and trial, Blake was best known for being the star of TV’s Baretta—and one of Hollywood’s prickliest and most pugnacious personalities. The actor referred to himself as “old Crazy Horse.” When he appeared on talk shows, Blake could be counted on to careen unpredictably off-script. Take, for instance, the memorable night in 1984 when he appeared onThe Tonight Show, ostensibly to promote his upcoming TV series, Hell Town. Instead, Blake went rogue: “There’s no point in me plugging it because it may never get on the air,” he told Johnny Carson. He proceeded to note his skirmishes with network Standards and Practices, and admitted that he had only taken the role because he had failed in his bid for movie stardom.\n\n“He did not care one bit about what anybody thought about him or his work or about the business, nothing,” David Lynch, who directed Blake in his 1997 film Lost Highway, once said in an interview. “I thought that was really refreshing. I always respected him for being his own man.”\n\nLynch cast Blake as the Mystery Man, who makes an unnerving entrance in a party scene—telling Bill Pullman’s Fred Madison that the two of them have not only met before at Fred’s house, but “as a matter of fact, I’m there right now.” David Foster Wallace, writing in Premiere magazine, called his performance “riveting and creepy.” The character, he conjectured, was clearly meant to be “the devil, or at least somebody's very troubling idea of the devil, a kind of pure floating spirit of malevolence.”\n\nIt would be Blake’s last screen role. In 2001, Bonny Lee Bakley was fatally shot in a car outside a Studio City Italian restaurant where she and Blake had just dined. The following year, Blake was arrested and charged with her murder.\n\nSuccess did not come easy for Blake, nor did fame when he finally achieved it more than two decades into his career. Blake was born Michael Gubotosi on Sept. 18, 1933 in Nutley, New Jersey. His parents had a song and dance act, and Blake performed with his two siblings as “The Three Little Hillbillies.”\n\nAfter the family moved to Los Angeles, Blake worked as a movie extra before joining the last incarnation of the Our Gang/Little Rascals child ensemble. He appeared in 40 short subjects between 1939 and 1944. After that franchise ended, he portrayed a Native American boy, Little Beaver, in the series of low budget Red Ryder westerns. Blake appeared in several films for Warner Bros. and MGM studios, playing roles such as the Mexican beggar boy who sells Humphrey Bogart a winning lottery ticket in Treasure of the Sierra Madre. In a 1977 People magazine interview, he said of those years, “I wasn’t a child star, I was a child laborer.”\n\nBlake turned down the role of Little Joe in the popular western series, Bonanza, the second longest-running TV western after Gunsmoke. He was a journeyman actor until his breakout role as killer Perry Smith in the 1967 film, In Cold Blood. His next four films were critical and box office disappointments.\n\nThe TV series Baretta was his breakthrough. He won an Emmy award as the street-savvy undercover cop with a pet cockatoo named Fred. Two of his colorful character’s catchphrases entered the pop culture lexicon: “You can take that to the bank” and “That’s the name of that tune.” The series ran from 1975-1978.\n\nThat People magazine profile, a cover story headlined, “Fame Cost Me My Family,” referenced Blake’s unhappy childhood, bouts with alcoholism, substance abuse and depression, and the divorce that year from his wife, Sondra Kerr, whom he married in 1964. In other interviews he spoke about child abuse at the hands of his alcoholic father.\n\nHell Town, which premiered in 1985, looked to be Blake’s comeback vehicle. It was a modest hit, but he quit the series after 16 episodes. He claimed in a 1992 Los Angeles Times interview that he “was living on sleeping pills and junk food” and was “only days—maybe hours—away from sticking a gun in my mouth….”\n\nHe dropped out of show business for almost a decade. Analysis, therapy and self-healing helped him turn around his life. In 1992 he was nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance as a man who murdered his family in the TV true crime film Judgment Day: The John List Story. He had a featured role in Money Train opposite Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes in 1995.\n\nIn 1999, Blake met Bakley, who was involved at the time with Marlon Brando’s son, Christian. In 2000, she gave birth to a daughter. The paternity test determined Blake to be the father. The couple married that year, but rarely saw each other, he later said.\n\nOn the night of Bakley’s murder, the couple dined at Vitello’s, an Italian restaurant. Blake claimed that he walked Bakely back to their car, but then went back to the restaurant for his handgun he said he left there. When he returned to the car, she was dead.\n\nBlake’s trial began in December of 2004. Bakley’s sordid past—petty scams, several arrests, celebrity stalking—was cited in Blake’s defense as evidence that others had motive to kill her. In 2005, he was found not guilty. But in November of that year, Bakley’s children prevailed in a wrongful death suit against Blake, who was ordered to pay $30 million. That judgment was reduced by half on appeal, but Blake was forced to declare bankruptcy in 2006.\n\nIn 2012, Blake gave a characteristically contentious interview on Piers Morgan Tonight. He was promoting his self-published memoir, Tales of a Rascal: What I Did for Love, but Morgan brought up Bakley’s murder and suggested Blake was not being entirely truthful about it, Blake pushed back hard, memorably telling Morgan, “I would have assumed that you and that guy in your ear would trust me. And if you don’t, we’d better start talking about the Little Rascals.”\n\nIn 2018, Bakley’s murder was the subject of an episode of the reality series, Marcia Clark Investigates the First 48. But he did not appear again onscreen, after a career marked by sharp highs and lows and fueled by Blake’s perception he was a Hollywood outsider. That, it seems, led to a lifetime of frustration.“Y’know,” he told People, “I’m always the little greaseball on the corner who ain’t supposed to have none o’ this. And Lord knows I paid enough frigging dues in my life to get someplace.”"
