        "text": "How did your family get out to LA?\n\nWell, my grandfather knew a guy out here who’d been here since the 1920s — another guy from this small town in Sicily called Naro. In early ’50s they came and visited him and they thought, “this is good. I like it.”\n\nSo my grandfather made the decision to not only move from Italy, but to move from New York to California. My mom and our family followed.\n\nAs everyone knows by now, I grew up in Chicago where, obviously, the Italians have thrived for a long time. Why do you think the Italians haven’t in LA?\n\nI can tell you a little bit. In the 1920s, when my grandfather’s friend was around, most of the Italian neighborhood was over there by Philippe’s on Alameda in DTLA.\n\nThere’s still a church there that’s Italian oriented [St. Peter’s Italian Church], there’s also an Italian club there. But that neighborhood is completely dissipated.\n\nA lot of the people came to the San Gabriel valley were I grew up, which is where some of the best Italian restaurants are in the LA area. Personally, I think the best are Di Pilla’s in Rosemead, Petrillo's in San Gabriel and Vittoria in Alhambra.\n\nWe still have kind of a neighborhood in the San Gabriel valley. There’s a bit of us there, but it’s not like a part of the city that anybody even knows about. And it’s certainly not only-Italians there. Especially now there are a lot of Asians in that area, and there’s always been Mexicans in that neighborhood. So we gravitated from that little area downtown, near Philippe’s towards the San Gabriel Valley, but it wasn’t as a cluster and there was never really a neighborhood, so to speak.\n\nYou’ve written 10 books about various Californian things that now we consider “vintage.” Is it weird for you that these things are now considered vintage?\n\nWell, I was so small when a lot of this stuff was going on, or I didn’t even exist when a lot of this stuff that I cover was going on, so for me, it’s more of a fascination with the culture expanding in LA.\n\nThe way my mom has put it is: New York is a big city that acted like a big city. But LA is a big city that still thinks it’s a small town. That’s why a lot of stuff grew slowly here. But ultimately in the 1960s, especially, it expanded massively.\n\nIt was a good time for us in the ‘60s here. Let’s put it that way.\n\nMy book Riot on the Sunset Strip, is about how we benefited from that, musically, because all this creativity happened up on the Strip. It just went from being a few clubs to many clubs, and many more groups that had an impact on people; to nothing, because all the clubs were shut down by the LAPD and the county Sheriff.\n\nWhen did the riots on the Sunset Strip happen?\n\n1966.\n\nWhere were you in 1966?\n\nI was in Monterey Park.\n\nIn LA we had a lot of television shows with teenage dance bands — The Turtles, The Byrds, Love, Buffalo Springfield. I saw them all on TV, often.\n\nSo when I actually went to the Strip in 1966 with my family — a family member came in from New York and we took him to Sunset Strip because he wanted to see it.\n\nWe were caught in that traffic and I got to see the Strip, I got to see all those nightclubs, I got to see all those teenagers clogging the streets. And it was really exciting.\n\nAnd I was like, “wow, when I grow up, I’m going to go there.”\n\nAnd of course they shut it down at the end of ‘66. And so by the time I was like 14, I took the bus up there and I said, “where did it all go?”\n\nThat’s what really fascinated to me. It’s like, “wait, we had all this stuff. And then we don’t. And it was fantastic. Where, where did it go? What happened? What happened to this great thing that we had?”\n\nSo I’ve always been kind of looking for the answers to why did it go away.\n\nAnd then what became more important was why was it so great in the first place. And why did it happen here?\n\nOne of the things you taught me was West Hollywood wasn’t a city back then. It was unincorporated. Did that lend to entrepreneurs who said, “if I’m going to build a dance club or a rock club, it’s better for to do it on the west side than in Hollywood proper?\n\nAt that time, for sure. And it goes all the way back to the 1920s, because the first nightclub that was really built on the Sunset Strip was a place called La Boheme.\n\nAnd they had an illegal hooch seller during Prohibition. So people were able to drink on the Strip.\n\nLA was a little bit provincial, let’s put it that way, in the old days. And so this unincorporated area on the Strip had two gambling joints and the guys who ran them were run out of town and they went to Las Vegas and built Las Vegas.\n\nSo you see this unincorporated part of town was important and that freewheeling feeling lasted into the ’50s and the ’60s.\n\nAs the generations changed, we went from Hollywood glamour/movie star era to a beatnik / modern jazz /Miles Davis/folk music kind of era of the ’50s — and that was all up on the Strip.\n\nAnd then in the early ‘60s, the go-go dancing thing started to happen. The Peppermint Lounge in New York City brought The Twist craze national, and we had some twist clubs here, and eventually The Byrds played at one of the twist clubs and they changed everything.\n\nAfter The Byrds, it was The Doors, Frank Zappa, Buffalo Springfield, Love, you name it, just a lot more experimental-type music.\n\nThat’s what I covered in the Riot on The Sunset Strip book.\n\nThe Whisky a Go Go\n\nWhen you mentioned those bands to me, I think of the Whisky.\n\nYeah. It started in 1964 as strictly a place for people to go dance. The house band, Johnny Rivers, made a live album there and it was a hit.\n\nSo it got a lot of notoriety and the go-go dancers were also really novel.\n\nThey were almost like a throwback to the 1920s — the flapper kind of thing that the girls in the cages looked like they were wearing sort of a flapper dress.\n\nThis young woman, Joanie Labine, designed a flapper dress for the go-go girls. And they all wore that. And that was copied by television. So when you saw on the variety shows or teen dance shows, go-go dancing, it was all based on the go-go dancers as to Whisky circa ‘64.\n\nBut the interesting thing about Whisky, it didn’t really have that fantastic of bands until 1966.\n\nWhen The Byrds broke at a place called Ciro’s in 1965 [which is now the Comedy Store], the whole strip changed and everybody started opening up brand new clubs that were a little bit more pop art and psychedelic, so to speak.\n\nFrom Ciro’s to It’s Boss\n\nCiro’s was an old ‘40s nightclub and it completely had to turn around in ‘65, right after The Byrds broke there.\n\nThey were like, “we’re going to make a brand new club. It’s going to be called It’s boss, and it’s going to have pop art on the walls,” and so on and so forth.\n\nAll the top hit acts of the ’60s played there.\n\nThere was another joint down Sunset Boulevard in the old Hollywood called the The Hullabaloo, which was a similar thing. It was an old club called The Earl Carroll Theater or The Moulin Rouge, earlier, and it became this pop-psychedelic club that the Yardbirds played at.\n\nThen the Whisky a Go-Go got hip, they started booking cooler bands, and then they opened a club called The Trip! which had all the Motown groups play in there.\n\nThey also had the Velvet Underground with Nico and Andy Warhol.\n\nIt was right across from what you now know is Mel’s which used to be Ben Frank’s, directly across the street was the Playboy building.\n\nI always like to think that, okay, you could have gone to go see Them at the Whisky with either the Buffalo Springfield, The Doors, or Captain Beefheart opening, and then walk down the street to see the Velvet Underground with Frank Zappa opening.\n\nI mean, that’s what it was like, and you’re not going to get anything like that anymore in any city. They’re never going to be that much condensed cool. I can’t imagine it.\n\nThe only other thing like that, historically, is old New Orleans around the turn of the century into the ’20s, and 52nd St. in New York during the late ’30s to about 1951.\n\nWhat caused the riot?\n\nWell, it’s a real hard thing to describe in a nutshell, but it has to do with out-and-out upper-echelon racism. That NIMBY thing is about not fraternizing with Mexicans, not fraternizing with Blacks, not being around people other than your own kind and not being comfortable with people other than your own kind, which is a problem in LA and it has been for a long time.\n\nBack in the 1950s… when the nightclubs on the Sunset Strip went from being Clark Gable and Jean Harlow and all the classic glamour era movie stars, and that business moved out to Las Vegas… artists like Frank Sinatra had a contract that said, you can’t play in Los Angeles for six months if you’re gonna play in our Las Vegas lounge.\n\nSo ultimately they had them on the lock that Sinatra couldn’t even play LA, he had to play Vegas. And so that’s how that generation moved away from those clubs.\n\nInstead, the Sunset Strip nightclubs got people like Miles Davis and all the great mid-century modern jazz artists. It became a sort of beatnik Bohemia.\n\nThere was folk music club up there called The Unicorn. There were two really important jazz clubs: the Renaissance and the Crescendo on the Strip. That had replaced the glamorous movie star thing.\n\nWell, County Supervisor Ernest Debs saw that and goes, “ah, Negroes are coming up here. That depreciates the property. Let’s get the property down low and we’ll sell all that property. And we’ll bring up Spring Street to the Sunset Strip and have the Financial District of LA be on Sunset Boulevard on the Sunset Strip right next to Beverly Hills.\n\nThat was his concept, but it never did work out the way he wanted it. But in the meantime, he ended up closing all the clubs eventually.\n\nLA, like it or not, is a diverse place, so you’re going to attract young people of all backgrounds, right? And, by the way, Black and brown people are working at these clubs too. They’re just maybe out of sight.\n\nBesides that though, the artists that played on the Strip — I mean Otis Redding had a famous Whisky a Go-Go album, which was one of the best engagements of the whole time. And Bob Dylan went to go see him there. And there’s pictures of Dylan watching Otis on stage with the go-go girls.\n\nBut also there was so many great Motown acts and they did play live in those days. Martha and Vandellas played at The Trip! The Temptations played at The Trip! The Miracles played at the Whisky a Go-Go. The Rising Sons from LA with Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder opened for The Temptations.\n\nAnd then Billy Preston was also local, and there was a lot of local soul artists like Brenton Wood, and Charles White & The Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band.\n\nAnd all those guys in War were in another band called Señor Soul and before that they were in a group called The Creators. So there was a lot of great rhythm and blues stuff mixed into all this.\n\nRock ’n’ roll was primarily rhythm and blues in the ‘50s; and soul during the ‘60s was just an extension of that.\n\nEven in the early ‘70s, a lot of those soul records by the Delfonics, if you take away some of the ’70s production flourishes, and it’s just like a doo-wop group. And it was also happening with the white kids too. The Beach Boys are from here and that’s one of the greatest vocal groups ever.\n\nThe Everly Brothers moved to Los Angeles in ‘64, reunited with Felice and Boudleaux Bryant who were writing all their hits songs in the ’50s, and James Burton became their guitar player. And all of a sudden the Everly Brothers are making better records than they ever made.\n\nSo we had that country rock thing going on. We had rhythm and blues going on and then psychedelic music. Some of it came from folk, and folk rock expanded — that’s where Ravi Shankar came from and Ravi Shankar wasn’t going to play anywhere but a folk music venue, so there’s part of your psychedelic invasion.\n\nBut folk actually brought you the Ashgrove on Melrose. It was one of the great clubs because they had Jewish klezmer music there. They had every kind of music at its root base. So that diversity in music just expanded into groups like Love or The Byrds who took on. Like Latin music, for example, The Byrds used it in “So You Want to Be a Rock ’n’ Roll Star,” Love used it in many of their songs. Stephen Stills used it a lot because he grew up in a lot of Latin neighborhoods.\n\nWas Melrose then what it is today for young people?\n\nWell, when I was 20 and it was 1980, I went to go see the Ramones there. I saw the B-52s there, and boy, that was something.\n\nAnd so, yeah, I went to the Palladium\n\nI was talking to somebody about this the other day who’s a 5' 4\" young lady. I said, I think the reason Palladium shows are so good is because there’s no real seats; and because the VIPs, the corporate Westside cool people you were talking about —\n\nUncool people.\n\nUncool, yes, they think they’re cool. They sit up up in that second level up there, away from the crowd.\n\nYes, the people who don’t want the riff-raff are away from the people having fun.\n\nThe few seats that there are. Let them go sit there.\n\nBecause there’s not really good sight lines in the Palladium, especially if you’re shorter, you have to really be into the band.\n\nAnd have to go early enough to get close enough through the first band…\n\nI always did.\n\n… to appreciate the band that you really want to see.\n\nAnd before my time, the mid-’60s time when Beefheart and those people were playing there, the Rolling Stones “Exile on Main Street” tour was at the Hollywood Palladium.\n\nThe Beach Boys’ live album from ‘74 was recorded at the Hollywood Palladium.\n\nThey coulda played anywhere.\n\nRight. But they played the Hollywood Palladium.\n\nThey could have played the Hollywood Bowl. They could have played the Forum.\n\nThey may have played the Forum around that time too. But I know they played Hollywood Palladium.\n\nDid you go to the Roxy?\n\nI went to the Roxy a lot in the late ‘70s? Yeah. 1976 to about ‘81 or something.\n\nI saw Bob Marley and the Wailers. How about that? And Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer. Burning Spear. I saw him too.\n\nYou’re a punk rock kid. But Bob Marley just cuts right through.\n\nWell, here’s the thing: today the punk rock kids think reggae is bullshit because the people who listen to reggae now are mostly classic rockers. And so they think reggae is bad.\n\nIt’s is even in Ghost World where Scarlett Johansson goes, “oh, that guy he’s looks good.”\n\nAnd he passes by and goes, “hey, let’s go listen to some reggae,” and then Thora Birch says “see he’s a dork.”\n\nAnd that’s pretty much a given for young contemporary kids who can’t even imagine — but in the ‘70s, punk and reggae were tight.\n\nWhat got you to go to Bob Marley at the Roxy?\n\nI first heard “Get Up Stand Up,” believe it or not on FM radio in the early ‘70s.\n\nThere was a lot of media buzz about reggae in the mid-’70s seventies. And I was interested because I used to read rock critics in those days.\n\nIn Dazed and Confused there was that one kid who like reads rock critics. That was me. I was reading Robert Hilburn.\n\nThere were a lot of people who were writing about punk at the LA Times in late ’70s: Don Waller was writing about it. Kristine McKenna used to write about punk and there were several others.\n\nAnd then what happened was Barry Manilow did a concert at the Universal Amphitheater and Hillburn wrote a scathing review of it.\n\n“I still think this guy hit his peak when he wrote the State Farm Insurance commercial. I wonder if they have a policy protecting us from sentimental sludge like this.” — Robert Hilburn on Barry Manilow, LA Times.\n\nThere was all kinds of letters from Barry Manilow fans the next week. “How could you say this about Barry Manilow? He’s popular! Blah, blah, blah. What’s wrong with you.”\n\nAnd then all these punk rockers and regular rock and roll people who would hate Barry Manilow wrote in.\n\nSo for about one year straight, the letters in the Calendar section of the LA Times was Manilow versus all other rock and roll. Whether it was punk or hard rock, all these people would write in “Barry Manilow’s awful because…” and they would back up Robert Hilburn’s review.\n\nAnd eventually what the LA Times did was they said, “that’s it! No more writing about punk rock. Hilburn you’re way off the base.”\n\nSo eventually what ended up happening was Patrick Goldstein was the only guy who would write about anything interesting. And he only had a little column called Pop Eye. If you wanted to find out what was going on in the LA Times, you weren’t going to, except for Pat Goldstein for quite a few years there.\n\nAnd then what happened, in 1991, the year punk broke, the year of Nirvana, the year of the indie rock thing happening in the ‘90s, a writer at the LA Times (who I will not mention) said to me when I called them up and I had a show going on with a bunch of indie artists — a massive bill with a bunch of great indie artists. And he goes, “well, you know, we have an edict now at the Times that we can’t cover any bands that are not on a major label.\n\nThe bottom line is they were so out-of-step with what was going on. And now it’s like, it seems like the Los Angeles Times really suffered because their music section was so bad.\n\nEverybody would say, “oh, the LA Times sucks now.” And they would ignore the front page and all the good writers on the front page and the other sections, because they hated the rock section so much.\n\nLet’s get into the Beach Boys because you’re an expert. Is that what you would consider yourself?\n\nAn expert on the Beach Boys until about like the mid-’70s or something like that. After that, I mean, I kept up with them for a little while, but it became impossible because there was no good music coming from them.\n\nI didn’t plan on talking about drugs. But I’m glad we did because writing a book about their most psychedelic album, Smile, is kind of interesting to me that somebody who… well, did you listen to it when you were on shrooms that one time?\n\nUm, wow. I’ve got to think back.\n\nMaybe because of your experience on shrooms, you could then, maybe, appreciate it more?\n\nI’ve liked psychedelic music all the way back in the ‘60s when I was a six year old kid. You don’t have to be on drugs to appreciate psychedelic music and every single six year-old with yellow submarine socks today is living proof of that.\n\nExcellent point. The Banana Splits were my favorite cartoon show when I was a kid.\n\nOh man. See, all the kids cartoons from the late ‘60s, like the Cattanooga Cats, which Becky, my girlfriend and I really love, because they had a lot of great psychedelic pop art done by this guy, Iwao Takamoto, who was Hanna-Barbera’s top animator. And he did Scooby-Doo, too.\n\nSo there was all this kind of psychedelic… look at The Mystery Machine, for example. That’s a psychedelic bus. The whole world was on acid at that time. So you don’t have to be.\n\nBut Smile is what you brought up. I was a kid, I remember hearing, The Beach Boys early hits when they were brand new and I can prove it from the records my sister used to have — I kept them.\n\n[Domenic shows some of his massive collection]\n\nI’ve got Surfing Safari and all that stuff. They’re here. Surfer Girl, Surfin USA.\n\nWow. Look at that cover. Is that’s what inspired The Cars for Candy-O?\n\nSurprisingly, he didn’t use RCA studios so much.\n\nThe Rolling Stones would fly 8,000 miles from England to cut all their new records at RCA. “Satisfaction” was recorded there. “The Last Time,” “Paint It Black” was recorded there. The whole Aftermath album was recorded there.\n\nSo the Stones would fly to record in Hollywood? By the way, I don’t think the Beach Boys used Studio A in Capitol Records.\n\nBrian didn’t think it was good for rock and roll. He used Western instead.\n\nAre there any really good guitar solos on the Beach Boys records that are done by any of the Beach Boys?\n\nYeah, Carl Wilson. “Surfing Safari,” I think that busts. I thought it busted out in those days.\n\n“Surfin USA,” — it’s got an organ solo and then a very short guitar solo. But he rips!\n\nI ask because when people educate you and tell you “yeah The Monkees didn’t play all their instruments on their records.” And we hear that Brian used the Wrecking Crew.\n\nSo when we’re kids we just assume the band is playing. But then when we hear that these great, talented, studio musicians are involved, then we don’t know. Which is why I’m asking you how good was Carl?\n\nIt’s confusing. Carl Wilson was an important musician in the band.\n\nAnd I think, outside of Brian, Brian would reference Carl all the time.\n\nCarl was probably the most voice of reason, even in the early days, like when he was 15 or something like that.\n\nBut you know, the Beach Boys second album, Surfin USA, was the album that broke them nationally and made them into the most popular group in America.\n\nHalf of the album is surf instrumentals that Carl Wilson played and he played pretty good.\n\nInterestingly enough ”Misirlou,” which isn’t better than Dick Dale’s version or anything — there are several versions better than the Beach Boys’ version. However, during the solo, the Dick Dale version has a trumpet in it. Carl plays the trumpet solo on guitar, and it’s a really neat transference. So he was not incapable of that stuff.\n\nNow I’m going to give you one record that maybe a lot of people today would think was a Wrecking Crew thing. And that was “Don’t Worry, Baby.”\n\nWell, Dennis Wilson played drums on it, Carl played guitar, Al played — and the Beach Boys played on “Don’t Worry, Baby.”\n\nSo if he used the Wrecking Crew or if he didn’t use the Wrecking Crew, Brian still got out of those guys something that powerful."
