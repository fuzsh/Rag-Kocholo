        "text": "BOZEMAN — The Montana State football team had just won a national title, but that didn’t faze Craig Kilborn.\n\nIt was the mid-1980s, when Kilborn played basketball at MSU. By then, Kilborn was known around campus for his sense of humor, so MSU boosters asked him to guest host one of their luncheons. When he got on the mic, he decided to roast the football coaches.\n\n“Here he is, some young college kid, basketball player, and he had the audacity to do that,” said Jeff Epperly, Kilborn’s teammate at MSU. “But that was Craig. He just had a lot of confidence in himself and his abilities and was unafraid, totally unafraid.”\n\nThe roast provided a preview of Kilborn’s future. After graduating from MSU, he anchored ESPN’s SportsCenter during the show’s golden era, then became the first host of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show. As Jon Stewart steered The Daily Show’s ascension, Kilborn hosted The Late Late Show, appearing on CBS right after David Letterman.\n\n“He was at the top of the world in a short period of time,” said Stu Starner, who coached Kilborn at MSU. “He is one of our most successful former players.”\n\nKilborn’s last episode as a late-night host aired 20 years ago, when he was in his early 40s. The bright blonde hair that graced millions of televisions in the 1990s and 2000s now glimmers with silver. His visibility is mainly limited to Instagram. He’s done little to regain the fame he once possessed.\n\nKilborn’s reasons for leaving his high-profile TV career are simultaneously simple and complex. His four years in Bozeman provided some clues as to why he stepped out of the spotlight.\n\n“My old agent, I don't think he comprehends why I left. I never explained it to him fully,” Kilborn told 406 MT Sports in May. “I just didn't want to do it anymore, and if that meant being retired for the rest of my life, then I gladly accept that.”\n\n‘Played in the wrong era’\n\nKilborn was born in Kansas City, lived in New Jersey for a brief period and moved to Hastings, Minnesota, in kindergarten. He grew into a 6-foot-6 basketball standout in the small Twin Cities suburb.\n\n“I'm loyal to Minnesota,” Kilborn said. “I had a happy childhood. I love the teams there. I loved growing up there. I'm proud to be from there.”\n\nAs a high school senior in the late 1970s, Kilborn received interest from college coaches such as Digger Phelps (then at Notre Dame), Jim Dutcher (Minnesota), Norm Stewart (Missouri) and future Minnesota Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders (then at Golden Valley Lutheran). Kilborn also received a visit from Mike Montgomery, who coached Montana.\n\nBut none were as aggressive as then-MSU assistant Stu Starner. Both he and head coach Bruce Haroldson liked Kilborn’s offensive creativity.\n\n“He was a unique player,” Starner said. “He was 6-6, gangly, not a great athlete. He was a ball handler. If you would say to him, ‘Who is your idol?’ he would say, ‘Pete Maravich.’”\n\nKilborn didn’t mind the distance from Hastings to Bozeman or the Montana winters, considering they were no colder than his hometown’s. He liked hiking, although Bozeman’s outdoorsy qualities didn’t really affect Kilborn’s decision, nor did anything else the town had to offer. He chose the Bobcats merely because “they recruited me harder than anybody else,” he said.\n\nBozeman grew on Kilborn during his four years there. He especially liked the Pickle Barrel, the Rocking R Bar and the Bacchus Pub.\n\n“Obviously it's a beautiful place out there,” Kilborn said. “I had a great time.”\n\nHe was well dressed, enjoyed “the finer things in life” and was friendly with all of his teammates, although he didn’t party much, Epperly said.\n\n“A lot of fun to be around. Great guy,” Epperly said, adding, “He loved to kid people. It was funny. The same kind of shtick he's had through the years, being in media, ESPN and everything, he was that same personality. That's Craig. We saw that back in college.”\n\nKilborn’s teammates called him “Killer,” partly as a play on his last name but mainly because of his play style, Epperly said. Kilborn was a self-described finesse player who loved to make Maravichian no-look passes and shoot 3-pointers. He compared his game to Luka Dončić’s and Paul Pierce’s, NBA players who became stars despite moving at a slower pace than most of their peers.\n\nKilborn also dealt with back problems, prompting one of his coaches to tell him, “You’ve got the body of a 42-year-old.” Defense was his shortcoming, per Starner.\n\n“I joke that the defensive stance hurt my lower back,” Kilborn said.\n\nDuring one season, Kilborn followed up a hot-shooting 20-point game with a 12-point performance. In another game, Kilborn impressed Starner — who became MSU’s head coach in 1983 — with a post entry pass.\n\n“Stu Starner got the team together, and he said, ‘Craig Kilborn feeds the post. He's the best passer on the team. He feeds the post better than you, Jeff, better than you, Phil, better than you, Bob,’” Kilborn said. “I appreciated it. (And I thought), ‘Play me more.’”\n\nBefore Kilborn’s senior season, Starner told him he’d probably fall victim to “the rule of 200.” A team can’t play more than five players at any given time, and there are 40 minutes in a college game, so the coaches have to figure out how to divvy up the 200 available minutes. Barring injury, Kilborn was unlikely to fill many of those minutes as a senior, Starner told him.\n\nKilborn didn’t agree with Starner’s allocation, but he knew there was little he could do to gain more playing time, so he left the team prior to his senior season. He finished his MSU career averaging 2.9 points, 1.0 assists and 1.1 rebounds per game.\n\n“You start thinking of all these different teams that were so physical, and that was basketball back then,” Epperly said. “No 3-point line, no shot clock for most of it, so (it was hard for) guys who were perimeter players, who could shoot, and Craig was one of those. Craig was finesse at 6-6 and a good shooter.\n\n“He might say it this way: ‘I played in the wrong era.’”\n\nLate night supernova\n\nLack of playing time wasn’t the only reason Kilborn quit basketball. He wanted to be an on-air talent, so he spent his senior year working for a local TV station.\n\nLonging for a city, Kilborn moved to San Francisco after graduating from MSU in 1985. After a year living with his brother there, he relocated to Georgia and became the play-by-play announcer for the Savannah Spirits of the Continental Basketball Association in 1986 and 1987. He then returned to California — first in Los Angeles, then Carmel — and worked as a TV sports anchor for several years.\n\n“In terms of him approaching the media and what he wanted to do, he was killer,” Epperly said. “He was very competitive in that realm, and maybe even a little bit more so than his basketball playing. So maybe the nickname fits a little bit more in his pursuit of that than basketball.”\n\nIn 1993, Kilborn accepted a SportsCenter anchor job offer and moved to Bristol, Connecticut. Kilborn, Keith Olbermann, Dan Patrick, Stewart Scott and Rich Eisen helped vault the ESPN highlight show into national prominence in the 1990s.\n\n“I was so proud,” Starner said. “It was amazing to turn on TV every night and, ‘Here is Craig.’”\n\nKilborn and Eisen reminisced about their time together on SportsCenter during an episode of The Rich Eisen Show in May. Eisen told a story — which he began by referring to Kilborn as “Killer” — about passing Kilborn on a stairwell in ESPN’s Bristol headquarters one day in the mid-1990s. Kilborn got to the door, stopped and gave Eisen a note about his on-air performance.\n\n“You said to me, ‘You’re doing a lot of stuff that I do.’ And then you walked away,” Eisen said before bursting into laughter.\n\n“It’s a huge compliment, I think,” Kilborn said with a laugh. “You took it as a compliment?”\n\n“You gave me what I was looking for,” Eisen replied.\n\n“An acknowledgement that you exist,” Kilborn joked.\n\n“That’s No. 1,” Eisen said. “No. 2: that you were yourself on the air, and you were yourself off the air.”\n\nEisen and Kilborn only hosted about two or three SportsCenter telecasts together, Eisen added. Kilborn enjoyed ESPN but had long wanted to be a late-night host. When Comedy Central offered him the The Daily Show job in 1996, he eagerly took it.\n\nKilborn hosted The Daily Show from its New York City studio from 1996-98. By the third year, he had grown tired of Comedy Central’s \"dysfunction,\" as he put it, and he didn’t love the show’s political focus.\n\n“I was raised not to talk about politics,” Kilborn said. “I'm a glorious independent, and I joke that I might be one of the most level-headed people in America. I like Barack Obama and I like Mitt Romney, and I also like Winston Churchill.”\n\nCBS asked Kilborn to take over The Late Late Show in 1998. It was a more traditional late night hosting job than The Daily Show, and it involved a move back to LA, a place he enjoyed residing about a decade earlier.\n\nIn 2001, Kilborn dedicated an episode of The Late Late Show to Montana by seating nearly 100 alumni and students from MSU in the studio audience.\n\n“He didn't get to be a basketball star, but in the end, look at what he's accomplished,” Starner said. “That’s to be admired.”\n\nKilborn’s Late Late Show run lasted longer than his previous two jobs, but not by much. He stepped away in 2004, largely because he was tired of dealing with behind-the-scenes silliness, he said.\n\nHe felt The Late Late Show was a placeholder that didn’t fully set him up for victory. He had to tiptoe around guests and couldn’t fully deploy his deadpan, sarcastic style of humor. The social commentary style of late night no longer stimulated him.\n\n“It was dysfunctional, and creatively, I got bored with late night,” Kilborn said, adding, “It was very cathartic and exhilarating to leave late night because I had accomplished my goal.”\n\n‘Life is gorgeous’\n\nIf a single video could capture Kilborn’s public persona since he left The Late Late Show, one he posted to Instagram on Feb. 15, 2023, wouldn’t be a bad pick.\n\nIt started the way most of his Instagram videos do: with a deep, satisfied breath, as if he’s trying to inhale as much air as possible. He then asked himself to provide some words of wisdom.\n\n“There is a mantra I like to tell the young people whenever I see them, which of course is rare because I’m usually in a French restaurant and they haven’t developed that palette yet,” Kilborn answered. “But when I go to a burger joint and I throw on a ballcap — and maybe a Ricky Rubio jersey — I like to tell the young people: breathe out the bitterness. Breathe it out. It’s no way to live, man. Don’t build your worldview on bitterness. Life is to be celebrated. Life is gorgeous. When I exhale, it’s like an ocean breeze of positivity.\n\n“But that’s a story for another day. There’s no reason to run up the score.”\n\nThe video finished with a clip of Rubio when he was a point guard for the Minnesota Timberwolves telling his teammate, “Change your face. Be happy. Enjoy.”\n\nInstagram has become one of Kilborn’s main creative outlets in recent years. He frequently eats at fancy restaurants. He’s a die-hard Timberwolves fan. The Kilborn who appears on his Instagram page, which has 64,000 followers, is well-dressed, self-satisfied and devoid of bitterness. The only thing missing from that February 2023 video was a martini.\n\n“My favorite thing I've done is my Instagram,” Kilborn said. “It's very creative. It's pretty simple.”\n\nKilborn grew up watching Johnny Carson, who hosted The Tonight Show from 1962-1992. Carson’s successor, Jay Leno, was the host for more than 20 years. Jimmy Fallon has hosted the show since 2014.\n\nIt’s been a similar story with The Late Show, which David Letterman hosted from 1993-2015 and Stephen Colbert has helmed since Letterman retired. Colbert used to host The Colbert Report, which aired on Comedy Central right after The Daily Show. Jon Stewart was The Daily Show’s host from 1999-2015, and he’s been the host on a weekly basis this year.\n\n“These guys want to do it. They love the attention. They love the whole thing,” Kilborn said. “If I wanted to do it, creatively, then you put up with all the silliness. You just ignore it.\n\n“But, creatively, I knew there was something else. And even though it's only my Instagram, that's my voice and my sensibility, and that's more satisfying.”\n\nKilborn has also hosted a podcast called “The Life Gorgeous” since 2022.\n\nAfter 2004, he occasionally did radio shows and made cameos on TV shows such as ABC’s “United We Fall\". He tried to get back into the talk-show game with The Kilborn File in 2010, but FOX canceled the show a few weeks after its debut.\n\nKilborn wrote a couple sitcoms, but they never reached the final stage. Doing so would’ve been “like hitting the lottery,” he said.\n\nHe quoted the actor Martin Mull (who recently died): “Hollywood is just high school with money.”\n\n“I didn't have a friend like Larry David,” Kilborn said. “In the town, they don't like it when you walk away. They hold it against you.”\n\nMoney wasn’t a major concern to Kilborn when he left The Late Late Show. He made enough in his SportsCenter and late-night careers to live comfortably for decades, and he’s invested well, he said.\n\nKilborn lives in Southern California with his longtime girlfriend, Cherry Alayra, a costume designer who’s worked on commercials and dressed musicians such as Sammy Hagar and Rod Stewart, per Kilborn. Kilborn has one child, Jon, who is 37 years old.\n\nKilborn is thinking about writing a book, but he has little desire to add more to his French food-filled plate.\n\n“I’m not addicted to the stage,” he said, “and I’m less accepting of dysfunction than most.”\n\nThe comedic voice Kilborn displays on Instagram was somewhat inspired by a piece he wrote for the Los Angeles Times in 2015. It was an interview with himself, full of compliments and references to his lavish diet.\n\nAbout midway through the “interview,” Kilborn wrote that he has a “unique sensibility, much of it built on refined taste, and my outlet is my personal life. I’m comfortable being the guy who walked away.”\n\nKilborn hasn’t visited Bozeman since he hosted The Late Late Show. One of his few trips back was a golf tournament hosted by MSU Hall of Fame kicker Jan Stenerud in the 1990s. Like basketball, Kilborn gave up golf a while ago.\n\nWhen he played at MSU, Kilborn “didn't tend to stay with things for very long,” Starner said. Kilborn recognizes this trend in his life, but he doesn’t analyze it much. Doing so might allow some bitterness to sneak into his lungs.\n\nEmail Victor Flores at victor.flores@406mtsports.com and follow him on Twitter/X at @VictorFlores406\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nVictor Flores\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
