        "text": "John William \"Johnny\" Carson (October 23, 1925 – January 23, 2005) was an American television host and comedian, known for thirty years as host of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962–1992).\n\nCarson was born in Corning, Iowa, in 1925, to Homer Lloyd \"Kit\" Carson, a power company manager, and Ruth (Hook) Carson, who was of Irish ancestry. He grew up in the nearby towns of Avoca, Clarinda, and Red Oak in southwest Iowa before moving to Norfolk, Nebraska, at the age of eight. At the age of twelve, Carson found a book on magic at a friend's house and immediately purchased a mail-order magician's kit. He debuted as \"The Great Carsoni\" at age 14 and he was paid US$3; many other performances at local picnics and country fairs followed.\n\nCarson joined the U.S. Navy on June 8, 1943, received V-12 officer training at Columbia University[1] and Millsaps College,[2] and continued to perform magic.\n\nCarson died in West Hollywood, California from respiratory failure caused by emphysema, aged 79.[3]\n\nQuotations related to Johnny Carson at Wikiquote\n\nMedia related to Johnny Carson at Wikimedia Commons\n\nJohnny Carson on IMDb\n\nJohnny Carson at the Internet Broadway Database\n\nOfficial website for The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson\n\n\"Article on Johnny Carson\".
