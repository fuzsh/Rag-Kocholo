        "text": "Longtime “Tonight Show” host Johnny Carson called this oceanfront estate in Malibu home.\n\nNow fashion magnate and film producer Sidney Kimmel and his wife Caroline, who bought the secluded, blufftop property in 2007, have put it on the market for $81.5 million.\n\nBuilt in 1980, the 7,083-square foot house is set on four acres. The home boasts an indoor arboretum topped with a 30-foot high glass ceiling, and the double triangle-shaped living room has a sunken copper and glass fireplace. Interiors include a formal dining room, updated chef’s kitchen and an elevator.\n\nThe master suite takes up a whole floor, with his and her bathrooms, walk-in closets and a pair of private offices.\n\nA lower entertainment level contains an outdoor lounge, indoor-outdoor dining room and a wine cellar, media room and bar.\n\nCarson was a tennis buff, and amid the estate’s manicured grounds is a championship court, as well as a bench from Wimbledon that was given to him by NBC as a gift to commemorate his retirement.\n\nA tennis pavilion with about 2,750 square feet has two guest suites, a gym, locker room and sauna. The estate also has an 843-square-foot guest house, plus access to the beach.\n\nCarson died in 2005 at age 79.\n\nSidney Kimmel founded Jones Apparel Group and Sidney Kimmel Entertainment, which produced such films as “Moneyball, “The Kite Runner,” “Lars and the Real Girl” and “United 93.” The Kimmels also are noted philanthropists.\n\nChris Cortazzo of Coldwell Banker Global Luxury and Linda May of Hilton & Hyland are the listing agents.\n\nDid you miss?\n\n‘Real Estate Wars,’ a reality TV show set in Orange County, premieres\n\nSee more Hot Homes here"
