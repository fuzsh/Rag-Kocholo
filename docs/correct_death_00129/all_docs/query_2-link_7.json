        "text": "Johnny Carson may have been best known for filming The Tonight Show at NBC's Rockefeller Center in New York City, but the television legend retired to Malibu before his death, in 2005. And now, the property that Carson lived in for nearly 20 years is on the market for $81.5 million.\n\nListed for the first time in 10 years, the estate spans 7,083 square feet and sits on about four acres of manicured grounds. The home was built in 1978 by architect Ed Niles and features panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean and beach access. The main house offers two bedrooms, two master baths—his and hers—and two additional baths and one half-bath. There's also a guest house with two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a gym. Outside, a waterfall, Koi pond, and saltwater pool offer a relaxing retreat from the California heat. And the standout feature is a championship tennis court with viewing area where Carson enjoyed countless matches. There's even a bench from Wimbledon gifted to Carson by NBC.\n\nCarson loved the sport so much that when he sold a different Malibu property to tennis star John McEnroe in the 1980s, there was reportedly a stipulation in the escrow agreement that McEnroe had to provide three one-hour lessons on top of the $2 million price tag."
