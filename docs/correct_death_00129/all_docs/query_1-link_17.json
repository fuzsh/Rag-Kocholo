        "text": "The history of Carlsbad, California, can stretch all the way back to a remote Spanish settlement founded during the 1700s. Spanish colonials had specifically established a cattle ranch along a section of a rural highway known at the time as the “Camino Royal.” The first Anglo Americans settled the region in the mid-19th century, who quickly adopted the ranching culture of their Mexican American neighbors. A sailor named John Frazier dug a well in the area around the same time and began offering its contents to passengers on the nearby Santa Fe Railway. Travelers subsequently took to calling the pitstop as “Frazier’s Station.” Other entrepreneurs followed suit and discovered a wealth of freshwater springs throughout the countryside. Research conducted at these bodies of water revealed that they possessed similar qualities to the springs of the Czech resort town of Karlsbad. As such, the hoteliers decided to rename Frazier’s Station as “Carlsbad,” in an attempt to encourage travel to their mineral wells. The site of John Frazier's original well can still be found at Alt Karlsbad, which is located on Carlsbad Boulevard.\n\nThroughout the 1880s and 1890s, efforts by the area’s hospitality specialists to generate tourism became far more sophisticated. The leader of that endeavor was a group of professionals that operated the Carlsbad Land and Mineral Water Company: Gerhard Schutte, Samuel Church Smith, D.D. Wadsworth, and Henry Nelson. They vigorously led a national marketing campaign that saw the number of visitors to the region explode throughout the Gilded Age. The arrival of more economic activity led to the development of more local industries, including large-scale commercial farms. Among the many different types of produce grown on those plantations were avocados, olives, and citrus fruits. Even though real estate prices collapsed at the end of the century, the local hospitality industry remained strong due to Carlsbad’s beautiful weather and proximity to the Pacific Ocean. Carlsbad continued to grow as such, becoming large enough to become one of southern California’s leading cities. Carlsbad is now a major player in the modern tech industry and is still known today for its many wonderful vacation retreats.\n\nFrank Sinatra, singer and actor part of the famous Rat Pat known for selling 150 million records worldwide.\n\nDean Martin, actor known for his roles in such films like Rio Bravo, The Wrecking Crew, and the original Ocean’s 11.\n\nBob Hope, comedian and patron of the United Service Organization (USO).\n\nCharlton Heston, actor known for his roles in such movies like Ben-Hur, El Cid, and Planet of the Apes.\n\nBing Crosby, world-famous singer and actor known for his roles in Going My Way and The Bells of St. Mary’s.\n\nLucille Ball, actress best known for her roles as Lucie Ricardo in the hit television show, I Love Lucy.\n\nJohnny Carson, comedian best remembered for hosting The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\n\nDesi Arnaz, actor and musician known for his role as Ricky Ricardo on the hit television show, I Love Lucy.\n\nSam Snead, winner of 7 major golf championships that include the PGA of America and Senior PGA Tour.\n\nRay Floyd, winner of 4 major golf championships that included the PGA Championship and the Masters Tournament.\n\nArnold Palmer, winner of 7 major golf championships that include the PGA Championship and the Masters Tournament.\n\nJack Nicklaus, winner of 18 major golf championships—the most of any professional golfer.\n\nEarl Warren, 14th Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court (1953 – 1969)\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis, First Lady to former U.S. President John F. Kennedy (1961 – 1963)\n\nRichard Nixon, 37th President of the United States (1969 – 1973)\n\n1963: La Costa founder Merv Adelson discovered the land during a horse ride through the coastal foothills. When he arrived at the peak of a hill, he looked down upon the valley and a crystal-clear vision superimposed itself over the scene before him. Adelson spent the previous decade in Las Vegas as a real estate developer, building golf courses, hotels, and office buildings then joined forces with his partners Irwin Molasky and Allard Roen to bring his vision to life.\n\n1964: As early as June, La Costa’s golf courses were nearing completion. The original 72-par, 7,200-yard course – designed by renowned architect Dick Wilson – covered 215 acres and cost $1.5 million. La Costa’s course led the pack in year-round playability thanks to San Diego’s one-of-a-kind weather. The greatest professional golfers of their day would eventually grace the links, including Sam Snead, Ray Floyd, Arnold Palmer, Bobby Nichols, and Jack Nicklaus.\n\n1965: A place where “every member of the family could play and live all year round in great style,” La Costa was originally conceived as a residential resort with activities and instruction for all ages. The 40 units were available to guests for $22 per night which included green, tennis, stable, and pool fees.\n\nAt the time it opened, the $3 million La Costa Spa was believed to be the largest and best equipped in the world. The physical inventory was impressive and unrivaled with swimming pools, volleyball courts, his and her gyms, saunas, and specialty mineral pools. The Spa was led by Dr. R. Phillip Smith, a professor of medicine, and became the first spa in the country to earn an endorsement from the American Medical Association.\n\n1970s: In a few short years, La Costa had become the go-to spot for Hollywood elite. The golf course received international praise and was routinely played by Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Bob Hope. In the early 1970s, the famed Pancho Segura was the resident pro, and La Costa became the tennis epicenter with Charlton Heston, Johnny Carson, and Desi Arnaz exchanging rallies during their visits. The crown jewel of La Costa, The Spa, was a refuge for some of the world’s most powerful people including Richard Nixon, Jackie Kennedy, and Chief Justice Earl Warren.\n\n1984: Championship caliber golf and tennis tournaments settled into La Costa throughout the 1980s. The resort continued to host the Tournament of Champions while tennis gained momentum with The Davis Cup and the Carl Reiner Celebrity Tennis Tournament. In 1984 an additional nine holes were built, bringing the total to 36 and creating two unique courses–the North and the South, which are now known as Champions and Legends.\n\n1998: The Tournament of Champions was hosted at La Costa since 1969 and ended its final round in 1998. Long considered the Super Bowl of Golf, players had to win a PGA Tour event the preceding year in order to qualify. Champions included some of the greatest players in history like Gary Player, Tom Watson, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.\n\n1999: The World Golf Championships was played on the original course layout with the opening nine composed of holes 10 through 18 on the Legends Course while the closing nine consisted of holes one through three and 13 through 18 on the Champions Course. The five-day televised event raised more than $500,000 for local charities.\n\n2003: Omni La Costa received an extensive $140 million restoration. The newly designed $12 million spa included a 28,000 square foot Spanish Colonial building and an additional 15,000 square feet of fragrant gardens and courtyards. La Costa’s golf courses were renovated, a brand-new ballroom was added, and new partnerships were forged with Deepak Chopra and The Chopra Center.\n\n2013: Omni Hotels and Resorts purchased the Omni La Costa nearly a decade after undergoing its last round of renovations. The resort then joined Historic Hotels of America, as well as its sibling program, Historic Hotels Worldwide. It subsequently received numerous awards and accolades from top travel publications like Condé Nast Traveler, Travel + Leisure, Spa Finder, and Golfweek. Omni La Costa even expanded upon its various partnership, including the PFC Fitness Camp."
