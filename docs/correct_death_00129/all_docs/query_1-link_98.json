All rights reserved.\n\nCher will tell her \"true story in intimate detail\" in a new two-part memoir.\n\nThe 78-year-old pop superstar inked a deal with HarperCollins Publishers to put pen to paper and lift the lid on her life in showbusiness in her first ever book and it's now been revealed she will release it in two parts with the first volume - titled 'Cher: The Memoir, Part One' - scheduled to hit shelves in November.\n\nA statement from the publishers explained the singer's life is too \"immense\" to be crammed into just one book. It reads: \"'Cher: The Memoir' reveals the daughter, the sister, the wife, the lover, the mother and the superstar. It is a life too immense for only one book.\n\n\"The extraordinary life of Cher can be told by only one person … Cher herself. After more than seventy years of fighting to live her life on her own terms, Cher finally reveals her true story in intimate detail.\n\n\"Her remarkable career is unique and unparalleled.\"\n\nThe statement revealed Cher will cover her seven decades of chart success as well as her \"chaotic\" upbringing, her \"difficult\" relationship with her mother and her doomed marriage to Sonny Bono.\n\nIt added: \"With her trademark honesty and humour, 'Cher: The Memoir' traces how this diamond in the rough succeeded with no plan and little confidence to become the trailblazing superstar the world has been unable to ignore for more than half a century.\n\n\"'Cher: The Memoir, Part One' follows her extraordinary beginnings through childhood to meeting and marrying Sonny Bono – and reveals the highly complicated relationship that made them world-famous, but eventually drove them apart.\"\n\n'Cher: The Memoir, Part One' will be released on November 19 with part two to follow in 2025.\n\nThe singer previously confirmed she had signed a deal to write her first memoir, but during an appearance on 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon' last year, Cher admitted the project had stalled.\n\nShe said: \"I just totally chickened out. I didn’t put in some things that needed to be put in. And they’re not comfortable, but they need to be put in so I have to go back and man up ...\n\n\"I’ve lived too long and done too much and so it’s like it should be the encyclopaedia.\"\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus' expletive-filled rant to Firerose leaked\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus rant leaked\n\nPhoto: BANG Showbiz. All rights reserved.\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus branded Firerose \"dumb\" and \"selfish\" in an expletive-filled rant.\n\nThe 'Achy Breaky Heart' hitmaker's estranged wife has accused the 62-year-old singer of subjecting her to months of \"extreme verbal, emotional and psychological abuse\" and a new audio tape seems to back up her allegations as he berated her during a row that appeared to be related to his timings for a performance.\n\nAudio obtained by DailyMail.com and Us Weekly magazine hears Billy say: “I needed to leave two hours ago.\"\n\nFirerose replied: \"No you didn’t, you can still leave.”\n\nHer spouse then yelled: “Get the f*** out of here. I had to go when I was ready to go. If you had just shut the f–k up …”\n\nThe Australian singer then urged the country star to \"please stop screaming\" at her, which only further infuriated him.\n\nHe ranted in response: “If you would’ve left it the f*** alone. If you would’ve left it alone when I told you, it’s done. Now I’m really f****** p*****. You once again showed me you will not listen. I don’t know who the f*** you think you are but you will not f****** listen.\n\n“This ain’t about your BRCA, this ain’t about your surgery, this ain’t about nothing. This is about you being a f****** selfish b****.”\n\nThe 'Some Gave All' singer then declared he didn't think his wife was \"real smart\".\n\nHe added: “I’ve changed my damn mind on that s***. What you are is a selfish b****.\n\n“You cannot continue to walk all over me and think that I’m going to go out in public with your dumb a** and f****** have you do this s*** anywhere you want in front of whomever.\"\n\nFirerose then asked if her spouse was referring to “screaming at me right now,” and he replied, “This would not be happening if you were to just shut your f****** mouth. Look what a f****** mess you’ve made. What a dumba** f****** thing to do.”\n\nThe 35-year-old beauty insisted she just wanted the country star to be \"happy\" but he retorted: “No. F*** you. F*** you. You know better than that. F****** idiot.”\n\nFirerose previously claimed she found Billy Ray's rants \"terrifying\".\n\nShe told the New York Post newspaper's Page Six column last month: “He would rage at me, shout at me at the top of his lungs. He would terrify me, yelling, ‘You stupid dumb f****** b****, crazy w****.\n\n\"It was illogical and insane and terrifying.”\n\nAnd after Billy Ray's lawyers made public a handwritten note allegedly from his estranged wife in which she begged for “a chance to make this right\", Firerose insisted it didn't mean he hadn't been abusive.\n\nShe said: “He’s attempting to use my loving notes as proof that he could not have been abusing me because I love him. But it’s because you love them that you tolerate this behaviour.\n\nBilly Ray has previously “vehemently” denied allegations that he was abusive toward Firerose and he himself is accusing her of abuse in his own court documents.\n\nChet Hanks felt 'worthless'\n\nPhoto: BANG Showbiz. All rights reserved.\n\nChet Hanks grew up feeling \"completely worthless\".\n\nThe 33-year-old actor - who is the son of Hollywood stars Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson -was desperate to make friends when he was young but struggled to connect to people because they expected him to be \"arrogant\" due to his famous parents, and he didn't want to present a \"meek and timid\" front to combat their preconceptions.\n\nSpeaking to his celebrity housemates on 'Surreal Life: Villa of Secrets', Chet said: \"I’ll tell you something about my childhood. People think that being Tom Hanks’ son, like, I would grow up feeling like I was the s***.\n\n“I actually grew up feeling completely f****** worthless.\n\n“People treated me like, ‘You must think you’re better than me’ when I didn’t. I just wanted to be friends with everybody and be treated like everybody else.\n\n“But what am I supposed to do? Walk through the doors and be all meek and timid? That was a mind f*** for me to deal with.\n\n“If you do walk in through the door and you’re like, ‘Here I am motherf*****’ then it’s like, ‘Oh look at you arrogant son of a b****.’ I did internalise all that negativity. Maybe I am f****** worthless, you know what I’m saying?”\n\nChet had to \"battle\" to get the confidence to meet people.\n\nHe said: \"It was a battle for me mentally and emotionally just to be able to walk outside, look someone in the eye and say, ‘What’s up? I’m Chet.’”\n\nThe former 'Empire' actor has previously been treated for addiction and he recently admitted life has become \"extremely easy\" since he got sober almost three years ago.\n\nHe told People magazine: \"I'm ready for people to see that I'm just a regular guy. That’s why I signed up for 'Surreal Life: Villa of Secrets'. It was honestly one of the best experiences of my life, and I'm not just saying that. I had a blast, and I would do it again in a heartbeat.\n\n\"There was a little drama, but not much!\n\n\"One hundred percent. None of this would be possible without sobriety. It's not difficult at all. What's difficult is when you're trying to manage your life and you're not sober, that's what's difficult. When you just commit and decide and you stick to it, it's not even something that you negotiate with. It's just a non-negotiable. And life becomes extremely easy.\"\n\nProsecutor says the New Jersey man who stabbed author Salman Rushdie was trying to carry out a fatwa\n\nAttacker carrying out fatwa?\n\nPhoto: The Canadian Press\n\nFILE - Defense attorney Nathaniel Barone, left, and Hadi Matar, 24, right, listen during an arraignment in the Chautauqua County Courthouse in Mayville, NY., Thursday, Aug. 18, 2022. Matar, who severely injured author Salman Rushdie in a frenzied knife attack in western New York faces a new charge that he supported a terrorist group. An indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court in Buffalo on Wednesday, July 24, 2024, charges Matar with providing material support to Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon and backed by Iran. (AP Photo/Joshua Bessex, File)\n\nA man who severely injured author Salman Rushdie in a frenzied knife attack in western New York was motivated by a Hezbollah leader's endorsement of a fatwa calling for Rushdie's death, prosecutors said Wednesday in announcing new terrorism charges.\n\nThe three-count indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court in Buffalo offered for the first time a potential motive for the 2022 attack on “The Satanic Verses” author.\n\nHadi Matar, a U.S. citizen from New Jersey, was attempting to carry out a fatwa, Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Kruly said. According to the prosecutor, Matar believed the call for Rushdie's death, first issued in 1989, was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group’s secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah.\n\n\"We allege that in attempting to murder Salman Rushdie in New York in 2022, Hadi Matar committed an act of terrorism in the name of Hezbollah, a designated terrorist organization aligned with the Iranian regime,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a news release. “The Justice Department will prosecute those who perpetrate violence in the name of terrorist groups and undermine the basic freedoms enshrined in our Constitution.”\n\nMatar, who faces separate state charges of attempted murder and assault, pleaded not guilty to the new federal charges of terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization.\n\n“The investigation was lengthy, for the last two years, and I’m sure involved a number of different agencies, a number of different countries and a number of individuals,” Matar’s attorney, Nathaniel Barone, said after the arraignment. He said the federal case will be far more complex than the state charges, which focus largely on the assault on Rushdie while he was onstage and about to give a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution in August 2022.\n\n“Federally, you're looking at more of conspiracies,” the lawyer said.\n\nMatar, he said, “plans on proceeding with a vigorous defense and maintain his innocence.”\n\nMatar, 26, has been held without bail since the attack, during which he stabbed Rushdie more than a dozen times before a stunned audience of about 1,500 people. Knife wounds blinded Rushdie in one eye. The event moderator, Henry Reese, was also wounded before bystanders subdued the assailant.\n\n“This defendant put time and effort into traveling to the western district of New York with the intent of taking the life of another,” U.S. Attorney Trini Ross said. “Only because of the brave efforts of those who were present that day, the defendant was prevented from completing his murderous intention.\"\n\nRushdie detailed the attack and his long and painful recovery in a memoir published in April.\n\nThe federal charges come after Matar earlier this month rejected an offer by state prosecutors to recommend a shorter prison sentence if he agreed to plead guilty to both state and the anticipated federal charges. Instead, both cases will now proceed to trial separately. Jury selection in the state case is set for Oct. 15.\n\nA detention hearing in the federal case is scheduled for Aug. 7.\n\nThe author spent years in hiding after the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa in 1989 calling for Rushdie's death over his novel “The Satanic Verses.” Khomeini considered the book blasphemous. Rushdie reemerged into the public in the late 1990s.\n\nMatar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. He lived in Fairview, New Jersey, prior to the attack. His mother has said that her son became withdrawn and moody after he visited his father in Lebanon in 2018.\n\nThe attack raised questions about whether Rushdie had gotten proper security protection, given that he is still the subject of death threats. A state police trooper and county sheriff's deputy had been assigned to the lecture. In 1991, a Japanese translator of “The Satanic Verses” was stabbed to death. An Italian translator survived a knife attack the same year. In 1993, the book’s Norwegian publisher was shot three times but survived.\n\nThe investigation into Rushdie's stabbing focused partly on whether Matar had been acting alone or in concert with militant or religious groups.\n\nAndrew Tate's defamation lawsuit against human trafficking accuser can go to trial, judge says\n\nTate's lawsuit can proceed\n\nPhoto: The Canadian Press\n\nFILE - Andrew Tate arrives at the Court of Appeals building in Bucharest, Romania, Thursday, May 30, 2024. A judge says controversial social media personality Tate's defamation lawsuit against a Florida woman who accused him of imprisoning her in Romania can go to trial. (AP Photo/Andreea Alexandru, File)\n\nA judge says controversial social media personality Andrew Tate's defamation lawsuit against a Florida woman who accused him of imprisoning her in Romania can go to trial, but he threw out Tate's allegations against her parents and some allegations against the woman.\n\nPalm Beach County Circuit Judge Joseph Curley ruled that the widely followed former professional kickboxer, 37, and his brother, Tristan, 36, can present their allegations to a jury that the woman in 2022 enlisted another woman in a plot to extort money from them.\n\nThe British-American brothers say the woman falsely accused them of human trafficking and rape, costing them their freedom and millions of dollars in income from their lucrative social media, podcasting and business ventures. Romanian officials indicted the Tates last year, saying the brothers forced seven victims into pornography and subjected them to physical violence.\n\nHer attorneys say the lawsuit is in retribution for her reporting him to authorities. The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted.\n\nCurley said in last week's ruling, posted to online court records Tuesday, that the Tates' attorneys have shown enough possible evidence that the woman defamed their clients and was attempting to defraud and extort them to warrant a trial. He pointed to April 2022 text messages the woman and her friend exchanged where they say they will ask the Tates for $200,000 and “act like we still love them and stuff.\"\n\nCurley also pointed to other text messages that could indicate the woman knew she falsely accused the Tates of sex trafficking and false imprisonment. No trial date has been set and because of discovery and legal challenges it could be years before one occurs.\n\nCurley did throw out parts of the lawsuit accusing the woman of false imprisonment for the Tates being arrested, intentional infliction of emotional distress and interfering with their business relationships. He left the door open to their attorneys amending and refiling those accusations.\n\nCurley dismissed the Tates’ accusations that the woman’s parents defamed them when they told American diplomatic officials about their daughter’s allegations. He said they had no reason to believe their daughter's accusations were false and had a right to report them.\n\nAttorneys for the Tates and the woman each said Curley's decision was a win for their side.\n\nTate attorney Joseph McBride said they are “most pleased with Judge Curley's ruling\" as the defamation accusation directly addresses the “plot to destroy Andrew and Tristan Tate's lives.” He said no decision has been made on whether to amend and refile the dismissed accusations.\n\nThe National Center on Sexual Exploitation Law, which represents the woman and her parents, called Curley's ruling a “huge victory.\"\n\n“We are very pleased the Court has tossed out the majority of this frivolous lawsuit and wisely narrowed the issues and claims,” attorney Dani Pinter said in a statement. \"If the case proceeds, we look forward to the opportunity to prove the truth of what occurred in Romania, and we are confident that ultimately we will succeed and this harassing lawsuit will fail.”\n\nRomanian investigators said in their indictment that the Tates and two Romanian women formed a criminal group in 2021 “in order to commit the crime of human trafficking” in that country, the United States and Britain. Prosecutors also confiscated the Tates’ assets, including 15 luxury cars, luxury watches and about $3 million in cryptocurrency.\n\nInvestigators say the seven accusers were recruited with false declarations of love, but then forced to take part in pornography. The women were controlled by “intimidation, constant surveillance” and claims they were in debt, officials said.\n\nBut the Tates, in their lawsuit, paint a different picture. They say the Florida woman and all women who lived at their estate were free to come and go as they pleased, and closed-circuit security video can prove it.\n\nEarlier this month, a Romanian judge lifted a year-long bar on the Tates leaving that country, but said they must stay within the European Union while they await trial.\n\n“THE SHAM CASE IS FALLING APART,” Andrew Tate wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nAndrew Tate has been banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook after the platforms accused him of posting hate speech and misogynistic comments, including that women should bear responsibility for being sexually assaulted. But he remains popular on X, with almost 10 million followers, many of them young men and schoolchildren. He runs an online academy where he says he teaches young men how to get rich and attract women.\n\nSeveral women in Britain also are pursuing civil claims against Andrew Tate, alleging they were victims of sexual violence. British authorities have charged the Tates criminally with sexual aggression. Details have not been disclosed.\n\nIn a 2023 interview with the BBC, Andrew Tate denied spreading a culture of misogyny and accusations that he manipulated women for financial gain.\n\nJohn Mayall, tireless and influential British blues pioneer, dies at 90\n\nJohn Mayall dies at 90\n\nPhoto: The Canadian Press\n\nFILE - English blues singer John Mayall performs with his band The Bluesbreakers, on the stage of the Miles Davis hall during the 42nd Montreux Jazz Festival in Montreux, Switzerland, late Monday, July 7, 2008.

(Sandro Campardo/Keystone via AP, File)\n\nJohn Mayall, the British blues musician whose influential band the Bluesbreakers was a training ground for Eric Clapton, Mick Fleetwood and many other superstars, has died. He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. “Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world’s greatest road warriors,” the post said.\n\nAmong this year's new members of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, he is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; and Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat.\n\nClapton and McVie both played on the 1966 release “Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,” which Rolling Stone magazine has ranked among the 500 greatest albums.\n\n“He was a great pioneer of British blues and had a wonderful eye for talented musicians,” Mick Jagger wrote on X, adding that it was Mayall who recommended Taylor as a replacement in 1969 for founding Stones guitarist Brian Jones, “ushering in a new era” for the band.\n\nMayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\n\n\"I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band — who can be good friends of mine,\" Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nThough Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album “The Sun Is Shining Down.” He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n“Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it’s really for neither of those two things, it’s just for the love of the music,” he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. “I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.”\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, “The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that’s where his favorite pub was.”\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time — a year on the left hand, a year on the right, “so I wouldn’t get all tangled up.”\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, “Blues Alone.”\n\nMayall was often called the “father of British blues,” but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall’s biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds’ commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had “the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.”\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton’s waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that “to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,”\n\n“I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,” Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n“You’d have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,” Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. “You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.”\n\nMayall’s 1968 album “Blues from Laurel Canyon” markeda permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released “The Turning Point,” arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. “Room to Move,” a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall’s later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n“Throughout the ’70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,” Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed — shattering one of Mayall’s heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n“That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,” Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\n'Deadpool & Wolverine' is here to shake up the Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\nShaking up Marvel universe\n\nPhoto: The Canadian Press\n\nThis image released by 20th Century Studios/Marvel Studios shows Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool/Wade Wilson and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine/Logan in a scene from \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\" (20th Century Studios/Marvel Studios via AP)\n\nShawn Levy is no novice when it comes to rumors around his projects. Years on “Stranger Things” taught him how to tune out the noise. Yet even he’s found himself astonished by the sheer volume of speculation around “Deadpool & Wolverine.”\n\n“The rumors around this movie are overwhelming,” Levy told The Associated Press earlier this year. “But so is the anticipation, which is a nice situation.”\n\nAnticipation might be an understatement for a movie that is poised to be the theatrical event of the summer, when it opens on Thursday.\n\nThe first trailer, which aired during the Super Bowl, was viewed a record 365 million times online in its first 24 hours. The second broke another record — for the most “F-bombs” in the MCU (six in less than three minutes).\n\nMuch of that excitement is because this film marks the first time Ryan Reynolds’ foul-mouthed Deadpool/Wade Wilson and Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine are being folded into Kevin Feige’s Marvel Cinematic Universe. Both properties existed previously under the 21st Century Fox banner.\n\nWhen Disney acquired the studio’s film and TV assets in early 2019, Wolverine had already died in “Logan,” a third “Deadpool” was in development and Marvel was still firmly in the PG-13 business, a rating that allows for only one F-bomb.\n\nOn a call with investors as the deal was going through, Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger was already reassuring people that a Disney Deadpool would remain R-rated. Soon after, Reynolds also posted a photo on social media showing his character with Mickey Mouse ears on a yellow school bus labeled “Disney.” The meta humor, it seemed, was also firmly intact.\n\nBut what would the story be? Levy was announced as the film’s director in early 2022, coming in as a fan of Reynolds’ snarky tone and fourth wall breaking.\n\n“There was no way I was going to reinvent a wheel, a tonal wheel, that works so beautifully,” Levy said. “Both Disney and Marvel, up and down the food chain, empowered Ryan and I to make this movie exactly as we dreamed.”\n\nWAIT, HOW IS WOLVERINE HERE?\n\nThings really started to really take shape when Jackman signed on that fall, however. It would mark the first time that the characters would be together in a movie since 2009’s “X-Men Origins: Wolverine.” In the years since, Reynolds and Jackman have staged a very tongue in cheek, very funny “feud” with one another on social media, dancing around the idea of sharing the big screen again.\n\nThe dream seemed to have died after “Logan” and Jackman’s retirement as Wolverine. But death is never exactly final in the multiverse, and, they promised, this film would not interfere with “Logan.”\n\n“It’s a really interesting duo,” Levy said. “They’re built for huge conflict with each other because they’re so different individually. But that makes for a very interesting story, because the best two hander stories, whether it’s ‘Midnight Run’ or ‘48 Hours’ or ‘Planes, Trains and Automobiles,’ yes, it’s littered with conflict. But it’s ultimately about something more as well and that’s what audiences will see.”\n\nThe dynamic was also fueled by the real-life friendship between Levy, Jackman and Reynolds that goes back a decade off screen and includes films like “Free Guy” and “Real Steel.”\n\n“The real benefit of being friends off set is that you can try crazy stuff without fear of falling. Because some of it won’t work and that will be momentarily embarrassing, but if you’re among friends, it’s okay to make a fool of yourself in the pursuit of something surprising and something unexpected,” Levy said. “This movie is filled with moments, both comedic and character based, that we didn’t expect and were the result of a freedom that that came from being friends.”\n\nAt the New York premiere Monday, Jackman and Reynolds were definitely in friend mode, praising one another with no snark.\n\n“(Ryan’s) exactly as you think,\" Jackman said. “An extraordinary man. Generous, humble brilliant and a great friend.”\n\nReynolds added that Jackman was “someone who operated in a completely different way, did everything through the prism of genuine kindness, diligence, hard work. And that was modeled to me in 2008 when we did our first movie together. And we’ve been best buddies ever since.”\n\nIT’S SUMMER. NO HOMEWORK REQUIRED.\n\nThe Marvel multiverse has gotten a bit overwhelming in recent years for the more casual fans who may have seen most of the films but only dabbled in the Disney+ offerings that regularly introduce new concepts and characters that eventually find their way into the films. “Deadpool & Wolverine,” for instance, uses the Time Variance Authority (TVA) — a major part of “Loki” but new to the movies — to help get Deadpool to the MCU. But Levy promises that enjoyment of “Deadpool & Wolverine” requires no bingeing or studying beforehand.\n\n\"I was a good student in school. I’ll do my homework as an adult. But I am definitely not looking to do homework when I go to the movies,” Levy said.\n\n“I very much made this film with certainly a healthy respect and gratitude towards the rabid fan base that has peak fluency in the mythology and lore of these characters and this world. But I didn’t want to presume that. This movie is built for entertainment, with no obligation to come prepared with prior research.”\n\nOH, RIGHT, THE MOVIE...\n\nSo, what about what’s IN the film? Well, that’s something that Levy won't really talk about. Until Monday’s premiere, reporters were only allowed to see 40 minutes; Soon the floodgates will open and spoilers will take over social media.\n\nBut “Deadpool & Wolverine” hasn't needed to tease out plotlines to stoke enthusiasm. The fans are already there and ready, whether or not Taylor Swift is involved (by all accounts, she's not).\n\nMarvel has had some Phase 5 bumps, with films like “The Marvels” underperforming financially and others underwhelming critics. And outside of the MCU, the industry is feeling the pains of so-called “superhero fatigue” that has sent DC back to the drawing boards to start anew. But “Deadpool & Wolverine” is not to be underestimated.\n\nCritics have been largely positive too. AP's Krysta Fauria wrote in her review that the film “leans into its genre more than the franchise’s first two movies.\" She cautions that the plot starts to feel a little aimless toward the end, but that, “The bloody but comedic final fight scene ... is enough to perk viewers back up for the last act, solidifying the film’s identity as a fun, generally well-made summer movie.”\n\nAnd it could be the first MCU movie since “Spider-Man: No Way Home” to crack $1 billion, which would also put it in the running to become the highest grossing R-rated film of all time. That title currently belongs to “Joker” with its $1.08 billion. It’s currently tracking to open around $160 million, but some bullish analysts are forecasting as high as $200 million. To beat “Barbie's\" opening last year, it has to surpass $162 million.\n\n“Audiences are hungry for a great time at the movies,” Levy said. “They want to be delighted, transported and entertained. And when they are given that, whether it’s ‘Barbie,’ ‘Oppenheimer’ or any number of other recent movies, they show up.”\n\nHe added: “The movie is built for audience delight. I think that (they’re) in for a very fun ride.”\n\nThe Weeknd serves up first preview of new music as new era draws closer\n\nA tease from The Weeknd\n\nPhoto: BANG Showbiz. All rights reserved.\n\nThe Weeknd has given fans a two-minute preview of new music.\n\nAhead of a one-off concert in São Paulo, Brazil, where the 34-year-old singer is set to debut a brand-new production that will differ from his 'After Hours Til Dawn Tour' of 2022 and 2023, the 'Die For You' singer has posted a cinematic trailer.\n\nQuoting German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, he captioned the clip - which comes with an epilepsy warning due to flashing imagery - on Instagram: “When you gaze long enough into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you…”\n\nThe gig takes place on September 7, at the Estádio MorumBIS soccer stadium.\n\nTicket prices include a $1 donation to The Weeknd’s XO Humanitarian Fund, which provides food and support to those in poverty, in partnership with the United Nations.\n\nThe 'Popular' hitmaker - whose real name is Abel Tesfaye - has been cryptically teasing the third album in his ‘After Hours’/’Dawn FM’ trilogy, which will mark his sixth studio album.\n\nAmong the posts were pictures of his silhouettes with the words: “Pain, regret, rebirth.\"\n\nLast June, the 'Blinding Lights' hitmaker teased that the title would be unveiled \"soon\".\n\nThe 'Double Fantasy' star told Variety: \"I’m finishing the third part of this saga, of this trilogy. The name of it will come out soon, but it’s not called what some fans think it’s called… what they think it’s called is actually a song on the album, but that’s not what the actual album is called. [It’s unclear which speculative title he’s referring to.] So I’m just gonna say that.\"\n\nThe 'Take My Breath' hitmaker loved how intimate the shows on his tour felt.\n\nHe said: \"The performances are mostly in the daytime, so I get to see the audience. It’s easier to connect with their eyes and feels a bit more intimate, so instead of a performance, it feels like more of a conversation with them. Every night I’m changing up the set — I never do that, it’s usually very formulaic — so I’m spicing it up and going into deep, deep, deep cuts and older songs. I’ll rehearse it the day-of, and if the band is down, we’ll just throw a mini-set in there.\"\n\nRyan Reynolds’ daughter James, 9, ‘sort of OK’ after watching new ‘Deadpool and Wolverine’ film\n\nLets daughter watch his film\n\nPhoto: BANG Showbiz. All rights reserved.\n\nRyan Reynolds’ nine-year-old daughter is “sort of OK” after watching his new ‘Deadpool and Wolverine’ film.\n\nThe 47-year-old actor – who has four children with wife Blake Lively – let his oldest girl James watch the film ahead of its release despite its adult content, which led to it getting an R-rating that Ryan said was the result of the movie sticking to the “authenticity” of its raunchy, violent roots.\n\nHe told People: “My nine-year-old saw the movie, and she’s sort of okay! (But she) loved it.”\n\nRyan cautioned his decision to sit through the film with his child was “just me though” and added: “I’m not telling other parents to do that.”\n\nThe actor recently told The New York Times he watched R-rated movies as a child, which he said “left a huge impression on me because I didn’t feel like people were pulling punches, and it’s been a huge inspiration to so many of the things that I look to make now”.\n\nRyan said about his latest release’s R-rating: “Deadpool and the world that Deadpool was able to inhabit (in) the other two movies was limitless, so I would say that in this movie, particularly bringing Wolverine over, the R-rating is only used to lay the groundwork for as much authenticity between these two characters as possible.\n\n“It’s not exploited in any way. It’s not used to shock people or make some silly set piece just to justify its R-rating.\n\n“It’s so that we can talk the way these two characters should talk, and behave the way these two characters should behave (so) that they are as close to the origins of their comic book ancestry as humanly possible.”\n\nAlong with James, Ryan and Blake, 36, have kids Inez, seven, and Betty, four, and 17-month-old Olin – whose name they have only now revealed.\n\n16 and Pregnant star Autumn Crittendon dies aged 27\n\n16 and Pregnant star dies\n\nPhoto: BANG Showbiz.

You left before anyone could tell you goodbye.\"\n\nMisty also noted that Autumn - who is also survived by her other children Abigail, five, and two-year-old Luke - had conquered a lot in her life and is so \"thankful\" that her legacy has been left in the little ones she has left behind.\n\nShe added: \"How much we love you. How amazing you are and how proud we are of you for staying sober through some of the toughest parts of your life, how far you’ve came from where you were, how thankful we are to have had all these years with you, how proud of you we are as a mother, how grateful we are for the 3 tiny parts of your heart that are still walking this earth.\n\n\"I promise you I will love life in your honour. These babies will always know how much you love them, how amazing you are, how special you are, how much you sacrificed and overcame for them, everything and nothing short of it.\"\n\nAccording to PageSix, law enforcement is \"currently classifying this incident as a death investigation\" and that \"detectives are working with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner on this case to determine the exact cause and manner of death.\"\n\nKeanu Reeves admits he is always thinking about death\n\nKeanu thinking about death\n\nPhoto: BANG Showbiz.

Hopefully it’s not crippling, but hopefully it’s sensitized [us] to an appreciation of the breath we have, and the relationships that we have the potential to have.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Keanu recently admitted that he \"didn't write\" any of his new novel.\n\nThe 'John Wick' actor has teamed up with one of his favourite authors, China Miéville, on 'The Book of Elsewhere', which is inspired by his own 'BRZRKR' comic books and features the series' protagonist, immortal warrior Unute aka B, but he left penning the story to his collaborator.\n\nHe admitted to The Guardian newspaper: “I didn’t want to write the book. I wanted another creator to take that journey. So, ultimately, China has written the novel. It’s not, like, we could look at page eight and say, ‘Oh, I wrote this section.’ I didn’t write any of the novel.’”\n\nThe pair first met face-to-face in Berlin in 2021, and went through China's first draft in a series of Zoom meetings, with the 51-year-old author admitting it took him some time to grasp Keanu's ideas, but ultimately he realised the 59-year-old star's suggestions were \"absolutely right\".\n\nHe said: “What I felt he was particularly perspicacious about was questions of character – which shouldn’t be a surprise because of the acting.\n\n\"But the way we talk about things structurally, and in terms of character, isn’t necessarily the same. We don’t come with the same vernacular.\n\n“So there was a process where I had to learn to understand what was being put to me. I remember a couple of times when you were saying things about B, and I was like, I know I’m not getting what he’s saying.\n\n\"Then after a couple of goes around – oh, OK, I get it. And every time that happened – I can think of three times very particularly – I was, like, oh: he’s absolutely right.”\n\nSparks fly in court as judge considers bail bid for man charged in Tupac Shakur killing\n\nSparks fly in court\n\nPhoto: The Canadian Press\n\nDuane \"Keffe D\" Davis, left, who is accused of orchestrating the 1996 slaying of hip-hop icon Tupac Shakur, listens to his attorney Carl Arnold during a hearing to reconsider his bond at the Regional Justice Center, on Tuesday, July. 23, 2024, in Las Vegas. (Bizuayehu Tesfaye/Las Vegas Review-Journal via AP)\n\nSparks flew in court Tuesday as a Nevada judge rebuked a defense attorney and an ailing former Los Angeles-area gang leader lashed out against prosecutors during his renewed effort to be freed from jail to house arrest ahead of his trial in the 1996 killing of hip-hop legend Tupac Shakur.\n\nClark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny, who last month rejected Duane “Keffe D” Davis' bid to have a hip-hop music figure put up $112,500 to obtain Davis' $750,000 bail bond, promised a decision on the bond question “in the next day or two.”\n\nFirst, though, she expressed doubts about the source of Davis' funds and scolded defense lawyer Carl Arnold — accusing him of playing up the case to keep media attention on one of hip-hop music's most enduring mysteries.\n\n“It seems like your plan, your end goal here, is to make some kind of show for the press of this trial,” Kierny said.\n\n“That’s not my end goal here, your honor,” Arnold responded. “My end goal is to win the trial. If they want to follow me with cameras, they can do that.”\n\nArnold was recently featured in a British tabloid report that said he was fielding offers for a film crew to follow him working on Davis' behalf. The article quoted Arnold calling Shakur's death a “legacy” legal case and invoking the memory of Johnnie Cochran, a defense attorney for O.J. Simpson during his 1995 trial in Los Angeles. Cochran, who died in 2005, was famously credited with showing jurors a glove and saying, “If it doesn’t fit, you must acquit.\"\n\nDavis has been held in a Las Vegas jail since his arrest last September. He stood in shackles and complained about police and prosecutors reviewing material compiled by a former Los Angeles police detective, Greg Kading, for a 2011 book about the killings of Shakur in Las Vegas and rival rap icon Christopher Wallace six months later in Los Angeles. Wallace was known as The Notorious B.I.G. or Biggie Smalls.\n\n“Them boxes should not be allowed,\" Davis said of records now being examined by police and prosecutors for possible evidence ahead of his trial, scheduled for Nov. 4.\n\n“Mr. Greg Kading had those boxes at his house for 15 years in his attic doing all kind of TV interviews,\" Davis said. \"He broke a proper agreement, and he broke the law, all kinds of stuff.\"\n\nDavis also accused the prosecutors, Marc DiGiacomo and Binu Palal, of \"trashing my family in this.”\n\n“They not only ugly on the outside but they ugly on the inside too,” Davis said. “These two dudes right here.”\n\nDiGiacomo and Palal did not respond later to requests for comment.\n\nDavis said in his own 2019 tell-all memoir — on leading a street gang in his hometown of Compton, California — that he was promised immunity from prosecution when he told authorities in Los Angeles what he knew about the shootings of Shakur and Wallace.\n\nNo arrests have ever been made in the Wallace case. Davis is the only person ever charged in the Shakur killing.\n\nKading said by telephone Tuesday that he turned over his investigative records to Las Vegas police this year — several months after Davis was indicted and arrested at his home in suburban Henderson, Nevada. Kading said he broke no laws and none of the material was obtained or kept illegally.\n\n“I don’t lose sleep over the fact that a confessed murderer is at odds with me for sharing information about his involvement in a murder,” Kading said. “None of what he said reveals new information. It’s well known. It was based on investigative resources from when I was at the LAPD.”\n\nNevada law prohibits convicted killers from profiting from their crime. But Arnold argued that since Davis hasn't been convicted, it didn't matter if Davis and Cash “Wack 100” Jones, a record executive offering to underwrite Davis' $750,000 bail, plan to profit from selling Davis’ life story.\n\nJones, who has managed artists including Johnathan “Blueface” Porter and Jayceon “The Game” Taylor, testified in June that he wanted to put up money for Davis because Davis was fighting cancer and had “always been a monumental person in our community ... especially the urban community.”\n\nArnold on Tuesday characterized Davis’ story as intensely interesting to the public with or without mention of the Shakur killing. He called his client “one of the most notorious gang leaders of all of Southern California” and “the godfather of Compton.”\n\nThe attorney declined to comment following the court hearing.\n\nThe judge decided June 26 she wasn't convinced that Davis and Jones weren’t planning to profit. She also said she couldn’t determine if Jones wasn't serving as a “middleman” on behalf of another unnamed person.\n\nPalal said in court that a judge can set any condition deemed necessary to ensure that a defendant returns to court for trial. If Davis is allowed to post a “gift\" for release, he'd have no incentive to comply with court orders or appear for trial, the prosecutor said.\n\nDavis has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. If he's convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison. He and prosecutors say he's the only person still alive who was in a car from which shots were fired into another car nearly 28 years ago, killing Shakur and wounding rap music mogul Marion “Suge” Knight.\n\nAuthorities allege that the shooting stemmed from competition between East Coast members of a Bloods gang and West Coast parts of a Crips gang, including Davis, for dominance in a musical genre known at the time as “gangsta rap.”\n\nKnight, now 59, is serving 28 years in a California prison for killing a Compton businessman with a vehicle in 2015.\n\nMore Entertainment News\n\nFeatured Flyer"
