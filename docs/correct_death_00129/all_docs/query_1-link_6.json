        "text": "Historical Notes\n\nSchwab's opened in 1932 when Philadelphia natives and brothers, Jack, Leon, Bernard and Martin Schwab, bought a failing pharmacy on the corner of Sunset and Crescent Heights boulevards. The pharmacy was located just around the corner from several studios and the brothers set up their pharmacy to cater to the Hollywood crowd. Schwab's was more than just a place to fill prescriptions: there was a grocery store, a make-up counter (Gloria Swanson bought all her cosmetics there) and a restaurant that served all-American fare like hamburgers and meatloaf (Marlon Brando and Orson Welles were fans).*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\n1938 - Harold Arlen was working on a movie score for an upcoming film, The Wizard of Oz. He was having a difficult time composing a ballad for one particular scene. Ballads were usually love songs, but this scene was about a lonely farm girl longing for \"a place where there isn't any trouble,\" and it had him stumped. He decided to take a break from writing and catch a movie at Grauman's Theater with his wife, Anya. He sat in the passenger seat with Anya at the wheel. They turned onto Sunset Blvd, heading East, when suddenly he touched her arm and asked her to pull over. Anya parked the car under the neon sign of Schwab's Pharmacy, as Harold scribbled the melody that just came to him. He rushed inside to call his writing partner, Yip Harburg, from the Schwab's payphone.\n\n\"Yippers, can you meet me at my house in 10 minutes? I think I got a nugget.\"\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nSidney Skolsky, a syndicated Hollywood gossip columnist for the New York Daily News who was the first journalist to use the nickname \"Oscar\" for the Academy Award in print, made Schwab's famous in the 1930s. He used the drugstore as his office, and called his column in Photoplay, the premiere movie magazine in the U.S. at the time, \"From A Stool At Schwab's\".\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn the 1970s and early ’80s, a new set of celebrities began gracing the fountain with their presence, including Eric Estrada, Al Pacino, Sylvester Stallone, Goldie Hawn and Jerry Brown. In 1980, Jack Schwab passed away at age 75, and after five decades of service, the Schwab’s on Sunset Boulevard closed down. Leon Schwab stated that the closure was due to family reasons, but the truth was that the company was in financial distress. In 1983, everything that was not bolted down, from the stools and counters to the pharmacy’s famous Rolodex, was auctioned off to the highest bidder. The large red-and-blue neon sign that hung over the front door sold for $650.*\n\nIt took the wrecking ball a couple of more years to knock down Schwab's, but in 1988 the building came down, making way for a large retail complex.Â\n\nThe Origins of Googie Architectrure\n\nAlan Hess, the author of Googie: Fifties Coffeeshop Architecture, traces Googie back to three Coffee Dan's restaurants designed by John Lautner in the early forties.\n\n\"He selected the vaults and glass walls and trusses and angles of his buildings to fit the original, often unusual, concepts of space he favored,\" writes Hess.\n\nLautner originated the style that would be refined and reinterpreted by many others. Unintentionally, he also gave the style a name when, in 1949, he designed Googie's Coffee Shop at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Crescent Heights in Los Angeles.\n\nProfessor Douglas Haskell of Yale was driving through Los Angeles when he and architectural photographer Julius Shulman came upon Googie's. \"Stop the car!\" Haskell yelled. \"This is Googie architecture.\" While Haskell was dubious about the style, he made the name \"Googie architecture\" stick by using it in a 1952 article in House and Home magazine.*\n\nThe Googie Look\n\nAlthough Googie buildings were often quite different from one another, Douglas Haskell noted that the style had certain rules:\n\n1. It can look organic, but it must be abstract. \"If it looks like a bird, it must be a geometric bird. It's better yet if the house had more than one theme: like an abstract mushroom surmounted by an abstract bird.\"\n\n2. Ignore gravity altogether. \"Whenever possible, the building must hang from the sky.\"\n\n3. Multiple structural elements. Inclusion is the rule, rather than minimalism. New materials, including sheet glass, glass blocks, asbestos, plywood and plastic gave the architect a whole new palette to work with. Other innovations allowed steel and cement to be used in new ways. Suddenly, architects had more elbowroom for their dreams. A room made of plastic could look like a log cabin, a space ship, or almost anything.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nWest Hollywood, colloquially referred to as WeHo, was incorporated in 1984 and is home to the famous Sunset Strip.Â The irregular boundary of the town is featured in the city logo, and was largely formed from the unincorporated area that had not become part of the surrounding cities (Los Angeles and Beverly Hills).*^\n\nWest Hollywood owes its existence to one of Southern California's first interurban electric railways, the Pasadena and Pacific. Assembled by Moses H. Sherman and his brother-in-law Eli P. Clark from failed and fragmentary predecessors, the Pasadena and Pacific connected the booming city of Los Angeles with the beach town of Santa Monica. Along the way, it crossed a sprawling coastal plain dotted with marshes, tar pits, and citrus groves. Today's Santa Monica Boulevard traces the railway's route across what was then called the Cahuenga Valley.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nDuring the final decade years of the nineteenth century, the first large land development in what would later become West Hollywoodâthe town of \"Sherman\"âwas established by Moses Sherman and his partners of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad, an interurban railroad line which later became part of the Pacific Electric Railway system. Sherman became the location of the railroad's main shops, railroad yards, and \"car barns\". Many working-class employees of the railroad settled in this town.Â It was during this time that the city began to earn its reputation as a loosely regulated, liquor-friendly (during Prohibition) place for eccentric people wary of government interference.\n\nFor years, farms and open fields separated the town of Sherman from the neighboring communities of Colegrove and Hollywood (an independent city from 1903 to 1910). Though connected by the tracks of the Pasadena and Pacificâlater bounded on each side by paved roadways for motor cars and named Santa Monica Boulevardâit was not until the early 1920s that the growing Los Angeles metropolis met the street grid of Sherman. ^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nFor many years, the area that is now the city of West Hollywood was an unincorporated area in the midst of Los Angeles. Because gambling was illegal in the city of Los Angeles, but still legal in Los Angeles County, the 1920s saw the proliferation of many casinos, night clubs, etc., along Sunset Boulevard (which starts in downtown Los Angeles and runs westward). These businesses were immune from the sometimes heavy-handed law-enforcement of the L.A. Police Department.\n\nIn 1925, In a controversial decision, Sherman adopted \"West Hollywood\", \"...a moniker pioneered earlier in the decade by the West Hollywood Realty Board\" as its informal name, though it remained under the governance of Los Angeles County.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nBeginning in 1922, Sherman's population boomed. As the town's development began to merge with that of Hollywood, by then a part of the City of Los Angeles, some in both Sherman and the metropolis began speaking of annexation.\n\nLos Angeles promptly annexed several large but mostly vacant tracts surrounding Sherman; the 1,203-acre Fairfax district became part of Los Angeles with the unanimous approval of its 16 residents, and a 7-0 vote joined the 430-acre Melrose district with L.A.\n\nL.A. easily incorporated these vast tracts into its city limits without contention, but Sherman was an established community with an independent identity, and the issue of annexation divided Sherman's population and business interests. Realtors supported it, arguing that future development depended on access to Los Angeles' sewer and fire protection services. Sherman's Board of Trade and Chamber of Commerce opposed joining the city, however, fearful of increased property taxes.\n\nUltimately the anti-annexationist forces prevailed. Instead of relying on L.A.'s utility connections and public services, Sherman financed construction of its own sewer system and relied upon the county for police and fire protection services. ^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe tracks running down the center of Santa Monica Boulevard became part of the Pacific Electric Railway in 1911 and carried red cars until 1954. They then remained largely unused for decades, serving the occasional Southern Pacific freight train through the 1970s. It was not until 1999 that the West Hollywood segment of the tracks were dug up and replaced by a landscaped median.^\n\nClick HERE to see same view in 2016.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nWhen United Artists was formed in 1919 byÂ Charlie Chaplin,Â Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, andÂ D. W. Griffith, the founders never intended the company to be like a regular Hollywood studio. It started solely as a distribution company. Its mission was to release films made by independent producers, therefore it had no studio lot. However, many of the independent producers owned their own property, like theÂ Charlie Chaplin Studio on Sunset Boulevard.Â The closest thing to a studio lot was the property owned by Pickford and Fairbanks on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Formosa Avenue in Hollywood. The studio lot's address is now 1041 North Formosa Avenue.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe 18-acre property on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Formosa Avenue was originally owned by Jesse Durham Hampton, and then became known as the Pickford-Fairbanks Studio. As United Artists began to lure independent producers away from the major studios, many of the producers like Samuel Goldwyn and Joseph Schenck rented offices and stages on the property. In the early 1920s, the lot was renamed the United Artists Studio, though it was operated as a separate entity from United Artists the distribution company.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAfter Douglas Fairbanks died in 1939, leaving his share of the deed to Mary Pickford, Goldwyn sought to rename the lot \"Samuel Goldwyn Studio.\" Pickford and Goldwyn fought over the name and ownership of the property until a court ordered that the lot be auctioned in 1955.\n\nJames Mulvey, Goldwyn's most trusted business confidant and president of Samuel Goldwyn Inc., outbid Pickford for the property. The lot officially became Samuel Goldwyn Studio and remained so until Warner Brothers purchased the site in 1980.^\n\nWarner Bros. sold the studio lot in 1999 and the name of this studio lot was changed to \"The Lot.\"\n\nAcross the street is the Formosa Cafe, a legendary Hollywood hangout.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn Feb , 2022 the iconic Tower Records building was demolished.\n\nHere's the Tower building (8801 Sunset Blvd) history timeline\n\nâ¢ 1928 - 1935 Magnetic Service Station (Venetian Studio - antique furniture adjacent on west side at 8811 Sunset)\n\nâ¢ 1935: Simon’s Drive-in opens\n\nâ¢ 1945: Dolores Drive-In opens\n\nâ¢ 1952: Jack’s on the Strip drive-in opens.

Before that it was known as the St. James Club and Hotel, a grand 13 story, the Strip's 1st high-rise (built in 1931), and one of Hollywood 's best examples of Art Deco design. Virtually every star in Hollywood stayed here at one time or another. It was a favorite of Howard Hughes, who kept a number of suites here fore his various girlfriends; other guest included Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra and John Wayne (who is said to have kept a cow on the balcony outside his penthouse suite for fresh milk).\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nSunset Boulevard, a long winding thoroughfare that begins in downtown Los Angeles and runs westward over 20 miles, ends at the Pacific Ocean near Malibu. The best-known portion of the boulevard is the mile and a half stretch between Hollywood and Beverly Hills, known as \"The Sunset Strip\".*\n\nThe Chateau Marmont Hotel was a great castle on the hill inspired by the architecture of the Loire Valley in France was built in 1927, opened in 1929 as an apartment house, and was changed to a hotel in 1931, becoming the \"Hotel to the Stars\".*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn 1940 Preston Sturges, successful Hollywood writer and director, opened Players Nightclub. Stars and writers made it their home base. Humphrey Bogart, Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, George S. Kaufman (writer of several Marx Brothers movies), and Donald Ogden Stewart (screenwriter of 1938âs Marie Antoinette and 1940âs The Philadelphia Story) all got smashed on The Playersâ drinks, which were said to be the most potent in town.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck (Sturgesâ leading lady in The Lady Eve), Orson Welles (who stayed next door at the Chateau Marmont when he first came to Hollywood), Joel McCrea (who starred in three of Sturgesâ pictures), Rudy Vallee, director William Wyler, and writer William Faulkner were all regulars at their friendâs establishment. Multi-millionaire Howard Hughes became a regular guest. He often dined on the top floor, frequently preferring to eat alone.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn 1926 Fred Horowitz, a prominent Los Angeles attorney, chose the site at Marmont Lane and Sunset Boulevard to construct an apartment building. Horowitz had recently traveled to Europe for inspiration and returned to California with photos of a Gothic Chateau along the Loire River. In 1927 Horowitz commissioned his brother-in-law, European-trained architect Arnold A. Weitzman, to design the seven-story, L-shaped building based on his French photos. When deciding upon a name for the building, Chateau Sunset and Chateau Hollywood were rejected in favor of Chateau Marmont, a name conceived by the small street running across the front of the property.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nOn February 1, 1929, Chateau Marmont opened its doors to the public as the newest residence of Hollywood. Local newspapers described the Chateau as “Los Angeles’s newest, finest and most exclusive apartment house ... superbly situated, close enough to active businesses to be accessible and far enough away to insure quiet and privacy.”\n\nDue to the high rents and inability to keep tenants for long-term commitments during the depression, Fred Horowitz chose to sell the apartment building to Albert E. Smith for $750,000 in cash. The following year, Chateau Marmont was converted into a hotel. The apartments became suites with kitchens and living rooms. The property was also refurbished with antiques from depression-era estate sales.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nWith its external appearance of a castle or Gothic fort, combined with its residential past, incredibly thick walls, discreet entry, and highly protective staff who treated guests like members of the family, the Chateau Marmont became the ideal hideout.\n\nEuropean guests found the architecture familiar and comforting, sexual outsiders felt accepted, the emotionally shy were shielded, and anyone else with a reason to hide simply blended into the woodworkâfrom the start there was the feeling of a shared sensibility. Greta Garbo felt comfortable here, as did Howard Hughes.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nMembers of Led Zeppelin rode their motorcycles through the lobby in the 1960s.\n\nOn March 5, 1982, comedian John Belushi died from a speedball injection in Bungalow No. 3.\n\nOn January 23, 2004, photographer Helmut Newton, who lived at the hotel, lost control of his Cadillac and crashed into the driveway wall. He was killed.\n\nThere is a commonly-denied and non-denied story that Benicio Del Toro and Scarlett Johansson hooked up in the elevator the night before the 2004 Oscars.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nCiro's (later known as Ciro's Le Disc) was a nightclub in West Hollywood located at 8433 Sunset Boulevard, on the Sunset Strip. It opened in January 1940 by entrepreneur William Wilkerson. Herman Hover took over management of Ciro's in 1942 until it closed its doors in 1957.\n\nCo-founder Wilkerson also opened Cafe Trocadero, in 1934, and the restaurant La Rue, both on the Strip, and later originated The Flamingo in Las Vegas, only to have control of the resort wrested from his control by mobster Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn the 1960s, Ciro's became a Sunset Strip rock and roll club, and was the only major venue on the Strip to make such a transition while keeping its original name. The Byrds got their start there in 1964. Accounts of the period (reproduced in the sleeve notes to The Preflyte Sessions box set) describe a \"church-like\" atmosphere, with interpretive dancing. The club also served as the host during the recording of the 1965 Dick Dale album \"Rock Out With Dick Dale: Live At Ciro's\"\n\nThe site of Ciro's became Art Laboe's circa 1970 and the The Comedy Store in 1972.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Comedy Store was opened in April 1972 by comedians Sammy Shore and Rudy DeLuca. The building was formerly the home of Ciro's, a popular Hollywood nightclub owned by William Wilkerson, and later a rock and roll venue, where The Byrds were discovered in 1964.\n\nWhen the venue reopened as The Comedy Store in 1972, it included a 99-seat theatre, where Johnny Carson was one of the first comics to perform. As a result of a divorce settlement, Sammy Shore's ex-wife Mitzi Shore began operating the club in 1973, and she was able to buy the building in 1976. She immediately renovated and expanded the club to include a 450-seat main room.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Comedy Store has featured performances from every important comedian. The names of its headliners are vaunted on its outside walls.\n\nThis was once the site of Ciro’s, one of Hollywood’s most popular nightclubs during the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThe building is supposedly haunted. TV’s “Access Hollywood” once brought in a psychic, billed her as a “spiritual journalist,” and had her talk about angry mobsters still supposedly trapped in the building’s basement. ^^+\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Mocambo opened on January 3, 1941, and became an immediate success. It was owned by Charlie Morrison and Felix Young.Â The club's Latin American-themed decor designed by Tony Duquette cost $100,000 (equivalent to $1,663,801 in 2017). Along the walls were glass cages holding live cockatoos, macaws, seagulls, pigeons, and parrots. With big band music, the club became one of the most popular dance-till-dawn spots in town. On any given night, one might find the room filled with the leading men and women of the motion picture industry.\n\nIn 1943, when Frank Sinatra became a solo act, he made his Los Angeles debut at the Mocambo.\n\nOn March 15, 1955 Ella Fitzgerald opened at the Mocambo, after Marilyn Monroe lobbied the owner for the booking. The booking was instrumental in Fitzgerald's career. The incident was turned into a play by Bonnie Greer in 2005.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAmong the many celebrities who frequented the Mocambo were Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Errol Flynn, Charlie Chaplin, Elizabeth Taylor, Judy Garland, Henry Fonda, Lana Turner, Ava Gardner, Bob Hope, James Cagney, Sophia Loren, Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner, Grace Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, Howard Hughes, Kay Francis, Marlene Dietrich, Theda Bara, Tyrone Power, Jayne Mansfield, John Wayne, Ben Blue, Ann Sothern, and Louis B. Mayer. Myrna Loy and Arthur Hornblow, Jr. celebrated their divorce there.\n\nThe club's main stage was replicated on the TV series I Love Lucy as the \"Tropicana\" Club. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were frequent guests at the Mocambo and were close friends of Charlie Morrison.\n\nEarly in 1957, club operator and co-owner Charlie Morrison died at his Beverly Hills home. The Mocambo remained in business for one final year, before closing its doors on June 30, 1958. The building was then sold, reopened as a supper club called The Cloister, and eventually demolished.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\n*Eddie Cantor, born Edward Israel Iskowitz, was a comedian, dancer, singer, actor, and songwriter.Â He is also known for being the second president of the Screen Actors Guild, serving from 1933 to 1935. He invented the title \"The March of Dimes\" for the donation campaigns of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which was organized to combat polio. It was a play on the The March of Time newsreels popular at the time. He began the first campaign on his radio show in January 1938, asking listeners to mail a dime to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. At that time, Roosevelt was the most notable American victim of polio. Other entertainers joined in the appeal via their own shows, and the White House mail room was deluged with 2,680,000 dimesâa large sum at the time.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Hacienda Park Apartments (renamed Coronet Apartments in late 1930s) was built in 1927 and operated initially as a luxury apartment building catering to the entertainment business. In the 1930s, it became the \"most famous brothel in California.\" Â The building declined in prestige in the 1950s and 1960 and was acquired by rock star Rod Stewart in the 1970s. After Stewart's plans to redevelop the building as a luxury hotel ended in a legal dispute, the building was nearly destroyed in a 1983 fire that was found to be of suspicious origin. Since 1986, it has been known as the Piazza del Sol, and it now houses the offices of several production companies, including Miramax Films. The restaurant Katana, co-owned by Ryan Seacrest and Tori Spelling and described by Newsweek as \"so hip it hurts,\" also operates at the building.*^\n\nA check of the Piazza del Sol’s listing in the National Register reveals a quirk in the record. The Register shows its original name as Hacienda Arms Apartments, not the Hacienda Park Apartments â a name that in 1927 connected the building to the neighborhood around it, Hacienda Park. It’s by no means a fatal error, and the rest of the information appears to be correct, but this small mistake has been magnified over the years â picked up and repeated in dozens of articles and books, including, for example, the headline of the building’s Wikipedia page.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nWil Wright’s was a chain of ice cream parlors that dotted the Southern California landscape up until the mid-seventies.Â In addition to the West Hollywood location, they could be found in Beverly Hills (corner of Beverly Drive and Charleville), Westwood Village (corner of Glendon and Lindbrook), Pacific Palisades (San Vicente), Sherman Oaks (corner of Ventura and Van Nuys Blvd). They were the perfect place to take a date after the movie.Â The delicate pink and red decor and little marble tables and wire-frame chairs made you feel like you were seated inside a Valentine’s Day card.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nFlorence Nightingale Graham (1878 â 1966), who went by the business name Elizabeth Arden, was a Canadian American businesswoman who founded what is now Elizabeth Arden, Inc., and built a cosmetics empire in the United States. By 1929 she owned 150 upscale salons across the United States and Europe. Her 1000 products were found in the luxury market in 22 countries. She was the sole owner, and at the peak of her career, she was one of the wealthiest women in the world.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nPupi’s, which opened in the mid- to late 1950s, sat on the south side of the Sunset Strip, in the historically upscale portion known as Sunset Plaza. It had a striped awning over sidewalk tables, but the little flagstone patio was the real attraction, along with some Perspex that blocked the wind coming up from the great sweep that separated its patrons from the wider Los Angeles Basin below.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThis restaurant was originally called the Mermaid Cafe built in the late 1920's. In 1933 it premiered as The Villa Nova and taken over by film director Vincente Minnelli and silent film actor-director Allen Dale.\n\nMarilyn Monroe went on her first blind date with Joe DiMaggio here in 1953 and Vincent proposed to Judy Garland at the Villa Nova in 1945. When Elmer Valentine, Lou Adler and Mario Maglieri took it over in 1972, they originally wanted to call it \"Over The Rainbow\" in their honor - but the city would not allow the sign to reach a certain height, so they shortened it to, \"The Rainbow\".*^^*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Rainbow became known as a hangout for rock musicians and their groupies. Notable regulars at the Rainbow in this period include Keith Moon, Alice Cooper, Micky Dolenz, Harry Nilsson, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and Neil Diamond. Elvis Presley was known to have occasionally visited the Rainbow. The group of musicians calling themselves the Hollywood Vampires made the Rainbow their home away from home in the mid-1970s. In the last two decades of his life, MotÃ¶rhead frontman Lemmy was a daily fixture at the Rainbow whenever the band was not on tour, and often played a video poker machine at the end of the bar table.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Roxy was opened on September 23, 1973, by Elmer Valentine and Lou Adler, along with original partners David Geffen, Elliot Roberts and Peter Asher. They took over the building previously occupied by a strip club owned by Chuck Landis called the Largo. (Adler was also responsible for bringing the stage play The Rocky Horror Show to the United States, and it opened its first American run at The Roxy Theatre in 1974, before it was made into the movie The Rocky Horror Picture Show the next year. *^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nNeil Young and his band The Santa Monica Flyers played the Roxy for the first week it was open. Only three months later, the original Genesis lineup with Peter Gabriel played several consecutive days at the Roxy, a run that some band members and many fans consider to be amongst their finest performances (due partially to the intimate atmosphere and good acoustics of the venue, as well as the legendary reputation of \"Hollywood\" amongst performers around the world).\n\nPaul Reubens, then a struggling comedian, introduced his Pee-wee Herman character in a raunchy revue here in 1981 that included other aspiring comics including Phil Hartman and Elayne Boosler. *^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe original Dolores Diner is behind the building. Muntz used that space for his car stereo installations. This building was originally built as a model used to sell the condos in the Shoreham building in 1961. Budget Rent-A-Car took it over, and then Muntz added that framing extenstion on the west side of the building.\n\nThe above building was a music store and showroom for \"Madman\" Muntz's Stereo Paks, the first successful car stereo system \"and a popular hangout for teenagers in the '60s.\" (In addition to inventing 4-tracks, Muntz popularized the nickname \"TV\" for television.\n\nTower Records moved into the building in 1971.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nDuring the 1940s Sherry’s was popular with L.A.’s mafia element. On July 20, 1949 gangster Mickey Cohen and 3 others were ambushed at 3:45 a.m. in front of the restaurant on the Sunset Strip. Mickey's car drove up to the curb and gunmen (hiding across the street under an advertising sign â out of view) opened fire with shotguns. The gunmen then sped away in a gray auto, tossing out the guns a block away. Mickey was the least seriously wounded.*#\n\nSherry’s later became the famous rock club Gazzari’s on the Strip.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nGazzarri's reached its peak of popularity in the late 1960s, featuring Jim Morrison's young new group, along with other LA talent such as The Bobby Fuller Four, Buffalo Springfield, and The Walker Brothers. It then achieved major LA relevance again in the late 70's, featuring the David Lee Roth-led Van Halen nightly for months on end, and then into the 1980s thru the early 90's as one of the top LA glam metal nightclubs. It was owned and operated by the \"Godfather of Rock and Roll\", Bill Gazzarri. Gazzarri himself was known for dressing up as a Chicago-style gangster and frequenting the club on performance nights. Located near the corner of Doheny and Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, and just several dozen yards from both the Rainbow Bar and Grill and The Roxy Theatre, Gazzarri's became famous as a launching pad for future rock and roll stars.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe restaurant was run by a black woman named Louise Brooks but owned by Phil Selznick, who was David O. Selznick’s uncle. He also took over the It CafÃ© on Vine Street from Clara Bow, and Club Versailles at 8590 Sunset, which was rumored to be a front for Bugsy Siegel and later became Mocambo. Something dodgy was going on because Mammy Louise’s Bayou was raided in the fall of 1938 and subsequently went under. Its next incarnation was an upscale lesbian bar called Cafe Internationale.Â\n\nToday the building, after a major renovation, has been converted into a furniture store.Â Click HERE for contemporary view.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Finlandia Baths were downstairs in the basement of the Crosby Building where a virtual who's who of closeted gay and straight male stars went for a bake or to rub the kinks out or have them rubbed out, as the case may be. Regulars apparently included Kirk Douglas, Cornel Wilde, Humphrey Bogart, Tony Curtis, Hugh O'Brien, Rock Hudson and the Crosby brothers and many others. The building is still there albeit somewhat folded, spindled and mutilated but the bones are still good and still visible. Finlandia Baths have predictably morphed into a tattoo parlor.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe tracks were used by the old Red Line cars. They ran from Gardner up Santa Monica Boulevard through West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and Los Angeles to the city of Santa Monica. After the demise of the Red Cars, Southern Pacific continued to run a short train to maintain its claim to the right of way, even after it stopped transporting wheat and other supplies to the former Wonder Bread Bakery in Beverly Hills. (On warm summer evenings, the aroma of baking bread would waft over the area.) After West Hollywood incorporated in 1984, one of the first improvement projects the new city planned was removal of the tracks, narrowing of the median, extensive landscaping, and widening of the sidewalks along the length of the boulevard within its limits.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nFlipper's Roller Boogie Palace opened up in July 1979.Â The owners were Denny Cordell, Nicholas Cowan and Flipper (a mysterious Englishman named Flipper). The property was partly owned by Berry Gordy, Motown's head man.\n\nFlipper's was a posh and exclusive nightclub for skaters. It was also a private club. However, one didn't have to be rich and famous to join. Membership was limited to 1,000. A 5-man membership committee chose the members who paid $200 annually plus a $7 entrance fee. It was open 8pmÂ 'til late. +++#\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn 1962, comedian Lenny Bruce was arrested on obscenity charges for using the word \"schmuck\" on stage; one of the arresting officers was Sherman Block, who would later become Los Angeles County Sheriff. On August 25, 1970, Neil Diamond (who had just recorded his first live album at the Troubadour) introduced Elton John, who performed his first show in the United States at the Troubadour. In 1974, John Lennon and his friend Harry Nilsson were ejected from the club for drunkenly heckling the Smothers Brothers. Randy Newman started out at the club and comics Cheech & Chong and Steve Martin were discovered there. In 1975, Elton John returned to do a series of special anniversary concerts. In November 2007, James Taylor and Carole King played a series of concerts commemorating the nightclub's 50th anniversary and reuniting the two from their 1970 performance.*\n\nClick HERE for a contemporary street view.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Streamline Moderne Jones Dog & Cat Hospital building was designed by the prominent architecture firm of Wurdeman and Becket. Two other examples of the work of Wurdeman & Becket include the former Mobil Oil/General Petroleum Building, now Pegasus Apartments, and Bullock's Pasadena, now Macy's. As Welton Becket & Associates, the firm went on to design many of L.A.'s iconic landmarks, including Capitol Records Tower, the Music Center of Los Angeles County, and the Cinerama Dome.\n\nThe redesigned structure, completed in 1938, is an excellent example of the Streamline Moderne architectural style that emerged in the 1930s. It features smooth wall surfaces, curved corners and volumes, and an emphasized horizontal design.\n\nThe windows are arranged in continuous ribbons across the faÃ§ade, with extensive use of glass block. Accentuating the building’s sleek lines, polished stainless steel is used for the entrance canopy and vertical fins rising above the main door.\n\nTaking its name from the curved form of a teardrop, which was the most efficient shape in lowering the wind resistance of an object placed in the stream lines of a wind tunnel, the Streamline Moderne evoked a sense of modern efficiency with curved surfaces, sleek finishes, and a spare use of detailing which often included pronounced horizontal banding and, in some cases, contrasting vertical accents.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nDr. Eugene C. Jones, a progressive veterinarian whose clients included the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino, commissioned Wurdeman and Becket to expand and remodel his original 1928 animal hospital, transforming it into a sleek and modern facility.\n\nDr. Jones’ animal hospital, which specialized in dogs and cats, was considered one of the first in Southern California. Its location at the western edge of West Hollywood near the border with Beverly Hills put it within short distance of the homes of wealthy clientele and their pets.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nGene Norman owned the Crescendo Nightclub (also the Interlude) on the Sunset Strip during the 1950s and 1960s featuring popular music and jazz. He also formed the GNP label which used many live recordings directly from the Crescendo Club.\n\nNorman featured virtually every record and cabaret star such as Johnny Mathis, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Bob Newhart an Ella Fitzgerald. The typical Crescendo show was Mort Sahl, The Dave Brubeck Quarter, June Christy and the Stan Kenton Band. During all that time he was producing jazz albums, both in clubs and in the studio.*^*^^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nChubby Checker (born Ernest Evans) is widely known for popularizing the twist dance style, with his 1960 hit cover of Hank Ballard's R&B hit \"The Twist\". In September 2008 \"The Twist\" topped Billboard's list of the most popular singles to have appeared in the Hot 100 since its debut in 1958, an honor it maintained for an August 2013 update of the list. He also popularized the Limbo Rock and its trademark limbo dance, as well as various dance styles such as the fly.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe address of 8532 Sunset had been home to an auction house in the nineteen forties, one that specialized in wooden furniture. By the early fifties the space had been renamed, remodeled and opened as a dining spot called the Alpine Lodge. The family restaurant had a loosely defined wooden shoe concept and was not particularly successful. Described as \"an attractive Swiss restaurant which fell on hard times,\" the owners soon dropped the word Alpine and replaced it with the name Dino, while leaving much of its decor intact.\n\nDino's Lodge had its grand opening in the spring of 1958. When the strange sketch that became the memorable sign was raised to the sky, its base cemented to the ground and the switch turned on, most assumed this meant it was Dean Martin's restaurant. Of course, this is exactly what the owners of the former Alpine wanted. \"Contrary to report,\" explained an April 1958 edition of the Los Angeles Times, \"Dean Martin does not own the restaurant on the Strip ... They just use his name and give him a percentage.\" It was a large percentage. Fifty percent. *\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nChasen’s opened in 1936 by owner Dave Chasen at the suggestion of director Frank Capra.Â It was just a humble shack named \"Chasen's Southern Pit \" (because of a barbecue pit in the back).Â It chili quickly became popular with the show biz crowd, and Chasen's rapidly grew into Hollywood's premier restaurant. Chasen's stuck with the American/Continental fare that brought it success, serving it in a warm, clubby atmosphere of heavy wood paneling and red leather booths. They still served the chili that made them famous (although it wasn't listed on the menu anymore), as well as their hobo steak and deviled beef bones. When Elizabeth Taylor was making \"Cleopatra \" in Rome, she had their chili flown out to her.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nChasen’s became the culinary hangout of Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Lana Turner, and Groucho Marx. Jimmy Stewart held his bachelor party here, Howard Hughes was seen constantly on the house phone, Alfred Hitchcock routinely fell asleep at his table. After Johnny Carson won his third Emmy in as many years, he took all of the show’s insiders for a celebratory dinner at Chasen’s. Donna Summer wrote her hit “She Works Hard For the Money” on toilet paper in the bathroomâthat was Chasen’s for you.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAfter the restaurant closed in 1995 after a nearly 60 year run, Bristol Farms tore down most of the building but preserving the Beverly Blvd side. Inside, there's a chili station set up for the market, but it's unclear whether that chili is in fact the one that made this place famous. More than any other long lost restaurant in Los Angeles, this one, the site of many a drunken night of revelry for Tinseltown A-listers, has the most intrigue.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Sunset Strip Whisky was founded by Elmer Valentine, Phil Tanzini, Shelly Davis, and attorney Theodore Flier and opened on January 16, 1964.Â Though the club was billed as a discothÃ¨que, suggesting that it offered only recorded music, the Whisky a Go-Go opened with a live band led by Johnny Rivers and a short-skirted female DJ Rhonda Lane, spinning records between sets from a suspended cage at the right of the stage.^\n\nThe Doors were the nightclub's house band in the years after the Whisky made discotheque and go-go dancers a national craze.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Whisky played an important role in many musical careers, especially for bands based in Southern California. The Byrds, Alice Cooper, Buffalo Springfield, Smokestack Lightning and Love were regulars, and The Doors were the house band for a whileâuntil the debut of the \"Oedipal section\" of \"The End\" got them fired. Van Morrison's band Them had a two-week residency in June 1966, with The Doors as the opening act. On the last night they all jammed together on \"Gloria\". Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention got their record contract based on a performance at the Whisky.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the Whisky hosted stage presentations, including the long-running show The Cycle Sluts. During the early 1990s, the Whisky hosted a number of Seattle-based musicians who would be a part of the grunge movement, including Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Melvins, Fitz of Depression and 7 Year Bitch. In 1994 Oasis played a controversial set at the Whisky, with frontman Liam Gallagher visibly intoxicated. Immediately following the gig, lead songwriter Noel Gallagher temporarily left the group out of frustration, fleeing to San Francisco, where he penned the song Talk Tonight. In 1997, DownSet Headlining followed by Lambs Bread and System of a Down played at the Whisky. The band were unsigned at the time, and played songs from their early demo tapes, in particular containing the band's only live performance of the song \"Blue\".^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAfter a bit of a slump in the 1950's, the Sunset Strip was revived in the 1960s with the opening of teen clubs Pandora's Box in 1962, Whisky A-Go-Go in 1964, modeled after the Chicago club of the same name, and Rose Deitch's Galaxy the same year. The Roxy Theatre and The London Fog opened in 1966. ###*\n\nThis one block (seen above) was the throbbing heart of it all in the 1960s. Here, in between Clark and Hilldale, people were openly selling grass and acid. Love, on the Forever Changes album, have a song called, \"Between Clark and Hilldale.\"\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nOn the far right, the building with the striped square awning is the Whisky A-Go-Go on the northwest corner of Sunset and Clark. The building with the arched awning to its left was Sneeky Pete's Night Club. The London Fog was the next building over (the Doors played there too). The next building over was the Galaxy with large sign and then on the next building, corner of Sunset and HIldale, stood the original Hamburger Hamlet. Further up the block you can see a sign for the Largo which is now The Roxy Theatre! Behind that was the Villa Nova - today The Rainbow.^#^^\n\nBy 1966, there were over a dozen music clubs on the Sunset Strip. The density of clubs on this short stretch of Sunset Boulevard resulted in late night crowds of young people that disturbed the neighbors and backed up traffic resulting in LA County Sheriffs enforcing a long-ignored 10 pm curfew for teens under 18, which had been on the books since 1939. ###*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nLes PoupÃ©es de Paris (The Dolls of Paris) was a musical puppet show created, produced and directed by Sid and Marty Krofft, that toured the United States throughout the 1960s.\n\nBy 1966 PJ's had been bought by an organized crime figure, Eddie Nash and reputed organized crime figure Dominic Lucci, and was managed by Gary Fontenot (not an organized crime figure) for many years. In 1973, after Nash bought out Lucci's ownership interest in the club, it became The Starwood. It closed in 1981, torn down by the City, after too many citations for underage drinking and noise abatement issues. Before it was demolished it caught fire, though not burning totally. This occurred while unexplained fires befell other Nash-owned properties at the time.*\n\nSubsequently the structure was torn down, and a mini-mall (Crescent Heights Plaza) was built on the site. Click HERE for contemporary view.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn 1966, annoyed residents and business owners in the district had encouraged the passage of a strict 10:00 pm curfew and loitering law to reduce the traffic congestion resulting from crowds of young club patrons. This was perceived by young, local rock music fans as an infringement on their civil rights, and on Saturday, November 12, 1966, fliers were distributed along the Strip inviting people to demonstrate later that day.\n\nHours before the protest, one of L.A's rock 'n' roll radio stations announced there would be a rally at Pandora's Box. The Los Angeles Times reported that as many as 1,000 youthful demonstrators, including such celebrities as Frank Zappa, Sonny and Cher, Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda (who was afterward handcuffed by police), erupted in protest against the perceived repressive enforcement of these recently invoked curfew laws.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Canyon Country Store has been the makeshift cultural center of Laurel Canyon for a full century. Immortalized in the Doors song \"Love Street,\" this deli-market is not a venue, but it's got historical music importance to spare, and continues to be -- as Jim Morrison put it -- the \"store where the creatures meet.\"\n\nKnown for its winding narrow streets and terrifying mudslides, Laurel Canyon became a part of the city of Los Angeles in 1923. Its close proximity to Hollywood and ample unused hillside attracted the film industry's elite \"photoplayers\" including Clara Bow, Errol Flynn and Harry Houdini.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nDuring the filming of Some Like it Hot, Marilyn Monroe frequented the legendary haunt and her photo still graces the restaurant's walls.\n\nIn 2015, the restaurant's original red-and-black 1940s interiors were gutted and a \"modern\" interior was installed, despite clientele who enjoyed the nostalgic ambience. Â After negative reactions to the change, much of the original interior was rebuilt. Less than 18 months after the gutting, just before Christmas of 2016, the Formosa Cafe closed without advance notice.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Formosa is a star in its own right - in a memorable scene from L.A. Confidential (1997) set inside the Formosa, Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) mistakenly accuses actress Lana Turner (Brenda Bakke) of being a prostitute “cut to look like Lana Turner.” The Formosa has also appeared in Swingers (1996) and more recently, the Season 3 episode of Bosch, \"Blood Under the Bridge.\"\n\nIn 2019, the Formosa CafÃ© underwent extensive rehabilitation. That same year, the City of West Hollywood designated the Formosa as a local cultural resource/landmark. The rehabilitation project earned a Conservancy Preservation Award in 2020.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nFor many years, Ben Frank's was an 'in' dining spot on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. It was casual and comfortable. It had a great location with plenty of parking. It was close to the clubs on the Sunset Strip where people were always milling about all hours of the day and night. And Ben Frank's was open 24 hours 7. #^**\n\nIt's rumored that musicians Stephen Stills and Richie Furay were driving down Sunset Blvd with producer Barry Friedmen when they spotted Neil Young's Pontiac hearse driving the other direction. They flagged him down and they all pulled into the parking lot of Ben Frank's where they discussed forming the band that was to become Buffalo Springfield.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nMel's Drive-Ins were born in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1947, created by Mel Weiss and Harold Dobbs, who at one time ran 11 drive-ins. In 1972 the craze had died out and George Lucas used the last remaining original Mel's Drive-In as the set for American Grafitti, after which it was demolished. In 1985 Mel's son Steven resurrected the nostalgic diners, now operating four in the Bay Area and four in the Los Angeles area, including this one on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. ^\n\nMel’s remodeled the original Ben Frank’s building. Â Alterations included the addition of the awning in the front, extending the window openings at the parking-lot side of the A-frame, and the addition of an attached outbuilding in back. The pylon-shaped sign standard with its radiator-like fins is original.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn 1960 a group of actors announced plans to open a theatre in a storefront one door west of the Players Ring. The actors renovated the building into the same theatre-in-the-round format as the Players Ring.\n\nA review of their first production, “Sabrina Fair,” complained about the small space, but audiences didn’t seem to mind. The next shows, “Grand Prize“ in July and “Heaven Can Wait” in August, were hits. In November 1961 a musical written by Jesse Lasky Jr., the son of one of the founders of Paramount Studios, opened at the Cameo. Described as a robust serio-comic epic of the old Nevada mining and gambling town of Virginia City, “Ghost Town” played for more than two months.\n\nOne of the Cameo’s biggest hits was “The Man in the Dog Suit” (1962), which played for eight months. It starred former contract starlet at RKO and Columbia Pictures Arline Judge and Ty Hardin â born Orison Whipple Hungerford Jr., and rechristened Ty Hardin by Henry Willson, the agent who discovered Rock Hudson â who was starring at the time in the hit television series “Bronco.”\n\nIn October 1963 the Cameo hosted an arts seminar “for anyone interested in acting, directing, producing or writing for the stage.” Lecturers included Richard Boone, Richard Chamberlain, Raymond Massey, Jose Ferrer and Loretta Young.\n\n“King of Hearts” opened on Christmas day 1963. The next show, “It’s Still an Act,” which opened in October 1964, four months after a fire had destroyed the Players Ring next door, was the Cameo’s last. The building was soon razed as part of the shopping center development.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Garden of Allah was a famous hotel in Hollywood at 8152 Sunset Boulevard between Crescent Heights and Havenhurst, at the east end of the Sunset Strip. It was originally a 2.5 acre estate called Hayvenhurst^ that was built in 1913 by real estate developer William H. Hay as his private residence. *^\n\n^Originally named Hayvenhurst, it was built for $30,000 in 1913 by William H. Hay, developer of the Crescent Heights neighborhood, which was bounded by Sunset and Santa Monica blvds, to the north and south, Fairfax (then called Crescent Ave.) to the east and Havenhurst (originally spelled \"Hayvenhurst\") to the west. Hay and his second wife lived in Hayvenhurst briefly before building an even grander home down the street (where the Directors Guild building is now) and then finally retiring to a large house at 4400 Hayvenhurst Avenue in Encino, another neighborhood Hay owned and developed. After the Hays moved out, Hayvenhurst stood empty for a few years before Alla Nazimova acquired it, including during World War I, when the Hays allowed the Red Cross to use it as its Westside headquarters. Nazimova ... leased Hayvenhurst in November 1917.... She purchased it outright for $65,000 in August 1918.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nSilent screen star Alla Nazimova acquired the property in 1918 and then, in 1926, converted it into a residential hotel by adding 25 villas around the residence. The hotel opened in January 1927 as the Garden of Alla Hotel (no final \"h\" on Alla). By 1930, new owners had changed the name to the Garden of Allah Hotel. Over the next two decades, the property went through a succession of owners, the last of whom was Bart Lytton, owner of Lytton Savings & Loan, who demolished the hotel in 1959 and replaced it with his bank's main branch.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn the mid-1920s owner Alla Nazimova proceeded to spend a small fortune, adding 25 two-story bungalows built throughout the grounds. Known initially as “The Garden of Alla” (no final “h”). Unfortunately for Nazimova, the investment proved to be her financial undoing. Within a year of the opening she was bankrupt and in 1928 she sold her shares in the property. The hotel however was a huge and instant success. It attracted many people lured by Hollywood’s promise of fame and fortune and quickly became one of the places people stayed when they first arrived in Hollywood before making their way up the ladder.*^^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nFor sometime, this was the largest swimming pool in town. It was built to remind Nazimova of her home in Yalta. Paramount Studios had bestowed Nazimova with the home and grounds when the star was at her apex so that she could enjoy a glamorous retreat in the burgeoning Hollywood community. A 1959 LA Times article discusses those early years: To garnish the gift, Nazimova built Hollywood’s largest swimming poolâ65 x 45 ft.âand had it shaped like the Black Sea of her girlhood. The pool hung like a dewy sapphire around the heart of her garden.+#+#+\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nFor decades, the Garden of Allah was not so much a hotel as one very long house party â one where every vice was allowed to flower. And it's easier to say who didn't check in at the Garden rather than who did. Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra, Laurence Olivier, Greta Garbo and Orson Welles were among the actors who lived there. Writers included F. Scott Fitzgerald, W. Somerset Maugham, Dorothy Parker and Ernest Hemingway. Marlene Dietrich liked to swim naked in the pool, while Errol Flynn would pounce on every beauty who so much as dipped her toe in it. ##^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAs Hollywood grew, the studio era began to wane and the city eventually surrounded the Garden of Allah. The real estate it was built on became more valuable as commercial property than the hotel itself. The hotel became seedier and the new stars, such as Montgomery Clift and James Dean, stayed at the nearby Chateau Marmont, which afforded more privacy and less chance of encounters with the less stylish transients who increasingly occupied the neglected villas at the Garden of Allah.\n\nIn 1959, the Garden of Allah came to its official end. Â Lytton Savings and Loan had bought the property, and had plans to turn the corner of Sunset and Crescent Heights into a business center, anchored by a bank. +#+#+\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThis was the original Spago, located at 8795 Sunset Boulevard (entrance at 1114 Horn Avenue) on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood.Â It opened in 1982, and closed in 1997 when the Beverly Hills location opened. *^\n\nThe original Spago attracted almost everyone who was anyone in Hollywood, from producers to politicians to major movie stars.\n\nIn 1975, Wolfgang came to Los Angeles and very quickly garnered the attention of the Hollywood elite as chef of Ma Maison in West Hollywood.Â From Ma Maison, Wolfgang went on to create his first flagship restaurant, Spago, in West Hollywood on the Sunset Strip.\n\nFrom its opening day in 1982, Spago was an instant success and culinary phenomenon. Wolfgang and Spago earned many accolades during its popular eighteen years in West Hollywood, including winning the prestigious James Beard Foundation Award for Outstanding Chef of the Year, twice, in 1991 and 1998, and the James Beard Foundation Award for Restaurant of the Year in 1994. Wolfgang is the only chef to have won the Outstanding Chef of the Year Award multiple times.\n\nAfter 15 successful years in West Hollywood, Wolfgang moved Spago to Canon Drive in Beverly Hills.^*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nLittle known fact: That unassuming building that was occupied by Spago once housed the legendary CafÃ© Gala which was significant for its association with the history of the LGBTQ community in West Hollywood. It was one of the first supper clubs with an openly gay clientele. Run by the eccentric Baroness Catherine d’Erlanger and Johnny Walsh, the Venetian-themed club saw a co-mingling of straight and gay patrons. At CafÃ© Gala, gay and lesbian stars did not have to worry about being caught up in a police raid. Regular guests included Cole Porter, Judy Garland, and Lena Horne. Pianist Bobby Short started out here, and when Dorothy Dandridge made her debut performance, it was one of the hottest tickets in town. By the 1960s, the property was occupied by Russian-Armenian restaurant. From 1982 to 2001, it was the home of Spago.^*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nOpened in 1957, Scandia was originally owned by Ken Hansen. Along with his wife, Tova, he turned the restaurant into a culinary landmark with elegant decor, impeccable service, and delectable Scandinavian and French cuisine. Ken’s sister-in-law, Teddy, served as hostess.\n\nScandia was a popular destination for members of the entertainment industry for decades. Inside, it included theme rooms: the Skal Room, which included a large copper bar, the Danish Room, full of Danish memorabilia, and the Terrace Room, fashioned after the Belle Terrace at Copenhagen's Tivoli Gardens. The restaurant offered a late-night dinner starting at 10:30 p.m. for the after-theatre crowd and had an award-winning wine cellar containing thirty thousand bottles.\n\nIt closed its doors in 1989.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nOriginally developed in 1963 as The Gene Autry Hotel Continental, it later become known as The Continental Hyatt House, and the Riot Hyatt as a reflection of its guests' propensity for partying. The hallowed halls have seen everything from Richard Cole (Led Zeppelin’s tour manager) riding his motorcycle through the hotel, to Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones (allegedly) tossing a television off of the balcony of room 1015. “We’ve since learned a few lessons and now the TVs are bolted to the walls and the balconies have been converted into sleek sunrooms,” noted Henning Nopper, the general manager at the Andaz West Hollywood. “Our history is one of Andaz West Hollywood's differentiating factors and is something we’re extremely proud of, so we definitely try and pay homage to that when we can.”*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s the hotel's proximity to popular clubs such as the Whisky a Go Go made it the preferred Los Angeles accommodation for touring rock groups, notably English bands Led Zeppelin, The Who and the Rolling Stones. It was often referred to at the time as the Riot House, a play on the name Hyatt House.Â\n\nIn 1976 the hotel became the Hyatt on Sunset. In February 1997, the hotel was renamed the Hyatt West Hollywood. The hotel was renovated in 2008 and reopened on January 8, 2009 as the Andaz West Hollywood, the second Andaz hotel in the new brand by Hyatt Hotels and Resorts. The 14-story Andaz West Hollywood has 239 rooms, including 20 suites and a restaurant called RH (“Riot House”). Â The renovation was completed by New York-based architecture and interior design firm Janson Goldstein LLP and includes a hand-painted metal disk 11-foot sculpture by renowned New York-based artist Jacob Hashimoto. The balconies made famous by stories of rock stars throwing televisions from them are now glass-enclosed sunrooms that overlook Sunset Boulevard.\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe building was saved from deterioration and possible demolition when it was purchased in 1985 from architect David Lawrence Gray, FAIA by Peter de Savary who promised to \"lovingly restore\" the building to its former glory by spending $25 million to convert the building into the first American branch of his luxury hotel chain, the St. James's Club.\n\nThe Lancaster Group purchased the hotel from de Savary in 1992, renaming it the Argyle.\n\nIn 2004, Jeff Klein purchased the hotel.Â Klein hired designer Paul Fortune to renovate the hotel, adding more modern amenities, and restored its original name.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Sunset Tower building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\n\nIn the 1990's the Sunset Tower Hotel was known as the Argyle Hotel. Before that it was known as the St. James Club and Hotel, a grand 13 story, the Strip's 1st high-rise (built in 1931), and one of Hollywood 's best examples of Art Deco design. Virtually every star in Hollywood stayed here at one time or another. It was a favorite of Howard Hughes, who kept a number of suites here fore his various girlfriends; other guest included Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra and John Wayne (who is said to have kept a cow on the balcony outside his penthouse suite for fresh milk).\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAuthor Andrew Greeley, in his book God in Popular Culture, described Ronstadt as \"the most successful and certainly the most durable and most gifted woman Rock singer of her era.\" Signaling her wide popularity as a concert artist, outside of the singles charts and the recording studio, Dirty Linen magazine describes her as the \"first true woman rock 'n' roll superstar ... (selling) out stadiums with a string of mega-successful albums.\" Â Amazon.com defines her as the American female rock superstar of the decade. Cashbox gave Ronstadt a Special Decade Award, as the top-selling female singer of the 1970s.\n\nBy the end of 1978, Ronstadt had solidified her role as one of rock and pop's most successful solo female acts, and owing to her consistent platinum album success, and her ability as the first woman to sell out concerts in arenas and stadiums hosting tens of thousands of fans, Ronstadt became the \"highest paid woman in rock\". Â She had six platinum-certified albums, three of which were number 1 on the Billboard album chart, and numerous charted pop singles. In 1978 alone, she made over $12 million (equivalent to $44,000,000 in 2016 dollars) and in the same year her albums sales were reported to be 17 million â grossing over $60 million (equivalent to a gross of over $220,000,000, in 2016 dollars).*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn Feb , 2022 the iconic Tower Records building was demolished.\n\nHere's the Tower building (8801 Sunset Blvd) history timeline\n\nâ¢ 1928 - 1935 Magnetic Service Station (Venetian Studio - antique furniture adjacent on west side at 8811 Sunset)\n\nâ¢ 1935: Simon’s Drive-in opens\n\nâ¢ 1945: Dolores Drive-In opens\n\nâ¢ 1952: Jack’s on the Strip drive-in opens.
