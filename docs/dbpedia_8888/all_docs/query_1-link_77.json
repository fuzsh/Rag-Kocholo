        "text": "WASHINGTON, DC - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Blazon-Flexible Flyer, Inc. of West Point, Mississippi, today announced a voluntary retrofit program involving certain model gym sets.\n\nThe potential hazard involves breakage due to wear of plastic tube end bearing brackets connecting the Teeter Totter, Lawn Swing and Horse Attachment, to the top support bar of the Gym Set. Breakage of this connection may cause the unit to fall while children are seated on it. There were approximately 159,000 units manufactured from November 4, 1986 to May 16, 1987.\n\nThe company has received three reports of injury associated with the product. The Gym Sets retail for between $60 and $300, and are identified by the following model numbers located on the main cross support. A diagram is attached for easy identification.\n\nThose model numbers are 30002, 30012, 41000, 41001, 41121, 41122, 41129, 42021, 42112, 42131, 42132, 42139, 42334, 45131, 61221, 62231, 62431, 62439, 62541, 62624, 62631, 62739, 69231, 69233, 69432, 69461, 69541, 69567, 87538, and horse attachment model numbers 99597, 9565 Manufactured from November 4, 1986 to May 16, 1987.\n\nBlazon-Flexible Flyer, Inc. has notified all retail customers of its revised production and the availability of the \"fix kits\" for consumers. Consumers who identify Gym Sets as being those involved in the corrective action may call Blazon-Flexible Flyer, Inc. direct on their toll-free line, 1-800-521-6233. They will be supplied with a \"retrofit kit\" and revised instruction free of charge.\n\nAbout the U.S. CPSC\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risk of injury or death associated with the use of thousands of types of consumer products. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product-related incidents cost the nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC's work to ensure the safety of consumer products has contributed to a decline in the rate of injuries associated with consumer products over the past 50 years.\n\nFederal law prohibits any person from selling products subject to a Commission ordered recall or a voluntary recall undertaken in consultation with the CPSC."
