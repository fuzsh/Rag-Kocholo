        "text": "Michigan has confirmed its first case of Eastern Equine Encephalitis, or EEE, of 2024 in a horse in Van Buren County.\n\nThe Horse, a standard filly, was not vaccinated against EEE, a viral disease spread through mosquito bites to animals and humans. Officials say it doesn't affect all animals, mainly horses.\n\n\"We try really hard to get the word out, veterinarians try really hard to get the word out for people to be vaccinating horses. It’s pretty deadly to horses, about 90% will succumb to the disease an not survive,\" said Nora Wineland, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Director of Animal Industry Division.\n\nBack in 2020, an outbreak of the disease in parts of Indiana pushing Elkhart County Commissioners and the Indiana Department of Health to issue a local disaster emergency declaration.\n\nEEE is typically seen in late summers to early fall and is not spread by animal-to-animal or animal-to-human.\n\n\"The infected mosquito would have to bite you or the horse for either to get sick,\" said Wineland.\n\nShe says there are telling signs when a horse contracts EEE, in this case fevers and loss of appetite.\n\n\"It was uncoordinated, stumbling, had some difficulty getting up, etc. It can vary, but those are the kind of signs that you would see and by then it’s too late,\" said Wineland.\n\nThere is currently no treatment available for EEE other than supportive care and trying to keep them as comfortable as possible, but there are many ways to keep your animal safe.\n\nIncluding keeping up with necessary vaccines for initial prevention.\n\n\"On the property make sure you don’t have mosquito breeding grounds. If you have anywhere where there is standing water, we’ve had a lot of rain recently, so that’s something to be checking for. Empty out those pails, don’t leave water buckets around,\" said Wineland.\n\nWineland also recommends putting animals under fans as mosquitos aren't strong flyers, or consider an insect repellant approved for the animal.\n\nOfficials say from dusk to Dawn, is the most vital time to be taking precautions when mosquitoes are out.\n\nHumans can protect themselves by applying insect repellent, maintaining window and doors screens and wearing long sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors."
