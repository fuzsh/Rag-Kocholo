He was my sunshine since the day he was born, and that of his father and sister as well.\n\nHe had a goofy grin that seemed plastered on his face, almost 100% of the time, with a sense of humor to match. There is nothing that Alec would not have done for friends, family and even strangers. He was a champion of the underdog and stood up to bullies on behalf of classmates at school.\n\nWhile out, if we saw a homeless person, Alec would always ask if we could purchase food for the person and bring it back to them. Once, he gave some burgers and fries to a man who was standing on a highway ramp with his dog. When Alec ran the food to him, the man first fed his dog and then offered some to Alec. Alec was stunned by that gesture, made by a man who had nothing else to offer. I was forever learning how to be a better person because of my son.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Alec was not a saint. He was rarely in trouble, but when it did happen, getting angry with him was almost impossible! He would hug me (sometimes lifting me off the floor) and look at me with that smile, making my anger disappear. Most of the time.\n\nAlec was 19 years old and engaged to be married. He was so incredibly full of life. He worked hard, played hard, loved fiercely and was devoted and loyal.\n\nWhat he did not do much, was sleep. After a long day of school, work and friends, I would tell him to get some sleep. Without fail, his response was always, \"Don't worry Mom, I'll sleep when I'm dead\".\n\nNow, he sleeps.\n\nSubmitted by Gretchen Catherwood\n\nLCpl Irvin Ceniceros\n\nIndia Co\n\nKIA 10/14/10\n\nLCpl Irvin M.

Joey grew up in a small home in Rosamond Ca, but his family was nothing near that. Joey was the stereotypical \"middle child\" of 5 boys. Growing up in a smaller home ensured that Joey and his 4 brothers were always together. Art Sr. and Tracy Pratti got all they hoped for with Joey and his brothers growing up together, as any parents of 5 boys would. Joey always had a love for sports, basketball mostly, he spent his youth helping his dad coach kids not too much younger than him. Joey enjoyed teaching kids about sports, as well as being a part of their lives in a positive manner. This is probably the reason why Joey was such a great uncle to his nieces. From a young age, Joey was the uncle that never got tired of playing with his nieces, he loved those kids like they were his own, and in his mind, he treated them like they were. Before Joey passed, his excitement to have a nephew was talked about all the time. Although Joey never got to see his nephews in the physical form, they talk about him like they know their uncle Joey personally. It wouldn't doubt us if Joey hasn't visited his nephews and nieces somehow or another, just to make sure they never forget him. Joey was much more than a hero to the nation, he was a loving son, brother and uncle that can never be replaced. Joey loved his family more than anything in the world, a close second would probably be the Phoenix Suns, a team he followed relentlessly since his young childhood. Joey's passing has left a hole in the Pratti family that can never be filled, but his spirit will never be lost, because he will live on with us all, forever.\n\nSubmitted by Arthur E Pratti\n\nCpl Brandon Pearson\n\nLima Co\n\nKIA 11/4/10\n\nMy Beloved Son\n\nBrandon was his father’s only son. His father writes:\n\nBrandon was extremely loyal to his friends, family, and brothers in arms. A phrase you would often hear him say is, “I’ve got your back…”. Those weren’t just hollow words for Brandon. He really meant it and demonstrated it on numerous occasions.\n\nI smile as I look back on his life and the energy, warmth, and happiness that he brought to everyone he touched. Even the challenging times that included quotes like, “What do you mean, Dad…?” and “It seemed like a good idea at the time.” are precious to me.\n\nWith every day that passes, I celebrate Brandon’s life and focus on those things that are truly important: Life, love, and the freedoms we all enjoy. Those like Brandon, who have sacrificed much to pursue a path defending our great nation already understand this. No father could be more proud than I am of Brandon. You will live in our hearts forever. We love you buddy.\n\nInside the flyers that were printed at his service was a poem. We chose that poem because I believe it is something that Brandon would have said.\n\nTo those I love and to those who loved me:\n\nWhen I am gone, release me, let me go.\n\nI have so many things to see and do.\n\nYou must not tie yourself to me with tears\n\nBe thankful for our beautiful years.\n\nI gave to you my love you can only guess,\n\nHow much you gave to me in happiness,\n\nI thank you for the love you each have shown,\n\nBut now it's time I traveled alone.\n\nSo grieve a while for me, if grieve you must.\n\nThen let your grief be comforted by trust.\n\nIt's only for a time that we must part\n\nSo, bless the memories within your heart.\n\nI won't be far away, for life goes on\n\nSo if you need me, call and I will come.\n\nThough you can't see or touch me, I'll be near\n\nAll my love around you soft and clear\n\nAnd then, when you must come this way alone,\n\nI'll greet you with a smile and say,\n\n\"Welcome Home\".\n\nThis is the poem that I believe inspires us to go on with our lives. I know that as I read this, I can feel Brandon listening with us, comforting us, living within us. Brandon, I love you and miss you.\n\nUntil we meet again…\n\nSubmitted by Michael Pearson\n\nLCpl Colton Rusk\n\nWeapons Co\n\nKIA 12/6/10\n\nLance Corporal COLTON W.

Born in Spokane, Washington on February 22, 1991 and grew up in St. Charles, Missouri. On 10/13/2010 nineteen-year-old Marine Lance Corporal Phillip Vinnedge gave his life defending our freedom. He will be missed by all that knew him, but never forgotten. Words cannot express how proud we are to be Phillip’s parents. Phillip was taken too early and our time together on this Earth too short, but Phillip would not want us to mourn his death, but instead to celebrate his life. Phillip believed that, “The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing”. This is how Phillip lived his life every day. Phillip was known for taking on new challenges with confidence, so it wasn’t a surprise when Phillip wanted to serve in the military. Since he was a young boy he knew what he wanted and didn’t waver from that decision. Phillip was 10-years old when the September 11th, 2001 attacks destroyed the World Trade Center changing his life and ours forever. He decided at that age that he was called to help defend his country. When he turned 17 he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. Phillip wanted to protect and serve our country. If you asked Phillip to tell you something about himself or to brag about himself his words would be “I’m now a United States Marine”. Phillip did not take his service in the Marines lightly. He readily and knowingly accepted that, as it came to pass, by serving our country he might have to make the ultimate sacrifice. Without hesitation Phillip was willing to do this. A couple of Phillip’s favorite quotes are, \"It’s kind of fun to do the impossible.” and, \"I haven't failed, I've found 10,000 ways that don't work\". Phillip would keep trying until he accomplished whatever challenge was given to him. Phillip loved life and lived life to its fullest each and every day. Please don’t mourn the loss of Phillip but celebrate the live that he lived. Always remember and don’t worry, ‘in one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night'. Please remember, “When you look upon Heaven's scene, you will see the streets are guarded by United States Marines\" and one of those Marines will be our son; LCpl Phillip Vinnedge.\n\nSubmitted by Dave and Julie Vinnedge\n\nCpl Tevan Nguyen\n\nKilo Co\n\nKIA 12/28/10\n\nI want to tell you how much I miss you. To your handsome face. I want to express to you, all the regret I hold within of all the things I wish I could change. Back in the time we shared together as children when the world was truly a happy place. My days are not the same. Never will be. I feel as though I've lost so much of my future already. To live a life without you is far more unbearable then one can imagine. I have not lost sight of your face. Every second of every day, you are in my mind. The world is changing but no matter how distorted it becomes, I will be thinking of you. Dear God, how I miss you.

If you wanted to know Jason it was not very hard to do. He was that one that everyone in a room wanted to know and be friends with. He had a smile and a laugh that would light up the room and also make you think there was more to it than that. Determined & stubborn, but in a way that made him the best of leaders. If there was something in his life, both Marines and outside that he wanted, there was nothing on this Earth that would stop him from it. Growing up, Jason had an adventuresome heart. He tried all there was to try, being a cowboy, a surfer, motorcycle rider, hunter, fisherman. Life was his play ground. People gravitated to Jason. His charisma knew no bounds, a trait so easily passed down from our father who always had a knack for making new friends everywhere he went, and one Jason learned so very easily. Once you had Jason's friendship you often found yourself in adventures as well. He was always ready to try something new or go someplace exciting, but there was always a calling for Jason in his heart, a tradition in our family to be a Marine. That was everything Jason ever wanted to be. In a family of Marines I will say there was no better Marine then Jason. He commanded not only the respect of his peers and brothers but their absolute loyalty; and rightfully so. There was nothing Jason would not do for his brothers, his Marines.\n\nSubmitted by Darin Peto\n\nLCpl Joseph Rodewald\n\nWeapons Co\n\nKIA 10/13/10\n\nHe was proud to be a United States Marine\n\nThe day that you were born\n\nOh how I began to pray\n\nSaying thanks to God for allowing me\n\nTo be your mom on that very special day\n\nI remember when you were little\n\nPracticing your salute\n\nYou were going to be a Marine someday\n\nChasing your dream in full pursuit\n\nTalking on the porch\n\nAlmost every day\n\nDiscussing how to enjoy life\n\nSo the sky is never gray\n\nYou finally were so happy\n\nThat you had found true love\n\nSaying how perfect it was\n\nReminding me of a dove\n\nYou fell in love with Kandi\n\nShe gave you strength to stand up tall\n\nAnd you marveled how she reached out\n\nEvery time you were about to fall\n\nI miss so much you being home\n\nI really cannot say\n\nThe aching in my heart\n\nWill never go away\n\nWhen the breeze blows\n\nI can feel your strong embrace\n\nI see your smiling eyes\n\nWhen the sun kisses my face\n\nYou lived each day\n\nLike it was your last\n\nAlways looking to the future\n\nAnd not dwelling on the past\n\nYou said you would have no regrets\n\nWhen your time on Earth was through\n\nWhen you hold my hand in Heaven\n\nJeremiah will be there to\n\nThe ultimate sacrifice\n\nThe price you proudly did pay\n\nLife changed forever\n\nOn that warm October day\n\nI love you unconditionally\n\nAnd am very proud, that’s true\n\nYou’re a true hero and marine\n\nThat bled red, white, and blue\n\nFor your country\n\nYou were ready to die\n\nStanding by your 3/5 brothers\n\nShouting Semper Fi\n\nWhen we are at our lowest\n\nYou whisper in our ear\n\nTelling us to be strong\n\nAnd to no more shed a tear\n\nYou touched so many lives\n\nAnd were loved by everyone\n\nAlways putting others first\n\nA mother’s perfect son\n\nSubmitted by Jacque (Rodey’s momma)\n\nLcpl James Stack\n\nIndia Co\n\nKIA 11/10/10\n\nLCpl James Stack was born on 11 JUL 1990.
