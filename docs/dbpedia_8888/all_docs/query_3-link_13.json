        "text": "Holidays Observed\n\nThe City of Los Angeles and Athens Services observe New Year’s Day, Independence Day (4th of July), Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. If the holiday falls on Monday – Friday, collection services for the remainder of the week will be delayed one day. Saturday and Sunday service will not be delayed.\n\nHoliday Tree and Foliage Recycling: For information on LA Sanitation’s holiday tree and foliage recycling program for residents and multi-family dwellers, click here.\n\nBusinesses customers can recycle their trees/foliage with Athens Services for a bulky-item collection fee. Click here for more information.\n\nTo schedule a bulky item pickup, please call LA Sanitation Customer Care Center 1-800-773-2489 (or 311) or visit My LA 311.\n\nOverweight or overfilled containers can result in non-collection or fees (if serviced). If your container(s) has not be collected, please correct the issue below and then contact the City of Los Angeles’ Customer Care Center at (800) 773-2489 (or 311) or visit www.recycLA.com to schedule a pickup. Extra service fees will apply.\n\nOverweight: Containers that cannot be safely moved and/or emptied by personnel and/or equipment are considered overweight. To avoid issues do not place material such as concrete, roof shingles, sand, or other construction and demolition material into your container. To schedule temporary service for construction and demolition projects, click here. If the container is not collected, customers are required to remove inappropriate materials and reschedule their collection.\n\nOverfilled: When container lids do not completely close due to excess material and/or when material is placed outside the container, this is considered overfilled. Place all refuse inside of the container(s) with the lids fully closed. Any refuse placed alongside, on top of, or above the sides of container is considered “overfilled” and will not be collected. To make more room in your container, flatten all boxes prior to disposal. To address overfill issues, consider ordering a one-time pickup when necessary or increase your overall level of service.\n\nOrganic material contributes up to 35% of waste in LA’s landfills, which through anaerobic decomposition produces the second largest anthropogenic source of methane in California. Los Angeles is also home to almost 1.5 million food-insecure people, the largest estimated food-insecure population in the United States. Creating a robust, full spectrum organics programs to decrease food waste before it even reaches the dumpster will not only help the City meet its waste diversion goals, it supports the social, economic, and environmental well-being of Angelenos.\n\nGive unwanted items new life through donation. Not only will you reduce waste to landfill and save resources, you may be helping someone in need. Check your local listing for thrift stores that take used appliances, books, clothing, furniture, working electronics, tools, toys, and more. Schools and day care centers may want gently used toys, books, magazines, computers, office and party supplies, and misc. items for crafts.\n\nFor additional information on donating reusable materials, please visit AthensServices.com/MaterialReuse.\n\nL.A. SHARES\n\nDonations Department\n\n(213) 485-1097\n\nDonate@LAShares.org\n\nLAShares.org\n\nL.A. SHARES is a nonprofit materials reuse program. Through their interactive website, they are able to take donations of reusable goods and materials (both new and used) from Los Angeles businesses and then redistribute the items FREE-OF-CHARGE to nonprofits and schools in the City of Los Angeles. To donate or receive material, please register on their website and review what can and cannot be accepted."
