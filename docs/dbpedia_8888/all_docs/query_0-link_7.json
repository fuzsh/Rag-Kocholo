        "text": "Before he became a wrestler, Chase was a mascot of a minor baseball team known as Memphis Sliders known as Ribbie. He is the only wrestler to not jump ship to any brand following the showcase.\n\nHe made an appearance in a non-televised event on NXT against the male superstar in a losing effort. Despite that loss, he would continue to train with him and direct message him back ever since.\n\nBy WWE 2K23, it is implied that Chase was kicked out of the Performance Center due to his constant conspiracy theories on why he was never signed to a brand.\n\nHector Flores is a Mexican professional wrestler. He is signed with WWE, where he performs on the NXT brand. In secret, he is the son of El Mago and has a vendetta against him surrounding El Mago Jr. He is the winner of the 2021 NXT Breakout tournament.\n\nHe returns in WWE 2K23 for a show in Mexico, but at the same time, he has a personal issue with Los Lotharios where he refuses to join. He teams with the former Lock and Chosen in a Trios match against El Mago Jr, El Ordinardo, and Cole Quinn where they emerged victorious, but was later attacked by Los Latharios and Santos Escobar forming Legado del Latharios. This would build up to a mask vs. hair match. He wants to cancel the match but Chosen isn't backing down without a fight. They would defeat Legado del Latharios and have the three latter's hair shave.\n\nHe became the first member of Lock's faction in a fight against Evolution/The Hurt Business.\n\nChosen is a Japanese professional wrestler who competes on indie promotions, including his home country. Despite his ego when it comes to social media as well as his disrespect to The Lock, he is the best high flyer wrestler in all of indie promotions. He is first seen at the airport promoting Pro Wrestling Japan's Apex Tournament. He would trick the former Lock to admit he is the greatest, should he accept. He is one of the two finalists of the tournament, along with the former Lock.\n\nHe then visits Mexico for another promotion to team with the former Lock and Hector Flores in a Trios match against El Mago Jr, El Ordinardo, and Cole Quinn where they emerged victorious. Following the attack by newly formed Legado del Lotharios, Chosen challenged them to a mask vs. hair match, which Santos accept. They would defeat Legado del Lotharios and have the latter three get their hairs shave. Following their victory, he would give the former Lock a mutual sign of respect, revealing he actually looked up to him for his willingness to take risks but lost respect for him for towing the WWE line when they signed him. He would return to Japan to battle the former Lock in a two out of falls match for both NXT UK titles, but he was unsuccessful.\n\nHe makes an unexpected appearance on Raw during the former Lock's no holds barred match against Bron Breakker where he stopped Orton's interference with a diving leg drop from the top rope, saving the former Lock's WWE career. He would join his faction to go to war in WarGames where his team picked up a victory and get to choose the stipulation for the WWE title match at SummerSlam. Before the former Lock chooses the stipulation, he is one of four faction members who will accompany him to stop Shawn Michaels' interference.\n\nHe also makes a small appearance in \"The Legacy\" mode where he hears rumors from Mark and Tasia about Ava's walking out on LJ during the tag team match against Zoey Stark and Nikkita Lyons on the same day he released a video. He would later confront LJ before the triple threat tornado tag match about the situation between her and her tag partner.\n\nGabriel Slade is an American professional wrestler signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand. According to him when being recorded by Kat, he is a three-time United States champion, two-time Intercontinental champion, and a multi-time tag team champion.\n\nDuring the Lock's match against Ridge Holland, Sami comes in and attack the Lock with his chain. When Sami and Ridge try to push the safe on top of the Lock, Gabriel comes in to save him. The next week on Raw, management booked him and the Lock to a tag team match against Sami Zayn and Ridge Holland, should the Lock agree to team with him.\n\nAfter the former Lock was fired from WWE, he went on to continue his push by winning the Royal Rumble, and then the WWE Championship.\n\nOn the final Raw before SummerSlam, Shawn Michaels and his faction made a change of plan. Because of Slade ignoring Shawn's order and lost to Team Lock at WarGames, he was forced to lie down to let Orton get the pinfall and take his place. Without hesitation, he willingly forced to lie down. At SummerSlam, with the referee busy with the superstar accompanying the former Lock to stop Shawn's interference, Slade came in and attack Orton with his own RKO, effectively left the group.\n\nSlade reappeared in 2K24's Undisputed optional storyline: \"Dual Duel\", demanding the Dark Horse a shot at the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. Following the Dark Horse's successful defense, he reverted back to his original look, claiming he was Gabriel Slade."
