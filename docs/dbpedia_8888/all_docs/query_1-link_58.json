        "text": "EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP, N.J. (CBS) -- Two people were killed and seven were taken to hospitals after a multi-vehicle crash on the Black Horse Pike in Atlantic County Friday evening, police said.\n\nPleasantville and Egg Harbor Township police said several cars were involved in the crash that happened on the 8000 block of Black Horse Pike Friday after 8 p.m.\n\nThe crash happened when a 2017 Nissan Sentra driving westbound traveled into oncoming traffic and struck a 2018 Kia Forte, the Egg Harbor Township Police said. The head-on crash pushed the Kia backwards and it was then rear-ended by a 2020 Nissan Sentra.\n\nThe 2020 Nissan veered off the road and the Kia was sent into the marsh along the road. The 2017 Nissan caught fire after the head-on collision.\n\nThe driver of the Kia, a 21-year-old Atlantic City man; and someone in the 2017 Nissan Sentra, a 22-year-old Pleasantville woman, were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nSeven other people were taken to hospitals as a result of the crash. A juvenile male passenger in the 2017 Nissan was taken to AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Atlantic City in critical condition, and a female juvenile passenger was flown to Cooper University Hospital in critical condition. Another man in that vehicle was also taken to AtlantiCare with serious injuries.\n\nA male in the Kia was taken to AtlantiCare with serious injuries, and two people in the 2020 Nissan were hospitalized with minor injuries.\n\nA man who helped get people out of the burning 2017 Nissan was also taken to a hospital and police did not know his condition.\n\nOther people passing by also stopped to help, Egg Harbor Township Police said.\n\n\"There were multiple witnesses and other passing motorists who then stopped and assisted in dragging the occupants of the Nissan out of the vehicle before it completely engulfed in flames. We are thankful for those individuals who quickly and selflessly acted,\" Chief Frederick Spano said in a news release.\n\nThe Black Horse Pike was shut down in both directions as authorities investigated the crash, according to police. The road has since reopened.\n\nChopper 3 was over the crash where parts of the dismantled vehicles were seen scattered around the roadway.\n\nBusinesses along this stretch of the highway have Pleasantville mailing addresses, but the area is located within the West Atlantic City section of Egg Harbor Township."
