The ribs should pull off the bone cleanly without falling off the bone or being mushy. The bone itself should retain slight moisture, or sweat, once the meat has been pulled away, but not have pieces of rib meat clinging to it; the bone should not be completely dry after the bite is taken. The meat should have a degree of smoky flavor without being harsh or acrid. The ribs may be either sauced or un-sauced, but there should not be “puddling” of sauce in the presentation container. If you want to make a bed of lettuce or parsley or some other presentation, feel free, but it WILL NOT be a judging parameter.\n\nBRISKET: Brisket should be cut approximately ¼” thick, (about the width of a #2 pencil), generally from the flat, and should exhibit a defined smoke ring around the outside of the meat. The meat should be juicy and tender, not dry or tough; it shouldn’t fall apart upon slicing but should pull apart with a gentle tug (picture a slice draped over a thin knife blade-it should seem as if gravity is slowly pulling the meat apart). The slices should be uniform in width, should be evenly and uniformly cooked, and should not be tough or mushy. The meat should have a degree of smoky flavor without being harsh or acrid. The brisket may be sauced or un-sauced, but there should not be a “puddling” of sauce in the presentation container. If you want to make a bed of lettuce or parsley or some other presentation, feel free, but it WILL NOT be a judging parameter.\n\nYou will be given two food trays with your contestant # on the inside of the lid. For brisket, 5-6 slices must be in the container and ready for judging – you will be given a time to turn in your meat. The rest of the brisket should be ready to serve to the public (by you) at 5:30 Sharp. The rest of the ribs in your racks must be cut into individual ribs (count and cut the two little end ribs as one rib) and be ready for public consumption at 5:30 PM sharp. At 5:30, the public will be able to “buy” ribs or brisket with tickets purchased at the door-you must be at your table and you must take 1 ticket for each rib or 2 oz of brisket. The number of tickets sold will be nearly equal to the number of meat given out to contestants.\n\nSmoke Off Schedule:\n\nFriday: May 3rd\n\n6 pm – Pros can set up in the smoking area and meat pick-up begins.\n\n6 pm-12 am – Taproom will provide beer specials for contestants.\n\nSaturday: May 4th\n\n7 am – Amateurs start setting up and meat pick-up begins.\n\n7 am-11 am – Taproom is open for contestants for beer specials and breakfast is open in the Commons Market.\n\n11 am – Taproom, smoking area, and Beer Garten are open to the public (wristbands and food tickets become available – 10 tix max per person)\n\n1 pm – Live music begins w/Shane Bond\n\n3:30 pm Chris Canas Band\n\n4:30 pm – Brisket and Rib turn-ins begin (pros and amateurs – you will have times on your containers to drop off)\n\n5:30 pm – Brisket and Ribs available for public purchase\n\n6:00 pm Jake Kershaw\n\n8:00 pm – Announcement of the 2024 Smoke Off winners!\n\nLast call for alcohol 15 Mins before close!"
