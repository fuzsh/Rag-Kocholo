        "text": "1.\n\nHurricane 03:51\n\n2.\n\nSeasons Four 05:05\n\nA breath of scented air in fields so cold and stark The rising of the sun will banish Winter’s dark And in the sky above a bird has taken wing She sings as if to say behold another Spring Every circle round the sun I count the seasons four Still I wonder what the future has in store The day we met will never fade into a dream I can’t forget the moments stolen in between Running through my seasons traces of desire With all the passion and the heat of Summer’s fire Every circle round the sun I count the seasons four Still I wonder what the future has in store When the Autumn rains hide the Summer sun Secrets in the shadows hint of things to come But I’m remembering the innocence of Spring Where has the season gone that promised everything Every circle round the sun I count the seasons four Still I wonder have we all been here before We join the dance around the sun seasons passing one by one Now I see the Winter’s come to be my partner in this dance Every circle round the sun I count the seasons four Every circle round the sun I count the seasons four Every circle round the sun I count the seasons four Every circle round the sun I count the seasons four\n\n3.\n\nBreakaway 05:00\n\nI’ve spent a lifetime living up to promises made there’s no grand design or sacred truth I’ve saved but I’ve chased my dreams and they’ve chased me nothing ventured nothing’s gained but nothing’s for free If you go down to the river to pray you wind up cursing your fate anyway sometimes you’ve got to plant your feet and stay sometimes you break away I fight the current you know I’d rather swim upstream but that’s no deterrent it just makes me mean so don’t throw me a lifeline for fear I’ll go down if I can’t make that shore I’d soon as drown cho It makes you a loner builds you up to feel like a king but then the temple crashes down and changes everything you still ride the tiger and he rides you take a chance, twist that tail now who’s got who If you go down to the river to pray you wind up cursing you fate anyway sometimes you’ve got to plant your feet and stay sometimes you break away\n\n4.\n\nYou've Got Your Reasons 05:23\n\nSo you’re leaving me you’ve made up your mind And it has to be the way you decide No convincing you to stay one more time Cause you swear it’s true somehow I’ve crossed a line What I can’t understand, and I never will How you say you still love me, that’s a bitter pill I stand here alone, as you walk out the door Darling, you’ve got your reasons, I’m sure You’ve got your reasons All that we’ve been through we could make a new start What you mean to do will tear us apart Darling, can’t you see together we’re strong Why must something good always turn out so wrong What I can’t understand, and I never will How you say you still love me, that’s a bitter pill I stand here alone, as you walk out the door Darling, you’ve got your reasons, I’m sure You’ve got your reasons So I’ll se you free It’s hard I confess But it’s what you need no doubts, no regrets What will be will be there’s no place to hide And it’s killing me that you won’t tell me why What I can’t understand, and I never will How you say you still love me, that’s a bitter pill You’re walking away, and my heart hits the floor Darling, you’ve got your reasons, I’m sure You’ve got your reasons\n\n5.\n\nEvil Woman (in album) 04:13\n\nWell it was after midnight she was by herself That’s when I began to feel like I was someone else When she looked around deadly was her aim And I was fascinated like a moth before a flame Evil woman how you hypnotize Trouble’s comin’ I can see it in your eyes If I could tell the future I’d have heard a warning bell I felt like I was falling like a stone into her well When her arms found me that was all it took If passion’s just a word I swear she must have wrote the book Evil woman how you hypnotize Trouble’s comin’ I can see it in your eyes She’s a gypsy woman yeah, she’s a voodoo child She can cast a spell like Cleopatra on the Nile Ruin and misfortune better curse your fate ‘Cause if you ever meet her it’s already much too late Evil woman how you hypnotize Trouble’s comin’ I can see it in your eyes Evil woman how you hypnotize Trouble’s comin’ I can see it in your eyes Evil woman how you hypnotize Trouble’s comin’ I can see it in your eyes\n\n6.\n\nSince You've Been Gone 07:11\n\nI try to tell myself there’s no one to blame things just happen people change I never saw this ending but I’ll be strong pick the pieces up move along there’s nothing I can do but carry on since you’ve been gone It’s the same sad story so often told how lives can drift apart and hearts grow cold I thought our lives together the love we’d sown fell on fertile ground not on stone but now I’m left to wonder why I’m alone since you’ve been gone The things we prize the most we fail to hold I thought I’d found in you my kindred soul if there’s a God in heaven I’ll never know till my spirit’s left behind this flesh and bone tonight my heavy heart can’t find its’ way home since you’ve been gone since you’ve been gone\n\n7.\n\nI hate the night, when I can’t sleep I just see your face And it’s not right, what I feel for you is out of place I believe, you’ll understand someday somehow But here’s the only way, I can say what’s in my heart right now ‘Cause I’ve got a feeling that you’re what I need Darling can’t you see, you’ve got a hold on me You’ve got a hold on me After every time we meet, I feel so incomplete Love me or let me be You’ve got a hold on me No lovers’ dream, can set me free in this lonely room A silent scream, of a desert rose that never blooms In burning sand, the leaves like bones begin to bleach And die of thirst, with you the water just out of reach I need the rain falling down on me Darling can’t you see, you’ve got a hold on me You’ve got a hold on me After every time we meet, I feel so incomplete Love me or let me be You’ve got a hold on me It’s not the words you say, no special magic in the things you do That makes me stay, one heart can sense when another’s true Can there be, a different world some place in time I give you more, than the love imprisoned in these lines Open your heart, ‘cause you’ve got the key To come and set me free, you’ve got a hold on me You’ve got a hold on me After every time we meet, I feel so incomplete Love me or let me be You’ve got a hold on me You’ve got a hold on me After every time we meet, I feel so incomplete Love me or let me be You’ve got a hold on me\n\n8.\n\nBetter Days 05:32\n\nWalkin’ along the windy shoreline in my dream, Wonderin’ about The joy you give me when I see your smilin’ face Callin’ me There’ve been better days in love with you My heart’s on fire from the pain Don’t you feel the same way I do girl Can’t you see that I’m a man without love You mean more to me than the stars above Can’t you see it’s only me….. Thinkin’ about all the times we enjoyed Sharin’ Love Smiles on our faces and warmth in our hearts We rose above Come with me we’ll fly away my love On we go to find our high Open up our hearts, they know the way Can’t you see that I’m a man without love You mean more to me than the stars above Can’t you see it’s only me…. Passin’ the night by I see daylight is near Callin’ me To wake and face another day all alone By the way…. There’ve been better days in love with you My heart’s on fire from the pain Don’t you feel the same way I do girl Can’t you see that I’m a man without love You mean more to me than the stars above Can’t you see it’s only me….. Can’t you see it’s only me…. Can’t you see it’s only me….\n\n9.\n\nNo Good 05:49"
