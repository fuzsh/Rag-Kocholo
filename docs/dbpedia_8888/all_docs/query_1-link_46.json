        "text": "Building on our love of twin fins, we’ve kept an array of the design features that made our OG Baron one of the most widely loved boards of all time, maintaining equal parts old school speed and new school flair. The Baron Flyer has foam in all the right places to float over soft sections and fly down the line, yet still allow you to lay it on rail or bust the fins even when you’re going Mach 10.\n\nSlightly more curve than the original Black Baron ensures you’ve got enough rocker to fit right in the pocket, yet still generate and maintain plenty of speed. This is complemented by a moderate single concave running into double concave, providing extra lift and liveliness, and complemented by a balanced, manoeuvrable plan shape. The other main change is an even flatter deck, with low rails. And of course, the round tail with a flyer allows us to maintain more width through the middle but with a relatively pulled in tail. So, ride your Baron Flyer ¼” wider than your OG Black Baron dims.\n\nFin positioning is also moved further forward to maintain balance between release and control, due to the tail pod being much narrower than the OG Black Baron. This prompts quick, reliable engagement and easy rail to rail transitions, even in weak conditions. Whatever surf you choose to ride it in, the Baron Flyer gives you the freedom to take new lines and go faster than ever in small waves.\n\nTEAM RIDER REFERENCE:\n\nACE BUCHAN Height: 5’9” (179 cm) // Weight: 73 kg - 160 lbs\n\n*Rides 5'4” x 19 3/4” x 2 1/4” = 26.8L\n\nCONNER COFFIN Height: 5’8” (173 cm) // Weight: 75 kg - 165 lbs\n\n*Rides 5'5” x 20” x 2 5/16” = 28.2L\n\nJULIAN WILSON Height: 6’0” (183 cm) // Weight: 80 kg - 176 lbs\n\n*Rides 5'6” x 20 1/4” x 2 3/8” = 29.5L\n\nRYAN CALLINAN Height: 6’0” (183 cm) // Weight: 80 kg - 176 lbs\n\n*Rides 5'6” x 20 1/4” x 2 3/8” = 29.5L\n\nJOEL PARKINSON Height: 6’0” (183 cm) // Weight: 87 kg - 192 lbs\n\n*Rides 5'8” x 20 3/4” x 2 1/2” = 32.5L"
