Perhaps his greatest fame, however, came as the most successful sire of the second half of the nineteenth century; he was the leading sire in North America 16 times, and broodmare sire of many notable racehorses.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nLexington was a bay colt bred by Elisha Warfield at Warfield's stud farm, The Meadows, near Lexington, Kentucky. Lexington was by the Hall of Fame inductee, Boston (by Timoleon by Sir Archy) from Alice Carneal by Sarpedon. He was inbred in the third and fourth generations (3m × 4f) to Sir Archy. Lexington stood 15.3 hands (63 inches, 160 cm) and was described as having good conformation though he had a distinctive \"moose head\" profile. At stud, he developed a willful and somewhat vicious temperament.[1][2]\n\nRacing record\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder the name of \"Darley\" Lexington easily won his first two races for Warfield and his partner, \"Burbridge's Harry\", a.k.a. Harry Lewis, a former slave turned well-known horse trainer. Lewis, being black, was not allowed to enter \"Darley\" in races in his own name, so the horse ran in Warfield's name and colors.[3] Darley caught the eye of Richard Ten Broeck who asked Warfield to name his price. \"Darley\", the son of Boston, and Jarret were sold in 1853 to Ten Broeck acting on behalf of a syndicate who would rename him Lexington. Affixed to Lexington's pedigree Warfield wrote: \"The colt was bred by me, as was also his dam, which I now and will ever, own...E. Warfield.\"\n\nA syndicate made up of Richard Ten Broeck, General Abe Buford, Captain Willa Viley, and Junius R. Ward, bought Lexington for $2,500 between heats (or during the running of his race), so tried claiming the purse money when he won. Failing that, he tried to deduct the purse money from the sale price. But Warfield held out. His new owners immediately sent Lexington to Natchez, Mississippi to train under J. B. Pryor.\n\nLexington raced at age three and four and although he only competed seven times, many of his races were grueling four-mile events. Lexington won six of his seven races and finished second once. One of his wins was the Phoenix Hotel Handicap in 1853. On April 2, 1855, at the Metairie race course in New Orleans, he set a record running four miles in 7 minutes, 19 3⁄4 seconds, running against time.[4] Even with his complex and hard-fought rivalry with the horse Lecomte (also a son of Boston, both born just after Boston died), he was known as the best race horse of his day. His second match with Lecomte on April 14, 1855, was considered one of the greatest matches of the century. But Lexington had to be retired at the end of 1855 as a result of poor eyesight. His sire, Boston, had also gone blind. Conservation work in 2010 revealed that Lexington had had a massive facial infection that resulted in his going blind.[5]\n\nStud record\n\n[edit]\n\nLexington stood for a time at the Nantura Stock Farm of Uncle John Harper in Midway, Kentucky, along with the famous racer and sire, Glencoe. Sold to Robert A. Alexander for $15,000 in 1858, reportedly the then highest price ever paid for an American horse, Lexington was sent to Alexander's Woodburn Stud at Spring Station, Kentucky.\n\nHe stood for a price of $100 until 1861, when he first led the sire list, and it was increased to $200.[4] He stood for a limited public fee of $500, the highest in the country and comparable to the leading English stallions, in 1865 and 1866 before being restricted to private stud duties only.[4]\n\nCalled \"The Blind Hero of Woodburn\", Lexington became the leading sire in North America sixteen times, from 1861 through 1874, and then again in 1876 and 1878.[6] Lexington was the sire of the undefeated Asteroid and Norfolk.[7] Nine of the first fifteen Travers Stakes were won by one of his sons or daughters. Among his noted progeny are:\n\nFoaled Name Sex Major Wins/Achievements 1857[8] Idlewild Mare[9] Notable racer 1860[8] Cincinnati Stallion General Ulysses S. Grant's favorite horse.

Lexington, 15 years old and blind, had to be hidden away to save him from such a fate. He was sent to Illinois for this purpose.[4]\n\nLexington died at Woodburn on July 1, 1875, and was buried in a casket in front of the stables. A few years later, in 1878, his owner, through the auspices of J.M. Toner, donated the horse's bones to the U.S. National Museum (the Smithsonian Institution).[18] The pioneering taxidermist Henry Augustus Ward of Ward's Natural Science in Rochester, New York, was called in to supervise the disinterment and preparation of the skeleton. For many years the specimen was exhibited in the Osteology Hall of the National Museum of Natural History. In 1999, Lexington was part of the exhibition \"On Time\", at the National Museum of American History, where he helped illustrate the history of the first mass-produced stopwatch that split time into fractions of seconds—which was supposedly developed to document Lexington's feats on the race course. In 2010, Smithsonian conservators prepared the skeleton for loan to the International Museum of the Horse in Lexington, Kentucky, in time for the World Equestrian Games in Kentucky, the first time these games had been held outside of Europe.[19]\n\nLexington's dominance in the pedigrees of American-bred Thoroughbreds, and the fact that the British Thoroughbred breeders considered him not a purebred, was a large factor in the so-called Jersey Act of 1913, in which the British Jockey Club limited the registration of horses not traced completely to horses in the General Stud Book.[20]\n\nSummary of Stud Career[4] Year Rank in Sire List Starters Races Won Money Won 1859 7th 7 10 $6,700 1860 2nd 12 37 $22,295 1861 1st 13 27 $22,245 1862 1st 5 14 $9,700 1863 1st 10 25 $14,235 1864 1st 13 38 $28,440 1865 1st 31 87 $58,750 1866 1st 34 112 $92,795 1867 1st 33 86 $54,030 1868 1st 36 92 $68,340 1869 1st 36 81 $56,375 1870 1st 35 82 $120,360 1871 1st 40 102 $109,095 1872 1st 28 82 $71,515 1873 1st 23 71 $71,565 1874 1st 23 70 $51,899 1875 3rd 30 33 $32,245 1876 1st 21 34 $90,570 1877 2nd 20 29 $32,815 1878 1st 16 36 $60,195 1879 7th 15 19 $17,439.50 1880 17th 9 12 $9,297.50 1881 17th 6 7 $1,055 1882 17th 3 1 $255 Totals 499 1,187 $1,102,211\n\nLexington did additionally have one foal start in 1858 as a two-year-old, finishing second in a single start.[4]\n\nHonors\n\n[edit]\n\nLexington was part of the first group of horses inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1955. The Belmont Lexington Stakes runs every year at Belmont Park in honor of Lexington, as does the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland Race Course.\n\nOn Tuesday, August 31, 2010 the Smithsonian loaned Lexington's skeleton to the International Museum of the Horse at the Kentucky Horse Park, to be exhibited there through August 2013.[21][19]\n\nLexington served as the model for the top of the Woodlawn Vase, given to the winner of the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico.[22]\n\nLexington was exhibited at the 1859 Great St. Louis Fair.[4]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nLexington was the leading sire in North America a record 16 times. His sire line originally flourished, especially through Norfolk (who in turn produced champions Emperor of Norfolk and El Rio Rey), but then faced increasing competition from European imports. His last known male progeny was Conquering Elk (b. 1987).[23][24] However, his influence on the pedigrees of the modern Thoroughbred can still be felt through his daughters, who produced winners Spendthrift, Himyar, Hanover, and Bramble.[25][26] Himyar in turn established a sire line that has survived into the 21st century through Holy Bull,[27] who sired both 2005 Kentucky Derby winner Giacomo and 2000 Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Mucho Uno. In turn, Mucho Uno sired 2013 Breeders' Cup Classic winner Mucho Macho Man, the sire of 2020 Pegasus World Cup winner Mucho Gusto.[28][29] Likewise, the Spendthrift line has survived into the 21st century through Tiznow, who won the Breeders Cup Classic in consecutive years (2000, 2001); he in turn produced 2008 Belmont Stakes winner Da' Tara, and 2008 Santa Anita Derby and Travers Stakes winner Colonel John.\n\nLexington is the subject of the best selling novel Horse by Geraldine Brooks, published in 2022. [30][31]\n\nSire line tree\n\n[edit]\n\nPedigree\n\n[edit]\n\nSome of the horses in Lexington's pedigree cannot be traced back to England's General Stud Book, a fact that can probably be attributed to the disruptions and sometimes hazardous record keeping in the period between the American Revolution and Civil War.[1] The pedigree shown on The Jockey Club's Equineline database is thus incomplete, not showing the dams of Timoleon, Florizel and the Alderman Mare.[61] The pedigree shown below fills in those gaps based on American records.\n\nLexington is usually said to descend from family 12-b[1] in the female line through his third dam Lady Grey. However, the mitochondrial DNA of descendants of Lady Grey is inconsistent with that of other members of family 12-b, indicating a likely mismatch.[62]\n\nPedigree of Lexington, bay stallion, 1850 Sire\n\nBoston\n\nChestnut 1833 Timoleon\n\nChestnut 1814 Sir Archy*\n\nBay 1805 Diomed* Castianira Saltram mare\n\nCh. 1801 Saltram Symme's Wildair Mare Ball's Florizel Mare\n\nChestnut 1814 Ball's Florizel Diomed* Shark Mare Alderman Mare\n\n1799 Alderman Clockfast Mare Dam\n\nAlice Carneal\n\nBay 1836 Sarpedon\n\nBay 1828 Emilius Orville Emily Icaria The Flyer Parma Rowena\n\nChestnut 1826 Sumpter Sir Archy*^ Robin Redbreast Mare Lady Grey Robin Grey Maria (family: 12-b)\n\n* Lexington is inbred 3S x 4D to the stallion Sir Archy, meaning that he appears third generation on the sire side of his pedigree and fourth generation on the dam side of his pedigree.\n\n*^ Lexington is inbred 4S x 4S x 5D to the stallion Diomed, meaning that he appears fourth generation twice on the sire side of his pedigree and fifth generation once (through Sir Archy)^ on the dam side of his pedigree.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of racehorses\n\nList of leading Thoroughbred racehorses\n\nHorsemanship of Ulysses S.
