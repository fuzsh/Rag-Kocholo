        "text": "Davis Payne\n\nLos Angeles Kings assistant Davis Payne (right, standing) could be a candidate for the Flyers' head coach position. (Doug Pensinger/Getty Images)\n\nThe expected big names emerged as candidates to become the Flyers' next coach as soon as Craig Berube was fired last Friday, some of whom still have jobs.\n\nTodd McLellan, who parted ways with San Jose on Monday, now is available.\n\nYou've got Dan Bylsma, who won a Stanley Cup with Pittsburgh and is looking for work.\n\nJeremy Roenick on Todd McLellan:\n\nDetroit's Mike Babcock, considered by many as the best coach in hockey, will be a free agent this summer.\n\nMeantime, Arizona's Dave Tippett, highly respected, might opt out of his deal.\n\nAccording to a Flyers source, Tippett would be the most likely to end up in Philadelphia if all four become available.\n\nThe source is hearing Pittsburgh has the best shot of getting Babcock, if he leaves Detroit, with Penguins co-owner Mario Lemieux said to be willing to offer whatever it takes money wise as well as a GM title to go along with head coach.\n\nMeantime, the source offered up a dark-horse candidate for the Flyers' position, Los Angeles Kings assistant coach Davis Payne.\n\nPayne, 44, was an assistant for the 2012-13 season in LA when Flyers GM Ron Hextall was assistant there under Dean Lombardi and before that was the St. Louis Blues' head coach for parts of three seasons, building a 67-55-15 record.\n\n\"Payne is a guy who got hired by (Kings GM) Dean Lombardi when Hextall was there and when he was in St. Louis his teams played hard for him,\" the source told NJ Advance Media. \"Before that he won a championship in the East Coast League. \"That's a name that comes to mind who Hextall could go after.\"\n\nPayne spending the last three seasons in LA as an assistant to Darryl Sutter, their 2013-14 Cup team among them, has to help his chances of becoming a legit candidate. Hextall, after all, has so much respect for Lombardi and the Kings that he's changed how Flyers management operates to try mimicking LA, which won two Cups in three years before missing the playoffs this season.\n\nPayne's coaching resume is impressive, as the closest he's come to having a losing record in 11 seasons as a head coach came when he was fired the Blues with a 6-7 record early into the 2011-12.\n\n\"I just try to work with the players to get everything from them that they can give,\" Payne told NHL.com in November 2013. \"I want my teams to be aggressive, to relentlessly go after the puck.\""
