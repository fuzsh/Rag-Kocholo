        "text": "Due to ongoing construction in the picnic and beach area, the park has a reduced capacity and is likely to close its gates during busy weekends. Guests at the park are going to see construction equipment and fencing obstructing views and access to the beach in areas along the shoreline. While most impact will occur during the month of June, construction is not expected to be completed until the end of August.\n\nThis content takes priority over any other information provided on this park's webpage.\n\nStarting Nov. 1, 2024, all cabins and camping cabins will be closed for major renovations. The anticipated completion of the total renovation project is May 2026. Keep in mind a project of this magnitude could result in schedule changes. We are excited to lovingly restore these historic cabins to sustain them for future generations.\n\nThe park is open daily dawn to dusk. The park office and Visitor Center are open daily from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nContact Station: Open Fridays, 10 a.m.-10 p.m., Saturdays, 8 a.m.-8 p.m., and Sundays, 8 a.m.-6 p.m. Hours of Operation are weather and staffing dependent. When closed, to pay parking fees, you may go to the park Visitor Center during operating hours, use a yellow self-pay parking envelope, or go to vasp.fun/Parking to pay by Credit Card.\n\nCamp Store Hours:\n\nThursday 9 a.m. - 4 p.m.\n\nFriday 10 a.m. - 6 p.m.\n\nSaturday 10 a.m. - 6 p.m.\n\nSunday 9 a.m. - 4 p.m.\n\nMonday 9 a.m. - 1 p.m.\n\nBoat Rental Hours:\n\nSaturday - Sunday 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.\n\nLast rental 4 p.m., all boats must be returned by 5 p.m. Weather permitting.\n\nConcession Stand Hours:\n\nSaturday 10 a.m. - 5 p.m.\n\nSunday Noon - 4:30 p.m.\n\nCabins and campsites are available for rent.\n\nCliff-side Cabins 19-25 have been removed from inventory due to cliff erosion to the access road.\n\nThe swimming facility is closed permanently due to major mechanical issues that cannot be resolved.\n\nDue to critical infrastructure issues, the Potomac River Retreat is no longer available for rental.\n\nPlease review the Virginia State Parks Know Before You Go information before you visit."
