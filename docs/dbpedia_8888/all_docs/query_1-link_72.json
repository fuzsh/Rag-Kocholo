        "text": "How we do it…\n\nTraining happens year round at our home facility. We continue to learn and grow by working with some of the top judges, coaches, and vaulters from around the world.\n\nCoach Heather has over 30 years experience in the horse world, wearing various hats such as competing in the hunter/jumpers, foaling and training horses. Heather is the lunger and coach for our club, which includes various levels of vaulters. She foaled out Jump Start, our first vaulting horse, and has trained him to vault. Coach Heather will be the first to tell you that you can always continue to learn in this sport, as she works with and learns from some of the top coaches in the world.\n\nCoach Justin has served in the United States Marine Corps from 2002-2006 where he’s gained valuable strength training and conditioning knowledge. Coach Justin has been coaching various sports, such as, soccer, wrestling, track, and now equestrian vaulting for over 8 years. Working with today’s youth and helping them reach their full potential is his goal for this team.\n\nHannah is currently in her 5th year of vaulting and has been training to compete at the Bronze Level. She frequently travels domestically and internationally with the U.S. Senior Squad as their “flyer”. Her goals are set with medaling individually at the Junior Level when she turns 14 years of age.\n\nWas foaled on our farm March 15th, 2009. He was 3 weeks overdue and was unable to stand when he was born. The first 3 days of his life was dependent on Heather lifting him to his feet every 3 hrs. Hence how he got his name “Jump Start”, as his life needed a jump start. Jump Start is a 17.1h Oldenburg. He carries our tiny tots all the way up to silver vaulter.\n\nBeast is a Gypsy Vanner/Quarter Horse. He is a 9 yr old 15h paint gelding. In 2019 Beast joined our team. He is wonderful with all the little kids as he will let them do anything including paint him. Hannah rides, lunges, and is training him for canter.\n\nBeautiful Black 9yr old 17h Shire/Warmblood Mare. Dixie came to us from a friend in CA in Oct. 2022. We are excited to start training with her. She loves to canter! Our hopes for Dixie are that she becomes a squad horse for the future. Welcome to the family Dixie."
