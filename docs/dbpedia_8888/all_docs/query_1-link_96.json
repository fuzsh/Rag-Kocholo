        "text": "The Athletic’s first NHL Power Rankings for the 2023-24 season are now live.\n\nCan the Golden Knights repeat as Stanley Cup champions? Or will the Avalanche be back on top in the West? Will the Hurricanes finally ascend in the East?\n\nAfter kicking off The Athletic NHL staff’s season predictions Monday with individual awards, today we look at team expectations. Who makes the playoffs? Who are the potential dark horses? Which fan base is bound for disappointment?\n\nTo pick apart the results of our polling, provide context and give us a healthy critique, we again have senior national writer Sean Gentille, national writer Hailey Salvian, analytics guru Shayna Goldman and NHL betting expert Jesse Granger.\n\nRead more: NHL coaching hot seat: Why should (or shouldn’t) these 9 coaches be worried?\n\nWho will win the Stanley Cup?\n\nGentille: Not remotely surprised by this one. Nobody wants to pick the team with the highest projection. Nobody wants to predict a repeat champ. Everyone loves elite talent, and the Stars have it in spades. Makes perfect sense. Yes, I was part of the 33 percent, why do you ask?\n\nSalvian: I debated between Edmonton, Dallas and Carolina, so I’m not surprised they combined for over 80 percent of the vote. Dallas won out for me. They have an exciting top-nine and a star in net. The only concern is that the Stars didn’t beef up the blue line, but if Thomas Harley can progress, maybe it’ll be a nonissue. Also — and I’m not mad about it — who voted for the Kings?\n\nGranger: Hailey nailed it with “star in net.” Dallas is my pick as well, and Jake Oettinger is the difference. The rest of these contenders have somewhere between solid and questionable goaltending, but only one has a bona fide star. It’s hard not to pick a team as talented as the Stars, especially when most of their core is still young and only getting better.\n\nGoldman: The Oilers’ back end/goaltending probably held some back from picking them despite the projection to finish ahead of Dallas. I think the Stars (before their implosion against Vegas) really showed how complete they are last postseason, so another year of growth from their kids and a few more depth additions just kicked them up in all of our opinions.\n\nWho will be the runners-up?\n\nGentille: There are reasons to believe the Hurricanes can get closer than they have in the past. There are also reasons to wonder, just a little bit, whether they’re built to go all the way.\n\nSalvian: Carolina ranked first in this year’s season previews. We know they’re an excellent team with a mix of skill and defensive structure that make them tough to beat. It’s not unreasonable to think this could be the year.\n\nGranger: The recipe for winning a Cup lately has been giving yourself as many competitive shots as possible and hoping things finally fall your way. They finally did for Tampa Bay after years of contending, then for Colorado, and last season for Vegas. Carolina certainly fits that formula … but so does Toronto.\n\nWho will finish in last place?\n\nGentille: Easiest pick on the board.\n\nSalvian: Not a single vote for Chicago or Arizona is interesting.\n\nGoldman: It feels like this could be a spot for San Jose to fall in for some time — with Anaheim and Montreal, everyone can see the start of the vision. That’s true for the Flyers, as well. But the Sharks…\n\nGranger: Take one of the worst teams in the league, then subtract Erik Karlsson and Timo Meier, and you get 84.8 percent of the vote as the worst of the worst.\n\nWho will be the biggest disappointment?\n\nMust be projected at 100-plus points by Dom’s model.\n\nGentille: Second-easiest pick on the board. I don’t think the Bruins are going to fall apart — their team defense is still too strong and Jim Montgomery is too good a coach for that — but 103 points is high.\n\nSalvian: I still picked Boston to make the playoffs this season. There’s enough left on that roster to get there, but the Bruins are projected to be one of the 10 best teams in the league, and that might be a tad unreasonable.\n\nGoldman: The thing that hurts the Bruins is that they set the bar for themselves so unrealistically high last season, anything less probably looks like a disappointment. Getting in comfortably as the seventh or eighth seed would be great, but it’ll be seen as a big dropoff.\n\nGranger: I’d argue the Bruins also set the bar so low in the postseason, they might win a round or two in the playoffs and actually be viewed as a nice surprise.\n\nWho’s your dark horse Cup contender?\n\nMust be projected as a middle-of-the-pack team, between 85 and 100 points by Dom’s model.\n\nGentille: Like we said about the Stars, elite talent is tough to pick against.\n\nSalvian: My money is still on the Kraken. Can they upset the Avs in the playoffs again? I’m not too sure. But I still think they’re rated too low by Dom’s model.\n\nGranger: I’m so torn on Seattle. On the one hand, they took big strides last season, and Matty Beniers is only getting better. There’s so much to like about the way this team is built. On the other hand, can the Kraken really shoot 11.6 percent again? It feels like regression is coming.\n\nGoldman: This was probably the hardest one to pick. Pittsburgh now has Erik Karlsson, the Kraken have elite depth, the Sabres and Senators are trying to disrupt the division. I wonder if anyone who picked Tampa thinks they’re giving Boston vibes from last year, with the big early-season injury and aging core that’s starting to get questioned.\n\nWho’s your surprise playoff team?\n\nMust be projected below 85 points by Dom’s model\n\nGentille: I don’t like any of these teams to make the playoffs, but the Coyotes are sneaky-decent and should at least be fun.\n\nSalvian: I don’t think we’re seeing any of these surprises, but if the Blues get big seasons from Jordan Kyrou and Robert Thomas, their team defense is better and they get solid goaltending … then they have my vote.\n\nGoldman: Arizona would be chaos in the best way, but it feels like a playoff surprise has to come from the West. There are too many dark horses and contenders in the East.\n\nGranger: I actually like Columbus the most out of all of these teams. The Blue Jackets have firepower up front with Johnny Gaudreau and Patrik Laine, an improved defense with the return of Zach Werenski, and I expect a bounce-back year from Elvis Merzļikins in net. I’d like Columbus a lot more if the top of the Metropolitan Division wasn’t so stacked.\n\nWho will be the first coach fired?\n\nGentille: D.J. Smith is a repeat champ here. High expectations can be tough.\n\nSalvian: I have been a big Smith defender over the years. Still, the Senators cannot have another pitiful first 20 games.\n\nGoldman: Smith makes a ton of sense. With new leadership taking over in Ottawa, it wouldn’t be a shock to see changes if things go south early. But my money is on Craig Berube. I don’t think he has the creativity and innovation to take the Blues where they need to go — but who knows, maybe the power of new assistant coaches will help him like they did Lindy Ruff last season.\n\nEast playoff field\n\nWe asked each voter to pick the eight East playoff teams. Here is the percentage of the votes received by each team. (Note: * playoff team in 2022-23)\n\nGentille: I tried to get the Sabres in there, honest. Andrei Vasilevskiy’s injury got them a little closer, but I couldn’t pull the trigger.\n\nGoldman: I feel like it has to be the year for Ottawa or Buffalo to sneak in, but for some reason, I think the Islanders aren’t going to go away as easily as many seem to think — and it might be one of the Florida-based teams that’s on the outside looking in.\n\nGranger: With 11 of the 16 teams receiving at least 20 percent of the vote, this may be the most entertaining playoff race we’ve seen in the East in quite some time.\n\nWest playoff field\n\nWe asked each voter to pick the eight West playoff teams. Here is the percentage of the votes received by each team. (Note: * playoff team in 2022-23)\n\nGentille: I’m fine with Flames being here, but that percentage is a little high for me. The West wild-card race might not be great, but it should be entertaining.\n\nGoldman: I’m actually shocked at how low Nashville is. I also think they’ll fall just shy of the playoffs, but if Juuse Saros has one ounce of consistent offense in front of him (which I think will be the case), the Predators could be right there. They somehow were last year with less!\n\nGranger: I’m with Shayna. Nashville being below Arizona is pretty wild. As for the rest of the conference, the West feels more top-heavy than the East this year. It would be a major shock if those top six teams don’t make it."
