        "text": "1.2. Licensed Products. he Products that Company licenses to Service Provider under Section 1.1 include only those Products and Services identified in Schedule A that are specified in any Order. The terms of Schedule A apply to Service Provider only to the extent that those terms relate to a Product purchased under an Order. The terms of Schedule A that relate to other Products do not apply. The Parties may amend Schedule A from time to time by a written document executed by both Parties if Service Provider wants to license from Company a product available for sale through the Platform that is not then subject to an existing order and not already included in Schedule A as the Parties may have amended it (a \"New Product\"). Distributor or Company may give Service Provider notice of the availability of a New Product. Upon Distributor’s or Service Provider’s request, Company will give to Service Provider a copy of the updates to Schedule A containing the terms under which Company proposes to authorize Service Provider to resell the New Product (the \"Updates\"). Such notice may contain the form of an amendment to these Terms under which Service Provider consents to the Updates. Service Provider hereby accepts and agrees to be bound by the Updates upon the earlier of: (a) the written execution and delivery of the Updates to Company, (b) a click-through acceptance of the Updates using the Platform, or (c) the date of Service Provider’s first use or resale of the New Product. From and after the first to occur of the event that any of clauses (a) through (c) in the preceding sentence describe, the term \"Products\" will be deemed to have been amended to include the New Product.\n\n1.7. Licensing Policy. The licenses granted in and under these Terms are subject to the terms of Company’s Licensing Policy, except those provisions of that policy relating to Maximum Allotment, as Company’s licensing policy may be updated from time to time. Company’s Licensing Policy can be found at https://www.acronis.com/company/licensing/. Service Provider will create one account per End User that will be on either a per GB or Per Workload licensing model that will apply to all of that End User’s workloads. End Users are only allowed to have one account. Attempts to combine different licensing models are not allowed and Acronis shall have the absolute and unilateral right in its sole discretion to suspend or terminate use of and access to all or any portion of the Software if Acronis deems or reasonably suspects a violation of its Licensing Policy.\n\n2.1. No Reverse Engineering. Service Provider will not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, adapt, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, techniques, processes, algorithms, know-how, or other information from any portion of any Product (collectively, \"Reverse Engineering\"), or permit or induce the foregoing by others, in whole or in part. If, however, directly applicable law prohibits enforcement of the foregoing, Service Provider may engage, and may permit its Resellers or End Users to engage, in Reverse Engineering solely for purposes of obtaining such information as is necessary to achieve interoperability of independently created software with the Products, or as otherwise and to the limited extent permitted by directly applicable law, but only if: (a) Reverse Engineering is strictly necessary to obtain such information; and (b) Service Provider has first requested such information from Company and Company has failed to make such information available (for a fee or otherwise) under reasonable terms and conditions. Any information supplied to Service Provider or that Service Provider obtains under this Section 2.1: is Company’s Confidential Information (as Section 9.2 defines that term); is subject to the obligations of Section 9; may only be used by Service Provider, and any applicable Reseller or End User, for the purpose described in this Section 2.1; and will not otherwise be disclosed to any third party or used to create any software which is substantially similar to the expression of any of the Products. With respect to the Products and Confidential Information of Company, Service Provider will not circumvent any software copyright management or security features, fail to display any copyright or other proprietary notices, or develop software or services that compete with Company using information obtained through Reverse Engineering and will not permit others to do so.\n\n3.3. Rights in Marks. Company and its suppliers or licensors reserve all rights to their respective trademarks in all countries, including to those countries within the Territory. Service Provider will not have or obtain any right, title or interest in and to the Marks, which will remain the sole and exclusive property of Company, its affiliates or licensors. Service Provider will not take any action that would in any way infringe or interfere with Company’s rights in the Marks. Service Provider will not at any time adopt or register any name, internet domain, designation, or trademark that is the same as or confusingly or deceptively similar to any Mark, and Service Provider hereby assigns to Company any of the foregoing if, in Company’s reasonable determination, it is the same as or is confusingly or deceptively similar to any Mark. Service Provider agrees not to contest Company’s rights to or ownership of the Marks anywhere in the world.\n\n3.4. Mark Assignment. Should any right, title or interest to any Mark or any goodwill arising out of Service Provider’s use of any Mark become vested in Service Provider by operation of law or otherwise, Service Provider will hold the same in trust for Company and will immediately and unconditionally assign (with full title guaranty) free of charge any such right, title, interest or goodwill to Company and agrees to unconditionally execute any documents and do all acts that Company requires for the purpose of properly assigning the same. If Service Provider fails to execute and deliver any such documents or do any such act within five (5) days of Company’s written request, Service Provider irrevocably hereby appoints and authorizes Company to execute the same on its behalf as its authorized agent and attorney will full power to act in its stead.\n\n6.2. Tax. All amounts that may be payable to the Company under these Terms are before sales, value-added, and all other applicable taxes and duties. The Service Provider is responsible for all applicable taxes and duties. If the Company is charging the Service Provider any fees under these Terms, the Company will charge the Service Provider sales taxes unless the Service Provider has provided a valid sales tax exemption or resale certificate to the Company. The Service Provider will pay, and will indemnify and hold the Company harmless from payment of, all taxes (other than taxes based on the Company’s income and personal property), fees, duties, other governmental charges, and any related penalties and interest arising from inaccurate tax documentation provided by the Service Provider to the Company under these Terms. If the Service Provider is required to withhold taxes from the amounts payable to the Company hereunder, the Service Provider will request documentation from the Company that may reduce or eliminate such withholding and, to the extent withholding is required, will provide the Company with official tax receipts issued by the local tax authority as proof that such taxes have been paid.\n\n7.1. Reporting. The Platform will automatically generate reports of Service Provider’s use of the Products and Services and send them to Distributor on a monthly basis (the \"Monthly Platform Report\"). Except as specified in this Section 7.1, within five business (5) days from the end of each month Service Provider must provide to Distributor a full and accurate report of how many instances of the Products Service Provider has used, sold, and/or installed during that month (\"Monthly Usage Report\"). Service Provider does not have to include in the Monthly Usage Report any information regarding its use of the Products contained in the Monthly Platform Report. In addition to the Monthly Usage Report, Service Provider will provide to Distributor any other information that Distributor may reasonably request from time to time for the purpose of calculating the amounts that Service Provider owes to Distributor for use of the Products and Services.\n\n7.2. Books and Records. Service Provider will keep complete, accurate, and current books and records relating to the supply and distribution of the Products and Services. While the Term remains in effect and for three (3) years thereafter Company or its authorized representatives may audit Service Provider’s use of the Products and Services to confirm compliance with these Terms. That audit is subject to at least fourteen (14) calendar days' prior written notice by Company and will not unreasonably interfere with Service Provider’s business activities. Company may conduct no more than one (1) audit in any twelve (12) month period, and only during normal business hours. Service Provider will reasonably cooperate with Company and any third-party auditor and will, without prejudice to Company’s other rights, address any non-compliance identified by the audit by promptly paying the related additional fees. Service Provider will promptly reimburse Company for all reasonable costs of the audit if the audit reveals either underpayment of more than five (5%) percent of the Product and Service fees properly due from Service Provider to Company for the period audited, or that Service Provider has materially failed to maintain accurate records of its use of the Products and Services.\n\n9.1. User Data. Company hereby acknowledges that it acquires no ownership right, title, or interest to any data that Service Provider, any of its Resellers, or any of their End Users processes, stores, or transmits using the Products or Services (\"User Data\"). Subject to Company’s normal access and security procedures and privacy policy (found at https://www.acronis.com/company/privacy/), Service Provider hereby grants Company a non-exclusive, transferable license to use the User Data that belongs to Service Provider as necessary to provide Service Provider with the Products and Services. Service Provider agrees that it will ensure that any Reseller or End User in Service Provider’s network also grants Company a non-exclusive, transferable license to use such party’s User Data as necessary to provide such party with the Products and Services as a condition of such party’s use thereof. Any Company employee or subcontractor that accesses User Data pursuant to this Section 9.1 will be bound by confidentiality restrictions at least as restrictive as those in these Terms. Without the owner’s consent (which it may withhold in its sole discretion), the User Data may not be: (a) used by Company other than as permitted under these Terms; or (b) individualized, sold, assigned, or leased by Company. Company will have the right to monitor and analyze Service Provider’s use of the Products and Services and to use the results of such monitoring to improve the Products and Services during and after the Term. Service Provider represents and warrants that: (i) it has obtained, and will obtain, all consents and approvals necessary to provide the User Data to Company, and for Company to use the User Data in accordance with these Terms; and (ii) it has all rights necessary to grant the license in this Section 9.1.\n\n9.2. Confidential Information. \"Confidential Information\" means User Data (defined in Section 9.1), the Products and Services, these Terms, and valuable, proprietary and confidential information with respect to a Party’s business, including, information that may relate to the Party’s financial information, condition, or affairs, financial projections, financial analysis, corporate organizational documents, business plans, forecasts, products, whether in distribution or under development, trade secrets, computer source code and object code, software and other product designs and specifications, methodologies, data, developments, ideas, improvements, product and marketing plans, customer and vendor lists, and other oral, visual, or written information that the Party designates as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure or that, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, or by the nature of the information, would reasonably be understood by the other Party to be confidential or proprietary, including any of the foregoing that is Confidential Information of a Party’s customers, vendors, partners, licensors or other third parties with respect to which that Party has an obligation of confidentiality.

The term \"Confidential Information\" does not include information of one Party that (a) is disclosed in a printed or web publication available to the public, is otherwise in the public domain at the time of disclosure, or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act or omission on the part of the other Party, or (b) is obtained by the other Party lawfully from a third party who is not under an obligation of secrecy to the first party and is not under any similar restrictions as to use. If a Party is required to disclose any of the other Party’s Confidential Information by a judicial or governmental order, the Party will give the other Party reasonable advance notice of the disclosure and the opportunity for the other Party to contest, at its own expense, the disclosure of the Confidential Information, where such notice is not prohibited by law or government order.\n\n9.3. Confidentiality Obligations. Service Provider will not disclose or provide access to the Products and Services or any part thereof to anyone for any purpose except as contemplated by these Terms. Each Party agrees that it will maintain other’s Confidential Information in confidence, prevent its disclosure, and protect it from unauthorized use with at least the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own most critical proprietary information, but in no event less than a reasonable amount of care. Each will prevent copying or use by its employees and others except for the purpose of exercising the rights expressly granted under these Terms. Each will immediately notify the other Party if it becomes aware of such unauthorized copying or use. Service Provider will ensure that anyone to whom it make disclosures about, or provides access to the Products and Services are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective of Company as are in these Terms.\n\n9.7. Return of Data. Upon request by Service Provider, Company will (a) return to Service Provider, for free over the network, or for a fee in accordance with Company’s then-current pricing if Service Provider requests special handling or use of any media, provided that the Company may reasonably refuse any request for special handling or use of specific media, all the User Data (or such portion of the User Data as requested by Service Provider) stored in a Company data center, and (b) erase all or any part of the User Data stored in a Company data center, in each case to the extent so requested by Service Provider. Company will certify to Service Provider that all such copies have been erased. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company may use any archival media containing the User Data only for back-up purposes and will maintain such back-up copies of the User Data as Confidential Information of Service Provider.\n\n10.1.

The Products and Services are licensed and not sold under these Terms, notwithstanding any references herein to \"sale\" or \"sold.\" The Products and Services are and will remain the sole and exclusive property of Company or its suppliers or licensors, as applicable, whether the Product or Services are separate or combined with any other products. Company’s or its suppliers’ or licensors’ rights, as applicable, under this subsection will include, but are not be limited to: (i) all copies of the Products, in whole or in part; (ii) all intellectual property rights in the Products and Services; and (iii) all modifications to, and derivative works based upon, the Products.

The prior sentence will apply only to the extent that: (i) Company has notified Service Provider in writing after receiving written notice of such third party claim and cooperates reasonably with Service Provider to resolve the claim. Company’s failure to notify Service Provider of the third-party claim will, only if it prejudices the defense of the claim, reduce Service Provider’s liability under this Section 2.2. only in proportion to the prejudice. Company will give sole control of the defense of the claim to Service Provider, subject to the following: (i) Company may appoint its own non-controlling counsel, at its own expense; and (ii) any settlement requiring Company to admit liability, pay money, or take (or refrain from taking) any action, will require Company’s prior written consent, which may be withheld in Company’s sole and absolute discretion.

In addition to other prohibitions and restrictions set forth in these Terms, the Service Provider will not use the Products or Services (a) in connection with the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, life support systems or other high risk activities where the use or failure of the Products or Services could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage; (b) to violate the rights of others; (c) to try to gain unauthorized access to or disrupt any service, device, data, account or network; (d) to spam or otherwise distribute malware; (e) in a way that could harm Azure data center(s) or impair anyone else’s use of the Products or Services; (f) to operate or enable any telecommunications service or in connection with any application that allows End Users to place calls to or receive calls from any public switched telephone network; (g) process or store any User Data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the US Department of State; or (h) any combination of the foregoing (the foregoing is collectively referred to as the \"Microsoft AUP\").\n\n3.1. Material Breaches. Notwithstanding Section 13.1 of the Terms to the contrary, where Service Provider breaches any material term or condition of the Terms after having previously cured one or more breaches of a material term or condition, and if Company reasonably believes that such breach may cause Microsoft to terminate its data center agreement with Company or to suspend or terminate any, all, or any part of its services, Company may (i) require Service Provider, at Service Provider’s cost, to transition to another secure third Company data center, (ii) terminate the Terms without liability to Service Provider; (iii) suspend or terminate any service the Company’s access to or use of which Microsoft has suspended or terminated, or (iv) any combination of the foregoing.\n\n3.2. Indemnification. Service Provider will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Company against all costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees), damages and liabilities resulting from any third party claim arising from or in connection with i) Service Provider’s, any Reseller’s, or any End User’s use of the Services or Products in violation of the Microsoft AUP; ii) any allegation that User Data stored or processed by Microsoft Azure misappropriates a trade secret or infringes a patent, copyright, trademark or other proprietary right of a third party; or iii) any combination of the foregoing. The prior sentence will apply only to the extent that: (i) Company has notified Service Provider in writing after receiving written notice of such third party claim and cooperates reasonably with Service Provider to resolve the claim. Company’s failure to notify Service Provider of the third-party claim will, only if it prejudices the defense of the claim, reduce Service Provider’s liability under this Section 3.2 only in proportion to the prejudice. Company will give sole control of the defense of the claim to Service Provider, subject to the following: (i) Company may appoint its own non-controlling counsel, at its own expense; and (ii) any settlement requiring Company to admit liability, pay money, or take (or refrain from taking) any action, will require Company’s prior written consent, which may be withheld in Company’s sole and absolute discretion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the limitations of liability under the Terms do not apply to Service Provider’s indemnification obligations under this Section 3.2.\n\n2.3. Limitation of Liability under the Google Terms. In addition to and not in derogation of Section 12.2 of the Terms, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Service Provider, on its own behalf, as well as on behalf of its Resellers and End Users, acknowledges and agrees that: (A) the total cumulative liability of the Company to Service Provider, its Resellers, and End Users for any claim under these Terms pertaining to Google Workspace Backup, including for any implied warranties, whether in contract, in tort (including negligence or strict liability), or any other legal theory, will not exceed the amount of license fees that Service Provider has paid to Distributor in the six (6) month period preceding the event giving rise to the liability, and (B) the Company will not be liable for any expense, loss, or damage pertaining to Google Workspace Backup that is not reasonably foreseeable. The existence of multiple claims by any one party or from multiple parties with respect to the same underlying acts, omissions or occurrences will not expand this limit."
