        "text": "SCHAFFHAUSEN, Switzerland, July 12, 2021 - This year's Acronis IT Skills-Programme will take place from July 12 - August 3 and will cover basic IT, cybersecurity, CV creation tips, the use of social media platforms for education and work, and even financial planning and the basics of investing.\n\nParticipants of the 2021 courses' consist of 28 students who originate from a variety of countries, including Eritrea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Tibet. They all have different personal and professional backgrounds, but they're united by the same goal: to develop new professional and personal skills in order to find an internship, trainship or job to better integrate into the Swiss society.\n\nThis year, it's not only Acronis employees who will be volunteering - they'll be joined by volunteers from the Schaffhausen Institute of Technology (SIT) and Plesk to support the Schaffhausen immigrant community.\n\nOne of this year's volunteer is Sabine Schulz from the Acronis Munich office. \"Equitable access to education is essential to closing achievement and opportunity gaps\", says Schulz. \"Especially interpersonal and emotional-based skills - like empathy- as well as communication are important to succeed in todayÂ´s job market\" added another volunteer Sevilay Uecdere.\n\nOn August 3, 27 people with migration background will complete the 3-week studies and graduate from the IT Skills Programme organized by Acronis, and the Schaffhausen Institute of Technology (SIT).\n\nIf you'd like to support the IT Skills Programme as an individual or a company, learn how to do so on our website - or contact us at foundation@acronis.org."
