        "text": "February 14, 2006, Burlington, MA - Acronis, Inc. (www.acronis.com), the technological leader in storage management software, announced that the company has relocated its corporate headquarters from South San Francisco, CA, to Burlington, MA. The new office houses not only the company's corporate management team, but also sales and support personnel.\n\n\"Acronis has been experiencing tremendous growth over the past several years,\" said Walter Scott, CEO. \"We've grown from fewer than 50 employees three years ago to more than 250 today worldwide.\"\n\n\"Having our corporate offices on the East Coast puts us closer to the heart of corporate America and international business centers,\" Scott continued. \"Our West Coast office serves us well as a sales and support center, but was too small to serve the needs of our expanding operations.\"\n\n\"Managed growth is critical for any corporation, and growing in your customers' back yard simply makes good business sense\" added Stephen Lawton, marketing director of Acronis. \"Last year Acronis opened a sales and support office in Herndon, VA. Adding additional sales and corporate support personnel will improve our response time to our enterprise customers.\"\n\nAcronis' new headquarters office is located at 52 3rd Avenue, Burlington, MA 01801. The toll-free phone number for corporate sales remains the same: +1 877-485-3240. The new phone number for the corporate headquarters is [781] 222-0920. Questions about customer support should continue to be sent to support center."
