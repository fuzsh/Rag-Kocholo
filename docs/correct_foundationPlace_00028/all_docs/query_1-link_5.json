        "text": "The Primary School in Cambodia, Southeast Asia, is located in Prei Changha Village, a rural and poverty-stricken area in the north of the country on the border with Thailand, which has a population of 3,255 residents.\n\nInequality and corruption is widespread in Cambodia and the rural communities remain highly disadvantaged.\n\nFacts\n\nName: Prei Changha\n\nType of facility: school building\n\nNumber of students: 453 (239 boys, 214 girls)\n\nNumber of teachers: 10 (3 men, 7 women)\n\nNumber of facilities built by us: 1 building with 5 furnished classrooms, 5 toilets\n\nSize: 360m²\n\nBudget: USD 60,968\n\nConstruction period: March – October 2018\n\nLocation: Prei Changha Village, Mongkol Borey District, Banteay Meanchey Province, Cambodia\n\nEducational situation\n\nOffering education from kindergarten to primary 1 through 6, the school is also attended by children from three other surrounding villages. Three of five classrooms are wooden buildings with tiled roof and must be reconstructed, as they have deteriorated by the time and are possibly collapsing, which presents a serious risk to the children’s security.\n\nProject implementation\n\nTo offer the 453 children aged 5 to 12 a safe learning environment and deal with the increasing number of enrolments, Acronis Foundation will support the construction of a school building with a size of 360 square metres, in collaboration with the Swiss non-profit organization Child’s Dream. There will be 5 completely furnished classrooms, 5 toilets included. The construction period will start in March 2018 and will be completed by the end of October.\n\nOne important aspect is that the local community will participate in the construction process to create a feeling of solidarity and to ensure that the project is fully supported by the villagers. This is the reason why they will also help to organize the opening celebration. After the construction process, the educational staff as well as the community will oversee the maintenance of the school. The construction of the new school building will give the local children the possibility to get access to quality education, so that they can continue to achieve their life goals."
