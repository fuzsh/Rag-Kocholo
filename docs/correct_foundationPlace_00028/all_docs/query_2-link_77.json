        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (May 10): Acronis, which provides one-stop cyber security and managed cloud solutions, has set up its maiden data centre here to meet the need for a local presence amid rising demand and an impressive growth in its operations.\n\nThe Cyber Cloud data centre — to be Acronis’ 52nd worldwide — is set up under co-location with a local partner in an existing data centre facility.\n\nAcronis saw 178% year-on-year growth in the revenue of its Malaysian operations in 2022, with 150 service providers selling Acronis solutions in the country. Prior to this, these partners relied on Acronis’ data centre located in Singapore.\n\n“The reason for this investment is first, the reflection of existing growth,” said Acronis senior vice-president for Asia-Pacific, Japan, Middle East and Africa sales and global channel Pasha Ershow at a media briefing.\n\n“We expect our partner network in Malaysia to double in the near future.\n\n“The fact we have a data centre here will allow our partners to serve sensitive industries as well, as the data will not leave Malaysian borders. This is a good differentiator and a good foundation for expansion for us,” Ershow said, adding Arconis is also mulling setting up a Malaysian office moving forward.\n\nAmid the jump in demand for cloud-based solutions since the pandemic and subsequent incidents of cyber attacks, countries are increasingly taking care of data linked to their population, businesses and governments, offsetting a trend for utilisation of data centres located far away.\n\nAcronis said Malaysia experienced a RM600 million loss from over 20,000 cyberattack cases last year alone.\n\n“We live in times when the market is moving forward rapidly to cloud solutions and the cyber threat landscape is constantly evolving,” said Exabytes group CEO and founder Chan Kee Siak in a separate statement. Exabytes is one of Acronis' local partners in Malaysia.\n\n“Acronis partners and customers in Malaysia can look forward to locally-hosted cyber protection solutions in compliance with Malaysian data protection legislation while also benefiting from the full range of managed cloud solutions and cyber protection solutions available via the Acronis Cyber Cloud platform,” said Chan.\n\nAside from Malaysia and Singapore, Acronis’ data centres in Asia are also located in Japan, Buthan, South Korea,India, Taiwan, and Indonesia."
