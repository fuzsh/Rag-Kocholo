        "text": "Cybersecurity\n\nStay ahead of modern cyberthreats with award-winning anti-ransomware enhanced with anti-malware capabilities that complement your clients’ antivirus. Prevent data leaks via local channels.\n\nBackup and recovery\n\nMinimize data loss across your clients’ infrastructure and workloads with the best backup and recovery technology, available in consumption-based or per-workload licensing models.\n\nManagement\n\nCentralize your protection management and provision endpoints in minutes. Remotely assist clients and assess system vulnerabilities and security gaps. Increase visibility with built-in monitoring and reporting.\n\nProtection for remote workers\n\nMinimize the rising risk of cyberattacks for remote workers with multiple protection capabilities – including prioritized patching and protection for mission-critical telecommute apps (Zoom, WebEx, MS Teams, Slack, Skype, TeamViewer), remote device wipe, and secure desktop remote connectivity.\n\nMultiple backup types\n\nBack up disks/volumes (with all information required for the operating system to boot), individual files or folders, system states (for Microsoft Windows systems), or ESXi configurations.\n\nFlexible backup storage options\n\nComply with the requirements of different clients with flexible storage options. Back up to Acronis-hosted cloud storage, public clouds such as Google Cloud Storage or Microsoft Azure, your own cloud storage, or local networked storage.\n\nDevice and port control\n\nStrengthen data security and prevent leakage of sensitive information via local channels with granular, context-aware controls over user access to locally connected devices and ports, and data operations related to them – even for virtulized sessions.\n\nClipboard control\n\nPrevent data leakage in its earliest stage by controlling data transfers between application and documents. Allow or block user access to objects of different data types copied to the clipboard, even for redirected BYOD devices in virtualized sessions.\n\nDevice control: support of encrypted removable media and screenshot capture access\n\nEliminate the risk of data leaks with encrypted removable media and screenshot capture control. This enables users to keep sensitive information within their organization – should a removable device get in the wrong hands or prevent screenshots from being copied to the clipboard. Keeping your clients’ sensitive data safe and secure.\n\nAcronis Instant Restore\n\nCut RTOs to as little as 15 seconds with a built-in capability to restore a system by booting it as a virtual machine directly from the backup, without moving any data.\n\nAcronis Universal Restore\n\nReduce the time spent on recovery tasks. Acronis Universal Restore makes recovery to dissimilar hardware faster by detecting the machine type and auto-installing appropriate drivers for the hardware.\n\nGoogle Workspace data protection\n\nSafeguard client data stored in Gmail, Drive (including Team Drives), Contacts, and Calendar by backing it up to ensure fast, reliable recovery.\n\nComplete Microsoft 365 protection\n\nProtect data in Microsoft Exchange Online, OneDrive for Business, Microsoft Teams and SharePoint Online with comprehensive cloud-to-cloud backup and restore.\n\nBackup encryption\n\nMaintain regulatory compliance and strengthen data protection by securing your backups with AES-256 data encryption for data in transit and at rest, so only you can access the data.\n\nReport scheduling\n\nIncrease visibility into information security and simplify IT security auditing with capabilities for sending scheduled reports to listed recipients in a desired format and language.\n\nDeduplication\n\nMinimize storage requirements by detecting data repetition in backups and not storing identical data more than once. Deduplication also reduces network load as duplicate data is not even transferred over the network to the backup storage.\n\nAuto discovery and remote installation\n\nSimplify the onboarding process by installing multiple agents at once – in the cloud and on-premises. With network-based and Active Directory-based discovery, your technicians can easily install and apply protection plans remotely – helping to keep your clients safe.\n\nPredefined protection plans\n\nProtect your clients’ remote and office workers quickly and easily by choosing one of three preconfigured protection plans. These options save you time while ensuring you that your clients’ workloads and environments are protected.\n\nRemote desktop assistance\n\nEnable secure, off-site access to machines to ease remote work for users or provide technical assistance to clients with built-in remote desktop capabilities.\n\nHardware inventory collection\n\nSave time and effort with an up-to-date hardware inventory. Discover all hardware assets with automatic and on-demand scans. Create hardware inventory reports, browse and filter records by multiple criteria and auto-delete them once a machine or tenant is removed.\n\nElectronic signing\n\nStrengthen process compliance by allowing clients and their third parties to e-sign documents with publicly verifiable proof of the timestamp and authenticity of the signature. Based on pay-as-you-go pricing.\n\nTest failover in isolated network environments\n\nVerify the integrity and efficiency of disaster recovery plans by executing them via the web console in an isolated network environment, without disrupting other processes.\n\nPoint-to-site VPN connection\n\nEnable clients to quickly and easily access files from the local site or the cloud. With the Business VPN feature, clients on DR-enabled tenants can establish a secure connection to the corporate network with their personal devices so they can access the data they need.\n\nFirewall policies management\n\nEasily manage firewall policies on your clients’ behalf for their disaster recovery servers through the Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud console. This enables you to simplify the support process and manage outbound and inbound firewall policies.\n\nStraightforward pay-as-you-go pricing\n\nMeet the dynamic needs of your clients with a 100% pay-per-use licensing model and free functionalities. Per-GB and per-seat/per-device licensing types are available.\n\nIntegration with PSA and RMM systems\n\nDeliver services instantly using native integrations with ConnectWise (Automate, Manage, Control), Atera, Autotask, Kaseya, cPanel, HostBill, CloudBlue, Plesk, and WHMCS.\n\nIntegration with custom systems\n\nAssimilate systems by leveraging a powerful RESTful management API or enable integration via the Acronis Cyber Backup Cloud Application Packaging Standard (APS).\n\nRansomware-proof backups\n\nEnsure backups cannot be encrypted or deleted by a ransomware attack or malicious users through immutable storage, enabling you to recover quickly to the most recent clean state."
