        "text": "U.S. Air Force deploying Acronis Access Advanced to Provide Secure Mobile Access for Employees\n\nBurlington, MA -August 24, 2015 - AcronisÂ®, a global leader in cloud data protection, today announced that the U.S. Air Force has given Acronis Access Advanced the Authority to Operate (ATO) on its networks. Acronis is the first Secure Mobile Content Management provider to obtain an ATO by the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nMobility is changing the way the private and public sector work together. Tablets, smartphones, and other mobile devices are the norm for government employees, agencies, and contractors - all of whom are increasingly working remotely with the need to securely access and share critical documents and information. Military organizations also need to control who has access to sensitive information and have the audit trails necessary to comply with standards and regulations.\n\nTo face these new challenges of secure mobile access of information, the U.S. Air Force was looking for a solution that allows the synchronization and use of a large number of manuals and other documents when employees are offline from a secured IT network, including encryption features meeting FIPS 140-2 requirements, tight integration with the MDM solution and Active Directory. This also includes the ability to work on documents in real-time to manage changes and versions with Microsoft Office editing and PDF annotation capabilities.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force selected and certified Acronis Access Advanced with the ATO for the solution's advanced secure access capabilities, as well as its real-time access, editing, synchronization and sharing capabilities. This ensures that critical information is protected and under the strict control of U.S Air Force IT administrators and information assurance specialists, while offering an easy and user-friendly product to end users.\n\n\"Being certified on U.S. Air Force networks further establishes Acronis' proven and validated highly secure access model for file sync and share,\" said Derick Naef, Vice President and General Manager of Acronis Mobility Solutions. \"Now that Acronis Access Advanced has received the Authority To Operate from the U.S Department of Defense, the U.S. Air Force or other military organizations can immediately take advantage of our secure mobile content management, while empowering both government employees and external contractors to collaborate on documents and work from anywhere, over any device.\""
