        "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. & WOBURN, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vertical Communications, Inc., a provider of next-generation IP telephony systems and integrated B2B unified communications (UC) solutions and Acronis, a leading provider of easy-to-use disaster recovery and data protection solutions for physical, virtual and cloud environments, today announced a technology partnership to deliver an easy-to-use business continuity solution that protects the Vertical Wave IP® business communications system. When disaster strikes, Wave Live Image powered by Acronis®, will cost-effectively enable Wave users to quickly restore their system, allowing communications to be up and running again, reducing disruptions to service.\n\nWave Live Image is an easy-to-use utility that schedules regular snapshots of a Wave IP system, providing administrators with a fast, effective restoration process. Live Image snapshots are automatically compressed to minimize storage requirements and can be stored on a secondary drive on the Wave IP, on a network file server, or at an offsite location for ultimate peace of mind.\n\n“With so many growing companies now reliant on the competitive advantage unified communications gives them in running their business, being able to quickly restore their Wave IP communications system provides Vertical customers with the peace of mind that they can be back up and running in a matter of minutes,” said Peter Bailey, president and chief executive officer of Vertical Communications. “It’s easy to see how having restore capabilities for IP communications platforms is becoming a necessity where communications are considered the lifeblood of company operations.”\n\nKey Wave Live Image Highlights:\n\n“It’s exciting to partner with such an innovative unified communications solutions partner to extend our award winning backup and recovery solutions to protect a vital, but largely ignored piece of critical business infrastructure,” said Izzy Azeri, vice president and general manager of Acronis Americas. “Being chosen by Vertical to protect its customers’ critical services is testament to the reliable and robust nature of the Acronis Backup & Recovery® product.”\n\nWave IP Business Communications System\n\nThe family of Wave IP business communications systems offers customers a fully integrated, unified, flexible communications solution with features such as contact center, call recording, reporting, networking, management, custom call routing applications and IVR – all within a single system. Cost-sensitive mid-sized businesses and larger distributed organizations seeking to reduce overhead associated with managing business communications can transform their legacy telephony infrastructure into an application-rich, next generation VoIP solution by deploying Wave IP. Wave IP’s unique Application-Ready architecture means Vertical’s unified communications capabilities and suite of voice applications are available ”on-box” so they can be easily deployed and managed without expensive add-on software.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nWave Live Image is now available as an integrated application that comes preinstalled in Vertical’s Wave IP, and is ready to activate with a software license. Contact a local Vertical Reseller for pricing.\n\nAbout Acronis\n\nAcronis is a leading provider of easy-to-use disaster recovery and data protection solutions for physical, virtual and cloud environments.
