        "text": "High data availability\n\nEnsuring that your organization’s mission-critical data has one of the highest levels of availability, leveraging data centers that provide redundant HVAC, network and UPS systems. Acronis follows the approach of Need plus Two (N+2) for greater redundancy. If there is a failure in a hardware-layer component, it will not affect Acronis’ critical infrastructure or Acronis customers. Acronis stores customer data employing its own software-defined storage solution, Acronis Cyber Infrastructure with Acronis CloudRAID technology.\n\nGuarded physical locations\n\nData centers are physically defended 24/7 by security personnel, high fences, and video surveillance, while on-site entry requires biometric and key card access. Strict access control measures ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the data center.\n\nReliable facility management\n\nEquipped with UPS and backup diesel-generators, Acronis data centers can provide a continuous supply of electricity through undefined power outages of up to 48 hours. HVAC, fire detection and suppression systems, alarms, and monitoring by surveillance cameras (CCTV) allow Acronis to provide a reliable infrastructure."
