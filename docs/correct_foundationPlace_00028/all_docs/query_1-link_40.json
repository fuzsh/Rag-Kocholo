It was founded in 2003 by entrepreneurs born in the USSR and later adopted citizenship of other countries. Since 2008, the company is registered in Switzerland.\n\nBusiness in Russia\n\nMain article: Acronis in Russia\n\nAcronis: Partner Program\n\nHistory\n\n2023: 12GB of corporate IT data leaked\n\nOn March 9, 2023, it became known about the hacking of Acronis IT systems. The cybercriminal has made public more than 12 GB of all kinds of data, including certificate files and Python scripts.\n\nThe attack on the Broken Forums site was reported by a hacker hiding under the pseudonym Kernelware. According to him, although the $120 million company is engaged in data protection and information security, it itself had \"disgusting security,\" and the reason for the hack was that the attacker was bored, so he decided to \"humiliate\" Acronis. Files with a total volume of approximately 12.2 GB are posted in the public domain. They contain certificates, command logs, system configurations, system information logs, file system archives, Python scripts for the Acronis database, backup configuration, and a large amount of other information.\n\nAcronis Director of Information Security Kevin Reed confirmed the attack, but said that it affected only one client and that all other data remains secure. According to him, no product of the company was injured in the attack. However, Acronis experts continue to study the problem and possible consequences of cyber intrusion.\n\nOn March 9, Acronis was mentioned in a message on Broken Forums. We immediately launched an investigation and it confirmed that no Acronis products were affected. However, judging by the information we have, the credentials used by a specific client to upload diagnostic information to Acronis support have been compromised. We are working with this client and have suspended access to his account until the problem is fixed, \"Reed said.[1]\n\n2021\n\nAcronis co-founder Sergei Belousov changed his name to Serg Bell\n\nIn 2021, Sergei Belousov changed his name and surname to Serg Bell, the American newspaper The Washington Post reported in March 2022 in an article entitled \"From Russia with Money: Silicon Valley Distances from Oligarchs\"[2]. In April 2022, information about the name change was added to the page of the co-founder of Acronis in Wikipedia.\n\nPatrick Pulvermüller - the new CEO of the company\n\nOn July 7, 2021, Acronis announced the appointment of Patrick Pulvermüller as the new CEO. He officially took up new duties on July 1. Read more here.\n\nRaising $250 million of investments, an estimate of $2.5 billion\n\nOn May 4, 2021, Acronis announced that it had raised over $250 million in investments as part of a round led by CVC Capital. As a result of the deal, the manufacturer of backup and recovery solutions was valued at more than $2.5 billion.\n\nAcronis intends to use the funds received to expand its product portfolio and support a network of partners promoting the company's solutions, the company said. It is also planned to expand the staff of engineers in Bulgaria, Israel, Singapore, Romania and the United States.\n\nAs one of the founders and head of Acronis Sergey Belousov told RBC, new investors received \"a little more than 10%\" in the company, another 6.5% among investors of the previous round, and the founders retain more than 50% of the shares. In addition to CVC Capital Partners, \"other technology investors\" participated in the round, but Belousov chose not to disclose their names.\n\nIn a conversation with Reuters, the businessman noted that the new investment was one of the steps towards providing liquidity to the company's shareholders through IPOs, mergers and acquisitions or dividend payments. By May 4, 2021, Acronis does not plan to go public due to an unpredictable market situation, but admits the possibility of listing in the future. Belousov considers exchanges in New York, Switzerland and Singapore to be preferred sites for the initial public offering of securities.\n\nWe've always seen the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq as a major market. But there are other options. I am a Singapore citizen and we are a Swiss company. Therefore, naturally, we have Swiss banks that serve us as corporate clients, \"he said.\n\nAfter raising funds, Acronis, according to the entrepreneur, plans to actively hire engineers, invest in the development and support of the Acronis Cyber ​ ​ Protect product, as well as in marketing.[3]\n\nAcquisition of African partner Synapsys\n\nAcronis, a representative in the field of cyber defense, on March 16, 2021 informed TAdviser about the acquisition of Synapsys, its long-standing partner located in Cape Town, South Africa, which specializes in the supply of Acronis Cyber ​ ​ Protection Solutions through service providers.

These centers will enable the full range of Acronis cyber security solutions to be available to partners and organizations around the world, which is especially important when two-thirds of employees work remotely and rely on cloud services.\n\nAcronis also announced plans to create another 100 compact data centers that will be connected to a global network that already includes data centers in the USA, Great Britain, Switzerland, France, Germany, Japan, Australia and Singapore.\n\n{{quote 'The global distribution of peripheral systems means an increase in the amount of data that circulates outside corporate networks, - said Sergey Belousov, founder and CEO of Acronis. -Compact Data Center allows you to implement various peripheral solutions, especially in emerging markets. As part of Acronis' strategy to integrate global and on-premises services, this expansion enables us to deliver locally cost-effective, cost-effective, speed and low latency cloud services that our global partners need. This aligns with our commitment to offering the cloud services and cyber protection partners and users in the digital world need. }}\n\nAccording to Gartner forecasts, by 2022 the global cloud management and security services market will increase by more than 25%, and Technavio predicts that by 2024 the global peripheral data center market will grow by almost 14%, so the additional cloud data centers announced today will allow Acronis to strengthen its position in both directions.\n\nOver the past years, the dependence of organizations on cloud access to technological data and controls has increased, and the pandemic has only accelerated its spread around the world, says Phil Goodwin, director of R&D at IDC. - The development of a cloud data center network, especially in emerging markets, allows Acronis to find partners and customers who are in high demand for cloud platforms and data protection and security solutions.\n\nFurther expansion allows Acronis to increase the reach of cyber security solutions delivered through a platform Acronis Cyber Cloud that enables service providers to provide, backup disaster recovery, protection from, harmful ON secure collaboration, and data authentication service based blockchain on - all with a single console.\n\n{{quote 'Data plays a key role in the activities of any organization, which means that it is necessary - ITproviders such as us providing solutions, \"said Martin Broad, President and CEO of Robson Communications. - Acronis understands what providers need to build a portfolio of services and protect customers - and not only in terms of the solutions they offer, but also in terms of pricing and implementation. Expanding the Acronis data center network will help significantly more service providers around the world maintain productivity and protect their customers. }}\n\nAdditional data centers will provide service providers with access to the Acronis Cyber ​ ​ Protect Cloud solution. It integrates backup, disaster recovery, antivirus, cyber, and endpoint management tools.\n\nAppointment of Rene Bonvani as Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nOn March 11, 2020, Acronis announced the appointment of Rene Bonvani as chairman of the board of directors.

It is only known that new investors received less than 10% of the company's shares, and co-founders Sergei Belousov and Ilya Zubarev retained control and own more than 70% of the shares for two.\n\nAs a result of the financial deal, the manufacturer of systems for backup and recovery of data was estimated at more than $1 billion.\n\nAcronis is set to spend the investment raised to expand its development team, create additional data centers, grow its North American business and acquire companies in the market.\n\nAccording to Sergey Belousov, the investment round organized by Goldman Sachs will help the company accelerate product development through the acquisition of companies and the acquisition of additional resources, as well as make business growth even faster.\n\nHe noted that in 2019 Acronis expects to reach 30% business growth against 20% in 2018. The company does not disclose its financial performance, but claims it has been profitable since its inception.\n\nWe're investing in Acronis in an incredibly fast growth phase, \"says Goldman Sachs Private Capital Investing Group Vice President Holger Staud. - The results of the company's commercial activities indicate that it is an incredibly valuable new asset in our portfolio, and the growth of this company will exceed forecasts.\n\nBy September 2019, more than 5 million consumers and 500 thousand business representatives use Acronis software, including 80% of the largest Fortune 1000 companies.

Within the framework of the concept of \"Smart Island\" developed by the Maltese Government, technology is the main factor in the business and transformation of Malta into a European ICT innovation center.\n\nThe Acronis, Runa Capital and Parallels companies Group will support Malta in its transformation by accelerating innovation and participating in national initiatives to adopt blockchain technology. Runa Capital will be the first venture capital company in the republic to provide funding to local technology startups. Acronis and Parallels will launch joint research projects with local companies and Parallels and create a new research center focused on advanced data protection technologies, artificial intelligence and blockchain. The companies are expected to invest $10 million in the project over three years through expanding their presence in the country, venture capital, research and development.\n\nCompanies support Malta's ambition to become a hub for using applications with blockchain technology. Earlier, the Cabinet of Ministers of Malta approved the first draft of the national strategy for promoting blockchain, thereby providing support to local companies in introducing this technology into various sectors of the economy. Acronis will share the experience of using blockchain technology. Acronis is the first global company to launch a blockchain-based data notarization product, Acronis Notary. In the first six months since the launch of the product, Acronis Notary has certified more than 500,000 data backups, which is an indisputable confirmation of the authenticity of their data for users.\n\nMajor flagship product update - Acronis Backup\n\nIn 2017, Acronis launched a new version of its flagship product, Acronis Backup 12.5, at the Moscow office. In the comments to the photo album on this occasion on the Acronis page on the VK social network, the company noted that \"the largest Acronis development team is working in Russia, which worked to create and release a corporate solution that has no analogues in the world - Acronis Backup 12.5\"[5]\n\nThe entire Acronis Backup product line is now available on a single[6] platform[7].\n\n2015: Acronis implements quantum encryption\n\nOn September 30, 2015, Acronis announced plans to introduce quantum encryption technologies into its data protection products. The Swiss ID Quantique will help her in this, the investor of which is the QWave Capital fund[8] by Sergei Belousov. [8].\n\nAcronis will develop quantum cryptography technologies. The vendor plans to equip their products with them and believes that this will provide a higher level of security and privacy. Acronis expects to be the first company on the market to implement such protection methods.\n\nAcronis' partner in the development of quantum cryptography will be the Swiss company ID Quantique, with which the vendor has entered into an agreement. ID Quantique is a company associated with Acronis CEO Sergei Belousov - he is the founder of QWave Capital, one of ID Quantique's investors.\n\nOne of the technologies that Acronis plans to implement in its solutions is quantum key distribution. The encryption key is transmitted over the fiber channel via single photons. An attempt to intercept or measure certain parameters of physical objects, which in this case are carriers of information, inevitably distorts other parameters. As a result, the sender and receiver detect an attempt to obtain unauthorized access to the information. It is also planned to apply quantum random number generators and encryption that is resistant to quantum algorithms.\n\nID Quantique technologies focus on information protection in the public sector and commercial companies.\n\n\"Quantum computing requires a new approach to data protection,\" Sergei Belousov said. - We at Acronis are convinced that privacy is one of the most important components in comprehensive data protection in the cloud. Today, we are working with leading companies such as ID Quantique to ensure that users of our cloud products get the safest solutions in the industry and are protected from future threats and attacks. \"\n\nAcronis expresses confidence that quantum encryption will help save customers (who believe that the provider will be able to read their data) from fear of sending data to the cloud.\n\n2014\n\n18 offices worldwide, 650 employees\n\nAccording to Acronis co-founder Sergei Belousov, as of the beginning of 2014, the company has 18 offices around the world, in total Acronis sells software in 14 languages ​ ​ in 180 countries. The company is registered in Switzerland, but its largest offices are in Moscow, Munich and Boston. In total, Acronis has about 650 employees, 350 of whom are in Russia (mainly developers).\n\nUntil recently, we conducted all development exclusively in Russia, but now about 10% of these functions have been transferred to the United States, - said Belousov[9]\n\nPurchase of the American company nScaled\n\nOn September 18, 2014, Acronis announced the acquisition of nScaled, a provider of Disaster-Recovery-as-a-Service (DRaaS). One of the sellers of the company was the Almaz Capital Partners fund. For more information, see: nScaled.\n\nBack Up It Now!

Their annual income 2-3 years ago exceeded $100 million, and the growth rate is at least 30% per year.\n\nIn the ranking of the fastest growing companies in the United States of Inc.5000 (in all industries), DataArt, Exigen Services and Acronis were noted, which, although they place their headquarters outside the Russian Federation, are Russian at the location of the main production site, Russoft also recalls in its study[10].\n\n2008: Registration in Switzerland\n\nIn 2008, Acronis was incorporated in Switzerland.\n\n2006: Turnover growth by 150% per year\n\nAccording to Maxim Tsyplyaev, the company's turnover at that time increased by about 150% per year.

Of these, 180 specialists - software developers - were in Russia[11]\n\n2003: Founding of the Company\n\nAcronis was founded by graduates of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) Sergey Belousov, Ilya Zubarev and Maxim Tsyplyaev. Acronis is working on technologies, the foundations of which have been laid since 1991 as part of the Russian startup FizTechSoft.\n\nTsyplyaev in an interview in 2006 said that the company was formed by a group of people at the end of 2000[12] The first Acronis Disk Director Suite was released in early 2001. The new product began to be sold almost instantly, but the developers understood that in Russia it was impossible to count on large volumes of licensed software sales, and decided to bring products to foreign markets.\n\nThe first were the markets of Germany and Japan. In these countries, we already had partners in our previous activities, they knew about the plans and products of Acronis, so it was not difficult to agree on the promotion of software, \"said Tsyplyaev. - And in the summer of 2001, we were able to open an office in the United States and start working in the American market in full force.\n\nProducts began to be sold in Russia later than in the West.\n\nA 2016 publication on the Acronis blog on the Habr website said that since 2000, work on the product has been carried out by a company called SWSoft. The owner of Fiztech Software bought the technology and the team. And when the line of products based on the then written code began to be sold, SWSoft singled out the future Acronis as a separate company. The new name appeared in January 2001 (at the same time the COM and RU domains were registered). Officially, the company appeared in 2003[13]."
