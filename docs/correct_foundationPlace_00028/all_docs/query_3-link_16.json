        "text": "Earvin “Magic” Johnson is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Magic Johnson Enterprises, an investment conglomerate that provides high-quality products and services that focus primarily on ethnically diverse and underserved urban communities. Having left the basketball court for the boardroom, Johnson parlayed the skills and tenacity he acquired on the court into a winning formula for his successful business ventures.\n\nFor the last two decades Johnson has consistently turned heads with his unprecedented partnerships. In his early years as an entrepreneur, he forged an alliance with Sony Pictures to develop Magic Johnson Theatres. In 1998, he teamed with Starbucks to become the only franchisee in the history of the company, acquiring and eventually selling 125 stores in a lucrative move which further solidified his position in the business world. Both ventures served as catalysts for redevelopment in urban communities, and are widely recognized as the corporate blueprint for engagement and success with urban consumers across America.\n\nStill a commanding presence in the sports world, he made history in 2012 when he became co-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, a Major League Baseball franchise that was purchased for an astronomical $2 billion dollars. It was the highest purchase price for any professional sports team at the time. He also co-owns the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA, Major League Soccer’s Los Angeles Football Club, and eSports franchise Team Liquid.\n\nJohnson continues to expand his influence through a number of other investments. He currently has controlling interests in EquiTrust, a $20 billion financial services company, and SodexoMAGIC, a food service and facilities management company.\n\nThe Lansing native is constantly evolving and remaining relevant in a dynamic digital age by broadening his scope into infrastructure and technology. In 2015, Magic Johnson Enterprises and Loop Capital formed an alliance to create MJE-Loop Capital Partners. The firm raised a fund committed to investing millions of dollars on infrastructure improvement in the United States.\n\nOperating under the philosophy that true success is making others successful, he is one of the leading investors in a number of minority-owned tech companies that include Uncharted Power, an award-winning power and data infrastructure technology company; Jopwell, a diversity and hiring recruiting platform; and ShotTracker, a company that makes wearable technology for basketball players that helps track player and ball movement. In 2021, Johnson was appointed to the board of directors for Fanatics, a sports licensing company, and Cameo, a company that lets celebrities sell personalized messages to fans. With his unique positioning as a businessman spanning multiple industries and generations, he aims to help companies expand and foster a positive impact domestically and globally.\n\nTery Howard is the founder of Peer Vision Consulting, whose focus is on assisting clubs and venues with strategic planning and resource structuring, delivering transformative and sustainable technology that is competitive and operationally effective.

Prior to the Dolphins, Tery started her career at Carnival Cruise Lines, pioneering the technology to automate Carnival’s fleet, over a period of 15 years.\n\nIn June, 2018 Tery was awarded the Executive of the Year award at the Stadium Business Summit, a global gathering of stadium industry leaders and renowned executives. Tery was recognized for her achievements as a sports venue leader, pioneering the vision of digital transformation and fan experience. Tery has also been recognized by SportsBusiness Journal as a Game Changer in Sports for her innovation and impact on the industry. Tery was a finalist for the Technology Leader of the Year Award at the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce. Under her leadership, the Dolphins were recognized by InfoWorld as one of the “Top 100” companies that have made the best use of technology to enhance their business and also recognized by PC Magazine as one of the “Top 10” companies using technology in intelligent ways to improve their business. Finally, with Tery at the helm, her team was recognized by ComputerWorld as leaders in “Best Practices in Mobile & Wireless.”\n\nRespected throughout the industry, Tery has published articles and is frequently called upon to contribute to IT presentations, panel discussions and workshops, locally and globally. Tery is actively involved in various community initiatives and advisory boards, providing guidance and a leadership role in the community and beyond. Tery was recognized by the FBI Cyber Division for her vision and support of the FBI-SOS (Safe Online Surfing) Internet Challenge and was tapped as the recipient of the “Glass Ceiling Award” from Florida Diversity Council. She now serves as an advisor to the Florida CIO Executive Council and Sports and Entertainment Alliance and Technology.

He attained unrivaled success from his high school days playing in Bruceton, Tennessee, to his four years dominating the Southeastern Conference while playing at Ole Miss, to his 8-year career as a legendary linebacker for the 49ers. He demonstrated at every level through hard work, determination, and perseverance along the way what it means to be a champion at heart and role model to others.\n\nAs the oldest of four children growing up in a small town with very limited resources, Patrick served as both a big brother and mentor to his younger siblings. He held various jobs early in life to help contribute to his family. By the time he reached high school, Willis was a standout football, basketball, and baseball player. While starring at Central High as a running back and linebacker, Willis became the first player in Tennessee history to be nominated for the Mr. Football Award as both a lineman and back in the same season.\n\nDespite that success, he was regarded as a 3-star prospect and received limited scholarship opportunities to play Division I college football. When Willis visited Oxford, MS, he knew right away that Ole Miss was the place for him. As a true freshman in 2003, Willis made an immediate impact for the Rebels, playing in all 13 games and contributing on defense and special teams. He also excelled in the classroom, earning the Scholar Athlete Award from the Ole Miss chapter of the National Football Foundation and the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nDuring his sophomore year, he developed into one of the best linebackers in the Southeastern Conference, receiving honorable mention All-SEC honors from the Associated Press. By his junior year, Willis dominated at middle linebacker, leading the conference in tackles per game and being named SEC Defensive Player of the Year, 1st Team All-SEC, and 1st Team All-American.\n\nAlthough tempted to declare for the NFL Draft following that campaign, Willis remained at Ole Miss for his senior season, which turned out to be a great decision. He once again led the SEC in tackles and was named SEC Defensive Player of the Year, was a consensus 1st Team All-American, and won the prestigious Butkus Award as the most outstanding linebacker in college football.\n\nThe following spring, Willis was selected 11th overall by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2007 NFL Draft. It didn’t take long to demonstrate that he would achieve similar success in the league. As a rookie, he led the NFL in tackles, was selected to the Pro Bowl, named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, and was selected as a 1st Team All-Pro. That success continued throughout his career, with Willis being chosen for seven straight Pro Bowls, receiving five 1st Team and two 2nd Team All-Pro selections, and widely being regarded as the most dominant linebacker in the NFL.\n\nFollowing his eighth season, which was cut short by a foot injury that required surgery, Willis was forced into early retirement from the league. His impact over the first seven years of his career did not go unnoticed. Willis was inducted into the 49ers Hall of Fame, receiving his “Red Jacket”, in 2021. That same year, he was also selected as a finalist for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the highest honor a football player can attain.\n\nIan Rush was once asked to name the most promising player in Liverpool’s ranks and he replied Steve McManaman.\n\nMacca, who was an Everton supporter, arrived at Liverpool at 14 years of age. Ten days after his first England Under-21 international, Steve got his first taste of first-team action when he came on as a substitute against Sheffield United at Anfield. He next appeared in the starting line-up in the opening game of the 1991-92 season. Macca had a sensational season, playing 51 games and scoring 10 goals, and crowned it with a man-of-the-match performance in the FA Cup final at Wembley against Sunderland. He kept on going the following season by playing 41 and scoring seven goals.\n\nWhen Roy Evans took over in 1994, Macca was given a free role and no longer being tied to the wings, which inspired him to new heights. Liverpool beat Crystal Palace 6-1 in the first game of the season, and he netted twice.\n\nHis best performance was the 1995 Coca-Cola Cup final at Wembley when he scored two fantastic goals in a 2-1 win over Bolton. So good was his performance Kopites called it ‘The McManaman final.’\n\nHe then enjoyed a fantastic 1995-96 season and his link-up play with great friend Robbie Fowler was just sensational. Liverpool showed championship form at times but the season ended in disappointment. The summer went well though for him when he starred for England in Euro 96, reaching the semi-finals.\n\nThat autumn speculation was rife that Juventus and Barcelona were going to offer £12 million pounds for him.\n\nIn 1997-98 captain John Barnes left Liverpool and Macca, now the most experienced player in the side, became vice-captain to Paul Ince. He scored 12 goals that season, including sensational goals against Celtic and Arsenal.\n\nMacca’s ninth and last season was not a pleasant one. Tiredness had set in from playing constantly for years and niggling injuries prevented him from impressing new boss Gerard Houllier. In the beginning of November, Macca was ordered to take complete rest until Christmas.\n\nAt the end of January, he announced he would be leaving for European champions Real Madrid on a Bosman deal. Real discovered the lad could also play and he starred in the Champions league final in his first season, scoring a superb goal.\n\nHe later came back to England to play for Manchester City alongside good mate Robbie Fowler, and is now a respected football TV pundit. Previous Clubs: Real Madrid, Manchester City\n\nSantana Moss is a former American football wide receiver who played in the National Football League (NFL) for fourteen seasons. He played college football for the University of Miami, where he earned All-American honors. Moss was picked by the New York Jets in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft, where he spent 4 seasons with the team, before playing for the Washington Redskins for 10 seasons. Moss was selected as an All-Pro in 2005.\n\nKnown for his big play potential, Moss started the 2005 season off with a bang in Week 2 against the Dallas Cowboys, where he caught two touchdown passes of 39 and 70 yards from Mark Brunell in the last five minutes to come from behind and beat the Cowboys 14–13.\n\nHis 2005 season with the Redskins was the best in his professional career, with 84 receptions for 1,483 yards (second highest in the NFL that year), setting a new Redskins single-season receiving record – a record he still holds to this day, and nine touchdowns. In 2005, Moss also was selected to his first NFL Pro Bowl. Moss recorded 18 rushing yards and 3 catches for 39 receiving yards at the Pro Bowl.\n\nIn the 2010 season, Moss recorded 1,115 receiving yards making this the fourth time in his career that he recorded over 1,000 receiving yards. He achieved a new career high of 93 receptions to go along with six touchdowns in the 2010 season.\n\nAfter the Week 11 game against the Philadelphia Eagles during the 2013 season, he surpassed 10,000 career receiving yards making him the seventh active player at that time to reach this milestone.\n\nChris started Sondela Consulting to focus on his passion for working with MSPs to help them become more successful and more efficient by understanding and utilizing their tools more effectively. Sondela is a Zulu word for “Advance” which is a nod to Chris’s Southern African roots and is an apt name with his number one goal being to help MSPs gain a deeper understanding of their investment and realize profitability much quicker.\n\nThe 14 years of experience Chris gained through previously running an MSP business combined with working at Autotask has given him greater insight and understanding into both sides of the industry and how a PSA tool can provide efficiencies and profitability when implemented properly. Chris can take you from zero to hero with your PSA tool, using it to its full potential, and maximizing every aspect of your business to ensure that every department is working in harmony.
